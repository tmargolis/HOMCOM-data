SUPMALE:What are you doing, Darlene? Dad bought a new garbage disposal Before he went into the hospital, so i'm installing it.
LEADMALE:You don't know how to do that.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a simple machine, Becky, that eats up garbage, No more complicated than your husband.
SUPMALE:That's dad's job.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I just thought it'd be a nice surprise for him for when he got home.
LEADMALE:Well, it won't.
SUPFEMALE:It'll make him feel Like we think he can't do that kinda stuff anymore, Like, we're treating him like some invalid or something.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you may be right.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm right.
LEADMALE:Can you get me the flashlight out of the drawer? Shine it right there.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't taken out the old one yet.
LEADFEMALE:It's stuck.
SUPFEMALE:It doesn't want to come out.
LEADMALE:I guess this is the dream house for a garbage disposal.
SUPFEMALE:It was weird seeing dad like that.
LEADMALE:He seemed so Frail.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:God, I never thought i'd see him like that.
SUPFEMALE:I never even conceived of something like this happening.
LEADMALE:Yeah, like i'd see those guys, These big guys and they'd have these huge chili dogs That they'd be munching on And i'd think, "whoa, there's a heart attack waiting to happen.
OTHERMALE:" God, Becky, I mean Maybe people thought that when they saw dad.
LEADFEMALE:I never did.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Me either.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should have.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm pretty sure Chili dogs are off-limits for the old man from here on out.
LEADMALE:Yeah, which means mom can't eat hers in bed now, so What if he died? He's not gonna die, Becky.
LEADFEMALE:He's gonna be fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe not this time, but someday.
LEADFEMALE:What are you thinking? Just shut up, Becky.
LEADMALE:What, don't you ever think about that? Don't you ever wonder what it'd be like if dad died? God That would be Weird.
SUPMALE:And mom-Mom will never die.
LEADMALE:It'd be weird to come in here Without dad being here.
LEADMALE:Hey, what do you say we just let dad do this when he gets home? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You got to be bored out of your skull, doll.
LEADMALE:No, they got a lot of great magazines laying around here.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to this, "with the election a month away, Bush leads dukakis By 12 percentage points.

SUPFEMALE:That's all I had was the fight.
SUPMALE:Listen, I don't mind that you pegged me For one of these guys that has to keep grinding it out, But you had me feeling like I was shoveling coal on the titanic.
OTHERMALE:No matter how fast I was shoveling, It just keeps going down.
LEADMALE:I've been shoveling so hard That I haven't had time to deal with the stuff I was gonna fix later, you know? I'm gonna quit drinking later, I'm gonna start watching what I eat later, I'm gonna deal with my problems With my mom and my old man later.
