LEADFEMALE:You haven't overspent your allowance again, have you? Now dear, you haven't seen me wearing any new hats lately, have you? Not this week.
LEADMALE:Look what i've done, dear.
SUPMALE:I've cleared off two whole shelves, So that the Deej can fill them up with his football trophies.
SUPMALE:You know, dear, i'm kind of worried about the Deej.
LEADMALE:I think that-I mean, I don't think, I-I feel While he likes football, He may actually like music a little better.
OTHERMALE:Music? The Deej? Yes, dear, haven't you noticed? He's got that pop-beat fever.
SUPMALE:No son of mine is going to be playing in a rock 'n' roll band.
LEADFEMALE:"rock 'n' roll.
SUPFEMALE:" The kids call it music, but I call it noise.
LEADMALE:But, dear, Do you really think it would hurt To let the Deej decide this for himself? Well-No.
LEADMALE:Let's leave the Deej be And let him make up his own mind.
LEADFEMALE:You wanted to see me, dear? Rosey, you've got some explaining to do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, dear.
SUPMALE:I guess sometimes a woman's emotions Just get the best of her.
LEADMALE:Well, I forgive you.
SUPMALE:You know, I guess the Deej will do whatever he wants to do.
LEADFEMALE:Kids these days just don't listen.
OTHERMALE:Well, I think I know the Deej, dear, And he is not going to do anything without his father's approval.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i'll talk to him.
LEADMALE:What is it, dear? It's just so hard being a man.
SUPMALE:You have to clean out the gutters, balance the checkbook, Solve all the kids' problems, And still worry about that darn anderson account.
LEADFEMALE:Oh dear, don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:I'm sure the solution to that darn anderson account Will come to you.
