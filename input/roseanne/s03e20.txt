SUPFEMALE:Which is Uh, like the gas.
LEADMALE:And this is The brake.
SUPFEMALE:Which is Like the brake.
LEADFEMALE:And You don't ever want me to use the two of them together.
OTHERMALE:Because Because it could rip a hole in time and space, and We end up in a parallel universe.
OTHERFEMALE:Correct.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't wait till tomorrow to really lay some rubber.
LEADFEMALE:Look, why don't we just tool around in the parking lot at the K-Mart first? What? You don't think I can handle this thing? No.
SUPMALE:It's not that, honey.
OTHERMALE:This is a very special bike.
LEADMALE:Yes, I know you love your bike.
OTHERMALE:You spend more time with this thing than you do with me.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, don't get upset.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's true, Dan.
SUPMALE:I was talking to the bike.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm tired of being the biker chick.
OTHERMALE:I want the wind to hit my body first, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I want the insects to splat across my face.
LEADMALE:Come on, you get on the back.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm! Wow! Suddenly I feel like Ann-Margaret in Kitten with a Whip.
LEADFEMALE:Look, our favorite fun couple Becky and anybody-but-that-guy.

LEADMALE:I mean, the frame is righteous, no bondo, V-8, tilt tranny.
LEADMALE:No bondo? Not even a little? Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, the motor's in really good shape.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at it.
LEADFEMALE:Mark did the work himself.
LEADMALE:I put in brakes, shocks, rebuilt the carburetor.
LEADMALE:Probably made the license plates.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, check out the tuna boat.
LEADMALE:I want to sit in it.
LEADMALE:Just look at the size of the back seat.
LEADFEMALE:Just put a mirror on the ceiling.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like you retooled the heads.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:New valves, seals, everything.
LEADMALE:Nice work.
LEADFEMALE:And it's only $1,500.
SUPMALE:Thanks for bringing it by.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Think about it.
OTHERMALE:I won't need to bug you for your car.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, you won't be driving me around or worrying about me banging up your car.
LEADMALE:We like all that stuff.
LEADFEMALE:You got a nice bike.
LEADMALE:Ever think of selling it? Actually, I'm planning on being buried with it.
SUPFEMALE:So, what about the car? We'll talk, inside.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. Starts good.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, thanks for bringing the car over.
OTHERFEMALE:No problem.
SUPMALE:What, is he going to mail you your tongue back? It breaks down to about $100 a month.
SUPMALE:This isn't your territory.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, but Becky's my sister.
LEADFEMALE:What touches her touches me.
LEADMALE:So she gets a car, you get one when you're 16? You don't want me to think she's your favorite.
SUPMALE:Well, I can live with that.
LEADFEMALE:What about you, Dan? Hey, can we talk about me now? This is really important to me.
LEADMALE:I'll get a job after school.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now, there's a start.
SUPFEMALE:If we all start socking it away now, maybe we can swing it by summer.
SUPFEMALE:Summer? Lend me the money now, and I'll pay you back.
OTHERFEMALE:Geez, it's like $1,500, Becky, and that doesn't count insurance.
LEADFEMALE:I know how you feel.
LEADMALE:When I was 16, I was dying for my dad to buy me this gorgeous '64 Barracuda.
SUPMALE:It had these yellow racing stripes on this purple body.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of the "way back" machine.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I have 200 bucks saved up.
SUPMALE:Where? You only got like 40 in your sock drawer.
LEADFEMALE:Mother.
LEADMALE:I got like 50 bucks you can borrow, Beck.
LEADFEMALE:That'll just leave you guys with 1,250.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what's in it for you? Well, I lend you the money, interest-free, and then when I'm 16, we share the car.
OTHERMALE:You think I'd share a car with you? No way.
SUPFEMALE:Then forget it.
LEADMALE:Junior miss can take the bus till she's 40.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see why I'm always the one in this family who has to make the sacrifices.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Let's sell the villa in France, Dan.
LEADMALE:We hardly ever use it.
LEADFEMALE:If you guys really wanted to help me, you could.
SUPFEMALE:I hate it when she gets like this and there's nothing to eat! I feel bad I can't afford to buy her a car.
SUPMALE:Oh, she'll live.
SUPFEMALE:She can use one of ours at night and on weekends.
LEADMALE:But that was the one she really wanted.
LEADFEMALE:She didn't even know she wanted a car till he put her up to it.
SUPFEMALE:Before she met him, the only thing she wanted out of life was to see us dead.
SUPMALE:That's not good enough for her now.
LEADFEMALE:She's got to have a car, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Well I miss the old days.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, I've been waiting 15 years for this moment.
LEADMALE:Today you are mine.

OTHERFEMALE:Me and this hog are going out to tear up the highway.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you can either come with us or you can eat my dust.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I should ride it out of town first.
SUPMALE:Then you can take over on the open road.
LEADFEMALE:You're just afraid your low-life buddies will see you riding on the back and think you're a wuss.
