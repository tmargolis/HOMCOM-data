LEADFEMALE:Darlene, it's over between us.
SUPMALE:But I think he misses me And wants to come crawling back.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not hungry at all anymore.
LEADMALE:Then how come he didn't ask you out for friday night? What do you mean? Well, you've got to wonder What other moron he's crawling to.

SUPMALE:But you're not hanging around with david If he's pulling this crap.
LEADFEMALE:How come he was in Chicago? How should I know? Something about a comic book convention.
LEADFEMALE:Comic book convention, huh? 'Cause you know I can call the school And find out if you ditched, too.
LEADFEMALE:The convention was only there for two days.
OTHERMALE:You went to Chicago with him? It's not a big deal out of this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I am going to make A huge deal out of this! You get up for school and wind up in Chicago? We don't even know? Something could have happened! How could you do something so stupid? We took the bus.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing happened.
SUPMALE:Till now.
SUPMALE:You're grounded.
LEADMALE:You are so grounded.
SUPFEMALE:And don't think you're just laying around.
LEADMALE:You'll do something useful.
LEADMALE:And you'll hate it.
LEADFEMALE:Or else we'll think of something Even more useful.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't anybody want to know why we went? You're not seeing david no more.
LEADMALE:Because of him you lied, You went to Chicago, and you skipped school.
LEADMALE:You need more? The convention was important to us.
LEADMALE:We're serious about this stuff.
SUPFEMALE:You can do better than that, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:So did Mark say where he was going After he left the shop? Hey, can I have some of that chocolate? No, d.j. It's baker's chocolate.
OTHERMALE:You won't like it.
LEADFEMALE:Please? It doesn't have any sugar in it.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:It won't spoil my dinner.

LEADFEMALE:To go to Chicago Without telling anybody, I won't! You could have told them it was important.
LEADFEMALE:They think this comic book convention Is just some lame excuse to cut school.
SUPFEMALE:They think that me and david Are like Mark and Becky.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't say anything! You told me how great it was That I was finally getting into something.
SUPFEMALE:They weren't going to listen to me! You're right.
LEADMALE:The best thing to do Was to let them dump all over me.
LEADMALE:Darlene! Just leave me alone.
LEADMALE:Thanks for picking me up, beck.
LEADFEMALE:Deej, where's mom? She went out.
LEADMALE:She said she'd be back in an hour.

SUPFEMALE:Here we go again.
LEADFEMALE:Now she'll sit in her room And mope for six months.
SUPMALE:She's so immature.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, we'll be in in a minute.
SUPMALE:Oh! The branch is creaking, Jackie.
LEADMALE:It never creaked back when we were kids.

SUPMALE:Mom and dad never did figure out We could hear everything that went on in their bedroom thru that vent.
SUPMALE:Screaming and yelling and crying.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We never did hear any sex Unless that's what all the crying and yelling was about.
SUPMALE:Well, it helped us figure out How bad trouble we were in.
LEADMALE:Five minutes before the knock on the door.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But that was a help.
LEADMALE:Gave us a chance to run in and confess, Score those honesty points.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, or get our stories straight.
OTHERFEMALE:You remember the week we took turns listening To see if they knew about bloomington? Yeah, that frat party.
LEADFEMALE:We were may too mature for high school guys.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so we end up with these future doctors and lawyers Playing up, up and away on their armpits.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:We slept in a car.
SUPFEMALE:What were we thinking? We could have gotten really hurt, you know, And mom and dad had no idea where we were.
LEADFEMALE:But I guess that's just the Crazy kind of stuff kids do.
SUPMALE:Oh, gee, Jackie, That sounds just like what Darlene did.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'm just no better than her.
SUPMALE:How could I be so blind? My point exactly.
LEADFEMALE:When you remember to water your chia pet, You can criticize the way I raise my kids.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, wait.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:, so what we did was stupid.
LEADMALE:But if we would have gotten caught, We would have gotten busted and deserved it.
OTHERMALE:Yes, but Darlene says that what she did was important.
LEADMALE:She said the same thing When she shaved d.j. 's head.
OTHERFEMALE:The comic book thing means a lot to her.
OTHERFEMALE:I Believe her, because she gave me hell For not sticking up for her.
SUPMALE:Usually when she's mad at you, she's nice to me.
LEADFEMALE:Now we're on the same side.
SUPMALE:That just stinks.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADMALE:, so this thing is really important to her.
LEADFEMALE:I never told her to quit the comic book thing.
OTHERFEMALE:You did, kind of, 'cause david does the pictures.

SUPMALE:You were so mean to me.
LEADMALE:I was not.
LEADMALE:Yes, you were! You lied to me all the time.
SUPMALE:You'd tease me and pinch me.
OTHERMALE:Mom would say, "just ignore her and she'll stop.
LEADFEMALE:" Mom never understood me.
OTHERMALE:My field hockey trophy was right here, And this is the clock that mom got When aunt betty died.
LEADFEMALE:The fish! Oh, god! Yeah! Dad's stuffed swordfish deal.

OTHERMALE:Spanked? Come on, Jackie.
LEADMALE:He hit us with a belt.
SUPMALE:Well, kids got hit with belts.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but did their dads Strap some big razor strap on the wall Right by the front door, So when you came in you'd see it And always worry what would happen If you stepped out of line? Maybe he was trying to psyche us out.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well.
LEADMALE:He was good at that.
LEADMALE:Remember he'd make us bring it to him? Well, mom wasn't any help either.
LEADMALE:She could have said something.
SUPFEMALE:She'd just stay in there washing dishes.
SUPFEMALE:That was mom.
SUPFEMALE:Ignore it, and it'll go away.
SUPMALE:She let the damn thing hang there, And we're supposed to explain why it's there To our friends? I told people it was Elvis' belt.
OTHERMALE:Well, yeah.
OTHERMALE:But you had stupid friends.
LEADMALE:Or they were just trying to be nice.
LEADFEMALE:Let's face it, Jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Our family was like totally screwed up, Which is probably why I got fat And you can't have any decent relationship With any man.
SUPFEMALE:Or Maybe I just never found the right guy, And you never found the wrong doughnut.
OTHERFEMALE:Well That's probably how we survived.
LEADFEMALE:We could always make each other laugh.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Are you sorry you came? No.
