SUPMALE:MOM, WHO INVENTED THE IRON? I DON'T KNOW.
LEADMALE:PROBABLY SOME MAN.
SUPMALE:ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
SUPFEMALE:IT WAS INVENTED BY A WOMAN-YOLANDA I-RON.
OTHERMALE:I BELIEVE SHE WAS A ROMANIAN, DETERMINED TO DRIVE THE CREASE PROBLEM OUT OF CENTRAL EUROPE.
LEADMALE:WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? SHE WAS KILLED.
SUPMALE:WHERE ARE YOU GOING? BUDGET CLUB.
SUPMALE:YEAH, CAN I COME? I'M TAKING THE HARLEY.
LEADFEMALE:YOU CAN'T CARRY NOTHING ON THAT.
LEADFEMALE:I'M JUST GOING FOR SMALL STUFF-YOU KNOW, LIKE BATTERIES.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, FINE.
LEADMALE:I HAVE FRIENDS OF MY OWN.
SUPMALE:I'LL JUST GO OUT BY MYSELF LATER.
LEADMALE:WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL JACKIE AND STRAIGHTEN THIS WHOLE THING OUT.
SUPMALE:NO! BESIDES, I DID, AND SHE WON'T TALK TO ME.
LEADMALE:MOM, I THINK THIS BELONGS TO AUNT JACKIE.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, PUT IT IN THE BOX.
LEADFEMALE:ARE YOU GUYS STILL NOT TALKING? I GUESS SO.
LEADFEMALE:BOY, YOU MUST'VE REALLY MESSED UP THIS TIME, MOM.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, BECKY, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU AND YOUR SISTER GET MAD AT EACH OTHER-NOT FOR ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR.
LEADMALE:JUST ONE OF YOU WILL DO SOMETHING REALLY STUPID, NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FIGHTING.
LEADFEMALE:OR NOT EVEN SOMETHING STUPID.
LEADMALE:JUST, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT WAS NONE OF YOUR MOTHER'S BUSINESS-YOUR SISTER'S BUSINESS.
LEADMALE:BYE, DAN.
LEADMALE:SEE YOU.
LEADFEMALE:SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TODAY? YOU GONNA PLAY WITH, UH, DIANE? WE'RE GOING TO THE MALL, MOM.
SUPFEMALE:THAT'S COOL.
LEADMALE:I'LL DRIVE YOU DOWN THERE, AND THEN I'LL JUST COME IN, YOU KNOW, LOOK AROUND.
LEADFEMALE:MOM, YOU'RE BECOMING A LEECH.
SUPFEMALE:WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL CRYSTAL? YEAH, PLAY WITH SOMEONE YOUR OWN AGE.
LEADFEMALE:HI.
LEADFEMALE:YOU'VE REACHED THE CONNER PARTY LINE.
SUPFEMALE:IF YOU WEREN'T STILL FIGHTING WITH AUNT JACKIE, YOU WOULDN'T BE HANGING OUT WITH CRYSTAL EVERY DAY.
OTHERMALE:WELL, THAT ISN'T TRUE, AND ONE THING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OTHER.
LEADMALE:I HAVE JUST AS MUCH FUN WITH CRYSTAL AS I EVER DID WITH YOUR AUNT JACKIE.
LEADMALE:MOM, IT'S CRYSTAL.
OTHERFEMALE:SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT TIME YOU'RE COMING OVER TO HELP ORGANIZE HER PLATES.
SUPFEMALE:HI.
SUPMALE:HI.
SUPMALE:FOR YOU.
LEADMALE:OH, THANK YOU.
LEADMALE:THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
SUPFEMALE:WHAT? I SAID THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL! HOW CAN YOU THINK WITH THE MUSIC THIS LOUD? I CAN'T.
LEADFEMALE:THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT LOUD.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NOTHING.
LEADMALE:I'M JUST GETTING RID OF STUFF, THROWING AWAY JUNK I DON'T NEED ANYMORE.
LEADMALE:HEY, DID YOU, UH-YOU KNOW, I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT, UH, DID YOU TALK TO YOUR SISTER YET? NO.
LEADMALE:OH, COME ON, JACKIE, IT'S BEEN 3 WEEKS.
LEADMALE:I MEAN, I FEEL REALLY BAD.
OTHERFEMALE:SOME OF THIS IS MY FAULT.
OTHERFEMALE:NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, GAR.
OTHERMALE:IT'S NO BIG DEAL, REALLY.
SUPFEMALE:SOMETIMES WE DON'T TALK AT ALL.
LEADMALE:YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT, THAT'S OK.
LEADMALE:BUT, YOU KNOW, MY BROTHER AND I DON'T SPEAK.
SUPFEMALE:WE--WE NEVER WRITE, WE NEVER VISIT, NOTHING, AND I THINK THAT'S PRETTY SAD.
LEADMALE:OH, THAT IS SAD.
LEADMALE:YOU SHOULD AT LEAST WRITE.
OTHERMALE:WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME, JACKIE.
LEADMALE:CAN WE? JUST LET ME SAY ONE THING.
LEADFEMALE:I THINK THAT IT IS VERY SAD THAT 2 SISTERS, THAT ARE LIVING IN THE SAME CITY, AREN'T EVEN SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER.
SUPMALE:ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M IN LOVE WITH ONE OF 'EM.
LEADMALE:OHH! I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD DO SOMETHING SPECIAL TODAY.
LEADFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:WHAT? OH, HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, JACKIE.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, DAN, HOW YOU DOING? HI, DAN.
SUPFEMALE:WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? OH, I JUST CAME BY TO SEE MY SISTER-IN-LAW.
LEADFEMALE:IS THAT SO UNUSUAL? WELL, IT'S JUST THAT YOU NEVER DID IT BEFORE, THAT'S ALL.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, I HAVE NOW.
LEADMALE:GREAT.
OTHERMALE:GOOD.
SUPFEMALE:SO, HOW'S THE JOB? THE KIDS? MY SISTER? FINE.
LEADFEMALE:EVERYBODY'S FINE.
LEADFEMALE:LISTEN, I JUST WANTED, YOU KNOW-YOU GOT COMPANY, SO NO, WHAT? WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AROUND.
SUPFEMALE:I JUST WANTED TO SAY HI.
SUPMALE:HI.
SUPMALE:DAN CAN WE TALK? YEAH.
SUPFEMALE:HEY, GARY, THIS IS JUST FAMILY STUFF.
OTHERMALE:I'LL ONLY BE A MINUTE.
LEADFEMALE:YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
SUPFEMALE:YOU WANT TO GO IN THE BEDROOM? YEAH.
LEADMALE:LISTEN, I, UH YOU KNOW LISTEN, JACKIE, I THINK I'M GONNA TAKE A WALK DOWN TO THE CORNER.
LEADFEMALE:YOU NEED ANYTHING? NO, GAR, NO.
LEADFEMALE:NO.
LEADFEMALE:WE'LL JUST BE A SECOND.
SUPFEMALE:YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.
OTHERMALE:NO.
LEADFEMALE:DAN, TELL HIM HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO.
SUPFEMALE:I'D KILL FOR A ROOT BEER.
LEADMALE:GREAT.
OTHERFEMALE:I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
LEADMALE:OK, WHAT? ALL RIGHT, LET ME SAY FIRST FIRST OF ALL THAT I'VE NEVER POKED MY NOSE INTO YOUR BUSINESS, CORRECT? CORRECT.
LEADMALE:UP TILL 10 MINUTES AGO, I NEVER THOUGHT I EVER WOULD.
LEADMALE:AND I APPRECIATE THAT, DAN.
SUPMALE:YOU'RE WELCOME.
SUPFEMALE:ROSEANNE, AS WE ALL KNOW, DOES POKE HER NOSE IN.
LEADMALE:UH-HUH.
LEADMALE:BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF SHE EVER THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING SHE EVER DID HURT YOU, IT WOULD TEAR HER UP.
LEADFEMALE:YEAH.
LEADMALE:YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN HER LIFE.
SUPFEMALE:AND RIGHT NOW SHE'S SITTING AT HOME HANGING OUT WITH CRYSTAL, TRYING TO ACT LIKE EVERYTHING'S OK, BUT EVERYTHING'S NOT OK.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S OK WITH ME.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, IT'S NOT OK WITH ROSEANNE.
LEADFEMALE:SHE'S HURTING.
SUPMALE:YOU NOT TALKING TO HER IS REALLY HURTING HER.
LEADMALE:SHE'S TOUGH.
SUPMALE:SHE'LL GET OVER IT.
LEADFEMALE:SHE NEEDS YOU, JACKIE.
SUPMALE:YOU SHUTTING HER OUT LIKE THIS IS TOO MUCH.
SUPMALE:YOU'VE GOT TO CALL HER.
LEADMALE:NO, I CAN'T.
LEADFEMALE:COME ON, I'M ASKING YOU.
SUPMALE:DAN.
OTHERMALE:SO, I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO LET HER TREAT ME LIKE THE KID SISTER FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE? NO, NO.
LEADMALE:YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
SUPFEMALE:YOU'RE NOT A KID ANYMORE.
LEADMALE:THAT'S RIGHT, DAN.
LEADMALE:THAT'S RIGHT.
LEADMALE:AND MAYBE SHE'LL LEARN.
LEADFEMALE:MAYBE NEXT TIME SHE'LL THINK BEFORE SHE OPENS HER BIG FAT MOUTH.
SUPMALE:HEY, JACKIE, THAT'S THE WAY ROSEANNE IS.
SUPFEMALE:NOW, COME ON, I'M ASKING YOU TO BE THE BIG SISTER HERE.
LEADMALE:DAN, IT HURTS ME, TOO, YOU KNOW.
SUPFEMALE:YOU THINK I LIKE NOT TALKING TO MY OWN SISTER? I DON'T LIKE IT, EITHER, BUT SHE STARTED IT.
SUPFEMALE:THAT'S THE MATURITY I WAS LOOKING FOR.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, ROSEANNE AND I WILL JUST HAVE TO WORK IT OUT ON OUR OWN.
SUPFEMALE:YEAH, WELL, I TOOK A SHOT.
OTHERFEMALE:THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.
SUPFEMALE:SO, UH, IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, HOW COME YOU'RE NOT TALKING? WELL, I I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO ANYTHING, YOU KNOW.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S JUST JACKIE, SHE'S ALWAYS SCREWING UP EVERY RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERY GUY, YOU KNOW.
LEADFEMALE:I THOUGHT MAYBE IF I POINTED OUT TO HER HER STUPID BEHAVIOR BEFORE SHE MADE A TOTAL ASS OUT OF HERSELF, THAT MAYBE SHE WOULDN'T DO IT.
LEADFEMALE:SO BASICALLY, YOU STUCK YOUR NOSE IN WHERE IT DIDN'T BELONG.
SUPFEMALE:YEAH.
SUPFEMALE:BUT YOU DID IT WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS.
LEADMALE:YEAH.
SUPFEMALE:AND YOU NEVER THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT IT MIGHT HURT JACKIE.
LEADFEMALE:NO, OF COURSE NOT.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, NOW, SHE'S YOUR SISTER.
LEADMALE:I HESITATE TO SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT JACKIE.
LEADFEMALE:NO, NO, GO AHEAD.
SUPMALE:WELL, IF I HAD A SISTER WHO LOVED ME ENOUGH TO RISK STICKING HER NECK OUT BY SAYING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH A HANDSOME, SEXY, INDEPENDENTLY EMPLOYED GUY WHO LIVES RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM YOURS TRULY, WELL, I'D BE NOTHING BUT GRATEFUL.
SUPFEMALE:REALLY? WELL, OF COURSE, ROSEANNE.
SUPFEMALE:WHAT YOU DID, YOU DID OUT OF LOVE AND CARING.
OTHERMALE:AND JACKIE KNOWS YOU WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT SOMETIMES YOU DO STUPID, INSENSITIVE THINGS, BUT WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS.
LEADFEMALE:GEE, THANKS, CRYSTAL.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, AND IF SHE CAN'T SEE THAT, WELL, SHE'S JUST AS NASTY AS CAN BE, AND YOU SHOULD TELL HER.
OTHERMALE:WELL, SHE WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.
SUPMALE:WELL, UH, WELL, THAT'S THE STUPIDEST THING I EVER HEARD.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU--YOU GET JACKIE ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU TELL HER THAT'S NOT THE WAY SISTERS TREAT ONE ANOTHER.
OTHERMALE:YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:MM-HMM.

OTHERFEMALE:YOU AND BECKY DOING SOME SATURDAY CLEANING? YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, JUST TRYING TO DO OUR SHARE.
SUPMALE:YOU WOULDN'T BE LYING TO ME, DARLENE, WOULD YOU? ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR? YOUR FAVORITE NIECE? I WOULDN'T GO BACK THERE.
SUPMALE:WE HAVEN'T CLEANED BACK THERE.
LEADFEMALE:REALLY GOOD TRY, DARLENE, REALLY GOOD.
SUPFEMALE:ROSEANNE? WHO IS IT? OK, KILL ME.
LEADFEMALE:LOOK, I WAS ON MY WAY OVER HERE-HEY, HEY, HEY! IF THIS SENTENCE HAS THE WORD "GARY" IN IT, I AM GOING TO THROW THIS BOOK AT YOU.
LEADMALE:AND IT'S JAMES MICHENER, SO YOU BETTER WATCH OUT.
OTHERFEMALE:I WAS ON MY WAY OVER HERE WHEN THE MAN I'M SEEING-OH, YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING HE SAYS.
LEADMALE:ROSEANNE, WILL YOU STOP IT? STOP IT? YOU'RE THE ONE GOING AROUND SAYING HE'S LIKE TOTALLY CONTROLLING EVERYTHING.
OTHERMALE:AND THEN I TRY TO HELP, YOU GET ALL MIXED UP AND BACKWARDS, YOU START CALLING ME THE BAD GUY, THEN YOU CAN'T EVEN SHOW UP ON TIME TO APOLOGIZE.
SUPFEMALE:I DIDN'T COME OVER HERE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU, I CAME OVER HERE TO FORGIVE YOU.
SUPMALE:OH, WELL, SORRY.
OTHERMALE:OK, APOLOGY ACCEPTED.
OTHERFEMALE:SO YOU COULDN'T, LIKE, PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL ME? NO, I WAS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

LEADFEMALE:JACKIE.
LEADFEMALE:I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
SUPMALE:WAS THAT THE BIG THING YOU WANTED TO GET OFF YOUR CHEST? OH, GARY.
SUPMALE:GARY, THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.
LEADMALE:HONEY SOMETIMES AT NIGHT I LIE IN BED AND BITE MY NAILS AND SPIT THEM ACROSS THE ROOM.

SUPFEMALE:WHY? 'CAUSE HER AND HER BEAU PULLED UP OUT FRONT.
SUPFEMALE:HEY, DAD, CAN'T YOU SEE AUNT JACKIE IN ONE OF THESE? I DON'T KNOW, BABE.

LEADFEMALE:THEY PREDICT A LOT MORE RAIN THIS SPRING THAN NORMAL.
LEADMALE:AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THIS TENT THING, THAT'S REALLY, REALLY EXPENSIVE.
OTHERMALE:SO I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE HAVE TO MOVE IT IN THE HOUSE.
LEADMALE:I DON'T KNOW.
LEADMALE:I THINK MAYBE WE'LL MOVE INSIDE.
LEADFEMALE:BUT THAT'S OK, BECAUSE, OH, IT'S STILL GONNA BE A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL WEDDING.
SUPFEMALE:AND I HAVE TO DO THIS ONE THING, AND I NEED YOU TO HELP ME WITH IT.
LEADMALE:NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WELL, IF WE'RE GONNA MOVING IT FROM OUTSIDE TO INSIDE, I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT I COULD DO TO REORGANIZING EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING, AND I WASN'T PLANNING FOR IT.
LEADFEMALE:SO I THOUGHT, WELL, WE CAN USE THIS.
LEADFEMALE:YOU COME DOWN HERE NO, NO.
LEADMALE:AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT HERE, AND THEN JUST PRACTICE THROWING THE BOUQUET.

LEADMALE:"I WANT TO CATCH IT!" ROSEANNE, WE'RE NOT GETTING MARRIED.
SUPFEMALE:I MEAN, WE ARE, BUT NOT JUST THIS SECOND.
OTHERMALE:WHAT HAPPENED? NOTHING.
LEADMALE:WE JUST DECIDED WE NEEDED TO TALK ABOUT IT SOME MORE.
OTHERMALE:NOW I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE MY WEDDING.
LEADFEMALE:ROSEANNE, YOU'RE MARRIED.
LEADFEMALE:THIS IS ABOUT ME.
LEADMALE:OH, BUMMER.
LEADFEMALE:SEE, WHAT HAPPENED WAS, YOU KNOW, HE PROPOSED, AND THEN I JUST SAID ALL RIGHT.
OTHERMALE:WHICH WASN'T A DEFINITE YES.

LEADMALE:WELL, WHAT'D YOU SAY? HOW DID YOU HANDLE IT? I THINK I HANDLED IT REALLY WELL.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT DID YOU SAY? I JUST WAS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND VERY ADULT.
LEADFEMALE:AND I SAID THAT I THOUGHT WE SHOULD TAKE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, HOW COME YOU'RE ASSERTIVE NOW? BASICALLY, WE DECIDED THAT WE WOULD GO STEADY.
LEADFEMALE:AND THEN, IF THAT WENT WELL, WE WOULD GET ENGAGED, AND THEN EVENTUALLY WE WOULD DO WHAT YOU AND DAN DID.
LEADMALE:WELL, JUST SAY IT, JACKIE.
SUPMALE:SAY, "ME AND GARY ARE GONNA GET MARRIED.
LEADMALE:" WELLWE MIGHT.
LEADMALE:
