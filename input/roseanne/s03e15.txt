SUPMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:The guy pays.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but I asked him out.
LEADMALE:So? The rule is, the guy still pays.
LEADFEMALE:Who made up that rule? Some cheap hungry woman.
LEADMALE:What do I look like, Becky, your slave? So I was late.
SUPMALE:Two hours! And it's your room! You think I'll spend my day off painting it by myself? So what are you going to wear? You ought to wear that burgundy pullover.

LEADMALE:That skirt is so short.
OTHERFEMALE:But you have great legs.
SUPMALE:Wear your hair down, too, 'cause it'll hide your neck.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with my neck? Make sure you order dessert.
OTHERFEMALE:I was reading in Cosmo where it says a healthy appetite is considered to be sexy nowadays.

LEADFEMALE:I didn't! Like I was the one who drew the heart around Fernando's head.
SUPMALE:Heavy Menudo denial, Beck.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, just toss it, ok? So What color is this room going to be? Let's paint big, black bars on the walls.
LEADMALE:It feels like a jail cell, it might as well look like one.
SUPMALE:Come on, Becky.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Then why do this? You don't have to! One minute you want to paint the room, then you don't care.
