LEADFEMALE:1 Mother, remember when you told d.j. If he got the bathroom disgusting, he'd have to clean it? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's been spotless ever since.
LEADMALE:That's because the slob's been using our bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Is that why I keep yanking those huge wads of hair out of the drain? One was in so deep, I used your toothbrush to get it out.
LEADMALE:Eeeww! Hey, pig, quit washing your hair in our sink.
SUPFEMALE:It's not my hair.
LEADFEMALE:Then whose is it? Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:It's dead.
OTHERMALE:I'm moving.
LEADMALE:Of all the people in the world to have as a role model, our kid picks Eddie Munster.
LEADMALE:You thought having a son would be great.
LEADMALE:Well, it would have.
LEADMALE:I'm going down to the Lobo.
LEADFEMALE:I'm meeting Davey.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to work up a bid for that Hanover development.
SUPMALE:You won't be too late, right? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Darlene, beat it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you remember what day it is? It's Wednesday.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be back.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be here With bells on.
LEADMALE:Don't you want to know how many? Surprise me.
LEADMALE:Grrr! Grrr! Don't come back all bloated.
LEADMALE:Aha! A hair that isn't his.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's mine.
LEADMALE:Whew! Good.
SUPMALE:Anyone seen dad this morning? There's a note on the counter.
OTHERMALE:Hey! Hey.
SUPMALE:Geez.
LEADMALE:Mom, is everything ok? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:There's more orange juice in the fridge.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, ma, can I have 5 bucks for no good reason? It's in my purse.
LEADFEMALE:Something's definitely wrong.
LEADMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:I should have gone for 10.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you got any detergent? Yes, I have detergent.
SUPMALE:I have no marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:So where's the detergent? Jackie, I'm serious.
LEADMALE:What did Dan do now? It's what he didn't do in the bedroom last night.
LEADMALE:Well, one night.
LEADFEMALE:Wednesday night.
SUPFEMALE:The night.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
SUPMALE:You guys have a night? Yes, we have a night.
LEADMALE:It's not only Wednesday, but it's always Wednesday.
LEADFEMALE:You got a time, too? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:20 minutes or until he gets a cramp.
LEADMALE:You should make him wait half an hour after he eats.
LEADFEMALE:This has been working for 17 years.
LEADMALE:Last night, he comes crawling in at 3:00 in the morning.
SUPMALE:Today I get a note without saying he's sorry.
LEADMALE:So he missed one Wednesday.
LEADFEMALE:Two Wednesdays.
LEADMALE:Ok, two Wednesdays.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Around 14, you get numb.
SUPMALE:Hey, I'm not talking about sexual frustration.
LEADMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:I think Dan's having an affair, Jackie.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Dan? Why, you think he's ugly? You think he's stupid? You don't think women want to sleep with him? I think there's millions of women who would sleep with Dan.
LEADMALE:Who? Tell me! You're really serious.
LEADMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:He comes in late, he's totally preoccupied, and then he's laying there in bed making all these little happy noises.
SUPFEMALE:If we're not having Wednesday, what's he so happy about? Just 'cause you guys aren't having Wednesday doesn't mean that he's out Wednesday-ing somebody else.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't this what a man does before he walks out? What are you asking me for? Ok, we'll go down the checklist.
LEADFEMALE:What's the first thing he does when he comes in? He goes to the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? Nothing.
LEADMALE:It was no-nothing.
LEADFEMALE:That was a noise, like a check mark kind of a noise.
LEADMALE:I just meant that if you want to be suspicious, he could be washing up so you don't smell any perfume.
LEADMALE:I've been smelling Dan as often as I can.
OTHERFEMALE:And? He smells like smoke.
LEADFEMALE:He says he's going to the Lobo.
LEADFEMALE:It smells like smoke down there.
LEADMALE:He can have the kids, but I'm keeping the house! Now, come on, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:This is Dan we're talking about.
LEADMALE:You owe him a little trust.
SUPMALE:Just give him another chance.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:What's the worst that can happen? Mmm Mmm Ooh Ooh, HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh Dan! Shh! It's my wife.
LEADFEMALE:Wake up! What? What were you doing? Sleeping.
SUPMALE:With who? I don't know what you're talking about.
LEADMALE:Who is she, Dan? Who's who? Are you cheating on me? Where'd you get that from? From laying there watching you slobber over your pillow.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder who you're slobbering all over.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody.
LEADMALE:Nobody? Then who is mmm Mmm? All right, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I've been having a dream about You know, sex.
OTHERFEMALE:But I'm not cheating on you.
LEADMALE:It's just a dream? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Are you dreaming about us? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? I don't believe you.
LEADMALE:You come in late, crawl in my bed, and dream about other women.
OTHERMALE:It's not lots of other women.
LEADMALE:It's just one woman.
SUPFEMALE:That did not help me.
OTHERFEMALE:The same woman every time? At least I'm faithful.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne! Roseanne, I'm dreaming, not cheating.
LEADFEMALE:You're dreaming about cheating.
LEADMALE:I can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:Who is she, one of those women in your magazines? You think I'd go for that? It's a redhead at the hardware store in the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Dan! Rosie I don't even know her.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know why I'm dreaming about her.
LEADFEMALE:I just am.
LEADMALE:I can't help it.
SUPFEMALE:It's late.
OTHERFEMALE:We're both tired.
SUPFEMALE:Let's talk about this tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh, you can't wait to get back to sleep, can you? Well, you're hitting the couch, buddy! Roseanne.
SUPMALE:And take your little tramp with you! Aw, come on, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:It didn't mean anything.
LEADFEMALE:What if I had dreams every night about the same guy and we were going at it like sex maniacs? I'd say take lots of naps.
SUPFEMALE:You love the gutter, don't you? No, Roseanne, Jackie's right.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's just normal and healthy.
LEADMALE:Why, I, too, have dreams of a carnal nature.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not ashamed to say that they are often volcanic in their intensity.
LEADMALE:Are they about the same guy every time? Usually.
LEADMALE:Who? Oh, never you mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Pat Sajak.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god! And you will be surprised to know that he's a very tender lover with a virile and wiry little body.
LEADMALE:We don't have the hours to deal with your many problems, Crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Can we just deal with my problems now? So anyway, you're saying that you never, ever have these dreams? Yeah, but my dreams are always about Dan.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's so romantic.
LEADMALE:Of course he looks like Sean Connery, you know, and he has that accent, but I know it's Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:You're such a hypocrite.
SUPFEMALE:You can dream about Sean Connery, but Dan can't dream about some cute little redhead? I said it's not Sean Connery! Hey, Roseanne, cup of coffee.
LEADMALE:We're trying to have a private conversation here, Carl.
LEADFEMALE:What did I say? I said, "cup of coffee.
LEADMALE:" I got a mall to protect.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not here to yak about bikini wax, though I've given a few in my time.
LEADFEMALE:One coffee to go! Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends? Yes.
LEADMALE:That's my sister Jackie and my girlfriend Crystal.
LEADMALE:Crystal, Jackie, this is Carl.
LEADFEMALE:He's a big loser.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like cream, Carl? Yes, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, are you the sister who's a cop? Yeah, but I'm off the force.
OTHERMALE:Got hurt in the line of duty.
LEADMALE:Really? That's great.
OTHERMALE:God, I hope to get hurt someday.
OTHERFEMALE:You like guns? I got some beauties at home.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we can get together and kill something.
LEADMALE:What? What's good for you Friday, Saturday? Never.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, good.
LEADMALE:We'll leave it open.
LEADFEMALE:Well, see you, ladies.
LEADMALE:Um, Carl.
LEADFEMALE:Don't call him back here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? You say you know everyone in the mall.
LEADMALE:It's my job, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's this woman I know her.
OTHERMALE:She works at Fillmore's hardware store, a little redhead.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, just let it drop.
