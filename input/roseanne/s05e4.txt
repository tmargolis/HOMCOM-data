LEADMALE:And we're all getting our own plates this time.
LEADFEMALE:It's so important to me to see you girls happy.

LEADMALE:Work with me here.
SUPFEMALE:She is just trying to butter us up, Roseanne, So that she can move to Lanford and we can't say a thing about it.
OTHERMALE:Who's moving here? Dan No! Dan No, Roseanne, no! Oh, come on! Dan, she needs to be near her family now.
LEADMALE:No, she doesn't.
LEADFEMALE:She may think she does right now, But after 2 months and I have to kill her, she'll realize how wrong she was! She knew we would all feel this way, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:That's why she's waving this money around! Yeah! What money? It's from mom.
LEADFEMALE:Yubba.
SUPMALE:She's just trying to buy us, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you see that? Yeah, I think she hit my price.
LEADMALE:Actually, she could've had me for half.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne! Honey, honey, she's your mother, I'll do whatever it takes, but I just want you to know one thing-I want this money.
LEADMALE:Would you give me that check? You are drooling the zeroes off of it.
LEADMALE:Why do you do all that? It's a lot of responsibility, being a woman.
SUPMALE:God made us the bearer of children, We keep the human race going, And it's all very drying to the skin.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it hardly seems worth it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Darlene, if you're old enough to have a boyfriend, You're old enough to start a beauty ritual.
OTHERMALE:After all, skin is a gift.
SUPFEMALE:I'll remember that.
SUPFEMALE:Did your mother tell you I'm thinking of moving to Lanford? Really? Will you be moving before my birthday? I mean, it's my 16th, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty big.
OTHERMALE:My, that is an important year.
SUPFEMALE:I'm saving up to buy a cd player.
OTHERFEMALE:Sort of a birthday gift to myself.
LEADMALE:A cd player sounds fun.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say you let your grandma Buy it for you a little bit early? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't let you do that.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, they're too They're too expensive-the good ones, anyhow.
LEADFEMALE:Nonsense.
OTHERMALE:And if you like, we can just keep it Between you and me.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes it's good for us girls To have a little secret.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Hey! Hey, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:hey, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, I have got "loose meat.
SUPFEMALE:" I got 2 words for you too.
SUPMALE:No, it's this great idea I got.
LEADMALE:See, every time I make a run through iowa, I stop at this incredible little diner That sells loose meat sandwiches.
LEADMALE:It's kind of like sloppy joes, but without the slop.
SUPMALE:And anyway, the place is always packed, so I'm thinking Maybe we could pool our money and open up a place like that in Lanford And be like partners.
LEADFEMALE:good morning, Jackie.
SUPMALE:You didn't tell me mom was here.
SUPMALE:Jackie, mom's here.
SUPMALE:Morning, mom.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk about it later.
LEADMALE:No, please, go on.
LEADFEMALE:I always love to hear your little ideas.
LEADMALE:Yeah, so you can criticize them.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not true.
LEADMALE:I think it's wonderful that you have ideas.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't keep having ideas, how are you ever going to come up with a good one? This is a good one.
SUPFEMALE:I have a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't the two of you shut up? Well, I'm sorry, but your sister should know better.
OTHERFEMALE:Starting a business these days is insane! Didn't she learn anything from Dan's little bike shop fiasco? Mom, what part of "shut up" Do you not understand? Well, I can't stand by and let her encourage you To waste my money on one of her foolish ideas.
LEADMALE:Oh, stupid me.
LEADMALE:I thought the money was a gift.
SUPFEMALE:Skin is a gift.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be out in the car.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
OTHERMALE:Where are you going? Nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we're just going to do a little early birthday shopping.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Darlene, what are you trying to weasel out of your grandma? Nothing but love.
LEADMALE:Bull.
LEADFEMALE:And a cd player.
OTHERMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:What, so you get $10,000 and I get nothing? Well, you know what they say, Darlene-Wealth always skips a generation.
LEADMALE:Out.
LEADFEMALE:No cd player, mom.
LEADFEMALE:How many times have we had this conversation? I told you I want you to stop spoiling the kids.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't doing anything wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then why were you trying to do it behind my back? Because you force us to do things that way, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:No one can do anything in this house without you interfering.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's because it's my house.
LEADMALE:I like it this way.
SUPFEMALE:I like the kids poor.
LEADMALE:That way they don't clash with the furniture.
SUPMALE:For god's sake, why deprive the child Just because you're struggling? Learn from your mistakes.
LEADFEMALE:What is that supposed to mean? Well, maybe if you'd have been a little more concerned About Becky's happiness, she'd still be here.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Take your check back.
OTHERMALE:Jackie's right.
OTHERMALE:It's never gonna work with you moving here, 'cause it'll always be like this.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't I just leave now? Fine! See you at thanksgiving! What'd you invite her to thanksgiving for? Can I come in? It's your house.
LEADMALE:You can do whatever you like.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is Hard for me to say.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
SUPFEMALE:You'll feel better.
SUPFEMALE:I want the check back.
LEADFEMALE:Pardon me? Well, you gave it to us 'cause we needed it, And we still need it.
OTHERMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:I told you it was yours.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like I don't appreciate it or nothing.
LEADMALE:Well, you have a frightening way of showing it.
LEADFEMALE:I've never felt so unwelcome here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure you have.
LEADMALE:What are you gonna do now? Oh, I suppose I'll go back to moline And rent a little apartment.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe I'll buy some new furniture, And then I'll just sit in a room until it's time to lie in a box.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least you have a plan.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'll get one of those life alert things so I'll have someone to talk to.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, mom.
LEADMALE:Don't do this.
SUPMALE:Now, would you please get Dan to help me with these bags? Come on, mom.
LEADFEMALE:We all got mad and said stuff that we didn't mean.
LEADFEMALE:Now, put the bags down and we'll talk.
LEADFEMALE:oh, Roseanne! Get in here, Jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, we both know we can't leave it like this.
LEADMALE:Mom, maybe you could move here to Lanford If we would just agree on some stuff first.
SUPMALE:I'm listening.
LEADMALE:All right, well, first of all-You can't leave your house.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, What I say goes around here.
LEADFEMALE:And no more of this secret present crap either.
LEADMALE:And I do not want to hear one more word about How we screwed up with the shop or how we screwed up with Becky.
SUPMALE:And I want you to respect the fact that I'm an adult And I can make my own decisions.
OTHERFEMALE:And there are certain things that I don't want to hear anymore, Like "flaky," "skinny," "die a spinster.
LEADMALE:" That's just for mom, right? Jackie, I only tell you these things Because I want to see you do something With your life before it's too late.
SUPMALE:Call us when you get home, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I can't say anything to you girls, can I? Now you're getting it! What, is that what you really want? No, but if you're gonna move here, It's just like, we have to make a lot of changes, you know? We'll have to get used to it.
SUPFEMALE:We'll have to change And you'll have to change.
LEADMALE:But right now, let's start with you.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:What do you have in mind? Well, maybe it would work If we just try being friends.
LEADFEMALE:We are friends.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, we're not.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't she cute? No, see, friends Are not judgmental, and there's camaraderie, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Friends don't drive you into therapy.
LEADFEMALE:Therapy? Who's in therapy? Roseanne Not important.
OTHERMALE:So, how do you feel, mom? All right.
SUPMALE:I'll be friends.
SUPFEMALE:If I'm wanted.
LEADMALE:Jackie Okay, friends.
SUPFEMALE:All right, well, now let's go downstairs and practice being friends.
LEADMALE:Not mothers and daughters, but friends.
LEADFEMALE:Not too weird.
LEADMALE:All right, this could be fun.
LEADFEMALE:And, you know, as your friend, I just want to tell you you're treating your mother very badly.
LEADFEMALE:Here's one.
LEADFEMALE:Large patio, and it's very reasonable.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jackie, isn't that your block? No.
LEADFEMALE:That'd be great.
LEADMALE:You and mom could be neighbors.
SUPMALE:No, you don't want that apartment, mom.
OTHERMALE:I know that building.
SUPFEMALE:Bad snake problem.
LEADFEMALE:"snake problem"? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Big ones.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, didn't I see a "for rent" sign, though, Out front of the bowman house next door? Oh, yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, I just hope they've hosed all the blood off the walls.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:You girls just keep fighting over me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, your boyfriend's here!
SUPFEMALE:
