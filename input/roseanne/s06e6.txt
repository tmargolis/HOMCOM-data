LEADMALE:What's that? Dead guy.
LEADMALE:Nancy, this is an eating establishment.
LEADFEMALE:Are you crazy? You can't tie up a whole table for four.
OTHERMALE:He doesn't look very realistic.
LEADFEMALE:Next year i'm springing for a real dead guy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he looks pretty good to me, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:He looks like he died in his sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:Give me that knife.
OTHERMALE:Yes, here at the lunch box, The customer is always right.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, wait.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not Leon.
LEADMALE:Well Spiders, blood, corpses.
LEADMALE:You know, charmed as I am by all your accoutrement, I still feel the need to remove the fake vomit.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's wet.
LEADMALE:Well, that plastic stuff never fools anybody.
LEADMALE:You mean this is-No.
LEADMALE:We just doctored up some of the loose meat.
SUPMALE:What did you do to it to make it look like that? Surprisingly little.
SUPFEMALE:Have you decided what you're wearing to dan's lodge party? Well, we were thinkin' that you and me and Dan and Roseanne Would go as the cleaver family.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, look at this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm beaver cleaver.
LEADFEMALE:And Dan gets to be June cleaver, And you can be ward, and I get to be wally.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, you guys.
LEADMALE:I kinda already had something else in mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god, you're not going to shave your head And go as that stop-the-insanity woman again, are you? No, but I don't think I should Spend the whole evening with you guys.
LEADMALE:I don't think Dan would have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? I don't think Dan likes me very much.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course he does.
LEADMALE:Look, i'm very sensitive to these things.
SUPMALE:I know when someone doesn't like me.
SUPFEMALE:Does it look something like this? When I tell Dan that you said that, He is going to come over here And set everything straight.
LEADFEMALE:He's going to hug you so hard That you're going to be leaking silicone for days.
LEADMALE:Then you think he really does like me? Yes, already.
SUPMALE:Everybody likes you.
SUPMALE:God, you're so annoying.
LEADMALE:Lunch box.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Darlene.
SUPMALE:Hey, if this is about you not coming home for Halloween, You better have a damn good excuse.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I was in a horrible accident, And i'm just a head.
SUPMALE:And? Something came up.
SUPFEMALE:There's this Halloween party here, And the thing is this guy asked me to go with him, And i'm thinking about going.
SUPMALE:This isn't like a date or nothin' is it? No, it's no big deal.
SUPMALE:Just please don't tell David.
SUPFEMALE:Well, gee, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:It'll be like our little secret, ok? Ok, fine, i'll do this for you, But you remember us when i'm about 80 And I need help getting your dad into his truss.
SUPMALE:Hey, mom, thanks for being there.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, it was my shift.
LEADMALE:Ok, bye.
SUPMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:I cannot believe what Darlene just told me.
LEADMALE:She's cheating on David.
LEADFEMALE:I never thought this would happen.
SUPFEMALE:We're like girlfriends.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least the waiting is over, And I survived my annual Roseanne prank.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine the shock When I sat down at my desk, only to discover-Ooh, oogie, boogie, woogie, boogie, boogie.
OTHERFEMALE:frankly, Roseanne, I'm disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? Ah, that's my pranks, dirty tricks, And flat-out mean stuff I plan to do to my loved ones list.
SUPMALE:Let's see--David, David, David.
LEADMALE:Aha.
LEADMALE:Well, you may want to wear a helmet to bed.
OTHERMALE:Have you figured out what your costume's gonna be For the lodge party? I'm not going.
SUPMALE:I mean, if Darlene were gonna be here, I'd give it a try But she called and said that she has to Study for a test on Halloween night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, that's school for you.
SUPFEMALE:It's either a test or something else.
SUPFEMALE:So i'm not gonna do anything.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but, David, You can't not do anything.
LEADFEMALE:This is Halloween.
LEADFEMALE:It's the one night a year Where you're supposed to break all the rules.
SUPMALE:And you're a conner now.
LEADFEMALE:I just cannot allow you to sit here at home And be good and nice and well-behaved.
OTHERMALE:People will begin to talk.
SUPMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm home.
OTHERFEMALE:Grr.
OTHERMALE:Ow! I told you to get salted crackers.
LEADMALE:David: i'll be outside.
SUPMALE:Ow! Well, what have we here, my pet, Your little prank list? Yes, but you shall never see it.
SUPMALE:I'm putting it in the vault.
SUPFEMALE:I'm coming in after it.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha ho.
LEADFEMALE:Gimme, gimme! Dan? Yes? You should have been at the diner today.
LEADFEMALE:The weirdest thing happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Like, right out of the blue, Nancy comes up with this thing where She thinks that you don't like her.
LEADMALE:You do so! I'm sorry, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:She's the most superficial person I've ever met.
SUPFEMALE:But that's just her facade.
LEADMALE:She's rude and selfish.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but inside she's just a scared little girl.
SUPMALE:And I know who's scaring her-A raging bitch on the outside.
LEADMALE:That is no fair, Dan.
LEADMALE:You know all your dumb, stupid, idiot friends that I hate? I like them.
LEADMALE:Hey, Roseanne, I pretend to like Nancy.
OTHERMALE:Well, then you suck at it, 'cause she's onto you.
OTHERMALE:Nancy's aware of other people? You're gonna go in there tomorrow, Dan, And you're gonna tell her that you like her, And then you're gonna give her a great big old hug.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, I'd just have to come home And peel off all my skin.
SUPMALE:I'm serious, Dan.
OTHERMALE:You've got to do it.
LEADMALE:Or else it's gonna be two hugs And a nice little poem.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i'm not gonna tell her I like her Because I don't like her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I know, But that's why you have to go down there And tell her that you like her.
SUPFEMALE:You never tell people that you like that you like them.
SUPMALE:The only people that you ever tell that you like Are the people you actually don't like.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, i'll do it.
LEADMALE:Really? Course not.
SUPFEMALE:The only things you have to say you're gonna do Are things you have no intention of doing.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, Dan said that all Nancy ever talks about Is herself.
SUPMALE:Well, Roseanne, it is kind of true.
LEADFEMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPFEMALE:What else does she talk about? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I never listen to her.
LEADMALE:I just saw the saddest thing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what is it, Nance? See that old lady over there? The bent gray one? I see her.
LEADMALE:I have that same dress.
LEADFEMALE:What was I thinking? I hate it when dan's right.
SUPFEMALE:So what did Dan think about all of us Going as the cleaver family? Oh, he thought it was really cool.
OTHERMALE:And he thought of a way to make it funnier, too.
LEADMALE:It seems as though June, ok, is so mangled That it's take ward, wally, and the beaver To carry what's left of her around in a mason jar.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:If Dan is going as June, That means he's not part of the group.
LEADMALE:I was right.
OTHERFEMALE:He hates me.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not true, Nance.
LEADFEMALE:No, he likes you, Nancy.
LEADFEMALE:It's just, you know, He's not that comfortable in high heels.
SUPFEMALE:Look, if the two of you can't be honest with me about it, Maybe you don't like me, either.
LEADFEMALE:No, we like you, Nancy.
LEADMALE:I mean, maybe not right now, But, you know, other times.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you hate me so much, Maybe I shouldn't work here anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Leon's been wanting to buy my share.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I should just sell.
SUPMALE:Gotcha.
LEADFEMALE:AhHa ha ha.
LEADFEMALE:The whole thing's a prank me and sis here worked up To make you think that us and Dan don't like you.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha ha.
LEADMALE:Boo! So Dan does like me, And he's going to come here and hug me? Oh, wellI mean he--he wants to, But i'm just too jealous to let him, you know.
LEADFEMALE:So, instead he's going to pull, Like, this great all-time prank on you.
LEADMALE:On me, really? Oh, oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Huge.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll be huge.
LEADFEMALE:Really embarrassing, too.
