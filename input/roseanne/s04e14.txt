LEADMALE:Damn.
SUPMALE:This lane is definitely warped.
LEADMALE:Dan now you're hooking the ball.
LEADMALE:You gotta take some spin off.
SUPFEMALE:I know exactly how much spin I need, Arnie.
SUPFEMALE:The spin's related to how much wax on the alleys.
LEADFEMALE:It's a matter of physics.
SUPMALE:Jeez! Oh, I think you forgot to account for the curvature of the Earth.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going for a beer.
LEADMALE:How else wants one? You'll get bloated and bowl like a duck.
LEADMALE:My average is five points higher than yours, man.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying I'm the reason we're in last place in the league? Well, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:What about the other two guys? They say it, too.
SUPFEMALE:How can two grownups argue over nothing? Well, you're new to this marriage business.
LEADFEMALE:You'll catch on.
SUPMALE:How's married life treating you? It's o.
SUPFEMALE:k.
SUPMALE:My parents came over for dinner last weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Everything was going fine until dessert when Arnie asked my mom if she cut one.
LEADMALE:Men.
SUPFEMALE:If they have to ask, You know it's them.
LEADFEMALE:Ohman, my back is not good.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to skip it.
LEADMALE:Just put me down for a spare.
SUPFEMALE:I'm putting myself down, too.
LEADMALE:Mom, I need more quarters for the video games.
SUPFEMALE:Just take it out of your allowance.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't want to come here! You made me! You begged me.
SUPFEMALE:Did, too! Did not! Mom! All right.
SUPMALE:That is it! It's quality time.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Deej, how's my best buddy in the whole world? O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:Run along now, son.
LEADMALE:Boy, that's a cute kid.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:No more beer for Arnie.
OTHERMALE:Kind of makes you think, don't it, Nancy? Tick, tick, tick, tick.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:A spare.
SUPMALE:Very good.
LEADMALE:Well, I learned everything I know from you, honey.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you give yourself a strike? 'Cause the lane's warped.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm up.
LEADFEMALE:What's all this tick, tick, tick stuff? Arnie's on my back to have a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe one of these days, he'll get it right.
LEADFEMALE:I hope not.
SUPMALE:I don't want to walk around with a bowling ball in my belly for nine months.
SUPFEMALE:You also got to carry around two of them in your bra for a year and a half.
SUPMALE:Between the gutters, Arnie.
LEADMALE:Between the gutters, huh? Funny, Frank.
SUPMALE:He's just trying to psych you out.
LEADMALE:What was that all about? His team's in 9th place, we're in 10th, So he thinks he's better than us.
LEADFEMALE:Calm down.
LEADMALE:Wait till saturday night.
LEADFEMALE:We'll show him who's worse.
SUPMALE:God, what difference does it make? Oh, they have some really intelligent league tradition that the last-place guys have to drink beer out of their bowling shoes.
OTHERFEMALE:Yecchh.
LEADFEMALE:Really, it didn't taste that bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hey, you guys.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What are you guys doing here? I'm playing back there in the bar this weekend.
SUPFEMALE:We're checking out the room.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have to go see you.
SUPFEMALE:Is there a cover charge? Not for my personal friends.
SUPFEMALE:Or anybody else.
LEADFEMALE:It would be great if you guys could be there.
SUPFEMALE:We could all take turns requesting Harper valley PTA.
SUPMALE:I think I need a new groupie here.
LEADMALE:See you guys later.
LEADMALE:Yeah, saturday night.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Rosie, you're up.
LEADMALE:What do you want us to put this frame? I'm really going to go for it this time.

LEADFEMALE:Knock them down.
LEADMALE:I certainly will.
LEADMALE:I'm going to kill them.
LEADMALE:There will be nothing left but dust.
SUPMALE:I plan to completely pulverize them With my pretty pink ball.
LEADMALE:She gets a good arc.
LEADFEMALE:What did I get this time? I'm giving you another spare.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm being really consistent.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe this, Mark is an hour and a half late.
OTHERMALE:Where in the hell is he? Well, it's pretty dark out.
LEADMALE:I mean, maybe he thinks he's asleep.
LEADMALE:Mother, shut her up.
LEADMALE:At least wait until your sister's out of the room.
LEADFEMALE:God, I'm not just going to sit around and wait for him.
SUPMALE:Who does he think he is? Don't, Darlene.
LEADMALE:Dan, are you going to read us the funny parts? This guy's paying me to service his snowmobiles.
OTHERFEMALE:I figure I should know what one looks like.
OTHERMALE:You said it was like a motorcycle on skis.
OTHERFEMALE:Apparently I lied.
LEADMALE:You can do it, right? If I don't have to do drywall, I can do anything.
LEADMALE:Ah-choo! Why don't you just vomit on my plate? Come here, you.
LEADMALE:You know, you've been sneezing all day.
SUPFEMALE:Let me feel your head here.
LEADMALE:I'm o.

OTHERMALE:No, I won't.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're going to stay home.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Darlene, can you sit with him? No, I'm going out.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? You never go out.

LEADMALE:What are you looking for? Just my old ice skates.
OTHERMALE:I'm giving them to Nancy.
LEADFEMALE:We're going ice-skating on tuesday.
LEADFEMALE:Like, you're all chummy with her after you had some affair with her husband? That was not an affair, That was a one-night mistake.
LEADFEMALE:And they weren't even engaged at the time.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, she and I talked it through, and everything's fine between us.
LEADMALE:How come Jackie and Nancy are going out and having some great time, and they don't even think to invite me? What does it matter, dear? Because she's my friend, and she's my sister.
LEADFEMALE:They're going to plan to have some great time together, and they're not even thinking to invite me.
SUPMALE:If it wasn't for me, they wouldn't even know each other.
LEADMALE:There is the whole sordid Arnie connection, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, yeah, right.
OTHERFEMALE:Like they're getting together to some little "I slept with Arnie" fan club that I can't even be a member of.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean.
LEADFEMALE:Smoke blowin' down from a cabin on the hill Smoke blowin' down in the street Some kind of sweet-smellin' mystical backdrop To the story unfoldin' at my feet Used to walk around With my eyes on fire My nerves real close to my skin Shut the door! I had a fist full of questions And a brand on my cheek And we would Skate where the ice got thin Whoo! Oh, whoa! Thank you.
LEADMALE:All right! Yeah! I'd like to introduce the band.
LEADMALE:Hank, Pete That's Jackie, that's Nancy, that's Roseanne, And you know Bonnie, right? You girls got any requests? How about doing the dishes? I don't know that one.
LEADMALE:How about a nice romantic dinner? I'm so hungry.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Band's going out for a chili dog.
SUPMALE:We'll return in five minutes.
LEADFEMALE:He's good.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell him that.
SUPMALE:He'll want to go on the road, and that's no good.
LEADMALE:All those beautiful young girls Bouncing up and down saying, "Get off the stage, grandpa.
OTHERFEMALE:" I love him way too much to let that happen.
LEADMALE:Ohh.

OTHERMALE:You know I'm totally devoted to turning Arnie into something I can live with.
LEADMALE:But that doesn't mean I can't look.

SUPMALE:You still look, don't you? After you get a few kids, every time you look at a man, all's you see is more kids.
SUPMALE:See? That's exactly what we were talking about.

OTHERFEMALE:I know, but I already made up my mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not rushing into anything.
OTHERMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:You were talking to Jackie about kids? Is that wrong? WellJackie doesn't even have any kids.

SUPMALE:You're sure you're o.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:? I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we weren't really talking about having kids.
LEADFEMALE:we were talking about our careers and how kids would get in the way right now.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, then that's cool, talking to Jackie about careers.
LEADMALE:I mean, after all, she has had more than anybody else in the world.
LEADFEMALE:You're mad at me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not mad.
LEADFEMALE:I know the difference between when you're really mad and when you're just being yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I am not mad.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not looking at me.
SUPMALE:See? When she doesn't make eye contact, that means she's mad.
LEADMALE:I am looking at you.
SUPFEMALE:See? Ouch.
