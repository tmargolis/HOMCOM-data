OTHERMALE:Hey, busboy, where've you been? If I wanted to cook and clean and serve, I'd stay home.
SUPMALE:I was talking with my friends.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I don't want those hoodlums hangin' around here.
LEADMALE:They're scaring away the truckers.
LEADMALE:I hate it here.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just fire me? Because you're a tiny, little man and we're still hoping you might be magical.
LEADMALE:You know, Roseanne, if he doesn't want to be here, we should just let him go.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want him hanging out with those hoodlums he's made friends with.
OTHERFEMALE:I figured if they see him in the apron they'll go back to wantin' to beat him up.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that makes the third bucket of lard that I have cleaned out of this grease trap.
LEADFEMALE:I swear to God, Roseanne, it's like cleaning out one of your arteries.
LEADFEMALE:Bitch, bitch, bitch, that's all you ever are.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, I just don't understand how this thing can collect that much grease so fast.
LEADMALE:Would you shut up about that thing? We all take our own turn cleaning it out, you know? I haven't cleaned that grease trap out in over a year.
LEADMALE:Neither have I.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, that little boy just left this note on my napkin.
LEADFEMALE:"The big, scary one spits in the food.
OTHERFEMALE:" d.j. ! I think you should apologize to the woman.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm real sorry my mom does that to your food.
LEADMALE:Nice try, d.j. , but I'm still not gonna fire you.
LEADFEMALE:And the joke is on you because I do spit in the food.
OTHERMALE:Ugh, that grease trap is unspeakable.
LEADFEMALE:I have not felt this filthy since my last confession.
SUPFEMALE:You know, you're the only one who cleans that.
SUPMALE:Hey, d.j. , break time.
SUPFEMALE:What? What did the boy say? I said you're the only one who-Don't listen to him.
SUPFEMALE:He's a hopeless alcoholic.
SUPFEMALE:My God, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:This is the lowest thing you've ever done.
LEADMALE:No, it's not.
LEADMALE:You know the tip jar-That's it, d.j. , you're fired.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Mom! Your black skirt with the really long slit in it? I--I don't think that's too revealing.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, I'll come over at 7:00 and we'll walk over together.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Don't forget, city's got a leash law.
SUPMALE:That was no dog.
SUPFEMALE:That was Diana-What the hell's she going out with you for? Because I'm cute.
LEADFEMALE:You are not.
SUPMALE:I am so.
OTHERFEMALE:Ever since I broke up with Darlene and became all miserable, tons of girls have been flirting with me.
LEADFEMALE:They say I have the sad, sensitive thing going.
LEADMALE:Yeah? They can feel sorry for you when they're nailing real guys.
LEADMALE:Actually, I'm jealous of you, Mark.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I'll have to sleep with dozens of women, sometimes two at a time, while you have the security of sleeping with the same woman every night till the day you die.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you're laughing, 'cause I was worried that you'd be all bummed out about Darlene moving in with that Jimmy guy she's been seeing.
LEADFEMALE:You're lying.
LEADMALE:Wait, Becky didn't tell you about that one? Oops.
LEADMALE:They hardly know each other.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, seeing each other naked every day ought to change that.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? Those girls are right.
LEADMALE:You are cute when you're miserable.
LEADMALE:George, that's Mark.
OTHERFEMALE:Mark, scram.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:I still can't believe you got me tickets to Wrestlemania, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Thank you so much.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I really don't know how to thank you enough other than saying "thank you" like I just did right now.
LEADMALE:Yeah, okay, here's the thing.
SUPFEMALE:Yours is free, but for reasons that you're too young to understand, you need to sell d.j. his ticket for 20 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where's d.j. gonna get $20? Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I guess he'll just have to get a job.
LEADMALE:You should mention that to him.
SUPMALE:Well, what if he doesn't wanna go with me? You know, I don't think d.j. likes me very much.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's just 'cause you're really boring, but the tickets will change everything.
OTHERMALE:Hey, d.j. , look who's here.
LEADFEMALE:Get rid of him.
SUPMALE:Now, d.j. , that's not very nice.
LEADFEMALE:George has something to ask you.
OTHERMALE:Okay, go ahead, and keep it short.
SUPFEMALE:Um, d.j. , do you wanna go to Wrestlemania with me? I got these tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Um, now, the thing of it is, you gotta pay me $20.
LEADFEMALE:Or if you don't have a twenty, you could pay me two tens.
LEADMALE:Or a ten and two fives.
SUPFEMALE:Or four fives, which I'd prefer, 'cause you know I'm collecting them.
LEADMALE:You know, 'cause I like Lincoln.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wow, d.j. Tickets to the hottest event in town.
LEADMALE:Too bad you're broke.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not broke.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, I'll get my money.
LEADFEMALE:What? You're not supposed to have any money.
LEADFEMALE:You're unemployed.
LEADMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need your stinkin' job.
SUPMALE:I get an allowance from Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Freeze.
OTHERMALE:I was just gonna get you something to hit me with.
SUPFEMALE:You can't go just givin' him money, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:I want him to learn responsibility by working at the diner.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he's 13 years old.
LEADMALE:He's got plenty of time to learn responsibility.
SUPMALE:That is so wrong, Dan.
SUPMALE:He is at a crossroads of his life where he can either become a total loser or a busboy.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, none of his friends have to work.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they will.
LEADMALE:Them license plates don't just make themselves, you know.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:From now on, no more allowance.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll just tell him we went broke again.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, you gotta get back the money you gave him.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do that.
SUPMALE:He'll hate me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Dan, if he hates you because you take back your money, then he wasn't that good of a friend in the first place, was he? See ya.
LEADMALE:d.j. , wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:I've been thinking, and I've decided it's not right for you to get money without working for it, so I want you to give me your allowance back.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, Dan, that's not fair.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't have it anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:I gave it to George.
LEADFEMALE:Well then, you just have to give me your ticket.
LEADFEMALE:Now.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, d.j. You know, if it was up to me, I'd let you go in a second.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Now it is up to you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, no, Dan.
LEADMALE:Remember? Love, honor and obey? I'm forced to go along with you.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, just this once I think we'll let you be in charge.
SUPMALE:All right, here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good time.
SUPFEMALE:Your dad and I'll just be here waiting for you, alone together with no witnesses.
SUPMALE:Guys, wait up! Hey, Jimmy, here's an interesting thing from psyche class.
LEADFEMALE:Just answer honestly.
SUPMALE:There's no right or wrong.
LEADMALE:Name three things that you like about yourself.
LEADMALE:Well, let's see, um I'd say I'm open-minded, I've got a good body, and, uh I'm a pretty nice guy.
SUPMALE:Fine, if you're not gonna take it seriously.
LEADMALE:Well, it's almost 2:00.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta run.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I got it Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Coffee's on me.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPMALE:I was just getting a piece of gum.

OTHERFEMALE:You know, mother-son type things.
LEADFEMALE:A 13-year-old boy doesn't have much in common with a 42-year-old woman.
LEADMALE:Actually, if he did, we'd be worried.

SUPFEMALE:And the cafeteria and the bowling alley.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing how we just keep bumping into each other.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, listen, uh, I hope we can talk about something other than Darlene this time, because last time I was pretty uncomfortable.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:So how's that whole thing goin'? Stop it.
LEADMALE:What? Look, I went to that peer counseling office.
OTHERMALE:They've never heard of you.

LEADMALE:I know your whole story, man.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I was just desperate.
OTHERMALE:Why'd you have to come on to me if you knew I was straight? What? You think I'm gay? What would make you think I'm gay? Come on, Craig, it was pretty obvious the first time I met you.
LEADMALE:What made it obvious? A lot of things.
LEADMALE:A lot of things like what? Well, for one, you told me you were an artist.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're a ballet dancer, for God's sakes! You ever had your butt kicked by a ballet dancer? What are you doing here? Wait a minute, you do know Craig? This is Craig? The gay guy that's been hitting on you? I am not gay! I want some answers! No, me first.
LEADFEMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, I wanna hear this.
LEADMALE:Sit down! Not you.
LEADFEMALE:Come here! What the hell are you doing here? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:When I heard that you guys might move in together, I felt like I had to do something.
LEADMALE:So you told my boyfriend you were a gay guy named Craig? No, I didn't tell him I was gay, he could just tell.
OTHERMALE:I mean, no.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean.
LEADMALE:David, why are you messing with my life? I just didn't want you to move in with him.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to stop it.
SUPFEMALE:I can't even look at you.
LEADFEMALE:This is, like, the most pathetic thing you've ever done.
OTHERMALE:Is not.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, pal.
LEADMALE:If you weren't after me, why were you trying to break me and my girlfriend up? Well see Wow, who's he? Mm, I'm kinda nervous.
LEADFEMALE:I've never had a job interview before.
LEADMALE:I got all my other jobs when I was just walking by.
LEADFEMALE:So, tell us, Ms.
LEADMALE:Flagler, why The Lunchbox, why a busperson? Well, until my boyfriend's band gets a record deal, he thought I should work, 'cause, you know, he's never had a job before.
LEADMALE:And they say all the good ones are taken.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I'm really lucky.
LEADMALE:He says when he gets famous, he's gonna take care of me.
LEADMALE:Well, that is the good thing about rock stars: they're so loyal.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Ms.
LEADFEMALE:Flagler, this position requires someone with experience.
LEADFEMALE:Have you done anything prior to this in the bussing field? I think I can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Stacey, uh, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner and I always like to discuss the applicant before we reach a decision.
LEADMALE:If you will excuse us for one minute, we will retire to the area that we-like to call-Those cannot be real.
SUPFEMALE:Think about it, Jackie, she'd be really great for business.
SUPMALE:How do you figure? Wake up, Jackie.
LEADMALE:Even I'm gettin' a woody.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:What do you want? Mom, I want my job back.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:I mean, I just hated working at the garage.
LEADMALE:All I did was move heavy boxes, so I quit.
SUPMALE:Well, d.j. , um, I don't know if I can take you back because we've already filled the position.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations, Stacey, you got the job.
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, when does my insurance start? 'Cause I need some shots.
LEADFEMALE:That's not fair; I just quit the garage! Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could use two buspersons around here, but I really don't know if I should hire you back after the way you were acting around here, d.j. I think, at least, you owe me an apology.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me you love me.
SUPMALE:What? Tell me you love me or no job.
LEADMALE:All right, I love you.
LEADMALE:Jeez.
LEADMALE:Great, that's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, welcome back.
SUPMALE:Well, do you think tonight you could go to a movie with me? Yeah, sure.
OTHERMALE:But, you know, d.j. , I don't approve of movies with sex and violence in 'em, so you'll just have to pick one or the other.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You get your job back? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You ask your mom to take you to the movies? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Good work.
LEADMALE:Well, how 'bout at the movie I have to buy some popcorn? Nice touch.
LEADMALE:You know, d.j. , you're really doing a good thing for your mom here.
SUPMALE:One day, you're gonna be really glad you came back.
LEADFEMALE:I'm already glad.
SUPMALE:Did you see the new busboy? ** You know, Stacey, things have sure changed around here ever since you started workin' at The Box.
OTHERMALE:Have they ever! What do you mean? Hello.
LEADMALE:Some sailors told me this was the place to come for a loose meat sandwich.
LEADMALE:My, you're certainly an attractive man.
SUPMALE:Too bad I'm married.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wait, I forgot.
OTHERMALE:I'm a huge slut.
SUPFEMALE:I've always been a nice girl.
LEADFEMALE:I wish someone could teach me to be bad.
LEADFEMALE:Oops I got whipped cream on your shirt.
SUPFEMALE:Let me clean that up for you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And, you know, this belt doesn't really go with these pants.
SUPMALE:Would you like to hear about our three-for-one special? How would you like to get all hot and sweaty and gooey and slippery? Man, don't you guys ever clean this thing?
OTHERFEMALE:
