LEADFEMALE:I think we should think about this.
LEADMALE:Okay, our reporter cindy kenner will ask the questions.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, i'm cindy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, i'm Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Say, could I possibly get A little bit of pellegrino? You could if I knew what the hell that was.

LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Let's start with him here and then her, And then her.
LEADMALE:Okay, here we go, ready.
SUPFEMALE:In three, two, one.
SUPFEMALE:Today we've come to the little town of Lanford To ask some local restaurant people The question that's on everyone's lips This election year.
SUPMALE:Is beef back? Does she have to think of all these questions every single day? When does she find the time to not eat? "is beef back?" Here at the lunch box located on route 9 Just half a mile south of hanging bat caverns We serve beef to our customers.
OTHERFEMALE:So beef is good.
LEADMALE:And remember, Leon recommends lean.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:So is beef back? Well, i'm going to have to agree with Leon That low fat is the way to go, But today there are leaner cuts of beef, So who knows? Maybe someday, Beef won't have any fat at all.
LEADFEMALE:Because the future is now And who knows what that's going to bring? Maybe we won't even have beef or cows Or cars, or we just will wear those jetpack things.
LEADMALE:We'll just fly all over wherever we want to go.
OTHERMALE:And we'll eat food made out of, I don't know, Just old newspapers and air.
LEADMALE:Oh, to be young again.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, andy.
OTHERFEMALE:Mommy's on tv.
LEADMALE:Hi, is beef back? Well, I just wanna say that the only thing I don't like about fat Is that it doesn't have any sugar in it.
LEADMALE:Okay, but doesn't a fatty diet-I mean, won't it make you fat? So? A lot of people are fat, you know.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, I think more american women look like me Than like you, you know? Yeah, but when you watch tv, there's no fat people on or anything.
LEADMALE:When I watch that show "friends" that has all those whiny girls That are nothing but hair and bones, you know? And I watch them and they're drinking Those triple espressos and stuff, And i'm just like, "hey, go for the muffins.
SUPMALE:" It kind of bugs me, you know, because, I feel like, "hey, I eat the same amount of food that they eat.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't puke when i'm done.
SUPMALE:" I must say planning a wedding for you and Darlene Is such a thrill.
OTHERMALE:Of course, my wedding gown Is gonna have to be let out a bit To accommodate her little bun in the oven.
LEADFEMALE:Plus, i'm attaching styrofoam doves To the shoulder pads To draw the eye away from her waistline.
OTHERMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Harris-Don't worry, I haven't forgotten about you.
LEADFEMALE:I've already called veils and tails.
LEADFEMALE:They have plenty of tuxes in your size.
LEADMALE:Why, they fit boys As young as four years old.
