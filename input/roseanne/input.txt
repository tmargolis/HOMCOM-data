SUPMALE:That sounds easy enough.
SUPMALE:Maybe you're on to something here, sis.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, youget out of here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious.
SUPMALE:I'm visualizing a clean house and kids who don't talk back and a husband who waits on me hand and foot.

LEADMALE:Well, did you tell her to stop it? Ms.
OTHERFEMALE:Crane: i did.
OTHERFEMALE:Did she stop it? She stopped.
LEADFEMALE:What's the problem? I feel this barking is an aggressive manifestation of a deeper internal problem.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? Now, let me explain.
LEADMALE:We have found that when behavioral problems arise in the classroom, it usually indicates a problem at home.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh how would you describe your relationship with your daughter? I'd say it's typical.
LEADFEMALE:"typical"? not special? Typical.
SUPFEMALE:Do you feel you spend enough time with your daughter? you mean like "quality time"? Yes.
LEADMALE:Do you spend any free time with darlene? Well, i have three kids and i work, so i don't have any free time.
SUPFEMALE:See, now, that may be the problem.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm-hmm i think the problem is is that there is no problem.
LEADFEMALE:Your daughter barks.
LEADMALE:Our whole family barks.
LEADFEMALE:I talked to your history teacher today.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, ms.
SUPFEMALE:Crane the pain? Yeah, you're a real jokester, all right.

SUPMALE:Well, what do you wanna do that for? Mom, she is so boring.
LEADFEMALE:If i don't bark, i'll fall asleep.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, did you get my bookbag? Yeah, it's over there.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, thanks.
LEADMALE:I mean it, darlene.

LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, we gotta get back to reality here.
OTHERMALE:These bills aren't gonna go away.
LEADMALE:We gotta be responsible.
LEADMALE:Why? Because for once, we finally get a chance to get caught up.

LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan do you think sometime soon you'll ever be standing out in the driveway in front of the truck when the brakes don't work? Well, if you ask me, you oughta buy the perfume.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i didn't ask you, so just drop it.
LEADFEMALE:You know what your problem is? besides you? Your problem is that you and dan don't know how to manage your money, and that's why you're always broke.
OTHERFEMALE:We're always broke 'cause we live with three little moochers that are suckin' us dry.
LEADMALE:Crystal, did they get that damn machine fixed yet? No, they're still working on it.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta learn to treat yourself once in a while, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Buy yourself something.
OTHERMALE:Take a vacation.
SUPMALE:Spoken like a true single woman.
LEADMALE:It's a shame you and dan can't take a little bit of that money and go down to that theme motel in aurora.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal, please.
SUPFEMALE:Have you seen their ads on tv? It's so romantic.
OTHERFEMALE:Every room is a different theme.
LEADFEMALE:They have a roaring '20s room, a wild west room, a roman empire room.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i can see dan gettin' in his chariot, goin' out and buy a six-pack.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, get out.
OTHERMALE:You know what i mean.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's go see what they're doing in there.
LEADMALE:How much longer? Man: five more minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:What's this? you remember that 25 bucks i borrowed? That's ten back.
LEADFEMALE:Keep it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need it.
SUPFEMALE:Take it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want it.
LEADFEMALE:Put a down payment on that perfume.
SUPMALE:Would you stop with the perfume? I told you, me and dan decided we're not gonna spend the money on nothing frivolous.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, right.
LEADMALE:And you do everything your husband tells you to do.
LEADFEMALE:Don't start.
LEADMALE:You do, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:You're just like mom.
SUPMALE:I am nothing like that woman.
OTHERFEMALE:But you are exactly like her.
SUPMALE:Whatever hubby says, goes.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if i really wanted that perfume, i would go get it.
SUPFEMALE:Right, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'll tell you something you don't know about mom.
LEADMALE:What? She used to pay your friends to play with you.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up! Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Can i help you? Oh, no, thank you.
SUPMALE:I was just looking.
LEADFEMALE:Any particular fragrance? Well, i was kind of interested in that one, "submission.
OTHERFEMALE:" we carry the complete "submission" line.
LEADFEMALE:Were you interested in the body lotion, the eau de toilet, the dusting powder, the after-bath splash? Well, i just kind of wanted to buy the regular perfume.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, of course, but perfume is really the final step in fragrance layering.
OTHERMALE:Well, i wasn't that into getting layered, i just wanted to get the perfume.
SUPFEMALE:All righty.
SUPMALE:Will this be cash or charge? Charge.
SUPMALE:Never mind, i'm not getting it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm changing myi'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh why don't you just try some on? I know what it smells like.
OTHERMALE:It really is a fabulous fragrance alluring, sensual.
SUPMALE:Men love it.
LEADFEMALE:Are you married? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i bet you have a boyfriend.
LEADMALE:Well, i am kind of shacking up with this one guy.
LEADMALE:Trust me, a few drops of this will really excite him.
SUPMALE:Well, that's what i live for, to excite that man.
LEADMALE:Don't we all? what's your boyfriend's name? Lance.
LEADMALE:Sexy.
LEADMALE:He's a race car driver.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:A man who likes danger.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i just know a little of this will really turn him on.
SUPFEMALE:Let's face it, deep down we women all want the same thing, so why not use a little help when we can get it? Well, you do have a pretty good point there.
OTHERMALE:You know what the fastest way to a man's heart is? Yeah, through his chest.
SUPMALE:Freeze! Don't even think about it.
LEADFEMALE:You better run.
LEADMALE:You better run! hey, dad! Darlene, you shouldn't do that.
LEADFEMALE:You'll scare the animals.
SUPMALE:Oh, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what's that? It's a rag.
LEADMALE:No, that.
LEADMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a bell.
LEADMALE:Right, it's a bell.
LEADMALE:Now scamper along.
LEADMALE:Well, can i ring it? No.
LEADMALE:Why not? Because it's a surprise.
LEADFEMALE:For who? It doesn't matter for who.
OTHERMALE:Now run along into the house.
SUPMALE:For mom? Yeah, sort of.
LEADFEMALE:But what if she finds out? She's not gonna find out.
OTHERMALE:But what if she does? i mean, what if she asks me about it? i'd have to tell her the truth, wouldn't i? Darlene, she's not going to ask you about it.
LEADMALE:There's your mother now.
OTHERMALE:Now remember.
SUPFEMALE:No, i won't say anything unless she asks me.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, you are my favorite.
SUPMALE:Dan: you home, roseanne? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, darling.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I got you some corn.
SUPMALE:Oh, cool! Let me help you put some of this stuff away.
LEADMALE:How was your day, sugar? Just fine, snookums.
LEADMALE:What are you so cheery about? I just ordered 400 pieces of sheetrock for that spikeman job, biggest order i ever made.

SUPFEMALE:We've always kept it there.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but remember when i started to, you know, reorganize and fix things up and everything.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Yeah, really.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you want it? It goes in the laundry room now.
LEADFEMALE:Okey-dokey.
SUPMALE:Ah-ha! What is that? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i bought that perfume.
SUPFEMALE:Kill me.
LEADMALE:You bought the perfume.
LEADMALE:Yes, sherlock, i bought the perfume.
LEADFEMALE:What about last night? what about it? Our little discussion.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't that mean anything to you? Well, i started talking to jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what about our talk? About no perfume, no bell.
LEADFEMALE:Were those just empty words blowing in the wind? I shouldn't have bought it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you did buy it, and that's the undeniable fact.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm taking it back.
SUPFEMALE:Now, just hold on a minute.
LEADMALE:I'm taking it back.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, taking it back is not gonna make either of us feel any better.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm not keeping it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, every time i put it on i just feel guilty.
OTHERFEMALE:Look would it help if i went out right now and bought that stupid bell? 'cause i'd be willing to do that for you.
SUPMALE:You already bought that bell, didn't you? Roseanne! you did! I didn't.
SUPMALE:You liar.
SUPMALE:Did not.
LEADFEMALE:You bought that bell.
SUPMALE:I did not.
SUPMALE:Look me in the eye and tell me you didn't buy that bell.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't buy that bell.
LEADFEMALE:Ask not for whom the bell tolls.
LEADMALE:It tolls for thee, butt head.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, that feels great.
SUPMALE:You could do this for a living.
LEADFEMALE:That's what old man spikeman said.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're sick! So, how do they look? Snug.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta wash 'em again before i wear 'em to school so they'll be even tighter.
SUPFEMALE:How popular do you want to be? Thanks, mom.
LEADMALE:Okay, my turn.
SUPMALE:For what? I did you, now you gotta do me.
LEADMALE:Says who? That's the deal, roseanne.

LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, that's when i knew all the steps.

OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sorry to hear that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, these things happen.
LEADFEMALE:Are you okay, patsy? Patsy: oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i wish things could've been different, but bob just couldn't handle my going to college.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of here.
LEADMALE:You ain't going to college.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, that was always the plan.
LEADMALE:Once the kids were gone, i was going to school.
LEADMALE:But the time came and bob said i couldn't go, and i said, "bye.
LEADMALE:" well, it's his loss.
SUPMALE:Patsy: oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, listen.
LEADFEMALE:I'd better get back to my date.
LEADFEMALE:It's been great seeing you.
OTHERMALE:Take care.
LEADMALE:Yeah, take it easy, kid.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Boy, that's a shame about bob and patsy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it really is.
OTHERMALE:She seems to be handling it pretty good, though.
SUPMALE:Dan, she is a shattered woman.
OTHERMALE:And why? I bet you bob refused to dance with her.
LEADFEMALE:Humph.
LEADMALE:I just can't figure it out.
SUPMALE:They were always hugging and kissing.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you mean like at that barbecue, where she was sitting in that lawn chair and running her fingers through what was left of his hair? Yeah, like that.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, get real.
SUPMALE:They were doomed.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? Well, you know, all that lovey-dovey crap was a dead giveaway.
SUPMALE:It's fighting that keeps a marriage together.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, if that's true, you and me will be together forever.
SUPFEMALE:Don't count on it, lover boy.
SUPFEMALE:I got plenty of reasons to dump you.
SUPMALE:Name one.
LEADMALE:You're a compulsive list maker.
OTHERMALE:Name two.
OTHERFEMALE:Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, if anybody's got grounds for divorce, it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? like what? Like you using my razor to shave your legs.
LEADMALE:Well, let me pack up my bags and leave in shame.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead and laugh.
LEADMALE:That'll hold up in any court in the country.
SUPFEMALE:Not after i tell that jury that you hang your dirty underwear up on the doorknob.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Wait till i tell them that you've never once accompanied me to the annual lanford subcontractor's beer bash and softball game.
LEADFEMALE:You wouldn't.
SUPFEMALE:So, you're gonna divorce me, huh? Not on your luckiest day, which you couldn't make it through without me anyways.
OTHERFEMALE:Close your eyes and count to three.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know what? If you ever even thought about it, i'd have you hung up by your toes and tortured with bizarre liquid household products.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'dyou'd what? i'dyou'd what? I'd leave you the kids.
LEADFEMALE:You wouldn't.
LEADMALE:All three of 'em.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't take 'em.
LEADMALE:Neither would i.
LEADMALE:I'd give 'em to jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, even i don't hate her that much.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Making popcorn.
LEADFEMALE:Mom said we're not allowed to use the stove, remember? I'm not gonna use the stove.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what are you gonna do? eat it out of the pan? No, i'm gonna take it outside and wait for a bolt of lightning to hit it.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Thanks, deej.
SUPMALE:What's that for? We're gonna make popcorn.
LEADFEMALE:With a heating pad? Darlene said it would work.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Hey, mom didn't say anything against heating pads.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Go right ahead, but it won't work.
SUPFEMALE:You sit right here and hold this here till it starts popping.
SUPFEMALE:I know that.
LEADFEMALE:Don't say mom and dad aren't here.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
SUPMALE:Hello? Um, they can't come to the phone right now.
LEADFEMALE:Um, they're in the shower.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, both of 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, about two more hours.
LEADMALE:Yeah, okay.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Who was that? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Hold it! I'll get the door.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, unplug that thing.
SUPMALE:Ask who it is.
SUPFEMALE:I know that, d.j. who is it? Woman: it's me.
SUPFEMALE:Me who? Aunt jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Open the door.
LEADMALE:But how do we know it's really you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't open the door, you're gonna find out it's really me.
LEADFEMALE:We're not supposed to open the door for anybody.
LEADMALE:Becky, i mean it.
LEADFEMALE:You're late.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you were supposed to be here at 7:00.
SUPFEMALE:Where have you been? I had to go to the store and return a blouse.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it's her.
LEADFEMALE:Just open the door! Can't.
SUPFEMALE:I know how to get into this house.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't.
SUPMALE:Okay, fine.
SUPFEMALE:I got better things to do than baby-sit the three little pigs.
OTHERMALE:You're on your own.
OTHERFEMALE:Aunt jackie? Back door.
LEADMALE:All: yeah.
LEADMALE:Do you see her? Shh.
OTHERMALE:I think i hear her.
SUPMALE:Where? Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Ahh! I called.

SUPMALE:Dopey finally showed up.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Now, where's chuck? Ah, relax.
LEADMALE:He'll be back in a minute.
SUPFEMALE:I want some more coffee.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna go get it.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:Coffee? Hey, there, good-looking.
SUPFEMALE:What about a warm-up, huh? Hit me, trixie.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a little behind.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's okay, chuck.
LEADMALE:Hey, she wants the decaf.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:You know, rosie, i've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:No, i've been thinking about all the couples we know.
LEADFEMALE:Almost all of 'em are divorced.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe we should try it too.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:There, we're divorced, master.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, jeannie.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what are you gonna do? The first thing i'm gonna do is, i'm gonna go dancing.
LEADMALE:Yeah, then what? Well, i guess with all that big-time child support i'm getting from you, i'm gonna enroll the kids in one of them fancy swiss boarding schools and then with all that alimony, i guess i'll quit my job and just lay around and watch the soap operas on my brand-new big screen tv.
LEADFEMALE:What you gonna do? Oh, hell, i guess the kids are gone.
LEADMALE:I'll come over to your place and watch football.
LEADMALE:Yeah, over my pit bull's dead body.
SUPMALE:I just wanted to say good night and give you my new number.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:I'll call you.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:And i also wanted to say thanks.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: what for? Well, you probably don't know it, but you're the one who inspired me to go to college.
LEADMALE:She did? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Patsy, are you trying to pin your divorce on me? No, i pin that on bob.
SUPMALE:Anyway, do you remember the barbecue? You told me how you were gonna be a writer, and you had all these dreams and plans, and nothing was gonna stop you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i do remember that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it got me to thinking.
SUPFEMALE:If nothing's gonna stop roseanne, then nothing's gonna stop me.
LEADMALE:I just wanted to tell you that.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'm glad i could help.
LEADMALE:Well, phil's waiting.
LEADMALE:I gotta go.
LEADMALE:It was great seeing you.
LEADMALE:Great seeing you too, patsy.
LEADMALE:Take care, patsy.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Well, you and patsy must have had some talk at that barbecue.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you men missed it.
LEADFEMALE:You were all off talking about the proper way of stacking charcoal briquettes.
SUPFEMALE:Rosie, you never told me you still thought about writing.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i think about that, and i think about traveling, you know.
SUPFEMALE:There's lots of stuff i still wanna do.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Does that bother you? No.
SUPMALE:Well, i mean, you've got a lot of stuff you wanna still do too, right? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Well.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i mean, you know, what if what you wanna do isn't whatwhat i wanna do? Well, we will work it out somehow.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what if we can't? i mean, you wouldn't pull no patsy on me, would you? you mean, walk out? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, i'm here 'cause i wanna be here.
LEADMALE:I'm not going no place.
SUPMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, what about down the line? Well, we don't know what's gonna happen, but whatever would happen, we will work it out together.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i guess so.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, face it, this marriage is like a life sentence with no hope for parole.
LEADMALE:Wanna dance? I thought you'd never ask.
LEADMALE:Ahh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't they cute? I wonder if we could get hold of an all-night taxidermist.
SUPFEMALE:Don't turn it off.
SUPMALE:You'll wake 'em up.
SUPFEMALE:Should we take the kids upstairs? you wanna carry 'em up there? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you? No.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go to bed.
LEADMALE:I really had fun.
OTHERMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:Sure hope i can see you again.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you can't, 'cause i'm happily married and madly in love with my husband.
LEADMALE:Is he bigger than me? Must be a lucky guy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he better not ever forget it, either.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i know nobody's been working.
OTHERMALE:This sounds real good.

LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPMALE:Whoo! All right, your old man's going back to work.
SUPMALE:Did dwight get a job for you? Maybe.
LEADMALE:He's pretty sure he's got something lined up for the stanford buil'.
SUPFEMALE:Some guy wants his kitchen remodeled.
LEADFEMALE:Be a couple weeks work.
SUPMALE:He's going to call me back as soon as it's definite.
LEADFEMALE:Great, maybe i can finally get you out of this house.
LEADMALE:So's that sofa.
LEADMALE:The only thing you've been doing for the last two weeks is just layin' there, watching tv and buffin' out your nails.
LEADMALE:How do they look? Get off! quit bothering me! Get back in there and fix your four-star chili.
LEADMALE:You only married me for my cooking.
OTHERFEMALE:Huh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:I married you 'cause you needed a date for your wedding.
LEADFEMALE:So when is this chili masterpiece gonna be done? Hey, you don't rush great art.
OTHERMALE:Make sure you make enough for jackie.
LEADFEMALE:She's coming over? honey, doesn't she come over every single saturday? I was just thinking maybe she'd miss a day.
LEADMALE:You knew when you married me that i had a sister.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't think she'd be here every weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, i didn't think i'd be here every weekend.
SUPMALE:If she had a life of her own, she wouldn't have to ruin mine.
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you, honey, two minutes after she walks in put those down.
SUPMALE:Put those down.
LEADMALE:Drop 'em.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, anyway, where was i? A few minutes after she walks through that door, she's gonna say, "dan, you know what your problem is?" i'll tie her to that chair and make her watch 15 years of our home movies.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now, that is the cruelest thing you've ever said, you beast.
LEADMALE:Jackie: anybody home? Whew! No, we moved.
SUPMALE:Kids: hi, jackie! Dan, what's wrong? My sister-in-law's here.
LEADFEMALE:The world-famous chef is dicing onions for his four-star chili.
LEADFEMALE:I love chili.
LEADFEMALE:Let me have a taste.
SUPFEMALE:I can give you some to go.
SUPMALE:Mmm.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i don't want to spoil my appetite for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:You invited her to dinner? Not yet.
LEADMALE:Jackie, honey, why don't you stay for dinner? That'll be convenient since i'm spending the night.
LEADFEMALE:Spending the night? Yeah, the pipes in my apartment froze again.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have any water.
SUPMALE:I can get you some water to go.
SUPMALE:Dan, you know what your problem is? you want me to set up the projector now? You don't put enough pepper in the chili.
OTHERFEMALE:I happen to put the perfect amount of peppers in my chili.
LEADFEMALE:It's too bland.
SUPMALE:Rosie, is my chili too bland? Absolutely not! Your chili is just like you, hot and spicy.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, aunt jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:What are you looking at? "teenage life.
LEADFEMALE:" oh, my god, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You remember that? Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:We used to read all those articles about how to be the perfect woman.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, those were great.
LEADMALE:My favorite one was "50 ways to say i love you using only your eyes.
OTHERMALE:" there's this great article in here about how to read your boyfriend's body language.
SUPFEMALE:If your boyfriend's body starts talking i want to know about it.
SUPMALE:I happen to know quite a bit about body language.
LEADMALE:Yeah? tell your body to go home? Rebecca, your father's words are saying "go home.
SUPFEMALE:" but his body is saying that he loves and adores his sister-in-law.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, jackie, read this.
OTHERMALE:Dan: all right i had a sodie on the counter.
SUPFEMALE:Who took it? D.j. : not me.
SUPMALE:Soda phantom.
LEADMALE:You mean this? what are you doing? I was drinking that.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Here.
OTHERMALE:I ain't gonna drink it if you slobbered all over it.
LEADFEMALE:Careful, dad.
LEADMALE:You'll get cooties.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i don't have cooties.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? what's this? Cut it out! dan! it's getting bigger! it's getting bigger! Cut it out.
SUPMALE:Get back in the kitchen and spice up that bland chili of yours.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you can insult my wife and you can insult my children but don't badmouth my chili.
LEADFEMALE:Can you hand me the glue? You guys are doing really good.
LEADMALE:I know, i'm in charge of the glue.
LEADMALE:You know what you need though? darlene: huh? Look in the picture.
SUPMALE:You need a drawbridge.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's cool.
LEADFEMALE:Go out in the garage and get me a piece of wood that big.
SUPFEMALE:Don't move your fingers.
LEADFEMALE:It's gotta be exactly that size.
LEADMALE:Greetings, alien.
OTHERMALE:Not now, mom.
LEADMALE:Hey, jackie, the washing machine's free.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, thanks.
OTHERMALE:Boy, you're really putting in some time on this.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i know.
OTHERMALE:It must be important.
LEADMALE:No, not really.
LEADMALE:It's just for fun.
SUPMALE:Well, let me tell you a story just for fun.
LEADMALE:No, not a story! Once upon a time, there was a once upon a time, there was this little girl who ran away from home 'cause her mother told her long, boring stories.
LEADMALE:Shut up, you.
LEADFEMALE:Once upon a time, there was a beautiful queen and she lived in a beautiful palace.
OTHERMALE:And she had a beautiful and lovely little daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Her name waslet me guess, mom.
SUPMALE:Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:No, smartmouth, it was darlena.
LEADMALE:Anyway, the beautiful queen was puzzled, and she asked darlena "why art thou building this thing?" and darlena replied, "don't try and figure it out.
LEADMALE:Just live with it.
LEADFEMALE:" what is this all about, darlene? what? Level with me.
SUPMALE:Mom i'm flunking history.
OTHERMALE:Uh-huh well, crane said if i did this castle for extra credit and did okay on the next test, i might pass.

SUPMALE:Aren't you gonna tell me how bright i am, but i never apply myself and always wait till the last minute? you don't need to hear that again, do you? Yeah, i went out with him on friday.
LEADFEMALE:I hadn't told you that.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:So, i was gonna go out with him again on saturday and then i found out he went to chicago.
LEADMALE:I found out from billy.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:I have no way to get in touch with him.
SUPFEMALE:I call his apartment and leave a message on the machine.
LEADFEMALE:I had nothing to say, i'm like "hi, how are you?" jackie, you going to stay on that phone all day? Hold on, just a second.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be off in just a second.
LEADMALE:So i leave the message, you know, and then, how am i supposed to get in touch with him? would you please hurry up? I'm expecting a very important phone call.
LEADMALE:You know what your problem is, dan? You don't have call waiting.
SUPMALE:You know what your problem is, jackie? You don't pay my phone bill.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call you later.

SUPMALE:You're welcome.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to complain but you're gonna.

LEADFEMALE:Here it is.

LEADMALE:I kind of like being around, but i feel terrible when i ain't working.
SUPMALE:Well, you want work? 'cause over at the blue flamingo they're hiring topless dancers.

OTHERMALE:"try to communicate an emotion without speaking.
SUPFEMALE:" okay, he'll be wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I just know it.
OTHERMALE:Okay, dad.
SUPMALE:What's mom thinking? She's thinking i'll be wrong.
SUPFEMALE:This is great.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, we never have to talk to each other again.
OTHERMALE:Both: yay! becky: come on, you two! Come on, try it again.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, i got it, okay.
LEADMALE:I'm transmitting a very important message.
OTHERMALE:Tune in, loverboy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i'm picking something up.
LEADMALE:All right, dan.
LEADMALE:What's she trying to tell you? She's telling me something i've wanted to hear for a real long time.
LEADMALE:My sister-in-law's moving to north dakota.
LEADFEMALE:Dad! Sorry, jackie, that was a joke.
SUPMALE:South dakota.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes there's a lot of truth in kidding.
LEADMALE:Hell, don't psycho-analyze everything i say.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, it's not worth it.
LEADMALE:No, dan, i want to know.
OTHERMALE:Do i irritate you? I don't want to get into this.
SUPMALE:No, really.
LEADMALE:Where do i begin? You don't.
LEADFEMALE:At the beginning.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:One thing, you pick all of the nuts out of the rocky road ice cream.
OTHERMALE:Well, put me in front of a firing squad.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna put you both in front of a firing squad.
SUPMALE:You could knock when you walk in the door.
LEADMALE:You want me to knock when i come over? I can knock.
LEADMALE:I'd love for you to knock when you walk in the door.
LEADMALE:Please.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Chili's ready.
LEADMALE:Dan, spit it out.
LEADFEMALE:What's really bothering you? What's bothering me is that you're over here all the time.
OTHERMALE:If you had a job you wouldn't even notice so much.
LEADFEMALE:Gosh, you simply must come over more often, sis! Well, dan really went off the deep end.
SUPMALE:Oh, you think so? He just lost a job.
SUPFEMALE:That was the phone call he was waiting for.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:I don't know how you do it.
LEADMALE:You always manage to say the most perfectly wrongest thing, at the most perfectly wrongest time.
LEADMALE:Just like mom.
LEADMALE:Well, okay, take his side.
SUPMALE:Oh there you go, that's two.
LEADFEMALE:That's the most perfectly wrongest thing you could have said to me.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you think before you talk? you expect me to apologize to him? No, i don't expect you to do nothing.
LEADMALE:That's what you want.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna tell you what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? You're gonna tell me what to do anyway, just like mom.
LEADFEMALE:That's three! He has been on my case ever since i came in the door.
LEADMALE:I'm not apologizing to him until he apologizes to me.
SUPMALE:Mom? what? are dad and aunt jackie really mad at each other? No they just fight for the same reason you fight with darlene.
SUPFEMALE:To torture me.
SUPMALE:Darlene: d.j. , look what you did.
LEADMALE:Mom! Look what you did.
LEADFEMALE:You ruined it! i didn't mean to! you're so stupid! What happened? D.j. fell on my castle and crushed it.
SUPFEMALE:We can fix it.
LEADFEMALE:No, we can't.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna flunk history and it's all d.j. 's fault.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it's d.j. 's fault.
SUPMALE:Yes, look what he did.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, it's definitely his fault that you didn't study all semester.
SUPFEMALE:But mom, he was just hereand it's his fault that you put this off to the last minute.
LEADMALE:You always take his side.
LEADMALE:I'm not taking his side.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you are.
OTHERFEMALE:You're strict with me and becky, but you let d.j. get away with murder.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, who are you really mad at? D.j. yeah, well that makes a lot of sense.
SUPFEMALE:If i'd screwed around all semester and was flunking history, i'd be looking for somebody else to blame it on too.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what i'm doing.
SUPFEMALE:That's exactly what you're doing, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:It's not fair! D.j. come on down here, honey.
LEADMALE:D.j. : is darlene there? No, she's gone.
LEADFEMALE:It's safe.
OTHERMALE:Come on down.
OTHERMALE:Looks like you really re-decorated darlene's castle.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean to.
LEADMALE:I know, it was an accident.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene hates me.
SUPMALE:She doesn't hate you, honey, she hates history.
LEADMALE:She said i was stupid.
LEADMALE:You're not stupid, you're just clumsy like your daddy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:Do you want to go in the kitchen and be my official chili taster? No.
SUPFEMALE:You're just gonna sit here on the steps for the rest of your life? Yep.
SUPFEMALE:And let people walk on you and pile books on you and junk? Yep.
LEADMALE:Well, that ain't much of a life.
LEADFEMALE:But i'll help you get started.
OTHERMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:I'll give you a hat.
SUPMALE:Mom, should i put this other load in the dryer? Roseanne: no, i'll do it in a minute.
LEADMALE:Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup okay, horsy.
SUPFEMALE:Get up here.
SUPMALE:Whoo! ahh! Mom, i finished folding the laundry.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You're one of my three favorite kids.
LEADFEMALE:What about me? No.
LEADMALE:Are you ready for some delicious chili? Yep.
LEADMALE:Okay, you ready for the greatest chili in the entire world? Yep.
SUPMALE:All right, here you go.
OTHERMALE:Just a little bit bland.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, this garage is a mess.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta get organized.
LEADMALE:Dad, can i use this? No, i need that, me, myself and i, manny m.
OTHERFEMALE:Man.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Cutting some more wood.
SUPFEMALE:So you're going to fix that castle? Yeah, but it's still d.j. 's fault.
SUPFEMALE:Gosh, darlene's so doggone stubborn.
LEADMALE:I wonder where she gets it from.
LEADMALE:Not from me.
SUPMALE:No, it couldn't be from you.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i know what you're doing.
LEADMALE:There's no way i'm gonna go in there and apologize to your sister.
SUPMALE:I just thought i'd let you know that i'm gonna go check into a motel.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody we know? I think it'd be better if i stayed somewhere else.
LEADFEMALE:How about the phillipines? you know what your problem is, dan? Yeah, you.
LEADFEMALE:See i come in here and try to make things easy, and he's acting like a big baby.
SUPMALE:Would you tell your sister it takes one to know one.
LEADMALE:I don't know how you get along with this guy.
LEADMALE:Tell your sister to hit the bricks.
LEADFEMALE:I know this game.
LEADMALE:I really know this game.
LEADFEMALE:It's called "let's tear roseanne apart.
LEADFEMALE:" you take this arm, and you take this arm, and then you just both pull until i splatter into a puddle.
SUPFEMALE:She's over here all the time because she's my sister.
LEADFEMALE:He don't mean nothing, he's just blowing off steam.
LEADMALE:You two are worse than all three of the kids put together.
LEADMALE:You're driving me nuts.
LEADMALE:You've got to get it together.
LEADFEMALE:Well you don't have to stay in no motel.
LEADFEMALE:That's silly.
LEADFEMALE:You can sleep out here.
LEADMALE:She's really something.
LEADFEMALE:She does get carried away sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:She loves to tell everybody exactly how to lead their lives.
LEADMALE:That's 'cause she thinks she knows everything.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: well, i do! Dan isn't that movie over yet? No.
OTHERMALE:I want to go to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Please.
SUPFEMALE:This is the best part of the movie.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, you're on my bed.
LEADMALE:Jackie, your bed is my sofa.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go, sis.
LEADMALE:Dan won't get off the couch.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, get off the couch.
LEADFEMALE:Shhh! Getting ready for the showdown
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I just wanna see that lumber first thing tomorrow morning, period.
LEADMALE:Period.
SUPFEMALE:Vroom, vroom! D.j. , please don't drive your truck on my blueprints.
LEADFEMALE:Vroom, vroom! Vroom-vroom-vroom-vroom-vroom.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe they shortened me 25 pieces of lumber.
OTHERMALE:May they rot in hell.
OTHERFEMALE:I got the receipt.
LEADFEMALE:I got something that'll cheer you up.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, you got 25 two-by-fours? yeah, and you know what else i got? This official entry blank for that radio station's country-western songwriting contest.
SUPFEMALE:So? So.
LEADMALE:I ain't entering no contest.
LEADMALE:Come on, you should do it.
SUPMALE:It'd be a hoot.
LEADFEMALE:You're the writer in the family.
OTHERMALE:You do it.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't got no musical talent.
LEADFEMALE:You're the one with the trunkful of songs out in the garage.
OTHERMALE:Honey, i wrote that stuff years ago.
OTHERMALE:You ought to dig one out and just send it in.
LEADFEMALE:Huh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:Come on, you're really good at it.
OTHERMALE:No, no contest for this cowboy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan whatwhat could you win? what difference does it make? You're not gonna enter it anyway.
SUPMALE:I'm just curious.
SUPMALE:The first prize is a hundred bucks, plus you get to hear your song played over the radio.
LEADMALE:Ah, i ain't got no talent.
LEADMALE:Come on, you know you wanna do it.
SUPMALE:It would be kind of nice hearing one of my songs played on the radio.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you can no longer deprive the world of your special talent.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:Of course i'm right.
LEADFEMALE:You need to cut it loose and set it free.
LEADMALE:Do it for humanity.
OTHERFEMALE:Bingo.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Getting something to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Your break isn't for two minutes.
OTHERMALE:Well, then, i'll go back to work two minutes early.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, harris.
LEADMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you have an attitude problem.
SUPFEMALE:I do? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:And i was thinking that we should, uh, work on it someplace outside of the workplace.
LEADFEMALE:Where would you suggest, the back seat of your car? No.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:I was thinking more along the lines of my apartment.
LEADFEMALE:There is no way that i'm gonna end up a notch on your bedpost.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not coming on to you.
OTHERMALE:You think i'm coming on to you? It crossed my mind.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:See, i'mi'm just trying to improve employee-management relations.
LEADFEMALE:Nice save, booker.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? Looks like a phone number.
LEADFEMALE:Let's work on that attitude.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, what kind of song is dan gonna enter? He hadn't even decided yet.
LEADFEMALE:I bet it'll be romantic.
LEADMALE:Can't go wrong with a love song.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, love songs are hokey.
LEADFEMALE:I like something i can dance to.
LEADFEMALE:Get down, sylvia.
SUPMALE:It's a country-western station, right? Roseanne: yeah.
LEADMALE:Then the song doesn't matter.
SUPFEMALE:All that counts is the title.
LEADFEMALE:Sis, i guess you're an expert on that, too, huh? That happens to be true.
SUPFEMALE:Look at the classic "take this job and shove it.
SUPFEMALE:" all: yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie: it's just the title.
LEADFEMALE:You know what dan should really try to write? A road song.
LEADFEMALE:Gosh, you're right.
OTHERMALE:I love road songs.
LEADFEMALE:When that whiskey-voice guy starts singing about highways and byways.
LEADFEMALE:What exactly is the difference between a highway and a byway? a highway is the main road, right? And the byway is the road that runs right along by it.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's an access road.
LEADMALE:A byway is a road that goes around something.
SUPMALE:No, that's a bypass.
LEADMALE:There is no difference between a highway and a byway.
LEADMALE:Okay? I'm so glad you figured that out.
OTHERMALE:Maybe we can all get some sleep tonight.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what people can't get enough of hardship songs.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:There's nothing like a hardship song that set my toes to tappin'.
LEADMALE:Well, that's what all the best songs are about.
SUPFEMALE:Pain, misery.
SUPMALE:You know, real life.
OTHERMALE:My life.
SUPMALE:My parents kicked me out of the house when i was 16.
LEADFEMALE:Moved in with crazy aunt ina and a houseful of cats.
OTHERMALE:Married at 17, widowed at 18.
OTHERFEMALE:Tornado carried away my car.
LEADMALE:Hospitalized for pneumonia.
LEADMALE:Everybody sing.
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:The one and only.
LEADMALE:Where's dad? He's out in the garage, honey, struggling with the muses.
LEADFEMALE:I need him to fix my truck.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to it? The wheel fell off.
LEADMALE:Give it to me.
LEADMALE:You don't know how to fix trucks.
LEADMALE:I know how to do anything.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Dads are supposed to fix trucks.
LEADMALE:Give me that.
LEADFEMALE:Go sit down here.
LEADMALE:Becky: don't touch that.
LEADMALE:Darlene: i didn't touch it.
SUPMALE:Mom, you hear that? Yeah, becky and darlene are at it again.
SUPFEMALE:They're giving me a headache.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:I've had it.
OTHERFEMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:They say they're gonna be quiet, but they never are.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, never.
LEADMALE:Never.
LEADFEMALE:You know what else? what? They're always in the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:They're horrible, rotten girls.
SUPFEMALE:What are we gonna do with them? Kill 'em.
LEADMALE:Nah, then i'd just have to clean up the mess.
SUPMALE:I guess we're gonna have to live with them until they move out.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here you go.
LEADMALE:One fixed truck.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Vroom! Becky: just shut up, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene: it's half my room, too, little miss perfect.
LEADMALE:Well, you can have both halves for all i care.
OTHERMALE:What is your problem? You're my problem, you little slob.
SUPFEMALE:You used to be almost normal.
SUPMALE:Yeah, until you were born.
SUPFEMALE:Knock it off.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish mom and dad had left you at that hospital.
SUPMALE:Shut up, becky.
LEADMALE:Mom! she's not here! Mother, i can't spend another minute in the same room with her.
SUPFEMALE:And whom, pray tell, are we talking about? Mother, please, you know who i'm talking about.
SUPFEMALE:The pig.
LEADMALE:Here's your filthy, disgusting pillow.
OTHERMALE:All you two have been doing this whole week is fighting, and i really want it to stop now.
LEADFEMALE:Then talk to darlene.
LEADFEMALE:She leaves all her grungy stuff all over my side of the room.
LEADFEMALE:What? I can't leave anything anywhere without her going into convulsions.
LEADMALE:There's only one way to solve this problem.
LEADMALE:Give me that pillow.
LEADMALE:And give me that blanket, too.
SUPMALE:Now, turn around and face each other here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, i want you two to fight to the death.
SUPFEMALE:Mother.
SUPMALE:Go on, start ripping each other apart, limb from limb.
LEADMALE:And whoever's left standing gets to keep the room.
LEADFEMALE:You know what she's trying to do.
SUPMALE:Well, i do have another plan.
SUPMALE:I hate it when she does this.
SUPMALE:Go get the masking tape"put a line down the center of the room.
LEADFEMALE:" "and stay on your side.
LEADFEMALE:" mom, that never works.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you make it work, girls.
LEADMALE:Fine, i'll get the tape.
LEADMALE:No, i'll get the tape.
LEADMALE:I'm getting the tape.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get the tape.
SUPMALE:I'm getting my tubes tied.
LEADMALE:Look what i brought you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks, baby.
LEADMALE:Just put it down here.
LEADMALE:This drill hasn't worked since i bought it.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you was out here composing.
LEADFEMALE:I tried a few things, but, uh i don't know, i guess i just wasn't inspired.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'm here now.
SUPMALE:And yet somehow i'm still not inspired.
SUPMALE:Well, if you're not gonna write no songs, why don't you dig out some of these to send in.
OTHERMALE:I already looked.
SUPMALE:There's nothing in there worth sending.
LEADFEMALE:Don't give me that.
LEADFEMALE:There's bound to be an undiscovered masterpiece in here.
OTHERMALE:Trust me, they all suck mud.
SUPMALE:Face it, i'm a small-time contractor.
OTHERFEMALE:I ain't no big-time composer.
SUPFEMALE:Well, this is no big-time contest.
LEADFEMALE:What is this? what? Give it to me.
SUPMALE:It was, uhit was a dance hit.
SUPMALE:In the seventies, i guess.

LEADFEMALE:These are kind of grungy.
LEADMALE:Check 'em out.
SUPFEMALE:It's some kind of fungus in there.
LEADFEMALE:Get away.
LEADMALE:You're making me sick.

SUPMALE:Actually, no.
SUPFEMALE:See, 'cause if you lose, then we both win.
OTHERMALE:I've got a 160 average, booker.
LEADFEMALE:There's no way you're gonna beat me.

SUPFEMALE:What picture? Dad's getting a photographer to take some stupid family portrait.
SUPFEMALE:He's doing what? if i order the 32-piece package, you'll throw in the wallet size? Dan! One sec, babe.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i understand the offer expires this weekend.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? what are you doing? I think i better talk to my wife first.
SUPMALE:Right, bye.
LEADMALE:Honey, guess what i just did.
SUPMALE:It doesn't have anything to do with a once-in-a-lifetime money-saving offer, does it? No.
SUPMALE:What would you say to a full-color commemorative family portrait? of whose family? Ours.
SUPMALE:What do we need that for? 'cause this came today.
LEADMALE:We got our 15-year high school reunion coming up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, spare me.
LEADMALE:What happened to your school spirit? I lost it on prom night along with everything else.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, great, cream-style! No, check this out.
LEADFEMALE:The reunion committee is updating the yearbook and they want us to send in a family portrait.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, to see if we've improved with age? Roseanne, people will be looking at this yearbook for years to come.
SUPFEMALE:I think we should send in the best picture we possibly can.
LEADFEMALE:We should send 'em in that one of us in yellowstone park.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, we're mooning old faithful in that one.
SUPMALE:I know, but it fits in with the theme here, "looking back on 15 years.
SUPFEMALE:" whose lame-brain idea is this anyways? Oh, my god, it's phyllis zimmer.
SUPFEMALE:That pointy-head little phony.
SUPFEMALE:Wasn't she the one that was always in charge of everything in high school? "come on, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Grab some crepe paper.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna go in the gym and decorate, and then we'll make punch.
SUPMALE:" i like it.
OTHERFEMALE:Do it again, only jump up and down.
LEADFEMALE:Shake your pom-poms.
OTHERMALE:Get away from me.
LEADMALE:You know why she wants us to send in a picture? To make sure her life turned out the best.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, d.j. 's bothering me.
LEADMALE:I'm a cowboy.
LEADMALE:No, you're not any kind of a cowboy.
LEADMALE:Mom, i can't do my homework.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't do your homework 'cause the tv's on.
LEADFEMALE:Gimme that rope, partner.
LEADFEMALE:I need that for your daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Can i tie you up? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I don't mean to push, but i gotta call flash photo and let 'em know what the deal is.
LEADMALE:Your tail's really wagging over this picture, isn't it? picture? what picture? are we getting our picture taken? We're thinking about it.
LEADFEMALE:You guys aren't gonna do what you did in yellowstone, are you? We're thinking about it.
LEADMALE:Gimme one of these.
OTHERMALE:Where is your lunch? I ate it.
SUPMALE:Just one.
LEADMALE:Hey, roseanne i hear dan kept you up half the night last night.
LEADMALE:Ooh! It's not as good as it sounds, porno-head.
LEADMALE:He was up all night looking for a belt that matches his tie and his shirt.
LEADMALE:He's gonna wear himself out over this picture.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and i have to give up a whole saturday to impress some people i didn't even like back then.
OTHERMALE:I sure cared what my schoolmates thought.
OTHERMALE:We know, crystal.
SUPMALE:They voted me second runner-up for junior sweetheart queen.
LEADFEMALE:I would've won, except for tristi vane.
LEADFEMALE:She got her hair done which was against the rules.
LEADFEMALE:Woman: i know the type.
LEADMALE:Perfect hair, perfect teeth.
OTHERMALE:Matching sweater and headband.
LEADFEMALE:I think that's a smart look.
LEADMALE:Well, that's why you came in second, crystal.
SUPMALE:I always hated those frilly-dilly types.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:We had a girl like that in our school, huh, sis? I don't even like remembering it.
SUPFEMALE:Her locker was next to mine this one day, and i didn't know my rifle was loaded.
OTHERFEMALE:It blew her right in half.
SUPMALE:She didn't know.
LEADFEMALE:It took me almost all of fifth period to get over it.
SUPFEMALE:There's no paper towels.
SUPMALE:You know, this is the third time this week.
LEADMALE:How come there's always paper towels in the men's room? They never dry their hands.
SUPMALE:Yeah, 'cause they never wash their hands.
SUPMALE:I don't know why management can't give us the supplies we need.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:This has got nothing to do with paper towels.
SUPMALE:This is just a sneaky old ploy by management to get us all worked up in a huff about small stuff so we never think about things that are really important like benefits and pay raises and uh, fresher vending items.
OTHERMALE:Those slimeballs are trying to break us.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i get so sick of how you guys get so worked up over every little thing.
SUPFEMALE:Man: hi, roseanne.
SUPMALE:What'd i tell you about going in there? She likes it in there.
LEADMALE:She wants to be a man.
LEADMALE:That makes two of us, huh, pete? Hey, ladies, not only do they have all the paper towels, but they got great, big old drinking fountains in there too.
SUPFEMALE:You know what the problem with you women is.
SUPMALE:You use too damn many paper products.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shut up or i'll wipe my hands on your bald head.
LEADFEMALE:Booker: i'll tell you what, i'll make sure that you ladies get some paper towels.
LEADMALE:Hooker, we want 'em now, or we don't go back to work.
LEADFEMALE:Strike! strike! Pete, get some towels.
OTHERMALE:Hey, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, you know what'd be cool? We can put this in the picture.
LEADFEMALE:No, that'd be too much, honey.
LEADMALE:Come on, dad.
LEADFEMALE:It'd be so cool.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we could put it right here.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it does add a certain something.
SUPMALE:I hate my hair, i hate my clothes, i hate my face.
OTHERMALE:Well, that makes two of us.
LEADMALE:Honey, i already told you.
SUPFEMALE:You look fine.
SUPFEMALE:I can't get my hair right.
LEADFEMALE:Shave it and shut up.
SUPMALE:I hate this sweater.
SUPMALE:Hey, dad, you know what would be cool? We could all wear our sunglasses and hang out the back of the truck.
OTHERFEMALE:Ix-nay on the shades, princess.
LEADMALE:Let's just try and look like a normal family.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why can't we be ourselves? how do i look, dad? Top drawer, amigo! Daddy's little man.
LEADFEMALE:What about this? Fine, perfect.
LEADMALE:Okay, come on.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , you stand here.
LEADMALE:Becky, you're here.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, you're over here.

SUPMALE:Kids: whoa! Becky: look at mom.
SUPMALE:Ooh, la-la, look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:Stunning, ain't it? I brushed my teeth.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to you? This is the real me.
LEADMALE:That's my favorite dress.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you can wear it tonight when we're alone.
LEADFEMALE:Help me with this necklace, honey.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne: don't choke me now.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: hi.
LEADMALE:Am i in the wrong house? You bet.
LEADFEMALE:You want the one right down the street.
LEADMALE:You guys look great! What are you doing here? Laundry.
OTHERFEMALE:It's saturday.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, i gotta make sure this hack photographer you hired doesn't screw the picture up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, aunt jackie, i have to show you something.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:You look pretty handsome there, sport.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:You know, this is the first time we've had a real photographer take our picture since our wedding day.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, black sunday.
OTHERFEMALE:Who are you kiddin'? You loved it.
LEADMALE:You practically ran down the aisle.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but i was just drunk and i meant to go the other way.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie: come here, come here.
SUPMALE:Look at your dad.
SUPFEMALE:What you got here? Your senior yearbook.
SUPMALE:Your football picture.
LEADFEMALE:Old '67.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! Hey, wait a minute, what's wrong with your nose? He always flared his nostrils out like that 'cause he thought it made him look mean.
LEADMALE:No, it's 'cause of the way the other guy smelled.
SUPMALE:Oh, here's you, mom.
LEADFEMALE:You look so queer.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you wore a flip.
LEADMALE:That's when i was going through my marlo thomas' "that girl" phase.
LEADMALE:I was gonna go to new york and become a writer/spokesmodel.
SUPMALE:You gave it all up for a guy with flared nostrils and stinky friends.
LEADMALE:I think you look pretty.
LEADMALE:Well, i think you look purdy too.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, when did you fall in love with mom? As soon as she told me to, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You couldn't pry them apart.
LEADMALE:It was disgusting.
LEADMALE:Well, what about you, mom? were you always in love with dad? He was all man and all mineooh, baby, baby.
LEADMALE:It was shameless the way your mother chased me.
OTHERFEMALE:Every day she'd be there at my locker, panting and clawing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, back in the good old days when i still had a waistline and some estrogen.
LEADMALE:I can't believe how young we are here.
LEADMALE:We're all like five years older than becky.
LEADMALE:Don't give her any ideas.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't all a picnic.
SUPMALE:What about that week you broke up with me? I didn't break up with you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you did.
SUPMALE:That week of senior year.
SUPFEMALE:You broke up with me.
SUPFEMALE:I did not.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to keep you on your toes and shake you up a bit.
LEADFEMALE:We were at arnie patterson's garage dance, and we had that big fight, and you said you were gonna see other people.
LEADFEMALE:He's right, i remember, 'cause you had just read that article about how to drive your boyfriend wild by making him jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, don't tell him about it.
LEADFEMALE:That's why you don't have a man, 'cause you don't know what to leave out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so you leave out the part where you come crawling back on your hands and knees.
LEADFEMALE:You really need to start bleaching your moustache, it's coming in a lot darker.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's the photographer.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the door! Oh, look lee eggblad.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, eggie, that psychopath.
LEADFEMALE:Wonder what he's doing now.
LEADMALE:Probably 20 to life.
SUPMALE:There she is, your personal favorite.
OTHERFEMALE:Phyllis "gag me" zimmer.
LEADMALE:What a waste of boobs.
LEADMALE:I can't believe dan ever took her out.
LEADFEMALE:He never took her out.
LEADFEMALE:What? when did he take her out? That week you guys broke up.
LEADMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:He never told you that? No.
LEADFEMALE:Wellit wasn't important.
LEADFEMALE:That's a very pretty dress you have on.
LEADMALE:Bob, um, we thought that this spot here would be good for the photo.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:This is nice.
LEADFEMALE:Now how many people will be participating in the photo? Three children and two adults.
OTHERMALE:Splendid.
SUPFEMALE:Where's becky? Oh, she went upstairs to change again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, go get her.
LEADFEMALE:We're getting ready to start here.
LEADMALE:Do you have to go to the bathroom? No.
SUPMALE:Are you sure? Rosie, this is bob keeler from flash photo.
SUPMALE:Hi, bob.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:You have a lovely home.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Well, it keeps me off the streets.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, we thought that this would be a good spot for the picture.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think phyllis will like it? why should we care what she thinks? Because 15 years ago, we dated her behind our back.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? what? well, uh, we ready here to start, hmm? No.
LEADFEMALE:You went out with her and you didn't even tell me about it.
SUPMALE:Rosie, bob here is on a very tight schedule.
SUPFEMALE:Can this possibly wait? another 15 years? should i leave? No, bob, you're a man.
LEADFEMALE:Let me ask you a question.
LEADMALE:Do you think it's a lousy, low-down sleazebag thing to do to lie to your own wife for 15 years? how many years? As long as we're giving somebody the third degree, let's start with your sister.
LEADFEMALE:You leave her out of this.
LEADFEMALE:Why does she butt her nose into our business? Hey, it's your fault, not hers.
LEADMALE:Jackie.
LEADMALE:Yeah? You're the one who went out with phyllis, not her.
LEADMALE:Thanks, big mouth.
SUPFEMALE:What? You had to blab about phyllis.
SUPMALE:Sorry, dan, i thought you would have told her by now.
LEADMALE:There was nothing to tell.
SUPFEMALE:It was one measly date.
LEADFEMALE:If it was so measly, how come you didn't tell me when we first got back together? Jackie said not to.
SUPFEMALE:So you're the one that's responsible for keeping me in the dark.
SUPMALE:You guys were already back together.
LEADFEMALE:What's the point in bringing it up? Yeah, honey, it was no big deal.
SUPFEMALE:I was trying to protect you.
SUPFEMALE:If it was no big deal, what were you trying to protect me from? Roseanne, it was a long time ago.
SUPMALE:I gotta get out of here.
SUPMALE:I got some better things to do.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, rosie, we got a picture to take.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i just want to know why you went out with her in the first place.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, you dumped me.
SUPFEMALE:What was i supposed to do? Go to your grave wanting me back.
LEADMALE:I did want you back.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, you got a funny way of showing it.
LEADFEMALE:What'd you do on this date? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Get more specific than that.
OTHERFEMALE:She hopped on my motorcycle, we went for a ride.
SUPFEMALE:So, that's all you did.
SUPFEMALE:You just rode around.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:And you didn't stop anyplace? I don't remember.
LEADFEMALE:We just rode around.
LEADMALE:Just riding, riding, riding around, not stopping anywhere.
LEADMALE:We might have stopped someplace.
SUPFEMALE:Like where? Rosie.
OTHERFEMALE:Where? What difference does it make? 'cause i want to know.
OTHERFEMALE:Watch-out hill.
SUPMALE:Are we ever gonna do this? In a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you broke my heart.
LEADMALE:Did you do it with her? Come on, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Did you? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:We're ready when you are.
LEADFEMALE:We may have to do this another day.
LEADFEMALE:No, we can do it right now.
LEADFEMALE:We'll do it now.
LEADFEMALE:You're sure? Yeah, let's take the picture.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:The kids are all tucked in.
LEADMALE:What you watching? D.j. was so cute.
LEADFEMALE:He wanted to know if we're getting a divorce.
OTHERFEMALE:Are we? did i forget to tell you i'm not talking to you? Look, i want to tell you everything that happened.
SUPFEMALE:You've obviously mistaken me for someone who cares.
LEADMALE:Look, when you broke up with me, i guess i was trying to prove something to myself.
LEADMALE:I don't know why i picked phyllis.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i know.
LEADMALE:But she just broke up with her boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:I ran into her at a party, we went for a ride, we wound up on the hill.
LEADFEMALE:And it just sort of happened.
LEADFEMALE:It didn't mean anything.
LEADFEMALE:Could you explain that to me? can you tell me how you make love with somebody and it doesn't mean nothing? Well, you start with a case of beer then go get me a case of beer so i can shower up with the chicago bears.
OTHERFEMALE:Hell, honey, they're not even a good team anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Mean something, mean something.
LEADFEMALE:Why does it always have to mean something? I don't know, dan, i just always thought it did.
LEADMALE:Look, what happened that long ago doesn't have anything to do with you and me now.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it does.
SUPMALE:'cause you're the one person i thought i could trust.
LEADMALE:I still am.
LEADMALE:Nothing's changed.
LEADMALE:Then how come i'm sitting here wondering what else i don't know about you? I'm asking you to trust me.
LEADFEMALE:God, i hate you.
LEADFEMALE:I hate you too, baby.
OTHERMALE:No one else has ever mattered.
LEADMALE:Then why'd you go all out over this picture? did you think i was doing this for phyllis? I was doing this for us.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of this family.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of the fact that we've been married 15 years.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know how amazing that is? Yeah, pretty amazing considering i can't stand you.
SUPMALE:Everybody said we got married too young, that we would never last.
SUPFEMALE:Here we are.
LEADFEMALE:What do you suppose our secret is? We can't afford to pay two rents.
SUPMALE:Hey, give me some of that there blanket.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Come on, i'm freezing.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go find old phyllis to warm up your big old butt? 'cause nobody can warm up my big old butt like you, babycakes.
SUPMALE:Honey pie.
LEADFEMALE:Sugar darling.
LEADMALE:Snookie baby.
LEADFEMALE:Etcetera, etcetera.
LEADMALE:This is nice.
OTHERMALE:These shots turned out pretty good.
OTHERFEMALE:They're not too bad.
SUPFEMALE:I should have worn my other belt.
LEADMALE:If you say one more word about that belt, i'm going to strangle you with it.
LEADMALE:I don't look so bad in these.
LEADFEMALE:You're not too ugly.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, i look pretty good.
LEADMALE:Can i take this one to school? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene's blocking my softball trophy in that one.

LEADFEMALE:No way! My eyes are all closed up.
LEADMALE:Let's send in that one.
LEADMALE:Huh-uh i'm making a face in that one.

SUPMALE:Why does this always happen to me? When i meet a man, i give and give and give some more, and then he takes and takes and takes some more, and then he dumps me.
LEADMALE:Well, there's a definite pattern here, crystal.
LEADMALE:But i'm a nice person.
LEADFEMALE:Why does this always happen to me? Well, i don't know how to tell you this, honey, but, well, you're a doormat.
LEADFEMALE:I am not.
SUPMALE:Crystal, how many times have you been married? I don't see what that has to do with anything.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:How many times? Three.
LEADMALE:And how many times you had you heart broken? More times than i can count.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why do you think that is? Because i'm a doormat.
OTHERFEMALE:You see what it all comes down to? It's your self-esteem.
SUPMALE:Oh, i never had any of that.
LEADMALE:Jackie: you're a classic case, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:This is a lifelong pattern that will just repeat itself over and over and over again.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:You're absolutely right.
SUPFEMALE:When a man pays me a compliment, next thing you know i'm married.
LEADMALE:And then, before i can blink, i'm divorced.
LEADMALE:And that is the pattern that you have to break.
LEADMALE:You can't get sucked in to all those compliments.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i can't help it.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, you can, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:You just need some practice.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, let's pretend that i'm a guy.
SUPMALE:Oh, roseanne, that's silly.
OTHERMALE:No, i'm gonna be one these studs over here at the bar, you know? And then i'm gonna come over to you and start coming on to you, see, and then you tell me to get lost.
LEADMALE:Okay, i'll try.
SUPMALE:Okay, i'm gonna be the man.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, there, little missy.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't know how to fix a broken zipper in an old pair of blue jeans now, now would you? You're pathetic.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're about as pretty as a young deer running through a green field in the autumn.
LEADFEMALE:And now you tell him to get lost.
LEADFEMALE:Please get lost.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, for crying out loud, crystal.
LEADMALE:I'll do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, you be the guy and you do it to me.
LEADFEMALE:Now watch.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, here he comes.
OTHERMALE:Hello there, you sweet youngoh, my! jackie: hello! roseanne: hey! Take a hike, pal, and crawl back under your rock.
SUPFEMALE:Get away from me, you weasel-faced geek.
LEADFEMALE:See?it's easy.
LEADFEMALE:You either learn how to do that, or you swear off men forever.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, is this chair taken? Yes, that chair's taken.
OTHERFEMALE:Quit bothering us! go on a hike! Oh, she forgot to take her medication.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Go ahead and take the chair.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Get a grip.
SUPMALE:Lighten up, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:He only wanted a chair.
LEADMALE:Look, first they want your chair, then they want your bed.
LEADFEMALE:They're all alike, rotten to the core.
LEADMALE:Oh, crystal.
LEADMALE:There are a few decent men left out there.
LEADMALE:You mean, like booker? Booker happens to have a lot of potential.
OTHERMALE:Well, why don't you go tell him that? There he is.

SUPMALE:Darlene, i'm not gonna read the book for you.
LEADMALE:I read the stupid book.
SUPFEMALE:Then write the stupid report.
LEADMALE:Dad, she was born, she sewed a flag, and she died.
LEADMALE:I can't write five pages about that.
SUPMALE:Please, those of us who did our homework are trying to watch the game.
LEADMALE:Oh, shove it.

LEADFEMALE:You didn't? I'm letting them soak.
SUPFEMALE:Please let me watch the game.

OTHERMALE:They're all rotten.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, give me your wedding ring.
LEADFEMALE:For what? Just let me use it.
SUPMALE:What are you gonna do? You know, booker, times like this i'm sorry i got a roommate.

LEADFEMALE:I didn't say that it hurt me.
LEADMALE:I said that you lied to me.
OTHERFEMALE:The way you treat me at work, i didn't think it matteredoh, don't give me that.
LEADFEMALE:You know damn well the way we treat each other has nothing to do with the way we feel.

SUPMALE:I'd give anything to have a man as wonderful as dan.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, he's all right.
LEADMALE:What was the one thing that made you want to marry him? His sense of humor.
OTHERMALE:That and the ways his jeans kept falling off the back of his butt.

OTHERMALE:No, he's a cpa in detroit.
LEADFEMALE:Same thing.
OTHERMALE:Crystal, you don't want to go back to high school, and, you know, man or no man, you're a good person.
SUPFEMALE:I don't feel like one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you are a good person, crystal.
LEADMALE:You're a great mother to lonnie, and you're always the first person that comes running every time anybody needs anything.

LEADMALE:So, dad, you punched some guy out last night? Nobody hit nobody.
SUPFEMALE:Dwight, hold this.

SUPFEMALE:Why are you lying to my kid? Don't get sore at me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just trying to make you look good.

LEADFEMALE:I couldn't tell her what really happened.
OTHERFEMALE:What really happened? The guy was bigger than you.
SUPMALE:He was younger than you.
SUPFEMALE:You did the right thing.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't exactly see you jumping in to help.
LEADFEMALE:It was your quarter.
LEADMALE:It was my quarter and it was my fight.
LEADFEMALE:I handled it the way i thought best.
SUPMALE:Listen, if it makes you feel any better, i told some of the guys down at the hardware store.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody thinks you were a wimp for backing down.
LEADFEMALE:Dwight, shut up.
SUPMALE:Except ted, the key grinder.
SUPFEMALE:Dwight, get out.
LEADMALE:I got to get some air.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Don't touch that door.

SUPMALE:Hey, claire.
OTHERMALE:Hi, rosie.
LEADMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:Who's winning? Hi, baby.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna play? No.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just bug you for a while.
LEADFEMALE:What happened with you and dwight? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Well, what are you doing here? We got beer at home.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't let it go.
LEADMALE:I keep playing last night over in my head.
LEADFEMALE:I keep seeing that guy right in my face just asking for it, and i didn't do anything about it.
LEADMALE:Are you still mad? No.
LEADMALE:How could i be mad at you? You got me off the hook.
SUPMALE:You didn't really wanna hit that guy, did ya? Yeah, i wanted to hit him, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't want him to hit me back.
LEADMALE:Well, i can understand that.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, i can't.
SUPFEMALE:Ten years ago, i never would've thought about that.
SUPMALE:Honey, what's happened to me? Well me and the kids civilized you when you wasn't looking.
OTHERMALE:Either that or i'm getting old.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you wear it well.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:You know, the only thing that matters to me is that you're here for another birthday.
LEADMALE:Mine.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i love my present.
LEADFEMALE:You opened it? it had my name on it, didn't it? Well, it does sort of remind me of youyou know, old and rusty and all.
LEADFEMALE:You really like me this way? Not really.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey! It's mr.
LEADMALE:Tough guy.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, tell me something, 'cause i got to know.
SUPMALE:What do you and your fat wife think of my new hat? Just this once.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get out of here.
SUPMALE:I can't believe you slammed your hand in the car door.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, accidents will happen, princess.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me about this date.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna know everything.
SUPMALE:Oh, it was great, but the dinner was awful.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand that, because i made sure i gave chip's mom a list of your favorite foodsliver, onions, cauliflower.
LEADFEMALE:Good thing i brought my big purse.
LEADMALE:Well, i've always said accessories make the woman.
SUPMALE:Night, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night, kitten.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me see your hand.
LEADFEMALE:It's still pretty swollen.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, luckily, you still got one good hand so you could take out the garbage.
LEADMALE:I ever tell you you got a great bedside manner? are you coming on to me? Not tonight, baby.
LEADMALE:I can't move a muscle.
OTHERMALE:Sure you can.
LEADFEMALE:See? Ahh!whoa!oh! 
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Well, this one's called "saturday" and i hope you enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:It was one of my favorite ones in that first season because my thenmy first ex-husband bill plays a neighbor freddy who bangs his head and bill was famous in our entire marriage and in his entire life for banging his head.
LEADMALE:I remember when we were living in denver, he banged his head on the same chandelier every single day for about two years like he forgot it was there.
LEADFEMALE:So i kind of wanted him to do that on the show 'cause he was quite funny at banging his head and the facial expressions he'd make.
LEADFEMALE:So i hope you enjoy it.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan: babe, i've looked everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the good rags? They're hanging up in your closet.
LEADFEMALE:All i could find is this flimsy stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:I need substantial rags to work on the truck.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, dwight.
SUPMALE:What's up? Besides that.
LEADMALE:Oh yeah, bring the whole wrench set.
LEADFEMALE:No, we got plenty of beer.
LEADMALE:All right, see you in a few, buckaroo.
LEADMALE:Is dwight coming over here? yeah, what's wrong with that? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Just every time you're with him, your i.
SUPFEMALE:Q.
LEADFEMALE:Drops ten points.
LEADFEMALE:He's bringing his tools over.
OTHERFEMALE:He's gonna help me tune up the truck.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not gonna get that truck tuned up.
LEADFEMALE:You guys are just gonna be in the driveway, drinkin' beer and spittin' and talking about who's got the biggest hood ornament.
SUPFEMALE:Hell, honey, that's not even a contest.
LEADMALE:I know, no one can spit like you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I love watching you with dwight.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys are so funny.
LEADFEMALE:"yeah, i bet those bears are gonna kick some butt on sunday.
OTHERMALE:" yeah.
OTHERMALE:You got that down.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should come out and help us work on the truck.
OTHERFEMALE:I probably should.
SUPMALE:That's the only way you'll probably get it done.
LEADFEMALE:You and dwight have never finished nothing but a six-pack.
LEADFEMALE:Utility room is not a truck.
OTHERFEMALE:Can i embroider that on a pillow? Yes.
OTHERMALE:And you can embroider this.
SUPFEMALE:By 4:00 this afternoon, that truck will have new points and plugs and will be running like a race car.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Would you care to make a small wager? Oh, name it.
LEADMALE:Okay, if that truck ain't working by 4:00, then you got to clean this oven today and every month for the rest of your life.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:But if i win, which i will, you got to do all the snow shoveling this winter and every winter for the rest of your life.
LEADMALE:All right, you're on, buckaroo.
SUPMALE:Here you go.
LEADMALE:One peanut butter and jelly sandwich coming right up.
LEADMALE:I like it better with the peanut butter on top.
SUPMALE:There you go.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, dwight.
LEADFEMALE:Hey there, scooter.
LEADMALE:Hi, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Goodworth.
LEADMALE:What are you doing, dwight? Beer break.
LEADMALE:Well, you don't just go in somebody's house and start taking stuff out of their fridge.
OTHERMALE:Dan said i could.
SUPMALE:Well, what dan says don't matter around here.
OTHERFEMALE:He knows that.
SUPFEMALE:Did you hear that, dan? Dan: it's true.
SUPMALE:I'm merely a figurehead.
LEADMALE:I hear you're gonna be shoveling some snow this winter.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, rose, you better be nice to dwight.
SUPMALE:He said he can get you a good discount on a snow blower.
SUPMALE:You think freddy wants a beer? he's breathing, ain't he? is freddy out there, too? Got all three of us on the job now.
LEADFEMALE:Getting worried, girl? Oh, yeah, i'm shakin' in my boots.
LEADFEMALE:Don't stick your finger in there.
OTHERMALE:Tastes better that way.
LEADMALE:That's disgusting.
LEADMALE:You want me to put it back? Dan, you told me he was housebroken.
LEADMALE:I lied.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, boy.
LEADMALE:Hold on there, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, chiquita rosarita.
OTHERMALE:Is that little sister of yours gonna be around here today? what do you care? boy, can't a man ask a simple question without some woman giving him the third degree? Well, not when that man's you and the woman's my sister.
SUPMALE:What kind of crazy thoughts are rattling around in that empty head of yours, dwight? Just wanna talk to her is all.
LEADMALE:About what? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Are you thinking about asking her out? Maybe.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: on a date? Sorta.
LEADMALE:Well, forget about it, dwight.
LEADFEMALE:My sister don't date neanderthals.
LEADMALE:Why? Come on, dwight, we got a lot of work to do.
OTHERMALE:Take that beer out to freddy.
OTHERMALE:Dan.
SUPMALE:Yes, dear.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you tell me he's got the hots for jackie? News to me.
LEADFEMALE:He's not going out with my sister.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we just let them work out their own lives? 'cause it'll just mess 'em up.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie.
SUPFEMALE:Why must you mere mortals gamble with your own thoughts when you have the goddess of corn here to keep you from screwing up? Here, dad.
LEADMALE:Thanks, son.
LEADMALE:Hey, scooter, you wanna go ask your mom for some more chips? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, take it easy there, dwight.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't want you to strain yourself.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, pal.
LEADMALE:I lift with my legs, not my back.
SUPMALE:Hey, dan yeah? jackie ain't dating anybody, is she? Nobody'll have her.
LEADMALE:Hand me the screwdriver.
SUPMALE:It's pretty obvious.
LEADFEMALE:She's got a thing for me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Yep.
OTHERFEMALE:She was in my hardware store last thursday, asking me a lot of questions about those new cordless drills i got in.
LEADMALE:Yeah, those are nice.
LEADMALE:But that's not what she was shopping for, if you catch my drift.
SUPFEMALE:Dwight, you own a hardware store.
SUPFEMALE:Have you considered the remote possibility that jackie came in because she needed something? Oh, she needed something, all right.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, i forgot, you're the real expert with women.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i guess i know my way around the henhouse, all right.
LEADMALE:Yeah, probably so, since you're still living at home with your mom.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, my mom needs me.
SUPFEMALE:Yum.
SUPMALE:Well, freddy, i see you're making a heck of a difference there.
SUPMALE:You guys already got the hood up.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, we got your hardcore labor going on.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i see dwight's laboring to suck the bottom out of that beer can.
LEADMALE:Dad, can i get in the truck? Sure, go ahead, bub.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne: let me see what kind of mess you're making around here? Why, we're so far ahead, we're ready for another break.
LEADFEMALE:We already pulled the points and plugs, and now we're setting the gaps.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking motors to her for? It's a waste of breath, dan.
SUPFEMALE:He's right, dan, you know.
SUPMALE:The female mind just can't handle the complexities of the modern combustion engine.
LEADFEMALE:It's a proven fact.
SUPMALE:Right, freddy? That's right.
SUPMALE:Look at all these wires and these gizmos and thingamabobs.
SUPFEMALE:It just makes my head spin.
LEADFEMALE:It's typical.
LEADFEMALE:I say if you can't find the fan belt, you shouldn't get behind the steering wheel.
LEADFEMALE:Am i right, dan? You're on your own here, dwight.
SUPFEMALE:Tell you what i'd do with you women.
LEADMALE:I'd take all of your little licenses away and i'd put you girls on public transportation where you's belong.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm amazed you're not the governor.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't vote for ya.
LEADMALE:Damn it, don't honk that when i'm working on the engine.
LEADMALE:Sorry, mr.
LEADMALE:Meeker.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, scooter.
LEADMALE:He didn't hit anything he uses.
SUPMALE:Mom, can i ride my bike? Yeah, but ride in real heavy traffic.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha, it's so funny i forgot to laugh.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you boys pick up all your beer cans and put your little toys away.
LEADFEMALE:And when you're all done playing, you push this big, blue truck right out of the driveway.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, i'll tell you what, dan, every morning i wake up, get down on my knees and thank the good lord up above i'm not married to that woman.
LEADMALE:I think rosie's pretty much okay about that, too.
LEADMALE:If my woman ever talked to me that way, you know what i'd say to her? Yeah"get back in the house, mom.
LEADFEMALE:" hi, you guys.
OTHERFEMALE:How you doing? dan: how was the mall? Oh, it was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:We ate corn dogs by the pound.
LEADMALE:We sure did.
OTHERMALE:Dwight: hey, jackie.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, dwight.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Poor thing.
LEADFEMALE:God, i hate it when a girl embarrasses herself like that.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about, dwight? It's obvious.
OTHERMALE:The woman wants me.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so does the animal research lab.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, look at this.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne: ooh! Isn't this the sweetest thing? Marked down from 89.
OTHERMALE:99.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:This is the kind of thing men love.
OTHERFEMALE:Or you could wear a sign that said "free sample.
SUPMALE:" get out.
OTHERMALE:You see, if i wear this, i'll feel more feminine.
LEADMALE:And if i feel more feminine, i'll radiate this mysterious sensuality and men will flock to me.
LEADFEMALE:They won't know what it is, but they'll want it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, that's kind of the way they feel about chili.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, look at the ankle bracelet aunt jackie bought me.
LEADMALE:Cute.
SUPFEMALE:You know, dan bought me one of those when we first got married, and he had it engraved.
SUPMALE:It said "p.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:W.
SUPFEMALE:" i also got six colors of blush.
SUPMALE:Crystal's gonna help me find my perfect shade.
SUPMALE:Let's do it, sugar.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have you looking like a cover girl.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne: once again, the mall has turned out to be the ultimate zen experience.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, come here.
LEADFEMALE:You got to see this.
LEADMALE:Dwight's out here balancing beer cans on his head.
LEADMALE:He usually don't take his vacation till summer.
LEADFEMALE:He's doing three cans.
LEADMALE:That's hard to do.
SUPFEMALE:Well, not when you're in love.
SUPMALE:What you're witnessing is the rarely-seen primitive mating dance of the north american grease monkey.
LEADMALE:And guess who he's dancing for, sister.
SUPMALE:Hint, hint, hint.
OTHERMALE:I was down at his hardware store the other day and was following me around like a puppy.
LEADFEMALE:He's kind of cute.
LEADMALE:Cute? I bet his parents are brother and sister.
OTHERFEMALE:I could do worse.
SUPMALE:You have done worse, jackie.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe you're right, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:He is single, and he has his own business.
LEADMALE:And he's never been in prison.
OTHERMALE:I think he likes women.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when you consider the meat market in lanford, he's not so bad.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he kind of reminds me of a big ol' rump roast.
LEADFEMALE:No, there's some good raw material out there.
SUPMALE:This guy's got potential.
SUPFEMALE:With a little work, he could get whipped into shape.
LEADMALE:Look what you did with dan.
LEADFEMALE:True, but i'm a unique and incredible woman, jackie.
LEADMALE:And you're saying that i'm not? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have you know that somebody like me who is tolerant and sensitive and insane.
LEADMALE:I could show you a whole nother side of dwight.
LEADFEMALE:I could go out there right now and show you a dwight that behaves like a perfect gentleman.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right.
SUPMALE:I'll do it, too.
LEADFEMALE:You know, jackie, you really should try earth sometime.
LEADMALE:I think you might like it.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you what, fellas.
LEADMALE:You let women in as umpires, you can kiss the game of baseball right down the toilet.
SUPFEMALE:Woman: freddy, you know what time it is?! Coming, honey.
OTHERMALE:All right, fellas, i got to go.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you better run.
LEADMALE:I hear the warden calling you.
OTHERMALE:Thanks a lot, freddy.
SUPMALE:I promised beatrice i'd wash the screens this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:See ya.
OTHERFEMALE:Dwight: so long wimp.
SUPFEMALE:What time is it anyway? It's ten to four.
LEADFEMALE:Ten to four.
LEADFEMALE:Dwight, get over here and help me.
LEADFEMALE:We got ten minutes to get this engine running.
OTHERMALE:Never fear, the tool man's here.
LEADFEMALE:Help me hook up these cables.
LEADMALE:Hi, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:What's kickin'? Hey, jackie.
SUPMALE:Hi, dwight.
LEADMALE:Hey, you got all your gaps adjusted there, danny boy? Don't bother me now, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm on a roll.
SUPMALE:Dwight, get over here.
SUPFEMALE:Dwight: hey, just a second.
LEADMALE:How was your little shopping trip there, jackie? Oh, it was good.
LEADFEMALE:We hit every sale.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? bet you like those malls, huh? All them shoe stores.
LEADMALE:Jackie loves buying shoes, don't you, jackie? I do happen to enjoy it, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, the way you ladies buy shoes, you'd think y'all had six feet on every leg.
SUPMALE:Dwight, what did you do with the distributor cap? I didn't have it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you did.
SUPMALE:It's over there somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh, oh, doggone it.
LEADMALE:What's wrong? It's this darn money clip, it's nothin'.
SUPFEMALE:It keeps poking me in the leg.
OTHERMALE:Look at that, would ya.
SUPFEMALE:I'm losing all my darn money.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i guess that itty, bitty little money clip's just too much for that great, big wad of yours, huh, dwight? I like to keep my money neat is all.
OTHERMALE:Neatness is an admirable quality in a gentleman.
LEADMALE:I'm a really neat gentleman.
LEADFEMALE:Dwight, the distributor cap's not over here.
SUPFEMALE:It's somewhere else then.
SUPMALE:Where? In the garage, maybe.
LEADMALE:Oh, gee.
LEADFEMALE:I think my watch is wrong, jackie, 'cause it says it's almost 4:00.
LEADFEMALE:But it couldn't be almost 4:00.
OTHERFEMALE:'cause if it was almost 4:00, i'd hear this truck purring like a race car.
LEADMALE:It ain't over till it's over.
SUPFEMALE:You guys gonna get this tank up and rattling again? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty sorry piece of scrap iron, isn't it? you ever seen my car? that lime green convertible? Yeah.
LEADMALE:My monster.
LEADMALE:It's got a bored out 327, with dual quads.
OTHERMALE:It can do 125 m.
OTHERFEMALE:P.
SUPFEMALE:H.
LEADFEMALE:'s.
LEADMALE:No wonder your mom wears her hair straight back.
LEADFEMALE:I can't find that damn distributor cap anywhere.
LEADMALE:Did you look for it? No i was out there tearing up my garage just for the hell of it! Well, dan, you should go look in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Why would it be in the kitchen? Because everything in the free world ends up in the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:Dwight.
OTHERFEMALE:Huh? what did you do with the distributor cap? Um, far left-hand corner of the tool shelf behind the motor oil.
LEADMALE:And you know what? You got five minutes and when i find that distributor cap, you're gonna be shoveling snow for the rest of your life.
LEADFEMALE:Five minutes and 27 seconds.
LEADMALE:Darlene: mom! i'm busy! i can't get your sewing machine to stop! oh, darlene, stay away from it! don't touch anything! It's a three-ring circus around here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and dan's the dancing bear.
LEADMALE:You know, dwight, i was talking to roseanne, and i told her that i thought you were a pretty good guy.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, jackie, um you know, ever since you were in my store last week, i've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:About what? Uh, about you.
LEADMALE:Really? Really.
SUPMALE:Oh! I've been thinking maybe you'd like me to come over to your place sometime.
LEADFEMALE:We can do that.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoo.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i could give your engine a little tune-up.
SUPFEMALE:A tune-up? No, my car's okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking about your engine.
LEADMALE:Engines i tune stay tuned.
OTHERMALE:You know what i mean? Yeah, i know what you mean, dwight.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what, jackie, with a chassis like yours, it'll be a pleasure to pop your hood.
LEADMALE:What do you say? I say i think you just blew it.
LEADMALE:Hey, guy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You okay? Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:I was only asking her out 'cause she's your sister-in-law.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, man, her loss.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't i meet a guy who's interested in something other than getting his hands on my chassis? Well, jackie, i'm sure there's three or four guys like that left in the world.
LEADFEMALE:They just ain't in my driveway.
OTHERFEMALE:If i could meet a guy with half a brain, an ounce of courage, and a little bit of heart, i'd fall in love.
LEADMALE:Follow the yellow brick road.
OTHERMALE:Mom and jackie, which is my perfect shade? We put three different blushes on her cheek.
SUPFEMALE:Pick the one you like best.
LEADMALE:Oh, i like it over here.
LEADFEMALE:This looks great over there.
SUPMALE:Mom, there's no blush there.
LEADMALE:I like this middle one.
LEADMALE:That's the one crystal picked.
LEADFEMALE:It's called "pinch of plum.
LEADFEMALE:" yummy.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you put on that blush like i showed you, you'll have the boys standing in line.
LEADMALE:Thanks, crystal.
LEADMALE:Well, this has been fun, but i have to get home.
LEADMALE:Bye, dan.
LEADMALE:I'll see you, crystal.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: it's 4:00.
LEADMALE:Hark! I believe i hear a dirty oven calling you.
SUPFEMALE:It's fine, you win your stupid bet.
LEADFEMALE:But i was under a handicapyou took away my best man.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? I'm talking about the joke you played on dwight.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know how you can feel good about winning when my buddy's crushed.
LEADMALE:Crushed? You leveled that guy.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i went out there to give him every chance.
LEADMALE:He acted like a pig.
LEADMALE:I know the guy ain't exactly prince charming, but every time i've needed him, he's been there for me.
SUPMALE:He's a human being, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:He's got feelings.
SUPFEMALE:He's right, jackie.
LEADMALE:How could you turn down a guy with a lime green monster? I thought you were gonna stay out of this.
LEADFEMALE:I did, and that's why it's all messed up.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i swear, i went out there to give him a chance.
SUPMALE:A chance? a chance to look like a jerk? But he's so good at it.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead and joke.
LEADMALE:Meanwhile, my buddy's sitting out there trying to scrape his pride off the driveway.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, dan, get off it.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you didn't see the look on that poor guy's face.
LEADFEMALE:He's scarred for life.
LEADFEMALE:He'll never get over it.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, could you move your car? You're blocking me in.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i'll move it.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna give your friend dwight a ride home.
SUPMALE:He's not feeling too good, and his mother has his car.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
OTHERMALE:Catch ya later, big guy.
LEADFEMALE:Guess he got over it.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to thatpurring like a kitten.
LEADFEMALE:And it's only 10:30.
SUPFEMALE:Remember how we used to go to the drive-in every saturday night? Yeah, we'd put the kids in pajamas.
LEADMALE:Then we'd pop that big bag of corn.
LEADMALE:That was really fun, wasn't it? I can't believe they tore down that old drive-in.
OTHERMALE:And put up that incredibly beautiful mini-mall.
LEADFEMALE:The kids always fall asleep during the second feature, and we get romantic.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean you'd get romantic.
SUPFEMALE:Of course i would.
SUPMALE:You'd put your head on my shoulder, and we'd cuddle up real close, and you'd look right up there at the screen.
LEADFEMALE:Can you see it? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What are they playing? "guns of navarone.
LEADMALE:" nah, i don't wanna watch that again.
SUPFEMALE:What do you wanna watch? "doctor zee-vaygo.
OTHERMALE:" all right, i could see that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, see the snow falling and the trains pulling into the station? Yeah, she's there waiting for him.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:And he steps down off the train.
LEADFEMALE:Their eyes meet.
SUPMALE:He walks over, he reaches out and takes her hand and says, "how would you like me to pop your hood?"
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Freeze! D.j. , put that back in the box.
OTHERFEMALE:I just packed it.
SUPFEMALE:This is my laser gun.
SUPFEMALE:I know, it fried my hair.
LEADMALE:If i shoot you, your eyeballs will freeze and you'll turn into a zombie.
OTHERFEMALE:That's kind of like your dad when he watches tv.
SUPMALE:I heard that.
LEADFEMALE:Blast her, d.j. bam! ahh! good shooting, beldar! Thanks.
LEADMALE:Honey, where do you want this box? Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:Even when i'm dead you're asking me where stuff goes.
OTHERMALE:P.
OTHERMALE:T.
OTHERFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:Rummage sale's gonna love me.
OTHERMALE:Well, this house oughta be their headquarters.
SUPMALE:Why are you giving all this stuff away? We're not giving all this stuff away.
OTHERFEMALE:We're just giving the crummy stuff away.
LEADMALE:Yeah, like we oughta fold you in half and stick you in a box.
OTHERMALE:Ow!ow! Is becky home yet? Not yet.
SUPMALE:Ow!ow! One kid down, two to go, darlene.
LEADMALE:You guys are major dweebs.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, honey.
SUPFEMALE:That means so much to us.
SUPFEMALE:Get in that kitchen and rustle me up some grub, woman.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i love it when you talk like a man.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe you're gonna throw this away.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't, i was just gonna get it rebristled.
OTHERFEMALE:This was in my "to be fixed" box.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean your "talked about fixing it" box? Dear, i can only fix one thing at a time.
LEADFEMALE:And i'm still working on you.
LEADFEMALE:Kiss it goodbye, dan.
LEADMALE:I'm tired of all this junk cluttering up my house.
LEADMALE:Your house? She who cleans it, keeps it.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, a man's home is his castle.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah.

LEADMALE:Well, i'll leave you two alone.
LEADMALE:You know what?i want you to go up in your closet and throw out everything that i hate.
LEADFEMALE:That oughta keep you busy most of the day.
LEADMALE:Your every wish is my command.
LEADMALE:Really? Oh, yeah, baby.
LEADMALE:I love to serve.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now i like a guy who knows his place.
SUPMALE:Hey, is that a toothbrush in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? Don't say a word.
LEADFEMALE:What? Just come upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:What'd you do? Just come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Can i come? No.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going? Nowhere.
LEADMALE:What you doing? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:What is your problem? Don't give mom your report card.
SUPMALE:Okay, darlene, what'd you flunk? I didn't flunk anything.
SUPMALE:All right, i got a "d" in history.
LEADFEMALE:Mom said one "d" and i was off the basketball team.
OTHERMALE:That's why you can't show her your report card.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i got straight a's.
LEADMALE:Well, that's your problem.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you can't take your report card back to school until mom signs it.
OTHERFEMALE:She is gonna sign it.
OTHERMALE:But first, i'm gonna change my "d" to a "b.
OTHERFEMALE:" you can't do that.
SUPFEMALE:Watch me.
LEADFEMALE:All i have to do is match the red ink.
LEADMALE:You are nuts.
OTHERMALE:Becky, you gotta help me.
SUPMALE:No way.
SUPMALE:I'll give you my allowance.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:For a month.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe.
LEADMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:But if mom catches you, you'll be playing basketball on crutches.
LEADMALE:She's not going to catch me.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:But i want my money in advance.
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Son.
LEADMALE:Becky and darlene are up to something.
OTHERMALE:Don't be spying on your sisters.
SUPMALE:What are they up to? Something rotten.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's up to you, 007, to find out what.
LEADMALE:And you will, because your name is bond james bond.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:What is this? Cardboard box.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but it's filled with all this junk you stole from the other boxes.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, this stuff isn't rummage.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i can't help you if you're not willing to help yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, i'm dan and i'm a pack rat.
LEADFEMALE:Everything i've ever had in my life, i still have.
LEADFEMALE:And what is this? No house should be without a plastic bowling ball on a pedestal.
LEADMALE:See, it's also a decanter.
OTHERFEMALE:You're in worse shape than i thought.
LEADMALE:Dan, all of this stuff is going.
LEADFEMALE:Please just let me keep one thing.
OTHERMALE:Please, please? All right, one thing.
LEADMALE:But not that thing.
LEADFEMALE:This is my official canoga beer cuckoo clock.
OTHERMALE:It's a collector's item.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, it's got a bear that comes out on the hour and burps.
LEADFEMALE:That's the canoga bear and he doesn't burp, he growls.
SUPMALE:He burps.
OTHERMALE:He growls.
LEADFEMALE:He pops out with a beer mug.
LEADMALE:The belching bear goes.
LEADMALE:You really hate him, huh? I despise it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:The clock goes if everything else stays.
LEADMALE:Are you blackmailing me? You bet your booties.
LEADMALE:You're hopeless.
LEADMALE:Hi, sis.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Hi, aunt jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, pumpkin butt.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.

LEADFEMALE:I don't even remember buying this thing.
SUPFEMALE:I do.
LEADMALE:You got it the same time you got that hissing viper tattoo.
SUPFEMALE:You got a tattoo? Well, maybe.
SUPMALE:Can i see it? You're too young.
SUPFEMALE:Can i see it? You're too old.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, kiddo you gonna stick around and mooch dinner from us tonight? No, i have a date.
SUPMALE:Animal, vegetable or mineral? Booker.
OTHERMALE:Vegetable.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to the pinewood dinner theater.
SUPFEMALE:Booker got tickets to see this great elvis impersonator.
SUPMALE:What would you want to go see an impersonator for when the real thing is out there somewhere.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, don't start.
OTHERFEMALE:They spotted elvis just yesterday.
LEADMALE:He was in montana.
LEADFEMALE:He was trying to call ann margret from a pay phone.
SUPMALE:Dan: hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, don't make fun of the king.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, cilla, fire up the cadillac and let's go to denver for some peanut butter and bacon sandwiches.
SUPFEMALE:I can't go with you, elvis.
SUPMALE:I have to go get my hair teased.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Elvis is leaving.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:I'm leaving.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:There's no way you're gonna get away with this, darlene.
OTHERMALE:Basketball's almost over.
SUPFEMALE:All i have to do is fool mom for two more weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Shoot! What's wrong? I can't match his red ink.
OTHERMALE:Crane probably drains the blood out of stray cats to get her ink.
LEADMALE:Shh.
SUPFEMALE:What? I heard something.
LEADFEMALE:You're just paranoid.
LEADFEMALE:No, be quiet.
SUPMALE:You're dead, d.j. ! mom! Now mom's gonna come up here.
OTHERFEMALE:No kidding, zip brain.
SUPMALE:Let's ditch the pens.
OTHERMALE:I'm giving mom my report card.
SUPFEMALE:No, you can't.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i'm not the one who got the "d.
OTHERFEMALE:" why should i get in trouble for one month of your stinking allowance? did i say one month? I meant five.
LEADMALE:Deal.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: becky, darlene? Oh, my gosh, she knows.
LEADMALE:No, she doesn't.
SUPMALE:She's gonna want to know why we locked the door.
SUPMALE:Roseanne: come on, you two.
SUPFEMALE:Open the door.
SUPFEMALE:Don't make me get the tear gas.
LEADMALE:Hi! Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Why'd you lock the door? I'm so used to locking my locker at school, i guess i just did it automatically.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, what do you think, d.j. ? Lies, all lies.
LEADMALE:D.j. told you to come up here, didn't he? no, as a matter of fact, he didn't say one thing about how you jerked the door open and yelled at him, did you, d.j. ? No.
LEADFEMALE:Now i brought you girls up this box so you can fill it with stuff for the rummage sale.
SUPMALE:Love to.
LEADMALE:We'll bring it right down.
OTHERFEMALE:D.j. , quit snooping.
LEADMALE:Mom, i think dad's calling you.
SUPMALE:She's up here.
LEADMALE:Yeah, she'll be right down.
SUPFEMALE:He'swell, he can wait.
LEADMALE:You know, i don't think i really spend enough time with my lovely daughters enjoying their extremely stimulating company.
SUPMALE:You know, just hanging out and everything like that, doing really fun stuff.
SUPMALE:Mother?get a life.
LEADMALE:Hey, the girls are up to something.
SUPMALE:They got their door locked and they're acting all goofy, like you.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? I'm just fixing this here clock, mama.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll have it done within the hour.
OTHERMALE:Scum-sucking self-centered pile of male garbage! Dan, it's for you.
OTHERMALE:I buy new pantyhose, i mousse my hair, i sit in my apartment for an hour and a half, and booker doesn't show up.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe he had some kind of an emergency.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i know his emergencies.
LEADMALE:Blonde hair, blue eyes and legs up to their throat.
SUPMALE:So maybe he's giving them mouth to mouth.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? have you seen that red pen that was in here? I thought i saw it on the coffee table before.
LEADMALE:Why does he do this to me? Darlene: i'll get it.
LEADMALE:D.j. : i'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, you love it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, your pulse is racing, your heart's throbbing, and your face is all aglow.
OTHERMALE:I have malaria.
LEADMALE:Aunt jackie, it's uncle booker.
LEADMALE:I'm not here.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, i can explain.
SUPMALE:I don't want to hear about it.
LEADMALE:I-i had an emergency.
OTHERMALE:Blonde hair, blue eyes? I was on the phone with my mother.
SUPFEMALE:I was.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez, booker, you oughta take a shovel around with you when you travel.
SUPFEMALE:Her schnauzer got hit by a car and he broke his leg.
LEADMALE:Oh, get off it! I'm not lying.
LEADMALE:The dog's got a broken leg, my mom was in hysterics.
OTHERMALE:What was i supposed to do? Hang up.
SUPMALE:Booker, i'm on your side, buddy, and even i don't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, call my mom.
LEADMALE:Ask her.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, didn't you have some rummage you wanted me to fold in another room? Yes, i believe i do.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we go there now, you and i? Come on, jackie.
SUPMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:Humph.
SUPMALE:She's not mad.
SUPMALE:Could have fooled me.
LEADFEMALE:No, if she was mad, she would have left.
LEADMALE:No, she's waiting for me to come back there.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if i was you i'd wait for the smoke to clear before i went charging in there.
SUPFEMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADMALE:What do you got, dan? It's my official canoga beer cuckoo clock.
SUPFEMALE:Ugly as hell, ain't it? It's pretty ugly.
OTHERFEMALE:I just keep it around to torture roseanne.
OTHERMALE:How long are you gonna put up with him? I can't help it.
OTHERMALE:He turns me on.
SUPMALE:One of these days, you're gonna fall for a guy with something above the waist.
LEADFEMALE:Well, just 'cause you're stuck in marriage hell, you don't have to ruin my fun.
LEADFEMALE:You know, there's more to a relationship than sex.
LEADFEMALE:You and dan are fighting? i, uh can i come in now? Yeah, but you stay off my bed.
LEADFEMALE:You gonna stay mad at me all night? Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:If i was gonna lie, don't you think i'd come up with a better excuse? booker, why do you screw up all of our dates? Dates?this is the first time we've ever gone out.
LEADMALE:Right, and it's our fourth date.
LEADMALE:Jackie, you want to go out with some guy who hangs up on his mom? No, but i want to go out with a guy that shows up.
LEADMALE:I went all out for this.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a new dress, i spent an hour on my hair you did all that for me? No, i did it so i could fold clothes in my sister's bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, i'm flattered.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to feel flattered.
SUPMALE:I want you to feel lousy, like i feel.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you don't look lousy.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this dress looks very nice.
SUPMALE:Stay away from me.
LEADFEMALE:Did i mention that your hair is terrific? Stay away, booker.
LEADFEMALE:Sit.
SUPMALE:Hmm? Sit.
LEADFEMALE:Don't touch me.
LEADFEMALE:Touch.
LEADFEMALE:Don't touch me.
LEADFEMALE:Touch.
LEADMALE:Touch.
SUPMALE:Booker! I-i meani hate you.
LEADMALE:Eww, they're kissing, they're kissing! they're kissing, they're kissing! Who? Aunt jackie and booker.
LEADMALE:Are they standing up? Yes, we're standing up.
LEADFEMALE:And we're leaving now to get started on our date.
SUPFEMALE:We're a little too late to see elvis.
SUPMALE:That's putting it mildly.
SUPFEMALE:See you, dan.
SUPMALE:Where you guys headed? We're going out for a romantic evening.
LEADFEMALE:And an insanely expensive meal.
LEADMALE:I just gotta pick up my date first.
SUPFEMALE:Wipe your mouth out.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, aunt jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Time for you to go to bed now.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Ahh! Mom, you need to sign our report cards.
SUPMALE:You got your report cards today? Yeah, here, sign it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i usually like to read what i'm signing.
OTHERFEMALE:How'd you do, darlene? Pretty good.
OTHERFEMALE:Pretty good? She got a "b" in history.
LEADMALE:I thought you were gonna get a "d.
LEADMALE:" it's a miracle.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, aren't you gonna look at mine? I got straight a's.
OTHERFEMALE:That's great, honey.
LEADMALE:Aces as always.
LEADMALE:I'm going to bed.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Dan isn't that the most perfect "b" you've ever seen in your life? Never seen one quite like it.
LEADMALE:Are you guys gonna sign it? Allow me.
LEADMALE:You know, i think we should call up miss crane and thank her.
SUPFEMALE:I'll thank her for you.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute, isn't she gonna be at the rummage sale tomorrow? That's right, we can thank her in person.
LEADMALE:Maybe we can get a picture of her standing next to the report card.
LEADMALE:You guys know, don't you? know what? I didn't get a "b" on my report card.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't? No.
LEADFEMALE:I got a "c.
OTHERMALE:" on the test that brought my average up.
LEADMALE:To a "d.
LEADFEMALE:" which is what i really got on my report card until i changed it.
LEADFEMALE:So you don't have to worry about picking me up from basketball practice anymore.
LEADMALE:And i think the guilt is punishment enough.
OTHERMALE:That and being grounded for three weeks.
SUPMALE:Oh, no! Two.
SUPFEMALE:Two's good.
LEADFEMALE:She honestly thought she was gonna get away with it.
LEADFEMALE:Aah!can you believe that little stinker? Hell, i used to do better forgeries than that.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, ma'am.
OTHERMALE:You remember this clock? how could i forget it? i seem to recall you saying something about how i'd never get it fixed? No, i think what i said was if you did get it fixed you have to move out.
OTHERMALE:This'll look perfect up on the mantelpiece.
OTHERFEMALE:Now there's no way i want that eyesore where anybody can see it.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, you said i can keep one thing.
SUPMALE:And i'm it.
LEADMALE:I want the bear.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's no way that thing's going in my living room.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, excuse me.
LEADMALE:Your living room? My living room.
LEADMALE:Your living room? Yeah, my living room.
OTHERFEMALE:And you know why? 'cause you've got bad taste.
SUPFEMALE:I've got bad taste? you want to talk about bad taste? what do you call this? That's imported.
SUPMALE:I call it kindling.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, that is a genuine mexican objet d'art.
SUPFEMALE:Unlike this objet d'scrap metal.
LEADMALE:That, for your information, happens to be an authentic replica of a civil war field piece.
LEADFEMALE:It is also a cigarette lighter.
SUPMALE:Well, good, then you can use it to burn up all your ratty old underwear that you keep 'til they're two threads and an elastic band.
SUPFEMALE:Why are we always pitching my junk? What about dan, don't do that.
OTHERMALE:Your junk.
LEADFEMALE:Don'tohh! You're gonna sleep in it, mister.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, hoo-hoo! no, no! Oh, that is sad.
LEADMALE:Dan, come on! Put that field piece down.
SUPMALE:That cannon's gonna be worth money someday.
LEADFEMALE:Say goodbye to it.
LEADFEMALE:Just say goodbye.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne: oh! ahh! no! kaw, kaw, kaw, kaw! Let's go to bed.
LEADMALE:Tell me, miss hmm.
SUPFEMALE:What? will you still respect me in the morning? I'll respect you in the morning, in the afternoon, and especially at night.
LEADMALE:Hello? Dan's house of ecstasy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, mrs.
LEADMALE:Tucker.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, that's our stuff out on the front lawn.
LEADFEMALE:Just a second.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey? hmm? How much do we want for the coffee table?
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Tv announcer: the arena's filled to capacity tonight dad, who's this? The game of the year.
LEADFEMALE:The real handsome guy there? That's me.
SUPMALE:No, really.
LEADMALE:Afraid so, pal.
SUPFEMALE:That was taken the day your mom and me got married.
LEADMALE:You look young.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we got married when we were about your age.
OTHERMALE:Dad, you said the baseball game was on.
OTHERMALE:It is, this is the pre-game show.
LEADMALE:My god, you got the pre-game show, the post-game show, the halftime show, and highlights at 11.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even need the game.
OTHERFEMALE:Man cannot live by highlights alone.
LEADFEMALE:Becky! Baby, will you go up there and tell her to turn that down? what's the matter, your leg's busted? Actually, it's just a hairline fracture.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be sitting for most of the game.
LEADFEMALE:Becky! rock and roll! That does it.
LEADFEMALE:Conner's up.
LEADFEMALE:He's moving across the sideline, he breaks into a run.
LEADFEMALE:And he loses the ball to lightning fast roseanne that comes out of nowhere.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm dead.
LEADMALE:Dan, she's dead.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the guest always stays for a hot meal i always say, and i don't know why.
OTHERMALE:But anyway, your dinner's in the oven.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, this job is grueling.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you're the one that wanted to strike it rich in the newspaper game.
SUPMALE:Becky!god.
SUPFEMALE:I got it! What is it? Would you please turn that down.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to watch a game.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to learn biology.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all you need to know about biology is that the head bone's connected to the neck bone, and the neck bone's gonna be broken unless you get up there and turn that down.
OTHERMALE:Who was it? Oh, it was mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Clyde.
SUPMALE:She claims she never got her newspaper.
SUPFEMALE:That's the second time she's claimed that this week, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:You better get over there.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't.
OTHERMALE:I'm all out.
SUPFEMALE:Well, here.
LEADMALE:Take this one of me and dad's.
LEADMALE:I ain't done with that yet.
LEADMALE:Well, your daughter's in career crisis here.
LEADFEMALE:Hop to it.
OTHERMALE:I need some time off.
LEADFEMALE:Oh-ho-ho, you need some time off.
SUPMALE:I need a vacation.
SUPMALE:You need a vacation.
LEADMALE:I haven't had one day off since the day i married you.
LEADFEMALE:Sure you have.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i have not.
LEADMALE:What about our honeymoon? what honeymoon? Eighteen hours on your cousin's houseboat does not a honeymoon make.
OTHERFEMALE:I happen to recall that that was a veritable lovefest.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, we never had a real honeymoon, and you know it.
LEADMALE:It's the one missing piece in an otherwise picture perfect romance.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, are you saying that you want a honeymoon? No, i'm saying i wanna be tarred and feathered.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, babe.
LEADMALE:We got two jobs and three kids.
LEADFEMALE:We ain't got the time.
LEADMALE:Well, we could make time.
LEADMALE:I bet each of us could get a week off next month.
LEADMALE:You're really serious about this, ain't you? No, i just brought it up to complicate your life.
LEADMALE:All right nothing complicated about that.
OTHERMALE:We'll go on a honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:Where are we gonna go? Well, i'll call my cousin and see if his houseboat's free.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna go someplace romantic.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying i can't pick something romantic? Yeah.
SUPMALE:You are not romantic at all.
LEADFEMALE:I am a hopeless romantic.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you're hopeless.
OTHERMALE:I am the king of romance.
LEADFEMALE:That's because you learned it from the queen.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Are you saying that you're more romantic than i am? I most "soitenly" am.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, your royal highness, i'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:You pick a honeymoon spot, i'll pick a honeymoon spot, then we'll see which one's the most romantic.
LEADMALE:You're on, beef boy.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, rosie, what if we both wind up picking the same thing? It'll mean we're actually meant for each other.
LEADMALE:No, it won't mean that.
SUPMALE:You know what would be my idea of a perfect honeymoon? Mel gibson and a stick of butter.
LEADMALE:I'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:No, it'd be an entire month on a greek island in a quaint little house up in the mountains but not too far away from the beach.
SUPMALE:Ah, that sounds real good.
SUPFEMALE:The only thing that's missing is your husband.
LEADFEMALE:That's why it's the perfect honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene, you're late.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I got hung up at school.
SUPMALE:Two people already's been calling looking for their newspapers.
SUPFEMALE:Damn.
SUPMALE:Well, there's no need to cuss, for hell's sake.
LEADFEMALE:Bring it out.
LEADMALE:I'll help you fold them up.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:I'll fold the rest.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Sis, make yourself useful, huh? so, you gonna watch our kids when me and dan goes on our honeymoon? Sure, but you're not gonna go anywhere.
LEADMALE:So now you're reading the future, right? Now you got e.
OTHERMALE:S.
LEADFEMALE:P.
LEADFEMALE:Every time you and dan plan a trip, something happens.
LEADMALE:And you know why that is? Oh, enlighten me, swami nanda.
LEADFEMALE:Because you don't really wanna go, because you think that nobody can survive without you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they can't.
SUPMALE:Because you think you're the center of the universe.
LEADMALE:Well, things do revolve around me.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, aunt jackie.
LEADMALE:Hi, kiddo.
SUPMALE:Hey, how was school? All right, except for biology.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Hodges is making us dissect a frog in lab.
LEADMALE:I remember when we had to do that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me, too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in class with this big guy.
SUPMALE:He's on the football team.
OTHERMALE:I cut into my frog, he goes down like a ton of bricks.
LEADMALE:You know, cold faint, cuts up his chin.
OTHERMALE:Really? Ask your dad to show you his scar.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you guys may have done it, but i think it's morally wrong to hack up poor, defenseless animals.
LEADFEMALE:The frog's already dead by the time you're hacking on it, ain't it? But if i didn't have to dissect it, they wouldn't have to kill it.
OTHERMALE:If you don't wanna do it, don't do it.
LEADFEMALE:But then i'll flunk lab and bring my "a" average down to a "c.
SUPFEMALE:" becky, if you feel strongly about something, you shouldn't do it.
OTHERFEMALE:You won't get mad if i get a "c"? The only time i'd ever get mad at you is if you're doing something that you know is not right.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I got it.
LEADMALE:If that's one of my customers, tell 'em i'm already gone.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Clyde.
LEADMALE:She'll probably gonna call my boss and complain.
SUPFEMALE:Your paper should be there any minute.
SUPMALE:Okay, bye.
SUPMALE:Darlene, you better move.
SUPMALE:She sounded angry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm moving, i'm moving.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky, go wash up for dinner now.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what are we having? Frog legs.
SUPFEMALE:You're so demented.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, baby, i'm home.
LEADMALE:Hey, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, jackie.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:You gonna stay for dinner? are you serious? We'd love to have you.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with him? can't a guy have a good day once in a while? Well, not that good.
LEADMALE:What are you smiling at, hot stuff? Wellwait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:What's this in my pocket? It could be.
LEADMALE:It might be.
SUPFEMALE:It is.
LEADFEMALE:Holy cow.
LEADMALE:It's a honeymoon.
LEADMALE:Why, yes, it's paradise.
SUPFEMALE:Another guy who thinks he's got paradise in his jeans.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, paradise lost.
LEADMALE:Ahh.
LEADFEMALE:Cackle, cackle, hens.
SUPMALE:Baby, this place is perfect for us.
LEADFEMALE:It's romantic, it's secluded, and it's 400 miles from anybody who's ever seen us in our bathrobes.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:The lamont cabins, boulder lake, rhinelander, wisconsin.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna take her camping? dan: camping? We're talking luxury here.
OTHERFEMALE:These cabins got everything.
LEADFEMALE:Electricity, hot water, full kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Well, full kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, sis, that's just the getaway you've been looking for.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be dining at the lodge.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe if we're lucky, we can get a table under the antlers.
LEADFEMALE:For your information, i talked to a guy down at the lumber yard who went to this place.
LEADMALE:Said he had the time of his life.
LEADMALE:Did he say what kind of time his wife had? He ain't married went there with a bunch of buddies of his.
OTHERMALE:Geez, now, i don't have the intense lumberyard connections that you got, but i did manage to put together a honeymoon in, uh, the grand duchess hotel in sarasota, florida.
LEADFEMALE:"grand duchess resort hotel, sarasota, florida.
LEADMALE:" a-tha.
LEADMALE:It's the perfect honeymoon spot.
LEADMALE:It's warm and it's sunny.
LEADMALE:And not romantic.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? Walking hand in hand on a beach.
LEADFEMALE:That ain't romantic? Yeah, dodging seagulls and 10,000 sunburned tourists.
OTHERFEMALE:Honestly, jackie, i ask you.
SUPFEMALE:Is that romantic? Well, coffee shop's open until 9:00.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh! Well, now, whose side are you on? I'm on your side.
OTHERFEMALE:And i'm on your side.
OTHERMALE:Justjust pick.
LEADMALE:Go anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm not going there.
LEADFEMALE:There's not nothing for me to do in a place like that.
LEADFEMALE:What are you, nuts? There's plenty of stuff for you to do there.
SUPFEMALE:There's stuff for you to do.
LEADFEMALE:There's hunting, fishing, tracking moose.
SUPMALE:What am i supposed to do, forage for nuts and berries? can i make a suggestion? Both: no.
LEADMALE:Honey, i'm just not gonna feel comfortable at someplace with palm trees and marble floors.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do you think i'm gonna have fun at someplace famous for lightning bugs? There's only one way to settle it separate honeymoons.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADMALE:All right, i'll settle it.
SUPMALE:Call it in the air.
LEADMALE:Heads or tails.
SUPMALE:Florida.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, get your grubby paw out of that cereal box, would ya? I'm looking for the toy.
LEADMALE:Well, i already took it out of there, see.
LEADMALE:If you're real nice, maybe i'll let you play with it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be nice.
SUPFEMALE:Liar, liar, pants on fire.
LEADFEMALE:You know, dan, it's not too late for you to change your mind and come with me to the remarkable sunshine state.
OTHERMALE:But, honey, there won't be no sunshine in florida.
OTHERFEMALE:I won't be there.
LEADMALE:Oh, i guess then i'll just be sitting in my deluxe suite, crying out my eyes 'cause i can't share a concrete shower with four other cabins.
LEADFEMALE:I bet that's them old cabins right now wondering what color bug light you want.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene: i got it! Hey, are you all right? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Well, you just walked by a ringing phone.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, please, i have a lot of things on my mind.
SUPFEMALE:Hodges is gonna make me rip the guts out of some frog.
LEADFEMALE:Yum.
LEADFEMALE:More cereal, anyone? Yes, please.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see how any of you can eat.
OTHERMALE:Pass the milk.
SUPFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:I still don't know what i'm gonna do, mom.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna do whatever you feel is right, okay? You keep the faith.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Darlene, who was that? Oh, it was mr.
SUPFEMALE:Attleroy, my boss at the newspaper.
LEADMALE:And what did he want? He wants to see me after school.
OTHERMALE:I guess he didn't get his paper yet either.
LEADMALE:Ah! Well, mom, i did it.
SUPFEMALE:I told hodges i wouldn't cut up that frog.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i bet that frog is pretty glad to hear that.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but hodges wasn't.
LEADMALE:Thanks to him, i got a "c" on my record.
SUPMALE:You ought to be proud of that "c," becky.
SUPFEMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:You put yourself on the line for that.
SUPMALE:It's not fair.
OTHERMALE:I'm the best student in the class, and everyone else is gonna get a better grade than me.
LEADFEMALE:Than i.
LEADFEMALE:Well, nobody's gonna do better than you in english.
SUPMALE:You know, when i told hodges i wouldn't do it, all the kids cheered.
LEADFEMALE:But then two seconds later, they started cutting up their frogs.
LEADMALE:What a bunch of hypocrites.
LEADFEMALE:Well, becky, you are the best student in that class, and it's just too bad they don't give out grades for standing up for what you believe in.
SUPMALE:I still don't believe i got a "c.
LEADMALE:" becky, if you wanted an "a," you would've cut up that frog.
LEADFEMALE:But instead you did the right thing.
SUPFEMALE:The hip thing, the now thing, the happening thing, the '90s thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Then how come i feel so lousy? I think it's 'cause your body's starting to reject the "c.
LEADMALE:" where be the white whale? Arrgh! arrgh! Arrgh.
LEADMALE:D.j. , let me know if they run.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go upstairs and study.
LEADMALE:I can't afford to screw anything else up this semester.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, stick 'em up.
LEADMALE:Don't try nothin' funny, partner.
LEADMALE:Just hand me over that money.
SUPMALE:How much is this? I don't know, but it looks like a lot.
LEADMALE:What you gonna do with it? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Buy me something nice.
SUPFEMALE:What would you like? A honeymoon in sarasota, florida.
LEADFEMALE:What's a honeymoon? I don't know, i never had one.
LEADMALE:Oh, darlene, mrs.
SUPMALE:Clyde just called.
OTHERFEMALE:She said she's looked in all her puddles, and she still can't find her newspaper.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's not my problem anymore.
LEADMALE:And why is that? Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Attleroy gave me the ax.
SUPFEMALE:Well, darlene, now that you've got some free time, could i get a minute with you? can i at least get a snack before you chop my head off? No.
OTHERMALE:Sit.
LEADFEMALE:All right, start talking.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a long, boring story.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good beginning.
LEADFEMALE:Keep going.
SUPMALE:Well, i figured a paper route was an easy way to make some money.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, there's no easy way to make money.
OTHERMALE:If there was, your mother would've found it by now.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's face it, darlene.
LEADMALE:You quit on that job a long time before attleroy fired you.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i did.
SUPMALE:You did.
LEADFEMALE:All right, but i'm 11 years old.
LEADFEMALE:I figured why not enjoy myself.
LEADMALE:I can live on my allowance for a few more years.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you ain't heard about the lay-off then, huh? Me and your daddy can only afford to support two kids now.
LEADMALE:Well, who's gonna tell d.j. ? Hey, you're gonna be proud of becky.
SUPMALE:Why's that? Because she took a "c" in biology, rather than commit animal genocide.
LEADMALE:Good for her.
OTHERMALE:Hey, i got four "c"s and nobody congratulated me.
LEADFEMALE:"c"s come easy for you, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky really had to work for her "c.
SUPMALE:" well, the first one was the hardest for me, too.
SUPMALE:You know, dan, i really adore your kids.
LEADMALE:Yeah? I'd say we're three for three.
SUPMALE:You know, i think our first real try was on my cousin's houseboat.
LEADMALE:The only thing i was really trying to conceive on that houseboat was an escape route.
SUPFEMALE:You guys busy? No, we were just sitting around waiting for you to show up.
SUPMALE:You know, every time you arrive, it's the highlight of dan's day.
LEADMALE:Well, it is today, 'cause i've been spending a lot of time since yesterday thinking about your guy's honeymoon.
SUPFEMALE:You ain't going with us.
SUPMALE:On the contrary.
LEADFEMALE:You guys have been arguing about it for 15 years.
OTHERFEMALE:You're gonna spend the next 15 years arguing about it.
LEADMALE:So i've decided that since you guys weren't gonna take one, i was gonna give you one.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? I booked a suite for the weekend at wizard world.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:Wizard world.
LEADFEMALE:Home of the wacky, wiggling worm water ride.
LEADMALE:Boy, i bet you never thought we would be spending the weekend there, huh? Not weally.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie: oh, forget it.
LEADMALE:You guys aren't going.
OTHERMALE:Becky!darlene! d.j. !front and center! What are you up to? I'm running away for the weekend, and i'm taking your kids with me.
LEADMALE:You guys get to stay in the house and have your honeymoon.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean? ooh, i have to be alone with you? Ooh! a girl, ooh! And you better make the most of it, too, because this is the last anniversary present you're getting for the next ten years.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's so sweet.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, sis.
LEADFEMALE:You guys, pack your bags 'cause we're going to wizard world.
OTHERMALE:All right! Wizard world? For the whole weekend.
SUPFEMALE:Are mom and dad coming? No.
SUPFEMALE:Rosie, what are you doing? Don't you worry about it.
SUPMALE:You ready to start? I guess so.
LEADMALE:This is weird.
LEADMALE:I keep waiting for a kid to come tearing through here.
SUPMALE:Well, dan, now, we don't have any kids 'cause we're on our honeymoon.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Sit.
LEADMALE:Okay, our honeymoon has officially started.
LEADFEMALE:It has? yeah, how do you like our honeymoon suite? I like it.
SUPFEMALE:It has a nice, homey lived-in feel to it.
LEADFEMALE:Are you ready for romance? are you? I was born ready.
LEADFEMALE:Nice touch.
SUPMALE:I didn't even get to the touching yet.
LEADMALE:Now, would you like candlelight or candlelight? how about candlelight? okay, now, which one do you want? a rippling stream or a waterfall effect? Surprise me.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:There's one rippling stream.
OTHERFEMALE:That's nice.
OTHERFEMALE:A waterfall might be nicer.
SUPFEMALE:You got it.
SUPMALE:Watch out for the mist.
OTHERFEMALE:So this is the honeymoon i've always wanted.
LEADMALE:Niagara falls!
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Crystal, i'm really sorry.
LEADMALE:I don't want to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know it was gonna upsetwhat's going on? I gave her a ride to work.
LEADFEMALE:It must have been a hell of a ride.
LEADFEMALE:What'd you do, steer with your feet? No, i drove over the monument street bridge.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, you didn't! Oh, good goin', sis.
LEADFEMALE:What was i supposed to do? If we'd gone the other way, then we would've been late for work.
SUPMALE:How could you even do that? You know she freaks out if anybody even mentions the bridge.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal got some kind of hang-up with bridges? Just the monument street bridge.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, it's killer during rush hour.
SUPMALE:That's not funny, booker.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not trying to be funny.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, he doesn't know the story.
LEADFEMALE:He hasn't been here that long.
LEADMALE:What story? You tell him, sis.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, come here.
LEADFEMALE:But you guys have gotta be good.
SUPFEMALE:I will, i will, i will.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, crystal's first husband sonny was working construction on the monument street bridge.
LEADMALE:And he was pouring cement one day, and he slipped.
SUPMALE:He fell into one of the piling molds.
SUPMALE:So you mean that he fell off the bridge? Well, kinda.
OTHERFEMALE:He sort of fell in the bridge.
LEADMALE:Get out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you telling me this guy is still buried in the bridge? For the past 12 years, and it's a very sad story.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, i'm sorry, i guess i overreacted.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you okay, crystal? I'm fine.
SUPMALE:Jackie, i apologize.
LEADMALE:No, it's all my fault.
LEADMALE:No, it's my fault.
LEADMALE:Crystal, i drove over it as fast as i could.
LEADMALE:It's okay, it's all out of my system.
OTHERMALE:What's the story about your old man being, you know, part of the monument street bridge? I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Hello?cindy? Hey, hey, hey, hey! You're stretching all the natural beauty out of the phone cord.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan: babe? what time is crystal bringing lonnie over? Any second.
SUPMALE:Hey, if she starts talking about sonny at all, hurry up and change the subject.
OTHERMALE:Why is she thinking about him again? Because today, jackie drove her over the you-know-what.
LEADMALE:The bridge? You gotta be kidding me.
SUPMALE:When is she gonna get over him? She probably never will, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he was like the only guy that ever made her happy.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, sonny made a lot of girls happy.
LEADFEMALE:He did what? All i'm saying is that old sonny wasn't exactly husband of the year.
SUPMALE:So, uh what are you saying to me, dan? you're telling me that the only guy crystal ever loved was, like, running around on her? I cannot tell a lie.
LEADFEMALE:That scumbucket.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you ever tell me he done that? Because men don't talk about stuff like that.
SUPMALE:Yeah, they do, just to other men.
LEADFEMALE:Knock it off, you little twerp! Mom, darlene's still on the telephone.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't come in here ratting on people now.
LEADMALE:Dan, he's ratting on people.
LEADMALE:Cheese eater.
LEADFEMALE:Cindy, we gotta get a pack of cigarettes.
LEADMALE:Hey, get off now.
LEADMALE:Give that phone a rest.
SUPFEMALE:Hold on.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you picking on me for? 'cause i can't find becky.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta go.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Okay, bye.
LEADMALE:Are you finished with that yet? Oh, jeez, you kids.
LEADMALE:Mom, i'm going over to cindy's house.
SUPFEMALE:And yes, i'll be back in time for dinner.
LEADMALE:Oh, goody, that brainwashing's kicking right in.
LEADFEMALE:Yoo-hoo, it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, come on in, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene.
LEADMALE:Hey, crystal.
LEADMALE:Hey, lon.
SUPFEMALE:Both: hi, dan.
LEADMALE:His scout troop gave him everything he needs.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, this'll be a snap.
SUPFEMALE:You happen to be working with the a-number one super birdhouse builder of all time.
LEADMALE:The legend continues.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you and deej go in the garage and get set up.
SUPMALE:I'll get us some sodies, and be out in a minute.
LEADMALE:Lonnie: okay.
LEADMALE:Lonnie, honey, be sure to keep your jacket on.
LEADMALE:D.j. , honey, be sure not to go near the chainsaw.
SUPMALE:Well, crystal, why don't you and lonnie stay for dinner.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, i couldn't impose.
LEADMALE:Come on, you're not imposing, you're gonna cook.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Okay, bye.
SUPMALE:Hi, crystal.
SUPMALE:Hi, sugar.
LEADMALE:I'll get that.
LEADMALE:Crystal, give me a hand with these vegetables.
LEADMALE:Okay, let me wash up.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think lonnie gets to looking more and more like his daddy every day? Uh, why don't you dice up them carrots, crystal.
LEADMALE:How do you want 'em? sliced, diced, curled or julienned? uh, cut 'em up in little pieces, would you? Ever since jackie gave me a ride to work this morning, i just can't get my mind off sonny.
OTHERFEMALE:You really ought to start driving yourself to work.
OTHERMALE:Crystal: sonny was really one in a million.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he was a pretty good guy.
LEADFEMALE:He was the best.
OTHERMALE:I keep wondering how different my life would have turned out if he hadn't have died.
OTHERMALE:I could have been happy for the rest of my life.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Come here.
OTHERFEMALE:What's that for? I was just thinking about how different my life would have turned out if you'd have lived.
LEADMALE:I feel better now.
LEADMALE:I wish there was something we could do for crystal.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:She puts herself in this every six months.
LEADFEMALE:She's still in love with the guy and there's nothing we can do about it.
LEADFEMALE:Leave it to me.
LEADMALE:I'll fix her up.
LEADMALE:You know what they say: the best thing for an old love is a new love.
LEADMALE:That's beautiful, dan.
LEADFEMALE:After you read that, did you eat the cookie? Ahh.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think you're doing? what does it look like, einstein? you're gonna die, you know that? from one cigarette? Yeah, mom and dad are gonna kill you.
SUPMALE:They're not gonna find out.
SUPFEMALE:They went to the budget sale.
LEADFEMALE:They'll be gone for days.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you even care about the fact that your lungs are gonna turn brown and shrivel up? Not really.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god! mom and dad are here! You're dead.
LEADMALE:The smell.
SUPFEMALE:How are you gonna cover up the smell? That's spray starch, you ditz! Here, use bug spray.
LEADFEMALE:That's enough.
SUPFEMALE:It stinks in here.
SUPFEMALE:What is that smell? Darlene: bug spray.
OTHERMALE:Darlene and i just killed a huge spider.
LEADMALE:What'd you do, drown it? We had to use a whole can.
LEADFEMALE:It was humongous.
OTHERMALE:Well, thank god we're safe.
LEADFEMALE:Now all we have to worry about is irreversible chromosome damage.
LEADMALE:There's still bags out there.
SUPFEMALE:Will you two exterminators go get 'em, please? Darlene: we'd love to.
LEADFEMALE:Was i right, or was i right? is this a trick question? Admit it, that was one great sale.
SUPMALE:Do you think is gonna be enough there? Babe twelve for 12 dollars.
SUPFEMALE:You're never gonna see prices like these again.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, and as soon as my back's turned you're filling up my cart with all these tube socks.
LEADMALE:Well, i didn't see you holding back on the cold cream.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i need that.
SUPMALE:Eight jars? Say, give it to me.
SUPMALE:I use it to cook, see? what's in this, lead? Oh, i got you kids new leg irons.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan, look.
LEADMALE:Becky: hi, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:I found a flag for the birdhouse.
OTHERFEMALE:No red-blooded american birdhouse should be without one.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go out and start sanding the roof, okay? oh, use that number three sandpaper, okay? Okay.
LEADMALE:I gotta get going.
LEADFEMALE:My saturday's just jam-packed.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:You're in a good mood.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, i am.
LEADFEMALE:I decided to treat myself to a manicure and a wash and set.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't perchance have to do with the certain new fella i fixed you up with, would it? Oh, dan, now stop your gloating so i can hear what happened.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? It was a lovely evening.
OTHERFEMALE:He took me to a nice restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:A little italian place with the best pasta i ever had.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now skip the noodles.
LEADMALE:Let's get to the tomatoes here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the same thing happened that always happens.
LEADMALE:I spent the entire evening comparing him to sonny.
OTHERFEMALE:And i said to myself, "i can't do this anymore.
SUPFEMALE:" see, roseanne, and you said a match wouldn't make any difference.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but it did make a difference.
SUPFEMALE:I decided not to go out with men at all anymore.
LEADMALE:Well, crystal, don't you think that's a little bit nuts? No, what's nuts is bouncing from one bad relationship to another.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't need any man in my life.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing that makes me happy are the memories of sonny.
LEADFEMALE:This is all the man i need.
LEADMALE:Crystal, you're wearing your wedding ring.
LEADMALE:Yes, i am.
OTHERFEMALE:And there's a practical side to this.
LEADFEMALE:This'll keep men at bay, and keep sonny close to my heart.
SUPFEMALE:Now, if you excuse me, i'm gonna go get my 'do done.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:My god, the man's been in a bridge for 12 years and she's wearing his ring.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i think she's gone off the deep end.
LEADFEMALE:We gotta tell her the truth about sonny.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i guess she really oughta know.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you men are all alike.
LEADMALE:Either you're out running around or you're buried in your work.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, we got any more boxes? No, we're all out of 'em.
LEADMALE:Crystal, you better slow down.
LEADFEMALE:You're making me and her look bad.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go get some.
LEADFEMALE:Day's almost over.
LEADMALE:I thought you would talk to her about sonny.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to.
LEADFEMALE:When? well, i just gotta think of what to say, you know? what's there to think about? You just tell her the truth.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i'm gonna go up to her, somebody that's in a great mood.
OTHERMALE:"uh, crystal, um did you know that your husband was a skirt junkie?" well, you don't have to be crude about it.
LEADFEMALE:You justyou bring up the subject, and then you let crystal make that discovery herself.
LEADMALE:Yeah, like, "crystal, you know that husband of yours? the one that's in the bridge? How many women besides you do you think he boinked?" here we go.
LEADMALE:Uh, crystal? yes? I gotta talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:What about? About sonny.
OTHERMALE:What about him? Me and jackie were just saying that he was a great construction worker.
SUPMALE:Why, thank you, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE:Dan: hey, babe check this out.
SUPFEMALE:Pretty neat, huh? wow! Oh, where's the jacuzzi? Right there, next to the wet bar.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, you guys did a great job.
LEADMALE:Don't look at me.
LEADFEMALE:Big lon here did most of the work.
OTHERFEMALE:I just handed him the tools and you know what this needs, lonnie? what? You should paint this little tiny welcome mat right here by the door.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Hey, dan, can i borrow some of your paint? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be back in a minute.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Just try to keep d.j. out of it, okay? Okay, i'll try.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:That kid is aces.
LEADFEMALE:He is so cool.
LEADMALE:Talk to crystal yet about sonny? Um, not yet.
SUPMALE:So you didn't do it yet, huh? Dan, look.
LEADFEMALE:Whose are those? Well, they're in darlene's jeans.
SUPFEMALE:You figure it out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's go find miss darlene, tie her little tail in a knot, and ground her for six months.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:Just follow my lead.
LEADFEMALE:Get some matches.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene, come down here a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What did i do now? Nothing.
LEADMALE:I just found these in your jeans.
LEADMALE:I thought you might want 'em back.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna kill me, aren't you? No.
LEADMALE:Your father and i just want you to know you don't have to sneak around anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, honey.
SUPFEMALE:This is your house too.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome to smoke.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right, and get my face bashed in.
LEADMALE:No, we mean it.
SUPMALE:Why don't you go ahead and light one up right now.
LEADMALE:Go on, take one.
SUPFEMALE:Here let me light it for you.
LEADMALE:Is this gonna explode or something? No.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:It's gonna explode.
LEADMALE:We wouldn't blow you up.
LEADMALE:We'd never get you out of the furniture.
LEADMALE:Oh, look! She's such an adult, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you proud? Proud doesn't say it.
SUPMALE:So, how come you're letting me smoke? Because we love you.
SUPFEMALE:Right, honey? That's right.
LEADMALE:And dan, you know what the best part of her smoking's gonna be? what's that, dear? When her teeth start turning all yellow.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, ooh! I can hardly wait.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know what i'm waiting for though? what's that, darlin'? Emphysema.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, how cool! Ooh!well, we might have one problem with this though.
SUPFEMALE:Problem? Yeah, that darn iron lung, getting it through the door there.
LEADMALE:We'll keep her in the garage.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you guys are trying to do.
OTHERFEMALE:You're trying to scare me.
LEADMALE:Pretty much.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to keep ragging on me till i quit smoking.
SUPMALE:Pretty much.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, father, you're right.
SUPFEMALE:I was a fool.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never smoke again.
SUPFEMALE:Good, now get out of here before i crush your skull.
SUPFEMALE:Yoo-hoo, it's me.
SUPMALE:Hey, crystal.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Is lonnie about ready to go? Almost.
SUPFEMALE:He's out finishing his birdhouse.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal, me and dan want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Come and sit down here for a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good, 'cause i want to talk to you too.
LEADMALE:I was going through a box of sonny's clothes, and i found this photograph from that time we took that trip to merrimac caverns, remember? Yeah, we stopped off outside of belleville and had a picnic.
SUPFEMALE:And we bought those purple sno-cones.
LEADMALE:Oh, and we ate 'em in the car, and they made such a mess and we had to crystal, you okay? Well ever since jackie drove me over the bridge, i've been thinking about how things with me and sonny weren't as perfect as everybody thought.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, they weren't perfect at all.
SUPFEMALE:Hell, honey, that's not your fault.
SUPMALE:Crystal: but it is.
LEADFEMALE:I never told anybody this, but i had an affair while i was married to sonny.
SUPFEMALE:I feel so guilty.
OTHERFEMALE:I been carrying this around for years, and no matter what i do, i just can't seem to let it go.
SUPFEMALE:Well, crystal, you can't beat yourself up about it.
SUPMALE:I cheated on him.
SUPMALE:Well, you gotta get over this guilt stuff, crystal.
LEADMALE:And you gotta get over sonny.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta go on with your life.
LEADMALE:That's what i'd like to do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, that's what you gotta do.
LEADMALE:Crystal: well, i don't know if i can do this.
OTHERFEMALE:Crystal, now you want to talk to him.
SUPMALE:Go ahead, talk to him.
SUPMALE:You spent the last 12 years feeling guilty.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you want to spend the next 12 that way? No.
LEADMALE:Well, then talk to him, crystal, go on.
LEADMALE:Which one's he in? Uh, i think it's this one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe it's that one.
OTHERFEMALE:Crystal, i don't think it makes any difference which one he's in.
SUPFEMALE:Just pick one and start talking.
LEADFEMALE:I feel kind of stupid.
OTHERMALE:Just talk to him, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Tell him that.
LEADMALE:Tell him anything.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i'll get you started.
SUPMALE:Sonny it's me, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, crystali can't do this.
SUPFEMALE:He's your husband.
SUPFEMALE:I think you oughta go on.

LEADMALE:I'm still working at the plastics factory.
SUPMALE:You should see lonnie.
LEADFEMALE:He's eleven now.
SUPFEMALE:He's got your dark hair and he's so handsome.
LEADMALE:Every time i look at him, i see you.
LEADMALE:I miss you so much.
LEADMALE:There's not a day goes by that i don't think about you.
OTHERMALE:Sonny, there's something i gotta tell you.
LEADMALE:I can't live with the guilt anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:While we were married, i had an affair.
SUPMALE:It was only one time.
LEADMALE:I don't know why i did it, but damn it, i was so angry at you for running around on me.
SUPMALE:I knew about that waitress.
SUPFEMALE:And them other women too.
LEADFEMALE:It really hurt me because you're the only man i ever loved.
LEADMALE:And i still do.
LEADMALE:But i got my own life to live.
LEADFEMALE:So, i gotta let you go now.
LEADMALE:Well i'm gonna get back in the truck, 'cause it's really cold out here.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, sonny.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you.
OTHERMALE:I caught my death of cold at that bridge.
LEADMALE:Oh, doggone it, and i didn't keep up on your life insurance premiums.
LEADMALE:That's okay, dear, i left everything to you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, boy, i'm all set then.
SUPMALE:Twelve furnace filters and 18 pairs of tube socks.
SUPFEMALE:Seventeen pairs.
LEADFEMALE:I want to be buried in one.

SUPFEMALE:Baby if i kick off, will you keep all my stuff? I am all your stuff.
LEADFEMALE:You my best stuff
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:That's more like it.
LEADMALE:Mom, the bathrooms are done, but nobody can use them will grandpa gets here tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:How about we don't use them all year and then we never have to clean 'em? I found a quarter.
OTHERFEMALE:That's mine.
SUPFEMALE:I lost it.
LEADFEMALE:Finder's keepers.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, i found five bucks under your bed yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:What? Tell her, d.j. finder's keepers.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, don't tell me the maid didn't show up.
SUPFEMALE:Great news, dan.

SUPFEMALE:Ii hate you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you guys, when i get back, i wanna see this room like i left it this morning, only clean.

SUPMALE:Both: what? Ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Hey, what you reading, handsome? How to fix a cement finisher.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, i think i saw that movie, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that the one where the son hides out in the garage all weekend fixing the cement finisher to avoid his father? Don't tell me how it ends.
SUPMALE:There is no end, dan, 'cause there's no beginning.
LEADFEMALE:If hiding out's your tactic this year, it ain't gonna work.
SUPFEMALE:What tactic? i got to finish the cement finisher, don't i? Yeah, but you've been talking about doing that for the past three months.
LEADMALE:Just break down and buy a new one.
OTHERFEMALE:You got any idea how much a new cement finisher costs? No, dan, i missed this month's copy of "modern pavement.
SUPFEMALE:" haven't you ever heard of a father and son not getting along? I hear it all the time.
OTHERMALE:I'm tired of it.
SUPFEMALE:He's a sweet man.
LEADMALE:He's a little overbearing, but this family's all he has.
LEADFEMALE:And he's gonna spend the whole weekend telling me how to run it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you run this family? I mean it, rose.
SUPFEMALE:He's gonna walk in here and he's gonna tell me i'm wasting my time as a contractor.
LEADFEMALE:He's gonna say, "work smart, danny, not hard.
LEADFEMALE:" so why don't you give yourself a break.
LEADFEMALE:You handle him smart, not hard.
LEADMALE:Well, it's easier than it sounds.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry to say it, but he really gets on my nerves.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but these visits are really important to your dad, dan.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I'm being silly.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, anyway, he's only gonna be here 72 hours.
LEADFEMALE:Flies live out their entire life span in 72 hours.
SUPMALE:So maybe he'll get caught in the screen door and he'll be here forever.
LEADMALE:Hey, lover boy.
LEADMALE:I'm ready for him.
SUPFEMALE:I told you i was gonna make this weekend work.
SUPFEMALE:Bottle of gold premium, his favorite.
OTHERFEMALE:Sodium-free club soda.
LEADMALE:And here's the clincherbarq's gourmet cashews.
LEADFEMALE:Grandpa! How come they never run like that when i come home? They do, dan, it's just in the opposite direction.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:This is gonna work out great.
SUPMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:That's the spirit, honey.
LEADMALE:Remember, he's your father and he loves you, and when that fly dies, he's out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Hon, the house looks great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we should enjoy it now 'cause it won't look like this again till d.j. moves out.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, grandpa.
LEADMALE:D.j. , quit pulling.
LEADMALE:Darlene, are you sure you can handle that? No problem, grandpa.
LEADMALE:What did i tell you kids about letting strangers in the house? I am no stranger than the guy you married.
OTHERFEMALE:Rosebud! The daughter i never had.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, ed, you would've died in labor.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going, dad? Danny, danny, danny.

SUPMALE:I got something for you, grandpa.
SUPMALE:Well, i have got something for you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, do you think you could get that suitcase open? now, listen i want you to take very good care of that, all right? That is genuine camel's hair.

SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You see, that's an ant condo.
OTHERMALE:There's a little health club for them on the top floor.
SUPFEMALE:So they can bulk up and become roaches.
LEADMALE:What about me, grandpa? what about you, honey? You know.
OTHERFEMALE:Know what? grandpa, where's my present? Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I knew i was gonna forget somebody.
LEADFEMALE:Grandpa.
SUPFEMALE:There's got to be something here somewhere.
SUPMALE:Some one last thing.
LEADMALE:I justoh! See, that's a diary.
SUPMALE:You wear the key close to your heart so it won't be read by thanks, grandpa.
LEADMALE:Yours is in the mail.
SUPFEMALE:Ed, you know you don't have to bring us anything.
LEADFEMALE:As soon as you leave, we take their stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, i got a little something for you out in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Son, you don't have to get anything for me.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i told you he doesn't want that cash gift of over $10,000.
OTHERMALE:Grandpa, show me how these work.
LEADMALE:Okay, here.
LEADMALE:You see, you are under arrest.
LEADMALE:But no! Cool.
SUPMALE:Let my try.
LEADMALE:Darlene, i got a feeling you're gonna have an even nicer pair of those someday.
SUPMALE:I don't know how you two do it.
LEADFEMALE:How about it, dad? gold premium? That's the best there is.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, go pretty good with those cashews.
SUPFEMALE:Somebody's living the high life around here.
OTHERMALE:Who? Ed, why don't you just go ahead and open 'em up.
OTHERMALE:Sure, rosie, right away.
SUPMALE:Danny, how much you pay for these? Whatever it was, i'm sure it was too much.
LEADFEMALE:You know the deals my dad gets.
LEADFEMALE:When you've got friends, you never pay retail.
LEADMALE:You don't mean to tell me you actually have friends in the nut business? Nuts, cookies, candies, lighters, pens, tongs.
LEADMALE:You never pay full price for that stuff.
LEADMALE:Darlene: i got it! Take my car.
LEADMALE:Off the list price.
OTHERMALE:Right, and they also threw in a digital radio.
LEADFEMALE:And you know why? You're friends with the salesman.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, danny boy.
LEADMALE:Crystal: hey, everybody.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hope i'm not interrupting.
OTHERMALE:Crystal, you remember ed.
LEADMALE:My, my, my.
SUPMALE:Take my breath away.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, hello, ed.

LEADMALE:Roseanne, i got an emergency.
LEADFEMALE:My hair dryer's busted.
SUPFEMALE:The darn thing's supposed to have three settingscool, warm, and hot but all i could get was cool, hot, and hot.

OTHERMALE:Everybody's a contender in spring training.
LEADFEMALE:"cement finisher maintenance manual.
LEADMALE:" no, that's nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Cement finisher's acting up again.
LEADMALE:Seems to me that thing is always broken.
SUPFEMALE:Nah, nah.
SUPFEMALE:How's business, dad? Never better.
LEADMALE:I'm selling forklifts faster than they can make 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Good for you, dad.
LEADFEMALE:That's why they stick me with this punk kid who couldn't sell a life preserver to a drowning man.
OTHERFEMALE:I told the sales manager, "if i had my son with me, we could put this company right through the top.
OTHERFEMALE:" pa, i don't need you talking to no sales manager for me, dad.
LEADFEMALE:We've been over this a million times.
SUPMALE:I ain't no salesman.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, the world needs handymen, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not a handyman, dad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a contractor.
LEADFEMALE:You could be a salesman.
LEADMALE:You could be a damn good one.
SUPFEMALE:I like what i do.
SUPMALE:I didn't say you didn't.
LEADMALE:All i am saying is you got to work smart, not hard.
LEADFEMALE:Work smart, not hard.
LEADFEMALE:I'm building a business, and it takes time.
LEADFEMALE:What are you building? You're a contractor.
LEADFEMALE:What do you work, six months out of the year? Yeah we're a little slow during the wintertime.
SUPMALE:That's what i'm talking about.
SUPFEMALE:I got stuff lined up.
OTHERFEMALE:Lined up? You have a family.
LEADFEMALE:You got to line something up for this family.
SUPMALE:I take good care of my family.
OTHERMALE:I know you do, son.
OTHERFEMALE:No, you don't know.
OTHERMALE:You don't know.
LEADMALE:I ain't a salesman.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a contractor.
OTHERFEMALE:And let's drop it.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye-bye, ed.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye, sugar.
SUPFEMALE:You keep drinking that water.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene: grandpa, i can't find the key for these handcuffs! They don't need a key.
OTHERMALE:I'll show you again, but this is the last time.
LEADMALE:What did he do? He did exactly what i said he was gonna do.
SUPFEMALE:He's not here five minutes and i'm a handyman who can't support his family.
LEADMALE:Well, dani don't wanna talk about it, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:He just better stay the hell outta my way this whole visit.
SUPMALE:I don't care if i ever see him again.
SUPFEMALE:I guess i really messed things up this time, huh, rosie? Yeah, ed.
SUPMALE:It's all over your shoes.
LEADMALE:Here, ant.
OTHERFEMALE:Come and get it.
LEADFEMALE:What are you guys doing? Me and d.j. 's trapping ants for his ant condo.
LEADMALE:We put jelly on bread, grandpa.
OTHERFEMALE:When the ants come out, we smash 'em over the head with a two-by-four.
LEADMALE:Same way i caught dan.
SUPFEMALE:Where is danny boy? I thought for sure he'd be out here.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he went out for a glass of coolant.
SUPFEMALE:He's really got some temper, huh? Only on special occasions.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? Somebody's got to stay in here and catch these ants.
SUPMALE:You can.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Got a great kid there.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, he's great when he's not rotten.
OTHERMALE:There's no such thing as a rotten son, rosie.
LEADMALE:They're too precious.
LEADMALE:I don't know about mothers and sons, but with fathers and sons a father looks at his son, and he sees every mistake he ever made.
LEADMALE:He just wants to put him on some kind of path where he won't make those same mistakes.
LEADMALE:But, edno, a father and a son you see what would've, what could've, what should've been.
LEADMALE:Eded, when you're on the phone, do you ever use the top half? Oh, oh, yeahyeah, i run off at the mouth sometime, but so do you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but when i speak, i'm speaking for all of womankind.
LEADMALE:What does all of womankind know about fathers and sons? All i was doing was giving danny a little fatherly advice.
LEADMALE:But that's the thing about fatherly advice.
LEADFEMALE:It's a give-and-take kind of thing.
LEADMALE:You can only give it so much before the kid can't take it anymore.
LEADMALE:Yeah, butyeah, butboth: you knowyou should go talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:Talk to him, yeah.
LEADMALE:The world's still out there? hey, danny, you remember 1962, wrigley field, opening day? You were there.
SUPFEMALE:Who's on the mound? The pitcher.
LEADMALE:You don't know, do you? It's a big guy, right-hander.
OTHERMALE:I really can't think of his name.
LEADMALE:Neither can i.
SUPMALE:I once had this fight with this guy, earl veltoff.
LEADMALE:He and i were partners out in des moines for three weeks.
LEADMALE:He had the most annoying habit.
LEADMALE:He used to suck his teeth.
OTHERMALE:Cardwell was on the mound, don cardwell.
LEADFEMALE:That's the guy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we almost got a foul ball.
LEADMALE:This close.
LEADMALE:This close.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:We would've had it, too, if you hadn't been yakking to the people behind us about the invention of the forklift.
LEADFEMALE:You know what this is like, danny? This is like ants.
LEADFEMALE:What's like ants? what the hell are you talking about? You and me.
SUPFEMALE:When an insect threatens an anthill, the ants instinctively protect those they're related to.
SUPFEMALE:That's nature.
OTHERMALE:That's life.
OTHERMALE:That's dinner.
LEADFEMALE:See ya.
SUPMALE:Hey, danny.
LEADMALE:What? I came here to square things with you.
OTHERMALE:Why are you making it so tough? We're square, pop.
LEADFEMALE:Cardwell was knocked out in the first.
OTHERFEMALE:Who did they bring in? Bob buhl.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that was a year.
SUPFEMALE:Pass the potatoes, please.
LEADFEMALE:If something almost happened in do beets stain your teeth? We were on the road to memphis.
LEADFEMALE:You were about three years old, dannyyou remember? Vividly.
SUPMALE:It was raining cats and dogs.
LEADMALE:The windshield wipers, they're working like a charm.
SUPFEMALE:I said to your mother, "audrey, i'm gonna revolutionize the automobile industry.
SUPFEMALE:" an idea as simple as a hula hoop, as practical as a paper clip.
LEADMALE:Who knows what it is? mud flaps? No.
SUPFEMALE:That's pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:But now see, try to think about the rear of the car.
SUPFEMALE:Ed, the only thing i can think of that you do in the rear of a car, i know you didn't invent it.
LEADFEMALE:Rear windshield wipers.
LEADMALE:Give this young lady you invented rear windshield wipers? Could've, should've, would've.
LEADMALE:Boy, i'm telling you.
LEADFEMALE:But your mother, she had to have a rest stop.
LEADFEMALE:Well, casting no aspersions, she was eight months pregnant at the time.
LEADMALE:She was a little incontinent.
LEADFEMALE:So we stop, and i lose my train of thought.
LEADMALE:It wasn't until two years later till i see a pair on the back end of a chrysler imperial i remember i invented 'em.
SUPFEMALE:This close, danny.
SUPMALE:This close.
LEADMALE:I learned my lesson.
OTHERFEMALE:You got to grab your opportunities when they come by.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, pass the beets, please.
SUPMALE:Well, do they? do they what? Stain your teeth.
SUPMALE:Teeth, let me tell you about teeth.
SUPMALE:Dad.
SUPFEMALE:The most beautiful teeth i ever saw were on a movie star.
LEADMALE:Esther williams.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, we've already heard this story.
LEADMALE:I haven't.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i'd like to hear it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, great.
SUPFEMALE:Tell it.
LEADFEMALE:You're in san diego.
LEADFEMALE:It's 1951.
OTHERMALE:Bobby thompson's home run.
LEADFEMALE:Shot heard 'round the world.
LEADMALE:Let him tell it.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Mgm's making a movie down in san diego, see.
LEADFEMALE:And guess who's down there.
OTHERMALE:Esther williams.
LEADFEMALE:Give the young lady well, then what happened? Ask your father.
LEADFEMALE:You're in the coffee shop.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I was in the main dining room.
LEADFEMALE:I turned aroundhe's gonna tell it.
LEADMALE:He's gonna tell it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, dan, it's not like we haven't heard your stories 30 times.
SUPMALE:What stories? Oh, come on, dan.
LEADMALE:How many times have i listened to the incredible story about how you were the first customer ever at the new supermarket? I'll tell ya, dan, if you don't wanna hear my stories, you don't have to hear my stories.
LEADMALE:As a matter of fact, you can freeze in hell before you hear another one of my stories.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Come on, sit down! Dan, cool it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:I got us into this, i'll get us out of it.
SUPFEMALE:Ed, you're half right.
LEADFEMALE:You got us into it, and i'll get us out of it.
LEADFEMALE:Dan the statute of limitations on parental crime runs out when you're about 30.
LEADMALE:So he didn't invent the rear windshield wiper.
LEADMALE:That's not it.
LEADFEMALE:So he never really met esther williams.
LEADMALE:It's not the windshield wipers.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not esther williams.
LEADMALE:It's his fork.
LEADFEMALE:What? He holds his fork the same way i do.
SUPFEMALE:I hold my fork the same way he does.
LEADMALE:I'm him.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're reading a little bit too much into silverware.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sitting there at the kitchen table, honey, and i'm watching him and i'm listening, and it's me, and i hate it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know, dan, if you didn't know ed conner and you just bumped into him, you'd go have a couple of beers, and you'd talk about baseball, and he'd probably sell you a forklift.
LEADMALE:You know what scares me the most? When he was 36 years old, he was right where i am today.
LEADMALE:That's me down the road.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's him.
LEADMALE:Those are his choices.
OTHERMALE:That's ed.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i got a broken-down truck.
LEADMALE:I got a broken-down cement finisher.
SUPFEMALE:I hear myself telling the same damn stories 12 times.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm not saying you're not boring.
LEADMALE:You're just boring in a different way than your dad.
LEADFEMALE:It's genetic.
SUPMALE:It's in the genes.
OTHERFEMALE:You see him, you get me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe that's why i like him.
LEADMALE:You know, he has that certain virile conner charm, you know.
SUPMALE:Come back in there with me, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we might be missing a good story.
LEADFEMALE:Allow me to introducemaking yet another appearance at our dinner tablethe lovely, the indefatigable mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan conner and his lovely wife tammi.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where were we? I asked for the potatoes, and you hit the road.
LEADFEMALE:Ask him for the carrots and see what happens.
SUPFEMALE:Carrots.
LEADMALE:I hate carrots.
LEADFEMALE:You know why? Tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Would you stop hogging all of these blankets? blankets? Let me tell you a little something about blankets.
SUPFEMALE:I came this close to inventing the blanket in 1969.
LEADFEMALE:It was right after woodstock.
LEADFEMALE:And a guy named navajo joe up to me and he says, "i already invented the blanket.
LEADFEMALE:" so he took it away from me.
LEADMALE:Wasn't it? Woodstock.
LEADFEMALE:Who was on the mound that year? Fergie jenkins.
LEADMALE:Boy, what a set of chompers he had.
SUPFEMALE:You talk about teeth.
LEADMALE:But he went plumb midget on me.
OTHERFEMALE:And he went and sunk all his money into what you call a hair dryer stock.
LEADFEMALE:He tried to invent a five-speed, four-door mix hair dryer, and he lost all his dough.
SUPFEMALE:Then he couldn't do nothing about it.
SUPFEMALE:So i ups to him and i says, "fergie, what the heck do you know about hair dryers anyway?" he goes, "well, it gets windy in chicago.
SUPMALE:" i said, "chicago?" "yeah, i was almost in the band chicago.
LEADFEMALE:I used to mix their sound tracks for 'em, but i couldn't quite get it, see.
LEADMALE:" ahh good night, ed.
LEADMALE:Night.
LEADMALE:Night.
LEADMALE:What the hell do you know about night? I was almost on the edge of night one time, except i got my foot cut off in vietnam, and i couldn't quite make it to the audition.
LEADMALE:And the cabdriver didn't speak english, so he didn't knowshut up! I was shut up in a cave one time.
LEADMALE:The meramac caverns just south of st.
SUPMALE:Louis.
LEADMALE:It was me and three other guys.
LEADMALE:Becky: mom, we're watching shock theatre.
LEADMALE:Dad said it's really scary.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can turn out the lights and burn some candles.
LEADFEMALE:You want the neighbors to find out we're devil worshippers? Dad said i could watch shock theater.
LEADMALE:Oh, he did, did he? Me and my man are gonna get shocked.
LEADFEMALE:Over my dead body.
OTHERFEMALE:Before the night is over, we'll be up to our necks in dead bodies.
LEADMALE:D.j. , you don't want to watch all that scary stuff.
LEADMALE:That'll give you nightmares.
LEADFEMALE:No, it won't.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, they give me nightmares.
LEADFEMALE:Hey dad, we gonna work on the boat tomorrow? You bet.
LEADFEMALE:I figure we can put in a couple of ribs, and get 'em sanded down real good.
LEADMALE:Gee, i only wish you were as interested in your homework as you are in working on that damn boat.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i do my homework.
OTHERMALE:Get off my back! I got dibs on the couch.
LEADFEMALE:You're not hogging the whole thing, lard butt.
SUPFEMALE:Becky: hey deej, can i have the salt? Hey, you.
LEADFEMALE:Who, me? Yeah.
LEADMALE:What do you think you're doing, letting him stay up late to watch all this trash? Honey, this is classic trash.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, i wasn't that much older than the lad there when i saw my first shocker.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and look what happened to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Knock it off, count.
LEADMALE:Besides, i'm gonna be sitting next to him the whole time.
SUPFEMALE:He's probably gonna fall asleep before the first commercial.
OTHERMALE:What are you worried about? I'm worried he's gonna be sleeping between us for the next two weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:It's starting, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, we need you.
SUPMALE:D.j. , wake up, it's starting.
LEADMALE:Sorry, babe, kids want vampires.
SUPFEMALE:Mob rules.
LEADMALE:Instead of watching the thing that wouldn't die, on the thing that wouldn't die, why don't we all do something together? We are doing something together.
OTHERFEMALE:I wonder what people did before television.
LEADFEMALE:They made dolls out of corn cobs, and stared at fire.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene: mom? what's the matter? I don't feel so good.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:You have a headache? No.
LEADFEMALE:Or a stomach ache? No.
SUPFEMALE:You worried about making the mortgage payment? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:Well, you don't have a fever, so i guess you're not gonna perish in the night.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't get back to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Did you have a nightmare? Maybe.
LEADMALE:Was it in turn-ofthe-century vienna? No.
OTHERMALE:What was it about? I can't remember.
SUPMALE:Darlene, don't you think you're a little old for this? I don't want to go back to my room.
LEADFEMALE:Can't i stay here, just for a little while? just until i fall asleep? Oh, you don't want to sleep here, honey.
OTHERMALE:Trust me.
LEADMALE:Daddy doesn't even like sharing the bed with me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i know.
LEADFEMALE:I got a better idea.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, i'll take you back up to your room.
LEADMALE:Dan? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Remember how you said you'd be responsible for whatever happened tonight? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene's up, and she can't go back to sleep.
OTHERMALE:So all you gotta do is take her back up to her room and get her a drink of water.
OTHERFEMALE:Tuck her in and make sure she gets back to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:All right, honey, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think i can fall asleep.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to tell you the story about how i met daddy? That might do it.
SUPMALE:Can't i sleep on the couch? No.
SUPMALE:Darlene, your nightmare's not gonna come back.
LEADFEMALE:And even if it does, you know where to find me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in the book.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna fall asleep.
LEADMALE:Tell me what you dreamt about, honey.
LEADMALE:You might feel better if you talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:It was scary.
OTHERFEMALE:Dreams are nothing to be afraid of.
LEADMALE:It's just when you're asleep, there's this part of your brain that just sits around telling stories.
OTHERMALE:You mean like grandpa? Tell me what you dreamt.
LEADMALE:No, forget about it.
LEADMALE:I don't want to.
SUPFEMALE:Are you okay, honey? I guess.
LEADMALE:Sure you are.
LEADMALE:You just lay here and close your eyes, and you'll be asleep in no time.
OTHERMALE:Mom! What? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Do you want me to stay here with you for awhile? Okay, move over.
LEADMALE:Okay, lift up your head here.
LEADFEMALE:Close your eyes.
SUPMALE:Give me this damn thing.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:So it was the spring of 1971.
LEADFEMALE:And i'm coming out of school, and there's this like really great-looking guy standing there, you know.
LEADFEMALE:And he's wearing this really cool varsity jacket and everything.
LEADFEMALE:And he's cussing out his motorcycle, you know, 'cause it wouldn't start.
LEADMALE:So i go over there and darlene? then what happened? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Go back to sleep! Becky: do you know what the absolute most grossinating part of the movie was? No, but i got a feeling i'm gonna find out.
LEADFEMALE:Definitely when the vampire threw up after eating the judge.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to eat breakfast! Would you shut up about the stupid movie? what is your problem? Your face.
LEADMALE:What's with her? She had a rough night.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo! Great morning, huh? Shut up.
SUPMALE:I can't wait for aunt jackie to get her to do my hair.
SUPMALE:Can i watch? Just stay out of the way.
LEADMALE:How come you're still in your nightgown? I'm waiting to go to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't you sleep last night? No.
LEADFEMALE:I slept great.
SUPMALE:I bet you did.
LEADMALE:You had that great, big bed all to yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Where were you? I was upstairs ghostbusting.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, babe, you should have woke me up.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why didn't i think of that? d.j. have a nightmare? I don't know, i was too busy dealing with darlene's.
OTHERMALE:Darlene had a nightmare? That's what she said, but it just seems like something else was going on.
LEADFEMALE:Why does it have to be something else? Kids have nightmares.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and i bet watching schlock theater didn't help.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i once had a nightmare for an entire month.
OTHERMALE:It was the single most frighteninggod, when i think of it even now.
LEADMALE:I used to have this cup.
OTHERMALE:And on the side of the cup was a decal of an airplane.
OTHERFEMALE:And every time i started to take a drink, the top of the cup would touch my nose and the propellers would start up, and the airplane would get going, and i swear this is true, it flew right up my nose.
LEADFEMALE:You're scary.
LEADFEMALE:I know it doesn't sound like much now, but you didn't see the size of the propellers.
LEADMALE:Dan, this is no ordinary airplane-up-the-nose nightmare.
LEADFEMALE:This is darlene.
LEADMALE:When was the last time she didn't make it through the night? And she refused to go back to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I was up there all night with her.
SUPMALE:Hey, big d.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dad.
SUPFEMALE:What time's your basketball game? 1:30.

SUPFEMALE:Mom, this is very important.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, i'll be right back in a minute.
LEADMALE:Honey, listen to your weatherbeaten old skipper of a father.
SUPMALE:Nightmares can really depress you.
LEADMALE:I know, 'cause when i was a kid, and i shudder even thinking of this now, i had a recurring nightmare.
SUPFEMALE:And it happened in broad daylight.
LEADMALE:The most terrifying dreams can happen during the daytime.
LEADMALE:Did you know that? Because they're so real.
OTHERFEMALE:This one was a beaut.
LEADMALE:I used to have this little cupan airplane flew up his nose.
SUPFEMALE:You don't want to hear it.
LEADMALE:I was just trying to explain to the child that i know how terrifying nightmares can be.
SUPMALE:Can everybody shut up about nightmares? I didn't have a nightmare.
LEADMALE:Then why'd you have trouble going to sleep? are you worried about your basketball game? No, i wasn't worried about my basketball game.
LEADFEMALE:Did you screw up in history again, darlene? No, i didn't screw up in history again.
SUPMALE:Then what is the matter? I got my period, okay?! Hi, sis.
LEADMALE:Hey, jackie.
LEADMALE:Welcome to you wash, we pay laundromat.
LEADMALE:You think the only reason i come over here is to do my laundry? No, i think you come over for the free coffee too.
LEADMALE:Get outta here! Hidden scent.
LEADMALE:All right, what do you guys think of this outfit to go rollerskating in? I think that that would look great with your hair swept up.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Chip loves my hair like that.
SUPMALE:Well, not too up though 'cause i don't want nobody mistaking you for some kind of cocktail waitress.
LEADMALE:Mom so, what's new? Darlene got her period last night.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:She's only 11.
SUPMALE:Well, i was only 11.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but you were already wearing a "d" cup.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, two of 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie: so, i guess she's pretty upset, huh? Yeah, and i wish she'd talk to me about it.
SUPMALE:Give her some time.
LEADFEMALE:Poor kid's just been sentenced to 35 years of monthly inconvenience.
LEADFEMALE:Well, gee, jackie, i only hope i can find a way to impart that enlightened viewpoint onto my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:You will.
LEADMALE:Just tell her about all these famous athletic women types and how they all get their periods too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, why didn't i think of that? Well, no matter what you tell her, it's gonna be better than the way mom handled it.
LEADMALE:Remember she told us if we had any questions to feel free to ask the school nurse.
LEADFEMALE:Right? So whatwhat aboutshe brought pamphlets home from the red cross.
LEADFEMALE:For two weeks i thought what i had was a national disaster.
LEADFEMALE:Well, to mom, it was.
SUPMALE:When i got mine, she cried for three days about how she'd lost her little baby.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well you had it easy, sis.
LEADMALE:'cause i had to break that woman in.
LEADMALE:She was a basket case.
LEADMALE:She almost ruined the whole thing for me.
SUPMALE:You were so weird.
SUPFEMALE:It's like you were looking forward to it.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i was finally doing something that mom couldn't control.
OTHERMALE:Besides, it meant i wasn't gonna get any more nancy drew books for my birthday.
SUPMALE:I was just trying to find a cure for it.
OTHERMALE:It's not a disease.
LEADMALE:I know it's not.
LEADMALE:But it felt like it.
SUPFEMALE:I thought i couldn't go swimming anymore, and i couldn't horse around with the boys anymore like i used to.
SUPMALE:I bet that's exactly the way darlene feels right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i bet it is too.
LEADMALE:I wish there was some way to tell her, even if she doesn't feel like it now, this is really something to celebrate.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:She's finally becoming a full-fledged member of the woman race.
OTHERFEMALE:And here comes our newest member.

LEADFEMALE:That's the kind of woman she wants to be.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's not the kind of woman i want to be.
OTHERFEMALE:Then what are you throwing all your stuff away for? These are a girl's things, darlene, as long as a girl uses 'em.

SUPFEMALE:So you're squaring the deal by serving them my famous marinated swordfish.
OTHERMALE:Well, you never know, sis.
LEADFEMALE:Bonnie and edgar could be family someday.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, chip and becky are only in the eighth grade.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they've been going together six months.
SUPFEMALE:That's-that's pretty much longer than you've ever gone out with anyone, isn't it? are they here yet? Yes, i believe asquith has shown them into the study where they're sipping absinthe and playing billiards.
LEADMALE:Should i put out the good dishes? Nah, let's just go ahead and break down and use paper plates with divisions.
LEADFEMALE:I'll put out the good dishes.

LEADMALE:And you're gonna do the stupid dishes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i do believe that my work here is done.
OTHERMALE:Lady conner.
LEADFEMALE:You're dismissing the help for the evening? I'd stay but my french maid costume's at the cleaners.

SUPMALE:Mom? Mom.
LEADMALE:What is it, darlene? Well, there was laundry on your bed, so i put the coats on your chair.
LEADFEMALE:I hope my beeper didn't fall out.
LEADMALE:I was perfectly willing to put it in my purse.
LEADMALE:Your purse is in the car.
LEADMALE:The car is locked.
OTHERFEMALE:The alarm's not working.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, just smack her, edgar.

SUPMALE:It didn't get very good reviews.
LEADFEMALE:Well, neither did bloodthirsty 1, but you saw that 14 times.
LEADMALE:Okay, i'll go.
OTHERMALE:I hear during the prom scene, they use a human liver.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, everybody ready to eat? Becky: yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Good, i just turned the oven on, so it'll cook a lot faster that way.
OTHERFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:More than a week in hawaii will drive you crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody says aloha.
LEADMALE:Both: aloha.
LEADMALE:Edgar: that's all they ever say.
OTHERFEMALE:Aloha this, aloha that.
SUPMALE:Hey, it means hello, it means goodbye.
OTHERMALE:What else does it mean, honey? I know it means love.
LEADMALE:I think it means "potholder" too.
LEADMALE:Oh, tell them about our guide, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan, dan, you've gotta hear this.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, this is wonderful.
SUPMALE:A publisher friend of ours swears it's a book.
SUPMALE:Well, just give us the cliff notes.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we order in a pizza? No, it's time.
LEADMALE:Need help out there in the kitchen, babe? Oh, that's so sweet of you to offer, honey, but you just stay here.
OTHERMALE:Aloha.
LEADFEMALE:Our guide's name was michael ho.
SUPMALE:Of course, his hawaiian name is mika hila.
SUPMALE:Ah, yes.
LEADMALE:Mika hila ho.
LEADFEMALE:Um did you know that when swordfish cooks, it shrinks? Of course, when it's burned it practically disappears.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, for crying out loud, honey, let's just eat it burnt.
OTHERFEMALE:Burned? I can have hamburgers in ten minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Twenty, if you want 'em cooked.
LEADMALE:Hamburgers are fine.
OTHERMALE:This'll be our red meat day.
LEADMALE:We could've had hamburgers an hour ago.
LEADMALE:I hate this house.
SUPFEMALE:Tell becky i need her to help me.
LEADMALE:She's not up there.
OTHERFEMALE:Where is she? If she's smart she went out to dinner.
OTHERMALE:Quiet, you! becky! Nice going, beck.
OTHERMALE:You got out of the house.
LEADFEMALE:The hard part's over.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry you can't come in.
LEADFEMALE:My parents have people over.
SUPFEMALE:No prob.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, want to go to a party tomorrow night? Yeah, that'd be great.
LEADMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:I'll pick you up at seven.
SUPMALE:Seven's great, johnny.
OTHERMALE:Think it'll be cool with your parents? My parents are very cool.
LEADMALE:They don't tell me what to do.
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Becky, get your butt in the house now! Mother? Now.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne conner.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:So, how long's becky grounded for? what'd she do? She forgot to gag darlene like i told her.
LEADFEMALE:She snuck out last night to meet the make-out king.
LEADMALE:Chip's the make-out king? Forget chip.
LEADMALE:He's old news.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, why don't you use your mouth to eat? who is the make-out king? You are, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Johnny swanko.
LEADFEMALE:He's a sophomore.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he kisses like a senior.
LEADFEMALE:I get the feeling i'm not totally filled in on everything around here.
LEADMALE:Becky's got something going with another guy.
LEADMALE:What kind of "thing"? I don't know, dan, but i caught 'em out by the garage last night.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you tell me? 'cause there's lots of stuff i don't tell you, honey.
SUPFEMALE:That's the glue that keeps our little family together.
LEADMALE:Oh, johnny, oh, johnny oh, johnny, oh, johnny.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to hear more about this johnny.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he wears a black studded belt, and they call him, "the tongue bandit.
SUPFEMALE:" darlene, why don't you leave and come back when you're about 40? Okay, great.
LEADMALE:I'll go over to johnny's.
LEADMALE:Great, we'll go over to johnny's.
LEADMALE:Drop dead.
SUPFEMALE:So i thought chip was becky's main squeeze.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i guess when you're 13 you need more than one squeeze.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to say that what you did to me last night was totally uncool.
LEADMALE:And if i were your mother, i would never do that to you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, do me a favor and enlighten me.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, let's just drop it.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:I want to know, what's your definition of cool? is that to make a date with chip, and then turn around and make a date the very same night with johnny angel? His name is johnny swanko.
SUPMALE:Whatever.
SUPMALE:Come on, just answer my question.
SUPFEMALE:It's none of your business.
OTHERMALE:It is my business when you start sneaking out of this house to meet some guy that i would consider leaving your father for.
LEADFEMALE:You know becky, what you did is gonna make it to zit magazine's ten most vicious teens.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, i was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Well, are you dating chip or not? Yes, i like chip.
SUPMALE:How would you like it if chip met some other girl in his driveway? Chip can do whatever he wants.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'll remember that when you're sitting there crying your eyes out 'cause chip sat next to some other girl on the bus.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, why didn't you tell us all this before we invited the lunts over to dinner? Because mom had already invited them.
SUPMALE:Plus you guys love chip, plus if you knew i was going out with johnny you would have freaked.
LEADFEMALE:There's no way you'd let me go out with him.
OTHERFEMALE:You got that right.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to get on the phone, you call "the tongue bandit," and tell him you ain't going nowhere tonight, not even out to the garage.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, it's my life.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you just butt out? We're trying to teach you how to do the right thing.
OTHERMALE:You guys are real hypocrites, you know that? I mean you're always saying how you're the coolest, hippest, most with it parents, but you're not.
LEADMALE:You're just like everyone else's parents.
LEADFEMALE:You're bogus.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dan bogus.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne "hypocrite" bogus.
LEADMALE:So nice to meet you.
SUPMALE:I've heard so many good things about you.
OTHERMALE:Not.
OTHERFEMALE:So.
OTHERFEMALE:So.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't we vow to become the world's most hippest parents? Well, babe, that was in the '70s.
SUPMALE:Our groove was in a more mellow bag.
LEADFEMALE:We swore that we would treat our kids differently than our parents treated us.
LEADFEMALE:I think we have.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:We made a snap judgment about this johnny guy, just exactly like my parents would have done.
LEADMALE:That wasn't no snap judgment.
LEADMALE:The guy's a punk.
SUPMALE:You didn't even see him.
LEADFEMALE:I trust your judgment.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's just the point, dan.
LEADMALE:It's not up to us to judge.
LEADMALE:My dad thought you were a punk.
LEADFEMALE:I was! That's how come i know this guy's a punk.
LEADMALE:Well, like it or not, we are now the parents of a teenager, and we are not the hip parents we said we were gonna be.
SUPMALE:Define hip parents.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:"sure, honey, johnny can stay over.
SUPMALE:Me and daddy can like, crash out on the floor.
LEADMALE:You guys can use our bed.
LEADFEMALE:" that's the kind of parent i thought i wanted to be.
OTHERMALE:Well, we ain't them, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we ain't robert young and jane wyatt either.
SUPMALE:Well, who are we? Well, we ain't bonnie and edgar.
LEADMALE:Aloha.
SUPMALE:Aloha.
OTHERFEMALE:Who do we want to be? Well, i want to be the kind of parent you know, that can trust our kids.
SUPMALE:Oh, we want to be the kind of parents that can look a kid dressed like johnny swanko and not think that he's only got one thing on his filthy little mind and we both got a pretty good suspicion of what that one thing is.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well you were kind of a punk, and i was pretty innocent when we went out on our first date, remember? You sure did.
LEADMALE:Becky well, i think we're doing the right thing.
SUPMALE:You know what? I think we're doing the right thing too.
LEADFEMALE:What now? Your mother and i have come to a decision about the swanko situation.
LEADMALE:Can i go out with him? Not in a million years.
LEADMALE:Where you going? To get the paper.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? Something is about to occur, that's gonna make you wish you would've woke up as a different person, in a different house, in a different country, on a different planet.
OTHERMALE:Croissants! It's called ganga.
SUPFEMALE:It's an herb from tibet.
LEADMALE:What region is it from, honey? The venesta region-it's up north.
LEADMALE:Well, you can make everything from ganga.
LEADMALE:Edgar: they make tea from ganga-and those wafers.
SUPMALE:Bonnie: ganga folis-they're so delicate.
LEADMALE:Mmm, they make bread from ganga.
SUPFEMALE:They even make wine from it.
LEADMALE:So, is that where you guys so all your shopping? We wish.
OTHERMALE:So do i.
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:Here, mom.
SUPMALE:Add these.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's just what these triple-fudge brownies need: more chocolate.
LEADFEMALE:What are the other girls bringing to the slumber party? insulin? Mother, please.
LEADMALE:Hey, beck, check it out.
LEADMALE:What is it? It's an 8-track.
LEADFEMALE:It's like a blast from the past, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Mother, tell your husband these are the '80s.
SUPFEMALE:Well, becky, i guess you're old enough to know the grim truth.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne: your father is frozen in time.
LEADFEMALE:We're just gonna skip the '80s and try to thaw him out in the '90s.
LEADMALE:Go ahead and take it.
SUPMALE:It'll be trippy.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go pack.
LEADMALE:Far out! Hey, what time's your game? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Around 3:00.
LEADMALE:How's the arm, sport? Okay, i guess.
LEADMALE:Hey, i'm all set for the game.
LEADMALE:Hey, now, batter! hey, batter! we better! we better! we batter! Hold it.
LEADMALE:What now? The lanford lightning bolt ain't going no place without breakfast.
LEADMALE:I'm just going out to the garage to get my glove, okay? You know, it comes to me, dan, that our middle child is kind of, how do you say, out of sorts.
OTHERFEMALE:Pregame jitters.
LEADMALE:I used to get 'em myself.
LEADFEMALE:All your great ones do.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, how soon before the game do these here jitters set in? 'cause she's been flying off the handle for two weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Seems like business as usual to me.
LEADMALE:Well, guess again.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene the chocolate queen just walked by a plate of triple fudge brownies without even breaking stride.
LEADFEMALE:She's in training, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you, the amazing conner, for unraveling yet another sports-related mystery.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, first you're gonna field some breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, kiddo.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:It's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:But i'm gonna be there.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you guys just leave me alone? I don't need you there to watch me pitch.
SUPFEMALE:Pitch, pitch, pitch.
SUPMALE:All she ever does is pitch.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's mom? She and d.j. went to wash the car.
OTHERMALE:She say when she'd be back? Nope.
SUPMALE:She say anything about coming to my game? Not to me.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Will you be mad if she misses the game? My life would be perfect if she missed the game.
SUPFEMALE:It's already halfway perfect.
SUPMALE:Dad's not gonna be there.
LEADFEMALE:They gettin' on your nerves? Becky, every time they come to one of my games, dad just starts yelling, "we better! we better! we better! Swing, batter!" and momshe throws sno-cones at the umpire.
LEADMALE:She does not.
SUPMALE:She did once.
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you, they're complete nerds.
SUPMALE:Hey, wait'll you start dating, and dad asks the guy you're going out with if he has popcorn money.
SUPMALE:I'm not dating, ever.
OTHERFEMALE:It doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:They'll always find a way to embarrass you, believe me.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not fair.
LEADMALE:I mean, parents are supposed to stay in the house.
LEADMALE:Except when they're driving you somewhere, and then they're just supposed to drop you off and go away.
LEADMALE:In a perfect world, darlene, in a perfect world.
SUPMALE:I mean, look what dad wanted me to take to dianne's.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? Like a blast from the past, man.
SUPMALE:They can't be our real parents.
SUPFEMALE:Nerd alert, nerd alert.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, you gotta help me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want mom to come to my game.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. : i'm gonna go watch tv.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene, what did i tell you i was gonna do if i found these on the couch again? Look, just give me the shoes and hold the lecture.
OTHERMALE:Darlene! Listen, miss smart mouth.
LEADFEMALE:You're not even gonna be needing those shoes, 'cause you're not gonna play baseball again till you're 58! Fine with me, i don't wanna play anyway if you're gonna be there.
LEADFEMALE:Did you ever throw a sno-cone at an umpire? You weren't there.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't see the call.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here.
OTHERFEMALE:Me too.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt jackie, you brought it.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Do you remember the sleeping bag? oh, my god, you still have that thing? Yes.
SUPMALE:Mom gave this to me when i moved out, in case i needed a place to stay for the rest of my life.
LEADMALE:There are cowgirls all over it.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, those aren't just cowgirls.
OTHERMALE:That is the cowgirl.
LEADFEMALE:That's annie oakley.
LEADMALE:There is no way i'm taking that to my slumber party.
SUPFEMALE:I guarantee you, no one will have one like this.
LEADMALE:Yeah, including me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd rather sleep in a trash bag.
LEADMALE:Well, they're under the sink.
LEADFEMALE:You'd better take two.
OTHERMALE:Oh, mother.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, if this bag could talk.
LEADFEMALE:I'd cut its tongue out, i would.
OTHERMALE:You remember how much we hated this thing when mom brought it back from that yard sale? They could've at least turned off the sprinklers.
SUPFEMALE:Give me a break! I thought you were going to darlene's ballgame.
LEADFEMALE:Well, darlene and i aren't exactly talking these days.
LEADFEMALE:We're yelling.
LEADFEMALE:But you both do it so well.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and i usually enjoy it, but boy, lately she's driving me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne, she's 11.
SUPFEMALE:You remember all the trouble we used to give mom? Yeah, but mom deserved it.
OTHERFEMALE:Whereas darlene has me, you know, and i'm the perfect mother.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
OTHERFEMALE:I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious, jackie.
LEADMALE:I'm the antithesis of everything mom stood for.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darlene would be against you no matter what you stood for.
LEADFEMALE:You're her mother.
LEADFEMALE:I don't remember having this problem with becky.
LEADFEMALE:Sure you did.
SUPFEMALE:Becky was just too polite to say anything about it.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not just you.
SUPMALE:It's dan too.
LEADFEMALE:It's all parents.
OTHERFEMALE:You're just going through what is commonly known as the "i have no parents, i was hatched from an egg" syndrome.
SUPMALE:Oh, i just can't wait till you have kids.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? which hospital? I'll be right there.
OTHERMALE:No, she's not allergic to penicillin.
LEADMALE:What? Darlene's in the hospital.
LEADMALE:Becky, get down here now! What happened? It's an appendicitis.
OTHERFEMALE:How do we get in touch with dan? We can't.
SUPFEMALE:There's no phone on the jobsite.
SUPMALE:Want me to stay with the kids? No, becky can watch d.j. you go with me.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, what's wrong? Your sister's in the hospital with an appendicitis.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, what do you wanna do? darlene's in the hospital? Oh, she'll be okay, honey.
LEADMALE:You stay here with d.j. i'm gonna go start the car.
LEADMALE:And when dad gets home, tell him me and jackie are in county hospital emergency room.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna go with you.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: you can't, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, d.j. , you and me gotta stay here and give this note to daddy, okay? I wanna go with mom! I'm counting on you, becky.
SUPFEMALE:Mom! Deej, come on.
LEADMALE:I'll let you have some more brownies, okay? Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner? Ted graham, darlene's baseball coach.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, ted, hi.
LEADMALE:How is she? I don't know, they won't tell me anything.
LEADMALE:Well, they're sure as hell gonna tell me.
SUPMALE:Look, we are trying to find somebody who speaks whatever it is you're speaking.
LEADFEMALE:I can't find the blank insurance forms.
LEADMALE:I'm roseanne conner.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to see my daughter.
LEADMALE:For the third time: file cabinet, top drawer.
LEADMALE:Conner? Conner.

LEADFEMALE:We have to operate now.
SUPMALE:Is that dangerous? i mean, is it dangerous? I can't tell you not to worry.
LEADFEMALE:You'll do that anyway.
OTHERMALE:I'm a parent too.

OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, think of all the free time i'll have.

OTHERMALE:It's not gonna work, dad.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna laugh.

LEADMALE:With what, jelly all over it? With syrup.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, it'll burn off, i guess.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i'm gonna go lock myself in the bathroom and take a hot bath and slit my wrists.
SUPMALE:I'll get you some clean towels.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even wanna go in there.
SUPFEMALE:I don't? D.j. set off a paint bomb.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'll clean it up.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, this paint is never gonna come off the rug.

LEADMALE:Well, the sign says 10:00.
LEADFEMALE:It is 10:00.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:My watch says i still got eight minutes.
LEADMALE:Well, my feet say we're closed.
LEADMALE:Well, my eyes say that you're a woman who's worked hard all your life and you know what it's like to work three hours overtime, come home and see your house all torn up by three kids and have your old man yap about how he does more than any other guy he knows, and i need a cup of coffee real bad.
LEADMALE:The coffee's cold.
OTHERFEMALE:That's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right.
SUPMALE:I gotta do my cleanup anyway.
LEADMALE:Bless you.
LEADMALE:Ha! If i was blessed, i wouldn't be working in this joint.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i bet you i hate my job worse than you hate yours.
LEADMALE:What do you do? I rob diners.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I punch out plastic all day in the factory.
SUPMALE:Huh.
OTHERMALE:Paradise compared to this hell pit.
SUPFEMALE:My other waitress quit during the dinner rush.
LEADFEMALE:Then i had an argument with the dishwasher.
SUPFEMALE:And as an added bonus, eight square answers came in here, spent three hours, and left me a 78-cent tip.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i always wondered how these things reproduced.
LEADMALE:It's loads of fun.
LEADMALE:Hey, let me ask you something.
SUPFEMALE:Do you ever have to work overtime? Honey, my whole life is overtime.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i know what you mean.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta check in the hospital just to get a vacation.
LEADMALE:As long as it isn't the maternity ward.
SUPMALE:Well, that's the truth.
LEADFEMALE:Could you possibly heat this up? Help yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Microwave's right over there.
LEADFEMALE:You know what i feel like? I've been thrown in a river and handed some boulders and told to swim upstream.
LEADFEMALE:And it seems that all the harder i swim, the more boulders they hand me.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, wait'll you try it with arthritis.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you gotta keep swimming, right? 'cause that's what all of us women do, just keep swimming.
OTHERMALE:Ain't that the truth? you know what i used to do when i was a kid? I'd leave the lid off these things and leave it for the next customer, real loose-like.
LEADMALE:I still do.
LEADMALE:You know what else i do when things get a little tense around here? what? I deep-fry a couple of dishtowels.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's great.
SUPMALE:I hardly cook at all anymore.
SUPMALE:Well, you married? I was.
SUPMALE:My marvin passed away about seven years ago.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry to hear that.
LEADMALE:I miss him.
SUPFEMALE:He was a good man.
LEADFEMALE:Hardest part is going home at night to an empty house.
SUPMALE:It's so damn quiet.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes i turn on the ballgame and turn it up real loud like he used to do.
LEADFEMALE:And i hate sports.
LEADFEMALE:But what are you gonna do? Hey, you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, this house looks immaculate.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't have to do it.
LEADFEMALE:I would've helped.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's okay.
SUPFEMALE:I saved the bathroom for ya.
SUPMALE:Oh, then you really do love me.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Where'd you find a flower this time of night? The cemetery.
SUPFEMALE:Picking out my plot, eh? The best day-old coffee in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Feeling better? Much.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's good, 'cause this paint ain't coming out.
OTHERMALE:Ah, forget about it.
LEADMALE:We'll just move.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, is that d.j. 's picture? Yeah, that's the one he's turning in at school.
LEADFEMALE:Dan: look at the size of that sun.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's really into yellow, kind of like you and corn.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Check out those flowers.
LEADFEMALE:Kind of nice he can see something pretty in all this mess.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just glad darlene's alive in this one.
LEADMALE:Hey.

OTHERFEMALE:I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to work tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I'm entitled to a little r and r.
SUPMALE:Well, if you're not going, i ain't going.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I think i'll sleep till noon, and then i'll go in and leisurely read the paper and sip my coffee, then i might come back to bed and take a nap.
SUPMALE:Me too.
LEADMALE:So we're agreed then? Agreed.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Dan? yeah? is the alarm set? Yep.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Well, this one is called "toto, we're not in kansas anymore," the special effects show.
OTHERFEMALE:This was big cornball activity in this one.
SUPFEMALE:And i remember like really being, you know, perturbed at the lengths that we had to sit there and wait for 'em to set up the mailbox flying through the window and, i was like, "oh, man, i could never do a movie.
SUPFEMALE:" it was just too much.
SUPFEMALE:But it's the first show also, in fact the only show, where we revealed d.j. 's real name, david jacob.
LEADMALE:And i actually thought of that while i was sitting there all those hours.
SUPMALE:Hope you enjoy it.
OTHERFEMALE:What's this? My insurance claim for the robbery.
OTHERFEMALE:"27-inch color t.
LEADMALE:V.
LEADFEMALE:With stereo and remote"? yeah, so? Hey, the only thing those crooks ripped off from your apartment was a 12-inch portable black and white with a hanger for an antenna.
LEADMALE:That philco was an heirloom.
OTHERFEMALE:You just can't put a price on sentiment.
LEADFEMALE:Those punks trashed my apartment.
SUPMALE:I'm only trying to get back what's mine plus a little compensation for my mental anguish.
SUPMALE:Your mental anguish? what about me? I've been married for 15 years.
SUPMALE:So, you think the insurance company's not gonna go for it? Ah, i don't know.
OTHERMALE:A multinational conglomerate outwit the lanford scam queen? Impossible.
LEADMALE:Becky, turn down that heavy breathing.
SUPMALE:Mom, darlene's been taking my stuff again without asking.
LEADMALE:I then how come i found my new sweater at the bottom of your grungy closet? Because everything in the free world to diane's tonight to do homework.

LEADFEMALE:Can't we have her put to sleep? Well, we tried but the vet backed out.
SUPMALE:What you doing, aunt jackie? What she does best.
SUPMALE:Trying to get something for nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, i can't get the knob to turn on this stupid washer.
LEADMALE:I hate this house! Nothing ever works.
SUPFEMALE:Except me.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, put me down for a new washer, would ya? Here, dig in.

LEADMALE:Come on out here.
SUPMALE:I want to show you this sky.
OTHERMALE:Dan: i was on the job site.

LEADFEMALE:Okay, everybody, panic! I'm serious.
LEADMALE:We had a tornado drill in school.
OTHERFEMALE:We're supposed to go to the northeast corner of the basement.

LEADFEMALE:Would you stop screwing around? Oh, right, dan, let's whip the kids up into a hysterical frenzy while there's still time.

LEADFEMALE:Don't you think i'm worried? My sister's out there for crying out loud.
SUPFEMALE:I know you're worried.
LEADMALE:We're supposed to unplug everything.
LEADMALE:Crack the windows so the pressure doesn't build up in here.

LEADFEMALE:What good's a tornado if you can't see it? Oh, yeah, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you guys go out and play? Dan, you're not safe there.
SUPMALE:It's so damn hypnotic.

SUPFEMALE:Yours or mine? Roseanne: your father's.
LEADFEMALE:Becky? Roseanne: becky, come out now! It wasn't funny when darlene did it.
LEADFEMALE:Becky! Maybe she's lying in the house somewhere buried under the rubble.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne: knock it off! what is it?! Nothing.
LEADMALE:I just bumped into my future and it was hideous.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go check upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:No, jackie went to check up there.
LEADFEMALE:You know where she went.
SUPMALE:The garage? Yeah, to get those damn animals.
LEADMALE:Let's go get her and beat the hell of her before the tornado gets her.

SUPMALE:This is too good to miss.
LEADMALE:Well, so are you.

OTHERMALE:If the tornado's gonna get ya, it's gonna get ya.
LEADMALE:When your number's up, your number's up.
SUPFEMALE:We all gotta go sometime.
LEADMALE:Try not to look on the bright side.
LEADFEMALE:Don't talk about this.
OTHERMALE:It's bad luck.
LEADMALE:Bad luck, good luck.
OTHERMALE:What difference does it make? We're powerless.
SUPFEMALE:When i was on my way back over here, i saw that thing.
SUPMALE:The tornado? Yeah, and i had my camera so i thought i'd move in on it and snap a few.
LEADFEMALE:How could you do something that crazy? Dad used to put us all in the buick and go chasing storms.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad was a lunatic! You can't believe the power of that thing.
SUPFEMALE:It wipes out one house and leaves the next one untouched.
LEADFEMALE:There's absolutely no rhyme or reason to it.
LEADMALE:It's beyond our control.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing means anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you been talking to mom? Come on, you two.
SUPMALE:You're missing out on marshmallows.

OTHERFEMALE:Give me the willies.
LEADFEMALE:Are you okay? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm writing in my diary everything that's happening just in case.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, you're gonna make it.
LEADMALE:You'll survive this horrible moment and grow up and have horrible moments with your own kids.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, mom.
SUPFEMALE:What was that? Probably something of mine.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, i want to live.
SUPMALE:Think it over.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
SUPMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:God, if you get me through this i'll forget all about the 27-inch color t.

OTHERFEMALE:Come on, girls.
SUPMALE:Can i go too, mom? No, you have to stay here.
LEADMALE:I'm not done hugging you yet.
SUPFEMALE:You believe this? Freddie sunk this baby in a foot of concrete, and the wind still got it.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:I always hated that stupid goose and gander painted on the side.
LEADMALE:Honk! I'll take it out back, see if we still got anything left out there.
LEADFEMALE:Can i help? Absolutely not.
LEADMALE:Please, i'll be careful.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:The perfect end to another perfect day, eh, sis? Yeah, and of course you didn't help things out any running around out there like a fool, making me worry about ya.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't trying to make you worry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought i might sell some of these shots to a magazine.
LEADMALE:Sometimes i feel like i got four kids.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, lighten up.
SUPFEMALE:It was just a little tornado.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you don't get it, do ya? You really scared me.
SUPMALE:I wasn't trying to scare ya.
LEADMALE:You don't have to try.
SUPFEMALE:Your whole life scares me.
LEADMALE:Look what we found.
LEADFEMALE:Your lawn chairs were over on gunden avenue.
LEADMALE:Our stuff was lying all over the neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:What'd you bring it back for? This was my big chance to get rid of it.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, is it safe to watch t.
LEADFEMALE:V.
LEADMALE:? No safer than before.
SUPMALE:Hey, this doesn't belong to us, does it? No, but it could if you play your cards right.
LEADFEMALE:Guess it must have blown over from freddie's yard.
OTHERMALE:Here's our chance to get even with 'em for not returning your weed whacker.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be happy to know we still got a back-end on the place.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just glad we still got back-ends on each other.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i guess i'll get over to my place and see if it's still standing.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for putting up with me.
LEADMALE:Sure.

SUPMALE:Tv reporter: john hale, where the action is, at the scene.
OTHERFEMALE:As we all know by now, several small tornadoes have caused extensive damage to parts of the lanford area.
LEADFEMALE:Although they lasted less than half an hour, the tornadoes, gusting up to 150 miles per hour, brought near devastation to several homes and businesses.
LEADMALE:The house behind me, located at 344 cypresswell, you we saw two ambulances going around the block before.
SUPMALE:Jeez, dan.
LEADMALE:I don't even want to think about it.

SUPFEMALE:Looks like we lucked out again, huh, kid? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, think about it.
LEADMALE:If you were a tornado, would you want to come in this house? what is that? one of them zen riddles? Let me ask you a question.
SUPMALE:That depends.
LEADMALE:What about? About freddie's mailbox.
LEADMALE:Freddie's mailbox.
OTHERFEMALE:Ask me anything you want about freddie's mailbox.
LEADMALE:What if it would've hit me in the head and killed me? What do you meanwhat do you mean, what if it would've killed you.

SUPMALE:" seriously though, what would you have done? Roseanne, there's a time for morbid and there's a time for not morbid.
SUPMALE:Check your watch.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just asking you a serious question.
OTHERFEMALE:What would you have done? A single father, three kids.
LEADMALE:Probably go out and look for florence henderson.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, dan, this is something we really have to think about.
SUPMALE:No, we don't.
SUPMALE:Why not? Because nothing bad's ever gonna happen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right.

LEADMALE:Let it go at that.
SUPFEMALE:And let it go at that? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, that tornado was a sign.
OTHERMALE:What kind of a sign? A giant sign.
LEADFEMALE:No, like a giant poster.
LEADMALE:More like a billboard and in great, big letters, it says"repent, the end is near"? No, it says, "sorry we missed you.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll call again for another appointment.
LEADFEMALE:" and it's signed, "the tornado man.
LEADFEMALE:" terrific.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, we'll live our lives.
LEADMALE:And every other moment of every other day we'll look at each other and go, "watch out, babe, something bad's gonna happen.
LEADFEMALE:" that's a wonderful prescription for a relaxed life.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie there's some things you can't prepare for ever.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, no matter how much you think you're prepared for them you're not prepared.
LEADMALE:If you spend your whole life preparing for 'em, you're wasting your time.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, i know that.
SUPMALE:Well, what's this all about? Well, i guess there's just a warm front moving in.
OTHERMALE:I guess you're right.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. : i'll get it.

SUPMALE:Well, he is no serial killer, dan.
LEADMALE:He just wants to drink a glass of water and sell me 2,000 bucks worth of cleaning products.
LEADMALE:That's my second problem.
SUPFEMALE:Just don't buy anything.
LEADMALE:What makes you think i'm gonna buy anything? 'cause this looks like aisle 12 at budget club.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, i think it's time you exercised a little financial restraint.
LEADMALE:You know, i think you're right.
SUPMALE:I can't afford you anymore.
LEADMALE:Get out! Listen you, i'm saving us a bundle by fixing that compressor under the fridge.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, unless you screw up and have to pay some repairman double sunday overtime.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you, i got a manual.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, you what's that? Nothing, dear.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i'm sorry, mister, but we're gonna have to skip the demonstration.

LEADFEMALE:Mister? mister? Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Mister? what's wrong? Honey, he passed out.
SUPFEMALE:From what? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Go check his pulse.
LEADFEMALE:You check his pulse.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:What? what's wrong? I thinkhe's dead, is what's wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Check it again.
SUPFEMALE:I know how to count to zero.
LEADFEMALE:Crying banatlies, what are we gonna do? I'll call 9-1-1, and you see if you can find out who he is.
SUPFEMALE:How am i supposed to do that? well, look for his wallet! What are you doing with those? I'm gonna make a salad.
LEADMALE:Come on, dan! Roseanne, there's no way i'm sticking my hands into this guy's pockets.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? He has no wallet.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i'll hold.
OTHERMALE:Hey, i don't mean to be an ungracious hostess here, but when do you think our guest might be leaving? Soon as the coroner pronounces the subject dead.
OTHERMALE:Then the body can be moved.
LEADMALE:Hey, i pronounced him dead over a half hour ago.
LEADFEMALE:That's true, she did.
SUPMALE:The coroner needs to make that determination.
LEADMALE:You do not want to be wrong about dead.
LEADMALE:No, siree, that would be a real catastrophe.
OTHERMALE:That guy shouldn't even have been in the house.
LEADFEMALE:We're talking nine, ten hours of paperwork, easy.
SUPMALE:I'll just go out to my car, radio the coroner's office, have them check with the morgue make sure they got room in the fridge.
SUPMALE:So see if they got room for a rump roast.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, the refrigerator will get fixed.
SUPMALE:Forget about the refrigerator.
LEADFEMALE:What are we gonna do if somebody comes over here to look at that washer and dryer and they see our company still laying here? R i invited the guy in the house in the first place.
SUPMALE:So i invited him in.
SUPMALE:So what? I didn't buy anything.
LEADFEMALE:Only 'cause he dropped dead! That still counts.
LEADFEMALE:Now look it, usually if somebody drops dead in my kitchen i will take the blame but this is nobody's fault.
LEADMALE:Darlene: why is there a cop car outside our house? cop car? Oh, engine trouble.
LEADMALE:Is that for your baklava? Yeah, that.
LEADFEMALE:One pound of bak, two pounds of lava.
SUPFEMALE:You guys take that in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, dan, you go get the bags for them.
LEADFEMALE:You kids stay out of the kitchen.
SUPMALE:Becky: why? I washed the floors in there.
SUPFEMALE:So how come dad can go in? He helped me.
OTHERMALE:You washed the floors on a sunday? Yeah, i'm gonna start washing the floors every sunday.
LEADMALE:Like every sunday, you're gonna start taking the kids to movies and stuff like that.
LEADMALE:What? We're all turning over a new leaf.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be a better housekeeper, you'll be a better aunt.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? how come you're kicking us out? I know what i'm doing and what you're doing.
OTHERFEMALE:Now take them to a movie and when it's over call me and we can meet for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:What about my baklava? It's due tomorrow.
SUPMALE:I haven't forgotten about you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm still trying to reach the coroner.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Coroner? who died? yeah, who died? Some guy.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't know his name.
SUPFEMALE:He's a salesman.
LEADFEMALE:He came to the door right after you left.
LEADMALE:He died in our house? did the policeman shoot him? No, honey, he just kind of wound down like when your toys need new batteries.
LEADFEMALE:I've never seen a dead body.
LEADMALE:Yeah, where'd you guys stash him? He's in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:You don't need to see him.
LEADMALE:I'll be the judge of that.
LEADMALE:So what's gonna happen to him? Well, when the coroner gets here he's gonna take care of everything.
LEADMALE:Umm, let's go upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go take a peek.
LEADMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
SUPMALE:Listen, you take your little brother outside and go play and have fun.
LEADFEMALE:All right, deej, let's go wait for the meat wagon.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope that guy gets here soon.
LEADMALE:I ain't touching that refrigerator till willy loman's outta here.
SUPFEMALE:Did you get a hold of the coroner? No, but i did get a hold of his wife.
LEADMALE:He's in the middle of a golf tournament.
LEADFEMALE:So get him.
LEADMALE:You don't know the coroner when it comes to golf.
OTHERMALE:You don't know me when it comes to stiffs in my kitchen.
SUPMALE:How long is this gonna take? Well, he just teed off.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the member's guest tournament, and it is jammed out there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't look at me! If we would have had sex like i wanted to, none of this would have ever happened.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't we move mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Excitement out to the garage or something like that? Lady, rules are rules.
SUPMALE:The body cannot be moved until the coroner gets here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what the hell.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do? I just lifted the sheet to take a look.
LEADMALE:Look, just don't touch him.
SUPMALE:Don't fool around, don't put your hands on him.
SUPMALE:Just don't, okay? Well, i've never seen a dead body before.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if that coroner don't get here, you're gonna be eating dinner with one.
OTHERMALE:Gross! Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Connor, will you give me a hand, please? You gotta be kidding me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dan, that's how i found you.
LEADFEMALE:We gotta put the body back into the original position in which it was found.
LEADMALE:Good, originally it was found standing at the front door.
LEADMALE:Hey, you're the authorities.
LEADFEMALE:If you want him moved, you move him.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:When's the body gonna start to rot? I think i got a few good years left.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i gotta make my baklava.
LEADFEMALE:So what's stopping you? it's getting late, huh? is there gonna be enough room on the table for me to lay out my phyllo dough? phyllo dough? what are you making? Oh, baklava.
LEADMALE:It's for school.
LEADMALE:You know greek? Yeah, i am greek.
LEADFEMALE:Prove it.
LEADFEMALE:How long is this stuff supposed to bake? Well, until the crust is nicely browned but not dried out.
SUPFEMALE:You see, it's okay now, but we should check it in about half an hour.
LEADMALE:Okay? man, i hate working on sundays, don't you? Come on.
LEADMALE:You seen my manual? what did i do with it? Oh.
LEADMALE:Look, uh i'll make you a deal, uh you don't bother me, and what do we got here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, let's see.
LEADMALE:Thought we had a deal.
SUPMALE:Oh! Well, jeez, i guess i just can't leave you boys alone for five minutes.
LEADFEMALE:I hate you and everything you stand for.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene: i'll get it.
SUPMALE:You owe me.
LEADMALE:You owe me forever.
OTHERFEMALE:Rump roast, dan.
LEADMALE:Rump roast.
SUPMALE:Darlene: someone's here.
SUPMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Tell him we're in the kitchen.
OTHERMALE:Finally.

LEADMALE:Dad, aren't you gonna introduce them to uncle edward? darlene, honey, why don't you run along and play, sweetheart? Well, the neighborhood's kinda dead today.
LEADMALE:Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gone, i'm gone! I guess you guys want to see the washer and dryer.
LEADMALE:I believe we still have a set in stock.
LEADFEMALE:Is this a good time? Oh, yeah, we're all just kicking back.
LEADMALE:Washer and dryer are right in here.
LEADMALE:I think i got becky feeling better.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you manage that? A quart of scotch.
LEADFEMALE:Very funny.
SUPFEMALE:How's he doing? He's still dead.
SUPFEMALE:Probably doing better than any of us.
LEADMALE:That's the cosmic joke, roseanne.
LEADMALE:He's the happiest man on the planet.
OTHERMALE:How do you figure that? His troubles are over.
LEADFEMALE:Never again have to stand in a line, he'll never again have to listen to the muzak version of muskrat love.
SUPFEMALE:Never again have to eat a hamburger and bite into one of those little hard things.
LEADMALE:How do you feel about electric shock therapy? Well, uh i don't know, honey.
SUPMALE:What do you think? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:What are you asking for it? $125.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but there's no knobs and the lint screen's broke.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, 50 bucks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well? It's time.
OTHERFEMALE:It's time.
LEADFEMALE:It is time.
LEADMALE:Time for what? It's time for his medicine.
LEADMALE:It's medicine time.
SUPFEMALE:It's medicine time.
OTHERFEMALE:It's his medicine time.
OTHERFEMALE:It's medicine time.
LEADMALE:Uh medicine time.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you guys are gonna have to go now, 'cause it's time for him to take his medicine and everything.
SUPMALE:What does he take the medicine for? Muscle spasms in his neck.
LEADMALE:$35, we'll discuss it in the other room.
LEADMALE:Rosie, you give him his medicine.
LEADFEMALE:You know, my aunt had terrible neck spasms.
LEADMALE:Sometimes all she needed was a good massage.
LEADMALE:That's a great idea, honey.
LEADMALE:Why don't you take the caroseks in the living room, and i'lli'll work on uncle edward.
SUPMALE:I hope this isn't out of place, but i am a massage therapist.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, he is stiff.
OTHERMALE:$7.
LEADFEMALE:50, but you gotta say yes.
SUPFEMALE:How are you doing, honey? A lot better than him.
LEADMALE:I feel bad for him.
LEADMALE:Poor old man has to go door-to-door to earn a living, and he ends his life in the kitchen of a house he was never even in before.
OTHERFEMALE:Well if you were feeling any different than you're feeling, something would definitely be wrong.
LEADMALE:Well, then there's obviously something wrong with darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:No, there isn't, honey.
SUPMALE:She feels just as bad as you.
LEADFEMALE:She just shows it in a different way.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
OTHERMALE:Mom, there's an ambulance outside.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and some guy with a golf bag.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it better be the coroner 'cause if it's a golf salesman we're out of chairs.
LEADMALE:How's my baklava? It's very hot.
SUPMALE:Don't touch it.
LEADFEMALE:Ouch! It's hot.
SUPFEMALE:You think just 'cause you got a gun she's gonna listen to you? Oh, that must be dave.
SUPFEMALE:Should we put the sheet back over him? Let's just put it right back on d.j. 's bed.
LEADFEMALE:Let's put it on darlene's bed.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see who can yell the loudest.
SUPMALE:I can! Now shut up.
SUPFEMALE:Yep.
SUPMALE:He's dead.
SUPMALE:There's that in-depth medical expertise we've been waiting for.
LEADMALE:Write him up, gene.
SUPFEMALE:Bag him, hank.
LEADFEMALE:Hank: name? Gene: uh, john doe.
SUPFEMALE:A guy shouldn't have to live his whole life just to be buried as john doe.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they'll find out his real name tomorrow.
LEADMALE:He needs a name tonight.
LEADMALE:Well, what are we gonna call him? He kind of looks like a charlie.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe he looks like a george? He's a william, definitely a william.
LEADMALE:William it is.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hold on a second.
SUPMALE:I don't know where you're going, mister, but if you bump into janis joplin, tell her i said hi.
LEADMALE:I tried that technique you told me about.
LEADMALE:Where's d.j. ? D.j. ! Oh, i'm so glad we have an intercom.
LEADFEMALE:He's been upstairs all day making gifts for everyone, but he won't say what they are.
SUPFEMALE:Who cares? Okay, everybody, close your eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, open your eyes.
SUPMALE:What'd you get us, bub? Toe tags.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Okay, we bet $50,000.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne: i call.
OTHERMALE:It's not your turn, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but it's my house.
OTHERMALE:We gonna play poker, or shoot the breeze? Shoot the breeze.
LEADFEMALE:Dan: okay.
OTHERMALE:The portchester game, last game of my senior year.
SUPMALE:We're down by a touchdown with one minute to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's play poker.
LEADMALE:Now we gotta shoot the breeze.
OTHERMALE:I get to tell this story.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, we know this story.
LEADFEMALE:This time i'm telling it from the referee's point of view.
LEADMALE:I got a pair.
LEADMALE:So do i.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but roseanne's are showing.
LEADFEMALE:You guys think we don't get your corny little sex jokes.
SUPMALE:Hey, you kids are our corny little sex jokes.
LEADFEMALE:Geez, it's the fuzz! hide the cards and the jif! Darlene, i think it's high time we taught d.j. how to play 52-card pickup.
LEADMALE:Ta-da! Dad, what are you doing here? I came to see my sweet little kapushka.
LEADMALE:Al! hey, daddy! dad! oh, my gosh! Is everything okay? Fine, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Where's grandma? Here she is now.
LEADMALE:Hello! mom! Mom, hi.
LEADMALE:Aww.
LEADFEMALE:What are you guys doing in lanford? Well, we got up this morning and i said to your mother, "what do you wanna do?" and as usual she had no opinion, so i said, "let's go for a little ride.
OTHERMALE:" two hundred and fifty miles isn't a little drive.
OTHERMALE:Especially when you have a woman sitting next to you who whenever you pass a car says, "i wonder where they're going.
LEADMALE:" boy, she's got problems.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, why didn't you call? I did, but your line was busy.
SUPMALE:Then i tried your sister.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't get a hold of her.
LEADFEMALE:I thought maybe something was wrong, but of course, if there were, god knows, she would never tell me.
LEADMALE:My apartment was getting fumigated, mom, sofumigated for what? We need milkmilk.
LEADMALE:We need eggs.
LEADFEMALE:Eggs.
LEADMALE:Bullets.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, dan, let's just try to get through this.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: what are you doing up? I can't sleep.
LEADMALE:Grandpa's in the bathroom making those gagging noises.
LEADMALE:Ew.
LEADMALE:How long's he been in there? At least a half an hour.
SUPMALE:Well, he's probably got it all up by now.
LEADMALE:Why don't you go back to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, he's really driving me crazy.
SUPMALE:If he says "pull my finger" one more timewell, now you know where i get my smart, sophisticated wit.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe that man raised you.
SUPFEMALE:Now you know why i was so crazy to marry you so young.
LEADMALE:I thought it was because you were madly in love.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, with the idea of getting out of my house.
SUPFEMALE:Is there a place in here to sit down? yeah, why don't you try one of these things we call "chairs"? We sit in 'em frequently.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of list is he making? Not that it's any of my business.
LEADMALE:A hit list.
SUPMALE:He's just gonna go out to the store and pick up a few things.
LEADFEMALE:Please don't get anything special for me.
OTHERMALE:I'll eat whatever you have, but your father's diet is low sodium, low fat, and high fiber.
LEADMALE:So why don't we just get him some wood, you know? And then he can put mustard on it and, you know, that'd be a good treat.
SUPFEMALE:Mustard's high in fat.
SUPMALE:A lot of people don't know that.
OTHERMALE:A lot of people don't care.
LEADFEMALE:I do, but doggone it, i gotta go.
SUPFEMALE:He's not working, is he? He's working.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'm glad, because your father worries, especially about your sister.
SUPMALE:He doesn't have to worry.
SUPFEMALE:Well, somebody has to.
SUPMALE:She's 32, she's unmarried.
LEADMALE:Heaven forbid that she turns out to be like your aunt dale, who teaches p.
LEADFEMALE:E.
OTHERMALE:Speaking of aunt dale, how is uncle shirley? Also, your father is concerned because your sister lives in a building that needs to be fumigated.
LEADFEMALE:But i am her mother.
LEADFEMALE:It is not my job to tell her what to do.
SUPMALE:Oh, i get it.
LEADFEMALE:But it is your job to tell me to tell her what to do.
LEADMALE:Yes, i'm sure petunias are perennials.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, mom was just talking about you.
SUPFEMALE:Now you get to listen while she talks about me.
LEADMALE:So, are we gonna talk about roseanne? Certainly not.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that your father is worried about her.
LEADFEMALE:She seems so tired all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Mama you've been here a grand total of one hour.
SUPFEMALE:How do you know how tired she is? A mother knows.
LEADMALE:Granted, it is a different generation, but your father would have died before he made me go out to work.
LEADFEMALE:Dan doesn't make roseanne work.
LEADFEMALE:That's what she tells you.
LEADFEMALE:But you've never been married.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know these things.
LEADMALE:What'd you find out about me? You're very tired.
LEADMALE:Hey, ma, is two blankets enough? Two's fine, if that's all you have.
SUPFEMALE:No, i have more.
SUPFEMALE:How many would you like? what did your father say? He says he's gonna be sleeping out in the driveway naked.
SUPFEMALE:How many blankets do you want, ma? If you have two, two's fine.
LEADMALE:I am this close to the edge, and if i go over, i'm taking you with me.
SUPMALE:She does have a way about her, doesn't she? if she wants to rag on your life, why doesn't she just tell you? I'm getting so sick of these behind-the-back conversations.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, like the one we're having about mom right now? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, why should i have to defend the guys you go out with? You shouldn't.
LEADFEMALE:And i'm tired of explaining to her why your house is so filthy all the time.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, that's my business.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, she just doesn't let up.
LEADMALE:Well, she's gonna let up, because i'm gonna lay into her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm gonna lay into her too.
OTHERFEMALE:That woman's not qualified to judge anybody's life.
LEADFEMALE:Where is she? Mom?! Enough is enough already.
LEADMALE:We gotta do this.
LEADMALE:Absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:I found this under your sister's sofa.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, why are you giving it to me? It's her potato chips, it's her sofa, it's her house.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't like the way that roseanne keeps house, then you talk to roseanne about it, you don't talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:And if you don't like the way that i run my life, then you talk to me about it, you don't talk to roseanne.
SUPMALE:We'rewe're sick and tired of the way that you manipulate us.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that so, roseanne? yeah, right? Well, maybe "manipulate" is kind of a harsh word to use here.
LEADFEMALE:I just think what jackie means, what she's trying to say is that we wish that you would just try to deal with us in a more direct manner, you know, if you want to.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not what jackie's trying to say.
LEADMALE:What jackie's trying to saywhere the hell were you five minutes ago? I'll get some sheets, mom.
SUPMALE:You really should turn your mattress more often.
LEADMALE:Where are you guys gonna sleep? Anywhere's okay with me.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i don't sleep anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Well, these cots are pretty nice.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm sure mom and dad don't wanna sleep on any cots.
LEADMALE:What did we do last time? last time? I've completely blocked it out of my mind.
LEADMALE:You guys don't mind sleeping on cots, do you? I can sleep anywhere.
LEADMALE:Why don't you and dad just take me and dan's bed, and we'll sleep out here on the cots? Honey, i can't sleep on these things.
LEADMALE:Last time darlene and i slept downstairs on the cots, and grandma and grandpa slept up in our room.
SUPMALE:I want to sleep on the sleeping bags.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's not what we did last year.
LEADMALE:I'm very particular about where i sleep.
SUPMALE:What does that mean? I'll tell you something about me.
SUPMALE:I'll never sleep in a communist country.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll visit one during the day, but i'll never sleep in one at night.
SUPMALE:Well, god bless america.
LEADMALE:Can i sleep in your sleeping bag? Roseanne: no, go.
SUPMALE:How about what i said? what did you say? Forget what she said.
SUPFEMALE:Please, let's not fuss about this.
LEADMALE:Dad and i can sleep anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene and i slept on the cots, and grandma and grandpa had our room.
LEADMALE:These cots still smell from when we found the dead pigeon in it.
LEADMALE:Darlene.
SUPMALE:Jackie: okay.
SUPMALE:D.j. and i must have both slept on the floor, mom and dad had d.j. 's bedbut that couldn't have been, because d.j. 's bed's too small and they would have been uncomfortable.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, you were not even here.
LEADFEMALE:Temper, temper.
LEADMALE:Then how come i can remember it? Because you have total recall of all things imaginary! Girls, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Let's be ladies, shall we? can we come to some sort of conclusion here? okay, you want a conclusion? I'll give you a conclusion.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, jackie, you go sleep in d.j. 's bed, d.j. , sleep in a sleeping bag! Girls, girls, girls, let's just be little ladies and go up and sleep in your own bed.
LEADMALE:Mom and dad, you take me and dan's room.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:And i'm gonna sleep here on the cot, and so is mr.
SUPFEMALE:Flexible.
LEADFEMALE:Hopefully we won't have all this confusion once your father and i have our own place right here in lanford.
SUPFEMALE:Sleep tight, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Nighty night.
LEADMALE:Dan, are you sleeping? Like a baby.
LEADFEMALE:The fact that it's 4:30 in the morning and i have a spring in my pancreas isn't keeping me awake the least little bit.
OTHERMALE:If my parents move to lanford, i am gonna be sleeping on a cot for the rest of my life, because i'm gonna be in prison for blowing 'em away.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey, be realistic.
LEADMALE:You don't know how to use a gun.
SUPMALE:I'll do it.
LEADMALE:Seriously, dan, what are we gonna do? Well, i'd say "let's sleep on it," but who can sleep?! You know, if you knew how to stand up to your parents, we wouldn't be lying here right now.
LEADFEMALE:What is that supposed to mean? And i'm warning you, that fireplace poker's within reach.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, let's not get into this right now.
LEADFEMALE:Because it's not my warped, psychotic, neurotic parents that are laying in my bed.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go sit on the porch.
SUPFEMALE:Dan: honey, honey.
SUPMALE:Honey, let's not do this to each other.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, baby, i'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just angry 'cause i haven't slept.
SUPMALE:We got a couple hours left till daylight.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just try to salvage some sleep.
OTHERMALE:Mom: al? al? Right here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You two go back to sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just gonna make your father breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:He always gets up at 4:30.
LEADMALE:Why? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Go back to sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:Feel like making love? Don't get up.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to know where you keep your citrus fruit.
OTHERMALE:I think there's some strawberry pop-tarts in the fridge.
LEADFEMALE:Your father needs to have a piece of citrus fruit.
LEADFEMALE:I think there's an orange under the dryer.
SUPMALE:Go back to sleep.
OTHERMALE:Dan shouldn't sleep on his left side.
LEADMALE:It's bad for the heart.
SUPFEMALE:So's a rusty spike.
SUPFEMALE:This is nuts.
LEADMALE:This is nuts.
SUPFEMALE:I got a new job to start today.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta go to work too, you know.
SUPMALE:Well, why don't you go in there and tell ma and pa kettle to shut up? what are you doing up so early? You know, this is the best room in your house.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, 'cause mom and dad aren't in it.
SUPMALE:This is our only sanctuary from them.
LEADMALE:Well, don't count on it.
OTHERFEMALE:She'll figure out some way to get in here.
LEADFEMALE:And then you can stand up to here again like you did before.
LEADFEMALE:I said to your grandmother, "beverly"i call her beverly because that's her name.
SUPFEMALE:I said, "beverly, this year i'm gonna pay more attention to my stable and horses.
LEADMALE:" you don't have any horses, grandpa.
LEADMALE:'cause i don't have a stable.
LEADMALE:Pull my finger, kid.
LEADFEMALE:Don't.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:What were you saying? Oh, i'm finished.
LEADFEMALE:Are you guys getting ready for school? Yeah, and we're really excited about it.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:They're really doing great in school.
LEADMALE:Al was always very concerned with the children's education.
LEADFEMALE:He was some father.
LEADMALE:What is it you always used to say? You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make 'em think.
LEADFEMALE:You used to say that? and you stopped saying that? He used to say that, and he doesn't say it anymore.
SUPMALE:He used to say, "you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make 'em think.
LEADMALE:" and he doesn't say it anymore.
LEADMALE:I haven't slept.
LEADMALE:I swear we're only sane today because we kept each other that way.
LEADMALE:I know, we protected each other from mr.
LEADMALE:And mrs.
OTHERMALE:Total insanity.
SUPMALE:Yeah, like that time that you were in the eighth grade and you were dating that 40-year-old guy.
SUPFEMALE:Aah! He was not 40.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he was the only guy at your freshman dance that was wearing a toupee.
SUPMALE:I told mom he was your tutor.
LEADMALE:And i taught him more than he taught me.
LEADMALE:Well, that's the way it goes.
OTHERMALE:The bottom line is that mom and dad are just so out there.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know, it's not all their fault.
SUPFEMALE:We should show 'em a little compassion.
LEADMALE:Well, here we go again, checking your backbone at the door.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fine.
SUPMALE:You blame your whole lifeoh, roseanne, you turn into a little robot every time mom and dad come around.
LEADMALE:You turn into little rosie two-shoes, and i'm sick of it.
LEADMALE:Hey, people who live in cockroach-infested apartments should not throw stones.
LEADMALE:I can't even talk to you! oh, shut up! You always have to get your own way.
LEADMALE:It has to be my way when you're standing here in my bathroom at 7:30 in the morning after my parents came over to my house and decimate my whole family.
LEADMALE:Now they're your parents, fine.
LEADFEMALE:If you want 'em, fine, you have 'em! Gee, you tell me when it's their anniversary, and you let 'em stay at your house next time they come fine, good.
LEADMALE:And decimate your whole family, of which you don't even have, because you can't concentrate on nothing long enough than it takes to chug a beer! And don't give me that wounded little jackie look either, because that only works on guys named mike who drive el caminos.
LEADFEMALE:Very dramatic, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Oh, so now you're not gonna talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:God, would i love to throw a hammer through a plate glass window.
LEADMALE:Don't wait for a response, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Her majesty's not speaking to anybody today.
LEADMALE:Jackie, who even asked you? Hey, i'm a part of this family too.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, when your hamper's full or your car needs working on.
SUPMALE:I've been a member of this family longer than you have! boy, that's something to be proud of! You know, i saw a whole thing about this on oprah, and that's just what we are too.
LEADFEMALE:We're just like that.
SUPFEMALE:We are a dysfunctional family! Thanks, gramps.
LEADMALE:Bye, gram.
LEADMALE:Al: bye, becky.
SUPMALE:Beverly: bye, dear.
LEADMALE:Grandpa said he'd buy me a horse next year.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, grandpa's saddle's on too tight.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? I'm making breakfast for my kids.
SUPFEMALE:I already made them breakfast.
LEADMALE:Go to school then.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Al: bye, kids.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, she made 'em breakfast.
LEADMALE:Cereal and chocolate chip cookies.
LEADMALE:Your father gave them the cookies.
OTHERFEMALE:Whether they eat 'em now or in the afternoon, what's the difference? you want to know the difference? I'll tell you what the difference is.
LEADMALE:The difference is, you show up at my door unannounced, uninvited.
LEADMALE:You just drive everybody and work 'em up into a frenzy until we're ready to kill each other! What are you talking about? We're having a nice breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking about, if you guys are gonna move here to lanford, you have got to move onto the whole other side of this town, because i am not gonna be able to take this for the rest of my life.
SUPFEMALE:Who's moving to lanford? You guys are.
OTHERFEMALE:You said so last night.
LEADMALE:Oh, we're never gonna move into lanford.
LEADMALE:We were just thinking, we were just talking.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you take everything so seriously? so you're not moving? No.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, we've got to get going.
LEADMALE:We're on our way to see cousin sydney in beauford.
LEADMALE:He had gum surgery.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna buy him some rock candy.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's a shame you couldn't stay longer.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, do you really mean that? Hey, if you don't think you guys leaving is gonna affect everybody, you're crazy.
OTHERMALE:Al, did you hear that? Yeah, i'd give him a big kiss oh.
OTHERFEMALE:If i liked boys.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mom, i'm really gonna miss you.
SUPMALE:Me too.
LEADMALE:Big hug.
LEADFEMALE:This has been a great visit.
LEADMALE:Oh, this has been a wonderful visit.
SUPFEMALE:Al: let me do it again.
SUPFEMALE:And the sick thing is that i kind of miss 'em.
SUPFEMALE:I kind of don't.
OTHERMALE:Dan? what-ee? Pull my finger.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! Dan: here's the deal.
LEADMALE:I'll get the checkbook out, but i gotta watch.
LEADMALE:Hey, what a surprise.
LEADMALE:I was gunna do the line.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm not working, so i thought i'd come over and get some lines.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:How nice.
SUPMALE:That was fun.
LEADMALE:I never thought i'd say this, but i actually miss booker.
SUPMALE:Well, that's because our new supervisor's a real slime ball.
LEADFEMALE:I agree.
LEADFEMALE:That mr.
LEADFEMALE:Faber's a pain in the butt.
SUPMALE:Pardon my language.
SUPMALE:You sewer mouth! You know, faber wouldn't get on my nerves so much if he'd just die.
OTHERMALE:No, no, death's too good for him.
LEADFEMALE:What he really deserves is to have to work for himself.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I think we should explore this death idea a little further.
SUPFEMALE:Are you hens still cackling about the new rooster? When we find a rooster, lou, we'll cackle.
SUPMALE:Okay, lou, how? how do you handle faber? Two words: look busy.
OTHERMALE:Well, i got two words for you, lou.
LEADMALE:Anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Well, are you little ladies enjoying your lunch? Well, the veal is tres bien.
SUPFEMALE:And how was your swordfish, sis? As usual, the food is to die for, but the ambience stinks.
SUPMALE:Hey, uh, blondie, your work station's a mess.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we always clean up at the end of the day.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:But your area's an obvious safety hazard.
LEADFEMALE:And if you'll refer to the employee's manual, you'll note that the supervisor is responsible for spotting and eliminating safety hazards.
LEADFEMALE:Well, great, while you're doing that, can we see the dessert tray? I hate to give an order twice.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, sit down, blondie.
SUPFEMALE:This here is a job for a brunette.
LEADFEMALE:Super brunette! da-da-da-da! Faber: i wasn't talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:I was talking to her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then you're obviously tampering with destiny here, if you're willing to sweep up little bits of plastic on your lunch hour for no apparent reason.
LEADMALE:" da-da-da-da! Boy, one thing i hate to see in a plastics factory is little bits of plastic laying around.
LEADMALE:Well, they won't be laying around much longer, will they? so you're just gonna stand there and watch me? Maybe i will, maybe i won't.
LEADMALE:Well, that's a big decision there.
SUPFEMALE:I guess that's why they pay you the big bucks, huh? will you hold this for a minute? Honey, i'm not here to hold.
LEADMALE:I'm here to supervise.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, i get itshirt, tie.
LEADFEMALE:That's what you do.
LEADMALE:I must be stupid.
LEADMALE:Well, when you're right, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:How long you been here, anyway? Long enough.
OTHERMALE:Your, uh, personnel file says 11 years.
OTHERMALE:You know, the last three supervisors was checking out my personnel file, but do you see any of them around here? Your work is great compared to your attitude.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm just keeping the morale up, you know, trying to make your job easier.
SUPFEMALE:That's what i'm talking about, your attitude.
LEADFEMALE:Now, my brother has this dairy farm.
LEADFEMALE:You know, some of those cows take to milking right off, some of 'em take a little longer.
LEADFEMALE:Every once in a while you run across a real stubborn one.
LEADMALE:But you know what? Sooner or later they all give milk.
LEADMALE:Well, nothing like a little livestock story to start out the day.
LEADFEMALE:I think you know what i mean, sugar.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, you'll never believe what he wanted me to do! Well well, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Faber.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm afraid this old girl's got to put it to bed.
SUPMALE:Sylvia, it's friday night.
SUPFEMALE:And it's early.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but i need two days to recover.
LEADFEMALE:You know, these new quotas are killing me.
LEADMALE:Crystal: yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Night, sylvia.
LEADFEMALE:Faber's a maniac.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, he passed maniac about a month ago.
SUPFEMALE:You got that right.
LEADMALE:When i'm really smokin', i can pull maybe 15 units a minute.
SUPFEMALE:That's, uh, which is 7,200 units a day.
LEADMALE:And my quota's what does he think i am? A factory worker.
SUPMALE:You got that right.
LEADMALE:Here's a couple of cold ones for the tired working masses yearning to be free.
SUPMALE:Hey, don't forget the unemployed masses.
SUPMALE:I better not drink this.
LEADMALE:I may do something i regret.
SUPMALE:Yeah, like last time you left your barrettes in the bathroom.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm one sip of beer away from going over to the phone, calling that mr.
SUPFEMALE:Faber and giving him what for.
LEADMALE:Dan, you better hose her down.
OTHERMALE:My quota's 8,000.
LEADMALE:I can't do 8,000.
LEADMALE:I can maybe do 7,000.
LEADMALE:I don't know what's with this guy.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody can do 8,000 units.
OTHERMALE:Mm-mmm.
LEADFEMALE:I heard him say last week, there may not be any room at wellman for people who can't make the quota.
LEADMALE:He'd fire us for not making 8,000? We gotta put a contract out on this guy, or we gotta send somebody up to the front office and complain to mr.
SUPMALE:Wellman.
LEADFEMALE:What for? Wellman doesn't set the quotas.
LEADFEMALE:Faber does.
LEADFEMALE:I used to set 'em when i was there.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's so unfair.
SUPFEMALE:That scum bucket.
OTHERMALE:So we're killing ourselves so he can look good? It's so unfair! Now, when i was there, i never set the quota higher than 5,500.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, i like a guy with low standards.
LEADFEMALE:If faber set the quotas too high, you gotta tell him he's unrealistic.
LEADMALE:Not to mention just downright silly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan, cut me off.
LEADMALE:Well, somebody needs to go and talk to faber.
SUPFEMALE:Somebody needs to set this guy straight.
LEADMALE:Somebody really does.
LEADMALE:Well, somebody doesn't feel like it, so just forget about it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're talking about a guy that wants to see my head mounted above the women's restroom.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie: roseanne? remember when we were little kids and we used to go out in the backyard way in the corner so we couldn't see the house, and we'd imagine what we were gonna do when we grew up? I was gonna own and operate a chain of pet stores, and you were gonna go to new york city and become editor in chief of mother earth news.
LEADFEMALE:So, how come we're sitting in a dive like this figuring out how to hang on to a job that we hate for eight bucks an hour, which we can't even live off of anyway, try to fill quotas that we can't fill, 'cause if we don't, we're gonna get canned? It'syou got some pretzel hanging off your chin.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Well, you sure keep this place neater than booker ever did.
SUPMALE:And you got rid of miss january.
SUPFEMALE:I'm personally grateful for that.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want, roseanne? Well, i was wondering if we could maybe talk, you know, like people.
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Have yourself a seat, sugar.
LEADFEMALE:Can i close the door? Whenever that door closes, things tend to slow down out there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, i guess you're right about that.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you'd know.
SUPMALE:What can i do for you? Well, i was hoping that maybe this would be a good time to, um, discuss quotas.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you know that new that's, like, very difficult.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's very difficult.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are, working eight hours a day, and we're busting our hump, and we still come up short.
LEADMALE:We can't do it.
LEADMALE:It's very demoralizing, you know? Live with it.
OTHERMALE:Hey, i'm telling you that we can't meet our quotas.
SUPFEMALE:Then what do you suggest we do about it, honey bunch? I suggest you lower the quotas.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Then maybe a couple days a week we could all knock off early and have a factory picnic.
SUPMALE:Yeah, like that! Okay, like you lower the quotas, okay? what happens is, like, then morale goes up, and then when morale goes up, i mean, the productivity increases, you know? I mean, we look good, you look good.
OTHERFEMALE:I know how business works, sugar.
LEADMALE:You scratch my back, i scratch your back.
SUPMALE:Now, i'm more than willing to scratch your back.
LEADMALE:The big question is, are you willing to scratch mine? Now, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Faber isn't gonna pop out of a closet dressed up like a dutch girl, now is she? That's exactly what i'm talking about: disrespect and a smart mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, so just cut to the chase, faber.
LEADFEMALE:You want the quotas lowered? I'll lower the quotas.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:What a minute.
LEADMALE:I've still got an itch.
LEADMALE:So, lay it on me.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want? I want you to modify your behavior.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want you ever talking back to me.
SUPMALE:I don't want to be the butt of your jokes.
SUPFEMALE:And when you speak to me, i want you to do it with respect.
SUPMALE:And no one but you and me will ever know we had this little talk.
SUPFEMALE:No one, or else the quotas stay up and the pink slips go out.
LEADMALE:Do we have a deal? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, what? Yes, we have a deal.
LEADFEMALE:Sir.
OTHERMALE:What are you gonna do this weekend? Hey, that's right.
LEADMALE:We've got an actual weekend i don't have to use to catch up on sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:I never thought 6,500 units would seem like a vacation.
OTHERMALE:What do you guys got lined up? Oh, probably just the usual.
SUPMALE:I'm going to the science fair at willy's school.
LEADMALE:He made a brontosaurus out of egg cartons.
SUPFEMALE:Once when roseanne was in school, you made something out of egg cartons.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? Stonehenge.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you guys, uh, why don't we take care of this before we go on break? Why don't we take care of it after work? 'cause we're gonna get in a hassle with faber and he's gonna win, and life is just too short, so let's take care of it and forget about it.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, honey, you know the rule: no food outside the lunchroom.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:This is gum.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, doll.
SUPFEMALE:I appreciate your cooperation.
LEADMALE:And, uh when you're done here, would you mind putting some paper towels in the men's room? No, i don't mind.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:What's with you? Come on, he lowered the quota.
OTHERFEMALE:Why push our luck? Come on, mom! Yeah, just five more minutes.
LEADMALE:Not five more minutes.
OTHERMALE:Not one more minute.
LEADFEMALE:It is 9:00.
SUPMALE:What does that tell you? You're ticked off.
LEADFEMALE:Go.
OTHERMALE:What's all the hubbub, bub? You know, they're your kids too, or maybe you just don't even care what time they go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:They're two minutes late.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the big deal? The big deal is that they don't know how to obey the rules.
SUPFEMALE:What's the matter, hon? Don't call me hon.
LEADFEMALE:Babe, i've been calling you hon for 15 years.
SUPMALE:Don't call me babe neither.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, lady! I'm sorry, dan.
LEADMALE:It ain't you.
SUPMALE:That faber guy? god, i hate him! Want me to beat him up for you? No.
LEADMALE:Come on, i will.
LEADMALE:What would you do to him? Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay, like, um, i'd wait for him by the bike rack after school.
LEADMALE:And then, you know, i'd wait for him to come out of gym class, um, and i'd put a bunch of marbles in my sock and i'd say, "hey, keith, come on over to my house after school.
LEADFEMALE:I've got the original cast recording of carousel.
SUPMALE:" god, i sold my soul to the devil for 6,500 units! What the hell are you talking about? I made a deal with him.
LEADFEMALE:He said he'd lower the quotas if i lowered myself and showed him some respect, but a little's turned into a lot.
SUPMALE:I just can't take it anymore.
LEADMALE:Honey, if you're that miserable, just quit.
LEADMALE:It's not worth it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't quit.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can't go on like this.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, i'd lose everything.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't get any hospitalization.
OTHERMALE:I couldn't get any kind of unemployment.
LEADMALE:The kids could never get sick, or grow.
OTHERMALE:We had kids before we had hospitalization.
OTHERMALE:We'll manage.
SUPMALE:It'll take a long time to find another job.
SUPMALE:We'll manage.
LEADFEMALE:We got married, they said we wouldn't make it.
SUPFEMALE:We had three kids, they said we wouldn't make it.
LEADMALE:You know what we're like? We're like one of those clown balloons that every time you knock it over, it just turns right-side up again.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, say i quit, okay? and then becky comes in here and she wants a new pair of designer jeans, okay? Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:So then what are you gonna tell her? Well, i'd have to tell her the truth.
LEADMALE:I'd just look her right in the eye and say, "honey, you know you could've had those jeans if your mom hadn't been a big baby and quit her job.
LEADFEMALE:" supportive? I think so.
SUPMALE:Not.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, you know i'm right.
OTHERFEMALE:Admit it.
LEADMALE:Jackie, did it ever occur to you that maybe i just do not like putting people down? No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:It did occur to me that you were losing your touch.
LEADMALE:Well, think again.
SUPFEMALE:How about yesterday? Faber was in here throwing his weight around, you had a golden opportunity to slam him, and you didn't.
LEADFEMALE:You stooped to an all-time low and called him "sir.
LEADFEMALE:" don't remind me.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with you? Jackie, maybe she's going through something personal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, right, crystal.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies, can i have your attention? Sure, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Faber.
LEADMALE:I have a little announcement to make.
LEADFEMALE:Now, plastics is a competitive industry.
LEADMALE:Now, let's face it, we make money selling product.
OTHERMALE:So it only stands to reason, the more product we sell, the more money we're gonna make.
OTHERMALE:So what are you raising our quotas to? Nothing you girls can't handle.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna try and i have every confidence that you girls can cut the mustard.
LEADFEMALE:And if you can't, it's been nice working with you.
SUPMALE:Can you believe that? I'll never make that quota.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
LEADMALE:I'll be there in a minute.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell do you think you're doing? We had a deal.
LEADFEMALE:The operative word here, roseanne, is "had.
OTHERFEMALE:" yeah, i know who you are.
OTHERMALE:I know who you are, and if you didn't have this job, you'd be in an alley.
LEADMALE:You sound angry, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:You told me if i towed the line that you'd drop the quotas.
LEADMALE:Why are you doing this? Because i can.
SUPMALE:No, you can't.
LEADMALE:I did, and when i broke you, i knew you were just like the rest of 'em.
LEADFEMALE:And you'll stay and you'll do your 8,000, and so will your loser friends, or they're gone.
SUPFEMALE:Well, this ain't the way you motivate people.
LEADFEMALE:And you know what? Any manager would know that.
LEADFEMALE:And you are a lot of things, but you ain't no manager.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetheart, you just bought yourself a bunch of trouble.
LEADMALE:No, sweetheart, you did.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i'm not done with you.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you walk away when i'm talking to you.
SUPFEMALE:You okay, sis? No, i'm not okay.
SUPMALE:I mean, i tried to be okay, but he doesn't want me to be okay.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't want any of us to be okay.
SUPMALE:You know why? because he's not okay, okay? Roseanne, i told you not to walk away from me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm walking away from you, faber, and i'm walking away from this stinking factory.
LEADFEMALE:I'm walking away from this lousy job.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that was a wonderful performance, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:But if any of you are considering joining her, may i point out there are two doors to this room: one that pays and one that doesn't.
SUPFEMALE:I guess we're not gonna make our quota today, honey bunch.
SUPMALE:Here goes.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe i did this.
OTHERMALE:I mean, i'm glad i did it, but i can't believe i did it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so you spilled the beer nuts.
LEADMALE:Big deal.
LEADMALE:I can't believe i quit.
SUPMALE:Oh, oh.
SUPMALE:You know, i was at that factory longer than anybody here.
SUPMALE:You know what i'm going to miss about wellman most? Not one damn thing! I can't believe i quit.
LEADFEMALE:It's high time that we thank the woman responsible for our emancipationmy sister, ex-wellman employee, and a heck of a woman in her own rightwhat was your name again? Sally field.
OTHERMALE:All: yay!
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Ok, so you've got of mad, well illustrated.
LEADMALE:6 months of kings of drag racing and 24 months of indoor soccer weekly.
LEADFEMALE:And the magazines should be arriving in four to six weeks.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:From my mouth to god's ear.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice work, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Real smooth.
LEADMALE:You know what i like about this job, dan? Nothing.
SUPMALE:That's the spirit! D.j. , by the time you move, i'll be going through menopause.
SUPMALE:Darlene nice move, buddy! ha! King me.
SUPMALE:Dad, you gave him a triple jump! Well, i already took my hand off.
OTHERMALE:You're just letting him win 'cause he's a midget.
LEADFEMALE:Am not! are, too! Why don't you take a break, babe? I can't, dan.
LEADMALE:This is my prime time.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody's home fighting with their spouse and being tortured by their children.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, some people are even feeding their children.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's because some people's children have already set the table.
LEADMALE:I talk too much.
LEADMALE:Ok, deej, what do you say we call it a tie? I had you! D.j. , you can't play checkers to save your life.
SUPMALE:Darlene, put out the forks and stick one in your tongue.
LEADMALE:Is my hair ok like this? I guess so.
SUPMALE:We're only havin' hamburgers.
LEADMALE:It makes me look older, don't you think? Jimmy's a junior.
SUPFEMALE:Who's jimmy? You don't know him.
LEADFEMALE:He's in high school.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Jimmy meltrigger's the varsity quarterback.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Tell him no taking the snap on the first date.
OTHERMALE:Dan! Just trying to get her ready for game time.
LEADMALE:Well, when is game time, by the way? Tomorrow night.
SUPFEMALE:He's picking me up here.
SUPMALE:As opposed to where, motel 6? why don't you wear your blue sweater outfit? You look really good in that.
LEADMALE:I might, but if i do wear it, it won't be because of you.
LEADMALE:I was just trying to help.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't.
LEADMALE:Fine! Go ahead and wear one of your dorky big-butt outfits.
OTHERFEMALE:This is magazine discount house.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene, get the door.
LEADFEMALE:Why do i always have to get the door? You don't always have to get the door.
LEADMALE:I'll go.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, crystal.
LEADMALE:Hello, hello, hello! Hey, crystal, did you get the dress? Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:I went through my cousin beverly's closet and i found a treasure.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow night, roseanne, you will be the belle of the ball! I'd rather wear the bag.
OTHERMALE:What's wrong with it? Well, you stick a couple candles in my nose, and i'd look like a birthday cake.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks anyway, crystal.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, you just better go to this thing all by yourself.
LEADMALE:No dice, babe.
LEADFEMALE:You gotta go.
SUPFEMALE:It's a grand opening.
LEADMALE:I dry walled this bank for you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why couldn't you have dry walled some dress shop for me? Come on, you'll have a great time.
LEADMALE:Free champagne, live band, all the shrimp you can eat, and, yes, me.
LEADMALE:What more could you want? I want a new dress.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you have any money? Well, i did, but i blew it on tube socks for d.j. damn! I hate myself.
SUPMALE:Hey, i know where you can borrow a really nice dress, but you've got to be open.
SUPFEMALE:What is that supposed to mean? By open, i mean i know someone who you can borrow a dress from, but when i mention her name, you got to promise you won't scream.
LEADMALE:I promise.
SUPMALE:Edna debelco.
LEADMALE:Aah! who's edna debelco? Aah! She's a really wonderful person, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne's just screamin' because she thinks edna's a whinin', complainin', sniveling kletch.
OTHERMALE:Kvetch.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, what do you think of this dress? Stick a few candles in it and make a wish.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, mom, what you workin' on? Invoices.
SUPFEMALE:I'm ordering new children.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Well, why don't we trade becky in for a partially tattooed latin boy of 16? 'cause that's my christmas present to myself.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it.
OTHERFEMALE:Could this woman be my little becky? Not all of her.
SUPFEMALE:If i were you, i'd check upstairs for some missing kleenex.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you have such a big mouth.
LEADFEMALE:And you have such a small chest.
SUPMALE:At least i have a chest.
SUPFEMALE:At least i'm no drooling, boy-crazed nymphomaniac.
LEADMALE:Hey, leave me out of this.
LEADMALE:You're just jealous 'cause i have a date.
OTHERFEMALE:And a two-ply chest.
LEADFEMALE:Hermaphrodite.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? how does this skirt look with this sweater? Good.
SUPFEMALE:Mom? Just fine.
LEADMALE:Really? Really.
LEADMALE:Dad? Terrific.
OTHERMALE:Promise? Promise.
LEADMALE:Mom? becky, would you relax? Your date's not even until tonight.
LEADMALE:But i'm giving my report in front of the whole student council today, and jimmy meltrigger head of my committee.
LEADFEMALE:Really, mom? Really.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Becky.
LEADMALE:What? Come here.
SUPMALE:What? You forgot your report.
LEADMALE:I gotta go.
LEADFEMALE:I got to go over to the lumberyard and talk to joey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, when you go over there to pick up your tuxedo, make sure you get the shoes that go with it.
LEADMALE:I will.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, you better put a note on your windshield.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't worry about me.
LEADFEMALE:What are you gonna wear? Well, in the immortal words of dan conner on his wedding day, "babe, i'm gonna wear what i'm gonna wear.
LEADMALE:Ptooey!" and whatever it is, i'm sure you'll look as terrific as i did.
LEADMALE:Hi, edna it's roseanne conner.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you? Good evening.
SUPFEMALE:This is vanessa from the magazine discount house.
SUPMALE:And since you're a preferred customer with a credit card, i'm prepared to offer you a 1, 2 or 3 year subscription to your favorite magazines at prices substantially lower than that what you pay at the newsstands.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Same to you! Hello.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, edna.
OTHERFEMALE:Aah! Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:I tried it on, and it fits perfectly.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't try to lance that thing by myself.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! oh! Dan hurt himself, edna.
LEADMALE:I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i thought you had pep squad today.
LEADMALE:I'm quitting pep squad! i'm quitting school! i'm never going back again! if anybody calls me, tell 'em i'm dead! Well, it must be serious.
LEADFEMALE:She's not takin' phone calls.
SUPFEMALE:Where is she? where is my sister? She went upstairs.
LEADMALE:Aha! I'll nail her on her home turf.
LEADFEMALE:Nah, you're not nailin' nobody.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? I've been waiting for something like this since i was 2.
LEADMALE:You passed a test! Enlighten us.
OTHERMALE:I'd be glad to.
LEADFEMALE:Now this is according to cheryl brewer whose older sister not only goes to lanford high, is also on the student council, and had a ringside seat for the event of the century.
SUPFEMALE:Get to the point, edna.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, this is great.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Here goes.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, here goes.
SUPMALE:Hotshot becky's standing up to give her speech in front of all her snotty high school friends-georgina wellen, linda ferramin, diane "the schnozz" birelli, and mr.
LEADMALE:Perfect, jimmy meltrigger.
OTHERFEMALE:There she is, all dressed up trying to look so cool, with her hair perfect that she spent in the bathroom-darlene.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Well, just as she completes the line, "i'd like to thank the student council for allowing me to speak my mind," it happened.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Beckycut the cheese.
LEADFEMALE:People are already calling her "conner the bomber.
SUPFEMALE:" darlene, give it a rest.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, poor becky.
LEADMALE:She should be proud.
LEADFEMALE:Becky conner-the only woman to break the sound barrier without a plane.
LEADFEMALE:You know this could've happened to you.
SUPFEMALE:I think i'm gonna go upstairs and see how her day went.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:I think you're just gonna go on in the kitchen and fix yourself a snack.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not hungry.
SUPMALE:Well, then, go out there and stay there till you are.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, now what? shut up, dan! What? This isn't funny.
LEADMALE:This is totally serious.
LEADFEMALE:Mm--why don't you go up-upstairs and talk to her? 'cause i figure this is your area of expertise.
SUPMALE:Ok, ok.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't make it.
LEADFEMALE:Honey.
LEADFEMALE:What? I owe you one.
LEADMALE:I heard you laid down the law.
SUPMALE:Who told you? It was on the news.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene told me.
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, honey, accidents happen.
LEADMALE:Well, this one happened in front of the whole student council.
SUPMALE:Everybody heard it.
LEADFEMALE:Jimmy meltrigger heard it.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want this, ok? well, what about your date with jimmy? what do you think? You know, when i was in high school, i kept this diary-i've heard the diary story.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, i've made some revisions.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, and in this diary i had written down my innermost secrets.
LEADMALE:All my fantasies and love poems, all that really embarrassing crap.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, and some guy stole it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and read it to the whole school.
SUPMALE:I wanted to crawl into a hole and die.
LEADFEMALE:That was the worst thing i've ever lived through.
OTHERMALE:But, you know, to this day, i don't even remember that guy's name.
SUPMALE:Barry watnick.
LEADMALE:His name was barry watnick.
LEADMALE:Every time you tell that story, you say, "i can remember it "like it was yesterday.
OTHERMALE:That creep barry watnick stole my diary.
SUPFEMALE:" nice try.
SUPFEMALE:Lonnie told me about becky's unfortunate accident.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so sorry.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we're thinking of having her put to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:I bought becky a card.
SUPMALE:Well, how thoughtful.
SUPFEMALE:And strange.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to drop lonnie off at the y, then i'll be back to do your make-up.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, crystal.
SUPMALE:You know, they say they make a card for everything.
LEADMALE:What do you wanna bet? I'll be damned.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's the remote.
LEADFEMALE:Plfft! Roseanne, why don't you let me talk to becky? No, she's already close enough to the edge.
LEADMALE:You know what i'm gonna do, roseanne? I'm gonna leave you some samples.
SUPFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
OTHERMALE:What's so funny? Oh, i was just remembering the time when you dove into the ivy street pool, and came up, and had a whole conversation with henry jywicki with your left buoy bobbing on the surf.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, lord.
SUPMALE:That never happened.
LEADMALE:You don't remember that henry jywicki spent the rest of his summer riding his bike around our driveway.
LEADMALE:That never happened, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:If that would have happened, i would have been more popular in high school.
OTHERFEMALE:It was you had on that stars and stripes bathing suit because you said it reminded you of peter fonda's helmet in easy rider.
LEADMALE:And when you came up, half the country had disappeared.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:I had completely forgotten about that.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her.
LEADMALE:Becky, i heard about what happened to you at school today.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanted to tell you that it reminded me of the time when your mom dove into a public pool and came up with half her bathing suit off.
LEADFEMALE:Which half? The northern states.
LEADMALE:I was so crushed, i didn't even go back to that pool for the rest of summer.
SUPFEMALE:What's your point? well, the point is that when it happened to me, i was so humiliated i thought i'd never get over it, you know? But until just now, i had completely forgotten about it.
OTHERMALE:And you remembered it? Oh, yeah, like it was yesterday.
LEADMALE:That was the talk of the town.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! I ran into henry jywicki just the other day at the hardware store.
LEADMALE:He asked me if you were gonna be joining the pool again this summer.
LEADMALE:Then he made that face.
LEADMALE:Here she is, miss america miss conner hails from lanford, illinois.
LEADFEMALE:Her goal is to achieve peace on earth, and her hobbies include windsurfing and satisfying her man.
LEADMALE:You look great, mom.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, deej.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go get your pjs on.
SUPMALE:I'll get it if i can come out of the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:If you come out of the kitchen, you're gonna get it.
LEADMALE:Ooh, notice me tremble.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I'm here to pick up becky.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:You must be jimmy.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Nice house.
OTHERFEMALE:Guess you don't get out much.
LEADFEMALE:Well, becky's still upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Can i get you something to drink? No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Really.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine.
SUPMALE:You must be darlene.
SUPMALE:Why? Your sister was right.
LEADMALE:You're pretty cute.
SUPMALE:Becky said that? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You're sure you don't want something to drink? Uh, no, i'm all right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you do want anything, i'll be in the kitchen for the rest of my life.
LEADMALE:I'll go tell becky you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Have a seat.
LEADFEMALE:Miss moneypenny, i've spoken to q.
OTHERMALE:We've deposited the microfilm in a vault in zurich.
OTHERFEMALE:Move.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, becky tells me you're a quarterback.
SUPMALE:Uh, no, i'm a cornerback.
LEADFEMALE:I feel much safer knowing my daughter's going out with a defensive player.
LEADMALE:You know, i, uh, i see your picture in the trophy case at school.
OTHERMALE:The illinois regionals.
LEADMALE:They say you were one of the best linemen ever to play for lanford.
SUPFEMALE:Jimmy, are you sayin' all this to get on my good side? Yes, i am.
LEADMALE:It's working.
LEADMALE:So jimbo, tell me a little bit more about yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Like, for example, why you idolize me.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, jimmy meltrigger's downstairs waitin' for you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god.
OTHERMALE:That's what i said.
LEADFEMALE:"ooh, he ain't bad.
SUPFEMALE:" i can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:He's here? oh, my god, what is he doing here? Well, right now he's charming the rented pants off your father.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, look, i can't see him.
LEADFEMALE:Tell him i'm sick.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, becky, get off it already.
LEADMALE:It wasn't such a terrible thing that happened.
OTHERFEMALE:The proof of it is that jimmy's downstairs waitin' for you.
LEADFEMALE:He's just keepin' the date to be nice.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and what a rotten character trait that is.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, i'm gonna run into everyone i know.
LEADMALE:Becky, what are you afraid of? They were laughing at me, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:So you made a little boombie in front of everybody.
LEADMALE:You're just upset 'cause you don't like to do anything unless you got it written down on a pad beforehand.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what happened was just one of those spontaneous little surprises that life is full of.
OTHERFEMALE:And fortunately, no one was hurt.
OTHERFEMALE:You better get used to it, too, because i'm tellin' you, life is full of boombies.
LEADFEMALE:Now why don't you get downstairs before aunt jackie runs off with your date? mom? you're not gonna do it again, are you? No.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanted to tell you you look real nice.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i do, don't i? Uh-huh, uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Ed--edna, have you tried takin' a hot bath? I'll go on record right now and say that high-top cleats will definitely be back in.
LEADMALE:Hey, look at.
LEADMALE:They've bonded.
SUPMALE:Isn't that cute? hey, becky, how you doin'? Hi, jimmy.
LEADMALE:Come on, dan.
LEADMALE:We're gonna be late.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, i'll get the chariot.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, if you don't have her home by midnight, i'll clothesline you.
LEADMALE:Hey, see you at 10:30, sis.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you be good.
LEADMALE:Will you tell crystal thanks? Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:She'll still be talking to edna when you get back.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, have fun, you guys.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that must be my limo.
LEADMALE:I wasn't sure you'd show up.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't sure you'd be up for goin' out.
LEADMALE:Well, i am.
LEADMALE:So am i.
SUPFEMALE:So, listen.
LEADMALE:Everything else aside, what did you think of my speech? Captioned by the national 
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Ohh! roseanne ohh! Roseanne, it's not that bad.
LEADMALE:Oh, they call this a haircut? It looks ok, really.
OTHERFEMALE:Just like d.j. what are you reading? My police manual.
OTHERMALE:What? You know, i could be making $3,000 a month if i get accepted.
OTHERMALE:You're joking.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I already applied.
LEADFEMALE:Knock knock.
LEADMALE:Anybody home.
SUPFEMALE:Cut it out.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll have you arrested for assaulting a future officer.
SUPMALE:You're goofin' on me, right? Not that i know of.
SUPMALE:You mean to tell me that you went ahead and did this without even talking to me? god, roseanne, can't you show a little enthusiasm for me? I'm excited about this.
LEADMALE:If i was to show enthusiasm every time you got excited, i would've run out of enthusiasm by the time i was 6.
LEADMALE:I knew i shouldn't have said anything about it.
LEADFEMALE:I just should've just come over one day, cuffed you, gagged you, told you, and left.
OTHERMALE:Well, don't you even want to know what i think? No, i don't.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, then i'll tell you what i don't think.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you're cop material.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? you don't, huh? You don't even know what cop material is.
LEADMALE:What do you think now? Let's see you get out of that.
LEADMALE:You don't think i'm cop material now, huh? You are messing up my hair! I am releasing you on your own recognizance.
LEADMALE:You know, being a cop is something that takes a lot of commitment-not your strong point.
LEADFEMALE:Besides that, you're not a kid anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Look, just because you may not want me to do it, doesn't mean i don't want to do it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you don't even know what you're doing.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, jackie, grow up.
LEADMALE:Oh, go to hell.
LEADMALE:This is hell.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe jackie wants to be a cop.
LEADFEMALE:She does look good in boots.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious, dan.
LEADMALE:I know you are, babe.
SUPFEMALE:I'm having real trouble with the concept of somebody calling her officer.
SUPFEMALE:Officer jackie.
OTHERMALE:I'm really worried about her.
LEADFEMALE:I just hope she doesn't get accepted.
SUPFEMALE:They'll accept her, all right.
SUPMALE:Based on what? Based on the fact that the lanford police department is run by a bunch of bozos-half of whom your sister's dated.
LEADMALE:Don't talk about my sister like that.
LEADMALE:That's my job.
LEADFEMALE:Mmmunbelievable! That chili is gonna be hanging from the ceiling of the smithsonian.
OTHERMALE:Summon the children, fifi.
OTHERFEMALE:Food! I thought jackie was staying for dinner.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:She's mad at me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm mad at you, and i stuck around.
OTHERMALE:I'm mad at you because i got my hair cut today and you didn't even notice.
LEADFEMALE:I did so notice, moe.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do you think i'm mad at you? Spread out.
SUPMALE:You are such a liar! You used it, didn't you? No, i didn't.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just tell the truth for once.
SUPMALE:Ok, i will.
LEADFEMALE:The truth is, you're a dink.
SUPFEMALE:We are family don't ever touch my things again.
LEADMALE:I got all my sisters with me i'll touch whatever i want.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, not chili.
SUPMALE:Not just any chili-my famous chili.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, dan conner's magic chili, with the freshest ingredients, straight from the conner family farm.
LEADMALE:I want fish sticks.
SUPMALE:Well, it's nice to have a dream.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight we're trying a variation on my classic recipe-beef chili vegetarian style.
SUPMALE:Oh, gross! I'm not gonna drink out of that.
SUPMALE:You put your finger in it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPMALE:This finger's clean.
LEADFEMALE:I had it in my nose all day.
LEADFEMALE:You are such a little twerp.
LEADMALE:I'm embarrassed we're related.
SUPFEMALE:At least, i'm not a pervert.
LEADMALE:You're disgusting.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but i'm not the one who was reading dad's magazine.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's hush up.
LEADMALE:Come on, we're having dinner here.
LEADFEMALE:What magazine? Girls, girls, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, dan, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, i know what you're gonna say, and you're absolutely right, but i just don't think you should say it in front of the children.
LEADMALE:You have such a big mouth.
SUPFEMALE:You know, darlene, it's not nice to tattle on people, especially people who do really stupid things that they know they shouldn't do.
LEADMALE:Ow.
LEADMALE:Darlene's a tattletale, tattletale.
SUPMALE:D.j. 's right.
OTHERFEMALE:You shouldn't rat on people.
OTHERFEMALE:And you should keep your mitts off other people's belongings.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody, calm down.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother's right.
LEADMALE:Listen to her.
SUPFEMALE:She's been busting her hump all day, cooking and cleaning.
LEADMALE:She doesn't need this aggravation.
LEADMALE:Would you like a little wine with dinner, honey? Forget about it, dan.
LEADMALE:I took a shot.
SUPFEMALE:I thought i told you to take that magazine and get it out of this house.
LEADMALE:It is out of the house.
OTHERMALE:It's in the garage.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like it was in the trash.
OTHERFEMALE:It was right on your workbench.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:My workbench.
SUPFEMALE:As in, my private workbench.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Quiet.
LEADFEMALE:You're the one who started this whole thing.
SUPFEMALE:Instead of picking on me, why don't you ask becky what she was doing looking at that nudie magazine? Shut up, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:You want to be like those girls, don't you? Shut up! You know you do.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you show mom and dad your sexy walk? I hate you.
LEADFEMALE:Ow, you sexy thang.
SUPFEMALE:What? Snitch.
LEADFEMALE:What about becky? We're talking about you.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky never does anything wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Everything is always my fault.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:This is stuff that's happened since you were born.
LEADMALE:Go apologize to your sister.
OTHERMALE:No way! Ha ha.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't hit your brother when he's eating.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sick of this stupid house.
SUPMALE:I can't do anything right.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you think you're going? We handled that well.
LEADFEMALE:What disgusting thing are you reading now? The growth of our nation.
LEADFEMALE:Eww, you are a pervert.
LEADMALE:What? I just want to know why men like those magazines.
LEADMALE:Why do they want to look at a bunch of women who they don't even know? Well, they actually believe those women are looking back at them.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think these girls' fathers say to them? They probably don't say too much, which is probably one of the reasons why they end up in those magazines.
LEADFEMALE:I feel bad for them.
LEADMALE:Yeah me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know that women didn't get to vote until 1920? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And as i recall, we all voted no.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, according to mom, becky's always good and i'm always bad.
LEADFEMALE:Like if becky gets an "a" in something, it's this big deal.
LEADMALE:But if i get an "a" in something, mom just ignores it.
LEADMALE:You got an "a"? No.
LEADMALE:But if i did, she would.
SUPFEMALE:You know what becky's favorite thing to say is? Grow up.
LEADMALE:You know where she gets that from? From your mom.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not fair.
SUPFEMALE:Life is unfair.
OTHERMALE:Life is this big unfair thing.
SUPMALE:One day i'm getting even.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna have a neat place just like this, and i'm never gonna invite her over.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you will.
SUPFEMALE:That's what's unfair.
LEADMALE:You're her sister, and you're never going to get rid of her.
LEADMALE:If i hear "grow up" one more time, boom, i'm not gonna have a sister.
LEADMALE:Me either.
SUPFEMALE:I went over there today from my house to her house with a dream.
SUPMALE:A little dream.
LEADMALE:And she took that dream, and she stomped it.
SUPFEMALE:And after she stomped it, she kicked it in the gutter.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she probably didn't mean it.
LEADMALE:That's your mom's way of being in control all the time constantly.
LEADFEMALE:But let's face it.
LEADMALE:Without your mom, life, as we know it, would end.
OTHERMALE:If she's so important, how come she can't get a job? That's right.
SUPFEMALE:Your mom didn't even have the brains to say yes to your dad when your dad asked your mom to marry me-her-him.
SUPFEMALE:You know what i mean? But little jackie, who, according to your mom, can't even balance a checkbook, which, by the way, i had a checking account long before she ever did because i went down to grey rock bank and got a check book, by myself, without any help from her.
LEADMALE:And they had-they had this really gross security guard there named eddie.
LEADMALE:And your mom and i used to call him eddie spaghetti.
LEADMALE:And you know something else? I had to tell her what a great catch she'd be passing up.
LEADFEMALE:Your mom is the one that can't even balance a checkbook.
SUPFEMALE:If she's so good with money, how come i always have to lend her money? I bought that glove they paid for you last year.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Well, that's ok.
LEADFEMALE:That's what sisters are for.
LEADFEMALE:You want something to drink? No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm gonna get a little something.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! aunt jackie! Oh, there's all kinds of gravity in here.
LEADMALE:I got to get my sea legs.
OTHERMALE:You know what? You are always welcome in my house and so am i.
SUPFEMALE:You know what? I am going to go and take a little nap just for one minute.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, roseanne? should i get that? Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Mom um everything's fine.
SUPMALE:Aunt jackie and i are just talking and having a great time.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to spend the night, ok? I feel a lot better.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, bye.
LEADFEMALE:I am a good cop.
LEADFEMALE:A really good cop.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious, mother.
LEADFEMALE:Bacon is loaded with sodium, nitrates, grease, and animal fat.
LEADFEMALE:Breakfast! Down 2 inches.
OTHERMALE:Straight, straight, straight, right, left, straight, straight, straight down.
SUPMALE:Drop that pig meat, cover hog.
LEADFEMALE:Cover hog? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? yeah? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Down.
SUPFEMALE:We missing an offspring? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you think i got the bacon? three pieces? Hey, i didn't get any.
OTHERMALE:Hypocrite.
LEADFEMALE:Two pieces? Just 'cause you bring home the bacon, don't mean you get to eat it all.
LEADMALE:I guess you told me.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i did.
SUPFEMALE:You're so smart, let me ask you one thing.
LEADMALE:How come your face is smooth this way and so rough that way? what did i tell you about foreplay in front of the kids? Morning.
SUPMALE:Hey, come here, you.
LEADMALE:Darlene.
SUPMALE:There's more.
LEADMALE:No, there isn't.
LEADMALE:Oh, here, take it.
LEADFEMALE:Did you have fun last night? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:What did you guys end up doing? We drove into chicago and picked up a couple of sailors.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, get a plate.
LEADMALE:I'm finished.
LEADMALE:Isn't that halley's comet? Forget about it.
OTHERMALE:What's your aunt jackie doing today? Sleeping.
LEADMALE:Why, did you guys end up staying up late? Well, you know how those sailors love to party.
LEADFEMALE:So so, what did you guys talk about last night? me? what did your aunt jackie say? Ask her yourself.
LEADMALE:I'm not a tattletale.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's not really tattling if i have to beat it out of you.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hiya, kid.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for putting the pail by the bed.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, aunt jackie's got her hang-over glasses on.
SUPMALE:Was she drinking last night? did you get drunk while my kid was over there? No.
LEADFEMALE:I was drunk before she got over there.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, would you like to help me work on the boat? No, not really.
LEADMALE:So would your brother and sister.
SUPFEMALE:Come along.
LEADMALE:What do you mean going and getting plowed? what is your problem? You.
LEADFEMALE:You.
SUPMALE:You are my problem.
LEADMALE:What did i do now? Same thing as you always do, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You sit up there on your-pedestal? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You act like some big high and mighty, self-righteous pedestal-type person.
LEADMALE:And you poo-poo everything in my life.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And you go right for your addictive behavior 'cause you cannot handle conflict.
SUPMALE:That's the whole thing.
LEADMALE:You cannot handle conflict.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, we saw that whole thing on oprah-people who cannot handle conflict, so right away, they run for the alcohol.
LEADMALE:Well, have another shot of pancake, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:You know, people who live in glass houses shouldn't eat stones.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we're not talking about me.
SUPMALE:I am.
OTHERFEMALE:I am talking about you.
LEADFEMALE:Just once, one time, i would like for you to be for me, to be on my side, for me alone.
LEADMALE:So that doesn't have anything to do with you.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe i would do that if you ever came up with some kind of an idea i could actually support.
LEADMALE:What is wrong with that idea? what is wrong with me becoming a policewoman? Yes, i know sometimes i start on things and i never follow through with 'em.
LEADFEMALE:And i know that sometimes i get jazzed about stuff that's not even ever going to happen.
LEADMALE:But this is gonna happen, and i wish you would give me some support.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't you just go and be something like a meter maid? I mean, you used to work at wellman.
LEADFEMALE:You're used to handling small change.
OTHERFEMALE:See, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Again, what do i have to do to convince you that i could be a cop? beat you up? Yeah, not on your best day.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh! Come on.
SUPMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Take your best shot.
LEADFEMALE:Take your best shot.
LEADMALE:You know that i would just knock your lights out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Make my day.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! ow! ow! ow! let me up! let me up! Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Is this like a sex thing? 'cause if it is, i'll go get the camera, and we can toss that magazine again.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, get her off of me! Don't you come near me.
OTHERMALE:I'll break her wrist.
SUPFEMALE:Dan! I think she means it, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I do mean it.
LEADFEMALE:She does mean it, folks.
OTHERMALE:And this is the grudge match we've all been waiting for.
SUPMALE:Throw out the rule book.
LEADFEMALE:The lanford wrestling federation rules do not apply.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:She's serious, folks.
LEADMALE:I'm really serious! She's really serious.
OTHERMALE:You apologize to me for never being on my side.
SUPFEMALE:I have nothing to apologize for.
OTHERFEMALE:Ow! Ooh, this is not for the squeamish.
LEADMALE:I think that wrist is about to go.
LEADMALE:Ohh! You come on, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Ok, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Louder.
SUPFEMALE:Now, this is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! i'm sorry! i'm sorry! Say it like you mean it.
LEADMALE:I mean it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:It's an apology to the head.
OTHERMALE:Dan, get out of here.
LEADMALE:Get the hell out of here! I'm out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, why are you sorry? Let me sit up, and i'll tell you why.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! Ok, you want to be a cop, fine.
LEADMALE:I will support you.
LEADMALE:But i just have to make one point before i do.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, pig.
SUPMALE:I've got a gun, and i'm going to blow your head off.
LEADMALE:What are you going to do about it? Slap your hand away.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead.
SUPMALE:Bang! You're dead, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:You're dead.
LEADMALE:Get it? Meter maid is good.
LEADFEMALE:Get a little uniform, drive a nice car, get some benefits, take home some money.
SUPFEMALE:Meter maid is not bad.
SUPFEMALE:That's a good idea, sis.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:And then you'll give some guy a ticket, and he'll get out of his car and blow your head off.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so now you don't want me to be a meter maid?
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, knock it off.
OTHERFEMALE:Good afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:This is roseanne at the magazine discount house.
OTHERMALE:Mom's trying to work! So.
SUPFEMALE:I worked today, too.
LEADMALE:Shh! Don't shush me.
LEADMALE:D.j. , don't make me kill you.
OTHERMALE:Than what you find at the newsstands.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I'm not interested either, but it's my job.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, what is your problem? I'm hungry.
OTHERMALE:Well, dinner ain't ready yet.
SUPMALE:I'm hungry now.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, here.
LEADFEMALE:Start on this.
LEADFEMALE:I hear fleece is very high in fiber.
SUPMALE:Mommy, dial the next number? Hit it, partner.
LEADMALE:Doesn't anyone want to hear about my day? No.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:My mom would like to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Good afternoon.
SUPMALE:This is magazine at the rose-hey, babe, how's it going? Death.
LEADMALE:Death.

OTHERMALE:Hey, i may not have to.
LEADFEMALE:Remember vonda's husband? Yeah, sure.
SUPFEMALE:Paul.
SUPFEMALE:Phil.
SUPMALE:He works over there at, uh garvin meat packing plant, and he got me an interview for a job tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah? what do you know about packing meat? Well, i've been living with a rump roast for 15 years.
SUPMALE:Be sure to put that on your resume.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so they need somebody to start right away, so i'm gonna go meet with the manager tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Hey, get this.
LEADMALE:I actually had to turn down a job today.
LEADFEMALE:You believe it? Gee, dan, tell me about your day.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious.
LEADMALE:The driveway job over at old oaks? We're too busy.
LEADMALE:You're just a regular big shot.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What's for supper? Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:Uncooked meat.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, and i was just wormed.
LEADMALE:Oh, i can't believe it.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't do anything right anymore.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know, babe.
LEADFEMALE:You know it just might be time to send you down to the minors.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, beckers, what's up? Becky wants to know if she can go over to diane's after school.
SUPFEMALE:It is after school.
SUPMALE:Where is she now? where are you now? Diane's.
LEADMALE:Hey, becky, you were supposed to go to the store for me after school today.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i was on the phone all day.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you want your own phone, you gotta buy your own house.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you might as well eat over at diane's.
LEADFEMALE:Call us when you're done.
LEADFEMALE:We'll pick you up.
SUPFEMALE:Have fun.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Who wants to have dinner at wagon train? Yeah, daddy! we're going to have dinner at wagon train?! You bet we are.
LEADFEMALE:Saddle up, pard.
LEADMALE:Why are we going out? is the can opener broken? Ha ha.
LEADMALE:No fooling you young'uns.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to ride shotgun.
SUPMALE:So anyway, vonda's husband's been working there for 8 years, you know, and they live pretty damn well.
LEADMALE:I mean, he started off on the loading dock, and already he's a foreman you know ahem.
OTHERMALE:So they really take care of their own.
OTHERMALE:As opposed to wellman, where we start off on the loading dock and end up in the parking lot.
LEADMALE:Sit still.
LEADMALE:And vonda says that they're really nice.
OTHERMALE:They're always having, like, company picnics and junk like that.
LEADMALE:We never did nothing like that at wellman.
SUPFEMALE:Did vonda tell you what kind of job you're interviewing for? Well, all i know is i'll have my own chair.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Do this.
LEADMALE:Shake your head.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Now do this.
SUPMALE:I hope the interview ain't this hard.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're going to wow 'em, sis.
SUPMALE:Oh, they're not going to hire me.
SUPFEMALE:They're gonna hire some little chickee with a tight skirt and a loose everything else.
LEADMALE:Stop.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna be selling magazines 'til they put me in my grave.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be cremated with back issues of field and stream.
SUPMALE:You want to get cremated, too? i don't know! Do we have to talk about it now? can i just get a minute? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you're making too big of a deal out of it.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a job.
OTHERMALE:You know, when i go on an interview, i don't get dressed up on purpose.
LEADFEMALE:It just makes you more nervous, then you start to sweat then you start worrying that you're sweating too much, so you sit there real stiff 'cause you're afraid if you lift your arms, you'll have these great big pit stains.
LEADFEMALE:And then you get that acid feeling in your stomach, like if you open your mouth to talk, you're gonna belch.
LEADFEMALE:Whenever i go on an interview, i just go as me.
LEADMALE:Well, that's why you work in a bar.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie! Jackie, you're blocking me.
SUPFEMALE:In what sense? In a plymouth sense.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll meet you out front.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing home? Oh, we poured that driveway, knocked off early.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, i got that old oaks job.
OTHERMALE:I subcontracted it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's great, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Well, wish me luck.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
SUPFEMALE:Where you going? what? what?! How can you live with me and not know where i'm going? now, didn't we lay in bed for two hours last night talking about how important this was? And now you're saying, "where are you going?" forgive me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm the worst husband who ever lived.
SUPMALE:Well, enough about you.
LEADFEMALE:Now, how do i look? You look fine.
LEADMALE:Could you maybe be a little bit more specific, dan? I mean, this is really important.
OTHERMALE:You look extremely fine.
LEADFEMALE:Would you hire me in this? If i wasn't married, i'd hire you in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:So i look cheap, right? Hell, no.
LEADMALE:I'm talking top dollar.
SUPMALE:One second! aah! don't flatten it! it took me and jackie an hour to get it like this! Roseanne, will you relax? Everything's gonna be fine.
LEADMALE:And even if things don't turn out, remember, you're still a 50-50 partner at four aces construction, and i have a feeling some of them dividends are about to pay off.
LEADFEMALE:Knock it off.
LEADMALE:I gotta go.
OTHERMALE:In that outfit? It's ok.
LEADMALE:It's a joke.
LEADFEMALE:What if they give me a typing test? You know how to type.
SUPFEMALE:But i'm really slow.
SUPFEMALE:How tough could it be? They're short words.
OTHERMALE:Steak, meat, prime, chuck.
LEADFEMALE:Porterhouse.
LEADMALE:That'd be cruel.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, what are you doing? I'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to your hair? It looks a lot better.
SUPFEMALE:Do you care if i just drive myself? No, how ever you're comfortable.
SUPFEMALE:Watch my front door.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Knock 'em dead, my little london broil.
OTHERMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm muriel johnson.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit there, please.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry it's so stuffy in here.
SUPFEMALE:They turn off the air conditioning on the weekend.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm not.
LEADMALE:I had other things to do today.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, why don't you just hire me, and we'll skip the interview.
SUPFEMALE:Ha ha ha.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, uh if you want my opinion, you're here for a position that doesn't even need to be filled.
LEADMALE:Well, great.
SUPFEMALE:Then the pressure's off.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no pressure.
SUPFEMALE:I like you already.
OTHERFEMALE:You drove down an alley that's forbidden to cars, and you parked in the fire lane.
SUPFEMALE:The point is, you got here on time.
LEADFEMALE:You know how to get things done.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm glad i impressed you.
SUPFEMALE:Look, are they gonna be needing somebody? Oh, not theyme.
SUPFEMALE:They're off playing golf or doing whatever, but i'm here as usual, running their show.
LEADFEMALE:Well, can i just ask you what position they need you to hire someone to fill? Secretary to mr.
SUPMALE:Ivan pitvoris.
LEADMALE:The man doesn't even need a secretary.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't do anything.
SUPMALE:Sounds like a great job.
SUPFEMALE:You ever think you might be working for a man named pitvoris? Well, i hate to tell you the name i had for my last boss.
LEADFEMALE:Being as you're unemployed, i imagine it was pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i quit that job.
LEADFEMALE:I've never been fired from anything in my life.
SUPMALE:Phil green seems to think the world of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Phil's great.
LEADFEMALE:Phil's lucky.
SUPFEMALE:If it weren't for me, that man would still be on the loading dock.
OTHERMALE:Well, he sure loves working here.
LEADMALE:I mean, he goes on and on about what a great place this is to work, really.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me tell you something about phil green.
OTHERMALE:He's smoother than a newborn baby's butt.
SUPMALE:And that wife of his.
SUPFEMALE:She's so perky, i'd like to drive a nail through her head.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i see why you're in personnel.
LEADMALE:Did i offend you? Well, vonda's my friend.
LEADMALE:I didn't say i didn't like her.
LEADMALE:Oh, i must have taken that nail through the head thing the wrong way.
LEADMALE:You've got quite an attitude.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i guess i do.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:I like attitudes.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:What for? I mean i'm here interviewing for a job that doesn't exist, and i get recommended by somebody you hate.
LEADMALE:Obviously, you're not gonna hire me.
LEADFEMALE:That's why you're not in personnel.
LEADFEMALE:You can't read people.
LEADMALE:Well, i can read you, and you're nuts.
LEADMALE:And you're a lousy interview.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but i'm a hell of a worker.
LEADMALE:That's why i'm hiring you.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? You heard me.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Really.
LEADMALE:Can you start monday? Muriel i love you.
SUPFEMALE:Can i use your phone? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Help yourself.
SUPMALE:I'll go get your paperwork.
LEADFEMALE:You got it? for sure? Aw, babe, that's fantastic.
OTHERMALE:No, no, take your time.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, baby.
LEADMALE:I love you, too.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie? yeah? what's going on? Roseanne got the job.
OTHERMALE:She got the job! she got the job! What's going on? Your mom got the job.
LEADFEMALE:What job? The job at where she went for the interview.
LEADMALE:The personnel director is showing her around now.
SUPFEMALE:You know what would make you mom really happy when she he gets back? A temple in her honor.
LEADFEMALE:Besides--besides that.
OTHERFEMALE:This place is a mess, right? Bingo.
LEADMALE:I'll get darlene.
LEADMALE:Is roseanne excited? Not half as excited as i am.
SUPFEMALE:But she really needed this job.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're telling me.
LEADFEMALE:We gotta celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:Definitely.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get crystal on the phone.
LEADFEMALE:I'll let her know what's going on.
SUPMALE:We got 30 minutes to get this house presentable.
SUPMALE:Rub a lamp.
SUPFEMALE:Your mom got that job.
LEADFEMALE:Awesome! Does that mean she not gonna be annoying people on the phone anymore for a living? Her telephone sales days are over.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. : yay! Now let's get to it.
SUPFEMALE:And remember, we're just looking for the illusion of clean.
LEADMALE:I should get vonda on the phone, too.
LEADMALE:And i'll call sylvia.
LEADMALE:We'll get a whole party together.
LEADMALE:I should go to the store.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think dried lentils will cut it.
LEADMALE:Crystal? Hi, it's jackie.
LEADMALE:Are you sitting down? No, no, crystal, don't go get a chair.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, i need you to fill out these 3 forms.
LEADFEMALE:You can take the yellow booklet home with you.
SUPMALE:It explains your health benefits, insurance, and all that other good stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, muriel.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you might want to come in a little early on monday, just to familiarize yourself with the computer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, a microwave with its own organ.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:We use the tangerine 3.
LEADFEMALE:It can do anything.
LEADMALE:Well, good.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it can teach me how to use a computer.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean, you never worked on a computer at wellman? I worked on my feet at wellman.
LEADFEMALE:But i can learn.
LEADMALE:Not in one day you can't.
LEADFEMALE:I'll come in early and i'll stay really late.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, everything we do here is on a computer.
LEADFEMALE:I need somebody to start on monday.
LEADMALE:I mean, our whole inventory is computerized.
LEADFEMALE:Our sales, our shipping.
LEADMALE:Damn, and i sent everybody home.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I suppose severance pay is out of the question.
LEADMALE:Here she comes.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! oh! We should all hide and jump out and yell, "surprise!" i've always wanted to do that.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie: go for it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm not gonna be the only one.
LEADMALE:Hey, vonda and phil, will you do it, too? Sure, we'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:How about everyone else? dan? dan? You have my word.
LEADMALE:You think we should have a signal? how about, uh, when she opens the door? Perfect.
LEADMALE:What's taking her so long? She can't get your car door closed.
LEADMALE:Now she's got it.
SUPFEMALE:Now she's kicking hell out of your car.
LEADFEMALE:What?! oh! Here she comes.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody get ready.
LEADMALE:Darlene! darlene! turn off the tv! get the lights! go! no, dan! Vonda, you and phil are doing it with me, right?.
LEADFEMALE:Shh! surprise! Hi, crystal.
SUPFEMALE:Hip hip! hooray! hooray! hip hip! hooray! hooray! hip hip! hooray! hooray! congratulations, babe! Oh, we got to talk.
LEADFEMALE:In honor of your new job, your telephone magazine sales book.
SUPFEMALE:I wish you hadn't done that, dan.
SUPMALE:Ha ha! Nice going, sis.
SUPFEMALE:All: rosie! rosie! rosie! rosie! rosie! I hope i never get old.
LEADFEMALE:You already are.
LEADFEMALE:All: rosie! rosie! Ok, ok, ok.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna make a speech.
SUPMALE:This ought to be good.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, i just wanna say that if it hadn't been for you, i wouldn't have never quit wellman.
LEADMALE:But now me and emilio, we have our own little business, and we're all doing great.
SUPFEMALE:And we owe it all to you.
LEADFEMALE:I only wish there was a way for us to thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe putting me on the payroll might be a nice gesture.
SUPMALE:Juanita, he's doing it again.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, you're a real hero.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't get the job.
OTHERFEMALE:What? You heard me.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, you didn't get the job? roseanne, you want a beer? Not now, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:I mean i didn't get the job.
LEADMALE:You ought to be used to hearing that by now.
LEADMALE:So, you want me to get the barbecue started, put on hamburgers, hot dogs? No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Is something wrong? I didn't get the job.
OTHERMALE:What happened? Oh, i don't want to talk about it right now.
OTHERMALE:Phil, i'd just like to thank you for putting in a good word.
LEADMALE:Too bad i'll be in the warehouse.
LEADMALE:I won't be able to see that much of you.
LEADMALE:Did muriel say when your lunch hour is? Oh, i think it's pretty flexible.
LEADMALE:You know, if it hadn't been for phil putting in a good word with mr.
SUPFEMALE:Garvin, muriel would still be on the loading dock where she belongs.
OTHERMALE:Oh, not now, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:So you didn't get this job.
SUPMALE:The right job will come along.
OTHERMALE:This was the right job.
LEADMALE:Well, then you'll get another job.
LEADFEMALE:No, i wanted this job.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you being out of work right now is not that big a deal.
SUPMALE:Mom, do we have any more chips? They're in the cupboard.
SUPFEMALE:Which cupboard? The one with the chips.
LEADMALE:Look, my being out of work right now is a big deal, dan.
LEADMALE:Because i've been out of work for 4 months.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you got a minute? You know, i read your horoscope today-not now, crystal.
LEADMALE:Joe, you remember rosie.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:How you doing, rosie? Hi, joe.
LEADMALE:Where's the cake? I'll go check.
LEADMALE:So tell me, how old are you today, rosie? Joe, i'm 35 today.
LEADMALE:Ah i'm sorry we didn't bring a gift.
SUPFEMALE:That's ok, joe.
SUPMALE:I appreciate you coming.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne you want me to get rid of all these people? I could do that.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i just heard.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if it wasn't for you, i would-hold on there, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:But i wouldn't be my own boss with my own hours, and the satisfaction that comes from making my customers feel more beautiful and confident with their cindy-lou cosmetics.
LEADMALE:And i owe it all to you, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Well, you've made me feel very uncomfortable, crystal, and i thank you.
SUPMALE:Oh! Are you going to be ok? I think so.
SUPFEMALE:But i just don't understand what is wrong with you, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Why won't anyone hire you? Don't try to cheer me up, crystal.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, we got to go, but i just want to thank you one more time for getting all of us out of that hellhole.
SUPMALE:Quitting wellman was the best thing you ever did.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, vonda.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan: bye, vonda.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulating me, telling me quitting my job was the best thing i ever did.
OTHERFEMALE:It was the stupidest thing i ever did.
SUPFEMALE:How could i do that? how could i quit my job? I've got 3 kids.
LEADFEMALE:And some guy gives me a little lip, and i tossed it all.
LEADMALE:I tossed my paycheck, my benefits.
LEADFEMALE:I tossed my pension.
LEADFEMALE:I let him beat me.
LEADMALE:He didn't beat you.
SUPMALE:He did beat me, dan, and you know why? Because he has a job and you've got a job, and jackie's got a job, vonda's got a job, and hell, even crystal has a job.
SUPFEMALE:What do i got? I got zip! It's ok, baby.
OTHERMALE:Leave it open.
LEADMALE:That's it, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Just go ahead and make a joke.
SUPFEMALE:"roseanne can't find a job.
SUPFEMALE:Ha ha ha!" what do you want me to say? why don't you tell me what to do again, dan? I didn't tell you to quit your job.
LEADMALE:The hell you didn't.
LEADFEMALE:The hell i did! I told you if you wanted to quit your job, you should go ahead and quit your job.
LEADMALE:I was trying to support you.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha.
LEADFEMALE:You told me to quit my job, and now you resent me because i did! Bull.
LEADFEMALE:Bull.
SUPFEMALE:Bull.
SUPMALE:You're all the time picking at me and making little cracks! we always make little cracks! We always make little jokes.
LEADMALE:That's how we are.
SUPMALE:That's why we get along so well! Oh, well, it's just so easy for you to make jokes when i'm the one that's out of work and everything's going great for you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not mad at you for quitting your job.
SUPFEMALE:You're mad at you for quitting your job.
SUPMALE:I'm mad at me for quitting my job? and you're taking it out on me because you think your family let you down, and i'm sick of it! so i quit! and you think i'm mad because i quit?! Yeah, i'm mad that i quit-and where did everybody go? I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I did let my family down, and you know it and i know it.
SUPMALE:That hurts.
LEADMALE:It hurts real bad, dan.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What? Get a job.
LEADFEMALE:Where's my history book? It's underneath the king's newspaper.
OTHERMALE:Darlene, get it down here! Bye, mom.
LEADMALE:Bye, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i got one more pancake.
SUPFEMALE:I want french toast.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you'd better move to europe.
LEADMALE:What about your breakfast? I'll eat it on the bus.
LEADMALE:I'm gone.
SUPFEMALE:I'll talk to you later, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you forgot something.
SUPMALE:I meant your lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Bye, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPFEMALE:This is roseanne from the magazine discount house, and since you're a preferred customer
OTHERFEMALE:

LEADMALE:No, at the table! This ok? Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Burt, why are you like this? you mean obnoxious? Not just the obnoxious thing, but the relentless needy thing, too.
LEADFEMALE:Most people are too proud to admit that they're needy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i tell you this with every bit of honesty in my being.
LEADMALE:I have no pride.
LEADMALE:And i believe that, burt.
LEADMALE:I guess people just can't handle that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me ask you something.
LEADMALE:How did you get this far in life without somebody just driving a big ol' stake through your head? Well, go figure.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, have you ever gone to a shrink, or anything like that? Oh, yeah, believe me, i used to be really messed up.
SUPFEMALE:Well, do you want us to hate you? No, i want to be loved just as much as everyone else.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just lousy at doing whatever it is people do to get loved.
SUPFEMALE:To tell you the truth, in my whole life i've never really had one real friend.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, now! Stay.
LEADFEMALE:Is that any way to talk to a guest? He offered to get becky a mastercard.
LEADMALE:He's got to go.
LEADMALE:No, he doesn't, dan.
OTHERMALE:What? what? He's a human being.
LEADMALE:You got proof of that? And he has needs.
OTHERFEMALE:Needs? needs? he needs to get our kids credit? what kind of man is this? Just calm down.
LEADFEMALE:I'm making some headway.
LEADFEMALE:I think i can have him out of here by february.
LEADMALE:He's out of here tonight.
SUPFEMALE:He's out now.
OTHERMALE:What did he do that was so wrong? He gave you a job, and he gave me a job.
LEADMALE:He tried to give us a refrigerator, and the only thing he wants from us is a little bit of love and affection, which happens to be the only thing we can afford to give.
LEADFEMALE:You know, dan, we are children of the sixties, and we're supposed to love everybody, remember? Just do it for me.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead and hate your neighbor go ahead and cheat a friend burt, you want some coffee? to go, right? No, to stay.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i'd love to.
SUPMALE:We're taking the kids to the movies later.
LEADMALE:You're welcome to join us.
LEADFEMALE:But? No buts.
SUPFEMALE:One but.
LEADMALE:If you're our guest, that means you got to be our guest.
LEADMALE:That means no buying us dinner, no buying us major household appliances, and no establishing credit cards for the kids.
OTHERMALE:You guys are terrific.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i've never met anyone quite like you before.
SUPMALE:We never met nobody like you neither, burt.
LEADMALE:I mean, i've invaded your privacy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm ruining your weekend.
SUPFEMALE:I've alienated your kids.
SUPFEMALE:And just think, you hardly know us.

SUPMALE:I want to thank you in the only way i can see fit.
SUPMALE:I'm leaving.
OTHERFEMALE:Burt don't--don't toy with us.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you've renewed my faith in humanity.
LEADMALE:As you might guess, i'm pretty bad at goodbyes.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you at work.
OTHERMALE:I can't do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's ok, burt.
LEADMALE:At least you tried.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, darlene, come on.

SUPFEMALE:Oh! eureka! Honey, how late's that video store open? No, dan.
LEADMALE:Wait, now.
SUPMALE:I have to show you.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the timer is preset, so you just put the tape in there, you push that thing there, and that will record my soaps.
LEADMALE:I think i can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to record my soaps? No problem.
LEADFEMALE:'cause a lot of critical stuff could happen while i'm away at police training school.
LEADMALE:Soap operas.
LEADMALE:All them people do is get pregnant and die.
LEADMALE:That's 'cause it's based on real life.
LEADFEMALE:Which is why i never watch 'em.

LEADFEMALE:You guys be home by 8:00.
SUPMALE:All right, 11:00.
SUPMALE:Davy davy crockett king of the wild frontier who are you calling? It's after 11:00.
LEADMALE:Why do you think i'm calling somebody for? You got a phone in your hand.
OTHERFEMALE:No, i don't.
LEADFEMALE:You were calling jackie, weren't you? Oh, thanks for reminding me.
LEADMALE:Aww.
LEADMALE:She's probably out running around celebrating her last night out before boot camp.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, we gotta drive her to the bus at 9:00 tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:She's going to have a hell of a time getting up.
SUPMALE:Knowing jackie, she's not even packed yet.
LEADMALE:Why don't you go pack for her? Uh-uh.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not going no place till becky and darlene get home.
LEADMALE:And how about the trouble in johannesburg? why don't you go and try to straighten out the south african government while you're at it? Well, i would if you would've fixed those nuclear warheads like i told you to.
LEADMALE:They're ba-ack hurry up.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Get in here.
SUPMALE:Mom? did you guys have fun? It was ok.
LEADFEMALE:Becky spent the whole night sucking face with some guy.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:I guess darlene didn't get any.
LEADFEMALE:Here's your stinky vest, hot lips.
SUPFEMALE:What is your problem? My stomach.
LEADFEMALE:I'm nauseated.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't even know why i took you to that party anyways.
LEADMALE:You're still just a little kid.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, i'm not the one who had jimmy meltreiger in a lip-lock for 2 1/2 hours.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, what i do is my own business.
SUPMALE:How about what you do in front of 27 other people? It was practically dark, and everyone else was making out.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody cares anyway, darlene, so just grow up.
LEADMALE:Everybody was staring at you guys.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You were staring at us.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you were kissing him all night.
LEADMALE:He was kissing me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, most of the time.
LEADFEMALE:The rest of the time, i was kissing him.
SUPFEMALE:You looked like those people in national enquirer who are joined at the head.
OTHERMALE:Darlene, you can't just sit there and be kissed.
OTHERMALE:You gotta kiss back.
LEADFEMALE:Or you can be the one doing the kissing, but boys don't like that.
LEADFEMALE:How come? I don't know, it's like they think it's their job or something.
LEADMALE:Well, how do you know when to breathe? You can breathe whenever you feel like it.
OTHERFEMALE:So, basically, you just do this no, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:You kind of then you open your mouth a little bit.
OTHERMALE:You open your mouth?! for what?! So you can slip him the tongue.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gagging! Hi, mom.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:I heard you went into thermonuclear meltdown with some guy.
LEADMALE:It wasn't just some guy.
LEADMALE:It wasn't no, it was jimmy.
LEADFEMALE:You actually touched tongues?! Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Bet you can't wait for high school now, huh? If any guy puts his tongue in my mouth, i'll barf.
OTHERMALE:Great way to get a second date.
LEADFEMALE:Come here and sit down.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Here comes the talk.
SUPFEMALE:Well, kissing guys ain't all that bad.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, it's kind of fun.
LEADMALE:Isn't it, becky? Mother.
SUPMALE:Just so long as it's what you want to do and you're not doing it to act cool or nothing like that.
LEADFEMALE:When you first went out with daddy, did you want to kiss him all the time? Well, somebody had to do it.
SUPMALE:And you know me.
LEADFEMALE:Work, work, work.
LEADMALE:When did you know that you wanted to spend the rest of your life with him? Oh, well, i ain't decided that yet.
LEADFEMALE:We're just gonna raise you kids, you know, and then, if we still like kissing each other, then we'll decide.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i kissed mark winstead once, and i didn't have to open my mouth.
LEADFEMALE:You kissed a guy, and you didn't tell me? We beat the pirates 14-zip.
LEADMALE:He saved my shut-out, so i kissed him.
LEADMALE:Well, that's how it starts, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Before you know it, you're on love's old emotional roller coaster.
SUPMALE:But all that's still a while off for you yet.
SUPFEMALE:I hope.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be too sure, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Warren marshall asked for darlene's phone number.
SUPFEMALE:'night, mom.
LEADFEMALE:'night, kiddo.
LEADFEMALE:'night, beck.
SUPFEMALE:'night, dar.
OTHERFEMALE:Keep your mouth closed.
LEADMALE:Warren marshall.
LEADMALE:Which one's he? He's the one we call mandingo.
OTHERMALE:Hi, sis.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Boy, you're actually ready to go.
SUPMALE:Hey, look what i brought you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, but you know what i did last night? I'd only be guessing.
SUPFEMALE:I went over to rodbell's, and i bought myself this.
LEADFEMALE:But i thought you loved this bag.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i do, but that's yours.
SUPFEMALE:This is pretty nice, huh? 29.
LEADFEMALE:95 on sale.
LEADFEMALE:It's got a 2-year guarantee against all kinds of stuff.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess you're ready to go.
SUPFEMALE:Ready, willing, and able.
LEADFEMALE:I got my room assignment.
SUPMALE:Well, where are they putting you up? Barracks 21.
OTHERFEMALE:Sounds plush.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna get there early 'cause i wanna get an upper bunk.
LEADMALE:Yeah, upper bunks are the best.
SUPMALE:Oh, definitely.
SUPMALE:You remember camp wild oak? Oh, god, wild oak.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie: that girl lucy emerson.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, lucy emerson.
SUPMALE:You told lucy emerson that there were poison-secreting spiders on the ceiling that could make her go bald so that you could get an upper bunk.
OTHERMALE:How do you remember that stuff? Then you got us out of rowing because you told them that our father had been killed in a naval battle.
LEADMALE:That was the night we snuck over to the boys' camp.
SUPFEMALE:Sis, you gonna sneak over to the barracks and visit me at the academy? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess we better get going, then.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Sis are you ok? Not really.
LEADFEMALE:It's only gonna be for 6 weeks.
LEADFEMALE:Plus 3 days of orientation.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be back before you know it.
LEADMALE:Well, are you gonna take your stamps with ya? what for? So you can write me.
SUPFEMALE:No, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna be in training.
SUPMALE:I'll probably be too tired to lift a pen.
OTHERFEMALE:But you could write me.
OTHERMALE:You write great letters.
SUPMALE:You probably already written one, huh? Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Well, don't read it now.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Ohh.
OTHERFEMALE:It's so sweet.
LEADMALE:Well, i wanted to say something, you know.
LEADFEMALE:You're leaving, darlene's leaving.
SUPFEMALE:Where's darlene going? Well, she went to a party last night.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
SUPMALE:Well, she's grown up.
SUPMALE:Jackie you're my best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne, don't get sappy.
LEADMALE:Well, i wanna get sappy, and i want you to let me get sappy.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, sap away.
LEADMALE:You're going away forever.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be back before you know it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you're gonna be different.
LEADFEMALE:But maybe i'll be better.
LEADMALE:But i like you the way you are now.
OTHERMALE:Even though you don't have any rugs.
LEADMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADMALE:Let's get going, or you'll miss your bus.
LEADMALE:My truck's out parked in the front.
SUPFEMALE:Some stupid cop probably gave me a parking ticket.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
SUPMALE:I can get the bags if you'll grab this stuff.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i'm just gonna check your stove.
SUPFEMALE:It's off.
LEADMALE:I never cook.
LEADFEMALE:Remember? Oh look at this place.
LEADMALE:Oh, well.
SUPMALE:She's a big girl now.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye, mom! bye, mom! Where are you guys going? To the mall.
LEADFEMALE:What for? The usual.
SUPMALE:Well, when will you be back? When we're out of money.
SUPFEMALE:Want me to run you down there? No, we'll take the bus.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, i'm going over to joey's! what for? To play! Roseanne: oh, ok.
SUPFEMALE:Be home for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I will.
SUPFEMALE:You need anything from budget club? No.
OTHERMALE:See you later.
SUPFEMALE:What's the matter? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Just go.
SUPFEMALE:What? Nothing is wrong, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Just go.
OTHERMALE:Is this how you're going to be till jackie comes marching home? This doesn't have anything to do with jackie.
LEADMALE:The hell it doesn't.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's too bad.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's too bad.
SUPFEMALE:It is too bad, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:It's too bad you can't accept the fact that people have to live their own lives.
SUPMALE:Just because a bird leaves the nest doesn't mean it's going to get creamed by the concorde.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for putting that into perspective.
LEADMALE:Honey, 6 weeks isn't that long of a time.
OTHERFEMALE:It's almost my god, you've done the math.
SUPFEMALE:She's my little sister.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, your little sister's all grown up now.
LEADFEMALE:I know, everybody's growing up and leaving me.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, did you say everybody? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie's off to become a policewoman, darlene's practically dating, and becky's going to be married at this rate.
SUPMALE:And d.j. 's getting his grown-up teeth.
OTHERMALE:Hey, this doesn't have anything to do with jackie or darlene or becky or d.j. this has to do with roseanne.
LEADMALE:You're afraid you're gonna be left alone.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i am.
OTHERFEMALE:What about me? I'm the guy that's been standing in line all these years waiting to get you by myself.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you think that boat i'm building in the garage only sleeps two? Because the garage is too small.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Cheer up.
LEADMALE:I'm here, and i'll be here forever.
OTHERMALE:Gee, dan, are you trying to make me feel worse? and ever and ever and ever! What are you doing? Come on.
LEADMALE:You got me, and baby i got you oh, dan, don't.

LEADFEMALE:"dear sis, i hope you survived "your first week of training "and that life in the barracks "is at the very least co-ed.
LEADFEMALE:"things on the home front are as thrilling as ever.
LEADMALE:"i told mom you've been working real late "and that's why you haven't called her.
LEADMALE:"you're going to have to tell her, "hopefully when i'm not there.
SUPFEMALE:"your place is fine, "i've got your mail, "and i borrowed your lillian vernon catalogue.
OTHERMALE:"your plant is still alivepretty much "and will probably make it till you get back.

OTHERFEMALE:God, i despise teen-agers.
LEADFEMALE:Mom? what? Good.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha! Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:You ok? I'm going to kill my boss.
SUPMALE:Gosh, he was so nasty to me today, like it's my fault he can't get into northwestern.
SUPFEMALE:I know what just might make you feel better.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too, but i bet it's a different list than what you got.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you stack them sandwiches on a plate for me? I gotta go to handy j and get chips and sody and all kinds of stuff.
SUPMALE:What sandwiches? I see flat meat and i see bread, but i don't see no sandwiches.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boing! Did you want me to make them become sandwiches? oh, could you? are you kidding? I've been standing behind a counter preparing food for people all day, and right now there's nothing more i'd rather do than make sandwiches for you, dan.
LEADMALE:Why, then, we're both in heaven.
SUPMALE:You know what the beauty part is? Once the guys get here, you'll never have to set foot in this kitchen again tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Why, are you banning me? Correct.
LEADMALE:Then i'm going to miss out on all that fascinating conversation you have during these card games.
SUPFEMALE:Like, "will the cubs make the super bowl," or "should i use snow tires or chains?" mom, want me to read to you? frog and toad? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hit it.
SUPFEMALE:"i will go to toad's house, "said frog.
OTHERMALE:"i will rake all of the leaves "that have fallen on his lawn.
LEADFEMALE:Toad will be s-su-u-su-u" i'll take care of this.
LEADFEMALE:"su-u-su-u-surprised.
LEADMALE:" there.
LEADMALE:Don't tell your father.
SUPFEMALE:"toad looked out of his window.
LEADFEMALE:"these messy leaves have covered everything, said toad.
SUPFEMALE:" oh, let me! i'm coming! Oh, hi, arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, rosie.
LEADMALE:Where's the man of the house? He's in the kitchen reading.
LEADMALE:Oh, snazzy shirt.
LEADMALE:You want it? why, you going to give it to me? No, cut it out.
SUPFEMALE:If you want it, i want you to have it.
LEADFEMALE:Keep your shirt on.
SUPFEMALE:You just missed out on your golden opportunity.
SUPMALE:Hey, deej.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Buddy.
LEADFEMALE:You got to move, honey, we're setting up the table.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, i'll go read to my teen-age mutant ninja turtles.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Rosie, let me ask you something.
LEADFEMALE:Be honest with me, because-well, you're always honest with me, but most women are not always honest.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean like most men? I think men are honest.
LEADMALE:That's a lie.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, it's a lie, but most women aren't that honest either.
LEADMALE:Yeah, they are.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, they are.
LEADFEMALE:But hypothetical situation-a guy and gal are living together for let's say 19 months, sharing expenses on everything, including storage for a boat they use 5 weeks out of the year.
LEADFEMALE:Sharon's pushing you to marry her.
OTHERFEMALE:And sell the boat.
SUPMALE:Well, do you love her? do i love her? Be serious.
SUPMALE:No jokes.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i--i love her.
LEADMALE:I love her.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Then don't marry her.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? Because, you marry her, you'll be happy, and you obviously don't want to be happy, or you would have married her by now.
LEADMALE:I'm still unclear about this boat thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you treat sharon like you treat your boat.
SUPFEMALE:You love your boat, right? You want to be with your boat.
SUPFEMALE:You want to keep your boat forever and ever.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but someday i'd like to get a bigger one.
LEADMALE:Just stay with me on this, ok? So maybe your boat needs some security.
SUPFEMALE:It needs a dock to come home to at night.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe it needs a little rope around its cleat so it doesn't just drift away.
LEADMALE:So what are you saying, we should split the mooring fees? I'm saying if you don't take care of your boat, it's going to drift away, and you're gonna lose it forever.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I'm always right.
SUPMALE:How did dan get to be so lucky? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne you are really a wonderful woman.
LEADMALE:Buddy! good old arnie! What's going on? roseanne, how you doing? All right.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to talk to officer jackie harris.
SUPMALE:This is her sister, and it's an emergency.
LEADMALE:I'm a dentist.
LEADMALE:You wanna know why your head hurts, it's because your jaw's out of alignment.
LEADMALE:Next time you put a finger in my mouth, i'm gonna bite it off.
LEADMALE:Conner, is nuss playing? No.
LEADMALE:Rosie won't let him in the house.
LEADFEMALE:I know some women who won't let him in north america.
LEADFEMALE:Let's play some cards.
LEADMALE:What? with 4? I'd win back my ante.
SUPFEMALE:Since when do you win? since when does he ante? Please.
SUPMALE:You can't play with 4.

SUPFEMALE:Rosie won't let him in the house.
SUPMALE:That's a good choice.
SUPFEMALE:What's the buy-in? I guess andy's gonna be an hour late as usual.
LEADMALE:I think that guy's still on new york time.
LEADFEMALE:"hey, what'd you guys do, start early? "we always start at 7:30.
LEADMALE:Danny, am i right? "hey, which one of you hot dogs wants to cash a check for me?" that's perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd rather have andy than nuss.
LEADMALE:Nuss cheats.
LEADFEMALE:At least he admits it.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Are these sandwiches? Yeah, they've been sneezed on, but help yourself.
LEADMALE:Pass.
SUPMALE:You see anything, diane? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:What's that huge, disgusting brown thing? A meat loaf.

LEADMALE:Pbbbt! hey-ho! You guys started already? Post-time was 7:00.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, dan.

SUPFEMALE:Arnie, are you here to play poker or walk laps? Hey, you're right.
SUPMALE:I'll go flirt with rosie.

LEADMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:"all waved me goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:"they jumped into my cars and drove away "under the smoke-smuggered stars.
LEADMALE:"now all that was left " 'neath the bad-smelling sky, "was my big empty factory, the lorax, and i.
LEADFEMALE:" good.
LEADFEMALE:That's what he gets.
LEADMALE:You know what you're going to get? what? A great big smooch.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you mean, "no"? i can't kiss you? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to kiss you.
LEADFEMALE:I want to kiss you like daddy kisses you.

SUPFEMALE:What's going on? what do you think of those guys in there playin' poker with dan? which guys? You don't even let me get a chance to look at them.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPFEMALE:You know that guy arnie out there playing poker? arnie? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:What do you think of him? you think he's an ok guy? I don't know him.
SUPFEMALE:He works for the water and power company.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Dan's known him for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne! You're not fixing me up with arnie.
SUPMALE:He's not my type.
LEADFEMALE:Why? don't you think he's cute? Oh, i don't know.
LEADMALE:I think he's um, sweaty.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean you think "he's sweaty"? He's sweaty.
OTHERMALE:All men are sweaty.
LEADMALE:Well, i think some men are sweatier than other men.
SUPMALE:Maybe that's because he's a hard worker.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a second.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't he practically living with somebody? Yeah.
SUPMALE:He is living with somebody.
LEADFEMALE:And i think they're gonna get married, too, which is what makes what happened just all the more weirder.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, what? Tell me.
LEADMALE:I can't ya, jackie! tell me! I can't because you've got a great big mouth, and i really need to be discreet.
LEADMALE:Roseanne! He kissed me.
LEADMALE:Now, don't you think that that is just a little a little pushy? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Ace! Yeah, because he's dan's friend.
SUPFEMALE:We were hanging out because dan went to the store.
LEADMALE:We were just talking.
SUPMALE:We started talking about women.
OTHERMALE:He started talking about his girlfriend and how he doesn't know anything about women, and before i know it, he's kissing me.
LEADMALE:Wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:Was he kissing you like kissing you, or was it just like a kiss? Well, he's kissing me.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Well, no.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:It was just-it was just a kiss, but it was on my neck, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Where exactly on the neck? just below the ear, did he brush your cheek, or did he move the hair and then give it to you? No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:No hair.
LEADMALE:It was kind of like-ok, stand up.
LEADFEMALE:Now put your arms around me.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:Ok--you be me.
SUPMALE:You're over there.
SUPMALE:What did you do? I just stood there.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't believe he did that.
OTHERMALE:I don't know what he did! I'm trying to tell you.
LEADMALE:So we're just standing here, and we're talking, ok? So let's just be talking.
LEADMALE:So how you doing? how you been? Nice shirt.
LEADMALE:Oh, see? I didn't even tell you about that part.
LEADMALE:Oh, that is eerie.
SUPMALE:Ohthat is eerie.
LEADMALE:That's what i said to him when he came in the door.
LEADMALE:What? I go, "hi, arnie, i like your shirt.
LEADFEMALE:" well, that explains it.
LEADMALE:You led him on.
LEADMALE:No! Come on, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:So i go, "nice shirt.
LEADMALE:" he starts taking it off, you know, like he's going to give it to me.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:How long has dan known this guy? he comes over and starts taking his shirt off? That's a little strange.
SUPMALE:I told you! Let me show you the rest.
LEADFEMALE:I'm standing here.
LEADMALE:I'm talking.
SUPMALE:I'm you.
LEADFEMALE:So i'm like, "now let me ask you something.
LEADMALE:" i'm being him.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Let me ask you something.
LEADMALE:Then we started talking about women.
LEADFEMALE:I said something sensitive and meaningful, like how you gotta treat them like goddesses, like the way that dan treats me.
LEADFEMALE:So, you're lying to him.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:So i'm standing here making sandwiches.
OTHERFEMALE:So just make sandwiches.
LEADMALE:Now you're making sandwiches.
LEADMALE:I go--well, i say something nice to him, blah, blah, blah.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Now you be me.
SUPFEMALE:You say, "well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:" thank you, arnie.
OTHERFEMALE:"roseanne--" he comes up-"you're the most incredible woman "i've ever met in my life, and i mean that.
LEADMALE:" oh, you're kidding.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Everybody, ante up.
LEADMALE:Dealer's choice.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:What's the game? Bust your buddy, there'll be a 50 cent buy at the end, and the 7 of diamonds is wild.
SUPFEMALE:What, are we in college? Never went to college.
SUPMALE:Well, i did, and we didn't play crap like this.
LEADMALE:What's the difference? You're going to bluff anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, tommy, who smashed the back of your buick? Skidded into a lamppost last year.
SUPMALE:Thought i could get away with radials instead of snow tires.
SUPMALE:Not with the winters we got around here.
LEADMALE:You gotta have snow tires.
SUPFEMALE:I use chains.
SUPMALE:Chains make the car hum.
LEADMALE:And they tear up the road.
OTHERFEMALE:What do i care? I pay taxes.
SUPMALE:So, who didn't ante? what are you, my accountant? No, i'm not short enough.
LEADMALE:You think maybe should i have slapped him? No.
SUPMALE:I think slapping him would've been way too much.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think i ought to tell dan? I think it was just a kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i don't do the kind of volume that you do, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:This doesn't happen to me every day.
SUPMALE:Ok, don't tell dan.
SUPFEMALE:Dan will get mad and start yellin' at arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Arnie will get mad at dan, start yelling.
OTHERMALE:They'll both be yelling, waving their fists around and saying stupid macho things back and forth, and then he'll never kiss you again.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you think i should have said something to arnie? I mean, i'm married.
LEADMALE:I have 3 children.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what? You're right.
LEADMALE:I don't like when a guy thinks he can come up and handle you like a rubber thong in a discount bin.
LEADMALE:I hate it when a guy kisses me before i've given him that unwritten green light.
OTHERMALE:What's that all about? Well, you know, a smile, the look.
SUPFEMALE:You catch a guy's eye, hold it, and say yes.
SUPMALE:It's all done with the eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do you think i led him on? 'cause i was looking at him.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, were you looking at him like this, or were you looking at him like this? Well, i was kind of looking at him like this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's a mixed message.
LEADFEMALE:Who's he calling? Helen.
LEADFEMALE:Still busy.
SUPFEMALE:Unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure she's fine.
LEADFEMALE:When is she due? Monday.
SUPFEMALE:Mazel tov.
LEADFEMALE:What? It's like, um it's cool.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Cynthia stays on the phone like it's nothing.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, sharon, too.
SUPFEMALE:I think women have an extra vocal chord.
LEADFEMALE:Want to bet? I'm just sayin' they talk a lot.
OTHERMALE:They like to gossip.
OTHERMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:You want to bet? Oh, right.
SUPFEMALE:When i get home tonight, helen's gonna put down every one of you, including your wives.
SUPMALE:'cause she'll have been on the phone all night with cynthia, talking about you and you and especially you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yack, yack, yack, yack, yack! It's like a sport.
LEADFEMALE:Then they try to get us involved.
LEADMALE:Like last night cynthia's trying to tell me about bobby ericson and his wife.
LEADMALE:That was terrible.
LEADMALE:What about bobby? They're splitting up.
OTHERMALE:You didn't you know? where'd you hear that? I heard it from helen.
SUPFEMALE:Cynthia told her.
LEADFEMALE:They've been having trouble for a long time.
SUPMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Bobby and judy ericson? Judy asked me to start sending her bills to a different address.
SUPMALE:Think she's shacking up with some guy? Oh, she's a tramp.
SUPMALE:You don't even know her.
SUPFEMALE:What's the difference? I think she's running around.
LEADFEMALE:He's had on his track shoes for a while, too.
LEADMALE:I think it was a little equipment trouble.
SUPFEMALE:No way, man.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a second--bobby and i played football together.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Must have been a real close team.
SUPMALE:Bottom line-bobby's a slut.
SUPFEMALE:Let's face it, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Just because he runs around doesn't mean that she can run around, too.
OTHERMALE:You know, andy, that's a real enlightened view.
OTHERMALE:Sort of aduh.
OTHERFEMALE:See you later, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you do, george? Oh, i broke even.
OTHERMALE:Lost 20 bucks, ate 5 sandwiches.
SUPFEMALE:How'd you do, honey? Great.
LEADFEMALE:I won 18 bucks.
SUPFEMALE:Well, great! Another 10,000 nights like that and you're gonna have a great year.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm outta here.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for the sandwiches.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, arnie, need help with that green monster? No, i got it.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:See you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, tell sharon i said hi.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:What's he doing kissing jackie? Oh, dan, it was just a kiss.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess i really know men, huh? Well i can see how you might have mistook that.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It was just a kiss.
LEADFEMALE:So what else was i going to do tonight? I'll see you tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:I'll see you.
LEADFEMALE:Come and listen to my story about a man named jed.
LEADMALE:He's a poor mountaineer, he barely kept his family fed.
LEADFEMALE:Then one day, he was a-shootin' at some food when up through the ground come a-bubbling crude.
LEADMALE:Oil that is.
SUPFEMALE:B-b-b-b-black gold, black gold.
LEADFEMALE:Texas "t.
LEADMALE:" well, the first thing you know, old jed's a millionaire.
LEADFEMALE:His kinfolk said, "jed, move away from there.
SUPFEMALE:They say, "california is the place you ought to be.
SUPFEMALE:" so they loaded up a truck, and they moved to beverly.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, hills.
OTHERMALE:Hills that is.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Swimming pools, movie stars.
SUPMALE:K-e-double l o-double good-kellogg's best to you.
LEADMALE:Yo! oh, yeah! Captioned by the national you want to bet some time this year?
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:How's that caramel coming? Good enough to roll around in.
LEADMALE:Get away from there.
SUPMALE:You don't need the calories.
SUPFEMALE:Put a stick in it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, caramel apples! Hey, leave those alone.
OTHERMALE:You don't want to get fat like your aunt jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Halloween's not for two whole days.
LEADFEMALE:That's torture.
LEADMALE:You got something against torture? These are for the trick-or-treaters.
LEADFEMALE:What trick-or-treaters? No one even goes out anymore because the cheapos in this neighborhood turn out their lights and pretend they're not home.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know what we used to do to people who did that? We'd soap their windows.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Then we'd hide on the rooftops and bomb their cars with eggs.
SUPFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and then you get a dog, you take these brown paper bags, and you find a scooper-more coffee, officer? Mom, i got an owie.
SUPFEMALE:So? what do you want me to do about it? come on, mom! hey! What are you going to be for halloween, deej? Ninja warrior, master of death.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! Some warrior.
LEADFEMALE:What are you guys going out as? Ooh, maybe i'll be wonder woman.
LEADFEMALE:And i'll be casper the friendly ghost.
SUPMALE:I guess you two are just too mature for trick-or-treating.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, if i want candy, i'll go through your purse.
LEADMALE:I'm probably going to marci michaelson's party.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, remember mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Osmund? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She was scary.
SUPFEMALE:Who was she? She was this madwoman over on elmridge who looked like a vampire.
LEADMALE:She had this long, black, haggy hair, and some caped thing, and she used to jump out from her front porch and scare us half to death.
SUPMALE:Too bad she never did it on halloween.
SUPMALE:Hey, sis, didn't she wind up in jail for the criminally insane? Yeah, and i think that i read somewhere that she just got released.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i think i read that, too.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you think she'll come back to lanford? If she's truly insane, she will.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, they're just goofing on you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We're just goofing on you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going over to oak orchard now to pick up plans for the gralick job.
LEADFEMALE:You want anything from the hardware store? Uhyeah.
LEADFEMALE:Bring me back a great big, old, uh table-top saw, you know, and a couple of, uh power drills, would you? you want to be a wise guy, huh? Well, just for that noooo! No, dan, those are for halloween.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! halloween! Did she say halloween? Dad, you remember some psycho named mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Osmund? didn't she have a couple hits during the seventies? honey, you know the one they came and took away? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:She was a real psycho.
LEADFEMALE:Wasn't she the one who was always trying to bite her face? Well, that was when there was still hope.
LEADFEMALE:But you know what happened with her after that.
SUPMALE:Of course i know what happened.
SUPMALE:Who could forget? She, uh she escaped.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:No, she didn't.
SUPMALE:You said they let her out.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, we just didn't want to scare you.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:You know there's an apb out on her.
LEADMALE:Is that right? Dan there's a woman in our back yard.
LEADMALE:She's hiding behind the garage.
SUPMALE:I better go out there, honey.
LEADFEMALE:No, dan, no! where'd she go? where'd she go? Aah! aah! She ate her face.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right! Aren't you a little old for this junk? Yeah, but we are just so good at it.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:When it comes to horror, your mom here's the champ.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Did you say champ? That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I am the fair maiden of fright.
SUPFEMALE:Get back, loretta.
LEADMALE:Jackie, would you set her straight, please? Oh, i don't know, sis.
LEADFEMALE:I think he might've got you last year when he ate his eyeball.
LEADFEMALE:You guys are so weak with all this halloween stuff every year.
LEADFEMALE:Halloween? did she say halloween? I can't stand it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm losing my mind.
SUPFEMALE:Igorstore! Firebad.
LEADFEMALE:Painass.
LEADMALE:All right, i'm going.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I got a date.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, that's not a very good look for you.

LEADMALE:Now scram.
LEADMALE:Get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:Have you seen my khakis? Oh, my god! oh, no! oh, no, no, no, no, no! Thank god.
LEADMALE:I just hate burnt toast.
LEADFEMALE:You aren't playing fair.
LEADFEMALE:Is there any coffee? no! aah! How'd you know i didn't really get fried by that lousy toaster? Because the lights didn't flicker.
SUPFEMALE:See, when you get electrocuted, you complete a circuit, and your body sucks up enough current to create a short in the rest of the house.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, professor.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, a fresh brain.
LEADMALE:An unused brain.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he is your son.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene! They cut out my tongue.
SUPFEMALE:You are so gross.
LEADMALE:Gross? You're disgusting! And i'm proud to be your mommy.
SUPFEMALE:Now clean up this blood, and finish your breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing down there? The backstroke.
LEADMALE:Happy halloween, everybody! Happy halloween.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! Very funny, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I got you something.
LEADMALE:Sounds from the haunted mansion.
LEADMALE:Boy, "moans, screams, and rattling chains.
LEADMALE:" i get it.
LEADMALE:You taped your date last night.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:How did you guess? what's this? The speakers are detachable.
LEADMALE:Aha! So what? So you put the speakers in the windows and we can haunt the entire neighborhood.
LEADMALE:I'll go get the extension cord.
SUPMALE:He's so scary.
SUPMALE:How's your costume coming? It's the coolest.
SUPFEMALE:You want to see? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Walk this way.
LEADMALE:Oh! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:I am going to be the wicked witch of the midwest.
LEADMALE:Great cape.
SUPFEMALE:Where'd you get the hat? My mother-in-law.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad the girls aren't into halloween anymore.
LEADMALE:Well, every day's halloween for darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
OTHERMALE:Becky's 14, so all she cares about is boys and herself.
LEADMALE:She'll grow out of that.
LEADFEMALE:Why? I never did.
LEADMALE:Honey, i need a rag.
LEADFEMALE:I need a rag.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do? what does it look like? I cut myself.
LEADMALE:You want the first-aid kit? Yeah, you better get it.
LEADFEMALE:That's a lot of blood.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? I was cutting something on the jigsaw, and it was kinda dull.
LEADMALE:Well, let me look.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll need stitches.
LEADMALE:Aah! The master.
SUPFEMALE:You half scared me to death.
LEADFEMALE:The master.
LEADFEMALE:That is the sickest thing i have ever seen.
LEADMALE:The master.
LEADMALE:This is a sick household.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:It's going to be a lot sicker before i'm done with him, 'cause this time, it's personal.
LEADMALE:This is so great.
LEADMALE:Maybe we'll get thunder and lightning like in frankenstein.
LEADFEMALE:Bzzzzt! it's alive! it's alive! ha ha ha ha! And i'm married to it.
SUPFEMALE:That's diane for me.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:That's diane for me.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, has a guy named jeff gralick called today? isn't he the oak orchard job? Yeah, he's that garage conversion.
LEADFEMALE:He wanted to call this afternoon and speak to me about some changes in the plans if he could get through.
SUPFEMALE:I might be able to talk him into some den work if some people would get off the phone! No.
LEADFEMALE:No what? No, he didn't call.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh! That is the geekiest costume i have ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you get the hideous mask? Drop dead.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Good? That was great.
SUPMALE:I fell right down.
LEADMALE:That was the perfect death.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you need to look a little more bludgeoned.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and i need a scar.
SUPFEMALE:Can you do scars? I mean bloody, drippy, gooey, ugly scars.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i can do scars.
SUPMALE:I'll do your makeup, too, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, becky won't be needing makeup.
OTHERFEMALE:She's already grotesque and hideous as it is.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you shut your thin-lipped little mouth? makeup! Where are the apples? didn't we buy like a hundred apples today? can't i even get an apple in my own house? They're for the apple-bob later on.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's just great! Jeez, i thought i was going to be the wicked witch.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
OTHERMALE:Why aren't you getting ready for your party? i'm not going, ok? I don't even like marci michaelson or any of her snotty little friends anyway.
SUPMALE:You didn't get invited? who said i wasn't invited? I'm just guessing.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm glad i'm not going.
LEADFEMALE:Just because they're in 10th grade, they think they're so brilliant.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know, older kids are supposed to rank on younger kids.
LEADFEMALE:That's what high school's all about.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look how you rank on darlene, and you're only a freshman.
LEADMALE:Hey, we can always use a couple more bodies at the old haunted ranchero-even if they are alive.
OTHERMALE:Forget about it, ok? I'm not interested! hey, hey! Just 'cause you got your evening ruined doesn't mean you have to go ahead and ruin mine.
LEADFEMALE:I hate halloween.
OTHERMALE:You don't even know what halloween is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't you not tell me about it.
LEADMALE:Ok, i won't.
OTHERMALE:Halloween is the one night of the entire year where the veil is lifted between the living and the dead.
OTHERFEMALE:And the dead return from hell to walk the earth.
LEADFEMALE:And we have to dress up like ghosts and goblins and stuff to fake out the evil spirits or else they might carry us back to hell with them.
SUPFEMALE:So why do the dead people come back? For the candy.
SUPMALE:There's no chocolate in hell.
LEADFEMALE:That's why it's hell.
LEADMALE:Well, they have some chocolate, but it's really crummy chocolate-like it doesn't have any caramel, or nougat, doesn't have any creamy center or almonds.
LEADFEMALE:Mother.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want to go and get dressed or do you just want to go straight to hell? I beheaded the washing machine.
SUPMALE:What'd you do that for? You'll see, my pretty.
LEADMALE:You'll see.
SUPMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:I think we've got everything down here.
SUPFEMALE:I lit the jack o' lanterns.
SUPMALE:I got the dishes of candy all laid out in the front room.
SUPMALE:You ok? I got the garage cleaned up.
SUPMALE:The games are ready to go.
SUPMALE:I've got the apple-bob's set up.
LEADFEMALE:You sure you ok? And let's seeoh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. and darlene made the cutest little fake spiders.
SUPMALE:I'm so proud of them.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's getting dark out.

SUPMALE:Looks like you lost a wing.
SUPFEMALE:Emergency exits are that way and that way.
LEADFEMALE:So, are you feeling better? I guess so, but i hate marci michaelson.
LEADMALE:Well, no need to worry, my child.
LEADMALE:I've already cursed her.
LEADMALE:She will have chronic morning breath, chapped lips, and triplets from her first pregnancy.

LEADFEMALE:Take her over and strap her in that desk.
LEADFEMALE:I told you about disturbing me when i'm trying to relax.
LEADMALE:Watch it, studs.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, darlene, but it's death by pop quiz.
SUPFEMALE:Aah! That's her.
LEADMALE:Now blow her away.
SUPMALE:Question number one-what country lies between russia and afghanistan? detroit? What's wrong with the sentence, "fred and me are going to the movies.
SUPFEMALE:" you're too ugly to get a date? spell symbiosis! What's the capital of argentina? if johnny has 4 apples and is traveling at a speed of 40 miles an hour and has to be in florida by wednesday, what time should he leave? I'm melting.

SUPFEMALE:The tub was already filled.
LEADMALE:Becky! that was my bath! Ohh, i'm going to kill you.
SUPFEMALE:I have a date tonight with jimmy.

LEADMALE:Are you kidding? I'd probably die of embarrassment.
SUPMALE:Precisely my point.
LEADMALE:Aah! And she says i never let her have any friends over.
LEADMALE:It's going to take just another minute.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.

LEADFEMALE:I don't want to die.
SUPFEMALE:I've been cooking all day.
SUPMALE:Ow, ow, ow, ow.
LEADFEMALE:Ow, ow, ow, ow.

SUPMALE:You have the right to remain silent, which you would never exercise.
LEADMALE:Hey, aren't those my earrings? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:They're nice.
SUPMALE:I borrowed them.
SUPFEMALE:Anything you say is usually sarcastic and will be used against you.
LEADMALE:Am i ever gonna get 'em back? No.
LEADFEMALE:And since you can't afford an attorney because you quit your job, one will be provided for you.
SUPFEMALE:You know i'm not a bracelet person.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you take these off? You killed 4 people, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's just like you to throw that at me, isn't it? when is my trial? Right now.
SUPMALE:Counselor, you may begin.
LEADMALE:Your honor, the prosecution would like to begin by calling as its first witness miss darlene conner.
LEADMALE:Objection! You can't call somebody up there that i murdered.
LEADMALE:Allegedly murdered, your honor.
OTHERMALE:Objection overruled.
LEADMALE:You may continue.
SUPFEMALE:Miss connor, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god? Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, dad.
LEADMALE:Hi, punkin.
LEADMALE:Am i in trouble? No, you're not.
LEADMALE:No, you're not.
LEADMALE:All you need for you to do is to tell these nice people over here just what it was that your mom did to you the other day.
SUPFEMALE:She murdered me.
SUPMALE:Allegedly.
LEADFEMALE:Miss conner do you know the difference between right and wrong? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Right is doing something wrong and you don't get caught.
LEADMALE:Wrong is when you do something wrong and you do get caught.
LEADMALE:I move that this witness be dismissed on the grounds that she's a punk.
LEADMALE:Beat it.
LEADFEMALE:Your honor, we would like to call miss becky conner.
OTHERFEMALE:I got one extra cheese, one mushroom.
LEADMALE:We gotta move it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm double parked.

LEADMALE:Hey, nobody can talk to my kids like that except me.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up! Sustained.
LEADMALE:Hi, daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Hiya, princess.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanna say that i understand what you did, mom, but i still think you should be punished for it.
OTHERMALE:Because that's the american judicial system.
LEADFEMALE:Democracy itself is at stake if we let people get away with murder.
LEADMALE:You know, becky you say that your mom killed you, but all she really did was cause you a little pain and embarrassment.
OTHERMALE:Courtroom: ooh! Do you know how much pain you've caused your mother? You're thinking of darlene.
LEADMALE:I've never caused my mother pain.
LEADMALE:Your honor, i would like to submit this tape made in the delivery room of lanford general hospital on the night of march 15, 1975.
SUPFEMALE:Dan: push! roseanne: aahh! push, honey! aaahh! you can do it! shut up! i hate you, dan! you're never getting near me again, and i mean it! You did that, becky.
LEADMALE:Your mother was trying to give you life, and all you gave her was excruciating agony.
SUPFEMALE:I apologize, mom, and i forgive you.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you, too, mother.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down, or i'll throw the book at you! You shouldn't be throwing books.
SUPFEMALE:There are people in this world who don't even have books.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Don't you be throwing stuff at my kid.
SUPMALE:The people would like to call crystal anderson.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like meatball or double cheese? Double cheese.
SUPFEMALE:You look great, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Flattery won't get you anywhere, murderer.
LEADMALE:Your honor, roseanne had the best husband in the world, and what she did is unforgivable.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, crystal, you just have the hots for dan and you always have.
LEADMALE:Let's cut the crap here.
LEADFEMALE:We all know roseanne and what she's like.
LEADMALE:She's loud, she's bossy, and talks with her mouth full.
LEADFEMALE:She curses at people when she drives.
LEADMALE:She feeds her children frozen fish sticks and high-calorie sodas.
LEADFEMALE:And she doesn't have proper grooming habits.
OTHERMALE:Most important, your honor, she's married to the greatest man a woman could ever want, and she don't appreciate him! Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Dan conner is tender, kind, loving, loyal, strong, masculine, sexy, and virile.
LEADMALE:And i mean, when you see him on a summer day, and his hair's sweaty around the edges and the rest of it's fluffed up and golden from the sun, and his shirt is clinging to him from sweat because he's been working so hard-well, he's about the sexiest man i've seen.
OTHERFEMALE:No further questions, your honor.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, i love you.
LEADFEMALE:Your honor, i say hang the bitch.
OTHERMALE:You know, crystal, the only reason i'm your friend is just because i feel sorry for you.
LEADMALE:You had 3 men in your life and lost them all.
SUPMALE:And i have been telling you the only way to keep a man happy is to treat him like dirt sometimes! men do not like wimpy little cream puffs! She's right.
LEADMALE:You're darn right i'm right.
OTHERMALE:The only reason i say those awful, hurtful things to you is the same reason i say them to dan and my kids-it's out of love! Ma'am, you can step down now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you girls have settled your differences, but we still have do you realize the seriousness of this charge? You could get from 25 years to life.
LEADMALE:I got courtroom: ooh! Wisecracks won't save you this time.
SUPMALE:It wasn't a wisecrack.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted that's why i married him.
LEADMALE:I love him.
SUPFEMALE:If you loved him, why did you kill him and your 3 beautiful children? Your honor, all i wanted was 10 minutes alone in my own bathroom! Your honor, in light of the fact that these are highly unorthodox proceedings, i myself would like to testify on roseanne's behalf.
LEADMALE:For what purpose? Why, as a character witness, your honor.

LEADMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:Pleasure's mine.
OTHERFEMALE:Obviously, you've never dined with us before.
SUPMALE:So, where'd you find this guy? He found me.
OTHERMALE:I sent him and his wife on a cruise.
SUPFEMALE:You know, to save their marriage.
OTHERMALE:I sent them to the caribbean during hurricane season.
SUPFEMALE:They didn't stand a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie.
SUPMALE:I want you to do something that would make your father very happy.
LEADMALE:You should ask him to carve the turkey.
LEADMALE:How you boys doing in here? Much better now that you are here.
LEADMALE:Why, thank you, ed.
LEADFEMALE:Can i get anybody a drink? Not me, honey, i've got to start watching this figure.
LEADMALE:I'll take one, honey.
SUPFEMALE:How about another bourbon, neat? Vodka rocks would be much appreciated.
LEADFEMALE:Good enough.
SUPMALE:You need a hand, crystal? She's got one.
OTHERMALE:I remember when she was just a skinny little kid.
SUPFEMALE:She's filled out nice though, huh, danny? did i meet her husband? She's divorced.
OTHERFEMALE:Twice, then widowed.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i don't think a man was meant to be married to the same woman all of his life.
SUPFEMALE:But i'm not a man.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a robot.
SUPMALE:Dan! One second.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, i want to talk to you.
LEADMALE:I guarantee it, the minute i get up, there's going to be a 90-yard touchdown run.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want? uh, is it ok if my dad carves the turkey this year? Great sense of humor, al.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not ok.
SUPMALE:This is my house, my family, i'm the dad.
LEADFEMALE:I bought the turkey, i paid for the turkey, i'll carve the turkey.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:That's just stupid.
LEADMALE:Because first of all, it's our house.
OTHERMALE:And second of all, i cooked the damn bird.
SUPFEMALE:I'll carve it.
SUPFEMALE:I liked the part when the guy's face melted off.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gross me out.
LEADFEMALE:Ugh! ew! Well, you said to gross you out.
SUPMALE:You know, i think maine is probably the prettiest spot on the face of this earth.
LEADMALE:So kim greene has three kids.
SUPMALE:What's the point? Nothing.
SUPMALE:I'm just saying-but i want to know why you're saying it.
LEADMALE:I wanna know why you're sitting here-she's talking to me about kim greene! Rose, why is she losing her temper? I don't know, mom, maybe you're driving her nuts.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to know, what's the point of telling me that kim greene is married with three kids? what's it mean? It means that she's had sex at least 3 times since she's been married.
SUPFEMALE:He wanted to sit with us.
OTHERFEMALE:Major body odor.
LEADFEMALE:Twice if she had twins, or once if she had triplets.
LEADMALE:All, you're being filthy! Or it's possible they never had sex and your mother's making up this whole thing.
SUPFEMALE:That's what i think, daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you reading so much into it? I just told you a simple fact.
LEADMALE:If you want to waste your life living alone and working in a bar, fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not here to tell you what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not wasting my life, mom! I just spent six weeks at the police training academy in springfield.
LEADFEMALE:Springfield? what were you doing in springfield? what'd you need, tires? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I was becoming a cop, and i am now a rookie policewoman for the lanford police force.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear that? Yeah, i've been hearing it my whole life.
SUPMALE:What does she mean she became a policewoman? how could she do something so impulsive? so reckless, so dangerous? She could get killed or maimed.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, did you know about this? I guess so.
OTHERMALE:Then why didn't she tell me? I don't know, ma.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she thought you would take it bad.
LEADMALE:You know, i don't think i even want to talk about it anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh, that is just what i love about our family.
LEADMALE:We don't want to talk about something, so we bring it up at the dinner table.
LEADMALE:More turkey? Come on, deej, hurry up.
LEADMALE:I can hardly keep my eyes open.
OTHERFEMALE:There's some kind of chemical in turkey-tryptophan.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, god, that stuff puts you to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it can't be them four beers.
SUPMALE:Hey, i ain't driving anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Pipe down.
SUPMALE:I am going to explode.
LEADMALE:Would you like me to make you a nice turkey sandwich? oh! How can you even talk about food? 'cause i don't feel like talking about sex, and what else is there? how you doing, sweetheart? I'm doing real good, mama.
LEADFEMALE:Real good.
SUPMALE:How's the business? Pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think of jay? I think whatever makes you happy.

LEADMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'll walk you guys out to the car.
LEADMALE:Al, give dan our keys.
LEADFEMALE:He can bring our bags in.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a second.
LEADFEMALE:Dan thinks so, dan and i think a motel makes more sense for everyone.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go take out the trash.
LEADMALE:I made reservations for you at the lanford motel.
LEADMALE:A motel? I thought you were kidding.
LEADFEMALE:That's where jay and i are staying.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we'll have breakfast together.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Bye, mom.
LEADMALE:See you tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, if you didn't want us to stay over, why didn't you just say something? Well, i tried.
LEADFEMALE:This is so last minute.
OTHERMALE:I would've packed a different nightgown.
LEADFEMALE:She's like a ballplayer.
LEADFEMALE:She has home and away uniforms.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i just hope the heat works in this motel.
LEADFEMALE:Your father's been fighting the flu.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you guys don't have to go right now, do you? wouldn't you like to have more coffee? Ha, as it is, i'm not going to be able to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I hate motels, but that's ok.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, honey, you'll have a hot bath, i'll read the newspaper to you, then you can keep me up all night.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys on your way? We're going to a motel! Good choice.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, danny.
SUPFEMALE:Look, i'm gonna see you guys tomorrow, right? what are you doing, you taking off? I'm just going down to cryssy's you know, and help her and the kids in with that furniture.
LEADMALE:Are you coming back? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What are you doing, dad? what do you mean? why don't you just leave crystal alone? Why? 'cause i asked you to.
OTHERFEMALE:You got something going on with her? that's supposed to be funny? are we talking man to man here or what? Hey, i'm a married man.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm not a married man at the moment.
LEADFEMALE:And being alone is a lot for two people to have in common.
OTHERMALE:You don't know anything about that, son, and i hope to god you never do.
LEADFEMALE:See you tomorrow? Yeah, pop, i'll see you tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Are you ok? Yeah, i'm ok.
SUPFEMALE:How you doing? I think i'm ok.
LEADMALE:You know, i got a crush on you.
LEADFEMALE:You better.
SUPFEMALE:Are they gone? Yes, they're gone, you cowering wimp.
LEADMALE:You want me to help you with the kitchen? No, i'm not doing nothing until tomorrow 'cause i'm just exhausted.
LEADMALE:Ok, i'll see you in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, what time? oh, s-noon ok? Yeah, ok.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:You want me to pack you up some stuff? No, i'll see you in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:How could i send them to a motel? No, i can't think like that, or i'll just drive myself crazy and finish that pumpkin pie in the refrigerator.
LEADFEMALE:Look at them in there.
LEADMALE:Laying around like a bunch of beached whales.
LEADFEMALE:And they're all mine.
LEADMALE:And for this, i am truly thankful.
LEADMALE:Of course, i'd trade any one of them for a dishwasher.
LEADFEMALE:How are you doing, birdie? You look like i feel.
LEADMALE:Captioned by the national what does she mean she became a policewoman? how could she do something so impulsive, so reckless, so dangerous? she could get killed and maimed! Roseanne, did you know about this? Yeah, i guess.
SUPMALE:Then why didn't she tell me? I don't know, ma.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she thought you'd take it bad.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i don't even want to talk about it anymore! Well, that's just what i love about this family.
LEADFEMALE:If we don't want to talk about something, we bring it up at the dinner table.
LEADFEMALE:Here, have some more turkey!
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Uhh, i can't stand susan noonan.
OTHERFEMALE:She's such a gossip.
OTHERMALE:Don't ever trust her with anything, diane.
LEADMALE:You know what she once told me? And don't ever say anything to anyone 'cause i promised her i wouldn't tell.
LEADMALE:She told me that her sister was born before her parents were actually married.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't that cool? I had to help your mom with the groceries.
SUPMALE:Oh, you wanted to help her 'cause i had you beat.
SUPMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I had you by 5 points till the buzzer came on.
SUPMALE:I got to go, diane.
LEADMALE:The 'rents just came in.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:Tell me.
LEADMALE:What did you buy me? Nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out of there.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, i think you should put a light outside so we can play basketball at night.
SUPMALE:You know, you got a light on your desk so you can do your homework.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't do that in the house.
SUPMALE:Darlene.
LEADMALE:Darlene, set the table.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do it! Go ahead, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Suck-up.
SUPMALE:Nobody buys your goody-goody act.
OTHERFEMALE:Mommy buys it.
LEADMALE:Hey, you know what, kid? It could be pretty close there friday night.
LEADMALE:No way.
SUPMALE:Jordan is unstoppable.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Things get pretty hairy with fat lever at point guard.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:What's a point guard? Forget it.
OTHERMALE:Mom, i can't reach the plates.
LEADFEMALE:Big game friday night, baby.
SUPMALE:What kind of game? Basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Hoops.
OTHERFEMALE:B-ball.
LEADMALE:Pulses race as the towering chicago bulls take on the wimpy, sponge-like denver nuggets.
LEADFEMALE:Be there! Pay me.
LEADMALE:Mom, i can't reach the glasses.
LEADFEMALE:How can someone not appreciate basketball? Well, it's easy.
LEADFEMALE:You just slouch on the sofa next to your husband, you watch these guys run up and down the court a couple hundred times, and then it becomes almost hypnotic.
LEADMALE:You get really bored.
LEADFEMALE:You're sitting there thinking, "wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I have no life.
SUPFEMALE:" this message was not brought to you by the national basketball association.
LEADFEMALE:I think i'm going out with jimmy on friday night.
LEADMALE:Talk about having no life.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i bet you have some real major plans.
LEADFEMALE:I'm watching the game with dad.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, the son i never had.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i'm watching the game, too! Ok.
SUPMALE:Honey, i invited a few of the fellas over friday night.
LEADMALE:Yeah, are you asking me or telling me? Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:It's an occasion.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's break out the harvey's bristol cream, shall we? what time's the kickoff? Tip-off is at 7:00.
LEADMALE:Well, you ain't gonna watch it anyways, darlene, until you do your homework.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember, we had this discussion? Yeah, but this is a friday night.
SUPFEMALE:Since when do i have to do my homework on a friday night? Since i got your last report card.
LEADMALE:Well, the only homework i'm gonna have to do this weekend is to write a stupid poem well, you can write a poem.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but it has to be stupid.
LEADMALE:Oh, knock it off, you guys.
SUPFEMALE:Anyways, writing poetry's kind of fun, you know? You get to be creative and expressive.
LEADMALE:I don't want to be expressive.
SUPMALE:I couldn't care less about poetry.
OTHERFEMALE:I just want to graduate high school so i can get on with my life so i can get a job and get out of this hellhole town! But if you could be expressive, what would you say? hey, how you doing there, sylvia plath? who's sylvia plath? Oh, she was this brilliant poet, full of passion, angst, and whatever.
OTHERFEMALE:She inspired quite a few women.
SUPFEMALE:Like moi.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:What's that? Well, i was in the garage, and i went through this trunk, and i found all these poems i wrote when i was in school.
LEADFEMALE:I thought maybe it'd help you.
LEADMALE:Help? You saved me.
LEADFEMALE:So which one should i copy? Hey! Ow.
LEADFEMALE:"the sky drips down like dragon's teeth.
SUPFEMALE:" "the earth sighs "bending to my touch.
LEADMALE:I am melting.
LEADFEMALE:" you had to be there.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess "there" must mean mars.
LEADMALE:Well, there's other poems in there that aren't quite so earthy.
LEADFEMALE:Why'd you write these? Because i wanted to.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i can't write about this kind of stuff.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? "write a poem "about something that gives you a happy feeling.
LEADFEMALE:"for example-a tree, a rainbow, your--heh heh--family.
LEADMALE:" you can write about whatever you want.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, as long as it gives me "a happy feeling.
LEADFEMALE:" oh, come off it, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Just 'cause your teacher's a little wet doesn't mean that all poetry stinks.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, poetry's really cool.
SUPMALE:I loved to write it when i was in school.
SUPMALE:Well, yeah, but you were a nerd.
OTHERMALE:I was not a nerd.
SUPMALE:Dad said you were a nerd in school.
LEADMALE:Well, consider the source.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, what do you think about these people like, you know, edie brickell or chrissie hynde or rickie lee jones? you think they're nerds? I get the point.
LEADMALE:So, what would make you happy? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:A tree! Ok, deej.
OTHERFEMALE:You call us when you're ready, and we'll come and pick you up.
LEADMALE:Ok, bye.
LEADMALE:Yeah, good luck.
SUPFEMALE:Where's he at, at janet's? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Janet's mom invited him to stay for dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Says he's going to marry janet.
OTHERMALE:She proposed to him.
LEADFEMALE:Can you blame her? He's got his daddy's charm.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and everything else.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, well, you tell yourself whatever you want, dan.
SUPMALE:Is darlene out there? She's doing her homework.
LEADMALE:It's a theory.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i just don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:Writing is something that darlene could be really, really good at.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, she's expressive, you know, she's creative, she has pencils.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, joey.
LEADFEMALE:It's joey l.
SUPMALE:Joey, what's the word? are you coming over here to watch the game tomorrow night? Hey, just tell your wife-one second.
SUPFEMALE:Let me take this in the hall.
LEADMALE:So where's you and what's-his-face going on friday? Out.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, you'll have a real good time.
LEADFEMALE:Your daddy and i used to go there all the time.
LEADMALE:Are you gonna stay here with dad and watch the game? Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt jackie's coming over.
SUPMALE:What are you guys gonna do? Drink beer and shoot at mailboxes.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:I'll reserve the blue chair for you.
SUPFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha! I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Break it to me gently.
OTHERFEMALE:How many? Five, six tops.
LEADFEMALE:Now you understand i'm not talking about their i.
LEADFEMALE:Q.
OTHERMALE:S.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking about the number of your nasty friends that are gonna be in my living room on friday.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, it's just a couple of friends.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be civilized, i promise.
LEADFEMALE:Civilized? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:This time we'll cook the woolly mammoth before we eat it.
LEADMALE:Hello, hello, hello.
SUPMALE:Hi, crystal.
SUPMALE:I finally got that eye shadow you ordered-violet ice.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so that's where you and jimmy are going-to vegas.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
SUPMALE:I got something for you, too, dan.
OTHERMALE:Now, crystal, you know i rarely wear eye shadow anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Boys on the job site give me such guff about it.
SUPFEMALE:Now stop.
OTHERFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADMALE:Ooh, stallion.
OTHERFEMALE:He don't need that, crystal.
OTHERFEMALE:He already smells like a horse.
SUPMALE:Don't you, honey? what did you bring me? Oh, bath beads, made with real milk.
SUPFEMALE:Well, great.
OTHERMALE:Then when i'm soaking and i get hungry, i'll just add some cheerios.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, i got something i want to read you.
SUPMALE:It's a poem that lonnie wrote for school.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought you'd get a kick out of it.
SUPFEMALE:"my mom.
LEADFEMALE:"by lonnie anderson.
LEADMALE:"my mom thinks about me first and herself last.
SUPMALE:"when i'm getting dressed, she makes me breakfast.
SUPMALE:"she puts me on the bus and combs my hair, "and when i'm at school, she isn't there.
LEADFEMALE:"but she's at home when i get back.
SUPFEMALE:"for making dinner she has a knack.
SUPMALE:"it's nice when she puts me in bed because it's late and i'm tire-ed.
LEADFEMALE:" "i love my mom, "and i'm glad that she's my mom and not somebody else or something.
SUPFEMALE:" isn't that the sweetest thing you ever heard? I think it's great.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's terrible, but it's just so sweet, isn't it? It's adorable.
OTHERMALE:Here you go, crystal.
LEADMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:So, where's your little poetic genius? what are you talking about? Why, darlene, silly.
SUPMALE:Didn't you hear yet? hear what? Well, maybe i ought to let darlene tell you.
OTHERMALE:Come on, crystal.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene's poem got picked best in her class.
SUPMALE:She's gonna read it for the school tomorrow night.
OTHERMALE:It's culture night.
SUPMALE:You're kidding.
LEADMALE:How come darlene didn't say anything? I hope i didn't spoil the surprise.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, will you come down here for a minute? Sweetie! Well, she finally does good in school, and she doesn't even tell us about it.
SUPFEMALE:Probably still in shock.
SUPMALE:What? Look.
LEADMALE:Look, it's the famous person as a young child.
LEADFEMALE:How come you didn't tell us? Crystal, you have a big mouth.
OTHERMALE:Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene.
OTHERMALE:Darlene.
LEADMALE:Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene.
SUPMALE:Darlene.
LEADMALE:Darlene.
LEADMALE:This is exactly the reason i'm not going to culture night.
SUPMALE:What, are you ashamed of your talent? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ashamed of my parents.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so is everybody.
SUPFEMALE:It's supposed to be like that.
LEADMALE:Mom, i'm not going.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta say i'm sick.
LEADFEMALE:But why wouldn't you want to go? I mean, this is your shot, this is like winning the big game.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, you can't make me go.
LEADFEMALE:And if you try and make me read my poem in front of the geekoid masses, you'll have to throw a net around me and drag me out of the house like a dead seal.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? To get the net.
SUPMALE:You know, i think you're just being pigheaded about this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i think you're being pigheaded about it, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're starting to sound like my dad.
LEADMALE:"work smart, danny, not hard.
LEADFEMALE:Be a salesman.
OTHERFEMALE:" i'm not--i'm not gonna do it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna push our kids like that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i don't want to, either.
LEADMALE:Then what's the big deal about making darlene read this stupid poem? It is called positive reinforcement, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You know, just once, if my parents would've ever told me, "hey, roseanne, you're good at that," i might be standing in front of you right now mopping a bigger, more luxurious kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:It's wet! Go use the phone in my room.
SUPMALE:I'm talking to your dad.
LEADMALE:I don't need to use the phone.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, let me get that on tape.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i really don't think you should make darlene go to culture night.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? and why is that? Because it's totally geeky.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you know what it's like.
LEADFEMALE:There's paintings, the school band, readings, and stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean, like art? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:But strictly the bow tie set.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, everyone's gonna think darlene's a big suck-up if she goes.
LEADMALE:Why, thank you, miss conner.
SUPMALE:No further questions.
OTHERFEMALE:You can tell your client she can get herself a new attorney.
SUPFEMALE:So you're gonna make her go? Nobody's making anybody do anything.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell her.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky, mind your own business.
LEADMALE:If you really want to help around here, just stay out of it.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:If you don't care about your kids, i guess there's nothing i can do.
OTHERMALE:She didn't buy it, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You were terrible.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just getting fed up.
SUPMALE:We owe it to darlene to make her do this, and she's doing it.
LEADMALE:That's funny 'cause i thought darlene had 2 parents, and this was a decision that both of them should be involved in.
LEADMALE:Well, look, ok, we obviously disagree, and we have to come to some kind of a decision.
SUPFEMALE:And one of us is gonna be wrong.
LEADMALE:Now you just give me the chance to be wrong this time.
LEADMALE:Look, no matter what we do, we're going to screw our kids up.
SUPMALE:You let me mess up darlene, and you can have becky.
LEADFEMALE:What about d.j. ? We'll flip for it.
OTHERMALE:You know, this whole thing is miss miller's fault.
LEADFEMALE:If i'd known anyone else was gonna see this poem, i never would've written it.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't seen it.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna.
LEADMALE:No, but i am going to hear it being read.
LEADFEMALE:Liveand on stage.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, mom, i'm begging you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll clean whatever you want me to clean.
SUPFEMALE:I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really don't want to do this.
SUPMALE:Really? Come on, mom.
LEADMALE:I wrote the poem, ok? I did my assignment.
LEADMALE:Why can't we just leave it at that? what are you so afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything.
OTHERMALE:Well, you just give me one good reason, you give me the truth, and maybe i won't make you do it.
LEADMALE:The truth? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the opposite of what you usually tell me.
LEADFEMALE:The truth is my poem sucks.
LEADFEMALE:I wrote it in, like, 10 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:I just blabbed it out on a piece of paper.
SUPMALE:It's a joke.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss miller doesn't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Well, miss miller's an idiot.
SUPFEMALE:The only reason she picked my poem is 'cause she thought it would encourage me.
OTHERMALE:You know, i'm really surprised at you, darlene.
LEADMALE:What's everybody gonna think if you don't show up? who cares what everybody thinks? well, if you don't care what everybody thinks, then what are you so afraid of? dan, come here quick! darlene's speechless! you got to see this! You know what i think? what? I think i think you're afraid that your poem really is good.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're afraid to let everybody see that you've got a brain because then they'll expect you to use it.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:I'm so surprised at you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, your whole life you're running around to take all the credit for everything you've done wrong, and now something really great happens.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you want to enjoy it? don't you want to get up there and take your bow? No.
SUPMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:You do what you want.
LEADMALE:I just thought i'd get a little joy out of it, you know? A few goosebumps.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be proud of you but i don't want you to do it just because you think you owe it to me.
LEADMALE:Ok, i wont.
LEADMALE:But you are doing it.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because i'm your mother, and i said so.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's fair.
LEADFEMALE:What if i freak out? what if i faint and crack my head open on stage? Well, then everybody will be able to see that you've got a brain.
LEADFEMALE:I hope we get back in time to watch the end of the game.
OTHERMALE:Oh, i'm sure your daddy will give us his famous highlights speech.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi, darlene! Hi, martin.
OTHERMALE:How you doing? Well, i'll tell you, darlene, i'm not really into this high-pressure, high-visibility stuff.
LEADMALE:I'm really more of a recluse.
OTHERMALE:You want to get some punch? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i made it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne, this place still scares me.
SUPMALE:We better take our seats or else they'll make us stay after.
LEADFEMALE:Where's dan? He's boycotting on principle.
LEADMALE:So he's home watching the game? Among other things.
LEADFEMALE:What a bunch of nerds.
LEADFEMALE:Joke! You think i did the right thing, don't you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I--i think that she'll probably despise you right now, but i--you did what you had to do.
LEADMALE:And besides, she still loves her aunt jackie.
SUPMALE:Away away why do you stay? Fly away, bird.
LEADMALE:It looks at me.
LEADMALE:Andstill it hops and hops and hops.
LEADFEMALE:Fly away.
LEADFEMALE:You got a gun on you? It spreads its wings and flies away.
LEADFEMALE:Away it does not look back.
LEADMALE:That's it.
OTHERMALE:Can you imagine that kid's home life? Get a load of that-embarrassing your kid in front of the whole school.
SUPMALE:Mom did that to me.
LEADMALE:Drill team tryouts in the eighth grade.
OTHERFEMALE:She sat up in the bleachers weeping and pulling those stiff, used kleenex out of her bag.
LEADMALE:Do you got, like, a mint or something? My stomach's just kind of, you know oh, roseanne, you're nervous.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's so cute.
SUPMALE:Ooh, ooh, ooh.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
SUPMALE:Thank you so much for that fine rendition.
LEADFEMALE:And now, from miss miller's seventh grade class, darlene conner will read her poem.
SUPMALE:To whom it concerns.
OTHERMALE:By darlene conner.
SUPMALE:To whom it concerns-darlene's work will be late.
LEADMALE:It fell on her pancakes and stuck to her plate.
LEADMALE:To whom it concerns-my mom made me write this.
SUPFEMALE:And i'm just a kid, so how could i fight this? To whom it concerns-i lost my assignment.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i'll get lucky.
LEADMALE:Solitary confinement.
LEADMALE:To whom it concerns-darlene's great with a ball, but guys don't watch tomboys when they're cruising the hall.
SUPMALE:To whom it concerns-i just turned 13.
SUPFEMALE:Too short to be quarterback, too plain to be queen.
SUPMALE:To whom it concerns i am not made of steel.
LEADFEMALE:When i get blind-sided, my pain is quite real.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean to squawk, but it really burns.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought i'd mention it to whom it concerns.
SUPMALE:Becky! What is the matter with you? It's 20 degrees outside, and he's out there without a hat.
SUPMALE:I'm not his keeper.
OTHERFEMALE:Now can i go back outside and play? No, you put on a hat or else leave your head inside.
LEADFEMALE:Aww.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, i'm working two jobs here.
LEADFEMALE:Now unless you want to go out and get a job, i need you to be an adult when i'm at work.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if i'm an adult, then how come i can't see bon jovi in chicago next week? 'cause you're too young.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I thought i was an adult.
LEADFEMALE:If you were an adult, you wouldn't even like bon jovi.
LEADMALE:Where's your sister? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Who cares? did she go over to cindy's house? Mother, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't check in with me.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hi, gloria.
LEADFEMALE:It's roseanne.
LEADMALE:Did darlene come home with cindy? Yeahnook, well, if she does come over there, tell her i need her to get her butt home right away.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Mother, when can i talk to you? how's june? I'm serious.
SUPFEMALE:I need to talk to you about jimmy.
LEADFEMALE:We're having problems.
LEADMALE:Can we talk about it tomorrow over breakfast? Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:In front of everyone.
OTHERMALE:Well, do you want me to wake you when i come home at 2:30 a.
LEADFEMALE:M.
OTHERMALE:? Mother, i haven't seen you all week.
OTHERFEMALE:You're neglecting me.
LEADFEMALE:I know, honey, but it's nothing personal.
LEADFEMALE:I'm neglecting your brother and sister, too.
SUPFEMALE:Very funny.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be in the shower at 6:00 tomorrow morning.
LEADFEMALE:You come talk to me then.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:It's a date.
SUPFEMALE:Dan.
OTHERMALE:Right? Right.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you said you were gonna be home early today.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, a man can dream, can't he? Well, joey messed up the lumber order, and once he finally got it right, he sent it to the job we were workin' at last week.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe the driver was just too embarrassed to go over to the red velvet massage parlor.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:But you were there, weren't you? Bright and early.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, it's a job, all right? Give me a break.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you must be so proud working there.
LEADMALE:Of course, it doesn't have the prestige of working at chicken divine or the lobo lounge, but it's a massage parlor, dan.
LEADMALE:At least the only breasts i see are dipped in batter.
LEADFEMALE:Same here.
SUPMALE:I hate this place.
LEADFEMALE:I hate this place.
LEADMALE:I hate this place.
SUPMALE:I hate this place.
LEADMALE:How you doing, lizzie? Oh, fine.
SUPMALE:What you got? You're going to love this-i need a long island iced tea, a sloe gin fizz, and a golden cadillac.
SUPMALE:Three shots coming up.
LEADMALE:Stick umbrellas in them.
LEADFEMALE:They'll never know the difference.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene called and said, and i quote, "do not pass a cow.
OTHERFEMALE:I am home.
SUPMALE:" oh, great.
SUPMALE:How's your kid doing.
OTHERMALE:Better? He's coughing some, but mom's got him tonight.
OTHERMALE:How about yours? Oh, they're ok.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, i don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I only see them how's dan? Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Is that my head, or you want something? I could use another.
SUPFEMALE:What, another liver? Yeah, last year we went up to lake wapello.
LEADFEMALE:Course, by the time we got up there, it was too late to do any fishing 'cause the wife doesn't know how to read a map.
LEADFEMALE:Well, reading maps are more a guy's thing, i think, 'cause only guys understand rosie, you make a lousy drink.
OTHERFEMALE:But fortunately, you got the attitude to go with it.
LEADMALE:I can tell that y'all appreciate me by how well you're tipping.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You're not tipping at all, are you? Sorry.
LEADMALE:Hope i didn't embarrass nobody, did i? About time.
LEADFEMALE:Last call! Isn't that annie clement's husband? where? Over there, latched onto that blonde.
LEADFEMALE:It sure is.
LEADFEMALE:What a creep.
LEADFEMALE:I hate men.
LEADFEMALE:I hate blondes.
LEADFEMALE:I hate this whole place.
LEADFEMALE:Lizzie, would you go home with me tonight? what do you think? Hey, larry.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, rosie.
OTHERFEMALE:How's your wife? Fine.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Fine.

OTHERFEMALE:Hey, your wife's due any day, isn't she, larry? so what's that make, five kids now? There's billy and petey and randy give her my regards, larry.
LEADFEMALE:Danhoney? I'm home.
OTHERFEMALE:Get off me.
LEADMALE:Tell your father there's cold cuts in the fridge and don't let the soup boil over 'cause it'll ruin the stove.
SUPMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, dan, that was almost a kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Almost.
LEADMALE:I'm really getting tired of cold sandwiches for dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe if your father had made sure you girls did the dishes, i wouldn't have had to do them when i came home last night at 2:30 a.
LEADFEMALE:M.
LEADMALE:Then i would've had more time to fix something hot for dinner.
SUPFEMALE:But, obviously, he was just too busy watching monday night football or tuesday night butt ball or whatever the hell it is he watches.
LEADMALE:I believe he was watching darlene do her homework.
LEADMALE:Ooh, how dare i take a second job when there's seventh grade algebra to be done.
LEADMALE:It's not worth fighting about, you guys.
LEADMALE:I got more to do tonight.
SUPFEMALE:You know, seeing as how you're the only one around here who has a job, i'll see if i can do the housework tonight to your satisfaction, your royal highness.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, i was just out playing johnny builder with my little pals all day.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan, are you feeling ignored? are you feeling unappreciated? You'll be feeling single in about two seconds.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, there's a huge threat.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys are so weak.
OTHERMALE:Are you gonna get around to doing the laundry sometime, or should i do that, too? Let's see.
LEADMALE:I got a vacation coming up in about 6 months.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do it.
LEADMALE:You know, dan, there is just nothing i would rather do right now than to stay here and argue back and forth with you, but, unfortunately, i have to go to work because that's all i ever do, is work.
SUPFEMALE:So i'll see all of you lovely people later, when i get home from work.
LEADFEMALE:It's a nice try, roseanne, but guilting me isn't going to work! Roseanne: hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, you guys hey! Hey, fred and ginger, there's no dancing in here.
SUPMALE:We ain't dancing, we're cooking.
LEADFEMALE:Well, turn off the stove.
SUPMALE:We don't have a cabaret license.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! That's the third time you guys bumped into me, pal.
LEADMALE:You want to do something about it? you think i'm afraid to hit her? Knock it off.
LEADMALE:Hey, i ain't messing around, rosie.
LEADMALE:I'll flatten that broad.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down and shut up.
LEADMALE:Hey, honey, i need you to get him out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you, my mother? Well, it could be.
OTHERMALE:The sixties were such a blur.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, you need help with her? sit! Hey, liz what? you got any quarters? No, all my money's tied up in real estate.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, joe.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, it comes with the territory.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i once killed a guy in korea just by pressing on his throat.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:You want to come home with me tonight, rosie? Well, that's a wonderful offer, joe, but i'm a married woman.
LEADMALE:Not a happily married woman, but a married woman, nonetheless.
SUPFEMALE:Are we playing strip poker, or what? All right.
SUPMALE:That's it, twinkletoes! I'm sick and tired of you and your hussy bumping into me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting really tired of your mouth.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? hey, you guys wanna take that outside? you want to make us? Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Bring him into it.
LEADFEMALE:You're even dumber than you look! who you calling dumb? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on, come on, come on.
SUPMALE:Come on, guys.
LEADMALE:Come on, now.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's going on? Ohnothing much.
LEADMALE:Just two guys trying to kill each other there.
SUPMALE:Hey! Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on, guys, break it up.
LEADFEMALE:I got it, sarge! hey! break it up! come on, back it up! Sergeant: come on, let's take this outside.
LEADMALE:Get it outside! Hey, rosie, do you think your sister might like to come home with me tonight? Andy, let me ask you a question.
OTHERMALE:Be honest with me, would you? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:What's the longest you and helen have ever gone without having sex? you mean with each other? Come on, man, i'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:The year we had paulie.
SUPMALE:We went most of hockey season, right up to the stanley cup.
LEADFEMALE:Why? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:You having problems in the boodiere department? If you mean the boudoir department, i guess.
SUPMALE:Not major, but i guess.
SUPMALE:You know, she's working a lot.
SUPFEMALE:I'm working a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, dan, you're not rinsing them right.
LEADFEMALE:You get a spot if you don't rinse them right.
LEADMALE:You know, for somebody who's supposed to be the king of his castle, you sure know an awful lot about washing dishes.
LEADMALE:I'm always watching helen do it.
SUPMALE:You don't think i'd touch a dish? Only with your tongue.
LEADFEMALE:All right, danny.
SUPMALE:I'll tell you what to do.
LEADMALE:You set the alarm clock for 4:00 a.
LEADMALE:M.
LEADFEMALE:You wake her up.
SUPFEMALE:You put on a little julio iglesias music.
LEADMALE:Then you treat her to a, uh, moonlight tango in the buff.
SUPFEMALE:Andy, i'm trying to talk to you here.
LEADMALE:What, what? she doesn't like it in the morning? Andy, she gets off of work at 2:30 a.
SUPFEMALE:M.
LEADMALE:I'm supposed to wake her up at 4:00 and say roll over and cha-cha? Buddy, buddy, pal, the worst thing to do is think about it.
SUPMALE:The more you think about it, the more pressure you feel.
OTHERMALE:The more pressure you feel, the less spontaneous you feel.
OTHERMALE:And if you ain't spontaneous, how you going to be romantic? so tell me, how bad is it? Let me put it this way.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm having problems in the "boodiere" department, and i'm discussing it with you.
LEADMALE:You look pretty sharp back there, sis.
LEADFEMALE:You got any idea what you're doing? Not a clue.
LEADFEMALE:But that's me lately.
LEADMALE:Lost.
SUPFEMALE:Lost in the fog that has become my life.
LEADMALE:The ungraspable cloud that is my existence.
SUPFEMALE:You all right? Yeah, i'm fine.
SUPMALE:What's the ungraspable cloud stuff? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:You gonna stick around for a while? you want me to? If you want to.
LEADMALE:I want to know what's wrong, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a cop and withholding information is a you know, it's--it's bad.
LEADFEMALE:Dan's been working a lot more this winter.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's good, isn't it? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well like he's got this really big job at this red velvet massage parlor.
LEADMALE:You know? You can imagine what that's like.
LEADMALE:Oh, have you seen the women who work down there? They walk around in these see-through body stockings and tacky little high heels.
LEADMALE:You're making me feel a lot better.
LEADFEMALE:I'm kidding.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but, uh dan, you know, he's just been under a lot of pressure lately.
SUPFEMALE:You know? He--he's like picking at me for the little tiniest things.
LEADFEMALE:And we just we got like no time together.
SUPFEMALE:You know what i mean? Well, you're both working long hours.
SUPFEMALE:You're bound to get cranky.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and it's having an effect on us.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:He gets cranky, you get crankier.
SUPMALE:We're not having sex.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:How long has it been? what month is this? Have you tried setting the alarm for 4:00 a.
SUPMALE:M.
SUPMALE:And put on a little james brown? You got to be kidding me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what's more important-sex or sleep? Well, i'm too tired to answer that right now.
LEADFEMALE:I just think dan he doesn't even like me anymore, you know? I'm-ohh.
LEADMALE:It's likei'm not, you know i'm not turning him on.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, dan loves you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Just something's wrong, you know.
LEADMALE:It's like i'm doing something wrong.
LEADFEMALE:It's like he doesn't even want to he doesn't want to kiss me anymore.
SUPMALE:Wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:How come you automatically think it's your fault? Well, it's because it is.
SUPFEMALE:Well, have you even talked to him about it? No! And don't you say nothing to him, either.
SUPMALE:'cause you know how he gets if i go telling you all this personal stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Like i'm going to go talk to dan about your guys' sex life.
SUPMALE:She thinks you don't like her anymore.
OTHERMALE:Jackie-now, you think what's between you and my sister is none of my business.
LEADFEMALE:If it wasn't for me, she never would've married you.
SUPMALE:What did she tell you? She didn't tell me anything.
LEADMALE:It's just that she's my sister and i know her.
SUPFEMALE:Why would she think i don't like her anymore? I don't know.
LEADMALE:That's what i'm trying-now, i'm just throwing some things off the top of my head here, but could it be that you're not making love to her? No, it could not be that.
SUPMALE:'cause i can only say that, speaking as a woman, nothing hurts worse than thinking that the man you love isn't hot for you anymore.
SUPMALE:Dan, i--i don't want to brag, but i have been rejected by men in many, many, many, many, many ways.
LEADFEMALE:Butcutting off the love supply is by far the cruelest rejection of them all.
SUPMALE:I didn't cut off the love supply.
LEADMALE:She cut me off.
LEADMALE:Uh, bottom line is, it's laundry day, and i don't see us throwing any sheets in the machine.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, i appreciate your concern, but we can take care of it.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, as you see, i've got a lot of laundry to do.
LEADMALE:Well, before you worry about cleaning up the rest of the house, i'd straighten things out in the bedroom.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, i got a lot of work to do.
LEADFEMALE:Danshe thinks you don't find her attractive, and she's blaming herself.
SUPFEMALE:Can you watch the kids for me, and would you put that on warm/cold? Yeah, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i will move to boston.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, rosie.
SUPMALE:Get the lady a white russian, please? can i get a beer when you get a chance? My name's tony.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in no hurry.
LEADMALE:Do you have i.
LEADMALE:D.
SUPFEMALE:? Think i left it out by my harley.
LEADMALE:I can get it if you want.
LEADMALE:Quick.
LEADMALE:What year were you born? Uhuhuh'68.
LEADMALE:Ok, you'll pass.
LEADFEMALE:Nice place you got here.
OTHERFEMALE:Tony, huh? Well, actually, it's anthony, but the guys that owe me money call me tony.
LEADMALE:Mind if i ask your name? It's amelia.
LEADFEMALE:Amelia.
LEADMALE:That's a very pretty name.
OTHERFEMALE:It's millie for short.
LEADFEMALE:Millie.
LEADMALE:That's nice.
SUPFEMALE:That's nice, too.
LEADFEMALE:This is a nice town, millie.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it kind of grows on you-you know, like mold.
LEADMALE:I like it here.
LEADMALE:You're not from here? Actually, this is my first time in the area.
LEADFEMALE:What do you do? A little bit of everything.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:One of those international banker/ neurosurgeon/ test pilot/cowboy kind of guys, huh? Basically.
SUPFEMALE:You're out kind of late for a working man.
LEADMALE:Well, when you want something, you got to make sacrifices.
SUPMALE:You going to stay long? Well, i was thinking about hitting the road soon, but, uhi might be changing my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Changing my ways.
LEADMALE:Changing my style.
LEADMALE:Changing my life.
LEADFEMALE:Changing your shorts.
LEADFEMALE:You got a nice smile.
LEADMALE:And you have the warmest, most beautiful eyes i've ever seen in my life.
SUPMALE:Really? you know how when you meet somebody, suddenly you feel very close to them, as if you'd known them your whole life? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Do you believe in love at first sight? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ever happen to you? No, but i'm only 20.
LEADFEMALE:Ever happen to you? Yes.
SUPMALE:When? About three minutes ago.
LEADFEMALE:You flirting with me? I'm trying.
LEADMALE:Well, keep going.
SUPMALE:What time you get off work? Bar closes at 2:00.
LEADMALE:Scram, joe.
LEADMALE:I thought you said you was married.
OTHERMALE:I am married.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you, too, dan.
LEADMALE:I want to be with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold that thought.
LEADMALE:You're on your own, lizzie.
OTHERMALE:I need to be with you.
SUPMALE:Are we parked close? Real close.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Do you want to come home with me? Give me a break.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:You don't own the world, butt face.
OTHERMALE:It's my room, too! Just wait till mom gets home.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky: i'm trembling, darlene! hey! Well, if you're gonna kicking me out of my own room, at least give me my sweatshirt and sneakers.
LEADMALE:Here! And my basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Here! quit yelling! i'm watching geraldo! you shut up! ow! You're such a baby.
LEADMALE:Dad, you're home! yeah, so are you! Dad, darlene threw a sneaker at me.
OTHERMALE:Darlene, what's the matter with you? I know.
OTHERMALE:I missed him.
LEADMALE:I shouldn't have rushed the throw.
OTHERMALE:Look at this mess.
LEADFEMALE:You better get that picked up before your mom gets home.
LEADFEMALE:Where am i gonna put it? I can't get in my room.
OTHERMALE:Why not? The queen of the universe locked me out.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, open that door.
SUPMALE:And before she locked me out, she pushed me out of the room.
LEADMALE:I mean, if i wasn't so athletically gifted, i might have fallen down the stairs.
OTHERMALE:Hi, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, dad.
SUPMALE:Where you going? Out.
SUPMALE:Hey, you be home in time for supper! I thought she was grounded.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, now you got your room back.
LEADMALE:Now clean this up.
SUPMALE:Hi, babe.
LEADMALE:How was your day? Great.
OTHERMALE:Some kid called me sir.
LEADFEMALE:I told my boss i'm not wearing that hat again.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene, will you help me set the table, please? It's not my night.
SUPMALE:It's becky's night.
OTHERFEMALE:Shall i call her? Yeah, get her down here.
LEADMALE:Becky! Oh, that's right.
LEADMALE:She's out.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean she's out? As in not home.
OTHERFEMALE:Words "at the mall.
SUPMALE:" i told her to be home by supper.
LEADFEMALE:You let her go? She's grounded, dan.
SUPFEMALE:She is? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess i've been naughty.
LEADMALE:It's not funny.
LEADFEMALE:No kidding.
LEADFEMALE:She locked me out of my room.
SUPFEMALE:Well, she is only human.
SUPFEMALE:And practically threw me down the stairs.
LEADFEMALE:See, that's why she's grounded-'cause she's acting awful, and her attitude stinks.
SUPMALE:Plus, she's not even here to set the table, and it is her night.
SUPMALE:But i'd be happy to do it.
OTHERMALE:Because, hey, whatever's good for my family is good for me.
LEADMALE:Just set the table, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Suck up.
LEADFEMALE:It's 20 to 7:00, dan.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Say, is there any of that, um, bread? Yes, there is.
LEADFEMALE:Is that your subtle way of asking me to bring you the bread? Sorry, babe.
LEADMALE:Didn't mean to be subtle.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you have any milk? Not anymore, but there's some in the fridge.
LEADMALE:Nice, elsie.
SUPFEMALE:Why, if it isn't becky conner, long-lost daughter of dan and roseanne conner.
SUPMALE:Ha ha.
LEADMALE:So kind of you to join us.
LEADFEMALE:Is this supposed to be dinner? No, this is the cocktail hour before dinner.
SUPFEMALE:These beans are totally lifeless, mother.
LEADFEMALE:If you'd steam them instead of boiling them, they might be edible.
OTHERFEMALE:Is there a problem? No.
LEADFEMALE:Where were you, becky? Hanging out.
LEADFEMALE:Chicken.
SUPFEMALE:Coming at you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you weren't hanging out here, which is where you're supposed to be hanging out 'cause you're grounded, remember? Let's see what she'll come up with now.
LEADMALE:Ha ha! I forgot, ok? I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Hey, how about losing the attitude, huh? Now, i asked you where you were, and i want an answer.
LEADMALE:Mom's waiting, rebecca.
LEADFEMALE:Butt out, darlene.
LEADMALE:Any answer.
OTHERMALE:Come on, lie to me.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have to know where i am every moment of my life? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I was at the mall, ok? I got off the bus, walked directly into rodbell's, where i met diane and sammi.
LEADFEMALE:We 3 stood near the entrance to theaters, goofed on some mall cop named renaldo, split some fries, and came home.
LEADFEMALE:Is that specific enough? who paid for the fries? Now watch me be specific.
SUPMALE:Thanks to that nasty, snotty attitude of yours, you get to spend another on the second floor of 714 delaware street.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:You are not gonna ground me for another-you want to push it for 2? You're so weak.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i don't know what's gotten into you lately-hey, i don't want to hear it.
LEADMALE:Hey! You apologize to your mother.
SUPMALE:You're being totally unfair just 'cause i don't want to eat your stinkin' beans! Wrong.
LEADMALE:I am being totally unfair because that is my job! Now you sit down and have a nice dinner with your family.
SUPMALE:I hate you.
SUPMALE:Hey! I say disown her.
LEADMALE:Hey, geeky, why are you in such a mood? You wouldn't understand.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, it's getting old.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, who asked you? No one asked me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you.
LEADMALE:You're really hurting mom's feelings, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Next time you sound off at her, i'm gonna punch your face in.
LEADMALE:Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, pudge.
LEADFEMALE:I'll hit you 3 times before you even touch me.
SUPFEMALE:Go to bed.
LEADMALE:I don't want to go to bed.
SUPMALE:Darlene, give me back my covers.
OTHERMALE:What covers? ow! ow! ow! You really think mom's upset? You know she is.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:She deserves it.
SUPMALE:For what, butt nose? For treating me all the time like i'm a little kid.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she treats me like i'm your age.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but at least she lets me go out.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but you always have to tell her where you're going and what time you'll be back.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, don't you ever get sick of that? that's why you're being so mean? I'm just tired of her running my life for me.
LEADMALE:Darlene, i'm packing you turkey with no mayo, exactly as requested, and i expect you to eat it.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, we got bacon here.
SUPFEMALE:I always eat my lunch.
LEADMALE:I do everything my mommy says.
SUPMALE:I need snack money.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, i need money for a new bus card.
LEADFEMALE:How about you, becky? I'm giving out cash here.
LEADMALE:You need some? Money, money, money.
SUPFEMALE:All you got to do is ask.
SUPMALE:Oh, somebody's still mad at me.
LEADFEMALE:Not me.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:So becky guess you won't be going out with jimmy this weekend.
OTHERFEMALE:Shut up, darlene.
OTHERMALE:Ow! Hey, darlene, knock it off and go to school.
SUPMALE:It's ok.
LEADMALE:I'm sure there are plenty of girls who will be happy to go out with him.
SUPMALE:Maybe even a hot-looking senior with low self-esteem.
LEADFEMALE:Is there coffee? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Becky, would you like more juice? Hey, princess.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she's not talking, dan.
LEADMALE:Is that right? Good morning, dad.
LEADMALE:Oh, i stand corrected.
SUPMALE:She's not talking to me.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like.
LEADFEMALE:She's mad at me.
SUPFEMALE:Looks like.
LEADFEMALE:Can i have my allowance? It's an honor to have you on the payroll.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Becky, you know what this silent treatment does to me, don't you? It just makes me want to talk more.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, it makes me want to talk constantly until you have no choice but to-she's coming around.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like.
SUPMALE:I want to thank you, dan, for letting her go out after i grounded her.
OTHERFEMALE:That way, i'm the bad guy, and you get to be the hero again.
SUPMALE:Aw, come on, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:She's just trying to get a rise out of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Ignore it.
SUPMALE:She's been trying to get a rise out of me for the past month.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? dan, where have you been? She's hardly ever home, and when she is, she's locked up in her room.
LEADMALE:She only comes down to yak on the phone or to give me grief.
LEADFEMALE:Great caesar's ghost.
LEADFEMALE:She's acting like a 14-year-old.
LEADFEMALE:She's obviously going through something, and she's not even talking about it.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just try backing off a little bit? Well, maybe i can pump darlene for some information when she comes home from school today.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:My worst fears have finally come true.
LEADFEMALE:She's turned into her mother.
SUPFEMALE:I have not.
SUPMALE:And don't you ever say that to me again.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, bev.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, i mean it.
LEADMALE:Kind of touchy, aren't you? say, your mom's pretty much the same way, isn't she? You're giving me a heartburn.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
LEADMALE:Say, doesn't your mom get heartburn? Becky, i want to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, open this door.
LEADMALE:Becky? Open the door.
OTHERMALE:Turn that down, becky.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to talk to you! becky, open the door! Becky, i'm going to count 5, and if you don't open the door, i'm gonna get the screwdriver and take it off the hinges.
LEADFEMALE:I'm counting now.
LEADMALE:I'm counting, becky.
OTHERFEMALE:You hear me counting? All right.
SUPFEMALE:All right, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:I'm serious, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Where's that screwdriver? Roseanne, you're not taking the door off the hinges.
LEADMALE:It's ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i counted to 5.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, 6 actually, 'cause i did 4 1/2.
SUPFEMALE:Would you listen to yourself? I'm more worried about you than i am about becky.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm worried about me, too.
SUPMALE:She's driving me crazy! I tried joking with her.
SUPFEMALE:I tried yelling at her.
LEADFEMALE:I even tried being reasonable, but she still won't say one word to me.
SUPMALE:A real battle for power.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and i'm losing.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you're not taking that door off.
SUPFEMALE:All right, then you go up and you talk to her.
SUPMALE:This is between you and becky.
LEADMALE:Bringing me into it is just gonna make it seem like i'm on your side.
LEADMALE:Which--which i am.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:You're neutral as usual.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan switzerland conner.
LEADMALE:You just don't want to get involved because she still thinks you're mr.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADMALE:Did she tell you that? You're making way too big a deal out of this.
LEADFEMALE:You watch too much oprah.
SUPMALE:What, do you think she's up in her room having sex with the guys that take down the tilt-a-whirl? There is obviously something wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where is that damn screwdriver? In the garage.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:You gonna help me take that door off or not? Not.
SUPMALE:Good, then i'll just do it myself.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:And if you can't do anything to help me with your own damn kids, then i don't have one thing left to say to you.
LEADMALE:So, deej what did you do after you got to timmy's house? Played in his basement.
OTHERFEMALE:Nok-hockey? Yep.
LEADFEMALE:You cheat? Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Did you beat him? Yep.
SUPFEMALE:See? Darlene, ask your father to please pass me the toast.
LEADFEMALE:Father, will you pass the toast to mother, please? Tell mother i received her request, and i'm shipping the toast out on the next arm.
SUPFEMALE:Why, there's one leaving now.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. : what's going on? You got me.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, what's going on? We're playing a game.
SUPFEMALE:Can i play? No, you're too mature to play this game.
OTHERFEMALE:How come it's so quiet? Eat your breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, can i go meet diane after breakfast? did you do your chores? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Gee, darlene, i guess you'll be doing the dishes for becky again since she's going out.
LEADMALE:No way! Becky, you're not sticking me with the dishes again.
SUPMALE:So i'll do them when i get home.
LEADMALE:Well, why don't you do them before you leave? 'cause i can do them when i get home.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the difference? Because i said so.
OTHERFEMALE:You're only making me do them because she stuck her nose in, and you just always do whatever she says.
SUPMALE:Becky, i believe you're mistaken about that.
LEADMALE:Ah, i can see that room becoming more and more mine.
LEADFEMALE:You always back in to her.
OTHERMALE:Everybody does.
LEADFEMALE:But i'm not gonna let her.
OTHERMALE:She can't control me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, i can.
OTHERFEMALE:I am your mother, and will control you till the day you die.
LEADMALE:I wasn't talking to you! oh, yes, you were! Just then, she was talking to me.
LEADMALE:Wasn't she, dan? you talking to me? That's when the door would have slammed if we still had a door.
LEADMALE:Steve thought that having julia around would make it easier on joanne because joanne worries so much about him being a cop.
LEADFEMALE:But then, when he was seeing that swedish chick, she never worried at all 'cause you know how icy those nordic types are.
LEADFEMALE:Is that what you guys do all day? sit there in your patrol car and discuss your personal problems? He's my partner, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:He's going through some rough stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Steve's very torn.
LEADFEMALE:I want my taxes back.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh, what are you doing? I'm cleaning.
SUPFEMALE:Cleaning? yeah, what does it look like i'm doing? Looks like you're snooping.
LEADFEMALE:The girls will come home to an entirely reordered room and never quite know if anything was touched because clearly, everything was touched.
LEADFEMALE:Mom used to do that.
LEADMALE:I am not snooping.
OTHERMALE:I am cleaning.
LEADFEMALE:And i am not mom.
SUPMALE:Planning on cleaning her diary? I was thinking about it.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, don't you-remember when mom did that to you? Good for you.
LEADMALE:I thought i had a handle on my kids, but becky's turned into a total stranger.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just looking for clues, you know? So she's not talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:Big deal.
LEADMALE:I didn't talk to mom for a month.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, and she went stark raving mad.
SUPFEMALE:You're the one that told me to do it.
SUPMALE:So, see? Becky's no different than we were.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, she is, and the times we're living in are completely different.
LEADFEMALE:Anyways, what would you know about it? You're not even a mom.
LEADFEMALE:When are you gonna quit throwing that up to me? When your water breaks.
LEADMALE:Will you help me flip this one? Aha! Now this this is becky's diary.
LEADFEMALE:You think that's like the x-rated version? If she's having any fun at all, it is.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think she's got written in there? Stuff she doesn't want you to see.
OTHERMALE:Stuff about you.
LEADFEMALE:Stuff about sex.
SUPMALE:Same stuff you used to write in your diary.
LEADMALE:How do you know what i used to write in my diary? Because i read it.
LEADFEMALE:You did not.
SUPMALE:I did, too.
LEADMALE:And i quote-"dear lord, help me stop doing you know what.
LEADFEMALE:" well, i read your diary, too.
LEADMALE:No, you didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i did so.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? so where did i keep it? It doesn't matter.
SUPMALE:I read it.
LEADMALE:You don't know where i kept it.
SUPMALE:And i didn't just read it.
LEADFEMALE:Mom read it, too.
LEADMALE:She used to come in there and read it right out loud and go, "is this true? is this true?" my scarlet diary? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:I never had a scarlet diary! ha ha ha ha! ow! So you going to read it? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Then i really would be mom.
SUPMALE:I don't know what to do.
LEADMALE:She's 14, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Are vile, testy, snarling, secretive beasts.
OTHERMALE:Becky's perfectly normal.
SUPMALE:You have to give her some privacy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah with mom, nothing was ever secret.
LEADFEMALE:She used to force her way in, steal information, and use it against us.
LEADFEMALE:Beverlygate.
OTHERMALE:There are some things you don't need to know.
OTHERMALE:Well, how did you get so smart? Reading your diary.
LEADMALE:Can i come in? Dinner's gonna be ready in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
SUPFEMALE:Will you go set the table for me? I guess you want to sit up here and talk to yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Go.
SUPMALE:Going.
SUPMALE:I'll leave it open.
OTHERMALE:I was in here doing some cleaning today, and i came across your diary.
LEADMALE:Well, diaries.
LEADMALE:I didn't read it, though.
LEADFEMALE:I almost did, but then i thought, i don't want to violate my kids' privacy the way my mom violated mine.
OTHERFEMALE:So i put it back under the mattress.
LEADFEMALE:So what do you want, a prize? Thanks, you just gave me one.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i just guess i hoped that me and you would have a better relationship than i got with my mom.
LEADMALE:So here's my peace offering.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i guess i don't understand everything you're going through, but then again, i don't think you understand everything i'm going through, either.
LEADMALE:So i'm giving you back your door 'cause that's the way i'd want to be treated.
LEADFEMALE:So here's your door.
SUPFEMALE:You can keep it closed whenever you want to.
LEADFEMALE:And sometimes, i hope you'll open it up and let me in.
LEADFEMALE:But no pressure.
OTHERMALE:Darlene: we can't go to the movies 'cause you're still grounded.
LEADFEMALE:Not anymore.
SUPMALE:Mom let me off the hook.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:I got our door back, didn't i? And we're going to the mall.
LEADMALE:The old silent treatment really worked! To perfection.
SUPMALE:Aunt jackie is so brilliant.
LEADMALE:Mom is never going to pry her way into my life again.
LEADFEMALE:She promised.
SUPMALE:Well, yeah, but now that she's done haunting you, i mean, who do you think she's gonna go after? what about my life? Too bad.
SUPMALE:But it's gonna be a lot easier for you now that i've broken through.
LEADMALE:I mean, i have got mom exactly where i want her.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, i was just cleaning.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I need sneakers, mom! Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:So i'm gonna drop you off at your game a little bit early and then if becky ever finishes the living room, we'll all go down to the budget club and i'll get your sneakers, and i'll pick up that tire for the car.
OTHERMALE:Your game ought to be finished by then.
LEADMALE:Then alls i'll have left to do is go in for my bikini wax.
SUPFEMALE:Give me my paper.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doin'? I am runnin' this house with no help from you.
LEADMALE:And doin' a hell of a job.
SUPMALE:All right, what do you want me to do? You weren't even listening.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i was.
LEADFEMALE:What did i say? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Something about turtle-waxing your bikini.
LEADMALE:Enhhh! I'm sorry, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:I guess that handsome dinette set will have to go to our returning champion.
LEADMALE:Why can't we do all this on sunday? 'cause there's a game on sunday your mom wants to watch.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Becky, plate.
LEADMALE:Honey? feeling a little tense, irritable, peckish? Maybe it's your hair color.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's my job.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you should quit that job.
LEADFEMALE:And do what? All the power jobs are taken.
LEADFEMALE:Margaret's running england, vanna's turnin' the letters over, and delta burke has her own damn tv show.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna be late tonight? No.
LEADFEMALE:I only got a half day's worth of finishing work to do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i gotta go, because i got a staff meeting, and my boss freaks out if anybody's late.
LEADMALE:You mind gettin' dinner tonight? Ok.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:What do i gotta do? Well, you stand up and then you go over here and take the stuff out of this cold box.
SUPFEMALE:Brr! And then you trot it right over here and you stick it in this hot box.
SUPMALE:What was that middle part again? pick up a gross of bowling balls on the way home, will ya? And another thing, uniforms.
LEADFEMALE:Starch those apron bows, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Wash them every day and get your moms to iron them.
LEADMALE:Oh, i have a question.
SUPMALE:What if your mom has really bad rheumatoid arthritis, you know? and, uh, say she's, like, living on the other side of the international date line, you know? then should you, like, get your kids to do it? I don't care, like, who does it, but we have gotta start looking like professionals or no one's gonna take us seriously.
SUPFEMALE:Um, the beak keeps falling off my apron.
OTHERMALE:And let's perk up the customers, all right? They eat more.
LEADMALE:"theyeatmore.
LEADMALE:" he's takin' notes.
LEADMALE:Since i thought of having the feedback box put in-yeah? Gotten a lot of disturbing complaints about the fries.
LEADMALE:"oily and no taste.
LEADMALE:" oh, no, that was about the owners.
LEADMALE:Manager: now so far, the biggest complaint we've had is speed-people waiting now, this is supposed to be fast food, people, and we can't exactly call it fast.
SUPMALE:Why not? We call it food.
LEADMALE:Look the bottom line here is that some of you are just not playing to capacity which means i've had to do some platooning and juggle the schedule a bit.
OTHERMALE:So, jay, wednesdays and fridays, you're on nights.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, brian, man.
LEADMALE:All right, andrew and debbie, mondays and thursdays, you open.
SUPMALE:I, uh--i do have a big math test on monday, but i--i will be here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, roseanne, you're off on wednesday, but you're here on saturday.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Let's open.
SUPFEMALE:Now, remember, perky! Um, brian remember we had this discussion? I can't work on weekends because i have a family.
OTHERMALE:Well, this is a family, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but it ain't my family.
SUPFEMALE:Look, roseanne, weekends are what it's all about, and i need somebody fast.
LEADMALE:Well, i can be flexible.
SUPMALE:I could slow down.
OTHERMALE:Look, i'm gonna tell you something right now, all right? That negative attitude of yours, it's gonna get you nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:This is nowhere.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't like working weekends, either.
LEADMALE:I know, and that's why you never do.
LEADMALE:You just sit up there in your office like a little chicken napoleon, making your little chicken schedules that screw up everybody's life.
LEADMALE:I told you in the beginning i was not workin' weekends.
LEADFEMALE:You are paid to follow my orders.
SUPFEMALE:Now, it isn't always pretty, but this is the business we've chosen.
LEADMALE:You got a big booger hangin' out of your nose.
LEADFEMALE:Is this moisturizer any good? Everything i got is good.
SUPFEMALE:That's one of my big sellers.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you know? I'm gonna ask for a second district.
LEADFEMALE:Really? That's great.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, roseanne, i like this prussian blue.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That will look great with your cop uniform.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, did i tell you? My t.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:Let me take the collar on a d.
OTHERMALE:W.
LEADMALE:I.
LEADMALE:N.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:They usually don't let rookies take the collar.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:How about you, roseanne, how's your job goin'? Sometimes i wish i was still back at wellman, i swear.
LEADFEMALE:Bite your tongue.
LEADMALE:And now he's gonna make me work weekends.
SUPMALE:You're kidding! Have you talked to him and told him how you feel? Well, of course you have.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, you should quit that job.
LEADFEMALE:And do what, go back into medicine? Now, i'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:Have you really tried talking to him? You know, butter him up, turn on the old charm.
LEADMALE:Hey, i'm not kissing up to some dweeby little kid just 'cause he holds my life in his hands.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to kiss up to him.
LEADMALE:Just treat him a little better.
LEADFEMALE:You know how to do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, like not calling him "the little maggot.
LEADMALE:" believe me, roseanne, i wouldn't be where i am today if i didn't know how to handle people.
LEADMALE:Truth is, roseanne, you could use some work on your interpersonal relationships.
SUPMALE:Stick it.
SUPFEMALE:She's an expert on interpersonal relationships.
LEADMALE:She's raising 3 kids.
LEADFEMALE:Just imagine brian as one of your kids.
LEADMALE:Jackie, laughing: i'm serious.
LEADMALE:You know how to handle that guy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:You're the most manipulative person i know.
LEADFEMALE:No, i mean really.
SUPFEMALE:You know, up until this weekend thing, that job was workin' out pretty good.
LEADMALE:I was able to be home before d.j. got here.
LEADFEMALE:It was this close to being bearable.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPFEMALE:Big powwow in the hen house.
LEADMALE:Get in here.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, a threesome! You wish.
SUPFEMALE:How was your day? You won't believe.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man, so i unloaded the rest of that sheet rock on eddie griswold.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we're talkin' about me now.
SUPFEMALE:You know brian? the little maggot? He's gonna make me work weekends.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you tell him you couldn't? oh, gee, now, why didn't i think of that? We were just suggesting that she use her natural abilities and suck up to the guy.
LEADFEMALE:You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, a meeting of minds.
SUPMALE:That's good advice, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:That's how careers are made.
SUPFEMALE:Just treat the guy like you respect him and, uh, act like you think he's great, and keep your real feelings to yourself.
SUPMALE:Oh, you mean, uh, i should treat him like he's my husband? Bingo.
LEADFEMALE:You just treat him like you treat me, and i guarantee you he won't wanna be anywhere near you on weekends.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm so bad at making decisions.
LEADMALE:Do you have anything that's low-cholesterol? Napkins.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I'll take the number 2 dinner.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Number 4.
LEADMALE:No, wait.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Do you need some more time to make up your mind? You know, that way i could go ahead and wait on this guy behind you who's drooling all over your shoulder.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, ok.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'll order now.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Ok no.
LEADMALE:I'll order now.
SUPFEMALE:What would you recommend? Psychotherapy.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the chicken dainty platter.
SUPMALE:What the heck, you only live once, right? yeah, and why drag it out? Roseanne, go ahead and clear out your register.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, brian.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, your mustang is looking awesome.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, it's a classic.
SUPMALE:Oh, for sure.
LEADMALE:Have a nice day, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Please come again.
LEADFEMALE:Um, you know, if you ever need that little beauty washed, uh, my dad does run the jack-o-wash, and all my friends get in for free.
LEADMALE:They use rags or brushes? Well, anything you want.
SUPMALE:Just say you're a friend of mine andrew.
LEADMALE:That's good to know.
LEADMALE:I'll keep it in mind.
LEADFEMALE:No sweat, guy.
LEADFEMALE:He's such a suck-up.
LEADFEMALE:Brian? If i stay late tonight to do side work, i'm gonna be into overtime for the week, and you told me to always let you know.
OTHERFEMALE:So, is that ok? 'cause i could really use the extra money.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Go home.
OTHERMALE:Have a good night.
SUPMALE:Andrew, you feel like working some overtime? Cool.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Clean out the fry bins.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, you can head out, too.
LEADMALE:Well, don't feel bad, tina.
LEADMALE:It's not worth acting like andrew just to get your own car.
SUPMALE:That's for sure.
LEADFEMALE:'course, unless you've got a husband and 3 kids.
OTHERFEMALE:That's for sure.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I guess you can catch more flies with manure than you can with honey.
LEADMALE:Damn it! what? i can't fasten the choke spring! What--what are you makin'? do you know anything about carburetors? They go under the hood.
OTHERMALE:Why? I'm in big trouble.
SUPMALE:What's the matter? I'm flunking shop.
SUPMALE:Well, that's a sign of intelligence.
LEADMALE:I can't afford to flunk shop.
LEADFEMALE:'cause if my grade point average falls below 3.
SUPMALE:5, then the school won't let me keep my job and if i lose my job, i lose my car and if i lose my car, i'm nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i don't mean to drop names or nothin', but i just happen to know the best carburetor man in town.
LEADMALE:I don't suppose he owes you a favor? Yeah, about 15 years worth boss.
SUPFEMALE:Brian kamen is coming here for dinner? Doofy brian kamen?! No, mr.
SUPMALE:Brian kamen, my boss.
LEADFEMALE:Why is he eating here? He has parents.
LEADMALE:'cause your dad's gonna help him with something.
LEADMALE:With what, a zit? And we're just going to happen to have his favorite dinner on the table, too.
LEADMALE:What's his favorite dinner? Wieners.
LEADFEMALE:Even the flat-heads don't hang out with him.
OTHERFEMALE:Where is your brother? He's playing hide-and-go-seek.
LEADMALE:With who? With you.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Where's he hiding? I'm not gonna tell you.
LEADMALE:Well, i sure hope i'm gonna be able to find him before we have dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, i wonder where he--david jacob, i see you.
LEADMALE:You're it! Now you hide.
LEADFEMALE:No, you go hide for me 'cause you are so good at bein' it.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hi, sis.
LEADFEMALE:How you doin'? Pretty good.
LEADMALE:My! Expecting company? As a matter of fact, i am.
LEADMALE:Anybody good? No.
SUPMALE:What a laugh you'll have when i tell you.
LEADMALE:Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me.
LEADFEMALE:My boss.
LEADFEMALE:The little maggot? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Well, very good, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm very proud of you.
OTHERMALE:What time is he comin' over? He'll be here in about a half-hour.
SUPFEMALE:Plenty of time for you to eat and get out of here before he comes up.
LEADMALE:Oh, i can stay.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't go on duty till 8:00.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want you to see me grovel.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:Let me stick around for the initial greasing.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:You'll just make everything worse.
LEADFEMALE:How do i make it worse? With that great knack you have for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dan's gonna be here, and you're always saying how tactless he is.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, jackie.
OTHERMALE:How's the herpes? did you get good chips? Yeah.
LEADMALE:2 6-packs of bailey's old-style root beer.
LEADMALE:Where's d.j. ? I'll look for him later.
LEADMALE:I think you're going way overboard on this deal.
SUPMALE:Isn't it enough that i have to rebuild junior's carburetor for him? are you kiddin' me? You're the one that told me to kiss up to the guy in the first place.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't tell you to kiss up to him.
OTHERMALE:I just said treat him right.
LEADMALE:Oh, please, you've gotta let me stick around and watch this.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, go to work.
SUPMALE:And he better bring his own tools, 'cause he's not usin' mine.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, he can use anything he wants as long as i don't have to work on saturday.
OTHERFEMALE:Would somebody let the little maggot in?! Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hope i'm not late.
LEADMALE:I came right from the office.
LEADMALE:Let me take your coat for ya, huh? Oh, thanks.
SUPMALE:You look familiar.
LEADMALE:Yeah? you go to lanford, right? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Fifth period lunch, right? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:How you doin'? Dan conner.
SUPFEMALE:Husband, father, carburetor specialist.
LEADMALE:Oh, i really appreciate-come on out to the garage.
LEADMALE:You can hear the dinner bell from there.
SUPMALE:You know, i got as far as putting on the choke spring, but i didn't know what to do after that, coming over here was a good start.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's the truth.
SUPFEMALE:Look, uh can we talk man-to-man here, pal? Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Well, here's the deal i don't wanna be a shop teacher, and you don't wanna be a garage mechanic.
LEADFEMALE:So, why don't you just let me put this thing together for you, you take it in, you get the credit, and you ease up on my wife.
SUPMALE:I have never come on to your wife.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Um but what i was talking about was making her work weekends.
LEADMALE:Look, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, i have a job to do.
SUPFEMALE:Whoops! Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Fumble-thumbs! Parts everywhere.
SUPMALE:Roseanne's the best person i got down there.
LEADMALE:Really, that's-that's the only reason i want her working on the weekends.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we need her to work here on weekends.
SUPMALE:Schedules can be changed.
SUPMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:I could've had a new car right away, but when i saw my stinger, ohh it was like falling in love.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so that's what falling in love is like.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, dear.
LEADFEMALE:It's like car ownership.
LEADMALE:Yep.
SUPFEMALE:So i waited.
SUPMALE:I saved up for an entire year, and now i am the owner of one lean, mean driving machine.
SUPMALE:And the women go wild for it.
LEADMALE:More milk? Actually, i should get going.
SUPMALE:Already? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Uh thanks for dinner, though.
LEADMALE:It was really nice meeting all of you.
LEADMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:A million thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You're keeping the, uh, kamen legend alive.
LEADMALE:Don't mention it.
LEADMALE:Um, brian, uh, i really do need to talk to you about work.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i think my office is the place for that.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, let's just go step into my office, huh? It won't take long.
LEADMALE:I just wanted you to see, you know, how important my family is and how important it is we're together, 'cause weekends are the only time that we have together.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne i mean, i wanna be a team player and all like that, you know, but my family's really important to me, too.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i understand that you need to be with your family.
LEADMALE:You do? Yeah, and you can't work weekends.
LEADMALE:That's what you're saying, right? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Exactly.
SUPMALE:Well, there it is.
LEADFEMALE:You can pick up your last check on monday.
LEADMALE:What?! You're fired.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell's wrong with you, bub? what the hell's wrong with you? You been in this house 3 hours, you couldn't say something about this-hey, now, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you wait a minute, pal! What's the matter with you? I had to do your homework for you, and now you fire-dan, please.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, now just slow down.
SUPMALE:Now, you're firing me over this weekend thing, right? i mean, you're really firing me? Hey, i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You're sorry? You're gonna be sorry, 'cause i'm the best worker you've got down there.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You're fast, but your attitude stinks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, something stinks in here, bri, but it ain't my attitude.
LEADMALE:Listen, kid, i need that job, and i hate like hell that i do, but i need it.
OTHERFEMALE:And i'm not workin' there because i don't have enough allowance.
LEADFEMALE:I'm paying a mortgage and puttin' food on the table and buying clothes for 3 kids.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you even understand that.
LEADMALE:I don't think you understand anything.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not, uh, grown-up enough yet to understand that your life doesn't always turn out the way you plan it to be, and sometimes you end up doing stuff that you thought you'd never do in a million years, but you still have to do it 'cause there's nothing else you can do.
LEADMALE:Oh, you don't wanna leave without your carburetor and your coil spring.
LEADMALE:And here's your butterfly valve.
OTHERFEMALE:And don't forget your secondaries.
LEADMALE:Brian would you like fries with that? Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:It's an occasion.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I've definitely sunk to an all-time new low.
LEADMALE:I've been fired by opie.
SUPMALE:Well, let's look at it this way.
LEADMALE:Kid's a loser.
OTHERFEMALE:By the time he's our age, he'll be a lonely, bitter multimillionaire.
LEADMALE:I pity him.
OTHERFEMALE:Well you'll definitely have more time to spend with your family now.
SUPFEMALE:Cozy evenings around the hearth sing-alongs.
SUPMALE:It'll be loads of fun.
SUPMALE:Hmm.
LEADMALE:Yeah, till we have to break down and eat one of the children.
LEADMALE:We're ok.
LEADFEMALE:I been workin' a lot.
LEADMALE:I got stuff lined up.
LEADFEMALE:You'll find something, something better.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i've been thinking about a career in diplomacy.
SUPMALE:I think that's definitely your calling.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe an ambassadorship.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:To the bahamas.
SUPMALE:Oh, there's loads of unrest down there.
LEADMALE:They'll need somebody who can lay on the beach and drink margaritas.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:And just imagine all the gala luncheons, the parties, the dances i hear they're hiring over at bucky burger.
SUPMALE:Captioned by the national d.j. ! Nothing? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , bedtime! game's over, son! He's not in the garage.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think he's in the house.
LEADMALE:Well, he's gotta be somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe we ought to call somebody.
SUPFEMALE:Dan you're it.
SUPMALE:Well, we're gonna be at grandma's by 2:00 unless we get really lucky and we get into a head-on collision.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't it be great if the roads were closed and we couldn't get through? I'll go get some road snacks.
LEADMALE:Ok, becky, i left grandma's number on the cork board and if darlene ain't home by 4:30, i want you to give me a call.

LEADFEMALE:I can't help it, mom.
LEADMALE:The paper's due next week.
LEADMALE:How come you're not bringing the girls? Well, you know, i don't like exposing them to mom too often.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of like radiation.
SUPMALE:Let's go! where are you goin'? To get the coffee! I'm gonna go make a pit stop.
LEADFEMALE:So, you guys try not to burn the house down, huh? And don't go anywhere without calling grandma, don't leave the lights on in every room, turn the heat down if you do leave, and the chocolate pudding in the little cans is off-limits 'cause they're for d.j. 's lunch.

LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Now, you know where we are.
OTHERMALE:So far, you're still here.
OTHERFEMALE:See you later.
LEADMALE:Yes! they're gone! So where do you wanna work, the kitchen or the living room? how about the mall? Well, it's more comfortable in the living room, but the light's better in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Can we hear the stereo? Oh, definitely.
SUPMALE:Good, 'cause i can't study without music.
SUPMALE:My brain stops.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:It's really hard to concentrate on one thing at a time.
LEADFEMALE:Don't think i'm stupid or anything but, like, what is this project about? It's about us, women in the nineties.
LEADFEMALE:Women of the nineties or women in the nineties? I think it's women in the nineties.
OTHERFEMALE:'cause it's kind of a future thing.
LEADMALE:But wouldn't women in the nineties mean, like, old women? No, that would be women in their nineties.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, so then we're getting into a grammar thing.
LEADFEMALE:So let's forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, here's something we can use.
SUPFEMALE:A woman in a hard hat doing construction.
LEADMALE:I like those jeans she's wearing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you know, they have those at rodbell's.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't mind being a model.
LEADMALE:You stand around all day looking perfect, and you get paid a fortune.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you can't eat anything, 'cause you get fat.
SUPMALE:And you can't stay out late, 'cause you get bags under your eyes.
LEADMALE:Really.
SUPMALE:If i were a model, i guess i'd have to become less of a party animal.
SUPMALE:Oh, right.
SUPMALE:Like you're a real party animal.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i've had beer.
OTHERMALE:When? Wrigley field.
LEADMALE:That doesn't count.
LEADFEMALE:You were with your dad.
SUPMALE:Ok billy sperry.
SUPMALE:Get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:I had beer with him once.
OTHERFEMALE:How much? More than you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but i bet you've never had a tornado.
LEADMALE:No, but i've heard of them.
SUPMALE:They're awesome.
LEADMALE:You ever had one? No, but i think i know how to make one.
SUPFEMALE:Wanna try one? Oh, i don't know.
SUPMALE:What's in it? Everything, and juice.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:I think we're out of juice.
OTHERMALE:Well, can't you use soda? You're a genius.
LEADMALE:Ok, it's 1:00 now.
LEADFEMALE:How long do we wanna work, considering this isn't due for 2 weeks? Yeah.
SUPMALE:We still have next weekend.
SUPMALE:How 'bout we work till 3:00, then get to the mall where we belong? It's a plan.
SUPFEMALE:A-are you gonna have any? Yeah.

LEADMALE:It's scary.
OTHERMALE:Check this out.
LEADFEMALE:This is what my parents call "trippy.
LEADFEMALE:" ok, so get back to jimmy.

LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna talk about him.
OTHERFEMALE:Down the toilet! becky hmm? are you aware this room is moving? You're plowed! these are great! Told you.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? what's the matter? The room is moving.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Ain't it great? This music is scaring me.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa-ho-ho! My parents dig all those sounds from before music was invented.
LEADFEMALE:Mine, too.
SUPFEMALE:Have you ever heard of albert herbert? He's from tijuana.
SUPFEMALE:She opens the door, she closes the door.
SUPFEMALE:She turns, she dribbles, she cuts through the key.
LEADMALE:She spins.
LEADFEMALE:It's up! She steals her sister's soda.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! ohh! This stuff tastes like sock sweat.
LEADFEMALE:We're studying.
OTHERFEMALE:How come the liquor cabinet is open? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe the wine had to breathe.
LEADFEMALE:You guys are drunk.
LEADMALE:Mm-mmm.
OTHERMALE:We're just happy.
LEADMALE:This is my sister lardene larlene dardene.
LEADFEMALE:What?! Where's the bathroom? Oh we don't have a bathroom.
LEADMALE:We use a wok.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe he slept the whole way.
SUPMALE:I can't stand it anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Mom just sucks the lifeblood right out of me.
SUPMALE:The next time i go back there is when they come here.
SUPFEMALE:And what was that smell in their house? Guilt.
SUPMALE:Thank god we're back.
SUPMALE:And all of 'em taken from the car.
OTHERMALE:And not one slide in focus.
LEADMALE:And who are all those people? It's like they're trying to create the illusion that they have friends.
LEADMALE:I can't believe she's still buying me clothes.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess it pays to be in the circus when the clown dies.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna need those real big shoes.
LEADFEMALE:How are the girls? Silent.
LEADMALE:Boy, you can hear it across the whole state.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to thank you, honey, for not hitting my mom.

SUPFEMALE:Yeah? did you make your shots? Uh, the first two.
LEADMALE:Then he asked me for my phone number, and i blew the last one.
LEADFEMALE:Psyched you out, huh? I guess.
SUPMALE:Well, you go on to bed now.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:One good frolic in 3 weeks and you're actin' like ben hur.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, i really got that old chariot rockin'.

OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:We have very strange parents, d.j. pull my finger.
LEADMALE:Pull your own finger.
SUPMALE:Hey, what's the big idea of blowin' a foul shot just 'cause some kid wants your phone number? You have such a big mouth.
LEADFEMALE:No, i don't.
SUPFEMALE:Becky! Your grandfather really missed you yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:He said he had a new joke for you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, let me guess.
LEADFEMALE:Teacher says to jimmy, "i see you have a cold.
LEADFEMALE:" jimmy says to the teacher, "can you see it now?" pull my finger! That'd be the one.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:What is the big idea of playin' my records and leavin' 'em like this? I'm talkin' to ya.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I apologize.
LEADMALE:Can i be excused? No! We're not even done eatin' yet.
LEADMALE:Where the hell is your sister? you want me to get her? Yeah.
SUPMALE:That'd be swell.
LEADMALE:Boy, she's being awfully obedient.
LEADMALE:I noticed.
LEADMALE:Don't jump! You ok? I think i'm going to die.
OTHERFEMALE:We're having breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Don't even mention food.
OTHERMALE:What'd you guys drink yesterday anyway? who knows? listen, i don't wanna talk about it, all right? Well, mom wants you down for breakfast.
LEADMALE:If i even look at food, i'm gonna barf.
LEADMALE:Well, what should i tell mom? Just tell her i'm sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her i don't feel well.
LEADFEMALE:So you becomin' a drunk? Darlene, go downstairs.
SUPMALE:You mean for some buttery buckwheat pancakes and sausage? Darlene, shut up! I'm serious.
OTHERMALE:You were so weird yesterday.
LEADMALE:You really scared me.
SUPMALE:I was just goofing with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, i don't want a sister who's a boozer.
LEADFEMALE:It's bad enough i'm gonna have to overcome your nerd legacy.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, you're in seventh grade.
SUPMALE:You don't even know what you're talking about.
SUPFEMALE:Now, just go downstairs and quit bugging me.
LEADMALE:Well, you're not gonna do this again, are you? Look, i'll do--ohh.
LEADMALE:I'll do whatever i feel like doing, you little brat.
LEADMALE:Now beat it.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, ok.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe when i come back up, i'll bring you a little breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe a sausage or 2, so you can bite down on those little hard chunks and maybe a poached egg, slightly undercooked ugh! With that white runny stuff that you can never quite keep on the spoon.
OTHERMALE:Yes! Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Your mom home? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm karen hutson.
OTHERFEMALE:Dana's mom.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm roseanne conner.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:You'll have to excuse the mess, but we live here.
LEADMALE:I'll only take a couple of minutes of your time.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:You know it's hard enough trying to keep an eye on my kid, being by myself here.
SUPFEMALE:I kind of have to count on other parents to help out once in a while.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know what i mean? No, not really.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's really crappy that i let my kid come over here and you guys just leave them alone in the house the whole damn day with an open liquor cabinet.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talkin' about? My kid came home completely bombed yesterday, and she was throwing up half the night.
SUPMALE:Are you saying that my kid got your kid drunk? That's exactly what i'm saying.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky! Go find your dad.
LEADMALE:Where is he? I don't-just go find him.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, would you please get your butt down here?! Well, i'm sorry that your kid came home drunk, but, i mean, if you knew becky at all, you'd know she's-doesn't do stuff like that.
LEADFEMALE:Did you and dana get crocked yesterday? crocked? you mean on liquor? Dana says you were making tornadoes.
LEADFEMALE:We were working on social studies.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe you and dana shouldn't work together anymore.
LEADMALE:I mean, she's been throwing up all night, and you look like you've been reincarnated as a rag.
LEADFEMALE:What's goin' on? Well, i guess we missed some big party right here in our living room yesterday.
SUPMALE:What the hell went on here? did you get in the liquor when you were playing the records? I was playing the records.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Darlene, i thought you said you were playing the records.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah.
OTHERMALE:I mean i got 'em out, but becky was actually playing them.
SUPMALE:Who was the bartender? wasn't it that girl who was over here studying with you? Well, look, i'm sorry i wasn't here to keep an eye on whatever the hell went on here yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, too.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a 14-year-old girl at home with a hangover.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you should go home and take care of her.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you guys should shell out a few bucks and get a lock on that liquor cabinet.
LEADMALE:Thanks, but i think we know how to run our own household.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, don't expect to be seeing my kid around here anymore.
SUPMALE:Becky, get upstairs till we call you back down.
LEADFEMALE:No, i wanna talk.
LEADFEMALE:You sit there.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, get upstairs.
LEADMALE:I think we should talk about this first.
LEADMALE:There's nothing i'm gonna say to you that i can't say to her, and i'm not feelin' real shy right now.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, get back in here and sit down.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell is with you, becky? what, do you look people in the face and then lie to 'em? You've really pushed it too far this time, kiddo.
LEADMALE:The first time we leave you alone in this house and this is what you do? I'm gonna go upstairs and flush the wok.
SUPFEMALE:All right, becky.
LEADMALE:What happened here? And try telling the truth this time.
LEADMALE:Look, it was no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:We had a couple of tornadoes.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's no big deal.
SUPFEMALE:How come you lied? who made them? I made them.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna know right now, is this a new thing or a regular thing? I've never done it before.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that the truth? Yes! what is the problem?! you guys drink all the time! First of all, we don't drink all the time.
LEADMALE:Second of all, we're not talkin' about us! Look, i have one drink and you're acting like i'm an alcoholic.
SUPMALE:Oh, quick, call the 800 number.
OTHERMALE:We are your and if you got a problem, you better tell us about it right now.
SUPMALE:We were bored.
LEADMALE:We were looking for something to do.
SUPFEMALE:You want something to do? Find me! i'll give you something to do! I guess i just wasn't thinking.
OTHERMALE:For god's sake, becky, you're 14 years old! Mom, everything i do, everything i feel, it's always, "well, she's 14.
SUPMALE:" i mean, when you guys do something, people don't go, "oh, well, she's 37.
LEADFEMALE:" whatever.
SUPFEMALE:You know, becky, you're gonna find that when grownups drink, they mostly drink for the wrong reasons.
OTHERMALE:So what are the right reasons? honey? You're grounded.
SUPMALE:Sip that tea and try to eat some of this toast, and you'll feel better.
LEADFEMALE:So, becky, you still bombed? No.
OTHERFEMALE:She's not bombed.
LEADMALE:She just wishes she was dead.
SUPFEMALE:Could everyone be just a little bit quieter? You have no idea how horrible i feel.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, i do.
LEADMALE:You know, i'm not so much bothered by the fact that you took a drink.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you tried it.
LEADFEMALE:You got sick, you got caught.
LEADMALE:You know what that's like.
SUPMALE:What really bugs the hell out of me is that i just can't trust you anymore, and i always thought i could.
OTHERMALE:You blew it big-time.
SUPFEMALE:So, what are you saying? that i have to be chaperoned the rest of my life? Well, you tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Can i not leave you alone in the house anymore? Well, i could watch her.
LEADMALE:So, do i have to throw out every bit of liquor 'cause you can't get that kids do not do what adults do? No.
LEADMALE:Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, mom.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i'm sorry, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry that i can't trust you anymore.
OTHERMALE:Yes, you can.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, we'll find out, i guess, 'cause i'm gonna be watchin' you like a hawk.
LEADMALE:And maybe someday, a long, long time from now, things will be the way they were before 'cause that's the way they should be.
SUPMALE:Your father, on the other hand, has decided to put a lock on the liquor cabinet, a fine tradition handed down in his family for generations.
SUPFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
SUPMALE:It is so cold out there! Here, have some coffee.
SUPFEMALE:You're a god.
LEADMALE:Ok, here.
OTHERMALE:How's dad? Well, he might have broken his hip.
LEADFEMALE:Mom's taking him to the hospital.
LEADMALE:Oh, cut it out.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i think i should go down there with you.
SUPMALE:No! Mom's tense enough already.
LEADMALE:Like i am gonna make her more tense? She is the one that makes me more tense.
SUPMALE:And you know how she is in a crisis.
LEADFEMALE:She can't handle a crisis! i can handle a crisis! The car's all warmed up.
LEADFEMALE:You should have plenty of gas.
LEADMALE:I checked the oil.
LEADFEMALE:Just drive careful, will ya? The roads are real icy.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, i--i should go down there with you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're gonna need me.
OTHERMALE:No, i need you here.
LEADMALE:He's working you need to be on monster patrol.
OTHERMALE:Ok, i'll stay here, but you better call me as soon as you get down there.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, look, i got to go.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, the kids get up at 7:00.
OTHERFEMALE:There's stuff in here for breakfast, and stuff in here for making them lunch.
SUPFEMALE:So, basically, the food is in the refrigerator? Right.
SUPFEMALE:Are you going to be able to handle this? Yes! yes! No problem.
LEADMALE:I make them breakfast, i make them lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just help with breakfast, and i'll give 'em some money andy they can buy their own lunch? Dan, i think making three sandwiches is within my scope of accomplishment, really.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:D.j. doesn't eat lettuce.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you going to do about work? Oh, i can figure something out about that.
LEADFEMALE:What time are you gonna be back? Late.
SUPMALE:6:30, 7:00.

LEADMALE:Aunt jackie what? Look what becky did.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Oh d.j. , come talk to mom.
LEADMALE:It's all your fault, doody-head.
LEADMALE:D.j. , you're so insignif.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna tell mom you cursed.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, mom? Put that on.
LEADFEMALE:That's not clean.
OTHERFEMALE:No, but it's dry.
LEADMALE:So, you get going now, go to school.
LEADMALE:Go--go learn something, pass a note.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be home at 3:30, unless i have detention.
LEADFEMALE:Otherwise, 4:20.
LEADFEMALE:It's mom what? I didn't say anything.
LEADMALE:Mom--mom, i got to go.
OTHERMALE:Mommom! Mom-she's still talking.
LEADMALE:I got to truck.
SUPMALE:Roseanneno.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
SUPMALE:She's already gone.
LEADMALE:But if you want me to, i'll call her that when she comes home.
LEADMALE:Help me! help me! i'm trapped! i'm stuck! So, listen, are you going to be gone for the whole week? No, it's ok.
LEADMALE:It's fine.
LEADMALE:No problem.
OTHERFEMALE:D.j. 's stuck in his shirt.
LEADMALE:Well, you tell daddy i love him, and tell mom, hi.
LEADMALE:And, oh! What's dan like to eat? That's disgusting.
LEADMALE:What? roseanne? Oh, hi, jackie.
LEADMALE:Hi, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:She already left.
OTHERFEMALE:You speak to her? Yeah, i just hung up from her.
LEADMALE:Everything's fine.
LEADFEMALE:They're gonna keep my dad in the hospital for a couple of more days, but it's not a serious break or anything.
LEADMALE:Is he in a lot of pain? Well, he's--he's with my mother and my sister.
SUPMALE:I spoke to roseanne last night, and she couldn't get ahold of you yet and wasn't sure she'd be able to, so i told her i'd come by and just check up.
LEADMALE:You mean check up on me, like i couldn't handle it? what are you trying to say? I'm not trying to say anything.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it sounds like you are.
SUPMALE:I'm tired of everybody thinking i can't handle everything.
SUPMALE:I might not do everything exactly the way roseanne would do it if roseanne was here, or the way that you would do it if you were here, but i think i can handle three kids for three days.
LEADMALE:Why do you always take everything i say the wrong way? Well, maybe everything you say comes out the wrong way.
LEADMALE:And what way's that? Oh, you know, in that proper, polite, annoying, crystal kind of way.
OTHERFEMALE:And what's with the accent? You grew up in lanford, just like we did.
OTHERFEMALE:My father came both: from arkansas.
LEADFEMALE:Now look, jackie, i know you're upset with your dad, in the hospital and all, but that doesn't mean i gotta stand here and take any of your crap! My life isn't all sunshine and roses, you know.
OTHERMALE:Well you sure as hell make it sound that way with the little cosmetics bag and your pink kitchen chairs.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry you don't like my kitchen chairs, jackie.
LEADMALE:And believe me when i say it will distress me throughout the day! Oh why don't you just tell roseanne i came by.
SUPMALE:Crystal, wait.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll see you around.
LEADMALE:Crystal, hold on, wait a second.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal! What? Crystal i think you owe me an apology.
SUPFEMALE:I apologize.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Now, what needs to be done? Well, i should probably go to the store.
LEADFEMALE:I know they're out of peanut butter, you know, that crunchy kind.
LEADMALE:Is that what the kids like? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:It's what i like.
SUPMALE:What are you doin' here? Playing housewife.
LEADMALE:I don't believe this room's ever been used for that before.

LEADFEMALE:My girls? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Where are they now? Everybody's upstairs doing their homework.
SUPMALE:Ha ha, sucker.
LEADMALE:Well, they cleaned up without complaining.
OTHERFEMALE:How did you get them to do that? Cash.
LEADFEMALE:You bribed them? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And while i was giving them money, i told them how it would be real bad for their mom to come home to a filthy house, disgusting house.
SUPFEMALE:You laid a guilt trip on them.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shut up and eat your pot roast.
LEADFEMALE:You made pot roast? Crystal helped.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal makes great pot roast.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was her recipe, but i cooked it.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, she did call up at 6:30 and make sure the gravy was right.
LEADMALE:Milk.
SUPFEMALE:Calcium.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to join me, or did you already eat? I'm not really that hungry.
LEADMALE:Boy, you're home kind of late.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I had six guys in by 7:30.
SUPMALE:We only got through the middle driveway by lunch.
LEADMALE:The architect came by, though.
SUPMALE:He said he was gonna take me up on a c-brace idea for the interior.
LEADMALE:Your idea.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:You know, just him taking up that little suggestion is going to save a lot of time.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm sure that he could tell you knew what you were talking about.
OTHERMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's a big job, but it's great.
LEADFEMALE:I got 11 guys working under me.
LEADFEMALE:Most contractors can't even get work now.
SUPFEMALE:This is the slowest time of year.
SUPFEMALE:That's great, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't roseanne tell you? No.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm hitting the big time.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a regular big shot.
OTHERMALE:No kidding.

LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:No, i did.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You got any more pota--potatoes? so, four aces construction is really booming, huh? Well, maybe soon you'll be able to add that fifth ace.
SUPFEMALE:Is it good? This is as good a pot roast as i've ever had.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now, you're just saying that.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'm in love with this pot roast.
SUPMALE:The big question is is there any applesauce? No.
SUPMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Yes! yes, we have sauce! I may have to upgrade you from sister-in-law to friend.
SUPMALE:Oh, dan, that's really sweet.
LEADMALE:Well, i just want you to know i really appreciate you coming over and helping out like this.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i like you like this.
LEADMALE:What? You know--nice.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? i work here, remember? Oh, french toast.
LEADFEMALE:I'm impressed.
LEADMALE:I can cook.
SUPMALE:It's just no fun cooking for one person.
LEADMALE:Why is everybody so surprised that i can cook? Not everybody.
LEADMALE:Just the people that know you.
SUPFEMALE:There's fresh juice on the table.
LEADMALE:Fresh squeezed? No, but it's freshly opened.
SUPFEMALE:Should i put some coffee in your thermos? No, i can do it.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, i'll do-you sit down and eat your breakfast.
OTHERFEMALE:What? what's so funny? I just had a flashback.
SUPMALE:Roseanne was like this, too for the first two weeks.
LEADMALE:There was some pot roast left over last night, so i made you a sandwich for your lunch today, ok? I feel like i'm being set up for a hit here.
SUPMALE:Dan, do you think you might be late again tonight? About the same.
LEADMALE:Why? It's just that the kids were missing you.
LEADMALE:I don't think darlene trusts me to check her homework.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene did her homework? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We sat down here at the table and talked, and she did her work.
LEADMALE:She's a great kid, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going? I got to go.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna be late.
SUPMALE:Well, you have to have breakfast.

LEADMALE:Good morning, you two.
SUPMALE:Darlene, you're wearing makeup? No.
SUPFEMALE:Your cheeks are so rosy.
LEADMALE:I don't think the heat was working last night.
LEADMALE:Oh, actually i turned the heat off before i left last night.
OTHERMALE:Not good to sleep with the house too warm.
SUPMALE:Did you sleep ok? Yeah, i did.
LEADMALE:Aunt jackie, what do you think of this outfit? I like it.
LEADFEMALE:Kind of sexy.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mom doesn't like it.
LEADMALE:Well, mom's not here.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, all right, jack! So, how long you think the big r will stay south? Well, i think she's gonna be gone a couple more days at least.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes! Awesome.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe on saturday we can do a mall marathon.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:That'd be fun.
SUPFEMALE:Is it all right if my friend jody comes with us? I think jodi's a dip.
LEADFEMALE:We can just go, the three of us.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:We'll make better time that way.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, speaking of time, becky, could you run go get your brother.
LEADFEMALE:She's eating.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get him.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Thanks, dar.
SUPFEMALE:J-bird, you're an experienced woman, right? Well, i'm not all that experienced.
LEADMALE:But you have dated a lot of boys.
SUPMALE:Yes, and a couple of men.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least one.
SUPMALE:Ok, this guy roy he's a major babe.
LEADMALE:Yeah? And i know that he likes me, but he doesn't know that i like him.
LEADMALE:I don't want to do anything weak, like write him a note or have someone else tell him for me.
LEADMALE:Mm.
OTHERMALE:Well, what always worked for me was a look.
LEADFEMALE:Because the great thing about a look is you can never say the wrong thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Brilliant! i got d.j. i want to watch tv! Oh, no, d.j. not now.
LEADMALE:We're running kind of late.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Are you gonna be here when i get home from school? Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can play some dirty scrabble.
OTHERFEMALE:You can count on it.
LEADMALE:Ok, everybody! time for school! Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Front and center, chop-chop! I've been on this job for six days, and already the company's got two firm offers for future work.
SUPMALE:Man, this is great.
LEADMALE:I mean, when it rains, it pours.
SUPFEMALE:I'm even thinking of getting another truck and hiring on a new guy permanent.
LEADMALE:Well, i am pretty proud of you.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of me, too.
LEADMALE:You should be, dan.
SUPMALE:You've taken this company from nothing and made it into really, really a success.
SUPFEMALE:That's me-a success.
SUPFEMALE:Want to hand me the dishrag? No, just hand them to me.
SUPMALE:I'll dry.
SUPMALE:I've never washed dishes with another woman before.
LEADMALE:Really? how does it feel? Cheap.
LEADFEMALE:So this is what marriage is all about.
LEADFEMALE:You come home from work.
LEADMALE:Have dinner with your spouse.
SUPMALE:Wash the dishes together.
LEADMALE:Shoot the breeze.
LEADFEMALE:Go to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:You're glamorizing it.
LEADFEMALE:I think it would be really comforting to have somebody to talk to, when you come home.
SUPMALE:Or at least have somebody be there when you come home.
LEADFEMALE:It is, for the most part.
SUPFEMALE:Not that i've ever had anybody.
LEADMALE:What about that cop you were seeing--bob? bob? you mean dave? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Dave.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm not seeing him anymore.
LEADMALE:There is another cop, though--paul.
LEADFEMALE:You better pace yourself, jackie, or you're gonna run out of cops.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll have to dip into the firemen's pool.
LEADMALE:I've dated firemen.
LEADMALE:Firemen are ok.
SUPMALE:They're usually always on time.
SUPMALE:So, tell me about this paul.
SUPMALE:What's his problem? Oh, i don't know what his problem is.
OTHERFEMALE:He calls and he comes over, tells me he's gonna call the next day, and then he never calls.
SUPMALE:And when he does call, i have to pretend like i'm busy, because i can't have him thinking i'm available every time he calls.
SUPMALE:So--so i'm sitting around spending a lot of time looking like i'm busy.
LEADFEMALE:That's what makes a good cop.
LEADFEMALE:But i am a good cop.
LEADFEMALE:I know, i just said you were a-but you were kidding.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i am a good cop.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I forgot.
OTHERMALE:I have to watch myself before i pay you a compliment.
SUPFEMALE:You're not used to hearing that from me.
LEADFEMALE:So maybe next time you're gonna compliment me, you better warn me first.
LEADMALE:Anyway, that's the story about paul.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, jack, you gotta lay down the law to these guys.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you shouldn't be treated like that.
LEADMALE:That's the way guys are, dan.
LEADFEMALE:No, they're not.
LEADMALE:Not all of them.
LEADMALE:I'm not like that.
LEADMALE:Well, then i guess i should go out and find a perfect guy like you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, perfect.
LEADMALE:No, you know, just a good job, charming, decent three kids and a wife.
SUPFEMALE:That's never stopped you before.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Cheap shot.
SUPMALE:I should have grabbed you when i first saw you.
SUPMALE:No chance.
SUPFEMALE:No? what, me date a freshman? are you kidding? No way.
SUPFEMALE:I bet that you don't remember the first time we met.
SUPMALE:I do.
OTHERMALE:So do i.
LEADMALE:No, you don't.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, i don't.
SUPMALE:But i was kind enough to let my sister have you.
LEADFEMALE:"kind"? is that the word you used? "kind"? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I stepped aside and i held back all my budding teenage passions.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd better let this soak till tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i'll get that tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:What time are you leaving? Early.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow's going to be a bear.
LEADMALE:You are so funny.
LEADMALE:What? I embarrassed you.
LEADMALE:You didn't embarrass me.
SUPFEMALE:You know you didn't embarrass me.
LEADMALE:You know, used to have a crush on you in a big way back then.
LEADMALE:You did? Yeah, i thought you were pretty cute.
LEADMALE:You want a beer? Now i am embarrassing you.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not embarrassing me.
LEADMALE:Hell, i thought you were cute, too.
LEADFEMALE:You hated me.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i hated you, but i thought you were cute.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah you just got on my nerves, that's all.
SUPMALE:I still get on your nerves.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:So tell me more about paaaul.
LEADMALE:Ohwell, he's-he's basically a nice guy.
LEADMALE:But he's a liar.
LEADMALE:But not like a vicious liar.
SUPMALE:He tells me he's got an '87 car, and it's really an '85.
LEADMALE:You know, the little things like that.
OTHERFEMALE:You kill me, jackie.
LEADMALE:You deserve better than the guys you go out with.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're smart, you're fun, you're nice looking.
OTHERMALE:You mean that in a good way? Yes, i do.
LEADMALE:Aw hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, honey, how are you doing? yeah, how's it goin'? Aw, man well, you're not going to be there that much longer.
SUPMALE:Listen, i'm going to take off.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Hang on, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, you leaving? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Tell her hi, and i'll see you tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, jackie.
SUPMALE:We just lost the poly high game 27-14.
LEADMALE:You were standing on the northeast corner of the football field with that red-headed girl.
LEADMALE:And she had on an orange sweater, and you had on a gray hooded sweat shirt.
LEADMALE:Jackie drive careful.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Hi, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I miss you.
SUPMALE:It's mom! hey, dad, mom's home! I think your hair is so cute.
LEADFEMALE:It's really wild, too.
SUPMALE:When did you get that done? Oh, well, in the hospital, mom was driving dad nuts.
SUPMALE:So the doctor said i should take her to the beauty shop, you know, and they got ahold of me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Scarlet, you're back dorothy hamill style.
SUPMALE:I cleaned my closet.
SUPMALE:You actually found your closet? We're close to winning the division championship.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, mom, mom! What? did you miss me? Not one bit.
LEADFEMALE:Did you miss me? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you guys have lunch?
OTHERMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you call in sick and we'll go do something? why don't you go do something with dan? I already did something with dan.
LEADFEMALE:We got out of bed.
LEADMALE:I thought you and dan were gonna go over to phil and vonda's.
OTHERMALE:No, i don't think we're gonna go.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? 'cause he has about 50 games he wants to watch, and then d.j. has joey over.
OTHERMALE:Well, so, maybe you could go later, after becky gets back from the mall.
LEADMALE:Duh! Hey, jackie.
SUPMALE:Nice crease.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? Out.
LEADFEMALE:Can i go with you? Oh, please.
OTHERMALE:Dan, we could, um, go over to phil and vonda's later on.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Who's this party for, anyway? well, what difference does it make? It's people.
SUPFEMALE:It's a chance to get out of the house.
LEADMALE:Come on, play defense! Is that what you're gonna do all day? just sit here and watch sports? Pretty much.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, phil and vonda don't live that far.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i promise you won't have to be on your feet more than two minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Phil and vonda have a tv set, too.
LEADMALE:Yeah they got an iron, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you go over there? I'm going to work.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you later.
SUPFEMALE:Are you gonna be here? For the rest of my life.
SUPMALE:I'm back! How much are they losing by? I've ever saw.
LEADFEMALE:These guys are so bad, it's unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:Do you want me to mend these or just toss 'em out? yeah, honey, would you fix 'em? I wanna keep 'em.
LEADMALE:Do you want me to fix this so you can wear it, too? Yeah, honey.
LEADMALE:It's my favorite.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, there's a guy outside petting a motorcycle.
SUPMALE:Oh, let me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god! You're not going to believe this.

SUPFEMALE:What brings you back here, man? come back to find yourself? Hey, man, i never lost it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's your opinion.
SUPFEMALE:So what brings you back to lanford? Oh, we're laying a fiber optic cable right through the center of town.
LEADMALE:Mom, whose motorcycle's in our front yard? Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Who are these kids? They came with the house.
SUPFEMALE:Wow! I had to make mine.
SUPMALE:You got kids? Yeah, 2 boys.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Checked them at birth.
LEADMALE:They're boys.
LEADMALE:How come you didn't invite us to your wedding? what wedding? aren't you married? Nah! No.

SUPMALE:I can see why.
SUPFEMALE:And what's your name? Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, i dig it.
LEADFEMALE:You named her after the mouseketeer.
LEADMALE:What?! Is that true? Of course that's not true.

OTHERMALE:So how's it feel to be back in lanford? It's weird, man.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i made the whole main street/ lanford avenue loop.
LEADMALE:You know, drove by the high school, drove by cook's.
LEADMALE:I mean, like, absolutely nothing's changed.
SUPMALE:I mean, even those railroad tracks behind the supermarket that run right into the cement wall.
LEADFEMALE:In my opinion, the perfect metaphor for lanford.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you ever killed anyone? Check it out, man.
OTHERFEMALE:'71.
SUPFEMALE:Lookout point.
LEADFEMALE:That's when yor introduced me to the harris sisters.
LEADMALE:Yor? yor? That's your dad.
LEADMALE:Yor! yor?! yor?! yor! Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You little chicks got a problem with that? I called jackie.
LEADFEMALE:She's gonna meet us later so we can go out.
LEADMALE:Ok, great.
LEADMALE:I thought we might spring for a meal at the lanford inn, but you gotta wear a tie.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:Danny, let's you and me just go over to the lobo, huh? hey, what about me? what about you? You're not leaving me here while you two go out and guy around, norbert.

LEADMALE:Oh, god.
SUPMALE:Hey, zig, can we go look at your honda? my what? My what?! Pumpkin, it's a harley.
OTHERFEMALE:It is a heritage soft tail-the new evolution engine, the blockhead that is 80, 8-o, cubic inches of bone-shaking power annette.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, not a honda.
OTHERFEMALE:Harley.
LEADMALE:Can you say harley? I know that you can.
SUPMALE:Apologize to the zigmeister.

LEADMALE:That bike's a classic.
SUPMALE:We better get to lobo before it gets too crowded! Hey, come on, i just gotta take a look at it before we go.
LEADFEMALE:Just to pay homage, huh? yeah, what the hell? It's been a while since i've had the bike out.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Work's been keeping me real busy.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i hear you, man.
SUPMALE:A couple years ago, i hurt my back.
LEADMALE:I couldn't get back on my wheels for almost 2 weeks.
LEADFEMALE:I made a vow, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, never again.
LEADMALE:Well, that's what i mean, man, you know? I mean, things come up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, priorities, man.
SUPFEMALE:I got this canvas to keep the sawdust off.
OTHERMALE:And, well, you know, like i said, uh, things come up.
SUPFEMALE:It could use a little work.
OTHERFEMALE:I got the front wheel right here, and i could polish up the chrome a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:It would probably start right up.
SUPMALE:Danny danny, man you should have called.
LEADMALE:They proved it in court, man, i'm telling you.

LEADMALE:I like ddt.
SUPFEMALE:Is this ecology bag your latest trip? Call me fussy, pal.
LEADMALE:This is my planet.
SUPFEMALE:Really? We weren't sure.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you, you guys are living too far from the edge.
LEADFEMALE:You want to live on the edge? Try getting a mortgage for 30 years.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, we're twice as insane as you are.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you still got the knack, sis.
LEADFEMALE:Well, some things you never lose.
SUPMALE:And some things you lose to the wrong person.

LEADMALE:What are you talking about? I don't know, i mean, like-like telling me you're a cop.
SUPFEMALE:No, i am.
SUPMALE:I'm a policewoman for the lanford police force.
LEADMALE:So what have you been doing? roseanne, what do i do for a living? You better not drink no more.

SUPMALE:What did i ever see in that guy? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I think you kept your eyes closed all the time.
LEADMALE:What is it with guys on motorcycles? Well, speaking as a young girl, you know for certain that's the one thing that's really gonna freak your parents out.
SUPFEMALE:And that is a big plus.
LEADFEMALE:Big plus.
LEADFEMALE:God, you know, but i just used to love riding on that thing with dan.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, just that feeling, you know? It was like danger and freedom and sex and it was all rolled up into one.
LEADFEMALE:He used to come and pick me up on his bike and we would just blast off and hit the highway.
OTHERMALE:We'd just be flying.
SUPFEMALE:God, it was so much fun.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I really miss that.
SUPMALE:Danny, be straight with me, man.
SUPMALE:I mean, hey, come on, just because we haven't seen each other for 20 years doesn't mean i'm not still your best friend.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to you, man? what happened to rosie? what happened to that '55 pan, man? Hey, man, i got 3 kids.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, so? I got 2 kids and 3 motorcycles.

LEADMALE:Everybody and their dog is gonna be there.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:We'll trash the marriott.
LEADMALE:Man, you saw the bike.
SUPFEMALE:There's no way.
LEADMALE:Don't blame it on the bike, man.
SUPFEMALE:Harleys never die.
SUPFEMALE:Just the owners.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, come on.
LEADMALE:I can't.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Then sell me the bike.
SUPMALE:Roseanne: hey, that bike is the last speck of our youth.
LEADMALE:You can't go sell that bike.
LEADMALE:Come on, roseanne, we don't use it anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Precisely my point.
LEADMALE:That's why we gotta keep it.
SUPFEMALE:You know, what's gotten into you? i mean, what's this kick you're all of a sudden on? oh, you mean this wanting to live thing? Ha ha.
SUPMALE:You know, when i was going out with you, dan-and believe it or not, we did go out all the time-make a point, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:It's just, you know, i just used to love the sound of that bike.
SUPMALE:I could hear it like a block away, you know? And i knew that you were gonna be coming and showing up any second.
OTHERMALE:That bike was like my favorite sound in the entire world.
SUPMALE:That bike's where we fell in love.
SUPMALE:Oh, we're still in love.
LEADMALE:We don't need no bike to be in love.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but, i mean, when we were riding on that bike, dan, we were free.
LEADMALE:Baby, that's not us anymore.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, no kidding.
LEADFEMALE:We are as dusty and old as that bike itself.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
SUPMALE:It's true, dan.
LEADMALE:Nobody ever comes and takes us out for a spin.
LEADMALE:Spin? when do we have time to go out for a spin? Well, we don't even do nothing anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, we don't travel.
LEADFEMALE:We don't do nothing.
SUPMALE:We lock ourselves up here in the living room in front of the tv, and then we go to work.
LEADMALE:I mean, we used to be dan and roseanne.
SUPMALE:We're still dan and roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:No, we're not.
LEADMALE:We're the conners, like the bells and the hacketts and the joneses.
SUPMALE:I like being the conners.
LEADMALE:Don't sell the bike.
LEADMALE:I love that bike as much as you do.
SUPFEMALE:But right now it's a piece of junk and it's taking up a lot of space, and we need the money.
LEADMALE:And wouldn't you rather be dan and roseanne in the black? Geezer! Roseanne: he's in here, zig.
LEADFEMALE:Ziggy's here to pick up the bike.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i was just looking for stock parts.
SUPMALE:Hey, zig.
LEADFEMALE:I found the fenders and the fat bob tank.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't find the cap.
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:Well, i wanna make sure you get everything i got.

LEADFEMALE:Hey, baby remember this? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ok, i, uh i made this out for half the amount.
LEADMALE:And then i wrote one out for the other half.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll be good in 3 weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Ok? I can't do it.
LEADMALE:I can't sell you the bike.
SUPMALE:I thought i could.
SUPMALE:I can't sell it.
LEADFEMALE:It's too much of my past.
LEADFEMALE:Forget the past, man! I'm not gonna sell you the bike, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, ok? I'm not saying you should sell me the bike.
LEADMALE:That's great.
SUPMALE:Cool.
SUPMALE:Don't sell me the bike.
LEADFEMALE:But don't do it 'cause you're hanging on to the past, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Do it 'cause you're gonna get back on it, ok? You've been riding that sofa too long.
LEADMALE:I'm not a teenager in high school anymore! hey, neither am i, man, ok?! I haven't been in study hall for20 years.
LEADMALE:Man, i'm talking about shutting down inside.
LEADFEMALE:You don't get dust on the fenders until you shut off the engine.
LEADMALE:Well, what do you think it would take to get her going again? A phone call to my old lady saying i'll be another few days.
LEADFEMALE:What about work, man? I thought you had to get back to work.
SUPMALE:Well, that was before i had a bike to rebuild.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:I appreciate this.
SUPMALE:Hey priorities, man.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, d.j. , come on.

OTHERMALE:And that can always make a big difference.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just getting you back out in the world again.

LEADFEMALE:Well, i've already seen the coffee maker, and i've met arthur.
SUPMALE:Well, basically, all we need is somebody to catch the phone, make coffee, and every now and then make a path across the room with a push broom.
SUPMALE:Oh, and clean up after work.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i'm sure i can do that and everything.
LEADMALE:I just don't know if i really even want to take this job.

SUPMALE:Because i just can't take this.
SUPMALE:This is torture.
LEADMALE:I mean, my life is a nightmare.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you know what he did to me? He tried to make me feel bad.
LEADMALE:You poor thing.
LEADMALE:On purpose.
LEADFEMALE:You know, my first husband was killed by a mortar attack.
SUPMALE:Oh, bummer.
SUPMALE:I think that says it all.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, where's the filters? So, i took in my buick.

LEADMALE:It's really gross.
LEADFEMALE:Did you see a doctor about this? Oh, i think you've got impetigo.
LEADMALE:Oh, really.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? It's a skin rash.
LEADFEMALE:My kids get it all the time.
OTHERMALE:It's from wiping your nose with your hand like that.
SUPFEMALE:You just need to put some antibiotic cream on it, you know, and then-and then you know wash your hands every once in a while.
LEADFEMALE:All done, sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, jacques.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.

LEADFEMALE:Say good-bye, jacques.
OTHERFEMALE:So, how do you like the job so far? Well, it's just like being home.
SUPFEMALE:I sweep, i answer phones, and i do laundry.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, where are the clean towels? And i listen to children whine.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, top cabinet, left side.
LEADMALE:We think you're doing a great job.
LEADFEMALE:I appreciate that, but the truth is that i could come in here for just half a day and get all this stuff done.
LEADFEMALE:Arthur likes having someone full-time.
LEADFEMALE:Marsha arthur's dead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what would you say to a promotion? I'd have to say no because i don't think i'm gonna keep this job.
LEADMALE:It means $2.
LEADFEMALE:00 more an hour plus tips.
LEADMALE:Tips for what? Shampooing heads.
SUPMALE:Can you do that? Yeah, i can do that.
SUPFEMALE:I can do anything.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a conway.
SUPFEMALE:Susan noonan said that her mother saw you sweeping up people's hair in the beauty parlor.
LEADMALE:Well, you tell susan noonan that i saw her mom getting her roots bleached and her moustache waxed.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, becky, your mother's got a job, ok? She's doing the best she can.
LEADFEMALE:Are you wearing perfume? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I bought it after work.
SUPMALE:Tres chic.
OTHERFEMALE:Perfume? Yeah, you know, i figured i deserved it.
LEADFEMALE:Sure you do, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, whatever gets you through the day.
SUPMALE:Actually, i--i was kind of celebrating.
SUPFEMALE:I got a promotion.
LEADMALE:Promotion? promotion to what, shampoo girl? what? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:What? Never mind.
OTHERFEMALE:What? I'm just wrong, that's all.
OTHERMALE:Honey, i kind of expected you would be supportive.
SUPFEMALE:I was wrong.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Ok, i'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of promotion did you get? Shampoo woman.
SUPMALE:I stand corrected.
LEADMALE:You're a dead man.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADMALE:Good going, mom.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, deej.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's great, honey.
LEADMALE:Far cry from sweeping hair, huh? I still do that.
LEADFEMALE:So is there a raise involved with this promotion? Yes, but, you know, it's not supposed to be about the money.
LEADMALE:It's kind of a-it's kind of a prestige thing.
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:I mean 'cause, you know, people kind of look up to you when you're shampooing them.
LEADMALE:They have no choice.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's a job, right? It's a good job.
SUPFEMALE:That's what i said.
OTHERMALE:It's a good job.
LEADMALE:No, you didn't.
LEADFEMALE:You said, "hey, it's a job, right?" i meant to say it's a good job.
LEADMALE:Good job.
LEADMALE:No, it's not.
LEADMALE:It's not a good job.
LEADMALE:It's a degrading job, but nobody there makes me feel like it is.
SUPFEMALE:That's your job.
LEADFEMALE:Nice going, d.j. what? Hey, roseanne i'm really sorry.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you liked this job.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i don't like this job.
LEADMALE:You liked this job a minute ago in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't even know what i like.
SUPMALE:I mean, i like the people.
LEADMALE:I mean, i guess i like them.
LEADMALE:I don't really know them or nothing, but i like them, and they like me, and that just makes sweeping up hair not so bad.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i know it's a completely degrading job, and-but-but i feel happy, you know, um there's just something about knowing where i'm going when i get up in the morning and liking the people that i work with and knowing that i maybe might go back there again tomorrow and knowing that they want me.
LEADMALE:I mean, i'm happy.
SUPMALE:So what's the secret, babe? lower standards? Well, i just don't think my standards could get any lower than you, and i married you.
SUPMALE:Aah! You know, roseanne, i never imagined in my whole life that i'd have you washing my hair.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i always thought about holding your head under water more than once.
LEADMALE:Ok, go ahead and sit up.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Marsha's ready for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Crystal, what are you doing? It's a tip.
SUPMALE:You don't have to do that.
LEADFEMALE:But i want to, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:If it was anybody else, i'd tip them.
LEADFEMALE:Well, just keep it, roseanne, ok? But let me ask you something, crystal.
SUPFEMALE:Are you going to come in here every week and do this? Well, i just might.
SUPMALE:Welllet's make you another appointment.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal, i really want to thank you for helping me get this job.
SUPMALE:Well, that's what friends are for, roseanne, to be there for each other.
LEADMALE:Think of all the things you've done for me.
LEADMALE:And you think 10 bucks is going to even it? You silly.
LEADMALE:Let's go sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Marsha's crazy about you.
LEADMALE:Really? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody here loves you.
SUPMALE:She told me.
LEADMALE:I'm just so proud of you, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal, i just want to tell you, you-you're--you're my best friend.
SUPFEMALE:Well, no, i'm not, either.
LEADFEMALE:Your sister is, but-all right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Now, iris, i love what you did last week, but i want to try something different.
LEADFEMALE:Can you make me look like that? Oh, i'm sure you can, iris.
LEADMALE:I'll go get the wand.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal, how you doing, honey? I'm sorry you had to wait.
LEADMALE:That's ok.
SUPMALE:Marsha, i'm gonna go over to the coffee shop and pick up the lunches now.
LEADFEMALE:Arthur always says lunch is the second most important meal of the day.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Dan's coming by with my kids 'cause iris is going to cut their hair for me.
LEADMALE:I'll see ya.
LEADFEMALE:Wait till you meet dan.
SUPFEMALE:He's real nice.
OTHERFEMALE:He's just like a great big old teddy bear.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, crystal, i tried that natural clay facial mask sample you gave me.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:That stuff works.
LEADMALE:What i tell you.
OTHERMALE:My skin feels so creamy smooth.
SUPFEMALE:And it gets all the gunk out of those little clogged pores.
LEADFEMALE:I need to find a new deodorant.
LEADMALE:I'm getting all this chafing.
LEADMALE:Hi, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, crystal.
SUPMALE:Is roseanne around? She'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm marsha.
LEADMALE:Dan has great skin.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, marsha.
SUPFEMALE:I heard a lot about you.
OTHERMALE:That must be arthur.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, kids, i'm gonna be a couple minutes, so why don't you guys tear the place apart.
SUPMALE:I don't think you know what you're saying.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't have to stick around.
LEADFEMALE:We'll keep an eye on the kids.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, i kind of better wait for roseanne.
LEADMALE:Are you roseanne's husband? Yes, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Oh, he's cute.
LEADMALE:He's he's very cute.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you need to lose a little weight.
SUPMALE:You're so handsome.
LEADMALE:Don't you think he's handsome? My nephew in baltimore just lost 60 pounds on that cottage cheese and banana diet.
LEADMALE:That doesn't sound very healthy.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm gonna go next door to the hardware store.
SUPFEMALE:Just tell rosie i'll be-sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:She'll be back in 2 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:You know, if you cut your hair shorter in the front and let it grow a little in the back, your neck would look longer.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go to the hardware store.
LEADFEMALE:It's not hot enough! That's 'cause it's not on.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I was right then.
SUPFEMALE:You know, your little boy looks just like you.
LEADMALE:It's the hair.
LEADMALE:It's the hair.
SUPFEMALE:No, i think it's the eyes.
LEADMALE:He has very dark eyes.
SUPMALE:You got sweet kids, rosie.
SUPFEMALE:Is it ok if i call you rosie? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Dan calls me rosie.
OTHERFEMALE:Arthur used to call me cheryl.
SUPFEMALE:Not that it's any of my business, marsha, but how long were you and arthur married? Too bad you weren't married to him longer.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you wouldn't have missed him so bad.
SUPMALE:Are we ready to close up here? My first client's isn't till noon, so i'm gonna come in late.
SUPMALE:I think i'm going to run a bigger ad this weekend.
LEADMALE:What do you think? That's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:You know what i think's a good idea? You oughta run an ad in one of those high school newspapers.
LEADFEMALE:You know, a lot of those girls have hair.
SUPMALE:That's a great idea.
SUPMALE:Isn't that a great idea? Yeah, it's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, have you made up your mind about this job yet? Yeah, i hate it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course you hate it, honey, but are you gonna stay with us? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i am.
LEADFEMALE:But i hope it doesn't get any better 'cause then i'd have to get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:So we'll see you tomorrow? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'll be here.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Good night, arthur.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Meg, rosie's down at the coffee shop getting lunches.
LEADMALE:I can just pick up the phone and call her.
LEADFEMALE:You sure you wouldn't like something? Please, marsha, i'm trying to diet.
LEADMALE:I just lost 3 pounds.
LEADFEMALE:Chow time.
LEADMALE:I once lost 42 pounds.
LEADFEMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:How? Communist guerrillas locked me in a bamboo cage for 6 months.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but don't you get irritable? Only for the first month.
SUPMALE:Turkey sandwich.
LEADMALE:With nothing on it? There's some turkey on it, but i'll bet you could scrape it off.
SUPFEMALE:Their turkey's very fresh.
OTHERMALE:Their chicken, too.
LEADMALE:Well, you know what they say.
OTHERMALE:Women go through this poultry phase.
SUPFEMALE:You are right, roxanne.
SUPMALE:When i was in my 30s, i ate nothing but turkey, chicken, and tuna.
LEADFEMALE:I lived on tuna.
LEADMALE:Well, tuna isn't exactly poultry, but it's very like poultry.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you have to put some kind of dressing on it, or it tastes likecloth.
LEADMALE:Isn't that right, jacques? Tossed green, lemon.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Lucky you.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you order lunch, debbie? No.
LEADFEMALE:My eating has gotten completely out of control.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i've been having breakfast, then lunch, and then i have dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you just described my morning.
SUPFEMALE:You know, roseanne, you have such a pretty face.
LEADFEMALE:It's a shame you keep it hidden by all that extra weight.
SUPMALE:Roseanne doesn't have to worry about keeping slim.
SUPFEMALE:Dan's crazy about her no matter how she looks.
LEADMALE:Thanks, crystal.
OTHERMALE:Oh, i'm sorry, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean for it to sound like-uh, well, it's just she's so happily married, and you're just not on the market anymore is all i meant.
LEADFEMALE:No, crystal.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I do need to lose weight, and i'll tell you what i'm gonna do.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna start now by picking a day next week to go on a diet.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Next week's bad.
SUPMALE:March is out.
SUPMALE:Ow! i must have put these pants in the dryer! aah! What's the matter with you? My pants shrank.
LEADMALE:How dare they.
LEADMALE:Oh, i guess they didn't shrink.
OTHERFEMALE:I just grew.
LEADMALE:I think we've grown together, i hope.
SUPFEMALE:We got to go on a diet.
OTHERFEMALE:What's this "we" jazz? My pants fit fine.
SUPMALE:Well, my pants don't fit me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, your pants don't fit me either.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha ha, dan.
SUPMALE:Let's burn the weight off with humor.
SUPMALE:Look at yourself.
SUPMALE:You are too fat! You've got to go on a diet.
LEADMALE:You go on a diet.
SUPMALE:I'm going to dinner.
LEADMALE:You got to move, deej.
LEADFEMALE:Make me.
LEADMALE:How about a kiss, hot stuff? I'm out of here! Go wash your hands.
SUPMALE:A little sugar-free, my pet? I'm serious, dan.
LEADFEMALE:We shouldn't even be eating all this fried stuff.
OTHERMALE:You guys going on a diet again? No.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:So i guess this means we're gonna have roast chicken for 3 nights until they get back to reality.
OTHERFEMALE:We're gonna look better, and we're gonna feel better.
LEADFEMALE:We won't eat better.
LEADFEMALE:You know how we hate being like this.
LEADMALE:Hey, roseanne, you know what? We don't go out a lot.
SUPFEMALE:We don't have a big house.
SUPFEMALE:Food is the one luxury we can afford.
SUPMALE:Well, food ain't supposed to be a luxury, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's supposed to keep you alive.
LEADMALE:It ain't supposed to provide entertainment value.
SUPMALE:What do you guys think? you think your mom needs to lose weight? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I like you mushy.
OTHERMALE:You could stand to lose a few, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't ask you.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Dad did.
LEADFEMALE:Well, your dad really shouldn't talk.
LEADMALE:Men are supposed to get heavy when they get older.
SUPMALE:They all do.
LEADFEMALE:But it doesn't look good on women.
SUPMALE:Well, that is about the dumbest thing you've ever said.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, face it.
LEADMALE:You're both tanks.
LEADMALE:Hey, you stay out of this.
SUPFEMALE:It's your fault i got fat in the first place.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right.
OTHERFEMALE:Like i invented double dutch chocolate.
LEADFEMALE:No, but i gained 20 pounds with that pregnancy.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, 40 pounds with each kid.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Remember when i was thin and beautiful? Honey, you're still beautiful.
LEADMALE:You've had 3 beautiful kids.
OTHERMALE:Well, i can't use that as an excuse forever.
SUPFEMALE:Sure you can.
SUPFEMALE:No, i can't use that forever.
LEADFEMALE:A couple of more years, max, but not forever.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, i'm going on a diet, dan.
LEADMALE:I'm starting right now.
LEADMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:I'll be here when you get back.
LEADMALE:This whole family has got to start eating better, i swear.
LEADMALE:That's 'cause i'm gonna start shopping better.
LEADFEMALE:'cause the whole place is full of junk.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADMALE:Chips, pretzels, macaroni and cheese ooh, we got mallomars.
LEADFEMALE:The kitchen's full of junk.
LEADFEMALE:The kids have got to eat.
SUPFEMALE:But we don't have to eat junk.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we do.
OTHERMALE:We need junk.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, look at yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i get more exercise in one day than most guys do in a week.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out there hauling and lugging and pushing and shoving.
LEADMALE:I've got great muscle tone under here.
LEADMALE:Feel that python.
LEADMALE:Go on.
OTHERFEMALE:Feel right there.
SUPMALE:I don't wanna feel right there.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanna get rid of some of this junk.
LEADFEMALE:She's flipped, dad.
SUPMALE:Hose her down.
LEADMALE:Listen.
LEADMALE:Just 'cause your pants are tight one day doesn't mean we're gonna throw away $40 worth of groceries.
OTHERMALE:Well, hey, drastic times are gonna call for drastic measures here.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i can hardly go on a diet having to look at all this horrible, hideous, yet delicious food.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:Out of sight, out of mind.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Now i'm gonna fix myself something good to eat.
OTHERMALE:I believe what you're looking for is in that cabinet.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: yeah, i think i did pretty good today.
SUPFEMALE:I had, like, a really light breakfast, and then a really little lunch.
LEADMALE:Then i had this diet soda.
SUPMALE:Then i had some of these carrot sticks of debbie's for a snack, and then a really little dinner.
SUPMALE:That's it? That's it.
LEADMALE:You did real good, babe.
LEADMALE:I did do good.
LEADMALE:How did you do? I didn't have anything.
LEADMALE:Dan, you had a great big hunk of meat loaf for dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:I only ate half that meat loaf.
SUPFEMALE:I threw the rest in the garbage.
SUPMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:That's half my dinner in the trash.
LEADMALE:All right then.
OTHERMALE:How many sandwiches did you have for lunch? i had 2, but it was that sliced chicken, remember? did you have that diet shake? And i had a shake.
LEADMALE:Diet shake? I had a shake.
LEADFEMALE:The diet shake? it was a chocolate shake, all right? I need a little sugar in the afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I guess you did good.
SUPFEMALE:We both did good.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, dan, as my reward for doing good, boy, i am gonna go in there and take a nice, long, hot, private bath.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, i would love to get and you deserve all 10.
LEADMALE:I'll stand guard against all intruders.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's probably sis.
LEADFEMALE:You just go in there and take your bath, and i'll tell her to call you right back.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, jackie, i'll tell her.
LEADMALE:Yeah, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Uh-huh.

LEADMALE:Yeah, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah--no, no, no, no, no.

LEADMALE:Ooh.

LEADMALE:It's out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, baking soda.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Jackieoh, jackie, i got to go.
SUPMALE:D.j. hurt himself.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Talk to you later.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Ah ha ha! Oh, jackie, you--you're the nuttiest.
LEADFEMALE:Mm, mm, mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Well, look at you! Got to go.
LEADMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:The very first week you agree to go on a diet, i catch you cheating.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:You agreed to go on a diet.
LEADMALE:Oh! ow! Ow.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, ice cream headache.
LEADFEMALE:Brain freeze, huh? Well, you deserve it.
LEADFEMALE:You go have some warm tap water.
SUPMALE:I don't even believe you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You did say you'd do this with me.
LEADMALE:You said that, and don't try to deny it.
LEADFEMALE:And you were cheating just then, too, weren't you? Don't try to deny that either.
SUPMALE:You did say we'll go on a diet, and if we are gonna diet, i say let's stick to the diet.
SUPMALE:Eating potato chips isn't gonna help anything.
LEADFEMALE:Who's eating potato chips? what? You said potato chips.
LEADMALE:Who's eating potato chips? I meant ice cream.
LEADFEMALE:But you said potato chips.
LEADMALE:I can't even believe you, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you try to turn this thing around on me.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna see what's going on in this bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPFEMALE:All: good morning.
SUPMALE:I brought breakfast.
LEADMALE:Yay! You're right, roseanne.
LEADMALE:This is the best bakery.
OTHERMALE:I mean, these doughnuts are the cakiest.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you're still not eating anything? No.
LEADMALE:You sure? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'm not even hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you have to eat something.
LEADMALE:How about a bran muffin? No.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I've been good for a week now.
LEADMALE:One little muffin's not going to hurt you.
LEADFEMALE:Arthur ate bran every day of his life.
LEADFEMALE:So i bet he had a pretty clean colon.
LEADMALE:Yes, he did.
LEADMALE:I like that in a man.
SUPFEMALE:Now, i know you're trying to be careful, but you're the one that told me i shouldn't hide under all the extra weight.
SUPFEMALE:Well, of course i did, but you can't starve yourself, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe just a half.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:You need to keep your energy up.
LEADMALE:I'm not even hungry.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even know why i'm eating this thing.
SUPFEMALE:Habit.
LEADMALE:You know, when i need to lose a few inches, i exercise.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:It's the best.
LEADMALE:When i exercise, i get so relaxed.
LEADFEMALE:It's like i actually zone out.
LEADFEMALE:You? zone out? No, really.
LEADMALE:I do stretching first, then 20 minutes of low-impact aerobics to get my heart rate up, then a half hour of toning all my problem zones.
SUPFEMALE:It's really made a difference in my life.
LEADFEMALE:You know what's great exercise? Dodging machine-gun fire on a beach.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, 'cause, you know, you get all sweaty, then you could just dive right into the ocean.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:It's so refreshing.
LEADMALE:Hey, iris, how come you're all the time making these demented comments about being blown away and stuff? the truth? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm shell-shocked.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:I stand here all day listening to women bellyache.
LEADFEMALE:It's my way of saying, "shut up, or i'll turn your hair into a bonsai tree.
LEADMALE:" you know, roseanne, if you would exercise every day and get your metabolism going, you could eat anything you want.
OTHERFEMALE:I could eat anything i want.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's right.
SUPMALE:You'd improve your circulation.
SUPFEMALE:You'd have more energy during the day.
OTHERMALE:I could eat anything i want? Half-hour walk every morning would get you into good physical condition.
LEADFEMALE:And help suppress your appetite.
LEADMALE:I could eat anything i want? There's already sugar in that cereal, d.j. tough noogie.
LEADMALE:You know, you should eat more fruit.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like fruit.
LEADMALE:That's because your head looks like an apple.
LEADMALE:Where's mom and dad? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe they're still asleep.
LEADMALE:Jackie: anybody home? Jackson.
SUPMALE:Morning.
SUPFEMALE:They weren't in there.
LEADMALE:What up, jack? Hi.
OTHERMALE:Where's your mom? I'm supposed to give her a ride to work.
SUPMALE:No clue.
SUPMALE:I just checked their bedroom, and nobody's here.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Probably out walking.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Your mom said that they were gonna start walking every morning.
LEADMALE:I think that's great.
LEADFEMALE:You want some toast? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Butter? In the fridge.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt jackie, how come mom is so heavy and you're so thin? Genetics.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god! oh, my god! But it's not all genetics.
LEADMALE:A lot of how much you weigh depends on if you were a heavy kid, 'cause, uh, that's when all your fat cells are formed, you know.
SUPMALE:And then, you only have a certain number of fat cells in your body, and they either get bigger or smaller for the rest of your life.
LEADFEMALE:But i don't think you guys are gonna have a problem 'cause you're all pretty thin.
OTHERMALE:But mom wasn't a heavy kid.
SUPFEMALE:You guys were both the same-it's just a theory, ok? Plus there's also the environment, and there's being pregnant three times and having kids around who need to eat constantly at all hours of the day.
SUPMALE:And there's also extra tartar sauce on her fish sticks and extra mayo on her roast beef and extra roast beef on her kaiser roll.
SUPFEMALE:So basically you're saying mom just eats a lot.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:But, look, she's out exercising.
LEADMALE:She's not exercising.
OTHERFEMALE:You said she's walking.
LEADFEMALE:You know, a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
LEADFEMALE:Awesome.
LEADFEMALE:Did you make that up? Uh-huh.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, how's the walk? Great.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going? To pick up your mom.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dan, i was pretty good today.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too, babe.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i think that walking stuff is really helping 'cause i don't even feel hungry.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come here and sit down and join the family, babe.
LEADFEMALE:You know, ordinarily right now, i'd sure be in the mood for something sweet, but not even interested.
LEADFEMALE:Man: say, when was the last time you tasted real butterscotch? Creamy, smooth butterscotch with walnuts, surrounded by delicious milk chocolate.
LEADFEMALE:Have a yummy bar.
LEADMALE:You deserve it.
LEADFEMALE:You ok? Yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I just i'mi'm going to get a diet soda.
OTHERMALE:Woman: this week only at the king's table-our famous surf 'n' turf platter, which includes a 10-ounce charbroiled filet mignon, a 10-ounce maine lobster tail with drawn butter, and steak fries or creamed spinach, all for only 8.
SUPMALE:99.
SUPFEMALE:Man: at bucky burgers, our burgers are flame-broiled.
LEADFEMALE:Even the bacon we put on our cheeseburgers is flame-broiled.
LEADFEMALE:And we use real cheese, and all our buns are toasted.
LEADFEMALE:So bring the whole family to bucky burgers.
OTHERMALE:I'm hungry! Where are you going? I haven't had one thing.
LEADMALE:I can't take it! Don't do it, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Don't do it.
LEADFEMALE:I want one cookie! I'll walk an extra mile tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll hate yourself tonight! i'll walk 2 miles for one cookie! Darlene, where's those mallomars? Freezer.
LEADMALE:I thought you said one.
LEADFEMALE:I got one for you.
OTHERMALE:I don't want it, and neither do you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, i do, dan! i do! trust me! i do! roseanne! Now, nobody said this was gonna be easy, and it's not gonna be.
LEADFEMALE:Food's a tough thing to beat.
LEADMALE:It's everywhere.
LEADMALE:You can hear it.
LEADMALE:You can smell it.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, if you want to, you can taste it.
LEADFEMALE:But when that big calorie counter in the sky looks down in his book, i want us to do him proud.
SUPFEMALE:There's gonna be calories.
LEADFEMALE:There's gonna be carbohydrates.
LEADFEMALE:But it's our job to keep 'em down, push 'em back, hold 'em to 3, and force a turnover.
OTHERMALE:But we can't eat turnovers! we can't even have pop tarts! We got to zig.
SUPFEMALE:We got to zag.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna stick and move, move, move.
SUPFEMALE:We're the underdogs in this game, but right now we're winning, see.
LEADMALE:But remember, the final score-it's up to us.
OTHERMALE:It's up to us.
LEADFEMALE:It's up to us.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that was very inspiring, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Now, give me those cookies! becky! becky, call vic and rita next door! Well, i put it back, coach.
SUPMALE:Way to go, 37.
LEADMALE:I didn't eat nothing.
LEADMALE:Boy, but i could sure go for seeing that bucky burger commercial again.
LEADFEMALE:You guys were walking for an hour.
OTHERMALE:The olympics are only 2 years away.
LEADFEMALE:Then you still have time.
LEADFEMALE:What event? Child throwing.
OTHERMALE:Maybe i should start getting up and walking with you guys.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:These walks are private.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:Do you guys make out while you're walking? roseanne: dan! what? They fit! they fit! hey! Now let me try 'em on.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i'm so happy.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I did it.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that much or nothing.
LEADFEMALE:It's a small thing.
LEADMALE:But my pants fit, and i feel really good about it.
OTHERMALE:But, you know, if i could do this good, maybe i can do even better.
SUPMALE:Maybe we really can exercise every day, and maybe i really can lose some more weight.
LEADFEMALE:I feel great! That's great, babe.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i have time.
LEADMALE:You know what i'm gonna do? I'm gonna walk to work.
LEADMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm serious.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm really walking to work.
SUPMALE:I think it's about we probably walked farther than that this morning.
LEADMALE:Easy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Maybe i can, like, walk home from work, too.
OTHERFEMALE:I can do that every day.
OTHERFEMALE:That would be, like, an extra 5 miles a day.
LEADFEMALE:Go for it.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna do it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you guys later.
SUPMALE:Bye, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, mommy.
LEADMALE:That's great.
SUPMALE:That is really great.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really proud of your mom.
OTHERMALE:Ooh! It's, like, i'm not walking to work.
OTHERMALE:Captioned by the national chest, back, torso.
LEADFEMALE:And 1, 2, two more.
SUPFEMALE:Together, apart, down, and up.
SUPMALE:Together, apart, down, and up.
LEADFEMALE:And finish.
OTHERMALE:See, you did feel it, right? Oh! Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Can't move.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:So this is your idea of staying out of things.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, alls i'm doing is having a nice little family casual get-together.
LEADMALE:I'm not getting involved.
LEADFEMALE:You can't help yourself, can you? You're an addict.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, she's my sister, and i thought it would be nice to meet her new friend, like the supportive, loving person that i am.
LEADMALE:Ho ho! you're nosy, alice! nosy! I am not getting involved, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Gary! gary, i could just see you holding onto the back of the truck, screaming at sam, "stop! Stop!" i was wearing loafers, too.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, no traction.
LEADMALE:Who's sam? Sam is one of the installers that works for gary's glass company.
SUPMALE:Gary learned the glass business from his uncle, who he used to work for in the summers, so that he could stay in shape for wrestling.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that right? you wrestled? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:165 pounds.
OTHERFEMALE:Wiry and quick.
LEADFEMALE:You are.
LEADFEMALE:I are what? Wiry and quick.
LEADMALE:What does that mean? Oh, i didn't mean quick that way.
LEADMALE:So finish the story.
LEADMALE:Did sam stop, or were you eventually crushed and then freed by the jaws of life? Well, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Now, sam stopped, but--oh, gary, you tell it.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:He stops all of a sudden.
LEADMALE:I fall down.
SUPFEMALE:It pulls all my belt loops off, and i'm sitting on the ground with my belt under my arms.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that a great story? aren't they cute? Well, they can't help but be cute, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:They're young, and they're in love, and they're headed for a ravine.
LEADMALE:Now, now, be supportive.
SUPMALE:I'm trying to be supportive, but she's making me puke.
OTHERMALE:She's acting just like a high school girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, everybody, dinner's ready.
LEADFEMALE:Come and eat, children.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Are they doing that tongue thing? Uh yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I used to work for sherwood plate glass.
LEADMALE:I worked with jim sherwood on a couple of jobs.
OTHERMALE:Nice old guy.
LEADMALE:He's a sly old guy.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think? He's ok.
LEADMALE:He's ok?! How can you be in the same room with this man and say he's ok? I don't know, because maybe i still have partial use of my brain.
OTHERMALE:I want to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:And do good work.
LEADFEMALE:Gary's company's known for its good work.
OTHERFEMALE:Gary's got a reputation.
OTHERMALE:Then you two have got a lot in common.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie's got a reputation for being a good cop.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just starting out on the force, but gary's got a very successful business.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you risk your life every day.
SUPMALE:Um, where's the head? Yonder.
SUPMALE:Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:I'm leaving.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I don't want to hear this, anyway.
OTHERMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Hey, wait yeah, take gary.
SUPFEMALE:For gary.
OTHERFEMALE:Take gary where? Show him the grounds.
LEADMALE:Maybe i'll take him out back and tell him what he's really getting himself into.
LEADMALE:Dan.
SUPMALE:Maybe i'll tell him what a crazy, neurotic family this really is.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
OTHERMALE:Dan maybe i'll tell him that you still got your stuffed animals, and when they're naughty, you get mad at them.
SUPMALE:Well, he's my husband.
SUPMALE:I have to tell him everything.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, gar.
OTHERMALE:You like motorcycles? No, not really.
LEADFEMALE:You like boats? Nah.
LEADMALE:How about a drafty old garage with a lot of good junk laying around? Oh, yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:Come on out.
LEADFEMALE:I'll show you my motorcycle and my boat, and we can stand around and get the flu and you two hens can yak it up.
LEADFEMALE:Yak yak yak yak yak yak.
LEADMALE:Yak yak.
LEADMALE:This is a nice little work area you got here.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, thanks.
LEADMALE:My little escape.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i hear you.
LEADMALE:You must have been married.
SUPFEMALE:No, not yet.
LEADMALE:Um but jackie tells me you and roseanne been together since right out of high school? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hard to believe.
OTHERFEMALE:And you go out and do something completely stupid.
LEADMALE:No, i'm only kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:It's really good.
LEADFEMALE:We're really happy.
SUPMALE:It's ok, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I already know that anything i tell jackie goes right back to roseanne.
LEADMALE:Bingo.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, being single is no bargain, let me tell you.
LEADMALE:It's tough meeting people.
LEADFEMALE:You seem to be doing ok.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Jackie, she's, um she's something.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie's a good kid.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i'm nuts about her, man.
SUPMALE:It's like i can't stop thinking about her.
LEADMALE:And the truth is i don't want to stop thinking about her because, you know, when i'm thinking about her, i'm happy.
LEADMALE:You know what i mean? She's fun.
LEADFEMALE:She's sexy, and she's bright.
LEADMALE:She's a little crazy, too, but that's ok with me, because i could use a little craziness in my life.
LEADMALE:She can provide that.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in love with her, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Have you told her that yet? No way.
LEADFEMALE:That a boy.
SUPFEMALE:Sis? what? I know you really like gary right now, and you're thinking that maybe he's the guy.
LEADMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:I think he is.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he's good, and he's gentle.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't he gentle? And i like his looks.
LEADMALE:You find him attractive, don't you? I just want to say something to you, and i just want you to know the only reason i'm saying it is because i care about you so much.
LEADMALE:What? You don't like him.
LEADFEMALE:Sis.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, what? Tell me.
LEADMALE:I don't want us to get into a fight over this.
LEADMALE:No, we won't get in a fight.
LEADMALE:Ok, 'cause that's not why i'm mentioning it.
SUPFEMALE:Mentioning what? What i'm going to mention.
LEADMALE:What? remember last year, you and that guy tony? Oh, roseanne, give me a break.
LEADFEMALE:Tony! Oh this is nothing like tony.
LEADMALE:With tony, i was this gushing little high school girl.
SUPFEMALE:I was tony's love slave.
OTHERFEMALE:Tony.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, not just with tony, sis.
SUPFEMALE:You've been this way with a lot of guys.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, maybe i have, but with gary, it's different, because gary and i do things that i want to do all the time-or we will.
LEADMALE:We will as soon as there's something that i want to do.
SUPMALE:You're so full of it.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, just drop it.
SUPMALE:Oh, now she doesn't want to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:No, i really don't because you're getting completely defensive.
LEADMALE:No, i'm not being defensive, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:You're more defensive than i am.
LEADMALE:If you have a problem with my boyfriend, why don't you just come out and say so?! Well, he's not taking over my life.
LEADFEMALE:What's that supposed to mean? just forget about it, ok? Never mind.
LEADMALE:We obviously cannot discuss this like two adults, because one of us is a child.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? how am i acting like a child? Oh, forget about it.
LEADMALE:Oh, she can blame it, but she can't name it.
SUPMALE:"i can blame it, but i can't--" you are well, you're yeah, i am so what of it? so what of it? just forget about it, ok? No, not ok.
SUPMALE:Don't you have a little pep rally you want to go on-i can't believe i bring him all the way over here and-i said forget it! ahh! So you want to go out to dinner tonight? Sure, if you do.
SUPFEMALE:What do you feel like? Oh, i'm easy.
LEADFEMALE:What do you feel like? lanford tavern ok? Um, yeah, that's fine.
LEADMALE:No, if you want to go somewhere else-no, l.
LEADMALE:T.
LEADFEMALE:'s fine.
OTHERMALE:I don't know if we can get in.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding me? Sam's brother works there.
OTHERFEMALE:Sam, huh? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, i got to tell you.
LEADMALE:Friday, sam's backing up the truck.
LEADMALE:I said, "let me get out, and i'll help guide you back.
LEADMALE:" so, of course, what does sam say? "no problem.
LEADMALE:Got you covered.
LEADMALE:" yeah.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:So he starts backing up, no idea where he's going, and he just roars the thing backwards without even looking, and stops.
LEADFEMALE:I get out, he's this far from the loading dock.
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you, this guy's got a sixth sense.
SUPMALE:You gotta meet him.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go out with him sometime.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we might as well.
OTHERMALE:You talk about him enough.
LEADFEMALE:But what if i meet sam, and all he does is tell gary stories? Well, you'll probably love those.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you at work with sam and the glass truck.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what's the matter? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:I'm i'm just feeling a little tired, that's all.
LEADMALE:Well, no wonder.
LEADFEMALE:You just used up a lot of energy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but i was tired before i used up all that energy.
LEADMALE:You should have said something.
SUPMALE:I thought you'd be mad at me.
SUPFEMALE:Mad at you? No, i'm but i am mad at you for making love with me when you didn't really want to make love with me.
LEADMALE:See? I knew you'd be mad at me.
LEADMALE:Jackie, all you had to do was say something.
LEADMALE:It's ok.
SUPMALE:It's no big deal.
SUPMALE:A lot of people don't like to make love at the same time.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Jackie, you don't have to be sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Right! So next time you'll just tell me, ok? Right, right.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:So, how about dinner? you still feel like going out? Yeah, if you do.
LEADFEMALE:I've had it, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I have really, really had it.
LEADMALE:It's true, you know? All we ever wind up doing is what he wants to do.
OTHERMALE:If we want to go out and eat, he picks the restaurant.
LEADMALE:If when we want to watch the tv, he gets to hold the remote.
SUPMALE:Do we ever come over and just hang around with you and dan? No.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe he's making all the decisions because you're sitting there grinning like an idiot and letting him make all the decisions.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you see, what he does is, he lets me let him make all the decisions.
SUPFEMALE:He knows that i don't want to watch cable sports news.
SUPFEMALE:Well, have you told him that? No.
LEADMALE:But he should know.
LEADMALE:I shouldn't have to tell him that.
LEADMALE:No, he should be able to read your mind.
LEADFEMALE:No, but, you know you know, rosie, he should know me better than that by now, i mean, you'd think.
OTHERFEMALE:You know you are really messing up a good thing here.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you meet a guy-a really nice guy, and you're blowing it.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, you really do like him? Jackie! Well, i'm afraid that if i tell him all this stuff about me, then he won't like me so much because maybe he's one of those guys who only likes women that he can control.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now, you would like to find out about that.
LEADFEMALE:And if it is true, then you don't want him around anyway.
OTHERMALE:I don't? No.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez, you are a-you have your own moods, you have your own thoughts, you have your own opinions.
SUPFEMALE:You're a 3-dimensional human being here.
SUPMALE:He doesn't even know me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe that's because you've been acting like gidget on an aphrodisiac for that past three weeks.
SUPFEMALE:It's just i like him so much, and i want him to like me.
LEADFEMALE:Then just give him a chance to know the real you.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, maybe he'll like that girl just as much.
LEADMALE:I can't take that chance, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You said you were going to talk to him.
LEADMALE:I am being supportive.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, stay out of this.
LEADFEMALE:I am staying out of this.
LEADMALE:So, did you talk to him? why do you have to go? at 11:30? Don't tell me gary's coming over.
OTHERMALE:Well, if you don't want him to come over, then why don't you just call him up and tell him that you don't want him to come over? No, that's stupid.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna make him mad.
SUPMALE:You're just gonna end up getting mad at yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:She wants to be by herself, but she's going to let him come over and spend the night.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't they just, you know then he can split? Oh, ick! You better talk to him.
LEADMALE:If you're tired, just call and tell him that you're tired.
LEADMALE:There's nothing wrong with that, but you better--yeah.
OTHERMALE:Ok, ok, but you better talk to him, and then you call me in the morning, ok? Or else i'll just pop over, and we'll have breakfast or something.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ok, bye.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Now, turn off the light.
SUPMALE:She is just totally gone over this guy.
SUPMALE:She's so infatuated, she does whatever he tells her to do.
LEADFEMALE:And she never says anything to him.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she's just like this puppet, and he's just, like, pulling on her strings.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, stay out of this.
LEADMALE:It's awful, because if she doesn't speak up, she is, like, going to blow it with this guy, and i really can't stand to see her do that again.
SUPMALE:Please, i beg you.
OTHERMALE:She's my sister.
LEADMALE:Stay out of jackie's love life.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe i would if i had one of my own.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:If that's what it takes.
SUPMALE:Yeah? It's me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, jackie, let me in.
LEADMALE:I got to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? Nothing.
LEADMALE:I'm just sitting around.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what i'm talking about, jackie.
LEADMALE:What is going on? I mean you say it's ok for me to come over, then you call me back and tell me no, no, maybe i shouldn't come over.
LEADMALE:And then you say, "no, really, it's ok, come on over.
LEADMALE:" i think you owe me better than that.
LEADMALE:I owe you? Well, yeah, you owe me.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, look, you got a problem with this relationship, yeah, i think at least you owe me the courtesy of telling me, face to face.
LEADMALE:You know, just say, "look, gary, even though you're the greatest guy "i ever met, and even though "this is the best relationship "and the best sex i've ever had, "for some unforeseen, ridiculous reason, i want to break it off.
LEADFEMALE:" so, then, you think whatever reason i might have is just ridiculous? Amazing.
LEADFEMALE:Of everything that i just said, that's the one thing you focus on? You couldn't have come back to me with, "gee, gary, you really think it's the best relationship?" or, "gee, you really think it's the best sex?" no.
LEADFEMALE:Because just you implied that any reason i might have is gonna be ridiculous, anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, what are we talking about here? Look, you got something you want to say to me, i don't think it's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:I want to hear it.
SUPMALE:Anything you have to say, i want to hear.
SUPMALE:You know, as a matter of fact, i'd like to hear you say something for a change.
SUPFEMALE:Why do i have to decide everything all the time? you know? This is our relationship, it's not my relationship.
LEADMALE:It's our relationship.
LEADMALE:Help me fly the damn plane.
LEADMALE:See, i knew this would happen if we slept together.
LEADFEMALE:What? All this all this complicated and all the conversations and all this arguing.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, this isn't complicated.
SUPMALE:This is very simple.
OTHERMALE:I'm in love with you, and all of a sudden you don't want to see me.
LEADMALE:Why? what did i do? you're in love with me? hello? Just a minute.
LEADMALE:Just give me one sec.
LEADFEMALE:Did you talk to gary? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Hang on a sec.
LEADMALE:I can't hear you in here.
SUPMALE:You didn't call me after he left last night.
SUPMALE:I'm assuming he came over, knowing you're such a wimp.
LEADMALE:You probably didn't tell him what you said were going to say.
LEADMALE:I'm not a wimp, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Do you have any coffee? No.
SUPFEMALE:So, did you talk to him? Yeah, i talked to him.
SUPFEMALE:Ok? Hey, you're the one that was upset last night.
LEADMALE:Hey, you got coffee.
LEADMALE:You're sitting there, "oh, hi.
LEADMALE:I just want to be by myself.
LEADMALE:"i don't want gary to come over.
SUPMALE:" so, did you end up talking to him, or did you let him come over and then talk to him? You know, roseanne, you got a big mouth.
SUPFEMALE:I guess i do.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you do.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot.
LEADMALE:Well, no need to thank me.
LEADMALE:Good-bye, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Gary, could you excuse us for a couple minutes? I'd like to talk to jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Gary, just stay right where you are.
LEADMALE:Gary, could you just, like, go in the bathroom for a minute? Um, i'll--i'll just um.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i'll be in here.
OTHERMALE:Nice butt.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know he was in the bathroom.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, you did.
OTHERMALE:No, i didn't.
SUPFEMALE:What difference would it make, anyway? I mean you wouldn't have said nothing to him-if you hadn't opened your big mouth.
LEADMALE:Yeah, because i know how much you really like this guy.
OTHERFEMALE:Shut up.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:You didn't tell him that, either? what are you trying to do? I'm just trying to help.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't need your help, ok? i'm doing ok by myself, because you know why? That man standing in my bathroom right now loves me.
LEADFEMALE:No, he doesn't love you.
SUPFEMALE:He loves perfect woman.
OTHERFEMALE:The woman with no opinions.
SUPMALE:Well, perfect woman just happens to be in this body right now.
LEADFEMALE:And who knows? Maybe i can actually become perfect woman.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been pulling it off for four weeks, so what the hell? It's working out pretty nice.
LEADMALE:He loves me, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Why would i want to mess that up? Or, no.
OTHERMALE:Why would you want me to mess that up? I don't, but this isn't even you.
LEADMALE:You're losing yourself in this guy.
OTHERFEMALE:He loves me, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not responsible to you anymore.
SUPMALE:Hey, i'll--i'll call you, ok? Here.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I want you out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:You're going to kick me out of your apartment? Yeah, i'm going to kick you out of my apartment.
LEADMALE:And i want you to butt out of my life.
OTHERMALE:Come on, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Good-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Captioned by the national there's a somebody i'm longin' to see i hope that he turns out to be someone who'll watch over me-e-e someone who'll watch over me
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Mom, who invented the iron? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Probably some man.
SUPMALE:Actually, that's not true.
SUPFEMALE:It was invented by a woman-yolanda i-ron.
OTHERMALE:I believe she was a romanian, determined to drive the crease problem out of central europe.
LEADMALE:What happened to her? She was killed.
SUPMALE:Where are you going? Budget club.
SUPMALE:Yeah, can i come? I'm taking the harley.
LEADFEMALE:You can't carry nothing on that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just going for small stuff-you know, like batteries.
SUPFEMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:I have friends of my own.
SUPMALE:I'll just go out by myself later.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just call jackie and straighten this whole thing out.
SUPMALE:No! Besides, i did, and she won't talk to me.
LEADMALE:Mom, i think this belongs to aunt jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, put it in the box.
LEADFEMALE:Are you guys still not talking? I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you must've really messed up this time, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, becky, you know, sometimes you and your sister get mad at each other-not for anything in particular.
LEADMALE:Just one of you will do something really stupid, next thing you know, you're fighting.
LEADFEMALE:Or not even something stupid.
LEADMALE:Just, you know, something that was none of your mother's business-your sister's business.
LEADMALE:Bye, dan.
LEADMALE:See you.
LEADFEMALE:So what are you going to do today? you gonna play with, uh, diane? We're going to the mall, mom.
SUPFEMALE:That's cool.
LEADMALE:I'll drive you down there, and then i'll just come in, you know, look around.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you're becoming a leech.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just call crystal? Yeah, play with someone your own age.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:You've reached the conner party line.
SUPFEMALE:If you weren't still fighting with aunt jackie, you wouldn't be hanging out with crystal every day.
OTHERMALE:Well, that isn't true, and one thing has nothing to do with the other.
LEADMALE:I have just as much fun with crystal as i ever did with your aunt jackie.
LEADMALE:Mom, it's crystal.
OTHERFEMALE:She wants to know what time you're coming over to help organize her plates.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:For you.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:They're beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:What? i said they're beautiful! How can you think with the music this loud? I can't.
LEADFEMALE:That's why i like it loud.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Nothing.
LEADMALE:I'm just getting rid of stuff, throwing away junk i don't need anymore.
LEADMALE:Hey, did you, uh-you know, i know it's none of my business, but, uh, did you talk to your sister yet? No.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, jackie, it's been 3 weeks.
LEADMALE:I mean, i feel really bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Some of this is my fault.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's not your fault, gar.
OTHERMALE:It's no big deal, really.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes we don't talk at all.
LEADMALE:You don't want to deal with it, that's ok.
LEADMALE:But, you know, my brother and i don't speak.
SUPFEMALE:We--we never write, we never visit, nothing, and i think that's pretty sad.
LEADMALE:Oh, that is sad.
LEADMALE:You should at least write.
OTHERMALE:We're not talking about me, jackie.
LEADMALE:Can we? Just let me say one thing.
LEADFEMALE:I think that it is very sad that 2 sisters, that are living in the same city, aren't even speaking to each other.
SUPMALE:Especially when i'm in love with one of 'em.
LEADMALE:Ohh! I thought maybe we could do something special today.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:What? Oh, hold that thought.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan, how you doing? Hi, dan.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? Oh, i just came by to see my sister-in-law.
LEADFEMALE:Is that so unusual? Well, it's just that you never did it before, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i have now.
LEADMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:So, how's the job? the kids? my sister? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, i just wanted, you know-you got company, so no, what? Well, you know, i haven't seen you around.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanted to say hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Dan can we talk? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, gary, this is just family stuff.
OTHERMALE:I'll only be a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, no problem.
SUPFEMALE:You want to go in the bedroom? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Listen, i, uh you know listen, jackie, i think i'm gonna take a walk down to the corner.
LEADFEMALE:You need anything? No, gar, no.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:We'll just be a second.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to go.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, tell him he doesn't have to go.
SUPFEMALE:I'd kill for a root beer.
LEADMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Ok, what? all right, let me say first first of all that i've never poked my nose into your business, correct? Correct.
LEADMALE:Up till 10 minutes ago, i never thought i ever would.
LEADMALE:And i appreciate that, dan.
SUPMALE:You're welcome.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, as we all know, does poke her nose in.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:But we also know that if she ever thought that anything she ever did hurt you, it would tear her up.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You're one of the most important people in her life.
SUPFEMALE:And right now she's sitting at home hanging out with crystal, trying to act like everything's ok, but everything's not ok.
LEADFEMALE:It's ok with me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's not ok with roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:She's hurting.
SUPMALE:You not talking to her is really hurting her.
LEADMALE:She's tough.
SUPMALE:She'll get over it.
LEADFEMALE:She needs you, jackie.
SUPMALE:You shutting her out like this is too much.
SUPMALE:You've got to call her.
LEADMALE:No, i can't.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, i'm asking you.
SUPMALE:Dan.
OTHERMALE:So, i'm just supposed to let her treat me like the kid sister for the rest of my life? No, no.
LEADMALE:You're absolutely right.
SUPFEMALE:You're not a kid anymore.
LEADMALE:That's right, dan.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:And maybe she'll learn.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe next time she'll think before she opens her big fat mouth.
SUPMALE:Hey, jackie, that's the way roseanne is.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come on, i'm asking you to be the big sister here.
LEADMALE:Dan, it hurts me, too, you know.
SUPFEMALE:You think i like not talking to my own sister? I don't like it, either, but she started it.
SUPFEMALE:That's the maturity i was looking for.
LEADFEMALE:Well, roseanne and i will just have to work it out on our own.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, i took a shot.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for stopping by.
SUPFEMALE:So, uh, if you didn't do anything, how come you're not talking? Well, i i didn't mean to do anything, you know.
LEADFEMALE:It's just jackie, she's always screwing up every relationship with every guy, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I thought maybe if i pointed out to her her stupid behavior before she made a total ass out of herself, that maybe she wouldn't do it.
LEADFEMALE:So basically, you stuck your nose in where it didn't belong.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:But you did it with the best of intentions.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And you never thought for a moment that it might hurt jackie.
LEADFEMALE:No, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now, she's your sister.
LEADMALE:I hesitate to say anything bad about jackie.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, go ahead.
SUPMALE:Well, if i had a sister who loved me enough to risk sticking her neck out by saying something that might make a difference in a meaningful relationship with a handsome, sexy, independently employed guy who lives right down the street from yours truly, well, i'd be nothing but grateful.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Well, of course, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:What you did, you did out of love and caring.
OTHERMALE:And jackie knows you well enough to know that sometimes you do stupid, insensitive things, but with the best of intentions.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, thanks, crystal.
SUPFEMALE:Well, and if she can't see that, well, she's just as nasty as can be, and you should tell her.
OTHERMALE:Well, she won't even talk to me.
SUPMALE:Well, uh, well, that's the stupidest thing i ever heard.
OTHERFEMALE:You--you get jackie on the phone right now.
OTHERFEMALE:You tell her that's not the way sisters treat one another.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's--i am.
LEADMALE:I'm calling her up right now.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna tell her to just get over it.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Jackie? Hi, it's me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's good.
OTHERMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, i think we need to talk.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we both yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Well? She's coming right over.
SUPMALE:You see? She knows she's wrong.
OTHERMALE:Ohh! Oh, jeez, i'm back.
SUPMALE:I know you're back, but, honey, i got to go now.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:You and i have to have a little talk.
SUPMALE:Well, no, gary, we can talk later because i told roseanne i'd come over and talk to her.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's great, but that can wait just another 10 minutes.
SUPMALE:I don't want to put it off any longer.
OTHERFEMALE:Gary, gary.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, now ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, um boy.
LEADMALE:I'm in love with you, jackie, and, um, you're in love with me.
LEADMALE:You're absolutely right.
LEADFEMALE:And i'm glad we talked about it.
SUPFEMALE:Do you feel better? I know i do.
LEADMALE:But, gary, i've really got to go.
LEADFEMALE:You know how important this is, so you stay here, put your feet up, have a beer-jackie? I'll be back as soon as i can.
LEADMALE:Let's get married! All right.
LEADFEMALE:Becky.
LEADFEMALE:Becky: what? Get down here right away, quick.
OTHERMALE:Ok, your aunt jackie's here.
LEADMALE:When she comes in, tell her i'm not here.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Just tell her i was waiting around for a really long time.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her i got mad, and then i left.
OTHERFEMALE:Where you going? I'm going to my bedroom.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not gonna lie for you.
SUPMALE:I'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:Good, you do it.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Jackson, long time no see.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
LEADFEMALE:Mom's not here.
LEADFEMALE:She's not? Nope.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i got a little hung up.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, she waited for you for over an hour, then she stomped around for another hour throwing shoes.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, god, she's mad.
SUPMALE:I mean, really, really mad.
SUPFEMALE:Wasn't she? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I got to go upstairs.
LEADMALE:How come her car's here? Well, because she was so angry, that i told her she shouldn't drive.
OTHERFEMALE:You and becky doing some saturday cleaning? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know, just trying to do our share.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't be lying to me, darlene, would you? are you calling me a liar? your favorite niece? I wouldn't go back there.
SUPMALE:We haven't cleaned back there.
LEADFEMALE:Really good try, darlene, really good.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne? who is it? Ok, kill me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i was on my way over here-hey, hey, hey! If this sentence has the word "gary" in it, i am going to throw this book at you.
LEADMALE:And it's james michener, so you better watch out.
OTHERFEMALE:I was on my way over here when the man i'm seeing-oh, you have to do everything he says.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, will you stop it? stop it? You're the one going around saying he's like totally controlling everything.
OTHERMALE:And then i try to help, you get all mixed up and backwards, you start calling me the bad guy, then you can't even show up on time to apologize.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't come over here to apologize to you, i came over here to forgive you.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, sorry.
OTHERMALE:Ok, apology accepted.
OTHERFEMALE:So you couldn't, like, pick up the phone and call me? No, i was kind of in the middle of something.
LEADMALE:Oh, please, spare me.
SUPMALE:It's not what you're thinking.
LEADFEMALE:So then you should've called.
LEADFEMALE:You want to know what we were doing? No, i really don't care what you and gary were doing.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, he proposed to me.
LEADMALE:Aah! aah! I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:You'll get married in the spring.
LEADFEMALE:You'll get married in our back yard.
LEADMALE:We'll move the truck and the station wagon.
SUPMALE:It'll be great! This'll be great.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you come down to the beauty shop and they'll do your hair.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, not that marsha chick.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, she's a butcher.
LEADFEMALE:Iris.
LEADFEMALE:Iris is so good.
LEADMALE:Oh, we've got to tell dan, and you've got to get a dress.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i think we should call mom.
LEADMALE:Now, roseanne, wait.
LEADMALE:Hold on a second.
SUPFEMALE:Let's not go so fast.
SUPMALE:Now, spring is soon.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Spring is soon.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so? So i just don't think that we should dive into anything.
LEADMALE:You know, you're the one who told me i shouldn't be acting like a high-school kid.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do i know? Hey, it's your life.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:I know, but, roseanne, see, i'm still doing it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm letting him make all the decisions.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, that doesn't matter.
SUPFEMALE:You know, even about the wedding.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, we didn't even discuss it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's no big deal.
LEADMALE:So, he just said, "let's get married.
OTHERFEMALE:" and then i kind of went, "all right.
SUPFEMALE:" aah! aah! Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god, i just thought of something.
LEADMALE:What? Ok.

SUPFEMALE:I'll talk to you later, ok? Good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:So? gary? There's something i want to talk to you about.
LEADMALE:Ok, i'm here.
LEADMALE:Brought my ears.
LEADMALE:Talk to me.
OTHERMALE:Gary? I'm notthe woman that you've been going out with.
LEADMALE:I mean, i'm not this always agreeable, always willing to do whatever you say, "gee, let's have another box of dots" kind of woman.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Good what? Good that you're a real person and not sandy duncan with a badge.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i--that's-i'm a real person, gary.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i know that.
LEADMALE:Who wants to marry someone who's perfect? You could never win an argument with 'em.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i despise wearing make-up.
LEADFEMALE:And because of you, i've been wearing it every single day now for 9 weeks.
OTHERMALE:What, was that 'cause i came over here with a shotgun and some blush? No, i'm just-i'm telling you, gary, there's a whole other person inside of here that you don't know anything about.
OTHERFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:I don't like watching cable sports news.
LEADMALE:There, i've said it.
LEADMALE:And if you want to leave, i don't blame you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we don't have to watch cable sports.
OTHERFEMALE:I can watch it alone.
SUPFEMALE:Quite frankly, i don't like watching it with you anyway.
LEADFEMALE:You're annoying.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, fine.
LEADMALE:Leave.
SUPFEMALE:That doesn't mean that i want to leave, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:That just means that we don't do everything together.
LEADFEMALE:Gary, i will always say that i never blamed you.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going anywhere.
SUPMALE:Was that the big thing you wanted to get off your chest? Oh, gary.
SUPMALE:Gary, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
LEADMALE:Honey sometimes at night i lie in bed and bite my nails and spit them across the room.
LEADMALE:You know what? I lie in bed some nights listening to you bite your nails and spitting them across the room.
SUPMALE:And i pretend like i'm asleep so that you can keep doing it.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i've got my sports, you've got your nails, hmm? Or you did.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i want to spend my life with you.
LEADMALE:You got a problem with that? I--i am also very, very close with my sister.
SUPFEMALE:We talk on the phone like 3, 4 times a day.
LEADFEMALE:And i got no problem with that at all.
SUPFEMALE:I think roseanne's great.
LEADFEMALE:She and i spend an awful lot of time together.
SUPMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:I like going over there.
SUPMALE:No, you don't.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm lying so you'll marry me.
OTHERMALE:No, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:Look i love you, and i love being part of your life.
OTHERFEMALE:And so far, there's nothing about your life i don't love.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you haven't met my mother yet.
LEADFEMALE:I'll cross that bridge when i come to it.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, you're going to want to blow up that bridge when you come to it.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what do you say? you want to do something tonight? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:What? Whatever you want.
LEADMALE:You call it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, um sex? Good call.
LEADMALE:Oh, i got lucky.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene, imagine aunt jackie wearing this.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
OTHERFEMALE:Gary will say, "i don't.
LEADFEMALE:" hey, quiet, you two, or you ain't getting invited.
LEADMALE:How can you not invite us to something at our own house? Because i have total power.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm the caterer.
LEADFEMALE:I think your sister's here.
SUPFEMALE:Why? 'cause her and her beau pulled up out front.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, dad, can't you see aunt jackie in one of these? I don't know, babe.
SUPFEMALE:I think aunt jackie's body might reject a white dress.
LEADMALE:Oh, dan, come on, there's nothing saying she can't wear a white dress.
SUPMALE:I wore white.
SUPMALE:I don't recall asking any of you for your opinion.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Cut it out, you guys.
LEADMALE:Hi, deej, how you doing? Great.
LEADMALE:You gonna have kids? Well, maybe someday, when she's very, very old.
LEADMALE:Yes, maybe someday, deej.
LEADMALE:Ok, everybody get out of here because me and sis has to talk.
LEADMALE:Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Well, gary can go play with dan.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, come on out back.
LEADMALE:I'll show you my fort.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be in the fort.
LEADMALE:Can i come? Yeah, come on.
OTHERMALE:So, it looks like we're gonna have an uncle gary.
LEADMALE:Yeah, looks like.
SUPMALE:Now scram.
SUPMALE:Oh, i got bad news.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not that bad, but it's kind of shocking.
LEADMALE:Ok, i was reading here in farmer's almanac.
LEADFEMALE:They predict a lot more rain this spring than normal.
LEADMALE:And then, you know, this tent thing, that's really, really expensive.
OTHERMALE:So i was thinking maybe we have to move it in the house.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I think maybe we'll move inside.
LEADFEMALE:But that's ok, because, oh, it's still gonna be a beautiful, beautiful wedding.
SUPFEMALE:And i have to do this one thing, and i need you to help me with it.
LEADMALE:Now what are you doing? Well, if we're gonna moving it from outside to inside, i was thinking about what i could do to reorganizing everything, you know, because it's like a whole different thing, and i wasn't planning for it.
LEADFEMALE:So i thought, well, we can use this.
LEADFEMALE:You come down here no, no.
LEADMALE:And then you're right here, and then just practice throwing the bouquet.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Just to see what it looks like.
SUPFEMALE:Just do it to see.
LEADMALE:Over your shoulder like that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god, no.
LEADMALE:I'm not going to do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, just go do it.
LEADMALE:I wish you would slow down about this.
SUPMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:I am.
SUPMALE:I'm not getting all excited or anything.
LEADFEMALE:But i was thinking i'll hang some christmas lights over the archway there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Ok, you're up there, all the women are down here.
LEADFEMALE:They're going, "throw me.
LEADFEMALE:"throw it to me.
OTHERFEMALE:"pick me.
LEADMALE:I want to catch it.
SUPFEMALE:I want to catch it.
OTHERFEMALE:" roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Just throw it, would you? Roseanne.
LEADMALE:"i want to catch it!" roseanne, we're not getting married.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, we are, but not just this second.
OTHERMALE:What happened? Nothing.
LEADMALE:We just decided we needed to talk about it some more.
OTHERMALE:Now i'm not going to have my wedding.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you're married.
LEADFEMALE:This is about me.
LEADMALE:Oh, bummer.
LEADFEMALE:See, what happened was, you know, he proposed, and then i just said all right.
OTHERMALE:Which wasn't a definite yes.
SUPFEMALE:It wasn't a no, either, but we just decided we need to discuss it a lot more.
LEADMALE:Well, what'd you say? how did you handle it? I think i handled it really well.
LEADFEMALE:What did you say? I just was very straightforward and very adult.
LEADFEMALE:And i said that i thought we should take it one step at a time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how come you're assertive now? Basically, we decided that we would go steady.
LEADFEMALE:And then, if that went well, we would get engaged, and then eventually we would do what you and dan did.
LEADMALE:Well, just say it, jackie.
SUPMALE:Say, "me and gary are gonna get married.
LEADMALE:" wellwe might.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Where is roxanne? I don't want jacques to get overtired, and i've got to get to my bridge game by 3:00.
LEADMALE:Debbi, cindy lou's got a new line of nail colors.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, this is really pretty.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:You know, i talked to marsha about maybe using some cindy lou products in the salon.
LEADFEMALE:Where's she at? The dentist.
SUPMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Zzzz! zzzz! ooh! ooh! Iris, don't even kid.
LEADMALE:Zzzz! ooh! Come here, you little squirrel on a rope.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there you are, my little pumpkin.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, and i have your little dog with me.
OTHERMALE:Did he make? I don't know, although there was one point where it was harder to drag him.
LEADMALE:There you go, mrs.
LEADMALE:Wellman.
LEADMALE:You're all done.
LEADMALE:You look just like sandra dee in gidget goes hawaiian.
LEADFEMALE:Oh-ho.
LEADMALE:Wonderful.
LEADMALE:Now if i hurry, i can just make my game.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Iris, would you please? oh, roxanne, would you be a dear and hold on to jacques? He likes to jump from high places.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i'll take you walking over the bridge next time.
LEADMALE:Oh, roxanne, would you be a dear and yeah.
OTHERMALE:It'll be $15.
LEADMALE:And give me 2 for iris.
LEADMALE:That's all right.
LEADMALE:You don't have to tip me, mrs.
LEADMALE:Wellman.
LEADFEMALE:After all, i only shampooed your hair, brought you coffee, put quarters in your meter, and walked your little dog.
LEADMALE:And don't think i don't appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:Now could you just get my coat and carry jacques out to my car? I'm parked right around the corner in front of that korean market.
SUPMALE:I hope they haven't watered my car.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to spoil debbi's lovely work.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to go ahead and go on to the bank.
OTHERMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Allow me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you, roxanne.
LEADMALE:Come on, jacques, you little mutt.
LEADFEMALE:I think that's disgusting.
LEADMALE:You mean meg? Yeah, i mean meg.
SUPMALE:That women walked all over roseanne for 11 years and she's still doing it.
SUPMALE:She's rich.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't know any better.
SUPMALE:Ohh! Ooh, sounds like that i can't see anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, meg! What happened? Oh, crystal, i can't talk now.
OTHERFEMALE:Ohh! Oh, this is terrible.
LEADMALE:Liz? Liz! It's meg.
OTHERFEMALE:I've had an accident, and i'm gonna have to miss the game.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to take jacques straight to the hospital.
LEADMALE:He seemsshaken.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Oh, i rear-ended that shampoo girl.
LEADFEMALE:Ro-roseanne! Oh now everything's gonna be just fine.
LEADFEMALE:Your mom wasn't hurt, and neither was mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Wellman.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what your dad told me, and i know that your father wouldn't lie to me.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i don't believe in sparing people the truth, especially not when she's my sister, but i just--i don't think that your father would do something like that, you know? Becky.
LEADMALE:What? I don't think that your father would keep anything from me.
LEADFEMALE:Do you? aunt jackie, just relax, ok? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Mom's not dead.
SUPFEMALE:No, she's not dead.
SUPMALE:Of course not.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Everything's fine, huh? Everything's fine, just like what we said.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything's just fine.
LEADMALE:They're home! Oh, my god, roseanne.
SUPMALE:She's a little spacey.
LEADMALE:Mom, that neck thing's neat.
OTHERFEMALE:Can i have it? hee hee hee hee! How is meg again? Meg's fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Mmm.
SUPFEMALE:Oahh-boom! Oh, god, she's blasted.
SUPFEMALE:They gave her muscle relaxers.
OTHERFEMALE:She'll sleep it off.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna turn down the bed.
LEADMALE:Look at this! look it! hee hee hee hee! ooh! ooh! Oh, this room's nice.
SUPMALE:It needs to be cleaned up.
LEADMALE:Mmm! Yum, yum, yum.
LEADMALE:Yum, yum, yum, yum.
OTHERFEMALE:Yum happy! Oh, no, no, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:No, we don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:She's really out of it.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you didn't fly through the windshield or anything, did you? No, but i'd like to try that sometime.
SUPMALE:She had her seat belt on.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i'll get it.
OTHERMALE:Jackie: oh, well-hello.
LEADFEMALE:Now, they said they'd call back.
LEADFEMALE:The station wagon may be totaled.
LEADMALE:Yes! yeah! I hope you know a good attorney.
SUPMALE:I know an attorney.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:And i want to see a copy of that accident report.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, honey.
SUPMALE:No! Ooh, ooh.
OTHERFEMALE:Get chichi.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i hope that we have all learned a very, very important lesson here today.
SUPMALE:What? That is exactly the reason why we always wear our all: seat belts.
OTHERMALE:You know, cops got a saying-you never pull a dead man out of a seat belt.
OTHERFEMALE:What, do you just leave them there? Some cops do.
LEADFEMALE:I don't.
SUPFEMALE:Now, mom, i don't want you to move or anything, ok? Just tell me how to work your sewing machine.
LEADMALE:What are you sewing? Just a hem.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ok.
LEADMALE:You know the power switch? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Turn it off, put it back in the case, then bring your mother a needle and a thread, and she'll do it.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, do you want anything from the drugstore? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Bring me back a woman's world and a big back of cheetos.
OTHERMALE:D.j. : bring me something.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to need money.
LEADMALE:Well, go find my purse.
LEADMALE:Oh, look.
LEADMALE:Here it is.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, this five's good.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you to bring me back change.
LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Keeping your mommy company? We're reading.
SUPMALE:Why don't you take a walk with darlene down to the drugstore? I'm broke.
LEADMALE:Darlene's got bread.
LEADMALE:I just gave her 5 bucks.
LEADMALE:Ooh, boy! Got you some lunch.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i don't feel like eating right now, honey.
LEADMALE:Where did you get them flowers? Oh, the girls at the beauty shop had 'em sent by.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that was nice.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:How you feeling? how do i look? how you feeling? I finally get some time off from work, and i can't do a damn thing.
SUPFEMALE:The kids are in there eating canned spaghetti.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, they like canned spaghetti.
SUPMALE:Well, not for breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, don't you worry about it.
LEADFEMALE:You just worry about getting yourself better.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:I got too much other stuff to worry about, like bills and the mortgage and all that kind of stuff.
LEADMALE:And what if i miss another week of work or another month? You know, i could lose my job.
LEADMALE:Ok, tallulah, drama hour's over.
LEADFEMALE:You know what bugs me the worst of this whole thing? That old cow mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Wellman can't even call to see if i'm ok.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, we're gonna hit bossy where it hurts.
SUPMALE:Remember peter lundy, the attorney? he's an attorney? Of course, he's an attorney.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Does he have any clients? Yep.
OTHERFEMALE:Us.
LEADMALE:Us.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I got him on a retainer.
LEADMALE:Oh, you've got him on retainer? Well, he stiffed me on a driveway job last year.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, he's coming by tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:For what? Well, i told him you were hurt, and he said if the injury was serious enough, a lawsuit may be worth talking about.
LEADMALE:A lawsuit? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You want to get meg wellman, don't you? Well, yeah, of course, but i mean i ain't hurt that bad.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just--you know, i'm just a little stiff.
SUPMALE:Ohh! god! Honey.
LEADMALE:Help me! Honey, honey, honey.
LEADMALE:Ooh, it hurts.
SUPMALE:It hurts.
LEADMALE:It hurts.
OTHERFEMALE:Ow, ow, ow, ow.
SUPFEMALE:You all right? It hurts.
SUPMALE:Ohh.
SUPMALE:Think you could do that in court? honey, you remember peter lundy? Uh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Hi, peter.
LEADMALE:How's the law business treating you? Oh, it's good, roseanne.
LEADMALE:It's good.
SUPFEMALE:I'm, uh, i'm sorry to hear about your little mishap.
SUPFEMALE:So tell us how we can own the wellman ranch.
LEADMALE:You could, uh--let's see, we can make an offer, see if she wants to sell it.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! Probably not what you meant, huh? My husband is interested in a lawsuit, you know, if you think that's the thing we should do.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, like i said over the phone, i'd be happy to give whatever advice i can, maybe even write a threatening letter, though the last one of those i wrote, i nearly got sued.
LEADMALE:Well, that's encouraging.
SUPFEMALE:You know, if this thing gets to where you actually want to file suit, i'd like to, uh i'd like to recommend another attorney, one that specializes in personal injury actions.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think you could handle this? Oh, trust me, i'm not your guy, especially if it means going to court.
SUPMALE:Whew, not--not-not--not good in court.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, are you any good at referrals? Oh, best in the business.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, if i recommend another lawyer to you, you'll do great.
OTHERFEMALE:If i handle it, nope.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we appreciate your honesty.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, hopefully, this lady's counsel will get her to settle out of court, save us a lot of time and money.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? you think we can do that? Oh, probably not, but we can give it a try.
LEADMALE:Uh, would it be unethical for us to refer him to represent mrs.
LEADMALE:Wellman? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Let me just go over a few things with you, mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, make sure i got everything straight.
LEADFEMALE:I just need to take a few notes.
SUPMALE:Do you, uh, have a pen? uh pen? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Oh, nope, nope, nope.
LEADFEMALE:Eureka.
SUPMALE:Found it.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, if you're going to be involved in a personal injury type situation, you can't keep taking that neck brace off.
LEADFEMALE:No, you have to stay in bed, uh, suspend normal activity, and, you know, don't drive, 'cause one good jolt, and bop! There goes mr.
SUPFEMALE:Spine.
LEADFEMALE:So, your honor, how much actual cash do you think we'll see out of this if we sue mrs.
LEADMALE:Wellman? Well, uh, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:That's if we actually sue mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Wellman and win? Yeah, yeah, assuming we win.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, then you could be entitled to as much as, say, oh, three times the medical bills and the lost income.
SUPMALE:I'll see you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for stopping by.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Three times? This is great.
SUPFEMALE:So if the doctor bill was $500, we get $1,500! if it's $1,000, that's $3,000! if it's $5,000, that's $15,000! or if it's $1 million billion, we get $3 million billion jillion! Dad, we have to buy a new house.
LEADMALE:We got to clean this one first.
SUPMALE:They're building some real nice ones around elmridge.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We can get a cleaning lady to come in a couple times a week.
LEADFEMALE:We're not buying a new house and we're not getting a maid.
SUPMALE:Well, how about a vcr? Maybe.
LEADMALE:Yes! yes! we can rent movies! Mrs.
LEADMALE:Wellman said she was running late and was in a hurry.
OTHERMALE:So she could have been speeding or possibly distracted because she was thinking of something else.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Know that the department appreciates the help.
SUPMALE:So now, jackie, excuse me for interfering, but is this really police business or is this personal 'cause it's your sister? This is police business, crystal, that happens to affect me personally.
LEADMALE:So roseanne decided to sue meg? I am not at liberty to discuss that.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Don't play cop with me.
LEADMALE:You know, crystal, if i wanted to, i could give you a summons.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, if i wanted to, i could give you a makeover.
SUPMALE:Why? you think i need a makeover? Well, i think you could use some new colors.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i got a new blue that would look great-hi, meg! oh, oh! What's going on here? you weren't robbed, were you? you're margaret wellman? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, i am.
OTHERFEMALE:You were involved in an automobile accident in the number two lane of palmer avenue at approximately in which you, as the driver of a 1987 eldorado cadillac, slammed into the rear end of a 1974 station wagon of one roseanne harris conner? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, i did.
SUPFEMALE:Say, didn't you used to work for me? Yes, i did, and if it's all right, i'll ask the questions, ma'am.
LEADMALE:You're roxanne's sister, aren't you? Janet.
SUPMALE:It's jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, actually, he's called jacques, but a lot of people mispronounce it.
SUPMALE:You know what's real easy to pronounce, mrs.
LEADMALE:Wellman? Cop, cop.
SUPMALE:'cause that's what i am.
LEADMALE:I'm a cop.
LEADMALE:And i'm here investigating an accident in which a person was injured.
SUPMALE:Does this dog have a license? And said person is still at home in bed, unable to support her family, barely able to talk to her lawyers.
OTHERFEMALE:Roxanne called an attorney? You bet she called an attorney, a good one with offices in big cities! Jackie, come on.
LEADFEMALE:We're talking about a big lawsuit here.
LEADFEMALE:Lawsuit? Well, i guess i better call my attorney.
LEADMALE:You better call somebody, lady.
LEADMALE:You're not getting away with this one.
LEADMALE:I've checked the records.
LEADMALE:You've had pretty busy bumpers! Come on, jackie.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Well, i didn't know roxanne was still at home.
LEADMALE:She hasn't been in for the whole week.
SUPMALE:Well, my attorney didn't tell me she was so seriously injured.
LEADMALE:Well, didn't you even call her up and see how she was? Well, my attorney advised me not to.
LEADMALE:He said it would be an admission of guilt.
LEADMALE:Well, you are guilty, meg.
LEADFEMALE:You smashed her car, and you got to take responsibility for that! Remember one thing, wellman-i'm your worst nightmare.
LEADMALE:Mom, there's a cadillac in our driveway.
LEADMALE:What color cadillac? Uh earwax gold.
LEADFEMALE:And the front end is smashed in.
SUPFEMALE:Holy cow, it's mrs.
LEADMALE:Wellman.
LEADMALE:D.j. , give me that neck brace, quick.
OTHERFEMALE:I knew she'd show up sooner or later.
LEADMALE:No, mom.
SUPMALE:You're a vegetable.
LEADFEMALE:Ow, ow, ow! Here.
LEADFEMALE:Put this on.
LEADMALE:Now she's coming to see me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure she feels bad enough.
SUPFEMALE:You always say how you want better things for us.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but i was talking about me and your dad.
LEADMALE:You kids already got it too good.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, make your arm limp! make your arm limp! You know what's good? Talk with water in your mouth.
OTHERMALE:Do i have to get up? Just sit! d.j. , get the door! sick, sick! Remember, mom, you're broccoli.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hello, little man.
SUPMALE:Is your mommy home? Hi, meg.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:The doctor says she really shouldn't have visitors.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, especially young ones.
LEADFEMALE:You guys go play.
OTHERMALE:Well, i guess jacques doesn't get to play much nineball.
OTHERFEMALE:Roxanne, you do make me laugh.
LEADMALE:Have a seat.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, thank you, roxanne.
LEADFEMALE:I brought you some treats.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that was very nice.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, by the way, i'm glad you didn't get racked up or nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i'm fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it was very nice of you to stop by.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be silly.
OTHERFEMALE:We were in the neighborhood.
LEADMALE:What, were you getting an estimate on body damage or something? Actually, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Roxanne, i didn't know you were so seriously injured until i spoke to janet at the salon.
LEADMALE:Janet? Your sister.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no offense, meg, but, you know, if you would've called me, i could've told you that i was seriously hurt.
LEADMALE:Well, i would have called, roxanne, but my attorney advised me not to.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how very legal of you.
LEADMALE:Roxanne, i want you to know that even though you no longer work for the company, we still think of you as part of the wellman family.
OTHERMALE:I don't suppose my health insurance is still good? you just dropped by 'cause you were in the neighborhood? Well, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:And 'cause you wanted to see how i was doing and bring me a gift? Oh, it's nothing.
SUPMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADMALE:Very nice of you to come by.
SUPFEMALE:Well, actually, there was just one other teensy, little thing, just while i'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you need a shampoo? Oh, nothing that complicated.
SUPMALE:No, i wanted you to endorse this check.
SUPMALE:A check? for what? For you, roxanne, and--and for your little family.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, honey! I don't know what to say.
LEADMALE:If you'd just sign that, jacques and i will run it right over to your bank, and you'll have your money.
OTHERMALE:Meg, you know my husband don.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course.
LEADMALE:It's nice to see you, dan.
SUPFEMALE:A pleasure, mrs.
LEADMALE:Wellman.
LEADMALE:Can i fix you a drink? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:I'll only stay a moment.
LEADMALE:And you must call me meg.
OTHERMALE:Right now? meg? meg, why are you giving us all this money? why? Well, because it's the right thing to do and i'm a nice person.
LEADFEMALE:But what is this little, tiny writing here? "endorsement constitutes acceptance of payment for total liability.
LEADFEMALE:" that's just a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo.
LEADMALE:We wouldn't want to get legal now, would we? Oh, of course not.
SUPFEMALE:No, of course not, 'cause our lawyer tells us we can get three or four times that amount.
SUPMALE:People get so silly about money.
LEADMALE:Here.
OTHERMALE:Thanks for dropping by, meg, and making me feel stupid.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, she's our guest.
SUPMALE:Now, why would you feel stupid? Because for some dumb reason, i actually thought that you dropped by to see how i was doing, but you only came by to buy me off.
LEADFEMALE:Buy you off? Yeah, but you bought yourself a huge lawsuit, lady.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i'm gonna haul you into court and i'm gonna squeeze you dry.
SUPMALE:Well, i hope you have a very good attorney.
LEADFEMALE:Let me rephrase that, meg.
LEADMALE:I think what i really meant to say was that if, you know, if i would have bumped into you, i mean, i would have called a lawyer, too, you know, but first i would have maybe called you to see if you were ok and to say i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:But i am sorry, roxanne.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
SUPMALE:Well, that's all i needed to hear.
LEADFEMALE:That's all you want? That and your word that i never have to walk your dog again.
LEADMALE:And that's it? And the check.
LEADMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, don, could you walk me to my car? Of course.
LEADMALE:Neighborhood.
LEADMALE:Oh, roxanne, i am so glad we got this straightened out just between us, and we are friends again, aren't we? Oh, i'd say we're about as close as we ever were, meg.
LEADFEMALE:My lawyer got me $25,000.
SUPMALE:He got me $25,000.
SUPMALE:He got me $60,000.
SUPMALE:He took care of everything for me-got me a $20,000 settlement.
LEADFEMALE:I broke my leg, and larry parker got me $80,000.
LEADMALE:After the accident, my car got fixed, my medical was paid, and i got a good settlement.
LEADFEMALE:I was in a crosswalk.
SUPMALE:I got hit by a car.
OTHERMALE:I got my knee and my back messed up.
LEADMALE:I went through the windshield of a car.
LEADFEMALE:I shattered my wrist.
LEADMALE:So i went to larry h.
SUPMALE:Parker, and they got me some big money.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:This is nuts.
SUPMALE:More coffee, honey? Hey, take my word for it.
LEADMALE:By midnight tonight, the taxes will be filed and all this will be behind us-the tension, the anxiety, the fraud.
SUPMALE:A stupid system run by stupid people, thought up by stupid people, hired by stupid people.
OTHERFEMALE:Who were elected by even stupider people.
LEADMALE:Why can't everybody just pay a flat percentage, you know? You know, that's a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe this year instead of filing, you ought to go change the tax laws.
SUPMALE:It makes more sense than this.
LEADFEMALE:This stuff's so complicated, nobody can understand it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe we could have found somebody to explain it to us if you didn't wait till the last minute.
LEADFEMALE:Don't.
SUPMALE:Don't.
LEADMALE:Don't start laying this off on me.
LEADMALE:I'm not saying nothing.
LEADFEMALE:'course it is on you because you did go and wait till the last minute.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if you wanted to get the taxes done earlier, you could've started getting stuff together yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm so glad that you brought that up, honey, because i did.
LEADFEMALE:I got all my w-2s and all my receipts.
SUPFEMALE:They're all added up, catalogued, put together, and ready to go.
SUPFEMALE:No kidding? you're all done? No.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted to see the look on your face.
OTHERMALE:You know, i thought i'd try to keep it light, you know.
SUPMALE:So this is how you're trying to be helpful, by telling jokes? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Just till midnight.
LEADFEMALE:I will tell one show-stopper at 11:59, and then i shall rest.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if you think this is so much fun, you ought to sit down here and try to figure these taxes out.
LEADMALE:Why, no problem.
OTHERFEMALE:You want to do the taxes? you want me to? Oh, do the taxes.
LEADMALE:I'd be happy to.
OTHERFEMALE:Please do the taxes.
LEADFEMALE:Why, allow me.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
SUPFEMALE:What's the matter, roseanne? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:So, what? You're you're at line 12.
OTHERMALE:Business income.
OTHERFEMALE:We just tell them it's none of their business.
SUPMALE:You know, this is really one time where i think being a woman is really going to come in handy, you know, because, you know, us women read and comprehend instructions so much better than you men, as you know.
LEADFEMALE:So that is what i will be doing right now, huh? I will be looking and reading the instructions for line 12.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Line 10, line 11, line 13 and 14.
LEADMALE:There is no line 12.
SUPFEMALE:Why isn't there any line 12? I'll check the back for line 12.
LEADMALE:C.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, schedule c.
SUPMALE:Aha.
LEADMALE:Now we're in the money.
LEADMALE:Schedule c, e, f, e.
SUPMALE:E schedule c.
LEADFEMALE:See? Schedule c.
LEADMALE:See this.
OTHERFEMALE:Einstein.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:"if line 67 is $500 or more "and more than "shown on your return or you underpaid "your 1989 estimated tax liability for any payment period, you may owe a penalty.
LEADFEMALE:" right.
LEADFEMALE:So, ok, i give up.
LEADFEMALE:What language is this? Fiduciary esperanto.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they couldn't go put something in here that like nobody on earth could understand.
SUPMALE:They wouldn't do that.
SUPMALE:They wouldn't do that.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:"if line 67 is $500 or more and more than--" oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, oh.
LEADFEMALE:"if line 67 is $500 or more" "and more than oh, then--then then your husband must, by law, complete the taxes.
LEADMALE:Hey, becky, how much money do you think mom and dad made last year? I don't know, but i once heard mom saying to aunt jackie that this house cost them 30,000, and they bought it this house years ago, so if they could afford to spend that much then, they're probably making three times that much now.
OTHERMALE:$90,000? Oh, my god! Way off.
SUPMALE:Way, way off.
LEADMALE:So how much did you make? Way off.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, how much money did you guys make last year? Dad doesn't want to tell us.
LEADFEMALE:That's 'cause he don't know.
LEADMALE:Besides, it's not polite to go asking people how much money they make.
SUPMALE:Even if it's your own parents? Especially if it's your own parents.
LEADMALE:I mean, just generally, how much does someone with a job make? It depends on the job.
OTHERMALE:Say she worked shampooing heads and gossiping all day.
SUPMALE:Well, then, she would probably be paid very, very well, but, you know, mostly in the form of cash tips, which she would of course pocket and then not tell anyone about, including her husband and three wonderful children.
LEADMALE:So, in other words, you're not gonna tell us either.
OTHERMALE:Now, look, your dad and i made enough money last year to live very, very well for six months.
LEADMALE:And then we juggled.
OTHERMALE:What do you mean, you juggled? ok, you know how when you borrow a quarter from becky and you can't pay her back, so then you come borrow a dollar from me, and then i go and deduct it from your next week's allowance? Yeah, and then next week when my allowance is only $4.
LEADFEMALE:00, i can't get into the movies.
OTHERMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:So then you just go in and swipe a buck out of my purse, you know, like you always do.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, you guys steal money? No, no.
SUPMALE:We don't need to steal money.
SUPFEMALE:We have credit.
SUPMALE:Go to school.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:What do you think we're paying taxes for? do you guys cheat on your income tax? Absolutely not.
SUPFEMALE:Sis! Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Is he tearing the house apart yet? Not yet, but it's early.
LEADMALE:Has he started in on his speech about moving to an island in the pacific and never paying taxes again? Not yet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so far so good.
LEADMALE:So far.
LEADMALE:Except for the yakking.
LEADMALE:I have been dreading this for weeks.
LEADFEMALE:You know how crummy my math is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no sweat.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. will be home by 3:00.
OTHERFEMALE:Very funny, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I think i can manage to do my own taxes despite what certain men might think.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you just said yourself that you're no good at math.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I'm self-conscious as it is about my math.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need to be hearing about it from my boyfriend.
OTHERFEMALE:He tells me that he loves me and then he criticizes my math.
LEADFEMALE:He said maybe he should look over my form, you know, like i can't handle it.
SUPMALE:Do you mind? Come on, sis.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go in the living room.
LEADMALE:He's taken over the main ballroom here.
LEADMALE:The adding machine stays.
LEADFEMALE:Just these two numbers together.
LEADFEMALE:Look, what's 14,173.
LEADMALE:80 plus 1,319.
LEADMALE:16roughly? Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:What? You just messed me all up here.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:But just real quick.
LEADMALE:14,173--ok.
LEADMALE:Do it.
LEADMALE:Do it! Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's not right.
LEADFEMALE:That can't be right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, let me.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:This on the top-plus the 1,3 thanks, dan.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Yeah, now, see, that's closer to the total.
SUPMALE:Ok, ok, ok.
LEADMALE:What's going on between you and gary? Oh nothing.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, there is and you're dying to tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing's going on.
LEADFEMALE:Spill it.
SUPMALE:He thinks he's so smart and i can't handle anything that requires a little simple math.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i told you not to do any math in front of him till after you're married.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne? Well, gary said he didn't mean it like that, and i know exactly the way he meant it, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:A woman can tell that.
SUPMALE:He hates my math.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne! What? I need your 1099 for that magazine subscription job.
LEADMALE:I didn't get one.
SUPMALE:What do you mean, you didn't get one? I mean i did not get one as opposed to i did get one.
LEADFEMALE:You know, therefore, i do not have one as opposed to i have one.
LEADMALE:You didn't get a 1099? See, now there's some communication happening.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:No, i didn't get a 1099, honey, but i didn't need one because you got to make something like 600 bucks or something like that to even get one, you know.
OTHERMALE:That's the rule.
LEADMALE:Says who? Says god.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just the rule.
LEADMALE:You know this for a fact? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You asked someone? Yes.
LEADMALE:Who? Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie's wrong.
OTHERMALE:Everybody gets a 1099.
OTHERFEMALE:D.j. didn't get one, so not everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't a joke.
LEADMALE:I need that 1099 or we're dead.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't get any kind of 1099 'cause i'm not supposed to get any kind of 1099, but here's what i'm going to do for you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm calling up the irs right now and i'm going to ask them just to make absolutely, positively sure that i don't need no 1099.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne, get real.
LEADFEMALE:It's tax day.
LEADMALE:You're never gonna get through to the irs.
LEADFEMALE:It's busy.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:What are we gonna do? Well, i don't know.
LEADMALE:Just go ahead and do everything else, you know, and then we'll worry about the 1099 thing later.
LEADMALE:What later? later when? Ok, ok, yeah, we are kind of all out of later.
OTHERMALE:Buti mean, it's no big deal, ok? they didn't mail me any kind of 1099, so how can we declare the income? It's not our fault.
SUPFEMALE:I'm done.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:You're messing with the feds.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you're the one who told me when we was in the car coming back from shopping-you're the one that says i shouldn't get one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i thought you were talking about a wig.
LEADMALE:A wig? You are really, really getting on my nerves today, man! I mean, more than usual.
LEADMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:What if she is supposed to get a 1099 and it got lost in the mail? And then the irs is going to check her on it, and you guys are gonna have to have an audit.
LEADFEMALE:And they don't go back for one year, you know.
LEADMALE:They can go back like six years to audit.
OTHERFEMALE:And if you can't document every single, solitary deduction for the last six years, you got to pay.
OTHERFEMALE:And not only the adjusted tax, but the penalties and the interest.
LEADFEMALE:And in order to make sure that you pay, they can freeze your bank account.
SUPMALE:They can garnish your wages.
LEADFEMALE:They can auction off your furniture.
SUPMALE:They auction our furniture? Let's not file, for sure.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:What are we gonna do about this 1099? I ain't in no mood for an audit.
SUPFEMALE:I think we should get out of this house.
LEADMALE:Just go down to the irs and ask them in person.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, i can't.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:I can't go down to that building.
LEADFEMALE:It gives me the creeps.
SUPMALE:I just know i'm gonna take one of those snotty little irs guys and throw him through a window.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that would not be smart, honey, because then we would definitely get an audit.
LEADMALE:Can i help you? i guess we'll find out, won't we? do you want to go ahead and get the phone first? I guess i'm not a phone person either.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, if people want to talk to you, they better come down here and stand in line all day, huh? Honey, honey, the gentleman's waiting to help us.
LEADMALE:Alien tax clearance? No.
LEADFEMALE:1099.
LEADFEMALE:Counter four.
LEADMALE:Next, please.
LEADMALE:Just step aside.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's keep the line moving.
OTHERMALE:Mister, that's a real long line, and we're kind of pressed for time.
LEADMALE:I was, you know, just wondering if, uh guess not.
LEADMALE:Put your right leg in you put your right leg out you put your right leg in and you shake it all about you do the hokey pokey please remain behind the yellow line, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look, doll face, i got form 4255 here, entitled, "recapture of investment credits "for disposal or changed use of investment property before the end of its useful life.
LEADMALE:" do you have anything sharp i could stick in my eye? do i include form 8611 for reduction in quality basis of property and put the total on line 50 or do i list them separately? I'll get the supervisor.
LEADMALE:I think the wise thing would be to go down to your local irs office.
SUPFEMALE:If i'd kept my last job, i could've been on vacation in florida.
LEADMALE:Please step behind the yellow line.
OTHERMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like we're gonna hit you or nothing.
LEADMALE:What do you need? Ok.
LEADMALE:How much do you got to earn to be mailed a 1099? um, that's income from gambling? No.
LEADMALE:No, it isn't.
OTHERMALE:Pension income? Time's up, denise.
SUPMALE:I'm sure this instruction book will help, ok? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i've read this book, and it is fabulous, but i would like some information.
LEADFEMALE:See, i'd wager that's why they call this the information line.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, sir, but i've only been here for two weeks.
OTHERMALE:Well, so have we.
LEADMALE:Look, please, we've been extremely busy.
LEADMALE:This is our busiest day of the year.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sure you can understand.
LEADMALE:I mean, i've been here since 7:30 this morning.
LEADMALE:I never got lunch, and they don't even have fresh coffee back here.
LEADMALE:Maybe one of your colleagues could help us.
LEADFEMALE:Ed, do you know anything about a 1099? Pensions and annuities.
SUPMALE:No, ed.
LEADFEMALE:Income, ed.
SUPMALE:Counter four.
OTHERMALE:Is there anyone else? anyone? I'll get the supervisor.
LEADMALE:Why, next year we're starting in june.
LEADMALE:Next year we ain't gonna file.
LEADMALE:Then we'll go to prison.
LEADMALE:Of course, i bet you don't have to file from prison.
LEADMALE:What's the problem? Well, nobody in your whole operation here seems to know how much i have to earn to get mailed a 1099.
OTHERMALE:What were your earnings? An employer is only required to send you a 1099 if you earned $600 or more.
OTHERFEMALE:Why couldn't you guys have that written down somewhere? We do.
LEADFEMALE:We have detailed instruction books which can be easily understood by people with at least an eighth grade education, but of course we have to rely on cooperative citizens such as yourselves taking the time to read them.
SUPMALE:No, see, i did read this book, and there's nothing in here about no 1099.
LEADFEMALE:You show me where it says anything in there about a 1099.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's the one page i skipped.
LEADFEMALE:That's that page 34.
LEADFEMALE:Page 34.
LEADMALE:Yeah, so it's our fault.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not saying it's anyone's fault, ma'am, but the answer is there in writing.
SUPMALE:Sorry, there are no pictures.
SUPMALE:You're really funny, you know? You should have a cover charge to get in this joint.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, if more people would take the time to read these simple instructions, they wouldn't have to come down here and ask stupid questions, and then maybe these lines wouldn't be so long.
SUPFEMALE:So long.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, listen, you pencil-pushing geek.
OTHERMALE:I really didn't come down here to stand in line all day to put up with your condescending, snotty little attitude, you know? i mean, i'm sure it is a pain in your butt to answer our unimportant little questions, but that is your job, isn't it? And you are paid with our tax money.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, honey, come on.
SUPFEMALE:No, dan.
LEADFEMALE:This stuff is impossible to understand-these laws and explanations of laws.
SUPFEMALE:No human being can really understand these things.
LEADFEMALE:You know, that's why you got to go get some $200-an-hour lawyer to even explain the crap to you, you know? And i can't afford $200 an hour.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We don't write the stinking laws! you got a complaint, talk to the idiots in washington! ed! Well, maybe i should.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, us people, the poor people, and us regular people, we're paying more taxes than the rich people because they got all their lawyers to figure out the loopholes.
OTHERMALE:I want to find loopholes.
SUPMALE:Yeah! Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we give you our money and then you like totally mismanage it worse than we ever could anyhow.
LEADMALE:I mean, the government is something like $3 trillion in debt.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i think i saw that on donahue.
OTHERMALE:It's like 3 trillion-that would be like if you're making $15,000 a year, ok? So you run up your mastercharge to like 50 grand.
OTHERFEMALE:Then, can you even imagine? Your monthly bill would be like $5,000 a month.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's insane.
SUPFEMALE:The whole thing is insane.
LEADMALE:I mean, someday us regular people, we ought to get smart, you know, and audit them.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, ma'am, uh, i didn't get your name.
LEADFEMALE:You don't need her name.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:No, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to be intimidated by that little weasel.
LEADMALE:Honey, this isn't the unemployment office.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I have nothing to hide.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, rabbi.
OTHERFEMALE:I am not afraid to tell you my name.
OTHERFEMALE:It's wagner with a "w.
LEADFEMALE:" all right.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Norris t.
LEADMALE:Wagner.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Norris t.
LEADMALE:Wagner.
SUPMALE:Come, norris.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, dear.
LEADMALE:Presenting, new for 1989, your income tax return.
LEADFEMALE:Pages and pages of fabulous print on our own high-quality bond, brought to you by the united states government.
SUPMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:Your pen--a bic clic-retailing for 98 cents, available at the bottom of any of one of mom's pocketbooks.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, vanna.
LEADFEMALE:And now wagner.
LEADMALE:Move it out.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Jackets.
SUPMALE:So did you guys cheat? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Rich people rip off the government.
OTHERMALE:Why shouldn't we? oh, where did you get that? Off of one of your dylan albums.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody cheated.
LEADMALE:Get in the car.
SUPFEMALE:Hope you don't get an audit.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I'm john goodman.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:What you've just seen was a play, a silly little play chock-full of jokes and just for fun, just for your entertainment.
SUPMALE:I personally have nothing but the utmost respect for the internal revenue service and all of its dedicated workers because, you know, it's the great guys and gals at the irs that keep america rolling.
LEADMALE:See, it's like this.
LEADMALE:I got a contract with a production company, and they hire writers who put words in my mouth.
OTHERFEMALE:For example, early in the show i go-it was my job to say-"it's a stupid system run by stupid people," right? Like i believe that.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, i don't believe anything i said on the show.
LEADFEMALE:It was my job as an actor.
LEADMALE:So i beg you, please do not confuse hardworking, responsible, taxpaying john goodman with that lovable but naughty scamp dan conner.
SUPMALE:So, to the men and women at the irs, my hat's off to you.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:God bless.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, do you know dad was thinking about retiring? what's he going to do all day? stay home with grandma? You know, i bet he'll be dead within a month.
LEADFEMALE:Look, if i stopped you for speeding, which hairstyle do you think commands more respect, this or this? Nah.
LEADMALE:If you stop me for speeding, i'll pull all your hair out.
SUPFEMALE:When did dad call you? Sunday, when he always calls me.
LEADFEMALE:He calls you every sunday? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, no, not every sunday.
SUPFEMALE:Mom calls you every saturday.
LEADFEMALE:No, she doesn't.
LEADFEMALE:I call her.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm off to fight crime and keep lanford safe.
SUPMALE:Oh! Would you get that thing out of here? Look, first of all, the safety was on.
LEADFEMALE:Second of all, a police revolver does not go off simply by being dropped on the floor.
LEADMALE:Well a waste of taxpayers' money, i'm telling you.
LEADMALE:That goes in there.
LEADMALE:Oh, dan, some guy named walt called you.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for supper.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Walt? when? A couple of hours ago.
OTHERFEMALE:See you later.
LEADMALE:Becky, wrap it up.
LEADMALE:One sec! Try jerry polson.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I got to go.
LEADMALE:It's the 'rents.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:What's wrong? I can't believe that.
LEADMALE:What was gonna be a really great party tomorrow night is turning into the snooze of the century.
LEADFEMALE:Why, what'd they do-invite your dad? No.
OTHERFEMALE:First, wayne frankel isn't coming, and now richie bower can't come 'cause his parents are making him go to some stupid funeral.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe somebody in their family died.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but you're right.
LEADFEMALE:A party is a party.
LEADMALE:Darlene, how would you like to make a little money saturday helping on that drywall job? That kid walt flaked out on me.
LEADFEMALE:How much? Never mind how much.
LEADMALE:Yes or no? Start at 6:00.
LEADMALE:Breakfast at the diner? Diner it is.
OTHERMALE:Can i finish the dishes later? I think this needs to soak.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'll do it later.
LEADMALE:Dad, how about a little roundball under the lights? Sure.
SUPMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, i'll be out in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, that wasn't very nice.
LEADMALE:What? What you just did.
LEADFEMALE:What? what? you don't even know? Well, you got two daughters, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You know, maybe becky wants to make some money, too.
LEADFEMALE:Becky measuring drywall? That is for to laugh.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha! No, that's not for to laugh.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, you just ask darlene to go and then you just assume becky doesn't want to go.
LEADMALE:That reminds me of my dad when he used to ask jackie to go fishing and just assumed i didn't want to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, you don't like fishing.
LEADFEMALE:I like it better than rejection.
LEADMALE:I didn't reject anybody.
SUPMALE:Becky doesn't like hammers and saws.
SUPFEMALE:How do you know? 'cause i tried to saw her in half one time, and she started screaming.
LEADMALE:What is this all about? It's about your daughter who's upstairs feeling unloved, unwanted, and alone, and she ain't even married.
SUPMALE:You are completely out of your mind.
SUPMALE:Don't try to change the subject.
SUPFEMALE:She's probably up there right now, crying her eyes out.
LEADMALE:Oh, golly, katie bar the damn door.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, forget about it.
LEADMALE:I'm not going up there.
LEADFEMALE:This is bull.
OTHERMALE:Whatever you're thinking, put it out of your mind.
SUPMALE:Fine, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Just do whatever you want.
LEADMALE:Boy, are you jam, pump it up and the jam is pumpin' look ahead to party jumpin' pump it up a little more get the party goin' on the dance floor see, 'cause that's where the party's at and you i want a place to stay get your booty-aah! Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What? can i come in, or do i got to get my hand stamped? pump up the jam? how long were you standing there? Just one verse.
LEADMALE:So what do you want? Oh, i want to know if you wanted to help me out on that drywall job saturday.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you got darlene to do it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but i thought maybe you'd like to join the fun.
LEADFEMALE:What fun, standing around some guy's basement? Well, it's a half-day's work.
LEADMALE:I thought you could use the extra cash.
SUPMALE:Is this hinge coming loose? you're just up here to spy, aren't you? No.
LEADMALE:That's pretty much your mom's department.
LEADMALE:Hey, i know how you and mom work.
LEADFEMALE:You get me out of the house so mom can come in here and "clean.
SUPMALE:" hey, becky, why do you assume there's some ulterior motive for me coming up here? Because you only come up here for two reasons-to say good night and to fix the toilet.
SUPFEMALE:Now it's only 7 p.
LEADFEMALE:M.
LEADFEMALE:Toilet's working fine.
SUPFEMALE:So what's going on? well, what's going on with you? this is about the dishes, isn't it? No, it's not about the dishes.
SUPFEMALE:It's not about anything, becky.
LEADFEMALE:What's with this attitude? i just came up here to ask you a simple question-do you want the job? yes or no? well, if i say no, can i still go to the party tomorrow night? Hey, you can do anything you want to do.
LEADFEMALE:This is not a trick question.
LEADMALE:I thought it might be fun to spend some time together.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:If you're gonna make me go, i'll go.
LEADMALE:Hey, i don't want you to do anything you don't want to do.
LEADFEMALE:If you want to come along, come along.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't want to, fine! fine! fine! Was that about the dishes? well, was i right? Yeah, you were right.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i didn't want to be right.
LEADMALE:I was hoping i was wrong.
LEADMALE:Well, you weren't.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I went up there to ask her a question.
LEADMALE:The next thing i know, we were shouting at each other.
LEADMALE:What were you shouting about? I don't even know.
LEADMALE:You know, i love this old porch.
LEADMALE:Like being on the back of a caboose that's not going anywhere.
SUPMALE:Well, you may not be going no place, but i'm going in, 'cause i'm freezing my butt off.
LEADMALE:You just need to spend more time with her, dan.
SUPMALE:You know, get, uh, interested in her life.
LEADMALE:What am i supposed to do, baby? hang out at the malt shop? Maybe.
LEADMALE:Hey, if you do, bring me back something.
LEADMALE:Hey, deej, your fly's open.
SUPFEMALE:Huh? Dad, 7:00 tonight, don't forget.
SUPFEMALE:Black hawks, oilers.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be there.
LEADFEMALE:The beverages will be there.
LEADMALE:The chips will be there, but, becky, you won't be here 'cause you're going to that party.
SUPMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad.
LEADMALE:Like i care.
LEADMALE:So who's throwing this shindig? shindig? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:It's a word from the olden days.
SUPMALE:Um, it's at joyce's house.
SUPMALE:Oh, joyce.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:She's a nice girl.
LEADMALE:You never met her.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, but throwing a party and all, that's a pretty nice thing to do.
OTHERFEMALE:So, becky, you think her parents are gonna spring for a live band like billy wall's parents did last year? remember that, dan, and the cops showed up? Boy, i bet that was rad.
SUPFEMALE:So, becky, who you taking to this shindig? Nobody special.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what about jimmy melon, spellon mels meltreiger? Yeah, jimmy meltreiger.
LEADMALE:I like him.
SUPFEMALE:Well there--you know, there was things about him i liked.
LEADMALE:Uh, i didn't love the guy.
LEADFEMALE:Becky did until he dumped her.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't dump me.
OTHERMALE:Get real.
SUPFEMALE:You hit the ground like a safe.
LEADMALE:He dumped you? He didn't dump me, dad! I mean, you broke up with him.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you being so nosy? I'm not being nosy.
LEADMALE:I just want to know.
LEADMALE:You want to know? he used me to get to know susan noonan, and then he dumped me, and now he's going out with her, ok? And now you know everything! and now i'm gonna be in my room in case you want to come up and do a little more spying! Good.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, i can't tell you how you've helped my relationship with becky.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, dad, you ready for me to slaughter you? Oh, so now it's your turn.
OTHERFEMALE:Is there a big storm brewing here? I mean, like, should i split? 'cause i got to do some baking.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's just the usual family tension.
OTHERMALE:You know, this one ain't talking to that one, that one ain't talking to this one.
LEADMALE:What did you do? what do you mean, what'd i do? how come all the time, you think it's my fault? Ok, like, assume it's not your fault.
LEADMALE:So, what happened? Oh, it's all my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dan goes over to darlene and he asks her if she wants to make some extra money, you know? Well, becky needs to make some extra money, too, 'cause she spends more money on clothes, for one thing, than darlene does.
LEADMALE:You know, i don't know.
LEADMALE:He just asked darlene, and he totally overlooked becky.
SUPFEMALE:You know, gary does that stuff with his dogs.
LEADFEMALE:Like he'll always favor the collie.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Well, this is about me.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:So i get all over dan.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i tell him, hey, you got two daughters, and the whole deal and everything like that, you know, so then he goes up and he asks becky to go.
LEADMALE:And she of course says no.
SUPMALE:'cause who wants to go anyplace after your mom makes your dad ask you? You know, dogs can sense when you're appeasing them, too.
SUPMALE:Now, try to stay with me here, sis.
OTHERMALE:So, anyways, then we're sitting here at the breakfast table and he's trying to talk to becky and everything and he's getting all palsy-walsy with her, all this crap.
SUPMALE:He's just driving her nuts 'cause he's asking her question after question after question.
LEADFEMALE:She just finally goes crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Now she ain't talking to him, he blames me, so he ain't talking to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing to do this weekend, sis? No, i just don't want dan pulling the same kind of head-trip on becky like daddy used to pull on me.
LEADFEMALE:What head-trip? You know, how he'd always think of something really fun to do and then he'd only ask you to go with him.
LEADMALE:He did not.
SUPFEMALE:He did, too.
SUPMALE:He did not.
SUPFEMALE:I was the only one home.
OTHERMALE:That's why.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, you were the only one who could bear to be with mom.
LEADMALE:Jackie, you know you're daddy's favorite.
LEADMALE:I am not.
LEADMALE:Beer break.
LEADFEMALE:Pee break.
SUPFEMALE:That's how it works.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you think i feel, jackie? He calls you every sunday.
SUPMALE:How do you think that makes me feel? how does it make you feel knowing mom calls me all the time and she never calls you? Lucky.
LEADMALE:Honored.
OTHERMALE:Off the hook.
SUPFEMALE:Free, thrilled.
LEADMALE:Elated.
SUPMALE:Glad that she's still alive, but i don't have to talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Glad that every time the phone rings, i know-oh, all right! all right! Amazing.
LEADFEMALE:And your parents can still ruin a weekend.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, dan and becky have a perfectly healthy relationship.
LEADFEMALE:Not anymore.
SUPMALE:Dan spends just as much time with becky as you do with darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, what? Yeah, you have just as crummy relationship with darlene as i have with becky.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding me? are you kidding me? You didn't even know she broke up with her boyfriend.
SUPMALE:What was the score of darlene's basketball game tuesday night? Uh s.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:How much money did she lose on the super bowl? what, she's gambling? A buck and a half plus a preying mantis she found at the lanford club.
LEADFEMALE:What was she doing in the lanford club? you don't know? I hope she wasn't devastated by your lack of interest.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, me and darlene have a perfect relationship.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you trade wisecracks.
LEADFEMALE:Kind of the same way that mom and i trade putdowns.
SUPMALE:I am not like mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Me and darlene do a lot more than just trading wisecracks, i will have you know.
LEADMALE:We love spending time together.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, honey you want to take a walk with me down to the store later on? Gee, i'd love to, mom, but i rather stay home and drill some screws into my toes.
SUPFEMALE:You got to love her sense of humor.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? To watch the game.
SUPMALE:On tv? No.
LEADFEMALE:The bulls and knicks are actually coming over and playing in our living room.
LEADFEMALE:You want to help me move the couch? Yeah.
LEADMALE:We'll put it in your mouth.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? Well, i'm joining you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but you hate basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i know that, but i love my little daughter.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you want to watch that mary hart special? Seven, mom.
LEADMALE:Oh, right.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPMALE:Me and you, we have some good talks, don't we? mom, what's going on? i mean, why is dad at the mall leeching on becky? Nothing's going on.
LEADMALE:You're lying.
SUPMALE:I'm not lying.
LEADMALE:Well, how come you're not at the mall shopping with becky? Well, i was going to go, but, you know, i hear there's some great game on.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, ok.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Well, me and your dad were just checking in with you and becky, you know? Parents just have to do that every now and then.
LEADMALE:You just kind of, you know, you knock on the door and you just have to shout down there, "hey, everything ok in there?" then you hope for a good answer.
LEADMALE:Is everything ok? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Now shut the door.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm getting a draft.
LEADFEMALE:Is that how you're gonna get through your life, just all these wisecracks? is that what you're going to do? Well, it worked for you-i mean, not that my wisecracks can even compare with yours.
LEADMALE:Different league, you know, but i mean it's cool.
LEADMALE:You're always coming up with this off-the-wall stuff, and i like it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're not as sappy as all those other kids' parents.
LEADMALE:Think so? Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Well, look, how about this? is this one a good one? what? No, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you hate this, don't you? Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Be honest.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you hate shopping.
SUPFEMALE:Only parts of it, like the waiting the walking the searching, the carrying, standing there like a fool while someone takes an alarm off your new pants.
SUPMALE:Then why did you come down here with me? You could have just dropped me off.
LEADFEMALE:Why did you feel like you had to hang with me all day? Mom.
LEADMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You know how she wants everything to be just right.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:She got it into her head that you and i weren't spending enough time together, so here we are-on a spree.
LEADMALE:Dad, we see each other all the time.
LEADMALE:I mean, you were even up in my room a couple of days ago.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and you acted like it was a crime against nature.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's just 'cause you know, you don't usually come up there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i--ii know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, i mean, i guess, uh we really don't talk a whole lot about what's going on in your life anymore.
SUPFEMALE:But i tell mom stuff, and she pretty much tells you everything, huh? Not always.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you can talk to me, too.
SUPFEMALE:You know i'm crazy about you.
LEADMALE:I mean, i'm crazy about your brother and sister, too, but i really adore you.
SUPMALE:Dad.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying, baby, you know-yo, conner.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, dana.
SUPMALE:What's the haps? We're like in the middle of the ultimate.
LEADMALE:Who are you here with? My old man.
SUPFEMALE:Hiya, kids.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:So where are you guys going? Oh, we're gonna go to check out some tapes at the music meister.
LEADFEMALE:Are you trapped for the whole day? Well, sort of.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'll see you monday.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe i'll call you tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Dana, wait up.
LEADMALE:Ok, ok.
LEADFEMALE:I won't call.
SUPMALE:Just hold on.
LEADMALE:Look, um why don't we let each other off the hook here.
LEADMALE:You go and shop and i'll split.
SUPMALE:We won't tell mom.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, that's lying.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Here, buy yourself something nice, and when i get home, i want to hear all the gossip.
LEADMALE:Hey, dad.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Thanks for, you know i love you.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i know.
SUPMALE:But here's a 10-spot for saying so.
LEADFEMALE:No, they don't make rubber.
LEADMALE:They get it from trees.
SUPFEMALE:And i already told you how they get trees.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, mom, you really do know everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and i get it all from books.
SUPMALE:Dad, did you know mom knows everything? Yeah, that's just one of the little things we have to live with in this family.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, d.j. , you know how they invented privacy, don't you? how? Scram.
LEADMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:So, how did it go? what can i say? I love the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you missed a hell of a knicks game, boy.
LEADMALE:They had about six billion overtimes.
SUPMALE:No kidding? who won? so, you and becky ok? Oh, yeah, we had a great time.
LEADFEMALE:She looked at clothes, i watched.
SUPFEMALE:She looked at boys, i watched.
LEADMALE:She bumped into friends, i split.
LEADMALE:She's ok.
SUPFEMALE:She loves me, i love her.
LEADMALE:What can i say? I'm a model dad.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, i feel like i ought to go over there to the department store and pick you up one of them "dad" jackets, you know, with the patches on the elbows and everything, ward.
SUPFEMALE:How did you make out with darlene-you know, the daughter i really like? Ah, we're fine.
SUPFEMALE:God, i don't know where you came up with that one.
LEADMALE:As you'll recall, i didn't start this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, whatever.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, dad.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:No kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's real interesting, dad.
OTHERMALE:Is mom there? is that what you mean by little things parents are nagging about? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:If they want us to act like adults, why do they still treat us as if we were children? Maybe we should talk to them.
LEADMALE:Every time they nag us, we should tell them we're not children anymore.
SUPMALE:Talking won't help.
SUPMALE:But maybe if johnny would do what his mother wants him to do and wear his rubbers when it's rainy or muddy outside.
LEADMALE:But gee, we can't always be perfect.
SUPMALE:Sometimes i just don't feel like eating hot cereal for breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:We sure can't.
LEADFEMALE:We can't always do what they tell us to do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's true, but being an adult doesn't mean being perfect either.
LEADFEMALE:Being an adult does mean thinking out reasons for and against eating certain foods, wearing rubbers, sitting like a ramrod.
SUPMALE:Once you learn that what your parents ask you to do is for your own good, you'll be able to accept it
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Someone's got a special day coming up.
SUPFEMALE:Oh? Mm-hmm, and i know who.
LEADMALE:Give me a break, crystal.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, is it your birthday? Saturday.
OTHERMALE:Congratulations.

SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:I wish that, uh, even though you're giving me saturday off, that i would still get paid for it.
SUPFEMALE:Of course you will.
SUPFEMALE:Aah! whoo-hoo! What did you wish, roseanne? Don't tell, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:It's bad luck.
OTHERFEMALE:It's bad luck not to tell.
SUPMALE:Maybe you won't get paid for that day off.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i wished for time.
SUPMALE:Timefor what? I used to do all this writing, you know, when i was younger.
LEADMALE:Roseanne's a terrific writer.
SUPMALE:Oh! What do you write, roxanne? Nothing now, but i used to write a lot when i was, you know, younger.

LEADFEMALE:So how come you stopped writing? Well, i don't know.
LEADMALE:I was-i was writing this one day, you know, and a grenade went off in my hand.

LEADMALE:Can't you do a little writing before you come to work in the morning? No.
SUPMALE:'cause me and dan have to go walking, and then i come home and i got breakfast, and i got the kids' lunches best time to be creative is right after you get off work, you know.
OTHERMALE:While you're still full of rage.
LEADMALE:Can't you do a little writing before you go to sleep? No.
LEADFEMALE:I like to do something else before i go to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Hoo hoo hoo.
LEADFEMALE:Surely not every night, roxanne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's what us poor people do.
LEADMALE:We don't have vcrs.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Who are these guys? The splitting headaches.
LEADMALE:What's the name of this song? Pounding.
OTHERMALE:So basically, we're listening to pounding by the splitting headaches? Ohh! Oh, my god.

LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I remember.
OTHERMALE:I mean, this book is me.
SUPMALE:My soul's in there.
LEADMALE:I used to write down everything i was ever thinking about.
OTHERMALE:So now you found it, you can write in it some more.
LEADFEMALE:When? I mean, i got a job, we're not going to live forever.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Writing was just something that really gave me a lot of pleasure, then i just gave it up.
LEADMALE:Well, you give all your time to your family and your job.
LEADFEMALE:You got a life.

LEADFEMALE:You got lazy.
LEADMALE:No, i didn't get lazy.
SUPMALE:Did not get lazy.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I did get lazy.

OTHERMALE:I got an even number of socks in my sock drawer, all folded the same way in little stacks arranged by hue.
LEADMALE:So sue me for trying to put order into your drawers.

LEADFEMALE:Well, why can't i open it now? I haven't bought it yet.
SUPMALE:Oh, well.
LEADFEMALE:I'm coming up.
LEADMALE:Are you in need of some stroking? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just in need of, you know, something to write about.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i got a dozen sharpened dixon-ticonderoga number 2s, and no ideas.
LEADMALE:Well, what did you used to write about? My life and stuff, but i think it was just more interesting then.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Cut it out.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I--i think i shouldn't start big, maybe.
SUPFEMALE:Shouldn't start so big, like, by writing.
SUPMALE:I should start maybe smaller by plagiarizing.
LEADFEMALE:You know, roseanne, i've learned a lot about writing from the police reports.
LEADFEMALE:They've got to be convincing.
LEADFEMALE:They've got to be accurate.
SUPFEMALE:They've got to be at least 2 pages long or else judge samuels isn't going to take them seriously.
LEADMALE:So, what i found is, the best way to start out is by the facts.
LEADFEMALE:What facts? facts--ev-w-w-what are the facts in gone with the wind? Well, heh, i think we're talking about literature here and not the movies.
LEADFEMALE:It was a book.
LEADMALE:Gone with the wind was a book? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:So you look at the facts.
LEADFEMALE:What are the facts? You got the north, the south, the troops, the horses, a staircase, birthin' babies, and a big fire.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding me, it was a book? See, everything's got facts and events and people in the events.
SUPFEMALE:So you take the people in the events and then you put them in the order that the facts happen, and then you're done.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'll be damned if gone with the wind wasn't a book.
SUPFEMALE:So how'd you like your dinner, mom? Oh, it was really great.
OTHERMALE:And i'll like it even more when it's all cleaned up.
LEADMALE:Come on, darlene, you got to help.
OTHERMALE:Why do i have to help? Darlene, get to work.
LEADFEMALE:So when do we get to see what you wrote today? Uh, soon as the movie comes out.
LEADMALE:No, we want to read it.
SUPMALE:Well, you can't read it a piece at a time.
OTHERMALE:You got to wait till the whole book is finished.
LEADFEMALE:Dan: you writing the great american novel? well, you know, that's always been my dream and with that new office you like that office? That is a perfect office.
LEADFEMALE:So everything's working out ok, huh? you got the time, you got the place-not a bad birthday present, huh? Good hubby.
OTHERMALE:Good hubby! arf! I'll tell you, that is such a great office, sometimes i can't tell you how many times i'm sitting down there and just looking at those walls in wonderment.
OTHERMALE:As long as you're getting to write.
SUPFEMALE:You should have seen her down there today.
LEADMALE:The pages were just pouring out.
LEADFEMALE:So what are you gonna title your book? 101 things to do with kids' heads.
LEADFEMALE:You know, writing isn't easy.
SUPFEMALE:That's the truth.
LEADMALE:Especially them hs.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you should stop using your head as an eraser.
SUPMALE:Maybe start using darlene's head as an eraser.
LEADFEMALE:So weak.
LEADMALE:Very weak.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:David, you got to help.
LEADMALE:Make me.
SUPFEMALE:Help! So when do i get to read this masterpiece? Soon as i write something.
SUPFEMALE:I thought so.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but you should see what i done to them shelves down there.
OTHERMALE:What's the matter, babe? you didn't write anything? it's not the office, is it? Oh, no, honey, no, it isn't the office, it's me.
LEADFEMALE:I get some good idea, but as soon as i write it down, it turns out stupid.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, don't start getting down on yourself.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you know, pitchers don't go down to florida in february and start throwing heat.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, can it! Darlene: sorry.
SUPMALE:Well, i just don't think i have it anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i'm sitting there, i'm trying to think of something, i'm trying to get an idea, the only thing that comes into my head is that i got to take either d.j. or darlene to the dentist or something.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene: get off of me before i kick your head in! I just don't think i have any room for creating.
LEADFEMALE:All my compartments are too full up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 37 years old and i'm a mom.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what i am.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, darlene, get off your brother.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, d.j. , we're going up to bed.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Read to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, just don't ask me to write to you.
LEADMALE:All right, buddy, what will it be? The adventures of p.
LEADFEMALE:J.
SUPMALE:Pammewack.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Well, move your butt over.
SUPFEMALE:You're hogging the bed.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh, well once there was a little kid named p.
SUPFEMALE:J.
SUPMALE:Pammewack.
OTHERFEMALE:And his initials were close to this one kid i know.
LEADFEMALE:Me.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:And he was also in the third grade, like this other kid i know.
OTHERMALE:Me.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And one day, it seems p.
LEADFEMALE:J.
LEADMALE:Was in his fort which was in whatever was left of the amazon rain forest.
SUPMALE:And it was 8:00 in the morning, so he'd already fired the morning cannon, you know, to scare off any intruders that might be coming in there trying to steal his collection of war toys.
SUPFEMALE:Intruders? Yeah, you know, the bad guys like--like bek dar, the 2-headed evil sister monster.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! oh, yes! And the cannon was fired.
SUPFEMALE:Boom! And from out of the jungle came a terrible noise.
LEADFEMALE:First there was a rumble.
SUPMALE:And a grumble.
SUPMALE:And a hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:A high-pitched scream.
SUPMALE:Scree-ree-ree! The scream of a huge, great big bird.
LEADMALE:Mom, how come p.
LEADFEMALE:J.
LEADFEMALE:Pammewack isn't in the library? Because it's not a book.
OTHERMALE:It's just some stories i make up.
LEADMALE:Well, it should be a book.
LEADMALE:You think so? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Did i ever tell you that you are my favorite son? Story! Right.
SUPMALE:So this huge bird swoops out of the jungle dan: roseanne? rosie? roseanne? roseanne? what are you doing up here? It's after midnight.

LEADMALE:Ptooot! Oh, yeah, your driving lesson.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, let's go.

OTHERMALE:That's what you said last week, but we just washed your car because "a clean car is an aerodynamic car.
LEADFEMALE:" guess you won't fall for that again, huh? I think i'm ready for that next step.
SUPMALE:Which would be turning innocent pedestrians into street pizza.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, come on! Becky, it's saturday.
SUPMALE:The one day of the week we can all spend time together.
LEADMALE:Boy, it's a beautiful morning.

LEADMALE:I don't have a den meeting.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you wearing your uniform, stupid? I slept in it, stupid.
LEADMALE:Ah, i remember my days as a scout, especially the wilderness training.
LEADFEMALE:We couldn't find any wilderness.
LEADMALE:The scoutmaster would drop us in downtown chicago, and we had to return on our own.
SUPMALE:I was one of the lucky ones.
LEADMALE:Dan scout's honor.
LEADFEMALE:Becky's waiting.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Can we go? can i get some food first? No.

SUPFEMALE:Take darlene with you.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to wait for the call with you.
LEADMALE:What call? From the highway patrol telling you they've found your husband and most of your daughter.
LEADFEMALE:What'll it take to get everyone to leave? Hi, everybody.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, wasn't this going to be your morning alone? It was supposed to be.
LEADFEMALE:They won't go away, like something stuck to the bottom of your shoe.
LEADMALE:Like gum? No, not like gum.
LEADMALE:It's like being a spy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Is that it? Yep.
LEADFEMALE:It's the most accurate pregnancy test on the market.
LEADMALE:All right, let's go.
LEADMALE:Relax.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter aside from being nine days late? you said save my first morning's urine, right? I've been saving it for seven hours.
SUPFEMALE:You sure dan doesn't know? He thinks i'm on schedule.
SUPFEMALE:How did you manage that? I faked pms.
LEADFEMALE:I even added an extra day for fun.
LEADMALE:Hey! I had to tell crystal.
LEADFEMALE:She keeps track of everybody's time of the month so she can send a card.
OTHERMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:What do we got here? Directions.
LEADFEMALE:Test kit.
OTHERMALE:What is this for? That holds the urine.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You do it in the lid first, then you use that dropper.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, give me the lid.
LEADMALE:I got to wash it out first.
SUPMALE:Ah! Oh, hey, they got coupons.
LEADFEMALE:You going to use these? "the most advanced type of" it's clean! it's clean! Hi.
LEADMALE:Come in.
OTHERFEMALE:Are they out there? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't say anything.
LEADFEMALE:I just said hi and headed straight here.
LEADMALE:They must think we're doing some weird shaving ritual.
LEADMALE:Why don't you tell dan? If it's positive, i'll find some way to tell him so his head don't explode.
LEADFEMALE:How did you tell him about your other kids? With becky, i said, "dan, get a job.
LEADFEMALE:" with darlene, i said, "dan, get a better job.
OTHERFEMALE:" and d.j. ? Ohh.
OTHERFEMALE:Do i have to tell him about d.j. ? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You got to be a little excited about maybe being pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I can hardly wait to start puking.
SUPMALE:Come on, guys, or my water's going to break.
SUPMALE:Oh, geez! Roseanne, what the hell's going on in there? We're worshipping satan, honey.
LEADMALE:We'll be right out.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh.
SUPMALE:All right, come on in.
SUPFEMALE:The kids don't need to hear this.
SUPMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Ah, i get it.
SUPFEMALE:Dan it's ok.
OTHERMALE:How a person lives her life is her own business.
OTHERFEMALE:So, jackie, you got drunk and forgot there's a zillion kinds of birth control around? does gary know? No, dan, he doesn't.
SUPMALE:Gary's the father, right? If you say so.
LEADFEMALE:Word of advice from a man don't say a word until you do the test.
LEADFEMALE:Don't upset the guy if you don't have to.
SUPMALE:I was just saying like that very same thing.
LEADMALE:I was saying that if it is positive, be short, sweet, and right to the point.
LEADFEMALE:You know, kind of like "i'm pregnant, dan.
LEADFEMALE:" gary.
SUPMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:Gary.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Gary! We have to do this in front of everybody? We'll go.
LEADFEMALE:How late? Nine days.
LEADMALE:When did this happen? When we were having sex.
LEADMALE:But we're always careful.
LEADMALE:Whoops.
LEADMALE:Come on, honey, go.
SUPMALE:I got to do this.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:You guys did it again, huh? did what? They were listening, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not bad enough this accident is running around? who's an accident? how can somebody be an accident? Oh, great, ask me.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:I'm stressed out, ok? Maybe you could think before opening your mouth.
LEADMALE:Be quiet.
OTHERMALE:I'm trying to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, make some noise.
SUPMALE:I can't believe you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You're so insensitive.
LEADFEMALE:You got a big butt.
LEADFEMALE:Cut it out.
SUPFEMALE:There's no need for this right now.
LEADFEMALE:We shouldn't upset your mother in her condition.
SUPFEMALE:It's true? We don't know yet.
LEADMALE:Keep quiet about it.
LEADMALE:What? Come on, roseanne.
SUPMALE:That test takes 10 minutes.
LEADMALE:Do what you were doing for another 10 minutes.
LEADMALE:8 minutes and 16 seconds.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, d.j. you're welcome.
LEADMALE:I'm so excited about this, i could bust in two.
SUPFEMALE:It's like having a baby myself.
LEADMALE:Well, now, it's not positive yet.
LEADMALE:I know, but thinking about it gets my biological clock ticking away.
SUPMALE:Tick, tick.
LEADMALE:Just hope i can do something about it before the battery dies.
LEADMALE:You want another kid? I hate thinking of my lonnie as an only child.
SUPFEMALE:I regret not having that girl i dreamed about.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:What about you, jackie? Your little clock must be all wound up.
SUPMALE:Crystal i'm a cop.
LEADMALE:Cops can get pregnant just like everyone else.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but when she wakes up depressed, bloated, and hating the whole world, she gets to carry a gun.
SUPMALE:7 minutes and 34 seconds.
SUPMALE:D.j. ! Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal, maybe we better go.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Hang out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm having trouble with this thing.
SUPFEMALE:I got to get another tool.
LEADMALE:The toaster's not even broke.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't want to discuss this.
LEADFEMALE:You ought to go out after him.
LEADMALE:Let him sit out there and nail something else a while.
LEADMALE:I think he's sure the test will come out positive.
LEADFEMALE:Why? I've only been late three times before.
SUPMALE:Here are two of them now.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, we got to talk about this.
LEADFEMALE:Your having a baby is ok if we agree on some conditions.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, i was already talking.
SUPMALE:Get out of here.
LEADMALE:I want to hear your conditions.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's quite all right.
LEADFEMALE:Just go right ahead.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:That's fine.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Let it rip.
LEADFEMALE:Say i brought a puppy into this house.
LEADMALE:It would be my puppy, and i'd care for it.
SUPMALE:You won't have time to care for a puppy with all the work you'll have with the new baby.
LEADMALE:You don't get this, do you? Yeah, you do.
LEADFEMALE:I shouldn't be expected to clean the baby or wash it, watch it while it sleeps, change it i guess what you're saying is three children are enough for this house.
SUPMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:We're going to miss you, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:So, what's your beef? uh, do you think we could maybe are you getting all this, crystal? uh, your clock still ticking? mother, i'm turning 16 this year, right? That depends on what you're about to say.
SUPFEMALE:This is a big year for me.
OTHERMALE:I would maybe get a sweet 16 party.
LEADFEMALE:I can't wear the same clothes.
SUPMALE:God, what would people say? Dad was talking about fixing up some old car for me.
LEADMALE:So? so? So none of this is going to happen! When d.j. was a baby, i was 7.
LEADMALE:I remember it was always, "the baby needs this, and the baby needs that.
SUPFEMALE:" i do without things 'cause i'm the oldest, and don't you want me to go to college? No, becky.
SUPMALE:We want you to work in a bowling alley.
LEADFEMALE:It was kind of our dream.
LEADMALE:You'll never understand how i feel.
LEADMALE:You had a car when you were 16.
LEADFEMALE:That's because when i was 16, i had a job.
SUPMALE:Well, just forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:What were you thinking when you made this baby? I was thinking, "i wonder if i could get pregnant so i could louse up becky's life.
LEADFEMALE:" geez, the little brat.
SUPFEMALE:You can never do enough for them i agree.
SUPFEMALE:Can you believe how selfish she is? I mean go to your room and live in fear! And to think i suckled them.
LEADFEMALE:They're just upset, roseanne.
LEADMALE:It's a lot for them to handle.
LEADMALE:How much longer till this test is over? 4 minutes and 19 seconds! I'm going to make coffee.
LEADMALE:If you don't want to have this baby, you could get an abortion.
LEADMALE:Some say that's murder, roseanne.
LEADMALE:And some say it's not.
SUPFEMALE:And some say you got a choice, but we don't know the test results yet, so we're talking about coffee.
LEADMALE:Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, foreplay for a change.
LEADFEMALE:This shouldn't have happened.
OTHERFEMALE:We took precautions.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they didn't work.
LEADFEMALE:You know your fertile time.
LEADMALE:Well, excuse me for ovulating.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't mean that.
LEADFEMALE:You meant something like that, like it's my fault.
LEADFEMALE:The family thinks it's my fault.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm feeling a little old for this.
LEADMALE:I'm 38.
SUPMALE:What, like i'm 25? We ain't yuppies.
SUPFEMALE:It ain't hip for us to have babies.
OTHERMALE:We had them when we were young and stupid like we were supposed to.
LEADMALE:It's weird that we're going through this again.
LEADMALE:Geez, you are just as bad as the kids.
LEADMALE:We have to go through this whole thing again? Well, maybe if we pull together, we all can make this pregnancy thing a lot easier on us.
LEADMALE:Like i'll carry the baby, but darlene gets the morning sickness, becky gets the backaches, and you get the hemorrhoids.
LEADMALE:After the kid's born, i'll do the diapering, but you get up at night and breast-feed it.
LEADMALE:I've always helped, and i'll help this time.
SUPMALE:Don't call me selfish because i thought we would have time for ourselves.
SUPFEMALE:You've had nine days to adjust.
LEADMALE:I've had 10 minutes.
LEADMALE:Almost done, mom, dad! 1 minute and 58 seconds.
SUPMALE:Thank you, d.j. was i an accident? No, d.j. you were a surprise.
SUPFEMALE:What's the difference? Hmm, well an accident is something that if you had to do it over again, you wouldn't.
LEADFEMALE:But a surprise is something you didn't know you wanted till you got it.
LEADFEMALE:Was darlene an accident? No.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene was a disaster.
OTHERMALE:Darlene says i'm not going to be the baby anymore, so nobody's going to pay any attention to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what, honey, what if we pay lots and lots of attention to you? I'll be happy if you have a baby.
SUPMALE:That's sweet.
SUPFEMALE:I get a chance to kick some butt.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, tradition.
LEADFEMALE:It's a remarkable thing.
LEADMALE:Time! it's time! it's time! I might not be pregnant.
SUPMALE:We might be yelling for no reason.
LEADMALE:We're rehearsing for next time.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:There's not going to be any next time because i'm getting fixed.
OTHERMALE:You mean get your tubes tied? Uh, no, i mean get my knees sewn together.
LEADMALE:I'm serious.
OTHERMALE:That's like an operation.
LEADMALE:You would be in the hospital.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know, dan, it's just a little bit more complicated than, say, a vasectomy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, you know what? You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I could take time and drive you down there.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERFEMALE:So you want to be alone or no.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:What do i do now, jackie? Read the test stick.
SUPMALE:Pink is yes.
OTHERMALE:White is no.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt jackie told me.
LEADMALE:I'll read the stick.
SUPFEMALE:I want to read the stick.
LEADMALE:Geez, d.j. , it's not like licking the spoon.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom! All right, you can.
LEADMALE:Hold it.
LEADMALE:Hold it.
SUPMALE:I have something to say.
SUPFEMALE:All right, if this test is positive, uh, i expect all of your support.
LEADMALE:I'm not even going to ask you for it.
LEADFEMALE:You're just going to give it.
LEADMALE:You can do it.
LEADMALE:Pretend like you're some other family.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:Yep.
SUPFEMALE:All right, go.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Tell us what it is.
LEADMALE:Pink is yes.
SUPMALE:White is no.
LEADFEMALE:It's white.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:Yes! yes! yes! yes! Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'll talk to you later, sis.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for coming by.
LEADFEMALE:That's what i do best.
SUPMALE:I'm going to go shoot some hoops.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:So you'll be here when i get back? Right.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean the stuff i said before.
LEADMALE:Yes, you did.
SUPMALE:Ok, i did, but, um, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Ok? Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, dan, becky wants her driving lesson.
LEADFEMALE:Meet me in the car, beck.
LEADMALE:D.j. , did you eat your breakfast yet? Ok.
SUPFEMALE:What would you have named it? Jack for a boy, and priscilla for a girl.
OTHERMALE:Mom! there's a whole new box on the top shelf! i can't find it! Of course not.
SUPMALE:Well, you want me to stick around? you want some company? Uh, no, i've got company.
OTHERMALE:Kid's got your face.
OTHERMALE:I'm amazed just looking at him.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:None look like me.
SUPFEMALE:That won't stand up in court.
SUPMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to watch tv.
OTHERMALE:I'll clean it up.
SUPMALE:Yeah? All right.
SUPFEMALE:Becky.
LEADFEMALE:I you know that thing you were gonna do, that tube tying thing? I'm not gonna.
LEADMALE:Yeah, ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, don't worry.
OTHERMALE:Everybody's ok.
SUPMALE:There was a little accident.
SUPMALE:I drove them home.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened? I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell the story if you don't mind.
SUPFEMALE:We're going up a hill.
LEADFEMALE:The engine's straining a little.
SUPMALE:I say, "becky, put in low.
LEADFEMALE:" becky puts it in reverse.
LEADFEMALE:Now we're going down the hill to the surprise of the traffic behind us.
LEADMALE:This isn't fair.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think we need to hear from you.
SUPFEMALE:So i'm calm.
LEADFEMALE:I say, "becky, put on the brake.
LEADFEMALE:" she panics.
SUPMALE:She romps on the gas.
SUPMALE:Warp speed, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Cars are swerving, honking.
LEADMALE:I reach over to apply the brake with my hand.
SUPMALE:Then becky remembers where the brake is.
LEADMALE:Did you hit anything? Not yet.
SUPMALE:That didn't happen until you understand how i felt.
LEADMALE:I didn't trust her behind the wheel, so we switch places.
LEADMALE:Your daughter, left the car in reverse.
LEADFEMALE:So, i back into a tree.
LEADMALE:I'm never riding with that man again.
SUPFEMALE:I kept a lid on it 'cause it's family, but i hate to see something like this go unpunished.
SUPMALE:I'll take care of that.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan bedroom.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:1 mother, remember when you told d.j. if he got the bathroom disgusting, he'd have to clean it? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's been spotless ever since.
LEADMALE:That's because the slob's been using our bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Is that why i keep yanking those huge wads of hair out of the drain? One was in so deep, i used your toothbrush to get it out.
LEADMALE:Eeeww! Hey, pig, quit washing your hair in our sink.
SUPFEMALE:It's not my hair.
LEADFEMALE:Then whose is it? Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:It's dead.
OTHERMALE:I'm moving.
LEADMALE:Of all the people in the world to have as a role model, our kid picks eddie munster.
LEADMALE:You thought having a son would be great.
LEADMALE:Well, it would have.
LEADMALE:I'm going down to the lobo.
LEADFEMALE:I'm meeting davey.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to work up a bid for that hanover development.
SUPMALE:You won't be too late, right? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Darlene, beat it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you remember what day it is? It's wednesday.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be back.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be here with bells on.
LEADMALE:Don't you want to know how many? Surprise me.
LEADMALE:Grrr! grrr! Don't come back all bloated.
LEADMALE:Aha! A hair that isn't his.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's mine.
LEADMALE:Whew! Good.
SUPMALE:Anyone seen dad this morning? There's a note on the counter.
OTHERMALE:Hey! Hey.
SUPMALE:Geez.
LEADMALE:Mom, is everything ok? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:There's more orange juice in the fridge.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, ma, can i have 5 bucks for no good reason? It's in my purse.
LEADFEMALE:Something's definitely wrong.
LEADMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:I should have gone for 10.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you got any detergent? Yes, i have detergent.
SUPMALE:I have no marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:So where's the detergent? Jackie, i'm serious.
LEADMALE:What did dan do now? It's what he didn't do in the bedroom last night.
LEADMALE:Well, one night.
LEADFEMALE:Wednesday night.
SUPFEMALE:The night.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
SUPMALE:You guys have a night? Yes, we have a night.
LEADMALE:It's not only wednesday, but it's always wednesday.
LEADFEMALE:You got a time, too? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:20 minutes or until he gets a cramp.
LEADMALE:You should make him wait half an hour after he eats.
LEADFEMALE:This has been working for 17 years.
LEADMALE:Last night, he comes crawling in at 3:00 in the morning.
SUPMALE:Today i get a note without saying he's sorry.
LEADMALE:So he missed one wednesday.
LEADFEMALE:Two wednesdays.
LEADMALE:Ok, two wednesdays.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Around 14, you get numb.
SUPMALE:Hey, i'm not talking about sexual frustration.
LEADMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:I think dan's having an affair, jackie.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Dan? why, you think he's ugly? you think he's stupid? you don't think women want to sleep with him? I think there's millions of women who would sleep with dan.
LEADMALE:Who? Tell me! You're really serious.
LEADMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:He comes in late, he's totally preoccupied, and then he's laying there in bed making all these little happy noises.
SUPFEMALE:If we're not having wednesday, what's he so happy about? Just 'cause you guys aren't having wednesday doesn't mean that he's out wednesday-ing somebody else.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't this what a man does before he walks out? what are you asking me for? Ok, we'll go down the checklist.
LEADFEMALE:What's the first thing he does when he comes in? He goes to the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? Nothing.
LEADMALE:It was no-nothing.
LEADFEMALE:That was a noise, like a check mark kind of a noise.
LEADMALE:I just meant that if you want to be suspicious, he could be washing up so you don't smell any perfume.
LEADMALE:I've been smelling dan as often as i can.
OTHERFEMALE:And? He smells like smoke.
LEADFEMALE:He says he's going to the lobo.
LEADFEMALE:It smells like smoke down there.
LEADMALE:He can have the kids, but i'm keeping the house! Now, come on, roseanne.
LEADMALE:This is dan we're talking about.
LEADMALE:You owe him a little trust.
SUPMALE:Just give him another chance.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:What's the worst that can happen? Mmm mmm ooh ooh, hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh dan! shh! It's my wife.
LEADFEMALE:Wake up! What? what were you doing? Sleeping.
SUPMALE:With who? I don't know what you're talking about.
LEADMALE:Who is she, dan? who's who? are you cheating on me? where'd you get that from? From laying there watching you slobber over your pillow.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder who you're slobbering all over.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody.
LEADMALE:Nobody? then who is mmm mmm? All right, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I've been having a dream about you know, sex.
OTHERFEMALE:But i'm not cheating on you.
LEADMALE:It's just a dream? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Are you dreaming about us? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? I don't believe you.
LEADMALE:You come in late, crawl in my bed, and dream about other women.
OTHERMALE:It's not lots of other women.
LEADMALE:It's just one woman.
SUPFEMALE:That did not help me.
OTHERFEMALE:The same woman every time? At least i'm faithful.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne! Roseanne, i'm dreaming, not cheating.
LEADFEMALE:You're dreaming about cheating.
LEADMALE:I can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:Who is she, one of those women in your magazines? you think i'd go for that? It's a redhead at the hardware store in the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, dan! Rosie i don't even know her.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know why i'm dreaming about her.
LEADFEMALE:I just am.
LEADMALE:I can't help it.
SUPFEMALE:It's late.
OTHERFEMALE:We're both tired.
SUPFEMALE:Let's talk about this tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh, you can't wait to get back to sleep, can you? Well, you're hitting the couch, buddy! Roseanne.
SUPMALE:And take your little tramp with you! Aw, come on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:It didn't mean anything.
LEADFEMALE:What if i had dreams every night about the same guy and we were going at it like sex maniacs? I'd say take lots of naps.
SUPFEMALE:You love the gutter, don't you? No, roseanne, jackie's right.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's just normal and healthy.
LEADMALE:Why, i, too, have dreams of a carnal nature.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not ashamed to say that they are often volcanic in their intensity.
LEADMALE:Are they about the same guy every time? Usually.
LEADMALE:Who? Oh, never you mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Pat sajak.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god! And you will be surprised to know that he's a very tender lover with a virile and wiry little body.
LEADMALE:We don't have the hours to deal with your many problems, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Can we just deal with my problems now? so anyway, you're saying that you never, ever have these dreams? Yeah, but my dreams are always about dan.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's so romantic.
LEADMALE:Of course he looks like sean connery, you know, and he has that accent, but i know it's dan.
OTHERFEMALE:You're such a hypocrite.
SUPFEMALE:You can dream about sean connery, but dan can't dream about some cute little redhead? I said it's not sean connery! Hey, roseanne, cup of coffee.
LEADMALE:We're trying to have a private conversation here, carl.
LEADFEMALE:What did i say? I said, "cup of coffee.
LEADMALE:" i got a mall to protect.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not here to yak about bikini wax, though i've given a few in my time.
LEADFEMALE:One coffee to go! Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends? Yes.
LEADMALE:That's my sister jackie and my girlfriend crystal.
LEADMALE:Crystal, jackie, this is carl.
LEADFEMALE:He's a big loser.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like cream, carl? Yes, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, are you the sister who's a cop? Yeah, but i'm off the force.
OTHERMALE:Got hurt in the line of duty.
LEADMALE:Really? That's great.
OTHERMALE:God, i hope to get hurt someday.
OTHERFEMALE:You like guns? I got some beauties at home.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we can get together and kill something.
LEADMALE:What? what's good for you friday, saturday? Never.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, good.
LEADMALE:We'll leave it open.
LEADFEMALE:Well, see you, ladies.
LEADMALE:Um, carl.
LEADFEMALE:Don't call him back here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? You say you know everyone in the mall.
LEADMALE:It's my job, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's this woman i know her.
OTHERMALE:She works at fillmore's hardware store, a little redhead.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, just let it drop.
LEADFEMALE:I want to know what she's got that i ain't got.
LEADMALE:Marge dolman? what about her? No way.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Ain't there somebody else that works there, some cute little foxy thing? Nope.
LEADFEMALE:She's it.
SUPMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:She's cute! Why is he dreaming about her? She could be younger.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe that's it.
LEADFEMALE:You think so? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You're much older than she is.
SUPFEMALE:You could be her mother.
SUPMALE:I'm going to pretend you didn't say that, crystal.
OTHERMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:Is anyone going to tell me what's going on? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I get it.
SUPMALE:I'm out of here.
SUPMALE:Call me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to go over and talk to her.
LEADMALE:No, don't! She's dan's dream woman, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:I want to see what it is about her.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm your waitress roseanne conner, dan's wife and mother of his three children.
SUPMALE:Can i order now? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich, but not in that order.
LEADMALE:Mayonnaise on the bread, tomato, then lettuce, then bacon.
SUPMALE:Whole wheat toast, lightly toasted.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Put the mayo on the side.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, put everything on the side.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll put it together.
SUPMALE:You won't get it right.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Well? Well, she's not just cute.
LEADFEMALE:She's got a great personality.
SUPMALE:So, dad, rode the sofa again last night, eh? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:What's with you and mom? You guys never sleep apart.
SUPMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:I just fell asleep watching tv.
LEADFEMALE:Two nights in a row? Shut up, darlene.
OTHERMALE:Come on.

LEADMALE:And enough lead time to let us decide who to live with.
SUPMALE:I'll get it.

LEADMALE:What? Dad, she was flirting with you.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? That religion lady was coming on to you.
LEADMALE:You're crazy! Dad, she winked at you.
LEADFEMALE:"you must get all your good looks from yo' daddy"? That doesn't mean anything.
SUPMALE:Dad's got a girlfriend wait till mom finds out.
SUPMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody goes to school.
SUPFEMALE:Is that lady my new mom? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Scram.

LEADMALE:How could you do this? Oh, danny, don't be mad.
LEADFEMALE:This is my home, my family.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, danny.

OTHERFEMALE:I am not asking, danny.
LEADMALE:I am taking.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh! dan! i knew it! No, roseanne.
LEADMALE:This is a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:You bet it is! no! no, don't! don't shoot! no! don't shoot! no! Dan, you want to wake up the whole house? Geez, that was a bad one.
LEADFEMALE:What, you and marge have a little tiff? who? Your dream girl from the hardware store, marge dolman.
SUPFEMALE:That's her name? marge dolman? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:She came over to the restaurant today.
LEADFEMALE:I thought she was cute, but jackie and crystal both thought you could do a lot better.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:You told jackie and crystal.
LEADMALE:Well, i have to know.
SUPMALE:I'm trying to figure out what you see in her.
LEADFEMALE:Is she sexier than me? No.
LEADMALE:Does she make you laugh? No laughs.
OTHERFEMALE:Is she better than me? I'm thirsty.
SUPFEMALE:You thirsty? Well, help me out, dan.
OTHERMALE:Ok, if you were dreaming about somebody like, oh, say, kathleen turner, then i'd just go, "ok, he's a pig," but this woman i mean, i just don't get it.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I hardly know her.
SUPFEMALE:I want something at the hardware store, she knows exactly where it is, what to charge me.
SUPFEMALE:So when you leave, you're getting exactly what you want? I got to lay down for this.
LEADMALE:Ok, doc, i hated my father, and i wanted to marry my mother.
SUPMALE:Go.
SUPMALE:What is it that she does in these dreams? Stop it! no, come on! I want to know what she does in the dreams that's so great so i can, you know, do that.
LEADMALE:It's personal.
SUPMALE:I'm your wife.
LEADFEMALE:I wash your shorts.
OTHERMALE:You can tell me.
SUPFEMALE:I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Well, would it help any if was to tell you that i got some needs, too? like what? I asked you first.
OTHERMALE:I asked you second.
LEADMALE:You tell me.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:In the dream she treats me like i'm some kind of irresistible sex toy.
LEADMALE:Get out of here! I'm so glad i got that off my chest.
LEADMALE:That's what you like? Go away! No, dan.
SUPMALE:I mean, how come we can do it, but we can't talk about it? Maybe you think we're in some kind of a rut.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you want to try something new.
LEADMALE:Well maybe we could forget about wednesdays and try to be a little more, you know spontaneous.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, fine.
SUPMALE:Now, this is great.
SUPFEMALE:See? We're talking.
SUPMALE:It's great.
LEADMALE:What else? That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, what does she do in the dream? Roseanne, this is really tough for me.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but it's healthy, honey.
OTHERMALE:Please? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me.
SUPFEMALE:Dream on! here! oh! He loves me.
SUPMALE:He loves me not.
LEADMALE:One more, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:He loves me.
SUPMALE:Oh, lookee, lookee, lookee! Oh, please, please, please.
LEADMALE:Please, please, please, please.
SUPFEMALE:Please, please, please, please.
SUPMALE:Hi, marge.
OTHERMALE:Oh, god.
OTHERMALE:I wanted to say thanks, and i'll take it from here.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:What did you think i was going to say? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:You're capable of doing anything at any time.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:Crazy, impulsive, spontaneous get in here.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, we're in an elevator! So? Hurry up.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:1 what kind of theater is this? you're in camelot but have no lines? I got a line "enter, lancelot, the queen awaits.
OTHERMALE:" that's it? I don't say it, he don't come on, there's no play.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know phil hanley? from hanley's sporting goods? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:He's lancelot.
SUPMALE:He's backstage with shirley clemens.
OTHERMALE:From tastee freeze? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Queen guinevere.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, they don't know i'm there.
LEADFEMALE:They're into some serious tongue jousting.
SUPFEMALE:I thought he was doing it with that girl in the quik-foto booth.
LEADMALE:I hear they almost knocked that sucker over.
LEADMALE:You want to know something else? bill cheevers, who's done make-up the last 10 years lives with his mother? I know all about him.
SUPFEMALE:Totally straight.
LEADMALE:Get out of here.
SUPMALE:Hetero from the word go.
LEADMALE:Hold that thought.
LEADFEMALE:Got to yell at the girls.
LEADFEMALE:I said if you came home late i'd kick your butt! Think you're big enough? Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on! come on! come on! What's going on? The girls are late.
LEADFEMALE:Why do we bother setting any curfew? They just come home when they want.
SUPFEMALE:They're just a little late.
SUPFEMALE:An hour late, and they don't even care that we're worried sick about them.
OTHERFEMALE:Gin.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you're real worried.
LEADMALE:We're setting rules, and they're ignoring us.
SUPFEMALE:And it's for their own good.
LEADFEMALE:A lot can happen to two teenage girls an hour after the mall closes.
LEADFEMALE:That's why we want them here.
SUPFEMALE:We just don't want them out there.
OTHERMALE:You want some coffee, dan? Sure.
SUPMALE:Run! whoa, whoa, whoa! Where the hell you been? We're really sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:About what? that you didn't come home when we said to, that you never learned how to use a phone? or that you may never see the light of day again? That'd be the one.
LEADMALE:It's only 10:00.
SUPMALE:Meaning you're an hour late.
LEADFEMALE:You're always an hour late.
LEADMALE:Well, then we're on time.
SUPMALE:We said 9:00, we meant 9:00.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, 'cause we have this really crazy idea that you actually listen when we speak.
OTHERMALE:When you're late, we figure there's a reason.
LEADMALE:If we're not hearing that reason from you, we make up our own reason, like you're laying in a ditch somewhere.
LEADMALE:We would have called, but there was no phone in the ditch.
OTHERMALE:Ha ha? You're grounded.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha ha.
OTHERFEMALE:And you're home tomorrow night, and you're very, very sorry.
LEADMALE:Am i right? Yes.
LEADMALE:We didn't mean to make you worry.
LEADFEMALE:It'll never happen again.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Get upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, you grounded them real good that time.
LEADMALE:Thank you, thank you.
LEADMALE:Think it'll work? As good as it did the last 12 times.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you should try something else.
LEADFEMALE:I mean it.
SUPFEMALE:You should talk to them like they're adults.
LEADMALE:They're people.
LEADFEMALE:They can listen to reason.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, jackie's still here.
LEADFEMALE:Just smile and nod.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on! This is good advice.
SUPMALE:Hey, what-cha doing? I'm packing d.j. 's duffel bag.
LEADFEMALE:He's staying over at warren's house tonight.
LEADMALE:You think that's a good idea? didn't warren tie all those squirrels together? No! That was d.j. little warren just stunned them.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, get that, would you? Sure.
LEADMALE:Why not? I have nothing else to do, god knows except for trying to pack a bag for d.j. you come in like you're going to say "jump," and i'm supposed to go, "how high?" mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner? yeah? Flowers for you.
SUPFEMALE:What's the catch, i have to buy something? No.
LEADFEMALE:You just take them.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Did you send me flowers, dan? No.
LEADMALE:Why would i do that? Right.
SUPMALE:Like, you'd never be romantic enough to do something like that for no reason.
LEADFEMALE:"dear roseanne, i lied.
SUPMALE:They're from me.
LEADMALE:Love, dan.
LEADMALE:" you scum! I love you, too, dear.
SUPMALE:Why'd you do this? Let me paint the picture.
SUPFEMALE:20 years ago today, i picked you up in my dad's el camino, a little zeppelin on the eight-track, a little boone's farm apple warming up in the glove compartment.
SUPFEMALE:Our first date.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Our first date was a motorcycle in the a&w drive-in.
SUPFEMALE:This is the anniversary of our first time.
LEADFEMALE:Our second date! no! As i recall, i was able to fend you off just a little bit longer.
LEADFEMALE:I remember driving to that quaint little restaurant.
SUPMALE:The blue swan cafe.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Nestled in the heart of the blue swan motel out there on highway 72.
LEADMALE:I had a new york steak.
LEADMALE:You had the shrimp cocktail and chicken parmesan.
SUPFEMALE:I thought that was so chic.
SUPFEMALE:The guy said, "for the lady.
LEADMALE:" he meant me, and i was really excited about that.
LEADFEMALE:That was the night i asked you to be my girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:You said you'd make me the happiest girl in the whole usa.
LEADMALE:Mom, the toilet's broken.
SUPMALE:Liar.
OTHERMALE:Anyhow, remember how we said we'd be more crazy and spontaneous? Well, tonight i booked two dinner reservations at the blue swan cafe.
SUPMALE:Oh, how romantic! I hope we get that same booth, the one with the view of the interstate.
LEADFEMALE:And just the scent of diesel in the air.
OTHERFEMALE:It's getting so's i can hardly smell a truck anymore without thinking of you.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Where you going? You're grounded.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:We were late on thursday, so we were grounded last night.
SUPMALE:Tonight, we are free.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, so where you going? Me and dana are going to the mall.
LEADMALE:They're taking me to marcy's.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, since it's saturday, you've got till 11:00.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be home early to check, so one minute late, and we'll have your butts in a sling.
LEADMALE:You look real nice, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:11:00.
LEADFEMALE:Not nice, thin! thin! Tell me about the first time you ever saw me.
SUPFEMALE:You were coming out of study hall, and you were wearing those tight corduroys, and they were making this sound like they were calling my name.
LEADFEMALE:"dan conner, "dan conner, dan conner.
LEADFEMALE:" steak for you chicken parmesan for you.
LEADFEMALE:45 minutes for a rare steak.
SUPFEMALE:I'd ask for steak sauce, but i got to be at work monday morning.
OTHERMALE:It's 10:30.
LEADMALE:We won't be home till after 11:00.
LEADFEMALE:Call home.
SUPMALE:Tell the girls we'll be late.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, no? Well, this grounding stuff doesn't seem to be working, so let them worry about us for a while.
LEADMALE:I'll tell jackie to freak them out for a while.
LEADMALE:Later she can tell them what's really going on.
LEADFEMALE:Lady, you have an evil mind.
SUPMALE:And a body to match.
LEADFEMALE:What was the second thing you noticed about me? what, what, what? Oh, those big brown eyes, like two chained dobermans waiting to rip your leg off.
SUPFEMALE:Good, good, good.
SUPMALE:Keep going.
LEADMALE:Uh-uh.
SUPMALE:It's your turn.
SUPMALE:What did you like about me? The fact that you asked me out.
LEADMALE:What else? That's about it.
LEADFEMALE:So if tommy jorgensen would've asked you out, you'd be mrs.
LEADMALE:Tommy jorgensen? Like tommy jorgensen would've ever asked me out! get off the sympathy wagon! Plenty of guys were standing in line for you to treat them like dirt.
OTHERFEMALE:I was just the lucky one.
LEADMALE:Now i remember what i liked about you you could spread it on so thick.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, roseanne, what about me made you quiver? I'd have to say it was the forearms.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:There were the biggest, manliest, meatiest hunks of flesh i ever laid eyes on.
SUPMALE:The pythons, huh? I remember sneaking looks at you in class, and you'd start rolling your sleeve up slow just to tease me.
LEADFEMALE:It was all i could do to keep from climbing over all those desks and just throwing you to the floor.
LEADMALE:You know, since we're not rushing home, maybe after dinner we could see if they got our old room vacant.
SUPMALE:Oh! I never thought i'd say this, dan, but let's skip dessert.
LEADMALE:Darlene! 10 minutes isn't much! Don't sweat it.
SUPFEMALE:They're not home.
OTHERMALE:Then i'm not late, right? Don't worry, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't rat on you.
LEADMALE:You know, now that you mention it, though, it is kind of strange they're not back yet.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't mention it.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder where they could be.
LEADFEMALE:You want some ice cream? Sure.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? A load of laundry.
OTHERMALE:Nah.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure they're ok.
LEADMALE:Ow! ooh! ow! Oh, they're not home yet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Cool.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne? Oh, becky.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What's she doing here? Laundry.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, she won't tell.
LEADMALE:It's weird they're not here.
LEADFEMALE:After that whole deal about curfew, i thought i'd be grounded before opening the door.
OTHERMALE:This is the stuff they live for.
SUPMALE:Here you go.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:You're not having any? No.
LEADMALE:I'm not really hungry all of a sudden.
LEADFEMALE:So, you girls have fun tonight? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It was ok.
LEADMALE:What did you do? Well, i i'm going to go make a phone call.
SUPMALE:Crystal? Hi.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know it's late.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Uh, have you heard from roseanne? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, thanks.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Crystal says hi.
LEADMALE:Aunt jackie, what's going on? It's not like your folks to be this late.
LEADMALE:Maybe their car broke down again.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's probably it.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy, this is the kind of night that cops hate.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of accidents.
LEADMALE:But i'm sure they're ok.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder what's taking them so long.
LEADMALE:You don't think there's a problem, do you? so, what do you want to do now? what did we do 20 years ago? Let's see.
OTHERMALE:You were in the bathroom putting on a fresh coat of white lipstick.
LEADMALE:And you were out on the pay phone bragging to your buddies.
LEADMALE:I still do that.
LEADMALE:I remember we filled up that huge bathtub and played voyage to the bottom of the sea.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah! you kept going, "ow-oo-gah! Ow-oo-gah!" let's do that again.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:This time i get to be captain nemo.
LEADMALE:Heave-ho! No towel-snapping.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not making any promises.
LEADFEMALE:Say, would you look at that? Boy, that tub got a lot smaller.
OTHERFEMALE:It's really icing up out there.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are they out so late? you getting worried? No.
SUPFEMALE:You? No.
LEADFEMALE:How long could it take to eat dinner? if they were going to be this late, how come they didn't call? This is so weird, 'cause they were just saying they worry when we're late.
SUPMALE:And here we are worrying about them.
SUPFEMALE:Incredible coincidence or a lesson for the kiddies? You make the call.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt jackie's doing laundry at 11:30 on saturday? But there's no laundry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, i just can't believe that one.
LEADMALE:Isn't this just a little bit too cutesy for them? They've been watching too much tv.
OTHERFEMALE:So aunt jackie is just here to make sure we worry.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we can't let her down now, can we? still no sign of them, eh? Mm-mmm.
LEADFEMALE:I got to admit, guys, i'm starting to get worried.
SUPMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm calling the police.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:We can't do that.
LEADMALE:Why not? You'd have to say it was a missing persons thing, and they don't like that.
SUPMALE:But maybe mom and dad are missing.
LEADMALE:Well, they're not missing enough.
LEADMALE:They have to be missing for 24 hours before the cops will do that missing person thing.
OTHERMALE:If they're not missing, then what are they? I mean, even mom and dad can't eat dinner for four hours.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god! they could be dead! Let's not go crazy here.
LEADFEMALE:They're dead! they're big giant street pizzas, and they're out on the highway all squishy! those 18 wheels running over them squish! squish! mommy, daddy! Are we done now? But we're so worried.
LEADMALE:You are rotten, rotten kids, and i can't even believe i'm related to you two! Oh, does that mean you won't adopt us? what will become of us, darlene? We'll be orphans.
LEADFEMALE:The sun will come out tomorrow you two are very funny.
SUPMALE:Bet your bottom dollar knock it off! So your mom's little idea didn't work.
OTHERMALE:That's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we discuss this curfew thing as adults, ok? All right.
SUPFEMALE:Um let's see.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, don't think of curfew as a punishment.
LEADFEMALE:See, your parents don't think of it that way.
LEADMALE:To them, it's a way of showing their concern.
OTHERFEMALE:So, think of curfew as your parents' way of saying i love you.
LEADFEMALE:I curfew, darlene.
LEADMALE:Well, i curfew, too, beck.
LEADFEMALE:All right, that's it.
SUPFEMALE:Upstairs! You're grounded.
SUPFEMALE:You're rotten, rotten, rotten, rotten kids! Tomorrow tomorrow what are you doing? You took extra cheese.
SUPMALE:Cheese fell off my slice.
LEADFEMALE:I put it back on.
LEADFEMALE:It pulled cheese off this piece.
SUPMALE:Eat the other piece.
OTHERFEMALE:I want the one with the brown bubble on it! You're not getting my cheese.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:What? Well, we could be having this argument at home, and it wouldn't cost 14 bucks an hour.
LEADMALE:What, you want to go home? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Do you? No! We can't go home yet.
LEADFEMALE:This is a romantic thing.
SUPFEMALE:We're celebrating a great moment in our life.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Hey, bonanza's on! No.
LEADFEMALE:But that was the one where hoss finds the leprechauns.
SUPFEMALE:We're not watching tv.
OTHERMALE:Well, what do you want to do? Hey.
LEADMALE:The vibrating bed.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I forgot how much i used to love that.
OTHERMALE:Remember? we couldn't get enough of it and we only had two quarters? And one was for the wine.
LEADMALE:Only the best for my baby.
LEADMALE:Should i crank it up? Crank away, my bishop of love.
LEADFEMALE:Yee-hee! ride 'em, cowboy! whoo! this is awesome! dan? yeah? I'm going to throw up! hurry! Let's go home.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we're getting too old for this.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:It was great, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Great as the last time? Better.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know why? 'cause this time we're in love.
OTHERFEMALE:I was in love the other time.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:Thanks for walking me to my door, mr.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome, miss harris.
LEADMALE:Are you ever going to call me again, or is it just "wham, bam, thank you, roseanne"? Don't say that.
OTHERFEMALE:You're my girl.
LEADFEMALE:I want to tell you something i never told anybody before.
SUPFEMALE:This was my first time.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:How about a good night kiss? Oh, maybe one.
SUPFEMALE:One more.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ok.
LEADMALE:Remember that night when we played one more kiss for about half an hour? the door opened, and it was my dad? In his underwear.
LEADFEMALE:He was reading us the riot act.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy's not here now.
LEADMALE:Where have you been? do you know what time it is? couldn't you pick up a phone? We thought you were dead in a ditch.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think our ploy worked, dear.
LEADMALE:I know let's try something new.
LEADMALE:You're grounded! do we have to hey, hey! let us in! hey, come on! it's cold! That's what we needed all along.
LEADFEMALE:Now they can't wait to come home.
LEADMALE:Let us in! come on! come on! Let us in! 
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:1 what should we do this weekend? can we drink beer and watch football on tv? huh? can we? please, please? Ok, just this once.
SUPMALE:Hello? Oh, hi, ma.
SUPMALE:Bye, ma.
LEADFEMALE:You're not interrupting anything.
LEADFEMALE:Dan and i, we're just having sex.
LEADMALE:Hey, deej, what you watching? Hey, laurel and hardy.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to see my boy has such discriminating taste.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't.
SUPMALE:He just likes movies where the actors are dead.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i have some bad news.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma harris isn't going to be making her usual holiday visit this year.
LEADMALE:What a shame.
LEADFEMALE:You know, we're going to miss her.
LEADMALE:I know, but cheer up because she's coming tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't you stop her? Oh, i think it's great.
LEADMALE:That's because she loves you.
LEADFEMALE:Because i'm nice to her.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You're such a suck-up queen.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:This means we're stuck here on our saturday night? Hey, this is my mother who we all love.
SUPMALE:Besides, if you're not here, she'll talk to me, and nobody wants that.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it'll be great two hours of tense conversation followed by a delightful dinner from hell.
LEADFEMALE:Help your brother clean up his room for grandma.
SUPFEMALE:I want it to sparkle.
SUPFEMALE:Well, just pick up the big chunks.
OTHERMALE:I'll get the big chunks down here.
SUPMALE:Suck-up.
LEADFEMALE:I'll hide in the garage.
SUPFEMALE:Throw a stick at the window when she's gone.
OTHERMALE:Chicken.
LEADFEMALE:I hate how we act when she's around.
LEADFEMALE:You get crazy, the kids get weird, and i become captain son-in-law, fending off deadly insults with his invincible phony grin of steel.
OTHERMALE:I'll call jackie and tell her mom's coming.
LEADMALE:Like she'll rush right over after that fight they had.
LEADFEMALE:She'll be here.
LEADFEMALE:It's her mother.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:No, watch and learn.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, it's me.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing today? I was going to, like, make some fudge and watch that kevin costner movie on cable.
LEADMALE:You know, the one where he's butt-naked? Great.
LEADMALE:3:00 will be swell.
SUPFEMALE:She loves her mother.
LEADMALE:We were there for three days.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's your dad with a cactus.
OTHERMALE:It seems like it's raising its arms.
LEADMALE:Here's dad playing stick-'em-up with the cactus.
SUPMALE:Here he's doing the same thing.
SUPMALE:And here again.
LEADMALE:He really thought this was funny.
LEADFEMALE:How about some more coffee, grandma? Thank you, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene! So when's jackie coming? Don't tell me she's still mad.
LEADMALE:No, she'll be coming over.
LEADMALE:Be nice to her this time.
SUPMALE:I'm always nice to her.
LEADMALE:That's why you tell her how dumping gary was the worst mistake of her life and how she'll end up a lonely, bitter old maid.
OTHERFEMALE:That's how we talk.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, i'll be good.
SUPMALE:Hi, grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you come say hi when i got here? why didn't you come up and say hi? Look who forgot to give grandma a great big kiss.
SUPMALE:Here you go, grandma.
LEADFEMALE:I put in skim milk and brown sugar, just the way you like it.
LEADFEMALE:Becky is certainly blossoming into a beautiful young woman.
LEADFEMALE:Feel free to speak directly to her, mom.
LEADMALE:She's that blonde sitting next to you there.
LEADMALE:Anyone special these days i should know about? There's this guy who just moved here from evanston.
SUPFEMALE:He asked me out tonight.
LEADMALE:What did you tell him? Well, nothing yet, but she knows you rarely visit, and she'd rather spend that time with you.
LEADMALE:Well, that's just silly.
OTHERMALE:You can't waste an evening with me when you could be having fun.
LEADFEMALE:Why the hell not? Thanks, grandma.
SUPMALE:I'll wear that silk blouse you got for my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:I better make a call.
SUPMALE:Guess i'll go out, too.
SUPMALE:If it rains, i'll wear those galoshes you got me.
LEADMALE:You stay here with us.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to stay.
SUPFEMALE:I want to go out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now where would you be going? what's that supposed to mean? Darlene, when you're a big girl like becky you'll get to go on dates, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a damn minute! Ok, darlene, get out in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:She can't decide who's old enough to go out and who isn't.
SUPFEMALE:Don't talk to her like that.
LEADMALE:Why can becky go out? Becky had a date.
SUPMALE:Well, so could i.
SUPMALE:Grandma acts like i'm 3 years old.
LEADFEMALE:You are acting like you missed your nap.
LEADFEMALE:I bet becky doesn't even have a date.
LEADMALE:I've got enough going on.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need any more trouble from you.
LEADMALE:I hate her.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going, honey? Run away.
OTHERFEMALE:Run away.
OTHERMALE:It's a shame becky has to go out the one night i'm in town.
LEADFEMALE:You just told her to go.
LEADMALE:Talk to her.
OTHERMALE:Have her at least stay for dinner.
SUPMALE:You talk to her.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want her to be mad at me.
OTHERFEMALE:No, she can be mad at me.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Well, i need to visit the little girls' room.
SUPFEMALE:62 years old and she still says the little girls' room.
LEADMALE:Bring on the fudge and kevin costnerâs butt.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm ready to sink my teeth into both of them.
LEADMALE:How you doing, sis? roseanne, are these towels clean? You are just evil.
LEADMALE:Is that jackie? Oh, no, you don't! let me go! she's your mother! Don't make me hurt you, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You're going to get up and stay here.
LEADMALE:Grow up.
LEADMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:Mom, hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, tell me, roseanne.
LEADMALE:How many women can look that good without a drop of makeup? And your hair's adorable.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i'm almost glad your dad couldn't make it.
LEADFEMALE:This give us girls a chance to have some fun.
LEADFEMALE:This is mom, isn't it? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I better check that birthmark she's got.
LEADMALE:No, 665.
LEADMALE:Close enough.
OTHERMALE:I heard from mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Quigley.
SUPMALE:Our old neighbor? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:She said everybody's fine, and her little jeffrey should be out of prison soon.
LEADFEMALE:Those eight years just flew by, didn't they? remember when jeffrey talked you into playing spin the bottle? Yeah.
LEADMALE:He kissed me and his retainer fell off in my mouth.
LEADFEMALE:My little angel was playing spin the bottle? Sure, jackie, now you got me in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Ground her, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Ground her.
SUPMALE:Ground her.
SUPFEMALE:Anything else you want to tell me while i'm knee-deep in this cheap chardonnay? Ok.
LEADMALE:Remember this one weekend when you and dad went to one of his furniture conventions? oh oh, what? you two have some kind of wild party? Yeah in chicago.
LEADMALE:In chicago.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:Now she's thinking now.
SUPFEMALE:Will she yell at us for something we did over 22 years ago, or there you go.
LEADMALE:Ok, mom.
OTHERMALE:You two are terrible.
LEADMALE:Hey, i have one that's even better.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Remember my friend jeanine? You used to stay at her house till all hours.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, well there was no jeanine.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanine was dan! Roseanne, i thought you were studying.
LEADFEMALE:I always got good marks.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, mostly on your neck.
SUPMALE:All right, it's my turn.
LEADFEMALE:Remember the design school i applied to that never answered back? Well, i actually got in.
SUPMALE:You were accepted? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Only i threw the letter away before you guys could see it.
LEADMALE:You knew how much we wanted you to go there.
SUPMALE:Well, i didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Remember when i told you guys that ringo actually called me up on the phone? I guess now we see what happens when we squander our opportunities.
LEADFEMALE:Don't start, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe if you'd gone to design school you'd have a career instead of wasting my life bouncing from one meaningless job to the next.
LEADMALE:You guys, come on.
SUPMALE:Let's grab a vegetable and start chopping.
LEADFEMALE:No, she's going to tell me everything i've ever done wrong in my life.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I know you're dying to.
SUPMALE:I wish for once i didn't have to.
LEADMALE:I'll make it easy for you i'm a screw-up.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you're not a screw-up.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, you tell her she's not a screw-up.
SUPMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:What is it with you? why can't you let her live her life? Because she had potential.
SUPFEMALE:She had a spark.
SUPFEMALE:We just didn't want to see it wasted.
OTHERFEMALE:Your father and i said to each other, "there's no limit to what jackie can do.
SUPMALE:" you guys said that? you said i got a spark? Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Your father was convinced you'd be a lawyer because you loved to argue.
SUPMALE:Really? why do you think we worried so much? We never worried about roseanne.
LEADMALE:We knew what she'd be.
LEADMALE:Oh? what? Safe and comfortable and a good mommy, just like you are now.
LEADMALE:So what are you saying, mother? you're saying that all i could ever be is some ordinary housewife? Roseanne, you have a nice house, beautiful children a husband.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing wrong at all with being ordinary.
LEADMALE:Hey, how's it going? Run away.
LEADFEMALE:Run away.
LEADFEMALE:So my mother's in there doing these back flips over jackie.
LEADMALE:I'm the one that turned out ok.
SUPMALE:Jackie's a screw-up.
LEADFEMALE:Roll with it, honey.
LEADMALE:Roll with it? what the hell is that supposed to mean? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I figured it was my turn to speak.
OTHERFEMALE:That's ok.
SUPMALE:I finished watching the whole game.
LEADMALE:This was just the overtime.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really hurt here, you know? I just can't believe it was always, like, jackie could be this great astronaut or the president, and roseanne could be some great organ donor.
SUPFEMALE:Dad? Oh, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:What is it, darlene? Actually, it was dad i wanted to talk to.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there he is.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Marcy just called and invited me over for dinner.
LEADMALE:No, you're here tonight.
LEADMALE:I don't appreciate your going over my head.
LEADMALE:If i say no, he says no.
SUPFEMALE:Right? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:It's one night, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Ok? One night out of your entire life, and i think that you can just roll with it.
LEADMALE:That's sound advice, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Now go on and get in there.
LEADFEMALE:You come too, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have a nice family dinner.
SUPFEMALE:This is really good.
SUPMALE:Oh, i don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:It seems ordinary to me.
SUPMALE:I never learned how to cook.
SUPFEMALE:You had other talents, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Really? like what? would you like some salt? Roseanne, you know i'm not allowed salt.
LEADMALE:Can i have more potatoes? Here you are, dear.
LEADMALE:Roseanne also keeps this house going like a well-oiled machine.
LEADFEMALE:How does she manage with her job and other stuff? like what stuff? Like like the, um pta committee.
OTHERMALE:How do they manage without her? I quit that over two years ago, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Obviously your work there was finished, honey.
LEADFEMALE:And she sold over 50 tickets to the elks' glaucoma dance.
LEADMALE:Which means i can dial a phone, huh? And d.j. has scouts every saturday, which also means i had to master the fine art of driving.
LEADMALE:Boy, i'm just a regular renaissance woman, aren't i? Becky, honey, tell me about the boy you're dating.
LEADFEMALE:All my friends think he's really cute.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you're lucky becky's so popular.
OTHERFEMALE:When you start dating she can give you some pointers.
SUPMALE:If she's so popular, ask her which one of us got felt up.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, leave the table.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i knew that would do it.
OTHERFEMALE:I have an idea let's skip dessert.
LEADMALE:I'm full.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, how about some of your fabulous dutch apple pie? you make that with cinnamon, right? Nutmeg, mom.
SUPMALE:1 1/4 teaspoons of nutmeg.
LEADMALE:You know, speaking of pies, one day when these two were knee-high to a grasshopper, i went out back to call them for supper.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie was over by the fence building a village out of those legos.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, it was quite a project, believe me.
LEADMALE:She had traffic lights and skyscrapers and hospitals and we get the picture, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, roseanne was nowhere to be seen.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i looked and looked and finally found her behind that big maple tree near the ditch.
LEADFEMALE:There she sat in her white ruffled dress completely covered with dirt and making mud pies.
LEADMALE:So you see, roseanne, making pies must be in your blood.
SUPFEMALE:Speaking of blood what time you shoving off tomorrow, bev? Grandma, i've got to go.
LEADMALE:But we haven't talked.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:What do you want to talk about? Maybe she wants to talk about my mashed potatoes, how creamy smooth they are.
SUPMALE:Maybe, huh? Or maybe my biscuits.
LEADFEMALE:How light and airy, the way they just fly across the room.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe she wants to talk about the other 10 million ordinary things i do in my ordinary life.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Is she getting enough iron? hey, hey, what is your problem? My problem is i've got no spark.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I didn't have to end up ordinary if she'd expected anything like she did you.
LEADMALE:You missed out on the chance to be a neurotic mess.
LEADMALE:It ain't right, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:She should've treated us the same.
LEADMALE:You treat your kids the same? Yeah, i do.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think i do? It's no big deal if she thought i had potential because she'll always think i messed up my life.
SUPMALE:She'll always think you're the best mud pie maker in the whole world.
LEADMALE:She decided that long ago.
LEADMALE:It's not going to change.
LEADMALE:That's the way mothers are.
LEADFEMALE:Not this one.
LEADMALE:I'm not going back down there, so forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I made it through dinner.
OTHERMALE:That was the deal.
SUPMALE:I won't take any more "becky beautiful" garbage.
SUPFEMALE:You have more respect for your forget it.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:You're not mad about what i did at dinner? I thought you were really out of line till i started throwing biscuits.
LEADFEMALE:You threw biscuits at grandma? No, i didn't want to hit d.j. you know how soft his skull is.
LEADMALE:I miss all the good stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, darlene, do you think that i encourage you, you know, to do stuff? Well, i don't know.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? well do you think that i expect more out of becky than i do out of you? I don't know.
SUPMALE:You expect becky things out of becky like good grades.
LEADMALE:I expect good grades out of you, too.
SUPFEMALE:I just never get them.
LEADFEMALE:I think we both know that i'm smarter, just in a different way.
SUPMALE:If you dropped me and becky in the woods, i'd make it home and poor little becky would crawl into a hollow log and die.
LEADFEMALE:That's why i had two daughters i always carry a spare.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i'm sorry i said i hated grandma.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i love her, but sometimes i don't like her.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sometimes she makes it kind of tough.
OTHERMALE:But then there's these other times where you just want to take her face in your hands and twist it till her head pops off.
LEADMALE:It's good i never feel that way about you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it's a real good thing.
SUPMALE:You know, i got this theory grandma was probably a better mom than her mom, and you're definitely a better mom than grandma was.
LEADMALE:That's a good theory.
LEADMALE:By the time i'm a mom, i'll be awesome because i'll have learned from both your mistakes.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Heavy.
LEADMALE:What do you bet grandma's downstairs making becky look at her 400 pictures she took on her trip to arizona? Becky will probably never get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:I ought to head back to the snake pit.
OTHERMALE:Want to come along? will you be throwing any more biscuits? Yeah, if i can get a clear shot.
SUPMALE:Here's the world's largest reptile museum lizardland.
LEADFEMALE:That's a lizard.
SUPFEMALE:Here's a bigger lizard.
OTHERFEMALE:That's the owner of the museum.
SUPMALE:A very nice young man.
SUPMALE:We told him all about you, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:He might be calling you.
SUPFEMALE:His name is fess.
OTHERMALE:Your dad playing stick-'em-up with a lizard.
LEADFEMALE:Not as funny as the cactus, but you know your father.
LEADMALE:You got his sense of humor.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:1 that's egg salad.
SUPFEMALE:You ordered a blt.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I brought you the wrong lunch.
LEADMALE:I'll give you a free piece of pie.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Apple is my favorite.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
SUPFEMALE:Cross your fingers, and we'll see what you get.
LEADMALE:I make a mistake, and he apologizes.
SUPFEMALE:I should introduce him to dan.
OTHERMALE:Maybe it'll rub off.
LEADMALE:Hey, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Hey, crystal.
OTHERMALE:Want some coffee? Only if you got some made.
LEADMALE:Well, this is a coffee shop, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, that would be fine.
LEADMALE:You know, i love the mall after christmas.
LEADMALE:The stores will take back anything.
LEADFEMALE:I just returned an electric wok that i've had in the closet since 1982.
SUPFEMALE:How the hell did you do that? I kept the box.
SUPMALE:And luckily i could exchange it for one of those machines that rips the hair out of your leg.
LEADMALE:They're very effective.
SUPMALE:Although they do tend to make you cry.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:She should cry.
LEADMALE:I bought her that wok.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Eat this.
SUPMALE:What's this for? It's a tip.
SUPFEMALE:But it's, like, 40%.
LEADFEMALE:When a waitress makes a mistake, you shouldn't over tip like this, donald.
LEADFEMALE:Remember that for next time.
LEADMALE:Come on, dad.
LEADFEMALE:I want to see the movie.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on there, babalouie.
LEADFEMALE:I want to check out this here cute waitress.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:When you get a minute? Yeah, you'll be the first to know.
OTHERFEMALE:Got a kiss for me, or do you want a hot poker in the eyeball? Poker, please.
SUPFEMALE:Yecchh! So, what are you boys up to? Oh, just going upstairs to the cineplex.
LEADMALE:You going to see 101 dalmatians? Nah.
SUPFEMALE:He won't go for that unless 95 of them blow up.
OTHERFEMALE:On your way home, pick up some mushroom soup and macaroni for your dad's favorite tuna casserole.
LEADFEMALE:Yecchh.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:It's god-awful, isn't it? And especially the way i make it.
LEADMALE:Another christmas in january with old ed conner.
SUPFEMALE:Same as when i was little.
LEADMALE:Always traveling.
OTHERMALE:That's how he kept ahead of other salesmen who stayed home for the holidays.
LEADFEMALE:If you're going to gripe about your dad, you got to order something.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, deej.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:See you, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Remember--go up and ask for two children's tickets.
SUPFEMALE:Why doesn't dan get along with his father? I've always found ed to be a wonderful man.
SUPMALE:Well, me, too.
OTHERMALE:I get along with him great.
SUPMALE:'course, i'm a people person.
SUPMALE:There's the phone.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, rodbell's coffee shop, home of the quick serve.
LEADMALE:What? I can't hear you, darlene.
LEADMALE:Tell becky to stop screaming.
SUPMALE:Ok, now, what did d.j. do? how could he do that? He's not even home.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:So, now, where did you find it? Just put it in a bag, and i'll bury it when i get there.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Problem? Oh, it's just d.j. he needs some little friends to play with.
SUPMALE:Bring lonnie around this weekend.
OTHERFEMALE:He'd love to play with him.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, lonnie's at his grandma's for the weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then next weekend.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, lonnie is scared of d.j. oh, ok.
OTHERMALE:At least d.j. has a father.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel bad about lonnie growing up without a father.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, crystal.
LEADMALE:Don't get upset.
OTHERFEMALE:Somewhere out there, there is a guy who is perfect for you.
LEADMALE:Excuse me a minute.
LEADMALE:Hey, donald.
LEADMALE:Do you like tuna casserole? Not very much, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you'll eat it anyway.
OTHERMALE:Crystal doesn't know this dinner's a fix up? She thinks she's just dropping off a fondue pot.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what's the guy think? You know, he's a single guy, and we got hot food.
SUPMALE:That's all he needs to know.
LEADMALE:Hey, put more cheese in there.
SUPMALE:The regular cheese or the stinky cheese? Stinky.
OTHERFEMALE:Ecchh! It smells like dad's feet.
LEADMALE:Something sure smells good! Hey, darlene, put another box of macaroni in there.
OTHERMALE:Well, how much should i put? The box says, "serves 10.
LEADMALE:" well, there's eight of us, so two boxes ought to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Eight? My dad's coming.
LEADFEMALE:That's six.
SUPFEMALE:I run into crystal at the mall today.
LEADFEMALE:Seven.
LEADFEMALE:She seemed lonely, so i-you're not playing matchmaker again, are you? Every time you do, it blows up in your face.
SUPMALE:I fixed up your friend pete and his wife.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and they're divorced now.
LEADMALE:Really? He would be perfect for jackie.
SUPFEMALE:It's grandpa! Oh, cool.
SUPFEMALE:Presents! You coming? Plenty of time.
LEADFEMALE:You got to make it tough, right, conner? I want to finish this article.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're reading cosmo? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeeww! For becky.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, grandpa.
SUPFEMALE:For darlene.
LEADMALE:Thanks, grandpa.
LEADFEMALE:For grandpa.
LEADFEMALE:What did you bring me? It's right here.
LEADFEMALE:I got you a set of books.
SUPFEMALE:I'm kidding.
SUPMALE:I'm just kidding.
LEADMALE:It's a death ray.
SUPMALE:Great! what did you bring me? Hey, rosebud! You look younger and more beautiful every time i see you.
LEADMALE:You know, you're a lying sack of skin, ed, but i love you.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you doing? I couldn't be better, rosie.
SUPMALE:So where's that bum you married? He's out there in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:I'm supposed to go to him, right? I think that's the plan.
SUPFEMALE:Dad! danny boy! Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Get you, get you, get you! How's business, dad? Great.
OTHERMALE:I'm having the best year of my life.
OTHERFEMALE:I picked up one of these lines of fancy coffees.
SUPFEMALE:Dutch mocha, amaretto creme ah, here we go.
LEADMALE:Chocolate parfait.
OTHERFEMALE:We got this great advertising campaign-"for the quiet moments of your life.
LEADMALE:" i haven't had a quiet moment in 17 years.
SUPFEMALE:What else you bring me? Just so happens, i did bring you a little something.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't have to.
LEADMALE:What, danny? It's a gift.
LEADMALE:That's what you call it when you give somebody something you don't have to.
LEADMALE:When you have to, it's called alimony.
LEADMALE:Har har har har har.
SUPMALE:Grandpa, you got us videotapes.
LEADMALE:You don't like the movies i picked? We love them.
SUPFEMALE:We don't have a vcr.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:We do now.
LEADMALE:All right, grandpa! A vcr, beck.
SUPMALE:The conner family leaps into the eighties.
LEADMALE:Take it into the living room.
SUPFEMALE:I'll come in a second and help you hook it up.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, grandpa.
LEADMALE:Yeah, now we really love you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen, there's, um there's something i got to talk to you about.
OTHERMALE:That's what the vcrâs for, to soften us up? The vcr was a second prize in a sales contest.
LEADMALE:If i'd won first prize, i'd be in hawaii.
OTHERFEMALE:You wouldn't have to put up with me.
LEADMALE:Geez, dan.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want to talk about? Let's wait till after supper.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? Unload the truck.
SUPFEMALE:Is this how it'll be the whole time he's visiting, you acting like a baby? you hear the crack about alimony? He never pays my mother a dime in alimony.
LEADMALE:It's a joke.
OTHERMALE:Johnny carson does alimony jokes, and you're laying there-"not now, roseanne, johnny's on a roll.
LEADMALE:" he's pulling the same stuff on my kids as he pulled on me.
LEADMALE:He's never around, then he thinks he can buy them off with presents.
OTHERFEMALE:They think he's santa claus.
LEADFEMALE:So they love their grandfather.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:They hate everybody else, dan.
LEADMALE:Give him a break.
OTHERFEMALE:He helped you with your homework, taught you how to ride a bike, and took you to the baseball games.
LEADFEMALE:He never did any of that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so what? He got us a vcr.
LEADFEMALE:Same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i brought the fondue pot.
LEADFEMALE:I hope i'm not too late.
LEADFEMALE:You're right on time.
LEADMALE:I want you to stay for dinner.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't impose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Nonsense.
LEADFEMALE:Are you still wearing that? You look like hell.
LEADMALE:God, she's smooth.
OTHERMALE:Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! you got me! i'm vaporized! Oh, hi, cryssie.
SUPMALE:Hey, ed.
LEADMALE:How are you? Come on, grandpa.
LEADMALE:D.j. , give me just a minute to get my molecules reorganized.
LEADFEMALE:All right? Ok.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go kill dad.
OTHERMALE:Looks like we're getting close here, huh? I'll go wash up.
SUPFEMALE:It's really good to see you again, crystal.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, maybe ed would like it to be just him and the family.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nonsense.
LEADFEMALE:Quit whining.
OTHERFEMALE:Men hate that.
LEADMALE:Go in my bedroom and borrow some earrings and a scarf.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, go with her.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You know what the sad part is? She doesn't suspect a thing.
LEADMALE:There's the groom.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? I'm hungry.
SUPMALE:Well, i didn't invite you for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:When have i ever waited for an invitation? Get the door, darlene, and let him in.
OTHERMALE:Be nice to him.
SUPFEMALE:He's skittish.
LEADMALE:Who's skittish? Just this guy from the mall.
LEADMALE:Nobody you know.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody you'd like.
SUPMALE:How do you know i wouldn't like him? He ain't your type.
LEADMALE:He's shy and really quiet.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, he manages this camera shop, you know? whose type is he? He's crystal's type.
SUPMALE:So back off.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, you wouldn't want to introduce me to some great guy with a job.
OTHERMALE:Crystal looks hot, mom.
SUPFEMALE:We went with the purple scarf and the silver earrings.
SUPFEMALE:I begged you for those earrings.
LEADMALE:What is going on? First you're on my case about not dating and then you doll crystal up so she can snag some great guy with a job.
OTHERFEMALE:He's cute.
SUPFEMALE:He's not your type.
LEADFEMALE:What is my type, roseanne, some unemployed rodeo clown? Uh-oh, bachelorette number two.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up, shut up, shut up.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Go shoot your sister.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I promise the next guy is for you, but this one's for crystal.
LEADMALE:Pull up a chair and set yourself a place, but hands off the camera guy.
SUPMALE:Donald i don't believe you've met my sister jackie.
LEADMALE:It's a pleasure to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:You went to lanford high? Yes, donald.
OTHERMALE:Have they always been the fighting tigers? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Let me go find out.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne that's 12 questions in a row, in case you're counting.
SUPMALE:Oh, he's just nervous.
LEADFEMALE:That's how he tries to make conversation.
SUPFEMALE:Get him off my back.
SUPMALE:You begged me to fix you up with him.
LEADMALE:That was before i found out he was the question man-what kind of car do you drive? what's your favorite soup? did you do it in here? I didn't design this kitchen, donald.
LEADMALE:Jackie, were you a cheerleader? No, donald.
LEADFEMALE:Did you try out and not make it? You know, crystal was on the pompom squad.
LEADMALE:Really? Oh, dear.
LEADMALE:Are they your own pompons or does the school provide them? They gave them to me.
OTHERMALE:You know, jackie was on the field hockey team.
SUPMALE:No kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Do you use a ball or a puck? You know what's great after a big dinner is a nice drive.
LEADMALE:Jackie, take donald on a nice little drive.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne i know.
OTHERMALE:You want to borrow my isadora duncan scarf.
LEADMALE:I've got it right here in the bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Can i buy this at a store? Hey, i promised the kids i'd watch movie tapes with them.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'll go with you.
SUPFEMALE:You work in a camera shop.
SUPMALE:Do you send your film to a lab? what kind of a lab? a big lab? I want that guy out of here.
LEADMALE:Tell him to leave.
SUPFEMALE:No, i can't.
LEADFEMALE:I'll leave.
LEADFEMALE:Take him with you.
SUPMALE:Not on your life.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to believe this! I come in here, and what do i see on this very spot? Crystal and ed kissing.
OTHERFEMALE:Making out? Like trying to climb each other.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god! I figure i can find out what's going on if you and the quizmaster blow.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, but i want details later.
OTHERMALE:I'll call you for sure.
SUPMALE:What if he tries something? Oh, jackie, he's annoying.
LEADMALE:He's not desperate.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with d.j. ? Oh, his death ray broke.
SUPMALE:How did that happen? Oh, that's not important.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, donald, i'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:So where do you want to go? who's driving? is it far? Oh, you'll find out when you get there.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for coming.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, bye.
SUPMALE:Adult time.
LEADMALE:Everybody upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
SUPFEMALE:Run along.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, that's not fair.
SUPMALE:We're watching a videotape.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:There's logic for you.
SUPMALE:I can't wait till i have kids.
OTHERFEMALE:They'll have to do everything i say.
SUPMALE:Funny how donald and jackie hit it right off.
SUPMALE:I thought donald was more, say, crystal's type, but what do i know? Absolutely nothing, my pet.
SUPFEMALE:So, ed crystal what's new? Danny, i wanted to tell you-before you say anything, i was way out of line before.
SUPFEMALE:Your intentions are good.
LEADFEMALE:I was a complete jerk.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe i should leave you alone.
LEADFEMALE:This is a family moment.
SUPMALE:Please stay.
LEADMALE:I want you to.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad-listen, danny-this is really tough for me.
LEADMALE:Let me get the whole thing out.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever happened between you and mom and between you and me is history.
SUPMALE:Let's start over.
LEADMALE:That's great, son.
SUPFEMALE:I can't tell you how long i wanted to hear those words, and you're right.
SUPMALE:We've got to start over because, uh, ahem starting over is good.
LEADFEMALE:It's a good thing.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, i've been starting over myself, because, uh crystal and i have been seeing each other.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean, "seeing"? Well, since last thanksgiving, uh we started getting together whenever i had a break in my schedule.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry i didn't tell you two, but we didn't know how you'd take it.
LEADMALE:Well, are you happy? Yes, i am.
OTHERFEMALE:Well then i'm happy for you.
LEADMALE:As to how dan's going to take it, well take it, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You're more than 20 years older than she is.
SUPMALE:I've done the math.
LEADMALE:You knew her as a kid.
SUPMALE:She's grown.
SUPMALE:With a kid.
SUPFEMALE:We've met.
LEADMALE:So what do you want? I wanted you to know.
SUPFEMALE:I felt idiotic coming around here without stopping by.
LEADFEMALE:We felt so sneaky.
SUPMALE:Now we know.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Dan i'm going with it, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You're not upset? Well, to be honest, i feel a little bad for donald.
LEADFEMALE:Donald the question man? Oh, i'm glad you're good with this, because we're getting married.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going? Somewhere else.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Get inside, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going.
SUPMALE:It's freezing out here.
LEADMALE:We want your blessing, dan.
LEADMALE:You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
SUPMALE:You're expecting a husband, companion, a father for lonnie.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:He won't be there for you.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i love him.
LEADFEMALE:Why? He's kind and he's generous and he's funny.
SUPFEMALE:He reminds me a lot of you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:You figured out the exact wrong thing to say.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's true, you know.
LEADFEMALE:You just don't give the man any credit.
OTHERMALE:I've known him all my life.
LEADFEMALE:I know exactly what's going to happen.
SUPFEMALE:A year from now you'll be lonelier than ever, and you'll be married.
LEADFEMALE:You won't even have the clowns roseanne sets you up with.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take that chance.
LEADFEMALE:Then i'm done talking.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, it can't be like this.
SUPMALE:Whether you like it or not, i'm marrying your father, and, well, i'll kind of be like your mother.
LEADFEMALE:I want your blessing.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, crystal.
SUPMALE:Well, then, dan conner, you don't get your coat back.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:More coffee? Whole pot.
SUPMALE:Pour it on me.
OTHERFEMALE:Anything you say, dearest.
LEADFEMALE:You know, a lesser man would have come back in for his coat.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to see my father.
OTHERMALE:We got to figure out how to deal with this.
LEADFEMALE:Deal with what? We buy a gift and show up at the wedding.
LEADMALE:I think i'll buy her an electric wok.
LEADMALE:I'm not going to the wedding.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADMALE:You're the best man and i'm the matron of honor.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll walk down that aisle just like old times, only this time we need a wider aisle.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? who decided all this? My best friend crystal asked me to help plan her wedding, and i said yes.
LEADMALE:What are you, crazy? You know this thing's a mistake.
SUPMALE:No, i don't, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I see two people who obviously love each other.
LEADMALE:They're just looking for some support from their family and friends.
SUPFEMALE:You're not doing this, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're really sexy when you attempt to be assertive.
SUPFEMALE:I'm serious.
LEADMALE:You're not going, neither am i, and that's an end to it.
OTHERMALE:No, it ain't.
LEADFEMALE:Do you like the pie? It's apple, my favorite.
LEADMALE:What's your favorite pie? your coffee hot enough? I hate cold coffee.
OTHERFEMALE:I come here every day.
LEADFEMALE:I work here.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you do? I'll bet you're good at it.
LEADFEMALE:I sell cameras right here in the mall.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that must have hurt.
SUPMALE:You need an aspirin? anybody got an aspirin? You want regular or buffered?
OTHERMALE:
LEADMALE: i ordered chicken, not salmon.
LEADFEMALE:Who eats salmon at a wedding anyway? I'll tell you who-not us, that's who.
OTHERMALE:Now i got 60 people coming.
SUPFEMALE:65.
SUPMALE:My cousin trudy and her family can come after all.
LEADMALE:Ok, so it's chicken for 65 people.
LEADFEMALE:It's no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:You just add another bucket.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, thank you for handling these wedding preparations.
LEADFEMALE:I told you a thousand times, crystal, i'm happy to do it.
LEADMALE:Where were we? what is going on? Grandpa wanted to race us from the car.
SUPFEMALE:He bet us each a buck he could win.
LEADMALE:Are we just going to let him lie there? oh, my god! ed! Are you ok? It's nothing a plastic hip won't fix.
SUPFEMALE:You should save some of that energy for your honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:That's some good advice.
LEADFEMALE:Geez check out the cool stuff grandpa got us.
LEADFEMALE:I got a bracelet.
LEADMALE:And look at this.
SUPMALE:That's a chemistry set.
LEADMALE:Every boy should have one.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't have done that.
LEADMALE:We could just turn on the gas and blow ourselves up.
SUPMALE:It's perfectly harmless.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see.
LEADFEMALE:Lonnie, why don't you show them what i got you.
SUPFEMALE:A walkman.
SUPMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:You've been wanting one for the longest time.
SUPFEMALE:And now i have one.
LEADMALE:He wouldn't take one of those little tv's.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, lonnie.
LEADMALE:You got to get into this.
SUPMALE:You got a guy here trying to buy your affections.
SUPMALE:Let him.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't they just the sweetest little things? I admit i'm kind of a softie when it comes to grand-kids, but lonnie's going to be my son.
LEADFEMALE:And you got to be tough with your boys.
LEADFEMALE:Right, lonnie-roo? so, did you pick up your bridesmaids' gowns? Yeah.
SUPMALE:We got them yesterday.
LEADMALE:We're really honored you asked us, but we'd understand if you'd rather honor your adult friends.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:Why would you think such a thing? Because those gowns are so dorky, they make us want to retch.
LEADMALE:They're very nice.
LEADFEMALE:They're just not us.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:They're more for people who get an allowance.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, beck, let's go try those on.
LEADMALE:Women, huh? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh-ho.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet you got a lot of questions about women.
LEADFEMALE:I guess.
OTHERMALE:Could we go now, mom? Roseanne and i aren't done with the seating plan.
LEADFEMALE:That's fine, crystal.
OTHERMALE:I can finish it.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know half the people.
SUPFEMALE:That'll make it go faster.
SUPMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Take the boy home, crissy.
LEADMALE:You can do that later.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you both think so.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, lonnie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in there pitching for you.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:I'll see you both later.
LEADMALE:Lonnie and i are going to have a wonderful relationship when we get over this hurdle.
LEADFEMALE:The one where he thinks you're the beast from hell? That's the one.
LEADMALE:He'll come around.
LEADMALE:He and crissy have been alone for a long time.
SUPFEMALE:Now there's this new guy.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to try harder.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think that's possible.
OTHERMALE:You want some coffee? No thanks.
SUPMALE:I've got to pick up my tux.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, danny boy.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:He's not talking to me either.
LEADFEMALE:Why does he hate me so much? I wasn't such a bad father.
LEADFEMALE:I kept his belly full-way full.
OTHERMALE:Between him and lonnie, i got two boys who won't give me the time of day.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you'd do better with daughters.
LEADMALE:I got a couple you can have for a nice price.
LEADMALE:How much you asking? Oh, cool! I thought i had to pay you.
SUPMALE:Your car's out in the front.
LEADMALE:I'll just walk around.
LEADFEMALE:It's cold out there.
OTHERMALE:Even colder in there.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, starshine.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think you should, like, lighten up, dan? You betrayed me, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Don't you think that's a tad harsh? I mean, i'm ordering cocktail weenies for 60.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not turning you over to the nazis.
LEADMALE:You know i'm opposed to this wedding.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:You've made that quite clear.
LEADMALE:You're ordering all this stuff like what i say means nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:The wedding's going to go no matter who plans it.
LEADFEMALE:And crystal's my best friend.
SUPMALE:I'm your husband.
SUPFEMALE:I outrank her.
LEADFEMALE:You're supposed to back me up.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember-richer, poorer, sickness, health, death, part? I never took any vow to back you up when you're acting stupid.
LEADMALE:This wedding is a joke, and you know it.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I do not know that.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal's happy, and your dad's happy.
OTHERMALE:That's what wedding's are about.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Have a good time.
LEADMALE:You've got to go.
LEADFEMALE:You're the best man.
SUPMALE:Your whole family's going to be there.
LEADFEMALE:Your aunt mildred's going to dance with the band, and uncle pete's going to pull a quarter out of his nose like he always does.
SUPMALE:You're not leaving me alone with those people.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:You're on your own.
LEADMALE:There's going to be cake.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, that's from me.
LEADFEMALE:You slut.
LEADMALE:I could never wear this.
OTHERFEMALE:What would ed think? There won't be enough blood left in his brain to think anything.
LEADFEMALE:He's a pig.
LEADFEMALE:All men are pigs.
LEADMALE:Jackie, you're just saying that because you don't have a date for the wedding, and everyone else does.
LEADMALE:What's your point, crystal? Simply that you don't have to be so bitter.
SUPMALE:I'm not bitter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Of course not.
SUPFEMALE:If you excuse me, i have to use the ladies' room.
SUPMALE:That's like the eighth time, crystal.
SUPFEMALE:We ought to move this shindig into the john.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I am not bitter.
LEADFEMALE:Give it a rest, jackie.
LEADMALE:I'm looking forward to spending time with becky and darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Becky and darlene have dates.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene? darlene has a date? Now, i'm bitter.
OTHERMALE:Anne marie! you made it! Of course.
SUPMALE:Your parties were legends when we were kids.
LEADFEMALE:I got more boring friends now.
LEADFEMALE:Don't keep your hopes up.
LEADFEMALE:Anne marie! hey, crystal! congratulations! I'm so glad roseanne ran in to you.
LEADMALE:How long's it been? Since high school.
LEADMALE:What you been up to? Well, after graduation, there was this party at sarah foster's house where i met rusty, who became my first husband.
LEADFEMALE:But not until july of that year.
LEADFEMALE:By august the spark had flickered.
LEADFEMALE:So we split up, and i married travis.
LEADMALE:He was a whole other can of worms.
LEADMALE:He was an arc welder.
OTHERFEMALE:And when we divorced, he cut the trailer in half.
OTHERFEMALE:But you know, we remain friends do something.
SUPMALE:Oh, i know what let's do.
LEADFEMALE:Let's play "who knows crystal best.
LEADFEMALE:" ok, i'll say the first question.
SUPFEMALE:Umwhat was crystal's nickname in high school.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, too easy.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:That was it.
SUPFEMALE:That's not true.
LEADMALE:I got one.
SUPFEMALE:I know! what was playing on gilbert coswell's car radio the night crystal did it for the first time? Jackie! jackie! that was told to you in the strictest of confidence! hey! you got a man in your life, and i don't, so throw me a bone! Ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Any guesses? you don't mean that rusty wasn't her first? Yes, he was.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, he was! This game isn't fun anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, was it stairway to heaven? No.
OTHERMALE:Crystal blue persuasion? how about my sweet lord? Well, that wasn't coming from the car radio.
LEADFEMALE:I know what it was! roseanne, don't you dare! Oh, crystal.
SUPFEMALE:My baby does the hanky panky my baby does the hanky panky my baby does the hanky panky ok.
SUPFEMALE:Ok! Thank you for sharing my secrets with the whole wide world, roseanne and jackie blabbermouth.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'll be back.
OTHERMALE:We're just killing time till the stripper gets here, right? Oh, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:We were just kidding around.
SUPFEMALE:We're sorry.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:We're sorry, ok? Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go back in there.
LEADFEMALE:Just a moment.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter, crystal? I'm not in the mood for a party now.
LEADFEMALE:Something wrong? I'd rather not say.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, crystal.
LEADMALE:You can trust us.
SUPFEMALE:With the big stuff.
OTHERMALE:I suppose i have to tell someone.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, jackie i'm pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure you're not just late? I don't think so.
SUPMALE:I got the signs.
SUPFEMALE:I've been nauseous and eating like crazy.
LEADFEMALE:And my doctor said i'm pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so, uh, are we happy or sad? Well, happy.
LEADMALE:I think it's great! We're happy for you, crystal.
LEADMALE:Geez, oh, wow.
LEADFEMALE:Does ed know? Of course.
SUPFEMALE:Do you want a boy or a girl? I've dreamed of having a girl.
LEADFEMALE:What if it's a boy? Simple operation.
LEADMALE:Oh, roseanne.
SUPMALE:I can't find my bowling ball.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know where it is? Yes, it's in the bedroom closet, where it always is.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, roseanne, i'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:You two are hardly talking, and it's my fault.
LEADMALE:That's pretty much how i see it, too.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe if i tell him about the baby, he won't be so upset about the wedding.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Well, well, maybe it'll help.
LEADMALE:No, don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, listen.
OTHERMALE:Your father and i, we've been-we were going to tell-uh she's pregnant.
LEADMALE:I told you not to tell him.
OTHERMALE:Door's open.
OTHERMALE:Danny boy.
OTHERMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:Just throwing myself a little bachelor party here.
LEADMALE:Usually the best man makes the party, but you do with what you got.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? what's it look like? I'm nursing this beer, and i'm watching a dirty movie through all those little squiggly lines.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just pay the 4 bucks? They'll unscramble it.
OTHERMALE:Then they'll know i'm in here watching a dirty movie.
LEADFEMALE:Grab a beer.
SUPFEMALE:You'll need it.
LEADFEMALE:In two minutes, you'll have a hell of a headache.
LEADFEMALE:So, to what do i owe this great honor? Dad, i know crystal's pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Heh heh.
LEADMALE:She wasn't supposed to tell anybody till after the wedding.
SUPFEMALE:Are you doing this because you have to get married? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's gross.
OTHERMALE:Danny, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I have to get married.
OTHERMALE:Because crystal's the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
OTHERMALE:And what about the baby? He's fine with this.
LEADMALE:You're making a mistake, dad.
LEADFEMALE:What am i supposed to do, cancel this wedding? let crystal raise a kid alone? No.
LEADMALE:What are you saying? Maybe you should wait.
SUPFEMALE:Wait for what? You got no business raising a kid.
OTHERMALE:Why? You know damn well why.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to watch it again.
LEADMALE:You're gonna be on the road.
LEADMALE:He'll grow up just like i did.
SUPMALE:Without a father.
LEADMALE:Crystal will suffer like mom did.
LEADFEMALE:It's not about crystal and our baby.
SUPMALE:It's about you and me.
LEADMALE:How i screwed up your life.
LEADFEMALE:Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:You got a nice family, you own a business.
LEADFEMALE:How can you forgive me? Name one thing you did for me that took time instead of money.
LEADMALE:Fine, i am a rotten father! i am a rotten father! ok? Dan, i'm tired of this! Ok, i made mistakes, with you and with your mother, but i got a second chance.
LEADFEMALE:I thought that you would want to help.
SUPFEMALE:But you don't.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal and i will do it by ourselves.
OTHERMALE:And i'm not going to apologize to you anymore, because you'll never let me off the hook.
SUPMALE:Now, if you don't mind you're bringing my party down.
LEADFEMALE:Ready.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i know.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, get on that table.
OTHERMALE:I'll get up here.
LEADMALE:Crystal, just walk under here and stick your arms through.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, i just want you to know how grateful i am for all your help.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, i appreciate your help, too, but not as much.
SUPFEMALE:You're welcome, crystal.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm sorry, jackie.
OTHERMALE:It's just i'm so nervous.
SUPMALE:So, roseanne, did you speak to dan this morning? No.
LEADMALE:I was sleeping when he left.
LEADMALE:Just won't be the same without him.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal, you look beautiful.
SUPMALE:You look absolutely radiant.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:What? I have to use the potty.
SUPFEMALE:Can't believe we have to wear this crud.
LEADMALE:It's only a few hours.
LEADFEMALE:You'll live.
LEADMALE:But we can't duck the photographer the whole time.
LEADMALE:There's a photographer? Come on, d.j. this is not a race.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice tux.
LEADFEMALE:Ready? Nice tux.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i've been getting a lot of compliments on it lately.
LEADMALE:I feel so bloated.
LEADMALE:Who could have foreseen, decades ago, when a younger ed met a 12-year-old crystal, that years later, they would be standing here, ready to enter into holy matrimony.
LEADMALE:You didn't foresee that, right? Good.
OTHERMALE:Then let's proceed.
LEADMALE:What is marriage? You probably think you're better than me 'cause you're married.
OTHERMALE:Well, you're not.
LEADMALE:I could be married if i wanted to be.
OTHERMALE:There's far more to life than being married.
LEADFEMALE:Marriage is one more way for men to enslave women.
LEADFEMALE:So get out of the cave, crystal.
LEADMALE:This is the 20th--what? Oh, ok.
SUPMALE:You're going to throw the bouquet now! Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Wait up.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations, daddy and mommy.
LEADMALE:I hope you're as happy together as rosey and me.
SUPMALE:Now say something nice.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm real happy about my little brother.
SUPMALE:He can use any of my toys, except for my lincoln logs and jerry mahoney dummy.
SUPFEMALE:But really, um i'll be there for you, dad.
LEADFEMALE:I'll always be there for you.
LEADFEMALE:Cake! 2, 3.
LEADMALE:Congratulations, crystal and grandpa.
LEADFEMALE:And crystal.
OTHERFEMALE:We love you guys.
SUPFEMALE:Well, first i'd like to say congratulations, uh, you guys.
LEADMALE:And, uh, crystal, you're part of our family now.
LEADMALE:You're like my mother-in-law, so you got to call before you come over so i can clean up.
LEADMALE:Don't come over that often.
SUPMALE:But seriously, though, i'm really happy for you guys, and, you know, i'm happy for you.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADMALE:Ok, cut.
OTHERFEMALE:That's good, that's good.
SUPMALE:I don't have anything else to say.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, there, i said it.
LEADMALE:Anyways, congratulations, crystal and fred.
SUPFEMALE:What? No, his name's fred.
LEADMALE:It's fred.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure? Anyways, congratulations, crystal and ed.
OTHERFEMALE:Embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal, this is dedicated to you.
LEADMALE:Here it comes.
LEADMALE:My baby does the hanky-panky my baby does the hanky-panky my baby does the hanky-panky are we going to let her lie there?
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Becky, is that the shirt you wore to school today? Yes.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Would you like another beer, dearest? Thank you, my pet.
SUPMALE:Can i have a beer? No.
SUPMALE:So, becky, is something wrong with your food? you mean you hid some food under all this slop? Hey! I stuck that in the microwave, pressed power, pressed time, pressed start, and this is the thanks i get.
SUPFEMALE:God, nobody could eat this crud.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't finish your crud, you won't get any crap for dessert.
LEADMALE:Hey, whoa.
LEADMALE:It's your turn to clear.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it always my turn to clear? is there something you'd like to share with us? like what? Like why you've been acting like a snot lately.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you kiss my butt? Well, haul it on over here, jumbo.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey! hey, hey! No butt-kissing at the dinner table.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just sick of mom treating me like a baby.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:What were you doing in my room today? Cleaning.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that what you hired me for? I hate that room.
SUPMALE:It's a baby room.
LEADMALE:Don't you hate it, darlene? who cares? When i turn 18, i'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Why can't you back me up for once? Well, i don't like you, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, if you don't like your room, change it.
SUPMALE:We got a garage full of paint out there.
SUPFEMALE:Your dad will help you.
LEADFEMALE:She means your real dad.
SUPFEMALE:You can get started tomorrow, ok? Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Whatever.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Just seeing your smiling face is thanks enough.
OTHERFEMALE:I asked that guy out like you told me to.
SUPFEMALE:We got a date for tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Way to go.
LEADFEMALE:Only now i have to pay.
SUPMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:The guy pays.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but i asked him out.
LEADMALE:So? The rule is, the guy still pays.
LEADFEMALE:Who made up that rule? Some cheap hungry woman.
LEADMALE:What do i look like, becky, your slave? So i was late.
SUPMALE:Two hours! and it's your room! You think i'll spend my day off painting it by myself? so what are you going to wear? You ought to wear that burgundy pullover.
SUPFEMALE:This marriage-family thing's been a lot of fun, but i got to go.
SUPFEMALE:Damn.
OTHERFEMALE:I lose more husbands that way.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't start with me, mother, ok? I've had it.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Cover me.
SUPFEMALE:God, it's his problem he's having this stupid hemorrhage.
SUPFEMALE:I was going to get something eat, then go paint my stupid room.
LEADMALE:No, stay down here and fill our lives with joy and mirth.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you ought to wear on that date your red blouse with your black skirt.
LEADMALE:That skirt is so short.
OTHERFEMALE:But you have great legs.
SUPMALE:Wear your hair down, too, 'cause it'll hide your neck.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with my neck? Make sure you order dessert.
OTHERFEMALE:I was reading in cosmo where it says a healthy appetite is considered to be sexy nowadays.
OTHERMALE:I was so far ahead of my time.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom! what? My head's stuck in the drawer! Not again.
LEADMALE:God, doesn't she drive you crazy? Well, she wants me to be happy, and she cares about me, and yeah, she drives me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm sick of it.
SUPMALE:She hates my friends, the clothes i wear, the guys i date.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:At least you get a break.
OTHERFEMALE:You come here, do your laundry, then go home.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you'll survive, beck.
LEADFEMALE:She's been doing the same thing to me for 20 years, and i'm basically a happy person.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not saying i don't wake up screaming every now and again.
LEADMALE:Now, don't do that again.
SUPMALE:Go wash that salad oil off your head.
SUPFEMALE:How does he get his head stuck in a drawer? He's gifted, jackie.
LEADMALE:Look, becky, it's your old menudo album.
LEADMALE:That's not mine.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it is.
OTHERFEMALE:I never liked menudo.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't! Like i was the one who drew the heart around fernando's head.
SUPMALE:Heavy menudo denial, beck.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, just toss it, ok? so what color is this room going to be? Let's paint big, black bars on the walls.
LEADMALE:It feels like a jail cell, it might as well look like one.
SUPMALE:Come on, becky.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Then why do this? You don't have to! One minute you want to paint the room, then you don't care.
LEADFEMALE:What is going on with you, becky? do you remember mark? from down the street? No, that guy i went out with.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, the stupid one? He's not stupid, he's gorgeous.
OTHERMALE:You just wish you could meet a guy like that.
SUPMALE:If i wait a couple years, he'll be in my grade.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm going out with him tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you remember what mom and dad said? They don't want me to see him.
LEADMALE:So what? I'm 16! I don't have to listen to her.
SUPFEMALE:If they find out, they'll ground you forever.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they're not going to find out 'cause officially i'll be at the basketball game with you.
SUPMALE:Why should i lie for you? 'cause you're good at it.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Come on, darlene.
LEADMALE:Sisters do this for each other.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this guy's so important to you.
LEADMALE:Please? I'll owe you.
LEADMALE:I'll owe you big.
LEADMALE:I guess.
LEADMALE:Thank you so much.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, becky.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you? what are you doing out there? Uh, i dropped my key.
OTHERMALE:Well, come inside.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, darlene.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Great game.
OTHERMALE:They beat us by, like, 20 points, but we went and tipped their bus over and set it on fire.
SUPMALE:Where's becky? She went to get pizza with her friends after the game.
LEADFEMALE:She'll be home in an hour or so.
LEADMALE:Hey, genius, how long were you at the pizza place before you remembered i had all your money? Uh, not long.
SUPMALE:How was the game, beck? It was ok.
LEADFEMALE:Who won? I-i just told you.
LEADMALE:I just want to hear it from her.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't know.
OTHERFEMALE:She was in the bathroom the whole time, bleaching her upper lip.
SUPFEMALE:So, becky, who'd you come home with? i hitched a ride with a serial killer, ok? who'd you come home with? what's the difference? We want to know.
LEADMALE:God, you're beginning to sound like mom.
LEADFEMALE:If i found that really insulting, would it bother you? Come on, becky.
LEADFEMALE:We asked you a question.
LEADMALE:Where were you? Pizza.
LEADMALE:Quiet.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not talking to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well? want to know? Fine.

LEADFEMALE:I have nothing more to say to you.
SUPMALE:I'll be in the other room.
LEADFEMALE:There is no other room, becky.
OTHERMALE:Then i'll be in the bathroom.
SUPFEMALE:Becky! She's all yours.
LEADMALE:She can't stay here.
SUPMALE:You should have thought about that before you opened your big mouth.
LEADFEMALE:But i always open my big mouth.
LEADMALE:This never happened.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, becky.
LEADFEMALE:You can't be serious! Congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:It's a girl! Look at all this stuff.
LEADMALE:I thought our kids were supposed to be deprived.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we tried.
OTHERMALE:Where were you? Getting a drink.
LEADFEMALE:God! Here.
OTHERFEMALE:Take this trash out.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No? Yeah, no.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, this is my room, and this is the way i want it now! Wrong.
LEADFEMALE:This is my room, 'cause it's in my house on my lot.
LEADFEMALE:Those are my chairs, those are my desks, that's my hello kitty, my e-z bake oven, so you take my trash downstairs to my garbage cans and throw it out now! Jeez right attitude, wrong daughter.

SUPMALE:If we wait a couple more days, she'll figure it out, trust me.
SUPMALE:I've lived with jackie.

OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what are you doing? Becky's laundry.
SUPFEMALE:How are things going over there? Good.
SUPMALE:You and becky getting along? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm enjoying having her there.
LEADFEMALE:We gave each other a facial and went down to the mall to scam guys.
LEADFEMALE:Last night, we made prank phone calls.
SUPMALE:Crystal's still wondering how nancy reagan got her number.
LEADFEMALE:Is she going to school? is she doing her homework? is she getting in on time? She's fine, dan.
LEADMALE:She's really been a big help, too.
SUPMALE:She's been making her bed, doing the dishes.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, that is just great, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, roseanne, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Not that big of help, nothing that a maid couldn't do.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm glad she's happy.
SUPMALE:Then she'll never come home.
SUPMALE:If i kicked her out, she might not come back here! You're encouraging her to stay.
SUPFEMALE:I am not.
LEADMALE:Then how come she's acting so perfect? Because i'm not her mother.
LEADMALE:No, you're making it like some damn slumber party.
LEADMALE:Roseanne i want her home.
LEADMALE:Well, come get her.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Then quit yelling at me! no! i'm leaving! Steal my daughter, then leave me her laundry, like i'm really going to do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Take her side.
LEADMALE:Jacks, this stuff in the refrigerator, is it lettuce or pumpernickel? Throw it out.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? I won't wait up.
LEADMALE:What are you going to do? Just hang out, i guess.
LEADMALE:No mark tonight? I just wanted to be able to see him.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to see him every night.
LEADMALE:It'll be lonely around here.

SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right, all right.

OTHERMALE:How are things back here? Well, she's grounded for two weeks, we upped the curfew a half hour, her allowance stays the same.
LEADMALE:What about mark? Absolutely not.
SUPFEMALE:We would not budge on that.
SUPFEMALE:We forbade her to ever see him again, so you should wear your blue dress to the wedding.

LEADFEMALE:You look up at the ceiling and chew about 5 minutes every day, and it will fix up that scary deal you got in the back of your neck.
OTHERFEMALE:There's this other one twist your head from side to side.
LEADMALE:It made me nauseous, but it's worth it for you.
LEADMALE:There is nothing wrong with my neck!
LEADMALE:Junk.
SUPMALE:Junk.
SUPMALE:Something from a charity.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, cool.

LEADFEMALE:What? Letter from your school.

SUPFEMALE:I got bigger problems.
LEADFEMALE:What's happening? Career day at school.
LEADMALE:They want dad to speak.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, bummer, darlene.
LEADMALE:He's too cool to do it.
LEADMALE:That's me, ice-d.
LEADMALE:Too cool for school.
SUPMALE:You know what makes me mad about this? how come it's automatically made out to you and not me? Honey, i am the professional in the family.
OTHERMALE:Oh, right.
OTHERMALE:I forgot about your master's in drywalling.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the real reason is just 'cause you're a man.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god, she's going feminist on me.
OTHERMALE:Like i'm not good enough for their little junior high school career day? like some housewife doesn't have anything important to say? It's an outrage, mom.
SUPMALE:I say go show them how tough your job really is.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe i will.
LEADMALE:Thank you, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe next time, you'll keep your grubby little paws off my stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you're not going to let some blond bimbette tell you what to do.
LEADMALE:What's your problem? are you embarrassed of your mother? Don't get offended, mom.
OTHERMALE:I'm just as embarrassed of dad.
LEADMALE:Aw, you're just saying that.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. what's, uh, in the bag? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Thanks for bringing him home.
OTHERMALE:I suppose you want a free dinner now.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
SUPMALE:Uh, roseanne, can i alk-tay with ou-yay in ivate-pray? O-kay-do-kay.
LEADMALE:Duh.
OTHERMALE:I don't understand what they're talking about, do you? so what's up? This is in the strictest of confidence.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. has a little problem.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Where you been, jackie? No.
OTHERMALE:I mean there's some bully at school threatening to beat him up unless he brings him a twinkie every day.
SUPMALE:Are you sure? Yes.
LEADMALE:He made me buy a whole box.
LEADFEMALE:That's what's in that bag.
LEADMALE:Remember, this is just between you and me.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:D.j. ! Don't, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I promised him i wasn't going to tell anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you lied.
LEADMALE:Yeah? what's this about your having some problem at school with some bully? Deej, i'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:She forced it out of me.
SUPMALE:Wuss.
LEADMALE:Deej, what's going on? It's ok.
SUPFEMALE:If i give kevin morgan two twinkies every day, he won't beat me up.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You can't go through life giving in to bullies.
LEADMALE:But i want to live! I'm going to call the school.
SUPMALE:You can't do that.
LEADMALE:Everyone will think he's a squealer.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Then he'll really get the cream cheese kicked out of him.
OTHERMALE:Then i'll call this kid's parents.
SUPMALE:Don't do that! he's going to beat me up! What am i supposed to do? I'll have to teach him to fight.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, dan.
OTHERMALE:D.j. 's just a little, tiny boy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, size isn't really the issue here, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Uh, back when i was on the force here we go.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying, if you know what you're doing, anybody can take out anybody.
SUPMALE:I could put dan on the floor if i wanted to.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Then you could sprout little pink wings and fly away.
LEADFEMALE:What, you don't think i can? Dan, i was a cop.
LEADMALE:Take your best shot, officer.
LEADFEMALE:Yaah! aah! ow, ow! She pulled a hair out.
LEADFEMALE:See? I'll go teach the kid how to take care of himself.
LEADMALE:You know if d.j. tries to fight, he'll just get hurt.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll make it clear that fighting isn't the answer unless you're sure you can win.
LEADFEMALE:Meantime, i'll just keep him stocked up in twinkies.
SUPFEMALE:I guess i'll get this place cleaned up for you.
SUPFEMALE:I'll start by tossing this letter from the school.
LEADFEMALE:Might as well, i guess.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, all right, mom.
SUPMALE:What's the matter? darlene having problems at school? Not yet.
LEADMALE:All right, everybody, listen up! Today we are very lucky to have as our guest speaker a woman who chose to make home economics her life.
LEADMALE:I want you all to welcome mrs.
SUPMALE:Roseanne conner.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Kill me.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner has been a wife and a mother for 17 years, and she's come to us today to present a sort of common-sense approach to home economics.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Well um, ok.
SUPMALE:Well, ok.
LEADMALE:You know how a lot of people don't think that being a housewife is important, but, ok, a lot of people depend on you, and you got to be really smart and dedicated.
LEADMALE:Well, it's kind of like being a doctor, only, you know, um, the hours are longer and you don't get any pay and, um it's way bloodier, so it's probably not like being a doctor at all.
LEADMALE:Well, anyway, any questions or yes, darlene.
SUPMALE:May i be expelled? No, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:You got a question? what did you really want to do with your life? Well, i tried, you know, lounging on the beaches of europe, but somehow that just left me empty.
LEADFEMALE:Believe this or not, i really wanted to have a family.
LEADMALE:Maybe not the one i got, but you know.
SUPFEMALE:What's your favorite soap opera? Well i don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Is that what you think, that you just watch soap operas and all that? You know, raising a family, well, it's a career.
LEADFEMALE:Ok? It's kind of like managing a factory.
SUPFEMALE:Now she manages a factory.
LEADMALE:This will be way better than the doctor thing, trust me.
LEADFEMALE:Way better.
LEADMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Like, i think of my kids like they're the product, right? And if i can get them out there on the market without them getting returned defective then i done my job.
LEADMALE:But what could you teach us that we couldn't learn here? well what are you learning here? Oh, well, yesterday we baked a quiche lorraine.
OTHERMALE:No, really? Yes.
LEADMALE:We think it's very important to learn how to follow a recipe.
LEADFEMALE:And we've learned how to make our own clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how very little house on the prairie.
LEADMALE:I don't know anything about that kind of home economics.
SUPFEMALE:What i know about is, like, cleaning and shopping and cooking for a family of five on a really tight budget and still having money left over to buy that all-important aspirin.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't even know if i could teach it in class here.
LEADMALE:I think we ought to go on a field trip.
LEADFEMALE:I think that's a great idea, so why don't you get permission from your parents to spend an afternoon with mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner? Oh, mom! Oh, no, that's ok, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You can go.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't this class have some boys? They think shopping's a girl thing.
LEADMALE:Get used to that.
LEADFEMALE:Can we get this over with? Come on now, darlene, this can be fun.
LEADMALE:Here, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:You can ride in the seat.
SUPFEMALE:Aw.
SUPMALE:Aw.
SUPMALE:Aw.
LEADFEMALE:It's just the buy-n-bag.
LEADMALE:We've been here a million times.
LEADMALE:It's not just the buy-n-bag, darlene.
SUPMALE:A supermarket is the very blood and guts of home economics, and besides, it's what makes our country great.
OTHERFEMALE:Where else in the world are you going to find frozen pizzas, microwave pizzas, french bread pizzas, thick crust pizzas, pizza puffs, pizza rolls, pizza squares, pizza tarts? did i tell you you should never shop when you're really hungry? All right, girls.
LEADFEMALE:The mission is meat.
OTHERFEMALE:You're making dinner for five people, and you're on a really tight budget.
LEADMALE:Uh, what's your name? Meryl.
SUPFEMALE:Step up to the meat counter and pick a meat.
SUPFEMALE:Any meat.
SUPMALE:All right, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:There's a lot of meat in here.
SUPFEMALE:Some veal, some chicken.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you got four loads in the laundry and a sink full of dishes, and your husband gets cranky if he has to wait for his dinner.
SUPMALE:Move! move! move! all right, here! god! So, girls, let's see what meryl picked.
LEADFEMALE:New york steak, hmm? what does your dad do for a living? He's a dermatologist.
LEADMALE:Oh, then that would be a good choice.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody here who doesn't have a trust fund? darlene, what are we going to have for dinner? Well, i'm eating at meryl's house.
SUPMALE:Who wants to see a picture of darlene dressed up like a tulip for her third-grade play? Aw.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Aw.
LEADMALE:Oh, not me.
SUPMALE:Where's that ground garbage? Here you go.
LEADMALE:Yes, girls, ground beef the stuff that gives meat loaf its bulk.
LEADMALE:But meat's supposed to be bad for you.
SUPMALE:So are kool-pops, but you got to draw the line somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:Let's roll.
OTHERMALE:Darlene, you stay here with mommy.
SUPMALE:Why? Because i've decided you're going to be teacher's pet.
LEADFEMALE:So all right, there we go.
SUPMALE:Corn flakes, girls the most important ingredient in tonight's entree.
SUPFEMALE:Why do we need that? how else you think we're going to turn 2 pounds of ground beef into 11 pounds of mouth-watering meat loaf? And the leftovers stay crunchy in milk.
SUPMALE:All right, suck-up, hand me a box there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nay.
LEADMALE:That's the name brand.
SUPFEMALE:Here, meryl.
LEADMALE:Bon appetit.
SUPFEMALE:We have to go for the generic.
LEADFEMALE:Why, it's nothing but second best for our family.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:My cereal at home is the name brand.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:See, it's just the name brand box.
LEADFEMALE:I've been refilling it with the cheap stuff since 1985.
LEADMALE:You mean i've been eating generic frankenberries? I'm sorry you had to find out this way, sugar.
LEADFEMALE:So anyways, all right, we got our hamburger, our corn flakes, our potatoes.
LEADFEMALE:I say we roll, huh? what about a vegetable? Ketchup.
SUPMALE:Darlene, go pick up a couple of boxes of twinkies over there.
LEADFEMALE:How do they save you money? They're for my brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Cheaper than karate lessons.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:We're going to go check out.
LEADFEMALE:Do you all have your coupons? Yes.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Did you rub off the expiration date like i said? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, we're on a tight schedule.
LEADFEMALE:Let's roll.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, girls, this here is the check-out line.
LEADMALE:This is where you'll spend the majority of your adult life.
LEADFEMALE:And this is where they really try to get you.
LEADFEMALE:It's all about impulse buying, but you got to try to resist the impulse.
LEADMALE:You got to say, "i do not need anything here.
SUPFEMALE:" i do not need anything here.
LEADMALE:Except for these here tootsie rolls.
LEADMALE:Do you believe this? That woman's on every cover of every one of these papers.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:She put a voodoo curse on her ex-husband.
LEADMALE:She's a damn good singer, though.
LEADFEMALE:Look what this here guy's buying vodka, mallomars, and a tv guide.
LEADMALE:I'm thinking, "single and staying that way.
OTHERMALE:" ma'am, you have more than 10 items here.
LEADFEMALE:I got, like, 12.
SUPFEMALE:Give me a break.
LEADFEMALE:Move to another line.
LEADFEMALE:Come on! Those are the rules.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:I got 12 girls, 12 items.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give each one an item, we'll be here for 12 years.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody in a hurry? Ok, ok.
LEADMALE:I count 10 items.
LEADMALE:That's why it's called the express line, girls.
LEADMALE:You get to express yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Price check on aisle three.
SUPFEMALE:That's $1.
LEADMALE:29.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I don't think it's worth more than that, do you? Aah! Well, girls, this is some of what you're going to be feeding.
LEADMALE:Are you sure we bought enough? In the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? who are all those girls? They're ours, dearest.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you remember? My god.
SUPFEMALE:How long have i been asleep? All right, all right, you girls.
LEADMALE:This is where we're going to turn all these fine and dandy ingredients into a lovely meal that'll make your family look you in the eye and say, "let's eat out.
SUPFEMALE:" you, write this down.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, take that meat and the corn flakes and the tomato sauce, garlic salt, salt, and a couple eggs.
LEADMALE:Mush them all up and everything.
LEADMALE:And then put it right here in this cake pan with the brown and black stains on the bottom and cook it at 375.
LEADFEMALE:All right, girls, there you have it a nutritious meal for five plus two lunches for only 12.
LEADFEMALE:73.
LEADMALE:Cheaper than fast food, faster than cheap food, and that is what i call home economics.
LEADMALE:How long do we cook it? Till the oldest kid comes down and whines, "oh, god, not meat loaf again!" call me when you're ready.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:I don't see why i have to be stuck in this kitchen cooking dinner for this family.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah! yeah! Yeah, why? This is a proud, proud, proud moment for me, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you're sounding like real housewives.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe they're in there cooking us dinner.
LEADMALE:Could they tune up the truck for extra credit? I suppose that depends on how nice you're going to be to the teacher.
LEADMALE:Mmm, mmm, mmm.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of salad dressing would you like, mr.
SUPMALE:Conner? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody's ever asked me that before.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're just confusing him now, susie.
LEADMALE:Orange or red, dan? Oh, orange.
SUPFEMALE:It's the thousand island in the door of the fridge.
SUPFEMALE:Now, where were we, my pet? Appetizers.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nobody needs to see that! Someone just pulled in our driveway.
LEADMALE:Who? I don't know.
LEADMALE:He looked angry.
LEADMALE:You want to get that? Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez.
LEADMALE:Conner? Possibly.
LEADFEMALE:I'm jim morgan, kevin morgan's father.
OTHERMALE:That's the kid that's beating up on d.j. that's not what i heard.
OTHERMALE:Kevin came home with a fat lip today.
LEADMALE:Said if he doesn't bring d.j. two twinkies tomorrow, he'll get it again.
LEADMALE:You're saying d.j. was beating up your kid? That's terrible! d.j. , come on down here now! yeah, step on it, killer! No sudden moves.
OTHERMALE:We don't want to rile him.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Come over here.
LEADFEMALE:This is the kid? D.j. , uh, this is kevin morgan's dad.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPFEMALE:He says you've been beating on his kid.
LEADMALE:Is it true? Wait.
OTHERMALE:Something's wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Kevin could take this kid apart.
OTHERFEMALE:D.j. , what's going on? Kevin was picking on me, so i got somebody else to pick on him.
LEADMALE:I hired a bodyguard.
SUPMALE:It cost me one twinkie every day.
SUPFEMALE:My god, dan.
LEADFEMALE:It's the famous twinkie defense.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't buy it.
LEADFEMALE:Why wouldn't he just tell me about this bodyguard? who's the bodyguard, deej? Maxine spencer.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Well, enough said, huh, morgan? That is one twisted little kid you got there.
LEADFEMALE:That twisted little kid was just defending himself.
LEADFEMALE:Your kid started the whole thing.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to call this off.
LEADFEMALE:Not until you call your kid off.
OTHERMALE:You don't tell me what to do.
OTHERFEMALE:Settle down, or i'll give my wife a doughnut to kick your butt.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out of here.
SUPMALE:All right, einstein! Dan.
OTHERMALE:What? Don't encourage him.
SUPFEMALE:Kid's a genius! He's an extortionist.
LEADMALE:So, what, now i'm buying twinkies for maxine instead of kevin? No.
LEADFEMALE:I told kevin i'd call maxine off if he gives me two twinkies every day.
LEADMALE:Then i give one to maxine and eat the other one.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't cost you anything.
OTHERMALE:He is a genius.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing out here? I just wanted to tell you i learned something important today.
SUPMALE:Your job is important, and it's tough.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll marry a rich guy so i don't have to do any of it.

LEADFEMALE:Crystal, he brings you breakfast in bed? how was it? No, i mean the breakfast.
OTHERMALE:Well, of course ed's going to do something romantic.
LEADMALE:It's valentine's day, for crying out loud.
LEADMALE:Only the slimiest lowlife of a husband would forget you on valentine's day.
SUPMALE:And he just came in.
SUPFEMALE:I got to go.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't forget.
LEADFEMALE:What did you get me? A surprise.
SUPMALE:To both of us, huh? Here.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least my son remembered.
LEADFEMALE:"happy valentine's day from your son.
SUPMALE:Love warren.
LEADMALE:" warren? The one i made was lousy.
LEADFEMALE:I would have loved it anyway, d.j. , because you made it with your own two hands.
LEADMALE:Is there gravy on this? did you fish it out of the trash? was that wrong? Keep going.
LEADFEMALE:You're making the old man look good.
LEADFEMALE:It's not too late if he asks tomorrow.
LEADMALE:He's not going to ask me anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Who ain't going to ask you anyway what? can we just eat breakfast, please? We're all gathered together.
LEADMALE:This is the perfect time to get caught up.
LEADMALE:There are three other people to get caught up on.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Dan, you going to work today? Yep.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , you got scouts? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, you still blonde? Yeah.
LEADMALE:So, darlene, what's going on? It's just like you to get all gross about this.
LEADMALE:How come you can't talk behind my back like a normal mother? Ok, let's do it.
OTHERFEMALE:His name is barry.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Get in here, jackie.
LEADMALE:Darlene's got a boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Who? This guy she met playing basketball.
OTHERMALE:He's a sophomore.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, an older man.
LEADFEMALE:She really wants him to ask her to the valentine's dance.
LEADMALE:I suggested she invite him over to help study math.
SUPFEMALE:I thought the helpless girl approach was better than her larry bird thing.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to catch her groping, like with that last guy.
SUPMALE:This is completely different.
SUPFEMALE:She didn't even like that last guy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, then.
LEADMALE:Becky, what should i wear? I said the pink skirt.
LEADMALE:It's too short.
LEADMALE:She's knows nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like this darlene-pink-skirtboy-too-short thing.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't like this whole husband-stupidforget-valentine thing.
SUPMALE:I didn't forget.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, d.j. , i'll drop you off at school.
LEADFEMALE:Well happy valentine's day anyhow, honey.
LEADMALE:See? I'm not mad.
SUPFEMALE:So, jackie.
LEADMALE:Uh, now that you're off the police force ok, i forgot.
LEADFEMALE:Help me out here.
OTHERMALE:What does she want? I'm sure whatever you pick out would be tell me! Lingerie.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no! She says you never buy her anything that makes her feel sexy.
OTHERMALE:I bought her cable, didn't i? It's what she wants.
LEADMALE:How about jewelry? She loves jewelry.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't have any of her own, but she admires it on others.
LEADMALE:You're embarrassed because you think you'll be the only man in the lingerie store, and everybody's going to be staring at you and thinking you're a pervert.
SUPMALE:You've been a great help.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, come on.
LEADMALE:A lot of guys do it.
LEADMALE:It's romantic.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i don't know.
LEADMALE:How am i even going to know if it fits? Try it on.
LEADFEMALE:Good brownies.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:They have nuts in them.
LEADFEMALE:They're good.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Nuts.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, she looks constipated.
LEADMALE:It's all those nuts.
OTHERMALE:She's fine.
OTHERFEMALE:She's just got to relax.
LEADFEMALE:Much better.
OTHERFEMALE:Ohh! Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:That's ok.
LEADMALE:I just go get something to clean that up.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, clean that up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he hates me.
SUPFEMALE:He does not.
LEADMALE:He thinks i'm a dork.
LEADMALE:Show him you're something special.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah a special dork, the head dork, the dork queen.
LEADMALE:Geez, darlene.
SUPMALE:Try flirting a little.
LEADMALE:You know, smile, laugh, lean in and listen like what he's saying is important.
LEADFEMALE:Lean in and listen? Yeah, like this.
OTHERFEMALE:You're making this up.
SUPFEMALE:I'm only trying to help you out.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, ok.
LEADMALE:He's gorgeous, isn't he? He's cute.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, he's a god! This homework thing's kind of lame, but he came over, so he must like me, right? why shouldn't he like you? You're funny, you're cute, you're wearing my clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:There is one problem.
LEADMALE:What? Right now he's out there with mom alone.
LEADMALE:I figure when your husband forgets valentine's day, you've got a right to say something, you know? I don't want to go busting his chops or nothing, but i want a little romance.
LEADFEMALE:Is that wrong? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:What's that, lassie? you say timmy fell down a mine shaft up on big rock mountain, and grandpa's already up there waiting? I'd better get out there.
LEADMALE:Good girl.
LEADMALE:Your mom's nice.
LEADMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Uh, this is my sister becky.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I've seen you in school.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like another brownie, barry? Uh, no.
LEADMALE:Maybe i should take off.
LEADMALE:Uh, barry, have you got your license yet? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:I'm waiting to get a car.
LEADFEMALE:Ahh.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of car? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:What she said.
LEADMALE:My dream car is a red corvette with a turbocharger, but i'll probably wind up with my aunt's gremlin.
OTHERFEMALE:What is she doing? flirting? Well, god, i hope she doesn't hurt herself.
OTHERFEMALE:We're married 17 years, and he forgets valentine's day.
LEADMALE:I'd divorce him if i were you.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going to reward him.
LEADFEMALE:So did duke get you anything? Oh, he's such a sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:There were a lot of women in his life before we met.
LEADMALE:So for valentine's day, he's going to have their names removed from his back.
SUPFEMALE:I'd kill for a guy like that.
SUPMALE:That's how i got him.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Hello! I'd like to speak with the manager please.
OTHERMALE:He's not here.
SUPMALE:He's never here.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's why they fired him and hired me.
OTHERFEMALE:Leon carp, your new boss.
OTHERMALE:Which leads me to ask, why aren't you working? Nobody's asking for anything.
SUPFEMALE:Attitude we'll cover that later.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, new rules.
LEADFEMALE:Ready? First when your shift starts, you start.
OTHERMALE:If you're five minutes late, you're docked five minutes pay.
LEADMALE:Wow! That's almost 30 cents.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i got to go to the bathroom.
LEADMALE:Here's a buck.
LEADMALE:That's very funny.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Now, to continue on i've been hearing that the customers like to come in here because they enjoy themselves.
LEADFEMALE:You're friendly.
SUPMALE:You chat.
OTHERMALE:We think it's our sexy uniforms.
OTHERFEMALE:Why is this restaurant in the middle of this store? Because when our customers are hungry, we do not want them to leave.
SUPMALE:After they've eaten, we want them back out there buying things.
LEADMALE:Should we be mean? Not mean.
OTHERFEMALE:Brusque.
OTHERFEMALE:That's going to cut down on our tips.
SUPMALE:You'll make it up in volume.
SUPFEMALE:You want us to work twice as hard for the same money? That's great.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I got to go.
LEADMALE:Are you enjoying that coffee? Yes, i am.
LEADFEMALE:That's wonderful! Get her out of here.
LEADFEMALE:She is definitely cute.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you ask her? Her whole family was there.
LEADFEMALE:Her sister was hanging out with us.
LEADFEMALE:Dance is tomorrow, bud.
SUPFEMALE:I think she likes me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not sure.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:What? That's her mother.
SUPMALE:Look, guys, don't, please.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:So all you guys know what you want? Barry does.
SUPFEMALE:But she's not on the menu.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to go.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? It's too embarrassing here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it is not.
SUPMALE:I know you like my daughter, right? Ok.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:I'm a young, hip, happening kind of mother here.
LEADMALE:I totally dig this teen romance stuff.
LEADFEMALE:That's why i'm giving you some advice, barry.
SUPMALE:Call her, dude.
LEADMALE:It's more complicated than that.
OTHERMALE:I mean, darlene it's not complicated.
OTHERFEMALE:You sure? Just promise me you'll have a small wedding, then you'll move away.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, this is barry parker.
LEADMALE:Is this darlene? I'll get her.
SUPMALE:Darlene! hurry! it's him! it's him! it's him! it's him! Now i'm the kind of girl i hate.

LEADMALE:What? I wanted to talk to you, becky.
LEADMALE:Do you have a date for the valentine's dance? hey, bonnie, i'm sleeping over at your house tonight, ok? I was hardly here.
LEADMALE:Exactly how did i steal him away? "well, hello, barry, y'all going to be driving sometime soon?" oh, darlene, i told you, he's not even my type.
SUPMALE:He's not good enough for you? He's 50 times better than the mutants you date.
LEADMALE:You're not making any sense.
SUPMALE:I don't have to.
LEADMALE:I just have to be more careful with my boyfriends when my sister's feeling feisty.
SUPFEMALE:Mother.
SUPMALE:What's going on? Barry called and asked me out instead of darlene.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Would you tell her i didn't do anything? Darlene, you know, it's not take her side like always.
SUPMALE:She's just your little princess.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? She never takes my side.
LEADMALE:We're always arguing.
LEADMALE:She makes my life miserable.
SUPFEMALE:Am i right? Well, i do what i can.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't care what she says.
OTHERMALE:You hated the idea that i could have a boyfriend.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't have to take this.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Run away, becky, like you always do.
OTHERMALE:You know, darlene, this isn't becky's fault.
LEADFEMALE:This happens to all girls.
LEADFEMALE:It really does.
SUPFEMALE:I promise, it'll get better.
LEADFEMALE:"tomorrow's another day.
SUPMALE:" "it's not the end of the world.
LEADFEMALE:" did i leave anything out? There's plenty more fish in the sea.
SUPMALE:That about covers it.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think? pervert? No.
LEADMALE:Husband.
SUPMALE:He's starting to buckle.
SUPMALE:I got him.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Can i help you? No, thanks, i'm i'm just looking.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm not looking.
LEADMALE:I didn't come to look.
OTHERMALE:I don't enjoy doing that kind of thing.
SUPMALE:Why don't you believe me? Something for your wife.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Valentine's day? Thank you.
LEADMALE:How sweet.
SUPMALE:What do you think she would like? a teddy? a nightie? how about a robe? Robe yeah, yeah.

OTHERFEMALE:You said a robe, but i think she'll really like this.
LEADMALE:See how sheer it is.
SUPMALE:Feel it.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:It won't bite.
SUPMALE:It's ok.
OTHERMALE:I know you want to.
LEADFEMALE:It's wonderful.

LEADMALE:Sir, are you ok? I got to go my car.
LEADMALE:Arnie.
SUPMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:My car broke down i was outside bye.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:If darlene's in the bedroom, i'll be in the living room.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i hate this.
LEADMALE:You remember kenny billows, my first love? The guy that told you you should cut your hair short like twiggy's, and you'd look real cute.
LEADMALE:So i cut it.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, he was wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember what i was like after he dumped me? You wore hats.
LEADFEMALE:I stayed in my room for three days.
LEADMALE:You listened to me cry, fed me pizza, and got me to put on make-up.
SUPMALE:I was good then.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad i can't do that for darlene now.
SUPFEMALE:I never could have taken that to mom, so maybe what darlene needs hey, i got an idea.
SUPMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:It was my idea.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, becky, how's that book? Incredibly boring.
LEADFEMALE:You know, becky, that's not your fault that that barry kid asked you out.
SUPMALE:I mean, you're very pretty, and you're a sophomore, and you're comfortable around boys.
OTHERMALE:And it's not his fault, either.
LEADFEMALE:It certainly isn't darlene's fault.
LEADFEMALE:The book is better than this, mother.
OTHERFEMALE:She really needs you now, becky.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going up there.
LEADFEMALE:She'll just dump all over me.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Then she'll probably cry some more.
SUPMALE:It'll be an awful experience, and i'm glad i won't be having it.
LEADFEMALE:So why should i? You're the big sister.
LEADMALE:You get to date first and drive first.
LEADFEMALE:You get to do everything first.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene's going to be killing herself her whole life to catch up to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Give her a break.
LEADMALE:She needs somebody to unload on right now.
LEADMALE:This time i'm not good enough.
OTHERFEMALE:This is very, very nice of me.
OTHERFEMALE:I want big points.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it would be a selfless act, but at the last minute she pulled it out.
LEADMALE:I was never trying to catch up to you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? You wish you were me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Get out of here.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:That was the burden of my entire life trying to hold myself back so you wouldn't feel overshadowed by my magnificence.
OTHERFEMALE:You're dreaming.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, could i see you? He got it.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADFEMALE:Guilt is a many-splendored thing.

LEADFEMALE:I made it with my own two little hands.
SUPMALE:Oh, dan.

SUPMALE:I went to the underwear store and everything.
OTHERFEMALE:People were staring at me, leering.
OTHERMALE:I felt so cheap.
SUPMALE:"dear roseanne, "though this gift is not what you desire, "the sentiment is clear.
LEADMALE:"if you need proof i love you still, hell, rosie, i'm still here.
SUPMALE:" "love, warren.

LEADFEMALE:She looks just like you.
SUPMALE:That's so gross.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:You know what i mean.
SUPMALE:So, did he spend the whole night gazing at you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Sort of.
LEADFEMALE:Did he ask you to dance? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:So? i thought, what would darlene want me to do? so you punched him in the neck? I just told him to get lost.
OTHERMALE:Then i told angela she was his second choice.
LEADFEMALE:So what did she do? Well, let's just say old bar won't be dancing for a while.
SUPMALE:Cool.
SUPMALE:I can't look at you.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:You may ask, why do 100 enemies with 100 swords pursue one poor poet? Because they know this poet is a friend of cyrano de bergerac! You lied to me.
LEADMALE:Ok, so it's not exactly like pinocchio.
LEADFEMALE:You should have caught on, d.j. , when she said the elephant man was like dumbo.
SUPMALE:What, is aunt jackie on? No.
LEADMALE:You're drooling on me.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i got to go.
OTHERMALE:No, dan.

SUPFEMALE:They'll know i didn't memorize the lines! Bye.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you're dumping me for some stupid merit badge! That's the most important thing in my son's life.
SUPFEMALE:And this is important! you're no sister, running out on me now! i already should have told you this theater thing is getting out of hand! What's that supposed to mean? With everybody else, it's a hobby.
LEADMALE:You're making it a career 'cause you got nothing else going on.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what you think.
LEADMALE:Since you quit the force, you just been hanging out.
OTHERMALE:Now it's the theater, but it's still just hanging out.
LEADMALE:Ok, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Thanks for being there for me.
LEADFEMALE:See you.
OTHERFEMALE:Shut up, dan.
SUPMALE:You've scrambled the eggs too hard.
SUPFEMALE:He just said they were too loose.
SUPFEMALE:Now they're too chewy, and they make his face hurt.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not cooking for him anymore.
LEADFEMALE:He can just lick the vaporub off his chest.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, girls, your brother's a chipmunk.
SUPMALE:Woodchuck.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Where's dad? how's he doing? He's driving us crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Does my tongue look funny to you? Oh, gross! Well, well.
LEADFEMALE:It lives.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i feel a little better.
SUPMALE:Then how come you're driving the girls crazy? Kicks.
LEADFEMALE:Did jackie call? No.
OTHERMALE:She's a big girl.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:What i said to her was true, you know, but maybe i was a tad insensitive.
SUPMALE:How unlike you.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i ought to just back off and let her live her own life.
LEADMALE:Christian.
OTHERFEMALE:Cyrano! What is this urgency? She read the letters.
LEADFEMALE:She wants to see me.
LEADMALE:Ah, that is good.
OTHERMALE:But she thinks they are my words.
LEADMALE:Is someone calling? is someone calling? is someone calling? is someone calling? Relax.
LEADMALE:You're doing great.
SUPMALE:You think so, lou? Well, you're no shirley fiske.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, who is? Not you.
LEADMALE:Stand beneath the balcony whilst i stand behind the tree and whisper the words for you to woo her.
LEADFEMALE:Call her forth.
LEADMALE:Roxanne.
SUPFEMALE:Roxanne.
LEADMALE:Call her forth louder.
LEADMALE:Roxanne! is someone calling? is someone calling? Roxanne! Jackie, someone's calling.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god, lou! Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, ok.
OTHERMALE:Roxanne! She comes out not.
SUPMALE:Mayhaps we are at the wrong balcony.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:So are you from france originally? is someone calling? what shall i say? Hear what i say and repeat it.
LEADMALE:My words before could not express my words before could not express what my heart truly feels.
SUPMALE:What my heart truly feels.
SUPFEMALE:Um "i can see that you love me no longer.
LEADMALE:" my father the duke is calling.
LEADFEMALE:Be right back.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? "i can see that you love me no longer.
LEADMALE:" we had an argument.
LEADMALE:We'll work it out.
LEADMALE:I'm in a play.
LEADFEMALE:That is the line, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:It's no use, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Go on out there.
LEADFEMALE:I'll feed you your lines.
LEADFEMALE:We can't do that.
SUPMALE:Why not? They're doing it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, the big dipper.
LEADMALE:I can see that you love me no longer.
LEADMALE:Oh, you gods oh, you gods see how i love see how i love more than words can say.
LEADFEMALE:More than words can say.
LEADMALE:Why are your words why are your words so halting? so halting? how shall i explain? I shall speak for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Each word struggles through the dark seeking your light.
LEADFEMALE:If that were true if that were true my own words my own words would struggle like yours.
LEADMALE:Would struggle like yours.
LEADFEMALE:Your words come more easily than they did before.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:But i've never spoken with my true heart before.
SUPMALE:Why not? Because i've never spoken to your heart before.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:Christian you do tremble like a leaf.
LEADMALE:Yes, i tremble with love, for you have made me love you.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Win me a kiss.
SUPMALE:Now i could die, but for one thing a kiss! Come then, it awaits you.
SUPFEMALE:Go! climb! A kiss sweet as nectar.
SUPFEMALE:Come claim your prize.
LEADFEMALE:Roxanne! Hey, lou, is that guy single? I need the table.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Jackie was good tonight, wasn't she? Yeah, well, the important thing is she fit the costume.
LEADMALE:Hey, phil, good job tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, thanks, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Jackie did good, don't you think? I've been doing community theater for 14 years now, and no.
SUPFEMALE:She remembered most of her lines.
LEADFEMALE:That she did.
SUPFEMALE:I'll see you.
LEADFEMALE:I said no, al! You're going to tell me you didn't feel something special going on between us tonight? I was playing a part.
LEADMALE:I was acting.
LEADMALE:You're not that good of an actor.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, al.
LEADMALE:Good night, roxanne.
SUPFEMALE:What a doof.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you were great.
LEADMALE:No, i wasn't.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, you were.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody was leaving during my curtain call.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, because it's snowing outside.
LEADMALE:They wanted to get home.
LEADMALE:Shirley got roses.
LEADMALE:I didn't get roses.
SUPMALE:You only get roses on opening night.
LEADFEMALE:You're just saying that so i won't feel bad.
LEADMALE:Jackie, have some confidence, ok? God, you're pathetic.
LEADMALE:You know, you were right before.
LEADMALE:I haven't done anything since i quit the force.
LEADFEMALE:Take your time and figure out what you want to do.
SUPMALE:I've had plenty of time.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I was proud of being a cop.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to do just anything.
LEADFEMALE:You'll find something, jackie.
LEADMALE:Trust me.
SUPFEMALE:You've got lots of potential.
LEADFEMALE:You'll find the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:You really thought i was good, huh? I couldn't believe it.
LEADMALE:I thought you were great.
OTHERMALE:Maybe roxanne isn't my part.
OTHERMALE:She dumps the cool guy with the big nose for the moron with the cute butt.
LEADMALE:That's right up your alley.
SUPFEMALE:Want to watch some tv? No.
LEADFEMALE:Make yourself some soup.
LEADMALE:You'll feel better.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Can i go bowling? no! You just want me to watch you be sick? You're damn right.
LEADFEMALE:Read that.
SUPFEMALE:The elgin bulletin? Some guy came in from out of town and reviewed the show.
SUPMALE:"cyrano stinks"? That's the good part.
LEADFEMALE:"is it illegal to yell yuck "in a crowded theater? Last night, this reporter considered it.
LEADFEMALE:" get down to where it mentions my name.
SUPMALE:"lured by the promise "of a masterful performance "from regional legend shirley fiske, "we were at first disappointed "to find jacqueline harris "in the role of roxanne.
LEADMALE:"but disappointment waned as our minds began to wander.
LEADFEMALE:" this guy's a moron.
LEADMALE:Just keep reading, dan.
LEADFEMALE:"let's just hope miss harris has enough sense not to quit her day job.
OTHERMALE:" see? He doesn't know what he's talking about.
LEADMALE:You don't have a day job.
OTHERFEMALE:I must find a way to make her love me.
LEADFEMALE:Now.
OTHERMALE:And how am i to tea how am i to tea how am i to tea ah-choo! Bless you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, anyway and how am i to teach you now? what? Nose! your nose! Oh, god.

SUPFEMALE:Ah-choo! Call her forth.
LEADMALE:Roxanne.
SUPMALE:Is someone call ah-choo! is someone call ah-choo! A token of her love
SUPMALE:
OTHERMALE:Look science.
LEADMALE:God, what a slow day.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but maybe if that guy with the danish leaves us a $400 tip, we can close up early.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, here comes the boss.
SUPMALE:Look busy.
LEADMALE:Hey, leon.
LEADMALE:Oh, listen, i know it's slow, but isn't there something menial you could be doing? Well, we're talking to you.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, look who's here.
LEADMALE:Knocked off early.
OTHERMALE:Thought i'd do something special for myself.
SUPFEMALE:New thermos.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, plaid.
LEADMALE:Snazzy.
OTHERMALE:I want to knock off early, too.
SUPFEMALE:Can you cover for me? No problem.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i got the afternoon off.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll do something together.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go grocery shopping.
LEADMALE:I'll go in and buy the groceries, and you sit outside and play the radio.
LEADMALE:Quality time.
LEADFEMALE:See you later, bonnie.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, sorry.
LEADMALE:Leon, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, leon.
LEADMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, don't you think it might be appropriate to, say, uh, check with the boss before simply taking off? Well, it's dead in here and everything.
LEADMALE:Bonnie said she'd cover for me.
SUPMALE:What's the problem? The problem is that you keep doing this.
LEADMALE:You took yesterday morning off, you didn't tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Last saturday, estelle covered for you, estelle tells me that.
LEADFEMALE:I set the schedule around here, roseanne, and you're ignoring it, which makes me wonder if you really want this job.
LEADFEMALE:Of course i do.
LEADMALE:The hours are great.
LEADFEMALE:It's freezing out there.
LEADMALE:But it'll be 80 degrees when we get to vegas.
SUPMALE:Oh, i can't wait.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, check this out, these really cool sunglasses i bought.
LEADMALE:Why do you need those? You're never leaving the casino.
LEADFEMALE:They're to cover my eyes when i'm bluffing.
LEADFEMALE:You can't bluff a slot machine.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't see why not.
LEADMALE:You talk to the dice.
LEADMALE:Slots don't pay.
SUPMALE:Let me teach you to shoot craps.
SUPFEMALE:I don't like that.
LEADMALE:You got to stand up the whole time.
SUPMALE:Best odds in the house.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, the best odds in las vegas in our favor are at the buffet table.
LEADFEMALE:That reminds me, bring your big purse.
LEADFEMALE:Anyways, i don't care nothing about gambling.
SUPFEMALE:Alls i want to do is see wayne newton.
LEADMALE:Ooh, yeah, the main wayne.
LEADMALE:The big fig.
OTHERFEMALE:Sir isaac wayne.
LEADFEMALE:Remember we saw him in chicago, and he was singing apple blossom time just to me? Thought he was singing to me.
LEADFEMALE:Dream on.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:I don't want you guys living on pizza the whole weekend, so i bought you this nice ravioli.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:So, what time you guys leaving tomorrow? Soon as i get off work.
OTHERFEMALE:So that would be, what, 5:00? Yeah, i guess.
LEADMALE:5:30? becky, you trying to get rid of us? No.
LEADFEMALE:I want to make sure i'm here to say goodbye at, what, quarter to 6:00? I think that's about right.
LEADFEMALE:You got to allow yourself time to get to the airport.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's a great idea, honey.
LEADMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:So, dan, i guess this party we don't know about starts, what, 7:00, 7:30? party? why would they have a party the one weekend we're going to be out of town? Knock, knock.
LEADFEMALE:Who's there? Ohh, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for bringing me that suitcase, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:You shouldn't be hauling that in your condition.
LEADMALE:There's nothing in it, dan.
SUPMALE:Roseanne asked to borrow it for your trip.
LEADMALE:Here, sit down.
LEADMALE:Goodness, dan.
LEADMALE:I'm pregnant, i'm not dying.
LEADMALE:He's just wonderful like that, crystal.
SUPMALE:When i was pregnant with darlene, he was so nice, i held her in for 16 months.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:We're going to miss you when we're gone.
LEADMALE:I'll take good care of him, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Why can't i stay with becky and darlene? I don't want you to spend the weekend locked up in a closet.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, here's $5.
SUPFEMALE:00.
SUPMALE:Put it in one of those machines that has the million dollar jackpot, and if it wins a million dollars, stop.
LEADMALE:I'm up 5 bucks, and you said the slots don't pay.
LEADMALE:You know, i envy you two.
LEADMALE:A weekend of luxury in las vegas.
SUPMALE:Well, we try to get away, what, every 15, 16 years? You know, so we can relate to each other as a man and a woman.
LEADMALE:Yeah, then after that, i'm going to go shoot craps.
LEADMALE:That'll kill another five minutes.
LEADFEMALE:The fire extinguisher's in the closet, emergency numbers are by the phone dad that reminds me, i'll write down the hotel number just in case there's a problem.
LEADMALE:Dad, we're not babies.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to worry about us.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not worried about you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm worried about the house.
SUPFEMALE:So, what time's the party start? what are you talking about? Girls, listen.
LEADFEMALE:When i was your age, and my parents went out of town, i had a party.
LEADMALE:I had a great party.
LEADMALE:Legendary.
LEADMALE:People wrote songs about it.
SUPFEMALE:Did your parents know you had it? Course not.
LEADFEMALE:Then we're not having a party.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! hi! Hi.
LEADMALE:Is d.j. ready? D.j. , aunt jackie's here.
LEADFEMALE:What time do you want me here tonight? jackie's coming over? why? It's still a big secret.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh, that's cute.
LEADFEMALE:We're not having a party.
SUPMALE:Why won't you believe us? Dan, i got a great idea.
SUPMALE:Since i'm coming over to hang with the girls, how about i wear my old cop uniform? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like they're having a party or anything.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, ok, we're having a party.
OTHERFEMALE:God! Ok, right to the rules.
OTHERFEMALE:No booze, no pot, no sex below the neck, everybody out by midnight.
SUPFEMALE:1:00.
SUPFEMALE:12:30, and no rap music.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? I don't like it.
LEADMALE:God, why don't we just bob for apples? Yeah, then we can take turns reading from the bible.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , let's go! Thanks for taking him over to crystal's.
LEADMALE:You'd better get going.
OTHERMALE:You got a 1 1/2 hour drive to chicago.

OTHERFEMALE:No, ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't here weeks ago.

SUPFEMALE:That suit doesn't work here anymore, and he didn't take care of it.
SUPMALE:No, you're working tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to vegas.

LEADMALE:I got non-refundable plane tickets.
SUPMALE:Ohh! Oh, well that falls into the category of not my problem give me a break.
LEADMALE:You give me a break! You just come and go here as you please.
OTHERFEMALE:You totally ignore me.
LEADFEMALE:That's what this is about, i'm not nice enough? I'm running a business, and i need a waitress tomorrow, so let's just say either you're here to work your shift, or don't come back at all.
SUPFEMALE:If we don't go, we're out $500.
LEADFEMALE:So you think i should go.
OTHERFEMALE:We've been saving for this trip forever.
OTHERMALE:I know that.
LEADMALE:If we drive the speed limit, we'll just miss the plane.
LEADMALE:I've got to talk about this some more.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, talk.
LEADMALE:I know you think it's just some waitress job, but i really like it, and i like bonnie, and i like being at the mall, too.
LEADFEMALE:Leon's a piece of garbage, but i quit that job, i got to find another, and what if that boss turns out to be even worse? crazy world, isn't it? Ok, let's go.
SUPMALE:Boy, you really care about this.

SUPMALE:And you are? I'm jackie.
OTHERMALE:I'm a former senior.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie.
LEADMALE:Jackie.
LEADMALE:You know, that is a beautiful name.
LEADMALE:These parties make it real hard for two people to get to know each other well.
LEADFEMALE:I got a car.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we go somewhere listen, eric, you're very cute, but you and i together would be illegal, so i don't think so.
LEADMALE:Hey, ok.
LEADFEMALE:It's cool.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Still got it.
OTHERFEMALE:I tried to get her out.
LEADFEMALE:The old broad said no.
LEADMALE:Yeah, thanks, anyway.
SUPMALE:Hey, becky.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hey, brian.
SUPMALE:Um if i asked you a question, would you not tell darlene that i asked you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well you know how what happened with us, right? You made out on the couch and then you groped her.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, she made me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, so? Well, i asked her out, you know, exclusively, and she said no.
SUPMALE:I don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, darlene's just sort of discovering boys, brian.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, till she met you, she thought she was one.
LEADFEMALE:So i should be her boyfriend, right? Becky, there you are.
SUPFEMALE:I was looking for you.
LEADMALE:Brian, can you excuse us? where you been, beck? Around.
OTHERFEMALE:Around where? Outside.
LEADFEMALE:With mark? I was going to tell you, but i couldn't find you.
LEADMALE:Ohh, ok.
OTHERMALE:You won't tell mom and dad, will you? No.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're so cool.
LEADFEMALE:Not really.
LEADFEMALE:Your folks figured he'd show up.
SUPMALE:They said it was ok as long as i was here.
LEADMALE:You're kidding.
SUPFEMALE:He just drove away.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I was going to tell you, but i couldn't find you.
LEADFEMALE:Becky.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Barry's here.
SUPFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:He's such a scuzz.
LEADMALE:If he came to drool over you, i swear i'll kill him.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, darlene.
SUPMALE:Hi, barry.
LEADFEMALE:Could i talk to you? I don't think this is a good idea.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene liked you, and you asked me out.
LEADMALE:She's real vulnerable, and she shouldn't have to go through this again.
OTHERFEMALE:Shut up, becky.
SUPMALE:What did you want to talk about, barry? look, i never really did apologize for what for? you liked becky more than you liked me, so you asked her out right? Well, it wasn't that i liked becky exactly.
LEADMALE:It's just that she's popular, and i figured i had a chance with her, so it's kind of like, you know, go for the gold.
LEADMALE:Becky's gold? so what am i? Darlene well, come on, barry, pick a mineral.
LEADFEMALE:You're funny, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i'm a regular riot.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's what's great about you.
LEADMALE:I mean that's why i like you.
LEADMALE:You like me? hey, you leave her alone! Who are you? Her boyfriend.
LEADMALE:Boyfriend? Oh, we had a thing.
LEADMALE:It's over.
SUPFEMALE:It was fine until you came along.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't push me.
LEADMALE:You mean like this? no, like this! jeez, darlene, who is this guy? hey, there's a fight! hey! hey! hey! let me through! let me through! hey! come on, you guys! you guys! come on! What's going on here? I was talking to darlene and he i am her boyfriend.
LEADMALE:That's not what she says.
LEADFEMALE:Any more trouble out of you, you're out of here.
LEADMALE:They were fighting over you? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it, show's over.
LEADMALE:Nothing more to see.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:And as for you, darlene excellent.
SUPMALE:This is your captain speaking.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to apologize for the delay, but the snow's coming down pretty hard and we're awaiting tower clearance, which, hopefully, we'll be getting any minute now.
LEADMALE:So, in the meantime, why don't you sit back, relax, and wait.
LEADMALE:8.
LEADFEMALE:8's the point, and eighter from decatur.
LEADFEMALE:Get this plane to vegas.
OTHERMALE:These peanuts are no good.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't grow them, dear.
LEADMALE:And the seats are too small, too.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't build the plane, dear.
LEADFEMALE:It's never going to stop snowing, is it? My fault.
LEADMALE:Stop acting like everything i'm saying is your fault.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:No, i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I've been blaming you the whole time, and it stopped being fun an hour ago.
SUPMALE:Well, if it will make you feel any better, i'm up $56,000.
LEADMALE:If we were in vegas, i could quit my job, too.
LEADFEMALE:I really liked that job, dan.
SUPMALE:I know it wasn't a career or nothing, but i was happy, and i hate losing it.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry i pushed you.
SUPFEMALE:I just thought you'd feel better once you found yourself on an overcrowded, uncomfortable little plane that won't go anywhere.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you won't have to lose that job.
SUPFEMALE:Once we get back, you can talk to the guy.
LEADFEMALE:Take a shot.
LEADMALE:That would be like groveling.
LEADMALE:You want me to talk to him? No, i think i'd better fight my own battles.
SUPFEMALE:We're going to go see wayne newton.
LEADMALE:I bet we get some lousy seats, too.
OTHERMALE:I'll make sure we get seats right down in front.
LEADMALE:Yeah? close enough for me to hit him with my underpants? you will take them off first, won't you, dear? I ain't making no promises.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen all right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:We just heard from the tower.
LEADFEMALE:The snow's getting real bad out there, so they're trying to determine whether we can take off at all.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll know in a moment.
OTHERFEMALE:Hang in there.
SUPFEMALE:We're going to make it.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:Look at it out there.
LEADFEMALE:This plane ain't going nowhere.

SUPFEMALE:I don't care.
SUPMALE:All right, you know what you want? are there any specials today? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, is there anything you could recommend? Yeah, hurry.
SUPFEMALE:I guess i'll have the tuna melt.
LEADFEMALE:Good choice.
OTHERMALE:Oh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot to order a beverage.
LEADFEMALE:Then you must be really kicking yourself right about now, huh? Hi, bonnie.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:I thought you were in las vegas.
LEADFEMALE:No, the flight got canceled, so we spent the night in chicago.
SUPMALE:Then it took us half a day to drive back.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Well, well, well.
LEADFEMALE:Look who came crawling back.
SUPMALE:Leon.
OTHERFEMALE:Work, bonnie.
LEADMALE:So, roseanne, how the hell are you? Ok, this is not easy but, uh, if you don't give me my job back, my husband's going to beat the crap out of you.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, we both know why you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, all you have to do is say, "i want my job back," and i'll give it to you.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you hire somebody else? I was going to, but you're here begging for your job, so i'm not begging.
SUPFEMALE:No, of course not.
SUPFEMALE:You have your, uh, dignity.

SUPFEMALE:So i says, "leon, you want me to come back, alls you got to do is ask.
LEADFEMALE:" you really said it? Yep.
SUPMALE:Did he give you a raise? 100 bucks an hour.
LEADFEMALE:All right! Oh, i forgot to tell you, when i called the hotel to cancel the reservations, they said there was a huge earthquake and las vegas got sucked under the ground.
LEADMALE:Wow, it's a good thing we didn't go.
SUPMALE:You bet! I forgot to tell you something, though.
LEADFEMALE:You know, while we were gone, the kids all met really rich guys and they all got married.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , too? Uh-huh.

SUPMALE:No, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:I got a microwave.
LEADMALE:I don't have to start cooking till dan comes home.
SUPFEMALE:I made a meat loaf in 12 minutes.
SUPMALE:It still tasted like crap, but it was so hot, nobody could tell.
SUPMALE:Mother, talk to d.j. i was just in the bathroom completely naked, and he barges in.
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:You traumatized him.
LEADFEMALE:He'll be gay for sure now.
SUPFEMALE:God, i hate you, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, are you listening? Your son is sick.
LEADFEMALE:After seeing you naked, he's probably puking his guts out.
OTHERMALE:You shut your face, or i'll shut it for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Go for it, barbie! maybe i will, ken! I think i heard something.
SUPMALE:What? That's the third time he's walked in on me.
LEADMALE:It was an accident.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:I'll call you later.
SUPFEMALE:The sedative i gave the kids for breakfast is wearing off.
LEADMALE:Look me in the eye and say it was an accident.
LEADMALE:I can tell when you're lying.
LEADFEMALE:It was an accident.
SUPMALE:Could you tell? Jeez.
LEADFEMALE:I have so much to teach you, sprout.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody home? It's me arnie.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in, arnie.
SUPMALE:Mother.
LEADFEMALE:I'll talk to him later.
SUPMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:I will.
SUPFEMALE:Just keep your shirt on there.
OTHERMALE:Very funny.
LEADMALE:Is this a bad time, rosie? It's a bad life, arnie.
SUPMALE:I'm about to nuke some dinner, though.
OTHERFEMALE:I could go for something to eat.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Well, then go.
OTHERFEMALE:You're always a kidder.
LEADMALE:Not always.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, nancy's got dinner for me at home.
SUPMALE:We're shacking up.
LEADFEMALE:How romantic.
LEADFEMALE:I got evicted from my place, so it worked out good.
LEADMALE:We can spend a lot more time together.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing like quantity time with the person you love.
SUPFEMALE:But you get tired of always seeing that same face.
SUPMALE:Hey, did i tell you we're getting married? when's she due? you're kidding, right? Yeah, i'm kidding.
LEADMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:The minute i turned my back, you stole my man.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going, buddy? Great.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? Hang on a second.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you tell me arnie was getting married? He didn't want it to mess up his dating action.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:So many magazines, so little time.
OTHERMALE:I really appreciate this.
LEADMALE:No problem.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have the money back in six, seven weeks tops.
SUPFEMALE:Check ok? you got an id? Thanks, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:See you, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:"you got an id"? how much did you lend him? A couple bucks.
SUPMALE:How much? $1,500.
LEADFEMALE:He's thrown work my way.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you talk to me? It's covered.
LEADFEMALE:I got steady work till christmas.
SUPFEMALE:I'd never do that without talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:For once in my life i can write out a check to help a friend, no questions asked.
LEADMALE:It's for his engagement ring.
LEADFEMALE:How's this new microwave working out? You know, the one i bought you without asking.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:I should have asked you.
SUPFEMALE:You want me to stick my head in the oven? Kids, dinner.
SUPMALE:We're having butt roast.
SUPMALE:Dad, if d.j. accidentally walks in on me one more time, i'm going to kill him.
SUPMALE:I'll talk to d.j. later.
SUPMALE:You say you'll talk to d.j. , so does mom.
LEADFEMALE:Is anybody going to do anything? Try locking your bathroom door.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Now it's my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Everything wrong in this world is my fault.
LEADFEMALE:You just figured that out? Drop dead.
LEADMALE:You got to talk to d.j. the little pervert walked in on me again.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , stop peeking at becky! ok! There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Mother.
LEADFEMALE:I'll talk to him after i put the groceries away.
OTHERMALE:Hey, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hey.
LEADMALE:Becky's in a mood.
LEADMALE:Becky's always in a mood.
SUPFEMALE:What you doing? Putting together some bids.
OTHERFEMALE:My, aren't you ambitious? i thought you were busy through christmas? Not anymore.
SUPFEMALE:The company went belly-up.
OTHERMALE:We'll never see that 6,000 they owe me.
LEADFEMALE:Why does this always happen to us? We're ok.
LEADMALE:I got some jobs lined up.
LEADMALE:I just have to pay a couple small bills.
LEADFEMALE:Like what kind of small bills? Car payment, mortgage, credit cards.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:Cut it out.
SUPFEMALE:We're ok.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean by ok? you mean "becky can still go to college" ok, or "oh, boy, the government's giving away free cheese" ok? I know what you're thinking.
LEADMALE:Even if i asked arnie for the money back, we'd still be short.
LEADFEMALE:By how much? 20 bucks.
LEADMALE:Roseanne i didn't know this was going to happen.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure arnie won't mind.
LEADMALE:Why don't you tell him to return the money? No way.
OTHERMALE:He probably didn't buy the ring.
LEADMALE:A guy doesn't ask for money back after it's lent.
SUPFEMALE:A guy? what, is this some kind of testosterone thing here? i got it covered, ok? will you be letting the little woman in on how? I'll just get a swing loan.
LEADFEMALE:Why go to the bank? Because that's where the money is, my pet.
LEADFEMALE:But maybe you should ask your folks or my folks.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't i just borrow it from your folks? Yeah, wait a minute ugh! The bank's just going to charge you some huge interest.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i know how to cut a deal.
LEADMALE:I'll just waltz in and act like i don't need the money.
LEADFEMALE:You better act like you got a gun.
LEADMALE:Ah, here it is.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Traffic directional guidance apparatus.
SUPMALE:Or as we on the force like to call them, white gloves.
SUPFEMALE:Without these, i'm just some idiot standing in traffic.
LEADMALE:With those, you're just some stop.
SUPFEMALE:You see? The power of the glove.
LEADMALE:So, uh did you get these moves at the police academy? No, the pips.
LEADMALE:So how'd it go? Smooth.
OTHERMALE:What's going on? how come you're all dressed up? what, this old thing? Come on.
LEADMALE:Jackie, do the words "none of your business" mean anything to you? Go ahead and tell her.
SUPFEMALE:She's family.
LEADFEMALE:I had to negotiate a loan from the bank.
LEADMALE:For what? I wanted to be in debt.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:I came up a little short this month and needed help paying bills.
OTHERMALE:I got cash saved.
OTHERFEMALE:I could loan you some.
OTHERMALE:No, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd lend you money, you'd pay me back.
LEADMALE:It's like a game.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, make it stop.
LEADFEMALE:I say we take her for every cent she's got.
LEADFEMALE:How much you talking about? 1,500.
SUPMALE:Is that all? That's chump change.
SUPMALE:Not that all chumps would have that change.
SUPMALE:It's taken care of.
OTHERFEMALE:How much interest are we paying? what difference does it make? I want to know! There's a loan fee of $150.
LEADFEMALE:The interest rate is 19 1/2 %, ok? You really forced them to their knees there, ace.
SUPMALE:I'll tell you what, i won't charge you any loan fee or interest.
SUPFEMALE:You just got to, uh suck up to me for a couple weeks.
LEADMALE:Well, hell, in that case, no.
OTHERFEMALE:How come it's ok to pay this huge interest, but it's not ok to get it from jackie for nothing? It's good business, dear.
SUPMALE:Ok, forget sucking up.
LEADFEMALE:Just your undying gratitude.
SUPFEMALE:I said no! Don't yell at my sister.
SUPMALE:I just don't want her damn money.
LEADMALE:Dan just keep your nose out of my business.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez.
SUPFEMALE:Grump.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what got into him.
SUPMALE:The opportunity to kiss your butt doesn't come along every day.
SUPMALE:I was joking.
LEADMALE:I'll apologize.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:Listen, you want to make it up to him? Write him a check.
OTHERFEMALE:He won't take it.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, he will.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me.
SUPMALE:Just make it out to roseanne conner.
LEADMALE:Aah! mom, darlene hit me! I didn't touch you.
OTHERFEMALE:I barely pushed you.
LEADFEMALE:There's no place like home.
OTHERMALE:There's no place like home.
LEADMALE:There's no place like home.
LEADMALE:No! mom! Damn.
LEADMALE:She hit me! He was watching me get dressed.
LEADFEMALE:I said to cut that out.
OTHERFEMALE:You said stop peeking at becky.
LEADFEMALE:He's got me there, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Now the little pervert's peeking at me.
LEADMALE:Why? It was fun for everybody when he peeked at becky, but now someone may get hurt.
OTHERMALE:D.j. , come here.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, go away.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene called me a prevert.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not a prevert, honey, you're a pervert.
LEADFEMALE:You're just growing up and curious, but you don't like people walking in on you when you're getting undressed.
LEADFEMALE:Neither do your sisters.
SUPMALE:Does daddy see you naked? Yeah, but it's different for married people.
LEADMALE:Married people have to see each other naked.
OTHERMALE:Knock knock.
LEADMALE:Anybody home? Hey, rosie.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I'll be right with you.
LEADFEMALE:You just need to respect your sisters' privacy more, ok? Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Or else one of them's going to kill you.
LEADFEMALE:Go get ready for bed.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Kid's a peeper, huh? Boy, that takes me back.
LEADFEMALE:What, you got sisters, too? I wish.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:This is kind of a thank you thing.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take it in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't have one already.
LEADMALE:Uh, no, arnie.
OTHERMALE:I don't have a, uh, wine and soap basket.
SUPMALE:I got it at the car wash.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh did you get nancy her little surprise yet? Sure did.
SUPFEMALE:Did she like it? You bet.
OTHERFEMALE:So she's going to keep it? There's no way to return it.
OTHERMALE:What if there was, like, a really, really good reason? It's just a ring.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't buy a ring.
LEADMALE:Then what did you do? I got her one of those breast augmentation deals.
LEADMALE:Huh? You know.
LEADMALE:You got her a boob job? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Two of them.
LEADFEMALE:It's what she wanted.
LEADFEMALE:We gave you $1,500 for that? Actually, i only had half, so i borrowed 1,500 so she didn't walk crooked.
LEADMALE:What do you think? which one is ours? Hey, arnie.
SUPMALE:Dan, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh danny.
LEADMALE:Yes? There's a couple things we need to talk about.
LEADMALE:Like what? Oh, like nancy's engagement present.
SUPFEMALE:Please tell me you got her a camera.
LEADMALE:No, but we did help with the developing.
LEADMALE:You bought her the gift that keeps on giving.
OTHERFEMALE:Neat, huh? i thought you were going to give her a ring? Dan, she's got rings.
SUPMALE:Arn, ha-hang out here.
OTHERFEMALE:Finish your beer.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey, honey i thought it was for a ring.
OTHERMALE:Well, it ain't.
SUPMALE:I think he ought to pay interest.
LEADMALE:That wasn't the deal.
LEADFEMALE:We're paying the bank interest.
OTHERFEMALE:What if he can't? are we going to repossess? We'll give them to darlene, so d.j. has something to look at.
LEADFEMALE:Yep, i'm still here.
LEADMALE:You heard what was said? I missed the part about charging me interest.
LEADFEMALE:If i'd known this would happen, i would've said i got her a ring.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, arnie.
LEADMALE:It doesn't matter.
LEADMALE:I borrowed the money from jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't tell him.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you want to do that.
LEADFEMALE:It's my house.
LEADFEMALE:I got a right.
OTHERMALE:Absolutely.
OTHERFEMALE:You do.
SUPMALE:You said i was wrong.
LEADMALE:I don't want to get you mad, 'cause i owe you money.
LEADMALE:Shouldn't i give dan a check? Your check ain't worth squat.
LEADMALE:Everybody knows that, but if you give me jackie's check, i'll cover it.
LEADMALE:This is just another stupid guy thing, isn't it? If the money's from the bank or me, he's taking care of his family.
LEADFEMALE:If it's from jackie, she's taking care of his family.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't tell nancy i borrowed money from dan.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want her to think these are dan's boobs.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm the man.
LEADMALE:These are my boobs.
OTHERFEMALE:We're out of beer, honey? I'm going to get some.
LEADMALE:You want to come, arn? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i got that money.
SUPFEMALE:Arnie.
LEADMALE:You said six weeks.
OTHERMALE:It came sooner than i thought.
LEADFEMALE:Where did he get the money from? I bet on a horse named lucky arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Dan right.
LEADMALE:Lucky dan, a long shot.
LEADFEMALE:Arnie.
LEADMALE:Lucky arnie, lucky dan.
OTHERMALE:Work with me here.
SUPMALE:Why are you friends with him? Ok, i took the money from jackie myself.
LEADFEMALE:You took the check from your sister? Well, i'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Hey, enjoy the soap.
LEADMALE:Give it back, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:It's my family, too.
LEADMALE:I said no.
SUPMALE:And i said i'm taking my sister's check.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? well, what do you think of this? where the hell is that tape? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dan.
LEADFEMALE:What you up to? Waiting for gary.
OTHERFEMALE:You? Running away from home.
LEADMALE:Buy you a drink? No.
OTHERMALE:Let me buy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i'll have a beer.
OTHERMALE:Hey, willie, give me a couple beers, please.
LEADFEMALE:Oh things are good with you and gary? Yeah, great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You and roseanne? Well i tore up your check.
LEADFEMALE:What's keeping gary? I know you were only trying to help.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I had it coming.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:All these years i've been eating your food, using your washing machine, making long distance calls on the that's not important, but i just figured i'd pay you back.
SUPMALE:I appreciate it, jackie, but i borrowed money from relatives before, and it never works out.
SUPFEMALE:I agree.
LEADMALE:Remember who lent me money for my first car? You're welcome.
SUPMALE:"don't worry, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll find you a nice solid transportation vehicle.
LEADMALE:" "i don't want a nice solid transportation vehicle.
SUPFEMALE:"i want a shiny new piece of crap that looks good and goes vrrroom.
LEADFEMALE:" well, i did.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i know.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I remember back when me and rosey was getting started.
OTHERMALE:We wanted to buy the house.
LEADFEMALE:I had to borrow money from her folks your folks.
SUPFEMALE:14 years ago, and i still have to pretend i like them.
LEADMALE:Same here.
SUPMALE:So neither one of us will ever borrow from family again.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:But you'd borrow from a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:I don't think of you just as family.
SUPMALE:I think of you as a friend.
SUPFEMALE:I think of you as family.
SUPFEMALE:It would make me feel so good to help you guys out.
LEADMALE:Eeh.
LEADFEMALE:You're my friend, huh? Absolutely.
LEADMALE:You sure you got this kind of money? All you got to do is ask.
SUPMALE:You got it, pal.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Where you been? Having a drink with a friend.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:I love a man who knows when to cave.
SUPFEMALE:Are you kidding? She begged me.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Oh.
LEADMALE:Nancy's picture here it's like they follow you.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:It's eerie.
LEADMALE:There was a bunch of these.
SUPFEMALE:We shouldn't leave them laying around.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the other ones? I thought you had them.
LEADFEMALE:What do i need them for, proof of purchase? D.j. ! D.j. ! 
LEADFEMALE:I know, dan.
LEADMALE:That's the throttle.
SUPFEMALE:Which is uh, like the gas.
LEADMALE:And this is the brake.
SUPFEMALE:Which is like the brake.
LEADFEMALE:And you don't ever want me to use the two of them together.
OTHERMALE:Because because it could rip a hole in time and space, and we end up in a parallel universe.
OTHERFEMALE:Correct.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't wait till tomorrow to really lay some rubber.
LEADFEMALE:Look, why don't we just tool around in the parking lot at the k-mart first? what? you don't think i can handle this thing? No.
SUPMALE:It's not that, honey.
OTHERMALE:This is a very special bike.
LEADMALE:Yes, i know you love your bike.
OTHERMALE:You spend more time with this thing than you do with me.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, don't get upset.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's true, dan.
SUPMALE:I was talking to the bike.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm tired of being the biker chick.
OTHERMALE:I want the wind to hit my body first, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I want the insects to splat across my face.
LEADMALE:Come on, you get on the back.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm! wow! Suddenly i feel like ann-margaret in kitten with a whip.
LEADFEMALE:Look, our favorite fun couple becky and anybody-but-that-guy.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, he makes my skin crawl.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, put on your best fake smile.
SUPMALE:Hi, kids.
SUPMALE:Hey, guys, check out this car.
LEADMALE:Well, well, well.
SUPMALE:Hey, mark.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to your truck? It's my buddy's car.
LEADFEMALE:He's selling it.
LEADMALE:Beck said you're looking to get her a car.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we are? Mom, this car is cherried out.
LEADMALE:I mean, the frame is righteous, no bondo, v-8, tilt tranny.
LEADMALE:No bondo? not even a little? Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, the motor's in really good shape.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at it.
LEADFEMALE:Mark did the work himself.
LEADMALE:I put in brakes, shocks, rebuilt the carburetor.
LEADMALE:Probably made the license plates.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, check out the tuna boat.
LEADMALE:I want to sit in it.
LEADMALE:Just look at the size of the back seat.
LEADFEMALE:Just put a mirror on the ceiling.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like you retooled the heads.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:New valves, seals, everything.
LEADMALE:Nice work.
LEADFEMALE:And it's only $1,500.
SUPMALE:Thanks for bringing it by.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Think about it.
OTHERMALE:I won't need to bug you for your car.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, you won't be driving me around or worrying about me banging up your car.
LEADMALE:We like all that stuff.
LEADFEMALE:You got a nice bike.
LEADMALE:Ever think of selling it? Actually, i'm planning on being buried with it.
SUPFEMALE:So, what about the car? We'll talk, inside.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. starts good.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, thanks for bringing the car over.
OTHERFEMALE:No problem.
SUPMALE:What, is he going to mail you your tongue back? It breaks down to about $100 a month.
SUPMALE:This isn't your territory.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, but becky's my sister.
LEADFEMALE:What touches her touches me.
LEADMALE:So she gets a car, you get one when you're 16? You don't want me to think she's your favorite.
SUPMALE:Well, i can live with that.
LEADFEMALE:What about you, dan? hey, can we talk about me now? This is really important to me.
LEADMALE:I'll get a job after school.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now, there's a start.
SUPFEMALE:If we all start socking it away now, maybe we can swing it by summer.
SUPFEMALE:Summer? Lend me the money now, and i'll pay you back.
OTHERFEMALE:Geez, it's like $1,500, becky, and that doesn't count insurance.
LEADFEMALE:I know how you feel.
LEADMALE:When i was 16, i was dying for my dad to buy me this gorgeous '64 barracuda.
SUPMALE:It had these yellow racing stripes on this purple body.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of the "way back" machine.
SUPFEMALE:Look, i have 200 bucks saved up.
SUPMALE:Where? You only got like 40 in your sock drawer.
LEADFEMALE:Mother.
LEADMALE:I got like 50 bucks you can borrow, beck.
LEADFEMALE:That'll just leave you guys with 1,250.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what's in it for you? Well, i lend you the money, interest-free, and then when i'm 16, we share the car.
OTHERMALE:You think i'd share a car with you? No way.
SUPFEMALE:Then forget it.
LEADMALE:Junior miss can take the bus till she's 40.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see why i'm always the one in this family who has to make the sacrifices.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Let's sell the villa in france, dan.
LEADMALE:We hardly ever use it.
LEADFEMALE:If you guys really wanted to help me, you could.
SUPFEMALE:I hate it when she gets like this and there's nothing to eat! I feel bad i can't afford to buy her a car.
SUPMALE:Oh, she'll live.
SUPFEMALE:She can use one of ours at night and on weekends.
LEADMALE:But that was the one she really wanted.
LEADFEMALE:She didn't even know she wanted a car till he put her up to it.
SUPFEMALE:Before she met him, the only thing she wanted out of life was to see us dead.
SUPMALE:That's not good enough for her now.
LEADFEMALE:She's got to have a car, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Well i miss the old days.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, i've been waiting 15 years for this moment.
LEADMALE:Today you are mine.
SUPMALE:Come to mama.
SUPMALE:Get your motor runnin' head out on the highway born to be wi-i-i-ild born to be wi-i-i-ild honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, look, look.
LEADFEMALE:Before i take you out and i promise i would and i will there's one thing you got to know about this bike it's mine! get off it! Oh, take a major chill pill, daddy-o.
OTHERFEMALE:Me and this hog are going out to tear up the highway.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you can either come with us or you can eat my dust.
OTHERMALE:Maybe i should ride it out of town first.
SUPMALE:Then you can take over on the open road.
LEADFEMALE:You're just afraid your low-life buddies will see you riding on the back and think you're a wuss.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Move.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, let's pop a wheelie.
SUPMALE:Ohh.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, ready? Ready.
LEADMALE:Hang on.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:This will be even more fun once we start moving! Now what's the matter? Something's wrong with the bike.
LEADMALE:What? It's not nearly as noisy as it was yesterday.
LEADMALE:I like it noisy.
LEADMALE:I keep it noisy.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody's been messing around with it, like somebody who knows about carburetors.
LEADMALE:Becky, get down here now! What's going on? weren't you going to take your brother to the movies? It doesn't start for an hour.
LEADMALE:Walk slow.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were going.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you and mark take out my harley? Answer me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You are never to touch that bike.
LEADMALE:You know that.
SUPMALE:You said i could have a car, then took both of them last night.
LEADMALE:So that's supposed to make it all right? Dad, the bike's fine.
SUPMALE:Mark even adjusted the carburetor for you.
LEADMALE:I never asked your punk boyfriend for a tune-up, and i never gave you permission to take that bike out! ever! All right, so i screwed up again.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me, becky.
LEADMALE:It's not my bike.
OTHERMALE:Ok, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It was a stupid thing to do.
LEADMALE:It was way beyond stupid.
OTHERMALE:You know what this bike means to me, but you go behind my back and take it.
OTHERFEMALE:If i would've asked, you would've said no anyway.
SUPMALE:That's right! What does that tell you? Fine.
LEADMALE:So how long am i grounded for? you don't get it, do you? This isn't some stupid curfew you broke.
SUPMALE:Dad no! You've given us crap for months now.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been on your side.
LEADFEMALE:I fought with your mom over you seeing mark.
SUPMALE:I worked on this car deal.
SUPMALE:I'm tired of bending over backwards for you, becky.
LEADFEMALE:So, if i'm not grounded, then what? I don't know uh, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:What's the point? You do what you want anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, i said i'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Just get the hell out of my sight.
SUPFEMALE:So, now you're going to be a masseuse? how did you decide that, open the phone book to the middle and point? I'm just sending off for more information.
LEADMALE:And it's not masseuse.
LEADFEMALE:It's massage therapist.
LEADMALE:So what? When people ask what my sister does, i have to say that she rubs people for money.
LEADMALE:Shut up and give me a stamp.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan, jackie's going to learn to be a masseuse through the mail.
LEADFEMALE:Geez, jack, what happen? your sea monkeys die? can i get a little support around here? Oh we're sorry.

LEADFEMALE:Go ahead, dad.
LEADFEMALE:I got to get to the job site.
LEADFEMALE:So, what are you going to do today, becky? Go to the library.
LEADFEMALE:I've a report due monday.
LEADMALE:Dan, maybe you could drop her off.
LEADFEMALE:The library? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sure, you do.
LEADFEMALE:Remember it from high school? That that big brick building we used to smoke behind.
SUPMALE:I'm late.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, dad.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give you a ride, becky.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:That's ok.
LEADMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADFEMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:It's that mark.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, here we go.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? You finished breakfast.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you go rub somebody? look, if it was going to make you that crazy, why did you let becky see mark? I didn't! dan did! You agreed.
LEADMALE:Well, she's just going to see him anyway.
LEADMALE:So you caved.
LEADMALE:No, we didn't cave ok.
OTHERMALE:Ok, we did cave, but on our terms.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I hate that kid.
LEADFEMALE:He drives me nuts.
OTHERFEMALE:Them two pieces of hair he's got going on his face, well, i hate those pieces of hair, both of them.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes i just sit up there in that chair and try to figure out which one i hate worst! You're losing it.
LEADMALE:Oh, catch up, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I have already lost it.
SUPFEMALE:And now now there are no doughnuts! Oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want? Well i want to know what's the deal between you and becky.
LEADFEMALE:Why ask me? Why not ask her? 'cause i don't know her anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you, she lies, ran away from home.
LEADMALE:You got her stealing motorcycles.
LEADMALE:Tell me, mark, what's next? You know, just so i'm not surprised.
LEADMALE:I figure we'd knock over a convenience store, but don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have her back by 10:00.
LEADFEMALE:You think that's so funny, don't you, you little punk? This is my place.
LEADFEMALE:If you're going to talk to me like that just leave.
LEADFEMALE:Stop seeing her.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Why? why, mark? are you sleeping with her? Because if you are, you'll be in jail so fast you won't know what hit you.
LEADMALE:She's 16, and you're 18.
LEADFEMALE:In case you don't know, that's illegal, buddy.
LEADMALE:I don't know why i'm asking you.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't believe nothing you say.
LEADMALE:I don't care.
SUPMALE:You have nothing in common with her.
LEADMALE:I like her.
SUPMALE:Why? what do you mean, why? don't you? Don't give me that crap.
LEADMALE:It's not crap.
LEADFEMALE:I like her, and she likes me.
LEADMALE:You can threaten me and your husband can threaten me, but it won't change a thing, and you know that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i do know it.
LEADMALE:I can't compete with you, mark.
LEADMALE:I'm only her mother.
LEADMALE:I hope you really do care about her.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Tell your husband he shouldn't open his carb all the way up unless he's tooling around at some high altitude.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, the next time we're discussing carbs, i'll be sure to bring that up.
SUPMALE:That's much better.
OTHERMALE:The bike sounds pretty bad, dad.
LEADFEMALE:The secret's opening the carb all the way.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Hey there, beck face.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, darlene, how about one of the old man's patented chocolate chip milk shakes? Sure.

SUPMALE:So, what have you been up to the last couple of days? still like this mark guy? Y-yeah.
LEADMALE:I know you think it was his idea about the bike, but it was mine.
OTHERMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:It's that rebel conner thing.
SUPFEMALE:It runs in the family.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to know i won't stand for it.
LEADMALE:I just don't want you to hate mark, you know.
SUPFEMALE:I don't hate mark.
OTHERMALE:Mom does.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mom definitely hates him.
OTHERFEMALE:Definitely.
LEADMALE:Hate.
LEADFEMALE:Mom does, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Why? She doesn't even know him.
OTHERFEMALE:She's afraid of him, becky.
LEADMALE:You see, when she was 16, this guy pulled into her driveway with a motorcycle.
SUPFEMALE:And, god, your grandma hated that guy.
LEADFEMALE:And i think that's half the reason your mom married him.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, i'm not going to marry him.
LEADFEMALE:Geez, i'm 16 years old.
SUPFEMALE:That's exactly what she told her folks.
OTHERMALE:Here we are.
SUPFEMALE:I i mean it, dad.
LEADMALE:I'm way too young to think about marriage.
LEADMALE:Anyway, i'd have to live with him first.
SUPMALE:Excuse me a moment.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, cut it out.
LEADFEMALE:You know i want to go to europe, go to college, and have a career and stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how would we know that? I mean the last time you and i talked like this you wanted to be a fairy princess.
LEADMALE:I guess it's been a while.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:From what we've been hearing, your whole life is mark.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's not.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell your mom that.
SUPFEMALE:Thick thick? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:It's been a long time for that, too.
LEADFEMALE:Too thick, beck? Uh, i think i just broke a rib.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Try a spoon.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:You bet.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, gross.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:What's going on? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Not much.
LEADMALE:Dad and becky made up, and they're being so nice to each other it's pathetic.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that your, uh, world-famous chocolate chip shake, dan? Thick thick.
LEADFEMALE:Want one? Nope.
SUPFEMALE:I'm back on my diet.
SUPMALE:You know she's coming back.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, what the hell? Oh, that feels great.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.

SUPMALE:Why don't you tell me about the trip that you and dan took on the bike? Oh, it was just awesome, you know.
LEADMALE:There we were going down the highway dan sitting behind me, totally helpless, hoarse from screaming.
LEADFEMALE:There.
LEADMALE:Now, all those muscles are loose.
LEADFEMALE:All the tension's gone.

LEADMALE:Where are you going? Out with mark.
SUPMALE:I'm tense! I'm tense!
LEADMALE:

LEADFEMALE:No way.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Think.
SUPFEMALE:You make us go on some long car trip just so you can look down a big hole.
LEADMALE:You don't want any of us standing behind you.
LEADMALE:Ok, show of hands.
SUPFEMALE:Who doesn't want to go to the grand canyon? you don't want to do anything as a family? Fine.
LEADMALE:We'll spend summer in the inflatable pool.

LEADFEMALE:Becky.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:They don't even try to humor us anymore.
LEADMALE:How come i got three kids and a husband and i end up doing all the grunt work? The beauty is you actually grunt while you're doing it.
OTHERMALE:I want a dishwasher! Now, we've been all through this, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:The kitchen wasn't designed for one.
SUPMALE:You don't have the right plumbing, you'd lose half your cabinet space.
LEADMALE:Trust me.
SUPMALE:I'm a professional contractor.
LEADFEMALE:It can't be done.
SUPFEMALE:Then i want you to build me that shelf by the door.
LEADFEMALE:That's a whole other ball of worms.
LEADFEMALE:You ain't got the right wall studs.
LEADMALE:The whole unit would fall right over.
SUPMALE:You never build me nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what about this fabulous service porch i built for your washer and drier? Just 'cause you got tired of watching me do laundry in the rain.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you didn't tell me the new neighbors were moving in today.
SUPFEMALE:What's the story? what are they like? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Like you haven't been watching through the window all morning.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the husband darren, he's in advertising, and they have this real cute little girl tabatha, but the wife, i don't know.
LEADMALE:Something's wrong with her.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's a witch.
LEADMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Who's this? He's todd.
LEADMALE:He just moved in next door.
LEADFEMALE:He's my new best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, todd.
SUPMALE:Nice to meet you.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Can todd camp out in the back yard with us next week? If it's ok with his folks.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Do you have to come? It's my tent.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll be ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I burp real good.
LEADFEMALE:Prove it.
LEADMALE:Well, you're on, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Better hold on to the table, todd.
LEADFEMALE:You're not wearing anything flammable, are you? No.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm kathy bowman.
SUPMALE:I'm looking for my son todd.
LEADMALE:Did he come over here.
LEADFEMALE:You're the new neighbor.
SUPFEMALE:Come in uh, that was my husband.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Keep your hands off him.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, so is todd here? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, todd, your mom's here! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, neighbor.
SUPFEMALE:My husband dan, my sister jackie, that's d.j. , and you know todd.
SUPMALE:Mom, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner's real cool.
LEADMALE:Yes, i heard.
LEADMALE:Aw, that.
LEADMALE:I could have done better, but i didn't want to hurt the lad.
LEADMALE:We've got a lot of packing to do.
LEADMALE:D.j. was just going to show me his room.
LEADFEMALE:It'll only take a minute.
OTHERMALE:While you're upstairs, show him how to make his bed.
LEADFEMALE:All right! Do you want some coffee? I've got some.
SUPFEMALE:I've got some fudge, too.
LEADFEMALE:It's nowhere near as thick as the coffee, but it's pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, no.
LEADMALE:No, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, sit down at least.
OTHERMALE:I can only stay a minute.
SUPMALE:So you've been doing a lot of work over there lately.
LEADFEMALE:I hope the workmen didn't bother you.
SUPFEMALE:Nah.
SUPFEMALE:Except for one time they came over and asked us to hold it down.
SUPMALE:Your turn.
SUPFEMALE:So, where you from? Oh, uh, chicago.
SUPMALE:Oh, chicago.
LEADFEMALE:I love it there.
OTHERFEMALE:There's so much going on with the restaurants and museums and theaters.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? what? I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I sneezed.
SUPFEMALE:I, uh i'm allergic to dust.
OTHERMALE:I just dusted.
SUPFEMALE:That's the only thing that makes me sneeze.
SUPMALE:You call that a sneeze? See you later, d.j. bye, todd.
OTHERMALE:Very nice meeting all of you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure i'll see you around.
LEADMALE:If you need anything, give us a call.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
SUPMALE:Man, she is a witch.
LEADMALE:Now roseanne she hated my house.
SUPMALE:She just sneezed sort of.
SUPMALE:She wouldn't sit down, she wouldn't have coffee.
LEADMALE:She wouldn't even take two steps away from the door.
LEADFEMALE:So she's nervous about new people.
LEADMALE:Why? We're fun.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i don't maybe she was a little uptight.
LEADMALE:A little uptight? Man, you couldn't drag a needle out of her butt with a tractor.
SUPMALE:Remember, we're here because we're neighbors.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm here looking for dust.
LEADMALE:This isn't going to be pleasant, is it? if i find dust, know what i'll do? I'll sneeze.
LEADFEMALE:Not one of them little needle-butt sneezes neither.
SUPMALE:I'm going to blow a lung all over her living room.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome wagon.
LEADMALE:Welcome wagon.
LEADMALE:Ohh how neighborly.
SUPMALE:Well, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just put this in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Neighborly.
LEADMALE:My god, roseanne, this is our house.
SUPMALE:Same floor plan, same stairs, same archway.
SUPFEMALE:It's the exact same house.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the house i could have had if i would have married somebody better.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:My, uh, husband's in the study.
LEADMALE:I'll just go get him.
LEADMALE:Study? They turned our bedroom into a study.
LEADMALE:Well, you turned the bathroom into a library.
LEADFEMALE:Look-it! You've been lying to me for 12 years.
SUPFEMALE:What? That there is the very shelf i told you i wanted which you says i can't have on account of there wasn't the right studs.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, stand back.
LEADMALE:That sucker's liable to fall over.
LEADMALE:This place is a death trap.
LEADMALE:Hey there, neighbors.
LEADFEMALE:Jerry bowman.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Dan conner.
SUPFEMALE:This is my wife roseanne.
LEADMALE:Great to meet you.
LEADMALE:We lived in our chicago apartment for nine years, and neighbors never brought us cake.
OTHERMALE:Come on, let's eat.
LEADMALE:Man, i just can't believe how much your living room reminds me of ours.
OTHERFEMALE:Well well, i-i'm not quite finished with it yet.
OTHERMALE:Honey remember, f-for better or for worse.
LEADFEMALE:It's a dishwasher! Bet you tore out half the kitchen to get that sucker in there.
SUPFEMALE:Not really.
LEADFEMALE:I thought there wasn't room, but then the contractor slid it right in.
SUPMALE:Whole thing took an hour.
SUPFEMALE:Was there cake? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, sit down.
SUPMALE:Oh, uh, you know, i don't have any coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we go over to our house and i'll make some? Boy, i'd love to, but i'm awfully tired.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, um, maybe we should do this another time.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:We should have given you time to settle in.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, yeah, we just need time to settle in, but, uh, look, thanks for coming, and we'll do this another time, ok? Ok.
LEADMALE:Good night, jerry, kathy.
SUPMALE:Good night, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Good night, dan.
LEADFEMALE:No coffee, i'm sure.
OTHERMALE:She couldn't wait to get us out of her house.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, honey, calm down.
SUPMALE:You'll feel better after a good night's sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:Like i'm going to get any sleep with all the noise you'll be making building me that new shelf.
SUPMALE:I'll try to keep it down.
SUPFEMALE:I'm over at buy 'n bag, so i see kathy walking by, and i'm her neighbor, so i wave at her.
LEADFEMALE:She sees me, but she walks right by like she doesn't see me.
SUPFEMALE:So i'm standing there with my hand in the air.
SUPFEMALE:Then, you know you have to wave at somebody, so i end up waving at the produce manager.
LEADMALE:Now he thinks i have the hots for him.
LEADFEMALE:I wish i could meet a guy in management.
LEADMALE:I just don't get it.
LEADMALE:Her kid plays with my kid.
SUPMALE:Her husband plays with my husband.
LEADMALE:I don't know why she won't play with me.
LEADMALE:You never used to worry about what people thought about you.
LEADMALE:That's 'cause everybody likes me.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, what does dan say? He talks to that jerry guy.
SUPMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, he goes that she never wanted to leave chicago in the first place, and she don't like it here much.
SUPMALE:Big deal.
LEADMALE:Nobody likes it here.
LEADMALE:That's why we watch so damn much tv.
OTHERMALE:Can i go now? I suppose.
SUPMALE:All right, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne yeah? I like you.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:'course, i don't have to live next door to you.
LEADMALE:Ha ha.
SUPFEMALE:50 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:What a moron.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know it was a handicap space, ok? that little glow-inthe-dark wheelchair didn't tip you off? Mom, look.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh, man.
LEADFEMALE:It's your very first ticket.
LEADFEMALE:It's just beautiful.
LEADMALE:I'll put it up here next to d.j. 's finger painting.
OTHERMALE:What am i going to do? Pay it.
LEADMALE:How about if i say it blew off the window? Yeah, that's a good one.
LEADMALE:The judge will go for that.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's, like, his first minute on the job.
SUPMALE:Hi, mom.
LEADMALE:Todd cut his arm.
LEADMALE:Oh, geez.
OTHERMALE:Darlene, get me a band-aid.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? We were playing down where they're building the new supermarket.
LEADMALE:I told you not to go down there.
LEADFEMALE:You could get hurt.
OTHERMALE:I didn't.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:That's a beauty there, todd.
SUPMALE:You'd better go home and show it to your mom.
SUPFEMALE:And tell her to dress you warm for the camp-out tonight.
LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:See you tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not done yelling at you yet.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:I told you you're not supposed to go to construction sites to play.
SUPMALE:It's dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:You could get hurt.
LEADMALE:But todd's never been to one i don't care.
LEADMALE:That's what i told you, and that's what you do.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Go on upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:I was driving you to the mall, so you should pay half.
LEADFEMALE:That's 25 bucks.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, 15.
LEADMALE:12.
LEADMALE:50.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm nah, you pay the whole thing.
OTHERMALE:Thanks a lot.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, kathy.
LEADFEMALE:I was just cleaning up a little bit.
LEADMALE:Todd told me he cut his arm at some construction site.
SUPMALE:Did you know they were there? Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:They just told me.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i left him here assuming you'd keep an eye on him.
SUPFEMALE:They took off on their bikes.
SUPMALE:You allow your son to leave whenever he wants? Yeah, i encourage it.
LEADMALE:I don't know, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:When my son takes off on his bike, i like to ask him where he's going.
LEADMALE:If he tells me it's a place with broken glass and little pieces of metal, i say no.
LEADFEMALE:You come over here, but only to tell me you're a better mom than i am.
OTHERMALE:I always know where my son is, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i've got three kids and a job, and i can't be everywhere, ok? So i've got to trust my kids, and they're still alive.
LEADFEMALE:I've obviously done something right.
OTHERMALE:You're a better mother because you have more children? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I have three, and you only have one 3-to-1, get it? I have three, i win! Oh, please.
LEADMALE:You probably sneak into todd's room to check if he's breathing.
LEADFEMALE:Yes amateur.
LEADFEMALE:My son could have been seriously injured today, roseanne.
LEADMALE:We're talking about 8-year-old boys here.
OTHERFEMALE:If you're going to blame me for everything they do that you don't like, then just don't send todd over here anymore.
LEADFEMALE:That's what i had in mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go you one better.
SUPMALE:I'm not sending d.j. over to your house, because i don't need him picking up your attitude.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and just exactly what attitude is that? That one right there.
LEADFEMALE:The one where you think you're too damn good to live next door to me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not.
OTHERFEMALE:You're some stressed-out, over-protective snob who paid way too much for her house.
SUPMALE:And how do you know everybody knows.
SUPFEMALE:Look, just forget it, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:I don't why i'm even talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not! The police knew the killer was insane.
LEADMALE:At night, he would stalk poor unsuspecting campers.
LEADFEMALE:And as he would creep up upon their tents, he would whistle.
LEADFEMALE:And then he'd hack them to pieces with a machete.
OTHERMALE:Can i have machete? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well? did they ever catch him? Yeah, once.
LEADMALE:They handcuffed him, but he hacked off his own hand to escape.
LEADFEMALE:And now, he has a hook which he uses to kill his victims and drag their lifeless corpses along the bloody ground.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to the machete? You can't have one! Anyway, he was last spotted here in lanford.
LEADMALE:The police have been searching for days what was that? what? That's the whistling killer.
SUPMALE:Don't make a sound.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be safe in here.
LEADMALE:Aah! aah! it's the hook! Mom, i thought you were supposed to bring us something to eat.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Did we scare you, d.j. ? Yeah.
LEADMALE:He was scared you would hurt the hook guy.
LEADMALE:Well, carry on.
SUPFEMALE:All right, where was i? I still don't get why todd couldn't be here.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm here, and we're having fun, right? Yeah, but he's my best friend.
LEADMALE:Well, you guys got into trouble together.
SUPMALE:So when can we play together again? When you can prove you won't do it again.
LEADMALE:How can we do that if we can't play together? Hang on a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You're here.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and i heard.
LEADFEMALE:Rosey.
SUPMALE:If i go over there, that's like admitting i was wrong, and i wasn't wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Do it for the kids.
OTHERMALE:Oh, cut the telethon crap, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Geez, i have to go over there and eat crow? You'll be the better person.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell him another story.
SUPMALE:I'll be right back.
SUPMALE:Did i ever tell you about the killer who carried his own head around in a bowling bag? No.
LEADMALE:I'm a better person.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a better person.
LEADFEMALE:Hope i don't kill her.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Um, i came to invite todd to d.j. 's camp-out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i don't know.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'm sure that we both said things that we regret.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh i meant what i said.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Uh i regret what i said, ok? Uh like, d.j. really likes todd, and to be quite frank, d.j. doesn't have that many friends.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe that has something to do with the attitude with which he was raised.
LEADMALE:Well, now, that's something to chew on.
LEADFEMALE:So, can todd come? Roseanne, i just wish i could be sure that when todd is over there, he's receiving the same kind of supervision he would be getting here at home.
LEADMALE:Ok, hey, i personally guarantee his safe return.
SUPFEMALE:Well, as long as you're admitting that you are wrong.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I'll just see if todd wants to go.
SUPFEMALE:Todd bye.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, kathy, just 'cause we're neighbors doesn't mean we have to like each other.
SUPFEMALE:No, we don't.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't even have to pretend.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i know.
SUPFEMALE:But we shouldn't take it out on the kids.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Good night, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, needle-butt.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for helping carry this in.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no problem, neighbor.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think about lanford, jerry? I think it's great.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know what i like best of all, i mean, honest? For the first time in my life, i own a tree.
LEADMALE:Wow.
SUPMALE:No, listen, i'm going to let you in on something.
SUPFEMALE:This morning kathy and todd were still asleep i went out in the yard in my robe and slippers, and honest to god i hugged my tree.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just i wouldn't tell that story down at the lodge, jerry.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, that looks good.
LEADFEMALE:That looks just like the one in my house like like exactly.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne saw it there.
LEADFEMALE:Now i have one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, you're new here.
SUPMALE:But in a small town when one man remodels, all men suffer.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Is it a boy or a girl? Wait for the ring to start moving.
LEADMALE:Side to side's a boy.
LEADMALE:Up and down's a girl.
SUPMALE:I don't want to know.
LEADMALE:Well, then don't look.
SUPFEMALE:Well, only tell me if it's a girl.
OTHERMALE:Side to side.
SUPMALE:It's a boy.
SUPMALE:Oh, i wanted a girl.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you should have laid the other way.
LEADFEMALE:This is stupid.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's do it the scientific way.
LEADMALE:Let me look at your butt.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? It's a scientific fact.
LEADFEMALE:If it's a flat pancake butt, it's a girl, and if it's a bubble butt, it's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:I am not going to show you my butt.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Just do it.
LEADMALE:God, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Get a life.
OTHERFEMALE:We're just trying to figure out the sex of crystal's baby.
LEADMALE:Who cares? It's just going to be another screaming, whining, bratty, little life-sucking poop machine.
LEADFEMALE:You still want her to babysit? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What are we going to name this baby? Well, we have a tradition in our family.
SUPFEMALE:My grandmother was ruby, and my mother was amber, and i'm crystal, so i was thinking that this must stop.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't give it some dorky name like becky.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with your dorky name? It's like a chicken noise.
SUPFEMALE:It's like becky, beck-beck-becky.
LEADMALE:You're lucky.
LEADMALE:It was the seventies.
LEADFEMALE:You could have been named frampton or chablis.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i got to go.
LEADMALE:Help me.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Mom, look.
OTHERMALE:I ate my pop-tart into the shape of a gun.
SUPFEMALE:Boom, boom.
OTHERFEMALE:I definitely want a girl.
LEADFEMALE:You better tell that to your butt.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, lamaze class tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:I'll be there.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:You're her lamaze coach? what happened to ed? I'm just a backup in case the baby comes early or ed's out of town.
SUPFEMALE:I'll deliver my baby in a pool of warm water.
SUPMALE:That's the gentlest way to deliver a baby.
OTHERMALE:And i imagine it keeps the swimmers out of the shallow end.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you.
LEADMALE:You got hurt.
LEADFEMALE:You should sue.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm fine, arnie.
OTHERMALE:You're lucky you're alive.
LEADFEMALE:What happened, dan? are you ok? Nothing.
SUPMALE:No, it's ok.
LEADMALE:I had a little accident at the job site.
SUPFEMALE:You were almost killed.
LEADFEMALE:It was great.
LEADMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:I got in the way of a wrecking ball.
SUPFEMALE:That's so lame.
SUPFEMALE:Tell them the good part.
OTHERMALE:Ok, i'll tell them.
LEADFEMALE:So dan is sitting in the porto-johnny minding his own business, and the wrecking ball comes in, and bam! Knocked that sucker 17 feet.
LEADMALE:I measured it.
LEADMALE:Did you see a doctor? It's just a couple bruises.
LEADMALE:It could be like a concussion.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a hard head.
LEADFEMALE:Does it hurt, dad? Get away from there.
LEADMALE:I'm more embarrassed than anything else.
LEADFEMALE:I crawled out with my pants around my ankles and there's 30 people standing staring at me.
LEADFEMALE:It was really an awkward moment.
LEADFEMALE:Fortunately i had the presence of mind to start the applause.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you owe us money? I got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What are you eating? Salami and peppers.
LEADMALE:One brush with death a day isn't enough for you? I live on the edge.
LEADMALE:You want a bite? Wuss.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing up? I couldn't sleep, so i thought i'd go over some bills.
LEADMALE:Maybe what happened today's keeping you awake.
LEADMALE:Nah.
LEADFEMALE:You weren't like worried something more serious could happen? Nope.
LEADMALE:So that's our will there, huh? Ok, i was curious about what might happen to my wife and family if i hadn't been so lucky.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:It's the middle of the night.
LEADMALE:Honey, i think we should talk about this.
LEADFEMALE:What would happen if we went at the same time, like in a plane crash? We never go anywhere, dan.
LEADMALE:A plane would actually have to crash into the sofa.
LEADMALE:We haven't changed this will in 16 years.
OTHERMALE:Darlene and d.j. aren't in here.
LEADMALE:We left becky to ziggy.
SUPFEMALE:He was the most responsible person we knew at the time.
SUPFEMALE:He had his own texaco card.
OTHERMALE:What were we thinking? We were thinking anybody but our parents.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Let's go to bed now.
SUPMALE:How can you go to sleep knowing the kids aren't taken care of? like they're taken care of when we're awake? Come on, dan.
OTHERMALE:I'm tired.
OTHERMALE:I really think we should deal with this.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:We'll decide who gets the kids.
SUPFEMALE:Now who do we really hate? who did we get up to? do you still want to be cremated? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Not right now.
LEADFEMALE:You know, 'cause it is pretty complicated.
LEADFEMALE:First i got to find the urn, then i got to find the matches.
OTHERFEMALE:I was hoping you'd die on a thursday when it's trash day.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try to expire near the curb, dear.
SUPFEMALE:You know, when i die, i don't want one of these funerals where everybody cries.
SUPMALE:I want you to throw a great big party.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we will, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, girls.
SUPFEMALE:So, which of us inherits this dump? what, were you eavesdropping? Well, you've been yakking about it all night.
SUPFEMALE:And face it, mom, you've got a voice that can bend steel.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, we decided that when we die we're dividing everything between the three of you.
LEADFEMALE:I just want the cash.
LEADFEMALE:It has sentimental value.
LEADFEMALE:Don't drink out of the milk carton.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing up so early? I started jogging again.
LEADMALE:I ran all the way over here.
LEADMALE:Good for you.
LEADMALE:I'm just going to rest here for a second, and then you can drive me back home.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to work.
LEADFEMALE:You want a lift? No.
SUPMALE:I'm going to get breakfast first.
OTHERMALE:It is the most important mooch of the day.
LEADMALE:You be careful.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
OTHERMALE:You got any oat bran or shredded wheat or oh, cocoa puffs.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i'm out of here, too.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Don't die.
LEADMALE:I'll do my best.
SUPFEMALE:What's that? your will? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:We were up all night figuring out who gets the kids if we die.
SUPMALE:That's got to be fun.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:You're off the hook.
OTHERFEMALE:D.j. took my keys and locked himself in my truck.
LEADMALE:Can i use yours? They're in my purse.
LEADFEMALE:Why did he do that? He doesn't want me going to work.
LEADMALE:"i'll be killed.
SUPMALE:" oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll talk to him.
LEADMALE:He'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:What did that mean, i'm off the hook? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We decided we'll leave the kids with crystal and ed.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't i get the kids? You get the washer and dryer.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't want to separate them.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm serious.
SUPMALE:I'm closer to those kids than anybody.
SUPMALE:I know, but you're a single woman.
LEADFEMALE:Well, a lot of single women raise families.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i know, but they do it from the time that they're babies.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i have been there since day one.
SUPMALE:Since they were babies.
LEADFEMALE:You're trying to tell me i couldn't do it.
SUPMALE:No, we just didn't want to burden you.
OTHERFEMALE:Which is a really nice way of saying you don't trust me.
SUPMALE:Hey, you'll thank me when i'm dead.
OTHERFEMALE:Jack.
LEADFEMALE:King.
LEADMALE:You win.
SUPMALE:Let's play again.
LEADMALE:Don't you have homework to do or something? I want to stay with you.
LEADMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:You getting hungry? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i ought to get dinner started.
LEADFEMALE:Becky! war! war! Yeah, dad? you know where mom put that casserole? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:It's in the refrigerator.
SUPMALE:I looked.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't find it in there.
SUPMALE:Geez, it's right here.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i'll put it in the microwave.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Hey, um could you hand me the aluminum foil? what for? you're supposed to keep it covered, aren't you? Dad, you can't put metal in the microwave.
SUPMALE:I was just going to use a little.
SUPFEMALE:Just forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, honey.
SUPFEMALE:What are you guys doing? Getting ready to set the table.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know where mom keeps the forks? I'm not dumb enough to fall for that stupid move.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't call him stupid.
LEADMALE:I didn't.
LEADMALE:Yes, you did.
OTHERMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:You shut up, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, whoa.
SUPMALE:Hold on, killer.
OTHERMALE:Deej, why don't you get washed up for dinner? Ok, dad.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? Since i got home, he won't let me out of his sight.
SUPMALE:Dad, he's crazy.
LEADFEMALE:He's showing concern, which is more than i can say for others considering what happened to me yesterday.
SUPMALE:You were sitting in a porto-crapper that got nailed by a wrecking ball.
SUPMALE:I didn't take one shot.
OTHERMALE:Now, that is love.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, right.
OTHERMALE:Suck up for the inheritance.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, in through the nose, abdomen, chest, shoulders.
LEADMALE:Fill up with air.
SUPMALE:Exhale.
LEADFEMALE:Think of letting go.
SUPFEMALE:Keep the breathing moving.
LEADFEMALE:Coaches, help mom relax.
SUPMALE:So anyways, jackie gets all bent out of shape, like trying to make me feel all guilty.
LEADFEMALE:She can't take care of three kids, you know? have you ever seen her fridge? She's got one egg and a can of margarita mix.
OTHERFEMALE:Coaches, a little word of encouragement for mom.
LEADFEMALE:Atta girl, crystal.
SUPMALE:Ok, let's take a little time out here.
LEADMALE:I'm sure you've been thinking of questions since the last class.
SUPMALE:Anybody? This is my first baby.
OTHERMALE:I was wondering how long it takes to push it out? 18 years.
SUPFEMALE:I take it you've got kids? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Two or three.
LEADFEMALE:Did you use natural childbirth? Well kind of, but actually there's a story that goes along with this.
SUPFEMALE:Get off me, crystal.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You're not going to scare them, are you? We'll see what i say.
OTHERMALE:Ok, now, my first kid, they just knocked me out, so i didn't feel anything.
LEADFEMALE:Then they hand me the baby.
LEADFEMALE:She's 16 now blonde and thin.
LEADMALE:I don't think she's mine.
LEADMALE:But, uh anyway, then when i had my third kid, i hadn't lost any weight from my second kid or from my first kid, so they were trying to give me this local deal and everything, but i kept feeling pain, so i keep on begging for more drugs until finally the doctor comes over and goes, "i'm sorry, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, "but if we give you any more drugs, it's going to kill your baby.
LEADFEMALE:" so i thought about it for a while and, uh then i said, "ok.
LEADFEMALE:No drugs, but just hit me with a sledgehammer.
SUPFEMALE:" of course he wouldn't, so i ended up feeling the whole thing.
SUPMALE:Was your husband there? Yeah.
SUPMALE:He had taken the classes, so they had to let him in.
SUPFEMALE:But all in all, i'm glad he was there.
LEADMALE:This is all your idea.
OTHERMALE:I hate you! let go! Oh, god.
OTHERFEMALE:It hurts.
LEADFEMALE:Breathe.
OTHERFEMALE:It helped before, but it's not helping now.
SUPFEMALE:You're not doing it.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, breathe.
SUPFEMALE:How's she doing? Contractions are a minute apart.
OTHERMALE:And she's at 8 centimeters.
LEADMALE:8 centimeters.
LEADMALE:You hear that, roseanne? Way to dilate.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god, you're such an idiot.
LEADMALE:Your mouth dry, rosie? you want a tab? Get her out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, why don't you go get some ice? Ok.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry i'm being so mean to you, dan.
SUPMALE:You're not, honey.
SUPFEMALE:You're being mean to jackie.
SUPMALE:That's why i brought her.
LEADMALE:I can't stand it.
LEADFEMALE:I got to push.
LEADFEMALE:Not till the doctor gets here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, come on, blow.
LEADMALE:Ok, ok, it passed.
LEADMALE:You're pushing.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm not.
LEADMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADFEMALE:If you're not going to do this right, let's forget it.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:We'll just go home.
LEADFEMALE:God, you're such a moron.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:This is horrible.
LEADMALE:What's happening to me? Either you're having a baby, or you ate the hospital food.
LEADMALE:Oh, god, no.
OTHERMALE:Not a funny doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Just a little more now, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Get this thing out of me! Ok, we got a head.
SUPFEMALE:Just one, right? Keep pushing, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I can't! i can't! I can't do anymore.
OTHERMALE:Yes, you can.
SUPFEMALE:Just one more good hard push.
SUPMALE:Oh, jackie, mom was right.
LEADMALE:Sex is baaad! ooh! What is it? what is it? Five.
LEADMALE:Five.
OTHERFEMALE:Five.
OTHERFEMALE:Five.
SUPMALE:One.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! it's a boy! you did it! Let me see him.
OTHERMALE:Let me see him.
SUPFEMALE:They're cleaning him off right now.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, jackie, i'm so glad you were here.
OTHERMALE:I apologize for being mean.
SUPMALE:No, that's all right.
LEADMALE:This is so great.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here at the beginning of a new life.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why you've got to be the godmother.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:The same thing you said when i asked you to be the girls' godmother.
SUPMALE:Oh, ok.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, men, men, the starting quarterback for the chicago bears, dan conner's boy-oy-oy.
SUPFEMALE:Just give me the baby.
LEADMALE:Ooh he's beautiful, dan.
LEADMALE:Just like you, honey.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello there, little baby.
LEADMALE:You tried to kill me, didn't you? Oh, look at him, dan.
LEADFEMALE:He's smiling.
SUPMALE:I'm up.
SUPFEMALE:It's late.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't sleep.
SUPMALE:Why not? I'm thinking too much.
OTHERMALE:Buddy i've already told you.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to worry about me dying, 'cause i'm not going to.
SUPMALE:You almost did.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not planning on dying for a long time, ok? Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Go to sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:But you could.
SUPMALE:Deej, if you spend all your time worrying about dying, living isn't going to be much fun, is it? well, how do i stop worrying? Well, i try to think about good stuff, like watching you grow up, teaching you how to drive a car, meeting the girl you're going to marry.
SUPMALE:I don't like girls.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you do.
OTHERFEMALE:See? I still got a lot of stuff to teach you.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Dad? when's darlene going to die? Good night, d.j. see you in the morning.
SUPMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How was baby class? You know.
LEADMALE:Same as always.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i was thinking about this guardian stuff, and i was thinking maybe we should leave the kids with jackie after all.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, we've been through this.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but she's part of their lives, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:She knows when becky's lying.
LEADFEMALE:She knows when darlene's sucking up to get money, and she understands all of d.j. 's weird little chatter.
SUPMALE:Are you feeling a little guilty? Yeah, i guess so.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you? Yeah, i guess.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:She wants them, she can have them.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Ok.
OTHERFEMALE:You go wake them up, and i'll drive them over there.
SUPMALE:Let's go to bed.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You know, dan, you need to get more life insurance.
SUPMALE:We got enough.
OTHERMALE:No, we don't.
SUPMALE:If you ever die, i want to grieve in tahiti.
LEADFEMALE:Me and dan are dead.
SUPFEMALE:You've moved into the house.
LEADMALE:You're in charge of the kids.
LEADFEMALE:Now, question number one.
LEADFEMALE:It's saturday night, 2 a.
LEADFEMALE:M.
LEADMALE:, and becky's not home from her date yet.
LEADMALE:What do you do? Ok.
LEADMALE:Um am i home from my date yet? where am i? You don't have a date, jackie.
LEADMALE:You have three kids.
LEADFEMALE:You will never have a date or life.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:No date, no life.
SUPFEMALE:I forgot.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, i would call up all of becky's friends.
LEADMALE:Wrong.
OTHERMALE:This is that 911 question, isn't it? Wrong.
SUPMALE:Ok, what? I don't know.
SUPMALE:You go to darlene's room and threaten darlene's life threaten darlene's life.
SUPMALE:I should have known that.
OTHERMALE:I should have had that one.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, question number two.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. 's found a dead cat and insists on keeping it as a pet.
SUPMALE:What do you do? I would very gently explain to him that the cat had gone through his nine lives and we would have a simple funeral.
LEADFEMALE:God, jackie.
SUPMALE:Are you even going to try or what? All right.
LEADMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Dead cat.
OTHERFEMALE:Dead cat.
LEADFEMALE:Um, i truly don't know what i'd do.
LEADMALE:Neither did i.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Next question.
SUPFEMALE:Becky and darlene have been fighting for two weeks.
LEADMALE:So? Right.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, next question.
LEADMALE:You're so exhausted from taking care of three kids and a house that you're not in the mood for sex for three whole months.
SUPFEMALE:What do you do? Maybe you ought to give the kids to crystal and ed.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's too late now.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:You wanted it.
SUPMALE:You begged me.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:You made your bed.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:So this one's ok.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't want to get a used washer and dryer.
LEADMALE:I can't afford a new one.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to put clothes that touch your body into somebody's filthy machine? I do it here all the time.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but our filth is family.
SUPMALE:What's your problem? If you get a washer and dryer, you won't come here no more.
OTHERMALE:I'm still going to come over.
LEADFEMALE:No, you won't.
SUPMALE:Nobody comes here unless they have to.
SUPFEMALE:I got to eat, don't i? Yeah, and you'll probably learn how to cook, then you'll start going to the supermarket with your fancy new washer and dryer.
LEADFEMALE:I'm putting the paper away.
LEADMALE:You're in no condition to discuss this now.
SUPFEMALE:Can i have the car on saturday night? Yeah, only if you promise to bring it back really dirty and totally out of gas.
SUPFEMALE:Mark's truck is in the shop, so i'm driving us to the spring dance.
SUPMALE:Spring dance.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, does that bring back memories.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Waiting around for weeks for some cool guy to ask you and then ending up going with some loser like glenn dickerson.
LEADMALE:Why, was he a geek or something? Ask jackie.
LEADFEMALE:It's her memory.
LEADFEMALE:No, he was not a geek.
LEADMALE:He was the only kid in 10th grade that carried a lunch box.
LEADFEMALE:Let's ice down that pitching arm.
SUPMALE:How was the game? Oh, it was ok.
LEADMALE:Ok? She was throwing bb's out there.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it! Hello? 11 strike-outs, no walks.
OTHERFEMALE:She made their best hitter cry.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i beaned her right in the neck.
OTHERFEMALE:That was an accident, right? Grow up.
LEADMALE:It's for you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:It's barry.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah? hey, barry, how you doing? did crystal drop anything off for me today? There's an envelope over there.
OTHERMALE:Yes! Thanks to my well-connected father, i now possess two tickets to the bulls play-off game this saturday night.
LEADMALE:Don't expect me to go to any stupid baseball game with you.
LEADMALE:Basketball, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Get off my back.
OTHERFEMALE:The answer's still no.
LEADMALE:I guess i'll have to find somebody else then.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! I like basketball.
SUPFEMALE:Really? How fascinating.
LEADFEMALE:But you know i think i'm going to surprise darlene with these.
LEADFEMALE:How bizarre.
SUPMALE:That was barry.
SUPFEMALE:He just invited me to the spring dance.
LEADMALE:Whoo! all right, butch! When is this thing, darlene? It's this saturday night.
LEADMALE:Saturday, huh? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Can you drive us? No problem.
LEADMALE:Oh, darlene! Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:It's your first formal dance.
LEADFEMALE:You'll remember this for the rest of your life.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you going to wear? I was thinking i'd go shh! I'm not talking to you.
SUPMALE:So whatever i decide that darlene likes best, we'll keep.
LEADFEMALE:And what do you think of these shoes with that blue dress? Uh, clash.
LEADMALE:What about something with an open toe? No, nobody wants to see her feet.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Bonnie.
LEADMALE:Hi, leon.
LEADMALE:This is linda wagner from rodbell's company headquarters.
LEADMALE:She's here to see how hard we're always working.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, cool.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, linda, what do you think of these shoes with this dress? I think they work.
LEADMALE:Roseanne is sort of our restaurant cutup.
LEADMALE:Let's try this again, shall we? Ms.
OTHERFEMALE:Wagner is here to look over our store and evaluate our employees.
OTHERFEMALE:That doesn't mean i have to take a lie detector test, does it? Every time i take one, i get fired.
SUPMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:What i'd like to do is conduct a short interview with each of you.
LEADMALE:Fantastic.
SUPFEMALE:Who'd like to start? Roseanne, i think i see your hand up there.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Bonnie, why don't we leave these two alone while we tidy up and serve our happy customers? I promise this won't take long.
LEADFEMALE:This ain't one of those "if i could be any animal on earth, what animal would i be" kind of deals, is it? No.
LEADMALE:Let me start by asking you about your boss.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so it is an animal question, then.
SUPMALE:I was wondering, is he single? leon? Of course he's single.
LEADMALE:Well, i find him very attractive.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you? Well, ok.
LEADMALE:I suppose that, uh, in kind of an offbeat aw, what the hell.
LEADMALE:Put me down for no.
SUPFEMALE:There's just something about him.
LEADMALE:He's got this mysterious charisma.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:It's strange.
SUPMALE:The second i looked at him, this voice in my head said, "i want that man.
LEADMALE:" how long you been on the road, linda? Almost six weeks.
LEADMALE:Why? Time to go home.
SUPMALE:Darlene, would you come down here? geez, where is she? I want to see some action.
OTHERFEMALE:This is so exciting.
LEADMALE:Sometimes i wish my lonnie was a girl so i could get him dolled up in a pretty dress.
SUPFEMALE:I don't do that, of course.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, take my breath away.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't she exquisite? Obviously a woman of taste.
LEADMALE:You look weird.
OTHERFEMALE:You smell weird.
SUPMALE:What? Mmm try on the blue one.
SUPMALE:Why? Because i don't know how i feel about this dress until i see you in the blue one.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Becky.
SUPMALE:Go with her.
SUPFEMALE:Don't leave her alone with that dress.
LEADFEMALE:This is a joke, right? No, it's not bad.
SUPFEMALE:You've been to these things before.
LEADMALE:Is this going to work? Well, that depends on what you're going as.
OTHERMALE:Yeah? well, what are you wearing? I decided not to go.
LEADFEMALE:These things are so immature.
OTHERMALE:Mark bailed, huh? It was awkward for him.
LEADFEMALE:The spanish teacher he was dating in 11th grade is going to be chaperon.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, you want to look in the mirror? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh, why did i do that? Ok, she wants to see the blue dress, let's show her the blue dress.
LEADMALE:"it's too blue.
LEADMALE:" "looked better on the hanger.
OTHERMALE:" "rhubarb with hair.
LEADFEMALE:" "makes too much noise when i walk.
SUPMALE:" "it makes me look lopsided.
SUPMALE:" well, you do look like judy jetson.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, yes.
LEADMALE:This is definitely it.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:This is the first one that i had on.
LEADMALE:I know that, but these shoes totally make the difference.
LEADMALE:They make the outfit, right? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Nice shoes.
SUPFEMALE:Gotcha.
SUPFEMALE:Now you'll have to start shaving your legs below the sock line.
SUPFEMALE:Those aren't socks.
LEADMALE:Oh, dan! come in here and meet your beautiful young daughter! Wow, you look incredible.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you ought to see her in the yellow one.
OTHERMALE:No, this one's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, i have the next dance.
LEADFEMALE:May i? Oh, just shoot me now.
SUPFEMALE:As time goes on i realize just what you mean to me and now now that you're near promise you're hmm da da da da share and oh, geez.
LEADFEMALE:How's the pitching arm, kid? It's ok.
SUPMALE:You really do look nice, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:And you dance divinely.
OTHERMALE:I'm stepping all over your feet.
LEADMALE:I happen to enjoy that.
LEADMALE:I hate slow dancing.
SUPMALE:If this barry tries to hold you too close, tell him you got to throw up.
SUPMALE:Oh, i thought i was going to save that for when he wanted to have sex.
LEADFEMALE:I i got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, i'm going to change into human clothes.
OTHERMALE:No, we've got to decide what we're going to do about your hair.
LEADMALE:Stop it.
LEADFEMALE:I like my hair the way it is.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go and get a make-over.
OTHERMALE:We'll go saturday before the dance.
LEADFEMALE:No! Forget it.
LEADMALE:This is something i always wanted to do with you.
LEADFEMALE:It'd be like a girl thing.
SUPMALE:Mom, i have practice on saturday.
LEADFEMALE:You could miss it.
SUPMALE:If i do, i might not start in the next game.
OTHERMALE:Your first formal dance is way more important.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah? then why don't you go? Because i have nothing to wear.
LEADMALE:Boy, you better go to practice.
LEADMALE:You missed me by a mile.
SUPFEMALE:That's not paid for yet.
LEADFEMALE:Take it back.
LEADMALE:Take them all back.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get my own dress.
LEADMALE:You pick it up.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Pick it up, darlene.
LEADMALE:Why, so you can play barbie doll some more? what are you talking about? i bought you a beautiful dress for the dance! Why don't you give me this kind of attention when i do real stuff, like striking out 11 guys without walking anybody? Oh, ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Way to go.
LEADMALE:You ever brag about that to jackie and crystal? No.
LEADMALE:But some guy asks me to some lame dance, and i'm a big deal.
OTHERFEMALE:That's so sick.
LEADMALE:How come you never said anything about this before? oh, why bother? I want to talk about this some more.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Go ahead.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, you are such a spoiled brat, and i am sick of it.
SUPFEMALE:I told you i wanted every customer to have a flower.
LEADMALE:Oh, not now, leon, i ain't in the mood.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, this customer does not have a flower, so find a vase and give him one.
LEADFEMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Well, someone forgot to take her polite pill this morning, huh? why don't you lay off? She's having a bad day.
OTHERFEMALE:Good afternoon, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Ms.
LEADFEMALE:Wagner.
SUPMALE:For you.
LEADFEMALE:A freshly cut spring flower.
LEADMALE:How sweet.
LEADMALE:I got to leave early for my kid's baseball game.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:This is our evaluation day, remember? Now, please have a seat.
LEADFEMALE:And observe your well-oiled rodbell's machine in action.
OTHERMALE:I have a better idea.
LEADMALE:Shoot.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't the two of us find a nice little italian restaurant, order a bottle of chianti, and get to know each other? Whoa.
SUPMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Way too much information in that sentence.
LEADMALE:These evaluations are just so dull.
LEADMALE:I thought we could find something more exciting to do.
LEADMALE:You're coming on to me here, right? I'm trying.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i would like a cup of coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like some coffee? Sure.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Go for it, stud.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Where else are you going to find a woman that good-looking and that desperate? No.
LEADFEMALE:Not interested.
LEADFEMALE:Go on over there.
SUPFEMALE:If you take her out, i can leave.
LEADFEMALE:So stop acting like you got integrity and do it.
LEADMALE:No, i'm not looking for this kind of relationship.
LEADMALE:She don't want no relationship.
LEADFEMALE:She just wants a little slap and tickle.
LEADMALE:Think of it as a career move, leon.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, maybe you'll get promoted to some restaurant where, like, the employees respect you.
OTHERMALE:I'm not sleeping with her just so you can leave early.
SUPFEMALE:Geez, i ask you for one little favor.
OTHERFEMALE:Linda.
SUPMALE:Ahem.
SUPFEMALE:I, uh, really appreciate your offer.
LEADMALE:It's very flattering.
SUPMALE:But, uh, i'm already seeing somebody else.
SUPMALE:You are not.
LEADMALE:Am, too! Leon, don't worry, it's ok.
OTHERMALE:But it could have been fun.
LEADMALE:Ok, let's talk about this restaurant.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Am i missing something here? what does she see in him? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:If you were single, would you no.
OTHERFEMALE:What if he was rich? No.
SUPMALE:Or a movie star or royalty? Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:If he were the last man on earth? I'd demand a re-count.
LEADMALE:I gave the tickets to a friend.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, dad, i know how hard it was for you to get the tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Now darlene's not going to the dance, so ok, how many coffee filters would you have to sell for me to get two more tickets? Ok, put me down for 25,000.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, dad, see what you can do.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:The kids are going to have to start drinking coffee.
LEADFEMALE:What's this about darlene's not going to the dance? She called barry and backed out.
LEADMALE:I knew that was going to happen! Now i have to go talk to her.
OTHERFEMALE:The thing is, dan, this is all my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Imagine that.
LEADFEMALE:You spend all your life trying to teach your kids that they're always wrong, and then something like this has to go and happen.
LEADMALE:Darlene? Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Can i come in? I guess so.
OTHERMALE:I tried to get off early from work today so i could go to your practice.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, we don't practice on fridays.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Then i didn't miss anything.
LEADMALE:When's the next game? It's all right.
SUPMALE:You don't have to come.
OTHERMALE:No, next time you bean somebody in the neck, i want to be there cheering you on.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:You just better know that when i pitch, i spit.
LEADFEMALE:So? When i dust, i spit.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a great idea.
LEADMALE:I just thought of this.
OTHERMALE:You ought to call up barry and tell him you will go to the dance and wear whatever you want and have you hair however you want it.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Don't miss out on this just to get back at me.
LEADMALE:There's better ways to get back at me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe becky's boyfriend has a little brother.
SUPMALE:I didn't blow the dance because of you.
SUPMALE:It was a lot of things.
LEADMALE:Every time i would put on those dresses, everybody would treat me weird.
LEADMALE:I didn't feel like the same person anymore.
LEADMALE:Well, no, you kind of are not like the same person anymore, you know? So sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I guess i shouldn't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's ok.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i just may never get into proms and stuff.
SUPMALE:I like dating and boys and everything.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't think you have to go through the crap to get to the good stuff.
LEADMALE:You've been hanging out with aunt jackie too much.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry that i threw that dress on the floor.
LEADMALE:It's ok.
LEADFEMALE:They took it back.
LEADMALE:I did buy you these shoes that i think you'll like.
LEADMALE:I can't wear those high heels.
LEADMALE:Just open the box.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:Golf shoes? mom, you got me golf shoes? oh, you mean they're not baseball shoes? I should have listened to the sales guy.
LEADMALE:I just thought these were way cuter.
SUPFEMALE:It's almost time for tip-off.
SUPFEMALE:I had to change into my lucky sweats.
OTHERMALE:This is going to be way better than some stupid dance.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet you 5 bucks jordan pulls a triple double.
LEADMALE:You'd have to be crazy to take that bet.
LEADMALE:I'll give you the odds.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:So where did mom run off to hide this time? Jackie's.
LEADFEMALE:She's coming to your game monday.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:You don't think if it's cold she'll run to the pitcher's mound to give me my sweater? I think you can count on it.
LEADMALE:She's probably sewing your baseball mitt onto your uniform sleeve right now.
OTHERMALE:Oh, here they come.
OTHERMALE:Bulls, bulls, bulls, bulls, bulls, bulls, bulls, ow! Oh, man.
LEADMALE:Let it ring.
SUPMALE:I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Put it up! foul! get in the game! Jerk.

OTHERMALE:I'll tell you all about it.
LEADMALE:You got any money? another day, another dollar, huh, ladies? I haven't exactly counted my tips yet, but that sounds about right.
LEADFEMALE:Leon, how did we do on that evaluation? Well, somehow, we did very well.
LEADFEMALE:It was a good thing you didn't sleep with her.
LEADFEMALE:We might have all got fired.
SUPMALE:Hello, leon.
OTHERMALE:You ready? Yeah, almost.
OTHERMALE:Oh, there's my blue shirt.
LEADMALE:I was looking all over for that this morning.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm sorry.

OTHERFEMALE:She deserves one day to relax and do nothing.
LEADMALE:What about us? We don't get a kid's day.
OTHERMALE:Some day, my angel, you'll be a parent and realize that every day is kid's day.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, you just want to smack them when they say that.

LEADFEMALE:I cleaned the entire house, went shopping for the barbecue items.

LEADMALE:Suppose i didn't like living here.
LEADFEMALE:Then you'd fit right in.
SUPFEMALE:Can i bring anything out to the table? chips or dip or something? No, i don't want you to take anything.
LEADMALE:Just 'cause i'm pregnant doesn't mean i can't pitch in.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal, it's because you eat everything before you get it out there.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the baby's hungry.
SUPFEMALE:You keep feeding him like that and he'll never want to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Mary, i can't tell you how good it is to see you again.

LEADFEMALE:What are you looking at? I'm thinking i can help you with your potato salad.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're trying to steal my recipe.
LEADMALE:Get the hell out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why won't you give me your recipe? I slaved for 30 years, creating a perfect potato salad.
LEADFEMALE:You think i'll tell you just like that? Well, i am your granddaughter.
LEADFEMALE:In regards to my potato salad, you are nothing to me.
LEADFEMALE:And speaking of nothing, did you call your mother? I'll call her later.
LEADMALE:You know, i don't talk bad about anybody yeah, i know.

LEADFEMALE:Company! Hi.
SUPMALE:Glad you could make it.
LEADFEMALE:Where should i put these deviled eggs? Out back, but don't let crystal see them.
SUPMALE:Hey, this must be chuck junior.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't be.
SUPFEMALE:The chuck junior i fed and clothed for 16 years would never have forgotten mother's day.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ma shut up.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello! Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:This is chuck, anne-marie, and the evil chuck junior.
LEADFEMALE:This is my grandmother mary.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's nice to meet you.

LEADFEMALE:Me, too, and i want you to know i'm not prejudiced.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
SUPMALE:Anne-marie, these deviled eggs are good! I should have made more.
SUPMALE:Oh! The baby just kicked.
OTHERFEMALE:It's ok, honey.
SUPFEMALE:We're at a barbecue at your brother dan's house, and all our friends are here.
SUPFEMALE:I read that you should talk to the baby so he can get used to your voice.
OTHERMALE:He can even understand a little.
SUPMALE:Hey, baby, back off the buffet.
SUPMALE:Rosey! What? I need a big bowl.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, it's in the cupboard next to the sink.
SUPMALE:Do you believe her? She throws me out of my own damn kitchen so she can make her secret potato salad.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh, we're out of coffee.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make some more.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:This ain't work.
LEADFEMALE:If people want coffee, they can make it their self.
SUPMALE:That's just what she says at the restaurant.
LEADMALE:Bonnie, how come your husband didn't show? Oh, duke couldn't come.
SUPMALE:He's still got 20 hours of community service to do.
OTHERMALE:Look at this sweater my daughter sent me from oregon.
OTHERFEMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADMALE:It's real pretty.
LEADMALE:She remembered mother's day, and she's all the way in oregon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha! Way to go.
LEADFEMALE:There's worse things, anne-marie.
LEADFEMALE:My kids all chipped in and bought me these strawberry bath beads.
SUPMALE:I'm giving them out for halloween.
SUPMALE:Rosey! What? where do you keep the tabasco sauce? In the fridge door.
SUPMALE:Hey, she puts tabasco in the potato salad.
OTHERFEMALE:No way! I'm making myself a bloody mary.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going long.
SUPFEMALE:Say, dan, you might think about stacking those coals like a pyramid.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:This way, you get them all with the lighter fluid.
LEADFEMALE:Stack them, you miss the ones in the middle.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you spray them first and stack them after? Well, no, no, no.
OTHERMALE:See, all your fluid evaporates if you do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Trust me, it's better this way.
LEADFEMALE:I disagree.
LEADFEMALE:The way you got them, they're spread out, working all alone, but if you stack them, they're working like a team.
SUPMALE:Well, let me ask you something, chuck.
SUPFEMALE:Once they're stacked in a pyramid, are you going to cook in a pyramid? Of course not.
OTHERMALE:You spread them out.
SUPFEMALE:If they're going to wind up spread out, why not start them spread out? See, dan, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:No, i understand! You're just arguing in circles, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, no well, you know what i'd do? The ones that didn't light, i'd blast them with another shot of fluid.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know what you're talking about.
LEADFEMALE:You blast hot coals with lighter fluid up the stream, into the can, and boom! You'll be a human torch.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, those burgers are looking pretty thick.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think they'll cook.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm going to stack them in a pyramid so they'll cook as a team.
LEADMALE:Arnie, how come you're not at your mother's house? I owe her money.
LEADFEMALE:You got to beat a 10.
LEADMALE:I got to beat a 10.
SUPFEMALE:Queen! I win.
LEADMALE:Give me the money.
OTHERMALE:Nana, i'm down $9.
LEADFEMALE:00.
LEADMALE:How about double or nothing? you got that kind of money? I'll owe you.
LEADMALE:No can do.
LEADFEMALE:Geez, i'm your great-granddaughter.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you trust me? When we're playing cards for money, you're nothing to me.
LEADFEMALE:Don't even think about it! Why can't he have some potato salad? I don't like him.
LEADFEMALE:He keeps hitting on me.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Come on, becky, cut.
SUPMALE:I'm not playing.
OTHERMALE:You're cheating.
OTHERFEMALE:You're accusing your nana of cheating? Nana, you haven't lost once.
LEADFEMALE:So i'm due now.

SUPMALE:I don't think anybody knows.
LEADFEMALE:The only people that ever knew are dead.
LEADMALE:To my wife on mother's day.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, shucks.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Your husband gives you a present for mother's day? Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.

SUPFEMALE:Um, oven mitts? would you just open it? All right.
LEADFEMALE:For pete's sake.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's a picture of you and the kids.

OTHERFEMALE:I sold the one i was riding to some doctor for, like, 20 grand.
LEADMALE:20 grand.
LEADFEMALE:Did i tell you i just drywalled the space shuttle? you don't believe me? Of course i believe you.
LEADMALE:You say you sold the bike for 20 grand, why shouldn't i believe you? Woof! I find these classic bikes that are trashed.
SUPMALE:I cherry them out, then when i'm low on cash, i sell them to, like, dentists who think they're bikers.
LEADFEMALE:Man, that's stuff we used to dream about doing when we were growing up.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't wait that long.
LEADMALE:Dad, i'm going to the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh, is that ours? No, it's ziggy's.
LEADMALE:Daddy! Beat it, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Say goodbye, darlene.

OTHERMALE:She kicked me out, he moved back.
LEADMALE:I figure, hey, that's life.
LEADFEMALE:Only yours, ziggy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I left a piece of my heart in her trailer.
LEADMALE:You want another brew? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I left a piece of my heart in her trailer? I left a piece of my heart in her trailer.

SUPMALE:Well, red always was her favorite color.
LEADFEMALE:I got to go.
OTHERMALE:Sure you don't want me to come with you? Oh, god! That was fun.
LEADMALE:Well, don't get all cocky.
LEADFEMALE:She's easy to humiliate.
LEADFEMALE:I have to ask you something, ok? You might think it's weird, but i want to know.
LEADMALE:What are your intentions with jackie? intentions? I don't know, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:I was going to take her to the sock hop to see if i could score.
LEADFEMALE:She's had a really rough year.
LEADMALE:She lost her job and her fiance.
LEADMALE:And now, here's ziggy again.
LEADFEMALE:All right, she's making a comeback.
LEADFEMALE:I know you, ziggy.
LEADFEMALE:You'll catch the first cocktail waitress out of here.
SUPMALE:Come on, what's with the big sister thing? You were right.
LEADFEMALE:The starter's dead.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get a new one.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:We done? Well, you tell me.
LEADMALE:It will be cool.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:What will be cool? Me and rosie are running away together.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Like i'd give up raoul for you.
LEADMALE:So, becky, you did pretty good in eighth grade history, right? Yeah, i aced it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i remember.
LEADMALE:You worked your butt off.
LEADFEMALE:I had to.
OTHERFEMALE:Yep.
LEADMALE:Did you ever make any money off eighth grade history? darlene, what are you talking about? would you happen to have a paper available, say in the 8-to-10 page range? you would actually pay for a paper? cash? Spanish-american war 25 bucks.
OTHERMALE:25? Darlene, it's an "a" paper.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what did you get a "b" on? Maybe not today or tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
SUPMALE:What about us? Man, this is where the movie totally loses it.
SUPFEMALE:You're kidding me.
LEADFEMALE:This is the best part.
LEADFEMALE:There's no way she'd get on a plane with that guy.
LEADFEMALE:Of course she would.
LEADMALE:Bogart's way cooler.
LEADFEMALE:That guy never made another movie.
SUPMALE:That guy is only the leader of the resistance.
OTHERMALE:If she doesn't go with him, france may never be free.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, right, like anybody cares about france.
LEADMALE:Uh, ma, i need money for school supplies.
LEADFEMALE:How much? Oh, 25 bucks.
OTHERMALE:Get over yourself.
LEADMALE:Well, how about 15? You do your own damn homework! Fine.
LEADMALE:I hear eighth grade's a lot easier the second time around.
SUPMALE:Hey-o! Where were you guys? Lenny's bike shop.
LEADMALE:Yeah, hanging out.
OTHERMALE:You know, being like mark, but more mature.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't talking about you.
LEADMALE:God! so, jackie, think i could crash at your place for a while? Ziggy! He's talking to me, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:How long's a while? Well, i don't know.
OTHERMALE:It looks like i may have my own business.
LEADFEMALE:I'm buying lenny's bike shop.
LEADMALE:You're kidding me? No way, man! Me and dan went down to pick up some parts.
LEADMALE:Lenny's looking to retire.
LEADMALE:So the zig-man made him an offer.
LEADFEMALE:It was so cool.
LEADFEMALE:When ziggy pulled that wad out of his pocket, lenny kissed him right on the lips.
LEADMALE:Yecchh! So, uh, jacks, you want a roommate? Well, you'd have to pay half the rent, half the utilities, and you bring your own laundry over to roseanne's.
LEADFEMALE:Deal.
LEADMALE:I hope you guys know i was totally for this relationship from the beginning.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's awesome.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's great.
SUPMALE:There's only one bike shop in town.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody knows more about bikes than him.
SUPFEMALE:This might be a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Did you think of it yourself? It's almost like you have a clue.
LEADFEMALE:I knew you'd be proud of us.
LEADMALE:Us? Yeah, me and dan.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, i i know it's new.
LEADMALE:It's a little scary.
OTHERFEMALE:But it doesn't have to be like how we fought when i started the drywall business.
SUPMALE:You didn't want any part of that, and we fought like cats and dogs.
SUPMALE:Dan, rosey.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you.
SUPMALE:Hi, doug.
SUPFEMALE:How's lois? Good.
SUPMALE:Everyone's great.
LEADMALE:How you doing, man.
SUPMALE:I'm norbert.
SUPFEMALE:Norbert walsh.
SUPMALE:Take that thing off your head.
LEADMALE:Doug.
SUPFEMALE:Please sit down.
LEADFEMALE:We missed you last week at the lodge.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:It was the kid's birthday.
SUPMALE:Had to do that miniature golf thing.
SUPMALE:How old is she now? do you believe 8? No! That's.
OTHERFEMALE:.
LEADFEMALE:That's they grow up so fast.
OTHERFEMALE:So what about the money? From what you told me on the phone, it sounds real promising.
SUPMALE:So i checked into lenny's shop, and it's going ok.
OTHERMALE:How ok is ok? Be straight with us.
OTHERFEMALE:Will we all be eating cat food or just the kids? Lenny's been looking to get out, so he may have slipped off a little bit.
LEADMALE:But with some fresh blood, anything could happen, right? And the bank has always been behind you.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, doug.
LEADFEMALE:You want to tell me about your partner? No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't make him think i'm some kind of irresponsible guy.
LEADFEMALE:I happen to have 20 grand in my shoe.
LEADFEMALE:Do you need to see that? No, but he will need another 30 for the down payment.
LEADMALE:I was thinking about selling the drywall business.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you are the drywall business.
LEADFEMALE:Without you, there's nothing to sell.
LEADFEMALE:You got any other ideas? We could give you a second mortgage on the house.
LEADMALE:The house? We'll get you a good rate.
OTHERFEMALE:This way my boss will know you're serious about it.
LEADFEMALE:The house? that the only way, doug? It's the only way i can see, danny.
LEADMALE:Sorry, zig.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man.
SUPMALE:I'll be carrying two mortgages and a business loan.
LEADMALE:I don't know when the money will start coming in.
OTHERMALE:I can't risk it.
SUPFEMALE:So you'll spend your life doing something you hate? I don't hate it.
LEADMALE:What was that about you hate going to work? Forget it.
OTHERMALE:It won't happen.
LEADFEMALE:Then i'll do it myself.
OTHERMALE:What do i need to do this thing myself? what do you got in the other shoe? Ok.
SUPFEMALE:Let's do it.
SUPFEMALE:Let's put up the house.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? Well you want to do it, let's do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure? Well, he says he believes in you.
SUPMALE:I guess i should, too.
OTHERMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, i'm just going to step outside and puke.
SUPFEMALE:You ok, rosey? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I just want to sit in my house while it's still mine.
OTHERMALE:What? did you get the loan? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks to ms.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne conner, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADMALE:We took a second mortgage on the house.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne has certain lingering doubts.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to do it anymore.
OTHERMALE:Come on, rosey.
LEADFEMALE:It's a great idea.
LEADMALE:I believe in this idea.
LEADFEMALE:You used to believe you could see yourself sleeping if you just woke up fast enough.
LEADFEMALE:And i've never been proven wrong.
SUPMALE:God, i'm going to miss this place.
LEADMALE:Come on, you guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go celebrate.
OTHERMALE:Zig, me and rosey need to be alone.
SUPMALE:Oh, ok.
LEADMALE:Come on, zig.
SUPMALE:Rosey, you are my hero.
LEADFEMALE:I will never forget this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm never going to let you.
OTHERMALE:Dan, take this lady out so she can get out of this mood.
LEADFEMALE:Zig, in 5 or 10 years when the bank's off our back, we'll be ready to celebrate.
SUPFEMALE:Meantime, i just want to stay here and concentrate on how to arrange the furniture out on the sidewalk.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I'll celebrate with you.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Guys, this is a good thing.
SUPMALE:Get happy.
SUPMALE:Later, norbert.
LEADMALE:Well, you're welcome, too.
LEADMALE:That was nothing.
LEADMALE:The official thank you will take place in the thank you room.
LEADFEMALE:What, it's no longer the begging room? Guys, i got to talk ziggy, get out of here! I got a change in plans, so we ought to discuss it.
SUPMALE:You don't go into somebody's bedroom in the middle of the night.
LEADFEMALE:You did it to me and jackie.
SUPMALE:That's different.
OTHERMALE:It was funny when i did it.
OTHERMALE:What do you want, zig? Dan, i can't go through with the, uh, bike shop.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we would just hang out and fix bikes.
LEADMALE:No big deal.
SUPFEMALE:We get tired of it, we bail.
LEADMALE:But i been thinking all night about this.
SUPMALE:You put the house on the line.
OTHERMALE:I don't want that riding on me.
OTHERFEMALE:What did you start this for? For you, man.
SUPFEMALE:You were bored.
LEADFEMALE:When i thought of this idea, you should have seen your face.
LEADFEMALE:That was worth the 20 grand.
LEADFEMALE:But it just got too big.
OTHERMALE:What did you expect? We're starting a business.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:No, man.
LEADFEMALE:You don't come blowing in here, getting everybody crazy.
LEADMALE:You don't start something you won't finish.
LEADMALE:That's why i'm not starting this.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:We could have gone under in six months, and you lose the house and the drywall deal.
SUPFEMALE:And it was my idea.
LEADFEMALE:You guys would have hated me forever.
SUPFEMALE:Now you'll hate me for a few months, and i'm back by christmas.
LEADMALE:Nah, i don't think so.
SUPMALE:Dan, we go back a long way.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:I'm too old for this crap.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, man.
LEADFEMALE:You know the way out.
LEADMALE:What did jackie say? Ah, she said a lot of things.
LEADFEMALE:But bottom line was goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, rosey.
LEADFEMALE:Well i'm going to go be with my husband now.
SUPFEMALE:It really is better this way.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm sure he'll realize that tomorrow when he's drywalling somebody's basement.
LEADMALE:What's your problem? I got nothing to do.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, call up that todd or troy, whatever his name is, and see if he'll play with you.
SUPMALE:He's in school.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:How come you're not in school? Go to school.
SUPMALE:Well at least you can't say that you're surprised.
OTHERMALE:Well, at least we didn't get in too deep.
LEADMALE:I'll tell doug at the bank we decided to back off.
SUPMALE:I'll be home late from school.
LEADMALE:I'm going to mark's.
SUPFEMALE:You've got finals to study for.
LEADFEMALE:You shouldn't be at mark's.
SUPMALE:Did i say mark's? I meant the library.
SUPFEMALE:That's better.
SUPFEMALE:I actually prefer it when she lies to me.
LEADMALE:You know what i don't get? how come it was such a good idea when ziggy was involved, and now it's not a good idea when he's not involved? Well, for one thing, it's a two-man operation.
SUPMALE:I could quit my job at the restaurant and help out.
LEADFEMALE:We'd go to work together, have lunch together, come home together.
OTHERFEMALE:Or we could stay married.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you hire becky's boyfriend, that mark? You're kidding.
LEADMALE:Well, he's good with his hands.
LEADFEMALE:Just ask becky.
SUPMALE:That's not funny.
SUPMALE:You cannot tell me that ziggy is irreplaceable.
SUPFEMALE:The guy wore a rag on his head.
OTHERFEMALE:His 20 grand was irreplaceable.
LEADMALE:Well, the bank was going to lend us 30.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe they will lend us 50.
LEADFEMALE:What's left to put up? We both know you still want to do it.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i do.
LEADFEMALE:So what can it hurt? We'll go down there, and we'll talk to doug, see what he says.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:It's worth a shot.
LEADFEMALE:And you know what the good part is without a partner for you to split the profits with, everything you make is mine.
LEADMALE:So what can it hurt? We'll go down there, and we'll talk to doug, see what he says.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:It's worth a shot.
SUPMALE:And you know what the good part is without a partner for you to split the profits with, everything you make is mine.
OTHERMALE:Mom, dad, wait.
SUPFEMALE:What a brutal fight.
SUPMALE:I can't believe that little venezuela guy's still standing! whoa! he's down, ladies and gentlemen! arturo guadalupe is down! Get up, you wimp.
LEADFEMALE:You're not even bleeding yet.
SUPFEMALE:Geez.
LEADFEMALE:Cheer up, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe he's dead.
OTHERMALE:It's over.
SUPMALE:Bag him and tag him.
SUPMALE:Mom, help me with my hair.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? It just lays there and does nothing.
LEADMALE:Trying to look all grown up for robert? Get human.
LEADMALE:I hear he does the nasty with college girls.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i hope he gets extra credit for that.
OTHERMALE:He just dated some senior who takes some college classes.
LEADMALE:No big deal.
SUPFEMALE:No, of course not.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think, dan? pigtails? Works for me.
SUPFEMALE:Just forget it.
LEADMALE:I'll do it myself.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck covering up those fresh zits tonight, princess.
OTHERMALE:You're just jealous 'cause i'm anatomically correct.
SUPMALE:And i bet you can't wait to show robert.
LEADMALE:You're such a virgin.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hey, hey, hey! You tell them, dan.
LEADMALE:She's pathetic.
LEADMALE:She's never even been kissed.
SUPMALE:Like i don't have enough spit of my own.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you've been a lovely couple.
SUPMALE:Thanks for playing our game.
LEADFEMALE:You'll die without ever getting to first base.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, go suck a tongue.
LEADMALE:Darlene, go do the dishes.
LEADMALE:Becky, go upstairs and shave something.
LEADFEMALE:And, you they won't always be this cute.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I hear once they hit 30, they start developing their own personalities and stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Have you talked to becky about birth control? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I sat her down and said, "becky, don't.
SUPFEMALE:" roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:She'll never get undressed in front of a guy.
SUPFEMALE:She thinks her butt's too big.
OTHERMALE:I've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you should talk to her.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should talk to her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, good point, my pet.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe i'll have the talk with her.
LEADMALE:We're not telling her to go have sex.
SUPFEMALE:She doesn't need our permission.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell her never, never trust guys because we lie big time.
LEADFEMALE:I had this buddy very successful with ladies.
LEADFEMALE:He'd tell them they wouldn't get pregnant if they jumped up and down afterwards.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Phil diangelo.
LEADMALE:How did you know about that? You know, i believe i will have that talk with becky.
OTHERFEMALE:I told you about that, right? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:And a 9er for brian and a 7 for chicago skinny and his faithful sidekick shrimpo.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:I ain't a shrimpo.
SUPMALE:She's just trying to rile us.
SUPFEMALE:These dealers is wily.
LEADMALE:Hit me.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:21 on the nose.
OTHERFEMALE:No fair.
SUPMALE:He can add.
LEADFEMALE:What will you yahoos do? Hit me.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , we got 17.
OTHERMALE:You never hit 17, especially when you're betting five pretzels, understand? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Hit me.
OTHERMALE:10 and bust.
OTHERFEMALE:Too bad, suckers.
SUPMALE:There's a town in the desert with bright lights waiting for you, boy.
SUPMALE:Too bad you're going to the movies, dad.
SUPMALE:The bulls game will be great.
SUPMALE:I'd love to watch the game, but debra winger's coughing up a lung at the cineplex.
LEADFEMALE:In dolby.
LEADMALE:How come we can't ever do anything fun with gary and jackie? Because they're family.
LEADMALE:Did you talk to becky i will.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:You look incredible.
SUPMALE:Really? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Get in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Um what do you know about birth control? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I swear.
LEADMALE:Really.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to be like the talk, right? Here.
LEADMALE:It's easier to squirm sitting down.
LEADMALE:I'm not sleeping with anyone, if that's what you're worried about.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, becky.
SUPMALE:Would you be willing to swear on a bible to make it official? Mom, i know all about birth control.
LEADFEMALE:So then you know about not getting pregnant by jumping up and down afterwards? Brian, let's go shoot some hoops until the game starts.
LEADFEMALE:Can i come? No.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Hey, gary.
LEADMALE:Hey, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Jacks, you and rosie pick another female movie to torture us with? what's wrong, dan? can't handle a little emotion and sensitivity? Oh, yeah, right.
SUPMALE:I love you, but i'm dying.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You can't die because i'm dying.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? what's killing you? A woman's disease.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, me, too.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Like they'd really have the same disease.
LEADFEMALE:Where's roseanne? Kitchen.
OTHERMALE:Giving becky the zero population growth speech.
LEADMALE:Really? Maybe she could use some help.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not bragging, but when it comes to birth control, i've tried to read just about every book on the subject.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Beat it.
LEADMALE:We're talking.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm going to get a glass of water.
SUPFEMALE:I have to go in the store and buy condoms myself? God, how embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to buy them.
LEADMALE:You could use the rhythm method.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, does it work? Ask your brother.
LEADMALE:Thirsty.
OTHERFEMALE:What about the sponge? is that pretty much foolproof? Well, i don't have any statistics on this kind of stuff um-hum.
SUPMALE:But then why not hear it from an expert? You're on, professor jackie.
LEADMALE:Well, if you're sure.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Now, although some of your sponges can help prevent some disease, they're only about 80% effective against pregnancy, so better still is your condom-sponge combo.
LEADMALE:Used correctly, we're talking fort knox security at a price you can afford.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling mom.
SUPFEMALE:But doesn't all that stuff kill the mood? Not as much as a screaming baby with a loaded diaper.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's robert.
LEADMALE:We're through, right? Well, you tell me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm still not going to do anything.
LEADMALE:Well, now that's 100% effective.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Uh mom couldn't talk to us about birth control.
LEADMALE:She couldn't even talk about sex.
LEADMALE:Sex.
OTHERMALE:She told me it was something people did in europe.
LEADMALE:She did try and talk about it once, remember? She said if we let a boy go all the way, then we would be called loose or slutty, like that was going to stop us.
SUPMALE:She should have told us we'd be called mommy.
SUPFEMALE:So what did you tell your girls? what? About having sex.
LEADMALE:You were right there.
LEADFEMALE:You heard what i said.
OTHERFEMALE:That was birth control.
LEADMALE:Same thing.
LEADFEMALE:It is not.
LEADMALE:It is, too.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i'm not talking about mechanics.
SUPFEMALE:I'm talking about when a guy kisses you behind your ear, and you start getting all weird.
LEADFEMALE:These are my daughters you're talking about, jackie.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i'm amazed.
LEADMALE:This isn't like you at all.
LEADMALE:You know who? I am not like mom! Give us a break.
SUPMALE:Jordan's missed three in a row.
LEADFEMALE:It looks like he's pushing the ball.
OTHERFEMALE:He should be popping it.
LEADFEMALE:So he gets more backspin.
LEADFEMALE:Time out.
LEADMALE:Bulls.
SUPFEMALE:Finally.
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Here come the bimbo cheerleaders.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe he's not getting enough arc on the ball.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think, brian? brian? huh? you actually like watching those dancing potato heads? Well, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wow.
SUPMALE:They're all doing splits.
OTHERMALE:Oh, did i say potato heads? I was wrong.
SUPMALE:I must have meant geniuses.
LEADMALE:So, uh, what about the cheerleaders at school? what about them? you think they're pretty? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Some of them.
SUPFEMALE:You won't believe what vicki womack said yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:She said i should try out for cheerleader.
LEADFEMALE:Good one.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:That's what i said.
SUPMALE:I'm not even close to being pretty enough, right? You're just not the right type, that's all.
LEADMALE:I think cheerleaders are stupid.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:Hey, brian.
LEADMALE:What? what was that for? For thinking cheerleaders are stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i don't think they're stupid.
LEADMALE:I think they're complete idiots.
OTHERMALE:That movie was so sad, so warm, so loving.
LEADMALE:I want a beer.
LEADMALE:They're in the trunk.
LEADMALE:Becky's in the front room with a boy.
LEADMALE:Oh becky.
SUPMALE:Darlene? Hi, mommy.
OTHERMALE:Uh, we'd better go.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Are you crazy? Hey, sports fans.
SUPMALE:How was the game? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like to hear the final score.
LEADMALE:The bulls lost, i think.
LEADMALE:What, you guys been wrestling? what did she do, bri, pin you down? Brian, it's been fun watching the game with you, but it's time for you to go home.
SUPMALE:Bye, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:See you at school tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Come back soon, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be upstairs.
LEADMALE:Good night, kiddo.
LEADMALE:What? Dan, they were making out.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Did you notice how her blouse was, uh like it hadn't been on her back the whole night.
SUPMALE:That's great.
SUPMALE:That's just great.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? I want to make sure brian gets home all right.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Some big guy in a truck might plow him over.
LEADMALE:What, did you forget your shotgun? Darlene! Yelling at her won't solve anything.
SUPFEMALE:I want to explain that she's not to touch boys.
SUPMALE:If you do that, she'll have a family of four by the time she graduates.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Go to your room.
SUPFEMALE:It's really not all that bad.
LEADFEMALE:Not now, jackie, all right? I was her age when doug brock got to second base with me.
SUPFEMALE:It was during a football game.
LEADMALE:We were under a big blanket.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, buy me a cup of coffee? I'm helping, gary.
SUPMALE:I'll be at home if you need me.
LEADMALE:Take it easy, dan.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, darlene's 14 years old.
LEADMALE:Well, becky was 14 when she started dating.
LEADFEMALE:Becky's not darlene.
LEADFEMALE:She's not stupid enough to get caught groping on her parents' couch.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean that.
LEADMALE:Darlene's different.
SUPMALE:She plays sports.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she's got a new sport.
LEADFEMALE:You're just all upset because you and darlene are so close.
SUPMALE:I'm close with becky, too.
LEADMALE:You never got upset about becky doing this.
SUPFEMALE:Becky's older.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:It's about the fact that you all watch games on tv together and work in the yard together, and you shoot hoopies out in the driveway.
SUPMALE:Hoopies.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not excited about it either, but it's not the end of the world.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, face it, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Your son is becoming a woman.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How did it go? Great.
SUPMALE:I'm going upstairs and jump up and down now.
OTHERMALE:Good night, becky.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's just you.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:How was your date? Well, he's a great kisser, not that you'd know the difference.
OTHERMALE:Did you get felt up? No.
LEADMALE:I did.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:Me and brian made out tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:What? You never even went out.
LEADFEMALE:So? We played basketball almost every day.
LEADFEMALE:It's not the same thing.
SUPMALE:How do you know he won't tell everybody at school? I told him i'd punch his face in.
LEADFEMALE:That could work.
LEADFEMALE:Mom and dad caught us.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god.
OTHERFEMALE:Did they freak? Not yet.
LEADMALE:So how was it? The kissing was pretty good.
LEADMALE:Well, what about the other stuff? Better than volleyball and yet not quite as good as hockey.
LEADMALE:Look, darlene, you can't be doing this, ok? You got to make guys treat you a certain way.
LEADMALE:You call the shots.
SUPFEMALE:Make them beg, right? Basically.
LEADFEMALE:My dainty daughters.
SUPMALE:Oh, i'm so proud of you.
SUPMALE:How long have you been spying? 15 years.
LEADMALE:I'm getting good, huh? so is it official? am i grounded forever? Why, no.
LEADFEMALE:We're throwing a special debutante party to celebrate this special moment.
SUPMALE:Your dad's on the phone hiring the band.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Torture me, then ground me.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to tell me all about it, lover girl.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:I have a better idea.
SUPFEMALE:Don't tell me, and i'll be surprised when i read your diary.
LEADMALE:You're hysterical.
LEADMALE:So you really go for this dating stuff, huh? I wanted to see what it was like, so i kissed him.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't have to drown my face in mascara like some barbie dolls who shall remain nameless.
OTHERFEMALE:So you really showed becky, huh? That's not why i did it.
SUPMALE:At first, maybe, but then it was different.
OTHERFEMALE:And then, maybe, things went a little too far? Maybe.
LEADMALE:You think he'll ever talk to me again? Well, you did use him like a cheap piece of meat.
SUPMALE:Guys love that.
SUPMALE:What about you and robert? any wedding plans i should know about while your dad's hiring the band? Oh, right.
SUPFEMALE:Like i'll let him pick the music.
SUPMALE:Listen girls.
LEADFEMALE:Sex is something that is not even going to be good until, you know, you're older.
OTHERMALE:Mother.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:We've never really talked about sex, and i think we should discuss it now.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
SUPMALE:Well, ok.
LEADFEMALE:Um well, if you were, to, like, do it now, sure you'd have some pleasure, but it would be a lot better if you're saying we're too young to go all the way.
LEADFEMALE:Your body and your mind have to reach maturity.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You don't want to regret it.
SUPFEMALE:You have to love the guy.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:And, you know you'd like to make sure that you respect him.
SUPMALE:Or it's meaningless.
SUPFEMALE:And he respects you.
SUPMALE:And he respects you.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:It's a beautiful thing.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then.
OTHERMALE:Well, i guess i feel really good about our little chat.
LEADFEMALE:You guys feel good about it? Oh absolutely.
LEADMALE:Definitely.
LEADFEMALE:Definitely.
LEADFEMALE:Well well, that's great, then.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:Ok.
SUPFEMALE:Well, good night, girls.
OTHERMALE:Good night, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you, mom.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.

LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.

SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
OTHERMALE:I don't need a pep talk.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I want to shoot hoopies.
SUPFEMALE:See if you can get by me.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Give it to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll inbound it to you.
LEADMALE:What's inbound? Another word for sucker.
LEADFEMALE:Did you tell darlene about the i told her to slow down.
LEADFEMALE:That all? I told both of them that sex wouldn't be that great till they were, like, 27.
SUPMALE:27? Well, maybe that's just me.
LEADMALE:You were there for me.
SUPMALE:That's all that's important.
SUPFEMALE:No matter what i told them, that can't compare to what they're telling each other.
LEADMALE:Want to make some popcorn and go listen? No.
SUPMALE:You want to watch tv? Bonanza's on.
SUPFEMALE:Nah.
SUPMALE:I'll hang out down here and sink some more, ok? Ok.
SUPMALE:So, dad want to take the bears for a buck? Nah.

LEADMALE:Well, now you're watching this.

SUPMALE:Oh, look.
SUPMALE:It's the spokes-model category.
LEADFEMALE:Yay! Becky, i can't see.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Am i in your way? Well, we got a 19-inch tv, and you got a 25-inch butt.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, guess we'll just have to watch my show.
LEADFEMALE:Guess i'll have to tell mom i was watching first.
LEADFEMALE:You're such a little infant.
SUPFEMALE:You're a pezhead.
LEADMALE:Hey, babe.
LEADFEMALE:How long they been fighting? Let's see.
LEADMALE:Darlene's almost 14 now.

LEADFEMALE:You've been on each other's case for weeks.
LEADMALE:Give it a rest.
OTHERMALE:Mother, she and so did you.
SUPFEMALE:Find something to do.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:And stop calling me mother.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks for your help.
SUPFEMALE:What? you have nothing to say about darlene? Yes.
OTHERMALE:If only she'd use her power for good instead of evil.
OTHERMALE:The thermostat's fixed.
SUPMALE:You just turn this little doodad here, the basement heats up, ready for you to resume your writing career.
LEADMALE:I don't think i'll have time to pursue that career, what with my new job.
SUPMALE:You get that waitress job? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was close, between me and the other woman they hired.
LEADFEMALE:It beats sweeping up at that beauty parlor.

SUPMALE:Come here, woman.
SUPMALE:You done good.
LEADMALE:Well, good, then.
LEADMALE:You must massage my feet now, knave.

LEADFEMALE:Who gets the salisbury steak? I do.
LEADFEMALE:Then you would be the person to ask.
LEADFEMALE:Which one is it? Roseanne! roseanne! Enjoy your, uh, thing.
SUPMALE:We're out of decaf.

LEADMALE:See, you just don't know where to look.
SUPFEMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Now you're out of regular.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hi, becky.
SUPFEMALE:How you doing, honey? Mom, come here.
LEADFEMALE:Come over here.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, could that other woman wait on us? No.
OTHERMALE:For one thing, she's busy.
LEADMALE:Then you'll just sip sodas for an hour and leave her a quarter tip.
SUPMALE:Miss, i'm waiting here.
LEADMALE:Well, just a minute, all right? Go have a seat.
OTHERMALE:I'll be right with you.
LEADFEMALE:Do me a favor.

OTHERMALE:Dad said it's ok.
OTHERMALE:He's ordering pizza at half time.
LEADMALE:There's a meat loaf in the fridge.
LEADMALE:He must've changed his mind.
SUPMALE:Really.
OTHERMALE:Could we order now? You'll eat what i bring you.
SUPFEMALE:Just like him, sitting on his butt watching a game while i kill myself making a meat loaf, this time with real meat.
LEADMALE:Becky seems like a nice kid.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, far as you know.
LEADFEMALE:Having a family must be great.
LEADMALE:Just being married is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Are you a newlywed? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Been married three glorious months.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, me, too.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Come on, how long? 17 years.

SUPMALE:What's going on? i can't live with her anymore! she started throwing things! you two can't live together? Fine! You don't have to.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, you're moving down to the basement.
OTHERMALE:What? are you kidding? I'm sick of this.
SUPMALE:You do nothing but fight.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to live apart.
LEADMALE:What do you think about that? You're the best, dad.
SUPMALE:I'll get my stuff.
LEADFEMALE:And hurry it up! D.j. , go clean up your room.
SUPFEMALE:Why? I'm on a roll.
LEADMALE:I ought to get more kids.
LEADMALE:Hello, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to conner manor, where the children are fed, the dishes are washed, and all is serene.
OTHERMALE:And the bras and the underpants are all over the front yard.
LEADMALE:Most people would have opted for a pink flamingo.
SUPMALE:Oh, that.
SUPFEMALE:A minor skirmish.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have the girls take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:I hear you totally humiliated becky at the mall today.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:This job's going to work out swell.
LEADMALE:What was becky doing eating at the mall anyhow? She didn't want pizza.
LEADFEMALE:What about meat loaf? Nobody wanted meat loaf.
LEADMALE:Couldn't give the stuff away.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going with that? I'm moving down to the basement.
LEADFEMALE:Whose stupid idea's that? Mine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I'll straighten this out.
LEADMALE:The girls wouldn't stop fighting.
LEADFEMALE:I took care of it.
SUPMALE:By separating them? I never would have.
LEADFEMALE:You told me to take charge, i did.
LEADMALE:You going to overrule everything i do? They're never going to talk again.
LEADMALE:Honey.
SUPFEMALE:How can you lay there and stare at the tv? Easy.
LEADMALE:It was quiet until you got home.
SUPMALE:It would have been great having our own rooms.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think we'd be this close.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, we had fun.
SUPMALE:Fun? It was awful.
LEADFEMALE:You used to pour warm water on my blanket.
SUPMALE:I thought i was a bed-wetter till i was 12.
OTHERMALE:You were no perfect sister.
LEADFEMALE:You'd lock the door when i'd stay out late.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy would get up, and he'd talk to me.
OTHERFEMALE:You started that rumor i liked ronny addison.
LEADFEMALE:You did.
OTHERFEMALE:I did not! you're such a liar! It was written all over your diary, "ronny addison, i love him.
SUPFEMALE:" you read my diary? No.
OTHERFEMALE:You read my diary! I have to work.
LEADMALE:Mom, i need your employee discount card.
SUPMALE:I'm trying to work.
SUPMALE:Give me a minute.
LEADMALE:Jackie, can i borrow a credit card? what for? I saw this great stereo system.
SUPMALE:It's 1,000 bucks, so i use mom's id, get 20% off, then return it full price.
SUPMALE:I do that five times, and i can afford the system for real.
LEADMALE:Not bad, huh? Darlene, that's illegal.
SUPMALE:How would you know? what, am i sitting here in a clown suit? Forget about it, darlene.
LEADMALE:Run along.
LEADMALE:We're always going to be poor.
LEADFEMALE:Now, she'd need a receipt for that, right? see? There you go.
SUPMALE:See? see what? Darlene walked right by becky, didn't say nothing.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal? Because normally when she'd walk by, she'd look at becky and she'd go, "hi, geek," and then becky would go, "drop dead, butch.
LEADFEMALE:" they'd have a relationship.
LEADMALE:Did you ever wonder that maybe what's really bugging you is that dan decided to put them in separate rooms, not you? That is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I might be on to something here.
SUPMALE:Somebody else is calling shots on your turf.
LEADFEMALE:You don't like that.
LEADMALE:Damn! I just may make detective yet.
LEADFEMALE:And you also may be the first cop in history to ever pay for a cup of coffee.
LEADMALE:You're hopeless, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:What am i supposed to do, let dan do whatever he wants? do you trust dan? do i have to? Let him do what he thinks is right.
LEADMALE:But what if i just you asked him to take over, so let him! Let somebody else do it.
LEADMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:You always have to be the strong one.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know how to be weak.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You're weak.
LEADFEMALE:Teach me.
LEADMALE:Hi, babe.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, mom.
SUPFEMALE:What's he doing up? We made a deal.
OTHERMALE:D.j. did the dishes.
SUPMALE:I'm letting him stay up.
LEADFEMALE:A deal! Let's go make some coffee.
LEADFEMALE:It will be impossible to get him up, and that's going to ruin my whole day! It'll be ok.
SUPFEMALE:Why would he let d.j. do the dishes? It's covered with filth! breathe! Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i know the dishes are a mess.
SUPMALE:I'll do them.
LEADFEMALE:Now, dan, if d.j. promised you he would do the dishes, when is he ever going to learn? Oh, my god! breathe! I want to go do the dishes.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, let him do it.
LEADMALE:Give dan the power over the dishes.
SUPFEMALE:But he does a lousy job.
LEADFEMALE:You do a lousy job.
LEADMALE:He's going to leave spots! you're going to watch dan do the dishes and not do anything! You understand? want me to dry? I'm going to leave them in the rack to air dry.
SUPMALE:Spots.
LEADFEMALE:Spots.
LEADFEMALE:I can't find blankets.
LEADMALE:Where do you keep them? Ask your father.
OTHERFEMALE:Good, good.
SUPFEMALE:Dad? you going to bed already? bed? I'm doing math.
LEADFEMALE:It's freezing down there.
SUPFEMALE:You didn't come up here because you were cold.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i did.
SUPFEMALE:You're using that as an excuse to go back to your old room, true? No.
SUPMALE:Are you making me move back? I am just over here breathing with aunt jackie.
SUPMALE:You can stay in the basement as long as you want if you want.
SUPMALE:It's kind of lonely down there, and i would move back upstairs, but becky's going to say i miss her and "dweeb dweeb dweeb dweeb.
LEADMALE:" i'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you blame it on me? Tell her i said the basement was too cold.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Anytime.
OTHERMALE:Becky, dad's making me move back.
SUPMALE:Get your crap off my crap! Thank you, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:No applause.
SUPMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Like you planned she would get cold.
LEADMALE:Rosie, rosie, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:She didn't come up here because she's cold.
LEADFEMALE:The basement's heated.
LEADMALE:She needed an excuse to return to her room.
OTHERMALE:I'm surprised you didn't pick up on that, but not everyone can be as perfect a parent as dan conner.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm truly humbled by your magnificence.
OTHERMALE:As am i.
LEADFEMALE:And you know? I think i'll let these dishes wait until the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies.
LEADMALE:I'm amazed, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You stayed back.
SUPMALE:You let dan handle that.
LEADMALE:May i do the dishes? You've earned it.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Oh say, sis.
LEADMALE:You might want to turn the heat in the basement up with that thermostat there.
SUPFEMALE:You little sneak! Thank you, thank you.
LEADMALE:No applause.
LEADFEMALE:Remember how you taught me to put lipstick on? Not on the lips, around the lips, so it wouldn't smear when i got kissed.
SUPFEMALE:God, you were stupid.
LEADFEMALE:I trusted you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you were no angelic little sister yourself.
LEADFEMALE:What did i do? I start going out with dan, and you tell him you're my daughter.
SUPMALE:God, he was stupid.
LEADMALE:And what about your imaginary sister? my imaginary sister? You made her up.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well if she was my imaginary sister, she was your imaginary sister, too.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but she'd only talk to you.
LEADMALE:That's because she hated you, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:It was all i could do to keep her from killing you.
LEADFEMALE:Admit it.
LEADMALE:You were the rottenest sister ever born.
LEADMALE:I don't believe i have to sit here and take that and neither do you, vanessa.
LEADMALE:Very funny.
LEADMALE:Don't say that, vanessa.
LEADMALE:You'll hurt her feelings.
LEADMALE:She likes wearing her hair like that.
SUPMALE:Just grow up, ok? hey! What'd she say about my hair? Spoon
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Get you one of these hogs, gary we're talking about serious freedom.
OTHERMALE:Jackie would love one of these.
LEADMALE:It's not the point.
LEADFEMALE:It's like getting a tattoo.
SUPFEMALE:Even if you've got her name on it, it's not for her.
LEADMALE:Wouldn't it be cheaper to get one of those japanese bikes? No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:You don't want a bike that sounds like barry manilow.
LEADFEMALE:You want one that sounds like steppenwolf.
OTHERMALE:Get on her.
OTHERMALE:See how she feels.
LEADFEMALE:Man, i'm in love.
SUPMALE:Oh, beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:Incredible.
LEADFEMALE:I can still feel it.
LEADFEMALE:It's always like that.
OTHERMALE:Do you guys want, like, a cigarette or anything? we ready to go? Jackie's not even here yet.
SUPMALE:What else is new? Don't go getting all greasy.
SUPFEMALE:This is a very nice restaurant we're going to.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, mom, me and eddie was just goofing off.
OTHERMALE:What a lovely dress, mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Cleaver.
OTHERFEMALE:What time's our reservation for? 10 minutes ago.
SUPMALE:She's always doing this.
LEADMALE:I'll be waiting 45 minutes at the cineplex while she's at the station printing perps.
LEADFEMALE:She actually said that? "printing perps"? She's really into this police lingo.
LEADFEMALE:Every time i go over there, she's either eyeballing a mug shot, grilling a dirt bag, or, uh, frisking a biscuit.
LEADFEMALE:Or spanking a chicken.
SUPMALE:I hate that stupid job.
LEADMALE:Mom, i worked it out with becky.
SUPFEMALE:She'll stay home and baby-sit d.j. , and i'm going out.
LEADMALE:Why would she make a deal like that? I had dirt on her.
LEADMALE:What kind of dirt? If i told you, i'd be staying home.
SUPFEMALE:So, what do you think your punishment ought to be? what do you mean? Darlene told me everything.
LEADMALE:That little rat.
LEADFEMALE:I told her i wouldn't do anything until i got your side of the story.
LEADFEMALE:Well, first we wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:You're getting good.
LEADMALE:If that's jackie, i'll kill her.
LEADMALE:This better not be you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were somebody else.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's me.
SUPMALE:What? what happened? did she get shot? aunt jackie? what, she was shot? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where is she? We'll be right there.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, where's the keys? She got injured in the line of duty.
SUPMALE:Let's get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:How bad is it? They don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? where's my keys? I gave them to you.
SUPFEMALE:I knew this would happen.
LEADMALE:I'll drive.
LEADMALE:Let her be ok.
SUPMALE:Call me when you find out.
SUPFEMALE:This is for the pain.
SUPMALE:Make it a double.
SUPMALE:Jackie? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:She's down here.
LEADMALE:Are you ok? Couldn't find anybody outside.
LEADMALE:What happened? It was a nightmare.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:You just hurt your back.
LEADFEMALE:May i tell the story? Well, it was a 311.
SUPFEMALE:It was on my beat, so i was first to respond.
LEADMALE:When i got to the scene, i realized the alleged perp was heavily intoxicated.
LEADFEMALE:Not only was it a 311, but a 402 as well.
SUPFEMALE:He resisted arrest, and there was a struggle.
OTHERFEMALE:A 979er, and that's when things got ugly.
LEADFEMALE:He went for his gun.
OTHERMALE:What gun? Your partner said the guy was completely naked.
OTHERFEMALE:It was dark.
LEADMALE:It could've been a gun.
LEADMALE:And then they both fell down a flight of steps.
LEADMALE:You tackled some naked guy and fell down the steps with him? Well, that's what they pay me for, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:If we hurry, we can still make it to that restaurant.
LEADMALE:Want to come, jackie? Dan, no.
LEADMALE:I do have a herniated disk.
LEADMALE:Anything we can get for you? No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry i ruined everybody's night.
LEADMALE:We're just glad you're ok.
LEADFEMALE:Know how long you'll be here? A couple of days for observation, then after that, take it easy.
SUPMALE:You know, bed rest, no physical exertion.
OTHERFEMALE:Could i have a minute alone? Now, no physical exertion.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, we'll be right outside listening.
LEADFEMALE:I hate seeing you lying here in pain like this.
SUPMALE:Actually, since she gave me that shot, i'm feeling kind of neat.
SUPMALE:When we got that call said you were hurt, i've never been so scared in my life.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're so sweet.
LEADMALE:No, it's the truth.
LEADFEMALE:With your cute little button nose.
LEADMALE:Um, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, every day when you go to work, i worry you're going to get shot or stabbed.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you ask? Maybe we'll talk about this later.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:I'm ok.
LEADFEMALE:You said shot or stabbed.
SUPFEMALE:This time it didn't happen.
LEADFEMALE:You just fell down the stairs, but here you are in the hospital anyway.
SUPFEMALE:What happens if next time maybe some jerk really does have a gun? I know we've talked about this, but i just don't know if i can handle it anymore.
LEADMALE:What a nice man.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder who he was.
LEADFEMALE:What can't d.j. clean his own room? God, what a pig.
LEADFEMALE:How's aunt jackie going to stand sleeping here? what is this? I think that's his underwear.
LEADMALE:Ooh! Where am i supposed to put this junk? Shove it under the bed.
LEADFEMALE:What are these? Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:What? It's a box full of little heads.
LEADMALE:Barbie.
OTHERMALE:Gi joe.
SUPMALE:Oh, cher.
SUPFEMALE:The little runt is psycho.
LEADMALE:What does he do, cut their heads off and throw away the rest of the parts? No.
SUPFEMALE:This is very creepy, darlene.
SUPMALE:Well, let's just put everything back exactly where it was.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Cleaning.
OTHERMALE:We're just cleaning.
LEADFEMALE:Did you clean my closet? No.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Why? No reason.
LEADMALE:Careful, gary.
LEADFEMALE:You break her, you bought her.
SUPFEMALE:Very funny, roseanne.
SUPMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Just put her down here in the bed.
LEADFEMALE:Easy does it.
LEADMALE:How are you feeling? A little stiff, beck.
LEADFEMALE:Get you anything? No.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:I got it.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, please, stop fussing.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt jackie, i made you a get-well card.
LEADMALE:Oh, deej, look at that.
SUPMALE:Oh, you are such a good kid.
LEADFEMALE:He's got them all fooled.
SUPMALE:I brought the baggage, master.
LEADMALE:Where do you wish me to put it? Just put it anywhere, igor.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, master.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps later you'll hit me? We'll see.
OTHERMALE:You're too kind.
LEADMALE:How you doing? need any magazines? need anything? I'm ok.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I need some rest.
LEADFEMALE:Check with you later.
LEADFEMALE:Gary, is something wrong? No.
SUPMALE:I'm just incredibly late.
LEADMALE:Ok, you guys, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:She needs to be all alone.
LEADMALE:Let's leave her alone.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, can you stay? I wasn't going to go anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:What's up? I found out that because of my back, i could wind up behind a desk.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you poor thing.
LEADMALE:Can i do my little happy dance now? roseanne, how can you? You know how much being a cop means to me.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Nothing's happened yet.
LEADMALE:It happens all the time.
LEADFEMALE:You get hurt, can't work, they send you home.
LEADMALE:I don't know what i'd do.
LEADFEMALE:There's lots of things you could do.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to do anything else.
LEADMALE:People respect me.
LEADMALE:I got to do something that means something, that protects people and helps people, even if it means risking my life.
LEADFEMALE:You tackled a naked guy and grabbed for i could've sworn it was a gun.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? Shopping for motorcycles.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's a pip.
SUPFEMALE:"'78 harley.
OTHERMALE:Mint condition.
LEADMALE:" we can't afford that.
LEADFEMALE:It's for gary.
SUPMALE:Gary and i are planning on forming a gang.
SUPFEMALE:You and your sister will be our chicks.
LEADMALE:Then we plan on going out terrorizing small communities on the weekends, weather permitting.
OTHERMALE:How's jackie? She's a bit better, but i don't think she should leave until she can take care of herself.
SUPMALE:You really enjoy this nurturing crap.
LEADFEMALE:Do not.
LEADMALE:Do, too.
LEADFEMALE:You've been real happy the last few days, having somebody to take care of.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it is cool, having somebody depend on me to feed them, take them to the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Besides you, that is.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, if d.j. was doing something weird i don't mean normal weird, i mean really weird we'd have to send him away, right? Yeah, but he'd probably find his way back, like you always do.
LEADMALE:What's going on? He's doing something really weird.
OTHERMALE:I'm so tired of it.
LEADFEMALE:It's really, really boring.
OTHERFEMALE:Every time he does anything, you come squawking about it.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't do things the way you do.
SUPFEMALE:He does them differently.
LEADMALE:He's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:Real different.
SUPMALE:Looks like d.j. got himself a hobby.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, these are my old dolls.
OTHERMALE:He's not playing with dolls, is he? Oh, that's a relief.
LEADFEMALE:Do you guys think this is insane? Well, this one does kind of look like darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like she put up quite a little struggle.
LEADMALE:You guys are sick.
SUPMALE:Take them back where you got them.
LEADMALE:Mother! It's no big deal.
LEADMALE:He's a boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Boys do things like this.
LEADFEMALE:Go find something to do.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, when we finally lock the wacko up, don't expect me to change his papers.
LEADMALE:Dan, when you were d.j. 's age, you did stuff like that, right? No.
LEADMALE:The boy's odd.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, bud.
SUPMALE:I got you a bike.
LEADMALE:Hey, great.
OTHERMALE:We'll check it out this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Now you need a good, tough biker nickname.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:How about psycho? No.
OTHERFEMALE:We're saving that for d.j. i'm going to see jackie.
LEADFEMALE:How is she? She's laying up in bed complaining.
OTHERMALE:I'm used to that.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Gary.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you feeling? You tell me.
LEADMALE:Well, that was fun.
LEADFEMALE:These are for you.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Gary, what's wrong? Ever since my accident, we haven't talked.
SUPMALE:Well, um i'm going to buy that harley.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:And, um, things have been real busy at work.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen.
LEADFEMALE:You remember hank who has a sign shop next to me? His secretary is leaving at the end of this month.
SUPMALE:Gary.
LEADFEMALE:It's a great job.
LEADFEMALE:I have a job.
LEADFEMALE:Just think about it.
LEADFEMALE:You knew i was a cop when we started dating.
LEADMALE:But i always thought you thought i would give it up.
OTHERMALE:It was just a phase.
LEADMALE:Now she's a cop, next month maybe a cowgirl.
LEADFEMALE:You got hurt.
LEADFEMALE:So, just say, "i told you so.
LEADMALE:" no.
LEADMALE:I can't live like this.
LEADFEMALE:Forget the fact you're never home.
SUPMALE:We can't make plans because you don't know what your day will be like.
LEADMALE:I can't relate to your friends 'cause all you do is talk cop talk.
SUPMALE:I'll be damned if i'm getting a call saying that my wife is in some hospital.
LEADMALE:I have to give up something i want because you can't deal with it.
LEADMALE:Isn't that a wee bit selfish? That's how i feel.
LEADMALE:I won't let you run my life.
SUPMALE:That won't change.
LEADFEMALE:I won't sit around waiting for that call.
SUPMALE:We're saying we're breaking up? Just say you won't be a cop anymore and this all goes away.
SUPFEMALE:Don't sell the bike.
OTHERFEMALE:My buddy really wants it.
SUPMALE:We will be there.
OTHERFEMALE:Soon.
SUPFEMALE:Gary, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, leave him alone.
LEADMALE:He's probably kissing it and making it better.
LEADMALE:We'll lose the bike.
OTHERMALE:I can't deal with that now.
LEADMALE:I got to go.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter, you guys have another fight? It was more than just a fight, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what? It's between her and me.
LEADMALE:It's a problem we've been having from the beginning.
SUPFEMALE:It's private, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:Jackie will tell me.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds bad.
SUPFEMALE:It's over.
LEADMALE:Aw, man.
LEADMALE:Well, these things happen.
SUPMALE:We're still going to do this bike thing, right? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Definitely.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll give me a buzz? Absolutely.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, gary.
LEADFEMALE:Huh, yeah? Take care of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You, too, dan.
SUPFEMALE:How could you do that without even discussing it with me? He's not your boyfriend.
SUPMALE:This guy's great.
OTHERMALE:Those irritating things you do, he thinks they're cute.
LEADFEMALE:He walked in here, and he gave me an ultimatum.
LEADMALE:He told me to quit the force.
OTHERMALE:I've been telling you that since you started.
SUPMALE:And i've tried to break up with you, but you won't go.
LEADMALE:Becoming a cop is something i worked very hard for.
LEADMALE:What would you do if dan demanded you leave the house and the kids? Ok.
SUPMALE:Bad example.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what i'd do.
LEADFEMALE:I'd work it out.
OTHERMALE:There's nothing to work out.
LEADMALE:I'm quitting.
LEADFEMALE:What? They said i'd have to take a desk job.
SUPFEMALE:I'm didn't become a cop to sit on my butt typing.
LEADMALE:All you did was sit on your butt drinking coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but i had a radio and a car.
SUPMALE:Now you're doing exactly what gary wants you to do.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I'm doing what i want to do.
LEADFEMALE:It's the same thing that gary wants.
LEADFEMALE:Let's rent a chapel and finish it.
LEADFEMALE:He'd think i quit because he told me to.
LEADFEMALE:But you would know the truth! Let him live in ignorance.
SUPMALE:Men love that! I'm going to do exactly what you'd do.
LEADFEMALE:You would never let a man run your life.
LEADMALE:I want somebody to support me no matter what.
LEADFEMALE:Like dan does for you.
LEADFEMALE:Are you insane? you think he came out of a box like that? You could put those same years into gary.
LEADMALE:He's perfect for you.
LEADFEMALE:No, roseanne, he's perfect for you.
OTHERMALE:You want him to take care of your flaky sister so you won't have to worry.
LEADFEMALE:That's ok! you won't have to worry, because she's going to be just fine! Ok, so maybe maybe you did the right thing.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:God, i hate that.
SUPMALE:Oh, roseanne no, i really, really hate that, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:So it's been kind of a tough day for you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Feel like crying some more? No.
LEADFEMALE:Want to yell at me? No.
LEADFEMALE:Want a pizza? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Extra cheese? Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:Pepperoni? Mm-hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:Sausage? anchovies? No man is worth anchovies.
LEADMALE:Why do you want to go home so soon? It's been a week.
LEADFEMALE:10 days.
LEADMALE:I'll put these in the car.
SUPMALE:I'll miss you, too, dan.
LEADMALE:You sure you want to go? There's nobody there to take care of you.
LEADMALE:It's just a cramped little hole of an apartment.
LEADMALE:You're depressing me.
LEADMALE:Well, if you're depressed, you really shouldn't go.
LEADMALE:It's time that i get on with my life.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you going to do? Disability pension's coming in.
LEADFEMALE:There's time to try stuff i've always wanted to do.
LEADMALE:Like what? I'm not telling you.
SUPMALE:Every time i try something new, you make fun of it, like becoming a cop.
LEADFEMALE:You don't lay off.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i'm not going to do anything like that.
LEADFEMALE:You can tell me.
SUPMALE:I will totally support whatever you choose.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:I was thinking of trying something kind of artistic, like being a painter or a sculptor.
LEADMALE:I could join that community theater.
OTHERMALE:I could be an actor.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, or you could be a ballerina.
LEADMALE:Want to be a ballerina? Or you could be an astronaut and fly way up high into outer space.
SUPMALE:Thank you for the support.
LEADFEMALE:You could be a kick-boxer.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:A sumo wrestler.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:No a psychic.
LEADFEMALE:But then you knew that, didn't you?
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Uhh.
LEADFEMALE:Ow.
LEADFEMALE:Uhh, not now, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, but hurry up.
LEADMALE:This mattress is killing me.
LEADMALE:I've got a spring right in my back.
LEADMALE:So move.
LEADFEMALE:I tried that.
LEADFEMALE:Try again.
SUPMALE:Switch sides with me, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:I got to get some sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I can't sleep with your hot nostril air blowing all over me.
SUPMALE:Well, turn over.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:Ohh.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm still not happy.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Help me flip the mattress over.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You got to get up.
LEADMALE:You didn't tell me that was part of it.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! We need to get a new bed.
LEADFEMALE:You mean a brand new bed? No.
LEADFEMALE:One some old person died in.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk about it tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:Dan now you're all comfy 'cause i got the spring on my side now.
LEADFEMALE:All right, but hurry up.
LEADFEMALE:Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:Ahem.
SUPMALE:Stop it.
SUPFEMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:I mean it.
SUPFEMALE:I mean it.
LEADFEMALE:Cut it out.
LEADFEMALE:Cut it out.
OTHERMALE:Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? It's d.j. it's d.j. i'll kill him.
LEADMALE:I'll kill him.
SUPFEMALE:What's he doing? Mom.
SUPMALE:Mom.
OTHERMALE:Darlene's saying everything d.j. says a second before he says it.
SUPMALE:God, that's so immature.
LEADFEMALE:He's driving me crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Something might happen to him.
LEADFEMALE:Happen to him.
SUPMALE:Darlene, ever try banging your head hard against the table? Maybe he'll knock himself out.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:You're dead.
LEADMALE:You're dead.
LEADMALE:Whoo.

LEADFEMALE:What if my manly abilities aren't really mine? what if it's the mattress? I thought it was the mattress.
SUPFEMALE:What if i can't wow you in a new bed? You didn't have no trouble when we brought home that new kitchen table.
SUPMALE:True.
SUPFEMALE:If anybody cares, d.j. 's head fits really well in the toilet.
LEADFEMALE:See, dan? D.j. is small for his age.

LEADFEMALE:Mark is the greatest guy i've ever dated! you don't like him, and you're just taking it out on me! I remember a time when she was so sweet and innocent and loving.
SUPMALE:I remember that, too.
OTHERMALE:I believe it was a thursday.
SUPFEMALE:Listen to this one.
SUPMALE:"i sometimes get tiny red pimples on my buttocks "in the summer.
OTHERFEMALE:What can i do about them?" that's gross.
SUPMALE:I hope you didn't sign your name this time.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I signed your name.
OTHERMALE:What did it say to do? Use a healing facial mask.
SUPMALE:Ok, i'm going to pick up that bed before the store closes.
OTHERMALE:Hey, honey.
LEADMALE:On your way back, pick us up two healing facial masks for our butts.
LEADMALE:For our butts.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, i won't be in for dinner.
LEADMALE:I'm going over judy's.
LEADMALE:Get a ride from your dad.
SUPFEMALE:That's ok.
LEADFEMALE:I can walk.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:What are you guys going to do? Probably just going to the movies.
LEADMALE:There's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe me and jackie will go see something.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we don't really know if we're going to the movies.
LEADMALE:Call me when you're at judy's and let us know either way.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You know what? I forgot my wallet.
SUPFEMALE:Well, there it is.
LEADFEMALE:She's going to see mark.
SUPFEMALE:The old "going over to my girlfriend's house" routine.
LEADMALE:She's probably up there right now working on plan b.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's a really dumb story, like "judy's parents are amish and don't have a phone.
SUPMALE:" i was only 11.
LEADMALE:Mom, me and judy are just going to a party, ok? Ok.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Uh is mark going to be at this party? Mom, you told me never to see him again.
LEADFEMALE:Is that yes or no? No.
OTHERMALE:Where's the party? I'm not sure.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call you later and give you the number.
SUPFEMALE:We could drive you over there.
LEADMALE:We're bored.
SUPMALE:We may not go to this party.
LEADFEMALE:We'll probably just invite some girls over to judy's.
LEADFEMALE:And she goes for the save.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Oh, becky.
LEADMALE:Yeah? um judy's phone number's up there on the bulletin board, right? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Have fun.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Well there she goes.
SUPFEMALE:Are you worried? Of course i'm worried.
LEADMALE:You want to talk about it? what's to talk about? She's out with someone we hate, going god knows where and doing god knows what.
LEADFEMALE:Now i feel like mom felt when she had to watch you completely destroy your life.
OTHERFEMALE:You having fun there, dan? Just breaking her in.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's time to call judy again.
SUPMALE:Well, it's been 15 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, judy.
OTHERMALE:It's mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Last time i called, i forgot to ask becky something.
LEADMALE:She's in the bathroom again? well, is she sick? Maybe we should pick her up.
SUPMALE:Ok, i'll call back later then.
LEADMALE:Becky's sick? No.
LEADMALE:She's with mark.
LEADFEMALE:What? We told her she couldn't see him again.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why she lied about being at judy's.
OTHERMALE:You let her go? I had to so i could catch her.
LEADMALE:I won't sit here while she's out with that punk.
OTHERMALE:I call judy every 15 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Judy calls becky wherever she is.
LEADMALE:Then becky calls me.
LEADFEMALE:And the point of that is? To completely ruin becky's evening.
OTHERMALE:See? And to make sure that she's all right.
SUPFEMALE:Hiya, becky.
LEADMALE:You like pork chops, don't you? Ok then.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:She's fine.
LEADMALE:Judy, when you finally do hear from her, tell her to get her butt home.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Let her live with him.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it, judy.
LEADMALE:You're never leaving this house again.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? so how was your evening? Ok, you know i wasn't at judy's.
LEADMALE:Oh? I was at monica's.
LEADFEMALE:I know you hate her, so i asked judy to cover.
LEADMALE:That's one.
LEADMALE:Where were you? I told you i was at monica's.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Her parents weren't home.
OTHERMALE:I knew you guys would be mad.
LEADMALE:That's two.
LEADMALE:Two what? Two weeks grounded.
LEADMALE:You want three, or do we hear "mark"? You lied, and that won't happen ever again.
SUPFEMALE:You're never seeing mark again.
SUPFEMALE:I mean it, becky! I know.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:Thanks to my mother, who made me call her every 15 minutes, he'll probably never want to see me again anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Probably? and what if he probably does? I'm never going to see him again.
LEADFEMALE:Ok? Ever.
LEADFEMALE:You put us through a lot of crap tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Can i go now? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Get upstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:You did good.
OTHERMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:I did.
LEADMALE:You knew exactly where she was going to be.
LEADMALE:And you stayed one step ahead of her.
SUPFEMALE:Was there ever any doubt, dan? I'm the best.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, next time, i'm going to have to be even better.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:Ahh.
OTHERMALE:Not too hard? not too soft? Just right.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, dan.
SUPMALE:Just because becky's not going to see mark anymore doesn't mean that she's ever going to date somebody that we approve of.
LEADFEMALE:The next guy could be, like, an ax murderer.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:Let me out.
OTHERMALE:I promise i won't see becky again.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no air in here.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:1 a niner to marvin, possible straight, another duck for the monsignor, zippo, and shinola for the dealer.

LEADMALE:Did i tell you guys about my cousin leon? He bought two mail-order brides through a catalogue.
LEADMALE:Ups delivered them to his door buck naked.
LEADMALE:They both looked like michelle pfeiffer, except they had really big heads.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, who wants to chip in for arnie's therapy? He's paying me for that story.
LEADFEMALE:I told you about me dating that belly dancer, right? Oh, listen to this.
SUPFEMALE:This chick had such muscle control, she could pick up hey, honey.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, d.j. hi, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Can i try on my halloween costume, mom? Well, hey, go knock yourself out.
LEADFEMALE:So what were you all saying? Oh, yeah, i'd, uh you could use a cross-cut saw on that, but i'd use a band saw, 'cause it's a lot easier.
LEADFEMALE:You look like a band saw man.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you better use your coasters.
LEADMALE:Ha, made you look.
SUPFEMALE:Power tools.
LEADMALE:That's their little code for "fallopians approaching.
LEADFEMALE:" like we don't know what goes on when we leave that room.
SUPFEMALE:They talk about their first time, their last time, and how many times.
LEADFEMALE:Then they multiply it by five and spit at each other and go home.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder why.
LEADMALE:We're talking about the only animal on earth that would wear black socks with bermuda shorts.
SUPFEMALE:Now, we put on our little ears.
LEADFEMALE:Why do i have to do this? Because her needs a halloween costume.
LEADMALE:I don't want to go to dan's stupid lodge stupid haunted house thing.
LEADFEMALE:But it's for charity.
OTHERFEMALE:But it's no fun having some 60-year-old guy with a pot belly jumping at me saying "ooga booga.
LEADMALE:" it was scarier now than when i was 8.
OTHERMALE:I want to see you get out there again.
LEADMALE:I just broke up with gary.

LEADMALE:That is stupid.
SUPFEMALE:I got to get back in there.

LEADMALE:I'm going to mingle.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't.
SUPMALE:Don't.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not serious.
LEADFEMALE:Me and the guys, we're going to hang out.
SUPFEMALE:You got a problem with that, babe? Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Um, you know, you could do much better.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see you here with anybody.
LEADMALE:You're kidding me? Honest to god.
OTHERMALE:This broad was so hot, i thought she was going to kill me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Badda-bing badda-boom.
LEADFEMALE:So then, she brings out this suitcase full of sex toys, and i'm thinking, this broad is freaky.
LEADFEMALE:As long as you're getting your battery charged, what's the damn difference? While you're getting your car washed, you might as well get the hot wax.
LEADFEMALE:I want to know what she wants with you when she's got a suitcase full of sex toys.
LEADFEMALE:That supposed to be a joke? Ok.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, anyway we were going pretty good, and i was catching my groove, doing what makes me me, and then her roommate walks in and says, "can i join you?" are you kidding me? Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, way to go! Then her roommate takes off all her clothes, and i got both of them to deal with.
LEADMALE:Hold on a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Let me ask you a question.
LEADFEMALE:Are you making this stuff up as you go along? you calling me a liar? No.
SUPMALE:Badda-boom badda-bing.

LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:What? Oh, man.
LEADMALE:What? Man, it was awesome.
OTHERFEMALE:It reminds me of that movie where that lady hung out with the gorillas, but they accept her as one of their own.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:What did they talk about? Well, ok, the head gorilla, he's like standing around telling these sex stories, and the less dominant gorillas are just standing around believing it.
LEADFEMALE:What's so new about that? I think i figured out why they do it.
LEADMALE:Do tell.
LEADMALE:If one of them has sex, it seems like the rest have a chance, too.
LEADFEMALE:So you think that's it? It gives them a feeling of hope and pride.
LEADFEMALE:Order me another beer.
LEADMALE:Why? where are you going? I'm going to the men's room.
SUPMALE:No, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Don't go in there.
LEADMALE:Don't do it.

LEADMALE:How you doing, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Thompson? Hi, girls.
OTHERMALE:This is even lamer than last year.

OTHERMALE:Which one are you referring to? The cute one.
OTHERFEMALE:This is just great.
OTHERFEMALE:Rosie called.
LEADMALE:Her car broke down.
OTHERMALE:She and jackie need to be picked up at the lobo.
LEADMALE:Aw, man.

SUPMALE:Give it up, dan.
LEADMALE:The kid's a witch.
LEADFEMALE:Andy, you got three boys.
LEADMALE:This is a phase, right? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:The kid hits a certain age, he does weird stuff.
SUPMALE:I think d.j. 's hiding.
LEADFEMALE:I probably traumatized him.
LEADFEMALE:He just wanted a broom so he could pretend to fly.
SUPFEMALE:That probably means he wants to be a pilot.
SUPMALE:You can't turn everything he does into a career.
LEADFEMALE:It means more to you than to him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but some kid might deck him.
LEADMALE:We were kids.
OTHERFEMALE:We survived, right? Look at us now.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
SUPMALE:D.j. ? dad? d.j. where you been, boy? Scaring people.

SUPFEMALE:You mad at me? Nah.
OTHERMALE:You mad at me? Nah.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go get you a broom.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Whenever my old lady gives me crap about equality, i just tell her, you're so equal, let's see you pee on a campfire.
LEADMALE:Hey, uh, bob, looks like your old lady just found a new fireman.
LEADMALE:Well, we got an open relationship.
LEADFEMALE:That 'cause you can't keep her in line? Well, it's harder to control a woman who ain't inflatable.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, bitch! You're making me look bad in front of the other guys.
SUPFEMALE:I don't see any ring on this finger.
LEADMALE:Hi, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Hi crystal? what are you doing here? I'm here to drown my sorrows.
LEADMALE:Get me a pink squirrel.
OTHERMALE:Keep them coming.
LEADFEMALE:I had a terrible date, and it's my fault.
LEADMALE:I could have ordered chicken, which was reasonably priced, but i had to have the surf and turf, signaling i owed him something.
LEADMALE:When i was not accommodating, he dumped me.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop blaming yourself for everything.
LEADMALE:You got a right to eat without letting some guy put you on the menu.
OTHERMALE:You're better than that.
LEADFEMALE:Really? You got to tell yourself you're a quality woman and stop judging yourself according to what men think.
LEADFEMALE:What's your name? don't you recognize me? Well, refresh my memory.
LEADMALE:Where might we have met? at roseanne's house? roseanne? Trick or treat.
LEADMALE:Well, of course, i knew it was you.
OTHERMALE:No, you didn't.
LEADFEMALE:I was playing along.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You were ready to sleep with me.
LEADMALE:I was going to make you buy me dinner first.

SUPMALE:You've been in my face all night.
SUPMALE:Just take a hike.
SUPFEMALE:Who's going to make me? Yeah, that's real grown up.
LEADMALE:Fight about it.

LEADMALE:Got to stay out all day.
SUPMALE:Minimize the damage.
LEADFEMALE:Get far away from ground zero.
SUPMALE:Getting too old for this.
LEADFEMALE:The horror.
LEADFEMALE:The horror.
LEADMALE:Shh! shh! Before dan gets up, let's go over the plans for his surprise party.
OTHERFEMALE:Crystal, what do you have to report? I want to thank you for having me do decorations.
OTHERMALE:You're quite welcome.
OTHERMALE:And, in light of our $40 budget, i have decided upon balloons and stupid hats.
LEADFEMALE:Good choice.
OTHERMALE:And now can we hear from the cake committee? two "p"s in happy, right? how are you going to get dan down there, roseanne? I'll say, "it's all-you can-eat-night at the lodge.
LEADFEMALE:You got to defend your crown.
LEADFEMALE:" so what should we do? You help crystal with decorations.
SUPMALE:Darlene, i don't care if you want to go or not, you're going.
LEADMALE:I hate these parties.
LEADFEMALE:No kid should have to watch their parents do the hully-gully.
OTHERFEMALE:Not for the squeamish.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, dad.
LEADMALE:Crystal, let's get out to those garage sales.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you can always find a bargain.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, where you going? Fishing.

LEADFEMALE:It is? Happy birthday, dan.
OTHERMALE:Forget my birthday.
SUPMALE:Do i have to spell it out? P-m-s.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my god! Are you sure? 17 years, every 28 days.
LEADMALE:Yes, i'm sure.
LEADMALE:I don't know, dan.
LEADMALE:Roseanne seems perfectly pleasant today.
SUPFEMALE:When have you ever known roseanne to be perfectly pleasant? I'm at the mall.
SUPMALE:I got basketball practice.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:No, no! hold on! It'll be a 24-hour roller coaster ride with sybil at the switch.
LEADFEMALE:When my hormones act up, i'm good for one solid day of pure mean.
LEADFEMALE:Once i busted a street light for every man who ever broke my heart.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i remember the great blackout of '84.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, wait.
LEADMALE:You can't leave.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't let go, i'm prepared to gnaw my own arm off.
LEADMALE:Dan! dan! Roseanne's got a big surprise party planned for you down at the lodge.
SUPFEMALE:There's going to be like 50 people there.
LEADMALE:No, it can't be.
SUPMALE:Now, dan, don't worry.
LEADMALE:Roseanne does not have pms today.
LEADMALE:Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you think i'm pretty? I'm out of here! Ok.
LEADMALE:So far, so good.
LEADFEMALE:Dan's out working in the garage, out of the line of fire.
SUPMALE:Dan! dan, you in there? yeah! What are you doing? Fixing this thing here.
LEADFEMALE:It's hair.
LEADFEMALE:Hair is different.
LEADMALE:Do i like it? what if she doesn't? got to say something before don't you like my hair? Too late.
LEADFEMALE:I love it! I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:I do something to make myself a little more attractive to you, and you don't even notice.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't do this for myself.
LEADFEMALE:I can't even see the hair on my head.
SUPMALE:God, you men! You're taking me and the kids to the lodge at 5:00, and that's it.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't care if it is your birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:5:00! He doesn't suspect a thing.
SUPFEMALE:I tricked him into going, but no, he just thinks it's another normal birthday dinner.
LEADMALE:Mom, you're ironing the towels? i can't wait around for you to do it, can i? stay away from those towels! i have to refold them! Why don't you go put on your pretty pink dress with the little flowers on it? the pink dress? the one i had on first? And tell your sister to hurry up.
SUPMALE:This whole family would fall apart if i wasn't here.
LEADMALE:You're wearing that one? No.
LEADFEMALE:And hurry up! i'm starving! This whole surprise party thing sure seemed a lot better last week.
LEADFEMALE:Whose stupid idea was this, anyway? I know it was.
LEADFEMALE:Don't throw it in my face.
SUPFEMALE:Don't patronize me, crystal! If you're going to have that kind of attitude, don't come if you don't want to.
LEADMALE:You want to, don't you? It wouldn't be a party without you.
OTHERMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Aah! You know, dan, i've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i ought to take some night school classes like creative writing, word processing, or something like that.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I'm supposed to say something here.
LEADFEMALE:Let's try sounds good, honey.
LEADMALE:Maybe i should really join an aerobics class and try to get in shape.
LEADMALE:I could do both, but i'd never be home.
SUPMALE:What do you think? Um oh, you look like the perfect little gentleman.
LEADMALE:Let's see your hands.
SUPMALE:They're filthy.
SUPFEMALE:You wash them.
OTHERMALE:You ought to wash your hands, too, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this tie! I've always loved this tie.
SUPFEMALE:The green and stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I'll change into my green dress so we'll match! Stay away from those clean towels.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan? Save yourself.
LEADMALE:I kind of want to apologize to you 'cause, well, i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I know i've been a little excitable today.
SUPFEMALE:Hadn't really noticed, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Know what i asked darlene to do? Catalog all my coupons according to expiration date and the four food groups.
OTHERFEMALE:Then i began this letter to my third grade best friend.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't had her address for something like 20 years! That's ok, honey.
SUPMALE:You get whacked out every now and then.
LEADMALE:What's your point, dan? I really don't have a point.
SUPFEMALE:Say it because i know what you're thinking.
LEADMALE:You think i have pms.
SUPFEMALE:No, i wasn't thinking that, but i have been reading on it lately.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know they have pills that supposedly help if you did have pms.
LEADMALE:A pill? a pill! you want me to take a pill? do they have a pill for you, dan? Oh! We're going to be late for roseanne's surprise party.
LEADMALE:It's my surprise party, jackie, and why didn't you stop her? I hate surprise parties.
LEADFEMALE:The only people having fun are the people who were in on it.
LEADMALE:You're in on it.
LEADMALE:Can we go so we can get home? is she changing into another outfit? Or another personality.
LEADMALE:Let's just enjoy our one moment of peace.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, get in here! I love you, daddy.
LEADMALE:You're going in.
SUPFEMALE:Could be a suicide mission.
LEADFEMALE:Stay low.
LEADFEMALE:Stay low.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPMALE:You'll get through this.
LEADFEMALE:Somewhere your real wife waits for you.
LEADMALE:Come here, you big sexy man.
LEADMALE:That's not her.
OTHERMALE:Of course you don't have to tell your real wife.
LEADMALE:We're out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Jeez, what were you guys doing in there? Never mind.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Honey, come on.
LEADFEMALE:We're almost going to be real late.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going.
LEADMALE:Ok, ok, look, we've been through this before.
LEADMALE:We know she's got 100 different personalities.
OTHERFEMALE:We've seen them all.
SUPMALE:How can i go when we're destroying the ozone layer? Kids, i want you to remember this.
LEADMALE:Pms is serious stuff.
SUPFEMALE:It causes depression, anxiety, physical pain.
LEADFEMALE:And it's rough on your mother, too.
LEADMALE:Listen, everybody, i'm going to check if our table's ready.
LEADMALE:You wait for me.
OTHERMALE:Hey, now, nobody eats the food, got it? Now, get around the door here and be really, really quiet.
OTHERMALE:Then when dan comes in, just yell surprise.
LEADFEMALE:You know how, right? Our table's ready.
LEADMALE:Surprise! surprise! For he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow come on.
OTHERMALE:I'm starving.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's eat.
LEADMALE:Isn't this great, dan? All your friends came.
LEADMALE:It's great, roseanne.
LEADMALE:How did you do this without me knowing? you really were surprised, weren't you? are you kidding? when i you know, dan, we should have a song, shouldn't we? Then, whenever we hear it, we'd go, that's our song.
OTHERFEMALE:Did i invite you? Eddie, eddie, hi.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? Oh, ok.
LEADFEMALE:You're all right then.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i love your hair.
LEADFEMALE:See, dan.
SUPMALE:So, what do you think, roseanne? about what? The decorations.
LEADFEMALE:I planned this very carefully.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you didn't realize there are exactly 40 balloons here.
LEADMALE:40? Dan is 39, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm sorry, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I got him one to grow on.
LEADFEMALE:You needn't apologize to me.
LEADFEMALE:Apologize to dan for ruining his party! There he goes.
OTHERMALE:Hey, this ought to be our song.
OTHERMALE:Play it again.
SUPMALE:I'm pooped.
LEADMALE:I'm sitting.
OTHERMALE:You're no fun.
SUPFEMALE:Come dance with me, sis.
LEADMALE:Nah please? don't you think the party's going real good? The party's going great.
SUPFEMALE:Dan's having a good time, don't you think? are you kidding? What we have to remember is, she's a wonderful woman when her estrogen isn't whipping her into a psychotic frenzy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Like when i sprained my ankle, she was there.
SUPMALE:And when i got ditched at the dance.
OTHERMALE:And when your parents separated, dan.
LEADMALE:She was there.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's face it she's bad luck.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go see if mom left any chocolate on the dessert table.
SUPFEMALE:Need anything, dan? Menopause.
LEADFEMALE:And there's some damn good-looking guys here tonight.
SUPMALE:Ah, get off.
OTHERFEMALE:It's been almost a month since gary dumped you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, i dumped gary.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Now here you are at some crummy party dancing with your sister.
LEADMALE:It breaks my heart to see you like this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine! You don't have to yell.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one person that loves you most.
SUPMALE:Roseanne! If you weren't my sister, i just don't know who would be.
LEADMALE:Having fun? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You're probably wondering where nancy is.
LEADMALE:Who's nancy? We had a fight.
SUPFEMALE:She said she paid for everything.
LEADMALE:She kicked me out.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm living in my car.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it's her car.
SUPFEMALE:I guess poker night at your place is out.
SUPFEMALE:Why? singing telegram for dan conner! What's that? Me and the guys got together to say happy birthday.
SUPMALE:Well, hello there, birthday boy.
LEADMALE:Yeah! yeah! whoo! whoo! whoo! whoo! yeah! out! well, uh out! out! out! out! out! out! you are the reason why there will never be a woman president! Whose idea was this? I might have known.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie.
SUPMALE:I blame you for it, dan.
LEADMALE:I might have expected it from your slimy friends, but not from the father of my children.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, dear.
LEADFEMALE:As if that makes everything ok.
SUPFEMALE:That poor woman was only trying to do her job and has been made to feel like dirt.
OTHERMALE:I have to go comfort her, thanks to you! Mental note kill arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, dan, dan! she's making people do the limbo! You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:It's your shift.
LEADMALE:It's my birthday.
SUPMALE:There are no birthdays in hell.
LEADFEMALE:Go before somebody's hurt.
SUPFEMALE:Give me a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:I just realized i'm 39 years old.
LEADFEMALE:39.
SUPFEMALE:Next year, i'll be 40.
SUPFEMALE:40.
LEADFEMALE:That's almost middle-aged.
SUPFEMALE:What have i done with my life? oh, cut the introspective crap and get in there! Why do i have to put up with this every month? So she's got hormones.
SUPMALE:Why should she just get away with it? when is it my turn? when will everybody tiptoe around me? when do i get pms? better now? Yeah, i'm good.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:We're just about ready to open the presents.
LEADFEMALE:Presents.
LEADMALE:That that's almost the end, right? No.
OTHERMALE:Cake.
LEADMALE:Come on, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Gather around.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan's going to open his presents now.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Look, everybody! Aw.
SUPMALE:Aw.
LEADFEMALE:It's a little clown.
LEADMALE:D.j. made it himself.
LEADFEMALE:It's a macaroni thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, look, honey.
LEADFEMALE:He even spelled out "dad" using little, tiny spaghetti-os.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, and you said he had no talent.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see what's inside this one, huh? Hang in there, champ.
SUPMALE:Only a couple more rounds to go.
SUPFEMALE:You're doing fine.
OTHERMALE:Can i have your attention? I'd like to propose a toast to my husband, so everybody hold up your glasses.
SUPFEMALE:Higher.
SUPFEMALE:For you, dan conner, my husband, my best friend, the father of these children.
LEADFEMALE:You are the ink in my pen.
LEADFEMALE:You are the paper on which i write.
LEADMALE:We've been married for 17 years.
SUPFEMALE:We've had many wonderful times.
SUPFEMALE:We've had many, many bad times.
LEADFEMALE:Happy birthday, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Hear, hear.
LEADMALE:Hear, hear.
LEADFEMALE:Like when we sawol' yeller and you cried.
LEADFEMALE:You made me promise i'd never tell anybody, and i never have, and i never will.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, dear.
LEADMALE:So here's to you, dan conner, my husband, my soul mate, my friend, my rock god, please let this be over.
SUPMALE:A big rock on my couch that does nothing but watch tv.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:God's a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Occasionally, it'll ask for a beer, and i have to get it because it's just a rock.
SUPFEMALE:A rock can't roll over to the refrigerator, so i have to get the beer for it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, a big tv-watching, beer-drinking rock but he's my rock, and i must live with it.
LEADMALE:So happy birthday, dan! happy birthday, dan! Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday, dear dan happy birthday to you make a wish, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! all right, dan! Happy birthday.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Yes! i got my wish! Happy birthday, dan.
OTHERMALE:My birthday was yesterday, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I know, but we forgot to do your traditional birthday breakfast.
LEADMALE:What's it going to be, pancakes, waffles, an omelet? Nothing's too good for my man.
SUPMALE:I think i'll just go to the bedroom, read the paper, not talk to a soul.
LEADMALE:Is that ok with you, roseanne? God, he gets so damn moody.
OTHERMALE:Happens every month, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hmpfh, men!
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE: i said turn it down, toad brain.
SUPMALE:You're not my boss.
SUPFEMALE:I'll rip your face off from the inside, goon.
LEADMALE:You cannot harm me.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:So you really think it was cool, huh? yeah, who said? Wow.
LEADFEMALE:I guess the whole school knows.
LEADFEMALE:What does the whole school know? Class picture.
LEADFEMALE:Fourth row, second from the left.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:Becky, you're giving the finger.
SUPFEMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , go watch tv.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:The nerd flips the bird.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call you back, ok? Come on.
SUPFEMALE:You were just scratching your shoulder, right? why is it such a surprise? Because you're a butt-kisser, and you never get into any decent trouble.
SUPFEMALE:I'm totally impressed.
OTHERFEMALE:Wrong, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:It's paul revere and the raiders, but mark lindsay was the singer.
LEADMALE:Like there was a paul revere.
SUPMALE:Read the back of the album.
LEADFEMALE:Paul revere's the blond guy playing the keyboards.
SUPMALE:Why didn't he sing? Because mark lindsay sang better.
LEADMALE:How come it wasn't mark lindsay and the raiders? Because paul's mother let them practice in their garage.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Becky got a picture today, and she won't let me see it.
SUPMALE:It's just my class picture.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want him getting it all gross.
LEADMALE:Well, let me see it.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:See? I want to see.
LEADMALE:Me first.
SUPMALE:Why? 'cause.
LEADMALE:No fair.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, where are you? you mean you can't see me? Look, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy's home.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, princess.
LEADMALE:Bud, kitten.
LEADFEMALE:Margaret.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, our anniversary with the big, greasy car part? You're fixing her car, and i won't have to drive her.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:We've had fun together.
LEADFEMALE:It's fun listening to you give directions.
SUPFEMALE:Speed up, slow down, turn left, turn right, date him, not him.
LEADFEMALE:I got the part i've been looking for.
OTHERFEMALE:All i got to do is figure out what it is.
SUPMALE:Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:This guy's giving the old one-digit salute.
LEADMALE:Yeah, where? Right here.
LEADFEMALE:It's very subtle, under the chin.
SUPMALE:There's another one around the back.
LEADMALE:Oh, look it, a double, the guy with the arms crossed.
LEADFEMALE:Bravo.
SUPFEMALE:Here's the guy adjusting his glasses.
SUPMALE:He's rubbing his eye.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, a mislead.
LEADFEMALE:Let me try to find one now.
LEADFEMALE:You thought it was funny when the other kids did it.
LEADMALE:But the other kids aren't my kid, right, dan? Not to my knowledge, dear.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'll leave you guys alone since i know how disappointed you are in becky.
LEADMALE:I think i'm getting a "d" in math.
LEADFEMALE:Go to your room.
LEADMALE:What's becky doing? D.j. d.j. , go watch tv.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it's becky.
LEADFEMALE:It's almost as good as his we're number one in the football picture.
LEADMALE:That was a classic.
LEADMALE:Your parents were so very overjoyed.
SUPFEMALE:They were so uncool.
OTHERMALE:I don't know, dan.
LEADMALE:We ought to do something.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not punishing her for this.
LEADMALE:But we got to be parents.
SUPFEMALE:Not ours.
LEADFEMALE:We can't bust her for things we did.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but i mean, on one hand, i don't want her to think we approve, then on the other hand, i feel so close to her right now.
SUPFEMALE:Say, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, your son just gave gilligan the finger.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
SUPMALE:Well, he's the reason they're still stuck on that island.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:D.j. , get in here, little buddy.
SUPFEMALE:Becky! Yeah? Have a seat.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, how could i explain this? Ah! Ok, this is the church, this is the steeple, open the doors.
LEADFEMALE:See the big guy in the third row? Don't stick him up in the air at anybody.
SUPFEMALE:Mom did when she was driving.
SUPMALE:Well, the idiot cuts me off.
LEADFEMALE:Scoot.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:I'm going to see if this fits.
LEADMALE:They've taken these pictures forever.
SUPMALE:You'd think the photographer was wise to it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, every generation thinks they're the first.
SUPMALE:You know that picture of washington crossing the delaware? the guy in back looks like he's rowing see? Now you think the painter would've caught that.
SUPMALE:So how much trouble am i in? Sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:So? so? This doesn't seem like you, becky.
SUPFEMALE:Did you know these guys? was it a dare thing or something? No.
SUPFEMALE:I just did it.
SUPMALE:I don't know why.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do it again, or you're going to get grounded.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Is that it? You're doing dishes tonight, too, and that's final.
LEADFEMALE:But, mom, it's my turn to do the dishes.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, nobody has to know that.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's correct, amy.
LEADFEMALE:Fourth row, second from the left.
LEADMALE:Yeah, her name's becky conner my sister.
LEADMALE:I do, too, have a sister.
SUPMALE:She's just been in, uh reform school.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you want to hand me that dish? Got to go.
SUPFEMALE:Fingers needs me.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go sis.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:That was amy williams.
LEADFEMALE:Her sister's a senior, and even she knows about it.
LEADFEMALE:Seniors are talking about me? Everyone is.
SUPFEMALE:It's like all of a sudden you're cool.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i've always been cool but sometimes it's just cooler not to flash how cool you really are.
LEADFEMALE:We should just get a new car.
OTHERMALE:That car was built the year becky was born.
SUPMALE:It's got a lot of history.
SUPMALE:We bought it last year.
LEADFEMALE:It's got somebody else's history.
SUPFEMALE:We can't afford our own history.
SUPMALE:Let's get a used '81.
LEADMALE:Oh, an '81! dream on! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hold on a minute.
SUPMALE:Uh, it's for "mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:" it sounds serious.
LEADMALE:Who is it? It's becky's school.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:This is, uh, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Geez! Yeah, ok.
LEADMALE:I'll be there.
OTHERMALE:What? You and your finger just got suspended.
LEADMALE:Cool! Cool? you think it's cool i have to see the principal and take time off? you think that's cool, huh? Uh mmm becky.
LEADMALE:And don't be thinking you'll be laying around here on your butt and watch tv.
LEADMALE:There's plenty stuff to do around here.
SUPMALE:Dan, you'll be home fixing the car, right? Make sure she does it all.
LEADFEMALE:A minute ago you said it was no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that was before you got me in trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Now i got to go to your school.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to go to school.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, honey.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be all right.
OTHERMALE:If you run into that assistant principal who told me i wouldn't amount to anything, tell him dr.
SUPMALE:Conner says hi.
SUPFEMALE:Will the following students please report to the administration office? Brian mcdermott.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, i'm rebecca conner's mom.
SUPMALE:I'm here to see the principal.
LEADMALE:He'll be right with you.
LEADMALE:Please take a seat with the other mothers.
SUPFEMALE:Finger? We're all fingers over here.
LEADMALE:Roseanne harris? I used to be.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i don't believe it.
OTHERMALE:Neither do i.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, 15 years? It's at least that long.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't this weird, running into each other, especially at the principal's office? I'll tell you what's really weird.
SUPMALE:What? I don't have the foggiest idea of who you are.
LEADFEMALE:Anne marie.
LEADMALE:Dixon? It's mitchell now.
LEADMALE:Did you marry chuckie mitchell? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Who would've thought.
SUPMALE:You? well you remember that good-looking blond guy that took me to the junior dance? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he dumped me.
LEADMALE:I ended up with dan conner.
LEADFEMALE:It's really good to see you.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Boy this place really brings back memories, like the time we got dragged in here for burning our bras, and you told principal leeb it was a political statement.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:Ya know, anne marie, it wasn't even my bra that i burned.
LEADFEMALE:It was sally glimpsher's little tiny bra.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:She didn't need it, and i had gym that day, so i figured i wasn't going to get on the trampoline.
OTHERMALE:I could've hurt somebody.
LEADFEMALE:I remember sally glimpsher.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, she was always in trouble.
OTHERMALE:I think they were just giving her conjugal visits in detention.
LEADFEMALE:So tell me, which one is yours? Mmm, right there.
SUPFEMALE:Aw mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:It's her first obscene gesture.
LEADFEMALE:Her father and i are just so proud.
SUPMALE:Here's chuckie jr.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, geez, he's got his father's finger.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:This is taking a while, isn't it? I hope i'm not late for work.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I hope to talk this guy out of the three-day suspension.
SUPMALE:I hope i can talk at all.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like i'm 15, listening to what a horrible person i am.
LEADFEMALE:I used to sit there gnawing on my fingernails.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Of course now they've grown back, and i think i can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Principal hiller will see you now.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't do nothing! anne marie did! get out of here! Ladies, thanks for coming down.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, have a seat.
LEADMALE:Boy, everything sure looks a lot smaller.
SUPMALE:No offense.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what do we think about this? Mrs mitchell.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Mitchell, yeah.
LEADMALE:And your son has been suspended for three days.
OTHERMALE:True.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you must have an opinion about that, and i'd like to hear what it is.
SUPMALE:I really think a three-day suspension is a little much.
LEADMALE:I think she's right.
SUPMALE:I have to agree here.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not saying flipping the bird is right, but three days is a long time.
SUPMALE:Couldn't you start smaller, say, like, first a warning, and then maybe detention? something like that? Ok, you may be right, but i don't think so.
LEADMALE:You see, this is the warning.
LEADFEMALE:Next time they're down for something, it'll be two weeks.
SUPMALE:Two weeks at home, watching tv.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, that'll really make them mad.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:And you are? Roseanne harris er, conner.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's easy to see where becky gets her attitude.
SUPMALE:What do you mean by that? She's she's 16, she gets really good grades, she's not pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:I'd say that's damn near perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:Well i have evidence to the contrary here, mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:What are you saying, she's a bad kid, or are you calling me a bad mother? I know how hard it is to juggle a career and children.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! My children are my career, ok? You must be talking about my job, which you're making me late for.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:I sympathize, ladies, really i do, but i just can't do this all by myself.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you could spend the days with your kids and teach them about respect respect for others, respect for themselves.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, do your kids do this in the family pictures? No way.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:They do it here.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:Following that logic, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, as long as they're not stealing anything out of your living room, they can hold up a convenience store.
SUPMALE:We're not talking about armed robbery here.
LEADFEMALE:We're talking about teenagers flipping the bird.
LEADFEMALE:I think we should get over it.
LEADMALE:Maybe you're right, but i don't think so and neither do all these parents who have called in to complain about the photo.
LEADMALE:They want it re-shot at our cost.
OTHERMALE:Frankly, mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, that's not within our budget.
LEADFEMALE:What would you have me tell them about what your daughter did? Uh that it's a political statement.
LEADFEMALE:Funny but i don't think they would laugh, and i don't think they want to "get over it," because they did their job as parents.
SUPMALE:If you won't do yours, i'll see that it won't happen again by handing out a longer suspension next time.
LEADMALE:Now let's try this again.
SUPMALE:What do we want to do about this? did you drain the oil out of the crankcase? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Take the filter off? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Put the oil in the pan? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All this black stuff came squirting out.
LEADMALE:Slide on out of there.
SUPFEMALE:Thank god.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Now you're ready to lube.
LEADFEMALE:You know, dad, i-it's not like i don't like all this or anything, but mom kind of wanted me to work in the house.
LEADFEMALE:But mom's not here.
SUPMALE:Dad, i hate all this.
SUPFEMALE:I know, but you're keeping your old dad company, and, damn, we're having fun! Now get back on under there.
LEADFEMALE:Dad? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What am i supposed to do? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You know those pointed doohickeys i showed you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Point your gun at them and fire.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Eww! All this yellow slime is oozing out.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god! get out of there quick! Sorry about that.
LEADFEMALE:It was a little garage humor.
SUPFEMALE:Real funny, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh, look at my hands.
OTHERFEMALE:They're all greasy and dirty.
OTHERMALE:Here you go.
SUPFEMALE:Wipe them off on this sandwich.
SUPFEMALE:Say, dad, were you ever suspended? Just once.
LEADFEMALE:For what? Snoring too loud in detention.
SUPMALE:Spent the next three days tuning up my dad's rambler.
LEADMALE:So this is kind of like a time-honored family tradition, huh? You bet.
SUPFEMALE:Get on back under there now.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Where's your dad? In the garage.
OTHERFEMALE:What? no hug and kiss for your good daughter? As soon as i get one.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, mom.
LEADMALE:What are you doing with becky's picture? I put that in my special hiding place.
LEADMALE:That's where i found it.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, how come becky's got three hands in this picture? three hands? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:Let me see.
LEADMALE:Ahh! She didn't do it.
LEADMALE:I'll kill her! This turned out pretty good.
OTHERMALE:If you're expelled, you can do lube work.
LEADMALE:You know, don't you? know what? Have a look, dan.
LEADFEMALE:It's not your finger, is it? It could've been.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, becky's got three hands.
LEADMALE:Catch up, dan.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, "could've been"? It was the kid next to me.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you say anything? The picture came out, and everyone thought i was cool.
OTHERFEMALE:You two didn't seem to care, so i figured, "hey, i'm popular.
LEADMALE:Might as well go with it.
SUPFEMALE:" and then you got suspended, and i had to go down to the principal's office and get humiliated.
OTHERMALE:How long were you going to go with this? till now? you let your mom take the heat to be popular? I'm sorry, but i didn't get away with anything.
SUPFEMALE:I got suspended.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you're going to school tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, you can.
LEADMALE:I'll take another hour off work and straighten everything out with our principal.
LEADMALE:Then everyone will know i didn't do it.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Life sucks, don't it? you guys weren't mad when you thought i did do it, and now you're mad because i didn't? Next year i'll moon the class photo so you'll be proud of me.
OTHERFEMALE:Just make sure that it's your own butt.
OTHERMALE:You'll have to wait.
SUPFEMALE:I've been waiting for this all my life.
SUPFEMALE:I'm baaaack.
SUPFEMALE:What is it, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner? Fourth row, second from the left.
LEADMALE:Did you ever lay awake nights thinking, "if i had that one moment to live over again, i would do it differently"? I'm having that moment, and you're in it.
LEADFEMALE:Obviously there's been a little mistake.
SUPMALE:I'll lift becky's suspension.
LEADFEMALE:And i think an apology's in order.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:And what about the other mothers that were in here? Their children really did it.
LEADFEMALE:Their kid makes one mistake, and they're bad mothers? I believe how a student behaves reflects the attitudes of the parent.
LEADFEMALE:What if becky wishes she'd done it? what kind of mother would i be? I have already apologized i'll tell you what kind of mother that makes me the exact same kind of mother i was yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:No matter how much we try to control our kids, at some point, they'll just do what they'll do.
OTHERFEMALE:They are like people that way.
OTHERFEMALE:But isn't it our job, mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner, to make sure they become responsible, mature adults? Absolutely, absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:But we must remember, mr.
SUPMALE:Hiller, that it's not easy.
LEADFEMALE:Like, say, when i'm in here next year because of something my darlene does and i will be here just remember that today i was a good mother.
OTHERMALE:I'll do that, mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:See you next year.
OTHERFEMALE:Tuesdays will be good for me.
SUPMALE:Attention, all students taking latin, you're wasting your lives!
SUPMALE:Was the baby up again all night, crystal? Oh, yeah, but i'm not complaining.
SUPMALE:I'm seeing all kinds of things you'd never see if you were getting any sleep at all.
LEADFEMALE:Little ed and i watch the sun rise and set.
SUPMALE:Rise and set.
SUPMALE:And did you know the big valley comes on at 5:00 in the morning? and again at 6:30? Oh, come here, little ed.
LEADMALE:Come see your auntie-sister-in-law--whatever-roseanne while mommy has her little breakdown.
LEADMALE:What is wrong with him? Nothing wrong with him, crystal, he's just a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why won't he sleep? I've tried everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Even the washing machine.
SUPFEMALE:You put him in the washing machine? No, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You put him in his little baby seat on the washer, and the vibrations are supposed to soothe him to sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:When you were a baby, we couldn't afford a washing machine, so i took you down to the river and beat you against a rock.
LEADMALE:Why pick on me? did i take the last doughnut or something? Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, becky.
LEADMALE:You want some breakfast? I was running over to return jackie's top.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:I'll put that in with this load.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're here.
LEADMALE:Yeah, of course.
LEADMALE:Good, 'cause i think i have those earrings i borrowed, too.
LEADFEMALE:Which earrings? I think they're yours.
LEADMALE:Come up and see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ok.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:What's she going to go griping to aunt jackie about? No, i'm good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, too much coffee gives you the shakes, and then you cut yourself shaving.
LEADMALE:Ohwhat now? I think he's hungry.
OTHERMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Will you hold him for a second? Oh, gimme.
OTHERFEMALE:Gimme that baby.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you little it-ums smell so good, don't you? Your head smells so sweet.
SUPMALE:Oh, head smells sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Smell his head, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Smell your uncle's head.
SUPMALE:Get that thing away from me.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, i'm exposed here.
LEADMALE:Oh, sorry.
SUPMALE:Come on, little ed.
SUPFEMALE:We go see what mommy's got for breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shucks.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just milk again.
SUPFEMALE:Come here, little ed.
SUPMALE:Isn't you cute? Well, i'm going to get going.
OTHERFEMALE:You coming home for dinner? Depends on what we're having.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, crystal-whoa! hello! Hey, dad, smell the baby's head.
LEADMALE:How's the motorcycle shop, dan? Real fine.
LEADFEMALE:Sell a bike yet? No, no, but i'm getting a lot of repair work.
LEADMALE:Boy, that ceiling needs some spackle.
LEADMALE:Does this make you uncomfortable, dan? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:It's a beautiful, natural thing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i got to get going.
LEADFEMALE:Now, dan, it's not like you've never seen breasts before.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal's my friend.
SUPFEMALE:As far as i'm concerned, she has no breasts.
LEADFEMALE:It works for me, ok? Yeah, ok.
LEADMALE:So when are you coming home? Maybe early.
SUPMALE:Mark's coming by to help me rebuild that old triumph.
LEADMALE:Becky's mark? what, is he officially working for you now? Roseanne he's real good with these old bikes, he works cheap, and it's only for a couple of days.
LEADMALE:Dad, quick! crystal's switching sides! I'm out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:Is he ok? Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:He's just a leg man.
LEADFEMALE:What now? you don't want to eat, and you don't want to sleep, and-oh! Oh where can i change him? Your house.
LEADMALE:Change him in my room.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Be right back.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, can we talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
SUPMALE:It's kind of personal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, darlene go out and play.
LEADFEMALE:Play? I don't play, mother.
OTHERMALE:Playpack whatever.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess now mom gets to be let in on the big secret.
SUPMALE:Becky's got something really important she wants to talk to you about, and she'd like you to be really sensitive.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:I can't-yes, you can.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, beck.
SUPFEMALE:Well, mark and i are getting along really good now, and i know you guys aren't crazy about him, but you got to admit, he's trying really hard.
LEADFEMALE:Ok um well, i was thinking, you know um j-just in case we decide to um that it's time for me to, um get somebirth control.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't it great, roseanne that becky has such a wonderful, progressive open-minded mom that she can talk to about that? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Well, i was going to go to a clinic um, but jackie thought that maybe i should go and see your g-g gynecologist.
LEADFEMALE:Gynecologist.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Really? so this is ok with you? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:You're kidding.
SUPMALE:I'm so glad jackie made me tell you.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, i thought that we should take her.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure! Sure, we'll take her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so glad i told her.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks so much, mom.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERFEMALE:So this is a good thing, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Are you crazy? she wants birth control, and that's a good thing? need to sit down? No, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I need to lay down in a great big pine box.
SUPMALE:She came to you.
OTHERFEMALE:She confided in you.
LEADMALE:She trusts you.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a good thing.
LEADMALE:I cannot handle this.
LEADFEMALE:You can.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
SUPFEMALE:I know i can't do this.
SUPFEMALE:I can do this.
LEADMALE:Well, i had to tear the whole engine down but i think i found your problem.
LEADMALE:You worked on this yourself before you brought it in.
SUPMALE:Well, it's going to be 400 bucks to fix what you did.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:If you don't think that's fair, come on down and pick it up.
LEADFEMALE:Bring a bag.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPFEMALE:How was lunch? It was cool.
LEADMALE:Is is ever not cool, mark? huh? Never mind.
OTHERMALE:So, what time are you picking me up tonight? Around 8:00, i guess.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:So lunch was good? Yup.
LEADMALE:What'd you eat? Tacos.
LEADMALE:Ah mexican? Yup.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the bike's back there.
SUPMALE:Oh, customer.
LEADMALE:I'll be out front.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, rosey.
LEADFEMALE:I brought you lunch from the restaurant.
SUPMALE:Smells good.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i don't know why the guy didn't finish it.
SUPFEMALE:How's it going? Cool.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Hi, there, mark! hey! You just missed becky.
LEADFEMALE:That's ok.
LEADMALE:I'll see her later.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thanks for lunch, hon.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to get back.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, dan.
SUPFEMALE:We have to talk.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to know.
SUPMALE:Well, you have to know because i'm not going to know this alone.
LEADMALE:What? Becky wants me to take her and get her some birth control.
SUPMALE:Where are you going? Oh, i'm going to kill mark.
LEADMALE:He's in back, so i have to go in the back to kill him.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we can't just let this happen.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want it to happen either, but if it is, i don't want our daughter getting her birth control from the chevron men's room like we used to.
LEADMALE:What are we supposed to do? put on sinatra, fluff the pillows, and dim the lights? Like they listen to sinatra.
LEADFEMALE:She's 17, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think there's much we can do.
SUPFEMALE:You're not even going to try to talk to her out of it.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, i'm goin' try my butt off.
SUPFEMALE:But i won't explode at her.
SUPFEMALE:Neither will you.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to act like nothing's goin' on? Yeah.
LEADMALE:If we go crazy with this, she's not going to trust me with anything.
SUPMALE:It's better she comes to us rather than learning everything from johnny hormone back there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:He's just going to walk in here all innocent, like nothing happened.
LEADMALE:Well, that's the way you played it with my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:I forgot about that.
LEADFEMALE:Suddenly, i feel like calling your father and apologizing for ever having sex with his daughter.
LEADMALE:Ah, it's ok, dan.
LEADMALE:It's enough that you've apologized to me.
OTHERMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Addison? any diabetes in our family? No.
LEADMALE:Ulcers? No.
LEADMALE:History of migraine? No.
SUPMALE:This is my first one.
LEADFEMALE:I wish they'd just give me the pills instead of this whole exam thing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Just keep your socks on.
OTHERMALE:There's a good look-a paper dress and socks.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not the prom, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:If she keeps her socks on, her feet will slip out of the stirrups.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, jackie, but socks will keep her feet warm in the stirrups.
OTHERMALE:But then she's not going to have any traction.
LEADFEMALE:Traction's the key.
LEADMALE:Becky conner? Oh, thank god.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey! Go get 'em.
LEADMALE:Go get 'em? I want to say all this stuff like, "stop, you're too young," but the only thing i talk about is socks.
LEADFEMALE:You're doing great.
LEADMALE:I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:I drive her down here.
SUPFEMALE:I make the appointment.
LEADFEMALE:Well, becky's very, very lucky.
LEADFEMALE:What are people going to say, jackie? who's going to know? She's going to tell all her friends, then they'll tell their moms, "mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner lets becky have sex.
SUPFEMALE:" well, roseanne do other people go through this, or am i the only insane mother in the world? I wish our mom had been a little more insane.
SUPMALE:I took some stupid chances when i was a kid, you know.
LEADMALE:Mmm what? She's all grown-up, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:She doesn't need me anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, of course she does.
LEADMALE:She needs you.
LEADFEMALE:She needs you to pay for the pills.
SUPMALE:Something i can do for you, mr.
LEADMALE:Conner? No.
SUPMALE:No, i'm cool.
OTHERFEMALE:What is this doing here? I was using it.
SUPFEMALE:Using it? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Is that how you treat my wrench, you use it, then you toss it aside into a puddle of grease? Sorry.
LEADMALE:This wrench was brand-new, never even been touched.
OTHERMALE:But you yanked it out of the shrink wrap, did god-knows-what with it, and you're just going to leave it laying there? I was going to use it again.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, buddy.
LEADMALE:See, i don't care what you do with all your other little wrenches, but this is my wrench.
LEADFEMALE:And i want it returned in the same condition you found it in.
SUPMALE:You got that? is that clear? is that cool? Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on, mark.
LEADMALE:Becky, zippy's on the phone! So, mark, uh, did you dial the phone yourself, or did daddy help you? Oh, now, that's not very nice.
LEADFEMALE:Do you use that filthy mouth to kiss my sister? Give me the phone, darlene.
SUPMALE:Let me just say goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you were supposed to pick me up at 8:00.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's got him on the roof cleaning the gutters.
SUPFEMALE:But, what about your date? It's off.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADMALE:Now, what am i going to do all night? Well, i've got an idea.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we make a ton of popcorn, then we'll watch tv and have a little chat, just me and you? Ok.
LEADMALE:Let's go see what we want.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm, cheddar cheese.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
SUPMALE:How's your headache? Oh, it's better.
LEADMALE:It's just a crippling, blinding thing.
LEADMALE:No biggie.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Um, becky.
SUPMALE:I kind of wanted to, you know, talk to you about all this, and, um, i was wondering if, you know, uh, you--you've thought about everything.
LEADMALE:You mean about the pill? Yeah, that and other stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:You do know that you don't have to have sex just to have a boyfriend.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Even though some of your friends might be having sex and filling your head with all these lies about how good it is.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I was just thinking that, you know, you're young and maybe you should wait.
OTHERMALE:I mean, this is a really big step.
LEADFEMALE:I know, mom.
SUPMALE:I've thought about this.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i--i just wanted to bring it up.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Uh, you know, though, uh, you've got a while to think about it more and maybe even reconsider because the pill doesn't kick in for like--what? A whole month.
SUPMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:Yeah? oh what? we already already? I really wanted to tell you, but i thought you'd be mad.
LEADFEMALE:Already? Don't worry, mom.
LEADMALE:We used something.
LEADMALE:You already used something? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:A condom.
OTHERMALE:You know, for diseases and stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought having the pill would be like extra, extra protection.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom? Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:Good thinking.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:Is there anything else that i need to know? No.
LEADFEMALE:I know every single thing there is to know? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Do you swear to god? Yeah.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm going to put the cheese on the popcorn, so you get something on tv.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Listen, mom, this is between us, right? you're not going to go tell dad, are you? Well, not if you don't want me to.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, mom.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:I love you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, let go.
OTHERFEMALE:In a couple years.
LEADFEMALE:Howdy, stranger.
SUPMALE:What happened? Well, i gave her the big old speech, you know, about waiting and everything.
LEADMALE:Is she going to? She's 17, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:She thinks she's in love.
SUPMALE:Oh, wait.
OTHERMALE:Did i mention i wanted happy news? Oh, ok.
OTHERMALE:Uh ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Once upon a time, in a perfect fairy tale world ah, there lived a beautiful princess and her beautiful mother-the all-knowing queen-who was even more beautiful that the princess.
LEADFEMALE:And one day the princess decided that she was going to have sex with an ugly, creepy, hideous little ogre, named cool.
SUPFEMALE:Scary.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:But that's ok because the queen talked to the princess and told her she must never ever have sex, and the princess agreed.
LEADFEMALE:So the queen, the princess, and the ignorant old king lived happily ever after in a totally sex-free world.
OTHERMALE:The end.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened to cool? Oh, it was horrible.
LEADMALE:He died a hideous and grotesque death when something very sharp and heavy and medieval fell upon his head.
LEADMALE:Tell it again.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Becky, this ain't art class.
SUPFEMALE:Put a glob on, then check your turkey.
LEADMALE:I already stuffed it, seasoned it, and basted it.
LEADFEMALE:What should i do next, massage it? Whatever floats your boat.
LEADMALE:You still mashing those yams? I'm trying to get the fly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, it's a big one, too, isn't it? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We'll just add some raisins.
SUPMALE:Mom! All right.
LEADFEMALE:Throw it away and start a new batch.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, look! It came out of its hole to forage for food.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes they'll eat out of your hand.
SUPFEMALE:Get the camera.
LEADMALE:That was so funny, i'm going back to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Guess what, darlene? You're making the fruit salad.
SUPFEMALE:Guess what, becky? You're a big mo.
SUPFEMALE:Guess what, darlene? You're making the fruit salad, or i'll break your neck.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, could you go to the garage and get the card table and dust it off? I could, but i'd miss the bears-lions pre-game show, and that would be wrong.
SUPMALE:You're not parking your butt on that sofa while we're in here slaving away.
SUPFEMALE:What, exactly, is it that you're doing? I'm pacing myself.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Grocery patrol reporting as ordered.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne's famous homemade pumpkin pies.
SUPMALE:Don't forget your famous homemade dessert topping.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? Home to change.
SUPMALE:I'll be back in an hour.
SUPMALE:You're hiding from mom, then at 6:00 you'll say you had cramps.
LEADMALE:I'm not doing that this year, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a different person.
LEADMALE:I can handle my mother.
SUPFEMALE:I'm done with the stupid fruit salad.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you supposed to peel the fruit? I'm not eating this crap.
LEADFEMALE:Why should i make it? you're not having dinner? I opt not to celebrate the exploitation of indians by religious fanatics.
OTHERMALE:Good point.
SUPMALE:No sale.
SUPMALE:I want to hang out in my room alone.
SUPMALE:Why can't you people understand that? God, dan, your daughter is really starting to get on my nerves.
LEADMALE:Come here, little ed.
LEADMALE:You're getting so big, we'll start calling you big little ed.
LEADMALE:He puts on a pound every day.
LEADMALE:That's dan's average.
LEADFEMALE:All muscle, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Let me hold him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look at those big, blue eyes! Oh, you're so cute.
LEADMALE:I want one.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, becky, that's enough for you.
LEADFEMALE:Would you get the diapers from the car? I'll do it later.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, lonnie.
LEADMALE:You like football? Hate it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Football's great for hatred.
SUPMALE:You can hate the refs, hate the opposing quarterback, and you've got to hate those guys whose faces are painted blue.
LEADMALE:Hello, hello, everybody! Hi.
SUPMALE:Hello, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my aching butt.
LEADMALE:Stop it, mother.
SUPFEMALE:That's a brand-new car.
OTHERFEMALE:Happy thanksgiving.
SUPMALE:So how was the drive? I'd forgotten it was so long.
LEADFEMALE:Where's dad? He couldn't make it.
SUPFEMALE:He's under the weather.
SUPMALE:He's sick, what's the matter with him? I brought my special stuffing.
LEADMALE:I already made stuffing.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You'll eat your stuffing.
LEADMALE:Everybody else will eat mine.
OTHERMALE:Who needs a drink? I'd love half a glass of wine.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Half a glass of wine.
SUPFEMALE:Bring out the bottle.
LEADMALE:Yeah? what do you need, mary? I need three fingers of bourbon, and a beer chaser.
SUPMALE:One big boiler coming up.
LEADMALE:Grandma.
SUPMALE:Hi! Hello, little hardbody.
SUPFEMALE:How do you keep that body so damn trim? It's her nerves.
OTHERMALE:Nervous people are too thin.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go.
SUPMALE:It's true i read it in a magazine.
OTHERMALE:Before you even ask, i'm doing great.
SUPMALE:I don't have a boyfriend now, but it's because i'm feeling independent and secure, and i feel better about myself than i have in years.
SUPFEMALE:That's the truth.
SUPMALE:Well, that certainly was a mouthful, wasn't it? Becky! Well, nice going, silver tongue.
OTHERMALE:Where's dad? She says he's sick.
LEADMALE:I talked to him a few days ago.
LEADMALE:He was fine.
LEADFEMALE:You cut your hair! Do you like it? What's important is that you like it, dear.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, i notice your table is not set.
LEADFEMALE:You do plan on setting it, don't you? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll throw the food on the floor and have everybody fight for it.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'll set the table.
LEADMALE:Where's the good china? Over at your house till the reading of the will.
LEADMALE:Enter and die.
OTHERMALE:I need a little breather.
SUPMALE:Grandma, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, she's o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:, but sometimes i just hate her guts? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I mean, no.
SUPMALE:Nobody hates their mom.
OTHERFEMALE:At least, you're not supposed to.
SUPFEMALE:Well, mi casa es su casa.
LEADFEMALE:Catcher in the rye? Oh, god, that's a good one.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Did you read it? No.
SUPMALE:But we were assigned to read it in high school.
SUPFEMALE:That was my sophomore year.
LEADMALE:Yeah, 'cause i had this crush on terry halligan.
LEADFEMALE:He was this great-looking college guy.
SUPMALE:So i shortened all my skirts and didn't crack open a book.
LEADFEMALE:Then report cards came out, mom grounded me, and that was the end of terry halligan.
SUPMALE:She was always doing that stuff! This other time-jackie, would you like to read a book? Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:There's some kurt vonnegut on the top shelf.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Cat in the hat.
OTHERFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADMALE:Well, yes, honey, we miss you so much.
OTHERMALE:Stop that, ed.
LEADFEMALE:People are listening.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, they can hear me, and i said "stop that.
LEADFEMALE:" they all know what that means.
LEADMALE:Oh, ed, you're terrible! ha ha ha ha! Give--you--you-whoa, me wear something strapless? O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, dad, but first i have to shave my back.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and you're an old pervert! We understand.
SUPFEMALE:You got stuck on the road.
LEADMALE:Of course you couldn't see it coming.
LEADFEMALE:Buffalo.
LEADMALE:Winter.
LEADMALE:Snow.
LEADMALE:What are the odds? O.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:I'll talk to you when you get back.
OTHERMALE:I'd better get going.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie needs the phone.
LEADFEMALE:You're really sucking up that chardonnay, beverly.
LEADMALE:It's my first glass, mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Quit treating me like a child! first glass, my aching butt! How much has grandma had? Six fingers, and a very generous thumb.
SUPMALE:Your dad says to save him a big turkey leg.
SUPFEMALE:His name's ed, and he's my stepdad.
SUPFEMALE:And he says he misses you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not sitting at the kids' table.
OTHERMALE:You can talk to becky.
OTHERFEMALE:No way, you guys.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 17.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not watching d.j. make another mashed potato town.
LEADMALE:Well, looks like d.j. is the kiddies table.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of pathetic, isn't it? All right, everybody eats in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Grab a chair.
LEADMALE:I just called dad again.
SUPFEMALE:Still no answer.
LEADFEMALE:I said he was sick.
LEADMALE:Maybe you shouldn't have left him alone.
LEADMALE:He's not that sick.
SUPFEMALE:He's fine.
OTHERMALE:Why didn't he answer the phone? Maybe he didn't hear it.
LEADMALE:He's nearly deaf in one ear.
LEADFEMALE:How many ears does it take to hear the phone? Usually he sleeps on his good one.
SUPFEMALE:Are you buying this? Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:Not me.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
SUPMALE:, girls, there is something you should know, but i don't think now is the time.
LEADFEMALE:Now is the perfect time.
LEADMALE:We want to know now.
LEADMALE:You have a fight? We'll talk about it after dinner.
LEADMALE:Uh-uh, no way, because there won't be a dinner unless you tell us.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:This year, your father is spending thanksgiving with his girlfriend.
SUPFEMALE:Now, let's eat.
OTHERMALE:My, that turkey smells delicious.
LEADMALE:Now, crystal, that car seat is from rodbell's.
SUPFEMALE:If you want to take it back, the receipt's in the box.
LEADFEMALE:No, i love it.
LEADMALE:Al and i felt the baby would enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:There's a little steering wheel and a little horn.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing he can swallow, and he can chew on all of it.
SUPFEMALE:She hasn't stopped yakking since we sat down.
SUPFEMALE:Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
LEADMALE:The woman's a mental case.
LEADFEMALE:Dad? dad? what do you need, deej? I can't hear anything anybody's saying.
LEADMALE:No wonder the kid can't hear.
LEADFEMALE:He's practically sitting in the john.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll try to talk louder, d.j. what? She said to shut up and eat.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, i thought mark was coming.
OTHERMALE:He was supposed to, but he decided to have tv dinners with his buddies.
LEADMALE:That reminds me of the cutest tv show-no, it doesn't.
SUPFEMALE:So, where's darlene? the daughter of doom? She's upstairs hiding from the sunlight.
LEADFEMALE:You know, now i think i got it.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute-you married dan's father, and dan is married to my granddaughter.
LEADMALE:So that makes your baby nothing to me.
LEADMALE:Honey, would you stop that? Lonnie, i said please.
LEADMALE:Stop it! stop what? D.j. ! Well, i hope you all noticed-the only thing that kid ate was my stuffing.
SUPMALE:I think i lost my appetite.
SUPMALE:I'll go talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody touch that plate.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't done.
SUPFEMALE:Can i be excused? Yeah, yeah, just get out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:If it wasn't for all that jabbering, it was a very fine meal.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you think so, because this is the last thanksgiving i'm ever having.
LEADMALE:Do you realize there are four generations of our family in this kitchen right now? I'm so proud i could just burst.
LEADMALE:I'd pay to see that.
LEADMALE:I'll have my coffee in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:No, you will not, because you're going to spill your guts.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne sit.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? It's very simple.
LEADMALE:Your father has met a younger woman.
LEADFEMALE:She's 57 and works in his office.
SUPMALE:Then you'll just have to throw his sorry butt out.
LEADFEMALE:No, i will not.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you're going to just stay with the jerk? We've only heard one side of this story.
SUPFEMALE:He's 60 years old.
LEADFEMALE:He's screwing around.
LEADMALE:That's disgusting.
LEADMALE:That's his side.
LEADMALE:I knew she'd take up for her father.
OTHERMALE:That is so typical.
SUPFEMALE:I guess none of us here have never made a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:Please.
OTHERMALE:Should i hear this? No.
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Wait.
OTHERMALE:How long has the affair been going on? I've known about it for a couple of years, and this morning he finally decided to tell me.
LEADMALE:He's been seeing some office tramp for two years and you never said anything? Come on, beverly, grow up.
LEADMALE:You can't let a man walk all over you like that.
SUPMALE:I didn't want to rock the boat.
LEADMALE:What boat? You don't have a boat.
LEADFEMALE:You have a lousy marriage.
SUPMALE:Watch your mouth, young lady.
OTHERFEMALE:This is serious stuff.
LEADMALE:People get divorced over stuff like this.
OTHERMALE:I'm too old to start my life over again.
SUPMALE:Let me handle it my way.
SUPMALE:I'm telling him what i think.
SUPFEMALE:Where is he? This isn't about your father, this is about my husband.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to stay out of it.
LEADMALE:Please! You're her mother.
SUPMALE:Do something.
OTHERMALE:When she asks for my help, i'll arrange to have your father killed.
SUPFEMALE:But until then, you got to understand-she's scared.
SUPFEMALE:She doesn't know how to live alone.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's the way i raised her.
LEADMALE:Maybe i should blame myself.
LEADFEMALE:Who the hell needs that? does anybody want any pie? you don't want to sneak beers? No.
SUPFEMALE:Let's at least go get some hot dogs.
SUPMALE:I'm starved.
OTHERMALE:I'm trying to read.
OTHERFEMALE:My mom says you're having a nervous breakdown.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i could snap any minute.
LEADMALE:Is that how come the black clothes? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:They gave them to me at the asylum.
LEADFEMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:I'm not a kid.
SUPMALE:You're a fetus.
SUPFEMALE:You turned into a complete dork.
LEADFEMALE:People change.
LEADMALE:Get used to it or die.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! ho ho ho ho! Aah-ha.
LEADMALE:I used to be a pretty good nerf ball player.
SUPMALE:I was going to turn pro-did mom tell you to talk to me? No, i'm just making sure darlene was having any fun.
LEADMALE:Anyway, you're out of here.
LEADMALE:The baby's ready to go.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:He's the boss.
LEADFEMALE:When my dad's gone, you're the man of the house.
SUPMALE:I was before your dad moved in.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K, forget man of the house.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know where was going with that.
SUPMALE:The thing is, your attitude-the way you tick everybody off-it's not going to get you anywhere.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:I got another new father.
SUPMALE:Actually, you got a new big brother.
LEADMALE:If you act like this next thanksgiving, i'll knock you down and sit on your head.
OTHERFEMALE:Kids.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Listen, i got an idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's ditch the fossils and catch a late movie.
SUPMALE:You still don't get it, do you? No, darlene, i don't.
LEADFEMALE:You've been moping around for two months and i don't have a clue.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not trying to be mean.
SUPFEMALE:Just stop worrying about me.
LEADMALE:I can't help it.
LEADMALE:I know we're not best buddies anymore.
LEADFEMALE:We don't even talk anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i talk.
SUPMALE:Nobody listens.
LEADMALE:I just want to finish my book.
LEADMALE:I just came up here to get lonnie anyway.
LEADMALE:Did i interrupt something? She wants to be left alone.
LEADMALE:Who doesn't? well, what's new at the zoo? Not much.
SUPMALE:Thanks, but i'm really not hungry.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't for you.
SUPMALE:This is mine.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not bothering you, am i? No, you're cool.
SUPMALE:I can't wait to get a place of my own.
OTHERFEMALE:Try new york.
LEADFEMALE:They got great chinese food there.
LEADFEMALE:Anything to get out of lanford.
SUPMALE:It's so phony here.
LEADFEMALE:All the kids at school have totally changed.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a freak because i don't kiss up to juniors and seniors.
LEADMALE:I know exactly how you feel.
LEADMALE:Where i come from, if you don't play bridge they think you're a communist.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't people just let you be yourself? have you ever felt like you don't want to talk to anybody? like you just need to figure things out? I get this perfect image of what i want to be, but at school i'm just this total geek again.
LEADMALE:You're young.
LEADFEMALE:You got to give it time.
LEADMALE:Tell that to my parents.
LEADMALE:They want to know what the problem is, but how can i tell them if i don't know? Darlene, be patient with them.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i guess.
OTHERMALE:Have a little turkey.
LEADFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I've decided to quit eating meat.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the stuffing you're scarfing down is full of meat.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I meant big chunks of meat.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thanks again, roseanne, i had a wonderful time.
LEADFEMALE:What's it take to make you miserable? Well, anyway, the food was good.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, dan.
LEADMALE:Drop by the shop.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll give you work.
LEADMALE:That's cool.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, crystal, tell my dad he better not leave me alone for the new year's games i'm going to kick his butt.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want any arguments.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sleeping on the pull-out tonight.
LEADMALE:I don't care how lumpy it is.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we had nana mary this year.
SUPFEMALE:No way.
SUPMALE:I've got nana mary.

SUPFEMALE:Mother are you going come in and humiliate me every day? No, just till it ain't fun no more.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, you look so cute in your little smock.

LEADMALE:This is three grapes.
OTHERMALE:How can i charge you for this? I ate about seven or eight of them.
OTHERFEMALE:I believe i also had four grapes.
LEADMALE:So charge me for, what, we charge by the pound, not the grape.
LEADFEMALE:I know what i weighed before eating the grapes.
LEADFEMALE:I'll climb on this scale mom, stop it.
LEADMALE:People are waiting in line.
LEADFEMALE:Becky? what's the problem here? Nothing, howard.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything's fine.
LEADFEMALE:You've got customers and a belt that's not moving.
SUPMALE:Make it move.
SUPMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Becky, if this job's too much for you, i can get somebody competent to take over.
OTHERFEMALE:Howard the longer you stand here and insult me, the longer it'll take to check these people through.
SUPMALE:If you go back to your manager cage, we can both get our work done.
LEADFEMALE:That's a keeper.
SUPFEMALE:You should have kicked his sorry butt out before thanksgiving.
SUPFEMALE:I know he's my father, but he's like every other man-a lying sack of dirt.
LEADMALE:No, you'll be fine.
OTHERMALE:What did he ever do for you? He knocked you up twice and took the garbage out on thursdays.
SUPFEMALE:Should we erect a statue? No, i won't talk to him.
LEADMALE:That man is a giant pile of crap.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm not yelling.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just saying you did the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you did! So what if you've got adjacent burial plots? That's no reason to stay married to somebody.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, call me if you need anything.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, what a day i had.
LEADMALE:My father's little affair in kansas city has been going on for 20 years.
LEADFEMALE:Not 2, 20.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Did your mom throw him out? Of course.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't have the strength to drive some ice pick through his skull and drag his lifeless body to some shallow grave.
SUPMALE:Sounds like you've thought this through.
LEADFEMALE:I like to think ahead.
SUPMALE:How come the kids ain't eating with us? Becky's still at work, d.j. 's eating at todd's, and darlene's in her room sacrificing a chicken or whatever.
LEADMALE:Macaroni and cheese! Together again.
SUPFEMALE:Your phone's been busy for an hour.
SUPMALE:I been on with mom.
LEADMALE:Yeah? how's she doing? There won't be a bottle of chardonnay left in moline by morning.
OTHERMALE:What do you guys got going tonight? Well, we'll sit in here until dinner's over.
LEADMALE:Then we'll go sit in there.
LEADFEMALE:I got an overnight haul to topeka.
SUPFEMALE:I was going to stop through kansas city and check out dad's mistress.
LEADMALE:What am i thinking, huh? I don't believe you.
SUPMALE:He told me her name.
SUPMALE:I looked it up in information and got her address.
SUPFEMALE:It's totally insane.
LEADFEMALE:Are you coming? why would i want to do that? Dad's been having an affair with her for 20 years.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to see what she looks like.
SUPFEMALE:What would we even say to this woman? We can figure that out on the way down there.
LEADFEMALE:No way! O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:This little trip will make a great story, and you'll just be the big wuss at the very beginning.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not going.
SUPFEMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:, fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'll see you tomorrow night.
OTHERFEMALE:She has no business going to see this woman.
OTHERMALE:Driving all the way to kansas city for what? They make great barbecue sauce in kansas city.
LEADMALE:I'll bring you back some.
OTHERMALE:On the road again da da da da da da da road again da da da da da da da da da da da da da da sing with me, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know da da da da road again.
SUPMALE:What's this button for? Don't touch that! Just stop distracting me.
LEADMALE:I'm operating a 20-ton vehicle at well past the legal speed limit.
OTHERMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Can i drive? No! You begged me to come and now you're mean.
SUPFEMALE:Did not.
LEADFEMALE:Am not.
SUPFEMALE:Did, too.
OTHERMALE:Are, too.
LEADFEMALE:Just because i called dad a lying scum.
SUPMALE:Everything is just so black and white to you.
LEADMALE:Did you consider that mom drove him to it? She drove him crazy.
SUPFEMALE:She made him nuts.
LEADFEMALE:She drove me crazy, too, but i didn't have another mom stashed on the side.
OTHERFEMALE:What will we say to this joan woman? We'll ask what kind of woman would steal a man away from his happy family.
LEADFEMALE:Where were you living? We were never happy.
LEADMALE:Maybe we would have been if she'd left dad alone.
SUPMALE:Now you're being unfair, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:What woman could rightly turn down a patio furniture salesman who cleaned out his ears with his car keys? you just don't get it, do you? Yeah, i do get it.
OTHERMALE:First it's mom's fault, then it's this woman's fault.
LEADFEMALE:When is it going to be dad's fault, jackie? There's a word for this, and it's called denial.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to talk about it, o.
OTHERMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:? Well, you started it.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm stopping it.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, o.

LEADMALE:Oh, who's there? Cleopatra.
LEADFEMALE:Cleopatra who? Cleopatra, queen of denial.
LEADMALE:Shut up! God, you're such a grump.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody want a pudding cup? No.
LEADMALE:God, i'm so bored.
SUPMALE:Let's moon somebody.
LEADMALE:Nah.
OTHERMALE:It's too cold.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, a volkswagen.
SUPMALE:Slug bug! Come on.
OTHERMALE:How old are you? Grow up.
SUPMALE:It's not like we're cadillac whack! I didn't hit you that hard.
LEADMALE:That's for that trip to gettysburg we took together when we were little.
SUPFEMALE:That was the worst trip ever.
LEADMALE:I know, i know.
LEADMALE:Every car that passed us you beat the crap out of me.
SUPFEMALE:In a station wagon.
SUPMALE:Just so dad could see cannonballs in a pile.
OTHERMALE:Mom said there would be rides.
SUPMALE:They were such liars.
LEADFEMALE:The trip back was good, though.
SUPFEMALE:We were making all that noise until dad screamed, "not another word!" then we started making all those animal noises.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's yelling at us, mom's yelling at us, and the whole time neither one of them said a word to each other.
LEADFEMALE:They never said a word to each other unless it was about us kids fighting or getting in trouble.
SUPMALE:Which we did a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we had to.
LEADFEMALE:We were trying to save their marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Dodge.
OTHERMALE:Dodge what? Dodge this.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! god! dad, i hate my life! Tough day, honey? My jobs sucks and my boss is big dumb jerk.
LEADMALE:That's too bad, dear.
SUPFEMALE:And i can't quit, because there's never any money around here for anything i want.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:If you expect me to clean up this rathole, you're nuts.
LEADMALE:I'm taking a bath and going to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Night, rosie.
LEADMALE:Hey, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, deej.
OTHERMALE:How was dinner over at todd's house? It was great.
LEADFEMALE:They had cloth napkins and everything.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You want one? Deej, you can't do that.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Bowman gave it to me.
LEADMALE:She did not.
LEADFEMALE:After i blew my nose on it, she said to keep it.
LEADFEMALE:Way to go, deej.
OTHERFEMALE:Next time, aim for their big screen tv set.
OTHERFEMALE:You finally get that wooden stake out of your heart? Becky's upstairs crying.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to stick around.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? I promised i wouldn't tell.
LEADFEMALE:You lied.
OTHERMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:She stood up to her boss and he busted her down to bag girl and called her-a bad word.
LEADFEMALE:How bad a word? Bad.
SUPMALE:The "b" word? Worse.
SUPMALE:The "f" word? deej! The "l" word? what's the "l" word? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:What's the "f" word? d.j. all right, darlene, what word? I'll kill him.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, you're not supposed to know.
SUPMALE:Hey, accidents happen.
LEADFEMALE:A can of creamed corn could fall on his head as many times as it takes.
LEADFEMALE:On the road again da da da da da on the road again honk honk! That's enough.
LEADFEMALE:Move over.
LEADFEMALE:I brought you a doughnut.
LEADFEMALE:How was the bathrooms? O.

LEADMALE:I can't sleep sitting up unless i'm at work.
LEADMALE:Well, there's not enough room back here, roseanne.
SUPMALE:There is so, jackie.

SUPMALE:He and i were just so close.
LEADMALE:Now i don't feel like i can trust him.
SUPFEMALE:That's what really stinks.
LEADFEMALE:What i can't understand is how mom didn't know about this for 20 years.
LEADMALE:This woman could hear me unwrapping a hershey bar up in my bedroom closet.
LEADMALE:He had a great cover.
OTHERFEMALE:He was a traveling salesman.
SUPMALE:He was on the road all the time.
LEADFEMALE:He had those hunting trips and fishing trips conventions.
LEADMALE:Yeah.

SUPFEMALE:Actually, it's your problem.
LEADFEMALE:I'm becky conner's father.

LEADFEMALE:No, i think it's-it's a bad idea.
LEADFEMALE:We should just go.
OTHERFEMALE:We came all this way.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see this woman.
LEADMALE:What are we going to say to her? Hello.
LEADMALE:Can i help you? Uh are you, uh, mrs.
LEADMALE:Felgred? No.
SUPFEMALE:You have the wrong apartment.

LEADMALE:Your mom called i wasn't sure you wanted her to know, so i said you were at the 7-eleven all day.
LEADMALE:Good thinking, dan.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to tell her, either.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's got somebody nice, and she's got nobody.
SUPMALE:I give her six months alone before she moves in here.
OTHERFEMALE:Where will i live, dear? You've got sauce on your chin.
LEADMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:I'm saving it for later.
SUPMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Becky ready yet? Becky! She'll be down in a minute.
LEADMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Hey, mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Uhhh.
SUPMALE:He comes in the back door like family? you guys buddies now? He's sitting on the couch.
LEADFEMALE:I hate when he does that.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gone one day and everything goes to hell.
SUPFEMALE:You'd have been proud of that kid today.
SUPMALE:Why? what did he do, volunteer for sterilization? No, he beat up becky's boss.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:The kid called her something nasty, and mark let him have it.
SUPFEMALE:That is so cool.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:How come you didn't beat up the creep? I would have, but i got there late.
SUPMALE:Aw, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you think i'm not sick about it? I had stuff to do at the shop.
LEADFEMALE:What's he got to do, smoke a cigarette? Of course he got there first.
SUPMALE:Oh, i'm sorry, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I know you would have did it if you could have.
LEADFEMALE:This is the first thing he's ever done to show he cares about her.
LEADFEMALE:I also had to make d.j. breakfast.
LEADMALE:Maybe you ought to throw him some more work, because maybe this guy is the guy.
LEADMALE:You beat him up? that's why he apologized? You can't walk in there like some dumb animal and beat up my boss.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:The guy called you-i know what he called me.
SUPMALE:I can take care of myself.
SUPFEMALE:Now his apology means nothing.
SUPFEMALE:I just thought-you didn't think.
SUPFEMALE:You never think.
OTHERFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, o.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, we'll be late for this party.
SUPMALE:Don't you get it? I'm not going with you to some stupid party.
SUPFEMALE:Now, get out! Fine.
OTHERMALE:See you, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I miss him already.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Come on now jackie, it's been like two hours.
LEADMALE:When are we going to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Be ready in a minute.
SUPMALE:Can me and dan have something to hold us while we're waiting, like a cracker or a ham? No.
SUPFEMALE:You'll ruin your appetite.
SUPMALE:God, i'm in here slaving away trying to make you guys a beautiful gourmet dinner.
LEADMALE:Can't you wait one minute? O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:One mississippi, two mississippi just get out.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe d.j. left some sugar pops in the couch.
SUPFEMALE:When? One minute she said.
LEADMALE:You know she's a liar, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she's trying to be nice.
SUPFEMALE:We'll just have to take it.
OTHERFEMALE:We're never going to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Just get a hold of yourself now.
SUPMALE:We just have to get our minds off food and we think of something else.
SUPFEMALE:I might get my christmas bonus tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I hope it's spaghetti.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you keep your spices? In the salt shaker.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:And is darlene going to eat with us? No.
LEADFEMALE:She usually just fixes herself a sandwich.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope i didn't make too much.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:You can't make too much.
LEADMALE:Just start cooking.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:Okey-doke.
LEADMALE:Leon told me to ask you if you want to be santa at the mall.
LEADMALE:And it pays and he had to go get a tetanus shot.
LEADMALE:Well, that's very tempting.
LEADMALE:That wouldn't happen to you.
LEADFEMALE:You're good with kids.
SUPMALE:Not ours, but other people's.
OTHERMALE:I got a shop to run.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene.
SUPMALE:Very good.
LEADMALE:We thought you were rotting in your room.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry to disappoint you.
SUPMALE:Where were you? I was out.
LEADFEMALE:Where? With a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Do we know her? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what's her name? Karen, o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? God.
LEADFEMALE:I have to account to you for everything? Get your own damn life and stay out of mine.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear what she said to us? Yeah.
LEADMALE:She's finally got a friend.
LEADMALE:And her name is karen.
LEADFEMALE:Karen.
SUPMALE:"hi, karen.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in, karen.
LEADMALE:"darlene's upstairs, karen.
LEADMALE:Love your nose ring, karen.
SUPMALE:" "say, are you naturally bald on one side of your head there, karen?" "can i hold your gun for you, karen?" it's not ready yet.
LEADFEMALE:You're done.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, it is.
LEADMALE:So, how was jackie's dinner? Oh, it was beautiful.
LEADMALE:These little midget chickens all laid down on this plate with little tiny baby vegetables all around it.
SUPMALE:It was just like a work of art.
LEADMALE:We ate it in nine seconds.
LEADFEMALE:That should teach her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she gets this way around the holidays-loving, caring, giving, annoying.
LEADMALE:Well, here you go, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Bonus time.
OTHERFEMALE:Just rodbell's little way of saying, "yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You work here, too.
LEADMALE:" i thought we were getting cash.
SUPFEMALE:A popular misconception.
LEADMALE:Merry christmas.
SUPMALE:This is gonna suck.
SUPMALE:And a happy new year.
LEADFEMALE:A rodbell's coffee mug? You're right.
SUPFEMALE:That does suck.
LEADFEMALE:What did you get, leon? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Cash again.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:What did you get, walter? I don't know, and i don't care.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not opening it on principle.
SUPMALE:This whole christmas thing is way out of hand.
SUPMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:It's unbelievable, it's not about peace on earth anymore.
LEADMALE:It's not about god.
LEADFEMALE:It's about buying grandma a clock radio even though she doesn't need it just because she sent you a cheese basket, which you gave to the mailman who really wanted scotch.
LEADMALE:I think we found our santa claus.
SUPFEMALE:I already told you, leon.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna be santa.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? It's $10 an hour.
SUPMALE:I heard they never found that last guy's finger.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:He's fine.
LEADMALE:He'll be able to hold a cup again by february.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, leon.
LEADFEMALE:If i don't find somebody soon, i'll have to throw that fat suit on myself.
LEADFEMALE:Did you ask dan? Yeah, but he can't do it.
LEADMALE:And we really need the money, too.
SUPMALE:Well, we need a mrs.
SUPMALE:Claus.
LEADFEMALE:What does she do? She gets the kids to stand in line, takes their photos, hands out the candy canes.
LEADMALE:Can you do that? for $10 an hour, pretend like i'm married to some fat guy that sits in his chair all the time? I can fake my way through it.
LEADMALE:What, the woman runs herself ragged for half the money as santa? Sorry.
SUPMALE:That's what's in the budget.
SUPMALE:Well, but that's discrimination.
LEADFEMALE:Why did we yell "burn our bras" and march on washington? why did mary tyler moore take her hat and toss it in the air? For 2.
LEADFEMALE:50 less than santa? I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:Well, there goes a few seconds of my life i'll never get back.
SUPFEMALE:I want $10 an hour.
LEADMALE:I can't change the budget, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Well, then, let me be santa.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I'm jolly.
LEADMALE:Oh, in that case, no.
LEADFEMALE:I want to be santa.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to be liza minnelli, but we don't always get what we want.
LEADFEMALE:Leon, santa's got to be a woman anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Who else would do so much for so little? Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Santa takes care of children.
LEADMALE:I do that all year.
LEADMALE:Let me love, care, and nurture.
SUPMALE:And pay me in cash so i don't have to declare it.
LEADMALE:I don't believe i'm doing this.
LEADMALE:You sure you don't want to be mrs.
LEADMALE:Claus? No.
SUPMALE:It's a stupid, thankless menial job that nobody even cares about.
OTHERFEMALE:That would be just perfect for jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you ready? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Is my beard on straight? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Can you see my boobs? No.
SUPMALE:No boobs.
SUPMALE:So, santa, what do you think of your wife here? Well, i must have married you before this christmas thing made me a big star.
LEADMALE:You're a pig.
LEADMALE:Ho ho ho.
LEADFEMALE:Well, kids.
SUPMALE:Hiya.
SUPFEMALE:My, you've all grown since i saw you last year.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Santa can't wait to talk to you.
SUPMALE:But before he does, my dear wife mrs.
OTHERMALE:Claus would like to tell you just what we'll do.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Listen up.
SUPMALE:This is the procedure.
LEADFEMALE:You step up to the lap, you state your christmas wish.
SUPMALE:Get your candy cane, your photo, and you leave the lap.
LEADFEMALE:Any deviation from this procedure will result in loss of candy cane.
LEADMALE:Remember, possession of cane is a privilege, not a right.
LEADMALE:Nobody gets bit on my beat.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:, sally, santa's just as afraid of you as you are of him.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want? Go ahead, sally.
SUPFEMALE:Ask for that heidi homemaker vacuum cleaner and the little suzy steam iron.
LEADMALE:Is that what you want, sally? And tell santa that you want those ballet slippers.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Tell him that you want to be a prima ballerina like we talked about.
SUPFEMALE:Tell him.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, would you mind pliã©ing your butt behind the rope so sally and i can have a chat? You know, that's o.
SUPMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:, sally.
LEADMALE:Santa's mom wanted him to be a ballerina, too, but santa did just what he wanted to do, and now he's his own boss.
LEADMALE:He works one day a year, and he's way more famous than even michael jackson.
SUPMALE:What do you want to be? Maybe i can help you find a toy to get you there.
LEADFEMALE:I want to be a dentist and a cow.
SUPFEMALE:Smile.
LEADFEMALE:Remember this? Well, jason, santa sees an awful lot of teddy bears.
SUPFEMALE:You gave it to me last year.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's 'cause you were such a good boy.
LEADFEMALE:I hate it.
LEADMALE:I wrote you a letter asking for a truck.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Claus.
LEADMALE:Come here a minute, please.
LEADMALE:There seems to be some mix-up.
LEADFEMALE:I never got jason's letter.
SUPMALE:I want you to find the elf responsible for this and fire him immediately.
LEADMALE:He's gone.
SUPMALE:He's history.
SUPFEMALE:Right away, santa.
LEADMALE:Happy now, jason? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Then smile.
LEADFEMALE:So does little ed want to tell santa what he want for christmas? Well, he like to stay with his auntie roseanne for a whole weekend so his mommy and daddy can go away together.
OTHERMALE:Crystal, i already got you a limited edition rodbell's coffee mug.
OTHERMALE:Give it a rest so i can talk to the kid here.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, little ed, little ed a new nightie, big dangling earrings, and a 3-speed hair dryer.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And a bottle of that submission perfume.
LEADFEMALE:The big size, because rodbell's will give me a free umbrella with that.
LEADFEMALE:Got it.
SUPMALE:Give that to your dad and give santa a big kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mom.
LEADMALE:Here we go, jimmy.
LEADMALE:Jackie, this kid wasn't next.
LEADMALE:Sure he was.
LEADFEMALE:He was way back in line.
SUPFEMALE:He gave me a buck.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, santa doesn't believe in you either.
SUPFEMALE:Ow.
SUPFEMALE:My ear.
LEADFEMALE:Ow.
LEADFEMALE:Quit it.
SUPMALE:Ow.
SUPMALE:My ear.
LEADMALE:Ow.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Good, isn't it? All right.
LEADFEMALE:There's a life saver in there.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Kid.
LEADMALE:Get away from that camera.
LEADMALE:You hear me? Get away from that camera! Oh, come on up here.
SUPMALE:Ahh! All righty.
LEADFEMALE:What's your name? Sammy, and i've been good.
LEADMALE:Oh, a kid that knows the drill.
LEADFEMALE:I like that.
LEADMALE:What can i get for you? A bb gun.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm sorry, but santa's fresh out of guns this year.
LEADMALE:Ah, come on, santa, see i don't have a dad, and i need a gun to protect the house.
LEADFEMALE:You do, too, have a dad.
OTHERMALE:Jeez.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you fibbed to santa.
SUPMALE:You're getting clothes.
LEADMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:Well, santa, usually he's a pretty good boy, so i think maybe a sled would be o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:You just remember this-i know when you're sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:I know when you're awake.
LEADMALE:You step out of line one more time, you'll wake up christmas morning knee-deep in sweaters.
SUPMALE:Now, smile.
OTHERMALE:Go get your candy cane.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe he did that right in front of me.
LEADMALE:Well, we all lie sometimes, like, for instance, i'm not really santa claus.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene told me.
SUPMALE:Are you one of darlene's teachers? No.
LEADMALE:I own the bookstore on third street.
SUPMALE:Darlene comes in a lot.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm karen miller.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're karen? I already gave you a candy cane, sammy.
SUPFEMALE:Did not.
LEADMALE:I did, too! Uh, well, i better go.
LEADFEMALE:It was nice to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:Do you believe that kid? what's the matter? remember i told you darlene had that new friend karen? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Is that her mom? No.
LEADMALE:That's her.
OTHERMALE:You're kidding.
SUPMALE:I thought she'd be younger.
OTHERMALE:Well, duh, jackie.
OTHERMALE:Well, so what? Well, maybe she's the reason darlene's all weird, you know.
LEADMALE:Look, she's all in black.
LEADMALE:Darlene dresses all in black.
SUPMALE:She owns a bookstore.
SUPMALE:Darlene's been doing all this reading lately.
LEADMALE:It's not a cult.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to you being happy that darlene even had a friend? This friend's supposed to be 15 with a retainer and a bad attitude.
SUPFEMALE:The kind of kid you want to smack.
LEADFEMALE:That's what i was hoping for.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Remember me? Uh fat guy, beard, at the mall.
SUPMALE:Oh, mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Um how's sammy? We're fighting.
SUPMALE:I told him to clean his room.
LEADMALE:He said he couldn't hear me because he was born deaf.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's pretty good for his age.
SUPMALE:I'll be glad when he's out of this lying phase.
SUPFEMALE:Is he your only kid? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I got three.
LEADFEMALE:It's not a phase.
LEADMALE:It's a nice shop.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:I can't compete with big chains, so i mostly sell the hard-to-find stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene's my worst customer, always comes in, sits in the back, reads, never buys anything.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She got that from me.
LEADMALE:I taught her to eat dinner in the supermarket.
LEADFEMALE:She's not bothering you, is she? oh, are you kidding? No.
SUPFEMALE:She's a real pleasure.
LEADMALE:That's just how her father and i describe her at home.
OTHERMALE:You know, karen, i came over here 'cause i wanted to, uh you want to talk about the star trek convention, right? Well, we can start there.
LEADFEMALE:I was going to bring it up at the store, but you were kind of crazed.
LEADMALE:She wouldn't miss any school.
OTHERFEMALE:She got so excited when i mentioned it.
LEADFEMALE:My husband and i would love to take sammy.
LEADMALE:She's so good with him.
SUPMALE:We figured she'd watch him at night.
SUPMALE:I understand why you said no, but my husband and i are perfectly normal people who just happen to dress up like romulans once or twice a year.
OTHERMALE:Well, i didn't exactly say no.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, great.
LEADFEMALE:I wish you'd think about it.
OTHERMALE:She's just so excited.
LEADFEMALE:She's so into science fiction now.
LEADMALE:Look at the stuff she's writing.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd really like to.
OTHERFEMALE:You got any of it laying around? uh, what do you mean? She hasn't shown you any of them.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, maybe, you know, she's testing them out on me before she shows them to you.
LEADFEMALE:That's a nice try, but i don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? well, i met karen at the mall and-you just can't you stay out of my life can you? No.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you're spying on me.
SUPMALE:I can't believe a lot of things either, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:It would probably be easier to pretend i'm not here if i'm not here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how come you didn't tell me that karen's my age? Well, that's none of your business.
LEADFEMALE:What is my business, darlene to find out why i'm not letting you go to this star trek convention you never told me about? If you knew you'd have come here and embarrassed me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm here anyway.
SUPMALE:I want to know why she knows more about you than i do? why can you talk to her and not me? why does she get to read your writing and i don't? Because you'd laugh, make a joke out of it.
LEADFEMALE:I would not laugh.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't laugh at your poem.
SUPFEMALE:Two years ago, you put it on the refrigerator.
SUPFEMALE:It was cute.
LEADFEMALE:I was proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not cute anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, believe me, darlene.
LEADMALE:Nobody knows that better than i do.
LEADFEMALE:What if i don't believe in god and write that? would you put that on the refrigerator? you don't believe in god now? Maybe.
LEADMALE:Well, who do you think created, you know, the final frontier, the place where no man's ever gone before? Who do you think did that, james t.
LEADMALE:Kirk, huh? Typical.
OTHERMALE:Do a joke.
LEADMALE:Well, you've got it all figured out, don't you? When i was 15, i was sure that i knew it all, too.
SUPMALE:We're not talking about you! we're talking about me! i'll never be like you! It's too late, darlene.
LEADMALE:You are exactly like me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:You have to have the total last word, just like i did.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Right! Right.
LEADMALE:Right, right, right, right, right, right.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Hey, becky, what's doing? Oh, everything.
SUPFEMALE:What does that mean? Mark gave me my christmas present a little early.
LEADMALE:What did he give you? Aah! aah! aah! Dad, i'm kidding.
SUPFEMALE:I got it out of a gumball machine.
SUPFEMALE:It's a joke.
LEADMALE:Don't you ever do that again.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you'd laugh.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:That was not funny.
OTHERFEMALE:That was cruel.
LEADMALE:Ooh, here comes your mom.
LEADFEMALE:Do it to her.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:What? Maybe later.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what's with you? Well, i just met karen.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene's friend? Yeah.
LEADMALE:What's she like? Well, she has a 5-year-old.
LEADMALE:Was she a senior? No.
LEADMALE:She's my age.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:No, and that ain't all either.
LEADMALE:Did you know that darlene likes to write short stories and darlene likes to go to star trek conventions, and, well, when she's around karen, darlene's just a pleasure.
LEADMALE:Well, that ain't fair.
SUPMALE:It's like she's living some kind of a double life.
LEADMALE:That's two more than we thought she had.
SUPFEMALE:I guess that's good for darlene and everything, that she's got somebody to talk to.
OTHERMALE:Well, this woman's o.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She's really nice.
LEADFEMALE:I liked her, but i just feel really left out.
OTHERFEMALE:She gets the darlene that i want, the one that writes and talks and does stuff.
LEADMALE:I get the grunting brat that-pss.
LEADMALE:Pss.
SUPFEMALE:Pss.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What's that? Well, i guess it's something that darlene wrote, so i guess i do get a christmas bonus after all.
LEADMALE:What does your mom do when you get in trouble, she yell at you? Usually, she just says not to do it again.
SUPFEMALE:Then you do it again, right? Ha ha ha.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Then you never do it again? well you totally mind what your mom says? That's pretty amazing.
SUPMALE:Did you when you were little? No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I never minded.
SUPMALE:That's why i'm a huge star now.
OTHERMALE:
LEADMALE:Now little ed, mommy and auntie roseanne are going to play bingo.
LEADFEMALE:Becky and darlene will be looking after you.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene, remember what to do if the baby starts spitting up? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I give him to becky.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm making a horrible mistake.
LEADMALE:Crystal, we'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:I left two bottles in the fridge.
LEADMALE:And we heat them first.
LEADFEMALE:Don't heat them in the microwave 'cause i heard it's dangerous for the baby.
OTHERMALE:Only if the baby's still hanging on to it.
LEADMALE:And--and be careful of his soft spot.
LEADMALE:He's got a soft spot here.
LEADFEMALE:We better not find anything stuck in that head that's not supposed to be there when we get back.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you help your sister out, or she's going to keep all the money.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:I feed, you wipe.
SUPFEMALE:You got the numbers to the bingo hall and the doctor's service.
SUPMALE:Call if you have any questions.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, bye, honey.
LEADMALE:We won't be gone too long.
LEADMALE:Everything's going to be all right.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, crystal, don't you think it's time you cut the cord already? It's important to talk to your children, roseanne.
LEADMALE:They are people, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you come up with this stuff? N-41.
LEADFEMALE:N-41.
OTHERMALE:B-11.
LEADFEMALE:B-11.
SUPMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure we're old enough to get in here? This looks like where people go when they can't play shuffleboard no more.
OTHERFEMALE:N-34.
SUPFEMALE:N-34.
SUPFEMALE:You're messing with us, right? They got naked male strippers behind the door over there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Let's give it a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Maybe they got cake.
LEADFEMALE:It so happens i know a woman who won $75 here the other night.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? did she retire or keep going to work every day just like nothing happened? G-50.
SUPFEMALE:G-50.
OTHERMALE:Boy, i bet this guy does a mean i-22.
LEADMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, what's the deal? Cards are $2.
LEADMALE:00 apiece.
LEADMALE:You're kidding me? Roseanne, please, they know me here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, sister.
LEADMALE:We could've gone to a movie for 5 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's for charity.
SUPMALE:The money goes to needy families.
LEADMALE:Oh, o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:Well, then i guess we get reimbursed.
LEADFEMALE:New game.
LEADMALE:Straight bingo.
LEADMALE:$35 jackpot.
SUPMALE:I-17.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:That's too close.
SUPFEMALE:Too close to what? My area.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see? I'm all set up here.
LEADMALE:Sorry! what's this for? Aah! Don't you touch this.
LEADFEMALE:Don't touch anything of mine.
LEADFEMALE:You'll jinx me.
LEADFEMALE:Are you a good witch or a bad witch? I won 200 bucks over at the methodist place last friday, so shut up! I-17.
LEADFEMALE:Bingo! I hate new people.
LEADMALE:I hear you.
SUPMALE:B-5.
LEADMALE:Oh, darn.
SUPMALE:You know what your problem is? You only got $2,000 worth of cards there.
LEADMALE:I think you need more.
LEADMALE:I think maybe you need to go find another seat.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I think i'm falling in love with you.
LEADMALE:N-32.
LEADMALE:N-32.
LEADMALE:Coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, crystal, you woke me up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god, i am so bored.
LEADMALE:You know, i think i'm starting to miss my husband.
LEADMALE:Hey, i vote we don't let crystal pick what we do on our nights out anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry you're all having such a terrible time.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, crystal, it's really not that bad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, we're just whining and moaning to keep from passing out.
SUPMALE:B-14.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, if you're not enjoying yourself, you're free to go whenever you like.
LEADFEMALE:No, i can't.
LEADFEMALE:You're my ride.
SUPFEMALE:You never complain when bonnie or anne marie pick what we do, but when it's my turn, you jump all over me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting a brownie.
LEADMALE:Whoa, what's with her? Apparently, your friends don't like you very much either.
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you there's something wrong.
OTHERMALE:Well, change his diaper again.
SUPMALE:I just changed it.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you did it wrong.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you gave my little baby a wedgie.
LEADFEMALE:That's not it.
OTHERFEMALE:Does his color look right to you? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What color was he when he got here? what are you doing? I'm trying to calm him down.
SUPMALE:Well, does this calm you down, you moron? Well, gee, i'm sorry, becky.
SUPMALE:What would you like me to do? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm going to call crystal.
SUPMALE:Oh, grow up.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? The baby won't stop crying, and he cheesed my shirt.
LEADMALE:We tried everything.
LEADMALE:Just relax.
LEADMALE:I've changed him a hundred times, and i feed him every 15 minutes.
OTHERMALE:Now you know why you had to change him so much.
SUPMALE:He might be warm.
LEADMALE:Should we take him to the hospital? Let the old doctor take a look here.
LEADFEMALE:You cutting a tooth there, little ed? Yeah, he's teething, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , see if there's any frozen waffles in the freezer.
OTHERMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:Crystal's list didn't say anything about frozen waffles.
LEADMALE:That's because she doesn't know the secret.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Chew on this for a while, little ed.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it's going to make those gums feel better.
LEADMALE:Mmm ugh.
SUPFEMALE:He's slobbering.
LEADFEMALE:That's why i use a waffle-it's got all those built-in drool cups.
SUPFEMALE:You don't need a bib.
LEADMALE:Oh, gross.
LEADFEMALE:I can't watch this.
LEADMALE:You don't listen to them, little ed.
LEADMALE:You go ahead and dribble.
SUPMALE:You're a conner man.
SUPMALE:N-39.
OTHERFEMALE:N-39.
LEADFEMALE:Got it.
SUPMALE:Got it.
LEADMALE:Got it.
LEADMALE:Ooh, got it.

SUPFEMALE:O-75.
LEADMALE:Yep.

SUPFEMALE:Now we're movin'.

SUPFEMALE:O great spirit of bingo, i've given you my first-born child.
SUPMALE:Now you must give me my number! N-44.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha ha.
OTHERMALE:N-44.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, pull back, baby.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm just having some fun with endora here.
LEADFEMALE:Give me that.
SUPFEMALE:Give me that! I cannot believe the phone at your house is still busy, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, crystal, don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Either the girls are on the phone with their friends, or, you know, they're holding for 911.
LEADMALE:I don't find that funny.
LEADMALE:Oh, lighten up, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:He's fine.
SUPFEMALE:He's 9 months old, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:I worry about him.
LEADFEMALE:That's what good mothers do.
SUPFEMALE:If you're such a good mother, then why did you leave him with my kids? B-10.
OTHERMALE:B-10.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, you been marking my cards? Well, i thought, you know, anne marie was doing it.
LEADMALE:She asked you to do it.
SUPFEMALE:Did you get anything? Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:Look at the board.
LEADMALE:B-14.
LEADMALE:B-14.
LEADMALE:I only asked you-bingo! i got bingo! i got bingo! yes! yes! yes! yes! All right, everyone hold your cards until we verify the bingo.
LEADMALE:Ha! Where are you going? I'm changing my seat.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're good luck for me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm coming with you.
LEADMALE:Get away from me! i can't stand you! we have a bingo! Here's your voucher.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You collect your money on the way out.
LEADMALE:The cashier's at the door.
OTHERFEMALE:Great! 50 bucks! Happy bingo dance.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, i'm beat.
LEADFEMALE:I'm leaving.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:No! Roseanne, i don't want to play anymore.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to.
SUPMALE:Just sit here and watch me win.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, crystal will stay with me then.
SUPMALE:Where is she? Maybe she went to the bathroom again.
SUPMALE:Her purse and coat are gone.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't see her leave.
SUPFEMALE:She's my ride.
LEADMALE:Why would she leave me? Maybe that's her little way of ditching you.
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Now i got to quit and find out what the hell's the matter with her.
LEADMALE:You take her.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to.
LEADMALE:She's on your way.
LEADMALE:She won 50 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:She can take a cab.
LEADFEMALE:One of you is taking me home.
LEADMALE:I ain't taking you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Where's roseanne? Still at bingo.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, little ed.
LEADMALE:Did you miss me, honey? did you eat? did you take a little nap? Good to see he isn't talking to you, either.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought he was snubbing me.
SUPFEMALE:Where's becky and darlene? I'm supposed to pay them.
SUPFEMALE:Pay d.j. he fed little ed, he played with him, he even gave him his old bear.
SUPMALE:That's wonderful, d.j. here's $5.
LEADMALE:00 for being such a responsible young man.
LEADFEMALE:All right! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Go show your sisters.
SUPMALE:Make sure you rub that in real good.
LEADMALE:How come you didn't bring roseanne home with you? I left early.
OTHERMALE:How's she going to get home? I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me you two had a fight.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:, dan, i won't.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to know anything, so you don't have to do anything about it.
LEADFEMALE:Just like your father.
LEADFEMALE:So was it tequila night down at st.
LEADMALE:Benedict's? hey! Why did you leave me down there? You were in your glory, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to interrupt.
LEADMALE:Cut the crap, crystal.
LEADMALE:So what's your problem? Forget it.
LEADMALE:I was having a great time down there-oh, how about that? I thought playing bingo was just another one of crystal's stupid ideas.
OTHERMALE:After i won 50 bucks, it got funner.
LEADMALE:Are you going to retire, or will you go to your job tomorrow like nothing happened? I was just teasing.
LEADFEMALE:That's the way we are.
LEADMALE:It's the way you are, always have been.
LEADMALE:Ever since high school, everything i do is stupid.
LEADMALE:Everything i say is stupid.
LEADMALE:Even the way i raise my kids is stupid.
LEADFEMALE:You're way overexaggerating now.
OTHERMALE:When you're not telling me how stupid i am, you're criticizing me or making fun of me, and when you're not doing that you're just ignoring me.
LEADFEMALE:I do not ignore you.
SUPMALE:How long did it take before you'd realized that i left the bingo parlor? O.
OTHERMALE:K.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:"i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:" that's supposed to make up for 20 years.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? Crystal's mad.
LEADMALE:I've never seen her like that, ever.
LEADMALE:She yelled at me, and i was being adorable.
SUPMALE:You really must have done something to tick her off.
SUPMALE:I swear i didn't do anything.
SUPMALE:Come on, roseanne, what did you do? Dan i did not treat her any different than i always do.
LEADMALE:Well, you better go apologize then.
LEADFEMALE:If she had some complaint against the way i've been treating her all these years, how come she waits till now to say something? I'm easy to talk to.
OTHERFEMALE:I listen.
OTHERMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, i'll call her tomorrow and apologize.
LEADFEMALE:That a girl.
SUPFEMALE:How was bingo? Man, it was incredible.
SUPMALE:It was such a rush.
LEADMALE:Yeah? did you win? Uh, no.
SUPFEMALE:If crystal's not returning your calls, then you should see her.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Why should i? Hey, louise.
OTHERMALE:Because you're upset.
LEADMALE:No, i'm not upset.
LEADMALE:She's the one that's upset.
LEADFEMALE:I've been a very good friend to crystal ever since the eighth grade.
SUPFEMALE:I've been with her through four husbands.
LEADMALE:Hey, peg.
LEADMALE:Yo, ro.
LEADMALE:And when she decided she was getting married to dan's dad, i put the entire wedding together, did i not? Hey, lloyd.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know these people? I've been playing the church circuit here.
SUPMALE:This here's the best game.
LEADFEMALE:It's got the big pots, and the numbers come fast.
OTHERFEMALE:Stick close to me 'cause things could get hairy.
LEADMALE:Hairy? this is the game where you put the bean on the card, right? hey! Arnie, what are you doing here? I'm going to be the caller.
LEADMALE:Ha! You're kidding me.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:There's lots of money in bingo.
SUPMALE:The problem is all the callers are boring.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll make it fun.
LEADFEMALE:I'll become a celebrity.
LEADMALE:Then i'll become mr.
LEADMALE:Bingo.
LEADFEMALE:Then i'll open my own indian reservation and make a hell of a lot of money.
SUPMALE:What do you think about that? Well, let's start with you're not an indian.
LEADFEMALE:I'll convert.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to thank you for volunteering to do this.
SUPMALE:Anything i can do for the community, padre.
LEADMALE:I saw the sign outside, and it only says "bingo.
OTHERFEMALE:" how are people going to know i'm here? That man saw you naked.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
SUPFEMALE:You think you spent enough money on bingo cards? I did not come to lose.
OTHERMALE:You are getting very weird here, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I am not.
OTHERMALE:What's with all the lighters? They're just sort of, you know, for luck.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're kidding me.
LEADMALE:No, everybody does it.
SUPFEMALE:It's just for fun.
SUPMALE:It doesn't mean nothing.
LEADMALE:It's not like i need them or anything.
OTHERMALE:You can take one if you want.
LEADMALE:Not the yellow one! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
SUPMALE:Welcome to bingo night here at the fabulous st.
LEADMALE:Benny's.
LEADMALE:I'm your host and caller arnie thomas, reminding you that even though you're in the presence of the savior, don't save your money because it goes to charity.
SUPMALE:Just call the numbers.
SUPMALE:Coming right up.
LEADMALE:But before i call out this number, are there any honeymooners in the crowd tonight? Being here at bingo reminds me of a funny story.
SUPMALE:Let's go! O.
OTHERMALE:K.
SUPMALE:, all right! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:I-27! i-27! Hell, i only got that on three cards.
OTHERFEMALE:Wouldn't it be really funny if we both yelled out "bingo" right now? Oh, that would be so beyond dumb, jackie.
LEADMALE:Come on, arnie.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, arnie.
LEADMALE:Come on, arnie.
OTHERMALE:B-6! b-6! That's better.
LEADFEMALE:You are scary.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm trying to concentrate.

LEADFEMALE:O-70.
SUPFEMALE:Just kidding! it's actually 1-17! bingo humor! i'm working the room! excuse me! I have seen you like this before.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, you're addicted.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please! No, i'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:You've spent the last five nights at bingo.
LEADFEMALE:So? When you started smoking again, you were doing two packs a day in a week.
SUPMALE:It's the same thing.
LEADMALE:Oh, get out of here.
LEADMALE:It's just about having fun.
SUPFEMALE:You're hooked! admit it! bingo is fun! no, it's not! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! O.
SUPMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:, that was fun.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, little ed.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Look what you left over at my house the other day.
LEADMALE:That's real nice of you, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for dropping that by.
SUPMALE:Well you know, i just-i didn't want it to look like i just came over to apologize, you know.
LEADMALE:I mean, i--i could've brought your blender back, but it's broken.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, i'm sorry i didn't call you back all this time.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, let's not do this anymore, o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, crystal? We've been friends for too long.
OTHERMALE:Yes, we have.
LEADMALE:I was thinking about what you said.
LEADMALE:And you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I make fun of you too much.
OTHERMALE:I won't anymore.
SUPMALE:I promise.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! Of course you will.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to.
SUPMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:Roseanne i'm pregnant again.
LEADFEMALE:Is this a test? Oh, wow.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, wow.
LEADMALE:That's why i got so crazy on you.
LEADFEMALE:My hormones sort of have a mouth of their own.
LEADMALE:Well, why didn't you tell me? 'cause you were being a big, stupid jerk.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's your hormones talking again, huh? I can't believe it.
OTHERMALE:We were using birth control.
OTHERFEMALE:And--and i wasn't getting my time of the month since i've been nursing, and all of a sudden, i started getting symptoms, and why did this happen to me, roseanne? Oh, crystal.
OTHERMALE:I got a 9-month-old baby and a husband who's never home and a teenage son who's real hard to love a lot of the time.
SUPMALE:And look at this place.
LEADFEMALE:How am i going to deal with another baby? Well maybe this one will be the girl you always wanted.
LEADMALE:Maybe.
SUPMALE:I wish ed was around to help a little more.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i think ed's done enough.
LEADFEMALE:You know, me and dan are here for you, crystal, and so is becky and darlene, even though they don't kind of know it yet.
LEADMALE:I mean, even d.j. can help out, you know.
LEADMALE:Everything will be fine, crystal.
SUPMALE:You'll see.
SUPMALE:Thank you, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Ohh want some decaf? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:That would be great.
LEADMALE:Oh, little ed, you sit up.
LEADMALE:I did try to call you back last night.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:I was out playing bingo.
LEADFEMALE:Again? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I've been playing most every night, you know, but this saturday, that's the big game.
OTHERMALE:And then that's it.
OTHERMALE:I'm quitting on sunday.
LEADMALE:Monday, for sure.
LEADMALE:Down came the rain and washed the spider out up come the sun-hey.
LEADMALE:Yo.
SUPMALE:Where's roseanne? One guess.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:You're kidding! We were supposed to go to a movie.
LEADMALE:It was weird.
OTHERMALE:We were watching television, and this commercial for this cereal came on.
SUPFEMALE:The guy talked about all the vitamins it had-b-1, b-6, b-12 i turned around, and she was gone.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, we have a problem.
LEADFEMALE:People who get addicted to this type of stuff, they change.
SUPMALE:They become completely different people.
LEADMALE:I-18.
SUPMALE:I-18.
LEADFEMALE:N-38.
SUPMALE:N-38.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all i need.
LEADFEMALE:One more number.
LEADMALE:N-38.
LEADMALE:N ohh! Grab her.
LEADMALE:Hold her.
LEADFEMALE:Hug her.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her that you love her.
LEADFEMALE:It's for your own good, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:It's o.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:, folks.
SUPFEMALE:I only need one more number! 
LEADMALE:Damn.
SUPMALE:This lane is definitely warped.
LEADMALE:Dan now you're hooking the ball.
LEADMALE:You gotta take some spin off.
SUPFEMALE:I know exactly how much spin i need, arnie.
SUPFEMALE:The spin's related to how much wax on the alleys.
LEADFEMALE:It's a matter of physics.
SUPMALE:Jeez! Oh, i think you forgot to account for the curvature of the earth.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going for a beer.
LEADMALE:How else wants one? You'll get bloated and bowl like a duck.
LEADMALE:My average is five points higher than yours, man.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying i'm the reason we're in last place in the league? Well, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:What about the other two guys? They say it, too.
SUPFEMALE:How can two grownups argue over nothing? Well, you're new to this marriage business.
LEADFEMALE:You'll catch on.
SUPMALE:How's married life treating you? It's o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:My parents came over for dinner last weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Everything was going fine until dessert when arnie asked my mom if she cut one.
LEADMALE:Men.
SUPFEMALE:If they have to ask, you know it's them.
LEADFEMALE:Ohman, my back is not good.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to skip it.
LEADMALE:Just put me down for a spare.
SUPFEMALE:I'm putting myself down, too.
LEADMALE:Mom, i need more quarters for the video games.
SUPFEMALE:Just take it out of your allowance.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't want to come here! you made me! You begged me.
SUPFEMALE:Did, too! did not! mom! All right.
SUPMALE:That is it! It's quality time.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, deej, how's my best buddy in the whole world? O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Run along now, son.
LEADMALE:Boy, that's a cute kid.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:No more beer for arnie.
OTHERMALE:Kind of makes you think, don't it, nancy? Tick, tick, tick, tick.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, rose.
SUPFEMALE:A spare.
SUPMALE:Very good.
LEADMALE:Well, i learned everything i know from you, honey.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you give yourself a strike? 'cause the lane's warped.
LEADMALE:Hey, i'm up.
LEADFEMALE:What's all this tick, tick, tick stuff? Arnie's on my back to have a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe one of these days, he'll get it right.
LEADFEMALE:I hope not.
SUPMALE:I don't want to walk around with a bowling ball in my belly for nine months.
SUPFEMALE:You also got to carry around two of them in your bra for a year and a half.
SUPMALE:Between the gutters, arnie.
LEADMALE:Between the gutters, huh? Funny, frank.
SUPMALE:He's just trying to psych you out.
LEADMALE:What was that all about? His team's in 9th place, we're in 10th, so he thinks he's better than us.
LEADFEMALE:Calm down.
LEADMALE:Wait till saturday night.
LEADFEMALE:We'll show him who's worse.
SUPMALE:God, what difference does it make? Oh, they have some really intelligent league tradition that the last-place guys have to drink beer out of their bowling shoes.
OTHERFEMALE:Yecchh.
LEADFEMALE:Really, it didn't taste that bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hey, you guys.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What are you guys doing here? I'm playing back there in the bar this weekend.
SUPFEMALE:We're checking out the room.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have to go see you.
SUPFEMALE:Is there a cover charge? Not for my personal friends.
SUPFEMALE:Or anybody else.
LEADFEMALE:It would be great if you guys could be there.
SUPFEMALE:We could all take turns requesting harper valley pta.
SUPMALE:I think i need a new groupie here.
LEADMALE:See you guys later.
LEADMALE:Yeah, saturday night.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, rosie, you're up.
LEADMALE:What do you want us to put this frame? I'm really going to go for it this time.
LEADMALE:Stand back.
OTHERFEMALE:Here she comes! Do it, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:Knock them down.
LEADMALE:I certainly will.
LEADMALE:I'm going to kill them.
LEADMALE:There will be nothing left but dust.
SUPMALE:I plan to completely pulverize them with my pretty pink ball.
LEADMALE:She gets a good arc.
LEADFEMALE:What did i get this time? I'm giving you another spare.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i'm being really consistent.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe this, mark is an hour and a half late.
OTHERMALE:Where in the hell is he? Well, it's pretty dark out.
LEADMALE:I mean, maybe he thinks he's asleep.
LEADMALE:Mother, shut her up.
LEADMALE:At least wait until your sister's out of the room.
LEADFEMALE:God, i'm not just going to sit around and wait for him.
SUPMALE:Who does he think he is? Don't, darlene.
LEADMALE:Dan, are you going to read us the funny parts? This guy's paying me to service his snowmobiles.
OTHERFEMALE:I figure i should know what one looks like.
OTHERMALE:You said it was like a motorcycle on skis.
OTHERFEMALE:Apparently i lied.
LEADMALE:You can do it, right? If i don't have to do drywall, i can do anything.
LEADMALE:Ah-choo! Why don't you just vomit on my plate? Come here, you.
LEADMALE:You know, you've been sneezing all day.
SUPFEMALE:Let me feel your head here.
LEADMALE:I'm o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:You don't have a fever, but i don't want you to go to the bowling alley tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll just run around and get more sick.
OTHERMALE:No, i won't.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're going to stay home.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, darlene, can you sit with him? No, i'm going out.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? You never go out.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then i feel i should be encouraged to do so.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:No, i can't.
SUPMALE:I already told you.
OTHERMALE:I'm helping karen take inventory.
LEADMALE:She's paying me o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:See ya.
SUPFEMALE:Phone.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Let me.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? Oh, hi, nancy.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie? No, jackie's not here.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i am.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, she is.
SUPFEMALE:I told nancy to try here if i wasn't home.
LEADMALE:When did you start talking to nancy? Give me the phone.
LEADMALE:Nance? Hi! I just walked in.
LEADMALE:Maybe jackie could baby-sit.
SUPFEMALE:Shh, shh.
LEADMALE:I can't overhear what they're saying.
LEADFEMALE:If i find them tonight, i'll bring them.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i'll see you there.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Is there a box of my stuff in your garage? Yeah, a couple.
LEADMALE:What are you looking for? Just my old ice skates.
OTHERMALE:I'm giving them to nancy.
LEADFEMALE:We're going ice-skating on tuesday.
LEADFEMALE:Like, you're all chummy with her after you had some affair with her husband? That was not an affair, that was a one-night mistake.
LEADFEMALE:And they weren't even engaged at the time.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, she and i talked it through, and everything's fine between us.
LEADMALE:How come jackie and nancy are going out and having some great time, and they don't even think to invite me? what does it matter, dear? Because she's my friend, and she's my sister.
LEADFEMALE:They're going to plan to have some great time together, and they're not even thinking to invite me.
SUPMALE:If it wasn't for me, they wouldn't even know each other.
LEADMALE:There is the whole sordid arnie connection, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, yeah, right.
OTHERFEMALE:Like they're getting together to some little "i slept with arnie" fan club that i can't even be a member of.
LEADMALE:You know what i mean.
LEADFEMALE:Smoke blowin' down from a cabin on the hill smoke blowin' down in the street some kind of sweet-smellin' mystical backdrop to the story unfoldin' at my feet used to walk around with my eyes on fire my nerves real close to my skin shut the door! i had a fist full of questions and a brand on my cheek and we would skate where the ice got thin whoo! oh, whoa! Thank you.
LEADMALE:All right! yeah! I'd like to introduce the band.
LEADMALE:Hank, pete that's jackie, that's nancy, that's roseanne, and you know bonnie, right? you girls got any requests? how about doing the dishes? I don't know that one.
LEADMALE:How about a nice romantic dinner? I'm so hungry.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Band's going out for a chili dog.
SUPMALE:We'll return in five minutes.
LEADFEMALE:He's good.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell him that.
SUPMALE:He'll want to go on the road, and that's no good.
LEADMALE:All those beautiful young girls bouncing up and down saying, "get off the stage, grandpa.
OTHERFEMALE:" i love him way too much to let that happen.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
SUPMALE:I thought you were with d.j. tonight.
SUPMALE:Mark never showed up, so becky's there.
LEADMALE:I really like bonnie.
LEADMALE:She's great.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, she's cool.
SUPFEMALE:Let's invite her to go ice-skating with us tuesday.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Great.

LEADMALE:J.
OTHERMALE:, ready for another beer? Yeah, sure.
SUPMALE:Yo, booze guy, a couple more! I like beer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Make it three.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, j.
SUPMALE:Is something wrong? No, nothing's wrong.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:My, my, my, my.
OTHERMALE:Oh, girl, you are so bad.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just looking.
OTHERMALE:You know i'm totally devoted to turning arnie into something i can live with.
LEADMALE:But that doesn't mean i can't look.
LEADFEMALE:Back me up, rosie.
SUPMALE:You still look, don't you? After you get a few kids, every time you look at a man, all's you see is more kids.
SUPMALE:See? That's exactly what we were talking about.
LEADMALE:Yeah, really.
SUPMALE:What? Arnie is begging her to have a kid.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, jackie.
SUPMALE:Jackie was so great.
OTHERMALE:No, now, i didn't tell you anything you didn't already know.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, but i already made up my mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not rushing into anything.
OTHERMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:You were talking to jackie about kids? is that wrong? Welljackie doesn't even have any kids.
LEADMALE:I mean, if anybody should be telling you not to have kids, i think it should be me.
SUPMALE:You're sure you're o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we weren't really talking about having kids.
LEADFEMALE:We were talking about our careers and how kids would get in the way right now.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, then that's cool, talking to jackie about careers.
LEADMALE:I mean, after all, she has had more than anybody else in the world.
LEADFEMALE:You're mad at me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not mad.
LEADFEMALE:I know the difference between when you're really mad and when you're just being yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I am not mad.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not looking at me.
SUPMALE:See? When she doesn't make eye contact, that means she's mad.
LEADMALE:I am looking at you.
SUPFEMALE:See? Ouch.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want to start anything in front of your little friend.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You're mad at me? I'm not mad.
LEADFEMALE:Time out.
SUPMALE:I get it.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, we didn't invite you because you hate ice-skating.
LEADFEMALE:You complain whenever i try and get you to go.
LEADMALE:Last time you went, you hurt your back.
LEADMALE:Nice try.
OTHERMALE:Do you want to go ice-skating with me and nancy on tuesday? Well, i don't want any pity invitation.
SUPFEMALE:How about if we're begging? O.
SUPMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:The three of us will go.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll be a lot of fun.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, maybe instead of ice-skating, you know, we could go see a real nice movie.
LEADMALE:We're going skating.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i just don't get any say in it.
SUPFEMALE:Yes! yeah! yes! All right.
LEADMALE:Damn! It's all right, ray.
OTHERMALE:That's six pins we didn't have a minute ago.
OTHERMALE:Hey, arnie? Before you fill up those size 12s, maybe you ought to get a designated driver.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, skinhead.
LEADMALE:Settle down.
LEADFEMALE:He's got you rattled.
SUPFEMALE:It's looking bad, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not going to worry.
LEADFEMALE:We're down by 30 pins, you're not going to worry? When i worry, my feet sweat.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, chuckie! Let's go, big c.
SUPFEMALE:! You got to be on the job site i'm going to have to bail on that drywall job.
LEADMALE:I just got a big snowmobile deal down at the shop.
SUPMALE:It's all right, chuckie.
LEADMALE:Pick it up on the next ball, babe.
OTHERFEMALE:I went out on a limb for you.
OTHERFEMALE:You can get david carr.
LEADMALE:I know who i can get.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, arnie.
LEADFEMALE:This is a big break for me.
LEADMALE:If this deal pans out, i'll never have to take another crappy construction job.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, almost! I do construction.
SUPMALE:It's not a crappy job.
OTHERMALE:You know what i mean.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't.
OTHERFEMALE:I own a bike shop.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to work construction.
LEADFEMALE:So you're better than me? I didn't say that.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just as smart.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:And i'm a better bowler than you are.
LEADMALE:Oh, come down to planet earth! I'm bowling a 72.
LEADFEMALE:What do you got? It ain't over yet.
LEADFEMALE:You're acting like children here.

LEADMALE:Trajectory? Do us a favor.
LEADFEMALE:Don't use words you can't spell.
LEADFEMALE:I can spell jerk, dan.
LEADMALE:Are you calling me a jerk? No.
SUPFEMALE:A jerk is someone who sells a worthless bike shop to a sucker like you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah! that's enough! We start fighting amongst each other, we don't have a chance.
LEADMALE:Now, come on, dan, you're up.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Strike! How's that, pinhead? Lucky, lucky.
LEADFEMALE:I could keep that up all night.
LEADFEMALE:So could i! Can't you stop this? As long as they're throwing strikes, i don't care if they kill each other.
LEADFEMALE:That's cold, chuck.
SUPFEMALE:I ain't drinking beer out of no shoe.
LEADMALE:I heard that, man.
LEADFEMALE:Now, look, you need four pins and we beat these guys.
SUPFEMALE:Don't think about anything except four pins.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:Oh, uh, by the way, did arnie ever pay you back all that money you lent him? No.
LEADFEMALE:Why? No reason.
OTHERMALE:He just told me he was shopping for a new car.
LEADMALE:Five! five! five! all right! we're not the worst! we're not the worst! we're not the worst! we're not the worst! We're not the-good game, dan.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you, too, arn.
OTHERMALE:Listen, i'm sorry about, uh-yeah, me, too.
SUPMALE:We won! This is what ninth place feels like.
LEADMALE:It feels good! Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, let's go buy frank a beer while his shoes are still ripe.
OTHERMALE:All right, men! There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Send this over to that table with our compliments.
LEADMALE:The odor-eater is floating to the top on that one, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well then it needs a twist.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, make sure frank gets that one.
SUPMALE:Bowlers.

SUPFEMALE:Whatever happened to that sled that we gave d.j. for his birthday? I think it's down in the basement.
LEADMALE:Why? I was just thinking that i could take it to the skating rink, and then jackie and nancy could push me around on it.
SUPMALE:I'm sure they'd love that, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Who the hell are you? Kevin.
SUPFEMALE:Kevin who? Kevin healy.
LEADMALE:I'm mark's brother.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? Mark and becky went out.
LEADMALE:They're paying me to watch steej.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and where is "steej"? I made him go to bed.
LEADMALE:He was getting on my nerves.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm home.
LEADFEMALE:They just left you here alone, and that was it? Maybe she thought she'd get home before you.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she doesn't care.
OTHERMALE:Hey, for 3 bucks, i'm not covering for her.
LEADMALE:I know you, don't i? you're a sophomore, right? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You hang out with dave mallone and those guys? Sometimes.

LEADFEMALE:I like your hair.
SUPMALE:It's just totally out of control.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Yours, too.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have detention tomorrow? Oh, i'm not sure yet.
LEADMALE:Well, looks like darlene's got her a little friend.
LEADMALE:His name's kevin.
LEADFEMALE:He's mark's little brother.
LEADMALE:Come on, kev.
OTHERMALE:I'll give you a ride home.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Darlene, get out there and clear the table.
LEADFEMALE:In a minute.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm tired of having this argument every morning.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to do it now.
SUPFEMALE:I'm watching dad shovel snow.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, scoot over.
SUPFEMALE:If you listen close, you can hear him wheezing a little tune.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know why he won't get somebody to do that for him.
OTHERMALE:One day he'll keel over out there, and i won't be able to get my car out of the driveway.
LEADFEMALE:Here's my new birthday list.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, let's see.
SUPMALE:A new bathrobe.
SUPFEMALE:I'm taking a bath every night from now on.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? And a new desk lamp.
LEADMALE:That's so you can do your homework better? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:And let's see what else we got down here.
LEADMALE:Uhoh.
LEADFEMALE:A super nintendo video game.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:If that's too many things, cross off the lamp and the robe.
LEADFEMALE:I told you we can't afford a video game now.
SUPFEMALE:All my friends have them.
LEADMALE:They make fun of me because i don't.
LEADMALE:That's not why they make fun of you, d.j. it's not fair.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, will you get me a super nintendo? No.
LEADFEMALE:But if i don't catch my breath, maybe your new daddy will buy you one.
LEADMALE:I wish i lived somewhere else! Well, honey, you just remember that wish when you're blowing out your birthday candles.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to todd's.
LEADMALE:He has genesis.
LEADMALE:Did you get it? To go with it.
OTHERMALE:Did you get the super mario brothers ii? I didn't forget you, dear.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:You actually got him the video game? That's like 200 bucks.
LEADMALE:I got some extra repair work, so i got some extra cash.
LEADMALE:When it was my birthday, why didn't i get the leather jacket i wanted? Well, we wanted to surprise you.
LEADFEMALE:Funny.
SUPMALE:Ha ha.
LEADMALE:Are you leaving? Yeah, i'm going to the-book store.
SUPMALE:I'm out of here, too.
LEADFEMALE:You working in the restaurant today? No.
LEADMALE:I actually got the day off.
LEADFEMALE:What are you going to do? what do you think, sit and paint my toenails? I'm going to clean the house.
LEADMALE:So get out of here, dan, you big idiot.
OTHERMALE:It's not like you bought me one of those self-cleaning electric jetson houses.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! oh, god! Oh, my back.
LEADFEMALE:Ohi can't move.
OTHERMALE:Dan! ow! oh, i--i can't get up, and i don't have one of those things! i shouldn't have laughed at that old lady on tv! dan! What do i do? It's like that game hedgehog.
LEADMALE:Power up or you're dead.
SUPMALE:What happened? You're dead.
LEADMALE:The skeleton stabbed you through the heart.
LEADMALE:That's your blood.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, d.j. 's going to love this! Once he gets it, we'll never see him again.
SUPFEMALE:Give it to him now.
LEADFEMALE:One more time.
SUPMALE:I'm glad d.j. 's getting something he really wants.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm off to my boring job so someday i can afford to buy a car.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold it right there.
LEADFEMALE:What? Every time we scrape together some cash, you hit us up for a car.
OTHERMALE:That's the best time, isn't it? Well, we're sick of it, becky.
SUPFEMALE:Jeez, i-let me finish! So we decided you should have one.
OTHERFEMALE:You're buying me a car? that would be great, wouldn't it? But it's just not us.
LEADFEMALE:No what we will do is match you dollar for dollar.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever you put down, we'll put down.
LEADFEMALE:Really? That's a deal.
LEADMALE:How much you got saved up? About 400.
LEADMALE:Already? Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:Today's the day.
SUPMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:You're not getting off that easy.
LEADMALE:Thanks, daddy.
LEADMALE:You've been working real hard, so you deserve the best car $2,200 can buy.
LEADMALE:Lanford custom cycle.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, deej.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on? Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Was she-let me talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Your mom threw her back out.
LEADFEMALE:I hope it's not like that last time.
OTHERFEMALE:It hurt her just to breathe.
LEADMALE:Hey, honey.
LEADMALE:Are you o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? Ow, dan! it hurts, it hurts! ow! ow! ow! help me, dan! i'm dying! She's breathing o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:I got you.
LEADFEMALE:Easy.
LEADFEMALE:Just a few more steps.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let go.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tip over.
LEADMALE:So what happened? you hurt yourself while you were cleaning? I didn't get that far.
SUPFEMALE:You didn't try to shovel the walk, did you? You got me.
SUPMALE:So was it your upper back again? No.
LEADFEMALE:It's my whole back.
LEADMALE:It kind of just like totally spasmed out, you know? I was screaming so loud, d.j. could hear me from next door.
LEADMALE:After about an hour, he came home to see what was wrong.
SUPMALE:We should call a doctor.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:He's just going to tell me to stay in bed and take it easy and not do anything.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Call him.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sorry, mom, but unless you're going to die or something, i'm late for work.
LEADFEMALE:I'll survive.
LEADMALE:See ya.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:She kissed me.
LEADMALE:She must know about our car deal.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Did she kiss you? No, but she hugged me and called me daddy.
LEADMALE:All our kids have a price, don't they, dan? Here's the heating pad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:D.j. , i'm so sorry, but i can't make you a birthday party until i'm feeling better.
LEADMALE:Well, can't grandma do it? grandma? you can go now, d.j. your mother's coming? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I sort of called her.
LEADFEMALE:And what did you tell her? That i was in excruciating pain.
LEADMALE:Oh, jeez, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Couldn't you think of me first? Well, dan, you'll be at work.
OTHERMALE:The kids will be at school.
LEADFEMALE:I need somebody to take care of me.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't get out of bed.
LEADFEMALE:Once you're back on your feet, she's out.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPMALE:I'll get you some tea.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god! wayne newton! rosie, come out here quick! wayne's here! Nice try.
LEADMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:How are those apple pancakes? Oh.
OTHERMALE:They're perfect.
LEADMALE:Remember how i always made them for you when you were sick? Oh, you were so great.
LEADMALE:You would feed a fever and a cold.
OTHERMALE:You were such a horrible patient.
LEADFEMALE:I had to hide your medicine in your food.
LEADMALE:What kind of medicine? Oh, whatever i had that would make you drowsy.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Did you get all the stuff i wanted? Yes, my queen.
OTHERFEMALE:Here are your magazines, and there is the hand lotion, under-eye moisturizer, cuticle cream, and three emery boards.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where's my gum? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:No! I didn't want spearmint.
OTHERFEMALE:I want peppermint! So? Spearmint doesn't make me feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Just chew it! I haven't even had a chance to say hi to mom yet.
SUPMALE:Hi, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, jackie.
SUPMALE:Well, how are you doing? Well, even in the middle of an ugly divorce, life goes on.
LEADFEMALE:Fortunately i still have one daughter who asks me to visit.
LEADMALE:How can you even say that? She's treating you like a slave here.
SUPFEMALE:Which is more than i could expect from you, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
SUPMALE:Oh, happy birthday, d.j. can you get out of bed yet? No.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, i can't.
LEADMALE:What about my cake? I'll make you one, d.j. i want one from the store like mom makes.
LEADMALE:Well, you're just going to have to suffer.
LEADMALE:This stinks.
SUPFEMALE:Where's my birthday kiss? Come and get it.
SUPMALE:And he's my favorite.
LEADMALE:He's at that age where the whole world revolves around him.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:My little boy's becoming a man.
LEADMALE:Have you told leon you hurt your back and wouldn't be in? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I think he believed me.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:D.j. home? No.
SUPFEMALE:Where is he? I think my mom picked him up from school.
SUPMALE:I went to the school to surprise him by going out for ice cream.
LEADMALE:I guess you had to eat the ice cream by yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to make his day special.
SUPMALE:It's his 10th birthday.
LEADFEMALE:You got more tape? I'll go get it.
SUPMALE:You've been throwing your back out since you were 15.
SUPFEMALE:No kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Shouldn't you do something about it? what would you suggest, jackie? Well, when i was injured in the line of duty-oh, please.
LEADMALE:You fell down a flight of stairs.
LEADMALE:Stop making it sound like you threw your body on a live grenade.
LEADMALE:I hurt my back is the point, and i have always found exercise to be the answer.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Well, that's great.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you jog out into the kitchen and make me some hot chocolate? They just pulled up.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you want the video game? on top? No! Put it under the bed.
LEADMALE:We're going to make him open all the other presents first, then when he starts whining and being bratty about how he didn't get the video game, then we'll give it to him and then he'll feel really stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Most parents would just give him the gift.
LEADFEMALE:Mom! mom! guess what grandma got me! what? Super nintendo! I know it's a little extravagant, but he seemed to want it so much, we stopped off on the way home.
LEADMALE:Dad, help me hook it up.
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Don't you want to open your other presents? Later.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i'll just get started on the birthday cake.
LEADFEMALE:Make sure you put some extra medicine in dan's piece.
OTHERMALE:This is really great, grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, becky, i wanted everything to be special for d.j. can i go now? No.
LEADMALE:You're not playing video games till you've had your birthday cake.
OTHERFEMALE:How's it going in there? Fine, dear.
LEADMALE:Is dan still mad? No, rosie.
LEADMALE:Everything's good.
LEADMALE:Is he lying, jackie? No, roseanne.
LEADMALE:He's fine.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:Dan, i'm really sorry that i didn't check with you first.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry about it, bev.
LEADFEMALE:I can take it back and get him something else.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't keep that anger all bottled up.
OTHERMALE:You'll just get diarrhea.
LEADMALE:I said i'm fine, darlene.
LEADMALE:How's the job, becky? why? Because i'm changing the subject, becky.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they moved me up to the express line.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? They must have a lot of confidence in you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:All i have to do is count to 10.
LEADFEMALE:Don't wear mittens.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll slow you down.
LEADMALE:Mother! Well, it was funny, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm glad you're all laughing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one who's got to go back there tonight.
LEADMALE:You're working pretty hard these days.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm saving up to buy a car.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's matching me dollar for dollar, so i'm trying to break the bank.
OTHERFEMALE:What about your schoolwork? Oh, i'm doing it.
LEADFEMALE:And your social life you can't be having any fun? Well, i guess i don't see mark that much.
LEADFEMALE:Nice going, bev.
LEADMALE:You gave away the plan.
LEADMALE:It just seems like such a shame.
OTHERMALE:Can we do the cake now? Of course, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Happy birthday to you happy birthday to what happened, did you forget the words? He took off.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'll have his piece.
SUPFEMALE:You know, becky, all these years i've been driving your grandfather's hand-me-downs.
LEADMALE:It's time i had a new car of my own.
LEADFEMALE:But the one i have is in very good condition.
LEADMALE:Weren't you making coffee? In a minute, dear.
SUPMALE:Becky, you don't have a car, and soon i'll have one too many.
LEADFEMALE:Bev.
LEADMALE:Dan, she's got years ahead of her where she'll have to work.
LEADFEMALE:Let her enjoy herself while she's young.
SUPMALE:Shouldn't you use that car for a trade-in? It's your father's money, dear.
LEADMALE:It's my pleasure to spend it.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? We have an arrangement.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, i can get a car for nothing.
LEADMALE:You'll get a car by working for it.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, if i have a car, it'll be easier to get to work.
OTHERFEMALE:Bull.
OTHERMALE:The minute you get a car, you'll find some reason to stop working.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you think that.
OTHERFEMALE:That's so unfair.
SUPFEMALE:We had a deal.
SUPFEMALE:Grandma's deal is better.
LEADMALE:It's better to earn something than to have it handed to you.
LEADMALE:Nothing's ever been handed to me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right! like your life just stinks! It would make me happy to do this, dan.
LEADFEMALE:That's why i had these kids-just to make you happy.
SUPMALE:Aren't you being a little unreasonable? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:At least go up and talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:You do it! You're doing such a great job deciding what's right and wrong for my kids, they don't need me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i could use a new car.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
LEADMALE:You didn't have to come down tonight.
SUPFEMALE:I had some paperwork.
LEADFEMALE:You going to let becky have the car? you know about that already? She called me after you left the house.
SUPFEMALE:What advice did you have for her? I asked why she wanted an old-lady car.
LEADFEMALE:Interesting approach.
LEADMALE:They worked it all out without you.
SUPFEMALE:What did they work out? Your wife gets grandma's car, and becky gets your wife's old car.
LEADMALE:But becky keeps working, and you're still going to pay half when she gets a better car.
SUPFEMALE:They leave me any cake? dan? In here.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Bev, this is mark.
LEADMALE:Mark, this is becky's grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Is this the boyfriend? It is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i understand what becky sees in you.
SUPMALE:You look like that fonzie fellow who's so popular these days.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, nice meeting you.
SUPFEMALE:See you tomorrow, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Aaay.
SUPFEMALE:Aaay.
LEADMALE:Aaay.
LEADMALE:You came down here to get away from me, and here i am.
OTHERMALE:I had some work to do.
LEADMALE:You know, as i was buying d.j. that gift, i just knew i was doing the wrong thing.
SUPMALE:But while we were in the car, he asked me if grandpa married this other lady, would she be his grandma, too? Ouch.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:So i started to think that without grandpa al, maybe i wouldn't be as welcome.
LEADMALE:He's always been fun for the kids.
LEADMALE:All i ever seemed to say is, "get your finger out of your nose.
LEADFEMALE:" so i was just going for a little extra popularity.
LEADMALE:Well, you know what? I guess i was, too.
LEADMALE:I mean, it isn't often that i can afford to get something nice for my kids.
LEADFEMALE:I had two shots today and you aced me out of both of them.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry i yelled.
SUPFEMALE:That's o.
OTHERMALE:K.
SUPMALE:It made me feel like part of the family.
OTHERFEMALE:If it makes you feel any better, the kids don't like grandpa any more than they like you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:And i've got an idea.
LEADFEMALE:Until roseanne's back is better, i'll just take care of my kid, and you can take care of yours.
OTHERMALE:Deal.
LEADMALE:I'm not sure you ever knew this, but i wasn't too thrilled when roseanne married you.
SUPMALE:You wore black to the wedding.
LEADMALE:But i have to say, you've turned out to be a wonderful husband and father.
SUPFEMALE:And? and what? what do i get? what do you mean? Come on.
LEADMALE:You gave roseanne a car.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, dan no.
OTHERFEMALE:All i need is a a tvbig screen.
LEADFEMALE:And a satellite dish.
LEADMALE:I will fix the car, becky.
SUPFEMALE:You always fix it, and it always breaks down.
LEADFEMALE:It's temperamental in cold weather.
LEADMALE:What's the point of having a car if it won't get me to work? Well, it'll get you close.
SUPFEMALE:I ought to take it to the junkyard and sell it.
LEADFEMALE:It'll never get you that far.
SUPFEMALE:This stinks.
SUPFEMALE:You'll get a new car when you earn it.
LEADMALE:Until then, this is better than the bus.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the bus gets better mileage.
LEADFEMALE:You're not helping.
LEADMALE:Becky, you've been griping to drive that car ever since you got your license.
LEADMALE:Now it's yours.
OTHERFEMALE:You get grandma's car, and i get your bomb.
LEADFEMALE:What can i say? My mommy's better than your mommy.
OTHERMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:How you doing? Two more swords and i'm queen of the monkey people.
OTHERFEMALE:I meant your back.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i can't do the laundry, and i'm not making dinner.
LEADMALE:So why do you ask? 'cause you've got a doctor's appointment.
LEADMALE:I don't want to go.
LEADFEMALE:He's not going to hurt you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, he will.
OTHERFEMALE:He'll tell me i'm fine, and then he'll tell me i should do the laundry.
SUPFEMALE:You'll just have to risk it, dear.
SUPMALE:Why are you making me do this? Because i love you.
LEADMALE:You just want me to get better.
LEADMALE:Keep moving.
SUPMALE:I want my mommy! Grandpa al, it's darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, really.
SUPMALE:I know i haven't called you that much, but, you know, grandma was here and she was talking about you, so i got to thinking-what did she say? Oh.
LEADMALE:It's not important, and i didn't believe any of it anyway.
LEADMALE:She's really sucking up.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, becky got a car, and d.j. got this really expensive video game.
LEADFEMALE:No, i didn't get anything.
LEADMALE:I don't know probably because i stuck up for you one too many times.
LEADMALE:But, hey, what's right is right.
LEADFEMALE:So when are you coming into town? 
SUPMALE:Miss! In a minute.
SUPMALE:In a minute! Can i at least get a menu here? No.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't want to get your hopes up.
SUPFEMALE:Just put it on a plate.
LEADFEMALE:I'll pick the hairs out of it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, god.
SUPMALE:You looked swamped.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry i'm late.
LEADMALE:Don't apologize to me.
LEADMALE:Apologize to the people i took it out on.
LEADFEMALE:Let me get my coat off.
SUPFEMALE:Walter, what's it going to be? It's unbelievable, roseanne! I just saw the television set that lets you watch two channels at once.
SUPFEMALE:You can watch what you're watching and what you're missing at the same time, but you're missing life, because-you're getting soup.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:I hate it when his mommy don't pack his lunch.
OTHERMALE:Oh! damn it! What? I threw out my back again.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:This is just getting ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:How am i supposed to work when this happens all the time? Let me just sit down.
LEADMALE:Miss! You sit right here.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get that.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss, you got any steak sauce? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's on the other side of the counter there.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind getting it yourself? I can't bend over too good.
SUPMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i've seen a couple of doctors.
LEADMALE:They've described these pills, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind getting it yourself, because i can't really reach up too good? Cut yourself a great big slab.
OTHERMALE:Walter, your soup's up.
LEADFEMALE:Got it.
SUPFEMALE:Walter, honey, will you take those fries and drop them off to this guy in the red? Thanks a lot.
LEADMALE:You want some more coffee? do you mind, since you're up, pouring her another cup? Well, the pot's almost empty.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, there's some filters right on the shelf there.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, what are you doing? It's taken me a while, but i do believe i'm finally getting the hang of this job.
LEADMALE:Have a seat, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, the doctor will be here in a minute.
LEADMALE:So, what did he say? "put your clothes on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm done.
LEADMALE:" you know, like any man.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! No.
LEADMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Dixon will be able to help you.
LEADMALE:Why? He's the best.
LEADMALE:He helped me so much when i hurt my back on the force.
LEADMALE:You have a crush on him.
SUPFEMALE:I do not.
LEADMALE:I hope he can do something.
LEADFEMALE:I can't lay in bed when this happens anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I thought the girls were taking care of you.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:They're sick of me.
SUPMALE:The next time i ask for a pillow they're going to brick up my bedroom.
SUPMALE:Sorry to keep you waiting, mrs.
OTHERMALE:.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Jackie! Hi, dr.
LEADFEMALE:Dixon! How's the back? Oh, it's o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:It acts up every once in a while.
LEADFEMALE:Since when? Since shut up.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should make an appointment.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:That would be fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, mrs.
LEADMALE:.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner, your x-rays show no spinal damage or abnormality.
LEADMALE:Which means it's a muscular problem.
SUPMALE:I should try diet and exercise, maybe even hot baths.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll prescribe these little blue pills that don't do anything.
SUPFEMALE:Guess that just leaves the small matter of my fee.
LEADMALE:So you can't do anything either? A surgical procedure would give you some relief.
OTHERFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't heard what it is yet.
SUPMALE:I'm talking about a breast reduction.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yikes.
LEADMALE:Are you sure you're not reading the wrong side of the x-rays? You have bra strap pain.
LEADFEMALE:Most of your problems are in the upper back and shoulders.
OTHERMALE:Your back continually compensates for your front, which is huge.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:If you reduce the weight of your breasts, your posture will be better.
OTHERFEMALE:That will lessen lower back pain.
LEADMALE:Do people really do this? Yeah, it's fairly common.
LEADFEMALE:The risk is minimal.
SUPMALE:Well, what happens? I brought a brochure to show you.
SUPFEMALE:See, the surgeon makes an incision underneath the breast, around the nipple, and in a vertical line between the two.
LEADFEMALE:The excess breast tissue is then removed, and the nipple is then grafted back onto the breast in a higher position.
LEADMALE:What sick nazi man came up with this idea? It sounds worse than it is.
OTHERMALE:Maybe it's something that should think about.
OTHERFEMALE:It's crazy! Well, you've tried everything else.
SUPMALE:Well, how much do they take off? Just enough so you wouldn't need to see me anymore.
SUPFEMALE:What am i going to look like? what if he goes crazy? I don't want to end up looking like, you know.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey! I didn't mean that.
SUPMALE:I just meant these have been a big part of what i am my whole life.
LEADMALE:We're talking about changing that.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you'll feel better.
LEADMALE:I think it's just a moot point anyway.
LEADMALE:It's not like i could ever afford it.
LEADMALE:How much does that cost? Around $6,000.
LEADMALE:Each? No.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Since you've had chronic problems, insurance would probably cover about 80% of it.
LEADMALE:Look, obviously you've got a lot of thinking to do, and, if you want, i can recommend a wonderful specialist.
SUPMALE:Or you might want a second opinion.
SUPMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure i will when i get home.
LEADMALE:Only one night in the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:That's a pro.
OTHERMALE:It's the hospital.
OTHERMALE:Con.
LEADMALE:An art linkletter bed, color tv, room service.
LEADMALE:Pro.
LEADMALE:But the food will suck.
SUPMALE:Con.
LEADFEMALE:It sucks here.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be away from the kids.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but they'll want to visit.
LEADMALE:But you'll be drugged up, so call them names and fall back asleep.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Huge pro.
LEADMALE:What about dan, though? Dan wants you to feel better.
LEADMALE:I don't even know how to tell him about this.
LEADMALE:Well, i'll think of some-con, con, con.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll pretend like nothing happened.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing did happen.
SUPMALE:I haven't made up my mind.
SUPMALE:Mark, the car never made this noise before.
LEADFEMALE:It's like a rattling noise.
OTHERFEMALE:No, my father already fixed it.
SUPFEMALE:That's why i can't get it out of the driveway.
SUPMALE:Car doesn't have to run for you to live in it.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How come you're just sitting there? Waiting for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Did it ever occur to you to get off your butt and heat something up? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:It was way too early to panic.
SUPMALE:Well, where's d.j. ? He got hungry and went over to todd's.
LEADMALE:God, if i didn't come home, you all would starve to death.
LEADFEMALE:Will you hem my new jeans? yes, but can i please make dinner for you first? please? If you're making meatloaf, i'm just having salad.
SUPMALE:Does anybody care this woman was at the doctor and has something important to discuss with you all? Thank you, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:It would've been stupid to wait for the right time.
LEADMALE:What did he tell you? It's kind of funny, actually.
SUPFEMALE:I went there to talk about my back.
LEADFEMALE:All he just kept talking about was my boobs.
SUPMALE:Do you want me to beat him up? No.
SUPMALE:He said i should maybe think about getting a breast reduction.
LEADMALE:What? He said it would maybe help my back if i got my boobs shortened up.
LEADMALE:Are you going to do it? I haven't made up my mind yet.
LEADMALE:The doctor says her back keeps going out because of all the weight up front.
OTHERMALE:How long would you be in the hospital? She'd go in the night before.
SUPFEMALE:It would take a couple of weeks to get better, so you'd have to help out with the cooking and housecleaning.
SUPFEMALE:After that she'll go back to doing all the chores, and you'd be off the hook.
LEADMALE:Make that the last thing you say.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:If it'll stop the back pain, you should have the operation.
LEADMALE:You'll feel better.
LEADFEMALE:You'll look great.
SUPMALE:You can buy all new clothes.
OTHERMALE:Is everything a trip to the mall for you, becky? Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be good for her.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it's something she's always wanted.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? You know you always wanted perky ones.
SUPFEMALE:You try walking around with your shoulders hunched over and your back up in knots.
SUPFEMALE:Then we'll talk about why i'm really doing this.
LEADFEMALE:So you are doing it? Well come on, girls.
OTHERMALE:Let's get a pizza.
LEADMALE:Come on, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Why are we leaving? This affects all of us.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you went on solid foods, they ceased to be any concern of yours.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, darlene.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:I'm going to make a sandwich.
LEADMALE:Want one? No, i want you to talk to me about this.
LEADMALE:It's your decision, honey.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Tell me how you feel.
LEADMALE:I don't know how i feel.
LEADMALE:I'm sitting, waiting for dinner, and you say you're getting your breasts reduced.
SUPFEMALE:How am i suppose to feel? i mean, is this the only way? have you tried everything else? it's got to be surgery? what's bothering you about the surgery? you afraid of how i'll look? Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:You afraid of the money, 'cause insur-no, it's not the money.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then what is it? what was the first one again? I was worried about i'd look, but then i saw these pictures of how you look after, i would just look normal.
LEADMALE:I don't want you looking normal.
LEADMALE:I like you the way you are.
LEADMALE:I should've said it was the money.
LEADMALE:No, i asked how you felt.
LEADMALE:You told me.
LEADMALE:Am i the big pig now 'cause that bothers me? No.
LEADFEMALE:It bothered me, too.
LEADFEMALE:You really think this will make you feel better? Yeah, i really think i do.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll have to deal with it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you know, i'm not going to change or anything.
LEADFEMALE:I'll still be the same woman you married.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just be in less pain, so i won't be grumpy and whiny all the time.
OTHERMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:, so i won't exactly be the same woman you married.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in, rose.
SUPFEMALE:Is anybody in there hooked up to tubes or machines or hoses? No.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, 'cause i don't care for that.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, this ain't bad.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Hospital rooms give me the creeps.
SUPMALE:Every time we check out of one we got a new kid.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, what's that smell? My nose is burning.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's the clean, dan.
LEADMALE:No kidding.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Don't go getting used to it now.
LEADMALE:Well, for your dining pleasure this evening, we are serving "clear beef bouillon or chicken bouillon," which the chef informs me is also clear.
SUPMALE:Is that it? If you still have room, our dessert tray consists of a shimmering brick of green jell-o and the tray itself.
LEADMALE:Do me a favor? Go down the hall and drag that snack machine in here.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not supposed to eat before the surgery.
LEADFEMALE:I'll only lick the salt off the fritos.
LEADFEMALE:You can eat them.
LEADMALE:How long are visiting hours? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Stay and keep me company.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Sports channel.
LEADMALE:Dan, i've got a private room.
OTHERMALE:Good deal.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want to fool around? in the hospital? Look.
SUPFEMALE:The bed goes up and down.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't have to do nothing.
LEADMALE:I don't think so.
SUPMALE:Aw are you o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:With this? why worry about me? Are you o.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Then me, too.
OTHERMALE:You sure? I'm with you all the way-when they wheel you down, when it's over.
LEADFEMALE:While it's happening i'll be far away liquored up.
LEADMALE:Knock, knock.
LEADMALE:Am i interrupting? No, it's o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:Surprise! surprise! for they were jolly good fellows for they were jolly good fellows for they were jolly good fellows which nobody can deny ooh--ooh! whoo! oh, look it! a boob cake! Where did you get that? I saw it in good housekeeping.
LEADMALE:It was for a kitty-cat face.
SUPFEMALE:I trimmed the ears and doubled the recipe.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am i leaving.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be here first thing in the morning.
OTHERFEMALE:So will i.
LEADFEMALE:No cake for her.
LEADMALE:He seems to be doing better.
SUPMALE:Well, it would be easier if he was a leg man.
LEADMALE:You know dan tells everybody the first thing he noticed about you was your eyes.
LEADMALE:Men have to say that, crystal.
SUPMALE:It's the law.
OTHERMALE:Mmm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:You know they're lying.
SUPMALE:All they think about are our chests.
LEADFEMALE:At least every guy i ever went out with.
SUPMALE:One article said one reason men are so obsessed with breasts is that they represent security and nurturing and--and motherhood.
LEADMALE:Ohh! That's why they call them hooters.
LEADMALE:Or as my fellow truckers like to say, bumpers headlights and then the ever flattering airbags.
SUPMALE:Then there's your fruits and vegetables, right? Coconuts, mangoes pineapples sweet potatoes the entire melon family.
LEADFEMALE:And don't forget a nice pair.
OTHERFEMALE:They have the nerve to say they love you for your brain.
OTHERMALE:Which can't be true, because they've only got one word for brain.
SUPFEMALE:If that was true, all those bars would be having wet hat contests.
OTHERMALE:Well, we brought you a present, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Goody, goody.
LEADMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gimme it.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADMALE:Oh! whoa! yahoo! Look it.
LEADMALE:No underwires! no underwire! yeow! Now i can go through the metal detector at the airport without setting it off.
OTHERMALE:All right, mrs.
LEADMALE:.
SUPMALE:Conner, we're about ready.
LEADFEMALE:Did everybody wash their hands? Yes, ma'am.
OTHERMALE:Who are you? You're not my doctor.
OTHERMALE:Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Foster, your anesthesiologist.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any pull around here? I never did get my jell-o.
LEADFEMALE:Now, just count backwards from 100.
OTHERMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, but if i wake up with a baby, i'm going to personally kick your as rosie.
OTHERFEMALE:Rosie.
LEADFEMALE:Wake up, sleepyhead.
LEADFEMALE:Dan? Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:How do you feel? how did everything go? The operation went great.
LEADFEMALE:The surgeon said it's his best work ever.
LEADFEMALE:I want to see.
LEADMALE:I want to see.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:There's a mirror by the wall.
LEADMALE:Let me help you up.
LEADMALE:Aah! great, huh? They were supposed to make them smaller! This is better.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god! oh, my god! Calm down, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Calm down.
LEADFEMALE:I've got your jell-o right here.
LEADMALE:What did you do to me? what happened? You had a breast enlargement.
OTHERMALE:And a great one! i was supposed to have a reduction! you made a mistake! That's not true, mrs.
LEADMALE:.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:Here's your release form right there.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's your signature.
OTHERFEMALE:My doctor told me what he was going to do! i want to see my doctor! i want to see him now! Right away.
LEADFEMALE:Doctor, we need you.
SUPFEMALE:Yes? what's wrong? not big enough? Rosie.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie.
SUPMALE:Dan? She's awake, jacks.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, hi.
SUPMALE:How are you? Oh, way to go, doogie.
SUPFEMALE:Huh! Well now i just got to work on this.
SUPFEMALE:Stop it.
SUPMALE:I'm not touching you.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm warning you, d.j. quit it.
LEADMALE:I'm not touching you.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! Dad, i never touched her.
LEADMALE:Well, it was hardly worth it then, was it, son? how come you're home so late? Drive your brother and sister to school.
LEADMALE:Yeah, deej, let's go for a little ride.
LEADFEMALE:I'm taking the bus.
SUPMALE:Smart.
OTHERFEMALE:There's 70 kids waiting to beat him up on the bus.
SUPFEMALE:So, mom, first day back to work? That's right.
LEADMALE:Going to take the twins out for show and tell? Har har.
LEADFEMALE:Go to school, darlene.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Uh by the way you look nice.
SUPFEMALE:How many times do i have to tell you? i did this so i would feel better, not so i would look better? God, take a pill.
LEADFEMALE:So? what? how do i look? I'm a sucker for a woman in uniform.
SUPMALE:Did you check out the name tag? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It looks bigger.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, like, my whole uniform's really, really big, you know, like a tent.
LEADFEMALE:Want to go camping, dan? now? aren't you going to be late? Well, i got, like, an hour.
LEADMALE:Well, you keep saying you're sore.
LEADMALE:I just say that so the girls will keep doing all the crap work.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, dan.
LEADFEMALE:It's been, like, a while.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? I'm not sure this is the right time.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's the perfect time.
LEADMALE:I haven't even made the bed yet.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I feel kind of weird.
LEADFEMALE:It's still me.
SUPMALE:I'm nervous, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Well, don't be.
LEADFEMALE:They're higher now.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha ha! john! Hey, great show.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:How did that scene go in the kitchen-kind of romantic? you didn't see it? No.
LEADMALE:I had a call in my dressing room.
SUPMALE:It's weird.
LEADMALE:There's no call and the door jammed.
LEADFEMALE:I was stuck.
SUPMALE:That is weird.
LEADMALE:Did you do it like i suggested? Yeah! I played it nervous.
LEADFEMALE:She breaks me down.
LEADMALE:We shake hands.
OTHERMALE:Everybody agrees with you.
LEADMALE:A simple platonic gesture says it all.
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:I love being a producer.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Boy, this movie sucks, dan.
LEADMALE:I didn't make it, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you rented it.
LEADMALE:It's saturday.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody's renting saturday.
SUPMALE:There wasn't nothing left.
SUPMALE:You got to get the friday night people when they're coming back.
LEADMALE:Check their returns and stick with them.
LEADMALE:Maybe there's something on tv.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:It's saturday night.
LEADMALE:I don't want to watch regular tv.
OTHERMALE:You want to go out somewheres? I'm too tired.
SUPMALE:Maybe just go to sleep.
LEADMALE:It's only 8:30.
OTHERMALE:If we go to bed now, we'll get up at, like, and we'll have nothing to do again.
SUPFEMALE:When did we pass away, dan? I can't believe you.
SUPMALE:I don't know what your problem is.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe that's the problem! forget it! don't slam that door on me! Hey, finally, something worth watching.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know anybody at that party and you ditch me for your friends.
SUPFEMALE:Andy got a new car, we went for a ride.
OTHERMALE:As long as you're having fun, that's all that counts, right? what was i supposed to do, mark? Do what you always do, sit in the corner and whine about my friends.
LEADMALE:You don't care about me at all.
LEADFEMALE:Not this again.
LEADMALE:When was the last time we did something i wanted to do? You wanted to leave the party, and we left.
OTHERFEMALE:Go back there so you can be with your friends who are more important than i am.
LEADMALE:That's garbage.
LEADMALE:Well, what about thanksgiving, huh? I don't like hanging out with your parents.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody wants to hang out with my parents! You would have been doing it for me.
LEADFEMALE:So one time.
OTHERMALE:All the time.
LEADMALE:We have this same fight whenever we go out.
LEADMALE:When will this change? we're not going to talk about our relationship, are we? We don't have a relationship anymore.
SUPMALE:What's that mean? It means i'm sick of it.
LEADMALE:I'm sick of fighting, the way you treat me.
LEADMALE:I'm sick of you! Goodbye, mark.
LEADFEMALE:How was the party, becky? Oh, i hate him.
SUPMALE:I hope he dies.
LEADMALE:You want to talk about it? There's nothing to talk about anymore.
LEADFEMALE:It's over.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy.
SUPMALE:Maybe she's really going to dump this guy now.
SUPMALE:What do you think we ought to do? let's go dancing! lambada! Hey, dan, are you working tomorrow night? No.
LEADMALE:Because there's a pta meeting over at d.j. 's school.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:I'll come home early and drop you off.
LEADFEMALE:You're going.
LEADFEMALE:Why? D.j. doesn't care.
LEADMALE:He's a typical third grader.
LEADFEMALE:What will they tell me i don't already know? That he's in fourth grade.
LEADMALE:And you're still eating paste? jackie, can you do me a favor? what do you need, darlene? My friends want to see this r-rated movie, and it's my turn to bring the adult.
LEADMALE:You're not going to any r-rated movie.
SUPMALE:It's not sex, mother.
LEADFEMALE:It's violence.
SUPMALE:Oh, o.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, darlene.
SUPMALE:I'm busy.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe stacy can find someone.
LEADMALE:Who's stacy, like, your new friend? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, what's she like? Just a kid in my class.
LEADMALE:Ninth grade? Yeah, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, who else is going? Punks-hyped up on dope and out for blood.
SUPMALE:Well, take a sweater.
OTHERFEMALE:This is great.
OTHERMALE:Darlene's finding friends her own age, getting out of the house.
LEADMALE:Well, it beats having her sit in her room all depressed and psycho-like.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Becky, you going out tonight? Real funny, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Great going, dan.
LEADMALE:Brilliant.
OTHERMALE:Well, i didn't mean anything by it.
OTHERMALE:The girl just broke up with her boyfriend, for god sakes.
LEADMALE:God, you're such a man.
OTHERFEMALE:Should i go up and talk to her? You're the last person she needs to talk to.
SUPFEMALE:She needs her mother.
SUPMALE:And her aunt.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, why did mom call you a man like that? Well, um because she's mad at me, deej.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it was good to be a man.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Not since the late sixties, son.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I ought go in there with you.
LEADMALE:I can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know anything about breaking up or getting hurt.
SUPFEMALE:You married the first guy you ever dated.
LEADFEMALE:You think that doesn't hurt? I have something to contribute here.
LEADMALE:I'll call you when i need you, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:What am i supposed to do, just stand here? No, stand here.
LEADMALE:See, you can hear everything that goes on if we're not in the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Well, you must be really happy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, becky, you know that's not true.
OTHERFEMALE:How can i be happy when you're so miserable? Because you always hated him.
LEADMALE:Because he's a jerk.
SUPMALE:Right? Well, if you feel he's a jerk, i'll have to respect that.
LEADFEMALE:He's such a scum.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't love me.
SUPMALE:Cared about his stupid hair more than he cared about me.
SUPMALE:Let it out.
SUPFEMALE:Where was he going with his life anyway? He was such a loser.
LEADMALE:I miss him so much.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, of course you do, honey.
LEADMALE:Gee, you were dating him for what to hurt a little.
LEADFEMALE:But i'm a mess.
LEADMALE:I don't want to eat.
OTHERMALE:I can't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I've been crying for two days.
SUPFEMALE:How is my life going to get any worse? Now, jackie.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:The whole family's going to come in here? We love you.
LEADMALE:We're going to see you through this.
LEADMALE:I don't even know why i care.
LEADMALE:I broke up with him.
OTHERFEMALE:That doesn't mean that you don't still love him.
LEADFEMALE:Where you going with this, jackie? But just because you love him doesn't mean that he's good for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:It just seemed there were more bad times than good times.
LEADMALE:There you go.
SUPMALE:I don't know if i'll feel this way about anybody else.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe not.
LEADFEMALE:He was your first serious boyfriend, that well always be special.
LEADFEMALE:Another guy will come along, and hopefully, he'll be rich, and that'll be the end of it.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm, nobody's going to ask me out again.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? They'll be lined up around the block.
OTHERMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You're pretty.
LEADMALE:And you're smart.
LEADMALE:You really think so? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:There's a ton of boys waiting to hear mark's out of the picture.
LEADMALE:What if the next guy's a creep, too? Then you'll know a lot sooner.
SUPMALE:Eventually you'll meet some guy who's not a creep.
LEADMALE:Even better than that, you'll meet a guy who's everything you wanted and makes you really, really happy.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, you can never let him know that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this one's done.
LEADFEMALE:Already, how can i charge for three hours' labor when you're done in 45 minutes? you want me to start on the next one? don't you want to get out of here? you saying i got nothing to do? I can get a date.
OTHERFEMALE:I just happen to need the cash.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to run out of here crying, are you? Customer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, jeez.
SUPMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here? You told me you'd check the antifreeze.
OTHERMALE:Let me get my coat.
OTHERMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen, i'm sorry about the other night.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, me, too.
SUPMALE:I know you didn't mean to say anything stupid.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Hey, becky.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, mark.
LEADFEMALE:I'll leave you two alone.
LEADMALE:Why would we want to be alone? I don't know that answer to that.
SUPMALE:I heard you out here.
LEADMALE:I figured you might want this back.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:I got to get back to work, so well i guess it takes a big man to return an earring.
LEADFEMALE:He's still working here? umyes? you're letting him work here after the way he treated me? You can't expect me to fire him just because you broke up.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, i do.
SUPMALE:I can't.
SUPFEMALE:You only hired him 'cause of me.
SUPFEMALE:I hired him because he's a good mechanic.
SUPMALE:You don't care how i feel.
LEADMALE:Of course i do.
LEADMALE:He was horrible to me.
SUPMALE:Becky, this is business.
SUPMALE:He's earned the right to work here.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going to fire him.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we can see whose side you're on.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, dad.
LEADMALE:So am i fired? No, no.
SUPMALE:I need a mechanic.
LEADMALE:But i can't have her mad at me all the time.
SUPFEMALE:I got to find something that'll make her happy and me happy.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind if i smack you around? new guy tonight, huh? Yup.
OTHERMALE:What's his problem? There is no problem.
LEADFEMALE:Dean happens to be a really great guy.
LEADFEMALE:The kind of guy who doesn't make me wait for him.
SUPMALE:The kind of guy who asks me what i want to do.
SUPMALE:Maybe you can train him to treat you like crap.
LEADFEMALE:When are you going to run away? you hate mark now? No, i'm just glad it's over.
SUPFEMALE:Are you going to have sex with dean? Of course.
SUPMALE:I'll have sex with every guy i meet from now on.
LEADMALE:Dean's o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:With this? Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:All i meant was you slept with mark.
LEADMALE:So? well, are you sorry you did? No.
LEADFEMALE:I really did love him.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish he'd turned out to be halfway human.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to miss the guy.
SUPMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious.
LEADMALE:Even when i was really depressed, i could always laugh at old stupid.
OTHERFEMALE:Just do me a favor, and leave dean alone.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:If i go down there and this dean guy's got some sweltering zit on his forehead oh, jeez.
SUPFEMALE:Am i supposed to let that go? I dislocated my shoulder in practice, but i wouldn't miss that last game, so i didn't tell anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Must've been killing you.
LEADFEMALE:If you can't play with pain, you should be on the tennis team.
SUPFEMALE:Listen to this knee.
LEADMALE:Man, that thing really pops.
SUPMALE:I did it in jayvee.
SUPMALE:There's no cartilage.
SUPMALE:That's bone on bone.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Here's some more chips.
SUPMALE:Dean hurt himself in football just like i did.
LEADMALE:You got drunk and fell off the bus, too? I hurt it in a game.
LEADFEMALE:The bus thing just aggravated it.
OTHERMALE:Hey, dean.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you look fantastic.
LEADMALE:Thanks, i guess you've met everybody.
LEADMALE:This is my sister darlene.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me get your coat.
LEADFEMALE:He's helping her with her coat.
SUPFEMALE:This guy is so great, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:It was nice to meet you all.
LEADFEMALE:Be home by 11:00.
SUPFEMALE:Or 12:00.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god! oh, my god! he's incredible! i love him! i want to date him myself! Isn't he perfect, roseanne? He's history, dan.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? She thought he was great.
SUPMALE:It was so obvious.
LEADMALE:He's what's known as the transition guy.
LEADFEMALE:Dead before he pulled into the driveway, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Better off forgetting all about dustin.
SUPMALE:Dave.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
SUPMALE:He's the poor slob stuck in-between the first boyfriend and the next boyfriend.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:It doesn't have to work like that.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, you never had a transition guy.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think you are, dan? isn't he coming back? I'll explain it to you someday.
LEADFEMALE:But i liked him.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't call me jerk-weed.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't know you, d.j. i don't believe this.
OTHERMALE:Well there'll be lots of other boys, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Nice boys.
LEADMALE:Won't be nicer than dean.
LEADMALE:Well, you'll love them in a different way, dan.
LEADMALE:You knew this guy was dead from the beginning? why do you think i tried to unload the salt-free chips on him? In the future, please give me a clue before i let some strange guy listen to my knee.
LEADMALE:Here's the way it works, dan.
LEADFEMALE:The next guy you hate, he's the keeper.
LEADFEMALE:I got a poker game.
SUPMALE:That's good.
SUPFEMALE:Get yourself out there.
OTHERFEMALE:Get on with your life.
LEADMALE:Well at least i'll know what to do when this happens with darlene.
OTHERMALE:Look how cute you are.
LEADMALE:I hate this.
SUPFEMALE:Poor guy.
SUPMALE:Doesn't even have a clue.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, it's like somebody moved his food dish.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess we'd better get going.
LEADFEMALE:What are we doing tonight? Well, it was crystal's pick, so she's got us going to some self-help seminars.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know how crystal is lately.
OTHERFEMALE:She's a basket case, so she needs to network with other basket cases.
LEADMALE:But what are we supposed to do? We'll just sit in the back and make fun of everybody.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:How's your back? Um, pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:You going to physical therapy? Yeah, twice a week, and i'm sticking to my diet.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doing all right.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? what about your exercise? what about your love life? I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Hi, mark.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Can you tell becky i'm here? Um, becky isn't home right now, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Her car's out front.
LEADFEMALE:She's not home.
SUPMALE:Is she out with that dean guy? I don't know if that's any of your business, mark.
LEADMALE:I'm going to be in the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:You've told her i called? Yes, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i'm sure.
SUPMALE:Are you calling me a liar? I got a husband and a boss.
LEADMALE:I have no need to lie to you.
LEADFEMALE:So why didn't she call me back then? Maybe she doesn't want to.
OTHERMALE:Maybe when she said it was over, it really was over.
LEADMALE:Like you had nothing to do with that either.
LEADFEMALE:You think she listens to me? You've always put me down, called me a jerk.
LEADMALE:And the more names i called you, the more i shelled out for birth control pills.
SUPFEMALE:You're the reason we broke up.
LEADFEMALE:If you'd treated me decent-i would've treated you like a king if you'd shown my daughter any respect.
LEADFEMALE:If once you'd thought about her before yourself, you wouldn't need to be trying to blame this on me.
SUPFEMALE:Quit wasting my time and get out of my house.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:You really nuked him.
SUPMALE:I don't know, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, i've dreaming about laying into that punk for a yeah and a half.
LEADFEMALE:I finally get the chance, and i forgot to make fun of his hair.
SUPFEMALE:I wish you'd respect that i don't eat meat.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? This is pepperoni.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think an animal should die just to feed us.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, darlene.
SUPMALE:This stuff's made of the hair, teeth, and tail.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing the little piggy can't live without.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Flowers for becky connor.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Becky! Who do you think those are from? who else? Dean, dean, the son-in-law machine.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, come on out here.
SUPMALE:Hurry up! What? Looky here.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, you actually remembered valentine's day? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Just now.
LEADMALE:What? Aww sorry.
SUPFEMALE:That's o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, what you're getting me will be way better.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:These are from mark.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:It can't be.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Listen to this-"dear becky, thinking of you first for a change.
SUPMALE:I love you, mark.
LEADMALE:" too little too late, huh, becky? I'm going to find something to put these in.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, this is all your fault.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't have called her till you changed that card.
LEADFEMALE:He wouldn't have sent them flowers without your big speech about respect.
SUPMALE:If you'd fired him, he wouldn't be able to afford flowers.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Old stupid's coming back.
SUPMALE:We don't know that.
LEADMALE:Dad, thanks for not firing him.
LEADMALE:You were so right.
SUPFEMALE:And you thought he was a jerk.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Remember me? I played dean in tonight's episode of roseanne.
LEADMALE:Now, i don't know about you, but i thought dean was the kind of character i'd like to see again.
SUPMALE:Mark, he's all wrong for becky.
LEADMALE:And dean can make her happy.
LEADMALE:There's no reason becky couldn't fall in love with dean.
SUPMALE:They just have to write it that way.
LEADMALE:If you feel like i do, let's bring dean back.
LEADMALE:You can make a difference.
SUPMALE:Just drop a card or make a phone call-shouldn't you be washing my car? Hey, keep your pants on! i'm talking here! Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you curious about who bought our old house? How come you're so obsessed with this.
LEADFEMALE:It's where we grew up.
LEADMALE:I'm just surprised that you don't have any feelings for it at all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, god, it's not like it's the first mcdonald's or something.
SUPMALE:Look at that-final notice from my insurance company.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good.
SUPFEMALE:I was sick of hearing from them.
LEADMALE:Well it's special.
LEADFEMALE:It's our house.
OTHERMALE:Hey, jackie, you forget.
SUPMALE:Ever since dad sold that house, it's also become home to three other dysfunctional families.
LEADMALE:I'm going to change.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey! What? what are you doing upstairs with some boy? Well, no one was home, so i figured, "why not become a woman?" cut it out, darlene.
LEADMALE:She's not a woman, mrs.
LEADMALE:.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:Nothing was going on.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm waiting for her to lie to me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to explain myself to you.
SUPFEMALE:Yes you do.
SUPFEMALE:See how big i am? We were working on this.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a comic book.
OTHERMALE:I do the drawings.
OTHERFEMALE:She writes the words.
LEADFEMALE:Don't show her.
SUPMALE:This is what you were working on? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Zombies eating people's brains? Well, it's not done yet.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but i see what it's saying.
OTHERFEMALE:It's saying that you were not upstairs i'm going to take off.
LEADMALE:I'll see you at school tomorrow.
LEADMALE:You're going? Yeah, i guess.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:Can you believe her? She just had to embarrass me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you got to understand, darlene.
SUPMALE:That's not just any guy there.
LEADMALE:That's mark's brother.
LEADMALE:That's not his fault.
LEADMALE:Maybe she'll see that eventually.
LEADFEMALE:Look at these drawings.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:These are great.
LEADFEMALE:You guys put a lot of time in on this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:A couple of weeks.
SUPFEMALE:I think of the story, and he draws it.
LEADMALE:We're totally in sync.
LEADMALE:We've got a couple more stories worked out.
LEADMALE:It's going to be a whole series.
LEADFEMALE:They're not just comic books.
LEADFEMALE:They're graphic novels.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh, it's just great to see you like this, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:You know, excited about something.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, ever since you quit basketball-stop it.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Can i read it? I guess.
LEADMALE:I'm just so proud of you! That's quite enough.
LEADMALE:Todd's fish died today.
SUPMALE:That's a shame.
OTHERFEMALE:Was he sad? Yeah, but he felt better after we put it in the street and watch a car smash it.
LEADMALE:D.j. , we're eating.
LEADMALE:So, beck, you're going out with mark on saturday, huh? Jackie! I said we're eating.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not a date.
SUPMALE:He wants to talk.
LEADMALE:That can be pretty tough with his tongue crammed down your throat.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, it's over between us.
SUPMALE:But i think he misses me and wants to come crawling back.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not hungry at all anymore.
LEADMALE:Then how come he didn't ask you out for friday night? what do you mean? Well, you've got to wonder what other moron he's crawling to.
SUPMALE:Did you hear something from david? is he going out with somebody else? do you care? It's over between you and baghead.
LEADMALE:Well, it is.
OTHERMALE:I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Nobody cares.
OTHERFEMALE:New topic.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy's home.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll talk about daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry i'm late.
LEADMALE:I got to talking with mark at the shop.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? what did he say? It wasn't about you.
LEADMALE:He said david cut school the other day and went to chicago.
SUPFEMALE:He ratted out his own brother.
LEADFEMALE:I think he was proud of the kid.
SUPMALE:But you're not hanging around with david if he's pulling this crap.
LEADFEMALE:How come he was in chicago? how should i know? Something about a comic book convention.
LEADFEMALE:Comic book convention, huh? 'cause you know i can call the school and find out if you ditched, too.
LEADFEMALE:The convention was only there for two days.
OTHERMALE:You went to chicago with him? It's not a big deal out of this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i am going to make a huge deal out of this! you get up for school and wind up in chicago? we don't even know? something could have happened! How could you do something so stupid? We took the bus.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing happened.
SUPMALE:Till now.
SUPMALE:You're grounded.
LEADMALE:You are so grounded.
SUPFEMALE:And don't think you're just laying around.
LEADMALE:You'll do something useful.
LEADMALE:And you'll hate it.
LEADFEMALE:Or else we'll think of something even more useful.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't anybody want to know why we went? You're not seeing david no more.
LEADMALE:Because of him you lied, you went to chicago, and you skipped school.
LEADMALE:You need more? The convention was important to us.
LEADMALE:We're serious about this stuff.
SUPFEMALE:You can do better than that, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:So did mark say where he was going after he left the shop? hey, can i have some of that chocolate? No, d.j. it's baker's chocolate.
OTHERMALE:You won't like it.
LEADFEMALE:Please? It doesn't have any sugar in it.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:It won't spoil my dinner.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Go for it.
LEADFEMALE:Eew! it's awful! Well, i guess that's a lesson every kid's got to learn once, huh? are you kidding? He does that every single time i bake a cake.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hi, arnie.
SUPFEMALE:How are you doing, arnie? I'm doing pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Dan said i could borrow the truck, you got the keys.
SUPMALE:The keys are on that hook there.
LEADMALE:That chocolate? Yeah! Help yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Hey, listen.
SUPFEMALE:I got a little problem with nancy, and i know she listens to you guys.
SUPMALE:What's going on? She's driving me nuts.
LEADMALE:She's trying to change me.
LEADFEMALE:She says i got potential.
OTHERMALE:Well, do you want me to set her straight, arnie? would you? what are you doing with the truck? Mine's in the shop.
LEADFEMALE:The demolition crew's letting me salvage the copper pipes from your old place.
SUPMALE:Demolition? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:They're putting up a burger heaven.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this! It's great.
OTHERFEMALE:The whole block will smell like chili.
LEADFEMALE:You know rosie, i don't want to say nothing, but there's something really wrong with this stuff.
LEADMALE:You know, darlene, i've never seen you look as lovely as you do now.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe you didn't get busted, too.
LEADFEMALE:I was.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in my room right now.
SUPFEMALE:When i'm ready to admit i'm wrong, i can come out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! What? I just found my old hamster.
SUPMALE:Darlene, your mom said you had some stuff of mine--oh, man! Well, you've see me.
LEADFEMALE:Now you must die.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out of here! You won't tell anybody? Live in fear, david.
SUPMALE:I can do that.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! your mom catches him in here, you're dead! Thanks for the tip.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like you're doing a pretty good job.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want? you mad at me? why would i be mad at you? just because you let them dump all over me? If you want me to say it's o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:To go to chicago without telling anybody, i won't! You could have told them it was important.
LEADFEMALE:They think this comic book convention is just some lame excuse to cut school.
SUPFEMALE:They think that me and david are like mark and becky.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't say anything! You told me how great it was that i was finally getting into something.
SUPFEMALE:They weren't going to listen to me! You're right.
LEADMALE:The best thing to do was to let them dump all over me.
LEADMALE:Darlene! Just leave me alone.
LEADMALE:Thanks for picking me up, beck.
LEADFEMALE:Deej, where's mom? She went out.
LEADMALE:She said she'd be back in an hour.
SUPMALE:Hey, dad, how come mark couldn't drive you home? Uhhe left early.
OTHERMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he usually doesn't leave early, does he? He did tonight.
LEADMALE:Did he smell good when he left? I try not to sniff the help, becky.
SUPMALE:Well, you know what i mean.
OTHERMALE:I don't know if he's dating anyone else, o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? You're with him all day.
OTHERFEMALE:And he's always been a gentleman.
OTHERMALE:Never laid a hand on me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Just hey.
LEADMALE:You done out there? I guess that would be up to you.
SUPFEMALE:I got an idea.
SUPFEMALE:Since mom's gone for a little longer, let's get a pizza.
LEADMALE:Darlene, what don't you want on your half? I'll have this upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go again.
LEADFEMALE:Now she'll sit in her room and mope for six months.
SUPMALE:She's so immature.
LEADFEMALE:Good! he's home! We should have asked arnie for the key.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we'll be in in a minute.
SUPMALE:Oh! The branch is creaking, jackie.
LEADMALE:It never creaked back when we were kids.
LEADMALE:Well, the tree's older now, and you're older now, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we both fall at the same speed, slim.
LEADFEMALE:I'm hurrying.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:All these years, nobody ever fixed that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, just get in.
OTHERMALE:Oh nice branch.
LEADFEMALE:Good branch.
SUPMALE:Strong branch.
LEADMALE:Oh whoa! I just flashed on winnie the pooh and the honey tree.
SUPFEMALE:Just get me in here, all right? how many times do you think we did that? You sneaking in after seeing dan.
LEADFEMALE:You're supposed to have been studying.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
SUPMALE:About now i'd be wondering if i remembered my underwear.
LEADMALE:Shh! You'll wake up mom and dad.
LEADMALE:You were supposed to be in by 11:00.
SUPFEMALE:Well, after the party me and dan went over to his house and we had three kids.
LEADMALE:Don't tell mom! Wow our room.
SUPFEMALE:Eew.
LEADMALE:Eew, it even smells the same.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Eew.
LEADFEMALE:You know that smell of burned meat and oppression.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, look, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:There's the vent.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Mom and dad never did figure out we could hear everything that went on in their bedroom thru that vent.
SUPMALE:Screaming and yelling and crying.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We never did hear any sex unless that's what all the crying and yelling was about.
SUPMALE:Well, it helped us figure out how bad trouble we were in.
LEADMALE:Five minutes before the knock on the door.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But that was a help.
LEADMALE:Gave us a chance to run in and confess, score those honesty points.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, or get our stories straight.
OTHERFEMALE:You remember the week we took turns listening to see if they knew about bloomington? Yeah, that frat party.
LEADFEMALE:We were may too mature for high school guys.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so we end up with these future doctors and lawyers playing up, up and away on their armpits.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:We slept in a car.
SUPFEMALE:What were we thinking? We could have gotten really hurt, you know, and mom and dad had no idea where we were.
LEADFEMALE:But i guess that's just the crazy kind of stuff kids do.
SUPMALE:Oh, gee, jackie, that sounds just like what darlene did.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i'm just no better than her.
SUPMALE:How could i be so blind? My point exactly.
LEADFEMALE:When you remember to water your chia pet, you can criticize the way i raise my kids.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, wait.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, so what we did was stupid.
LEADMALE:But if we would have gotten caught, we would have gotten busted and deserved it.
OTHERMALE:Yes, but darlene says that what she did was important.
LEADMALE:She said the same thing when she shaved d.j. 's head.
OTHERFEMALE:The comic book thing means a lot to her.
OTHERFEMALE:I believe her, because she gave me hell for not sticking up for her.
SUPMALE:Usually when she's mad at you, she's nice to me.
LEADFEMALE:Now we're on the same side.
SUPMALE:That just stinks.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, so this thing is really important to her.
LEADFEMALE:I never told her to quit the comic book thing.
OTHERFEMALE:You did, kind of, 'cause david does the pictures.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:, i get it.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's our living room, jackie.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Couch there.
LEADFEMALE:Tv there.
LEADMALE:Blue barcalounger.
OTHERFEMALE:Green shag carpeting as far as the eye could see.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You remember that oil painting that was there? It was a picture of a long, winding road.
OTHERFEMALE:I used to stare at that thing for hours.
OTHERMALE:That's 'cause i told you it was the andy griffith show.
SUPMALE:You were so mean to me.
LEADMALE:I was not.
LEADMALE:Yes, you were! You lied to me all the time.
SUPMALE:You'd tease me and pinch me.
OTHERMALE:Mom would say, "just ignore her and she'll stop.
LEADFEMALE:" mom never understood me.
OTHERMALE:My field hockey trophy was right here, and this is the clock that mom got when aunt betty died.
LEADFEMALE:The fish! oh, god! yeah! Dad's stuffed swordfish deal.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I remember crying when he brought that thing home.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's 'cause i told you it was flipper.
SUPFEMALE:God, i'm-i was such an idiot! And, uh, remember what was over there, jackie? We don't need to get into this.
LEADFEMALE:We're having a good time here.
SUPFEMALE:You want to get into our memories.
LEADMALE:This is part of our memories.
LEADMALE:The belt.
SUPFEMALE:Dad's belt, o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:? It was roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Parents spanked their kids back then.
OTHERMALE:Spanked? Come on, jackie.
LEADMALE:He hit us with a belt.
SUPMALE:Well, kids got hit with belts.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but did their dads strap some big razor strap on the wall right by the front door, so when you came in you'd see it and always worry what would happen if you stepped out of line? Maybe he was trying to psyche us out.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well.
LEADMALE:He was good at that.
LEADMALE:Remember he'd make us bring it to him? Well, mom wasn't any help either.
LEADMALE:She could have said something.
SUPFEMALE:She'd just stay in there washing dishes.
SUPFEMALE:That was mom.
SUPFEMALE:Ignore it, and it'll go away.
SUPMALE:She let the damn thing hang there, and we're supposed to explain why it's there to our friends? I told people it was elvis' belt.
OTHERMALE:Well, yeah.
OTHERMALE:But you had stupid friends.
LEADMALE:Or they were just trying to be nice.
LEADFEMALE:Let's face it, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Our family was like totally screwed up, which is probably why i got fat and you can't have any decent relationship with any man.
SUPFEMALE:Or maybe i just never found the right guy, and you never found the wrong doughnut.
OTHERFEMALE:Well that's probably how we survived.
LEADFEMALE:We could always make each other laugh.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Are you sorry you came? No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:'cause i think, well, you know, we probably needed to do this.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, house.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Man.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go pick up a couple of burgers.
LEADMALE:Yeahor sailors.
LEADFEMALE:Captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
LEADFEMALE:Public performance of captions prohibited without permission of so? Not bad.
SUPMALE:I divided everything into sections-automotive, gardening, and home repair.
LEADMALE:That's a lot better than the animal, vegetable, mineral system you had going, dan.
LEADMALE:Tools on the pegboard? isn't that what you wanted? It's fine.
SUPMALE:What's all this? I divided the nuts and bolts and screws and nails and put them in separate jars.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? Next time, check with me first.
SUPMALE:Well, am i done? I guess.
SUPFEMALE:So here's the deal-you're off of grounding and you can see david.
OTHERMALE:Really? Thanks to your aunt jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:But-you mess up in any way, and he's gone.
LEADFEMALE:You got it? Yeah, o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Now, go spread joy.
OTHERMALE:Whee! Man, this place is almost as clean as the kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:There's actually room for my truck.
LEADMALE:You ain't driving that filthy thing in here.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez, this is unbelievable! You know, report cards are coming up.
SUPFEMALE:I bet we can get her to build us a pool.
LEADFEMALE:This is so unfair.
LEADMALE:When i started seeing mark, you guys made it impossible.
LEADMALE:You totally caved on this david thing.
SUPMALE:This sucks.
SUPFEMALE:It's not the same.
LEADFEMALE:She's not dating this boy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please! you know she's gonna! What do you want, becky? I'm sick of the double standard around here.
SUPMALE:I want us both to be treated the same.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:Then you get started on cleaning up the basement! Why do i bother? Nice save on the double-standard deal.
LEADMALE:But you know, we don't have to see it as a double standard.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see it as different kids need different rules.
OTHERMALE:Yes, that's good.
SUPMALE:And we didn't cave on this david thing.
LEADFEMALE:We adapted to a difficult situation.
SUPMALE:Well done, my man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i got one.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene isn't totally out of control.
OTHERFEMALE:She's spunky.
LEADMALE:Quite.
LEADFEMALE:This happens every time those two guys have a sleep-over.
LEADMALE:D.j. , quit bouncing that ball! you, too, todd! Now, see, you didn't tell them not to jump up and down on the bed.
LEADMALE:Dan, go up there.
SUPFEMALE:It's your turn.
LEADFEMALE:I went last time.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I guess if they don't listen to reason, they're sure going to listen to me.
LEADMALE:Now, listen up! there will be no talking, no giggling or laughing, no playing music, no singing, no animal noises, no doing whatever the hell you were doing when you were making that peg-leg kind of thumping noise, no bird calls, no bouncing the ball, and no jumping on the bed, or i'm coming up there! now, go to sleep! Ohh that ought to cover it.
SUPFEMALE:Ohhgod, i'm going to be so tired tomorrow, i won't be able to think.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Me, too, but luckily, i'll be at work.
SUPMALE:Did i say no burping? I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:Loophole.
LEADFEMALE:You can't think of everything, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, come on.
SUPFEMALE:It's your turn now.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Come on, roseanne, look at this counter.
LEADMALE:You know, you're right.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:I give up.
LEADMALE:You're fired.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha ha hey, i'm not kidding, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I am the boss, and you're the help.
OTHERFEMALE:If you can't accept that, i can call security, and they'll escort you out.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:I'll clean the counter, adolf.
LEADMALE:That's better.
SUPMALE:God, i really hate having to suck up like that.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Ever since he broke up with steven, he's such a crab.
OTHERFEMALE:I know something you don't know what? Tell me.
LEADMALE:Well, yesterday while leon was at work, steven brought a truck to his house, took all the furniture and his entire cd collection.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:I swear.
OTHERFEMALE:I heard him on the phone.
LEADMALE:I mean, he's really hurting.
LEADFEMALE:I think i'll be nicer to him today.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're on your own.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne? Hi, kathy.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry to bother you at work.
SUPFEMALE:This is about todd.
SUPMALE:My son's exhausted today.
SUPMALE:You knew his bedtime was 9:00.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I got your memo, you know, that he's allergic to strawberries and he can't sleep on polyester and he's a-b positive.
OTHERFEMALE:A-b negative, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You could have killed him.
SUPFEMALE:I'm exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just tell me my punishment, and then we'll move on? When i tell todd to go to sleep, he goes to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, the boys were planning another sleep-over tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Since you're so good at putting people to sleep, why don't you take them? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Send d.j. over after dinner.
SUPMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Ciao.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll be watching the sunrise.
SUPMALE:Who was that? That is my lovely neighbor.
LEADMALE:Oh, the ice-pop lady, eh? Frozen solid with a great big stick up her butt.
SUPMALE:He's baaaack stop it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, i just got word that upper management, in its infinite wisdom, has decided to use our funky little luncheonette for part of some ill-conceived tv commercial.
LEADMALE:Cool.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to be on tv? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:I could be wrong here, but i'm guessing the waitresses will be played by friendly, courteous types who don't wander off to nap in the mattress department.
LEADFEMALE:Meanwhile, this whole place has to be scrubbed from top to bottom per the orders of my weaselly little boss.
LEADMALE:Oh, he's got one of them, too, huh? They'll be filming people eating in this area, so i want all these booths scrubbed down.
LEADMALE:Are they paying these people to sit and eat? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:$50 for the day.
LEADMALE:Hey, i'll take a table for six.
SUPFEMALE:I have no control over this, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:No, but you could put in a good word.
LEADMALE:Perhaps.
LEADMALE:But why? Because, um, maybe i'll go out and buy you a brand-new liza minnelli cd.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What do you know? I know about heartache.
LEADFEMALE:This is such a joke.
LEADFEMALE:We go to the mall on saturday sit around pretending we like lousy food? what's your problem? We've been rehearsing for this all our lives.
LEADMALE:It's a lie.
SUPFEMALE:It's demeaning.
LEADFEMALE:It represents everything i hate.
SUPMALE:Then why are you doing it? Money.
SUPMALE:Not me.
LEADFEMALE:It's in my blood.
LEADMALE:Hiya, friends.
LEADFEMALE:Discount dan here for rodbell's.
LEADMALE:If you're like me-born to shop-you'll appreciate the convenience and value of dining at rodbell's, where, "there's always something under the gravy.
LEADFEMALE:" hey! Ho.
SUPFEMALE:Must be my ride to hollywood.
SUPMALE:Morning, dan.
SUPMALE:Hey, jerry.
LEADMALE:Want some coffee? I'm taking the boys to school.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. ! No, he spent the night at my house, dan.
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:I'd better get going, too.
SUPMALE:Are you coming, darlene? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, mr.
SUPMALE:Bowman, i heard you and mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:.
LEADFEMALE:Bowman screaming last night.
SUPMALE:Way to stand your ground.
SUPMALE:Very impressive.
LEADFEMALE:So i guess the whole block heard us, huh? Nothing to be embarrassed about, jer.
LEADMALE:When you said, "we ain't moving back to chicago, and that's final," men all over the neighborhood took a little bit more of the blanket.
LEADMALE:Really? To be honest, i didn't think you had it in you.
LEADMALE:To be honest, we're moving back to chicago.
LEADMALE:Jerry, jerry, jerry, why? Wellman's in big trouble-big cutbacks in management.
LEADMALE:My job's one of the first to go.
SUPFEMALE:Man, i'm sorry to hear that.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, it happens.
LEADMALE:Couldn't you find something else here? Probably not for the money i was making.
LEADMALE:It's o.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:A job's waiting in chicago.
OTHERMALE:What kind of job? It's like a like a son-in-law job.
OTHERMALE:Jerry, jerry, jerry, it's not gonna say that on your parking space, is it? I just wanted to let you know.
LEADMALE:We'll be selling the house, and kathy asked me to ask you if you could if you could, uh clean up your yard.
OTHERMALE:Sure, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:I'm going to miss you, jer.
LEADMALE:Same here, dan.
LEADMALE:What's really tough is separating todd and d.j. those kids get along so great together.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It was nice d.j. having a friend the rest of us could see.
SUPFEMALE:Here comes your sister, ask her.
LEADMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:You ask her.
SUPFEMALE:You ask her.
LEADFEMALE:What do you geeks want to know? what's a virgin? You in 40 years.
OTHERFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:, o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:Everybody excited about the commercial today? Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Guys what are you doing? Chewing.
LEADFEMALE:What about you, dan? I'm a little ahead of you, dear.
LEADMALE:I just swallowed.
LEADMALE:Well, you're supposed to be eating in the commercial today.
OTHERFEMALE:If you ruin your appetites now, you'll never be able to eat on camera.
LEADMALE:Is that so? I can't wait to go back to chicago and leave stupid lanford.
SUPFEMALE:Lanford's not stupid.
LEADMALE:Chicago's stupid.
OTHERMALE:It is not.
SUPMALE:Chicago's got everything.
LEADMALE:Does not.
SUPMALE:Does, too.
LEADMALE:There's a park near my house better than anything here.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to have to join a gang.
LEADMALE:No way.
OTHERMALE:And my friends have better games.
SUPFEMALE:Then go play with them.
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Give me that.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Then i'm leaving.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:I mean it.
SUPMALE:It's getting really ugly in there.
LEADMALE:The way todd yaks about chicago, i wouldn't play with him, either.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, todd's a nice boy, though.
SUPMALE:He's good for d.j. , too.
LEADFEMALE:Since they've been playing together, the squirrel population has doubled.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so glad we're moving away from you.
SUPMALE:You're only moving to chicago 'cause your mom needs an operation.
LEADFEMALE:She does n0t.
LEADFEMALE:She does, too.
SUPFEMALE:My mom said she's having a big stick taken out of her butt.
SUPFEMALE:Like looking in a mirror, ain't it? Check the high heels on barbarella over there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:She steps on one moist carrot and her bony butt's going to slide all the way to garden supplies.
LEADFEMALE:Look at the cashier and her customer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, who, stephen and sharon stunning there? Yeah, they look real.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Deej, isn't this fun? No.
LEADMALE:You know, buddy, maybe todd's scared about moving to chicago, and he's trying to be tough about it.
SUPMALE:I don't care.
LEADMALE:Ohh he's still upset? Yeah.
LEADMALE:He didn't even want to measure his head in the shoe department.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, beck.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's darlene? They said she couldn't be in the commercial dressed like death.
LEADMALE:She go home? Not yet.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:Why, darlene, you look-shut up.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:It's not so-shut up.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want us to do? Just sit here and smile.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you think? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I think so.
SUPMALE:You sure they look right? Well, let me get a second opinion.
SUPMALE:Leon, come over here.
LEADMALE:We're looking at this family here.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:I'll get rid of them.
SUPMALE:No, no.
OTHERMALE:We're thinking of using them as the average family.
LEADMALE:Well, aren't they a bit too swap-meet for rodbell's? Oh, no, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Believe me, it's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:This is what america's coming to.
LEADMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:That's the family.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to be on tv, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.

LEADMALE:Me, too.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to wash up.
LEADMALE:I got to make the kid's dinner for tomorrow night.
SUPFEMALE:I'd offer to help, but it would be a shallow, insincere gesture.
LEADMALE:Get lost, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man! I stayed up till 1:30 making this casserole.
SUPMALE:How come you didn't eat it? Gee, mom, i guess it wasn't a casserole kind of day.
LEADMALE:What did you eat? I wasn't hungry.
LEADFEMALE:What about d.j. ? did he eat? Becky gave him cereal or something.
LEADMALE:Cereal? If he wanted cereal, there's plenty of cereal in the casserole.
LEADFEMALE:Did he brush his teeth or take a bath? I don't know.
LEADMALE:You put him to sleep? I didn't know i had that option.
SUPFEMALE:Where have you been? Out for pizza with mark.
SUPMALE:You guys are totally useless.
LEADFEMALE:This place is a pigsty.
LEADFEMALE:Pick it up.
OTHERMALE:It's all darlene's stuff.
OTHERMALE:These shoes are yours.
SUPMALE:The socks and sweat shirt are yours.
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:What about these magazines? Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:The porch is a big mess, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, real mature, mom.
LEADMALE:This family is falling apart, dan.
LEADMALE:Tough to stop a moving train, honey.
LEADMALE:I can't work at the shop anymore.
LEADFEMALE:We've been through this.
LEADFEMALE:I got too much to do-the restaurant, the kids.
OTHERMALE:I quit.
LEADMALE:You can't quit.
LEADFEMALE:You're an owner.
OTHERFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:Well, then i'm fired.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do repair work and watch the shop.
LEADFEMALE:Something has to change around here.
SUPFEMALE:You guys get in here.
LEADFEMALE:How'd they get so spoiled when we've given them absolutely nothing? Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:We're having a family meeting.
OTHERFEMALE:What a bunch of crap.
LEADMALE:Those are the minutes of our last meeting.
LEADFEMALE:Now on to new business.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, here's the deal-we're having a tough time now, girls.
LEADMALE:We're turning the corner on the bike shop, which means we're killing ourselves.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't help, we won't make it.
LEADFEMALE:All right, dad.
SUPFEMALE:We're sorry we let you down.
OTHERFEMALE:Meeting adjourned.
LEADMALE:Darlene, don't, because no matter how lousy your life is now, we can make it much worse.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's what i see-nothing's getting done around here because nobody takes responsibility for anything, o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? So from now on, becky, i'm leaving you in charge.
SUPFEMALE:I have a problem with that.
SUPFEMALE:Tough.
LEADMALE:I'm just supposed to do whatever she says? Listen to becky like you listen to us.
LEADMALE:Um, now i have a problem.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you'll work it out.
OTHERFEMALE:Take care of your brother.
OTHERMALE:Make sure that he washes himself and does his homework.
LEADFEMALE:And you make sure that he eats, too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to weigh that little boy every night.
SUPFEMALE:If he loses more than two pounds, it's your butt.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Now, go clean something.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Good idea.
LEADMALE:They're always crying we don't treat them like adults.
LEADMALE:Now we are.
LEADMALE:This may work.
SUPMALE:Are you insane? I just put becky in charge.
LEADFEMALE:That's like putting fredo in charge of the corleone family.
LEADMALE:They may surprise us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, dan.
SUPFEMALE:The family's doomed unless i get out of that shop.
SUPFEMALE:Once we sell a few bikes, maybe we can replace you.
OTHERMALE:If i sell a bike, i can get out of there? That's one way to look at it.
SUPFEMALE:I thought of us as more of a team.
LEADFEMALE:You and me against the world, husband and wife.
SUPFEMALE:Partners.
SUPMALE:Any bike, right? I know duke has a bike, but you don't.
OTHERMALE:I don't need a bike.
LEADFEMALE:I ride behind duke.
SUPFEMALE:That's how it'll be the rest of your life? you'll ride behind him? not on his side, not equal to him, but like behind him? You have permission to smack her.
OTHERMALE:You ever think of getting a motorcycle? Roseanne, name me one guy that hasn't pictured himself on a big chopper going down a country road with the wind in his hair.
LEADMALE:We've got some really great-the answer is me.
SUPMALE:I'm the guy.
LEADFEMALE:All i'm asking is for one person to buy one lousy motorcycle.
LEADFEMALE:Is that too much to ask? roseanne, what is your problem? I have all of your pms days circled on my calendar.
SUPFEMALE:This is not one of them.
OTHERMALE:Oh, i'm just really stressed out, leon.
LEADMALE:Oh, i understand.
LEADMALE:You need a little distraction.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever considered waitressing? All right.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:Oh, look.
LEADMALE:There's jackie.
SUPMALE:Hold this, would you? Jackie, you look great.
LEADMALE:I love the dress.
SUPMALE:Your hair is great.
LEADMALE:I don't like this job.
SUPFEMALE:What's the matter with it? like to sample our new fragrance? That's all i do all day long.
LEADFEMALE:Like to sample our new fragrance? God, i'm annoying.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you begged me to pull some strings and get you that job.
LEADFEMALE:But i thought, make-up department, i'd do make-overs, like a cosmetician.
SUPFEMALE:You've got to work your way up.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you know how many squirt girls have to die before i make cosmetician? Fine, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Try my life.
SUPMALE:Work at the bike shop for no money, then come to this dump and work for preppie the clown here.
SUPMALE:Oh, that reminds me.
LEADFEMALE:I need friday off, o.
OTHERMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? I don't know, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Where can i find somebody to stand in my restaurant and do nothing on such short notice? see what i have to put up with? Now this bike isn't for everybody.
LEADFEMALE:This is a real outlaw bike.
SUPMALE:It's like the beast master.
LEADFEMALE:And this is called our commuter special.
LEADFEMALE:See this seat right here? It's really cool.
SUPMALE:Because there's nothing for her to hold onto.
LEADFEMALE:She's got to wrap herself around you real good or splat.
LEADMALE:And the baby fits real snug right here in the safety seat.
SUPMALE:Oh, so your name's murray, huh? that's really a coincidence, because you know evel knievel? His real first name is murray.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Murray knievel.
SUPMALE:It's loud, and it's mean.
OTHERMALE:It screams get out of my damn way.
LEADFEMALE:Not a single dolphin was harmed to make this motorcycle.
LEADMALE:We're open till 10:00.
SUPFEMALE:We're here till 11:00.
LEADMALE:Every night till midnight.
LEADFEMALE:We never close.
SUPFEMALE:We never close.
OTHERFEMALE:Never close.
LEADMALE:Never close.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is disgusting.
SUPMALE:If you don't like it, don't eat it.
SUPMALE:I don't know what the hell it is.
LEADFEMALE:It's spaghetti with 1000 island dressing.
LEADMALE:God, that is so gross.
LEADMALE:After doing the laundry and vacuuming, there wasn't time to plan an exciting menu.
LEADFEMALE:I ran around all day picking d.j. up from school, taking him to get shoes, going to the supermarket-and when i get home, i expect a decent meal.
OTHERMALE:Don't they make a lovely couple? remember when we were first married? We had bread and mayonnaise for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you make that anymore? I say we run for it.
LEADMALE:Mother! You will not believe what darlene just made for dinner.
LEADMALE:Hey, d.j. loves it.
LEADMALE:D.j. eats hair.
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you, you better make something edible for dinner tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:Or you'll spank me? This goes on all day.
SUPFEMALE:Total disrespect.
LEADMALE:I won't be referee.
OTHERFEMALE:Your dad and me are working 15-hour days.
LEADMALE:Run the house without us.
LEADMALE:But you're home now.
LEADMALE:No, we're not.
LEADMALE:Dan, i tried everything today to sell a bike.
LEADFEMALE:I lied.
LEADMALE:I pushed.
SUPMALE:I nagged.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you went with your strengths, dear.
LEADFEMALE:How come none of it worked? I didn't have any more luck than you did.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, i've had it.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene refuses to do the dishes, and it's her turn.
SUPFEMALE:I cooked.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that not enough? what should i do about her? Becky, i told you you're in charge.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just going to leave the dishes where they are, and tomorrow they'll be covered with dried crud.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow night it's leftovers.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, dan, these biker magazines ain't nothing but a bunch of naked ladies sitting up on motorcycles.
LEADFEMALE:That is so degrading to women.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, every one of these girls has a mother out there somewhere who's dying of shame.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait.
SUPMALE:I'm wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a naked girl and her naked mother in the sidecar.
SUPMALE:Customer.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's just you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's just you, too.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here? I had a bad day.
OTHERFEMALE:I need to whine.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? I sprayed perfume on some woman, and she kicked me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she didn't want to get sprayed.
SUPMALE:No one wants to be sprayed, but damn it, i had a quota.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hi, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:What smells? Remember, i told you, honey.
LEADMALE:Jackie's the perfume sniper at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Hey, how you doing? Ok.
LEADMALE:Anything i can help you with? I'm, uh, just looking.
SUPFEMALE:I pass this place daily, thought i'd check it out.
LEADFEMALE:You ride? I always wanted to.
LEADMALE:Well, what are you waiting for? My wife would never let me.
LEADFEMALE:I understand.
SUPMALE:Feel free to look around.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:His wife's a big boogey.
OTHERMALE:I ride.
SUPFEMALE:Bring your wife by, and i'll giver her a pep talk.
LEADMALE:I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:We just got a divorce.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry to hear that.
OTHERFEMALE:That's too bad.
LEADMALE:It happens.
SUPMALE:Uh, well, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:I bet it would bug your wife to see you on one of these now.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You end up with a bike you wanted, and what does she end up with, the kids? It would definitely kill her.
LEADMALE:Definitely.
LEADFEMALE:You got him.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, what's your name? Uh, art.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, art.
LEADFEMALE:I'm roseanne, and this is jackie.
LEADMALE:Hi, art.
LEADFEMALE:What do you do for a living? No, wait.
LEADMALE:Let us guess.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, what do you think art does? oh, i couldn't test pilot? S.
SUPMALE:W.
LEADMALE:A.
OTHERFEMALE:T.
LEADMALE:Team? Thank you, uh, but i'm an accountant.
SUPFEMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:Impossible.
SUPMALE:Why don't you get up on this bike? Let's see what you look like on there.
SUPMALE:Art.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know something, art? what? Oh, never mind.
LEADMALE:I'm married.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you something about this bike.
LEADMALE:Not only does it deliver but i mean, it's roomy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, she's right there.
LEADMALE:Art, she is right.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that.
LEADMALE:Plenty of room.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, guys.
LEADMALE:You'd say just about anything, so i'll buy a bike.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute, art.
LEADMALE:I sell three, four of these every day.
SUPFEMALE:I got no reason to lie to you.
OTHERMALE:I'm just telling you.
LEADMALE:This bike looks like it was made for you.
LEADFEMALE:You know what i mean? Picture it.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to work.
SUPFEMALE:You pull into that parking lot.
LEADFEMALE:You're surrounded by accountant-type cars.
SUPMALE:And you show up riding one of these things.
LEADMALE:The engine's roaring, the tires are squealing, and your loins are vibrating like a tuning fork.
SUPMALE:Uh, you're very good.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen, i'm having a great time, and i don't really want you to stop, but, uh, i i still don't know if it's right for me.
SUPMALE:Well, your choice.
LEADFEMALE:So, think your wife's dating anybody, art? No way jackie gets the commission, i sold the bike.
LEADFEMALE:You did use her as bait.
LEADMALE:You smelled her.
SUPMALE:What would you use her as? Spread out.
LEADMALE:Let me see it again.
LEADMALE:This here's my favorite check in the whole world.
LEADMALE:It's such a rush, isn't it? I remember first finding that bike.
SUPFEMALE:It was a rusted out piece of junk.
LEADMALE:I took it to the shop, pounded out the dents, i rechromed it, i repainted it.
SUPMALE:Boring.
SUPFEMALE:Get to the part where i smoked the guy into buying it.
LEADMALE:You were beautiful.
SUPMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:How's everything going around here? Mr.
OTHERMALE:Mom decided i get to stay home and sit for d.j. while she goes out with mark, the cold sore king.
LEADMALE:At least you're working it out.
SUPMALE:Darlene, do you know where my car keys are? Why, yes, my fuhrer.
LEADFEMALE:Where? In a safe place.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, as safe as where your science paper now is? Becky, that's due tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:It's not even mine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:We have to talk.
LEADMALE:We definitely do, darlene.
LEADMALE:Upstairs.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll note they did not bring the problem to me.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything's going according to plan.
LEADFEMALE:So, dear, would you like a cup of coffee? Don't mind as i do.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how's it going, champ? your sisters make sure you took a bath? No.
SUPMALE:They didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Did they? Well, it's too late to take one tonight, so go ahead and go on up to bed, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Night, d.j. night, deej.
SUPMALE:D.j. , we say good night, you say good night.
SUPFEMALE:Are you mad at us? how come you're not talking? I haven't said anything in two days, and nobody's cared.
LEADMALE:That's not possible.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:The last thing i said was cheerios.
LEADFEMALE:Deej, we've been real busy.
LEADMALE:Daddy and me are working hard to start this new business.
SUPMALE:I guess we didn't notice.
LEADFEMALE:We've been thinking about you the whole time.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:Hold on, d.j. forget everything i just said.
OTHERFEMALE:We're so sorry, honey.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we're really sorry.
LEADMALE:You go up and brush your teeth and get in bed, and me and daddy will read you a story.
OTHERFEMALE:Any story? even a long one? Even one we already read o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be up in a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Ouch.
SUPMALE:I really screwed up, but i'll be home a lot more now.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:He can hang out with me at the shop.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:He'll like that.
SUPFEMALE:You still want any coffee? No.
LEADMALE:I'm too beat.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Let's go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe we forgot about him again.
LEADFEMALE:He better learn how to bitch and moan like his sisters, or he won't make it in this family.
LEADMALE:Come here.
SUPFEMALE:How come you're not at the mall? I'm on a break.
LEADMALE:You came all the way down here, that's some long break.
SUPFEMALE:In 10 minutes it will be a whole day.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just not cut out for that squirt business.
LEADMALE:Look at these magazines.
SUPMALE:I just buy them for pictures of the naked women.
LEADMALE:Jacks, can you i can get that.
LEADFEMALE:Lanford custom cycle.
SUPMALE:No, she's not-she's not in right now, mom.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hi, it's me.
SUPMALE:Oh, i'm o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:How are you doing? Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm not seeing anybody else yet.
LEADMALE:Listen, hey, mom, the other line is ringing, so i'm just going to put you on hold for one second.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Hang on.
OTHERMALE:Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la la oh, my, oh, well let's vogue.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:You guys can't write off some of this stuff you have down here.
SUPFEMALE:Those are business expenses.
LEADMALE:$1,200 for "a boob job"? It's not a boob job.
SUPFEMALE:It's a breast reduction.
OTHERFEMALE:We're taking it as a loss.
LEADFEMALE:I buy it.
LEADFEMALE:I, uhi don't think the irs will, but it is medical, so you can write it off as a personal deduction.
LEADFEMALE:Dy-no-mite! Now, um is this your monthly balance? Because you seem to be a little short on cash.
LEADMALE:That must be the wrong page.
SUPFEMALE:We're not short on cash.
LEADFEMALE:We actually have none.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what happened to all that snowmobile repair work, dan? Did it.
SUPMALE:Spent it.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, look, i'll, uh, i'll run all this stuff through my computer, and when i have your returns ready, i'll give you a call.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, art.
OTHERMALE:Listen, what do we owe you? I could write you a check.
LEADMALE:You kill me, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene, heard that joke you made up about trudy burke.
LEADMALE:It's really funny.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:The beauty part is, it doesn't just have to be about trudy.
LEADFEMALE:It works for any girl with a mustache.
LEADFEMALE:Did you know that trudy heard it, too? Good.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she'll pull a comb through that thing.
LEADMALE:Another good one.
OTHERFEMALE:You can tell her that tomorrow when she's beating the crap out of you.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? She doesn't know that joke was mine.
LEADFEMALE:Did i forget to tell you your friend stacy ratted you out? why'd she do that? So trudy would let her out of her locker.
SUPMALE:All right, so trudy knows.
LEADFEMALE:But i mouth off to everybody.
LEADMALE:People love that about me.
LEADMALE:Look on the bright side.
LEADMALE:You may really like your new face.
SUPFEMALE:And, man, he is so smart.
SUPMALE:He knows so much stuff about taxes and everything.
LEADMALE:I swear, it's fascinating.
LEADMALE:Taxes are fascinating, roseanne? Well, not normally, you know, but when art's talking about it, i swear, you laugh, you cry.
LEADMALE:Not my type.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you don't know that.
LEADMALE:You're telling me i don't know my type? Well, he's cute, and he's funny.
LEADFEMALE:He looks like the lucky charms guy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's what's inside that counts, jackie.
LEADMALE:And inside, this guy has a time-share condo in florida.
LEADMALE:Can we drop it, please? I'm trying to tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:Can i say one more thing about it? why can't you date him? roseanne! What do you want to tell me? I'm thinking about going into therapy.
SUPFEMALE:You mean like a shrink? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Why? There's a lot of reasons.
OTHERMALE:Like what? Oh, i just haven't been happy lately, and with mom and dad breaking up, it makes me think how crazy our childhood was, and there's a lot of stuff i've got to deal with.
SUPFEMALE:When would you start? Two months ago.
SUPFEMALE:What? I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:That stinks.
SUPFEMALE:I'm your sister and you go and do something that major without even talking to me first? Calm down.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really upset about this.
SUPMALE:How come you can talk to some stranger and you can't talk to me? Because when i tell her my problems, we don't spend the next hour talking about how that makes her feel.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it is a good idea, then.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you told me.
LEADFEMALE:Finally.
OTHERFEMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:You know, art goes to therapy.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hey.
SUPFEMALE:I had an idea about the shop.
LEADMALE:I'm not sure if it's crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's run it by jackie and find out.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne! Does everybody have to know about this? I was only going to tell dan.
LEADMALE:It's a very personal thing.
OTHERFEMALE:He's family.
SUPMALE:I'm asking you to keep it to yourself.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, i won't tell dan.
SUPMALE:All righty.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to take off now.
LEADMALE:I'll call you later.
LEADFEMALE:What's the idea with the shop? Arnie came by this afternoon with a tattoo artist.
OTHERMALE:He wants to rent part of the shop-and he could bring by a lot of bikers.
SUPMALE:A tattoo guy? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERMALE:I didn't commit to anything.
LEADMALE:I'll have art check out the deal.
LEADMALE:Well, what's this guy like? I didn't talk to him much, but i think he's a very talented artist who's paid his debt to society.
LEADMALE:Gil here, he's the absolute best.
LEADMALE:People come to him from all over.
LEADMALE:Damn it, you're hitting bone! Don't pay attention to me.
LEADMALE:It's easier than it seems.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, it's kind of a macho thing.
LEADMALE:Oh, mommy! Excuse us one moment.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think, art? Uh, i don't know, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Financially, it's a good idea, but personally, i got to wonder about a guy who's covered his entire body with tattoos.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Think he's got one on mr.
LEADMALE:Winkie? I don't really want to know, dan.
OTHERMALE:Danny, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Nice work.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Want one? On the house.
LEADMALE:Ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! Pretty tempting there, gil.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe some other time.
SUPMALE:Get roseanne's name on the old bicep there.
SUPMALE:The babes dig that.
LEADFEMALE:I got a chicken pox scar on my arm looks just like her.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Hey, honey.
LEADMALE:Say hello to gil.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? Hi, gil.
LEADMALE:He's the tattoo guy.
OTHERFEMALE:No kidding? So, uh, art.
LEADMALE:Jackie say hi to art.
SUPMALE:How you doing, art? Hi, jackie.
SUPMALE:Anybody going to say hi to me? Well, we've got to go.
LEADMALE:I got to try to get some money out of dan first.
LEADFEMALE:This might take a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I better be going.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Take it easy, art.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, jackie, i was wondering if i could talk to you for a second? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh how's it going? Great.
LEADFEMALE:You? Great, great, uh tax season.
OTHERFEMALE:Busy, busy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i bet.
OTHERMALE:Um i hear you're a trucker.
LEADMALE:That must be really interesting.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that keeps me busy.
LEADMALE:As a matter of fact, i get so busy sometimes, i have very little time left for a social life.
SUPFEMALE:It sounds kind of lonely.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i figure if you're o.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPMALE:With yourself, then you're o.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:With being alone.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I--i i'm alone a lot, too.
LEADMALE:You seem to be dealing really well with that.
LEADMALE:Um sometimes.
SUPMALE:Sometimes.
SUPMALE:But, um i was thinking maybesome night when you're in town, we could go out to dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Well uh, that would be nice.
SUPFEMALE:I tell you what.
LEADMALE:When things do start to slow down for me, then why don't i give you a call? Got it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, um i better be going.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, give, uh well, say goodbye for me.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:It was nice running into you.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
SUPMALE:Damn.
SUPMALE:So what did art want? You know, i don't think that i've ever been as angry with you as i am right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure, you have.
LEADFEMALE:That was a nice guy, and you forced me to hurt him.
SUPMALE:You didn't even give him a chance.
LEADMALE:I said i didn't want to go out with him, but you wouldn't leave it at that.
OTHERMALE:Well, just one dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm standing right here, and you're not listening to a single word i'm saying! Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Your therapy's working out real good.
LEADMALE:What? you still getting beat up today? Shut up.
SUPMALE:You're eating too much.
LEADMALE:You'll barf.
LEADFEMALE:Just 'cause you followed us home from the circus doesn't mean you can talk to us.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you should listen to him, darlene.
LEADMALE:He gets creamed like every other week.
LEADFEMALE:Fall down early and stay down.
LEADMALE:I can handle this.
OTHERMALE:You can't take her, darlene.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going to try.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll talk my way out of it.
OTHERMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:Just stay down.
LEADFEMALE:You don't believe me? dad, can i talk to you about something? Coming.
OTHERFEMALE:Watch.
SUPMALE:Yeah, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really sorry i called you wide load yesterday.
SUPMALE:I mean, i meant it to be funny, and i really thought you'd laugh.
SUPMALE:I've been thinking about it.
LEADMALE:Now i realize it was really insensitive.
LEADMALE:Darlenetie your hair back real tight so she can't swing you around with it.
OTHERMALE:You're dead, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:Keep your arms in front of your face.
SUPMALE:Eventually she'll wear herself out.
OTHERFEMALE:Are they gone yet? Yeah, honey.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:I love them and everything, but i ain't in the mood.
LEADMALE:How's your headache? It's gone.
LEADMALE:Hey! It's back.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, we need to talk.
SUPFEMALE:We certainly do.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, boy, when's dan going to get out of here? See you later.
LEADMALE:Play nice.
SUPFEMALE:Well i assume you're here to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:I have spoken to my therapist.
LEADMALE:She thinks it would be a good idea if you came down to talk to her.
LEADMALE:Why? You're the nut.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks one reason i may be a nut is because of you.
LEADMALE:What's that supposed to mean? Whenever i talk to her, your name keeps coming up.
LEADFEMALE:You're a very big influence on me, roseanne, and she thinks she can help sort it out.
LEADMALE:We had a fight.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all.
LEADFEMALE:So you're not going to come down.
LEADFEMALE:Is she going to ask us all kind of personal questions and stuff? That is sort of the point.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:Well let's get our story straight before we go down there.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, we're all on the same side, so please don't feel defensive.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not a judge or a referee.
LEADFEMALE:We're both here for one reason-to help jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Get her, doc.
OTHERMALE:Nobody's here to get anybody, nor will we solve the problem in one session.
OTHERMALE:Hey, i have no problem, o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? I'm just here to help out eleanor rigby there.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Now, roseanne-here's where i get yelled at.
SUPMALE:I'd just like to set up boundaries.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, let's work on listening without judging.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, i'm going to ask jackie how she feels.
LEADFEMALE:Some of this may hurt, but i don't want you to answer back.
LEADFEMALE:Instead, i want you to repeat what she said in your own words.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Now, jackie, last session we talked about how choices are difficult for you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well it's just everything i do.
LEADMALE:I'm always wondering what she's going to say because she's so judgmental.
SUPFEMALE:Can you be specific? Well, it's just everything.
SUPMALE:It'sif i'm going to be a cop, what's she going to say? if i cut my hair, will she laugh? If i go out with this guy or if i move or see a movie or buy a book.
SUPFEMALE:It's everything.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:Now, roseanne, what did you just hear? In your own words.
OTHERFEMALE:Why would you want to move out of your apartment? I mean, you pay really low rent.
LEADFEMALE:It's a great place.
SUPFEMALE:You should see it.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's start over.
SUPFEMALE:Uh and remember, roseanne, i'm asking you not to judge her, just to listen to her.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, but she doesn't have to pay utilities.
SUPFEMALE:Even if it is a horrible mistake to move out of my apartment, it's my mistake.
LEADMALE:I'm not one of your children.
SUPFEMALE:Then you go make a mistake, and you come to me to clean it up.
SUPMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:You're my sister.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:So i see.
LEADFEMALE:I can't say anything to stop the mistake, but i mop it up after.
SUPFEMALE:If you loved me, i'd think you'd want to.
LEADFEMALE:You better call for backup.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Uh, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's try something different.
LEADMALE:Let's try a little exercise.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, you go first.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to turn to roseanne and say "you're my sister, and i love you because" and fill in the rest.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:What's taking you so long? Well, o.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:I got it.
SUPMALE:Uh you're my sister, and i love you because you're strong.
LEADFEMALE:That's it? Well, it's not that easy.
OTHERMALE:You do it.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:I will.
LEADFEMALE:You're my sister, and i love you because you're warm and caring and giving and nurturing and kind, but you know, your problem is-hold up.
LEADMALE:Hold up.
SUPFEMALE:Try it without the but.
LEADFEMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:You're my sister, and i love you because we've shared so many things, although-uh, that's another but.
LEADMALE:I don't like this game.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go back to the listening deal.
SUPMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
LEADMALE:We'll come back to this later.
LEADMALE:Jackie, your turn to listen.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, tell me, how do you feel when you think jackie's making a mistake? Well, i worry about her.
LEADFEMALE:Why? 'cause i don't want her to get hurt, and if i can see some way of preventing that, i'll say something.
SUPMALE:Jackie? in your own words? I mean, i know this art isn't gorgeous or anything, but he'd be nice to her, and he'd protect her.
LEADFEMALE:It wouldn't be so awful to marry such a guy.
SUPMALE:Do you want her married to such a guy so he could take over for you, then you wouldn't have to look out for jackie anymore? are you kidding? what does she know about being married? The thing is, see, i didn't realize i was treating you like a kid.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:I did realize it.
LEADFEMALE:I just--i just didn't think you knew.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least you went with me, and we learned how we can talk this stuff out.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i want you to know that it is, uh, really hard for me to, uh, dialogue with you with a, uh, without a, uh confrontational agenda.
OTHERFEMALE:I hear that, but you've got to learn how to let go of your control issues without that triggering your whole abandonment issue.
LEADMALE:I hear that.
SUPMALE:Now there's one thing i want to say to you in a totally, um non-manipulative and non-judgmental context.
LEADFEMALE:I'm hearing that.
LEADFEMALE:Um o.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPMALE:The responsibility that i feel towards you is all your fault.
OTHERFEMALE:How? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Our time is up.
LEADMALE:Jeez.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Just a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan! phone! I want you to know it's art on the phone, and i'm not saying a thing.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:And i'll try to ease up on you, although it's very hard.
LEADFEMALE:And i'll try and remember that you mean well.
LEADFEMALE:So you want to go to therapy anymore? you want to? Yeah, if you do.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Who is it? Mr.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, art.
LEADMALE:Oh! boundaries! we had boundaries! It was just a joke.
LEADMALE:You're busting the boundaries! I hear you, and i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Will you be back in time for dinner? O.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPMALE:All right, art.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we might have to lose the tattoo guy.
LEADFEMALE:Why for? Our insurance company won't cover him unless we pay more.
SUPFEMALE:It's a shame.
LEADMALE:He does such nice work.
SUPFEMALE:Wow! It's permanent.
LEADFEMALE:Just for you because you are permanent in my life.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, my name's roseanne.
SUPMALE:I call you rose.
LEADMALE:You never do.
SUPMALE:He stopped in the middle.
LEADMALE:Why? It hurt.
LEADMALE:God, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how about rosey? I'll make it rosey.
SUPFEMALE:I could handle a "y.
OTHERFEMALE:" o.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:Again, remember, we're here for jackie.
OTHERMALE:Now who wants to start? I guess i'll go first.
LEADMALE:Um if you're married to the same woman for 19 years, isn't that proof enough that you love her? You know, arlene, he has some other woman's name tattooed on his arm.
LEADMALE:It's your name! it is not my name! It is mrs.
LEADMALE:.
SUPMALE:Kennedy's name! I'll never get this off.
SUPMALE:I'm stuck for the rest of my life.
LEADMALE:Now you know what it's like to be married to you.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez.
LEADFEMALE:Cut it out.
OTHERMALE:I mean, did you forget why we came? Thank you, becky.
OTHERFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:I want to talk about me and mark.
LEADFEMALE:When will you get over him? I can't believe this! You guys aren't here for me at all.
OTHERFEMALE:You're here to work out all your own family crap! Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
SUPFEMALE:I don't mean to interrupt, but it's time for my medication.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Oh, jeez.
LEADMALE:Colonel klink is going to the russian front for this wacky foul-up.
SUPMALE:You think they'd figure out hogan could hear their secret plans after, like, a thousand episodes.
OTHERMALE:Forget that.
SUPMALE:After the second episode, you'd think they'd realize they should be speaking in german.
SUPMALE:You want a soda? Yeah, sure.
SUPMALE:Oh, jeez.
LEADFEMALE:Now they're playing volleyball.
LEADFEMALE:What is this, like, the nazi club med? Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell your mom you're out of chips.
SUPMALE:Let's see what else is on.
SUPMALE:Let's watch this.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? That was not the reaction i was hoping for.
LEADFEMALE:David, we're, like, really good friends.
LEADFEMALE:So? So, i don't think you should cop a cheap feel from a friend.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, my hand's way out of copping range here, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Move it.
SUPMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:Why not.
OTHERMALE:The whole school thinks we're boyfriend and girlfriend.
SUPMALE:So what? I just i put my arm around you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and what was next? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:It took me three weeks to get to that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gross.
LEADFEMALE:You've been planning this? This is the lowest moment of my entire life.
OTHERMALE:Thanks for being a part of it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:You caught me off guard.
LEADMALE:I don't know if i see you that way.
SUPFEMALE:Becky! the next time you let your car hog up the driveway like that, i'm getting it towed to indianapolis! Oh, well, it's not that important.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure she heard you anyway, dear.
SUPMALE:Hey, david.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You know you're out of-here you go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i do.
LEADMALE:Yeah, so, just 'cause rodbell's is missing some stuff, everybody has to take some stupid lie detector test.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't take it.
SUPFEMALE:They can't fire you if you refuse.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, they can.
SUPMALE:They just wouldn't say that that was why.
LEADMALE:They'd say it was 'cause i was always late, or rude to the customers, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:They'd find some tiny little thing.
SUPMALE:What kind of stuff got stolen? They didn't even tell us.
LEADFEMALE:You have nothing to worry about.
OTHERFEMALE:That's just the point.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't take anything.
SUPFEMALE:I really resent rodbell's treating me like i'm some common criminal.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to the big house, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here you go, walter.
LEADMALE:It's unbelievable, roseanne.
SUPMALE:I called the a.
OTHERMALE:C.
SUPFEMALE:L.
LEADFEMALE:U.
LEADFEMALE:, and they told me i cannot be forced to take a lie detector test.
LEADFEMALE:And the minute i'm fired, i should call them.
LEADMALE:What did you swipe, walter? Nothing, roseanne, but that doesn't mean i'm not guilty.
OTHERMALE:A cow died for this burger.
LEADFEMALE:A tree died for this napkin.
SUPMALE:I killed a cow and a tree on my lunch hour.
SUPFEMALE:Am i guilty of murder? I would have to say yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not just me, roseanne.
SUPMALE:W-w-we're all guilty! He's lucky.
LEADMALE:He can plead insanity.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't know how this happened, but suddenly, ladies, we are overstocked with half-empty jars of mustard and mayonnaise.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody have anything to say? Uh all right.
LEADMALE:Uh leon, i took some things home from the restaurant.
SUPMALE:I know it's illegal, and i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:That's why i brought them back.
LEADMALE:Bonnie, don't you think i notice that you leave here lumpier than when you come in? now, i have always tried to look the other way when you've taken condiments, but how can i do that if you keep bringing them back? I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I figured if i brought them back, then when they ask me if i stole anything, i could just say i borrowed them.
SUPFEMALE:You're not gonna bust her, are you, leon? Of course not.
LEADMALE:Then could you help me? I got a vat of steak sauce in my car.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, i hate to burst your bubble, but your little plan isn't going to work.
SUPMALE:You see, once you believe that you've stolen something, it'll show up on the polygraph.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but like she said, we were just borrowing it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you borrowed a full jar, and when you brought it back, it was half-empty.
SUPFEMALE:Now, don't you believe that that was stealing? Well, i do now, thanks to you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, way to go, leon.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You got a few minutes? Yeah, sure.
SUPMALE:My break doesn't start for a half-hour.
LEADMALE:Well, i was thinking did darlene tell you about what happened last night? Of course.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i thought maybe we should talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, well do want some pie or something? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Isn't that darlene's little boyfriend? Darlene doesn't have a boyfriend.
SUPMALE:And yes.
SUPMALE:What did he mean by that? what happened last night? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Darlene never tells me a thing.
LEADMALE:Well, here you go.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, we'll talk.
OTHERMALE:You start.
LEADMALE:Mark said you were always trashing on him to becky and that's why she broke up with him.
SUPMALE:Come on, david.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it.
OTHERMALE:I'm not like my brother.
OTHERMALE:I think mark is the biggest jerk on the planet.
LEADMALE:You were right to try to keep him away from becky.
SUPMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:You're sucking up.
LEADMALE:That's better.
SUPFEMALE:So i guess i'm just asking you not to sink me with darlene.
LEADMALE:So i'm just supposed to forget about what happened last night, is that it? Nothing happened.
LEADMALE:I put my arm around her, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:What did she tell you? I really can't tell you that, david.
SUPMALE:Uh but i will tell you this-darlene is a lot like i was.
LEADFEMALE:When i first starting dating mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, you know, oh, we took it real slow, you know? 'cause that's what i needed at the time.
SUPMALE:I mean, it was years before anything happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Got it? Yeah, i got it.
LEADMALE:Bring on the lie detector.
LEADMALE:I don't know, he's still mark's brother.
LEADFEMALE:Totally different kid, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Mark is obnoxious, he's rude, he's going nowhere, and he's too old for becky.
LEADFEMALE:On the other hand, david likes me.
LEADMALE:Where's the mustard? I took it back to rodbell's.
LEADFEMALE:What about the salami? I told you, dan, i took everything back.
LEADFEMALE:But the salami was ours.
SUPFEMALE:I panicked! Damn.
LEADFEMALE:I've been looking forward to that salami ever since dinner.
LEADMALE:Dad? you want to go shoot some hoops? you mean your dad? A quick game.
OTHERFEMALE:No big deal.
SUPMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:No time left on the clock.
LEADMALE:Your team's down by a point.
SUPMALE:Darlene, darlene, darlene, darlene! ooh! god! I'm shooting like a girl.
SUPFEMALE:You're just a little rusty.
LEADFEMALE:You'll get it back.
LEADMALE:Here, put it up.
LEADFEMALE:Try it again.
LEADMALE:Hey, girlie, girlie, girlie, girlie! girlie, girlie, girlie, girlie! Gee, i forgot how much fun it was to play with you.
LEADMALE:Come on, put it up.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:You know, dad, i really just want to talk.
SUPMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:What's up? Welli need a guy's opinion about something.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:, i'll be the guy.
LEADMALE:Let's say you were real good friends with this girl and you made a move on her and she turned you down.
LEADFEMALE:What would you do? Why, then i'd applaud her high moral standards.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's a dad opinion.
SUPFEMALE:I--i need a guy opinion.
LEADFEMALE:An honest one.
SUPFEMALE:Then i'd run and tell all my buddies i scored.
SUPFEMALE:I meant would you still be friends with her? Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe.
SUPMALE:Even if you were still attracted to her? Well, then i'd try again.
LEADMALE:So it would always be on your mind? so you couldn't just, like, hang out with her? this about you and david? Let's just say i'm curious and leave it at that.
LEADFEMALE:So? Well, listen, darlene what i would do or what mr.
OTHERFEMALE:X would do is, like, not the point.
SUPFEMALE:You're asking me what you should do, right? Yeah, i--i guess.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, let me put it this way.
LEADMALE:You have never in your life done anything just to please somebody else.
LEADMALE:Why start now? Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Play ball! Thanks, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Anytime.
LEADMALE:Thanks for what? She just came to the old man for some advice.
LEADMALE:Yeah? what did she talk to you about? david? It was steeped in the hypothetical, but she basically confirmed that he's warm for her form.
SUPMALE:Well, that's just great.
OTHERFEMALE:You knew she was going to start with boys again.
SUPFEMALE:Look at it this way.
SUPMALE:She didn't hide in her room or anything.
SUPFEMALE:She did exactly what you wanted her to do-she came to us.
LEADMALE:God.
LEADMALE:You just don't get it, do you, dan? when i said us, i meant me! Hello? Oh, hey, david.
LEADMALE:Hang on one second.
OTHERFEMALE:Uhdavid, darlene's in the shower.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'll tell her you called.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:She'll see you at school.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Why'd you have to say shower? Now he's picturing me naked.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, then i'm sure he won't be bothering you anymore.
SUPFEMALE:What am i going to say to him? I know he'll want to sit next to me in detention.
SUPMALE:You either go out with him or you don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and then if we do, like, everything changes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but it could be better.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, don't you want to kiss him? Uh-huh.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Yeah, really, o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? well, you having dreams about it? No! Well, yeah, but i woke up at the good part.
LEADFEMALE:You tried to quickly fall asleep to get back into it, right? But it wasn't the same.
SUPFEMALE:Suddenly everybody had big heads, and we were talking about spaghetti.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:If i were you, i'd go for it.
OTHERMALE:What if we break up? Then i lose the best friend i ever had.
OTHERMALE:Things have already changed, darlene.
OTHERMALE:You can't go back.
LEADFEMALE:He left it up to me.
SUPFEMALE:If i want, then i can decide that we'll just be friends.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Guys love that.
LEADMALE:D.j. ! let's go! I'll see you tonight, dad.
LEADMALE:You going to drive darlene? Nah, she walked.
OTHERMALE:She's got a lot to think about.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:She talk to you about david? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, me, too.
SUPMALE:Think she'll go out with him? I think she's gonna.
LEADMALE:It's great you guys are talking about this.
LEADMALE:I'm only good for guy stuff.
SUPFEMALE:I think she just needed the female viewpoint from someone who's older.
SUPFEMALE:This is really ticking me off.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you're jealous over this.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? It's very typical of me.
OTHERFEMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:You called, i rushed right over.
LEADMALE:What's so important? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking to dan right now.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
SUPMALE:, next time the kids have a problem, i'll send them directly to you.
LEADMALE:This is the problem i wanted, and you hogged it.
SUPFEMALE:Help.
SUPFEMALE:Help.
SUPMALE:I'm ready.
OTHERMALE:What took you so long? I'm supposed to wear this for gym today.
LEADMALE:I don't know how to put it on.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a problem.
SUPFEMALE:Want to field this one, honey? Get out of here.
LEADMALE:Come on, d.j. i can't believe you're still mad because darlene went to dan instead of you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she didn't just go to dan, you know.
LEADMALE:She went to becky, too.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:She went to her older sister for advice.
LEADFEMALE:Never worked for me.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
SUPMALE:Look, the important thing is that darlene got what she needed, right? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:, then.
LEADMALE:So, what do you need me for? Well o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:I took the stuff from the restaurant, right? Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:I know it was wrong, and i feel bad about it.
OTHERMALE:I can't stop thinking about it.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:So my question to you is what are the chances of beating a lie detector? you're actually going to lie? If i tell the truth, i'll get fired.
OTHERFEMALE:And if i lie, i got a shot.
SUPMALE:I sort of figured, being a cop and everything, maybe you'd know some tricks.
LEADMALE:There are no tricks.
LEADMALE:It's a machine.
OTHERMALE:I can beat it.
LEADFEMALE:The test measures blood pressure, heart rate, respiration.
LEADFEMALE:These are things that you can't control.
OTHERFEMALE:I think i can.
LEADFEMALE:The only ones that can beat a lie detector test are people that have no conscience at all.
LEADFEMALE:Psychos, schizos, pathological liars.
SUPFEMALE:I know i can.
LEADFEMALE:It's really hot in here.
LEADFEMALE:What if i get sweaty? will i get electrocuted? No, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:There is absolutely no danger.
LEADMALE:Well, how's this work, anyway? if those needles start jumping all over the place, then that's how you know i'm lying, right? Do you plan on lying, mrs.
LEADMALE:.
SUPFEMALE:Conner? No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's not on yet.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
SUPMALE:Now, just concern yourself with the questions and try to remain relaxed.
SUPFEMALE:Okey-doke.
SUPFEMALE:State your name, please.
SUPMALE:Roseanne conner.
SUPFEMALE:Your age? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Occupation? Waitress.
SUPFEMALE:Have you ever stolen any merchandise from rodbell's? Well yes or no, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:.
OTHERMALE:Conner.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i mean, can't you start off, like, smaller or maybe more specific? like, you know, going like, have i ever stolen a giant-screen tv? No.
SUPMALE:A hose from garden supply? No.
LEADMALE:A, uh, canoe-have you ever taken anything? well, hey, how about that pen you got there? I bet you took that from your work.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:And i'm working with it.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Have you ever taken anything? Yes or no, please.
LEADMALE:Yes, please.
SUPFEMALE:What have you taken? Uh ketchup, mustard pickle chips.
LEADMALE:What's going to happen to me? That's management's decision.
SUPMALE:I just ask the questions.
SUPFEMALE:Now, have you ever stolen any cash? Absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:How about your coworkers? bonnie? No.
LEADMALE:I was talking about leon carp.
LEADFEMALE:Leon? how come? Bonnie's the one that has the police record.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, have you ever seen mr.
LEADMALE:Carp take cash from the register? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:'cause he does the books.
SUPMALE:That's his job.
LEADFEMALE:Have you observed any changes in his normal routine? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you seen him exhibit any unusual behavior? Ohh i know what this is all about.
SUPFEMALE:You're trying to scrounge up some dirt on leon just because he's gay.
LEADFEMALE:I ought to call the a.
SUPFEMALE:C.
LEADFEMALE:L.
LEADFEMALE:U.
SUPMALE:Because this is totally un-american.
LEADMALE:I won't help you in your little witch hunt.
SUPFEMALE:No crappy job is worth that.
OTHERFEMALE:You did know he was gay, didn't you? No.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he's not.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:How's it going, you still got a job? what does it matter? I can't ever go back there again.
OTHERFEMALE:How come? Oh, 'cause i cracked.
LEADFEMALE:I turned myself in, and then i ratted out all my friends.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like you had a full day.
LEADFEMALE:Where's darlene? Last time i saw her, she was out shooting hoops.
LEADMALE:Well, i've decided that she's going to confide in me if i have to rip it out of her! dan! come here! Why didn't you return my calls? I was avoiding you.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:You want to go out with me, yes or no? Then we stop being friends, and it becomes something different.
LEADMALE:So your answer is no.
OTHERMALE:Now we're not friends anymore? No.
SUPFEMALE:Look, i was ready for this.
LEADMALE:I can't help liking you that way, but i'll deal with it.
LEADFEMALE:I'd rather be friends than nothing.
OTHERMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:So, i got a couple of bucks.
SUPFEMALE:We can go down to the arcade, and-what exactly did you tell her, dan? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I just listened and tried to be there for her, that's all.
LEADMALE:Brilliant! Captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
LEADMALE:Hey, bonnie.
SUPMALE:Hey, clyde.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Our paychecks came in.
OTHERMALE:What, are they paying us by the day now? They docked us for the food we took.
LEADMALE:Worth of stuff? We ought to do all our shopping here.
LEADFEMALE:Where's leon? I got to talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:They called him at the office.
OTHERMALE:They got a couple more questions to ask him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:That lie detector guy lied to me.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? When i told him leon was gay, he said they didn't care about that.
SUPMALE:Why'd you tell him that? I stuck up for him.
LEADMALE:You weren't sticking up for me, were you? No.
LEADFEMALE:I swear.
LEADMALE:Leon's a great big old pain in the butt, but i didn't want him to get fired.
LEADMALE:Absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne conner is not a danger to herself or the customers.
LEADFEMALE:To the best of your knowledge, is she on any medication? No.
OTHERFEMALE:But i think she should be.
LEADFEMALE:So you consider her a good employee? A "good" employee well, now, th-that's a poser.
SUPFEMALE:Yes or no, mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Carp.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K yes.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! I was afraid that would happen
LEADFEMALE:Man, look at her go.
LEADMALE:Is that baby going to be a porker or what? At least when her mouth's stuffed with food, she ain't barking at me.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, where's my pie? pregnant women have such a glow about them, don't they? It's just hormones, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's way beyond hormones.
SUPFEMALE:She's psycho.
OTHERFEMALE:She threw such a fit at lamaze class, we got detention.
LEADMALE:Roseanne! Coming, crystal, and so is your pie.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like some whipped cream on that? what does that mean, i'm eating too much? Come on, roseanne, you know what it's like eating for two.
SUPFEMALE:You do it all the time.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:No whipped cream.
LEADMALE:Way to hold back, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I hope that baby has a gigantic head.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i got good news.
LEADMALE:I got a promotion.
LEADMALE:So in three weeks, i'm afraid to say i will no longer be your boss.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADMALE:Get it over with.
SUPFEMALE:Dynamite! all right! Yeah, i knew you'd be happy for me.
LEADMALE:What'd they make you? I am director of human resources.
OTHERMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADMALE:So, what is that exactly? I have no idea, but i'm sure there's some literature in the desk.
SUPFEMALE:So, who's going to manage the restaurant? My guess would be a director of human resources wannabe.
LEADFEMALE:Well, leon, let me be the first to say that, that although we haven't always seen eye to eye, you have always been fair, ahem.
LEADMALE:What? D.j. , get the phone.
LEADFEMALE:If it's dean, say i'm not home.
SUPMALE:You're closer.
OTHERMALE:Get it! Give me $1.
LEADMALE:00.
LEADMALE:A quarter.
LEADFEMALE:A quarter? And i won't pound you.
OTHERFEMALE:Now go.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Hi, dean.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky said to tell you she's not here right now.
LEADFEMALE:That's what you get for a quarter.
SUPMALE:You're dead, you little rodent! Hi, dean.
LEADMALE:No, he didn't understand, dean.
SUPMALE:He's kind of slow.
SUPFEMALE:Saturday? Jeez, i'm going out with my friend dana, who, by the way, told me she thinks you're really cute.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Call her.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't mind.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, bye.
LEADMALE:Look, dana will be calling.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her i'm not home.
SUPMALE:Got it.
SUPMALE:So, how was your trip? In three days.
SUPFEMALE:First time i ever hauled livestock.
LEADMALE:Stunk like hell, but it's nice to have somebody to talk to.
SUPFEMALE:Looks like you're still avoiding dean.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:He seems like a nice enough guy.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe i'm shallow, but he gets these pit stains you wouldn't believe.
LEADMALE:Been there.
SUPFEMALE:Have you seen mark at all? Once.
SUPMALE:We ended up yelling at each other.
LEADMALE:It'll get better.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm lonely, i'm sad, like i'll never meet another guy i really care about.
SUPMALE:It's got to be the worst time in my entire life.
LEADMALE:No, becky.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, the worst time in your entire life will be when you're all those things and you smell like beef.
LEADFEMALE:Could you keep your paws of me for one minute? I was holding your hand.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm sick of it, so back off, o.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:? Oh, god.
SUPFEMALE:I miss having a boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:We walk to school together every single day, you're outside all of my classes, you put your arm around me you're my girlfriend.
LEADMALE:I liked it better before when you were david and i was darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Now we're this david-darlene creature, like we were fused together in some nuclear accident.
SUPFEMALE:So i won't put my arm around you.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what i mean.
LEADFEMALE:We don't need to be together every single moment.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:I'm going upstairs to read.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doing that alone.
LEADMALE:Can you handle it? Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:You can stay up there all day.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not following you.
LEADMALE:If you want me, you know where to find me.
SUPMALE:You must be happy leon's leaving.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm mean to him all the time then feel guilty.
SUPMALE:Now that he's leaving, at least i can stop punishing myself.
OTHERMALE:Well, thanks for waiting.
LEADMALE:Well, you left to go to crystal's for 10 minutes over an hour ago.
SUPFEMALE:She's driving me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:What was it this time? The thermostat.
LEADFEMALE:You just replaced that thermostat.
SUPMALE:Apparently, the house is still either too hot or too cold.
LEADFEMALE:Because she's pregnant and keeps on having hot and cold flashes.
SUPFEMALE:I suggested that, but she said no.
LEADFEMALE:Then she kicked me.
OTHERFEMALE:You're kidding.
SUPMALE:Then she started crying, and i couldn't kick her back.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when's grandpa coming home? Three days, at which time, she's his problem again.
LEADFEMALE:This gravy's cold.
LEADMALE:Give it to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll nuke it.
LEADFEMALE:Where's darlene? Oh, well her and david had a little tiff, so she's up in her room.
LEADFEMALE:What's he doing here? Well, i already invited him, and when she said it was either her or him, i flipped a coin until he won.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go, david.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:This is an incredible dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is really great.
LEADMALE:Then come back tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:We're having it again.
LEADMALE:You know what i was thinking? have they replaced leon yet? No.
LEADFEMALE:They're still looking.
LEADMALE:Why don't you try for that manager job? I couldn't get it.
LEADMALE:Why not? You help manage the shop.
LEADFEMALE:You run the house.
SUPFEMALE:Ask leon for a reference.
OTHERMALE:That could never happen, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I've have to suck up at the speed of light.
SUPMALE:I'm not getting it anymore.
LEADFEMALE:That's crystal.
OTHERFEMALE:I've talked to her i'm not home.
LEADMALE:If it's crystal, i'll talk to crystal.
OTHERMALE:If it's dean or dana, you're not home.
LEADMALE:Hello? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, just a second.
LEADFEMALE:David, it's your mom.
SUPFEMALE:Tell her i'm in the shower.
LEADMALE:Good morning, leon.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, what are you doing? We were slow, so i brought flowers to cheer the place up.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPMALE:You sound surprised.
SUPFEMALE:Well, forgive me, but usually when there's nothing to do, that's what you do.
SUPMALE:Well, i've decided not to do that anymore.
SUPFEMALE:It's sets a bad example for the staff.
OTHERFEMALE:I see.
SUPMALE:That's good.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:And i made the cook wash his hands.
LEADMALE:Well, i am impressed, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Morning.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, bonnie.
SUPFEMALE:Say, uh, this sudden spurt of efficiency, it wouldn't have anything to do with my old job being up for grabs, would it? why not? I could do it, although not nearly as good as you.
LEADMALE:Ooh, that last part had to hurt, huh? leon, could you give me a reference, please? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out of here.
SUPMALE:Let the whole place burn down.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:You're not giving her the same reference you gave me.
SUPFEMALE:You applied for that job without telling me about it? Wait a minute, o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:? Leon, i put in twice as many hours as her, and you know i work harder.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Come on, leon.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but it's not right that i get in the middle of this, since i don't care.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you trying to sink me with leon? I'm not.
LEADMALE:Look, roseanne, i could really use this job.
LEADMALE:I just want the people upstairs to know there's a difference between you and i.
LEADFEMALE:What difference? There's no difference.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i'm here full-time, you're here part-time, you take breaks anytime you want, you're always late, and you're mean to the customers.
LEADMALE:I am not mean! I'm crusty.
LEADMALE:Well, i take this job very seriously.
LEADMALE:You know, gruff, but lovable.
OTHERFEMALE:I work hard, and i think i'll be a great manager.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and i wouldn't? No.
SUPMALE:I think you'd end up getting a raise, and i'd cover for you like always.
LEADMALE:Why haven't you said anything before? You never wanted to be my boss before.
SUPFEMALE:Right, but now you're going to be my boss, and because i'm a lousy waitress, i suppose you'll fire me.
SUPFEMALE:I would not.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and you call yourself management material.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:I closed the shop down i'm here.
SUPFEMALE:What's the big emergency? The dryer's not working.
LEADMALE:Is it really not working, or she thinks it's not? No, this one's real.
LEADMALE:You check the circuit box? She wouldn't let me.
SUPFEMALE:She says whoever touches it will get electrocuted.
LEADFEMALE:So she called me.
OTHERFEMALE:Yup.
OTHERMALE:Where is she? Putting little ed down for his nap.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i can handle this before she comes back.
LEADFEMALE:Take me with you.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, lonnie.
LEADMALE:One more month, and you'll have your real mother back.
LEADMALE:God, i'm good.
LEADFEMALE:Lonnie, did you do your book report? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Don't take that tone with me.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do it again.
LEADFEMALE:Did you fix my dryer? Yes, i did.
LEADFEMALE:What took you so long? Little ed's taking his nap without his favorite shirt.
OTHERFEMALE:And you're certainly welcome.
SUPMALE:Got to go.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:Just like your father.
LEADMALE:Never around when i need help.
LEADFEMALE:That's not fair, crystal.
LEADMALE:I did close the shop to come here and throw a switch.
LEADFEMALE:I've done other things just to help out.
LEADMALE:I think i deserve better.
SUPFEMALE:Well, like what? what should i do, pay you? No.
LEADMALE:Maybe i should, since i've been a nuisance.
LEADMALE:I'll write you a check.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal, i really don't appreciate this.
LEADFEMALE:Will $50 make it easier to help a family member? O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:I know you're pregnant and everything, but you're way out of line here.
LEADFEMALE:I've been taking lots of crap-whoa! I think i'm in labor.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I didn't mean it.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't do it, dan.
LEADMALE:I've been having contractions all morning.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it was false labor, but this is it.
SUPMALE:It's a month early, crystal.
LEADMALE:You want me to hold it in, dan? Lonnie, showtime! I've got a bag packed in the closet.
LEADFEMALE:Lonnie, your mom's ready.
SUPMALE:Call becky.
LEADMALE:She'll bring you and little ed over to the hospital.
SUPMALE:Have her call mrs.
SUPFEMALE:.
LEADFEMALE:Conner at the mall.
LEADMALE:You o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, mom? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Take care of your brother, and i promise this is the last one.
LEADFEMALE:This better be a girl.
LEADFEMALE:If it's a boy, you'll love it just as much.
SUPMALE:The hell i will! What do we do now? Cleansing breath.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Doing good.
LEADFEMALE:You, too.
SUPFEMALE:How's it going? About four minutes apart.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Here's some ice chips.
SUPMALE:Baby seems fine.
SUPMALE:A little early, but in good shape.
LEADFEMALE:My first child was early.
LEADMALE:Actually, so was my second.
OTHERFEMALE:I probably should've mentioned that to someone.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's o.
SUPMALE:K.
SUPMALE:We can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, dan there's a video camera in my overnight bag.
LEADMALE:Ed wanted pictures of the birth.
OTHERMALE:If he doesn't get here, could you do it? He'll be here.
LEADMALE:But if he's not.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne will be here.
OTHERMALE:But if she's not.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to look, and you can't make me.
LEADMALE:Dad, i called home and there was no answer.
SUPMALE:I called the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:Mom already left.
SUPFEMALE:Bonnie's tracking her down.
LEADFEMALE:What about your grandfather? We left messages at the branch office in seattle.
OTHERFEMALE:Say, darlene, would you like to see a miracle through a camera? Gross.
SUPMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:Breathe! You breathe, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:I don't have to listen to you.
SUPFEMALE:It'll hurt less if you breathe.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, i hate your father.
SUPFEMALE:He did this to me, and should be here! he's the scum of the earth! You're right.
LEADMALE:He shouldn't miss this.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Take it from "scum of the earth.
OTHERMALE:" hello? Hi, bonnie.
LEADMALE:Are you calling to apologize? no? Well you're being very immature about this.
LEADMALE:You don't understand, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:She insulted me.
SUPFEMALE:She hurt me.
SUPMALE:I'm the one that's right, and when you're right, you can be as immature as you want to be.
LEADMALE:This isn't driving you crazy.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I like it.
LEADMALE:Well, i can't take it anymore.
LEADMALE:Get away from there.
LEADMALE:No! What if it's one of your kids that's calling? Then i really don't want to get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Ow! you pinched me! there! there! I know.
SUPFEMALE:Next time, i'll break your thumb.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Cool fight.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here, david? I'm looking for darlene.
LEADMALE:She's not home yet.
OTHERMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:What's for dinner? Sit down, david.
SUPMALE:Let's talk.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:You don't live here.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I hang around too much.
LEADFEMALE:Am i, like, driving everybody crazy? Well, actually, everybody thinks you're pretty cool, except for your girlfriend.
SUPMALE:It's that space thing, isn't it? You are really crowding her, david.
SUPMALE:You better back off.
LEADFEMALE:Give her time to think.
OTHERFEMALE:But what if while i'm giving her all this space, another guy moves in, and she likes him better? It's good that you find that out now.
LEADMALE:If she's that kind of girl, then she's not good enough for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, did you see the way i switched sides there? hello? Yeah, hi, bonnie.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not talking to her.
LEADFEMALE:Grow up.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? yeah? Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i will.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell her.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, thanks for calling.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:What did she say? well, crystal just had a baby girl, and we missed it because you're an idiot! She called me an idiot? Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Kids want to come in and say hi.
LEADFEMALE:In a minute, o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:? My little sister's in the nursery now.
LEADMALE:Is she o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? She's in an incubator to keep her warm, but she's great.
LEADMALE:You think she's pretty? She's beautiful you know, if you like bald chicks.
LEADMALE:Dan, thanks for hanging in there, and for doing all that stuff around my house, and for just putting up with me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm family, crystal.
SUPMALE:I was happy to do it.
OTHERFEMALE:But watching you push the baby out, for that, i got to charge you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh hi.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hey! Oh, crystal, i'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:What happened to you? Oh, never mind.
LEADFEMALE:It's a really long story, and i come off bad in it.
LEADMALE:So, how are you doing? Oh, i'm tired, and i'm happy.
LEADFEMALE:Since we couldn't get a hold of you, dan was the birth coach, and he was great.
LEADMALE:I couldn't have done it without you.
LEADFEMALE:You got your little baby girl.
LEADFEMALE:You're happy? I just know raising a daughter is going to be a wonderful experience of my life.
SUPFEMALE:She must have lost a lot of blood.
SUPMALE:Can i come in? Hi, honey.
OTHERMALE:Where's your baby brother? In the waiting room with d.j. i'd like a moment to apologize to my wonderful son for being so patient while i was a crazy lady.
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go make faces at the babies.
SUPMALE:Listen, she's feeling really guilty and vulnerable right now, so you can definitely get a moped out of this.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, way to go.
SUPFEMALE:Breathe, push, breathe, push-no big deal.
LEADMALE:But you always looked so cute in these scrubs.
SUPMALE:You guys ever think about having another one? what do you say, dan? It might be fun to have one on purpose.
SUPFEMALE:Am i interrupting? Yes, please.
LEADFEMALE:I had to close the restaurant.
SUPMALE:How's crystal? Everybody's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Lonnie's talking to crystal.
SUPFEMALE:Give them a couple minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, dan, let's go.
LEADMALE:Where are we going? Well, these two had a fight and now they're going to make up.
SUPMALE:What happened? You know your wife, how she could be a big baby sometimes.
SUPFEMALE:So, don't let that stop you from apologizing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i admit, maybe some things i said might have come out wrong.
LEADMALE:And? And that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Apology accepted.
LEADMALE:And? Well, i hate fighting with you, 'cause after jackie, and now that crystal's back to normal, you're like my third best friend, tied with nancy and anne marie.
LEADMALE:Apology accepted.
LEADMALE:So, did you get the job? No.
SUPMALE:Who did they give it to? Nobody.
LEADMALE:They're closing down the restaurant.
SUPFEMALE:What? Yeah, like in three weeks, they're going to turn the place into a bargain bin.
OTHERFEMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and it ain't like there's a whole lot out there for a couple of career gals like us.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's great.
OTHERMALE:You have to admit, making out's better after a couple days break.
SUPFEMALE:Definitely.
OTHERMALE:Our lips healed.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks again for the ride home from school.
LEADMALE:No problem.
OTHERMALE:Well, see ya.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, when your car isn't running, it's usually the starter.
OTHERFEMALE:I could fix it in five minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Nah.
LEADMALE:If you did, my dad wouldn't have a hobby.
LEADMALE:You want me to pick you up again tomorrow? Tomorrow's saturday.
LEADMALE:There's no school.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:You want to see a movie or something? Mark.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't have to be anything good.
LEADFEMALE:It could be something you like.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to date right now.
SUPMALE:It's been weeks, becky.
SUPMALE:I just like that we're talking.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, i don't have a lot more to say.
SUPFEMALE:I want to make sure that if we get back together, things will be different.
OTHERMALE:"if"? we may never get back together? I don't know, mark.
SUPMALE:I miss you, becky.
LEADMALE:I know, i know.

LEADFEMALE:Becky, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I said no, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:We're supposed to go out tonight.
SUPFEMALE:You've known about it for a week and you still haven't found a babysitter yet? Well, there's got to be some responsible teenage girls out there.
LEADFEMALE:Let me ask becky or darlene.
SUPMALE:Maybe they know somebody.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, i'll call back later.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Can't find anybody she trusts, huh? She might have to end up leaving them kids that's it.
LEADFEMALE:You're done.
LEADMALE:But i want to get out of the dungeon.
LEADFEMALE:Don't we all? Mom.
LEADMALE:You're not spending the rest of your life playing video games.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing else to do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure, there is.
SUPFEMALE:When your mom and i were your age, kids used to ride their bikes all over and build tree forts and dress up dogs in funny clothes, all kinds of stuff.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:I'll go outside if i have to.
LEADMALE:Dress up dogs? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Little white dog with the black eye.
OTHERMALE:That wasn't us.
LEADMALE:That was the little rascals.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i just remembered.
LEADMALE:I got to make sandwiches for dan's stupid poker game.
SUPMALE:Why are you doing it? I was going to clean out the fridge anyway.
SUPFEMALE:This way i save on trash bags.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong? Mark drove me home from school.
LEADFEMALE:But you're sad, though, so everything's good, right? will you cut it out? how does that make you feel, becky? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes when he looks at me, i still getting chills? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yuck.
SUPMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I thought you told him to date other girls.
SUPMALE:But he's not.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if he can't do that one simple little thing, i guess he doesn't care about you at all.
SUPMALE:And here's a picture of little angela at 3 weeks with her auntie roseanne holding her.
LEADMALE:She's so beautiful.
LEADMALE:Aw, look how cute i am.
OTHERMALE:Well, crystal, how does it feel having two babies at home now? Since i've been breast-feeding angela, i've been kind of worried about little ed.
SUPMALE:He seems real jealous.
LEADMALE:Why? He's old enough to be weaned.
OTHERFEMALE:I want him to grow up feeling secure and loved.
LEADFEMALE:Get over it.
SUPMALE:You'll go to one of his school plays or something.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, rosie.
OTHERMALE:Hey, calvin.
SUPMALE:Who's that? Customer from the shop.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Calvin, how's your bike running? Good.
SUPMALE:Just turned into a business meeting.
LEADMALE:I can write the whole thing off.
SUPFEMALE:Are you picking up the check? Just the stub.
LEADMALE:Hey, everybody, sorry i'm late.
LEADMALE:Where you been? I just got some bad news.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong? Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:Don't want to ruin everybody's fun.
LEADFEMALE:You already have, so just spill it.
LEADMALE:Chuckie lost his job.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Man, i thought he had seniority.
LEADMALE:He did.
SUPFEMALE:They didn't lay him off last week with the rest of his shift.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
SUPMALE:It's all over.
SUPFEMALE:Wellman plastics is history.
LEADMALE:Well, he'll find another job.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Now that wellman's is closed, there'll be plenty of jobs-bill collectors, repo men.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm really sorry, emory.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's happening all over.
LEADMALE:Bonnie's losing her job, you're losing yours, nobody in this town can afford to buy a bike from your husband.
SUPFEMALE:You're just the messenger of death, ain't you? Sorry.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:If we get depressed, we'll just drink ourselves stupid.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's settle up.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody chip in 6 bucks, except for emory.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to try to get the price down here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, willie, all our beers had flies in them.
LEADMALE:We were out of little umbrellas, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Works in your nicer places.
LEADFEMALE:I hate it when you're short on cash.
SUPMALE:You always try and cheap out of the tab.
SUPFEMALE:We all do what we have to to get by.
SUPFEMALE:Once i called the instant potato company and said i found a human hand in the box.
LEADFEMALE:The scary thing was, they didn't sound surprised.
SUPFEMALE:Well, don't worry.
SUPMALE:We're all going to make it.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have to learn to stretch those dollars.
LEADFEMALE:It can be done.
LEADFEMALE:I was watching this national geographic special on desert people.
SUPFEMALE:Bedouins can live for three days on one fig.
SUPMALE:That don't do me no good.
OTHERFEMALE:My family can't live for three days on one bedouin.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you guys it really happened.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, arnie.
LEADMALE:I swear.
OTHERMALE:Last night, i was visited by an alien.
SUPMALE:Your bet, chuckie.
SUPFEMALE:Half a buck.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in.
LEADMALE:I woke up next to this horrible, bug-eyed creature.
SUPMALE:I thought it was nancy at first, too.
LEADMALE:But does nancy stick needles into my body probing me for information? Well, you've only been married a few months.
LEADFEMALE:I'll play.
SUPMALE:The thing talked to me.
SUPFEMALE:It said it's here to find out about humans.
LEADFEMALE:A thousand million light years across the galaxy and it missed by one house.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call, chuckie.
OTHERMALE:What do you got? Oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:This is embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:I was just bluffing.
LEADMALE:I only got a pair of fives.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:Beats me.
OTHERMALE:Didn't see it coming.
OTHERMALE:All right! You guys stink.
LEADMALE:Hey, hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Read 'em and weep-eights.
LEADMALE:Two of 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Damn! Hey, chuckie, wasn't it your turn to bring some beer? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:It's out in the car.
LEADFEMALE:Take a hike.
SUPMALE:Let's buy the beer.
LEADFEMALE:He just got laid off.
LEADFEMALE:That's why we just lost to him, genius.
SUPMALE:I had three jacks.
OTHERMALE:I had a straight.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you tell me? We did, arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god, the aliens have messed up my mind.
LEADFEMALE:So last night wasn't their first visit? All right, brewskis.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Your deal, chuckie.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see if i can win some money back.
LEADMALE:I'll bet five bucks he can.
OTHERMALE:Ow! Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Was that your foot? Deal me out.
LEADFEMALE:He answers the phone? Not fair.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, calvin, what's doing? oh, man, how the hell did that happen? Do me a favor-sit on him.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right there.
LEADFEMALE:Mark got himself drunk down at the lobo.
LEADMALE:Is he old enough-no.
LEADFEMALE:I better get down there before he gets in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go.
LEADFEMALE:Want me to-and leave me here alone with mr.
LEADMALE:Lucky? Stay and have fun.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Don't tell becky or darlene where i went.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Ray, your bet.
SUPFEMALE:Pass.
SUPFEMALE:Same here.
SUPMALE:A quarter.
LEADFEMALE:And remember where you got it.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? After i called you, the kid put his fist through the jukebox.
LEADFEMALE:I talked willie out of calling the cops.
SUPMALE:Thanks, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hey, dan.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with you? Nothing.
LEADMALE:I hurt my hand is all.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:It's going to need a couple stitches.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:What about my jukebox? Willie, you'll just have to find another place to store your jim nabors records.
LEADMALE:That's very funny, dan.
LEADFEMALE:He'll pay for it.
OTHERFEMALE:He works for me.
OTHERMALE:Hey! I don't want you in here ever again.
LEADMALE:You understand me? huh? I'll explain it to him later.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get someone to look at that hand.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, don't tell becky.
SUPMALE:Easy.
OTHERFEMALE:'cause she'll kill me and never want to see me again.
LEADMALE:I won't tell her.
LEADFEMALE:Calvin, thanks for your help.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:I got you.
SUPFEMALE:I got you.
OTHERMALE:You're o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You're my man.
SUPFEMALE:My man dan.
LEADFEMALE:Dan the man.
LEADMALE:Dan, dan, the dan man.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:, now you do one with my name.
LEADFEMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:, how about this? Mark, mark, you puke in my truck and i'll kill you.
LEADMALE:Hey, how's it going? We let chuckie win 20 so he wasn't playing with his own money.
OTHERFEMALE:Then we played for real.
SUPMALE:He gave it all back in 1 1/2 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:Where is he? He's in the john.
LEADFEMALE:Do we let him win again? This is getting ridiculous.
LEADMALE:I've been laid off.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody let me win.
LEADFEMALE:It's enough we let you sit at the grownup table.
LEADMALE:How'd it go with mark? By the time i got there, he'd punched the jukebox.
LEADFEMALE:Any stitches? Two or three.
LEADMALE:Once i got hit with a beer bottle.
SUPMALE:Nearly lost an eye.
SUPMALE:Took 12 stitches.
SUPMALE:It's underneath the eyebrow.
OTHERMALE:You can't hardly see it.
SUPFEMALE:Art's new.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe he wants to hear it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure art knows you've been hit in the head.
SUPMALE:But did you know it was with a beer bottle? so where's mark now? Oh, i left him at his apartment drooling and mumbling my daughter's name.
OTHERMALE:Sounds like son-in-law material to me.
SUPFEMALE:We all been there.
LEADMALE:Becky's been giving him a real rough time.
SUPMALE:I feel bad for the kid.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's the pizza? what pizza? We came looking for you, and arnie said you went out for pizza.
LEADMALE:No, i said i was going to the shop.
SUPMALE:Sounded like pizza.
LEADMALE:You went to the shop? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:In the middle of your male bonding frenzy? Is everything o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:? Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:The alarm company called.
SUPFEMALE:The alarm went off at the shop.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Oh, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Just a short in the wiring.
LEADMALE:Hey, pizza sounds great.
LEADFEMALE:You guys up for pizza? Go on back upstairs, and i'll call you when it gets here.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:By the time he calls, all that'll be left is what's stuck to their shirts.
SUPMALE:Lying to the kids? Mmm mmm mmm mmm.
OTHERMALE:Hey, i promised mark.
OTHERMALE:And nobody says anything to roseanne, either.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, now he lies to his wife.
LEADMALE:Where will this end? You got to lie to your wife once in a while.
OTHERFEMALE:Like when they try out new recipes you hate it.
LEADMALE:I always tell my wife i got a cold and can't taste a thing.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, that's way better than hocking it up into a napkin.
LEADMALE:Dan's right.
OTHERFEMALE:You got to lie occasionally.
LEADMALE:If just once i'd said, "honey, i don't mind you're sleeping with my business partner," i'd still be married.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Bummer.
SUPFEMALE:They lie to us, too.
LEADMALE:Roseanne smashed up my truck and swore it happened while parked at the mall.
OTHERMALE:Did you call her on it? you kidding me? and waste all that guilt? When i mention how good my truck looked, i get chocolate cake for dessert.
OTHERFEMALE:If i squeeze out a couple of tears, cool whip.
SUPMALE:Hey, dan, you say the fire department checked but didn't find anything, right? It was a false alarm.
LEADMALE:Did they check the wires in the walls? Everything.
LEADMALE:How do they know it's the fire alarm? The burglar alarm sounds the same.
SUPMALE:Roseanne the fire department wouldn't know if anything was stolen.
OTHERMALE:They wouldn't notice a burglar unless the guy was on fire.
SUPMALE:I checked.
LEADMALE:Nothing's missing.
OTHERFEMALE:No flaming burglars.
SUPMALE:What about the safe? It's all there-your grandmother's ring, your good watch, the earrings you never wear because i never take you anyplace nice enough.
LEADMALE:All there.
SUPMALE:What about the gold card? what gold card? I knew it.
OTHERMALE:They stole the gold card! We don't have a gold card.
OTHERMALE:Not now.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? I got a gold card in the mail.
OTHERFEMALE:It has a $5,000 limit.
OTHERMALE:What fish-brained company gave us a gold card? Well, they asked for your annual income and your social security number.
LEADMALE:Maybe i switched them.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't see it.
LEADFEMALE:It's flat.
LEADMALE:It could've been up against the wall.
LEADMALE:It was in a great big white envelope.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'll look for it in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:How can we sleep if somebody's charging us into the poorhouse? They can't buy anything.
SUPMALE:It's 2 a.
LEADMALE:M.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's closed.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, here.
LEADFEMALE:But the burglar could charge tickets and fly to where something is open.
OTHERFEMALE:In some parts of the world, it's yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:We could be broke before it's now.
LEADMALE:How many beers did you have down at the lobo? Go check on that card.
LEADMALE:Honey i won't sleep till you get it.
SUPMALE:Neither will you.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:! I'll go down to the shop, find the card, and bring it back so you can sleep.
OTHERMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:? Thank you, honey.
OTHERMALE:Lie to me, will you? Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, mark.
LEADMALE:How's it going? please stop, will you? how's your hand? Hurts like hell, man.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see if we can keep it wet and dirty.
LEADMALE:Maybe we can get it infected.
LEADMALE:You didn't tell becky about anything, did you? No, i didn't.
LEADFEMALE:What about, you know, the other one? I didn't tell my wife for which i paid dearly, much as you will today.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I owe you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you do.
SUPMALE:I mean it.
SUPFEMALE:I really do care about becky.
SUPFEMALE:She's real good for me, you know? If she found out about last night, she'd never see me again.
LEADFEMALE:You saved my butt.
SUPFEMALE:You're a real friend.
LEADMALE:Let me correct a few points.
LEADMALE:I am becky's father, by definition, therefore, not your friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Secondly, i'm your boss, which still makes me not your friend.
LEADFEMALE:In my official capacity as not your friend, here's how it'll be-i ever catch you under the influence again, not only are you finished with becky, you're out of a job.
LEADFEMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
SUPMALE:One more thing--i paid for those stitches.
SUPMALE:I'll pay you back.
SUPMALE:Yes, but until then, i own them.
SUPMALE:I can rip them out anytime i want.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You bring me any ice cream? No.
SUPMALE:Then go away.
SUPMALE:I got gum.
LEADFEMALE:Becky's letting mark take her to the movies.
SUPFEMALE:When did this happen? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Does it even matter? You just know they're going to get back together, and that is just sickening.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe dan would even let him in the house after catching him down at the lobo like that.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? Oh, man! This is why dan is always ticked off at me.
SUPFEMALE:Spill it.
SUPFEMALE:One of the drivers i work with was there.
SUPFEMALE:He said mark got drunk and put his hand through the jukebox.
SUPFEMALE:Dan had to smooth everything over.
LEADMALE:So that's what's going on.
OTHERMALE:I knew i was busting dan's chops for something.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't know what.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? It was such an obvious lie.
LEADMALE:I mean, that alarm never went off.
SUPFEMALE:How do you know? Because i haven't paid the alarm company for three months.
LEADMALE:Just don't tell dan you heard it from me.
OTHERMALE:I won't even tell him that i know.
SUPFEMALE:We're leaving, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Be home early.
SUPMALE:We'll see.
LEADMALE:You're just going to let her go? what if he's been drinking? you're going to trust him? I don't trust him, but i trust dan.
SUPFEMALE:He loves becky, too.
LEADFEMALE:If he's letting her go, he must have some stupid reason.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Why, jackie, what a surprise! How was work, sweetheart? Pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:So you're totally letting him off the hook after lying to you? Oh, jackie, i wish i could.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan? yes? Becky and mark are dating again.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think of that? Well, we've just got to hope mark will turn over a new leaf.
LEADFEMALE:How'd he hurt his hand? He, uh, caught it down at the shop on a machine.
SUPMALE:Is it bad? Couple stitches.
LEADMALE:Well, he could sue us, dan.
LEADMALE:He won't sue us.
LEADFEMALE:What if the thing with becky turns sour again and he decides he hates us? We're insured.
OTHERMALE:Oh, really? where's the policy? At the shop.
OTHERMALE:Dan i just got here.
SUPMALE:I'm tired.
SUPFEMALE:I really, really, really want to know, dan.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:I'll go down to the shop in my beat-up truck.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that reminds me.
SUPMALE:I got to get some cool whip.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, mom wants you to pick up some cool whip.
SUPMALE:Why don't you do it? I'm doing my homework.
LEADFEMALE:That's a lame excuse, becky.
LEADMALE:Only from you, darlene.
SUPMALE:She left some money in her purse.
LEADMALE:I don't believe i have to get one thing just because mom forgot it when she went shopping.
SUPMALE:I'm so sick of running these little crappy errands.
LEADFEMALE:Someday i'll walk out that door and never come back and today's the day!
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:I got the milk you needed.
LEADFEMALE:What do i owe you? Forget it.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You bought me juice and bread yesterday.
SUPMALE:I may be losing my job, but i can still afford a carton of milk.
LEADMALE:What do i owe you? O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:, it's $1.
SUPFEMALE:40.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, let's see i'll give you the rest when i do the laundry.
LEADMALE:Wonderful.
OTHERFEMALE:So did you find something for mom for mother's day? No.
LEADMALE:Why don't we send her some perfume? She'll think we don't like the way she smells.
LEADMALE:I don't like the way she smells.
LEADMALE:How about flowers? why don't you just say her house stinks, too? how about candy? No! We gave her candy two years ago, remember? "thanks for the candy, girls.
SUPMALE:"i could have swallowed my filling, but luckily it stuck right in the caramel.
LEADFEMALE:" how about a crystal vase? Can't afford that.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what about if we break a glass and put it in a box marked "fragile"? No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i know! Let's get her something that makes her feel really young.
SUPFEMALE:What, like a wagon? You're not helping.
SUPMALE:Hey i think i found my mother's day present from the kids.
SUPMALE:You're going to open it? Oh, man, i should have opened it a week ago.
SUPMALE:Didn't they give you slippers last year? Yeah.
LEADMALE:These are them! I forgot to return them.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, these are ugly.
LEADFEMALE:Mom will love them! becky's teen town! If you're calling to chat about boys, press one now.
LEADMALE:Mother hi.
SUPMALE:Yeah? when? Oh, great! yes! O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, cool.
LEADMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Dana did it! she got the concert tickets for next saturday! awesome! We go to dana's, then pick everybody else up in the van.
SUPFEMALE:This is going to be great! Just understand that you and stacy won't be sitting with my friends.
LEADMALE:Becky, there's going to be 20,000 people there.
LEADMALE:Why would we sit next to the only four geeks? O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, we're going away for the weekend without an adult.
OTHERFEMALE:The big "r" will definitely have a problem with that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, not if we make it sound good.
LEADMALE:How? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Tell her we're never coming back.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:How was your day? would you like to know what your son did? Well, if he's "my" son, it must be something bad.
SUPMALE:I had to go to school to see his teacher because it seems he hasn't turned in any math homework for the past two weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:And how did he explain this? Well, he's had a lot of extra responsibility since you died.
LEADFEMALE:Did i suffer? No.
LEADMALE:Sniper clean shot.
LEADMALE:I said i was sorry! ever since he got that video game, he's been goofing off! Deej, you finish your homework first thing when you come home from school, you read me? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that it? oh, and you cannot lie to your teachers, you got it? O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
LEADMALE:No, it is not o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:You're not watching any tv this whole weekend, you understand that? And you're not playing video games till your teacher calls and tells me you're caught up.
LEADMALE:Dad! You heard your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Now take your homework upstairs and wash up for dinner.
SUPFEMALE:I hate you! Then my work here is done.
LEADFEMALE:What? Hey, thanks for your help there.
LEADMALE:What? I backed you up.
LEADMALE:Why am i always the bad guy? I told him to do his homework and to stop lying.
OTHERFEMALE:What else do you want from me? how about if you punish him once and end up where he doesn't like you? Give him time! He'll turn on me.
LEADFEMALE:He's a conner boy.
SUPFEMALE:Pretty soon we'll be slugging it out on the front lawn.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that doesn't do me any good now, does it, dan? We'll ask later.
OTHERMALE:Be quiet! You'll wake up mom.
OTHERFEMALE:So what? It's mother's day, you moron.
LEADMALE:Stop trying to tick her off.
LEADMALE:Go upstairs, hose off whatever stupid thing you made for her, and bring it down.
SUPMALE:Or what? Or we'll bury you under the porch with the rest of our brothers.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:I only had five eggs in my fridge.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how long have they been there? Uhwell i know i bought them on my way to work.
LEADMALE:I just don't remember which job.
SUPMALE:Who'd call this early? Well, get it before it wakes up mom! I got it.
SUPMALE:Hello? Oh, hi, mom.
LEADMALE:No, it's jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Happy mother's day.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's a shame you can't say the same to me.
LEADMALE:So, did you get the slippers? unique good or unique bad? should we ask dad about the concert? I don't think he'd go for it, either.
LEADMALE:Besides, she's still mad about d.j. we should just stick to our plan.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, don't you think that if i was dating somebody i'd tell you to get you off my back? Oh.
SUPMALE:Really.
LEADFEMALE:Well, go suck an egg.
SUPMALE:Huh? No.
LEADFEMALE:I did not! no! why would i say something like that? "suck an egg"? I don't even know what that means! No, i didn't say that.
LEADFEMALE:Must be a bad connection.
SUPMALE:So mom, happy mother's day.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell roseanne to give you a call when she gets up.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Bite me.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, i should have thought of that a long time ago! Here she comes.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her how great she looks.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's your father's way of telling me how much he loves me.
LEADFEMALE:You said you liked it.
LEADMALE:I love it! Because i know that you picked it out all by yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my, my, my.
LEADMALE:Let me feel-oh, boy! That feels fire-retardant.
OTHERFEMALE:It's way retardant.
OTHERFEMALE:It's-she hates it.
SUPMALE:Do something.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, mom.
LEADFEMALE:There's your coffee and juice.
LEADFEMALE:French toast is coming up.
SUPMALE:Did you actually make breakfast? Well, sure.
LEADMALE:It's mother's day.
SUPMALE:What's the catch? No catch.
LEADMALE:Can't we just do something nice? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:You never have.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Happy mother's day.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look! An ashtray with your picture at the bottom.
SUPFEMALE:It's a shame you quit smoking.
SUPFEMALE:You could grind your butts out on his face.
LEADMALE:Shut up! Well, i like it, d.j. i'll use it for a candy dish.
LEADMALE:You really, really love it? I love it, yes! And you're still not watching any tv.
SUPFEMALE:Gee! Here, mom.
LEADFEMALE:This is from me and darlene.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Oh, look at that.
SUPMALE:It's a gift certificate to the beauty box.
LEADMALE:"mother's day makeover-"manicure, pedicure, facial, complete hair styling.
OTHERFEMALE:" man! This must have cost a lot.
OTHERFEMALE:Which one of yous is pregnant? We just wanted to get you something you'd really like.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I've been kind of a nightmare this year.
SUPMALE:It's my way of saying thanks for putting up with me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that is so sweet! Thank you.
LEADMALE:That's so nice.
LEADFEMALE:Look, dan the girls got me a good gift.
LEADFEMALE:Way to go.
LEADMALE:And you know what would just make it perfect? We all go together.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:That's just for you.
LEADFEMALE:No, go with me.
LEADMALE:It would be great.
SUPFEMALE:But it's your day.
SUPMALE:And i want to spend it with my two girls.
LEADMALE:Really? Shoot! We only have enough money for you, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:I've got plenty of money.
OTHERFEMALE:How much did you pay for this robe? what's that? It's all scratchy.
LEADMALE:Eucalyptus and mango in an oatmeal base.
OTHERMALE:We're scrubbing away those layers of dead, dry skin.
LEADMALE:Well, rub it all over my body and don't stop till i'm a size 8.
LEADMALE:Oh, i think i overdid it today.
SUPFEMALE:The girls made me breakfast and took me out to lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Then i thought we should lose those calories, so we left the car at the restaurant and walked over to baskin-robbins.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like you had a great mother's day.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just great.
LEADFEMALE:Me and my girls hanging out together, acting crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, we went to this movie theater but we'd already seen the show, so we stood in front and told everybody the ending.
SUPMALE:Oh, it just doesn't get any better than that.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, it's time for your shampoo.
LEADMALE:Oh, do i really have to move? Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, all right.
SUPMALE:Boy, what we girls won't go through to be beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, mom.
SUPFEMALE:You betcha.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, this stuff is sucking my brain out right through my face.
LEADFEMALE:Just hang in.
SUPMALE:She better let us go to that concert.
LEADMALE:She will.
SUPFEMALE:Ask her now.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Wait till they've done her hair and she's got a buzz going from the spray.
SUPMALE:Oh, you were wide open, man! that was your shot! For 2 million bucks a year you'd think the guy could hire somebody to teach him how to shoot.
SUPFEMALE:No tv.
SUPMALE:I just came to show you my homework.
LEADFEMALE:Did you finish it? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Long division.
OTHERFEMALE:It's stupid.
SUPFEMALE:I'll never need it.
LEADMALE:I have a calculator.
LEADMALE:Now wait a minute, deej.
SUPMALE:What if your batteries go dead? I'll buy new ones.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:, say you're on a deserted island and there's no battery store and you got to split between 7 people? Dad it's your choice, deej-you can grow up to be gilligan or the professor.
LEADMALE:So what do i do now? It's a beautiful day outside.
LEADMALE:Go play.
LEADFEMALE:Can't i watch tv? No! O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:You want to come with me? Uh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Maybe after the game.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:Deej, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go do something.
LEADMALE:What about the game? what you want to do? Watch tv.
LEADFEMALE:No! come on, man! We're two guys on the loose.
LEADFEMALE:There's a whole big world out there! let's go wherever the wind blows us! Let me get my bowling shoes.
LEADFEMALE:End of the line.
LEADFEMALE:This was so cool, dad.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Didn't i tell you there was more things in the world than video games? Yeah.
SUPMALE:You can stop saying that.
SUPMALE:Here, give me your helmet.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to bash some stuff with my head.
SUPFEMALE:That's a $200 helmet.
LEADFEMALE:Take it off first.
SUPMALE:Here, give me a hand wiping all the mud off this beast.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Big day for you, deej.
LEADMALE:You learned how to shoot pool, you bowled your weight you found out you got to spit sideways when you're riding on a motorcycle.
SUPMALE:Sure beats tv, huh? A little.
OTHERFEMALE:So tell me about this alison girl who likes you.
OTHERMALE:I hate her! Sounds serious.
SUPMALE:No way! She's always bugging me, keeps trying to kiss me.
LEADMALE:Just like me when i was your age.
OTHERFEMALE:Girls were drawn to me like moths to a porch light.
LEADMALE:You got the conner curse, son.
LEADFEMALE:So what do i do? Nothing.
LEADMALE:It goes away.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:.
LEADMALE:Conner, what do you think? Oh, i'm beautiful! I no longer have to think.
LEADMALE:You look great, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Like our big sister just got back from college.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you guys look gorgeous, too.
LEADMALE:We'll have to go get a picture so we can remember this.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:We'll remember.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we should go over to woolworth's and try to smash all our hair into one photo booth.
OTHERMALE:There could be a romantic evening in your future.
LEADMALE:Dad will go crazy when he sees you.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? Look at me! I can do better than him.
OTHERMALE:Mom, when's the last time you spent some time alone with dad? Well, darlene, we really can't afford to go away.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but maybe you could spend a weekend at home and we could go away.
LEADMALE:D.j. could sleep at a friend's house and becky and i could take off for the weekend.
LEADMALE:Take off where? There's this concert in des moines coming up.
LEADFEMALE:You want to go to this concert for the whole weekend? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:You'd have the whole house to yourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Where would you stay? A motel room or something.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because.
LEADFEMALE:No! If you really care about me and dad having a weekend alone, take d.j. to grandma's.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure she'd be really happy to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on! No.
SUPMALE:You guys are way too young to go that long without an adult.
SUPMALE:This worked out great.
OTHERMALE:Tell me about it.
SUPFEMALE:What does that mean, "worked out"? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this whole thing was just some scam so you could go to some stupid concert, right? Damn it.
LEADMALE:Mom i'll pay the bill.
LEADFEMALE:Meet me in the car.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, keep stirring it, deej.
LEADMALE:My arm is tired.
LEADMALE:Well, if you don't keep stirring, it won't be chili.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even like chili.
LEADMALE:You like science, don't you? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Chili is science.
LEADMALE:How? It's chemistry.
SUPFEMALE:Chili represents your three states of matter-solid, liquid, and eventually gas.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god-it's the shirelles.
LEADMALE:Who? Disco.
SUPMALE:You guys have a good time? Just swell.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go wash this crap off my face.
SUPFEMALE:See, deej, the good-looking ones always have an attitude.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Ooh! Flashback-prom night, 1969.
LEADFEMALE:And honey, even after all these years, you hair is still just as wide.
SUPMALE:Don't touch it, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You'll dent it.
LEADFEMALE:I did my homework.
SUPFEMALE:You did? Oh, you sure can be a good kid sometimes.
SUPMALE:Is something wrong, roseanne? No.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's fine.
LEADMALE:Deej, i want to talk to your mom for a minute.
SUPMALE:Go bug your sisters.
SUPMALE:Use real bugs.
SUPFEMALE:Becky and darlene are in a mood.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Ohh quality time's for saps.
LEADFEMALE:That whole thing was just a set-up.
LEADMALE:They were just trying to get something out of me.
OTHERMALE:Why'd they have to do that today? Oh, my god-happy halloween.
LEADMALE:What are you complaining about? You look better.
OTHERFEMALE:Great plan, becky.
SUPMALE:Me? You're the one who blew it.
SUPMALE:I didn't think she could hear.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? She can hear us right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Still, we spent the whole day together and she treats us like we're infants.
LEADMALE:Come on out of there.
LEADMALE:As soon as we wipe off these clown faces.
LEADFEMALE:Now! Yeah? First of all, you going away for a weekend to a rock concert without an adult-that was never going to happen no matter how you sucked up.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's unanimous.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that about wraps it up.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:, we'll apologize to her before she, like, explodes.
LEADMALE:She's not going to like, explode.
LEADFEMALE:She's too busy crying her eyes out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one you got to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:I'm very angry and i don't like you right now.
SUPMALE:So we should also apologize to you? Shut up.
SUPFEMALE:So i don't have to say it again, you shut up, too.
OTHERMALE:You guys just don't get it.
SUPMALE:You see, she thought you were actually going to do something nice for her you know, like you cared.
LEADFEMALE:That would have been the very best thing you could have done for her today, but you just ruined it.
OTHERMALE:Well, what should we do? Make it up to her.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:We'll think of something.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You had your chance.
LEADFEMALE:Now it's my turn.
LEADFEMALE:Stop.
LEADMALE:We're going out to dinner.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to eat with those girls.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:They're not coming.
SUPFEMALE:I'm punishing them.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, and having to eat my chili is just the beginning.
SUPFEMALE:We'll decide the rest over dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get changed.
LEADMALE:But they hate me, right? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:That's the beauty part-they hate me.
LEADMALE:Oh, dan, that's just great! Happy mother's day.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, this is so much better than some old robe! Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, bev.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie? The kids got to your mother's.
LEADFEMALE:They're fine.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, you're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:They wanted to come.
LEADMALE:They're old enough to take a weekend trip by themselves.
LEADMALE:What's that noise? oh, what a treat for the girls to meet your garden club! Does anyone there play the piano? Great.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene loves to sing show tunes.
SUPFEMALE:No, she's just being modest.
LEADFEMALE:Make her.
LEADFEMALE:Did you get your projector fixed? Grand.
SUPMALE:What's a weekend at grandma's without all those wonderful vacation slides? No, no.
LEADMALE:We're just going to have a little romantic weekend at home.
LEADFEMALE:All righty! Well, you enjoy your grandchildren.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Bite me.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:I'd do the dishes, but this nasty hangnail will smart in that soapy water.
LEADMALE:Well, save your lame excuses, dan.
LEADMALE:Don't make offers that you don't intend keeping.
SUPFEMALE:Fair enough.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just take care of it, like i do with every other thing around here.
SUPMALE:Darlene, get down here and do the dishes! I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Oh, hi, dougie.
SUPMALE:How's our favorite banker? what's he doing, calling here? I asked him to.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:How's lois? why'd you do that for? We're late on the shop's loan payment.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:I got a plan.
OTHERMALE:How are the kids? what's the plan? oh, really? Oh, gosh, dougie, that is just so precious.
LEADFEMALE:I've always said your little girl was a genius.
LEADFEMALE:You guys have to come over again for dinner soon.
SUPMALE:We would love that.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Hold on a minute and i'll get dan for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Which one's the genius? The little one.
OTHERFEMALE:Katy.
LEADMALE:The one who made boom-boom in our sink.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, dougie, how ya doin', man? Listen, thanks for calling back.
LEADMALE:Listen, i gotta keep this on a friend level.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna need a couple more weeks on that loan payment.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm mike summers, your state representative.
LEADMALE:How are you doing? Great.
OTHERMALE:I'm going door-to-door, why don't you just go down to the unemployment office and see everybody at once? I hear you, and you're right.
SUPFEMALE:We can't let this area's work force lay idle.
SUPFEMALE:That's why bringing in new business is my number one priority.
LEADFEMALE:How? Through tax incentives.
LEADMALE:We'll make it cheaper for businesses to move right here in lanford.
LEADFEMALE:So they get a tax break? That's why they come here.
SUPMALE:Who's paying the taxes that they ain't paying? Well, yo-you will.
LEADFEMALE:But you'll be working.
LEADFEMALE:Good, steady employment.
OTHERFEMALE:Union wages? Part of the reason these companies find it so expensive to operate in other locations-so they dump the unions to move here and hire us at scab wages, and for that privilege, we get to pay their taxes.
LEADMALE:Is your husband home? He's on the phone, trying to keep us from losing our house.
LEADMALE:Hey, let's talk about that.
OTHERMALE:See, we're broke.
SUPFEMALE:I can't even afford to buy groceries unless it's double coupon day.
LEADFEMALE:You know, we should talk about that, but i have several houses to get to before i quit-well, hey, great.
SUPMALE:I'll come with you.
OTHERMALE:Boy, it's getting rough out here, mike.
SUPFEMALE:It's getting so my son's gonna have to wear my daughter's hand-me-downs, and for real this time.
LEADFEMALE:Not just for fun.
LEADMALE:Last day at the ol' mall, huh? I don't even wanna go in.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Treat it like any other day.
OTHERMALE:I checked at the buy 'n bag.
SUPFEMALE:They don't have any openings.
LEADMALE:Thanks anyway.
LEADMALE:See ya.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADMALE:The lunch lady at school's been sick.
SUPMALE:I think she's going to die soon.
LEADMALE:Are you interested? Well, gee.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see serving crappy food to ungrateful teenagers.
OTHERFEMALE:How would i know i was at work? Here.
LEADFEMALE:It's a letter from my school.
LEADFEMALE:I was supposed to give it to you a couple days ago, but i forgot.
SUPMALE:Like the time you "forgot" that hamsters can't swim? No, this time i really forgot.
SUPFEMALE:"dear mr.
LEADFEMALE:And mrs.
SUPMALE:.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, "i'm sure you're as proud as we are "of your son's significant achievement "in winning the james madison elementary school spelling bee.
SUPMALE:" my god, it's a good note.
LEADMALE:You're sure there ain't a page missing? No, he's in the regional finals.
SUPMALE:That's the whole note.
LEADMALE:No one was hurt.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , i always knew you had some special hidden talent.
LEADMALE:And now, you can spell.
LEADFEMALE:You can spell! Yeah, and that's where the big money is.
LEADFEMALE:You're just jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to be rain man.
SUPFEMALE:So, deej, why didn't you say something before? I didn't think it was such a big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? The whole family's coming to cheer you on to victory.
LEADMALE:Even darlene? The entire family.
LEADMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, darlene! they're making you come! ha ha! So leon is actually going out of his way to find you something else in the store? That's nice of him.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you think you know somebody.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:Hi, nancy.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:You look upset.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I been up all night throwing stuff at arnie.
LEADMALE:Jeez.
LEADFEMALE:What happened now? Well, i told him he has to get it together and stop being such an irresponsible slob.
OTHERMALE:And of course he took that the wrong way.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that is just so typical.
LEADMALE:Jackie, what would you do? what are you asking me for? Well, you had a relationship with him.
LEADMALE:Ohnancy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm eating.
LEADMALE:Man well, nancy, you know he's never gonna change.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been telling you that the whole time.
LEADMALE:I'm so sick of hearing him whine about how i'm smothering him.
LEADMALE:Well, if you can still hear him whining, you ain't pushing hard enough on the pillow.
LEADMALE:I hope leon found us something.
SUPMALE:Of course he did.
LEADMALE:That's what i like about you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're always half full.
LEADFEMALE:So did you get us another job and what is it? Well, i spoke to everyone-now look, tuesday's gonna be a problem.
LEADFEMALE:If they want me to start tuesday, i can't start till noon.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's not a problem, since no one in the store is hiring.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:There's gotta be something.
LEADFEMALE:I did everything i could.
LEADMALE:You'd waited on too many of the department heads.
SUPFEMALE:Damn.
SUPMALE:Well, at least you tried.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Thanks anyway.
LEADMALE:I'm really sorry, ladies, but you know, so the day isn't a total waste let's blow this joint in style.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Sparkling cider.
SUPMALE:Well, at least you spared no expense.
LEADMALE:It's just a token of my esteem.
SUPFEMALE:Not the actual esteem.
LEADFEMALE:You know, leon, that was really sweet of you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, so nice it almost makes me feel guilty for all the crap we pulled behind your back.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Remember when i told you my aunt helen died and i had to go to vegas? she didn't die and there was no funeral? There was, but i didn't go, 'cause i was in vegas.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I remember that.
LEADMALE:That was right about the time that rodbell's said you no longer had to wear these quaint little humpty-dumpty uniforms you hate so much.
SUPFEMALE:You never told us that.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't? Ohbut you know what's important is that you know now.
LEADMALE:Leon, that was really low.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you've finally earned our respect.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, here's to the last day.
LEADFEMALE:We're not out in the parking lot watching the place burn, but this is nice, too.
OTHERMALE:To rodbell's luncheonette.
OTHERMALE:Where the food speaks for itself.
LEADMALE:All night long.
LEADMALE:Nancy's driving me crazy, dan.
SUPFEMALE:All couples argue, arnie.
SUPFEMALE:It's different.
SUPFEMALE:When we dated, we only argued about who drives and who moons.
LEADMALE:That's bull.
LEADMALE:You two used to fight all the time.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but it used to be like foreplay.
LEADFEMALE:Got us hot.
LEADFEMALE:Now she's breaking plates over my head.
SUPFEMALE:It's a real turnoff.
SUPMALE:You guys ever thought about going to a counselor? We're a little old for camp.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, rosey.
LEADFEMALE:How's your last day at the shop? Horrible.
LEADFEMALE:Leon can't find me no other job, and i didn't have any customers to take it out on.
LEADMALE:But i did talk to nancy and you're wrong.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Now that rosey and i have discussed it, we can't put you up tonight, arnie.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what about your garage? We just cleaned it.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Know what i'll do? I'll be a man about this.
SUPMALE:It's my place, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'll sleep in my own damn garage.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what happened to that big tricked-out harley you had sitting up here? Well, i kind of sold it.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you tell me? The pressure's off.
LEADMALE:We can breathe.
SUPMALE:Don't get too excited.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't make a big profit.
LEADMALE:What does not big mean? About 100 bucks less than i spent on it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan.
LEADMALE:I had to, honey.
LEADMALE:We needed the money to get into summer.
LEADMALE:He wouldn't go any higher.
LEADFEMALE:Man, i know how hard you worked on that thing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't worry, baby.
LEADMALE:We'll screw over the next guy good.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I know that was your favorite bike.
LEADMALE:Well, remember our family motto-we're conners.
LEADMALE:We gotta eat.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going back there and get me some coffee.
SUPFEMALE:Want some? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Can i help you? Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm mike summers, your state representative.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? I'm meeting with small businessmen in the area hey.
LEADMALE:Oh, hell! mike! wait up! You think d.j. 's nervous about the spelling bee tonight? He seems fine to me.
LEADMALE:Being in the spotlight, it can be really traumatic for a kid.
LEADMALE:Like the time you were doing them baton tosses in front of the whole school and you killed that bird? If it'd just died right away, but it just kept flopping around rosey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, nance.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:He left me.
LEADMALE:Do you believe this? He left me.
LEADMALE:You're kidding.
LEADMALE:Read this.
LEADFEMALE:"dear nancy, i know this is hard to believe, "but i am being kidnapped by what's that word? Aliens.
LEADFEMALE:Aliens from outer space.
SUPMALE:He is such a worm.
LEADMALE:He couldn't even face me.
LEADMALE:Instead he leaves me some stupid note about space creatures sent here to take back intelligent life.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, are their bosses gonna be ticked.
SUPFEMALE:Did you have another fight? Huge, but he didn't have to do this.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? "dear nancy" who are the allens, and why are they out of spice? Aliens, dan, from outer space.
LEADMALE:Oh, that makes a little more sense.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, did he tell you anything? is there another woman? No offense, nancy, but it's a miracle there's one.
SUPFEMALE:Why would he do something like this? why does this surprise you? remember the first time he was supposed to meet your family and came down with lou gehrig's disease? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Turned out to be the 24-hour kind.
OTHERFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's it.
LEADMALE:I'm finished with him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm putting everything he owns into a shoe box and throwing it out onto the sidewalk.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i don't need him.
OTHERMALE:I don't need anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, will you come with me? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Man.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:There you go.
SUPMALE:I told you they wouldn't make it a year.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , come on down here.
LEADMALE:He's almost ready.
OTHERMALE:He's doing his hair.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that can't be good.
LEADMALE:I got to ask a couple questions for my college applications.
LEADMALE:Shoot.
LEADMALE:What's our annual income? Um, that's the amount of money we make in a year.
OTHERFEMALE:Next question.
LEADMALE:No, they need to know.
LEADFEMALE:"0-20,000, i guess you could put us down for, say31.
OTHERMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And we only spend, say35.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, you still made too much for me to get full financial aid.
LEADFEMALE:How much is in my college fund? Boy, this is embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:Please tell me there's a college fund.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there was, but so even if i get into these schools, i can't afford to go? Becky, it has been a really bad year.
LEADMALE:Ii can't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:Let's wait and see.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you'll get an academic scholarship.
LEADMALE:Big maybe, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Big, big maybe.
OTHERMALE:The shop could still take off.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you could go to community college for a couple years.
LEADFEMALE:What was the point of getting as? Becky.
LEADMALE:You told me if i worked hard, i could make something out of myself.
OTHERFEMALE:You can.
LEADMALE:Going to night school? I'll wind up just like you! Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey! You apologize for that.
LEADFEMALE:No! Your mother busted her butt for you.
SUPMALE:I busted my butt to get into a good school.
LEADFEMALE:There was no way.
LEADFEMALE:We purposefully went broke so you couldn't go to the college of your choice.
LEADMALE:I was on my own.
SUPFEMALE:You've never been on your own.
OTHERMALE:What would you call it? I'm ready.
LEADMALE:What did you do? I think it looks good.
LEADMALE:Well, you are wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Mom! All the other parents will make fun of us.
LEADMALE:You go wash that out of your hair now.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Are you ready to go? I'm not going to some stupid spelling bee.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, you are.
SUPFEMALE:Your brother's been to plenty of your stupid things.
SUPFEMALE:Go get yourself ready.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you let her talk to you like that.
SUPFEMALE:The fact that she doesn't want to end up like me just proves that she's been paying attention around here.
LEADMALE:She's still way out of line.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we may not have exactly been able to spoil her, but she's still had it pretty good.
SUPMALE:As good as we wanted her to? did you tell d.j. to wash his hair? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You should have told him to take his blazer off first.
OTHERMALE:Why does he do that? Your word is "embarrass.
LEADMALE:" "embarrass.
LEADFEMALE:" e-m-b-a-r a-s-s.
LEADFEMALE:"embarrass.
LEADMALE:" i'm sorry, roger.
SUPFEMALE:There are two rs, but you don't need to be embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:You did very well.
LEADFEMALE:Whenever you do your best, you're never a loser.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he is.
SUPMALE:Spell "good night," roger.

LEADFEMALE:There's only strawberry left.
SUPFEMALE:I knew this would happen.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:You can have my chocolate.
SUPMALE:I'll eat the strawberry.
SUPMALE:Don't say i never gave you nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I was thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Forget college.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe i'll just marry mark and move in with you guys.
LEADFEMALE:If you're trying to kill us for the insurance money, don't bother, 'cause there ain't any.

SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, remember the poker game's here tonight.
LEADMALE:Why can't you have it at chuckie's house? It's my turn.
OTHERMALE:What's this? Dan, we shouldn't have let d.j. have that chemistry set.
SUPFEMALE:What have you got to say for yourself? can i have a dog? We're not keeping it.
SUPFEMALE:That thing is disgusting.

SUPFEMALE:Did he follow you home from school or something? No.
LEADFEMALE:I traded kenny my comic books for him.
LEADMALE:Does kenny's mom know he traded his dog? She gave me the dog food.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm sorry, d.j. , but you're going to have to take him back, honey.
LEADMALE:Why? Because it's a big responsibility, d.j. your sisters aren't going to help you.
SUPMALE:Me and daddy are busy, and last time your dad made that rule.
LEADFEMALE:No more pets.
SUPMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Aroo! Dan, would you like to explain your no more pets rule or keep kissing the dog? Your mom's right.
LEADMALE:Kenny's mom has to pick up the dog.
SUPFEMALE:Take him outside.
SUPFEMALE:It's not fair.
LEADFEMALE:He is cute.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, you just fall in love with anything that licks your nose.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:It was the way you kicked your leg when i scratched your tummy.
SUPMALE:Hello, lorraine, it's roseanne conner.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, your dog's here.
LEADMALE:No, i don't blame you at all.

LEADFEMALE:I need to call jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm kind of worried about her 'cause she called here last night all freaked out from the lobo lounge.
SUPFEMALE:She ran into gary and his brand-new fiancee.
LEADMALE:Gary's getting married? Yeah.
LEADMALE:She was drunk, so i called her a cab to get her home.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, sis.
LEADFEMALE:Answer the damn phone.

SUPMALE:You'll have to drive me home.

SUPFEMALE:Still no luck, huh? No.
SUPMALE:She doesn't even have her answering machine on.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this is so like her.
SUPMALE:She gets upset and goes into hiding.
OTHERMALE:I'm the same way, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:When i'm feeling down, i don't want to see anyone i don't want a talk to anyone.
SUPFEMALE:Well, see now that's where we differ.
SUPFEMALE:When i'm in a bad mood, i can't wait to spread it around.
LEADMALE:Hey, leon.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, wife.
SUPMALE:Hello, friend of wife.
SUPMALE:Hey, danny.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here? I thought we'd go catch a movie.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah? Cool.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Well, i'll go get my coat.
LEADMALE:What happened to your poker game? Davey canceled, and we're a guy short.
LEADMALE:Besides, i'd rather be with my baby.
OTHERMALE:If you need another player, i love poker.
OTHERMALE:Baby, the game's back on.
SUPMALE:What happened to being with my baby? We can go to the movies any time.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but we don't.
SUPMALE:We could.
LEADMALE:Don't expect me to sit there watching you play poker.
SUPMALE:Bonnie, want to go to the movies or something? Sure.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I'll get jackie and see who else wants to go.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:So, don't expect me to make any stupid sandwiches for your poker game.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, leon, house rules-the new guy brings the sandwiches.
SUPMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:We're in a restaurant.
SUPMALE:Roseanne-no.
LEADMALE:Bonnie-no way.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just pick up a pizza on the way over.
LEADMALE:I don't want leon in my house, dan.
LEADMALE:Why not? Because he's my boss.
LEADMALE:Bosses aren't supposed to be in your house.
OTHERFEMALE:It's wrong.
LEADMALE:Don't you see? He's only going to be here a couple of hours, lose a lot of money then leave.
LEADMALE:Don't let him look in the refrigerator.
LEADFEMALE:He'll see everything i swiped from the restaurant.
LEADMALE:Mom, the dog ate my slippers, destroyed my brand-new sweater, and now look what he's using as his chew toy.
LEADMALE:I hope he bought you dinner first.
OTHERFEMALE:Just get rid of him, please.
LEADMALE:I'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:Did you call lorraine? I'm calling.
LEADMALE:It's my fourth time today.
LEADMALE:Hi, lorraine.
LEADFEMALE:It's roseanne.
SUPMALE:When are you going to come and get this dog? Oh, a kitchen fire.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Well, call me up later, then.
LEADFEMALE:A kitchen fire? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't believe the day lorraine's had.
SUPFEMALE:First her car breaks down and now a kitchen fire.
LEADFEMALE:Man, the way her luck is going, i wouldn't be surprised if some irate mother of three jams a skanky dog down her throat.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Is roseanne ready? Oh, she's getting changed.
LEADMALE:She told me about gary.
LEADMALE:I'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, jeez, dan, no.
LEADMALE:I broke up with him months ago.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i dumped the guy, so, if he's seeing somebody else, that's his business.
SUPFEMALE:I wish him all the luck in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any vodka? The place is ours.
OTHERMALE:Let's eat.
LEADFEMALE:This is great! Apple pie.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, i could lose my job if anybody found out i let you in here.
LEADMALE:Gordon, if you get fired, it'll be because of those parties you have in the mattress department.
SUPMALE:Ooh, gordon! Since the guys have their game, every week, how about we do this every week? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Girls night out.
OTHERFEMALE:We could go bowling.
LEADFEMALE:We could play bingo.
LEADFEMALE:Awesome.
OTHERMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, that's just great.
LEADMALE:No, it ain't.
SUPMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, you're sucking the fun out of this party.
LEADMALE:I'm having fun.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:You're sitting there like a great big lump of death.
SUPFEMALE:I'm having a good time.
OTHERFEMALE:So, you're upset about gary.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm fine about gary.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, then? I can't-it's personal.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you later.
LEADMALE:Jackie, these are my closest friends.
OTHERMALE:Whatever you tell me in confidence i'll eventually tell them anyway.
LEADMALE:Thanks, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's just how i feel.
LEADFEMALE:I say if we can't share our feelings with one another, we might as well be men.
LEADMALE:Hear, hear! No, i can't.
LEADMALE:Oh, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to tell us.
LEADMALE:If you want to, we're here for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I do need to talk about it.
OTHERMALE:I guess.
LEADMALE:Have you ever done something that you're really ashamed of? No.
LEADFEMALE:Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, i have.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, well well, ok.
SUPMALE:Wh-when i was a senior in high school, i voted for myself for homecoming queen.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you were going to tell that story about when you wanted to look really popular, so you gave yourself a hickey with the vacuum cleaner.
LEADMALE:Oh, roseanne.
SUPMALE:I--i would have never told that story, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Oh, whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:How about this? The first time i did it with chuck, i told him i wasn't a virgin, but i really was.
OTHERMALE:Why would you lie about something like that? I didn't want him strutting around like he was christopher columbus.
OTHERMALE:Oh, like they do.
SUPMALE:That's what they do.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, they do.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Uh, this one time, i, uh, wrote this bad check to the, uh, jerry lewis telethon, um, just so i could hear him say my name on television.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, roseanne, you didn't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Oh, jackie, ok, well, i think i got something a little more on the lines of, um, what you'd call shame.
LEADFEMALE:Back when duke and i were drinking, we kind of like were short on cash, so, uh, we robbed a liquor store.
SUPMALE:Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i--i guess you really were desperate.
LEADMALE:Oh, for god's sake, people rob liquor stores all the time.
OTHERFEMALE:I slept with arnie.
OTHERMALE:Aah! aah! What? Oh, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:You slept with arnie? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:It's out in the open.
LEADFEMALE:So, where's all the supportive stuff? what the hell were you thinking? I was thinking that i just lost a great guy like gary, and now he's gone, and i'll never find another great guy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 36 years old, i've got flabby arm and pelican neck, all my house planets are dead and no one loves me, but what difference does that make? Everything in my life sucks.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, that's still no excuse.
LEADMALE:Uh--i oh-oh, i--i i was drunk, i i made a mistake.
OTHERMALE:A mistake? A mistake.
SUPMALE:Jackie! Do i have to remind you that when we were in high school we all took a blood oath that this man would never be given the chance to breed? Come on.
OTHERMALE:Come on, guys.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were going to be there for me.
SUPFEMALE:Well give us a minute.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize when everybody in this town sees me, they're going to say, "there goes the sister of the woman who slept with arnie.
LEADMALE:" people forget, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Don't beat yourself up over this.
LEADMALE:You couldn't have seen this coming and last card down and dirty.
LEADFEMALE:Speaking of down and dirty, you guys want to hear what happened last night? No.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Anybody want another beer? Me.
SUPFEMALE:Your bet.
LEADFEMALE:Quarter.
LEADMALE:It's really incredible.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe what happened.
SUPFEMALE:Last night.
LEADFEMALE:To me.
LEADFEMALE:Quarter to you, arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, well, well.
LEADMALE:A gallon of mayo, a gallon of pickle chips, and, yes, it looks like a tub of rodbell's famous cole slaw.
LEADFEMALE:Just like my refrigerator at home.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, i'll tell you, guys.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you.
SUPFEMALE:Last night, this really gorgeous chick came on to me.
LEADFEMALE:What was she this time, arnie? a model, a movie star? No.
LEADMALE:This time she was real.
LEADMALE:You mean that thing with you and kathleen turner on the monkey bars never really happened? I'm not kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Of course not.
OTHERMALE:Listen, dan, i'm new here.
OTHERFEMALE:Should i treat him like an idiot, too? We don't stand on ceremony, but it is considered polite.
SUPMALE:Doesn't anyone want to hear? Cut it out, arnie.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, like you'd cheat on nancy.
LEADFEMALE:I did.
SUPFEMALE:You're not kidding.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:What is the matter with you? You just got nancy back.
OTHERMALE:Well, this woman wanted me and you guys know that never happens.
LEADMALE:Arnie, you're engaged.
LEADMALE:You just don't do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Nancy's been real good to you.
SUPFEMALE:Don't act like i'm a criminal.
LEADFEMALE:You guys would have done the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You're saying that because you're married and you're whipped.
LEADMALE:He's got you there, chuckie.
LEADFEMALE:Leon, you're not married.
SUPMALE:Help me out here.
LEADMALE:Let's say melanie griffith wants you bad.
SUPFEMALE:Are you going to tell her no? Actually, i'd say no.
LEADFEMALE:The hell you would! you lying dog! Guys, i'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, you are, leon.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't roseanne tell you? tell me what? That i'm gay.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Jeez, i-i thought you knew.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No, i mean, you know, it's ok.
SUPFEMALE:It happens.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:It did.
SUPFEMALE:Well--well, you know, um i--i know a gay guy.
LEADMALE:Uh, his name's bill.
OTHERFEMALE:He--he lives in chicago m-maybe you know him.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, sure, i know him.
LEADMALE:From chicago-gay bill.
LEADMALE:Smooth, chuckie.
SUPFEMALE:What? Nobody else is saying anything.
OTHERMALE:I've got an idea.
LEADMALE:Let's play cards.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Who's next? Ok, leon.
LEADFEMALE:Forget about melanie griffith.
LEADFEMALE:Let's say andy griffith hits on you.
LEADMALE:Are you telling me you'd say no? Hey listen, dan, you know you guys are right.
SUPMALE:Nancy and i got something special going, and for me to do what i did-i've never sunk so low.
LEADMALE:Ok.
SUPFEMALE:For the sake of argument.
SUPFEMALE:I'm making some changes.
LEADMALE:You're going to see a new arnie.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to tell nancy? Hell, no.
SUPMALE:The new arnie wouldn't rat out the old arnie.
LEADMALE:Well, hi, arnie.
SUPMALE:I gotta go.
SUPMALE:I'll walk you to the door.
LEADFEMALE:I insist.
OTHERFEMALE:You took advantage of my sister, and for that, you must die.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie no one took advantage of anybody.
LEADFEMALE:She was drunk and depressed.
LEADFEMALE:Women are like that around me.
OTHERMALE:Did you tell anybody? did you tell dan? No, i swear.
LEADFEMALE:If you breathe a word to anybody in this town, i'm going to tell nancy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do that, please.
SUPFEMALE:You stay away from my sister.
LEADFEMALE:Did you clear that with her? Get out! Hey, honey.
OTHERMALE:How come you didn't tell me leon was gay? what difference does it make? You're all pigs.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
OTHERFEMALE:It's open.
LEADMALE:Hey! Are you alone? yeah, why? who do you think is going to be here? God knows.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:How are you doing? Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? uh are you mad at me? why? Well i figure, you know what you did with arnie, that was kind of like a cry for help.
SUPMALE:More like a scream.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and i wasn't listening, and i want to apologize for being a jerk last night.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the jerk, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I screwed up my own life, and i can't blame you or mom, or arnie or gary, or anybody.
OTHERMALE:Well, mom? I've got to figure out what's wrong with my life and fix it.
LEADFEMALE:First off, i'm going to stop thinking my life won't be complete unless i find a man.
SUPMALE:Good for you.
SUPFEMALE:I figured out what i'm going to do about a job.
LEADFEMALE:Something i can be proud of, like when i was a cop.
SUPFEMALE:What? well, it sounds a bit crazy but there's a school, over in elgin? you're going back to school? I think that's great.
LEADFEMALE:It's a trucking school, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:I want to learn how to drive the big rigs.
LEADMALE:The big rigs? I--i never thought of that.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:You're your own boss, you make great money, you travel well, go for it.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted to give it more thought not just dive right into it-you want to do it--do it.
OTHERMALE:Really? Yeah, really.
SUPMALE:Elgin is only like an hour from here.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Now? Yeah, now.
OTHERMALE:We'll go and get you signed up.
LEADFEMALE:I'll drive.
OTHERMALE:You think? Yeah, i think.
OTHERMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:A trucker? God! Hello, lorraine, it's roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't give me that no habla ingles crap.
LEADFEMALE:I know it's you.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you come and get this dog? Oh, right.
LEADMALE:Like kenny has the mumps.
LEADMALE:I really believe that.
LEADMALE:And stop making like it's a bad connection.
LEADFEMALE:I know it's you.
SUPMALE:I'm bringing this dog over to your house and drop him off, and you'd better not do what you did before.
SUPFEMALE:I knew you were home.
LEADFEMALE:As soon as i reached the door, the lights went off.
LEADMALE:They are not security lights.
SUPMALE:Security lights don't go out when someone comes up to the door.
SUPFEMALE:Lorraine! lorraine! Lorraine! 
OTHERMALE:How long do we have to stay here? Just till your dad gets back.
LEADFEMALE:Why? do you have some date with mark or something? No.
SUPMALE:We're fighting.
LEADMALE:What about? Well, he's a pig.
LEADFEMALE:The whole world revolves around him.
LEADMALE:I swear, mother, i'm so sick of it.
LEADMALE:I'm thinking of telling him to bug off.
LEADFEMALE:Don't toy with me, becky.
OTHERFEMALE:Finally.
SUPMALE:Hey, look.
LEADFEMALE:It's a little baby bike.
LEADMALE:Get off it, honey.
SUPMALE:You'll kill it.
LEADMALE:I thought it was cute, so i traded it for that triumph i rebuilt.
LEADFEMALE:That was a $7,000 bike.
LEADFEMALE:Then what am i doing with this $8,000 check? oh! oh! we're not going to die! oh! oh! this is great! can i get a car? No! But we just got all this money.
SUPMALE:It's for us.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Get your own money, see.
LEADFEMALE:So how much can we get for this here scooter? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:A couple hundred bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Well-built, low mileage.
OTHERMALE:Good engine.
LEADFEMALE:It's a good little scooter.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's haul it out there to the showroom floor.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want it out there with the real bikes.
LEADMALE:Well, i'll take it.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Out of the question.
OTHERMALE:Why not? Don't think you can't handle it.
LEADMALE:You don't know that till you give me a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, i gotta go deal with a customer.
SUPMALE:The answer's no.
SUPFEMALE:Mom.
SUPFEMALE:He said no.
LEADMALE:Mom, dad sells motorcycles.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, he must think that-can i help you? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I was thinking about getting one of these.
LEADFEMALE:You ever ride before? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what we have here is mainly restored classics, which is perfect for the first-timer.
SUPMALE:I like that one.
LEADFEMALE:'73 norton.
LEADFEMALE:Good choice.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Sit on it.
OTHERMALE:Feel it.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, you're being really unfair.
SUPMALE:I'm working now, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, you get back in here! This is great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: i said no! Becky: give me one good reason.
LEADFEMALE:Because bikes kill! Ok, becky? I mean, just ask your aunt jackie.
LEADMALE:When she was a cop, she used to scrape kids like you off the street all the time.
LEADFEMALE:And don't think a helmet's gonna help.
SUPFEMALE:All's that does is catch your brains after they fall out of your skull.
SUPFEMALE:Don't forget to tell your friends about us.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha! Hi.
LEADMALE:We're unable to get to the phone right now, so leave a message, and we'll get back to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Beep.
LEADMALE:Dan: what happened to, "bikes are dangerous"? Roseanne: i used to think that till you said what you said.
LEADMALE:What did i say? "no daughter of mine is going to ride a bike.
SUPFEMALE:" that is what you said, dan.
LEADMALE:"no daughter of mine's going to ride a bike.
SUPMALE:" you know, like it's ok for a boy, but not for a girl.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I meant, becky's my daughter, and no daughter of mine, such as becky, is going to ride a motorcycle.
OTHERMALE:Oh, bull.
OTHERFEMALE:It's true.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? well, if d.j. was 17 and he wanted a bike, would you let him have one? you really want becky risking her life on a motorcycle? Well, if the only reason you're saying no is because she's a girl, then yes.
SUPFEMALE:What? I'm getting a motorcycle.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Mom and dad are gonna let you have a bike? It's not a matter of letting me have it, darlene.
LEADMALE:It's a matter of women being exploited by men for centuries.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe you, dan.
LEADMALE:You're still, like, living in the fifties.
OTHERMALE:Go on.
SUPFEMALE:Risk your child's life just to spite me.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need your permission.
LEADMALE:Mom, i'm really sorry you had to have that fight with dad.
LEADMALE:It's ok.
SUPFEMALE:I won.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess i shouldn't pick up the scooter for a couple days, huh? You know, let dad get used to the idea.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not getting any bike.
LEADMALE:Well, you were just saying-forget what i said.
OTHERFEMALE:They're dangerous.
LEADMALE:Oh, for a girl, is that it? If d.j. was 17 and he wanted a bike, you'd let him.
LEADMALE:No, i would not.
LEADFEMALE:But i would let darlene, so figure that one out.
LEADMALE:You know, you're worse than dad, because you're a woman, and you should know better.
SUPMALE:Hey, becky, if you want a car, then you can just go get a job and buy yourself a car, but you're not getting a bike! And you what is it with you? All you do is just lay here on the couch staring at that stupid tv.
SUPFEMALE:One dumb rerun after another.
LEADFEMALE:And i do it as well as any man.
SUPMALE:Sorry i'm late.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:I got tied up at trucking school.
LEADFEMALE:I am really enjoying it, and my teacher told me that he thought i was doing really good.
SUPFEMALE:Only he's not sure that i can handle the solitude that a trucker's got to live with, right, so he dares me to sit in one one of the rigs for three hours, alone, no one to talk to, no one's talking to me.
LEADFEMALE:For three hoursalone.
LEADFEMALE:And i did it, and i feel great.
LEADFEMALE:Hip-hip-hooray, huh? Hello.
SUPFEMALE:You guys, you're just screwing with me, right? We have had a fight, and we're not speaking to each other.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what was the fight about? Maybe i can take a side.
LEADMALE:D.j. , what did you do in school today? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Oh, well that must have been really fun for you.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, you going to, uh you gonna run for student council again this year? Oh, i can't.
SUPMALE:I got to get a job.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, student council will help me get into college, but hey, who needs a future? Good.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Darlene, how's that first year of high school treating you? Oh, don't drag me into this.
LEADMALE:You answer her, darlene.
LEADMALE:Why? Because if you don't, she will come after me next.
LEADMALE:High school's very educational, aunt jackie.
OTHERMALE:You make the basketball team? Of course she made it.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't make first string.
SUPMALE:Give it time.
SUPMALE:You're only a freshman.
LEADFEMALE:When's your first game? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean you don't know? I mean, i don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I quit the team.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? I am no longer on the basketball team.
SUPMALE:You didn't talk to me first? well, it's my decision, isn't it? what happened? you didn't make first string, so you're just bailing out? Look, i got other stuff to do.
LEADMALE:What other stuff? Hey, it's not like it was gonna be my career.
SUPMALE:Stop putting this jock label on me.
LEADMALE:See, there you go again, dan.
OTHERMALE:You're doing it again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god, here we go.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, this has nothing to do with becky or the scooter or with women's lib.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's just so easy for you, isn't it, dan? Darlene is the jock, and becky's the brain.
LEADMALE:What am i? We don't know yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene's got a lot of talent, roseanne.
LEADMALE:She doesn't want to be your little jock, dan, so stop using her to fulfill some of your fantasies about being some great girl basketball player.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you want to be a quitter, be a quitter.
LEADFEMALE:I give up.
LEADFEMALE:Quitter.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i thought that was a really good point-shut up, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Mother, there are absolutely no jobs out there that are right for me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i need something that'll leave me time to study and help around the house.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you know, what if you really need me here and i'm off at some stupid job? You know, you're right, becky.
LEADMALE:You should forget about the stupid job, because you know what? Your father and i have decided that we're just going to get you your very own little convertible.
LEADMALE:Really? Yes, and you're gonna be able to drive it right up to your palatial four-bedroom condo overlooking beautiful lake not! Hello.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, it's for you.
LEADMALE:Who is it? who is it? It's marcy.
SUPFEMALE:What does she want? I don't know what she-she wants you to pick up the phone.
LEADFEMALE:How'd that kid get so damn rude? She must get it from dad.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Oh, nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Nah.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Oh, gee, darlene.
LEADMALE:I wish you could open up to me like that.
SUPMALE:What did marcy want? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:She called for nothing? She wanted to do something.
SUPMALE:I didn't feel like it.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, so what are you going to do? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:That's what you did last weekend.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, i'm not finished.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, darlene.
LEADMALE:It's a beautiful day.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to go out there and do something.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to do something.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i want you to.
LEADFEMALE:Now come on, go on.
LEADFEMALE:What should i do, mother? Wellok.
SUPMALE:You need some school clothes, right? I'm gonna give you my rodbell's charge card, and i want you to go down to the mall and pick yourself out something.
LEADMALE:What? I don't need any clothes, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Here's the card.
OTHERFEMALE:Just do it.
LEADFEMALE:What should i buy? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Go try to find something to blend in with the couch.
LEADMALE:Oh, so that's the way it works around here? you lie around like a hairball, and you get free clothes? Maybe if i lapse into a coma, i'll get that car.
SUPMALE:Okey dokey, here we go.
SUPMALE:Now, that is espresso.
LEADFEMALE:Am i right, roseanne? Eew, i hate it.
SUPFEMALE:Blah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it is generally enjoyed by those of us with a more refined palate.
LEADFEMALE:I realize it'll never be the beverage of choice down at the harvest hoedown.
LEADMALE:Well, golly gee, bonnie mae.
LEADMALE:This coffee does taste right good, but how am i supposed to dip my doughnut into this teensy weensy little glass? Little help here.
SUPFEMALE:Just push the espresso.
LEADMALE:Hi, walter.
LEADFEMALE:How's everything up in the electronics department? And my boss wants them all tuned to mtv and sports.
LEADMALE:Not news, not the real world.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:The real world's depressing.
LEADMALE:The real world doesn't sell tvs.
LEADMALE:Sex sells.
LEADMALE:Right? sex is all anybody wants, right? If the tropical rain forest looked like a big pair of breasts, we'd take better care of it.
LEADMALE:Uh, you want some espresso, walter? Fine.
LEADMALE:No espresso for walter.
SUPMALE:He might explode.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, leon.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be fun.
LEADMALE:All right, but take away his silverware.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you going to say hi to bonnie? Hello, bonnie.
LEADMALE:Hi, darlene.
LEADMALE:Let's see what you bought.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, i'll miss the bus.
LEADFEMALE:Here, knock yourself out.
LEADMALE:Ok, let's check it out here.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:You didn't happen to accidentally pick up zorro's bag by mistake? are you making some sort of a statement here? No, i just like them.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:You hang out a while.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give you a ride home.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how long's it gonna be? leon, how much longer till i'm off? Well, you're on the schedule for one more hour, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll just get my coat.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'll walk.
OTHERMALE:Boy.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what's with her.
LEADMALE:She's been like this for a couple of weeks now.
SUPFEMALE:She just isn't into anything.
SUPMALE:You know what? Maybe she's having a hard time adjusting to high school.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Well i don't know what to tell you, roseanne, except if it's a boy no.
LEADMALE:'cause remember that barry kid? valentine's day dance? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, she's like, really mental over him there for a while, right? So he drops by the other day, and she spends the whole time just watching tv and totally ignoring him.
SUPMALE:I mean, ok, i used to watch tv and ignore dan, too, but only when we were making out.
SUPFEMALE:What about her friends? What if she's hanging around with a bad influence.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene always was the bad influence.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Watching basketball.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Mind if i join you? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:I love pre-season basketball.
SUPMALE:You get a chance to watch guys that'll be on the next plane to the italian league in about 10 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and he misses the easy lay-up.
LEADMALE:Buon giorno.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this guy.
SUPMALE:Cut it out.
SUPFEMALE:What? i quit because i didn't want to play, all right? I didn't say anything.
OTHERMALE:Come on, dad.
LEADMALE:Just do it.
OTHERMALE:Quitters never win, winners never quit.
LEADMALE:I let go of that two weeks ago, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
OTHERMALE:I did.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? well, then how come you just sat down and started talking about basketball? It was on tv.
LEADFEMALE:That's not it.
LEADFEMALE:All we ever talk about is basketball.
SUPFEMALE:No, any time i try to talk to you about anything, you turn it into basketball, and you run away.
SUPMALE:Face it, dad.
LEADFEMALE:All we ever used to do is talk about sports.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i'm a big girl-right, right, and i label you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's crap.
LEADFEMALE:We used to talk about everything.
LEADMALE:We could talk about anything.
OTHERFEMALE:I still want to.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Pick a topic.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll yak all night.
LEADMALE:Yak away.
SUPMALE:Just leave me out of it.
LEADFEMALE:And there she goes.
LEADMALE:She's off.
LEADFEMALE:Around the couch and up the stairs right into her room, where she'll hide out like she always does.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me tell you something, little missy.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need to stand here and have you not talk to me.
LEADMALE:I got a wife and two other kids that are perfectly happy not to talk to me! What? where the hell you been? what's with you? Darlene's turning into a zombie, and you're doing nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doing the best i can, dan.
LEADMALE:Why's this about me? I didn't raise her alone, buddy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, you let her do whatever the hell she wants.
SUPFEMALE:If it was up to me, darlene would still be playing basketball.
SUPMALE:Basketball is not her problem, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I know that! you think i don't know that?! what do you think i am, stupid? what are you yelling at me for? Because i'm angry, and i need to yell, and you're standing in front of me, and she's not! Oh, ok.
LEADMALE:Well, you keep yelling, honey, and when it's my turn to yell, you just point at me.
LEADMALE:What are we going to do? Well, we'll just talk to her calmly and rationally and sensitively until she cracks.
LEADMALE:Darlene! I already tried it.
LEADMALE:It's your turn.
LEADMALE:Darlene! What? Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
SUPMALE:Jeez.
LEADFEMALE:I just did this with dad.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, right, like that counts for anything.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Sit down and talk to mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Can we just get this over with, please? Ok.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm really worried about you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You're like, withdrawn and distant and i just wondered if there's anything you want to talk about.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, darlene.
SUPMALE:You know how impressed your dad would be if you'd tell me what the problem is and i could fix it? why is everyone so sure that there's some problem? Well, because you don't go anyplace, you don't do anything.
SUPMALE:You know, at least when you had basketball-basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go again.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Come on back.
SUPMALE:I'm not telling you to play basketball.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's about the stupidest sport in the world anyway.
LEADMALE:And i spent all 4 years of high school pretending like i had cramps so i didn't have to play it, but i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It seemed like when you had basketball, you cared about something, you know? what do you care about now? I care about being left alone.
SUPFEMALE:Are you doing drugs, darlene? no! Would you tell me if you were? If i was, no, i wouldn't tell you, but since i'm not, the answer is no.
LEADMALE:Why should i believe you? Because i'm saying it.
LEADFEMALE:You can search my room, give me a blood test, do whatever you want.
SUPFEMALE:So what is it, darlene? is it school? It's school, it's my friends, it's the way i look, it's you, it's dad, it's everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, ok.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i can really relate to that, 'cause when i was-please, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want you to help me.
LEADMALE:I just want you to leave me alone, please.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, what did you do to the meatloaf? well, i guess i burned it, didn't i? But you can scrape off the outside and still eat the inside.
SUPMALE:I don't like it.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't even taste it.
LEADFEMALE:I want peanut butter and jelly.
OTHERMALE:Hey, i'm not a restaurant, ok? You eat what i cook, or you don't eat at all.
LEADMALE:Jeez.
SUPFEMALE:I want peanut butter and jelly.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, i'm going to go see if darlene wants to come down.
LEADFEMALE:I really should talk to her.
LEADMALE:Dan, just leave her alone.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Tv: thank you very much.
LEADMALE:Welcome to a brand-new season on the $100,000 pyramid.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
SUPMALE:I'm depressed.
LEADMALE:You're not getting the scooter, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Damn it! What a dweeb.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:The bulls lead is 6.
SUPMALE:Michael jordan into the front court, outside left.
LEADFEMALE:Paxson between the circles plays it right side to grant.
SUPMALE:Horace speeds it back left to jordan.
LEADMALE:Michael steps in the lane.
OTHERFEMALE:Hangs the ball off to paxson right side.
SUPFEMALE:Now cliff with a 13-footer out front right through.
SUPMALE:Cliff levingston just checking.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, god, maybe i should take the test next week.
OTHERFEMALE:Relax, jackie, you only missed one.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got this trucking license nailed.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, next question.
OTHERMALE:What is the importance of proper weight distribution? To avoid being top-heavy.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't have to worry about that, aunt jackie.
LEADMALE:God, i hate kathy bowman.
SUPFEMALE:And today's reason is? She spends about a billion dollars on all this furniture that looks like it belongs in italy, and now she's giving it away to charity.
LEADFEMALE:This couch don't even have any butt-dents in it.
LEADMALE:How can you take a nice, charitable thing and turn it into a mean, vindictive thing? Hey, that's what makes me, me.
OTHERFEMALE:She's just giving away that coffee table to show off.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, quiz me.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Uh, gross vehicle weight.
SUPFEMALE:Um, total weight of single vehicle plus its load.
LEADMALE:Oh, o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:That's way too good for the needy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be back.
LEADMALE:You ready? Yeah.
LEADMALE:What is the proper procedure to follow if your vehicle is leaking toxic fluids in a residential neighborhood? okay, it's got something to do with those orange cones, right? no? O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:They'll never ask that on the test anyway.
LEADMALE:Did anybody bring the paper in? No, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, i'm really sorry.
SUPFEMALE:About what? I didn't mean it.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do, you little freak? I was in your room.
LEADFEMALE:It was an accident.
SUPMALE:Oh, i'm going to kill you, d.j. really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Just driving her crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Excellent work, son.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, dad.
LEADMALE:I'm so damn proud i could burst.
SUPFEMALE:Stay.
LEADMALE:God, is that tacky.
LEADMALE:I know it.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you believe kathy bowman was giving this to the good samaritans? These go for 200 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:I gave the good samaritan driver 20 bucks for it.
LEADFEMALE:Plus, the money's going to charity.
SUPMALE:What do you think, dan? It is snowing outside? 'cause this must be christmas.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha ha! I knew you'd love it.
LEADMALE:It's art.
LEADMALE:It ain't just art.
LEADFEMALE:It's got a big hole in the back where you can stick stuff in.
SUPFEMALE:You done good, honey.
LEADMALE:This is a great piece of crap.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you what, this piece of crap totally out-craps all our other crap.
OTHERMALE:So we follow these good samaritan trucks around and buy stuff really cheap.
OTHERFEMALE:Then we go to a swap meet and sell it for an embarrassing amount of money.
LEADFEMALE:What about the good samaritans? isn't that going to cut into their business? Forget about them.
SUPMALE:We're squeezing them out.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, what are you doing? Well, i'm changing the cherry on the fruit cups, leon.
LEADMALE:It is wednesday, isn't it? All day.
LEADFEMALE:I thought so.
LEADFEMALE:How old are these? I don't know.
SUPMALE:They've been here since i got hired.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, ladies.
OTHERMALE:Hey, steven.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Are you ready, leon? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:We've got lots of packing to do.
LEADMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADMALE:Are you going on a trip? Steven is.
LEADMALE:Because steven must magically disappear whenever leon's mother comes to town.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we settled this.
SUPMALE:You're not the one being kicked out of your home, are you leon.
LEADFEMALE:Why kick him out? don't your mom know you're gay? Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:My mother knows.
OTHERMALE:That doesn't mean she's going to be comfortable staying in the same house with me and my lover.
LEADMALE:Why not? Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:How do they know how she's going to react unless they give her a chance? Thanks, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I've been saying that for three years.
SUPMALE:Yes, thank you, roseanne, if you don't mind, butt out.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to hear her opinion.
SUPFEMALE:Please, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Don't look at me.
SUPMALE:I want to hear what you have to say, too.
SUPFEMALE:Well of course i totally agree with my boss' position here and everything, but i understand where steven's coming from, too, 'cause he just wants to be acknowledged.
SUPMALE:I mean, he's like your wife--or your husband.
OTHERMALE:I don't really know how you guys work this out.
LEADFEMALE:For instance, i don't know who does the cleaning and who watches monday night football, but-well that clearly was a waste of time.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think i should have the opportunity to get to know his mother? why are you asking her? Because she understands.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody does but you.
OTHERFEMALE:No, she is not everybody.
SUPFEMALE:She is nobody.
OTHERFEMALE:Steven, my mother is a 70-year-old woman.
LEADFEMALE:She was uncomfortable with mary martin as peter pan.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to be very, very awkward for her.
LEADFEMALE:Awkward for you, leon.
LEADFEMALE:Can we talk about this at home? are you embarrassed about who you are? No.
LEADFEMALE:Is it about me? No.
LEADFEMALE:Then stop hiding me.
OTHERMALE:Let me stay in my home when your mother visits.
SUPFEMALE:This is important to me, leon.
LEADMALE:Leon please.
LEADMALE:All right, no packing.
LEADFEMALE:You can stay.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Attaboy, leon.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, did it ever occur to you even one moment to stay out of this? Yeah, but by then it was way too late.
LEADMALE:Oh, you guys.
LEADMALE:My own fuzzy dice.
LEADFEMALE:Smell them.
OTHERFEMALE:They smell.
OTHERFEMALE:Two bucks more, but when your sister gets her trucker's license, you pull out all the stops.
SUPMALE:You aced the driving part? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You'd be surprised how courteous people are when they see an 18-wheeler with "student driver" written on it.
OTHERMALE:So what comes next? I start out short-hauling and then ease into the five-night interstate hauls.
LEADFEMALE:Five nights? do you stay at motels? The cab's got a sleeping compartment.
LEADFEMALE:But it doesn't have a shower, does it? That's why she needs the dice scented.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Bowman's coming, and she looks mad.
LEADMALE:That's my fault.
SUPFEMALE:My rig's blocking her driveway.
LEADMALE:I better get it back to the lot.
LEADMALE:Anybody want a ride? Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:Darlene? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Darlene, it'll be fun.
SUPFEMALE:You can roll down the window and spit into convertibles.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:That's kathy.
SUPMALE:I don't want her thinking you was picking through her trash, so here's the deal.
LEADMALE:We paid full price for that dog at rodbell's-i thought they went for 200.
LEADMALE:Well, we overpaid because we're making a fortune at the shop.
LEADFEMALE:Got it, lovey.
SUPMALE:But do be quick.
SUPMALE:We dine with the snotheads at 8:00.
SUPMALE:Hi, jackie just went out to move her-roseanne my house was robbed.
SUPMALE:We were away for the weekend, and two guys dressed like good samaritans just backed a van up to the house and cleaned us out in broad daylight.
SUPMALE:Oh, th-that is unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:You--you better sit down.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Henderson said he saw the entire thing and didn't do a thing.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of a neighbor is that? That's a bad, bad neighbor.
LEADMALE:I feel so so violated.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure you do.
OTHERMALE:They took things i've been collecting for years.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:They took that stuff? That's bad.
OTHERMALE:Hey, if you're going to be mad at anybody, be mad at them.
SUPMALE:The police are going to take statements.
LEADMALE:I don't suppose you saw anything.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Well, they seemed really nice.
SUPMALE:They called me "ma'am" and everything.
LEADMALE:Wait, you spoke to the criminals? Well, haggled is more like it.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:That's my umbrella stand.
LEADFEMALE:Umbrellas.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
OTHERMALE:You--you bought this from the robbers? how could you do that? didn't you see the big-screen tv in the truck? do you really think we would have given away a brand new 45-inch television to charity? Well, it would have been a nice gesture.
LEADMALE:I don't believe you, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Just calm down here.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know your house was getting robbed.
LEADFEMALE:I thought i was doing a good thing.
LEADMALE:I thought i was doing something for charity.
LEADMALE:A good thing? It was a stupid thing, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:It was the stupidest thing anybody's ever done.
SUPFEMALE:You're the stupidest woman on the face of the earth.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? I paid 20 bucks for that piece of crap, and you paid 200! that's stupid! I was starting to worry about you guys you been gone a long time.
SUPMALE:You should have worried.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie almost killed us.
LEADFEMALE:She was just showing how well the rig cornered.
LEADFEMALE:She missed the bus stop by almost a foot.
OTHERMALE:Everybody there dove under the bench.
LEADFEMALE:They were old.
OTHERMALE:They panicked.
LEADFEMALE:It was so cool.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you had fun, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what about me? It doesn't sound like you had any fun, becky.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, jer.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne here? She's at her friend crystal's.
OTHERMALE:Uh, could we talk? Sure.
LEADMALE:Want a beer? Definitely.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry about what happened to you guys.
LEADMALE:The insurance should cover everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's good, yeah.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, dan, uh, kathy wants to put up an electric fence.
LEADMALE:An electric fence won't do you no good, jerry.
SUPFEMALE:They're not going to rob you again.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not for burglars.
LEADFEMALE:It's for roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Electricity won't stop her.
SUPFEMALE:I've tried.
SUPFEMALE:She's not much of a swimmer, though.
LEADFEMALE:You might want to build a moat.
SUPMALE:I've got to do something.
SUPFEMALE:She wants to move back to chicago.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Really? Wow.
SUPMALE:Anything i can do? could you get roseanne to apologize? Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:When you move, can i have your satellite dish? what are we going to do, dan? Our wives just-they just-hate each other.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's good for them, jer.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne gets so worked up over kathy she gets all flushed, her heart races, works up a sweat.
LEADMALE:It's kind of an aerobic thing.
LEADFEMALE:Look at the weight she's lost since you guys moved in.
SUPFEMALE:I can't leave without something, dan.
LEADMALE:I mean, she's--she's making my life miserable.
LEADMALE:Oh, here.
LEADFEMALE:Take the pooch, jer.
SUPMALE:Roseanne was going to return it anyway, but this way you get it in one piece.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:But kathy said we should start a neighborhood watch.
LEADMALE:But that's what happened, jer.
SUPFEMALE:You got robbed, and the neighborhood watched.
OTHERMALE:Morning.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, leon.
SUPFEMALE:What? so? So fill me in.
LEADMALE:How's your mom handling everything? Fine.
SUPMALE:The plane was late, but everything else was fine.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Whoa, we better stay out of his way.
OTHERFEMALE:That won't be no fun.
LEADFEMALE:Remember what happened yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:We need to mind our own business.
SUPMALE:If i wanted to do that, i wouldn't have came in early.
OTHERMALE:What? Well, maybe you want to talk about it.
LEADMALE:Only got a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:Roseanne-well, there you are.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were going back to work.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking to roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Believe me, that's work.
LEADMALE:You ran away, left me alone with mother.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you call her that.
LEADMALE:I'll never be good enough for that woman.
OTHERFEMALE:All she does is pick, pick, pick.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you wanted a mother-in-law.
LEADMALE:Where is she now? In housewares.
LEADMALE:You left her there? you know what she's doing? Buying us a waffle iron.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my.
LEADMALE:Let's have her arrested.
LEADMALE:We don't eat waffles.
LEADMALE:You don't make them.
LEADFEMALE:You do nothing in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:I work all day.
SUPMALE:And i don't? Yeah, your little bookstore.
SUPFEMALE:I happen to own that bookstore.
OTHERMALE:Wisely located right next to the library.
LEADFEMALE:Don't bring that up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm allowed.
LEADMALE:If i hadn't sunk my life savings into it, i wouldn't be working in this dump! Hello.
LEADFEMALE:I hate you, leon.
SUPFEMALE:I hate you more.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'll just be up in housewares.
SUPFEMALE:I would tell mom if i was gay.
SUPMALE:You couldn't tell her you were going to be a cop.
LEADFEMALE:How could you tell her you were gay? Easy.
LEADMALE:It would kill her.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:What if d.j. was gay, would you want him to tell you? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want him keeping secrets from me.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't mind? No.
SUPMALE:They only thing i've wanted for my kids is that they're happy and out of the house.
LEADMALE:And i'll tell you what, happy ain't even that important.
LEADMALE:How about you, dan? how would you feel if d.j. was gay? It's not going to happen.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm-hey! It's not going to happen.
SUPFEMALE:Woo, you winged him.
LEADFEMALE:I got it! What's dan's problem? Oh, d.j. 's his only son.
LEADMALE:He's got that thing where he wants d.j. to carry on the conner name.
SUPMALE:I said becky would probably have kids before she was married and they'd be conners, but that don't count for him.
OTHERMALE:Mom! What? Oh.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, this is officer robbins.
LEADFEMALE:He's here to take your statement.
SUPFEMALE:Just tell him the truth.
OTHERFEMALE:He'll go easy on you.
LEADMALE:Hi, gil.
LEADMALE:How you doing? Hey, rosie.
LEADMALE:How are you doing? you know each other? Yeah, we went to high school together.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this town.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a real pill you got living next door.
LEADMALE:Yeah, tell me about it, man.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Bowman says you saw one of the robbers.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Could you give us a description? uh, do you remember what jimmy mullins looked like in high school? He looked like that.
LEADMALE:You don't think it was jimmy? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:This guy's nose was more scoopier.
LEADMALE:You know, kind of like bob hope's nose.
SUPFEMALE:But definitely not jimmy? No, not jimmy.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Good? well, what do we have here? So far we've eliminated jimmy mullins and bob hope.
LEADMALE:Well, i didn't see the driver.
LEADFEMALE:That could have been bob hope.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, you want a beer, gil? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Aren't you on duty? Never mind, rosie.
SUPFEMALE:Now can we please get on with this? you got a description of the vehicle? It was a blue truck.
LEADMALE:Jackie! gil! How've you been? Great.
SUPFEMALE:We've missed you down at the station.
LEADFEMALE:I miss you guys, too.
SUPMALE:What's been going on? Real quiet.
SUPFEMALE:Let me-excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Focus on the fact my house has been robbed.
LEADMALE:God, you're so rude.
LEADFEMALE:What do i have to do to get some justice around here? We put an apb out on the truck, and we'll be checking pawn shops to see if your stuff turns up there.
LEADMALE:That's it? There's not much else we can do.
OTHERMALE:I'd suggest a security system and telling your neighbors when you leave town.
LEADMALE:Hey, gil.
SUPFEMALE:Danny! oh! Want a beer? uh--may i? Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:I got my trucking license.
OTHERFEMALE:You can tell me on the cb where the radar traps are.
LEADMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:I'm in hell.
LEADFEMALE:Naw, you're just in lanford.
LEADMALE:Same zip code, though.
SUPFEMALE:You want a beer? No, i don't.
LEADMALE:What i want is not to live here anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You know, kathy, i just want you to know i sure am sorry about what happened and everything.
LEADMALE:You know, lanford's not a bad town.
LEADFEMALE:You just got to go with it more, you know, fit in.
LEADMALE:And what does that mean, roseanne? am i supposed to wander around town in a tacky housecoat and flip-flops, with my hair in curlers? Now you're getting it! Yeah, absolutely, and then i'll throw us one of these here tupperware parties.
LEADMALE:Then i could introduce you to the others.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? Oh, we all used to be like you, kathy-angry, bitter, annoying.
LEADMALE:But now we're the lanford wives.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:It's useless to try to resist us, kathy.
LEADFEMALE:We already have jerry.
LEADFEMALE:Jerry's one of us.
OTHERMALE:Jerry joined the lodge.
LEADFEMALE:You're a sick woman, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you'll start to love it.
LEADMALE:I promise, kathy.
SUPFEMALE:Just think about it-swap meets, bowling leagues, bingo, double coupon days, casino night at the slaughterhouse! It's your destiny.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should check the house, jer.
LEADMALE:Checking.
SUPMALE:Still there.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Doing a hell of a job.
LEADMALE:So, jer, uh if you don't mind, i'd like to ask a personal question.
SUPMALE:You don't have to answer.
OTHERMALE:She's just not happy here in lanford, dan.
SUPMALE:Unfortunately, that's the only side you get to see, but behind closed doors, she shows a whole other side.
LEADMALE:Do you know, there have actually been mornings i've woken up dehydrated? Yep, that's what rosie figured.
SUPMALE:Have a beer, jer.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? Three blocks away, maybe four.
LEADMALE:Not our jurisdiction.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's not him.
SUPFEMALE:That's not him, either.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-uh.
SUPMALE:Too tall.
OTHERFEMALE:That's him! The guy who looks like jimmy mullins.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Aah! no! no! don't! aah! aah! no! don't! no! get over here! aah! Hello? roseanne? dan? It's kathy.
LEADMALE:Is--is everything o.

LEADFEMALE:I, uh i--i need to go home, i-would you look at this mess? I don't know how many times i've said it-it's just like gutting a fish.
LEADFEMALE:I swear, i was way better the last time.
LEADFEMALE:The last time? You know with becky's dad.
SUPFEMALE:He was blond, too.
SUPMALE:Hey, you've got a garbage disposal over your house, right? Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:Please, please i--i need to go home.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.

LEADFEMALE:We got kathy good.
SUPFEMALE:She almost lost it.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Damn good bladder control, though.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I did laugh pretty hard.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, i'm going out tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Will you be home for dinner? I don't know.

SUPFEMALE:Liver.
SUPFEMALE:Heh heh.
LEADMALE:God, i wish i had an adult role model.
LEADMALE:Where you going tonight? you got some sort a party? what are you going as? I'm going as becky.
LEADFEMALE:That ought to scare the crap out of them.
LEADFEMALE:Funny.
SUPFEMALE:It's not a party.
LEADMALE:It's a movie.
LEADMALE:Scary movie? Mother, i've outgrown it.
OTHERFEMALE:Move on.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
OTHERMALE:How's about you, darlene.
SUPMALE:Are you dressing up all gross for mommy tonight? No.
LEADFEMALE:I think i'm just going to stay home.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong, darlene? You used to care about halloween.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I also used to want to marry scott baio.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you look great! Who am i supposed to be? I told you.
SUPMALE:You're alfalfa of the little rascals.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to be the terminator.

LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.

SUPFEMALE:Mom, why not give him a sign saying, "knock me down and steal my candy.
SUPFEMALE:" i want to do what my friends are doing.
SUPFEMALE:Well, fine.
SUPFEMALE:Do what you want and leave me out of it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it anymore, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I remember when halloween meant something.
LEADFEMALE:Remember throwing flaming bags of dog-doo on the henderson's lawn as a family? Ahh.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey! Oh, good.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie can help me yank the slime out of this thing.
SUPFEMALE:I got to get some more tubing for our costume.
LEADFEMALE:Your costume's got tubing? Maybe.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe not.
LEADMALE:Why won't you tell me what you're going as? Because it's supposed to be a surprise.
OTHERMALE:I told you what i was going as? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Morticia addams.
LEADFEMALE:Not too boring.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry it's not up to your standards.
LEADMALE:Give me half an hour.
LEADFEMALE:I'll turn you into a science experiment gone berserk.
LEADFEMALE:No, thanks.
SUPMALE:What's with the blood? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I killed dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:So, are you still going alone tonight? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:No date.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you bummed? Well, no.
LEADFEMALE:Not now.
LEADMALE:Soon? No.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i was bummed about it, around the time of the arnie disaster.
LEADFEMALE:I was so desperate for company, i actually called up some old boyfriends.
OTHERMALE:Ugh, that's pathetic.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Who did you call? I don't want to get-no.
LEADMALE:Who, who? Gary.
SUPMALE:Oh, god! And i hung up.
LEADFEMALE:And? Tim brewer.
SUPFEMALE:Who, that mama's boy? She answered although, it could have been him.
LEADMALE:Man, i'm glad that one never worked out.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and i called booker.
OTHERFEMALE:What did he have to say? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I left a message on his machine.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to get into it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need a date to have a good time.
SUPMALE:So you'll get drunk and hang around me all night.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind? mom! Where are my hand grenades? In your bottom drawer.
OTHERFEMALE:Where else? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Who's he supposed to be? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:The alfalfanator.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Well i see two women who should have consulted before choosing their costumes.
SUPFEMALE:You knew i was borrowing roseanne's wig.
LEADMALE:How could you do this? how did i know it was for halloween? what did you think? I certainly don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps to try and cover your hair color du jour.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Let's not get snippy.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I put a lot of thought into this costume-well, so did i.
LEADFEMALE:What are the odds we'd both come as morticia? you're morticia? Then, that's no problem.
LEADFEMALE:I'm elvira.
OTHERMALE:We still look like the judds from hell.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, anne marie.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to ruin the party, but elvis' ghost is here.
OTHERMALE:Arnie! Did he see me? I don't think so, but don't hang near the free food too long.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you both came as cher.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie! jackie! So close.
LEADFEMALE:I got a situation here.
LEADMALE:Nancy's with me tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:The ax murderer in the corner.
SUPFEMALE:Cute.
LEADFEMALE:You can't be coming on to me.
SUPFEMALE:Understand? I think i can control myself, arnie.
LEADFEMALE:I really appreciate it.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! She's seen us.
SUPMALE:Act like you never slept with me.
OTHERMALE:Hi, honey! i love you! ugh! O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:, everybody, quiet, please.
LEADFEMALE:Please, everybody, quiet.
SUPFEMALE:Will everybody get a seat, please? Everybody take a seat.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, ladies and gentlemen, it wouldn't be halloween unless the conners overdid it, so without further ado-hey, chuckie! Just do it like we told you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Ahem "fellow lodge members, "we had booked a fabulous act tonight, "but unfortunately they died.
LEADMALE:"but the show must go on, "so here they are, fresh from the cemetery-please welcome" oh, man.
SUPMALE:"dead-gar bergen and mortuary snerd.
OTHERMALE:" hey, everybody.
LEADMALE:It's great to be here.
OTHERFEMALE:So this is hell.
SUPFEMALE:It's worse than i thought.
OTHERFEMALE:Morty, i told you, we're in lanford.
LEADMALE:Lanford? say, isn't that arnie? I told you to go to hell.
SUPFEMALE:Now, morty.
LEADFEMALE:These are our friends.
LEADMALE:Isn't that jackie over there? I hear she's a truck driver now.
LEADFEMALE:That's a switch.
SUPMALE:Jackie in the front seat with her feet on the floor.
LEADMALE:Hey! hey! Now, morty.
LEADMALE:Be nice to the people.
LEADFEMALE:Tell them how we died.
SUPMALE:Simple.
SUPFEMALE:I let you write the jokes.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Like your shtick don't stink.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway my termite-riddled little friend, are you ready to do our little song? God, don't let her sing! shut up, arnie! Hit it, dead-gar.
OTHERFEMALE:Dada dada dum dum well, i come from 6 feet under with a dead guy on my knee i'm headin' down to hades for to spend eternity hey there, dead-gar i think it's plain to see we bought a cardboard casket and the worms have eaten me well, you won the grand prize again! Was there ever any doubt? what did the costume cost? 100? We don't do it for the money.
OTHERFEMALE:We do it for the envy.
SUPMALE:Well, you were a convincing dummy.
OTHERFEMALE:Jealous, jealous, jealous! Honey, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Look who's here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god! it's the bowmans! I wonder how he managed to drag her down to the lodge.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, dan.
LEADMALE:I know why she's here.
SUPFEMALE:She's here to get us back for what we did today.
LEADMALE:No way! I'm serious, dan, she hates the lodge.
SUPFEMALE:The only reason she'd show up on our turf is to try and humiliate us in front of our friends.
OTHERMALE:Too bad she didn't see the act.
SUPFEMALE:Could have saved her a trip.
LEADFEMALE:Great act, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, what was your favorite part? I liked the jokes.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, really? the song? how about the waterbed? See, 'cause that was my idea.
SUPMALE:Roseanne was against it, but we needed a big closer.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:You definitely needed a big closer.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, they loved the waterbed.
SUPFEMALE:Stay alert, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Kathy's over there plotting revenge.
SUPFEMALE:We know, so we've got the edge.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you're just being paranoid.
LEADFEMALE:Relax and have a good time.
SUPMALE:I am not being paranoid.
LEADMALE:They've got crystal in on it.
LEADFEMALE:She's talking to crystal, big deal.
SUPFEMALE:She's just being sociable.
OTHERMALE:Oh, right.
SUPFEMALE:When has kathy ever been sociable? O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:, we pulled one on her.
LEADMALE:She pulls one on us, we're even.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to be even.
SUPMALE:I want to be better.
LEADFEMALE:So, watch your back.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:I'll be at the bar.
SUPMALE:If i'm not back in 15 minutes i'll be at the bar.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I met this guy.
SUPFEMALE:He seems really great, but he's in this moose costume.
LEADFEMALE:No matter what, he won't take the head off.
LEADMALE:You listening to me? Yeah, yeah.
OTHERMALE:You met a moose.
SUPMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:What's with you? see that little miss yarn-head over there? Well, she don't know who she's messing with.
SUPMALE:I am the master.
SUPMALE:All's i've got to do is think.
SUPMALE:If i were her, what would i do to get even.
LEADFEMALE:Ho ho.
LEADMALE:That bitch.
LEADMALE:I said to myself, "even if it's crazy, it's my life.
LEADFEMALE:If i want to be a trucker, that's what's right for me.
OTHERMALE:" that's great.
OTHERFEMALE:You're independent, get to travel-it's perfect for you.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know it's perfect for me? I've just got this feeling.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Take off the mask.
SUPMALE:I told you you might be disappointed.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want that to happen until after we've had sex.
SUPFEMALE:You're pretty sure of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hunting season starts tomorrow, so it's now or never.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Take off the moose head.
LEADFEMALE:All right, but you've really been digging me up until now.
SUPFEMALE:Trick or treat.
SUPMALE:Booker? I got your call.
LEADMALE:Damn it.
SUPMALE:I thought it was somebody good.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, dan.
LEADMALE:Hey, jer.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, where's rosie? where's kathy? At the car getting a sweater.
OTHERMALE:Then rosie's in the bushes watching her.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks kathy's going to get even for the trick.
SUPMALE:Kathy was so mad she didn't speak to me all day.
LEADMALE:You owe me a beer.
LEADMALE:I guess i do.
SUPFEMALE:Gus why call if you didn't want to see me? It wasn't a happy time that night at jackie's.
SUPMALE:I wanted to talk to someone who wasn't my sister.
LEADMALE:So you needed to talk to someone, here i am, let's talk.
SUPFEMALE:I called other guys.
OTHERMALE:I'm the only one that showed up.
LEADMALE:We don't know that.
LEADFEMALE:There is someone dressed as madonna who could very well be tim brewer.
SUPFEMALE:I made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, sit down.
LEADMALE:There's something i've been wanting to ask you since we broke up.
SUPFEMALE:Why did we break up? You were seeing somebody else.
LEADFEMALE:So it was my fault.
SUPMALE:I was afraid of that.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, kathy.
SUPMALE:Your sister is insane.
LEADMALE:Roseanne's new neighbor.
SUPMALE:Ha ha--hey! hey! booker! all right! Jackie, it's booker.
LEADMALE:Booker was the moose.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:How you been? You look great.
LEADMALE:Well-i can't talk to you now.
LEADMALE:Jerry, let's go home.
LEADMALE:Bye, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, jer.
LEADFEMALE:Leaving already, or is that what you want me to think? roseanne, why are you following me? why were you at your car? Getting my sweater.
LEADFEMALE:Why were you doing that? To get away from you.
OTHERMALE:Then what are you doing here in the first place? My husband asked me to come, so i did.
LEADFEMALE:Married people do things like that for one another.
SUPMALE:Don't make me laugh.
LEADFEMALE:How many times do i have to tell you that i am not going to waste one iota of energy getting you back? I think i'm better than that.
LEADMALE:Jerry, come.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, jer.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure you think you're better than me.
LEADFEMALE:But when you remember the terrible thing i did to you today, you'll sink to my level like a rock.
LEADMALE:Why wouldn't she get me back after i got her? am i not good enough to get? is she trying to make me feel beneath revenge? Maybe ruining your favorite night was her payback.
LEADMALE:No, dan.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't have that kind of imagination.
LEADMALE:She'll do something to get me back, and it will be really lame, and i'll be ready.
LEADMALE:I'm sure you will be, dear.
LEADMALE:I wish we would have rehearsed the act more.
LEADMALE:People didn't get we were supposed to be dead.
SUPMALE:If it's any consolation, i'm sure they wish we were.
LEADMALE:Whoa! yeow! yeow! yeow! yeow! yeow! yeow! what's going on? Snakes in the bed! It's new.
LEADFEMALE:Now it's covered with snake sweat.
SUPMALE:You get them out.
LEADMALE:You're the man! ick! She's gone too far this time.
LEADMALE:Snakes bite and squeeze.
LEADMALE:Kathy's trying to kill us.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you talking about? Kathy isn't trying to kill you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We are.
LEADMALE:You put snakes in our bed? Well, you were saying how important this halloween stuff is to you.
SUPFEMALE:My babies! You've made your mother and me very happy.
LEADFEMALE:Now get rid of the snakes.
LEADMALE:I'll do it! D.j. don't touch those snakes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not untying them again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, our beautiful children remembered us on a holiday.
LEADMALE:God, bless us one and all.
LEADFEMALE:To think you had to worry about kathy.
LEADMALE:Yeah of course you know what this means, dan? She's still out there.
LEADMALE:Now all she has to do is pick up the box ha ha ha.
LEADMALE:It'll all be over in a couple of seconds.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you're doing this to your own wife.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not doing it, kathy is.
SUPMALE:When it's done roseanne'll sleep better.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:I'll sleep better.
SUPFEMALE:Life will be good-or at least normal.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have the kitten? I have the kitten.
LEADMALE:Meow.
LEADMALE:Meow.
OTHERMALE:Meow.
LEADMALE:Meow.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, there she is-ever vigilant, ever paranoid.
SUPFEMALE:She spots the bait realizing how lame the trick is how easy to detect waves of superiority wash over her.
LEADMALE:What now? One of two things.
OTHERFEMALE:Either she won't open the door or becky, it's for you.
OTHERMALE:Perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:She gets even for the snakes.
LEADMALE:Jeez, what do you guys do for thanksgiving around here? Oh, look a little kitty
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, who stole my bacon? Don't look at me.
SUPMALE:I don't eat meat anymore.
SUPMALE:Give it back, d.j. oh, mom, he licked it.
SUPMALE:I did not! It's slimy.
LEADMALE:Would you shut up? Your dad's in there trying to sleep! Now here, give me that bacon he licked, and i'll feed it to your dad.
LEADMALE:You know what to do.
SUPMALE:Pick d.j. up from school, take him to soccer practice, then pick me up at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Why not just buy me a chauffeur jacket and cap? That's all i ever hear from you.
LEADMALE:"i need new clothes.
OTHERFEMALE:Buy me a hat.
LEADFEMALE:Buy me a jacket.
SUPFEMALE:Me.
OTHERFEMALE:Me.
LEADMALE:Me.
SUPMALE:" i thought you were sleeping.
LEADMALE:And miss hearing my family scream at the top of their lungs in the morning? Well, you know, it's breakfast time, dan.
OTHERMALE:I did my best.
LEADMALE:You should be thankful nobody was hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Is this big pile of dirty clothes on the floor here for me? Oh, honey, and it's not even my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:It was late.
SUPFEMALE:I was tired.
LEADMALE:I was going to pick them up in the morning after a full four hours' sleep.
LEADMALE:Where's the towels? In the washer.
LEADMALE:Why are they in there? They're taking a ride.
LEADFEMALE:How am i supposed to take a shower? why do you wash all the towels at once? Just to tick you off.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Sign this.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like the towels are dirty.
OTHERFEMALE:When you shower, you're clean.
SUPMALE:The towels are just wet.
LEADFEMALE:Until it gets hairier than you are.
SUPMALE:Wait! What was that, your report card? Damn.
SUPFEMALE:Four cs and a "d.
OTHERMALE:" well, at least we know you're doing your best.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm just getting to know my teachers.
LEADFEMALE:I liked last year's excuse much better.
SUPMALE:Remember? "i can't concentrate in class 'cause of the asbestos.
LEADMALE:" what do you want, better grades or better excuses? With grades like that, you'll be able to operate any slurpee machine in this town.
LEADFEMALE:So what, am i grounded? No.
SUPMALE:Just go to school.
LEADFEMALE:Follow becky.
SUPMALE:She knows where it is.
OTHERMALE:You let her off mighty damn easy.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? You ought to start putting some pressure on that girl.
SUPMALE:Make her do more homework.
LEADMALE:I'll get right on that because i don't have enough to do.
LEADFEMALE:How long are you going to let this go on? Let's pretend like you're ever home.
OTHERMALE:What would you do? Don't start.
LEADMALE:I'm killing myself at that shop.
LEADMALE:I don't have a job, the restaurant, and the kids.
SUPFEMALE:You get eight hours' sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:That's why i'm so damn chipper in the morning.
LEADMALE:What is this about, roseanne--clothes, darlene, what? could you just take me to the restaurant? could you do that without us fighting? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I think i can manage that! fine! And don't use all the toilet paper either.
SUPFEMALE:That's our last roll! How long have you been here? Since hairy towels.
LEADFEMALE:That was a good one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, jackie, whatever you're here for, just go ahead, borrow it, eat it, use it, or wash it.
LEADMALE:I don't give a damn.
LEADMALE:Jeez, what a mood.
SUPMALE:I just need a thermos of coffee.
LEADMALE:Knock yourself out.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Have you got a thermos? It's on top of the fridge there.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Got to stay awake on the highway.
LEADMALE:Truckers' motto-stay awake.
SUPMALE:Do you want to talk about it? oh, god, jackie, don't you have some load of innocent chickens to drop off at the nugget factory or something? what's the deal? You guys have been fighting all the time lately.
LEADFEMALE:No, that isn't true.
OTHERFEMALE:We only fight when we see each other, which is hardly ever.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:It's just a combination of the fact that we are both exhausted and he's such a jerk! Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:It's arnie.
LEADMALE:What's he doing here so early in the morning? Perhaps he dropped by to have sex with you again.
LEADMALE:Look i made a mistake, o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? when are you going to drop it already? Oh, i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm just crazed.
LEADFEMALE:You better get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty soon he'll figure out where the door is.
LEADFEMALE:I got to go.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to get on the road anyway, but just take it easy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Is anybody going to get the door? Anybody's on her way.
LEADMALE:If you're going to make a big deal out of it-did i? Don't do me any favors! I know it's early, but i brought nancy with me so you'd let me in.
SUPMALE:Oh, what? You guys are together again, i see.
LEADFEMALE:Forever.
LEADFEMALE:It's official.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm settling for arnie.
SUPMALE:And we're getting hitched, and we wanted you guys to be the first to know.
LEADMALE:You come over here every couple of months, say you're going to get married, but you never do.
LEADMALE:This time it's for real.
LEADMALE:I said i wouldn't marry until i had money put away.
LEADMALE:Nancy's dad gave me $5,000 never to see her again.
LEADMALE:You are such a leech.
SUPMALE:Get off my back, you tramp.
OTHERMALE:You're worthless.
LEADMALE:You're easy.
OTHERFEMALE:I smell coffee.
LEADMALE:Come on, honey.
SUPMALE:He rules my world.
SUPMALE:That was a bad thing to see.
LEADFEMALE:So you're finally going to do it, huh? You got it.
LEADMALE:Just a small affair.
LEADMALE:We want you to be best man and best woman.
LEADFEMALE:You don't need a new dress.

OTHERMALE:Oh, wayne! If there was any possible way, we'd love to do it, but we just can't.
OTHERMALE:Aw, dan.
LEADMALE:Arnie, he said no.
SUPMALE:Sorry for barging in.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the coffee.
SUPMALE:It would be like a second honeymoon for you.
LEADMALE:Arnie! What? I don't think you should grovel.

SUPFEMALE:Are you ready to go to work? what? Well, thank you for answering for both of us, dan.

OTHERFEMALE:Rosie, tell me the truth, you saw that woman.
SUPMALE:My boob job's better than her boob job.
LEADFEMALE:You can't compare.
SUPFEMALE:It's apples and oranges.
LEADFEMALE:When i first decided to do this, arnie and i got into a huge fight.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to look like jamie lee curtis, and he wanted the adrienne barbeaus, but i didn't have enough skin.
SUPFEMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, look, we've done the buffet thing.
LEADMALE:We've done the gambling thing, the shopping thing.

SUPMALE:I think we're ready again.
OTHERFEMALE:Give me that.
SUPMALE:Do it again.
LEADFEMALE:Seven, red! all right! That third dessert's almost always a mistake.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you definitely got them rethinking the all-you-can-eat concept.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Seven! damn! You keep betting against me, and it's ticking me off.
LEADFEMALE:There's no rule against that.
LEADFEMALE:I can bet any way i want.
LEADFEMALE:But it's like a code.
LEADFEMALE:You don't bet against friends.
SUPMALE:You play your way, i play mine.
OTHERMALE:Now roll the dice! yo, 11! hell! Going to bet on me now? No.

LEADFEMALE:I'm having a real good time here.
LEADMALE:Oh, what, like you wouldn't have a good time with me alone up in the room? Whoo! ohh! If you want to, go back to the casino.
SUPFEMALE:Let's just do what we came up here to do.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you sweet talker, you.
SUPFEMALE:You got your stuff all over the place.
OTHERFEMALE:Where am i supposed to put my stuff, on the floor? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Pretend like you're home.
LEADMALE:Honey, there's something wrong with the towel racks.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:They got fresh, clean towels hanging all over them.
LEADFEMALE:We could have this very same argument back in lanford.
SUPFEMALE:You're the one that dragged us here.
OTHERMALE:When i started having fun, you dragged me away from it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we had a date.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:I thought i was more important than that stupid game.
LEADMALE:You are, but waiting wouldn't kill you.
LEADMALE:We came here to spend time together.
OTHERMALE:We haven't had five minutes alone since we got here! Well, now we're alone.
LEADMALE:I, for one, am having a great time.
SUPMALE:You know, dan, we should have took separate vacations.
LEADMALE:I go to vegas, and you go to hell.

LEADFEMALE:Now? Yeah, now.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, i'm hot.
LEADFEMALE:So am i.
SUPFEMALE:We haven't had five minutes alone since we got here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now we're alone.
SUPFEMALE:I, for one, am having a great time.
LEADMALE:You know, dan, we should have took separate vacations.
LEADMALE:I go to vegas.
OTHERFEMALE:You go to hell.
LEADMALE:Dan's beard hairs are all over the sink, and his underwear's hanging on the doorknob.
LEADFEMALE:He's griping about a couple of lipsticks taking up all his bathroom space, you know, like he owns the place.
LEADMALE:"this is my sink.
SUPFEMALE:This is my doorknob.
LEADFEMALE:" that's why men all the time miss the john, 'cause they're marking their territory.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Well, men are pigs.
OTHERMALE:That's not news.
SUPFEMALE:Double zero.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, double zero.
LEADMALE:That just about sums up my whole vacation.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you're ruining your whole trip.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you just go to dan and say "i'm sorry?" let me tell you something, nancy.
OTHERMALE:You do not stay married for 18 years by blurting out stupid little things like "i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:" i'm on a roll that's unbelievable, and she wants romance and it can't wait.
SUPMALE:She's yelling about underwear on doorknobs.
SUPMALE:She didn't want them on the floor or on me.
SUPMALE:Where do i put them? another card? Sure.
SUPMALE:Hit me.
LEADMALE:Why should you be any different? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:She yammered the luck right out of me.
SUPFEMALE:Better luck next time.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:No way i'm getting married again.
LEADMALE:Great news, dan.
LEADMALE:You got the wayne newton tickets! Good news, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't? Rosie's been waiting it's the main reason we came.
LEADMALE:It's not my fault.
LEADMALE:Wayne doesn't work on mondays.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't go yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:You said we'd get better tickets tonight.
LEADMALE:I can get us front row tickets tonight, but it won't be much fun without wayne.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADMALE:, so we don't see wayne.
OTHERMALE:Somehow she'll make this my fault, but i already left nose hairs in her sink.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't hang a man twice.
LEADMALE:I said i had good news.
LEADMALE:Four tickets to the las vegas legends in concert.
SUPFEMALE:The finest showbiz impersonators in the world.
LEADMALE:That's not so bad.
LEADFEMALE:If we saw wayne it would be over in a couple of hours.
SUPMALE:This i'll hear about the rest of my life.
LEADFEMALE:One thing.
LEADMALE:What? These tickets are free only for looking at time-share vacation condos.
LEADMALE:Let's go! Hit me--no, no.
LEADMALE:Kill me! See marriage is like gambling, you know.
LEADFEMALE:The odds are all in favor of the house.
LEADFEMALE:So, when your marriage breaks up make sure you keep the house.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i think you'd better eat something.
LEADMALE:And, you know, marriage is like this here slot machine.
SUPMALE:You don't always get back what you put into it, see.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:"honey i made your favorite dinner.
SUPMALE:" nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:"honey i let your favorite pants out another inch.
LEADFEMALE:" ha ha ha! Nothing.
OTHERMALE:"honey, i bore you three children, and i got that soap you like.
SUPFEMALE:" zip.
LEADFEMALE:This proves my point.
LEADMALE:Marriage stinks.
SUPFEMALE:With a capital "suck.
LEADMALE:" come on, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:Nancy, the longer i know you, the more i got to ask you-why are you marrying that guy? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I mean, he's not everything i deserve.
LEADFEMALE:So i think, uh, do you want to marry the guy? Then he did something the other day that really clinched it.
LEADFEMALE:He told me about that affair he had.
OTHERMALE:He did? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:And it's not like i caught him or anything.
LEADFEMALE:He just thought if we're going to be married, there shouldn't be any secrets.
SUPFEMALE:And that's when i knew i could really trust him.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe he told you.
SUPMALE:I was amazed.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy, you are really an incredible person.
LEADFEMALE:You've forgiven him and, man, i haven't even forgiven jackie yet.
SUPFEMALE:What has jackie got to do with it? you know, marriage is like-it--it was jackie? what was jackie? He told me some bimbo divorcee threw herself at him and he'd never see her again.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to kill him.
OTHERFEMALE:Men! If dan hadn't made me come to vegas none of this would have happened.
LEADFEMALE:So, danny, how's that complimentary drink treating you? You can't beat a big glass of tang with an umbrella.
LEADMALE:Man, i hope the girls don't get lost.
LEADMALE:Why? Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:It's going to be great.
SUPFEMALE:I was in the john, and i saw the guy that does paul anka.
SUPMALE:If you close your eyes, you'd swear it was him.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, wow! Legends in concert, huh, dan? Thank you so much for making this the perfect vacation.
LEADFEMALE:Right back at you, babe.
OTHERMALE:You're dead.
LEADMALE:She knows about jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, i'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:It was jackie harris.
SUPMALE:I know i'm a lying dog, but marry me.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you tell me before? why drag jackie into this? She's a nice person.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want you hating her because i made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie slept with arnie? Yuck! You're a pig.

SUPMALE:Oh, gee, that reminds me-stan becker called yesterday.
SUPMALE:He mentioned that.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, he's remodeling the pizza barn, his regular drywaller bailed on him, so he offered me a buttload of money to do the job.
LEADFEMALE:I said i don't do that anymore.
LEADFEMALE:He says he's heard it's slow at the shop, and he's in a bind.
LEADFEMALE:He made me promise to talk it over with you.
OTHERMALE:What do you think? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I kind of quit listening right after buttload of money.
LEADMALE:I'll feel like a total washout.
LEADMALE:Well, we do what we got to do, dan.
SUPFEMALE:If we didn't settle for less every so often, me and you would be married to other people.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I got to think about it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, don't do that.
SUPFEMALE:I'm serious.
LEADMALE:Grayson's the summer school king.
LEADFEMALE:You don't give him what he wants, you're looking at eight weeks in a moron steam bath.
SUPMALE:I don't know what he wants, becky.
OTHERFEMALE:It's easy.
SUPMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Columbus was looking for a new trade route to china.
LEADMALE:He found san salvador.
LEADFEMALE:And slaughtered, like, thousands of people.
SUPMALE:Well, you can throw that in, but don't make a big deal out of it.
SUPMALE:Look, darlene, if you want, i'll help you with your paper after dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are you doing this, becky? 'cause you're my sister.
LEADMALE:And because i don't want to support you after mom and dad are dead.
LEADFEMALE:Better get going, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to be late.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't you look cute.
SUPMALE:These overalls are all stiff and scratchy.
LEADMALE:That's 'cause we never washed them after your last job.
LEADFEMALE:Once you get a good sweat going, they'll loosen up.
LEADMALE:Now, you play nice with all those other little drywallers.
SUPMALE:There are no other drywallers, just me and a wall and failure.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, well, here's your lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for juggling your schedule at the mall so you could cover for me here.
LEADFEMALE:It's nice here.
SUPMALE:Nobody ever comes in and bothers me.
SUPMALE:What else you got, barney? how about a set of long-nose locking pliers? screwdriver kit? No, i don't want to mess around with lots of dinky parts.
LEADFEMALE:Dan's depressed.
LEADFEMALE:I need one thing that'll really cheer him up, like a great big, loud, shiny, grinding thing that cuts stuff up.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, or shoots stuff up in the air.
LEADMALE:Yeah, with a handle.
LEADFEMALE:You got anything like that? Oh, look at--here.
SUPFEMALE:"heavy-duty air hammer.

SUPMALE:It's all right.
LEADMALE:I can wait.

LEADFEMALE:See you, rosie.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, barney.
LEADMALE:Nice meeting you, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Thanks, barney.
LEADFEMALE:No cash, huh? Guess i can't do the grocery shopping.
LEADMALE:Ha ha.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not getting off that easy.
LEADMALE:Nope.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to also stop by the drugstore-here's the tickets-and pick up my photos from vegas.
LEADMALE:Anything else, mother? Yeah.
LEADMALE:If you get a second, dump that mark guy.
SUPMALE:So are you going to tell her? No.
LEADMALE:What? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Come on, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:If i'm going to court, i better get something dry cleaned.
LEADFEMALE:She got a "b" on her history paper.
LEADFEMALE:A "b"! all right, darlene! let me see! let me see! It's no big deal.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? It is so! it's a "b"! A "b.
LEADFEMALE:" a "b.
LEADMALE:" becky, go to the store and get a cake because we're going to have ourselves a party.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, what the hell.
LEADMALE:Get one that was baked today.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, stop it.
LEADMALE:This is a great thing.
LEADMALE:I'm thinking of hanging it up in the bathroom where your daddy can sit and admire it.
SUPMALE:A "b"! on the road to honor roll! This is all such a load.
SUPMALE:What's the matter? how come you're not happy? why would i be happy? Darlene, it was a good paper.
LEADFEMALE:Relax, o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:? i guess you'd know, wouldn't you? what's going on? Nothing.
SUPMALE:I just helped darlene with her paper a little.
LEADFEMALE:She wrote the whole thing.
LEADMALE:Have a party for her.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be in the car.
LEADMALE:You wrote it? well, yeah, but i-you only got a "b"? what'd you do that for? I was trying to help her.
LEADMALE:Aren't we all supposed to be helping darlene? That doesn't help her, becky.
LEADMALE:Darlene doesn't do anything.
OTHERMALE:If you do everything for her, she'll never come out of this.
LEADMALE:I kept her from flunking, mother.
LEADFEMALE:She conned you into doing it so she didn't have to.
OTHERFEMALE:Even d.j. could've seen that coming.
LEADMALE:That's really stupid, becky.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:I help her and get yelled at.
LEADMALE:It's so typical.
OTHERMALE:Don't give me that martyr crap.
LEADFEMALE:When did you ever buy me a cake for bringing home a decent grade or helping out d.j. or doing the laundry or any of the other million things i do while darlene sits around and sucks up all the attention? Brother.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, i really wanted that "b"! I know, i know, and you deserved it, roseanne.
SUPMALE:You worked hard for it.
LEADMALE:My life is crap.
LEADMALE:Now, things will turn around.
LEADMALE:You'll see.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene will be fine, and dan will be fine, and we'll buy becky a new power tool, and she'll be fine.
LEADMALE:Jackie, would you go across the street and get me a soda? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want, something diet? Oh, don't make it worse, jackie.

LEADFEMALE:Can you use it? you kidding? Can't build a quonset hut without one.
LEADMALE:Well, he said he'd take it back if you want.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:It's special to me.
LEADMALE:Oh, listen, one more thing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, what's up? are you smoking menthol or those charcoal tips? I'm not smoking.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, roseanne, your hair smells like smoke.
LEADFEMALE:People in the restaurant smoke.
LEADFEMALE:Your clothes smell.
LEADMALE:The toothpaste and the mouthwash? dentists say-how long? O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:Well i don't know.
OTHERMALE:Ever since i had to buy becky birth control pills.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since darlene turned into vegetable dip.
SUPMALE:Ever since you opened that shop.
SUPMALE:Ever since i have to work two jobs.
LEADMALE:It's just been a real sucky year, dan.
LEADFEMALE:It's either smoke or eat.
LEADFEMALE:You don't want me to gain back all the weight i lost.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Keep smoking.
LEADFEMALE:I like my women skinny and hawking up tar.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's not like you don't come home every night and have two or three beers.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, and it's not like you don't sit in the living room, watching tv, and pig out on garbage.
SUPMALE:No argument there.
OTHERFEMALE:Where do you get off being all high and mighty? I don't smoke.
LEADFEMALE:You taught me to.
LEADMALE:And made you quit.
LEADMALE:I'll quit again.
SUPFEMALE:When? I'll get back to you.
LEADMALE:When? I got to get through the holidays.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm also the one that came up with that excuse.
LEADMALE:I said i'm gonna quit! Why should i believe you? now you're calling me a liar? you been smoking secretly how many months now? Well, that doesn't make me a liar.
LEADMALE:Well, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What does it make you? Sneaky.
OTHERFEMALE:You did, too, order salami.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, you did.
OTHERFEMALE:Then why'd you take a big old bite out of it? Oh, she's doing much better, dan.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Eat it or wear it! Well, she's a little cranky, but i haven't let her have a cigarette all day long.
LEADMALE:Hey, no problem.
LEADFEMALE:She's my friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Just chat away while i run the whole damn restaurant by myself.
OTHERMALE:Look, i got to go.
SUPMALE:Check back with me later.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Oh, do you work here? oh, are you having another nicotine fit? Yeah, i guess so.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Give me a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I know it'll pass.
SUPMALE:Look, why don't you just relax? Tell you what, you make the coffee.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll take that table.
LEADMALE:Sure, hog all the tips.
LEADFEMALE:Afternoon.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's your uniform, roseanne? blblblt! Can i help you? Uh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Which is better, the tuna salad or egg salad? tuna salad, egg salad, chicken salad, turkey salad, shrimp salad-what difference does it make? It's all just different words for mayonnaise.
SUPMALE:Pick one.
LEADMALE:Excuse us.
SUPFEMALE:That certainly was an ugly little incident there, wasn't it, roseanne? I'm trying to quit smoking.
OTHERFEMALE:It's hard in the beginning.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know you smoked.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I quit nine years ago, but i had a rough year and started again.
LEADFEMALE:Now it's like i never quit.
OTHERMALE:Dan's ticked off-whoops.
LEADMALE:Whoops, i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:My fault.
OTHERMALE:I expressed an interest in your life.
SUPFEMALE:I had that coming.
OTHERMALE:What i meant to say, roseanne, is that this is a luncheonette, not the betty ford clinic.
OTHERFEMALE:Be psychotic on your own time.
SUPMALE:I'm on a break.
LEADFEMALE:Believe it or not, roseanne, you're going to be o.
SUPFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, this is worse than pms.
LEADMALE:With pms, it only lasts a couple of days, and it's way worse on everybody else than it is on me, o.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:? I know how you feel.
LEADMALE:I know you're my friend.
SUPFEMALE:Could you cover for me while i go to the bathroom? Sure, o.
LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see that purse.
LEADMALE:There's nothing in there.
OTHERMALE:Just let me look.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to look.
LEADFEMALE:Stay out of it.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you need your purse in the bathroom? It's none of your beeswax! O.
LEADMALE:K.
OTHERMALE:, i think it's time we all put our heads on our desk and had a little quiet time.
OTHERFEMALE:She won't let me go to the bathroom! Roseanne.
LEADMALE:She's got cigarettes in her purse.
SUPMALE:Roseanne goes to the bathroom.
SUPMALE:The purse stays here.
LEADMALE:Fine! I'll just get my coat.
LEADMALE:Roseanne darlene could you give me a hand folding these.
SUPMALE:Not my turn.
LEADMALE:I got to pick up d.j. at soccer practice and i still got two more loads.
LEADFEMALE:It's the least you can do.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:This is the least i could do.
LEADMALE:You are such an ass.
LEADMALE:I thought you weren't talking to me, becky.
LEADFEMALE:I help you with your paper, and you get me nailed for it.
SUPMALE:I apologized for that yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't ask for help.
OTHERMALE:You felt sorry for me.
OTHERMALE:I don't need your pity.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? You're begging for it.
SUPFEMALE:"oh, high school's too hard.
LEADFEMALE:My friends don't like me.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody understands me.
SUPFEMALE:" then do something about it, you little wimp.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:Beck you don't know what you're talking about.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course not, 'cause you're so complex, you're so deep.
SUPMALE:Well, that's crap.
OTHERMALE:You're just a whiny little basket case who's milking this depression thing for all it's worth.
LEADFEMALE:So here it is, and you get to do exactly what you want.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I got a zillion chores to do, or mom and dad will kick my butt.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, a bad day.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:A bad, bad day.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh, bad day.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:So go on, tell me what happened.
OTHERMALE:Oh, then i called leon a giant doody face, and he sent me home.
SUPMALE:Did you smoke? No, i didn't smoke.
LEADFEMALE:I did, however, eat 7,000 pickle chips.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for the warning, dear.
LEADFEMALE:I'm an obsessive-compulsive, addictive mess, dan.
LEADMALE:I can't do anything just a little bit.
LEADMALE:I find something i like, then totally overdo it, like smoking, eating thank god for birth control.
SUPFEMALE:Amen.
LEADMALE:I don't know if i can quit this time.
OTHERMALE:Last time, i had a really good reason.
OTHERFEMALE:I was pregnant with d.j. what reason do i have now? 'cause i love you.
LEADFEMALE:I want you with me a long time.
OTHERMALE:We're talking about me now, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to be wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I know, and you are.
SUPMALE:The problem's just me.
LEADFEMALE:I blame the kids, i blame money, but that's all bull.
LEADFEMALE:The problem's me.
SUPMALE:I'm just weak.
LEADMALE:That's why i married you-'cause you're so weak and frail.
LEADFEMALE:Don't mind me.
SUPMALE:I just came to get the hamper.
LEADMALE:Continue with your foreplay.
SUPMALE:Why are you getting the hamper? To do laundry.
LEADMALE:Isn't it becky's day? Yeah, well, i owe her one.
OTHERMALE:I owe her one, too, dan.
SUPMALE:Get off me.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? I put gas in the car, picked up d.j. from soccer practice.
LEADFEMALE:Now i'm doing nothing.
SUPMALE:Is that o.
SUPMALE:K.
SUPMALE:? Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Well i sure yelled at you yesterday, huh? For no reason.
LEADMALE:Well, for no good reason.
LEADMALE:You should've been yelling at darlene.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, i'd love to yell at darlene, but she'd just go up in her room and hide.
LEADFEMALE:I like yelling at you more 'cause you're fun.
LEADMALE:You yell back.
LEADMALE:I was trying to help.
SUPMALE:I know it.
SUPMALE:And you just gave me grief for it.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Well, you're always tiptoeing around darlene, you know? And nobody wants to upset her.
LEADMALE:So i do everything and get nothing.
LEADMALE:Youare right.
LEADFEMALE:So what do i get? you're just going to go right for it, aren't you? Well, it kind of feels like my moment.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do you want? I-i'd really like it if you'd invite mark to thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:You know, let him meet the family, kind of make it official.
LEADMALE:How about cash? Mother.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:, but he is neither to smoke nor to have sex with you in my house.
SUPMALE:Deal.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need cigarettes, man.
OTHERMALE:My kids will kill me.
LEADFEMALE:Do we have to watch this movie? It's a classic, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:How come they get to smoke and i don't? 'cause they didn't know anything in the thirties.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
SUPMALE:The men are all wearing hats.
LEADFEMALE:They're sure enjoying smoking them cigarettes, ain't they? Well, they're probably all dead now.
LEADMALE:So maybe the hats killed them.
SUPMALE:I want a cigarette.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Have another carrot.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:So how long's it been? Four days.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i just never really understood the whole addiction thing.
SUPMALE:When i had to quit, it was no big deal, and i never felt the urge to go back to it again.
OTHERMALE:Well, good for you! We shouldn't even be sitting here watching tv.
SUPFEMALE:Tv's the way my generation learned to smoke, anyhow.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:It's true, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Lucy smoked.
LEADFEMALE:Desi smoked.
SUPFEMALE:Ward smoked.

LEADFEMALE:And i don't know anything about electric bills.
LEADMALE:Do you know you're hey, i'm just a little kid, and you're scaring me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i'm just a little kid, and you're scaring me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, nice parenting, mother.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. 's gonna turn out more screwed up than the rest of us.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, by the time the third one comes along, you should have the hang of it.
LEADMALE:They want to call dad at work.
SUPMALE:No! Tell them he's not there.
LEADFEMALE:He's out trying to find you a new kidney.
SUPMALE:Just say you don't have the number.
LEADMALE:And hurry up.
LEADMALE:I'm waiting for a call from mark.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't got the number.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Bye.
SUPMALE:That a boy, deej.
LEADMALE:Can i go now? In a minute.
LEADMALE:Um i'm real sorry i made you lie.
LEADFEMALE:You know i wouldn't if i didn't have to.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
LEADMALE:'cause it's not cool to lie.
LEADMALE:You know that, right? I've told you that before.
LEADFEMALE:It's just, well, sometimes we have to lie in order to protect ourselves from all the evil people out there who seek to destroy us.
SUPMALE:Got it? Got it.
LEADFEMALE:Now can i go? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:You'd better get that.
SUPFEMALE:It might be those evil easter seal people.
LEADMALE:Hello? Oh, hi, mark.
SUPMALE:Yeah, becky's here.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go get her.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't i teach you anything? It was nothing like the boob job.
SUPFEMALE:They just sucked the fat out with a vacuum.
SUPMALE:How much did they suck out.
SUPMALE:Some.
LEADFEMALE:A lot? Enough.
SUPMALE:Did they have to change the bag? what is your point? It don't look no different.
LEADMALE:Well, sure.
LEADFEMALE:It's still swollen.
SUPFEMALE:God, nancy, why would you go torture yourself like that? I was so depressed when i got the separation papers from arnie, i just had to do something to make myself more desirable.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Guys just can't resist a chick with a hemorrhoid pillow.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Expecting a water landing, nance? Oh, that's it.
SUPMALE:I got to go soak.
SUPFEMALE:Way to go, dan.
LEADFEMALE:She just had surgery because of her low self-esteem.
OTHERMALE:You walk in here and kick her like a dog.
SUPMALE:Say something nice about her butt, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Very jaunty.
SUPMALE:Come on, nancy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll drive you home.
LEADFEMALE:This time i won't go over the railroad tracks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i keep misjudging it now.
LEADMALE:So how'd it go at the bank? Well, we chatted about the recession for a while, don't you know.
SUPMALE:Then i gave him my "things are bound to be better after the election" speech.
LEADMALE:Then they said, "you're 4 months behind on your first mortgage, "3 months behind on your second.
LEADMALE:We want our money by friday.
LEADMALE:And here, have a calendar.
LEADFEMALE:" look.
OTHERMALE:Kittens in a basket.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, i'm done with that manifold back there.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mark.
SUPFEMALE:So you want me to come in again tomorrow? I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, can you give me a rough idea when you might need me again? Well, the way things are going, here's your days off.
SUPMALE:That bad, huh? Look, things are pretty rocky right now.
LEADMALE:Why don't we take this on a day-to-day basis? Okay.
SUPMALE:If you need me, you know where to call.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, buddy.
LEADMALE:Okay, dan, so what are we gonna do? They want their money, babe.
SUPFEMALE:Well, tell them they can't have it! Can't we just give 'em the truck? We hate the truck.
LEADFEMALE:What will we live in, dear? oh, god, dan, they don't want the house? No, they don't want the house.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's a relief.
LEADMALE:No, they said they really don't want the house, but they'll take it.
LEADMALE:Turns out it's worth less than they loaned us for it.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of bank makes some stupid investment like that? Hey, we're taking our money elsewhere.
OTHERFEMALE:That was their suggestion.
LEADMALE:Well, so now what? You pour the gasoline, i'll light the match.
LEADMALE:Oh, damn.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, damn.
LEADMALE:I knew we shouldn't have gone into business for ourselves.
LEADFEMALE:There's nobody to steal from.
LEADMALE:Hey, i'm just a little kid and i'm all alone, and you're scaring me.
LEADFEMALE:Who was that? Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Where's your sister? Upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, get down here! What's going on? Family meeting, deej.
LEADFEMALE:All right, i'm going.
LEADMALE:What's up? Pull up a chair, beck.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:These are always bad news.
SUPMALE:What are you worried about, becky? how much worse could our lives suck than they already do now? Well, it's taken us a while, darlene, but i think we really hit the jackpot this time.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother and i have decided to close the bike shop.
SUPFEMALE:We're having a "going out of business" sale and then locking the doors on friday.
LEADMALE:And i don't have a job, so that means no income.
LEADMALE:How'd we do? what are we gonna do for money? Well, i'm gonna go back to dry-walling and maybe repair a couple of bikes out of the garage, and until things pick up, it's gonna be pretty tight around here.
LEADMALE:So it's just a real good thing that we never gave you anything, or this could come as a painful blow.
SUPMALE:Wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:What's gonna happen to mark? He's a good mechanic.
LEADFEMALE:He'll find something.
SUPMALE:You are gonna help him find another job, aren't you? I don't have a job and your mother doesn't have a job, but we'll make mark our first priority.
SUPMALE:How is he gonna pay the rent? He has an apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like you're back to making heel marks on the ceiling of his car, beck.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, dar.
SUPFEMALE:You know, beck, i don't know why, but i thought maybe the first words out of your mouth might be, "sorry you lost your business, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:We know how much it meant to you.
LEADMALE:" i guess it's gonna sound a lot less sincere now when i say it.
LEADMALE:This is great.
SUPMALE:This is just great.
LEADMALE:Hey! Let it go.
LEADFEMALE:It ain't worth it.
LEADMALE:So do you have anything that you want to say? can i have a pony? Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Mom? yeah? If you want it, i still have some birthday money i hid in my closet.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh.
OTHERMALE:No, you don't, but thanks anyway, deej.
LEADFEMALE:Mark? mm-hmm? how about that new garage on waukegan road? Come on, becky.
LEADFEMALE:No, i stopped there for gas, and it took a really long time for someone to come out.
LEADMALE:I think they might need somebody.
SUPMALE:Maybe it was self-serve.
LEADMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:We can talk more about this tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I got to go in.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't exactly the time to miss curfew.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:I did get one job offer.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Where? Rick called me today from minneapolis.
OTHERMALE:Yeah? Well, there's an opening where he works.
OTHERFEMALE:The job's mine if i want it.
LEADMALE:Well, do you want it? Well, it pays 3 times what i made working for your dad.
OTHERFEMALE:They'd let me join the union.
LEADMALE:I'd be set.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are you telling me this now? We've been together all afternoon.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I guess i just didn't know how to tell you.
SUPMALE:You knew how to tell me.
LEADFEMALE:You just wanted to get me in bed one last time before you dumped me.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? You just didn't want me mad at you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're always mad at me, and that's never stopped us before.
LEADMALE:Besides, i'm not dumping you.
SUPMALE:What do you call moving to minneapolis? It doesn't mean we have to break up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, think about it.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you're gonna out there, partying with your friends.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna meet somebody else, and i'm gonna be stuck down here spending my nights watching bonanza with dan and roseanne! no way! Hey, i didn't say i was gonna go.
SUPMALE:Look, if you don't want me to take the job, i won't take it.
SUPFEMALE:I can't tell you what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Don't go.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:I won't go.
OTHERMALE:You mean it? you won't? i said so, didn't i? Oh, i love you so much.
SUPFEMALE:Subtle, mom.
SUPMALE:Look, i got to go in.
SUPMALE:So what are you doing tomorrow? Guess i'm looking for a job.
LEADMALE:Well, i'll come with.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, everything's gonna be great, okay? Bye.
LEADFEMALE:These cereal bowls aren't gonna clean themselves, darlene.
LEADMALE:Did you hear me? darlene? Darlene! Mom wants you.
SUPFEMALE:Bite me.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPMALE:Somebody needs a hug! Just go away, okay? what's wrong with you? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just tired.
LEADMALE:No wonder.
LEADMALE:You were tossing and turning all night.
LEADMALE:What, do you watch me while i sleep? Yes, becky.
LEADMALE:You fascinate me.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes the drool on your pillow it isn't always yours.
SUPMALE:God, i hate you.
OTHERMALE:Just go to school.
SUPMALE:Aren't you gonna give me a ride? I'm not going.
SUPFEMALE:You'll have to get to detention by yourself today.
LEADFEMALE:You're cutting school? but you like high school, becky, remember? You're a geek.
SUPFEMALE:I'm helping mark find a job.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:I'll cut too and help him find his shoes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going along for the support, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know why you even bother.
SUPFEMALE:It's not like anybody's gonna hire the amazing idiot boy.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, the amazing idiot boy got offered a great job in minneapolis.
SUPMALE:Then why is he still looking? Because he decided to find something around lanford.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You mean, he had a chance to get out of this hole, and he's not? God, he just made king of the idiot boys.
OTHERFEMALE:He's doing it for me, okay? He said he'd stay if i wanted him to, and i said stay.
LEADMALE:Good boy, mark! Hey, maybe now you can train him not to drink out of the toilet.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't force him.
OTHERFEMALE:He asked me.
SUPMALE:Hey, relax, becky.
SUPFEMALE:It's not like i care.
LEADFEMALE:God, why in the hell do i talk to you? I know what i'm doing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, actually you're doing him a favor by keeping him here.
LEADFEMALE:Now when he fulfills his destiny as a big, fat loser, he'll have someone to blame.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:"mavis mcgowan, 64, "beloved wife of arthur, sister of helen, "of a heart attack tuesday morning.

SUPFEMALE:Didn't somebody get their head caught in an orange julius machine or something? Hang in there.
LEADMALE:We'll keep looking.

LEADMALE:Great day to go belly-up, isn't it? Boy, you're in good spirits.

Do you have any idea what we're going through? do you have any idea what i'm going through? today may be the last day i'll ever see mark again, okay? what are you talking about? He got a job offer in minneapolis, and i'm telling him to take it, and it's all 'cause of you.
SUPMALE:Excuse me? If you knew how to run a business, he'd still have a job and he wouldn't be leaving.
OTHERFEMALE:Now i don't have mark, i don't have college, i don't have anything! you blew it, dad! you blew it for everyone in this family! becky, you shut up! come on, mother! you know it! Everybody knows it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the only one with the guts to say it.
OTHERMALE:That is not true, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I would have the guts to say it.
LEADFEMALE:Attention, shoppers.
LEADMALE:Blue-light special.
LEADMALE:For the next 10 minutes, all fork braces are going for much less than they are now! How much for bumper hitches? Son, pick one out and we'll talk.
OTHERMALE:Look, man, you're closing up the place, right? now, do you think anybody's gonna walk in here in the next few hours and offer you this much cash for that bike? Nobody with your boyish charm.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:Sold.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, gil.
OTHERMALE:How you doin', buddy? Oh, worst day of my life, thanks.
LEADMALE:We all feel pretty bad about what you're going through.
LEADMALE:We just want you to let us know if there's anything we can do.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you know that guy that just left here, he's getting on his bike right now? His registration is way past due.
SUPMALE:Yeah? you want lights and sirens? how about something in a hail of gunfire? We'll see what we can do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, dan.
SUPMALE:Hey, crys, what are you doing down here? Oh, i just thought i'd come down, browse around, see if there's anything i need.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal, you don't have to do that.
OTHERFEMALE:This isn't charity, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I need this.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal, you don't need a bike seat.
LEADFEMALE:I really need this bike seat, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Now, how much do i owe you? $200.
LEADMALE:For that thing? Well, no wonder you're going out of business, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, roseanne, tell me you're employed.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, jackie, tell me you're married.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:What happened? What happened was that for 6 jobs.
LEADFEMALE:So i'm standing there for 3 hours drinking coffee just so some punk kid can ask me if i have any special skills.
SUPMALE:I told him, yeah, bladder control.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, crystal.
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hey they just love their new fork braces.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, they're at that age.
LEADMALE:So how's it going around here? Well, we are about out of business.
SUPMALE:So it's a success? how's dan taking it? Like a man.
SUPMALE:That bad, huh? Aw, come on, dan.
LEADMALE:Biggest day in the history of the shop, and the best i can do is not lose my house.
LEADMALE:The '90s.
LEADFEMALE:Who knew? This was my one shot.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you don't know that.
LEADMALE:Rose, this sucks.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing you can say is gonna make it any better.
OTHERMALE:So you just want to wallow for a while? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, then when you're done wallowing, we'll go home, and, well, i'll light some candles and put on some soft music, and then we'll slip into bed and i'll rub your feet and then i'll rub your back and then you know.
LEADMALE:Or we could go to lobo and get drunk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay! Lanford cycle.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i'll accept the charges.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, where are you? minnesota? what's she doing in minnesota? what's going on? what the hell are you talking about? what do you mean, you got married? Give me that phone.
SUPFEMALE:Becky! Mom mom, come on.
SUPFEMALE:So, uh, how'd it go? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Better than i expected.
LEADFEMALE:Becky! becky is this some kind of joke? If you're not really married, i'm gonna kill you! And if you are really married, i'm gonna kill you.
LEADFEMALE:Becky! becky! becky, this is the stupidest thing you've ever done! You get your butt back here right now, do you hear me? Okay, okay, okay.
LEADMALE:What i meant was, it's not too late to come home.
LEADFEMALE:We aren't mad at you.
SUPFEMALE:We just want to know you're safe.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky, are you listening? Talk to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky, i know you're there.
LEADFEMALE:I can hear you breathing.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Hi, becky.
OTHERMALE:Um, somethin' came in the mail for you today.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, why don't you open it and if it's anything important just call me back later, okay? Well, hang on.
SUPMALE:This'll just take a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry! Hey, becky, you got some really good coupons here.
LEADMALE:Here's 2 bucks off your dry cleaning.
LEADMALE:Free sprinkles on your yogurt cone.
SUPMALE:Listen, mom, why don't you keep that? are you sure, becky? I mean, this is a $5 value here.
LEADFEMALE:You could use 'em when you come down.
OTHERFEMALE:No, really, please.
LEADMALE:Take them, i want you to have them.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, okay then, suit yourself.
LEADMALE:Okay, see you later, bye.
LEADFEMALE:This has got to be some kind of a record.
LEADFEMALE:Not again, really? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Every single time i call over there.
LEADMALE:It's so romantic, all that passion, when you have to make love every minute of the day.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, look at how cute the family circus is today.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna have to call becky and tell her.
SUPFEMALE:Your ideas bite.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Your ideas bite, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:Your ideas bite, ma'am.
SUPMALE:What happened? didn't you sell any candy bars for the woodchucks? Not even one.
LEADMALE:Now i'll never win the prize.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to the umbrella? I stuck it in the door like you told me, but they slammed the door anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Then this dog came.
LEADFEMALE:We had a big tug-o-war and i fell back into a big puddle and some lady took a picture.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, gee, i'm sorry, honey, you know? but, well, money's kind of tight right now and if you're gonna go around selling a 50 cent nut cluster bar for 3 bucks you're gonna have to have an angle, you know? I think you need to be more pitiful.
SUPMALE:Do they know who your family is? Now go upstairs and dry up.
OTHERMALE:Hi, charlotte.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:I hope i'm not interrupting anything.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I just got this wife and mother thing going on.
LEADMALE:Boy, you're soaked.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Um, molly was supposed to leave the keys in my locker and she didn't, so i'm kinda locked out.
SUPMALE:Oh, gee, um, i used to have an extra key but i gave it back to your dad.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's okay.
SUPMALE:Well, thanks anyway.
SUPMALE:I'm just gonna go wait outside.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Okay, bye.
SUPMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Oh, charlotte? yes? is it still raining out there? Oh, yeah, hard.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay, bye.
LEADMALE:Bye! Hey, charlotte? yes? would you please get your butt back in this kitchen? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe that you actually were gonna go stand out there in the pouring rain instead of just asking if you could hang out here for a while.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i just didn't want to bother you.
SUPFEMALE:Is that meatloaf you're making? Yeah, well, we'll call it that.
LEADFEMALE:I always put extra yolks in mine, you know, it's my special recipe.
LEADMALE:You're 17, you shouldn't have a meatloaf recipe.
LEADFEMALE:Go get something pierced.
SUPMALE:You know, if you don't mind, i love to cook.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah? Well, so do i, butyou are the guest.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene, i'd like you to meet my new daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mom, don't make me share your love.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hi, come on in.
SUPMALE:Good thing you're here.
SUPMALE:We need a salad, too.
LEADFEMALE:Charlotte, there you are.
LEADMALE:Guess what? you forgot to leave the keys? I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I had to get in line for daisy chainsaw tickets.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you got them.
OTHERFEMALE:You did not.
LEADFEMALE:I did too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, those are like impossible to get.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't think there'd be any left.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, you and i actually like the same band? Yeah, well, you know.
LEADMALE:Don't spread it around.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, i've got a reputation too.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, and the cold sores to prove it.
OTHERFEMALE:Girls.
LEADMALE:What? I'm serious about that salad.
SUPMALE:Boy, you think you'd be nice to somebody with an extra ticket.
LEADFEMALE:You got an extra ticket? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Do you want to go? are they really, really good seats? Tenth row, center.
SUPFEMALE:I'm there.
LEADMALE:Ah, just a minute, where is this concert at? It's at the arena, in rockford.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Forget about it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not really gonna keep me from going, are you? I mean, come on, i'm 16 years old.
LEADMALE:Well, that was gonna be my point.
LEADMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Molly's dad is letting her go.
SUPFEMALE:Well, great.
LEADFEMALE:Then you've got somebody who'll bring you back a t-shirt.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is so unfair! Why don't you trust me? Because i've seen your work.
LEADMALE:I seem to remember a little incident last year with you sneaking off to chicago and me groundin' you untilwhat are you doin' out of your room? Well, that's 'cause i didn't tell you.
SUPMALE:This time i'm telling you.
LEADMALE:Look, i know your children haven't behaved perfectly in the past, but at some point you're gonna have to trust one of them.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Molly, you want to take d.j. to the concert? Oh, come on, i'm serious.
LEADMALE:And that chicago thing was over a year ago.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't cut school once since then.
LEADMALE:And with becky out of the house, i've had a lot more to do around here and i'm doing it.
OTHERMALE:I'm trying really hard and it doesn't seem to matter to you.
LEADFEMALE:And might i add, your hair looks particularly lovely today.
LEADFEMALE:One more word and you're not going.
LEADMALE:All right, yes! No, we have to check with your dad and make sure he says it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he will.
LEADFEMALE:You can convince him.
SUPMALE:Yeah, maybe i'll try that "particularly lovely hair" bit on him.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I can go.
LEADMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:I'll pay you half now and half when i actually see the band.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, charlotte.
LEADMALE:You wanted to go to that concert too, didn't you? No, not really.
LEADMALE:Well, i could still tell darlene that she can't go.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:It wouldn't be fair.
LEADMALE:Well, hey, i'm unreasonable all the time and darlene would never know the difference.
LEADFEMALE:No, really, i'm fine.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, if you're ever sittin' over there and you're lonely or something, you know, you're welcome to come over here and hang out any time.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:That's really nice, mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dan will be home in a couple of minutes.
SUPFEMALE:We better hurry and get that dinner done.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:No, becky, don't you get it? Marmaduke is too big for that small car.
LEADMALE:Well, sorry for botherin' ya.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Think she'd learn to take it off the hook by now.
OTHERFEMALE:That damn pooch.
SUPFEMALE:Woof! How many of those did d.j. soak you for? I haven't bought, i'm just browsing.
OTHERMALE:What time did we tell darlene to be home? After the concert.
SUPFEMALE:That's very vague, dear.
LEADMALE:Would that be a month after the concert? do i really have to go through this again with you, dan? Okay.
SUPMALE:The concert lets out at 11, i told her to come straight home, so she'll probably be here by midnight.
SUPMALE:It's an hour and a half drive from rockford.
SUPMALE:Not the way molly speeds.
LEADFEMALE:And, you know, after she's had a couple of drinks in her i'm serious, honey.
LEADMALE:I can't believe we let her go to that rock concert by herself.
LEADMALE:She's not by herself, dan, and she's 16.
OTHERFEMALE:We can't just lock her up.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey! we got a basement! Now, dan, come here.
LEADMALE:Darlene is out for the night.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. 's sleepin' at mom's.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing good on tv.
LEADFEMALE:Come over here.
LEADFEMALE:Why, miss conner, you're my boss.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we had a strictly professional relationship.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i just can't help myself, danny.
LEADMALE:Oo, the way you make my coffee, the way you walk out of a room.
LEADFEMALE:Oo, i know why you wear these skin-tight overalls.
LEADFEMALE:I'm beginning to think you didn't hire me for my typing skills.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold my calls.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, fix your face! Oh, hi, charlotte.
LEADMALE:Hey, roseanne, i'm sorry to bother you.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:What do you need? Um, i'm doing a book report for school and the library's closed and i noticed that you guys have encyclopedias.
LEADFEMALE:We do? yeah, dan, don't you remember? we got a through s and then we had to switch grocery stores? Right.
SUPMALE:Then we got shop-and-save's parade of presidents, but we had to stop at lincoln 'cause of that bad check thing.
SUPFEMALE:But if you need any bicentennial dishes, we have everything except for the salad plates.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's okay.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i'll just go.
LEADFEMALE:You sure? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Let's try somethin', charlotte.
LEADFEMALE:Right after i finish talking, then you say something back right away.
SUPFEMALE:My dad's working the night shift and molly's out with darlene, and i've never been alone in a new house before and, um, i made you some snacks.
SUPMALE:Well, you know i told you you could come over and hang out any time.
SUPMALE:You don't have to bring food every single time you come over here, just you is enough, got it? Yes.
LEADMALE:Oh no.
LEADFEMALE:Rice krispy treats.
LEADMALE:Over here! come on, molly! Let's go, it's getting late.
LEADMALE:So cute.
LEADMALE:Which one do you want? The one that'll kill you and stuff you into a trunk.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, will you lighten up? Look, i have a boyfriend, i don't need these jerks.
SUPMALE:Now, can we get out of here? It's been, like, an hour and a half.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's my car and i'm not ready to go.
SUPFEMALE:I'm still looking for the perfect guy, okay? Oh, it's a good thing we're in a parking lot full of drunken losers.
LEADFEMALE:Shouldn't be hard to spot that white horse.
LEADMALE:So, you guys comin' or what? Well, i'm definitely gonna go, but darlene here's kinda shy.
SUPMALE:Look, we don't have to go anywhere, i got a couple of joints in the van.
LEADMALE:Yeah, darlene, you look like a real partier.
LEADMALE:Any part of you that touches me, you're not getting back.
LEADMALE:I'm going without you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not standing in this parking lot alone.
OTHERMALE:Give me the keys and i'll drive home.
OTHERFEMALE:Let sean drive you home.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i'll drive you home.
OTHERMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:Look, just 15 minutes, i promise.
LEADMALE:So, darlene, do-just stop right there, ponyboy.
SUPMALE:You and the rest of your outsiders can go rumble someplace else.
LEADMALE:Look.
SUPMALE:I apologize for my friend.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, he's a real jerk.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's obviously a bad idea to go into somebody's van you hardly even know.
SUPMALE:So it's lucky for you i happen to have a couple of joints right here.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:I feel like i'm in the middle of a really bad after-school special.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, gil, they're in a blue '83 celica.
LEADFEMALE:It's darlene and another girl, molly tilden.
SUPFEMALE:No, we haven't been able to get in touch with her father yet.
OTHERFEMALE:What was molly wearing? Oh, uh, a black miniskirt.
SUPMALE:Black miniskirt.
OTHERFEMALE:And, uh, this half-shirt.
SUPFEMALE:A crop-top.
OTHERMALE:And, uh, a sweater she always wears when she goes out to get guys.
LEADFEMALE:Guy-gettin' sweater.
LEADFEMALE:Who the hell is she talkin' to? Well, gee, it's 4 in the morning, i think she's ordering a couple of things from spiegel catalog.
LEADMALE:Get her off the phone.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene could be trying to call through.
SUPFEMALE:Charlotte, go home and check your answering machine again.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I'm goin' back outside.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to stand in the middle of the street where the first thing she'll see when she pulls up is my head exploding.
LEADFEMALE:Gil gets accident reports from all the hospitals.
SUPFEMALE:He hasn't heard anything.
LEADFEMALE:God, where could they be? I'm gonna go out and drive around a little.
LEADMALE:I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:Car might have broken down.
OTHERMALE:They might have pulled off the road somewhere and could be wandering down some deserted highway looking for anybody to pick 'em up.
LEADMALE:I'll go look.
SUPFEMALE:Something happen? you hear something? No.
LEADFEMALE:Don't.
SUPFEMALE:You said, "let her go.
OTHERMALE:" i said don't.
OTHERMALE:She could be out there, god knows where, god knows what happened to her.
LEADMALE:This never would have happened if you would have listened to me.
LEADFEMALE:Go to no rock concert.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're right, dan, only middle-aged couples should go to rock concerts.
LEADMALE:You're not off the hook for this.
SUPMALE:You let her go all the way to rockford.
LEADFEMALE:You let her do whatever the hell she wants, and this time i don't even want to think about this time.
LEADMALE:So why don't you just go ahead and say it.
OTHERMALE:Go on, just say it.
LEADMALE:I'm a lousy mother, there, do you feel better? Yeah, maybe this time somethin' will happen to her and then you can be lord, god, king right.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, roseanne, that's exactly what i'm lookin' for.
SUPFEMALE:I want-don't even bother yelling at me because no matter how mad you are, you're nowhere near as mad as i am.
LEADMALE:Well, don't bet on it! Where in the hell have you been? Trying to get home.
SUPMALE:That skank woman molly left me stranded in the parking lot so she could jump in a van with some guys after the concert.
SUPMALE:I finally had to wave down a cab.
SUPFEMALE:I don't care what your story is.
SUPMALE:The rule is you call.
LEADFEMALE:It was a bad neighborhood.
LEADMALE:When i finally found a phone booth i got tired of waiting for the guy in it to finish peeing.
LEADMALE:Look, i know i should have called but i just wanted to get home.
SUPFEMALE:You expect us to believe that? Well, if you don't, just go ask the cab driver.
LEADMALE:He's waiting outside for his 75 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:The grocery money is on top of the fridge.
OTHERMALE:What were you doing talkin' to some guys in a van? It wasn't me, it was her.
LEADMALE:I told you that.
LEADMALE:Right, she deserted you.
LEADFEMALE:What, you don't believe that molly would desert me? why, because she's so sweet and cute and says,"please," and, "thank you, ma'am"? No.
LEADFEMALE:Because she doesn't have a history of lying to me like you do.
LEADMALE:That was charlotte, she just heard from molly.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you'll be relieved to know that right now you're in molly's car driving back with her and you'll be home safe in about an hour.
LEADFEMALE:I'll accept your apology over eggs and french toast in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Or, you know, you could just ground me and that'd be okay too.
OTHERFEMALE:Why does she buy this brand of waffles? I hate these waffles.
LEADMALE:Well, you know you could solve that problem by having breakfast in your own house.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, well, for a guy workin' the night shift you're up pretty early.
LEADMALE:Or awful late.
LEADMALE:Care for a nightcap? Yeah, in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:We, uh, got somethin' to clear up first, right? Come on, let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Um, i'm really sorry about last night, and i hope you're not mad at darlene for comin' home so late.
OTHERMALE:'cause it was all my fault.
SUPFEMALE:Apology accepted.
SUPFEMALE:We're just thankful everybody's okay.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go upstairs and apologize to darlene.
LEADMALE:Ah, man, daughters.
LEADMALE:They ought to come with a handbook.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so you can smack 'em with it.
LEADMALE:You know, dan, look at me.
SUPMALE:I'm workin' all the time.
OTHERMALE:These kids don't have a mother.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, it's gettin' tough.
LEADMALE:Charlotte, she's a dream, but molly, she's a real handful.
SUPFEMALE:Real handful.
OTHERFEMALE:That's one way of puttin' it.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm just really glad that guard let her go back to the building to get her purse.
OTHERMALE:I'm not sure darlene told me about that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, darlene got tired of waiting, so she left for home.
LEADMALE:And i tell you, i don't blame her, because if you go somewhere with molly, she always leaves something behind and it takes about a year for her to find it.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:A less trusting parent might think you could drive a van through the holes in that story.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, they don't know my daughter.
LEADMALE:I do.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i guess.
LEADMALE:Now listen, sometimes you gotta give your kids the benefit of the doubt.
LEADMALE:Nah, you give murderers the benefit of the doubt.
LEADFEMALE:These are your kids.
LEADMALE:Dan, i trust my kids and all i'm hopin' for is i raised 'em right, so they do right, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever works.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you go home and get some sleep? sleep? Ha ha.
LEADFEMALE:And i'll get started on that early grave for you.
LEADMALE:Do you believe that? That kid's got him totally snowed.
LEADMALE:Man.
SUPMALE:Makes you realize, there but for the grace of god goes well, some parent with good kids.
OTHERMALE:Well, we can't leave it like this.
SUPFEMALE:What are you gonna do? I know exactly what i'm gonna do.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie? Look, i can't believe you won't cover for me.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to get our stories straight.
SUPMALE:Okay, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:You were smoking pot in a guy's van while i was stranded in a dark parking lot in rockford.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, let's go tell your dad.
SUPMALE:Come on, my butt's on the line here.
SUPMALE:Won't you even listen to me? No, we spent enough time in life together, we're done now.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't tell your parents what really happened, did you? Most of it.
LEADMALE:My mom never would have bought that "i lost my purse" crap anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i don't know, try me, i'm not as good when i haven't slept.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, i'm really sorry about-no you're not! But you will be.
LEADMALE:Darlene, out! In a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I seem to have misplaced my purse here darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Out.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, molly.
SUPMALE:Look, i know what darlene told you.
LEADMALE:Let's just cut the crap, okay? You're talkin' to darlene's mother here, the mother of all mothers, and she is majorly mad! Now maybe your father's too busy to see what you're trying to get away with, but don't even waste that story on me.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't a story.
LEADFEMALE:Molly, molly, molly.
LEADFEMALE:I have raised two of the best damn liars in the free world.
SUPMALE:Don't embarrass yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you raggin' on me? 'cause that's what i do.
LEADMALE:I did it with becky, i do it with darlene, but doin' it with you is even more fun 'cause i can yell at you all i want and i don't have to buy you a car.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's right, 'cause you're not my mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Since i'm not your mother then, i'm not gonna tell you how stupid it is to get into some stranger's van and i'm also not gonna tell you how terrible things happen to stupid little girls like you every single day.
LEADMALE:I don't have to listen to this.
SUPMALE:Oh, but i think you do! Now, you want to screw up your life, i don't care.
LEADMALE:But when you leave this house with a conner kid, you're gonna be extra careful, 'cause darlene is one of the few things we own outright.
SUPFEMALE:I get it, okay? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Andyou are gonna pay me back for darlene's cab ride home.
LEADMALE:Yes, i'll pay you back.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're damn right you will, 'cause you're gonna work it off washing dishes at the diner, all 150 bucks of it.
OTHERMALE:Woof! that damn dog! Was that the last candy bar? Yeah, that's the last one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess maybe d.j. won that prize after all.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great, he sold them all? well, if that's the last one, where else would they go? did you eat any? Couple.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well i ate a couple.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene ate a couple.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie's having her period.
OTHERMALE:Well, i guess at 3 bucks a pop we bought d.j. a $60 woodchuck pencil case.
LEADFEMALE:Woof.
LEADMALE:Well, but hey, let's not waste that chocolate buzz.
SUPFEMALE:Woof.
SUPMALE:Can i help? Well, it's kind of a one-man job, deej.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you were playing video games.
LEADMALE:I was, but i can't move my fingers anymore.
SUPMALE:I got a tongue twister.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, pal, let's hear it.
SUPMALE:Six sick sheep-no, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Six sick sheik's sheep-no, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Six sick sheep-hey, deej, why don't you call a friend? I don't have any friends.
LEADMALE:Well, let's talk about this.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to the friends you made playing soccer last year? They wanted to shave my head and paint it black and white.
LEADMALE:Well, why don't we pick another sport? Go get the catalog from the parks department.
LEADMALE:Let's pick something we can both play.
SUPFEMALE:The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick.
LEADMALE:Hey, how 'bout hockey? Oh, hockey, it's, uh, it's cold, it's wet.
SUPMALE:There's all that skating.
OTHERFEMALE:You can skate, can't you? how 'bout wrestling? You know, the old man was almost a state champ back in high school.
OTHERFEMALE:Were you ever in a cage match? Only with your mom.
LEADFEMALE:How 'bout weight training? what's that? That's where you lift weights.
OTHERMALE:Then what? Then you--you put 'em back down again.
LEADFEMALE:How 'bout, uh, basketball? Nah.
LEADMALE:Bowling? boxing? handball? shot put? what else they got? Hey, here's something cool! tap dancing! Hockey it is.
LEADFEMALE:Have you seen d.j. ? He wanted me to drive him, and i'm gonna be late for school.
LEADMALE:Oh, he's still over at the skating rink learning how to play hockey with your dad.
SUPMALE:D.j. 's gonna play hockey? He can't even walk on land.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darlene, try to be a little more positive about it.
SUPMALE:Think about all the cute things we'll be able to write on his cast.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're right.
SUPMALE:Hockey could be his sport.
OTHERMALE:He's used to being chased by people with sticks.
OTHERMALE:Yo! We need a medic in here.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:D.j. dan, what happened? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:I had a little trouble coming out of my triple lutz when i tried to grab my skate behind my head.
OTHERMALE:Mom, i'm gonna be a professional hockey player.
LEADMALE:Great! We'll save all that money on toothpaste.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead up and change your clothes.
LEADMALE:He shoots, he scores! Man, i don't think there's an inch of that rink my butt didn't get to know intimately.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, well, we know you suck.
SUPFEMALE:How about d.j. ? well, you know how when they choose sides and some guy always gets picked last? D.j. would be right behind him.
LEADMALE:Well, can he at least skate? Yeah, he can skate.
LEADMALE:He just can't stop.
SUPMALE:Honey, i'm really hurting here.
LEADMALE:Can you give me a pillow and a heating pad? Yeah, sure.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, you had to do that big macho hockey stuff, huh? Couldn't take a little tap dancing.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad? huh? Tryouts are tomorrow morning at 5.
LEADFEMALE:I want to practice some before, so can we get there an hour early? Sure.
OTHERMALE:Come in! Hey, dan.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne around? I brought over some new menu designs.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:D.j. 's into hockey now, and i was just trying to teach him how to take a fall.
SUPFEMALE:He's a slow learner.
SUPMALE:You're kidding.
OTHERMALE:I was all-pee wee two years in a row.
LEADMALE:I probably got some stuff that'll fit him.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! Maybe i could even show him a few moves.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:He's got a tryout tomorrow morning at 5.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, maybe i shouldn't.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like a father/son kind of thing.
LEADMALE:Hey, fisher.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I got to go, so just give me a call.
LEADMALE:Let me know which one of these you like.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Better keep dan off his feet.
LEADMALE:That shouldn't be too hard.
LEADMALE:I'll just strap a pair of skates on him.
LEADFEMALE:Hit the bull's-eye, mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Come back.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa! Oh, you know, my body used to be able to take a hit.
LEADMALE:Play four quarters of football, still go out and party that night.
OTHERMALE:Well, i hate to be the one to break this to you, dan, but it's not like you've got the body of some greek god anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Now it's more like you got the body of, you know, some greek guy.
SUPFEMALE:Wow! These menus are great.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Fisher says he normally charges $200.
LEADFEMALE:What's he gonna charge us? Well, i told him he could marry jackie, and then we'd make up the difference.
LEADMALE:You know, i tried to get a hold of her last night.
LEADFEMALE:Have you seen her? No.
LEADFEMALE:She was supposed to come over to my house for dinner last night, but you know how some people are.
LEADFEMALE:They totally forget their family when a man gets involved.
LEADFEMALE:Something came up, okay? Oh, something came up.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure is fun working with sisters.
LEADMALE:Sorry, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Fisher and i needed to resolve some problems in our relationship, and then we broke up.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're kidding, right? No.
LEADMALE:That pig! How could he dump you? Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:No, this is gonna turn out to be the very best thing that's ever happened to you, trust me.
LEADMALE:Fisher has got nothing going.
OTHERMALE:He's just a kid.
LEADFEMALE:He's got nothing going on at all.
OTHERFEMALE:He didn't break up with me.
LEADMALE:I broke up with him.
LEADMALE:Are you out of your mind? why would you do that? He's the perfect guy for you.
SUPMALE:It was inevitable, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:We went to the lobo last weekend, and i went into the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:I came out, and he was talking to this woman who was, like, his own age.
LEADMALE:He's flirting, okay? So you cut him off for a couple of weeks.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:He wasn't flirting, roseanne.
SUPMALE:They were just talking, and then it hit me.
LEADFEMALE:They looked really right together.
LEADMALE:He and i are never gonna look that way.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you guys look really great together.
LEADMALE:You're so cute, i swear, it makes me want to retch, honest.
OTHERFEMALE:It's so obvious, and it's only a matter of time before he sees it, too, and dumps me for a younger woman, so i dumped him before he could dump me.
SUPMALE:See, if you're gonna go disqualify everyone that's gonna dump you, you're never gonna go out on a date again.
LEADFEMALE:I have had enough therapy to know when i'm in a self-destructive relationship.
LEADFEMALE:And since i can't break up with you, then i'm gonna deal with this one.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you're not even listening to me! No, you're not listening to me.
LEADMALE:If you can't support me, then stay out of it.
LEADMALE:Oh, that is so unfair.
OTHERMALE:You know i can't stay out of it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll support your mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I made the team! i'm an otter! i'm a fighting otter! all right, d.j. ! How about a sandwich for the newest otter? You go wash up.
LEADMALE:I'll make you one.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, the conner dynasty continues.
LEADMALE:I knew he had to have some of the old man in him.
LEADMALE:What, did they take everybody? Just the ones that showed up.
LEADFEMALE:Is he gonna get to play? Only if he brings a deck of cards.
LEADMALE:It's a lost cause.
OTHERFEMALE:It's too bad fisher had to get up at 4 in the morning to coach him.
LEADMALE:Fisher? What was fisher-no, never mind.
LEADMALE:I don't care.
LEADMALE:I don't want to know.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go get some cheese for d.j. what was that all about? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Under the category "failed relationships" for 200, the answer is "jackie and fisher.
LEADMALE:" roseanne, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't go through a breakup right now.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a bad time with d.j. and all.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, this time, it's gonna be different.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be the same as all the others.
LEADFEMALE:She's gonna fall apart, and then we have to put the pieces back together.
SUPFEMALE:How could he dump her right now when i'm at my most vulnerable? Brace yourself, dan-she dumped him.
LEADMALE:She dumped him? Wow.
LEADMALE:He didn't say anything about it at practice this morning.
SUPMALE:Well, that's 'cause he's a man.
LEADMALE:You know, he probably didn't want to ruin some precious hockey moment with some stupid outpouring of emotion.
LEADMALE:Here we go, d.j. , my little otter.
LEADFEMALE:Fighting otter.
LEADMALE:Fierce fighting otter.
LEADMALE:So how is hockey going? Great.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:And how is that coach of yours? you know, fisher? He's cool.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
OTHERFEMALE:Did he mention me? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What did he say? He said you guys went to a hockey game once.
LEADMALE:How did he say it? did he seem depressed? has he lost any weight? is he seeing someone else? Talk to me, d.j. mom! Okay, here's the pizza.
SUPFEMALE:How's jackie? She's calmed down a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Now she's just hysterical.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene, i need ice cream.
SUPFEMALE:What about the pizza? No, she's right past the chewy manic phase into the ice cream depression.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man.
OTHERMALE:How much longer is this gonna last? who knows? This may sound medieval, but there are still working convents.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you people.
LEADMALE:She's always gonna be there for us, and we are gonna be there for her for as long as it takes.
SUPMALE:Or until i can figure out how to get her the hell out of here.
SUPMALE:Here you go, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Your favorite-chocolate chocolate chip.
LEADFEMALE:Ahem.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you doing? Ha ha.
LEADFEMALE:Fisher liked ice cream.
SUPMALE:Well, that's a rare trait to find in a man, but there'll be other guys.
SUPMALE:I'm 37.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 37 years old.
LEADMALE:I had my first real date when i was 15.
OTHERMALE:That's 22 years' worth of dating.
LEADFEMALE:You'd think that in 22 years, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Right would have shown up.
LEADMALE:Well, he probably did, but you were out on a date with some reject.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's just a bad idea.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna call fisher.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? why aren't you stopping me? It's a local call.
LEADMALE:No matter what i do, you can't let me call fisher.
OTHERFEMALE:You're supposed to be my support! If fisher was here, he'd never let me pick up that phone.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, let's give him a call and find out.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I want to hear his side of it.
LEADMALE:What did he say when you broke up with him? Not much.
LEADMALE:I did all the talking.
LEADMALE:I just told him it was too intense.
SUPFEMALE:He was bringing me flowers all the time.
LEADMALE:He was calling me constantly.
LEADFEMALE:It was, "i love you, i love you, i love you.
SUPFEMALE:" that bastard.
SUPFEMALE:What else did you tell him? That's about it.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't tell him the real reason? why should i? I know what the problems are, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:He's too young for me.
LEADFEMALE:He's not ready to get married, and by the time he wants kids, all my eggs will be dried up.
LEADFEMALE:I really don't need to hear him agree with me, okay? Okay.
LEADMALE:No, it's just crazy.
LEADMALE:He's the right guy! i broke up with him for the wrong reasons! I'm gonna call him.
LEADFEMALE:You stink at this.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, deej, this is how they line up for face-off.
LEADMALE:Now, what position are you gonna play tonight? The coach said i'd be equally good at any position.
LEADFEMALE:You know, deej, it's not important how well you play or how much you play or even that you play at all.
LEADMALE:What is important? That's something you're gonna have to find out for yourself.
OTHERMALE:Hey, can we have the pizza in here? Yeah, okay.
LEADFEMALE:If i don't get it out there in 30 seconds, it's free.
LEADFEMALE:So, deej, you really want to know how to play hockey? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Say this guy's in front of you, and he's got the puck.
LEADFEMALE:What do you do? try and steal it from him? No.
LEADMALE:You do this.
LEADMALE:Any questions? Well, there's a lot of excitement here at the lanford arena as we enter the second period of the otters' home opener.
LEADFEMALE:The goalie is back from the restroom, and the action is resuming, and the cinderella story of the evening continues to be young d.j. conner on the ice, much to the surprise of his entire family.
LEADFEMALE:And oh, there's a breakaway! there's a breakaway! Young conner moves towards the goal.
LEADMALE:He shoots.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! he forgot the puck! And, roseanne, why don't you pick us up on the action? Okay, uh, there's a little kid-i don't know his name.
LEADFEMALE:He shoots the puck to this other little kid, and i don't know his name, either-okay, back to me! What's your take on the game, jackie? Back to me again.
SUPMALE:Hey, that kid's a maniac! get him off the ice! he's gonna hurt somebody! Wow.
LEADFEMALE:What a body check.
LEADMALE:Who would have thought the little runt would be a thug? Hey, it ain't his fault.
SUPFEMALE:It's that one kid that took the puck.
LEADFEMALE:Go over there and make sure he's all right.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go, deej.
LEADMALE:I got you nachos.
LEADMALE:I'll bring you a drink next penalty.
SUPFEMALE:You know, son, one more roughing call, you get the hat-trick.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? I came to see d.j. play.
LEADFEMALE:Is it all right if i sit down? Yeah, sure.
OTHERFEMALE:So how's d.j. doing? I don't see him out there.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he's in his office.
LEADMALE:Like he really cares.
LEADFEMALE:What's that supposed to mean? He just showed up here because he knew i'd be here.
SUPMALE:I can't reach you on the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to talk to you.
LEADMALE:This is totally unfair.
LEADFEMALE:You can't break up with someone without telling 'em why.
LEADFEMALE:Tell him why, jackie.
LEADMALE:I don't have nothing to say.
SUPMALE:And stay out of it for once, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:It's your life.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks the age difference is a problem.
LEADFEMALE:You know, she thinks there's a huge gap between 25 and 37.
SUPMALE:I thought you said you were 34.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now, see? This failure to communicate is maybe what's screwing up the relationship.
LEADMALE:Shut up, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you're doing.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I'm out of it.
SUPFEMALE:She don't think you want to get married.
LEADFEMALE:Don't-i didn't say that! Stop talking to him.
SUPFEMALE:You did too say that.
OTHERFEMALE:You said by the time he's ready to have kids, all your eggs is gonna be all dried up.
LEADMALE:Can i say something here? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you should let her finish, okay? She has a very important point to make, fisher.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, after all, you probably will dump her for some younger woman.
LEADMALE:Hold it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you thought that.
LEADFEMALE:As much fun as we have together, i never think of you being older than me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh you really mean that? Of course i mean it.
SUPMALE:I never said i didn't want to get married or have kids.
LEADMALE:We never even talked about it.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a real sensitive subject for me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this is crazy.
LEADMALE:Why don't we go someplace? We'll get some coffee and we'll talk about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i'd really like that.
SUPFEMALE:I was miserable without you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Will you take your squabbling elsewhere so i can see my kid play his last hockey game? Okay, but next time, stay out of it.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
SUPFEMALE:Where are they going? They're going to try to figure out how to thank me for saving their miserable lives.
LEADFEMALE:My hero.
SUPMALE:Hey, look, they're gonna let the little monster out of his cage.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. ! d.j. ! d.j. ! d.j. ! d.j. ! ooh! oh! oh! Where does a kid get that kind of hostility? did you see how hard i skated into that goalie? When i hit him, i heard something pop.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you never forget the first time you take somebody out.
SUPFEMALE:Lennie dillon.
LEADFEMALE:1964.
OTHERMALE:Collarbone.
LEADFEMALE:We still write.
SUPFEMALE:Hockey's great.
LEADFEMALE:You get to hurt guys and people clap.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know the whole point isn't to hurt somebody, don't you? Your mom's real worried that if you keep slamming into people, you're gonna break something.
SUPFEMALE:But it's fun.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it is, isn't it? Here's to the roughest, toughest otter of 'em all-the terminotter! Dad.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Can i have a taste of your beer? Nah, you're too young, deej.
SUPMALE:Just a sip? Nah, you wouldn't like it.
LEADMALE:Please? Okay, but just one.
OTHERMALE:Remember that.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne around? Yeah.
SUPMALE:She's in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt jackie, my knee's three different colors.
SUPMALE:That's great, hon.
LEADMALE:You must be really proud, dan.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, i've got something to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i hope it's good news, 'cause we're out of chocolate syrup.
OTHERMALE:I'm moving in with fisher.
LEADMALE:What? isn't it great? No, jackie, it's not great.
SUPFEMALE:Why? I thought you liked fisher.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i do, but you just barely broke up with him, and then the next second you're moving in with him? I know, it's a big step, but i really think it's the right thing to do.
LEADMALE:Well, don't you think it's just a tad bit completely insane? why can't you ever be supportive of what i'm doing? I'm waiting for you to do something right.
LEADMALE:Well, i just want you to be happy for me.
SUPMALE:Oh, okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Listen to this.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie's about to do something really, really stupid, but it doesn't really affect us, so i say we celebrate! I'm moving in with fisher.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean fisher can keep coaching me? Sure does.
LEADMALE:D.j. , have you been drinking? Come here.
SUPMALE:You go upstairs and brush your teeth.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dan, i guess you're just so damn proud of your kid out there ramming people and smashing into 'em that you just had to celebrate by giving him his very first sip of beer! I had to.
LEADMALE:The hooker made him nervous.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:You gave me my first sip of beer.
LEADFEMALE:That was different.
LEADFEMALE:I was drunk.
OTHERMALE:Well, dan, you're so very proud of your son ramming and smashing into people on the ice that you just couldn't wait to give him his very first sip of beer, could you? I had to.
LEADMALE:The hooker made him nervous.
LEADMALE:Dan! What? I can't feel anything on this side.
SUPMALE:What's going on?
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:I'm never shopping again on christmas eve.
LEADFEMALE:Is there anything even left on the shelves? Oh, tons.
LEADMALE:D.j. 's getting a thousand q-tips.
LEADMALE:No reason, just 'cause i love him.
OTHERMALE:Well, at least you got him something off his list.
SUPFEMALE:You know, mom, i was thinking, and i decided that i really don't want to be there to, you know, interrupt your reunion with becky and nana mary, and-forget about it, darlene.
LEADMALE:The entire family's got to be together tonight.
LEADFEMALE:And no matter how many blood tests i take to disprove it, you're a member of this family.
LEADMALE:I won't be that late, it's just that david's parents are leaving and he has to baby-sit his little sisters all alone.
SUPMALE:All alone on christmas eve.
SUPMALE:I'll give you five bucks.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna miss it's a wonderful life.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's on again at 9, and 9:30, and 11, and at midnight in spanish.
LEADMALE:"una vida wonderfulmente.
LEADFEMALE:" okay, but you be home by 8.
LEADMALE:And for every minute you're late, that's another time you've got to listen to it's a jim nabors christmas.
OTHERMALE:Hold it.
LEADMALE:What? Five bucks.
LEADFEMALE:This way she doesn't have to be wracked with guilt.
SUPMALE:Roseanne? what, are you gonna be late, too? No, i'm not coming at all.
LEADFEMALE:It's just, i-i'm sorry, but fisher and i are a new couple and we're just trying to develop some "us" time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god, that's totally gross.
OTHERMALE:That is your therapist talking.
LEADFEMALE:No, it couldn't be, because i stopped going to my therapist.
LEADFEMALE:Why? You can't be cured.
LEADFEMALE:Fisher says i don't need it anymore.
LEADMALE:He says i'm able to make my own decisions.
SUPMALE:Hey, i'll be the one to tell you when you're able to make your own decisions.
LEADMALE:Stop harping on my driving, mother.
SUPFEMALE:You pump the brake.
OTHERFEMALE:When there's ice and snow on the road, you pump the brake.
SUPFEMALE:I was pumping it.
LEADFEMALE:Pump this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Look, a freaking white christmas.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? Oh, enormous corns.
LEADMALE:Here, roseanne, take off my boots, please.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:So now, you have had these off in the last year, right? Look at that, completely dry.
LEADMALE:When i wear baggies on my feet, they're dry as a bone.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, here, feel my feet.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Aw, come on, feel my feet.
SUPMALE:Go on, jackie, you know you want to.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's dry.
LEADFEMALE:Baggies! I think i felt a corn.
LEADMALE:Come on, mother, let me show you the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i can't wait.
LEADMALE:"dear diary, what did i do today? Today i looked at a kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:" you're not leaving me alone with the judds tonight, jackie.
LEADMALE:Okay, deej, what does mom's card say we're supposed to do? "put turkey in oven.
SUPMALE:Turn oven on.
LEADMALE:Close oven door.
LEADMALE:" ready? I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:Let's do it.
OTHERMALE:Man, i hate cooking.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yoo-hoo! happy holidays! Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:How's it going? We're spent.
SUPMALE:Question, nance: is there any circumstance under which you would ice and then oil a potato? No.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, then that's slice and boil.
LEADMALE:D.j. , go wash your hands.
SUPFEMALE:You're smudging the cards.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you want me to put the gifts? Oh, in the living room.
LEADMALE:Did you guys bring your presents, too? Oh, that's okay.
SUPFEMALE:We already gave each other our gifts earlier.
SUPMALE:D.j. , would you, uh-hey, how about grabbing the rock salt, going out and salting the driveway? Okay.
LEADMALE:Could you guys cool it with the, ya know, giving each other presents in front of the kid? what? I got her some earrings and she gave me a sweater.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's what i meant.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want him to be jealous.
LEADMALE:It's cool, dan.
LEADMALE:I get it.
LEADFEMALE:We know how hard you've been trying to deal with all this, and i just want you to know that we really appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you know some guys wouldn't know who wants a beer? I'll get 'em.
LEADMALE:Hello? hey, beck, where are ya? Oh, no, you're kidding.
LEADMALE:I'm just glad you guys were smart enough to get off the road.
LEADMALE:Give me the number of the motel.
LEADFEMALE:No, yeah, i'll tell her you can't make it.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, we can just send the gifts to each other.
SUPFEMALE:'course, we were gonna get you that washer and dryer.
SUPFEMALE:And that speed boat, that'll be kind of hard to ship.
LEADMALE:You guys got one of those dancing beer cans? Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, we're gonna miss you, too.
SUPMALE:Yeah, bye.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey listen, beck, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Tell me about that apartment of yours.
LEADMALE:Yeah, no kidding? burned down? Boy, that's a shame.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan, you know becky could be here if she really wanted to.
LEADFEMALE:Did you tell her we're having stove top? Yeah, okay.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:What happened? Becky got snowed in in wisconsin.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:I don't think we're going anywhere, either.
SUPMALE:They haven't plowed yet, and the cars are buried.
SUPMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going out to the car and get our stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's times like these when people start looting.
SUPFEMALE:Beverly, come on.
SUPMALE:Slow down, mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, remember your age.
LEADFEMALE:You've got a daughter in a retirement home.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Had to make us stay and work late, didn't you? I hope you know you ruined my entire evening.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what about me? I wanted to be with my loved ones tonight and now i got stuck with you guys.
LEADMALE:Oh, i see what's going on.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to spend all night ragging on everybody and making them miserable.
SUPMALE:Sure, fun for you.
LEADMALE:What about the rest of us? what happened? apparently, i didn't move fast enough for her, so she shoved my-how'd you put it, mother? "my big butt"? Into a snowbank.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, where did you hide the scotch? what are you doing out of your room? We want to wait up and see santa.
LEADMALE:Well, come on over here, lisa and nicky, and i'll tell you a little christmas bedtime story.
LEADMALE:We like rudolph.
SUPFEMALE:Well, good for you.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, once upon a time, there were these two little girls, just like you guys.
SUPFEMALE:And they wanted to wait up all night to see santa claus.
LEADFEMALE:Did they see him? They sure did.
LEADMALE:And it was the most amazing thing they ever saw.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah, but it was also the last thing they ever saw.
OTHERMALE:Because, you know, i don't know if you guys know this, but santa's elves have orders to grab all the little children who try and catch a peek at santa and poke their eyes out.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you think they wear the pointy shoes? Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Oh, i love kids.
LEADFEMALE:The coast is clear for a little while.
LEADMALE:Can this be, you know, the night? I don't know, why don't we just see what happens? 'cause nothing ever does happen and it's frustrating as hell, darlene.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? What you want.
LEADMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:So what, now we can't even kiss unless i'm ready to go all the way? i don't know, why don't we just see what happens? what are you doing? Forget this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm outta here.
OTHERMALE:Fine, you want to go, go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, merry christmas.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you come out tonight can't you come out tonight buffalo girls, can't you come out tonight can't you come out tonight, can't you come out tonight all right, i'm back.
SUPFEMALE:Don't get excited.
SUPFEMALE:I basically chose you over death.
LEADMALE:By the light of the moon i don't care, darlene.
LEADMALE:There's no adult there, i want you to go home right now.
LEADMALE:C'mon, mom, you know i vowed never to use my teleportation powers for personal gain.
LEADMALE:Trust me, david and i are fighting.
SUPMALE:Nothing's gonna happen tonight.
LEADMALE:All right, damn it, but don't you stay up too late.
LEADMALE:Remember what i told you about santa's elves and their pointy shoes.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Well, it's beginning to look a lot like crap.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, if i gave you your presents now, would you shut up? Yay! presents! Bring me those bags.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
OTHERMALE:Wow, oh my god! This is awesome, it's some real expensive camera.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this, a portable phone! Wrong presents.
OTHERFEMALE:Crap.
OTHERFEMALE:These are for aunt sonia's kids.
SUPMALE:Here, yours are over there.
SUPMALE:Oh, wow, a salad spinner.
SUPMALE:And a cutting board in the shape of a rooster.
OTHERMALE:Well, i don't mean to sound ungrateful or anything, but these gifts suck.
OTHERFEMALE:Sonia's kids got all that really cool stuff.
LEADMALE:I thought we were you favorite grandkids.
LEADMALE:You are, you are.
LEADFEMALE:Eventually, eventually, i'm gonna have to go live with somebody.
LEADMALE:They got a pool.
SUPFEMALE:Well, just promise us that you'll linger long enough to be a huge burden.
LEADMALE:That reminds me! Last week i saw your dead grandpa marvin.
LEADFEMALE:He looked wonderful.
OTHERMALE:When do we get to open some presents? Oh, come on, deej, we made a deal: no opening presents until everyone gets here.
SUPMALE:Oh, dan you know, when i was a kid, my folks always let me open just one present early.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, i bet your folks loved you.
LEADMALE:All right, you little mooch.
SUPMALE:Yes! Just one.
SUPMALE:Clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Great, now i can invite all of my friends over to play with my bathrobe.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what, d.j. , let's open up our gift.
LEADMALE:I bet you're gonna like it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Cool, a remote control car! vroom! thank you! Right.
LEADMALE:Out of here.
SUPMALE:So, dan, where'd you stash the toys? in the closet or the garage? Neither.
LEADMALE:Those are toys.
LEADMALE:We wrapped them in clothes.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess it's tough raising a kid, huh? yeah, well, i guess that's something you won't have to worry about, huh? what does that mean? Well, you know, about having kids and all.
SUPMALE:I wanna have kids.
SUPMALE:You do? well, didn't you kinda ruin your chance, i mean, with arnie, you know? well, i don't think that was exactly the right situation to have a kid in, you know? yeah, who wants to shave the back of a six-month-old baby? I think it might be the right time now.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i know it's early in our relationship, but, you know, at some point i think marla and i could get pregnant and have a baby.
LEADMALE:Can you explain to me how you could do that without being at all specific? Sure, dan, it's easy.
SUPMALE:You just get some sperm-too specific.
LEADFEMALE:Here, you finish this.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on! You really think grandpa marvin would come all the way back from his grave just to ask nana where his brown slacks are? I think your nana's just plain losing it.
LEADFEMALE:All this talk about an afterlife is nonsense.
SUPFEMALE:When you're gone, you're gone.
LEADMALE:The end.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so, what? Next thing you know, you're going to tell me that you don't believe in god anymore neither.
SUPFEMALE:Well, is that a yes or a no? Well, i'm sorry, roseanne, but 25 years of your husband cheating tends to shake your faith.
LEADMALE:Man.
LEADMALE:You'd think somebody with a lousy life like yours would believe more.
SUPMALE:Can we just drop this, please? No, we can't just drop this.
LEADMALE:You think you're the only person that's been through stuff? I've been through stuff.
LEADMALE:But i still believe in god, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i'd like to believe that all the horrible, hideous crap that i have to wallow through every single day of my life, that at some point i will find out the meaning to and the reason for, i mean, so i can be happy, you know what i mean? There just is a god.
SUPFEMALE:There is.
LEADFEMALE:I swear to god there's a god.
LEADFEMALE:And if there ain't, i've been screwed.
OTHERMALE:Why are we talking about this? God and heaven and everything.
SUPFEMALE:It's christmas.
LEADFEMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPFEMALE:It's just another screwed-up day, the most screwed-up day this screwed-up family ever has.
LEADMALE:Everybody's everywhere doing everything.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody's doing anything together.
LEADMALE:And the only person that makes any effort at all to be with this family is grandpa marvin, and he's dead.
LEADMALE:Well, let's do something festive.
SUPMALE:Right, nana mary? nana mary? Oh my god, that would have been really spooky timing.
SUPFEMALE:I think we're scaring ourselves.
OTHERMALE:I suggest we try to get some sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I know how to get you back in the holiday spirit.
OTHERMALE:How? Let's decorate nana mary.
LEADMALE:We can't do that.
SUPFEMALE:She's our grandmother.
LEADMALE:Don't you remember-salad spinner.
LEADMALE:I'll get the tinsel.
SUPMALE:Girls! stop that, you're being stupid and childish! Everyone knows you string lights from the top.
LEADMALE:What's this? Bought it for you, you might as well open it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wow, these are, like, professional drawing pens.
SUPFEMALE:I can't keep these.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, a real animation cell.
SUPFEMALE:This must have cost a bundle.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:God, it's snowing like a banshee out there.
SUPFEMALE:Took me an hour to walk two blocks.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, mrs.
SUPMALE:Healy.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Wasn't expecting you here.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, i kinda got stuck here.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't mind if i sleep over.
LEADMALE:Well, isn't that convenient.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? Hi, dad, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She just got home.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:No, i was at work.
SUPFEMALE:Really? when did you call? Oh, well, i got finished early and i went to maggie's and i just got here.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing, checking up on me? Look, fine.
LEADMALE:You don't believe it? i'm sick of this, okay? how many times did your father call? He hasn't.
OTHERMALE:But aunt maggie called.
LEADMALE:She's been looking for you all night.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we all know she's full of it.
OTHERMALE:She doesn't know what she's talking about.
SUPMALE:Woman doesn't know what's happening one minute to the next.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, mom.
LEADFEMALE:What, you calling me a liar? No, i just said that she called.
SUPMALE:What the hell do you care? you really want to know what i was doing tonight? Because i will tell you.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up, mom.
LEADMALE:Don't you tell me to shut up, this is my house.
SUPFEMALE:Why'd you even come home? You apologize.
SUPMALE:You apologize to me! I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Telling me what to do when you've got your little girlfriend spending the night.
LEADFEMALE:Dragging conner trash over here.
LEADMALE:Another slut just like her sister.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, "slut" didn't bother me.
OTHERMALE:"just like her sister" part that hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Merry christmas! Merry christmas, george.
LEADMALE:Merry christmas, movie house! merry christmas, emporium! a tape! Mom, great.
LEADFEMALE:Those glorious hollywood musicals.
LEADMALE:I hope you don't have it.
LEADFEMALE:Not this volume.
LEADMALE:Good, i had an awful time finding it.
OTHERMALE:Isn't it funny that that one special gift you're looking for always happens to be at the very last car wash you go to? That explains my windshield compass.
LEADFEMALE:So, what time did nancy and marla leave? About an hour ago.
LEADMALE:After their sixth encounter under the mistletoe.
LEADMALE:Well, you know what they say, dan, every time lesbians kiss, another angel gets her wings.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
SUPMALE:Hey, everybody, how's it going? Hey, nana mary.
LEADMALE:Hello, darlene.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you get over here.
LEADMALE:We're opening presents.
SUPMALE:How was your night? Oh, it was okay.
LEADFEMALE:David and i made up.
LEADMALE:Oh, so, what, did you make up part of the way, or did you make up completely? No, mom, it was after mrs.
OTHERMALE:Healy got home.
LEADMALE:Good, at least you weren't there alone.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm gonna go upstairs.
LEADMALE:Will you save me some yams? I'll be right back down.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:See, mom? I told you there's a god.
LEADMALE:Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:Atta-boy, clarence.
LEADFEMALE:For auld lang syne 
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Darn! What's the matter, deej? This problem's impossible.
SUPFEMALE:I'm supposed to multiply and give the answer in base 2.
LEADMALE:You know, deej, it's ironic.
LEADMALE:You're a kid; you're not supposed to have any problems.
LEADFEMALE:You go to school and they give 'em to you.
LEADFEMALE:Either help me or be quiet so i can work.
LEADMALE:The answer is 3.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
LEADMALE:Okay, you little freak, you're about to see your heart.
LEADMALE:Rosie, rosie, a little help here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, back, back, back, back.
SUPMALE:You might think they're tame, but you gotta remember they're wild animals.
LEADFEMALE:The evil pinhead was in my room again.
OTHERFEMALE:I locked my door, but he must have gotten in through the bathroom.
LEADMALE:I didn't do anything.
LEADMALE:Cool, it worked! He put bath oil beads in my pockets so that when i sat down they'd break.
LEADFEMALE:I'm walking around school, everybody's pointing at my butt and laughing.
OTHERFEMALE:For a moment i knew the pain of being becky.
LEADFEMALE:I want him punished severely for this.
SUPMALE:Okay, bring me the cheese grater.
OTHERMALE:I'm serious, mom.
OTHERMALE:All right, all right, we'll ground him.
SUPMALE:Grounding him won't do no good.
LEADFEMALE:Alls he does is hang around the house anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, how 'bout a week with no video games? Honey, that would be perfect, but i'm on level eight of super froggy quest and he's gotta show me where the magic jewels are.
LEADMALE:These punishments bite.
LEADMALE:You guys call yourselves parents? You're supposed to be better at this.
OTHERFEMALE:So why don't you punish him? really? what do you think, dan? Bye, deej.
LEADMALE:Just remember, you're at that awkward age where you could be tried as an adult.
LEADMALE:I got it.
OTHERFEMALE:You have to wear a suit and tie to school tomorrow.
SUPMALE:In front of everyone? gee, darlene, why don't you just beat him up yourself? Don't like you, don't like you, don't like you.
LEADMALE:Suit and tie, i'm impressed.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i'm kinda proud of it.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, i woulda made him wear a dress.
LEADFEMALE:Too late.
LEADMALE:You only get one wish.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, can we close the shades? I feel real guilty playing in the daytime.
LEADMALE:Hey, this is the conner unemployment invitational.
OTHERFEMALE:I figure as long as we're all out of work, we might as well use our time productively.
LEADMALE:Well, this is stupid.
LEADMALE:Do i really have to do this? It's indian poker.
LEADMALE:Everybody can see your fifth card but you.
LEADMALE:How-so how do i know what to bet? Well, that's the challenge.
LEADMALE:It's not a game for the timid.
SUPMALE:I'll beta penny.
SUPFEMALE:Too rich for this guy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, my wife would kill me.
SUPMALE:I'm rich! i'm rich! I'm fabulously well off.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Now, who's been eating oreo cookies? Oh yeah, i had some of those yesterday.
LEADMALE:New game.
LEADMALE:So, how's the job front for you, fisher man? what, are you kidding? This is a rotten time to be a freelance artist.
LEADMALE:I'm down to working a couple days a week.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's a couple more than me.
LEADMALE:It's brutal out there.
SUPFEMALE:You guys are smart.
LEADFEMALE:Being self-employed is the only way to go.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bet an eighth of a cent.
OTHERMALE:Yeah? Being your own boss isn't that great of a deal.
SUPMALE:Last week i sexually harassed myself.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Well, i feel guilty.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you guys are scraping by.
LEADMALE:Here i got this great job.
LEADMALE:I got benefits.
LEADMALE:I'm even gettin' overtime.
SUPMALE:But of course, one false step and i could be crushed to death by heavy machinery.
SUPFEMALE:Three jacks, read 'em and weep.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody get the boy a hankie.
OTHERMALE:Full boat.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo, ooh ooh! damn it! My luck has totally turned to crap.
OTHERMALE:Hey, fisher, chill.
OTHERMALE:We're just playing for fun.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, i mean, this is just one more thing.
LEADMALE:I mean, no matter what i do, i can't catch a break.
LEADMALE:Here, now you're ahead for the night.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, go to hell! Sorry.
LEADMALE:I gotta take a breather.
LEADMALE:Well, he's wrapped kinda tight, huh? Poor guy.
LEADFEMALE:Remember when you were that age, you still thought your life was gonna amount to something? Yeah, i'm glad those days are over.
SUPMALE:Hello? Well, this could be one of d.j. conner's parents.
OTHERFEMALE:It depends on how much damage is involved.
LEADFEMALE:He did? Okay, yeah, i will.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:What's up? Oh, man, d.j. got caught with obscene reading material at school today.
SUPMALE:They want somebody to come down.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bet it was one of my playboys.
SUPMALE:Oh, man, i shoulda hid 'em better.
LEADFEMALE:So, where'd you hide 'em? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I can't find 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:No, dan, it's about time you handle some of these school problems.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, dan, i know you're very involved in your children's education.
SUPFEMALE:James madison elementary school.
OTHERMALE:It's on the corner of carpenter and fifth.
SUPMALE:And d.j. is the short kid with dark hair.
LEADMALE:What kind of obscene reading material could d.j. have? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Either one of dan's playboys or our credit report.
SUPMALE:So, charlotte, how are you at talking to people? Well oh, good enough.
LEADFEMALE:Go take their order.
OTHERFEMALE:Uhi think that my work-study program at school, you know, doesn't allow me to speak to people from my own school.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i think it's kinda like a rule.
LEADMALE:Which one of them do you have the crush on? They're both kinda cute.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're in luck because they're friends with becky, so i can introduce you.
LEADMALE:No, i don't want to be introduced.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, charlotte, i know how it is.
OTHERMALE:I'm shy, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, please, please don't embarrass me.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't do that.
LEADMALE:Sohow far do you go on a first date? Just kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how you doin', guys? Hey, mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:So, what's a couple of good-lookin' studs like yourself doing out on the town with no dates? It's 1:00.
OTHERMALE:We're on lunch period.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know, guys like you should just have no trouble finding women at all.
SUPFEMALE:Instead of chasing after all these cheerleader types, you ought to think about dating somebody that'smore mature.
SUPMALE:Thanks for the advice, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, because sometimes you don't really realize it, but there are people right under your nose who would love to go out with you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I think i got it now.
LEADFEMALE:Warmed 'em up for you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for rescuing us.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i mean, i like mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, but not in that way.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, jackie, i'm feeling kinda kooky.
SUPMALE:What do you say me and you go bowling tonight? Hey, on wednesday night they'll let you eat right in the bowling area.
LEADMALE:Can't.
OTHERFEMALE:Fisher and i are doing something tonight.
SUPMALE:Well, so are me and dan probably, but that doesn't mean we can't go bowling first.
LEADFEMALE:You and i work together, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that enough? God, this really sucks.
LEADMALE:Every time i ask you to do anything you're always busy with fisher.
SUPFEMALE:Don't do this to me.
LEADMALE:You know i have a boyfriend now.
LEADFEMALE:It takes up a lot of my time.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, when i was first dating dan and things were all hot and heavy still, i'd always make time for you.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, when you wanted a ride somewhere, wanted somebody to get you pizza, wanted somebody to do your homework.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least i made time.
SUPFEMALE:Well this takes a little more effort than a high school romance.
LEADMALE:You know, i live with fisher, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Well, so maybe that's your problem.
LEADMALE:Maybe you and fisher spend too much time together.
SUPFEMALE:I never would have moved in with no guy so damn fast.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you wouldn't, but this isn't you; it's me.
SUPMALE:And there's a real easy way to tell us apart.
OTHERFEMALE:You.
OTHERFEMALE:Me.
LEADMALE:You.
SUPFEMALE:Me.
LEADFEMALE:Where the hell do you think you're going? We're in the middle of a shift here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm leavin'! Till you respect my relationships, you're not gonna see me again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, i didn't realize it's such a drag spending any time with me.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna ask you no more.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Go for the guilt.
LEADMALE:You better take a long, hard look at yourself, roseanne, 'cause if you are this obsessed with my life, there is obviously something missing from yours.
LEADFEMALE:Just figure that out? Deja vu.
OTHERMALE:I am really angry with you, d.j. those magazines are not for you to read.
LEADFEMALE:And you know it's wrong to go through other people's things.
LEADMALE:You are in big trouble when i get you home, pal.
LEADFEMALE:Can i help you? Yeah, i'm here to see principal alexander.
OTHERFEMALE:And you are? Dan conner, d.j. 's father.
LEADFEMALE:No, he's not.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know who he is.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let me go home with him! He's kidding.
SUPMALE:Tell the nice lady you're kidding, deej.
SUPMALE:How do you know my name? D.j. ! He's my dad.
OTHERMALE:You know, in all the years conner children have come to this school, we've never seen you.
LEADFEMALE:We all assumed mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner was widowed.
LEADMALE:She is.
LEADMALE:I'm her oldest boy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, our principal.
LEADMALE:Cecil alexander, dan conner, d.j. 's father.
LEADMALE:We thought you were dead.
SUPMALE:Come in, mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:D.j. ? Listen, i want you to know we're usually very happy with d.j. he's a hard worker, he listens well in class.
LEADMALE:Although this new dressing up phase does concern us a little.
LEADMALE:Kids.
LEADMALE:But we don't discourage unorthodox dress here.
SUPFEMALE:We do discourage, however, our students from bringing certain types of reading material to school.
LEADMALE:Well, i understand, cecil.
LEADFEMALE:Something that might be perfectly normal and acceptable for adults wouldn't be okay for kids to bring to school.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but the filth that d.j. was reading couldn't possibly be considered okay anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:It's the most offensively sick piece of garbage i've ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you read the articles? I didn't see any articles in this.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a comic book.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , you brought a comic book to school.
LEADFEMALE:Good boy! I can see i should have spoken to his mother.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look, i know it's wrong for kids to bring comics to school and read 'em in class, but hey, they're kids.
SUPMALE:I know it's not great literature-my god.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of diseased mind could create something like this? It's obviously some sort of cheap underground thing.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:Hey, i don't know where d.j. got this, but you can be sure we don't allow things like this in our house.
LEADMALE:This is not the way we raise our children.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you get this? Darlene made it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, dan, my day dealing with the family was an ice cream cone in the dirt.
LEADFEMALE:How was yours? Well, honey, i hate to top you, but i got a two-for-one.
LEADFEMALE:That obscene reading material d.j. brought to school? Darlene's the editorin-chief.
LEADMALE:Take a look at this.
SUPFEMALE:It's really sick.
LEADFEMALE:It was a funny part.
SUPMALE:I'm serious, rosie.
LEADMALE:What if darlene's disturbed? More than we thought.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan, have you seen some of the comic books that she buys lately? They're way more screwed up than that.
SUPFEMALE:Warped and depressing is what's cool now.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Finally darlene's personality pays off.
LEADMALE:Hey, we had underground comics, but it wasn't like this crap darlene's doing.
LEADMALE:Ours were about depraved sex and massive drug abuse.
LEADFEMALE:This is a cry for help.
OTHERMALE:Well, who knows what they're about, you know? who even wants to? The longer we don't know what's in darlene's head, the longer we don't sleep in shifts.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, hold it right there.
LEADMALE:You were very, very mean to me and hurt my feelings today and i'm not sure that i even want to talk to you yet.
LEADMALE:I came here to apologize.
LEADMALE:I have been blowing you off a lot lately and there's no excuse for it.
LEADMALE:I'm a selfish, rotten person and i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Is that it? Roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Oh, all right, i'm such a softy.
LEADFEMALE:And to make up for being such a jerk, i wanna take you to a movie.
LEADMALE:Just you and me.
SUPFEMALE:My treat.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, well, you'll have to go put on a better shirt.
LEADMALE:Why? We're going to a movie.
LEADFEMALE:No, you feel way worse than that.
LEADMALE:You're taking me out to dinner, too.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:You think darlene would mind if i went upstairs and borrowed something? No, as long as you put everything back on the floor where you find it.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:What's my comic book doing down here? D.j. got caught with it at school today.
SUPFEMALE:We have to talk.
LEADMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:Hire a hearse, pick out a plot.
LEADMALE:D.j. ! It's over, rat boy.
SUPMALE:Close the door.
LEADMALE:Close the door! What happened to aunt jackie? Well, some say environment, but i think she's born that way.
OTHERFEMALE:No, i mean was she, like, in an accident or something? No.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Well, i saw her upstairs and her back's all bruised up.
SUPFEMALE:She didn't tell me nothing about it.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry for yelling at you like that, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:You scared the heck outta me.
LEADFEMALE:Are you okay? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You ready to go? Come here.
LEADFEMALE:What? Darlene says your back's all bruised up.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:It's nothin'.
LEADMALE:Well then, let me see.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! Come on, stand still.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Now, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i'm all right, so don't go blowing this up into something it's not, okay? what happened? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Let's go eat.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:We're not gonna go anywhere till you tell me how your back got all bruised.
LEADMALE:I told you i'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:You come over here, your back is all bruised up, you won't tell me nothin' about it, how do i know you didn't get raped or mugged or something? does fisher know about this? why--why can't you just drop it? That son of a bitch.
LEADFEMALE:You don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:He beat the crap-no, he didn't.
LEADMALE:It's no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:It's no big deal? what are you saying? He hit you; it's not like he forgot your birthday.
LEADFEMALE:We had an argument this afternoon and he pushed me a couple times.
OTHERMALE:It's not fisher's fault.
LEADFEMALE:Then whose fault is it? I--i can't believe that you're saying this.
SUPFEMALE:You don't even listen to me.
SUPMALE:He said he was sorry and it would never happen again.
LEADMALE:Damn, jackie, you were a cop.
LEADFEMALE:You heard this same crap a million times.
LEADFEMALE:Now you're throwin' it out on me? how could you let this happen to you? Shut up! You don't know the whole story.
SUPMALE:He's been under a lot of pressure lately.
SUPMALE:There's no work.
LEADFEMALE:And i told him that he should look for a job at a bigger company, and he told me that i didn't believe in him, and he told me a million times when he gets in a mood like that that i should just walk away and i didn't.
SUPFEMALE:I just kept pushing him and pushing him.
LEADMALE:Don't say any more.
LEADMALE:What happened? Fisher beat the crap out of her.
LEADMALE:What? I'm all right.
LEADMALE:I just-i-i don't want anybody to know about it.
OTHERMALE:Is she really okay? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, come on.
SUPMALE:We're gonna go wash your face.
LEADFEMALE:How you doin'? Pretty good.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i think we just should go to the hospital and get you checked out.
LEADFEMALE:It's too humiliating, roseanne.
LEADMALE:They'll ask all kinds of questions.
LEADMALE:I don't want everybody talking about it.
SUPMALE:Okay, well, we'll go to the hospital in elgin.
OTHERMALE:Nobody knows us there.
LEADFEMALE:We could make up names and stuff.
SUPMALE:I'll be wilma and you can be betty.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Where'd you go? I thought i'd go get some dinner.
LEADMALE:I got your favorite.
SUPMALE:I told 'em to just fry up the skin, none of that pesky chicken to get in the way.
LEADFEMALE:So we'll eat some of it in the car on the way to the hospital.
LEADMALE:Roseanne.
SUPMALE:Come on, let's go get ready.
LEADFEMALE:So did you see fisher? Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:You didn't kill him and then go buy chicken, did ya? No, i bought the chicken first.
SUPMALE:I thought you were just gonna go over there and scare him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it started out that way.
LEADMALE:What did he say? Well, if i remember correctly, "ouch, ouch, my head.
LEADMALE:" something along those lines.
LEADMALE:Dan, you gotta put some alcohol on that.
LEADMALE:Good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, rosie, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Can we come in? Well, that depends on what you're here for.
OTHERMALE:Let 'em in, honey.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, we have a warrant for your arrest.
LEADMALE:There's been an assault and battery complaint filed on you.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i heard the call come in on the radio, so i just told dispatch that we'd take it.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, rosie.
SUPFEMALE:You can't arrest dan.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't do anything wrong.
LEADMALE:Jackie came over here-roseanne, this is about me.
SUPFEMALE:It's not about anybody else.
SUPMALE:Let's leave it at that.
LEADMALE:Rosie, what you need to do is get to the station as quick as you can with the bail.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be about a hundred bucks.
SUPFEMALE:We'll stall processing dan as long as we can.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, but we gotta cuff you.
SUPFEMALE:No cuffs.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, cuff me.
OTHERFEMALE:You get fired, who's gonna fix my parking tickets? well, can he at least have some chicken? He hasn't had dinner yet.
LEADMALE:All right, i'll drive.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, can you get one of these for a regular car? It would make trips with the kids a lot more fun.
SUPFEMALE:It's funny.
LEADFEMALE:Joanie and i were just today talking about getting together with you and rosie.
SUPFEMALE:When's good for you? I'm busy tonight, but other than that, i'm cool.
SUPMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty weird, huh? Mind-blowing.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, if you don't mind my asking, how come you popped that guy? You messed him up pretty good, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:A long story.
LEADMALE:Understood.
SUPMALE:Look, it's not gonna be so bad.
SUPFEMALE:By the time we finish processing you, rosie will be there with the bail.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody's gotta know about this.
SUPFEMALE:Appreciate it.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:D.j. ] mom! Mom, you have to sign my math test.
SUPFEMALE:No, not right now, d.j. she said by tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:God! Hasn't darlene taught you to forge my signature yet? Okay, there.
LEADMALE:I got a d.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you tried your best.
LEADMALE:Jeez, i'm sorry, okay? It was one time.
LEADMALE:Gimme a break.
OTHERMALE:D.j. , i gotta drive aunt jackie somewhere.
LEADMALE:So i want you to go next door over to the tildens' and stay there, and then when i get back, if you want, i'll yell at you, okay? Okay.
LEADMALE:Darlene! This is weird.
LEADFEMALE:I hate going to the emergency room.
LEADMALE:It reminds me of the pussy willow.
SUPMALE:Remember the pussy willow, roseanne? All i said was i wondered if it could fit up your nose.
LEADMALE:You're the one that crammed it up there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was still a really mean thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:I tried to get it out, didn't i? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But you used a stick.
LEADFEMALE:Is everything okay? jackie, could you go start the car? I've gotta get my coat.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Here, take this chicken, too.
LEADMALE:We got barbeque sauce in the glove box.
SUPMALE:What's going on? I'm taking aunt jackie to the hospital.
SUPMALE:Fisher hit her, didn't he? I'm not supposed to tell you that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he did.
OTHERMALE:And now i need you to do me a favor.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Okaywe need milk.
LEADMALE:And on your way, could you swing by the jail and bail out your dad? what? True grit.
SUPFEMALE:Huh? Here, man, you can have it.
OTHERFEMALE:I was just-i don't want any problems.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan.
SUPMALE:Sorry it took so long.
LEADMALE:They didn't have any curly fries, so i just got the regular.
LEADFEMALE:Hope that's okay.
SUPMALE:Thanks, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, everybody feels pretty bad about you, uh having to be in here and all.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:I appreciate the extra care you showed when you frisked me.
OTHERMALE:Someone's here, dan.
SUPMALE:Says they know you.
OTHERFEMALE:Finally.
OTHERMALE:I'll go get started on the paperwork.
LEADMALE:Well, well, well.
LEADMALE:Oh, man! My, my, my, my, my.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? You know, i'll bet when you imagined us in this situation, you always pictured yourself on the other side of those bars.
LEADMALE:Where's your mom? Organizing the candlelight vigil.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, darlene.
LEADMALE:I don't have time for this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i think you do.
OTHERMALE:She took aunt jackie to the hospital, so i'm here to post bail.
LEADFEMALE:But i'm a minor, so that means i have to give the money to the suspect which i guess would be you.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the money.
LEADFEMALE:All right, but i want you to know it's coming out of your allowance.
OTHERFEMALE:Now! Prison's hardened you.
SUPMALE:Okay, now get in there and tell ray to let me out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:By the way, dad, i think it was a really cool thing that you did.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess i should prepare you for all the things that have changed since you've been in the big house.
LEADFEMALE:Mom says we have a new daddy now.
OTHERFEMALE:Morning.
LEADFEMALE:Where is everybody? Mom went to the supermarket and jackie's still sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:The doctor gave her something to knock her out.
SUPMALE:What about d.j. ? I tried, but he wouldn't swallow the pill.
SUPFEMALE:Yoo-hoo! Hey, crystal.
OTHERMALE:I came over as soon as i heard the news.
SUPFEMALE:For my favorite inmate.
LEADMALE:It's a cupcake with a nail file baked in it.
OTHERFEMALE:Get it? Yes, crystal, i understand.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, this really takes me back.
LEADMALE:There's a lot you don't know about your father, darlene.
OTHERMALE:Before he became a responsible family man, he was quite the barroom brawler.
LEADMALE:Yeah, didn't you also used to design dresses under the name "coco"? I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:So, dan, word has it on the street you and fisher got in a fight over a poker game.
LEADMALE:What did he do, cheat ya? Yeah, crystal, that's exactly what happened.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! jailbird! So when's visiting hours? what is this, mayberry? Dan, we brought you a little something to help wile away those lonely hours in the slammer.
LEADFEMALE:Hit it, chuck.
LEADFEMALE:So what's the story, man? I heard you took out three guys in a bowling alley.
SUPMALE:I thought it was a poker game.
SUPFEMALE:Well, dan, according to the people at buy & bag, you went on a drunken rampage, beat up six guys, and took out a pay phone.
OTHERMALE:Hey, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:We heard about dan's little adventure.
LEADFEMALE:You know, everybody's talking about it.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Well people have been saying it for years.
LEADMALE:But now, with dan going to jail and everything, we are officially poor white trash.
SUPFEMALE:Now all we need is some little half-wit sitting in the front yard eating dirt.
LEADMALE:Hi! Shut up, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Man, what'd they give me? whoa! Has the living room always been downstairs? Now, don't you be too hard on dan.
SUPMALE:The boys will make up, and fisher won't even remember what dan did to him.
SUPMALE:Huh? dan beat up fisher? what? dan, can i talk to you? Jackie-in the bedroom, now.
SUPMALE:So what'd you do, dan? you went over there and beat him up, didn't you? Only his face.
SUPMALE:Oh! dan! What the hell were you thinking? you think you can go over there like some neanderthal that's gonna fix everything? You had no right to do that.
LEADFEMALE:No right at all.
LEADFEMALE:You stupid jackass.
LEADMALE:I swear, jackie, i just went over there to scare him a little bit and things got out of control.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is out of control now.
SUPMALE:It was really sweet of you to go over there and act like a big jerk! How--how could you do something that stupid and immature for me? Uh, i'm sorry, jackie, really.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just really humiliating, though.
LEADMALE:You know, because roseanne's always handling my problems, and now you.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a big job.
SUPFEMALE:We had to expand the department.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're both fired.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just that now everybody in town is gonna be talking about this.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen as far as everybody's concerned, fisher is just one of a zillion guys i beat up last night.
LEADMALE:Besides, people got better things to talk about than what goes on in our lives.
OTHERMALE:Dad, the paper's on the phone.
LEADFEMALE:They need a picture to run with the article.
LEADMALE:Should i send the one of you dressed as baby new year or do you just want them to use your mug shot? I'm coming.
SUPMALE:I'm coming.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Oh, i thought mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner was gonna be here.
LEADFEMALE:I'll come back later.
OTHERFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:What do you need? I'm here to collect for the paper.
LEADMALE:Didn't we just pay that? Don't hit me.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, really-no, that's okay.
LEADMALE:I'll come back later.
OTHERMALE:I'll be waitin' for ya! Dad, if kids are supposed to tell parents the truth, how come parents don't always tell kids the truth? Sit down, pal.
SUPMALE:I guess you probably heard in school that i was in jail.
LEADFEMALE:And you're right, i should have told you.
LEADMALE:But sometimes see, stuff happens, and your mom and i want to protect you from it.
SUPMALE:But you're right.
SUPFEMALE:I shoulda been honest with you.
SUPFEMALE:You were in jail? you didn't know? what's all this stuff about parents telling the truth? I was just asking.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i hope i answered your question.
LEADMALE:Why'd you go to jail? You see, deej, what happened was i lost my temper and i hit somebody, and hitting somebody's a very bad thing.
LEADFEMALE:Who'd you hit? It's not important who i hit.
OTHERMALE:Yes, it is, or you'd tell me.
LEADFEMALE:It was fisher.
SUPFEMALE:Why'd you hit him? 'cause he was mean to your aunt jackie in a way that's much different from the way your mom and grandma are mean to her.
LEADFEMALE:What'd he do? He hit her, deej.
SUPMALE:So what i did was sort of okay, 'cause the worst thing you can ever do is hit a woman.
LEADMALE:How come you're not supposed to hit girls but it's okay to hit guys? Well, you see, deej-rosie! Umuh okay, here's the deal.
LEADMALE:It's not okay to beat up anybody.
LEADMALE:It's never okay to beat up women.
SUPFEMALE:But sometimes it's less not okay to beat up somebody who beats up somebody you love.
OTHERFEMALE:What if a woman beats up somebody you love? are you at all interested in hearing where babies come from? Hi, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Moving day.
SUPMALE:Well, i got some tape and some rope, so that takes care of fisher.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, i wonder what we need to pack with.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just gonna grab some breakfast first.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, well, hurry up.
LEADFEMALE:We gotta get going.
LEADFEMALE:I left a message on your scum-sucking ex-boyfriend's machine that he better not bring his bony ass over to that apartment while we're moving you out, or else i'm gonna bash his skull in.
LEADMALE:Only i said it mean.
LEADMALE:Um, this isn't gonna work.
LEADFEMALE:You know, these boxes are too big.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i need small boxes for my breakables and stuff.
LEADMALE:I can't move without small boxes.
SUPMALE:Well, jackie, we'll be extra careful with your priceless collection of nfl juice glasses.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:I just don't want my breakables to get broken.
LEADFEMALE:I need small boxes.
LEADFEMALE:God, take a pill.
LEADFEMALE:We'll manage.
LEADMALE:Maybe this just isn't the best day to do this, you know, 'cause of the boxes and everything.
OTHERMALE:Well, jackie, we can get more boxes.
LEADMALE:I will whore myself in every grocery store in this town if that's what it takes, okay? Look, everything's just moving too damn fast.
SUPFEMALE:Where you going with this? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that yesterday i was in love with fisher, and today, boom, i'm just supposed to stop? You got, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Boom! Just like that.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'm sorry, but i happen to believe that maybe there is a chance, that he just might need some counseling or something.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you.
LEADMALE:You're all the time making excuses for people that treat you like crap.
LEADFEMALE:God, you are the most gutless, pathetic thing i've ever seen.
SUPFEMALE:I know you're just saying that 'cause you're worried about me.
SUPMALE:See? There you go again.
LEADMALE:I'm being totally insensitive, and you're making excuses for me.
LEADFEMALE:God, you're such an idiot.
OTHERMALE:Why are you attacking me? Because i'm sick of hearing this from you.
LEADFEMALE:It's the same crap you used to say about dad when we were kids.
OTHERMALE:It's not the same thing! It is too the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:You can't have a decent relationship because you're still looking for the same kind of relationship that we had as kids with dad.
SUPFEMALE:What about you? you grew up in the same house? Hey, i didn't say i was healthy.
LEADFEMALE:Obviously, i have some unresolved anger.
OTHERMALE:We're so aware.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's really easy to see things clearly when you've been married 20 years to a guy like dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i lucked out.
LEADFEMALE:I had lots of boyfriends before dan that treated me like crap, and i kept on going back because i didn't think i deserved any better.
SUPMALE:But i learned my lesson, and you didn't.
LEADMALE:You are an amazing and wonderful person, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I wish we could all be like you.
LEADFEMALE:I wish we could all be a happily married couple who each weighs all right, fine.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:If you can go to a mirror and look at those bruises all over your back and then tell me that you still want to go back to fisher, well, i'll get in my car and i'll drive you over there to him myself.
LEADMALE:No, you wouldn't.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i lied.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:God, do you know how much time we could save if you could just keep that in your mind as a given? It is so obvious.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody with this many self-help books has got to be a very troubled person.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:Gimme 'em.
LEADFEMALE:I'll put 'em in there with your cookbooks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i think i about got everything.
SUPFEMALE:Have you got a cord for this? That's not mine.
LEADFEMALE:That's fisher's.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what about this? is this yours? That's mine.
LEADMALE:Damn.
SUPFEMALE:You got anything else? Uh, i just got a few clothes in the bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i'll go in there and get 'em, and then we can burn the bed.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell are you doing here? I want-i wanna talk to you.
SUPMALE:Roseanne's in the bedroom.
LEADMALE:Get out of here.
LEADMALE:I was worried about you.
LEADFEMALE:Are you okay? Yes.
SUPMALE:I'll be all right.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, what can i do to show you how sorry i am? Well, getting my brother-in-law arrested was a really good start.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i already dropped the charges.
LEADMALE:I was angry.
OTHERFEMALE:I was confused.
SUPFEMALE:The neighbors called the police.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:You look terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie you remember how great things were when you moved in? Let's not throw all that away.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think i want things back to normal? I thought i was gonna move in here.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we were gonna get married.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, i think i got everything.
SUPFEMALE:Get out! I came to talk to jackie.
LEADMALE:Get out! Look, this is between us, okay? If you think for one second that you hurting my sister doesn't have everything to do with me, dan must have hit you harder than i thought.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i can handle it.
LEADMALE:You know, i consider myself a pretty good judge of people, and that's why i don't like none of 'em.
SUPMALE:But i liked you.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, i pushed jackie to get back together with you after y'all broke up.
SUPFEMALE:You just snuck right under my radar, man, and that just pisses me off.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i know you're upset with me, but you gotta understand.
LEADMALE:I really hate myself for this.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:That's good.
SUPFEMALE:And i really hope that you get your life together.
LEADFEMALE:But if you don't, i hope the next brother-in-law kills you.
LEADFEMALE:You say good-bye, jackie.
LEADMALE:Gimme a second.
LEADMALE:She's an adult.
LEADMALE:Maybe she doesn't wanna leave.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should stay out of this.
LEADMALE:You have to let me talk to him, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:You got nothing to talk to him about.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god! Can't i think for myself? what, are you thinking of staying with him? Why don't you just marry him and then have a whole bunch of kids so he can smack them around, too.
LEADMALE:Hey! Look, i've just about had it with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, i'm not gonna let you screw this up for me.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie understands me.
LEADMALE:We can work this out.
OTHERMALE:We've done it before.
SUPFEMALE:You mean this happened before? is that true, jackie? Okay, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't realize that this was the kind of sick relationship you were looking for.
SUPMALE:Maybe i was wrong to try to help you get out of it.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go downstairs and sit in my car.
LEADMALE:When you figure out what it is you're gonna do, you let me know.
SUPFEMALE:Well maybe now we can make some sense out of this.
LEADFEMALE:I think we just need to be alone.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we do.
OTHERMALE:'cause i don't want roseanne thinking that she's the reason why i'm leaving, and i don't want you thinking that either.
LEADMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:If you ever come near her again, you're gonna have to deal with me, and i am way more dangerous than dan.
LEADFEMALE:I got a loose-meat restaurant.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what to do with the body.
SUPFEMALE:Umthat's mine.
SUPFEMALE:God! I hate myself for that.
OTHERMALE:What? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:No, really, what's the matter? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:I'm just looking at you.
LEADMALE:Why? Because i was sitting here thinking how lucky i am to have you.
SUPFEMALE:But now you're getting on my nerves.
LEADMALE:So shut up! Really? that's what you were thinking? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:You know, i was thinking i could have done way worse than you.
SUPFEMALE:You're pretty cool.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you want me? I've just washed.
LEADMALE:I just said you were cool.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't say i want to do nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:I'm not that easy.
LEADMALE:Tell me some more wonderful things about myself.
SUPMALE:Start with my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna hear all the things i like about you? Uhyou picked me and you fix stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Good enough.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get after it.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Mom, listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm writing a play.
OTHERMALE:Ah, put aside the novel, did ya? It's for woodchucks.
LEADMALE:We're doing this history pageant at the lanford days winter carnival on how lanford was founded.
SUPMALE:Don't you mean found? No, mom.
SUPMALE:Founded.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't know it was losted.
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
SUPMALE:Okay, i'm sorry, go ahead.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:"gather 'round, ye citizens of lanford, "and hear the tale of the founding of your town.
LEADMALE:"many years ago, "vikings came to america and discovered lanford, "but it was already one of the 13 colonies, so abraham lincoln sent them home.
LEADFEMALE:" "he freed the vikings" "and then the indians came with geronimo and"-hey, hey, hold it, hold it.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you come up with all this stuff? Darlene told me.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i'm surprised you left out the part where moses led his people out of lanford.
LEADFEMALE:Don't believe anything darlene tells you.
LEADMALE:Except what i told you about sex.
LEADMALE:That was all true.
LEADMALE:I want you to go down to the library and look up the real story about the founding of lanford, okay? Go to where we check out the videos, and ask them where the books are.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, but i'm looking up the sex stuff, too, so be ready.
SUPFEMALE:I wish you wouldn't do that to him.
OTHERMALE:He gets enough wrong information from me and your dad.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if he'd actually read something once in a while, he wouldn't be such an easy target.
LEADMALE:You know, i think his picture's probably under "gullible" in the dictionary.
OTHERFEMALE:See, that just goes to show how much you know.
LEADFEMALE:"gullible" isn't even in the dictionary.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it is.
LEADMALE:No, i just read this whole story in reader's digest where they said, "can you even believe that 'gullible' is not listed in the dictionary?" oh, really? We'll see about that.
LEADMALE:It's good to see that the classics still hold up.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.
OTHERMALE:If this doesn't bring people into our lanford days booth, nothing will.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think? I think it's a big fat lie.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's not.
SUPFEMALE:She's gonna be singing there, we corner her with a sandwich, she loves it, we get her to say "hooo doggies," and the whole thing's true.
SUPFEMALE:You're right, mom.
LEADMALE:"gullible" is not in here.
LEADMALE:It's not? That's the whole joke.
SUPMALE:Let me see that.
OTHERMALE:I hate this family.
LEADMALE:Hey, do i smell food? Yeah, but that'll go away soon as i start fixing dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Can you make it quick? I gotta run out again.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? I got a job.
SUPMALE:Do i still have a tie? Whoa.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Come again? A tie--one of those long, skinny things.
LEADMALE:Remember the wedding? you mean like a job job? Well, i get tired of sitting around the house, and a lot of other husbands in the neighborhoods have jobs now.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you know i like you looking all pretty for me when i get home from work.
LEADMALE:Come on, roseanne, i haven't had any work in weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you want me to stay around the house doing stuff, but i can't.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure, now what? i have to come home and break up potato chips onto the couch all by myself? Oh, so i don't do nothing.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, don't come out of your hair.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i just didn't even know you were looking.
OTHERFEMALE:What kind of job is it? Running the booth at lanford days, selling hot tubs.
LEADFEMALE:The beauty part is i never have to see the boss.
LEADFEMALE:He just calls in to check up on me.
LEADFEMALE:It's like charlie's angels.
LEADFEMALE:You got a job, like a steady job? what am i, a hobo? No, i think it's great.
OTHERFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:I may even have an investment for that new income.
OTHERMALE:Oh, good, 'cause we've been thinking about diversifying our portfolio beyond, you know, beer nuts.
OTHERFEMALE:David and i think we're ready to start selling the comics, and we could print up a thousand of 'em for then why don't you wait until friday when you get your allowance? Come on, you said the restaurant's doing okay, and it's a great idea, and i'll pay you back.
SUPMALE:No way, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:This sucks.
SUPMALE:It's not like i'm asking for a college fund.
LEADFEMALE:These comics are all i got going for me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, now, don't go getting all in a huff 'cause you asked for something you can't possibly get.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you let me know what i can possibly get, and i'll ask for that? Okay, well, you can get the warmth of my loving bosom, and a coupon for a dollar off a loose meat sandwich, cheese extra.
LEADFEMALE:My wrist is killing me.
SUPMALE:Can't we do a scene that doesn't have so much rain in it? why don't you skip to the sandstorm? Food break.
LEADFEMALE:Why are we doing this if no one's gonna see it? Just 'cause your mom won't help out doesn't mean that's the end of it.
OTHERFEMALE:You can always go back to exotic dancing.
OTHERFEMALE:You, too.
LEADFEMALE:You're still eating meat? Oh, come on.
OTHERMALE:I tried to stop, okay? But i realized i'm a carnivore.
SUPMALE:Well, so are wolverines, but i don't let them heat up their prey in my microwave.
SUPFEMALE:A little respect for my beliefs would be nice.
LEADMALE:I would respect your beliefs if i knew what they were.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you talking about? You're such a hypocrite.
LEADMALE:You won't eat meat, but your family makes its living selling meat.
SUPFEMALE:Where do you think your mom's gonna get the money for our comics? Oh, please.
OTHERMALE:That is completely different.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
SUPMALE:And what about your allowance? Face it, darlene, you are a part of the giant meat industrial complex.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
SUPMALE:I am not.
LEADMALE:Let's get back to work.
LEADFEMALE:I won an argument.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:What are you gonna do now, kill me and eat me? Besides, it's out of my hands.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, what could i do about it anyway? Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the owner of this restaurant.
LEADMALE:What the hell? People, that's it! show's over! Move along.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:I know what you're thinking, roseanne, but this could have been done by anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not jump to conclusions.
LEADMALE:Damn that stork! hey! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:So working on those comics there, huh, are ya? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Say, darlene, i know that you do all the writing and david does all the drawing, but do you ever get an urge to draw, darlene? Oh, like, say, maybe you wake up in the middle of the night, going, "god, i've just gotta draw something somewhere!" all right, let's get this over with.
OTHERFEMALE:I did the chalk outlines.
LEADFEMALE:I just couldn't go on being part of the connor family money-making death machine.
SUPMALE:Oh, now you come up with a name for the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:I was making a statement.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Well, i'm making a statement, too, only my chalk outline's gonna have long curly hair and a great big mouth.
SUPFEMALE:This is not a game, darlene.
LEADMALE:You got a problem, take it up with me.
SUPFEMALE:Don't screw with the family business.
OTHERFEMALE:Doesn't it bother you that you make a living by exploiting animals? you don't get it, do you? We are too low on the food chain to exploit people.
LEADFEMALE:All that's left for us is animals.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm sorry if i have principles despite everything you've taught me.
SUPMALE:Oh, bull.
LEADFEMALE:It has nothing to do with principles.
LEADFEMALE:You're just mad 'cause we won't give you the 300 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right, like i really expected to get that money in the first place.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'll tell you what you didn't expect.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't expect to be dishing loose meat sandwiches over at the lanford days this weekend, but that's exactly what you're gonna be doing.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to be kidding.
LEADMALE:Case closed, darlene.
LEADMALE:How close do i have to get to the meat? Well, you have to sell it and serve it and kiss it and love it.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Do you have any barbecued pork? Hey, just 'cause we slaughter cows does not mean we hurt our little piggy friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Y'all come back soon.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, look at me.
OTHERFEMALE:What? what'd you do that for? how else are we gonna fool your mom? I don't want her stopping by here and finding out you didn't work all day.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:If anyone asks, a cow blew up on me.
SUPMALE:Hi, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, molly.
LEADMALE:Here's your apron.
LEADFEMALE:You're working here? She promised she'd come over and spell me.
OTHERFEMALE:The scooper's there, the gloves are right here, and darlene is on a break, so i'm gonna go over and make sure d.j. 's play goes all right.
LEADMALE:Last yeah, when they did peter pan, nobody clapped, and tinker bell died.
LEADMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:Just the thing to make my day fly by.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, you want me to leave? 'cause i can go, and you can slop this stuff yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:We can work this out.
OTHERFEMALE:We're both reasonable people.
SUPMALE:Just don't look at me.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, darlene.
LEADMALE:Hey, molly.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, david.
LEADMALE:Sorry i got you into this.
OTHERMALE:I really feel responsible.
LEADFEMALE:What did you do? Dead cow outlines in front of the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:No biggie.
LEADMALE:Hey, that's so cool.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i'm a vegetarian, too.
LEADFEMALE:I think anyone who cares about their body wouldn't poison themselves with that stuff.
OTHERMALE:Huh.
SUPFEMALE:I'd never thought about it that way before.
SUPMALE:Oh, and now you do just 'cause she said it? all of a sudden you're a vegetarian? Well, i'm vegetarian-like.
SUPMALE:What the hell does that mean? I'm eating a lot more chicken.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot.
SUPFEMALE:Chicken's a vegetable.
LEADMALE:You even argue when i agree with you.
SUPFEMALE:You're not agreeing with me.
LEADMALE:You're agreeing with her, who happens to agree with me, which makes me want to rethink my whole position.
SUPMALE:Thank you, darlene.
LEADMALE:Oh, give me a break.
LEADMALE:You're probably just saying you're a vegetarian 'cause you heard somewhere shannen doherty might be one.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADFEMALE:All right, sparky, you made me chase her away, so now you're in charge of handling the meat.
LEADMALE:Story of my life.
LEADMALE:Just wait till you see this puppy in action.
LEADFEMALE:Feel that jet.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Wow, that's turbulence.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you want to see turbulence, come on over to my house! I'm kidding, but you know, imagine putting your tired muscles up against that at the end of a long, hard day? By the way, i didn't get your name.
LEADFEMALE:Paul.
OTHERFEMALE:Paul.
SUPMALE:That's my son's name, paul.
LEADMALE:What do you think, paul? how much is something like this? Only 3,200, but with our no-money-down payment plan, we're talking a few dollars a day.
LEADFEMALE:And let me tell you something, my friend.
LEADMALE:This thing is a babe magnet.
LEADMALE:I'm married.
SUPMALE:We can have it demagnetized.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess i could spare a few dollars a day.
SUPMALE:Okay, you sold me.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Terrific! Well, step into my office, and we'll fill out a credit application.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, uh, annual income.
LEADMALE:About 15,000.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Any additional income? Well, my wife was making about 12 till she got laid off, but she wanted to spend more time with the kids anyway.
LEADFEMALE:How many kids you got? Four.
SUPFEMALE:Four? credit cards? Yep.
LEADMALE:Got all of 'em, but this doesn't got to go on 'em, right? 'cause they're pretty full.
SUPFEMALE:I got to be honest with you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think these guys are gonna approve you.
OTHERMALE:Well, sure, they will.
LEADFEMALE:They always do.
LEADMALE:Everything i own is on time payments.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe that's your problem.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think this tub is way beyond your means? Of course it is.
LEADFEMALE:If i lived at my means, my life would be crap.
LEADMALE:If you lived at my means, your life would be crap.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you something.
LEADMALE:You're wishing you were me.
SUPMALE:Look, i want to buy this thing.
LEADFEMALE:I can get it here or from somebody else.
SUPFEMALE:Your choice.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:I really don't appreciate these high-pressure tactics.
LEADMALE:Woodchuck troop 647 presents the founding of lanford.
LEADMALE:You know, jackie, it's just been too long.
LEADFEMALE:We simply don't get to the theatre often enough.
LEADMALE:It all began on a dark and cloudy day.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have the articles of incorporation for the city of lanford? Yes, i have the articles of incorporation for the city of lanford right here.
LEADFEMALE:Sign here.
LEADFEMALE:And here.
LEADFEMALE:And initial here.
SUPMALE:And so the city of lanford was founded on november 11, 1946.
LEADMALE:God, i just love it when history comes alive.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, huckleberry finn.
LEADMALE:I thought i told you not to go selling hot tubs dressed up in your church clothes.
OTHERFEMALE:Been a rough day.
LEADMALE:Hey, how was d.j. 's play? Very real.
SUPMALE:Almost brutal in its honesty.
LEADMALE:You okay? I don't know how people do this, selling stuff that people don't need to people who can't afford it.
LEADFEMALE:It's the american dream, dan.
LEADFEMALE:My old man could do it.
OTHERMALE:That guy could sell anything to anybody no matter what.
LEADMALE:This is the first time in my life i admired him for being such a bastard.
LEADMALE:Oh honey, you'll always be a bastard to me.
LEADMALE:I guess that's it for sales.
LEADFEMALE:Some guys are made to wear these, some guys aren't.
SUPMALE:Well, it's just as well, 'cause, you know, if you got a promotion, we'd have go out and find you a clip-on suit.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want to do now? I don't know, but i'm not gonna let this discourage me.
LEADFEMALE:There's a wonderful world of opportunities out there.
LEADFEMALE:Look at all those booths.
SUPMALE:That's right, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You are just as unskilled as the next guy.
LEADMALE:More so.
LEADFEMALE:Incoming.
LEADFEMALE:David, what you doing here? I'm just helping because molly left.
LEADMALE:But darlene served all the sandwiches.
LEADMALE:Let me smell your hands.
LEADMALE:David, out.
SUPFEMALE:The deal was that you were supposed to help this family make back some of the money that you cost us, okay? The very next customer that comes up here, you are serving a sandwich to.
SUPFEMALE:Hi there.
LEADFEMALE:Could i have a loose meat sandwich, please? oh, my god! we love you! we love you! Darlene, do you know who this is? Yeah, it's loretta lynn.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like some nice chips instead? God! Oh, man, we're such big fans of yours.
SUPFEMALE:I'm roseanne connor, and this is my daughter darlene, and we're so proud to have you patronize our humble establishment.
LEADMALE:Darlene, fix her a sandwich.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Darlene, don't make me yell at you in front of a famous person.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, did i mention i'd like cheese on that, too? how about just cheese? how about just do it? Can't.
LEADMALE:Bet you would do it for 300 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't about money.
LEADFEMALE:How can i make you get this? This was once a beautiful living thing until someone put a bolt gun to its head and chopped it up, and now you want me to serve it to someone so they can make their stomach into a graveyard.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, i don't mean to interfere or nothing, but i got to respect the girl for saying what she feels, and i do, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for understanding.
LEADFEMALE:Now hand me a great big ol' gob of that meat 'cause i'm starvin' to death.
SUPMALE:Here you go, miss lynn.
OTHERFEMALE:I would like you to accept this sandwich, uh, from us on the house.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, honey, and i'll see you later.
LEADMALE:You just don't know when to quit, do you? You can't make someone go against their principles.
SUPFEMALE:What did you think when you saw me as a baby, "i hope she never has the courage to stand up for her convictions"? Okay, okay, so you have convictions.
LEADMALE:Just shut up about 'em! God, thank you.
LEADMALE:Can i turn in my apron now? Yeah, yeah, you're all done here.
LEADMALE:But i'm still gonna punish you.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:One loose meat, please.
LEADFEMALE:And could you dip the bun in the grease? Ugh.
LEADFEMALE:Why couldn't you have opened a vegetarian restaurant? Because people around these parts do not eat that way.
OTHERFEMALE:There used to be that place on elm by the bookstore-you know uh, carl's natural garden.
LEADMALE:Who asked you? The whole world's going to hell, but i can take comfort in the fact that i'm not a hypocrite.
SUPMALE:Oh you think you're so perfect, don't you? well, where do you think they get that ink that you use to draw those comics of yours, huh? They get it from baby squids, that's where! They take about a dozen of 'em and shove 'em into this machine where they get pinched and squeezed and tortured until the ink just shoots out.
LEADMALE:Why breathe? that--that's not true, is it? didn't i tell you to shut up? Sorry.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't lie to children.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, when you've had something inside your gut kicking and punching at you and making you sick every morning, then you can talk to me.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't know what that's like.
LEADMALE:At least not until i've finished this sandwich.
LEADMALE:Come on, dan.
SUPMALE:Show me what a man you are.
LEADMALE:I really, really want this one.
LEADMALE:Come on! you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn! come on, you flesh eaters, you meat-sucking carnivores, you blood-drinking cow-killers! that's it! oh, this is way more relaxing than a hot tub! Now, loretta, you've been married about a million years, right? Uh, a million years come august.
LEADFEMALE:I got to ask you something.
LEADMALE:Now, you know tom has his own show now, and you know how cute he is, and all these women are starting to look at him more.
LEADMALE:I really don't think you have anything to worry about, because he loves you so much.
SUPMALE:I really don't think tom would ever cheat on you.
SUPMALE:Not unless he wants his show to go on after richard simmons' deal-a-meal.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this might help us a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:If we can sing about it, we don't have to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:You've come to tell me something you say i ought to know that he don't love me anymore and i have to let him go you say you're gonna take him oh, but i don't think you can 'cause you ain't woman enough to take my man women like you, they're a dime a dozen you can buy 'em anywhere for you to get to him i'd have to move over and i'm gonna stand right here it'll be over my dead body so get out while you can 'cause you ain't woman enough to take my man you women ain't woman enough to take our man 
OTHERFEMALE:Here, read this.
LEADMALE:What is it, a valentine, or are they gonna hold you back a year? When i was 5, you signed a contract saying as soon as i was 12, i could do whatever i wanted.
SUPFEMALE:My birthday's on monday.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is so cute.
LEADMALE:I didn't even know you saved this.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been waiting.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's all here, d.j. , so i guess starting monday, you're free.
LEADFEMALE:It's been great being your mom.
SUPMALE:Yes! Oh, oh, oh, wait, d.j. well, you forgot to get this notarized.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Go clean the chimney.
OTHERMALE:I'm sick of this family.
LEADMALE:Line forms to the rear.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be 12.
OTHERMALE:I don't want anymore babysitters.
SUPFEMALE:Becky and darlene were allowed to stay alone when they were my age.
SUPMALE:Well, that's because girls mature faster than boys.
LEADMALE:So when do boys get mature? We'll let you know as soon as your dad gets there.
LEADMALE:I heard that.
SUPMALE:And i choose to respond thusly pfft! pfft! pfft! Mom lied to me.
OTHERMALE:Well, you're lucky, deej.
LEADFEMALE:There are kids in china whose mothers have no lies to give them.
LEADFEMALE:Mom says boys aren't as mature as girls.
OTHERMALE:Damn it, roseanne, the boy keeps hearing all this negative stuff about men and it's just not true.
LEADFEMALE:He's every bit as mature as the girls ever were.
LEADFEMALE:Well, your son wants to stay home all by himself.
LEADFEMALE:No way! he's a boy! I'm gonna get a lawyer.
OTHERFEMALE:Kids can divorce their parents for stuff like this.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? well, you know that little boy that divorced his parents? you know what he's doing now? Every night he goes out cruising the bars looking for new parents.
SUPFEMALE:And i can't tell you the kind of garbage that's out there.
OTHERMALE:D.j. , run upstairs for a minute.
OTHERMALE:I'm not done talking about this.
OTHERFEMALE:Go upstairs.
LEADMALE:I'm not finished! What's going on? It's joan.
LEADFEMALE:She's calling about your dad.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? You never listen to me! d.j. , get upstairs now! He died, honey.
SUPMALE:You doing okay? No, not really.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i'm here.
LEADFEMALE:It's harris, al harris.
LEADFEMALE:He's my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i just got through telling this whole thing to somebody else.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all i want to know is if his flight's coming in on time.
LEADFEMALE:No, not coach.
LEADFEMALE:Try baggage.
LEADMALE:Ask him about his frequent flyer miles.
LEADFEMALE:He was a salesman.
SUPMALE:That would have been very important to him.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, can't you go and get drunk or something? Yeah, i'm here.
LEADMALE:Listen, this is gonna sound kinda weird and everything, but is he gonna be coming down that conveyor belt with everybody's baggage? No, no, the mortuary picks him up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's good, 'cause i didn't think we could fit him in our truck.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm sorry you don't think that's funny! Hey, i'm saving my best jokes for the funeral.
LEADMALE:That's it, i'm not making any more calls.
SUPFEMALE:You do the rest of the family list.
LEADMALE:I can't call people, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Jackie, dial.
OTHERFEMALE:We're supposed to be in mourning.
LEADMALE:Well, then wear a veil over your face while you do it.
SUPMALE:I can't--auntie barbara? It's jackie.
LEADMALE:Jackie! I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Fine! i'm fine! I have some bad news.
OTHERMALE:Dad is not with us anymore.
LEADMALE:I said dad has passed away! he's passed away! dad is gone! dad's dead! he's dead! no, dead! dead! He's fine.
SUPFEMALE:He sends his love.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:I am not doing that again! you can't make me! Hello, girls.
LEADMALE:Where have you been? Hi, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody doing okay? Yeah, we're doing fine.
SUPFEMALE:How are you doing? Well, i'm not sure.
LEADMALE:You dream about this moment, and then it happens, then it's just not the same.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, honey, you look exhausted.
LEADMALE:Well, i had to talk to auntie barbara.
LEADMALE:I think we should all have some tea and then pour large amounts of brandy into it.
OTHERMALE:Darlene, will you put on some water and then bring the brandy down from your room? Very funny.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think if i had brandy in my room, i'd spend more time at home? so, did joan have more details, or was she rushing out to break up another marriage? He was on the road and he had a heart attack.
OTHERFEMALE:And if there's anymore, she'll tell us at the funeral.
LEADMALE:At the funeral? She wants to be there.
SUPFEMALE:We can't stop her.
LEADMALE:Perhaps she and i can draw straws over who gets to throw themself on the coffin.
LEADMALE:Well, if she gets out of line, we'll drag her behind the chapel and we'll beat the crap out of her.
LEADMALE:Mom, are we out of tea bags? Yeah, i think i put 'em in the cupboard.
LEADFEMALE:You know, for such a rotten kid, you're sure being a big help.
SUPMALE:I think i put away most of the grief buffet.
SUPMALE:It's so bizarre how people bring over all this food when someone dies.
LEADMALE:Yeah, like it's gonna make you feel any better.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, chocolate cake! When did that get here? Well, everything's all crazy around here, and we haven't even had a chance to talk or anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you okay? Well, i feel bad that i don't feel bad enough.
SUPMALE:I mean, i haven't seen him in a while.
LEADMALE:I don't know, it's weird.
LEADMALE:Well, you don't gotta feel nothing but what you feel.
SUPFEMALE:I just feel like i should cry.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't cried yet.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Got cramps, though.
LEADMALE:Well, i think he would have liked that.
LEADMALE:Grandma, i'm really sorry grandpa died.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna miss him.
LEADMALE:That's sweet, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:Your grandfather loved you, too.
SUPMALE:And he's gonna look very smart in this tie.
SUPFEMALE:This is for grandpa? Absolutely.
LEADMALE:You're wearing the very tie that will be buried with your grandfather tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Get it off me! get it off! Darlene, would you let me-no.
LEADMALE:Hey, mom, wouldn't it just be easier if you peeled your face off and chase 'em around the block? Roseanne, i have to tie this straight.
LEADMALE:You can't trust those funeral people.
LEADMALE:They'll just throw the tie on him.
LEADMALE:It has to be right! His tie will be perfect, mother.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make sure of it myself.
LEADMALE:The man will not be buried under six feet of rocks, dirt, and crap until his tie's perfect! Did you find the picture of dad yet? I can't decide.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you gotta hurry, jackie, 'cause the mortician needs to see it so he can figure out what dad's supposed to look like.
LEADMALE:How 'bout that one? That's his navy picture from 1944.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he looks so handsome! Yeah, well, i think they're gonna have a little bit of trouble trying to sew his hand to his forehead.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't take this anymore.
LEADFEMALE:My stomach hurts.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, you don't have to take it anymore, 'cause you could just be the designated basket case this time, okay? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too, weirdo.
LEADMALE:Come on, we gotta hurry now, 'cause i wanna be back here by 3:00.
SUPFEMALE:How come? Well, 'cause joan is getting in early, and i want to invite her over to the house.
LEADMALE:Well, jeez, roseanne, don't you think that's a little odd, inviting dad's other woman over to your house? Well, hey, like it or not, she's been part of his life for 22 years.
LEADMALE:Just seems like the thing to do now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fine.
LEADFEMALE:That's--that's great.
SUPMALE:What, jackie? Well, if you're so comfortable with this woman in your house, it might have been nice to invite them over when dad was alive.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but then dad would have came with her.
SUPFEMALE:This way, i'm pretty sure he ain't gonna show.
OTHERMALE:I'm just saying that i-i didn't get to see my father for the last two years of his life because of you, and now here you are playing hostess to his mistress.
SUPMALE:You're not gonna blame me for you not seeing dad.
SUPMALE:You made him so unwelcome here, he never would have come visit.
LEADFEMALE:Just 'cause you hated him, then the whole rest of the family had to hate him, too.
LEADMALE:You are so wrong! You are so selfish.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, oh, i'm selfish.
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:Have you noticed who's been doing all the planning for this funeral? did you notice at all that it wasn't you? That's 'cause you don't care, so it's no problem for you to handle everything i loved him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when did you love him more, jackie? when he'd come home and beat us with a belt, or when he didn't come home at all? That was a long time ago, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know what was going on in his mind the last years of his life.
LEADMALE:You didn't even give him a chance to say he was sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you love him so much, i'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:You go down to that funeral home and you make the rest of the arrangements, okay? I'm selfish, and i don't care, so i wash my hands of the whole damn thing.
OTHERMALE:All right, fine, i will make the rest of the arrangements.
SUPMALE:You're calling auntie barbara with directions to the cemetery, right, roseanne? roseanne? Come on, jacks, i'm here for ya.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, why do i have to pick out a casket now when my dad just died? It kinda happens that way, jackie.
LEADMALE:Hello, i'm frank denvers.
LEADFEMALE:You--you must be roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:No, i am jackie.
OTHERMALE:I'm roseanne's sister.
SUPMALE:I am going to make the arrangements.
LEADMALE:How was that? Dan connor.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet ya.
LEADMALE:Look, we're not very good at this sort of thing, so could we just sit down and get through it as quickly as possible? Oh, certainly.
LEADMALE:I wanna make this as easy on you as possible.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to see the body? Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:I think that's a big "no" on that one.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
OTHERFEMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:He called dad "the body.
LEADFEMALE:" jackie, you want me to do this? No, i-i said i was gonna make the arrangements, so let's start arranging.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, first off, we should probably pick out the casket.
LEADFEMALE:They're all nice.
LEADMALE:Very nice.
SUPFEMALE:I like the white one.
LEADMALE:That is a lovely choice.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne would never pick white.
LEADFEMALE:She says it gets dirty too fast.
OTHERMALE:I don't think that really applies here, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:She'd want the black.
LEADMALE:I'll take the white.
LEADMALE:White it is.
SUPMALE:And i would like one of those satin pillows, too.
OTHERMALE:She'd hate that.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should ask what this costs, jackie.
SUPMALE:Well, since your mother and father already bought their adjoining plots, it shouldn't be that expensive.
OTHERMALE:How much is "not expensive"? Well, let's see, the white rose the white rose $3,000.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's a lot.
SUPFEMALE:That's a lot, isn't it, dan? Yes, that is a lot.
LEADMALE:Maybe i should look at some others.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, of course.
LEADFEMALE:But you should realize that they are of lesser quality.
LEADMALE:So, what you're saying is that if she really loved him, she'd get the white rose, and if she doesn't, she'd get something with a twist tie and the word "hefty" on the side.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:If cost is a consideration, i'm sure that we can find something that you can be comfortable with.
LEADMALE:Before we go on, i just want you to know that i'm feeling very irrational right now.
SUPMALE:I'm likely to buy anything that you show me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm also very likely to take out a gun and blow your head off if i think you're taking advantage of me.
LEADMALE:So i would play me very carefully.
LEADFEMALE:Atta girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne? Hi, joan.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm glad you could come down.
SUPMALE:Well, thanks for asking me out.
OTHERFEMALE:I understand about not coming to the house.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, it looks pretty much like this place.
LEADMALE:Let me order a beer or something.
OTHERFEMALE:Could i get you a second? Well, you could if you would have gotten here an hour ago.
SUPMALE:I'll have what she's having.
SUPMALE:Wow, this is so weird, sitting here, drinking a beer with my dead father's mistress.
LEADFEMALE:It's funny.
LEADMALE:I'm not a mistress in kansas city.
LEADMALE:I'm only a mistress in lanford.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:In lanford, you're something else.
LEADMALE:Really, i don't think you asked me here to insult me.
LEADMALE:No, i didn't and i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Uh listen, what i did ask you here for is 'cause i wanna ask you some stuff about my dad, you know? You're kinda the only person that's really been with him for the last couple of years.
SUPMALE:I just wanted to know if there's any time where he said anything about any mistakes he might have made, or, uh, any regrets maybe that he had.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he really regretted what happened between him and you girls.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he really said that? Come on, roseanne, you must have known how unhappy he was.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought he didn't give a damn.
SUPMALE:Didn't give a damn? He prided himself on what a devoted father he was.
SUPFEMALE:You've gotta be kiddin' me.
SUPFEMALE:He always said you girls never appreciated what he did for you because he spoiled you so much.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if he meant "spoiled" as in "wrecked" roseanne, i know you're upset with your father for having an affair.
LEADMALE:So you think this is about the affair? You don't know nothing.
SUPMALE:You don't know nothing about my childhood.
LEADMALE:I could tell you stuff about my dad that you couldn't even handle.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we shouldn't be doing this.
SUPMALE:In spite of everything, your dad did die knowing you loved him.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta go.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:I guess i'm a little early.
SUPMALE:I'm beverly harris.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:You must be joan.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:We finally meet.
SUPMALE:What a shame we don't have some sort of flavored coffee to celebrate this moment in our lives.
LEADMALE:I understand how you feel about me.
LEADMALE:Do you? Well, i think i'd better go inside.
LEADFEMALE:Not yet.
LEADFEMALE:I've waited a long time for this moment, and you will not rob me of it.
LEADMALE:All right, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should be shot! I long for the days when we could brand someone like you with a scarlet letter, leaving you a lonely, miserable outcast.
OTHERMALE:And if you ever contract an incurable and very painful disease, i will not be able to stop myself from dancing a jig of glee.
SUPFEMALE:Now, that being said, i would like to sell you my burial plot.
SUPFEMALE:Are you serious? You love him so much, you spend eternity next to the man.
SUPFEMALE:Mom? Hello, dear.
LEADFEMALE:We're chatting.
LEADFEMALE:Go away.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, do i have to remind you we can only afford one coffin today? Ms.
SUPMALE:Harris, if i could just have one moment.
OTHERFEMALE:Before we close the casket, i'm gonna need someone to identify the body.
SUPFEMALE:I'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, i think that's fair, 'cause i got to pick the pillow and everything.
SUPFEMALE:Rosie, you want me to go in there? No, i wanna do it.
LEADFEMALE:Right this way, mrs.
LEADMALE:Connor.
LEADMALE:Just a quick look and then i'll close it.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:That's all i need.
SUPMALE:Can i have a minute in here by myself? Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Take your time.
LEADMALE:Dad, i'm real sorry that you died before i got to tell you some stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:"i'm angry at you for lying to me my whole life.
LEADMALE:"i'm angry that i didn't ever know who you really were.
LEADMALE:"i'm mad that when i was a kid, you ignored me, "and when you did give me any attention, it was usually violent.
LEADMALE:"i'm mad that you left us alone with a crazy mother.
LEADMALE:"i'm mad that because of you, i grew up distrustful of men, "and i couldn't even trust my own husband "for the first five years we were married.
LEADMALE:"i'm mad at you because you did all the same stuff to jackie, and because you made us feel like we were never good enough.
LEADFEMALE:" "but now i just need it to end.
OTHERMALE:"so, dad, i'm forgiving you just because i need "to move on with my life.
LEADMALE:And i forgive myself for being so damn angry.
SUPMALE:" thank you for your humor.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:Good-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you want to do now? Um, just sit out here for a while.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna eat another casserole? No.
SUPFEMALE:It's kinda cool sittin' out here anyway, you know, looking up at the stars, listening to all the quiet.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it gives you time to think about stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:Wanna watch tv? god, yes! What's on? Well, it's 9:30.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hey, it's time for my favorite show! what? you know, that guy, that shekie thomas guy? did you see the one with the monkeys? oh, that guy! yeah! oh, did you see the episode where he had the woman stalker on? Man, she was scary! No, i missed that one.
OTHERFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:This whole place is mine.
SUPFEMALE:Anything you want is free.
LEADMALE:Do they let you work here? I don't have to.
LEADFEMALE:I'm an owner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? prove it! okay, you want to see? d.j. ! what are you doing? He made me! This is why you don't have any friends, d.j. you guys sit down there.
LEADMALE:I'll make you a couple of sandwiches.
LEADFEMALE:She's new.
OTHERMALE:Anything's better than having your mom here.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, d.j. hey, jordan.
LEADMALE:Oh! Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, you look especially lovely today.
LEADFEMALE:Brace yourself, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Mom just called.
SUPFEMALE:Someone's coming here, someone you don't like.
SUPMALE:That could be anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Cousin ronnie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:She heard about dad.
LEADMALE:She wants to pay her respects.
LEADMALE:Well, couldn't she have her secretary fax her respects from her royal yacht or something? what does she have to come down here for? I would like to stick around, but i have a lot ofstuff to do.
SUPMALE:You're not going anywhere.
OTHERMALE:You're gonna be right here when the happiness hits the fan.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You can make me stay, but for god sakes, let the little ones go.
LEADMALE:Blow.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you guys.
SUPFEMALE:Fill me in.
LEADMALE:Don't hog the hate.
LEADMALE:You better tell her, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get too upset.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Ronnie's a cousin.
LEADMALE:She's a jerk.
OTHERMALE:And about 25 years ago, they had a misunderstanding.
SUPFEMALE:It wasn't a misunderstanding.
SUPFEMALE:I was totally right and she was completely wrong.
LEADMALE:Roseanne thought she was gonna be a bridesmaid in ronnie's wedding, and now roseanne will interrupt me.
LEADFEMALE:But ronnie didn't think that i was good enough to be in her crummy little wedding, you know? Which is totally fine with me, because it was a pretentious, overblown piece of crap anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Was it a day or an evening wedding? Never mind.
LEADMALE:If you need me, i'll be in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Well, here.
OTHERFEMALE:Clean up a little before she gets here.
LEADFEMALE:What are you mad at me for? Because you're my sister and if i hate somebody, you gotta hate 'em too.
SUPFEMALE:That's called love.
OTHERMALE:It was never my fight anyway.
LEADFEMALE:And besides, you don't know.
LEADMALE:It's been 25 years.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe she's come down to earth since the last time we saw her.
OTHERFEMALE:Ronnie.
SUPFEMALE:Well, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:You've certainly grown out of that awkward stage.
OTHERMALE:Well, it happened about a week ago.
LEADMALE:We're all very happy about that.
LEADMALE:How's your sister? She's good.
LEADFEMALE:She's right over there.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, i see her.
SUPMALE:Well, i can see that you two obviously want to talk, so i will just get out of your way.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, would you like some coffee or something? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Coffee'd be great.
LEADMALE:That's a nice outfit.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:That's a niceplace.
LEADMALE:Oh, this old thing? I just threw it together this morning.
LEADMALE:Rosie, i was so sorry to hear about your father.
SUPMALE:You know, i really loved him.
LEADMALE:Well, you had the advantage of not being his kid.
OTHERMALE:I would have come to the funeral, but i only heard about it a few days ago.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom took pictures.
OTHERMALE:Look, i know there's been a lot of bad blood between us, and i know we've said a lot of things to each other which, although extremely clever, we probably regret.
LEADFEMALE:But i really think this is a time for families to be together.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Death is such an ice-breaker.
LEADFEMALE:I want you and i to bury the hatchet, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sick of being mad at you.
LEADMALE:You mad at me? You're the one that didn't make your closest cousin your bridesmaid.
LEADMALE:I was in new york.
OTHERMALE:I'd made new friends.
SUPMALE:I hadobligations.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, what about your obligations to me? You know, i was sitting there waiting for a call from you to tell me what kind of hideous tangerine chiffon bridesmaid dress to wear, and then i get an invitation 3 months later that 350 other people got.
SUPFEMALE:I was crushed.
LEADFEMALE:Tangerine chiffon? That is so '60s.
OTHERMALE:Well, it was the '60s.
SUPMALE:Nancy, if you don't mind, this really has nothing to do with you, okay? I mean, i only knew nancy for one year, and she made me one of her bridesmaids.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but i don't have that many friends.
LEADMALE:Are those charles jourdan boots? They're gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:Did you buy them new? is that a fendi bag? are these mizrahi gloves? You know, i'm a little busy now.
SUPFEMALE:Would you come back and envy me in about 10 minutes? Nancy, there's a customer over there that could use some service, and i'm sure his overalls are oshkosh b'gosh.
SUPMALE:We'll gab later.
LEADMALE:Love your earrings.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i just cannot believe that you have been mad at me for 25 years because of my stupid wedding.
LEADMALE:Well, it wasn't just that, it was a whole bunch of other stuff too, you know? You were supposed to go to new york, and then i was gonna follow.
LEADFEMALE:And you were gonna get an apartment.
LEADMALE:I was gonna come live with you, and it was, you know, gonna be like that girl.
OTHERFEMALE:I was only in my early twenties.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know where i was going.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but i was 14 and i believed you.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't thinking.
OTHERMALE:I was very insensitive.
LEADMALE:All right, i was a total butt.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, since you came this far and everything, i'd really like you to come over and meet my family.
OTHERMALE:I've told them all about you, so now would be a good time for you to come and defend yourself.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Jackie would you watch this place? We're gonna leave.
LEADMALE:Okay, you got it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hey.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, are you still married to that same guy? Oh, after everything i put you through, we never even made it to our first anniversary.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I heard.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I heard becky got married.
LEADFEMALE:Any grandchildren yet? Good one.
LEADMALE:Look at us.
SUPFEMALE:Brown's lake, 1967.
LEADMALE:Who's the little boy pulling the shirt over his head? That's jackie.
OTHERMALE:Said we were all gonna do it.
LEADFEMALE:Do you still have the picture of her doing the pantyless cartwheel? Yeah, it's in there someplace.
LEADMALE:Had a lot of great times together, didn't we! Maybe i can find a picture of that mud fight in here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god, is that mud fight gonna haunt me forever.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, remember how upset i got at you for stealing my boyfriend blake? whose old beater's that? That was mine.
SUPFEMALE:Before your mother totaled it.
SUPFEMALE:You totaled a car? Well, it wasn't her fault.
SUPMALE:The cops were chasing her.
LEADFEMALE:The cops were chasing you? Of course, it was a stolen car.
SUPFEMALE:You stole a car? You know, if she had not totaled that car she would have been right across the state line.
LEADMALE:Where were you going? Across the state line, i don't know.
LEADMALE:I was only 13.
SUPFEMALE:How come you never told darlene any of this? Because i was afraid it would bring us together.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you think i was so cool.
LEADMALE:I was nothing more than a ronnie wannabe.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, stop it, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:No, ronnie, it's true.
SUPMALE:You were always somebody who could never settle down.
LEADMALE:I couldn't even make it across the state line, but you made it all the way to new york.
OTHERMALE:I think my problem is that i could never overcome my basic nurturing instinct.
SUPFEMALE:Get the hell out of my chair! I had the urge to roam too, ronnie.
LEADFEMALE:That's why i drove the big rigs.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i think i could've made it out of here too if i hadn't hit that big old wall of love and married him.
OTHERFEMALE:Always had a touch of the wanderlust.
LEADFEMALE:Bit of a loner really.
SUPFEMALE:So, ronnie, uh, what do you do in new york? Well, i'm an editor with american interiors magazine.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:I knew illiteracy wasn't a dominant gene in our family.
SUPMALE:Now now, darlene, you gotta stand in line.
SUPFEMALE:Ronnie was my idol first.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted to get out of lanford and she did.
LEADMALE:I wanted to write children's books and she became the writer.
SUPFEMALE:Yup.
LEADFEMALE:Don't envy me.
LEADMALE:My kind of life's not for everybody.
SUPMALE:Towels are in the bathroom.
SUPMALE:Sheets are in the drawer.
LEADFEMALE:No boys after 11:00.
OTHERFEMALE:That doesn't give me much time.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother didn't describe you properly.
SUPMALE:She said that you were dark and brooding.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, i save that for the immediate family, but i'll make an exception.
LEADMALE:School sucks, i'm bombing out, my future's bleak.
LEADMALE:And yourself? Well, i've just been amusing myself by rifling through your possessions.
LEADMALE:David and i haven't used any of those yet.
LEADFEMALE:We just bought 'em in case our relationship keeps-hey, relax.
LEADMALE:I used to buy them for your mom.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I read this short story of yours, and i think it's really good.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you invaded my privacy like that.
LEADFEMALE:But since you liked it, i'll get over it.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe that you got an f for that.
LEADFEMALE:I really want to be a writer, but i know i'm just gonna rot here.
LEADFEMALE:The great minds of lanford just don't appreciate my stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darlene, don't buy into what those teachers in lanford tell you.
LEADFEMALE:They turn out 7 professionals a year and they all work in the same garage.
SUPMALE:You're the only person that's gotten out of this hell-hole and made it back to tell about it.
SUPMALE:Do you want to know how i did it? I just got into the car and never looked back.
SUPMALE:Aw, i wish i could do that.
OTHERMALE:You know, there's this great writing school in new york that i could go to now if i just took one of those equivalency tests.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, why don't you go after high school? Well, if i wait 'til after high school i will have had all the creativity sucked out of me.
LEADMALE:What would you tell me to do if i was your daughter? Well, if you were my daughter i'd tell you to stay at school and clean your room.
SUPMALE:But if it were me, i'd probably drop out and go for it.
LEADMALE:Well, what would you do for money? Well, first i'd see if i could get into the school and then maybe i'd hit my rich cousin for a loan, and maybe a place to stay.
LEADMALE:You'd do that for me? You're kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, this may depress the hell out of you, but you do remind me of your mother.
LEADFEMALE:You know, in spite of that comment, i'm gonna let you lend me the money.
OTHERMALE:Now, you really remind me of your mother.
LEADMALE:God, dropping out of school, moving to new york you know, maybe you should let me tell my mom about this.
LEADFEMALE:So rare that i get to bring her any good news.
OTHERMALE:Dealer takes two.
LEADMALE:Watch your language, boys.
SUPFEMALE:There's a lady in the room.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, ronnie, this is d.j. 's friend jordan.
SUPFEMALE:Pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:All the rest of my poker buddies had to stay after school.
LEADFEMALE:I got to be going.
LEADFEMALE:My mom wants me home by 5:00.
LEADMALE:What, are you gonna play cards or you gonna listen to your mommy? We're eating dinner at his house tonight.
SUPMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:But i got a straight.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm out 25 cents.
SUPMALE:Ya up for a hand? No way.
LEADFEMALE:Last time i went to vegas i lost a bundle.
LEADMALE:Never actually used that word when it comes to money.
OTHERMALE:What exactly is a bundle? You don't want to know.
SUPMALE:Try me.
OTHERMALE:Well, one night, i lost two grand.
LEADMALE:Good god! On one hand.
SUPMALE:Eee-oh! I'm sorry, i know this sounds like i'm bragging.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, it does, but keep going.
SUPMALE:This is the closest i'm ever gonna come to a vulgar display of wealth.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, where is everybody? I could use a hand out here.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, dear.
LEADMALE:Well, i wasn't going to buy this many groceries, but there was a brand-new girl at the grocery store and she actually took my check.
LEADFEMALE:I wish you'd let me pay for some.
LEADMALE:Oh, nonsense, you're the guest.
OTHERMALE:Only dan and the kids pay.
LEADMALE:Well, at least let me put them away.
OTHERFEMALE:I never get to do this at home.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll be fun! Well, hey, there's a mop up against the fridge there.
LEADMALE:Party down! Extraordinary couple of days.
OTHERFEMALE:First, your cousin turns out to be a decent human being, and, get this, darlene's having trouble in school.
OTHERFEMALE:So what? She's the state's problem from 8:00 to 3:00.
LEADFEMALE:I think they're about to throw her back in our lap.
OTHERMALE:The word failing came up.
SUPFEMALE:I'd say it's time for threats and intimidation.
SUPFEMALE:Well, did you already do it? Not yet.
SUPMALE:I saved it all for you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:It's open.
SUPFEMALE:Hope you're doing your homework.
LEADFEMALE:Hope springs eternal.
LEADMALE:So what's this i hear about something threatening your, uh, solid d average that we're so proud of.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's okay, i got it under control.
LEADMALE:Well, i hope you didn't do nothing to that teacher they can trace back to me.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, i'm not gonna flunk anything, okay? I can still hold my head high in detention.
SUPFEMALE:What's this? what are you sending a money order to the board of education for? It's for my high school equivalency test.
LEADMALE:I need it to go to this writing school.
SUPFEMALE:What writing school? In new york.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? have we met? You don't need to do anything.
LEADMALE:Cousin ronnie said she'd pay for the whole thing and i could stay with her and everything.
LEADFEMALE:God, that is so tacky, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like this family don't look bad enough without you panhandling the relatives.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i didn't ask! she offered! no way! You're not leaving this house until you're 18, and me and your dad are gonna kick you out like we always planned.
LEADMALE:Well, you wanted to get out of lanford when you were my age.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but it's all built up now.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you have to ruin my life? because i lost the coin toss, okay? your dad got d.j. where do i put something called potato buds? why don't you put them through college? what? Yeah, why don't you dangle something real pretty in front of them, encourage them to drop out of school, and then turn them against their parents.
LEADMALE:This isn't about potato buds, is it? You know, dan and me don't like it when people offer our kids money to run away from home.
LEADFEMALE:We feel like if they're gonna run away from home they should save up the money themselves.
OTHERMALE:See, we're trying to instill values here.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i don't mean to criticize your methods, roseanne, but if you are trying to thank me, you're going about it the wrong way.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Let me thank you for going behind my back and filling my daughter's head with all kinds of ideas that i have to run upstairs and say no to.
LEADMALE:Why do you have to say no to her? Maybe it's the best thing for her.
SUPFEMALE:You have known the girl for 10 minutes.
OTHERMALE:How could you possibly know what's best for her? I've lived with her for 50, what's best for her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i wouldn't let that get out, otherwise they'll make you give back your mother of the year award.
SUPFEMALE:Look, maybe you don't know this about darlene, but she wants to be a writer.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, of course she wants to be a writer.
LEADMALE:She's 16 years old and a sophomore in high school.
SUPMALE:Last year she wanted to be a basketball star.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, d.j. wants to be a cowboy.
LEADMALE:You want to run out and buy him a horse? I'm sorry, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i really thought i was doing the right thing, but i'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just go upstairs and tell her the whole thing's off.
OTHERFEMALE:No, you're going up and you're giving her the ideas, and then you go up there and take them away.
SUPFEMALE:You haven't really changed much in 25 years.
LEADFEMALE:While you're up there why don't you just tell d.j. that his horse is dead.
SUPMALE:Come on, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:You just hate the fact that one of your kids looks up to me more than they do to you.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's time you got to know your daughter better.
OTHERMALE:She certainly opens up to strangers.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe she takes after your side of the family.
LEADMALE:Oh, we all know what this is about, don't we? You're just jealous 'cause i made something of myself.
SUPMALE:Yeah, an ass.
OTHERFEMALE:And where do you get that hoity-toity accent anyway? I mean, you're from illinois! You've been talking that way ever since you did that stupid play in high school.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'm sorry i don't have your dulcet tones.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe that i wasted 25 years hating you for something as stupid as a wedding when there's really a very good reason to hate you.
LEADMALE:You're a bitch! i'm a bitch? Ha! I bow to the queen of all bitches.
SUPMALE:Hey, you want to know why i didn't want you to be a bridesmaid at my wedding? Because there wasn't enough tangerine chiffon in the state of illinois to make your dress! Good one.
LEADMALE:You left out your middle name.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, um, i don't have one.
LEADFEMALE:David come on, the school will still accept our applications without our middle name.
LEADMALE:It's maurice.
LEADFEMALE:Thank your parents for me.
SUPMALE:Are you sure your mom doesn't know what we're doing? Nah, she probably thinks we're out having sex.
LEADMALE:Amazing, 'cause i can't imagine it even if i try.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, does this help? Maurice! maurice! I don't know about this, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:The school's all the way in new york.
LEADMALE:Where are we gonna stay? Well, if my mom hasn't completely blown the thing with cousin ronnie, there's always her place.
LEADMALE:You could visit from the shelter on weekends.
OTHERMALE:Roll it down.
LEADMALE:Yes, officer? what are you kids doing in there? We're filling out our applications for college.
OTHERMALE:My mom won't let us do it in the house.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey, let's tell them that you didn't think that your trailer was big enough so you threw a major fit, okay? 'cause the tabloids love when you do that.
SUPFEMALE:How 'bout if we say i threw a cup of tea in your face? You know, it really is exhausting pretending all the time to be this difficult to get along with, isn't it.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like my last piece of gum? Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i've got it.
OTHERMALE:I've got it.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll feed 'em a story that i caught you flirting with tom and then we got into this huge catfight and now you're suing me for half of all my stuff.
LEADMALE:Here, let me help you with that.
SUPMALE:You know, it's been so great being on the show.
LEADMALE:Any of you guys want some coffee? Yeah, i would.
SUPMALE:Make it two.
SUPMALE:Hey, steve! You and andy want some coffee? Collins is making another pot.
OTHERMALE:Coming right up! You know, i was thinking about your credit on the show, and i just don't think "guest star" is important enough, so i was thinking, how 'bout if i put your name above mine in the titles? Oh, please.
SUPMALE:Don't even bother about it.
LEADMALE:Just leave it off if you don't have the room.
SUPMALE:In fact, you know what? Don't even pay me.
LEADMALE:Anyone for cream?
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:$575.
SUPMALE:What is this, the price is wrong? lower! lower! hundreds of dollars lower, you idiot! yeah, i mean, where does she shop for jukeboxes? Lower! higher! lower, you mouth-breathing pinhead! lower! higher! Well, look at that.
LEADFEMALE:If it wasn't for unemployment and bomb threats called into the school, the two of you would have no quality time together.
SUPMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Time for the showcase showdown.
OTHERMALE:Oh, take the second showcase.
SUPMALE:Everybody knows the first one sucks.
SUPMALE:God, i'd be so good on this show, dan.
OTHERMALE:And they always pick people just like me-you know, real cute and bubbly-like.
SUPFEMALE:That's why i picked you, mommy.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, get the hose.
LEADFEMALE:So how'd your interview go? Guess.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you got the job and it pays great? Lower.
SUPMALE:You got the job and it don't pay great.
LEADFEMALE:Lower.
SUPMALE:You went berserk and killed the interviewer, and now you're gonna be on america's most wanted.
SUPMALE:Higher.
OTHERMALE:You didn't get the job.
LEADMALE:Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding! Hey, rosie.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi, dan.
SUPMALE:Hey, darlene, cool bomb threat, huh? I got a favor to ask.
LEADMALE:We're gonna take this little trip, and i was wondering if you guys'd watch the house.
SUPMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:What are neighbors for? where you headed? Well, we're taking the motor home to branson, missouri, the country music capital of the world.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you guys are so lucky.
OTHERFEMALE:We never get to go anyplace.
SUPMALE:We ought to pack up our truck and go over to your house.
LEADFEMALE:Nah.
LEADFEMALE:It would just be too hard to unwind when we got back.
SUPMALE:Darlene, if you're going in the kitchen, why don't you and ty make a list of things for d.j. to do? Hey, ty, yeah, you might as well go ahead and kill your pets and your plants now.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, well, you want to talk about it? Oh, honey, i ain't no damn good at these interviews.
SUPFEMALE:I get too nervous.
LEADMALE:The guy asked me if i had any hobbies.
LEADMALE:I panicked and said, "drinking.
LEADMALE:" well, you know what they say, dan-looking for a job is the hardest job you'll ever have.
SUPMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:I need a vacation.
LEADFEMALE:That's not a bad idea.
LEADFEMALE:Let's do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, honey, i can't run away from my problems.
SUPMALE:You sure can.
LEADMALE:Your problems are here.
OTHERMALE:We'll just go someplace else.
OTHERMALE:It's easy.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:It's not like we all don't deserve it.
LEADMALE:Well, as long as it's not europe again.
LEADMALE:Well, actually, i was thinking about someplace that's really, really warm, and where knowing the price of cheerios can get you a brand-new car.
OTHERFEMALE:That's crazy, honey.
SUPMALE:We can't afford to go to california.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Ty's going.
LEADFEMALE:No, he's not.
SUPMALE:Give me a minute.
LEADFEMALE:So, ty, i guess you're gonna pack up a lot of your warmest clothes to go down to branson there, since it's real cold there this time of year.
LEADFEMALE:It's no colder than here.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how come you didn't think of, like, you know, going to california, where it's really warm, you know? And they got really cool stuff there, like disneyland and the crystal cathedral and bob barker.
LEADFEMALE:You know, charlotte and i begged him to go there, not stupid branson.
LEADMALE:Well, i think you girls would probably like it in branson, 'cause there's a lot of, you know, musicians down there, and they have their days free, and they'd probably really like making little friends like you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i wouldn't let my daughters go there, but hey, that's just me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i read that jerry lee lewis lives down there.
LEADFEMALE:Look, guys, i got nothing against california, necessarily, but it's just too far for me to drive all by myself.
LEADFEMALE:California, here i come right back where we started from open up your golden gate california here we come you feeling any better, ty? Oh, i don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I think i ate something real bad.
LEADMALE:Well, it's your own fault.
LEADMALE:It's not like truck stops are known for their clams.
LEADMALE:Give the guy a break, roseanne.
SUPMALE:You've been known to play a little seafood roulette in your day.
LEADMALE:See food? Hang on there, ty.
SUPFEMALE:Deej, don't bother ty.
LEADFEMALE:Go up front and bother your dad for a while.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, son.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of bug was that? I don't know, deej.
LEADMALE:Did we hit it or did it fly into us? I'm not sure, son.
LEADMALE:He did seem kind of depressed before he hit the windshield.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? That's the air conditioner switch.
LEADMALE:Okay, deej, go back and bother your mom for awhile.
LEADMALE:Mom, can you make me a tuna sandwich? I lost my other one.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, could you get me another can of tuna out of the cupboard, please? Now, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Which one's the cupboard, which one's the den? Hurry up, i'm starving.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , do you mind? I'm working on three inches of formica here.
OTHERFEMALE:Gotta finish this and darlene's salad, jackie's grilled cheese and your dad's bologna sandwich.
LEADMALE:Hey, skip the bologna.
SUPMALE:I'll take some of that tuna.
OTHERMALE:I've gotta use up the bologna, dan, otherwise d.j. will have no place to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you know what i feel like? Some hot cocoa.
SUPFEMALE:Can we have some hot cocoa? No, no cocoa.
LEADFEMALE:Geez, what kind of a vacation is this for me? All you've done is take everything i do at home and just put it on wheels.
OTHERMALE:Well, hop sing quit.
LEADFEMALE:You in charge now.
OTHERMALE:Great, now one of us has to make lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you two flip for it? Charlotte will do it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
LEADMALE:She just tells you to do something and you do it? Well, i don't really mind.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i do this stuff at home all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Let me explain something to you, charlotte.
OTHERMALE:You're the older sister.
LEADFEMALE:That means you get to treat her like garbage.
SUPMALE:It's your birthright.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but that's not how this family works.
SUPMALE:No, that's how all families work.
LEADMALE:Becky got to treat me bad, i got to take it out on d.j. , and d.j. gets to take it out on society as a whole.
SUPMALE:I think i'm going to go see if dad wants some tea.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
OTHERMALE:You two are so screwed up.
LEADFEMALE:We are not.
OTHERMALE:Oh, please, why do you think she eats so much and you'll sleep with any guy who gives you a little attention? Go shove it, darlene.
LEADMALE:Where the hell do you get so much insight? Trust me.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Well, everybody's all wedged in for the night.
OTHERFEMALE:So cute the way darlene falls asleep with her hands around d.j. 's neck.
LEADMALE:Isn't this great, honey? just you and me on the open road? Yeah, it's pretty cool.
SUPFEMALE:Look at all those little houses out there.
LEADMALE:You ever wonder what kind of people live there and what they're doing right now? I know what they're doing right now.
SUPMALE:They're wondering why the hell they bought houses so damn close to the freeway.
SUPFEMALE:You know who lives in those houses? People just like us.
SUPMALE:Each one of those little houses has its own becky and darlene.
LEADMALE:Its own d.j. how come they still get to have a becky? I guess their little bike shops are doing well.
LEADMALE:Boy, stuff sure has changed, hasn't it? remember that big plan i worked out when we first got married? Yeah.
LEADMALE:What was that again? I think it was, "we'll get by.
LEADMALE:" oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What ever happened to that? Hey, come on, we're doing okay.
LEADMALE:You've got your restaurant now.
LEADMALE:It's doing good.
LEADMALE:Making money.
LEADMALE:Let's have a baby.
OTHERFEMALE:What? are you serious? since when do you want to have another kid? Well, i was just thinking about how much fun it was when the kids were little.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but then they get big, remember? I'm not getting burned on that deal again.
LEADMALE:So what are you saying? we're never gonna have any more children? Maybe i am.
LEADFEMALE:Are you the only one that can decide that? you got a uterus? Well, that's pretty damn unfair.
LEADMALE:I don't see why we can't do this.
SUPMALE:Kids take money, dan, okay? And we don't have that much of it.
LEADMALE:If we did, you think we'd be driving cross-country with our neighbor's toilet? Hey, when we had our first kid, things were tough.
OTHERFEMALE:We didn't have any trouble making that decision.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't make that decision, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Jose cuervo did.
LEADMALE:What a coincidence.
OTHERFEMALE:He's the same guy that proposed to you.
SUPFEMALE:Glad you're feeling better.
LEADMALE:I don't think i'da gotten through it without you.
LEADMALE:Oh, all you needed was a little tlc.
LEADFEMALE:You drive real good.
LEADMALE:Thanks, i used to do this professionally.
OTHERFEMALE:I can tell.
SUPMALE:I keep watching your eyes, and they never leave the road.
LEADFEMALE:They are so brown.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:It's funny, isn't it? traveling around in a motor home? I mean, this is the first time i ever spent the night with a woman that i didn't actually date first.
LEADFEMALE:That's funny.
LEADFEMALE:It is.
LEADMALE:That is funny.
OTHERMALE:Could we get some drinks up here? I got it.
LEADMALE:Boy, i think my dad and your aunt jackie are really hitting it off.
OTHERMALE:Wouldn't it be bizarre if they got married? Yeah, then we'd be cousins and we live next door to each other so we could share clothes and talk on the phone and do each other's hair.
LEADFEMALE:Die, dwarf.
OTHERFEMALE:Who wants more peas? you mean some more baby peas? some of those cute little baby peas? I'd love some more baby peas.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, even though you're done, that doesn't mean i don't want any more baby peas.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, i'd like some more baby peas.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you'll have baby peas when i tell you you're good and ready to have baby peas.
SUPFEMALE:All right, then, carrots.
OTHERFEMALE:What the hell are we talking about? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Hey, deej.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, vic.
SUPFEMALE:Oh my god, who the hell are you? I met him at the last truck stop.
LEADMALE:I let him use our bathroom, and i guess i forgot he was in there.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , what were you thinking? you guys got any tobacco? Jackie, pull over.
SUPMALE:We gotta let somebody out.
LEADMALE:No, no, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:We can't just dump him in the middle of the desert.
LEADMALE:Where you headed, buddy? Anywhere over the border would be fine.
LEADMALE:Jackie, pull over.
LEADFEMALE:Was just a joke.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're out of here, buddy.
LEADMALE:Hold on, i'm gonna check his bag.
SUPMALE:Make sure he didn't take anything.
OTHERMALE:You better hope you're clean, mister.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how do we compare to other families you've killed? You know, ma'am, you might not believe this, but i used to be just like you people.
SUPFEMALE:Oh yeah, i had a family, wife, kids, home.
SUPFEMALE:Whole deal.
OTHERMALE:Then i lost my job, wife took the kids.
LEADMALE:Things started going to hell, and i find myself here.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, ty, why don't you go ahead and start driving for a while.
LEADMALE:Got it.
OTHERMALE:I don't think it would hurt nothing to have you ride with us for a little bit.
OTHERMALE:Can i get you something to eat? Well, yeah, i'd appreciate that.
SUPMALE:Do you know where your family is now? Nah, i was lying about the family and the job.
OTHERMALE:My problem's always been the liquor and the pills.
LEADFEMALE:Ty, pull over the next exit.
SUPFEMALE:He's getting out.
OTHERMALE:He's clean, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Very well organized.
LEADMALE:Well, putting 8 people in a 20-foot space together for 5 days seemed like a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:What went wrong? Well, for one thing, you've put me in a motor home with a man who hasn't had a woman in 15 years.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, can you just keep your distance from him? It's not like i don't try.
SUPFEMALE:Y'know, yesterday i almost lost him at the sink.
SUPFEMALE:Just deal with it, okay? I have my own problems.
LEADMALE:Like, for instance, dan's driving me crazy about having another kid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is great.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have four kids before i even have one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, for your information, i'm thinking about getting a cat.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i didn't say i was gonna do it.
LEADFEMALE:'course, i didn't say i wasn't gonna do it, either.
SUPFEMALE:What's that mean? Well, i'm thinking about it, you know.
SUPMALE:I've got a whole bunch of experience.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, i'd do things different this time.
OTHERFEMALE:Like, for instance, i wouldn't teach this kid to talk.
LEADMALE:You really think you should do this? Jackie, look at the three kids i've already raised.
SUPFEMALE:Don't i deserve a shot at a good one? Well, good news.
LEADFEMALE:I called home and nobody answered.
OTHERMALE:Everything okay at the diner? That's the better news.
OTHERMALE:You know that job you didn't get? You got it.
SUPMALE:The guy left a message at the diner that their first choice fell through.
SUPMALE:Congratulations, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You're second best.
LEADFEMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and it's steady drywall work with medical benefits and everything so now we can finally afford to get one of them expensive illnesses we talked about.
LEADFEMALE:And i was thinking since we'll have two incomes, that maybe i'll talk about that baby thing you want.
SUPMALE:I'm not taking the job, roseanne.
SUPMALE:What do you mean you're not taking the job? Just what i said.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not taking the job.
LEADMALE:Here you've been dragging around the house for a whole month complaining how you ain't got no work, then you start with that baby talk and get my eggs all in an uproar.
SUPMALE:You are taking that job, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not taking the job just 'cause you want a baby.
LEADMALE:I want a baby? You're the one that started the whole baby thing.
LEADMALE:I don't want a baby anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, i'm glad that you made up your mind before somebody said here comes the head.
SUPMALE:I don't want to talk about this anymore, okay? Let's drop it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i do.
SUPFEMALE:I said let's drop it! What the hell's wrong with you? why the hell did you say you wanted to have a baby? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe i thought having a baby would make me happy.
SUPMALE:I could have just as easily said a new car or a pool table.
LEADMALE:Maybe i just needed something to look forward to.
LEADMALE:What, and getting paid to be out of the house eight hours a day isn't enough for ya? Not drywall.
SUPMALE:Well, you don't have to do it forever.
LEADMALE:You could just do it until something better comes along.
OTHERMALE:There's guys there that have been doing the same thing for 30 years waiting for something better to come along.
LEADMALE:I lose my bike shop, the first thing i do is go back to drywall.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, what do you really want to do? Roseanne, there's a theme here.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you're scaring me.
LEADFEMALE:You think you're scared? Well, wherever it is that you don't know where the hell you're going to, you know that i'm right there behind ya.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Still want to have a baby? I don't know, now you've got me thinking about a pool table.
OTHERFEMALE:God, i can't believe it, dan.
SUPMALE:You didn't get me no tickets to price is right.
SUPFEMALE:How was i supposed to know you had to get tickets six months in advance? Besides, you love this jackie thomas guy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but i can watch that on tv.
OTHERMALE:I want to go someplace where i can win something.
LEADMALE:Least you got to fulfill the kids' dream of going to disneyland.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i love that.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene versus the happiest place on earth.
LEADMALE:Hey, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? how you doing, folks? I'm jackie thomas, as you know.
SUPMALE:Welcome to my show.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna get started here in a couple of minutes, but i'd like to get to know you guys a little bit better.
LEADMALE:Sir, what's your name? Bill.
LEADMALE:Bill, nice haircut, buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:What'd you do, lose a bet or something? No, i was in a car accident and before they could operate on my skull, they had to shave my head.
OTHERMALE:Whatever.
LEADMALE:You know what's your name, partner? Dan conner.
LEADFEMALE:Dan conner.
LEADMALE:Where are you from, dan? Lanford, illinois.
OTHERMALE:Lanford, illinois.
LEADMALE:Is this your lovely wife, here? Yes, i am.
SUPFEMALE:How long you been married, ma'am? Well, next month it will be 20 years.
SUPFEMALE:Tell us, what's the secret to a marriage like that? Lack of imagination.
LEADFEMALE:Lack of imagination.
SUPMALE:That's funny.
SUPMALE:I myself have never been married.
LEADFEMALE:I've been working on my career too hard.
LEADMALE:It hasn't always been this good for me, either.
LEADFEMALE:I used to do a lot of lousy jobs.
LEADFEMALE:I washed dishes, i worked in a meat packing plant.
LEADMALE:I did everything short of drywall.
LEADMALE:It was pretty ugly.
LEADMALE:But now i'm a big star and i can make anybody do anything i want.
LEADFEMALE:Who here wants to do something really stupid for a real lame prize? He does! Yeah, he does impressions.
LEADMALE:Impressions? dan? Get up here and do one of your impressions.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, go do your impressions.
LEADMALE:Come on up here, dan.
LEADMALE:All right, danny.
LEADFEMALE:Impressions, huh? who do you do? Umum mr.
LEADMALE:Howell from gilligan's island.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Howell from gilligan's island.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'll help you out, here.
OTHERMALE:I'll be the skipper.
LEADMALE:"how you doing, little buddy?" "smashing, lovey.
LEADFEMALE:" that's pretty darn good.
LEADFEMALE:Yay! Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Hey, do you do anybody else? Yeah, i guess a little brando.
SUPFEMALE:Brando.
LEADMALE:"i'd like to thank the heads of the five families "for coming here this evening.
SUPMALE:How did we ever get this far?" thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
SUPMALE:Hey, you know what? If you liked this one, you'll love this one.
LEADMALE:This is a little character of mine.
LEADFEMALE:Real nutty little guy named travis bickle from a movie called taxi driver.
LEADMALE:And that goes a little something like this.
SUPFEMALE:"are you talking to me? "are you talking to me? Hey, are you talking to me?" thank you very much.
SUPMALE:Had a steamboat, the steamboat had a bell miss lucy went to heaven, the steamboat went to all right, that's good.

LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:David? Oh, man.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna, like, read me a poem or something, are you? Darlene, help me.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing here? It's, like, 2 in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Is that what you sleep in? Well, my pasties and g-string are in the wash.
LEADMALE:All right, look.
SUPFEMALE:I have something to say to you, and it's really important that you don't interrupt me.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, let me guess.
SUPMALE:"darlene, you just don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:It's different for boys.
LEADFEMALE:It's gotta be now, i tell you.
OTHERFEMALE:Now.
LEADFEMALE:" my parents are getting divorced.
LEADFEMALE:My dad left this morning with lisa and nicky.
LEADMALE:Mom wants us to move back to michigan.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna leave you.
SUPMALE:So i think you and me should go to new york now.
LEADMALE:I mean, if this is too much of a rush, i can come back in a couple hours.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:David, we can't just leave.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you're the one who wanted to get out of lanford.
SUPMALE:Well, that was after we got into art school.
LEADMALE:What's the difference? You're right.
LEADFEMALE:What was i thinking? We'll just show up to a new york bus station with no money.
SUPFEMALE:The only thing we have left to figure out is who's gonna play me in darlene, portrait of a teenage runaway.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, you hate it here.
SUPMALE:Give me one good reason not to run away.
SUPMALE:Well, it'd make it a lot harder to look down on becky.
OTHERMALE:At least she had the guts to go off with my brother.
LEADMALE:You obviously don't give a damn about me.
LEADMALE:Ooh, i hope you don't double dog dare me.
LEADFEMALE:Then i'll have to go.
SUPMALE:Fine, i'll go to new york myself.
LEADMALE:I can't live with my mother, not without my father there.
LEADFEMALE:What, so that's it? you're just leaving? what do you care? Hey, i care! No, you don't.
OTHERMALE:Of course, i do! i love you! Jerk.
SUPFEMALE:Really? are you sure? Yeah, i'm sure you're a jerk.
LEADFEMALE:No, i mean not-wow.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you ever say it before? Hopin' it'd pass.
LEADMALE:So then are we going, or what? Wait a minute, david.
OTHERMALE:This is, like, a big commitment.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're talking about living together.
LEADFEMALE:We haven't even slept together yet.
LEADMALE:Well shut up.
LEADMALE:Hey, can i talk to you? Sure, i'll try anything once.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well.
OTHERFEMALE:Never mind.
SUPMALE:Whoa whoa.
LEADFEMALE:What am i missing here? Oh, it's no big deal.
SUPMALE:We'll talk about it later.
LEADFEMALE:If you can talk about it with your mother, you can talk about it with me.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I need more tampons.
LEADMALE:What do you think? I don't think that's it.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, if i was gonna ask for something really big, you'd want me to just, like, come out and say it, right? I don't know.
LEADMALE:If you're gonna ask for something big, i might wanna see a dance first.
LEADFEMALE:Well, david's parents are getting divorced, and he's supposed to move to michigan with his mom.
LEADMALE:And i was wondering, can he move in with us? darlene, if we were gonna say "no" to something big, you'd want us to come right out and say it, right? well, why not? I mean, he can sleep on the couch, and he'll get a job and pitch in, and he wasn't raised by you guys, so he's real well-behaved.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:The answer's no.
LEADMALE:You don't know how much this means to me.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, david's the reason i came out of my mood last year and stopped being so difficult.
LEADFEMALE:You stopped being difficult? well, why didn't you tell us? We would've had a party.
LEADFEMALE:All right, but i'm a lot better than i was.
SUPMALE:And we're not sleeping together, so you don't have to worry about that.
SUPMALE:It's just that i love him.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop looking at me.
SUPFEMALE:And the fact that i'm sharing my feelings with you when i'd rather gouge my eyes out should prove that i'm being sincere.
OTHERMALE:Well, what does david's mother think of this? Mrs.
LEADMALE:Healy's for it.
LEADMALE:She's gonna have a hard enough time supporting herself.
LEADMALE:She also wants him to finish high school with his friends.
SUPMALE:Okay, darlene, you've made your point.
SUPMALE:Now me and your dad will discuss it.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:I just wanna say that i know this is the sort of thing that typical parents would object to.
SUPMALE:I've always thought you guys were cooler than typical parents.
SUPMALE:No, seriously.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:God bless you.
LEADMALE:Chair recognizes the cute guy in the overalls.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:How long should we pretend to discuss this before we go out and tell her no? You've gotta admire her technique, though.
SUPMALE:That stuff with telling us how cool we are and everything.
LEADMALE:And that stuff about sharing her feelings, man, that was reminiscent of the great becky conner.
SUPMALE:This is her first boyfriend, rosie.
OTHERFEMALE:It's gonna be really rough.
LEADMALE:I know that, dan, but, gee, we can't fix everything.
OTHERFEMALE:It'd be nice to fix one thing once.
SUPMALE:We just can't afford it.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, you never know about kids.
LEADMALE:What if he starts demanding things? like food? I can't believe his mother's okay with this.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, do you think she's cooler than us? Of course she's okay.
SUPFEMALE:She's got the boy.
LEADFEMALE:It's the girl's parents who do all the suffering.
LEADMALE:Well, i just cannot stand the idea that in a couple of years, d.j. will be out there making some other parent's life a living hell.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How was work? All right.
SUPMALE:We really nailed mom.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Did she cry? There's this guy, he comes in every day, he orders the same thing, he never leaves a tip.
LEADFEMALE:So today, roseanne wrote a note to him from "mom" that says, "i want your body.
SUPFEMALE:" not my rosie.
LEADFEMALE:That's crazy talk! So, this time when the guy leaves, he leaves mom this huge tip, and on the way out, she says, "please, come again.
SUPMALE:" and he says, "sure thing, sweet cheeks," and slaps her on the butt.
SUPFEMALE:It was a hoot! Good ol' bev.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, how ya doin'? Pretty good.
SUPMALE:The greatest thing in the world happened with mom today.
OTHERMALE:You won't believe it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? what happened? Well, there's this old guy that comes in every day, you know, and he always orders the same thing, and he never, ever leaves a tip.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, is he asking for it.
LEADMALE:So i wrote him this note today from "mom" that says, "i want your body.
LEADMALE:" ha! I can't wait to hear the end.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie already told you, didn't she? yeah, but i never really understood-jackie! what? you told dan my day again! one good thing happens, and you have to come home and tell him before i can! it's my day, too, you know! that doesn't matter! he's my husband! i have been married to him for 19 years! it is hard enough to think of something to say to him! well, what am i supposed to talk to people about? We're together every minute of the day! we have the same damn life! Maybe this is a bad time.
LEADMALE:No, it's always like this.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, david.
SUPMALE:Why don't you guys sit down.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk for a couple of minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, david, you know dan and i really like you.
SUPFEMALE:We like you a lot more than we like your brother mark.
OTHERFEMALE:Probably more than we even like darlene.
LEADMALE:But there's just no way we can do this.
SUPMALE:This totally sucks.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you know, we totally feel for your situation, but it's just we don't let anybody grow up here unless we're forced to by law.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, i have to go.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't over.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it is, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm really sorry, david.
SUPFEMALE:I'll talk to you later, darlene.
SUPMALE:Thank you for thinking about it, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:You have no idea what you've done.
LEADMALE:You don't think i know? what are the odds of you bringing home another boy i'm gonna like? don't you care that i'm never gonna see him again? Oh, it's only a couple of years.
SUPMALE:Michigan's not that far away.
SUPMALE:He's not going to michigan.
OTHERFEMALE:He's running away.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he's not that stupid.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he is.
LEADFEMALE:You have no idea how stupid he is.
SUPMALE:Hey, mom.
SUPMALE:Hey, d.j. how was your day? Not great.
SUPMALE:Although this one really cool thing happened with your grandma today.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean the old guy hit her on the butt? Great story.
SUPMALE:Coming.
LEADMALE:Uh, barbara healy? yeah? Yeah, i'm roseanne conner.
LEADMALE:You know, a couple of our kids are married, a couple of our kids are dating.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene's not here.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know, but i was at the grocery store around the corner, and i knew where you guys lived, and i thought i should come over 'cause i wanna talk to you.
LEADMALE:Sure, what the hell.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe we would've met at becky and mark's wedding if either one of us had been invited.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe we'll both be there for the divorce.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that'd be nice.
SUPMALE:Uh, listen, i wanna talk to you about david, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Umi think he might be getting ready to run away.
SUPFEMALE:What, are you kidding me? No, and i feel really responsible, too, because i know that you wanted dan and me to take him in.
LEADFEMALE:Take him in? i wanted you to take him in? what the hell are you talking about? David! david! Oh, man.
LEADMALE:You didn't even know anything about this, did you? Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:What is all this crap about you running away? and who said it was okay with me for you to move into her house? And don't lie to me! Oh, i'm not running away.
LEADFEMALE:And moving into her house was just an idea.
LEADMALE:We didn't think it would hurt to ask.
LEADMALE:So you were gonna abandon me just like your father did.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, could you leave us alone, please? No.
SUPFEMALE:I want her to stay here so you can tell her you're sorry for being such a pathetic little liar.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he doesn't have to do that, barbara.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, he does.
LEADMALE:I want you to see what kind of ungrateful garbage i've raised! Hey, i don't mean to interfere here, but, you know, the kids, they just took a shot at staying together.
OTHERMALE:It's not like it's the worst thing in the world.
SUPMALE:Oh, you don't think so? No, it's not even the worst thing darlene's done today.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to me.
LEADMALE:I don't want you butting in, telling me how to raise my kids.
SUPFEMALE:Take a look at the two little whores you raised.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i'm in this now.
SUPMALE:You know, if your kid wasn't here, i would take the opportunity to remind you that people who live in glass whorehouses shouldn't throw stones.
LEADMALE:It's people like you that give white trash a bad name.
LEADMALE:Mom, please just stop it.
OTHERMALE:It's over, okay? I'm not going anywhere.
LEADMALE:I promise.
SUPMALE:I'd love to see you try and run away.
LEADMALE:You think you could live without me? you think you could survive for two minutes out there in that world unless i was taking care of you? You are worthless! you are a worthless little bastard! Okay, i'm changing my mind.
LEADFEMALE:David, you can come live with us if you want to.
LEADFEMALE:Are you trying to steal my kid? This has nothing to do with stealing anything.
LEADFEMALE:Whether he runs away or comes and lives at my place, he is not gonna stay here with you.
LEADMALE:That's not true, is it, honey? I wanna live with them.
SUPMALE:Look, you know that i don't mean it when i do this, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I just-i'm going through a tough time now, okay? I won't talk like that again, i'll never say it again.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you love me? I can't keep doing this.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out now! Okay.
LEADMALE:Now! Come on, david.
LEADFEMALE:We'll get your stuff later.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go home.
SUPMALE:Well, it's a boy! You're moving in? how did this happen? Well, darlene, it's a real long story.
LEADFEMALE:But you both got what you wanted, so welcome to our family, david.
SUPMALE:You're both grounded.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mom.
SUPFEMALE:So, david, you're moving in.
LEADMALE:Welcome to our little home.
OTHERFEMALE:Our tiny, little, cramped, little home.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, can i talk to you for a second, please? Why, jackie, i'd love to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:We don't spend nearly enough time together.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's been quite a month, but i'm leaving.
OTHERMALE:Here are my house keys.
LEADFEMALE:Front door, back door, dead bolt.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you've had those keys for nine years.
LEADMALE:It was symbolic.
LEADMALE:You know, it's natural to feel a little jealous when we bring a new person into the house.
SUPMALE:But you know dan and i, we love you just as much as we ever did.
LEADMALE:And you know what? You can be my little helper.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna start packing.
OTHERMALE:Until i find an apartment, i will be at mom's, which should tell you how desperate i am.
LEADMALE:Tag, you're it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Where you been? Uh, well, dan, i wouldn't ordinarily do this without you, buti went and had another kid.
LEADMALE:Is david out there? you mean dan, junior? Not funny, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, it's a little funny.
OTHERMALE:No, roseanne.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:We're not doing this.
LEADMALE:You told him he could live here, you can go back out there and tell him you made a mistake.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, dan, but i can't do that.
SUPFEMALE:So now the kids get whatever they want.
LEADFEMALE:Becky gets married, david moves in with darlene.
LEADMALE:Hey, why don't we let d.j. go on that all-sugar diet he's been pushing? Well, i didn't do it for darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:She's the last person i wanna make happy.
SUPFEMALE:I did it for david.
SUPMALE:I couldn't leave him there.
SUPFEMALE:That's what you said when we found that lost puppy on the highway.
LEADMALE:I don't this to wind up like that.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't wanna have to put david to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i saw what david lives with, and i just couldn't leave him there.
SUPMALE:He deserves to move in with a stable family.
OTHERMALE:Gee, could i come, too? You just don't understand, dan.
LEADMALE:His mother is really messed up.
LEADMALE:That doesn't make the kid our responsibility.
LEADFEMALE:No, i don't mean messed up like we're messed up.
SUPMALE:I mean bad.
SUPFEMALE:Really, really, really, incredibly bad.
SUPFEMALE:I grew up in a house like that.
OTHERFEMALE:That bad, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, man.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, dan, i'll make this up to you.
SUPMALE:You're my husband, and i love you, and i'm willing to throw jackie out for you.
SUPFEMALE:You'd do that for me? Consider it done.
OTHERMALE:Oh, look, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Our kids are necking.
LEADMALE:So, did you guys talk about it? Yeah, it's cool.
LEADMALE:Thank you, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess i'll show you your room in the basement.
SUPMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:First of all, there will be no holding hands.
SUPFEMALE:There will be no looks across the room.
SUPMALE:There will be no touchy-feely, there will be no hanky-panky, there will be no smoochie-woochie.
LEADFEMALE:And there will be none of that other stuff you're not supposed to know about.
OTHERMALE:Can we still date? If you want, but i don't see much point.
SUPFEMALE:And, david, while you live here, you'll be home by curfew, you will keep your room clean, you will be the child we've never had.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that's fair.
LEADFEMALE:These are just the rules today.
LEADFEMALE:We reserve the right to change the rules at any time.
SUPFEMALE:For your safety, for your education, orfor our amusement.
SUPMALE:That is the price of living in our kingdom.
LEADMALE:Welcome to roseannadu.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, is david gonna live here now? Yeah, d.j. looks that way.
LEADMALE:Hey, you.
LEADMALE:Just because you're older doesn't mean you get to boss me around.
LEADMALE:It's not how old you are in this house, it's who's been here longer.
SUPMALE:And i put in 12 years.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry, runt.
LEADMALE:David's not gonna boss you around.
LEADMALE:If he wants something, he'll tell me, and i'll boss you around.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, then.
LEADMALE:Now, what's for dinner? Well, in honor of david's first night here, i'm gonna do something that i don't ordinarily do.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna order the pizza myself.
LEADMALE:We always get pizza.
LEADFEMALE:I want hamburgers.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm with the lad.
LEADFEMALE:Hamburgers it is.
SUPMALE:We're getting pizza, spock.
LEADMALE:Well, david, it looks like you're the tie-breaker.
LEADMALE:Um, burger's good.
LEADMALE:My god, i can feel it.
LEADFEMALE:The hormonal balance in this house has shifted.
SUPFEMALE:And the men are victorious! come, men! Let us repair to the living room.
LEADMALE:We shall watch the three stooges and we shall scratch ourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Pizza.
OTHERMALE:I had a really great time tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Can we go out again tomorrow? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Give me a call.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Well, okay, becky, i won't hang up this time if you don't.
LEADFEMALE:So, how's it going? Well, we found a really cool apartment in south minneapolis, and we need to come home this weekend and pick up the rest of my stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you come by the garage sale early enough on saturday, you can get most of it.
LEADMALE:We're only coming back if you agree to some ground rules.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of rules? Number one, no yelling.
LEADFEMALE:Number two, you can't-well, nice talking to you, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, mom.
LEADFEMALE:You said you wouldn't hang up.
LEADMALE:Look, you can have some rules too.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:No eloping.
LEADFEMALE:Mom well, don't come walking in this house like you've won some great, big victory over me and your dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't be expecting our blessing, don't be expecting any money, and don't be expecting.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not, mother.
LEADMALE:Well, you always were a good girl, becky conner.
SUPFEMALE:Becky healy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Becky healy.
LEADMALE:Well, i'd love to stay and chat with you, becky, but i have to slam the phone down now.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Coffeeemaker's broke again.
LEADMALE:Well, so are we, so fix it.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I've done everything i can.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll have to let go.
SUPMALE:I'm pulling the plug.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, you know if i don't get coffee in the morning, i can get cranky.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Just a pinch between your cheek and gum.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's that instant crap i save for company? my god, it's decaf! Who let that into the house? We got to get a new coffeemaker.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, now, we're trying to cut back.
SUPMALE:Oh, did you cancel the cable? Well lucy! No, i didn't cancel it, but it's not like i paid the bill or nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello! God, you're way too happy.
LEADFEMALE:Go out and come back in.
SUPFEMALE:Be nice.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, brought you breakfast.
SUPMALE:Oh, coffee cake.
SUPMALE:Ironic, isn't it? Listen, guys, i'm really sorry to hear about becky.
LEADMALE:Did that come out right? I never know what to say in these situations.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i just feel so uncomfortable.
LEADFEMALE:It's just, like, torture.
LEADMALE:Gee, nance, that's rough.
LEADFEMALE:Let us know if there's anything we can do.
LEADFEMALE:So nancy and are are gonna go down to the mall and find me a dress for the singles dance tonight.
SUPMALE:You want to come along and undermine my self-confidence? Well, how sweet of you to ask me, and i'd love to go, but no, i can't, because becky and mark are gonna come over today.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow! How'd you pull that off? Well, we worked out a truce.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's great, right? That's really great.
LEADMALE:I got some repair work out in the garage.
SUPMALE:What kind of repair work? Couple bikes.
LEADMALE:You have to do it now, when becky and mark are gonna come over? I don't fix 'em, we don't eat.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you are gonna come in and say hi when they come home, aren't you? dan? Whoa.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
SUPMALE:Is he at least talking to you about it? No, he doesn't want to talk to anybody.
SUPFEMALE:He just wants to fix things.
OTHERFEMALE:That is so destructive.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and, you know, it's just the calm before the storm, because when he sees becky, he's going to go ballistic.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, things are gonna get really ugly around here.
LEADMALE:It'll be kind of nice to have everything back to normal.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, is anybody home? Hey, look.
OTHERMALE:It's joanie and chachi.
LEADMALE:How you doin', little brother? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Except thanks to you, now i'm related to my girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:So where's mom? She's in the kitchen with the knives.
LEADMALE:You want me to go in there with you? With the knives.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, why don't you go on to your parents'? By the time you get back, everything will be fine.
SUPMALE:Okay? All right.
SUPFEMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:If you lie very still, she may just sniff you and leave you alone.
LEADFEMALE:Mom? Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Um i'm married.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me too.
SUPMALE:Isn't it fun? so, how are things around here? how do you think? He needed a job.
LEADFEMALE:He had to go.
LEADFEMALE:What was i supposed to do? Well, how about, let him go.
LEADMALE:Do you think he'd drop everything to follow you someplace? Yes, i do.
SUPMALE:You know, it was mark's idea to get married.
SUPMALE:Well, call me old-fashioned, but what's wrong with living in sin? We made the right decision.
SUPMALE:I love him, mother.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure that he loves you? I'm sure.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, mom.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't have to ask me to marry him.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it sure wasn't for my inheritance.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good one.
LEADFEMALE:All right, well, maybe there's a very small chance that this isn't the very worst mistake you're ever gonna make for the rest of your life.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, mom.
OTHERMALE:So what was your wedding like? Well, we went to this justice of the peace, and he did it in his living room, and his wife threw rice at us.
SUPFEMALE:So are those, like, your wedding jeans? 'cause, you know, you might want to save those so you can pass 'em on to your own daughter.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, we just wanted to get married.
LEADFEMALE:It didn't matter.
LEADMALE:It did to me.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i didn't want much.
SUPMALE:I just wanted, like, a cake and some flowers and a band.
SUPFEMALE:And i wanted to be there.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm sorry, mom.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm almost numb, so where is mark? Well, he had to go to his parents' house.
SUPFEMALE:They're giving us some furniture and stuff.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we're gonna give you something too.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding! What? Uh, uh, a coffeemaker.
LEADFEMALE:Feel that? Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:I'd say the rear shocks are gone.
OTHERFEMALE:Definitely the rear shocks.
LEADMALE:We have to rebuild the whole rear section.
SUPFEMALE:Hope the brakes aren't gone too.
LEADMALE:I can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Anytime, son.
LEADMALE:Hi, there.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, you're back! Hi, deej.
SUPFEMALE:Did you bring me anything? No, deej.
SUPFEMALE:I've been a little busy.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Hi, dad.
OTHERMALE:Becky.
LEADFEMALE:So how's it going? Pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? becky? yeah? You're hurting me.
LEADFEMALE:So, dad, um, i just figured we should talk.
SUPMALE:I just want to say that i didn't mean to hurt you.
OTHERMALE:It's just that you never would have let me do it any other way.
LEADMALE:Mark and i really love each other.
SUPMALE:I mean, you know what a great guy he is.
LEADMALE:You were always the one that stuck up for him.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:Dad, i know what you're thinking, but i'm not screwing up my life.
LEADMALE:I mean, mark's got a great job, i'm gonna finish school while he works.
LEADMALE:And hey, i can go to community college in minneapolis just the same as i can here.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom is okay with this.
SUPFEMALE:Why can't you be? Come on! Things were so tough around here.
SUPMALE:I was just another mouth to feed.
SUPFEMALE:I thought i was doing you a favor by leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do me any favors, becky.
SUPMALE:How's it been going? Ask the chicken.
LEADMALE:Yikes! What do you think? it's for the singles dance tonight, so i look too desperate, don't i? No.
SUPFEMALE:You look just desperate enough.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks a lot, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, with all i've been going through, i just don't have the strength to lie to you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you'll meet some really nice guy at the dance.
LEADFEMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:I got a second wind.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, jacks.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look who's here.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, darlene won't let me put the beds next to each other so mark and i can sleep together tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Just so i know, who am i supposed to be mad at? I am not moving to d.j. 's room so she and my dork-in-law can conceive some demon spawn in my bed.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go sit on my bed until morning.
LEADMALE:Mark is my husband, mother.
LEADMALE:We're not gonna stay in this house if we can't sleep together.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Beat the hell out of this chicken, please.
SUPFEMALE:Becky.
LEADFEMALE:Becky! I was hoping that we'd get a moment alone together.
SUPMALE:Before your mother gets back, i know it has been tough, but i just want to tell you, i think it's wonderful that you're starting your life out with somebody, and i wish you guys all the luck in the world, and whatever happens between you and the family or between you and mark, i will always be there for you.
LEADFEMALE:This is my great-grandma harris's wedding ring.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, jackie! She gave this to me before she died.
SUPFEMALE:She made me promise never to tell roseanne that i had it.
LEADMALE:So i want you to put that away somewhere and don't ever let your mother see that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, jackie, this means so much to me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i know.
LEADMALE:I'm really gonna miss you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPFEMALE:But don't you want to save something like this for when you get married? Ohh.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, well, it's becky's last night home, so we're gonna have a happy family time together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERMALE:We're gonna sit here, and we're gonna visit.
SUPFEMALE:Could we visit someone else? I'll get it.
SUPMALE:It's mark.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! oh, i missed you! Mm, we all did.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's okay.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we're just sitting and visiting.
SUPMALE:Are you hungry, honey? Yeah, i could fix you something.
OTHERMALE:No, i ate at my folks'.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks anyway, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Don't call her "mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:" call her "mom.
LEADFEMALE:" she likes that, don't you, mom? well, i guess if i let you call me "mom," why not? Hey, rose um, i'm finished out there.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna wash up and go to bed.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you get anything to eat? I'm all right.
OTHERMALE:Good night, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, i wouldn't, mark.
SUPMALE:It's cool.
OTHERMALE:Mom dan, i think, uh, me and you should talk about this.
SUPMALE:You're in my way.
OTHERMALE:Are you gonna move, or you want me to move you? Come on, mark.
OTHERMALE:It's late.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just go to bed, okay? Dan happy family time is over.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that was real pretty.
SUPMALE:I don't want to talk about it.
SUPFEMALE:Where are they sleeping? I thought you said you didn't want to talk about it.
LEADMALE:Where are they sleeping? They're sleeping in the girls' room, and darlene's going in d.j. 's room.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was either that or let them go to some cheap motel where they'd actually enjoy it.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe you allowed this.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you give me a little bit of time, dan, and no other choice, and i can just be a remarkable woman.
SUPMALE:I got a choice.
LEADMALE:I can go upstairs and put his head through a wall.
LEADFEMALE:Dan okay, i got another choice.
LEADFEMALE:She's 17 years old.
LEADMALE:I throw the punk out, and we get this thing annulled.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And then in 2 months, on her 18th birthday, she goes and does the exact same thing again.
LEADMALE:Only this time she hates us, and we don't see her no more.
LEADFEMALE:So that's your brilliant plan? we do nothing? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that is my plan.
SUPMALE:'cause this way, at least we get birthdays and we get holidays.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we get a phone call once in a while.
LEADFEMALE:But you go up there and you do something stupid, dan, and we will lose her.
LEADFEMALE:No, i wouldn't want to go up there and do something stupid, 'cause god knows she sure didn't! You know what's gonna happen? She's gonna get pregnant, she's gonna forget about school.
SUPMALE:This is it! this is her life! What do you want to happen, dan? you're screaming at me, okay? You're walking around here like some psycho.
SUPFEMALE:What exactly is it that you want to happen? I want my bike shop back.
LEADFEMALE:I want my daughter back.
SUPMALE:I want things back the way they were before i screwed everything up.
LEADFEMALE:So is that what you do out there all day long in that garage? you sit there and blame yourself? well, maybe i do, but you know what? I'm allowed, she's not.
LEADFEMALE:She's not blaming you, dan.
SUPMALE:She's really happy right now.
LEADFEMALE:She's gonna wait until this whole marriage thing goes to hell, and then she'll blame you.
LEADMALE:You've been a great father, dan.
LEADMALE:She's healthy, she's happy, and she can handle herself.
OTHERFEMALE:What more can we expect? Not this.
LEADMALE:I can't go along with this, honey.
LEADMALE:Well, dan, you have to.
SUPFEMALE:We don't have any other choice.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be out in the garage.
LEADMALE:Very funny, darlene! stop jumping on d.j. 's bed! Is this the last one? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:So i guess this is it.
OTHERMALE:Well, why don't you take that box out to the car so i can have a minute with your hubby here.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:Oh, i'll help you.
SUPFEMALE:I got to get to work anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Mark, take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you got safety flares? Yep.
LEADMALE:You got yourself a good man, becky.
LEADMALE:All right, i knew this was coming, so we're too young, i'm not good enough for her, and i got no future.
SUPFEMALE:Eyes on your own paper.
LEADMALE:Look, you're just ticked off at me because you think i made becky marry me.
SUPMALE:Well, let me tell you something-becky doesn't do a damn thing she doesn't want to.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:That's fair enough.
LEADMALE:She got married 'cause she wanted to.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she also wants to finish high school.
OTHERFEMALE:And if she doesn't, i'm gonna know that that's because of you.
OTHERMALE:And she also wants to go to college.
LEADMALE:And if she doesn't do that, then i'm gonna know that that's because of you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna take care of her, okay? So just back off.
LEADFEMALE:Foolish boy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you know nothing of my powers, do you? See, i'm not just some royal pain in your butt anymore.
OTHERMALE:I'm your mother-in-law.
LEADMALE:You think i've made your life difficult so far? Well, now i'm family, and you've seen the way i treat my family.
LEADFEMALE:All packed.
SUPFEMALE:Are we ready? Yeah, we are now.
LEADMALE:D.j. , darlene, get down here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be in the car.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Does dad know we're leaving? Yeah, he knows.
LEADFEMALE:Your sister's leaving.
LEADMALE:See ya.
LEADMALE:I hope you know how hard that was for him.
LEADMALE:Take it easy.
LEADMALE:You too.
LEADMALE:I'll miss you.
OTHERFEMALE:Will you call? Promise.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, becky.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, darlene.
OTHERMALE:Did you ever know that you're my hero? You are the wind beneath my wings.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Knock it off.
LEADMALE:See ya, bubble butt.
SUPMALE:Later, morticia.
OTHERMALE:Okay, well, call me as soon as you get there, and then every hour after that.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Um, do you remember my great-grandmother harris? Well, she gave me her wedding ring, and, um, i would like for you to have it.
LEADMALE:But you can never, ever let aunt jackie see it.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, mom.
SUPMALE:Say good-bye to dad for me, okay? Bye-bye, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, becky.
OTHERMALE:They're gonna call as soon as they get in.
LEADFEMALE:She's gonna take a high-school equivalency test, you know, and then she can start junior college mid-year.
LEADFEMALE:She says they got a pretty nice apartment.
SUPMALE:I think he'll take good care of her.
SUPMALE:He's making really good money, and he's really afraid of me.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Morning, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Hi, david.
LEADFEMALE:Just get up? Uh-huh.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i guess sometimes when you wake up, you still think you're in your old house, huh? Must be hard to break out of your old routine.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i guess.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, these are my underwear.
SUPFEMALE:You really don't have to wash these.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey! It's just laundry to me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mind.
LEADMALE:I'm a professional.
SUPFEMALE:I never want to embarrass you, david.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Hey, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be out buying me an anniversary present.
LEADMALE:I'm still looking.
LEADMALE:I want to be sure i get you something you've always wanted.
SUPFEMALE:Can you get me into the witness relocation program? Trust me.
LEADFEMALE:I will get you something nice.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, 20 years, that's a biggie.
LEADMALE:David, did you know-no, jackie, he doesn't know what we want for our anniversary.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i thought maybe something might just pop out of his head.
SUPMALE:What? Nothing.
SUPMALE:What do you got planned for the big event? Oh, it's gonna be so great.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna go all out this time, you know? We're starting with a really romantic prime rib dinner and everything, because, you know, the 20th anniversary is the red meat and liquor anniversary.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know what you're getting him yet? Well, it's kind of hard to surprise him with a gift when i give him a gift every single day.
LEADMALE:You know, the magic that is me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We keep waiting for you to run out of that.
LEADMALE:Anyway, i did have this one idea for a gift.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on! Embarrassing is good.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Well you know how, like, this year i'm kind of thinner, you know, on account of when i lost my appetite working around food all the time and you and mom? and so i thought i'd get one of those boudoir photos, you know? is that completely nuts? No, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought they cost too much.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I've been doing real good at saving my money, and i've been stealing your tips.
SUPFEMALE:His own private centerfold.
SUPMALE:Dan must have been a very good boy this year.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, he's been with the company for 20 years now.
SUPFEMALE:And this is kind of like his gold watch, you know.
LEADMALE:Plus, it'll get him all hot and everything.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha ha! ha ha ha ha! Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Do you guys know i'm here? Jeez, david, i didn't know you were such a sensitive kid.
OTHERMALE:Well, he sure is, jackie, and you've embarrassed him.
SUPFEMALE:Just look at his face.
LEADMALE:Nice camouflage, zit boy.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha! Hey, what you doing? I'm wrapping your present from d.j. awesome.
SUPFEMALE:What'd he get us? Well, if i tell you that, then you might tell d.j. , and then he wouldn't be surprised.
LEADFEMALE:This is something that you can open now.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! A gift certificate to maury's big and tall.
LEADMALE:So you can get a new sportcoat for your anniversary dinner.
SUPMALE:Heh! A man with 2 jackets.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be the talk of the town.
OTHERMALE:I don't know how to thank you except to ask you to wrap rosie's present for me.
LEADMALE:Oh, let me see.
OTHERMALE:Oh, dan! a shoe rack! What do you think? She is not gonna be expecting this.
LEADMALE:It is a good present, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Good, good, good.
LEADFEMALE:Really good.
LEADFEMALE:It's bad, dan.
LEADMALE:A bad present.
OTHERFEMALE:It's really bad.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with it? Dan, i shouldn't even be telling you this.
SUPFEMALE:She is spending so much money on you this year.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man! She's just doing it 'cause she loves you, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure, she says that, but she knows i don't have any money to buy her anything nice.
LEADMALE:If she really loved me, she'd buy me crap.
LEADFEMALE:This is love! Oh, dan, she knows you're broke, but you could at least get her something thoughtful.
OTHERMALE:Don't you think i wanted to? This was always second on my list.
OTHERMALE:Anything but a shoe rack.
LEADFEMALE:Shoe rack.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't think practical, dan.
SUPMALE:Think romantic.
SUPMALE:I know you're no good at it, but it's not your fault.
LEADMALE:You're a man.
LEADFEMALE:Probably why my shoes don't match my bag.
LEADMALE:We've been shopping all day.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you just get mom that big crystal thing? 'cause it costs too much, deej.
LEADMALE:Everything costs too much.
LEADMALE:There's a valuable lesson to be learned here, son, and i think you can profit from it.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy's in big trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Big, big trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's give it up for a while.
LEADFEMALE:I want to go use aunt jackie's gift certificate.
SUPFEMALE:Do we have to go in the big and fat store? Big and tall, deej.
LEADMALE:Hey, what do you think? I like it.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Not the right size.
OTHERFEMALE:I like it.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Nice try, deej.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you go join those other kids over there playing in that pant leg.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:That jacket looks just great on you, sir.
OTHERMALE:You know, black is very slimming.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not here 'cause i'm big.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here 'cause i'm tall.
LEADMALE:Oh, i see.
SUPMALE:Then that jacket makes you look very short.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you think? under 100 bucks? Sold.
LEADMALE:I'll just take a minute and pin these up, and you'll be out of here in a sec.
SUPFEMALE:Man, you guys do a great business here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, the recession's still on, but i think that fitness craze is finally starting to pass.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm actually shorthanded.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? you hiring? why? are you interested? Well, i gotta tell you, it's always been kind of a dream of mine to work in a place like this.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i'm big, so i know how hard it is to buy big clothes, and i've always wanted to help the large be better dressed.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then this probably isn't for you, because i'm only looking for someone till june.
OTHERMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Because i'd shoot myself if i had to work here longer than 3 months.
SUPMALE:I just need some bucks to buy my wife an anniversary present.
SUPFEMALE:Can you do it on minimum wage plus 15% commission? Sold.
LEADMALE:Terrific! Jim ackerman.
SUPMALE:Dan conner.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:This is great, jim.
LEADMALE:Hey, dad, look! i can get this belt around me three times! You know, that's not very sensitive, deej.
LEADFEMALE:The person who has to wear that belt wouldn't appreciate it.
SUPMALE:Go run and put it back.
LEADMALE:That's just great! that's just the attitude you need to work around here, dan! Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:So, jim, about our customers, who's like the biggest, fattest guy you've ever seen? so, are you sure it's not in there? I'm positive.
SUPMALE:There is no wedding ring in here.
LEADFEMALE:Now stop and think.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you retraced your steps for the last two days? Well, let's see.
LEADMALE:I went from home to work, work to home, home to work, the opera work to home, home to work.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:We just gotta keep looking for it.
LEADFEMALE:But we gotta get out of here soon if we want to get to that boudoir photo place by 3:00.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, i can't take a slutty-looking picture without my wedding ring.
LEADFEMALE:I'll look cheap.
LEADMALE:Rosie, i searched all through the closet and i couldn't find it.
SUPMALE:Well, it's a wonder you can find anything in that closet, with all them shoes cluttering everything up.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about it, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:You know when you find stuff? When you stop looking for it.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna sit here, read this newspaper, and you watch how fast it shows up.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you care that i lost my wedding ring? Come on, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I pulled double shift all week.
SUPMALE:I'm exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go look in the living room again, and if i don't find it in there, i'm getting d.j. x-rayed.
SUPFEMALE:Did you try the vacuum bag? the vacuum bag? how the hell would it get into the vacuum bag? Psst! psst, psst! I got the ring.
SUPMALE:What? what are you, out of your mind? You're driving her crazy, running around like that.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think you're do--oh, dan, that is gorgeous! shh! I stole it from her when she was doing the dishes and took it to her jeweler.
LEADMALE:See? I had them put on that extra band with a diamond, and those three little garnets represent each one of the kids.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:Hey, i don't hear you guys looking in there.
LEADFEMALE:Get off my back, woman! Oh, it's beautiful.
OTHERMALE:How'd you swing that? Oh, i'm paying for it in installments, so by our she'll own it outright.
LEADFEMALE:She is gonna be blown away by that, but you can't let her keep looking for it.
SUPMALE:She's going nuts.
SUPFEMALE:I know, but this is the biggest surprise i ever tried to pull off in my life.
SUPFEMALE:I can't give it to her till saturday.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess i have to start looking in here again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! rosie! jackie! come here, quick! What? did you find it? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I think i see it down here in the drain.
LEADFEMALE:I can see it! i can see it! Well, maybe i could see it if you'd move your big head.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, there it is.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:That is my ring.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure? dan, i think i would know if i saw my own wedding ring, okay? Take that drain out! Roseanne, that's a big job.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have the right kind of tools right now.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i need you to come with me right away and talk about something personal, and i need to talk about it somewhere else before3:00.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, okay.
LEADMALE:Well, you want to talk to me, so okay.
LEADMALE:I'll go get my coat.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, jim.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going? Oh, man, no.
LEADFEMALE:I can't work saturday night.
LEADFEMALE:It's my anniversary.
LEADMALE:Well, sure, i want to keep it, but-no, i'll be there.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:My wife will understand.
LEADMALE:Just one thing.
LEADFEMALE:Could you swing by in a ski mask and drag me off at gunpoint? No! next! Hold on.
LEADFEMALE:I got it.
SUPFEMALE:This-dan would love this.
SUPFEMALE:A maid's uniform? This is supposed to be fantasy, not reality.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:I'll find something.
SUPFEMALE:Do you suppose those things are like bowling shoes? you think they spray them after every time? Here.
OTHERFEMALE:Try this.
LEADMALE:Ooh, that's really pretty.
SUPMALE:Ooh! Hey, how do i sneak these out under my clothes? You don't have to.
SUPMALE:They're yours.
LEADMALE:Happy anniversary! oh, thank you! God, it's so beautiful.
LEADMALE:Now i'll look like the kind of hooker you gotta save up for.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Are we about ready? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She's just getting all trashed up.
LEADFEMALE:Good, good.
SUPMALE:So, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, are we gonna be using anyprops today? Well, i've got a couple midgets out in my car.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you mean by props? All right.
LEADFEMALE:Standard bedroom set.
LEADFEMALE:Ho hum.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, jackie, what about you? I bet you your husband would love to see you in something like, uh this.
SUPFEMALE:Well, don't have a husband, bob, but thanks for asking.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:What about your boyfriend? No.
OTHERFEMALE:No boyfriend, either.
SUPMALE:Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, come on out of there.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:I want to see what you look like.
LEADMALE:I don't want to.
LEADMALE:What do you mean you don't want to? This might not be a good idea.
SUPMALE:What if the negatives get out? I'll never be president.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, come out here! Oh, i just don't think this is a good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:I should just take this home and put it on and then dan can see me in it for real.
SUPMALE:But this way, he gets to see it whenever he wants.
LEADMALE:Trust me, jackie.
LEADMALE:He gets to see it whenever he wants.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, just do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:See? Oh, i'm really proud of you.
LEADMALE:You're overcoming your fears, and this is something you'll always be glad you did.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? I bet that old broad in the cat suit had second thoughts.
LEADMALE:Okay, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, whenever you're ready.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do it, jackie.
OTHERMALE:I can't! you can do it! How important is this anniversary to you? Very.
LEADFEMALE:And who is the man you love more than anybody else in the world? Tom jones.
LEADMALE:Second? Dan.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Let's do it.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Here's what i want you to do.
OTHERMALE:I want you to kneel on the bed, lean toward me a little bit, kick your back leg behind you, arch your back, stick out your chest, and smack your lips.
SUPFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADMALE:Dan? I'm in here.
LEADMALE:Did you get my wedding ring out of there? Rosie, honey, i need to talk to you for a minute.
SUPMALE:Oh, so it wasn't in there, right? No.
LEADMALE:Listen, i got some bad news.
LEADMALE:We're gonna have to celebrate our anniversary on another night.
SUPMALE:I have to work tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta work tomorrow? Oh, i get what you're doing.
LEADFEMALE:You're saying that you have to work tomorrow so i'll get all mad and hate you and everything, and then, right at the last minute, you'll do something really great like throw me a surprise party or something so i'll love you again, right? Yes, that's exactly right.
SUPMALE:Except without the great thing and the really nice "i love you" part.
SUPMALE:What? so, you're really gonna work? I tried everything i could to get out of it.
LEADFEMALE:I got no choice.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, yeah, you do.
SUPFEMALE:Quit! I can't.
LEADMALE:I promised i'd be there.
LEADMALE:What? you're keeping a promise to some guy that you knew less than two weeks and breaking a promise to your wife of 20 years? This is a very special anniversary, dan! it's a temporary job, for god's sake! Look, you don't want to say any more.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i want to say plenty more! i can't believe that you're doing this! i mean, you're the most selfish man in the entire world! you don't care about me! you don't care about i mean, all you care about is you! you think i'm so selfish? you think i only care about myself? you want to know why i can't quit my stupid little job? It's 'cause i had to pay for this! It's my wedding ring.
SUPMALE:Yes! your wedding ring! oh, baby, are you in deep now! Come on.
LEADMALE:You got something else to say? who the hell asked you to do this? what? well, you wrecked it! did i ever once ask you to change anything about this ring? did i? huh? No! well, i hope you're happy now, because you ruined my ring just like you ruined my anniversary! oh! oh! man, you are something else! i took a job where i gotta spend all day asking fat men whether they dress left or dress right to pay for that ring, and it means nothing to you! oh, you only took that job so that you could go buy that ring because you knew you were gonna be working on my anniversary and you needed to get that ring so i wouldn't be mad at you! You are insane.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go out tonight and do exactly what i did the night before our wedding i'll be with my friends getting drunk.
LEADFEMALE:You weren't with your friends.
OTHERFEMALE:You were with your mom.
SUPMALE:My mom can drink my friends under the table any day! Hey, coach.
SUPMALE:Sorry i broke curfew, but if i get a little sleep, i'm sure i can play tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i wouldn't go in there.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Ever? Not until i give you a little advice.
SUPMALE:But jackie, i already took your advice.
LEADFEMALE:You told me not to get her the shoe rack or she'd be mad at me.
LEADMALE:What a relief that didn't happen! Let her cool down, dan.
LEADMALE:She's really upset.
LEADMALE:Did you talk to her? She asked me if i knew about the ring.
LEADFEMALE:And you said? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And then? And then she and i decided that i should spend the rest of the night on the porch.
LEADMALE:So you're locked out? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Good news-you don't live here! I was waiting for you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to help you out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, help me out some more.
LEADMALE:I'm still breathing! i didn't ask to get dragged into this! No, jackie, you never ask.
LEADMALE:You just dive right in.
LEADMALE:And the best part is, she hates the ring.
OTHERFEMALE:I know it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, give it to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna take it back.
LEADMALE:Maybe they can put the ring back like it was and then all you have to do is pay for the labor.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Do it.
SUPMALE:You gotta look on the bright side.
LEADFEMALE:If you hadn't given me bad advice and i hadn't taken it and the anniversary wasn't wrecked and roseanne wasn't mad at me, i wouldn't get to spend the night on the porch.
LEADMALE:So, what do you think? I think the shirt looks great on you.
SUPFEMALE:I came in with the shirt.
SUPFEMALE:I tried on the pants.
LEADMALE:I think the pants really bring out the shirt.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? Well, i wasn't done yelling at you yet.
LEADMALE:You know, i thought of a few more mean things to say, so i wanted to rush down here before i forget.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i don't need this kind of insanity during the midnight madness sale.
SUPMALE:Well, i think maybe then we should take it outside.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
SUPFEMALE:I'm working.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then, i'll just start screaming here.
LEADFEMALE:Right behind you.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna kick your butt all the way to yogurt city.
SUPFEMALE:What's this? Happy anniversary.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:You got everything here.
LEADFEMALE:Corn dogs.
LEADMALE:You remembered our wedding dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:And well, you know, i'm not very good at saying i'm sorry, 'cause you know i never am, but i just think i went too far this time and i just figure, you know, after 20 years, every man deserves to hear this.
LEADMALE:I was wrong.
LEADMALE:And i think after 20 years, every woman deserves to hear this-i agree with you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so, don't you have something to give me? Uh come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'll say yes.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Promise.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, will you not be mad at me for giving the ring to jackie to have it put back the way it was before? what'd you do that for? I loved that ring! damn it, roseanne! First you tell me you hate it, then you tell me you love it.
LEADFEMALE:And then, and only then, i produce it from my pocket and show you that i got it back from jackie before she took it back to the guy to have it put back.
SUPMALE:You may now eat the corn dog.
LEADMALE:Now i gotta give you your present.
LEADFEMALE:But you gotta promise that you won't laugh.
LEADMALE:Gadzooks! Why, miss conner, i can't marry you.
SUPMALE:I've fallen in love with another.
LEADMALE:You don't think it's stupid? You're beautiful, honey.
SUPMALE:Well, hell, i always thought you were beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:You really like it? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, good, 'cause i made you an appointment over there next week, so you might as well start shaving now.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Mom, what are you still doing here? Jackie's helping me finish my new puzzle.
SUPMALE:Look, roseanne, marbles.
SUPMALE:All marbles.
LEADMALE:And get this: each marble is just slightly different.
LEADMALE:Well, why don't you guys take all your marbles there and move them off the table, 'cause we're going to eat dinner.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't be a party pooper, roseanne.
LEADMALE:We can just eat around the puzzle.
LEADFEMALE:It'll make dinner more fun.
LEADMALE:Don't make me do this.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you wouldn't! It's getting heavy.
LEADMALE:So you had a bad day.
LEADFEMALE:That is no excuse to take it out on me.
SUPFEMALE:When life gives me lemons, i make lemonade.
SUPFEMALE:But when life gives you lemons sourpuss, sourpuss, sourpuss! What's her problem lately? you think you've got it bad? Try living with the woman.
LEADFEMALE:I came over here to get away from her.
LEADMALE:She followed me.
SUPFEMALE:I swear to god, she's sucking the very life right out of me.
LEADFEMALE:Just a matter of time.
LEADMALE:Everybody in the retirement village got to know her.
LEADMALE:Now they're sending her back to us.
SUPFEMALE:Well, can't she make any friends over there? i mean, don't they have, like, one deaf person strapped down to something there? We have got to do something soon.
LEADMALE:She is undoing a lot of expensive therapy.
LEADFEMALE:Dinner! Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:About time.
LEADMALE:I'm wasting away here.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, c'mon, let's go eat.
SUPMALE:We'll see you later, mom.
SUPMALE:See you tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, i'm not going.
LEADMALE:I'll be fine out here.
LEADMALE:Just have some tea and work on my puzzle.
LEADFEMALE:But, well, you know how you hate to drive after dark.
SUPMALE:Why don't you just take the puzzle and do it in the car while you're driving home? Nonsense.
SUPFEMALE:If it gets dark before i finish the puzzle, i'll just sleep over.
SUPMALE:Let's go here.
LEADMALE:We're looking for corners.
OTHERMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, look.
LEADMALE:What? This is so creepy.
OTHERFEMALE:Doesn't that look like elvis? how about a cup of coffee, jake? It's on the house.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take a cream soda.
SUPMALE:One cup of coffee and i'm up all afternoon.
LEADMALE:Hello, girls.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:So, is he going to be our new dad or is he just another one of your nooners? Don't.
LEADMALE:Don't start with me, roseanne.
LEADMALE:That's jake from the retirement complex.
OTHERMALE:My battery was dead, so he drove me in.
OTHERMALE:That's all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she is 63.
LEADMALE:I guess it's perfectly natural that she starts getting interested in boys.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, you don't think the two of them are oh, gross.
OTHERFEMALE:No grosser than her doing it with dad.
LEADFEMALE:Ewww! Maybe they're not.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe they should.
LEADMALE:Jackie, i think she needs a new little puzzle pal.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give the bride away if you kick her down the aisle.
LEADFEMALE:So, ma is it getting serious? has he introduced you to his parents yet? Please, girls, i'm not in the market.
SUPMALE:I spent 40 years taking care of your father and i'm not going to do that again.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, relax.
SUPFEMALE:In 40 years, all that guy's going to need is just an occasional mowing.
LEADMALE:C'mon, mom.
LEADMALE:He's kind of cute.
SUPMALE:He's like a big leprechaun.
OTHERMALE:He's got a cute butt.
LEADMALE:Oh, please.
OTHERFEMALE:She's right, mom.
LEADMALE:Fine set of cakes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he is a speed walker.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, jake.
LEADFEMALE:I'm roseanne and this is my sister jackie.
SUPMALE:We're bev's daughters.
LEADMALE:Well, i see where she gets her looks.
LEADMALE:Gee, jake, could you get that fork for me? get a nice look at the caboose? i beg your pardon? I love to shock your mom.
SUPMALE:I had quite enough shocking on the drive over.
LEADMALE:Oh, beverly, don't stop me if you've heard this one before.
LEADFEMALE:Did you read about the lady who was so in love with a priest she followed him around a church and grabbed him by the organ? you put your teeth in that mouth? Hey, ma, i forgot to tell ya.
LEADFEMALE:Dan wanted you to come bowling with us tonight.
OTHERMALE:I'd love to.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure i've still got one of your father's balls around somewhere.
LEADMALE:Alimony wasn't enough? hey, ma, how about we bring jake bowling with us? I'd love to go bowling.
LEADFEMALE:And, bev, if you want me to, i'll give you a ride.
SUPFEMALE:I've got reclining seats.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you mean by that.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, come on.
SUPMALE:You love it.
SUPMALE:I could tell you the story about the milkmaids again.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not listening.
SUPMALE:This midget walks into a farm, i didn't hear a word-who strips completely-god, it's like they're feeding off each other.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Is darlene around? I need to get an assignment from her.
OTHERFEMALE:No, she's at the library.
OTHERFEMALE:What is d.j. doing up? When i baby-sit, he's not allowed to watch american gladiators.
LEADFEMALE:It makes him want to wrestle.
LEADFEMALE:Geez, one time.
OTHERMALE:I'll just hang out until darlene gets back.
OTHERFEMALE:It might be a while.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're working on your comic book? Yeah, kinda.
LEADMALE:God, the women you draw are so beautiful.
OTHERMALE:I wish i had a body like that.
SUPMALE:Yours is fine.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you know.
LEADFEMALE:You're all you're in proportion.
LEADMALE:Really? You're just saying that.
OTHERMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I mean it.
OTHERMALE:Everything ends where it ends.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? I thought you wanted me to.
SUPMALE:I mean, the way you looked at me.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't look at you any way.
OTHERMALE:I looked at you like this.
SUPFEMALE:There was no way in how i looked at you.
SUPFEMALE:David, everybody is out.
OTHERFEMALE:We can go to your room if you want.
OTHERMALE:Molly, what are you talking about? You know i'm going out with darlene.
LEADMALE:David, you're cute and you're smart.
SUPMALE:And you deserve someone who doesn't sleep hanging upside-down.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you don't know anything about darlene and me.
OTHERMALE:I know she treats you like crap.
OTHERFEMALE:C'mon, that's not fair.
LEADMALE:Darlene treats everyone like crap.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, david.
LEADMALE:She doesn't act like you're her boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:It's hard to tell you guys are even a couple.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
SUPFEMALE:We have big plans.
SUPFEMALE:We're going to this art school in new york together.
LEADFEMALE:Like you'll still be together in two years.
LEADFEMALE:No, we're doing it now.
LEADMALE:We're dropping out of high school as soon as we're accepted.
SUPFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADMALE:You guys are really going to drop out-hi, david.
LEADMALE:Hi, molly.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , what are you doing up? Nothing.
LEADMALE:I think i gotta go to bed now.
LEADMALE:I better get going.
OTHERMALE:I can get the homework assignment from darlene later.
LEADMALE:Dan, did you hear that? Darlene went to school today! Well, i must say, i had a great time tonight.
LEADMALE:Yeah, great time, great game.
SUPFEMALE:But tiring.
LEADMALE:Really, really tiring.
LEADMALE:That couch looks like it's got my name on it.
SUPMALE:I just can't stop myself.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, dan, it's early, now.
LEADFEMALE:And, mom, i think i see your name on the couch right here next to jake.
SUPMALE:Come on, mom, sit.
LEADMALE:Sit, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine standing.
LEADMALE:Well, how about a drink? I'll get her all liquored up for ya.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:I only have the slightest nip on special occasions.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, like every time we celebrate dinner.
SUPFEMALE:You could talk me into a cup of coffee, though.
LEADMALE:We're out of coffee, bev.
LEADFEMALE:I think we're out of coffee.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, we're out of coffee.
SUPMALE:And tea, there's no tea.
LEADFEMALE:Come to think of it, we don't have anything to eat or drink in the house.
LEADFEMALE:And we're out of toiler paper.
LEADFEMALE:Hey look, look, look, a glass of water will be just fine.
LEADFEMALE:And then, maybe, put a cherry in it.
LEADMALE:Oh, that sounds good! I'll get some for everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, go show mom where we keep the cherries.
LEADFEMALE:So, jake, i think my mother really likes ya.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, every time she really likes somebody, she acts real rude and dull.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, i guess your husband is crazy about me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene? Out.
SUPFEMALE:Can i ask you something? I told you, deej.
LEADMALE:You were placed with this family as part of a scientific experiment.
LEADMALE:Eventually you'll be returned to the trees where you can teach the others what you've learned.
LEADMALE:Are you really gonna leave? what are you talking about? I heard david tell molly that you're running away.
OTHERFEMALE:He told her that? He's dead.
LEADMALE:Man, is he dead.
OTHERMALE:So are you running away? No, deej, i'm not running away.
LEADMALE:But i want you to promise me you won't tell mom and dad what david said.
LEADMALE:Well, if it's not true, then why shouldn't i tell them? There's a couple ways we can deal with this.
LEADMALE:I could grab you by the ears and bang your head against the wall, which is getting a little old.
LEADFEMALE:Or, for the first time in your life, you can act like an adult, which is not going to be easy with that haircut.
OTHERMALE:I won't tell.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Darlene? what? Another thing happened.
LEADMALE:Like? They kissed.
LEADMALE:They kissed? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:On the lips? Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Did they do anything else? what else is there? David.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey.
SUPFEMALE:How was the library? It was okay.
LEADMALE:I was reading this really stupid thing about this guy who cheated on his girlfriend and well, he told a really big secret.
SUPMALE:So one night, his girlfriend snuck up behind him and stabbed him, like, you know, until her hand cramped up.
OTHERMALE:I didn't do anything, darlene.
LEADMALE:She kissed me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please, i've seen you guys together.
OTHERMALE:You've been trying to get into each other's pants for months now.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe i trusted you to keep a secret.
LEADFEMALE:I only told her about our plans because she said we weren't serious about each other.
SUPMALE:I was defending us.
LEADMALE:Oh, so while you were telling her how serious we were, you were chewing the buttons off her blouse? This is insane.
LEADFEMALE:You expect me to feel guilty, i didn't even do anything wrong.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, i wouldn't want you to feel guilty, so here's good news: i'm breaking up with you.
SUPMALE:So, what, that's it? we're not going to work on the comic book? we're not even going to hang out anymore together? We're breaking up, david.
OTHERMALE:It's over.
LEADMALE:Gee, can we still not have sex? That i'll give ya.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what do you think you're doing? Forks go on the left.
SUPMALE:Trouble in teen town? It's nothing.
LEADMALE:David? You better tell us what you're fighting about.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, 'cause it's no fun till we can take sides.
LEADMALE:It's kind of a long story.
SUPFEMALE:Basically, before i could stop her, molly kissed me.
LEADMALE:Oh, david, i'm so sorry that your last meal is going to be meatloaf.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't kiss her back, but darlene broke up with me anyway.
LEADMALE:I was completely right and she was completely wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Well, david, it really doesn't matter who's completely right and who's completely wrong.
SUPMALE:See, it's your job as the man to apologize to her.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not my fault.
LEADMALE:Doesn't matter.
SUPFEMALE:So what does she do? Well, she gets to forgive you.
LEADFEMALE:She's the one who's wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:All right, fine, i'll just go up there and apologize my guts out.
OTHERFEMALE:Take all the blame and pretend that i'm wrong.
LEADMALE:At least i'll know i'm right.
LEADMALE:Don't stop me, folks, if you've heard this one.
LEADMALE:Knock, knock.
OTHERFEMALE:Jake, what do you want to drink? Knock, knock.
OTHERMALE:We got cola or juice.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, knock, knock.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, someone's at the door for you.
LEADFEMALE:A little busy here, honey.
SUPMALE:D.j. , would you go see who's at the door? Got it.
LEADMALE:And he's the one we're most proud of.
LEADMALE:Hey, i said i was sorry.
LEADMALE:Apologies don't count when mom made you do it.
LEADFEMALE:All right, fine.
LEADMALE:Then i'm not sorry.
SUPFEMALE:You can go to hell.
LEADFEMALE:Look, dan, my advice worked! They're talking again.
LEADFEMALE:There's no one at the door.
LEADMALE:What are you-what are you guys mad about? I don't want to talk about it.
OTHERMALE:No, i'd like to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, this brings back great memories.
LEADMALE:My sister and i used to fight like this all the time.
LEADMALE:So, come on.
LEADFEMALE:What's your problem? I apologized, i thought we had made up, and she wouldn't even kiss me.
OTHERMALE:Well, none of this would have happened if he hadn't cheated on me.
LEADMALE:My sister and i were never that close.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:Jake, david's not one of our kids.
LEADMALE:He's darlene's boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Not boyfriend.
OTHERFEMALE:Ex-boyfriend.
SUPMALE:I'm trapped in this house with my ex-boyfriend.
LEADMALE:Well, you should have thought of that before you asked him to move in here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm only 16.
LEADMALE:Why were you listening to me? Don't get mad at him.
LEADMALE:This is all your fault, darlene.
OTHERMALE:You're right, it is my fault, and i'm going to fix it.
SUPFEMALE:I want him outta here, now.
LEADMALE:David, get out.
LEADMALE:Sit down, david.
LEADMALE:If anybody gets to move out of this house, it'll be me.
SUPFEMALE:Can i come in? No, but you will.
LEADFEMALE:Well, david told me about what happened with molly and everything.
OTHERFEMALE:And molly is really different than you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:She's very forward, but i do believe what david said.
LEADMALE:I also know why you're upset.
LEADMALE:I'm not upset.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not mad.
LEADMALE:I'm not anything.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, i think you are.
SUPMALE:But, you know, you always cover up all your feelings with some really lame jokes and some big, tough attitude.
OTHERFEMALE:I wonder where the hell you got that.
LEADFEMALE:Please don't tell me i'm like you.
OTHERMALE:I'm depressed enough.
LEADMALE:I mean, you know, if you're thinking of shutting down to keep all the bad stuff out, you gotta remember, darlene, you're not letting any good stuff in, either.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, fine, you want me to feel something? All right, i'm really mad at myself.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i told him i loved him.
LEADFEMALE:What was i thinking? well, i think you were just being honest about your feelings, you know? And i know how tough that is for you, darlene, but you know, you really do love david.
LEADMALE:And you know that he's totally crazy about you.
LEADMALE:Well, big fat gold star.
LEADMALE:Well, there's just no way to avoid it, darlene.
LEADMALE:Sometimes, you're going to have to go against everything i ever taught you and learn to trust someone.
OTHERMALE:Even men.
LEADMALE:And david trusts you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:And i think you ought to give him the benefit of the doubt.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't think one person is worth this much.
LEADMALE:Well, i do.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're worth this much.
SUPFEMALE:And i think david's worth this much, too.
LEADMALE:You know, i really, really like david.
LEADMALE:I think he's really good for you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he brings out the human in you.
LEADMALE:You say that like it's a good thing.
LEADFEMALE:This sucks.
LEADMALE:I love you, darlene.
LEADMALE:And i love you best when you let me be your mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Can he come in? I don't care.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i would love to stay and help you some more, but i feel i should share by wisdom with others.
LEADFEMALE:I want to take my stuff back to my room.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Take whatever you want.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Nothing.
LEADMALE:You can go now.
SUPMALE:Are you crying? I didn't know you could do that.
SUPMALE:What do you think i am, some sort of freak or something? I mean, we're breaking up here, david.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you broke up with me.
OTHERFEMALE:You should be happy.
LEADFEMALE:I should be upset.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sorry, i'll try and get it right next time.
LEADMALE:David, i don't want to break up with you.
LEADMALE:What? you don't? It's just so weird.
LEADMALE:I'm not used to caring this much about one person.
LEADMALE:Darlene, i've never seen you like this before.
LEADFEMALE:I like it.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, it's the new me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to start painting sad clowns and writing little poems to my cat.
SUPMALE:Okay, kids, enough making up.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Okey-dokey, who wants what? Yeah, okay, i'll remember that for next time, but now, tuna for everyone.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure if you made it, roseanne, it'll be delicious.
LEADMALE:Cool it, roger.
SUPFEMALE:Dan doesn't like it when i'm lied to by other men.
LEADMALE:Hey, 20 minutes till the movie; let's go.
LEADMALE:Okay, hold on because i want you to wear my coat with the big pockets so we can sneak in our own drinks.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you wear it? Well, they're on to me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Well, isn't anyone going to introduce me? I sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy, the real world, the real world, nancy.
SUPMALE:Nancy, this is roger, a good buddy of mine.
SUPMALE:My pleasure.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, that accent, you're not from lanford, are you? No, it's true.
SUPMALE:I'm not from lanford, but as a small boy in london, i dreamed of one day seeing its sunny shores.
LEADMALE:Know, i tried an accent once, but it didn't work for me.
SUPMALE:People kept asking if i was wearing a retainer.
OTHERMALE:I think you've got a lovely voice.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, she's interesting.
SUPMALE:More interesting than you know.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, listen, i don't think you're gonna get anywhere with nancy.
SUPFEMALE:You see, she's-guys, guys just not in front of the kid.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Let's play cards.
LEADMALE:Yeah, sounds good.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Dan, have you thought about going in on that real estate deal with me and rog? Yeah, sounds good, but there's no way i could do it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, everybody has that doubtful little voice inside their head, but sometimes you just gotta ignore it.
LEADMALE:Well, my little voice is extremely loud and can deny me sex.
OTHERMALE:Come on, dan, i'm sure your wife can be persuaded.
SUPMALE:Have you tried talking to her? I tried, but her hair was full of snakes and it just seemed like a bad time.
LEADMALE:Ugh, they're taking forever.
LEADFEMALE:Entertain me.
LEADMALE:Gladly.
LEADMALE:All right, i'm in for 50 cents.
SUPFEMALE:I'll raise you 50 cents.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see that 50 and raise you a dollar.
LEADMALE:I think i should let you know i have no qualms about taking money from a girl.
SUPFEMALE:What about from a woman? how 'bout from a little boy? I'll see that and raise you a dollar.
LEADMALE:Raise you two.
LEADFEMALE:Raising you five.
LEADFEMALE:Got any more money? Yeah, i need-raise.
LEADMALE:Take it.
SUPFEMALE:Yes! I won with a pair of 4s.
OTHERFEMALE:Very impressive.
OTHERFEMALE:You, me, and lady luck should take a little trip to vegas sometime.
LEADFEMALE:And he could hold the camera.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, nancy, we're all yours.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going.
LEADMALE:She takes my money.
LEADMALE:And you, roseanne, take my heart.
LEADMALE:Open the trophy case, honey, we got another heart.
LEADFEMALE:Stay foreign; it really works for you.
LEADFEMALE:That nancy reminds me of my first girlfriend.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should introduce them.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, roger.
OTHERMALE:I don't think you're her type.
OTHERFEMALE:Guys, please.
SUPMALE:And what kind of guy does she go for? The kind that wears a bra.
SUPFEMALE:She's into chicks.
SUPFEMALE:Deal the cards.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I was looking for your mom.
LEADFEMALE:Yonder.
OTHERFEMALE:So, things are pretty exciting around school with the prom and everything, huh? did you guys vote for a theme? Yeah, i voted for "just say 'yes'".
LEADMALE:Did it win? No, i don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Are you guys going? Probably not.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, a lot of people are going.
SUPMALE:A lot of people that you wouldn't think are going are going.
OTHERFEMALE:A lot of people who thought they'd be home that night are actually going.
SUPMALE:Pat, i'd like to solve the puzzle, please.
LEADFEMALE:Charlotte, are you going to the prom? Yes! james carpenter asked me! I don't think i know him.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, you know, he's missed a lot of school lately because he's been really sick, but he's in band.
SUPFEMALE:Not the marching band, but he sure hopes to be.
LEADMALE:That's great.
OTHERMALE:When did he ask you? He--he didn't exactly.
OTHERMALE:His mom had to 'cause he hasn't gotten his voice back yet.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta go talk to roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i just can't believe that i'm going to the prom.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, it would almost be worth going just to sit there and laugh at everyone.
SUPMALE:You're not serious.
LEADMALE:Well, if we really are going to new york, this could be our only chance to go to a prom.
SUPFEMALE:All of our friends will be there.
LEADMALE:David, all of our friends are in this room.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know, it doesn't matter what i like; it's your prom.
SUPMALE:You know, i think i really like the yellow.
LEADMALE:You do? you know, the blue? Eh, it's all right.
SUPMALE:The pink? Oh, yeah, the pink.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't say i wanted to go.
OTHERFEMALE:I just said it might be interesting.
SUPFEMALE:The only way i'm going to the prom is if i can sit in the rafters with a bucket of pig's blood.
LEADMALE:I gotta get going.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, you know, i really hope that you change your mind because, well, you can't be voted prom queen unless you're at the prom.
SUPMALE:You're not helping, charlotte.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, it's just that i'm so excited.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, please, just think about it? Listen, david.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me tell you something about girls here.
LEADFEMALE:If you really want darlene to go to the prom with you, then go over there and ask her properly.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, will you please go to the prom with me? Forget about it.
LEADMALE:What's his problem? Ah, well.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, darlene, this may be hard for us women to understand, but sometimes, a guy, he needs to get all gussied up and go out on the town so he can show off his new hat.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, i'm not going.
LEADFEMALE:It's against everything i stand for.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, it's not just for david.
LEADMALE:I mean, before i die, i would like to see one of my kids go out that door in a prom dress.
LEADFEMALE:And if it's not you, d.j. 's gonna be real unhappy.
SUPFEMALE:I got better stuff to do with my time.
LEADMALE:I'll let you stay out till 2.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you gotta be kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Make it 6 and we'll talk.
LEADFEMALE:A dress and let me take a picture of you in front of the fireplace and then parade you around in front of the neighbors.
LEADFEMALE:No parade.
LEADMALE:Deal? Deal.
OTHERMALE:But i keep the negative.
LEADMALE:Love is the love is the love is the love is the love is the love is the law oh, love, love, love, love love is the law oh, love, love, love, love love is the law see, this isn't so bad.
LEADMALE:Do you wanna stay for the rest of prom night? Well, since it means so much to you, we could stay.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to surprise you; i rented a motel room.
SUPMALE:I wanted tonight to be the night.
SUPFEMALE:But, you know, this is cool too.
LEADMALE:Oh, ms.
SUPFEMALE:Connor, your prom date is here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, don't hate me because i'm beautiful.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man, you dressed like that in front of the fridge, i've died and gone to heaven.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, i'm here.
LEADMALE:My butt's too big for this dress.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you look great.
SUPMALE:Doesn't she, dan? Dress and butt in perfect harmony.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just not sure about this.
OTHERFEMALE:Does roger know i'm coming? No.
SUPMALE:It's not like you're going to be his date or anything.
LEADMALE:It's just a whole bunch of us puttin' on our formal attire and going out to, like, celebrate our own prom, except for this time, we're really, really old.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm just not sure i'm ready for it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we just want an even number of boys and girls, okay? And roger's really cool.
LEADFEMALE:He's really nice.
LEADFEMALE:And plus, he sounds like ringo.
SUPMALE:And who likes rrngo? I like ringo.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, jackie, look who's here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, roger brought a date.
SUPFEMALE:And roger's date is nancy.
OTHERFEMALE:Nancy and roger are-are dating.
LEADFEMALE:Hope you don't mind the tag-along.
LEADFEMALE:Happy prom, everyone.
SUPMALE:All i know is heaven must be missing an angel tonight.
OTHERMALE:Oh, spread it on thick, baby.
LEADMALE:How come you never say anything neato like that? Baby, somebody whipped up on you with the pretty stick.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, shut up.
SUPMALE:Hey, jackie.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you were coming with us.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm--i just came over to do my laundry.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything else was dirty.
LEADFEMALE:God, i'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:Come on, you'll still go with us.
OTHERMALE:No, actually, it's good.
LEADMALE:I'm really not ready for dating yet.
OTHERMALE:Are you sure? Yeah, i'm sure.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, i'm glad you're okay, 'cause, i mean, i've got to find out how come nancy's going back to men.
OTHERFEMALE:Nancy, anne-marie, a little hen party in the kitchen! Wow, nancy, what's going on? I thought you were our little gay friend.
OTHERMALE:So? so, can't you get kicked out of the club for this? what? He's-he's a nice guy and he worships me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but i mean, you know, he's an outie, not an innie.
LEADMALE:You just don't get how it works.
OTHERFEMALE:Please don't label me.
LEADFEMALE:I am a people person.
OTHERFEMALE:God, now i'm losing men to lesbians.
SUPMALE:Champagne, ladies? Thank god you're back.
LEADMALE:For the last 45 seconds, my life lost all meaning.
LEADFEMALE:What are we celebrating? I sold a house today.
SUPFEMALE:Made a small fortune; dinner's on me.
SUPMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:I really wish you'd reconsider letting dan in on this deal with us, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Then we'd be toasting more often.
LEADMALE:What deal? Trust me, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:It's not for us.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all right.
SUPFEMALE:We buy run-down houses cheap, fix them up ourselves, and then sell them before the mortgage and taxes are due.
LEADMALE:Next time, dan's name could be on this check.
SUPMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:How come you didn't tell me about this? This is perfect for you.
LEADMALE:Because i knew you'd say no.
LEADMALE:Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:So now you know what i'm always gonna say.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, i take $5,000, i put it into this and i lose it and you're not gonna be mad? No, not if it's something that you really wanna do, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, all your moping around and whining how you wanna do something special.
SUPFEMALE:And now, something great like this comes along and you say no without even asking me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, guys, give peace a chance.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i can turn this down if i want to.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, you can turn it down, but don't be blaming me like, you know, i won't let you do nothing, making everybody think that your shrew of a wife is telling you what to do all the time.
LEADFEMALE:On a count of three, we go for the door.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry i've made everybody in the room think that you're a shrew, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Good thing you were here to clear your good name.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, they're not thinking that i'm a shrew; they're thinking that you're an idiot.
LEADMALE:They think i'm an idiot for marrying a shrew.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:Isn't that just like you, starting a big fight on a night when somebody else was gonna pay for dinner! Still? I just can't believe this is happening.
LEADMALE:I'm ready all the time.
LEADFEMALE:I'm--i'm ready in school.
LEADMALE:I'm ready at the dinner table.
OTHERFEMALE:Why can't i be ready in a motel room? Don't ask me; i've never done this before.
LEADMALE:Well, neither have i.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if you'd just stop pushing me, it would happen by itself.
OTHERMALE:What do you mean "pushing you"? Well, darlene, you just sprang this on me.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we were just going to the prom.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you weren't gonna try to have sex with me tonight? Yes, i was, but then i would have been the one who started it.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADMALE:You can start it.
LEADMALE:I'll just lie here and watch tv, and then when you're ready, just come on over andstart.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Damn it! Now my arms and legs are starting to go numb.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, david; i know how much you wanted this to happen.
LEADMALE:Darlene, just please stop talking.
SUPMALE:You say anything else, it might disappear altogether.
SUPMALE:How do you think this makes me feel? I'm the only thing in the world that doesn't turn you on.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, you know that's not it.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't get it.
OTHERMALE:I mean, i know you wanna do it.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you just don't wanna do it with me.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:I'm just-i'm really scared.
SUPMALE:I just always figured that when we did do it, that you really wouldn't want to and that you'd just be doing it for me, so then, i wouldn't have to be good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i just wanted to be with you.
LEADFEMALE:I never expected you to be good.
OTHERMALE:I just can't see how this is happening.
SUPMALE:My mom probably put something in the food.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, score, and on the first try.
LEADMALE:Is that some sort of slam about last night? No, i totally forgot about last night.
OTHERFEMALE:It's like it never happened.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's it.
LEADMALE:This conversation's over.
LEADMALE:Hey, how was the prom? was it everything you expected? Not exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you go after? Did you go out to the-we went out driving.
LEADMALE:All night? Well, let's see, the prom ended at about 12:15 and from there we went over to sharna's.
LEADMALE:And we were there from about 12:30 until 2, and then from there we went to this other party over at suderat's and we were there till, like, 3.
LEADMALE:And then we just had to take people home, so we didn't get back here till about 5 of 4.
LEADMALE:Wow, you did have a busy night.
LEADMALE:Well, it's 3 p.
LEADFEMALE:M.
LEADFEMALE:, i'm going in the other room.
LEADMALE:I should be there about 3:01.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Did you talk to darlene about the prom? no, what was the death count? They got in really late and i was talking to 'em and they had some pretty quick answers about where they'd been and when and it was prom night, and i got to thinking about when you and i were kids, and i think they had sex.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't go crazy, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just stay calm and we can work it out.
SUPFEMALE:What's there to work out? They had sex.
LEADFEMALE:Well, great.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene is a woman now.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Maybe she can do her own laundry.
LEADMALE:Don't you want to talk to darlene about it? No, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even wanna know about it.
LEADFEMALE:Millions of people's kids have sex every day and they don't know about it.
SUPFEMALE:How come i have to know about it? well-no, i mean, how come i have to know about it? how come my kids always make sure i find out about every damn thing they do? I wanna be in the dark, jackie.
LEADMALE:I wanna walk around with a great, big, stupid smile on my face like everybody else's parents in the whole damn world.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe they didn't do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, they did it! Of course they did it.
SUPFEMALE:And you're okay with that? no! But what am i supposed to do? I gave her the birth control speech.
OTHERMALE:She's seen the "how a condom works" puppet show.
SUPMALE:David's a good kid and he really cares about her and at least he washes.
LEADFEMALE:I know that because i do his towels.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe how well you're taking it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, soon as d.j. 's old enough to do it, him and his girlfriend, they'll be doin' it right there on the other end of the couch while i'm sittin' on the other end just watching tv and i won't even notice a damn thing.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:I've been to the store.
LEADMALE:I've purchased ice cream and beer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, perfect.
SUPFEMALE:We can make floats.
OTHERFEMALE:So, are we making up now? Nope, we're celebrating.
LEADMALE:I went into business with roger, put in $5,000.
OTHERMALE:Where'd you get $5,000? You finally took all them empty pop bottles back.
LEADMALE:Nope.
SUPMALE:Lumber yard gave me five grand worth of credit.
SUPMALE:The conners are now the proud owner of a depressed property.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, great.
LEADMALE:Now we got a set.
LEADFEMALE:I'm kinda nervous about this, honey.
LEADMALE:I hope you're making me do the right thing.
LEADMALE:I really think it's gonna be good.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me too.
SUPMALE:So, what else has been going on around here? did i miss anything? Nope, same old, same old.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, i really appreciate you being so understanding about last time.
LEADMALE:It's okay, david.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:So, are we ready to have sex? I think i just did.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:I am warning you.
SUPMALE:Mom, if you don't stop treating me like a child, i am packed up and out of your place by tonight.
SUPFEMALE:That's the coffee talking, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold on a second.
LEADMALE:What's that? Okay, i'll tell her.
LEADMALE:The coffee says you're a meddling old bat who's sapping my will to live.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm sorry if i care about you, jackie, but i watch you every day.
SUPMALE:I'm just concerned about this reckless lifestyle of yours.
SUPFEMALE:Reckless lifestyle? I am living with my mother in a retirement community! Now i see why you have so much trouble with people.
SUPMALE:Not people, mom! you! I know you think you have a terrible mother, but you should thank your lucky stars.
LEADMALE:There are women out there who have to go to psychiatrists because their mothers were so horrible.
LEADFEMALE:Surprise, mom! Twice a week.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well.
OTHERMALE:And i suppose you lie there and talk about what a bad mother i am.
SUPFEMALE:I just hope i don't run into this doctor someday.
LEADMALE:God knows what he'll think of me.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, mom, my therapist is a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, how modern.
LEADFEMALE:And i suppose this woman teaches you how to blame everything on me.
LEADMALE:No, i already know how to blame everything on you.
LEADFEMALE:She just tells me i'm right.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? Well, fine.
LEADFEMALE:If that's the way you want it, as of now, you have no mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Nope! nope! no! These sick, sadistic games aren't gonna work on me anymore, mom.
LEADMALE:You no longer have any control over me.
SUPFEMALE:Got it? i do not allow it in my life! What, what is it now? I'm sorry, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:I don't know why i say the things i say.
SUPFEMALE:There must be something wrong with me.
LEADMALE:Mom-no, it's true, jackie.
SUPMALE:I'm just reaching a point in my life where i have to admit a few things.
SUPMALE:I drove your father away.
LEADMALE:And now it seems you and roseanne don't want me around.
OTHERMALE:Maybe i deserve to spend the rest of my life alone.
SUPMALE:Mom, it's not all your fault.
LEADMALE:It's just that my problem is i blame my mistakes on other people.
LEADFEMALE:It's just-it's not you, mom.
LEADFEMALE:It's me.
LEADMALE:It's me.
LEADMALE:It's all me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just no good.
OTHERMALE:You know, jackie, i think i was wrong.
OTHERMALE:This therapy is working out very well.
LEADFEMALE:They paved the whole sidewalk there, and they built the porch, but the doorbell here, that's my idea.
OTHERFEMALE:'cause that's only, like, $1.
OTHERMALE:50 at the store, but it adds $3 value to the house.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, roger's got a live one in the back.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, deej, why don't you ride your bike past the bedroom window? It'll make the neighborhood look quaint.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but watch out for all those crackheads on the corner.
LEADMALE:Oh, really nice built-ins.
LEADMALE:Man, i've been after you for 15 years to build me shelves like this.
SUPMALE:They were supposed to go next to my entertainment center.
SUPFEMALE:What entertainment center? That entertainment center.
SUPMALE:God, dan, it's like you're cheating on our house.
OTHERMALE:Dan, he really loves what you did to the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:All those big cabinets, the tiled countertops, spice rack.
OTHERMALE:Spice rack? You bastard.
SUPFEMALE:It was only a little one, honey.
LEADMALE:I'm going in here, and i had better not find any ironing board coming out of any wall.
LEADMALE:Dan! Come with me.
LEADMALE:Tell her you did it.
OTHERMALE:The place really does look great, roger.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like the grand tour? I could show you around the house.
LEADFEMALE:You could show me around lanford.
LEADMALE:Starting with dinner on friday night.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you dating nancy? my business partner nancy? my friend nancy? All three of them, yes.
SUPFEMALE:But ours is a completely casual relationship.
SUPMALE:I can date other women.
SUPMALE:She can date other women.
SUPFEMALE:You know, roger, nancy is a casual type of person, but i'm a real uptight, do-it-by-the-rules kind of gal, and one of the rules is never date your lesbian friend's boyfriend.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, you're making too big a deal out of this.
OTHERFEMALE:You even painted the names on, dan.
LEADFEMALE:The pepper place, the oregano place, the salt place.
LEADMALE:I promise you'll get one.
SUPMALE:When, dan? when will i get my pepper place? I swear, dan said he was gonna build you one, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up! Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Roger.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen everything.
LEADFEMALE:Can we talk for a minute? Absolutely.
LEADMALE:Excuse us, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Man, we're cutting it pretty close.
LEADFEMALE:There's only five days before the mortgage is due.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, don't worry about it because roger can sell anything to anybody.
SUPFEMALE:Look what he sold nancy.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, chaps, i think we should stay here a while in case some other people come by.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure.
SUPMALE:He didn't like the backyard, did he? No, he liked the backyard.
SUPFEMALE:Then what? the house is too small? No, he liked the house.
OTHERFEMALE:We should stay here so we can tell the other people the house is already sold.
LEADMALE:Roger, i'm gonna kiss you! No, dan, you're not.
SUPMALE:Ah, kiss me.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations, you guys! Hey, yeah, well, what about me, you know? I'm the one that forced dan to get involved in the first place.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you did, honey.
SUPMALE:Men, let's hear it for being whipped.
LEADMALE:You did great work here, guys.
LEADMALE:Thank you, my friend.
SUPMALE:This is it.
LEADMALE:This is my future.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go home.
SUPFEMALE:I'm building you a spice rack, baby.
LEADMALE:Oh, now that we're rich, i don't want one of your crummy jobs.
LEADFEMALE:I want a store-bought one.
SUPFEMALE:Gold digger.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Look at her go, spending all that new money.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha! Don't try to stop me, because i'm headed over here for the $4 table.
LEADMALE:Do you have this in a husky? why? I think it fits you real good.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Really.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Sorry i'm late.
LEADFEMALE:Mom couldn't let me go.
SUPFEMALE:I still had an ounce of self-esteem left.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, jackie, it's your own fault for telling her about your shrink in the first place.
LEADFEMALE:I was cornered.
SUPMALE:I had to hurt her.
LEADMALE:Move out, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're afraid to get out there and mix, but, you know, the world is a lot less scarier than mom.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, roseanne, what do you think? I think it could be a little snug.
OTHERMALE:It's not for me, it's for my baby.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nancy, are you dressing up that cat again? No.
LEADMALE:I think i'm going to be pregnant.
LEADMALE:What do you mean by "gonna be"? Well, it means i really want to have a baby, and roger's gonna be the father.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Roger wants to have a baby? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I haven't asked him.
LEADFEMALE:I don't really care.
LEADFEMALE:As soon as i get pregnant, i'm gonna end the relationship.
LEADFEMALE:You're not even taking his feelings into consideration.
LEADFEMALE:You're treating him like he's some sperm dispenser.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
LEADMALE:Roger's a very special person and he has great teeth.
LEADMALE:I can't even believe she's doing that.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, what is she gonna tell the kid when it comes out with a british accent? Nancy as a mom.
LEADMALE:Too weird.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:I just can't wait to see that baby in the little stretch pants and high heels.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe we're not being fair to nancy.
SUPMALE:People change.
SUPMALE:Maybe having a baby is a sign she's becoming less self-involved.
LEADFEMALE:Guys, look at this stroller.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? you think it makes me look fat? Come on, darlene.
SUPMALE:We're all alone.
SUPMALE:No one will be home for hours.
LEADMALE:No, we shouldn't do this here.
OTHERFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:My parents have probably done it on this couch.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:Where you going? I thought you're not allowed upstairs when there's no one here.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, d.j. and i'm not allowed in your bedroom at night holding a pillow over your face.
OTHERFEMALE:But i'll be there.
SUPMALE:I'm not scared of you.
SUPFEMALE:There's groceries out in the car.
SUPFEMALE:Go get 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish i had someone to boss around like that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, i do.
LEADFEMALE:Go help him.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , where'd you get those jelly beans? From the bin at the store.
SUPMALE:D.j. , i told you.
LEADMALE:You've gotta finish eating them while you're in the store or else it's stealing.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you put those back in your pocket.
SUPFEMALE:When we go shopping again next week, you put 'em back in the bin.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's the good word? The buyer backed out.
LEADMALE:Uh, maybe you didn't hear the question.
LEADMALE:He didn't even give a reason.
SUPMALE:He just changed his mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Now i gotta figure out how the hell i'm gonna pay the bills for all the supplies.
LEADMALE:Well, so? You just go to roger and get him to front you the money until the house sells.
LEADMALE:I can't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:He's an important business contact.
SUPMALE:I don't wanna look like some bum asking for a handout.
LEADFEMALE:Well then, wear a tie.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna do it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go to the lumber yard and ask for 30 more days on my credit.
LEADMALE:The house is bound to sell by then.
SUPFEMALE:And what if you can't get the extension? Well then, i'll finally have the time to build you those shelves you've been wanting.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, they'll be free-standing shelves in the middle of the field we'll be living in.
SUPFEMALE:That's the last time i'm bringing groceries into this house.
LEADMALE:Hmmph.
LEADMALE:You got that right.
OTHERMALE:Man, i can't believe that lumber yard wouldn't give you an extension.
OTHERMALE:I never thought i'd say this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too depressed to drink.
LEADMALE:You know, i'm really sorry i got you into this, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You can't blame yourself.
OTHERMALE:Listen, life's worth nothing if you don't take risks.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, we took the risks, and we're still worth nothing.
SUPFEMALE:You know, anne-marie and i haven't worked in 10 months.
SUPFEMALE:If this thing doesn't sell, i don't know how we're gonna live.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i owe a ton of money to a lumber yard.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if i'm gonna live.
LEADMALE:I'm in way more trouble than you are.
LEADMALE:At least roseanne has a business.
LEADFEMALE:I wish i had a wife who would carry me.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne doesn't carry me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not a big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it is.
OTHERFEMALE:You're saying i can't support myself.
LEADMALE:I didn't say "can't.
SUPFEMALE:" i said "don't.
SUPFEMALE:" hey, chuck, you know what? remember a while ago when i said you shouldn't blame yourself for all this? I was wrong.
SUPMALE:You go ahead and blame yourself all you want! Hey, look, it's not my fault that you're so stupid you jump into a business deal and don't have the money to back it up.
SUPMALE:Hey, nobody calls me stupid in this house that doesn't live here! well, fine! i'll go outside and yell it through the window! Here's a hint: the window's the square thing with the glass in it.
SUPMALE:Oh! oh, you're trying to say i don't know anything about construction? No! everybody puts a fuse box in the shower! I thought it was a closet.
LEADMALE:The way you build 'em, it's hard to tell the difference.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! We're not done yet.
LEADMALE:Hey, that's my shoulder, man.
SUPMALE:You sure it's not a closet? Look, i'm warning you.
SUPMALE:Don't touch me, conner.
SUPMALE:Who's gonna stop me? Hey! hey, hey, hey! Hey, you're gonna break my house.
LEADFEMALE:What's the hell's going on? We didn't get the extension.
SUPMALE:Thanks to this jerk here, we're out 5 grand! Well, gee, dan, this is an emergency.
LEADFEMALE:You might have to go out and get a job.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa! You, in the house.
LEADFEMALE:You go home and tell your mom you can't play here no more.
LEADMALE:What are you doing fighting with your best friend over some business deal? and why didn't you get that extension? Oh, you're the one that told me we should get into this in the first place.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, no, no! What i told you is that you should not use me as an excuse not to do it, okay? Besides, in my version we become zillionaires and everyone we hate is crushed under our immense wealth.
LEADMALE:If all is running true to form, that should be the angel of death.
SUPFEMALE:Close.
LEADMALE:Danny, i have wonderful news.
SUPMALE:Thank god! you sold the house! Nope.
LEADMALE:Better than that.
SUPMALE:You know that big old victorian on pine and central? My contractor dropped out.
OTHERMALE:Absolute wimp.
LEADFEMALE:No vision.
SUPFEMALE:So i'm offering you first shot at this.
SUPFEMALE:All we need is an extra sorry, roger.
LEADFEMALE:Dan's out of nuts.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, this is a sure thing.
SUPMALE:We can make twice as much as we're making on the other place.
SUPMALE:Well, let's see, two times zero is not enough.
LEADMALE:We gotta make at least four times zero.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, rog, the bill for the lumber yard's due any minute.
SUPMALE:I was gonna ask you to float me a loan until the house sells.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Daniel.
LEADFEMALE:Danny.
LEADFEMALE:You're a great talker.
LEADFEMALE:You can get more credit.
SUPMALE:It's just paper.
OTHERFEMALE:Rog.
LEADMALE:Roger.
LEADFEMALE:Roggie! It's just food on the table.
OTHERMALE:I mean, come on, we're not even sure the first place is gonna sell.
SUPMALE:What are you saying? i don't know how to sell the place? I can sell anything.
LEADMALE:I've even sold hovels worse than this one.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Dan, uh robin leach here is beginning to lose his charm.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean that.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I can be such a beast.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't want to lose you as partners.
LEADFEMALE:What can i do to help you? You can buy me out.
LEADFEMALE:You can't pull out now, dan.
OTHERMALE:Not after you put in all that hard work.
OTHERFEMALE:There must be some way you can put these people off.
OTHERFEMALE:Just don't answer the phone.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Or when they come up to the door, we'll turn all the lights off, or we won't sign the check, or we'll leave the envelope unsealed so they think the check fell out of it.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, roger, but we're not that kind of people.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fair enough.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll come by tomorrow with a cashier's check for $5,000.
LEADFEMALE:And i'll tell you what.
SUPMALE:For the extra time and sweat that you put into the place, i'll throw in another 2,000.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to lose our friendship over this one deal.
LEADMALE:All right, then.
LEADMALE:See you tomorrow.
LEADMALE:You don't have to give us the extra two grand, rog.
SUPMALE:I'm way too proud to take your money.
SUPMALE:Who the hell is that? Roseanne, roger left me! I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:How could he do this? how could he be so insensitive? I didn't even have a chance to ovulate.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to.
LEADFEMALE:It really felt like we were right for each other.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i know.
LEADMALE:You think you're using the right guy.
LEADFEMALE:And he left with the $5,000 i gave him.
LEADMALE:What? he left the apartment or he left town? Both.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened to the hugging? nancy, are you sure he's gone? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I went by his place and it's empty.
SUPFEMALE:And i talked to his landlady, and he left the key.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man! This is unbelievable.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna kill him.
SUPMALE:It's so sweet of you two to be concerned, but i'll be okay, really.
SUPFEMALE:Nancy, we're not talking about you! He conned us out of five grand.
SUPFEMALE:And now we gotta unload that house.
LEADMALE:I can't believe he did this to you.
LEADFEMALE:My friends! I think you should track him down.
SUPMALE:And when you do, you tell him i'm really hurt and that i'm just stupid enough to have sex with him one more time! Oh, man, we're screwed.
LEADMALE:No, dan, we are so far beyond screwed that the light from screwed will take one billion years to reach the earth.
OTHERMALE:Dan, what are you doing here so early? Roseanne doesn't come in till noon.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I kinda needed to talk to you alone, bev.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, bev, i need to borrow $5,000 until that house sells.
LEADMALE:Now, you know i'd rather do anything than beg you for money, but you're the only person i know that can't possibly think any less of me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, dan, this is uncomfortable.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to be the one you turn to every time you have a little financial crisis.
LEADFEMALE:I don't blame you.
LEADFEMALE:This reminds me of the little story of the grasshopper and the ant.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:They walked into the bar with the rabbi and the priest? The grasshopper, if i remember correctly, played all summer while the little ant toiled and toiled saving food.
OTHERMALE:But when winter came, that silly grasshopper would have starved to death, but the kindly ant took him in.
OTHERMALE:The grasshopper enjoyed today, but never gave a thought to the cold, cold winter to come.
OTHERMALE:Do you understand what i'm saying, dan? Yes, beverly.
LEADFEMALE:I am a grasshopper.
LEADMALE:But someday, i hope to be an ant like you.
SUPMALE:Thanks for waking me up, mom! You said you didn't want me to, that i was treating you like a child.
LEADMALE:I know what you're doing, mom.
SUPFEMALE:You may not know what you're doing, but i know what you're doing.
SUPMALE:You let me sleep in so you can rag on me for showing up late.
LEADFEMALE:You know, jackie, i don't think you need a psychiatrist.
SUPMALE:I think what you need is a good alarm clock.
SUPFEMALE:No, mom! What i need is to get away from you.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm an adult.
LEADFEMALE:It's time i had a place of my own.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i'm gonna buy that old house.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure about this? I've never been so sure about anything in my life.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to move in immediately.
SUPFEMALE:Let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:This is a deal, right? It's a deal.
SUPMALE:Jackie, you have no idea what those words mean to me.
SUPFEMALE:So, beverly where in the hell do you get off talking to me like i'm some piece of dirt? You forgot the last chapter in your little story.
SUPFEMALE:The grasshopper comes back with his old buddy the anteater.
LEADFEMALE:And after he's finished sucking the little ant up his long snout, he spits her out 'cause she's so old and bitter! I wish you hadn't done that, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Who do you think i'm gonna ask to borrow the down payment from? listen, bev? Oh, man, we are screwed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh we should have known something like this was gonna happen.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, after all, we're involved.
OTHERMALE:You know where we made our mistake? We should never have throwed out that chain letter.
LEADMALE:If we'd only sent a hundred dollars to five total strangers, we could have made us a fortune.
LEADFEMALE:No, well, i'm thinki'' about that bridge we could have bought over there in new york city.
SUPMALE:Oh, she was a dandy big bridge, all right.
LEADMALE:You know, dan, i think if we move fast, we can get right in on that pyramid scheme sweeping lanford.
LEADMALE:We could own our very own damn pyramid.
SUPFEMALE:You mean like the ones up to egypt, africa? Hot diggity dog!
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Yes, slide, man, slide! So, who's winning, morticia or gomez? I'm watching the tv to look for job ideas.
SUPMALE:So far i've got it narrowed down to weatherman, spokesmodel, time life operator, psychic friend, and the one i think i got the best shot at: castaway.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, so, do you have any non-fictional possibilities? I have an interview today at the community center to be activities director.
LEADFEMALE:Good pay, great hours, and best of all, i get to wear a whistle.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but doesn't an activities director have to be, you know, active? Au contraire.
LEADFEMALE:That's what the assistant activities director is for.
LEADFEMALE:And they said you weren't management material.
SUPMALE:Mom! What happened? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I went out for a pass, and when i turned around, he had fallen off the curb.
SUPFEMALE:It's really bad.
LEADFEMALE:I can see right through to the bone.
LEADFEMALE:Look how white it is.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's just your skin, d.j. you need to wear shorts more often.
LEADFEMALE:It really, really hurts.
SUPMALE:Well, we're gonna send your dad out to find that nasty curb that did this to you.
LEADMALE:Here, put your leg up here.
OTHERFEMALE:Hurry, it's starting to puff up.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'll get the ice.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god! Are you all right? My god, it's your tooth.
OTHERFEMALE:Cool, can i have it? what? We did it.
OTHERFEMALE:We finally did it.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to, like, high-five me, are you? Sorry, i'm just excited.
LEADMALE:It was incredible, wasn't it? Well, i don't have anything to compare it to, but i think we did pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear that? what? My parents are home.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god, this is bad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look at it this way.
SUPMALE:At least you won't die a virgin.
SUPMALE:Where are my pants? what did you do with my pants? I ate them in the throes of passion.
LEADMALE:I gotta have pants.
LEADFEMALE:The first clue to sex is no pants.
OTHERFEMALE:Here, hurry up.
SUPMALE:False alarm.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:That is the last time we do that without our clothes on.
OTHERMALE:Hey, darlene, i have a surprise for you.
LEADFEMALE:Already? No.
LEADMALE:I went down to our post office box.
LEADMALE:Our letters from the art school came.
LEADMALE:New york or chicago? Both.
OTHERMALE:We'll open them together.
SUPFEMALE:New york first.
SUPMALE:"dear miss conner, thank you for your interest "in the new york college of creative arts.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately" sorry, darlene.
LEADMALE:Why couldn't they just write, "dear loser, drop dead"? "dear loser" well, new york thinks we suck.
LEADFEMALE:Chicago agrees with new york.
SUPMALE:Well, it's official: we're both talentless hacks who will spend the rest of our lives in lanford.
SUPMALE:Let's party! I'm so depressed.
SUPMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:Do you wanna you know, do it again? Just for future reference, you never have to ask that question.
SUPMALE:I think that's him.
LEADFEMALE:Who? The health inspector.
LEADMALE:Remember? I heard he's coming by today.
LEADMALE:That's gotta be him.
LEADFEMALE:Let me handle this.
SUPFEMALE:Hi there.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, we could play a lot of games, we could do a little dance, but we're both adults.
LEADMALE:And we both know you're the health inspector.
LEADMALE:God, what gave it away? This is my first week.
SUPFEMALE:Is it the suit? You're far too upscale.
LEADMALE:And you don't look like you eat loose meat too often.
LEADMALE:Not with that hard body.
SUPMALE:Man, this job has its perks.
LEADMALE:Whoo, it's getting a little hot in here.
LEADMALE:Maybe i should take off my 50.
SUPFEMALE:You just passed inspection, and so did your restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:Hey, jim, how's the shoe business treating you? Starting to pick up.
LEADMALE:So, any of these slobs the health inspector? Apparently not.
LEADMALE:Good, i hate these damn hair nets.
SUPMALE:I say if i want to get food into my hair, it's my own damn business.
LEADMALE:Let me help you with this.
SUPMALE:Oh, dan, would you please go to your job interview.
SUPFEMALE:You're driving me nuts.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i just want to be here for ya.
LEADFEMALE:Look, dan, we both wish you hadn't slammed a door into my face causing me major and unbelievable pain, but you've just got to put it behind you like i have.
SUPMALE:You get your new tooth? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Thank god you got that fixed, 'cause i gotta tell ya, that was starting to gross me out.
LEADFEMALE:So you wanna see it? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't--why didn't you get it fixed? No insurance.
SUPFEMALE:A new tooth would have set us back $1,500.
LEADMALE:Well, you go to a dental college, have a student work on it.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but with my luck i'd get somebody who's there on a football scholarship.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, put a chiclet in there.
LEADMALE:I'm just trying to help.
LEADMALE:I'd better go.
SUPMALE:All right, now remember, dan, when you meet the boss, head high, shoulders back, lips on butt.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:I was doing lips back, butt on shoulders.
LEADFEMALE:Well, well, well.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne running a restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:What next? me in the army? Well, leon, the boss from hell.
SUPFEMALE:You know, the last time i saw you, you were stealing my tips to pay for that hair weave.
LEADFEMALE:Last time i saw you, you were standing there, leaning on the counter, doing nothing but sucking up the oxygen.
LEADMALE:Ooh, deja vu! Well, i see you've finally saved up enough for a part.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, wait a minute, something is different here.
SUPMALE:Have you lost weight? No.
LEADFEMALE:You've lost teeth! ha-ha! Bumpkin works for you.
LEADFEMALE:So, what, leon, are you here looking for a job? 'cause i'm sorry; we have no openings for useless corporate suck-ups.
LEADFEMALE:That's very funny coming from a jack-o-lantern.
LEADMALE:But for your information, roseanne, i'm already employed as a health inspector.
LEADFEMALE:You are jerkin' me, right? Oh, how i have missed that special way you have of side-stepping the english language.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i asked for this assignment specifically, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:But at first i was a little worried that my memory of your slovenly habits and your room-temperature iq might bias me, but then i thought, "cool!" i'll tell you what, roseanne, i'll give you 10 seconds to run around and sweep up the roach droppings into neat and manageable piles.
LEADMALE:So, leon, have we ordered yet? No.
LEADFEMALE:Two loose-meats, please.
OTHERMALE:This is my supervisor, jeffrey.
LEADMALE:So, leon, what did you have to do to get this job? Just shut up.
OTHERMALE:What? what? what? Don't say anything.
SUPMALE:You never let me say anything.
LEADMALE:Am i smothering you again? oh, my god! What are you ashamed of? We're in love.
LEADFEMALE:Juststop speaking, jeffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so listen, junior, you scratch my back and i won't tell who's scratching yours.
OTHERMALE:You got a deal.
OTHERFEMALE:So, how'd you lose the tooth, roseanne? Darndest thing.
SUPFEMALE:Sittin' here this morning, making up the meat, you know, and it just popped out.
SUPFEMALE:It's gotta be in here somewhere.
SUPMALE:Jackie, can i talk to you for a sec? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sooner or later, they all come to jacks.
LEADMALE:That's 'cause you're so young and hip.
LEADFEMALE:You get us kids.
LEADMALE:Well, i do speak the language of today's youth.
LEADMALE:Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:No, come on! Come back.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna help.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:David and i both applied to the chicago art school for next semester.
OTHERMALE:I sent a bunch of my short stories, and he sent a bunch of his drawings.
LEADMALE:You got accepted! What am i missing? David didn't get in.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
SUPFEMALE:How's he taking it? He doesn't know.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody knows.
LEADMALE:Nobody.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Well, what are you gonna say to her? I was thinking of something like, "mom, jackie wants to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:" no, darlene, no, no, not me.
LEADMALE:Please, jackie, i was gonna run away, but i don't need rozilla leveling chicago trying to find me.
LEADMALE:Darlene i wouldn't ask this of you if it wasn't a really big deal to me.
SUPFEMALE:All right, i'll do it.
LEADMALE:But when you're a famous writer, i want you to dedicate your first novel to your incredibly brave aunt jackie, whose brutal death made this book possible.
LEADMALE:Hey, jackie, check out my new mouth.
OTHERFEMALE:Got your new tooth? Oh, it looks great, roseanne! Yeah, i figure white goes with everything.
LEADMALE:You think it's too white, though? Well, maybe i won't brush it for a couple of days till it matches the other ones.
OTHERMALE:We should celebrate; let's eat some solids.
LEADMALE:Ooh, whoo! yeah, she's back! Maybe some nacho-no, no, no, right for the potato chips there.
LEADMALE:All right, drum roll, please.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! Got any pop bottles you need opened? what's in the bag? No, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:Well, i was gonna wait till you moved into your own place, but i stopped off on the way and i got you these really cool wine glasses that you wanted.
LEADMALE:Oh, roseanne! Those weren't even on sale.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i must have still been real high from all the gas they gave me.
LEADMALE:How high are you? 'cause i sorta got some news.
LEADMALE:What? Put down the bag first.
LEADMALE:Why? Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Why, jackie? Why do i have to put down the bag? 'cause there's something that i have to tell you which, although it may not sound like it, is good news.
LEADMALE:It's really, really good.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:But there is a chance that just for a split second you may not find the news good, so please put down the bag.
SUPMALE:Darlene got accepted into this really great writing program at an art school in chicago and she wants to go.
SUPFEMALE:Take a deep breath and count to 10.
LEADFEMALE:I can't count to 10.
LEADMALE:My head's gonna explode at six.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, try and be reasonable.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm not gonna be reasonable.
SUPFEMALE:She brought this up to me two months ago and i told her there's no way she's gettin' out of lanford.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you should reconsider.
LEADMALE:Okay, i'll reconsider.
SUPMALE:There's no way she's getti'' out of her room.
LEADMALE:Oh, great, roseanne, don't bother to put any thought behind it.
LEADFEMALE:You just go blow up at her in your own special, psychotic way.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me what to do.
SUPFEMALE:You can't go screamin' at darlene! i sure can! if i don't start screaming at her, then she won't have no idea why she's getting strangled! Darlene, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I told her and i think it went pretty well.
LEADFEMALE:You might want to get out of the house.
SUPFEMALE:Now! Roseanne, you up here? did you talk to darlene? She wasn't here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Jackie, why do all my kids want to leave me so bad? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Don't cry.
LEADMALE:I'm a lousy mother, aren't i, jackie? No.
OTHERFEMALE:You're a great mother.
SUPMALE:You're loving and protective.
LEADFEMALE:You're like one of those mother lions in the nature films that carries her babies around by the back of the neck.
LEADMALE:'cept sometimes you get a little rough, and you rip their heads off.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene can't leave! I don't even got the suitcases back from becky yet.
OTHERFEMALE:But this isn't like becky.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene's not running away from you.
LEADMALE:She's running towards something.
SUPFEMALE:She wants a better future.
LEADMALE:I guess so.
LEADMALE:I know it's rough, but you know there's a lot worse things than having your kids leave ya.
LEADFEMALE:You suppose this is what mom felt like when we moved out? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm still living with her.
LEADMALE:I guess there are worse things.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Eww! you're grossing me out! Well, you rubbed your nose on me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, don't try to clean me up.
LEADMALE:I'm not even done crying.
SUPMALE:Look, you raised a great kid.
LEADMALE:She's talented and smart and independent.
LEADFEMALE:One who can make it on her own.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:Tell me what i did wrong so i don't do it again.
LEADFEMALE:Is it safe to come in? Safe as ever.
LEADMALE:She has agreed to sit down and talk about it, which means we've already won half the battle.
LEADFEMALE:'course the second half is the real bloody, dangerous part.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Darlene, would you like to begin? I know you don't want me to do this, but it was a whole different thing when we were talking about new york.
LEADMALE:Chicago's only, like, two hours away.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that would be a much quicker trip to identify the body.
LEADMALE:Your mother is now using humor to help us through this, and we thank her for that.
LEADMALE:I got a scholarship for tuition, and the school says i could live at the dorm and work at the bookstore to pay for meals and books.
LEADFEMALE:See how she's got everything all figured out, roseanne? And now, darlene, your mother will consider it.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but you're too young.
LEADMALE:The answer is no.
LEADFEMALE:I think you have a little more considering time allotted to you.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you've been so very helpful here in the kitchen, but, you know, i think you'd be even more useful standing out in the front yard staring directly into the sun.
LEADMALE:Your mother is no longer using humor.
LEADFEMALE:Now she's just being mean.
LEADMALE:Why did i even bother? Beats the hell out of me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, do you ever think about my future? I don't get this.
OTHERMALE:I thought parents wanted their kids to be more successful than them.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, of course your father and i want you to do better than us.
LEADMALE:Why do you think we spent our whole lives setting such a low standard? Look, you know, i was really hoping that you would understand how important this is to me, but to be honest, it doesn't matter.
SUPMALE:I don't care what you say.
SUPMALE:I'm going to chicago whether you like it or not.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, good, you try going to chicago, darlene, and i'll sic the cops on ya.
LEADFEMALE:That is exactly what i would expect from you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Can we talk about this later? No, let's talk about it right now.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? Oh, don't pretend like you don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Mark takes becky and then you take darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You got another healy brother coming over to take my stereo? what's she talking about? I got into chicago.
LEADMALE:You lied to me? Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Hope you have fun.
LEADFEMALE:David.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry i lied to you.
SUPFEMALE:So you sleep with me, and now you're leaving? what, were you just using me for practice? Yeah, that's exactly it.
LEADMALE:I think i'm ready for the regionals now.
OTHERFEMALE:You didn't even tell me.
SUPMALE:Well, i wasn't gonna go without you.
LEADMALE:Why don't you come with me and reapply for next semester? Oh, great idea, darlene.
LEADMALE:What happens if i go down there and i don't get in again? Well, at least we'll be together.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be meeting a lot of important people.
LEADMALE:I'll be able to introduce you to them.
LEADFEMALE:So what happens if i don't go? what are you gonna do? This is like the most important thing that's ever happened to me.
LEADFEMALE:I can't turn it down.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:You just remember you're leaving behind the guy who encouraged you to go to art school.
LEADFEMALE:You're leaving behind the guy you lost your virginity to.
OTHERFEMALE:And you're leaving him behind with your two huge, angry parents.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Let me see it.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me see that beautiful smile.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you sure got a purty mouth.
OTHERFEMALE:How was dental college? Oh, it wasn't so good.
OTHERMALE:I don't think i got one of the best students.
LEADMALE:He actually asked me which one of my teeth was missing.
SUPFEMALE:Well, next time, you can go to a real dentist.
SUPMALE:Remember that kooky scheme i had where i'd go out every day and perform work in exchange for money? I pulled it off.
SUPFEMALE:I am so proud of you.
LEADMALE:My mom always wanted me to marry an activities director.
OTHERMALE:Show me your whistle.
LEADMALE:Later, if you're good.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't get that job.
LEADFEMALE:Got a job with the government.
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Our government? Supervising guys fixing trucks for the city.
SUPMALE:A job with the city? plus flag day? Good pay, medical insurance.
SUPFEMALE:And the best part is, since it's civil service, no matter how much i screw up, they can't fire me.
SUPMALE:Attaboy, dan.
SUPFEMALE:But what about holding out for your dream job? Honey, when i can't afford to keep my wife in teeth, i know it's time to become an adult.
LEADFEMALE:Now, how's it going? Well, actually no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to hear anything bad on my happy day.
SUPFEMALE:Well, darlene got accepted into this writing school over there in chicago.
SUPMALE:But it's my happy day.
SUPMALE:And she said she's gonna go no matter what we say.
LEADMALE:Doesn't she know it's my happy day? So i told her if she goes, we're gonna sic the cops on her.
OTHERFEMALE:Aw, man.
SUPMALE:This parenthood thing doesn't look like it did in the brochures.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:I don't know, roseanne.
SUPMALE:This bankbook is like her business.
LEADMALE:I just feel dirty invading darlene's privacy like this.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, when you're her mother, it is not called invading privacy.
SUPMALE:It's just called cleaning.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, looky here.
LEADMALE:Why, i haven't cleaned this lockbox in years.
LEADFEMALE:Do you happen to have a screwdriver on you? You know, it's possible she's given up on the whole writing school idea.
LEADFEMALE:Just 'cause she got a job at the buy-and-bag, doesn't mean she's saving up money to run away from home.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne? What, did you find her bankbook? "dear mom, i am leaving home forever.
OTHERFEMALE:I do not love you anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:" oh, she might already be gone.
LEADFEMALE:"p.
LEADMALE:S.
LEADMALE:I am taking huggy bear and fufu the bunny.
LEADMALE:" no, this is from the third grade.
LEADFEMALE:Fufu was killed in a laundry accident eight years ago.
LEADMALE:Well, it's more than you found.
LEADFEMALE:I'll put it back.
SUPFEMALE:No no no, i want to put it in the album with all her other ones.
SUPMALE:You don't need the letter opener, roseanne.
LEADMALE:The key's taped to the bottom.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i can use it to pry the key off.
LEADMALE:Whatever you find in there, don't get mad at darlene, 'cause you two been snipin' so much at each other lately.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man, is she in trouble now.
OTHERMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:Cigarettes.
SUPMALE:Condoms.
SUPFEMALE:And here's her bankbook.
LEADMALE:Look at that.
SUPFEMALE:There's even a hair on it so she can tell if somebody tampered with it.
LEADMALE:I wonder why she has so much trouble trusting people? It was up to 325 bucks, and she took out well, that's it, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:That's her gas and motel money right there.
SUPFEMALE:You okay? Yeah, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's just put the room back like we found it.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be all right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm here to help.
LEADFEMALE:You know that.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! So, you know, then we moved to florida and it was kind of hot there, you know, and we had this house.
OTHERFEMALE:And then we moved to san francisco.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it rained a lot.
SUPFEMALE:And we had this house, like, like, on this hill.
SUPFEMALE:So then we moved to, like, um, detroit? No, it wasn't detroit.
LEADMALE:Let me see, yeah, yeah, no.
LEADFEMALE:Detroit! let's just say detroit! hey! dad! You got to go home now, george.
LEADMALE:My dad gets really mad when i have friends over.
OTHERMALE:He's very strict! Aren't you, dad? Yes, it's true, son.
SUPMALE:You're in for a whoopin'.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, okay, i'll leave now.
OTHERMALE:And, um, d.j. , don't forget to come to my party on friday, saturday night, yeah, saturday, saturday.
LEADMALE:Nice kid.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you hate him? He's new and he's geeky and he's weird looking.
LEADMALE:So were you, but your mother made us bring you home from the hospital anyway.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe darlene smokes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i think she just stole these from me, you know, back when i was smoking.
LEADFEMALE:Anything else you want me to do? No, just go home and wait for my hysterical phone call.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne.
SUPMALE:Oh, rosie, there you are.
OTHERMALE:I've been under darlene's car all day, and i can't find what's wrong with it.
LEADFEMALE:It's missing a squiggly thing.
SUPMALE:And this diagnosis is based on the fact that the thing i pulled out of there last night was squiggly.
LEADMALE:Oh, god, roseanne, what's next? you gonna hobble her? She's out of here, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:She withdrew all 300 dollars from her bank account, and she's gone.
LEADMALE:You don't know what that money's for.
LEADFEMALE:She could be using it tobuy bullets.
LEADMALE:Where have you been? Paris.
LEADMALE:Oh, i mean the mall.
SUPMALE:Look at what darlene bought me.
SUPMALE:Oh, look, honey.
LEADMALE:It's a cd player.
LEADMALE:Say, darlene, what does one of these things go for? Something like that.
LEADMALE:Look, honey, our daughter spent all her cash on a cd player.
SUPMALE:A present for her boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what do you got to say to that, roseanne? hey, how do you know how much cash i have? You looked in my bankbook.
SUPMALE:Hey, i have every right to look in that bankbook! Your father and i started you a college account when you were born, and i just wanted to see if that $20 was still in there.
LEADFEMALE:It's pretty pathetic that you got nothing better to do than to snoop around my room.
LEADMALE:Hello, david, you're looking well today and is that a new hairdo? Thank you, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:I asked him to do it just like yours.
LEADFEMALE:See how easy it is for the men folk to get along? Yeah, you're a real inspiration.
LEADFEMALE:David, come.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go make dinner.
OTHERMALE:No, look, roseanne, don't you see what just happened here? She's not going.
OTHERMALE:She's blowing all her money on teenage crap.
OTHERMALE:She's not planning for her future at all.
LEADMALE:Honey, it's everything we prayed for.
LEADFEMALE:Move.
SUPMALE:You're acting like a crazed psychopath.
LEADFEMALE:Huh, well the voices in my head disagree.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't stop coming down on this kid, you're gonna drive her right out of the house.
LEADMALE:Now, i'm willing to share the blame on what happened to becky, but you're flying solo on this one.
OTHERMALE:Mmm, well, all right.
LEADMALE:I guess maybe 'cause i'm so tired i might be willing to admit that there's a slight chance i was wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I know hard it is for you to admit you were tired.
SUPMALE:Darlene? I kind of want to apologize to you for the way i been treating you.
SUPFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:You're apologizing to me? Well, not for your whole life.
OTHERFEMALE:Just for the past couple of weeks.
LEADMALE:Well, it wasn't all your fault.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like to think that i was pretty mean to you too.
LEADMALE:So, i guess we actually approach the end of bitch fest '93.
SUPMALE:Oh, what a time we had.
LEADFEMALE:See? now that you said you're sorry, don't you feel better? No.
SUPFEMALE:Don't feel better at all.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Don't you just feel a little bit better? No, i don't feel better at all! well, you should! Well, i'll tell you what, dan.
SUPMALE:From now on i won't feel anything i'm feeling, okay? I'll just wait for you to tell me what feelings you feel i should be feeling.
LEADMALE:Feel this.
LEADFEMALE:Stop, stop.
SUPFEMALE:There's no need for begging.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready to tell you all about my first day at the garage.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Look, i even took pictures.
LEADFEMALE:This is my desk.
LEADFEMALE:This is my pencil cup empty.
LEADMALE:Here it is filled with pencils.
SUPFEMALE:And look, a chair.
LEADMALE:A job where you get to sit all day.
LEADMALE:That's class.
LEADMALE:Now, that's class.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they had a special on garbage, what can i say? what, no orange peels? They were on the list.
OTHERFEMALE:I was driving around.
LEADFEMALE:The groceries was in the front seat.
SUPMALE:You do the math.
OTHERFEMALE:You went to buy-and-bag, you saw darlene, and the two of yous lit the torch for bitch fest '94.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:We got along fine.
LEADFEMALE:I just stood there and watched her bag groceries.
SUPFEMALE:Then how do you explain this gutted potato chip bag? Well, i kinda needed that to help me figure out how come i'm being so mean to darlene lately.
SUPMALE:I think i'm screwing up her life.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you have to, honey.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do it by myself.
SUPMALE:She's vegetatin' here, dan.
LEADMALE:She hasn't even worked on her comic for two weeks, you know, and that used to be so important to her.
LEADMALE:Well, she got tired of doing her comic.
SUPFEMALE:Now she'll do something else.
LEADFEMALE:Two weeks ago she's dreaming of being a writer, you know? Now her big dream is being a cashier at the buy-and-bag.
LEADFEMALE:What are you trying to say? I think we should let her go to that school.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm serious.
SUPFEMALE:We couldn't give becky a future, right? so darlene goes out and gets one, and now why are we trying to take it away from her? We ain't trying to take nothin' away from her.
LEADMALE:She can wait 'til she's 18 to have a future.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, i'm 40, i just found mine.
SUPMALE:Well, that's my whole point, dan, see? I mean, i'm standing there watching her doing lousy at a crappy job, you know, and being rude to all the customers.
LEADMALE:It just reminded me so much of me.
LEADFEMALE:In 10 years, i don't want her to end up where i'm at.
LEADFEMALE:Where? where are you? No place special.
LEADMALE:Stuck in lanford, illinois, kinda wondering about maybe i could have done some stuff.
SUPMALE:What kind of stuff? i don't know, like, what if i would have went to college? or what if i didn't have kids so young? what if you hadn't gotten married? Well, yeah, maybe.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you ever think about that, dan? No.
SUPFEMALE:I always thought it was the smartest thing i ever did.
LEADFEMALE:You obviously don't agree.
SUPMALE:No, i do agree with you.
SUPFEMALE:It was the smartest thing you ever did, but we're talking about me now.
LEADFEMALE:I never told you you had to stay in lanford.
LEADFEMALE:That was a choice you made.
LEADMALE:I am not blaming you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I chose this life and i love it.
SUPMALE:Except for that no dishwasher thing! But you know, i'm starting to think about some stuff i gave up.
SUPMALE:Everybody gives up stuff.
SUPMALE:Hell, i gave up a lot of stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? Like being single.
OTHERMALE:I wanted to write children's books, dan, remember? Honey, i built you a whole writing room in the basement, but you never used it.
LEADMALE:There was nothing stopping you from finishing the adventures of mancini the elephant or pee pee the talkin' mouse.
OTHERMALE:His name is pippet, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:And i never had time, what with the bike shop and becky and bein' broke all the time.
SUPMALE:So it's my fault again.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Beat it! mommy's fighting! No, we're not fighting.
LEADFEMALE:Fights over with.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, come here.
LEADMALE:I want you to sit down for a minute.
LEADMALE:Dan, we haven't finished talkin' yet.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i don't want 2 women thinking i ruined their lives! I want to do this right.
LEADMALE:Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Your mom and i have been talking, and we're not sure, but maybe we think you ought to go to school.
SUPMALE:I do go to school.
LEADFEMALE:It's just sometimes i'm directing a lost freshman to his class and i miss roll call.
LEADMALE:You don't want to mess this up, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Your dad and i are willing to talk about this chicago school thing again.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, "talk about it"? Uh, talking: it's like yelling only not as loud.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks, but i changed my mind.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going.
SUPMALE:Can she do that? hey! You're staying here 'cause of david, aren't you? No.
SUPMALE:You know, planning your whole future around some boyfriend is not really a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:I just decided it wasn't right for me.
LEADMALE:Isn't that possible? No.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you didn't want me to go.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not going.
OTHERFEMALE:Congratulations, you win.
SUPMALE:Staying here against her will is one thing, but stayin' here 'cause she wants to that's sick.
LEADFEMALE:This is a 1967 penny, and this is a 1968, and i don't have a '69, but, uh, here's a '70.
SUPFEMALE:And then if you notice the little letter under the date, this indicates which city the penny was made in.
LEADMALE:You see, like d, that's for denver, and s is for san francisco.
LEADMALE:Here, want to see? We believe you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have quite as many nickels, but i do have this one.
SUPFEMALE:It's a 1975.
LEADFEMALE:See what i mean? You know, george, we really wish you could stay a lot longer, but d.j. and i need to practice our religion now.
OTHERMALE:Oh, uh, okay.
SUPMALE:I'll go now.
LEADMALE:And d.j. , don't forget to come to my party on friday night.
LEADMALE:See you.
LEADMALE:I'm not going.
LEADMALE:Ah, come on, deej, you're missin' a great opportunity.
SUPFEMALE:Odds are you'll be the most interesting person there.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i'll go.
LEADMALE:All right, atta boy.
SUPMALE:Now go wrap up one of your toys as a present.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, there you are.
SUPFEMALE:I want to talk to you for a sec.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, what's up? Well, now, we know that you and darlene are, you know, in love with each other and everything, but lately me and mr.
SUPMALE:Conner have been really concerned about what's going on between the two of you.
SUPMALE:Really? you are? Relax, david, i'm not talking about sex.
LEADFEMALE:I know, come on.
LEADMALE:Lucky for you i'm still in denial about that.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Me and mr.
SUPMALE:Conner, uh, we want darlene to go to that art school.
LEADMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:You just changed your minds? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, you know, she's acting like she doesn't want to go, although i know that she really does want to go and i think that she's doin' that because she wants to stay here with you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:So i was thinking that maybe you and i could get together and figure out some way to make her go.
SUPFEMALE:But i don't want her to go.
OTHERMALE:Well, nobody wants her to go, david.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, except for maybe d.j. and the school board, but we all know that she should go.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't think she should go.
SUPFEMALE:We're happy here.
LEADFEMALE:We're a couple.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you know what they say, david.
LEADMALE:They say, uh, when you really love something you should, you know, make it go away or get rid of it or whatever.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, but darlene and i have already talked about this, and i told her if she goes to chicago i'm breaking up with her.
LEADFEMALE:You what? Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? I'm gonna go up there and makes sure she does what's right for darlene, david, and not for you.
LEADMALE:You can't tell darlene what to do.
LEADFEMALE:She's a big girl.
LEADMALE:Compared to who? David, go back downstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are you trying to break us up? David, right now, the only thing i want to see is the back of your head getting smaller and smaller and smaller.
OTHERFEMALE:There are several ways we can accomplish this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's so sweet.
LEADFEMALE:You two are having your first fight, and you rushed all the way up here to show me.
LEADMALE:You know, i just don't get it, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Doing things 'cause a guy says so, huh? who raised you? She's doing what she wants to do.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't you just stay out of this? David, i would hate to embarrass you in front of your girlfriend by throwing you out of here physically.
LEADMALE:Ah, what the hell.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for not embarrassing me.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, this is not a big deal.
LEADMALE:David and i are just gonna apply again next year.
SUPMALE:Well, what if you apply every year and he never gets in? Why can't you just drop this? 'cause it's too weird.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you could talk you've been whining about getting out of lanford and what, now you got a boyfriend, so you're gonna go change your mind? I thought you wanted something better than this.
LEADFEMALE:Better than what? Better than this! Better than this room.
LEADMALE:Better than this whole house! Better than this pillow.
LEADFEMALE:Better than this quilt, okay? Better than this trash can.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, cut it out! I mean, what if i go there and everybody else is, like, way brilliant and i find out i suck, then what happens? so, you mean this whole thing is not even about david? So, you got to tell me, darlene, which of the motherly speeches am i supposed to be giving here 'cause i'm totally off track.
SUPMALE:Well, we're through talking.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we are.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I figure if i wash them all in hot water i can fit 'em in one suitcase.
OTHERMALE:Mom, why can't i just live at home like a normal kid? Because as i have told you for your entire life, darlene, you are not normal.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, you dress funny, you're weird, you're too smart for your own damn good.
LEADMALE:Let's face it, darlene, you're special, and i think you could be something great.
OTHERMALE:Well, i tried to leave last week.
SUPMALE:I packed my bags, i got in my car.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't do it.
SUPMALE:You cannot be afraid of failure, okay? So what, you get there, you find out you suck.
OTHERFEMALE:Great! You're gonna be the first conner to suck in college.
LEADFEMALE:Then you can come back home.
OTHERMALE:We ain't goin' nowhere.
SUPFEMALE:Never have for 20 years.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but it was different when david was going.
OTHERFEMALE:I just don't think i can do it by myself.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen to me, little girl.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna tell you somethin'.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes life just gives you one chance, and if you do not grab it-when? when were you in the car? I been watching you like a hawk.
OTHERMALE:Well, hawks don't generally pass out on the couch after eating a quart of ice cream.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me put it to you this way.
SUPFEMALE:You got to go.
LEADMALE:'cause i want you to go.
LEADFEMALE:Because if you don't go, you're gonna regret it.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe not now, okay, but soon, and then for the rest of your life.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, darlene, and i want you to get the hell out of here.
SUPMALE:I can't believe you're letting me go.
SUPFEMALE:I can't either.
SUPFEMALE:So, now you gotta go down there and talk to david.
SUPFEMALE:Unless of course you want me to.
LEADMALE:I'm going.
SUPFEMALE:Da-da da da da da da da-da da-da da you made this? Yeah, i added the water myself.
SUPMALE:Puddin' was in the mix.
LEADMALE:What's the occasion? Well, i just didn't want you to feel bad thinking like i regret us getting married or somethin'.
SUPFEMALE:I don't.
LEADMALE:I know i've made you very happy.
OTHERFEMALE:So, you don't feel bad about one little thing that i had to give up for you? No.

LEADFEMALE:Well, all the more cake for me, i guess.
LEADMALE:I'm home! Hey, deej, come here and tell us all about the party.
LEADMALE:Thanks for making me go.
LEADMALE:It was great.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, come here and sit down and tell us about all the games and fun things you guys did.
SUPMALE:I touched a boob.
LEADMALE:Say what? We played this game.
SUPMALE:Seven minutes in heaven.
SUPMALE:And i had to go in the closet with sheila frye, and we just stood there doing nothing for like six minutes.
LEADMALE:What happened in that last minute, son? I told you.
LEADMALE:I touched a boob.

SUPMALE:She's coming over for dinner tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:She likes corn.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo doggy! Gonna have to have a long talk with that boy
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, how's the laundry coming? Oh, it came about as far as the living room.
SUPFEMALE:Will it be coming to the actual washing machine? Eventually.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's pretty whupped from the first leg of its journey.
LEADMALE:Darlene, i'd like to take a shower.
SUPFEMALE:It'd be nice to have a towel.
OTHERMALE:Let me just finish this.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You work around our schedule, not the other way around.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:You see, becky worked around your schedule because she didn't have a life.
SUPFEMALE:Fortunately, you've raised me to defy authority.
LEADMALE:Now! The fuehrer needs a fluff and fold.
LEADMALE:I got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hell, look at this.
SUPMALE:We got flyers again.
LEADFEMALE:Spray and spray, but they keep coming back.
LEADMALE:Would you please fold that laundry and put it away? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Any luck with the job hunt? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, one place offered me an executive position.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, i'm allergic to corn dog batter.
SUPFEMALE:Pity.
LEADMALE:However, my story is one of success.
LEADFEMALE:Today i fixed a kid's bicycle chain for five dollars.
LEADFEMALE:Swimmin' pools, movie stars.
LEADFEMALE:What's for dinner? Well, d.j. , even though mommy was out all day looking for a job, she still had time to plan tonight's menu.
LEADFEMALE:Go through these pizza ads and order whatever's 2 for 1.
SUPFEMALE:Did becky call? Yeah.
SUPMALE:So what'd she have to say? I don't know.
SUPMALE:You'd have to ask darlene.
LEADFEMALE:How long is this gonna go on, dan? She's called every single day.
OTHERMALE:So, what, you're not gonna talk to her for the whole rest of your life? Hey.
LEADMALE:There's a new place called final notice.
SUPMALE:Give me that.
LEADMALE:It's from the electric company.
SUPMALE:Oh! They're cutting us off at 5.
SUPMALE:Didn't you pay that bill? Well, i had to choose between water and electricity, dan, and you can only live sure, i can take a bath, but i can't throw the toaster in.
LEADMALE:Hello, this is roseanne conner, no, i can't hold-oh, i'm on hold.
SUPMALE:How far behind are we? I don't know.
LEADMALE:A few months.
SUPMALE:I can't believe they're cutting us off after the very first final notice.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? Okay, i got this kind of a warning on my doorknob from you guys, saying you're gonna cut us off at 5, which is in, like, about 3 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:What am i supposed to do? Well, hey, i sent a check in there.
LEADMALE:It ain't my fault if you guys didn't get it.
LEADMALE:Well, no, i can't get down there that fast.
LEADMALE:Hey, i know.
LEADMALE:You're there.
LEADMALE:Why don't you write a check, and then i'll cover it on monday.
LEADFEMALE:I'm good for it.
OTHERMALE:We're screwed.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, listen up, family.
SUPFEMALE:If anybody has anything to do this weekend that requires electricity, you've got about oh, rats.
SUPMALE:And it way my turn to vacuum the house.
LEADFEMALE:I'll try to dig up some flashlights and candles.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna watch tv.
LEADFEMALE:Way to help out, son.
LEADMALE:Well, i'd better turn up the fridge.
SUPMALE:Well, middle class was fun.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe that nobody can figure what this is.
SUPFEMALE:Here, i'll give you one more clue.
LEADMALE:Moo-oo! A cow? You got it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, here's another one.
OTHERFEMALE:Cock-a-doodle-doo! Give me another clue.
LEADFEMALE:It's a rooster.
SUPMALE:"it's a rooster.
LEADFEMALE:" is it a cow? I told you this was gonna be fun.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Now let's play lizzie borden.
LEADFEMALE:I'm bored.
LEADMALE:And stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Don't forget stupid.
LEADFEMALE:All right, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:More flashlight fun.
LEADMALE:Everybody grab one in each hand, turn 'em on, and wave 'em around on the wall.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, it's it's a laser show at the iron butterfly concert! All right, enough.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, my battery's dead.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no problem, d.j. get the one out of the smoke detector.
LEADFEMALE:That's dangerous, darlene.
LEADMALE:What if i need it for the remote control? hey, deej? Forget the flashlights.
OTHERMALE:Come on down here, son.
SUPFEMALE:You know, when i was a kid, my grandpa used to tell me about when he was a kid, before there was tv, they used to sit around and tell stories.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of stories? I don't know.
LEADMALE:That was his best one.
OTHERFEMALE:But i bet your mom could make up a good one, couldn't you, honey? Oh, okay, let's see.
LEADMALE:Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um ah! I got one.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, once upon a time there was these 4 princesses, and they lived in this great, big house all together, and they never left, okay? And they just sat around all the time talking and talking and yammering and yammering, and they killed every single man who ever came over there except for one, who they kept as a pet.
LEADFEMALE:And then one time, these 2 princesses left and then these other 2 came on and they really stunk, and-mom, that's designing women.
LEADMALE:Oh, you figured it out.
LEADMALE:Let me try to make one up.
LEADFEMALE:Go for it, son.
SUPMALE:I'm in hell.
LEADMALE:Okay, um, there was this guy, and he was walking down the street, and he kept walking.
SUPMALE:Then he found something, and then he lost it.
LEADFEMALE:And there was this car with a guy in it.
LEADFEMALE:Then he got something.
SUPMALE:And there was this dog, and he was barking because the window was open.
LEADFEMALE:Not so much he could jump out, but um the end.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene i'm sorry, but this bites.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, it really kind of does.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i got an idea.
SUPFEMALE:How about me and you, tomorrow we'll go do something together, something real special.
SUPFEMALE:Like what? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could go soak up some electricity down at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:I don't do the mall, mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:It'd be a lot of fun, you know.
OTHERMALE:Becky and i used to go down there, okay, and this one time one time we were over at rodvelle's, you know, and we went in and we stuck all the mannequins' skirts right up their butt, you know? And then we went over to hickory farms and we squeezed all the cheese logs and ran.
LEADMALE:What do you say? Please let that be child welfare.
LEADMALE:It's about time.
OTHERMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner, mr.
OTHERMALE:Conner.
OTHERFEMALE:Son.
LEADMALE:This is weird.
LEADFEMALE:When are you gonna have light again? Oh.
LEADMALE:Just as soon as the earth spins back around towards the sun.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, we're out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, whoa! Where you goin'? Upstairs, to work on our comic.
LEADMALE:Alone? with no lights on? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think we're gonna do? If i think about it, you're grounded.
SUPMALE:No, i want you to stay down here.
LEADFEMALE:If you want, you can work in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:What, and be distracted by all the fun you're having in here? I couldn't concentrate.
OTHERMALE:Keep running back in every time i thought of a new shadow puppet.
OTHERFEMALE:This is stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Get back down here! come on! Darlene david, which one of us could hurt you more? I'm not sure.
LEADMALE:Dad, we're just gonna work.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you assuming something's gonna happen? I mean, come on.
SUPMALE:He's not mark.
SUPFEMALE:That's true, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Mark had a sexy kind of dangerous thing going on.
OTHERMALE:This is david.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, where were we? Right here.
SUPFEMALE:No, come on, david.
SUPFEMALE:We've got to finish this.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, right.
SUPFEMALE:Here's where you had the skinless man pin the moth woman alive to the collector's board.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look at the size of the moth woman's breasts.
OTHERMALE:So? So they're huge.
LEADFEMALE:They weren't like that before.
SUPMALE:She was a caterpillar before, for god's sakes.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADMALE:All the women have enormous breasts.
SUPFEMALE:I just thought they'd be more interesting that way.
SUPMALE:You're just getting off on this.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, look at some of this stuff you've got them doing.
LEADMALE:I didn't write this sleaze.
SUPFEMALE:Is this all you think about? Yeah, i think about it.
SUPMALE:Thinking about it is all i can do.
LEADFEMALE:What's that supposed to mean? Come on, darlene.
SUPMALE:We've been going out for a while.
SUPFEMALE:There's a lot of people that have been going out for a lot less and doing a lot more.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's do it right now.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you make it sound like it's this bad thing, when all i want to do is get closer to you.
SUPMALE:I thought, you know, we're here and it's dark i thought maybe we could mess around.
LEADMALE:If i feel like messing around-and i am extremely flattered that you call it that-then i'll let you know.
SUPMALE:Till then, chill.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Let's just get back to work.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:You can start by erasing those.
OTHERFEMALE:And those.
LEADFEMALE:And that.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, does anybody want anything? Because i'm opening.
LEADMALE:I need something to wash down those oh, how about green jell-o? I'm your boy.
LEADMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you guys are not going to believe the time i had at that singles dance last night.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't even been home yet.
SUPFEMALE:Not that i met anybody or anything, but nancy and i had a few, so i just decided to crash at her place for a while, you know, just for the night.
SUPFEMALE:You ought to turn the freezer up.
OTHERFEMALE:It's getting kind of warm in there.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway jackie, let me make you some breakfast, okay, because-roseanne, i'm right in the middle of a story here, okay? Anyway, the second we walk in the door, nancy starts throwing herself at any jerk who's wearing old spice, which leaves me completely alone, having to fight off this whole parade of losers.
LEADMALE:This one guy actually said, "you're under arrest for stealing my heart.
LEADMALE:" it was priceless! pathetic! I just want to see if any of 'em called.
OTHERMALE:Hey, there's a message from you on here, roseanne.
SUPMALE:What do you need candles and flashlights for? Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, we don't have any lights, but now we know the speed of stupid.
SUPMALE:How was i supposed to know they cut your power? Well, we thought maybe the lack of electricity might tip you off.
LEADMALE:Hey, you want to shut down that blender? I can't hear.
LEADMALE:Hello? It's for you.
LEADFEMALE:What, is it becky? I'm sick of making up all these excuses for you, dan.
SUPMALE:You want to hang up on your daughter, you hang up on her yourself.
LEADMALE:Come on, deej.
LEADMALE:Let's go work off that breakfast.
LEADMALE:Uh, becky.
LEADMALE:Hi! no! No, they're just having a problem with the electricity, so he had to go, um, change a fuse.
LEADMALE:And they will probably call you back in just a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, this thing with dan and becky can't go on forever.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Sooner or later they'll cut the phone off too.
LEADFEMALE:No, now, come on.
SUPMALE:First things first.
SUPFEMALE:How do we get the electricity back on? You pay the bill.
OTHERMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Good, good, good.
LEADMALE:Okay, how fast can they restore service? Well, they said if they got the cash early enough on monday, then they would turn everything back on whenever the hell they feel like it.
LEADFEMALE:No! That's not right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna make a call and see if they can get it on any sooner than that.
LEADMALE:Did you tell them you have children? Yeah, they don't want 'em.
LEADMALE:Morning.
LEADMALE:David, you're early.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, i'm early.
SUPFEMALE:I just got here.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't sleep at my house, where i was before.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess you had kind of a rough night, huh? Come on in, honey, and tell me all about it.
LEADFEMALE:You are dead! Mom, wait.
SUPMALE:No, you wait! nothing happened, mom! I trusted you.
LEADMALE:What'd i miss? We were working on the comic book.
LEADMALE:We hit this great roll.
LEADMALE:We ended up pulling an all-nighter.
SUPFEMALE:That's all that happened, okay? ohh hey, rose, did you david, you back again? don't you have a home? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Don't they miss you there? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:First thing this morning, there he is, knocking on the door again.
LEADMALE:You know, i think you guys are seeing too much of each other.
LEADMALE:You should go home now, david.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Uh, good night.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, bye.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Did you tell dad? No.
SUPMALE:You're much more use to me alive.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for not going psychotic on us.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, you're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to be a cool mom.
LEADFEMALE:I appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:And as a cool mom, i want to save you from some of the embarrassment that becky went through, so i'm just gonna go ahead and bring this up first.
LEADMALE:Bring what up first? Uh, monday we'll go to the gynecologist and get you some birth-control.
LEADMALE:Why? Well, because i just don't think i'm responsible enough to be a grandmother yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing happened last night.
SUPMALE:I told you that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darlene, he spent the whole night in your room.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, neither am i.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, i don't want to have sex yet.
OTHERFEMALE:And second, you think i'd do it with you why not? You could do it real quiet without us knowing about it.
SUPMALE:Really? You can't.
LEADMALE:You mean you can hear us? Last night i had to tell david you were moving furniture.
SUPMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:We're not talking about my sex life.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an adult.
SUPMALE:We're talking about your sex life.
SUPMALE:I don't have a sex life.
LEADFEMALE:But if i did, i wouldn't tell you, 'cause i don't think it's any of your business.
LEADFEMALE:And unlike your other daughter, if i needed birth control, i'd know how to take care of it myself.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need you to hold my hand.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Why won't you just let me do this? Oh, i see.
LEADFEMALE:This is for you.
LEADMALE:Well, how about this? We'll go get me birth control tomorrow, i'll go have sex with david, and then we can celebrate at the mall.
OTHERFEMALE:That should be your perfect day.
OTHERMALE:Darlene darlene, you get back here! Leave me alone.
LEADFEMALE:I am just trying to be nice, damn it! What's going on here? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Can i have some money for a movie, please? Sorry, all i have is hundreds.
SUPFEMALE:We're not done talking, darlene.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Then just anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Just a few bucks so i can get out of this stupid house and do something.
SUPFEMALE:You're not going anywhere.
LEADMALE:This discussion's over, mother.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna relive some gynecological bonding moment you had with becky.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
LEADMALE:You want to tell me what we're talking about here? I'll tell you later.
SUPMALE:No, let's tell him now.
LEADFEMALE:Mom wants me to go on the pill because becky had sex.
OTHERMALE:I don't think that'll work.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think that this is the proper time for you to discuss this with your father, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? I have nothing to hide.
LEADFEMALE:David never left last night.
OTHERFEMALE:We stayed up all night long working on the comic book.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I screwed up, but i didn't sleep with him.
LEADFEMALE:Calm down.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm handling this.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm handling this.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing to handle.
OTHERMALE:Don't you listen? Yeah, i heard.
OTHERMALE:And i'll be damned if i'm gonna let this happen twice.
SUPMALE:You are not gonna see david again, do you hear me, darlene? I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:You guys are treating me like i'm becky.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not becky.
LEADFEMALE:I don't go to the mall like becky, i don't do great laundry like becky, i don't love school like becky, and i don't sleep with my boyfriend like becky! So what are you getting at, becky? What i'm getting at, mother, is i'm stuck here, so i'm paying for how she screwed up.
LEADFEMALE:But if you guys have a problem, you deal with becky.
LEADMALE:Leave me out of it.
LEADFEMALE:Remember how excited we were when she first learned to talk? think she's telling the truth? Well, if she went to all the trouble of saying it in front of you, i guess she'd have to be.
LEADMALE:You should have told me, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even know what i can tell you anymore, dan, and what i can't tell you, 'cause you already got one kid that you won't even talk to.
OTHERMALE:Well, stuff happens around here, i should know about it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, brace yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:The kids can hear you having sex.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hey, beck.
LEADFEMALE:Dad? Yeah, it's me.
LEADMALE:How you doin'? I'm good.
LEADFEMALE:How are you doin'? I'm okay.
LEADMALE:Good to hear your voice.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, it's good to hear your voice too.
SUPMALE:So, how's mom? She's fine.
LEADMALE:So i heard it was really cold up there last week, and i was just wondering if your landlord put in the storm windows yet.
LEADFEMALE:No, i don't think we have them, dad.
LEADMALE:Well, that's crazy.
LEADMALE:You're gonna freeze.
LEADMALE:Okay, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Here's what you do.
LEADMALE:Just go down to any hardware store, and you get this stuff-plastic window insulator.
LEADMALE:You want the indoor kit, not the outdoor kit.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, beck? Now, all you do is you fit the plastic to the size of the window.
SUPMALE:Listen, dad, i don't know much about this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, honey.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that hard.
LEADFEMALE:You just shrink the plastic with a hair dryer.
LEADFEMALE:I know you know how to use one of those.
OTHERMALE:Dad, maybe you should be talking to mark about all this stuff.
LEADMALE:Yeah, ok okay, put him on.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hang on.
SUPMALE:Hey, dan.
LEADMALE:Hey, mark.
LEADMALE:How's it going? fine, and you? Real good.
LEADMALE:Listen, i was just talking to becky about, um, you guys should have a plastic window insulator.
SUPFEMALE:Give me that! No.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, i want it.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Give me it.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, no! give it, then! give it! give it! come on! what's going on? Aah! Aah! 
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, hurry up! i'm next! Okay, sorry.
SUPMALE:I got a few things for myself.
SUPFEMALE:I'll pay you back later.
LEADMALE:What'd you get? Just stuff.
LEADMALE:Oh, let's see.
SUPMALE:Disposable razors, amaretto mist instant coffee, and a soft-pink light bulb.
SUPMALE:So, who is he? who's who? The guy you're dating.
OTHERFEMALE:What? I just want to kick back, have a nice cup of coffee, and shave my legs in a flattering light.
SUPFEMALE:He's married, isn't he? No.
SUPMALE:He's not gonna leave his wife, you know.
OTHERMALE:They say they will, but they never, ever do.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, he is not married.
SUPFEMALE:He's just a guy i met at that singles dance.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:So, what's wrong with him? Nothing! He's just younger.
OTHERMALE:Well, how much younger is he? way young? like, milk-money young? No! Look, he can drive, he can vote, so let's drop it.
LEADMALE:I'm just not that comfortable with it myself.
SUPMALE:Well, so, is he cute? Yes.
LEADMALE:And he's fun and he's smart.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, god, he's so smart.
LEADMALE:He is so not for me.
SUPMALE:God, you have such low self-esteem.
LEADMALE:You're such an idiot.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:End of conversation.
LEADMALE:Can we move the belt here, please? Well, now, that's not what i meant.
LEADMALE:What i meant was, you know, it's too early for you to know if he's right for you or not, so i think you should let me decide.
LEADMALE:No, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not bringing this one over.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be nice.
LEADFEMALE:You will not.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan will.
LEADMALE:No.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
SUPMALE:Oh, i'm just curious, you know.
LEADMALE:How come somebody like you would have to go to one of those things? Well, 'cause-no, i know why you would.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking to fisher here.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm not the greatest at meeting people, and so i thought i'd give it a try.
SUPFEMALE:And then i saw someone pretty with great legs and this terrific energy, and i thought, wow, that's somebody i got to meet.
OTHERMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Excellent answer.
LEADFEMALE:Compliments will only get you seconds.
LEADFEMALE:I'm home.

LEADMALE:Mom, what was it like to actually sell the house? Actually, it was a huge relief.
LEADMALE:How's dad doing with all this? Well, i imagine he's pretty depressed by the settlement.
SUPMALE:Remember how he always dreamed of retiring? Not going to happen.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, you should see the way your face lit up when you said that.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
SUPMALE:And good reason.
SUPMALE:Why don't you forget the tea for a moment and come sit down? what's going on? Now, you know, i'm going to be getting a lot of money from this house, and i could wait until i die, but i want to see it put to good use now, when you seem to need it so much, so, this is for you.
OTHERMALE:And since you always throw a fit when you're left out of anything, here.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god, it's $10,000! so is this! oh, mom, you have no idea how much we need this right now! oh, god, thank you! this is amazing! mom! Well, it makes me so happy that i have it to give to you, and your father doesn't.
LEADMALE:I think this calls for a celebration at la sizzler.
LEADMALE:And we're all getting our own plates this time.
LEADFEMALE:It's so important to me to see you girls happy.
LEADMALE:I just wish i could do more.
LEADFEMALE:So, i was thinking, since i sold the house, why don't i just move to lanford? And then we can all be together.
LEADMALE:Now, hold the party.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to go freshen up.
SUPMALE:God, she's good.
SUPFEMALE:We have got to stop her.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, the woman just walked in here and handed you $10,000.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sure.
OTHERMALE:Take her side.
SUPFEMALE:Look, we need the money and she needs us.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, can't you just work up some more enthusiasm about this here? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i could use the money to move.
LEADMALE:Work with me here.
SUPFEMALE:She is just trying to butter us up, roseanne, so that she can move to lanford and we can't say a thing about it.
OTHERMALE:Who's moving here? Dan no! dan no, roseanne, no! oh, come on! Dan, she needs to be near her family now.
LEADMALE:No, she doesn't.
LEADFEMALE:She may think she does right now, but after 2 months and i have to kill her, she'll realize how wrong she was! She knew we would all feel this way, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:That's why she's waving this money around! yeah! What money? It's from mom.
LEADFEMALE:Yubba.
SUPMALE:She's just trying to buy us, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you see that? Yeah, i think she hit my price.
LEADMALE:Actually, she could've had me for half.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne! Honey, honey, she's your mother, i'll do whatever it takes, but i just want you to know one thing-i want this money.
LEADMALE:Would you give me that check? You are drooling the zeroes off of it.
LEADMALE:Why do you do all that? It's a lot of responsibility, being a woman.
SUPMALE:God made us the bearer of children, we keep the human race going, and it's all very drying to the skin.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it hardly seems worth it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, darlene, if you're old enough to have a boyfriend, you're old enough to start a beauty ritual.
OTHERMALE:After all, skin is a gift.
SUPFEMALE:I'll remember that.
SUPFEMALE:Did your mother tell you i'm thinking of moving to lanford? really? will you be moving before my birthday? I mean, it's my 16th, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty big.
OTHERMALE:My, that is an important year.
SUPFEMALE:I'm saving up to buy a cd player.
OTHERFEMALE:Sort of a birthday gift to myself.
LEADMALE:A cd player sounds fun.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say you let your grandma buy it for you a little bit early? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't let you do that.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, they're too they're too expensive-the good ones, anyhow.
LEADFEMALE:Nonsense.
OTHERMALE:And if you like, we can just keep it between you and me.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes it's good for us girls to have a little secret.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Hey! Hey, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i have got "loose meat.
SUPFEMALE:" i got 2 words for you too.
SUPMALE:No, it's this great idea i got.
LEADMALE:See, every time i make a run through iowa, i stop at this incredible little diner that sells loose meat sandwiches.
LEADMALE:It's kind of like sloppy joes, but without the slop.
SUPMALE:And anyway, the place is always packed, so i'm thinking maybe we could pool our money and open up a place like that in lanford and be like partners.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, jackie.
SUPMALE:You didn't tell me mom was here.
SUPMALE:Jackie, mom's here.
SUPMALE:Morning, mom.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk about it later.
LEADMALE:No, please, go on.
LEADFEMALE:I always love to hear your little ideas.
LEADMALE:Yeah, so you can criticize them.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not true.
LEADMALE:I think it's wonderful that you have ideas.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't keep having ideas, how are you ever going to come up with a good one? This is a good one.
SUPFEMALE:I have a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't the two of you shut up? Well, i'm sorry, but your sister should know better.
OTHERFEMALE:Starting a business these days is insane! Didn't she learn anything from dan's little bike shop fiasco? mom, what part of "shut up" do you not understand? Well, i can't stand by and let her encourage you to waste my money on one of her foolish ideas.
LEADMALE:Oh, stupid me.
LEADMALE:I thought the money was a gift.
SUPFEMALE:Skin is a gift.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be out in the car.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
OTHERMALE:Where are you going? Nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we're just going to do a little early birthday shopping.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? darlene, what are you trying to weasel out of your grandma? Nothing but love.
LEADMALE:Bull.
LEADFEMALE:And a cd player.
OTHERMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:What, so you get $10,000 and i get nothing? Well, you know what they say, darlene-wealth always skips a generation.
LEADMALE:Out.
LEADFEMALE:No cd player, mom.
LEADFEMALE:How many times have we had this conversation? I told you i want you to stop spoiling the kids.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't doing anything wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then why were you trying to do it behind my back? Because you force us to do things that way, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:No one can do anything in this house without you interfering.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's because it's my house.
LEADMALE:I like it this way.
SUPFEMALE:I like the kids poor.
LEADMALE:That way they don't clash with the furniture.
SUPMALE:For god's sake, why deprive the child just because you're struggling? Learn from your mistakes.
LEADFEMALE:What is that supposed to mean? Well, maybe if you'd have been a little more concerned about becky's happiness, she'd still be here.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Take your check back.
OTHERMALE:Jackie's right.
OTHERMALE:It's never gonna work with you moving here, 'cause it'll always be like this.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't i just leave now? fine! see you at thanksgiving! What'd you invite her to thanksgiving for? can i come in? It's your house.
LEADMALE:You can do whatever you like.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is hard for me to say.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
SUPFEMALE:You'll feel better.
SUPFEMALE:I want the check back.
LEADFEMALE:Pardon me? Well, you gave it to us 'cause we needed it, and we still need it.
OTHERMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:I told you it was yours.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like i don't appreciate it or nothing.
LEADMALE:Well, you have a frightening way of showing it.
LEADFEMALE:I've never felt so unwelcome here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure you have.
LEADMALE:What are you gonna do now? Oh, i suppose i'll go back to moline and rent a little apartment.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe i'll buy some new furniture, and then i'll just sit in a room until it's time to lie in a box.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least you have a plan.
LEADMALE:Maybe i'll get one of those life alert things so i'll have someone to talk to.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, mom.
LEADMALE:Don't do this.
SUPMALE:Now, would you please get dan to help me with these bags? Come on, mom.
LEADFEMALE:We all got mad and said stuff that we didn't mean.
LEADFEMALE:Now, put the bags down and we'll talk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne! Get in here, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, we both know we can't leave it like this.
LEADMALE:Mom, maybe you could move here to lanford if we would just agree on some stuff first.
SUPMALE:I'm listening.
LEADMALE:All right, well, first of all-you can't leave your house.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, what i say goes around here.
LEADFEMALE:And no more of this secret present crap either.
LEADMALE:And i do not want to hear one more word about how we screwed up with the shop or how we screwed up with becky.
SUPMALE:And i want you to respect the fact that i'm an adult and i can make my own decisions.
OTHERFEMALE:And there are certain things that i don't want to hear anymore, like "flaky," "skinny," "die a spinster.
LEADMALE:" that's just for mom, right? Jackie, i only tell you these things because i want to see you do something with your life before it's too late.
SUPMALE:Call us when you get home, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I can't say anything to you girls, can i? now you're getting it! What, is that what you really want? no, but if you're gonna move here, it's just like, we have to make a lot of changes, you know? We'll have to get used to it.
SUPFEMALE:We'll have to change and you'll have to change.
LEADMALE:But right now, let's start with you.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:What do you have in mind? Well, maybe it would work if we just try being friends.
LEADFEMALE:We are friends.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, we're not.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't she cute? No, see, friends are not judgmental, and there's camaraderie, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Friends don't drive you into therapy.
LEADFEMALE:Therapy? who's in therapy? Roseanne not important.
OTHERMALE:So, how do you feel, mom? All right.
SUPMALE:I'll be friends.
SUPFEMALE:If i'm wanted.
LEADMALE:Jackie okay, friends.
SUPFEMALE:All right, well, now let's go downstairs and practice being friends.
LEADMALE:Not mothers and daughters, but friends.
LEADFEMALE:Not too weird.
LEADMALE:All right, this could be fun.
LEADFEMALE:And, you know, as your friend, i just want to tell you you're treating your mother very badly.
LEADFEMALE:Here's one.
LEADFEMALE:Large patio, and it's very reasonable.
LEADMALE:Hey, jackie, isn't that your block? No.
LEADFEMALE:That'd be great.
LEADMALE:You and mom could be neighbors.
SUPMALE:No, you don't want that apartment, mom.
OTHERMALE:I know that building.
SUPFEMALE:Bad snake problem.
LEADFEMALE:"snake problem"? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Big ones.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, didn't i see a "for rent" sign, though, out front of the bowman house next door? Oh, yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, i just hope they've hosed all the blood off the walls.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:You girls just keep fighting over me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, your boyfriend's here!
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE: so you want to do something tonight? We're spending the day together.
LEADMALE:That's enough.
SUPFEMALE:How about this weekend? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll let you know tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, we have to talk.
LEADMALE:Ever since we started going out, it's like you have all the power in this relationship, and i have nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I need a soda.
LEADMALE:Oh, there's only do you want ice? Hi, i'm molly tilden.
LEADFEMALE:My family just moved in next door.
SUPFEMALE:And you're telling me this because my dad said the owner gave you guys the keys.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:They're in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
OTHERMALE:I'm darlene.
LEADFEMALE:That's david.
LEADMALE:Every house should have one.
OTHERMALE:Hi, i'm molly.
OTHERFEMALE:My dad got transferred here from iowa.
OTHERMALE:We're renting the house next door.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, the conners are a pretty cool family.
LEADMALE:I'm not one of them, but, uh oh, hold on a minute.
SUPMALE:Your tag is out.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Here's your key.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Okay, it was nice meeting you guys.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you around.
SUPMALE:I'll see you at school.
OTHERFEMALE:She seemed nice.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hey, hold on a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Your tag's out.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:So, did fisherman dump you yet? No, but thanks for asking.
LEADMALE:Well, i was just checking, because dan me our new next-door neighbor, and it turns out that he's, like, a single dad.
SUPFEMALE:So? So i was thinking, you know, new guy in town, and he's single, he don't know nothing about you.
SUPMALE:Total sitting duck.
SUPMALE:And here i was nice enough to bring you lunch.
OTHERFEMALE:From where? Nowhere.
SUPMALE:Just a little sandwich shop i know.
LEADMALE:Is it that loose-meat thing from iowa? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:No! Now, roseanne, look.
SUPFEMALE:I know it's a risk, but mom gave us both $10,000, and i really think this business could take off.
SUPMALE:Yeah, or go right down the tubes.
LEADMALE:I mean, poverty is grand, but we've done that.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Just taste it.
SUPMALE:What are you afraid of? That you're gonna love it and you're gonna want to do this with me.
SUPFEMALE:No, i just don't want to eat anything that's been fermenting on your dashboard in your stinky truck for 5 hours.
LEADMALE:I'm starving.
SUPMALE:Please feed me.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, jeannie.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's terrific! What is that? Oh, just from a great little restaurant i know in iowa.
SUPMALE:Yeah? could you go back and get me some fries? Okay, my birthday's on friday, i'm turning 16, i'm getting my license.
LEADMALE:Can i have a car? No.
LEADFEMALE:Eh, it was worth a shot.
LEADMALE:Way to commit, darlene.
LEADMALE:Well, how about getting becky's car running again? It's just been sitting in the driveway for months.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:We'd have to kick those gypsies out.
SUPFEMALE:Car's shot, darlene.
LEADMALE:Well, you could fix it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, dan, you could use those hours that you waste between midnight and 6 just laying there in the bed unconscious.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take a shot, but i don't think it'll work.
LEADMALE:So any more dreams we can crush for you, darlene? No, that'll just about do it.
SUPFEMALE:Happy birthday, though.
LEADFEMALE:Man, her sweet 16.
SUPFEMALE:Amazing.
SUPFEMALE:You know, you really ought to do something special for her.
LEADFEMALE:You mean passing her big head through my loins wasn't enough? what? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I know something you don't know what? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:Then get out.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but it's really good.
LEADMALE:What? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that's it.
SUPMALE:Let me go! Don't make me shave your eyebrows again.
SUPMALE:Mom's giving you a sweet 16 birthday party, okay? oh, my god! Is she planning a surprise party for me? who? My psycho freak of a mother.
LEADFEMALE:Is she planning to throw me some sort of white-trash debutante ball? Don't be silly.
LEADMALE:A party for you? Please.
LEADFEMALE:Drop it.
LEADFEMALE:Rat boy already talked.
LEADMALE:Hair up would be nice.
SUPMALE:There's no way in hell i'm going through with that.
LEADFEMALE:Cancel the clown.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.
SUPMALE:Look, i know how wrong it is for someone like you who is so in touch with the dark forces to have a sweet 16.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:But it's a party.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Some cake, ice cream, presents, a few friends you invited my friends? Yeah, she seemed like a very sweet girl.
LEADMALE:My life sucks enough without this extra humiliation.
OTHERMALE:In case you haven't noticed, things haven't been exactly great for anyone around here.
SUPFEMALE:This stupid party means a lot to your mom.
LEADMALE:Why? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it gives her something to look forward to.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe she doesn't know how to tell you she loves you anymore.
SUPMALE:You scare the hell out of us.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, likewise.
LEADFEMALE:Please, i'd consider it a personal favor.
LEADMALE:I'd owe you big-time.
LEADFEMALE:How big? Real big.
LEADFEMALE:Like, "d.j. needs a new lung, but darlene's leather jacket comes first"? Okay, jacket before lung.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe i'm going through with this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe i'll get lucky and choke on my free meal at lenny's.
SUPMALE:Denny's.
SUPMALE:Jackie, would you hurry up? I got to wash that tablecloth for the party.
LEADFEMALE:Just doing my whites.
LEADFEMALE:I'll save the rest for later.
LEADFEMALE:How fast they grow up.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, it seems like just yesterday i was teaching her how to hold her little pinky flat when she flipped people off.
LEADMALE:Remember when we were 16 and we said we wanted to die before we were 40 and we got all old and gross? Yeah, i'd totally forgotten about that.
OTHERFEMALE:And here here you are, turning 40.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that a riot? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Is the coast clear? Yeah, yeah, come in.
LEADFEMALE:Did you get the camera? Yep.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, my mom was a little funny about me taking it, but as long as you're careful with it well, it's not like i haven't had a hundred cameras or anything.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, would you get that? so, how do you get the film in? I'll load it.
SUPMALE:I'll load it.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, these girls just moved into the buman house next door.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, i'm molly.
SUPFEMALE:This is my older sister, charlotte.
LEADMALE:Hi, i'm roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:This is my older sister, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Charlotte made us some cookies.
SUPMALE:"us"? since when do you live here? Give me them.
OTHERFEMALE:They're really nothing special.
LEADMALE:No, charlotte.
SUPFEMALE:That was so nice of you.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, roseanne, that plate looks just like yours.
LEADMALE:Well, we found a whole set in the dishwasher.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I must've forgotten to take that last load out.
LEADFEMALE:You guys moved in so damn fast.
SUPFEMALE:It's ready.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, great.
OTHERMALE:David these are our new neighbors.
OTHERMALE:This is molly, and that's charlotte edging her way out the door over there.
LEADMALE:Hey, david.
OTHERMALE:You're here a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you too.
LEADFEMALE:You guys know each other? Yeah, we met before.
SUPFEMALE:Tag's in.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene! get down here now! Darlene's here? is it okay if i go up and get her? you have met darlene, haven't you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She seemed nice.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Go on up.
LEADFEMALE:It's second door on the right.
SUPFEMALE:And if i don't get to see you again, thanks for the cookies.
OTHERFEMALE:See you tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice meeting you.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:So, charlotte okay, charlotte, that's enough about you.
SUPMALE:Come on over here, stop that yakking and help us out with these cookies.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? darlene? Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Your mom's calling you.
LEADMALE:Who's talking, please? It's me, molly.
LEADMALE:Oh, right.
SUPFEMALE:The tag patrol.
LEADFEMALE:You always barge into strange people's bathrooms without knocking? I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't think it'd be a big deal.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted you to meet my sister.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bring her up.
SUPMALE:Bring the whole family up.
SUPMALE:Got a dog? Hey, it's okay.
LEADMALE:You can just meet her later.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just hang here and keep you company.
LEADFEMALE:So what are you doing? Interpretive dance.
LEADFEMALE:No, seriously.
LEADMALE:I'm dyeing my hair black.
OTHERMALE:Really? why? Well, my mom's throwing me this really stupid party, and i want to tick her off.
SUPMALE:Hey, you know, when i want to make my dad really mad, i wear my bright red lipstick.
LEADMALE:Oh, you rebel! You know, maybe i should dye my hair.
OTHERMALE:This one time, i thought about doing something really drastic.
LEADMALE:I almost cut all my hair off like demi moore in ghost.
OTHERMALE:You know what's funny here, molly? You keep talking to me like i'm listening.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, i can take a hint.
LEADMALE:You know, you come off real sarcastic and all, but i got a feeling we're gonna become really good friends.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Happy birthday, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Stop pretending there's no party, david.
LEADFEMALE:I knew about it 2 days ago.
LEADMALE:Darlene, there is no party.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come on.
SUPMALE:We're gonna be late.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:The power must've gone out.
LEADFEMALE:You sicken me.
OTHERMALE:Okay, look.
LEADFEMALE:So they're throwing you a stupid party.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:We'll just go in and laugh at it.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Open the door and shove me hard.
SUPMALE:Surprise! It is the night we've waited for because you're not a baby anymore you've turned into the prettiest girl we've ever seen happy birthday, sweet 16 oh, now, you didn't think we'd let your without a proper conner celebration, did you? Oh, your hair.
OTHERMALE:I love your hair! Oh, doesn't the princess look grown up? Oh, look at her.
LEADFEMALE:She's got a bosom.
LEADMALE:Get in with the birthday girl.
SUPMALE:Come on, get together, get together! Make sure you get the button.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and make it fast, because the quicker we're done here, the faster we get to the dance contest! okay, 1, 2, 3, cheese! cheese! Okay, now, just one of the birthday girl.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, darlene, here, think fast.
LEADMALE:What are these for? Well, it's amazing.
SUPFEMALE:Becky's car seems to be running fine now.
SUPFEMALE:And here.
SUPMALE:I think this ought to be enough to buy you and your fellow creatures dinner and a movie.
LEADMALE:They're waiting for you at the pizza king.
LEADFEMALE:Surprise! we want you to leave! yes! that's just what i always wanted! Well, i know my kid.
SUPFEMALE:So wait.
LEADFEMALE:You mean this whole party thing was just a big joke? You put me through hell! Well, that was kind of for us.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe she just doesn't know how to tell you she loves you anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Sucker! So, you're not gone yet? Leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darlene? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I hate your hair.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, mommy! At my sweet 16, my mother made us wear white gloves and eat these teeny sandwiches.
LEADMALE:Ew! it was so nauseating! Mine was great.
LEADMALE:Me and my friends waited for hours in the rain to see three dog night.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i remember mine.
SUPMALE:Me and dan went and got really drunk and had sex.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:That sounds like a great birthday! If i'd have known then how many years i had ahead of me to get drunk and have sex with dan, i would've had the party.
LEADFEMALE:Remember how exciting it was when we were 16 and we had to sneak around to be with our boyfriends-remember that? Yeah, sometimes when me and dan are having sex, i'll call my mom up and tell her i'm over at debbie's.
LEADMALE:Sex was so great then.
LEADMALE:It just doesn't have that kind of passion anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:You and arnie were all over each other.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, we had mind-shattering orgasms, but it was kind of lacking romance.
LEADMALE:You had orgasms? Yeah, but i was looking for poetry and flowers.
SUPFEMALE:Instead i got limericks and edible panties.
OTHERFEMALE:The weird thing is, after you've been with your husband for a while, your priorities change, you know what i mean? Sex and romance-eh, they're not what they used to be.
LEADFEMALE:More punch? You know i am.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i used to love it when dan could go all night, you know.
LEADMALE:Now i really love it when he just sleeps.
OTHERMALE:I got stuff to do.
OTHERMALE:We sound like a bunch of old, married women.
LEADFEMALE:This is supposed to be a party.
LEADFEMALE:I think we should play a game.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're right.
LEADMALE:This is a sweet 16 party.
LEADFEMALE:How about we play truth or dare? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Who's gonna be first? Me! me! Ask me first.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Truth or dare? I'll take truth.
LEADMALE:When was the last time you were felt up at the movies? Oh, that's a good one.
LEADMALE:It was last night.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on! oh, no! You went to the movies by yourself last night.
LEADMALE:I did not! i did not! I went with fisher.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Okay, you're through.
OTHERMALE:You're boring me.
LEADMALE:Okay, my turn.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i'll take this one.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll take this one.
LEADFEMALE:Truth or dare.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, truth.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Wouldn't you really like to be partners with me and nancy in our new restaurant? you and nancy? Yeah, i'm going in on the business too.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that wild? you guys are gonna do it without me? You said you didn't want to do it.
SUPFEMALE:No, i didn't.
LEADMALE:I said i couldn't do it.
SUPFEMALE:What's the difference? There's a huge difference, jackie.
OTHERMALE:"i don't want to do it" means you can go ahead and do it yourself, but "i can't do it" means you can't do it either.
LEADFEMALE:So you are interested.
LEADFEMALE:Truth? I'm taking dare.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, she said truth! double dare, double dare, double dare, double dare! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Double dare.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I double dare you to, um, go out to the mud porch, take off your shirt, run screaming through the backyard into the garage, and flash dan.
LEADMALE:Oh, flash my husband of 19 years-it's so risque.
SUPMALE:You got to do it, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I know! i'm gonna do it! jeez, shut up! Next thing, you're gonna dare me to have 3 kids.
SUPFEMALE:Keep moving.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Why don't you dare me to make a meat loaf.
SUPMALE:Ooh! Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:So damn stupid, i can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and no bra.
LEADMALE:It's cold out here! Double dare.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna beat you up later.
SUPFEMALE:Looking forward to it.
LEADFEMALE:She's catching speed! look at her! good form! Hey, let's lock her out.
LEADMALE:Let's turn on the sprinklers.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Here she comes.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god.
OTHERMALE:What's wrong? [excited chattering oh, my god.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:What? rosie? I'd like you to meet our new neighbor, ty tilden.
LEADFEMALE:Ty, this is my wife, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you sure know how to make a guy feel welcome.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that funny.
SUPMALE:Yes, it was! it was a classic! You're supposed to say something to make me feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Well, i don't think ty got hit with anything.
LEADFEMALE:No, but you did.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll never mention it again.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan? Happy birthday.
LEADMALE:Huh? well, you know this idea that jackie's got about this loose-meat sandwich place? it's really stupid, isn't it? I don't know.
LEADMALE:It's sure a tough time to open a business.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADMALE:It is really stupid.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:'course, it would be kind of cool to have something of my own.
SUPMALE:You know, i've never had that.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? Everything that's mine is yours.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, your stuff's no good.
LEADMALE:Oh, just forget i even brought it up.
SUPMALE:Okay? Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Night.
SUPMALE:Well, it's not that crazy.
LEADMALE:You know.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? after what we went through with the bike shop? yeah, but like jackie says, you know, this place, it's got, like, a line around the block, and you loved the sandwich, so i'm just thinking, when are we ever gonna get another chunk of money like this? And i just think, you know, we spend it, and we have nothing to show for it except for some stack of paid bills.
LEADMALE:We could learn to live with that, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Listen to me.
SUPMALE:I sound just like jackie.
OTHERMALE:Okay, i'm not bringing it up again.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're right about the money from bev.
SUPMALE:It's only gonna last so long.
SUPMALE:Well, yeah, but we can make it stretch.
LEADMALE:Yeah, for 7 of 8 months, and we're right back where we were before, living week to week.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Shouldn't the money go to d.j. 's college or towards darlene's bail? It'll never last that long.
LEADMALE:If this business sticks, then we got a shot at something better.
LEADMALE:I don't know, dan.
LEADFEMALE:"roseanne conner, loose-meat queen.
LEADFEMALE:" sounds good.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Classy.
SUPMALE:Take the shot, honey.
SUPMALE:Oh, all right, if it means that much to you.
LEADMALE:I just want you to be happy.
LEADMALE:Thank you, dear.
SUPMALE:Of course, you know if it fails, i'm gonna blame you.
SUPFEMALE:Wouldn't have it any other way.
SUPMALE:Tra-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la happy birthday, sweet 16 tra-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la happy birthday, sweet 16 tonight's the night i've waited for because you're not a baby anymore you've turned into the prettiest girl i've ever seen happy birthday sweet 16 tra-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la happy birthday sweet 16 tra-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la happy birthday sweet 16
LEADFEMALE:Hyah! hyah! ooh-hah! That was fun.
LEADFEMALE:You're a way better babysitter than darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah, you let me out of my room.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i love these games.
LEADFEMALE:We used to play them all the time back in iowa.
LEADFEMALE:Without electricity? what? Darlene says there's no electricity or lights where you come from, but that's okay, 'cause you can't read anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? well, what else did she say? You guys keep live chickens in your kitchen and kill them with your bare hands.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Yeah, but there's one part i don't get.
OTHERMALE:How can someone's sister be their mom? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi, molly.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, david.
LEADMALE:You can go now.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Just tell your mom she can pay me tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh, you didn't get the money up front? Well, you'll learn.
SUPMALE:Well, she better pay, 'cause we're savin' up so we can get us one of them talkin' picture boxes.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? Oh, you know, now that we got 'lectricity.
OTHERMALE:Bye-bye, now.
LEADFEMALE:Why, thank you, david.
SUPFEMALE:Sleep tight.
SUPFEMALE:You're about to become a strange smell in the attic.
OTHERMALE:What are you smiling about? Nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:You don't go for that flirty, cutesy, barbie-doll crap, do you? I mean, she was so obvious.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I guess for some guys, it'd probably make 'em feel, you know, like a man.
LEADMALE:I can make you feel like a man, david.
SUPFEMALE:Take out the trash.
OTHERFEMALE:We're back! Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:I've been holding it in since the illinois state line! Hey, you drink the big gulp, you suffer the consequences.
SUPFEMALE:What a riot! I haven't been in the flatbed of a pickup since i son't know when.
SUPMALE:It's a totally different experience sitting up, ain't it, jackie? Darlene, d.j. ! Here it is.
LEADFEMALE:Iowa's best-selling sandwich comes to lanford.
LEADMALE:Onasis had ships, hilton had hotels, we got loose meat.
LEADMALE:What reeks? Your future.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, that smells about right.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you guys drove all that way just to copy some greasy diner.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if we're gonna be successful in business, we're gonna have to steal the idea from somebody.
LEADFEMALE:You should've seen it, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:People were shoving loose meat in their faces as fast as they could get their hands on it.
LEADMALE:Well, why not just drop a carcass on the table and let them gnaw till they're full? Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Don't step on my buzz, okay? This means a lot to me.
LEADFEMALE:I would like to have something to show for my life besides stretch marks.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I just can't believe we're gonna make money by clogging people's arteries with the fat of poor, slaughtered animals.
OTHERFEMALE:Cool, isn't it? Yeah, don't knock it till you've tried it, darlene.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Take a bite for daddy.
SUPMALE:Come on, darlene.
OTHERMALE:All the really cool kids are doing it.
LEADFEMALE:You would be so popular if you did.
LEADFEMALE:All right, get that thing away from me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna eat some animal's face.
OTHERMALE:You don't eat the face.
SUPMALE:You mount it on the wall as a tribute.
LEADMALE:Okay, i've sketched out their floor plan.
LEADFEMALE:I say we stick to the original as best we can, 'cause whatever they're doing works.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you one thing we're gonna do differently.
LEADMALE:We're gonna put a lock on the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:And the door.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. ! Darlene, do you know if he ate dinner? Oh, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I think molly probably took him out back and slopped him.
OTHERMALE:Would you please go get him? I want him to come down and taste one of these sandwiches.
OTHERMALE:Oh, did molly say how much i owe her for babysitting? You know, funniest thing-she said she couldn't take money for helping us out.
OTHERFEMALE:It wouldn't be neighborly.
SUPMALE:What a nice girl.
SUPMALE:D.j. ! Mom said that she wants-oh, i'm sorry, deej.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know you were asleep.
SUPFEMALE:Like i'm really gonna buy that, you stupid little loser.
SUPMALE:What are you up to? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? well, then, what's this? I was looking at the stars.
OTHERFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, would you look at that.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a constellation in the shape of a naked next-door neighbor.
LEADMALE:I wasn't watching her.
SUPFEMALE:You were peeping at molly.
LEADFEMALE:She's your babysitter, you little perv.
LEADMALE:I didn't do it.
LEADFEMALE:I hate girls.
LEADMALE:You know what happens the next time you do it? I'm telling mom and dad, and then you get hauled off to jail, where peepers like you get their eyelids sewn shut so they can never peep again.
LEADFEMALE:All right, go downstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Mom wants you to try a loose-meat sandwich.
LEADFEMALE:That's punishment enough for now.
LEADMALE:I knew she stuffed.
SUPMALE:Well? yeah, what do you think, dan? did we get the recipe or not? Fruity, yet bovine.
LEADMALE:And impudent little sandwich.
LEADFEMALE:Bingo.
SUPFEMALE:Yes! It's great.
LEADMALE:It's just kind of hard to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Well, see, therein lies the beauty.
OTHERMALE:You drop half of it on your lap, and then you're forced to buy another one.
SUPMALE:I'll take another one.
LEADFEMALE:Coming right up.
LEADMALE:What? It's just so neat, you know, being in the kitchen with my guy all hungry, waiting for food.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, it really is neat, you know? And if you play your cards right, you get to do it every day, until one of you dies.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now, we got the recipe and we've got the money, and nancy's out looking for the place, so that means that so far we have the recipe and the money.
LEADFEMALE:So, what we need now is a real catchy name.
LEADFEMALE:How about lanford custom cycle? I know where you can get a sign real cheap.
LEADFEMALE:No, something real catchy like, sandwiches and stuff.
LEADMALE:Lunch and munch.
LEADMALE:Eat and go.
LEADFEMALE:Beef and barf.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Let's think about this, then.
SUPMALE:Meat, beef.
LEADMALE:Beefy.
OTHERMALE:Bun.
LEADFEMALE:Sandwich.
SUPMALE:Sandwich, bun.
SUPMALE:The sandwich bun.
SUPMALE:I don't have anything.
OTHERMALE:What's the matter with you, d.j. ? You guys are in there doing all this stuff about the restaurant, and i don't get to do anything.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's your restaurant too.
LEADMALE:You can do whatever you want to do.
LEADMALE:Cool! i get to name the place! Well, uh, d.j. mom says i get to name the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:From the boy who named his goldfish "fluffy.
OTHERFEMALE:" hey, he couldn't do any worse than us.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead, give it a shot.
LEADMALE:The lunch box.
SUPMALE:That's pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:"lunch box" it is.
LEADMALE:Way to go, deej.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, lunch box.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Guess what? We found a place.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:'cause we got a name, and we cracked the recipe.
LEADMALE:Yeah, here, taste it, nance.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Me first.
SUPMALE:This is kerry thompson, the realtor who's been showing me around.
LEADMALE:Hi, kerry.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Tell them about the place.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:You know the pizza palace on route 42? Yeah, that's the place with the mural of the last supper, but everyone's eating pizza.
OTHERMALE:Really, the place is okay.
SUPFEMALE:Tell them it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPMALE:But we have a problem.
LEADMALE:Tell them we have a problem.
LEADMALE:We have a problem.
OTHERMALE:I don't think you guys have enough money.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? We have $30,000.
SUPFEMALE:Well, have your accountant crunch the numbers, but i haven't heard of anyone opening up even the smallest place for under 40, not even if we skimp on the health codes and stuff? I'm just being honest.
LEADMALE:Well, we're screwed.
SUPFEMALE:There's no way any bank's gonna loan us a dime.
SUPFEMALE:But you didn't let me finish.
LEADFEMALE:There's a thing we can do.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell them about the thing-would you stop that? I was telling nancy that we might want to try the small business administration.
LEADMALE:It's this government office where people like you can go and get start-up loans to get your business going.
LEADMALE:They're never gonna give us any money.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, they will.
OTHERMALE:We have a legitimate idea.
LEADMALE:We'll just go in there and tell them the truth.
LEADMALE:Sounds great.
LEADMALE:We'll go down tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow? I can't come up with the truth by tomorrow.
LEADMALE:"donald bobeck"" donald-that's a friendly name.
OTHERMALE:Lot of friendly donalds.
LEADMALE:Donald duck, donald sutherland, uh, donald, uh, um "that girl's" boyfriend.
OTHERFEMALE:He was so friendly.
LEADFEMALE:What was his last name? could you shut up? What are you so nervous about? "hollinger.
LEADMALE:" what? "that girl's" boyfriend's last name was hollinger.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Well, could you just keep that under your hat until they ask? Look at this pamphlet here.
OTHERFEMALE:It's got this whole section on minorities.
SUPMALE:It says that they give special consideration to businesses run by women.
SUPMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:That's our angle.
LEADMALE:We're women.
SUPMALE:I say we go with it.
OTHERMALE:Thank god we all brought our ovaries with us.
OTHERMALE:Hi, there.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry to keep you waiting.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:We're all real patient, being women and all.
SUPMALE:Uh, mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner and, uh ms.
LEADFEMALE:Harris.
SUPFEMALE:Just nancy.
LEADFEMALE:Now, why don't you tell me about this business you want to start? Well, okay.
LEADMALE:Uh well, it's a restaurant, see? But more.
OTHERMALE:A lot more.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna serve loose-meat sandwiches.
LEADMALE:"loose meat"? yeah, well, it's kind of like, uh, early on, when mcdonalds just started, you know? Because the whole thing's based on this hamburger thing, only ours looks really weird, but then you can buy chips and pie and stuff.
OTHERMALE:And pop.
SUPMALE:In cans.
LEADMALE:Interesting.
SUPFEMALE:Have any of you had previous experience in running a restaurant? Oh, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I have.
LEADFEMALE:I was, uh, well, the best waitress at rodbell's.
OTHERFEMALE:I should have been put up into management, but they kind of held me back because i'm a woman.
LEADMALE:And you, ms.
LEADMALE:Harris? I have hauled meat.
SUPFEMALE:I have eaten meat.
OTHERFEMALE:Nancy? I'm gonna have to take a pass on this one, don.
LEADMALE:Which, of course, we all know is a woman's prerogative.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we do have special provisions for minorities and the handicapped.
LEADFEMALE:I assume none of you are handicapped.
OTHERMALE:I have 3 kids.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in therapy.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:And what bank will you be going through? Oh, we're not going through a bank.
LEADMALE:Don, that's why we're here! No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you understand.
LEADMALE:You see, what we do here at the s.
LEADMALE:B.
LEADMALE:A.
SUPMALE:Is guarantee the loan.
OTHERFEMALE:You still have to get the money from the bank.
LEADMALE:Well, so what do you call it the small business administration for? what don't you call it the "get your own damn money administration"? Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, don't get excited.
LEADMALE:Well, now, we came to you to get some money.
LEADFEMALE:So do you guys have any money or not? Well, we almost never give direct loans.
OTHERFEMALE:The government changed the rules.
LEADMALE:Now we make a deal with the bank so if your business folds, the bank will get most of its money back.
LEADMALE:Well, that sucks.
LEADMALE:So you're in business with banks.
LEADMALE:What about us, you know? Banks have tons of money, and we don't got any.
LEADFEMALE:Don't blow it, roseanne.
SUPMALE:This guy can help us get a loan if he wants to recommend us.
OTHERMALE:Will you recommend us? Not likely.
LEADMALE:Based on our criteria, we consider you a bad risk.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what a bad risk is.
SUPFEMALE:That's you sitting across this desk from me, calling me a bad risk.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You know, the s.
LEADMALE:B.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADMALE:Is supposed to be set up to help people like us.
LEADFEMALE:Y'all don't know nothing about people like us.
SUPMALE:The trouble with people who work for the government is y'all have jobs.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes? I think you should know i was in my room getting ready for bed, and i saw your brother watching me.
OTHERMALE:Again? "again"? Yeah, i caught him doing it about a week ago.
LEADFEMALE:And you didn't do anything? Yeah, i told him he wouldn't get much money for the pictures.
SUPFEMALE:I told him to stop.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot for all your help.
SUPMALE:Look, what was i supposed to do? You could've told me.
LEADMALE:Oh, i forgot.
SUPFEMALE:You're not from these parts.
SUPMALE:Well, here in the big city, when you change in front of an open window, you're not just amusing the sheep.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, what do you have against me? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:I just feel that we're at that point in our friendship where you should realize that we don't have one.
SUPMALE:I mean it.
SUPFEMALE:What did i ever do to you? is this because david flirts with me? I think you have that backwards.
SUPFEMALE:You're the one always pulling the touchy-feely routine every time he's around.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to be nice.
LEADMALE:Well, he's not used to being treated that way, okay? All right, look.
SUPMALE:Maybe i came on a little strong the other day, but i was mad at you.
LEADMALE:Just trust me.
SUPMALE:I'm not interested in david, okay? Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:And i'm sure david doesn't like me.
OTHERFEMALE:I know that.
SUPMALE:I didn't say he liked you.
OTHERMALE:I said, cut the boy-toy crap.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I know he doesn't like you.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine! fine! So anyway, are you gonna do something about your brother? Yeah, i'll take care of it.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i hope so, 'cause he could grow up to be a really disturbed individual.
LEADMALE:You don't understand, here, molly.
LEADMALE:This is the most normal thing he's ever done.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, at least you tried.
SUPFEMALE:I guess now i'm back to trucking.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and i guess i'm back to looking for some low-paying crap job.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, honey.
LEADMALE:You'll find one.
LEADMALE:Damn it, dan, i really wanted this, you know? I wanted it really, really bad! I know, rosie.
LEADMALE:It's not fair! I know, jackie.
LEADMALE:How come our lives always have to be the ones that suck, huh? i don't know, rosie? how come we never get one little thing that we want? I don't know, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:This is all your fault, jackie.
SUPMALE:My fault? Yeah! You're the one that dragged that damn ray of hope into this house.
LEADMALE:I just can't believe it's gonna end like this.
LEADMALE:There's got to be somebody to loan us the money.
SUPMALE:How about crystal and ed? Nah, they got 3 kids and a mortgage.
SUPMALE:Chuck and anne-marie.
SUPFEMALE:He's still looking for work.
LEADFEMALE:Gil and patty.
OTHERMALE:No, they're barely getting by like everybody else we know.
LEADFEMALE:We got to get a better class of friends.
OTHERMALE:There's got to be somebody who can give us $10,000 like mom did.
SUPFEMALE:It's an awful lot of money.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to the 10,000 i gave you last week? Aw, cripes, mom, we blew that on candy and records.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i told you it was a big mistake.
LEADMALE:Now, hold on! I didn't say no.
SUPFEMALE:Just give me a few minutes.
SUPMALE:Well, now, you've got to use your imagination, ma.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you've got to picture it full of people.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's gonna look way different full of people, mom.
LEADMALE:It's not gonna look so empty.
LEADMALE:Yes, jackie, i suppose it is the kind of place your trucker friends would frequent.
SUPMALE:Would you like to see the oven, mom? I think i smell mice.
SUPFEMALE:What are we doing? This is our dream.
SUPFEMALE:We can't have a dream with mom in it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't think about it as asking for her help.
SUPMALE:Think about it as draining her nest egg.
LEADFEMALE:This water is yellow! oh, god, oh, god, oh, god! help me drain the water here! Listen, trust me, this is the perfect place to hit her up for money.
LEADFEMALE:And if she says no, it's the perfect place to dump the body.
SUPMALE:Well, i've decided.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to lend you the money.
LEADMALE:Big, fat waste of time.
SUPMALE:However, what i will do is put up the $10,000 and become your fourth partner.
LEADMALE:But i want you to know, i'm not doing this for you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doing it for me.
OTHERMALE:I never had a chance to do anything like this before.
OTHERFEMALE:So, do we have a deal? Deal.
LEADMALE:This is where the thunder claps and the sky turns black.
SUPFEMALE:I'll write you a check tomorrow.
LEADMALE:You know what would look great on these walls? Some paintings i've been doing.
SUPFEMALE:Painting-i've been painting.
LEADMALE:Listen.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, now, listen.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:Just think of it like this, okay? From now on, you'll be able to write off your therapy as a business expense.
LEADMALE:Your little brother's doing it again.
LEADFEMALE:I told you i'd take care of it, and i did.
LEADMALE:D.j. ! What are you calling him down here for? He'll never admit it.
SUPMALE:Oh, he won't have to.
SUPMALE:I put shoe polish on the eye of his telescope so he'll be branded for the deviant that he is.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want? Brilliant plan.
SUPFEMALE:Should have worked.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What? hi, guys! Guess what? We found a place.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:'cause we got a name, and we cracked the recipe.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Here, taste it, nance.
OTHERMALE:No, wait.
SUPMALE:Me first.
LEADMALE:This is kerry thompson, the realtor who's been showing me around.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Well, hello, kerry.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have a card, kerry?
SUPMALE:Well, gee, becky, what kind of person takes a job without finding out if they'd get off for halloween first? well, can't mark call in sick? what do you mean, "that's lying"? where were you raised? No, i don't want him to get fired.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe next year, then.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Hey jackie.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Happy halloween.
SUPMALE:Listen, your mom's really bummed out, and i'm gonna try and help her get back her halloween spirit.
LEADMALE:You want to help? Not interested.
LEADFEMALE:I'd give you 20 bucks.
OTHERMALE:Interested.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the plan.
OTHERMALE:Now, we just want to get a rise out of her.
SUPMALE:So one thing that usually always-please, jackie, i think i know how to scare my mother.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Happy halloween.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you see the great pumpkin last night? No.
LEADFEMALE:Dan wore pajamas.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, roseanne, did you see that evidently in nebraska, where they grow corn foruh, various corn products, there has been a rash of farmers losing body parts in threshing machines.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god, that's an ear! Give it up, jackie.
LEADMALE:Aw, man.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, jackie? what did you do with the inside of the pumpkin? I put it down the garbage disposal.
SUPFEMALE:That wasn't good? Oh, no, jackie, that wasn't good.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man! Ugh.
SUPMALE:Turn that light on, will ya? aah! aah! oh, my god! oh, my god, roseanne, help! oh, my god, dan! oh, my god! You want to hand me that towel there? Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:You gonna be okay, honey? Let me put it this way.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, come on, rosie.
SUPMALE:I built that great costume for us.
LEADFEMALE:You'll play a few tasteless pranks on people.
LEADFEMALE:Everything'll be fine once we get down to the lodge party.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm, i ain't goin'.
LEADMALE:What? This is our special day.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i know you're upset about becky, but-it's not just becky, it's everything.
LEADFEMALE:After what we've been through this year, i just don't feel like puttin' on some stupid costume and partyin'.
LEADMALE:Say it ain't so, rose.
LEADMALE:I don't know, just all of a sudden mooning the retirement home and stuffing dead fish through people's mail slots just seems somehow childish.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you're doing.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell are you talkin' about? Ah, man, this is gonna be big.
LEADMALE:So what's it gonna be, like a prank on the whole lodge? Don't tell me.
SUPMALE:I want to be surprised.
OTHERMALE:Oh, please let me tell you, dan.
SUPMALE:All right, all right, tell me.
LEADMALE:No, don't tell me.
OTHERMALE:Okay, tell me.
LEADMALE:Okay, here's a hint.
LEADFEMALE:Um, it starts off with you being really disappointed.
SUPMALE:Oh, darn, i gave away the ending.
LEADMALE:Okay, i believe you.
SUPFEMALE:Give me another hint.
LEADMALE:How do i look? Well, it's nice to see you in a skirt for a change.
SUPMALE:All right, i'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, wait, your brother's in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:He needs a ride.
SUPFEMALE:Trick or treat.
LEADMALE:All right, all right.
SUPMALE:Man, you guys are real scary.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sure scared here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, happy halloween.
LEADFEMALE:Nice night.
LEADMALE:See ya.
LEADFEMALE:How come he can't just get there by himself? 'cause you're his big sister.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna drive him over there, you're gonna wheel him in, and then you're gonna lean him against a wall.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Then i'm out of there.
SUPMALE:How am i gonna get home? Your dad'll pick you up after the lodge party.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Let me here your line.
SUPFEMALE:I ate his liver with some fava beans and nice chianti.
OTHERMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:And remember, darlene, when you put him in the back seat, face up.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:What grade are you in? I am the ghost of halloween past.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, here's your snickers.
OTHERMALE:Do not toy with me, roseanne conner.
SUPMALE:How the hell did you get in here? Tonight, the ghosts of halloween past, present, and future will come to renew in you the joys of the halloween spirit.
SUPMALE:You must come with menow.
LEADMALE:Who's under that sheet? is that you fisher? do not look under the sheet! Well, you want me to go with you, right? how do i know that you really are some evil and terrifying spirit from beyond the grave and not just some ordinary creep, huh, casper? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Look under the sheet.
LEADMALE:I'll get my purse.
OTHERMALE:I want to know where you're taking me.
LEADMALE:You must travel back to where it all began.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Cool trick.
LEADFEMALE:You are now at the center of all time.
OTHERMALE:You must travel back well, i hope you have a tram or somethin'.
LEADMALE:As you shall see, the spirit of halloween was with you from birth.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, that's me in my little bassinette.
OTHERFEMALE:There's mom hovering over me.
LEADMALE:You know, until i was about 1, i thought she was just some huge, annoying mobile.
OTHERFEMALE:Lookit, i'm in my bunny suit.
LEADFEMALE:I hated that bunny suit.
LEADFEMALE:You love your little bunny suit, don't you? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Your first halloween.
LEADFEMALE:It's such a happy holiday, full of magic and make-believe.
SUPFEMALE:Man, she wasn't even cool for the '50s.
LEADMALE:Rosie? Sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, are you all right? Roseanne! Oh, my goodness.
SUPMALE:Al? She's not breathing.
LEADMALE:She's turning blue.
LEADFEMALE:Al, call the doctor! al! Though crude, this early prank laid the foundation for a brilliant career.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't eat that, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you're not the boss of me, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right.
OTHERFEMALE:Why shouldn't i eat it? Well, everybody knows they put poison and razor blades in those.
SUPFEMALE:Better give it to me.
OTHERFEMALE:That's stupid.
LEADFEMALE:That's not really true.
SUPFEMALE:See? It's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess you're right.
LEADMALE:Aah! ha ha ha ha ha! You know what the best part was? I used to sell that candy back to her later.
LEADFEMALE:And how could you forget, it was halloween that brought a kindred spirit into your life? Hey, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, cindy, how's it going? so what are you supposed to be? Oh, i'm ginger from gilligan's island, you know, if they never found the island.
SUPMALE:What are you? I'm a princess.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, a princess.
LEADFEMALE:I get it.
LEADFEMALE:This is my date, dan conner.
LEADMALE:How's it going? Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Ginger if they didn't find the island.
OTHERMALE:Great costume.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:So, roseanne, uh, why aren't you dancing tonight? Oh, i didn't feel like it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just running the apple bob.
OTHERMALE:Come on, cindy, give it a try.
LEADFEMALE:I'll let you go free.
OTHERMALE:Well, all right.
SUPMALE:Hold this.
LEADMALE:What do you give me to hold her there a couple minutes? what's so funny? hee hee hee hee! oh, my god! Gee, cindy, why so blue? do you really not want to dance? Depends.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, he never knew what hit him.
LEADMALE:And so, roseanne conner, we have seen the importance of the halloween spirit you have since abandoned, and now we must return.
LEADMALE:Well, wait, there's other stuff i want to see, like, uh, this one time, i took this coonskin cap, and i put it on my skateboard, and i'd push it out into traffic, and yell, "look out for my dog!" i'd love to see that twice.
SUPFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha! It was only a dream.
SUPFEMALE:I am the ghost of halloween present.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
SUPFEMALE:You're some great big piece of candy corn.
LEADFEMALE:Geez, i get this all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Look, i'm a symbol of halloween.
LEADMALE:Halloween, candy corn, end of story, let's go.
LEADMALE:Okay, but i hope nobody sees us together 'cause i'm supposed to be on slim fast.
LEADFEMALE:It was a graveyard smash he did the mash it caught on in a flash he did the mash we did the monster mash i'm sorry, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not going in the ladies' room.
SUPFEMALE:You're just gonna have to hold it.
SUPMALE:I got to go sometime, dan.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you should just try slowing down at the bar.
SUPMALE:Don't tell me what to do, dan, i'm doin' you a favor just wearing this thing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh yeah, like i'm sure the real marie antoinette drank so much beer.
LEADMALE:So this is it? you bring me to the lodge? isn't there anything about my life i could learnin hawaii? Just watch and learn.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm not gonna let you see fisher.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna get ticked off if he's talking to that indian girl.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, then angle me towards the punch.
LEADMALE:Well? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Hey, honey, havin' fun? Oh, i love being wedged under dan's armpit while you're hanging out with pocahontas over there.
LEADFEMALE:She just came up to say hello.
LEADFEMALE:What was i supposed to do, be rude? You know that this plays with a lot of trust issues that i have.
SUPFEMALE:This is about last night, isn't it? All i said was i love you.
LEADFEMALE:But it doesn't count if you say it during sex.
SUPMALE:What difference does it make when i say it? Because you're completely out of control.
LEADMALE:You'd say anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you want to know some of the other things that you said? hey, guys, can i say something? dan, do you mind? this is private! Who wants to shake my hand? Aw, come on, somebody wants to shake it.
OTHERMALE:Whoa! whoa! It's called a joy buzzer.
OTHERFEMALE:That was just me playing a prank.
SUPMALE:You know how roseanne's always playing halloween pranks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that was one of mine.
LEADFEMALE:That was a halloween prank.
OTHERMALE:Got it, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:She do the joy buzzer thing? Ah, i sure do miss roseanne.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:I thought she'd be here by now.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't feel like halloween without her.
SUPMALE:So is this the part where i'm supposed to get all weepy and say i wish i would've gone to the party? No.
LEADMALE:Don't you get it? You've ruined the holiday for all your friends.
LEADFEMALE:They need you.
LEADFEMALE:On the other hand, at least we don't have to eat those godawful pumpkin cookies she makes.
SUPMALE:Boy, she bakes once a year.
SUPMALE:You'd think it wouldn't taste like grout.
SUPMALE:Hey! And you know, some of those pranks of hers, they aren't even funny, they're just plain mean.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but you have to laugh like they're funny, or she throws a tantrum, acts like a baby.
LEADFEMALE:I do not! defend me, dan! Hey, live with the woman.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i'm telling you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what is this supposed to teach me? I'm sorry, you weren't supposed to hear that.
SUPMALE:Well, time's up, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You think i was so hard to live with before, buddy, just wait 'til you get home.
OTHERFEMALE:He can't hear you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh yeah? dan! Woo, anybody else get a chill? I am the ghost of halloween future.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Come with me.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are you taking me? You are there.
LEADFEMALE:You have already stepped into the future.
SUPFEMALE:Now you must see what will happen if you continue to deny the halloween spirit.
LEADMALE:Remember when this used to be the coolest house on halloween? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Before mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner went through the change.
LEADFEMALE:Happy halloween, boys.
SUPFEMALE:Trick or treat! Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Mini-tooth paste.
LEADFEMALE:And floss.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you boys remember that halloween is a holiday of fun and treats, not a celebration of satan.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, my game hens are ready.
LEADFEMALE:Man, what happened to me? Come.
LEADMALE:You must see it all.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember, darlene, there is nothing like a game hen for halloween to really please your man.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i'm chopping vegetables, mom, just like you taught me.
LEADMALE:Oh, my goodness, darlene! See? It's just a joke, mom.
OTHERMALE:Remember? jokes? Darlene, there are people on this earth who have chopped off their arms who would not find that at all amusing! Roseanne, i'm leaving you.
SUPMALE:But why? didn't i keep the house clean enough? wasn't i a good cook? It's not that.
LEADMALE:It's just thatyou bore me.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't leave me, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I try the best i can, but i'm only a woman.
LEADMALE:Aw, god, dan, leave her.
LEADFEMALE:Leave her.
OTHERMALE:But, dan, dan, do you have enough socks? Oh, my god, i've become what i hate most.
LEADMALE:Not yet.
SUPFEMALE:You must go farther into the future to see where this path will lead you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to.
LEADMALE:You grew to be an elderly divorced woman living with your spinster sister.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my god, i'm living with jackie? I don't want to see any more.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:We don't want to be late.
LEADMALE:All right, jackie, i'm all set.
LEADFEMALE:Why is my mother here? That's not your mother, roseanne.
LEADMALE:That's you.
OTHERFEMALE:Aah! thank god, there's still time! I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, too.
LEADMALE:Rosie, thank god! Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Yeah, hey, everybody.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha! Well, i just couldn't stay home one more second feelin' sorry for myself when i knew that all you guys were down here missing me so much, saying such really, really, nice things about me.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you know how much we love you, honey.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, crystal, i brought a whole trunkload of my pumpkin cookies for you.
SUPFEMALE:And i've got somethin' for you later, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm so glad you came, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Want to shake my hand? Oh, i'll do that later.
OTHERFEMALE:But first i want to show you all my torch.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody got a light? so, uh, this the whole thing? this is what we've been waitin' for? Oh, no, dan, no.
SUPFEMALE:This is what you've been waitin' for.
LEADFEMALE:Happy halloween! turn that light on, will you? aah! oh, my god! roseanne! help! oh, dan! oh, my god! oh, roseanne! oh, my god! handball? Clear! Stump the band?
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Ooh! Thank you, sir.
LEADMALE:May i have another? Hey, guys.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i think i found the perfect creamer for the restaurant.
LEADMALE:What do you think? I think in the wrong hands, petty cash can be a dangerous thing.
OTHERMALE:No one appreciates my pain.
OTHERMALE:Which is why you should not be alone all the time.
LEADMALE:No, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:What, you don't even know what i'm gonna say.
OTHERFEMALE:You're gonna fix me up with another one of dan's friends.
LEADFEMALE:That just shows you how wrong you are.
SUPMALE:I was gonna say something totally different.
LEADMALE:What? Well, now i forget.
SUPMALE:The only thing i can think about is this one friend of dan's that'd be really perfect for you.
LEADMALE:I'm not looking.
LEADFEMALE:Can we just drop it? Come on, nancy, just 'cause you haven't met anybody lately doesn't mean you should just give up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, besides, this friend of dan's, i think he is doing really, really well, okay? 'cause he just blew a ton of money on these hair plugs.
LEADMALE:Sounds like a dream, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Think i'll take a pass.
LEADMALE:No, you won't, because i told him you were gonna call him this morning, and i just know you guys are really-no.
LEADMALE:I'm already seeing someone.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank god, because this bald guy's a real loser.
OTHERMALE:So, come on, tell us about the guy.
OTHERFEMALE:What's his name? We're just gonna bug you 'til you do.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's too soon.
LEADMALE:It's too soon.
LEADMALE:Come on! tell us, tell us! You big baby.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Her name is marla.
LEADMALE:I'm seeing a woman.
LEADMALE:What? No, you aren't.
SUPFEMALE:I'm serious.
LEADMALE:I'm gay.
LEADMALE:Ah, you're just screwing with us, right? No.
OTHERFEMALE:So what do you think? Well, it's really surprising.
LEADMALE:I mean, when did this happen? Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You and i used to go out looking for guys all the time.
SUPMALE:We went to all those singles' dances together.
LEADFEMALE:Singles' dances? I thought we were dating.
LEADMALE:Joke.
LEADMALE:Joke.
LEADFEMALE:Just kidding.
LEADMALE:But--well, i don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you meet her? At the cosmetic counter at rodbell's.
LEADMALE:She does makeovers.
SUPMALE:Well, she's certainly thorough.
LEADFEMALE:So did you do it? Oh, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:You don't just ask that right away.
SUPMALE:For god's sakes.
OTHERMALE:Why didn't you tell us about it before? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I was scared, and i didn't know how you'd react.
LEADMALE:Well, we'd react the same way we react when you tell us anything personal-we make fun of you 'til it gets old, and then we move on.
LEADFEMALE:I can feel the love.
SUPMALE:It's just so strange.
SUPFEMALE:So weird, i mean so when did you start liking women? I mean, you were married to arnie.
SUPMALE:Arnie turned her gay.
LEADMALE:Well, sleeping with arnie would turn any woman gay.
OTHERMALE:Some women.
SUPMALE:Well, it's just like i see it on this oprah show, okay? Well, they had these women on there, and they says that you're born gay, you know, that it's like a chemical thing and everything.
LEADMALE:But then right after that, i see on donahue they had on these straight women who had tried that for a while, but they says it's just a phase.
SUPMALE:Well, i think i may have always been a lesbian.
SUPFEMALE:I was just in denial.
LEADFEMALE:I think maybe arnie was the phase.
LEADFEMALE:Think that's possible? Oh, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:"lesbians in denial.
LEADFEMALE:" sally jessy.
LEADMALE:Last thursday.
OTHERMALE:Oh, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't get it, roseanne.
LEADMALE:There had to have been some signs.
SUPMALE:Well, nancy always liked that miss hathaway on the beverly hillbillies.
OTHERMALE:I think that says it all.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Imagine what it would be like going through life without wanting or needing a man.
SUPMALE:What do you think it's like, anyway, two women living together? Oh, that's easy.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, it's my turn to be unselfish and giving! no! You got to be unselfish and giving yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:Today, you have to be supportive and nurturing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, this could be good.
LEADMALE:No espn.
LEADMALE:Twice the pms.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid i'm gonna feel weird around nancy now.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, what if she starts checking me out? Well, she probably already has.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you said you guys went to buy swimsuits together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, relax, jackie.
LEADMALE:She can control herself.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like she's a man.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just so weird.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, she's still your friend.
SUPFEMALE:She just happens to be gay.
OTHERFEMALE:What's for lunch? and who's gay? Loose meat, and none of your business.
LEADMALE:Oh, i probably already know anyway.
LEADFEMALE:It's dr.
SUPMALE:Summers, your gynecologist.
SUPFEMALE:My gynecologist is a lesbian? Hey, she's still your gynecologist.
LEADMALE:She just happens to be a lesbian.
SUPMALE:Chill.
OTHERFEMALE:I was just messing with your head.
LEADFEMALE:So who is it? No.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, come on.
OTHERMALE:She's gonna find out about it somehow.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't you rather it came from her mother with a little explanation? No, not really.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, i hate this.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, well, before i tell you, let me ask you a question.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, do you ever watch sally jessy? Mom, i pretty much already know about lesbians, and what i don't you'd be too embarrassed to tell me.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Well it's nancy.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:How'd you find out? did she tell you? No, we saw the "i'm a big old dyke" bumper sticker on her car.
OTHERFEMALE:I still don't see how we could have missed it, roseanne.
LEADMALE:How could we not have known that nancy is a lesbian? well, she doesn't look like a lesbian, you know? I mean, lesbians are big ol' truck drivers that wear flannel shirts and faded jeans.
LEADMALE:So what do you think, mom? I picked out the linoleum myself.
SUPFEMALE:Looks pretty great, huh? I'm a silent partner.
OTHERFEMALE:It shouldn't matter what i think.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, thanks, mom.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't be so sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:Now, i have some wonderful news.
SUPMALE:I found a place to live in lanford.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:It's nowhere near either of you.
LEADMALE:Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, we're so happy for you, then.
OTHERMALE:You might have heard of it.
SUPFEMALE:It's called harvest glen.
SUPMALE:Isn't that a retirement place? No, they call it a senior community.
LEADMALE:Well, you can't live there.
SUPMALE:That's for old people.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, roseanne.
LEADMALE:It's mom's decision.
LEADMALE:I think we should support her in it.
LEADMALE:Mom, you have my support.
LEADMALE:Thank you, jackie.
SUPMALE:Jackie, they tie old people into chairs at places like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Please don't screw this up.
LEADMALE:Harvest glen is nothing like that.
LEADMALE:It's not a nursing home.
OTHERMALE:Lots of people my age live there, and they have all kinds of activities-workshops, golfing, day trips.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds great.
OTHERFEMALE:And i assume that there's some sort of curfew.
LEADMALE:Nobody off the grounds after, what, 5, 6? They're having an open-house tomorrow, and i'd like both of you to come along and see how nice it is.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but if i see one old person tied to anything, i'm leaving.
OTHERMALE:Bonjour.
SUPMALE:Marla, roseanne, jackie, their mom bev.
SUPMALE:This is marla.
SUPFEMALE:I just brought her in to show her my new enterprise.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:I know you.
LEADMALE:Didn't you sell me moisturizer the other day at rodbell's? You know, i think you're right.
SUPFEMALE:That's exactly how we met.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but nancy got the free gift.
LEADMALE:There was a free gift? You don't want that gift, mom.
LEADFEMALE:It was only available to certain customers.
SUPFEMALE:And this customer's satisfied.
SUPFEMALE:Can we--can-you want to check out the bathroom, mom? I'm sure you're gonna hate the wallpaper we put up in there.
SUPFEMALE:You finished the bathroom? I wanna go see it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You know, nancy is so lucky to have friends that are so supportive.
SUPMALE:Oh, nancy is so great.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she is great.
OTHERFEMALE:She's great, and she's, uh, very--really funny.
LEADMALE:Hey, listen, you guys don't have to sell me on nancy.
LEADMALE:I mean, we hit it off right away.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we're just glad she's happy.
SUPMALE:Not that she was unhappy.
LEADMALE:Or desperate.
SUPFEMALE:She's, er really very popular.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, popular.
LEADMALE:She could have her pick of-well, as it turns out, anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Do all the units have the same carpeting? We just put it in.
LEADMALE:We picked a nice neutral tone.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you like it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, it's just fine.
LEADFEMALE:I have lots of throw rugs.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go check the laundry room.
LEADFEMALE:Lint traps tell you a lot about your neighbors.
LEADMALE:So what do you think? I love the place.
SUPMALE:Isn't it great, roseanne? how soon can we drop her off? what's this for? Oh, well, it's a medical alert button.
SUPFEMALE:There's one in every room.
LEADFEMALE:If there's an emergency, all you have to do is press it, and an ambulance will be here immediately.
LEADFEMALE:Immediately, huh? Roseanne, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and here is something else that's kind of neat.
LEADMALE:This is a motorized lift chair for our tenants who have a little trouble getting up out of the seated position.
LEADMALE:That's not too depressing.
LEADMALE:Hey, you get your own chair.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, you big baby! You know, before bev gets back, we want you to know that this is more than just a place for her to reside.
OTHERFEMALE:We want to do everything we can to take the burden off you and your sister.
LEADMALE:You must have an awfully large staff.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:What i mean is, you see, the price of the condo includes long-term medical attention.
LEADMALE:You know, when it becomes necessary, your mother will be automatically relocated into a bed in our constant care wing.
LEADMALE:What happens to her apartment? Oh, well, it'll go back to a pool to be resold to new residents.
SUPMALE:Well, what if she gets better? Now, this is a long way off.
OTHERMALE:Obviously, your mom is in great shape.
SUPFEMALE:No, but, i mean, i want to know what happens if she gets better.
LEADFEMALE:They're not young people, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Wonderful laundry facility, although it is a bit of a meet market.
LEADMALE:Mom, you better think about this a little bit.
LEADMALE:Nonsense, i think i'm ready to sign right now.
SUPMALE:No, you're not, mom.
LEADMALE:You need to think about it a little bit more.
SUPFEMALE:Mom knows what she wants, roseanne.
LEADMALE:She does not.
LEADMALE:Yes, i do.
OTHERMALE:I hope you're not calling mom stupid, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Well, what else do you call paying for a condo that they take back, and medical care that you might never use? Mom could get run over by a bus tomorrow, and they hit the jackpot! Don't say that, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Mom could lapse into a coma, live 40 years as a vegetable, and she cleans up.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think this is up to either of you.
SUPMALE:It's my money and my life.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, well, if you want to go throwing them both away, i mean, if you're feeble-minded enough to want to take this deal, then maybe you should be in a home.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if you're narrow-minded enough to try to stop me, maybe you ought to go home and not come back.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Well, listen to that.
OTHERFEMALE:It sounds like another condo's ready to open up.
OTHERFEMALE:The place is perfect, roseanne.
SUPMALE:You know how hard it is for mom to make friends? There are hundreds of people there.
LEADFEMALE:It would take her years to alienate them all.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you just want her out of your face.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course i do, but i still think it would be good for mom.
OTHERMALE:Why are you fighting her moving so hard? well, how come you ain't fighting it at all? Because i think it's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't you get it, jackie? That would be the last place mom would ever live.
LEADFEMALE:That's the place we have to go get her stuff after she dies.
SUPMALE:Why worry about it now? It's so far in the future.
SUPMALE:We don't know that.
OTHERFEMALE:Gosh, she's 63.
LEADMALE:She can only get insurance from art linklater.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you so freaked out about this? Because it's just really weird to be planning mom's death.
LEADMALE:We have been planning her death for years.
OTHERFEMALE:Plotting, not planning.
SUPMALE:All right, fine.
OTHERMALE:So it's up in our face now.
LEADFEMALE:You knew we'd have to deal with it sooner or later.
SUPFEMALE:I know, but i just thought it would be later-you know, way later, like when we're more mature.
LEADFEMALE:We are mature kinda.
LEADMALE:How old do you feel? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Most of the time thirty well, i feel like i'm 16 with an 18-year-old married daughter, two mortgages, and a mother going into a retirement home.
SUPMALE:I wish i was old enough to drink.
LEADMALE:It's not that bad, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I'm 40, jackie.
SUPMALE:This is all just going way too fast.
SUPMALE:How long 'til i'm shuffling towards that medical alert button? I'm not gonna listen to this.
OTHERFEMALE:You're still young.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, darlene? do you think of me as young? Well, that depends.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, if you mean young as in vibrant and full of life, well, i guess i do.
LEADMALE:On the other hand, if you mean young as in open-minded, and willing to accept new ideas, then i guess you qualify in that area also.
LEADMALE:Best of all, i think of you as a friend and contemporary.
SUPMALE:I must be getting old.
OTHERMALE:I walked right into that one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i guess that's it, uh, mom, unless you want me to stick around and help unpack this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, you went forks, knives, serving spoons, spoons.
LEADFEMALE:Different! I'm not afraid of change.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what are you doing here? Well, i just thought i'd stop by and bring mom a gift.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Make me look bad.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to wal-mart.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Well, here.
LEADFEMALE:I brought this for you.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I better put it somewhere where it won't drip.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm surprised to see you, considering how you feel.
SUPMALE:Well, it's not like i can stop you or nothing.
LEADMALE:But you know, you can still get out of this whole deal.
SUPFEMALE:You know, if you want, we can just go to 'em and tell 'em that you're senile or something.
LEADMALE:That's sweet, dear, but i don't think senility would get you out of an old folks home.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i just never want to come in here and find you acting like an old person.
LEADMALE:You don't have to worry about that.
LEADMALE:I don't feel like an old person.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so, how old do you feel? No, i know that.
SUPMALE:But i mean, like, on the inside, you know, how old do you feel? I'm 63.
LEADMALE:I feel like a 63-year-old woman.
LEADFEMALE:How nice having this talk with you, mom.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to say, roseanne? Well, i want you to say that you feel, like, you know, 16 or 24 or 35.
LEADMALE:Anything but 63.
LEADMALE:But what's wrong with 63? Well, it's old! I don't want you to get old.
LEADFEMALE:I know, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Because you're just dragging me with you, and i don't like it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, dear, i don't get older just to inconvenience you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm old.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're not old, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i feel old.
LEADMALE:Listen, why can't you just forget about all this, you know, and just go get a regular apartment? And then later on, if you need to, well, then, you can just move in with dan and me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, me.
OTHERMALE:I appreciate the offer, dear, and i did consider it.
LEADFEMALE:I just think strangers would take better care of me.
LEADMALE:I think it'll look great over the register.
LEADFEMALE:How come my head's so damn big? It's a caricature, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Your head is supposed to be big.
SUPMALE:Well, nobody else's head is that big.
SUPFEMALE:How come i got a great big old melon head? I mean, in real life, nancy's head's way bigger than mine.
OTHERMALE:Hello, everyone.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I just thought this would look better here in the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:Now, i can't stay long.
OTHERFEMALE:The harvest glen players are doing you're a good man, charlie brown, and i'm up for the role of lucy.
LEADMALE:I bet you'll get it, 'cause they probably have, what, six understudies for every part, you know, in case snoopy breaks his hip.
SUPMALE:We'll keep our fingers crossed, bev.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck.
LEADMALE:Bon soir, ladies.
SUPMALE:Ciao.
SUPFEMALE:That nancy's a lovely girl, but if she doesn't stop spending all her time with marla, she's never gonna find a man.
LEADMALE:Mom-roseanne, ixnay on the esbianlay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, she's gonna find out sooner or later.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, i'm just gonna come out and tell you this.
OTHERMALE:All right? Okay.
SUPMALE:Marla and nancy are lesbians.
LEADMALE:Of course they are.
SUPFEMALE:Any fool could see that.
LEADMALE:So now i guess i'm supposed to walk up and say, "oh, hello, you nice lesbians" or something equally embarrassing, and then everyone gets a good laugh at the expense of the stupid old lady.
LEADMALE:Sure, they're lesbians.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a lesbian.
LEADMALE:You're a lesbian.
LEADMALE:We're all lesbians.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not falling for it, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not that old.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Come on, d.j. it's not every day your mother opens a restaurant.
LEADMALE:And you've got a really important job to do.
LEADMALE:Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:It's veal boy.
LEADMALE:I hate this.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna pass out any stupid fliers.
LEADFEMALE:She's just jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you go out there and do us proud.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, this was your mother's idea.
LEADMALE:D.j. , d.j. say "moo" for the camera.
LEADMALE:Moo.
OTHERMALE:When he runs away, his picture on the milk carton's gonna be very confusing.
OTHERMALE:He's not gonna run away.
LEADMALE:He's much more likely to get beat up.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right back.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, what did you do with the napkins? what napkins? god, you did order napkins, didn't ya? No, 'cause i didn't know the exact right amount of napkins to order.
SUPMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Now we have the exact right amount of napkins for zero sandwiches.
SUPMALE:Anything would be better than that.
LEADMALE:Hey, i have some kleenex in my purse.
LEADMALE:Here, darlene.
LEADMALE:Go get some napkins.
SUPFEMALE:I can't get napkins with 50 cents.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you can.
LEADMALE:You go down there to that chicken place and buy a soda and then steal all theirs.
LEADMALE:Anything else you'd like? spoons, forks, a chair? so, are we ready for the big grand opening? Yeah! Okay.
OTHERMALE:Let's do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Da! da-da-da-da! da-da-da-da! yeah! all right! So, jackie, i hope you remembered to buy the frame for our first dollar bill.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, it's right there under the counter.
OTHERFEMALE:Was that such a good idea? i mean, shouldn't we re-invest it back into the business? Here it comes! here it comes! This is our first dollar.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Well, can we help you? Sure, i'd like a-wait, wait! Let me get in position.
OTHERMALE:Okay, go.
OTHERMALE:I'd like a cup of coffee.
LEADMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:And? And, uh, cream.
SUPFEMALE:And? Andthank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:It's only that's gonna look lousy in a frame.
OTHERFEMALE:So, how about one of our nice loose meat sandwiches to go with the coffee? No, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like a piece of pie? No.
LEADMALE:A cookie? No.
SUPMALE:Some gum? Okay, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:We'll get it from the next customer.
OTHERMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:It's first customer, first dollar.
OTHERMALE:That's the way it goes.
SUPFEMALE:Let it go, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Okay, that'll be 65 cents.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, do you have a restroom? It's around the back.
OTHERMALE:That'll be well, don't get used to my being home, dan, because i got stuck with the night shift again.
OTHERFEMALE:First mom calls in sick, then fisher calls over there to say he's sick, then jackie starts whining about her little snuffle bear and that made me sick, so i told her to go home.
OTHERFEMALE:So i get an hour off so i can come over here and make dinner for my family.
OTHERMALE:Now what am i supposed to do with the other 56 minutes? dan! Say, dan, are you even listening to me? arnie, what the hell are you doing here? Dan, get out here and help me.
LEADFEMALE:Dan! Oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:Calm down, honey! Why would you even let him into my house after the way he dumped nancy? I couldn't help it.
LEADMALE:He was whimpering and scratching at the back door.
LEADMALE:Rosie, this is the last house i went to.
LEADMALE:I went everywhere else i knew.
OTHERMALE:The lights were on, cars were in the driveway, but nobody was home.
SUPFEMALE:It was really weird.
LEADFEMALE:I was outside.
OTHERMALE:How could you tell nancy that you were abducted by space aliens! there's not even a 12-step program for that! call her off, dan! call her off! You gotta appreciate my situation here, arn.
OTHERMALE:She's my wife.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta let her hurt ya.
LEADMALE:I hear ya, buddy.
LEADMALE:All right, i was a weasel to snake out on nancy like that, but that marriage thing was harder than i thought, you know? One morning i woke up and i couldn't breathe.
SUPMALE:There was this heavy weight on my chest.
LEADFEMALE:It was nancy.
SUPFEMALE:She was trying to kill me.
SUPMALE:So i got the hell out of there.
LEADFEMALE:But listen, i'm back and i want to patch things up.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, nancy happens to be really happy right now, so i don't want you to go screwing with her life.
LEADMALE:She's not with another guy, is she? Well, no.
OTHERMALE:That's great, 'cause then i'm back in the saddle! Listen, dan, i'm gonna go over there.
LEADMALE:Do me a favor, smell me.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't just go over there, arnie.
OTHERMALE:A lot of things have changed in this town since you were here last.
OTHERFEMALE:Like what? Like nancy's a lesbian and we got a new lenscrafters.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come again? Yes, dan.
LEADMALE:Glasses in less than an hour.
SUPMALE:Nancy's gay? our nancy? arnie's nancy? Yes, and now marla's nancy.
LEADMALE:Nancy's dating marla? Yowza! hey! I'll bet that marla's a lesbian, too.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I'll see your two and bump you two more.
LEADMALE:Call.
SUPFEMALE:I got a straight.
LEADMALE:Straight, huh? a straight? is that a crack about my ex-wife? Whoa there, big guy.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't mean anything by it.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Beats me.
LEADFEMALE:I just got a pair of ladies.
LEADFEMALE:That's it! come on! Now, relax, arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody's judging you because your ex-wife's dating a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, arnie.
SUPFEMALE:It could have happened to anybody.
LEADMALE:Well, most people.
OTHERMALE:Oh, maybe just you.
LEADFEMALE:Whose deal? All right.
SUPMALE:Mine.
LEADMALE:Well then, tell me something, guys.
LEADMALE:You got your lesbians, right? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:How in the hell can a woman be satisfied by someone that does not have the right equipment? You can buy the equipment.
SUPMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get that, but i'm telling you guys, she had no complaints.
LEADFEMALE:I've had a lot of women fake it on me, and i can always tell.
OTHERMALE:Maybe that's it, arn.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you're just so darn good in the sack that you ruined her for other guys.
LEADFEMALE:Nah.
SUPFEMALE:Look, arnie, you can't blame yourself.
LEADMALE:She's probably always liked women.
OTHERFEMALE:So what are you saying, ty? you saying i'm like a woman? that i'm womanly? is that what you're saying? Oh, it's it's pretty ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Right, guys? are you in, betty? Yeah, and i'll raise you two.
LEADFEMALE:Make all the jokes you want, guys.
LEADFEMALE:I loved her, and it still hurts.
OTHERFEMALE:We'd still be together if i hadn't dumped her.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, arn.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, arnie, we're all really sorry, and we all think you're really manly, don't we, guys? Aye, a manly man.
LEADFEMALE:Arrgghh! Absolutely.
SUPMALE:And, uh i'll see you two, and i'll bump you two more.
LEADMALE:That's too rich for my blood.
SUPMALE:I fold.
OTHERFEMALE:A real man wouldn't fold.
SUPFEMALE:All right, i call.
LEADFEMALE:What do you got? An eight.
SUPMALE:Thank you, and be sure to tell all your friends.
SUPMALE:Hey, i don't mean to bug you or anything, but it's getting to be, like, 9:00, and i need to close up now.
OTHERMALE:Can i have some more coffee? Well, like, all that's left is just sediment in the pot.
LEADFEMALE:But hey, how about five or six packets of sugar to help you with your next drum solo? I said can i have some more coffee! Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Calm down.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get you some coffee.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not doing anything, okay? You don't have to call anybody.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't gonna call anybody.
LEADMALE:I'm just getting your coffee.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, here.
LEADMALE:I put it in a "to go" cup, you know, 'cause i'm sure you want to, you know, go.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you call me the minute this guy sat down? 'cause he didn't do anything when he first sat down.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna drive around and look for this guy.
SUPMALE:What did he look like? he just looked like a regular lunatic, you know? could you be more specific? Yeah, okay, he looks like the kind of guy that darlene's gonna bring home and we're gonna have to call "son.
LEADFEMALE:" you're not helping, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I gotta do something here, and i think it requires physical violence.
LEADFEMALE:Would you just calm down, dan? Just give me a minute to get myself together here.
SUPMALE:Please get me a beer.
LEADMALE:And when i'm done, i'll let you crush the can.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you got women there alone.
LEADFEMALE:I'd feel a hell of a lot better if you started closing before dark.
SUPMALE:No, we'll just make sure there's always at least two of us on each shift, okay? It'll probably never happen again.
LEADMALE:You don't know that.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you consider getting a gun for the diner? Oh, there's a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:A loaded gun in the same room with my mother and my sister.
LEADFEMALE:What if they miss each other and they kill a customer? Then they'll have to reload.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:This is important.
LEADMALE:We'll teach you how to use it.
LEADMALE:No, forget about it.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:This is serious, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You gotta do something about this.
OTHERFEMALE:You gotta do it now.
LEADMALE:What'd i do? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Really? Your mother had a run-in with some creep at the diner tonight, and she won't listen to reason.
LEADFEMALE:Are you okay? Yeah.
LEADMALE:He didn't rob us or nothing.
LEADMALE:He just kept wanting me to give him more coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Mom that's a customer.
SUPFEMALE:So arnie came by my apartment last night.
SUPFEMALE:He thinks he can win me back, like i'm some big lesbian trophy.
SUPMALE:I'd still like to know who told him i was gay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i think jackie told him.
SUPMALE:The guy is unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:He even brings me some trashy lingerie.
SUPFEMALE:Man, tacky underwear.
LEADFEMALE:That's so arnie.
OTHERFEMALE:Ugh! He is such a pig.
OTHERFEMALE:But it looks great on marla.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like a table with a view of the cute waitress, please.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! Stupe.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here? Hey! I got shoes.
LEADFEMALE:I got shirt.
SUPFEMALE:I want service.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have the usual.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm busy.
LEADFEMALE:Would you rather have a sandwich? I think i'll start with drinks.
OTHERFEMALE:Perhaps a large orange, no ice.
SUPFEMALE:And maybe some appetizers.
OTHERFEMALE:Are your chips good tonight? how long do you plan to be here on psycho patrol, dan? Till closing.
LEADMALE:That is just not possible, dan.
LEADMALE:Because if you sit here and watch me serving people food and cleaning up, then that will take all the romance out of it when i do it at home.
LEADMALE:If you're not gonna do anything about this, i'm gonna stay here and make sure you're safe.
LEADFEMALE:It's my job.
LEADMALE:It's what you pay me for.
OTHERMALE:I'm handling it, okay? see? See that sticker over there on the door? "this premises protected by the lantron security alarm systems.
OTHERMALE:" where'd you get that? I stoled it.
SUPMALE:I feel safer already.
LEADMALE:You gotta go, dan, or i'm gonna have to come over there and throw you out.
LEADMALE:You're gonna throw me out? Come on, dan.
LEADMALE:I don't have time for your macho robert de niro crap.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now.
SUPFEMALE:You couldn't throw somebody out if you had to, woman.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're so mature.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie! nancy! This creep giving you trouble, roseanne? Yes.
SUPMALE:He keeps insisting he's my husband and he won't leave.
SUPMALE:Jackie, you get his legs.
LEADFEMALE:Here, you got his arms.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the rest.
OTHERMALE:Uhh! uhh! All right.
LEADMALE:I got it.
SUPFEMALE:Aah! aah! oh! oh! Dammit, roseanne.
SUPMALE:You're not gonna know some maniac's special tickle spot.
LEADMALE:Obviously, i do.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You don't want me here? I'm gone.
LEADMALE:But you can't get rid of me that easy.
SUPMALE:I'll be sitting out front in my car.
LEADMALE:Man, is he stubborn.
SUPFEMALE:I think i pulled something.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you know, he just means well.
LEADFEMALE:He's worried about us, wants to make sure we're all, you know, safe.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Oh, i'm just gonna get his car towed.
LEADMALE:Aargh! hyah! hyah! aaahhh-hyah! It's not that hard, roseanne.
SUPMALE:I took this self-defense class when i was on the force.
LEADFEMALE:It's great.
OTHERFEMALE:Hyah! Yeah, i'm sure it will come in handy if i'm ever attacked by a crazed piece of plywood.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know they turned this into a karate place.
OTHERMALE:Last time i was here it was 'taters, 'taters, 'taters.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:We're trying to put on a demonstration here.
LEADMALE:Aaaahhh! hyah! God, buy a saw.
LEADMALE:With a mouth like that, you need self-defense.
SUPMALE:Ordinarily, i'd get mad at that, but i'd hate for the last thing i ever see to be his forehead coming at me.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about him, roseanne.
LEADMALE:That's not what we're gonna be studying.
SUPMALE:This is what we're gonna be studying.
LEADMALE:No! no! no! Wow.
SUPMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Now remember, we'll be simulating real attacks here.
OTHERFEMALE:So i want you to fight back as hard as you can.
LEADMALE:Any questions? yes? rosie? When are you gonna bring out that guy in the suit? 'cause i'd like to kick that guy in the suit.
LEADMALE:We'll get there very soon.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, passivity is your worst enemy.
SUPMALE:So the first thing we learn to do here is to say no to men.
LEADFEMALE:You sure you took this class? This "no" gets you in touch with your power.
OTHERMALE:So what's the first thing you say to a man who wants to hurt you? No! Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Very good.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to introduce our attacker for this evening.
LEADFEMALE:His name is fred.
LEADMALE:Yay! no, boo! boo! The first thing we're gonna do is frontal attacks.
OTHERMALE:Any volunteers? rosie? Okay.
SUPMALE:Save some for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna show you a simple way to take down a 220-pound assailant, all right? First thing i want you to do is clump your fingers together like this.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah, i get it.
SUPFEMALE:And then when he tries to guess what animal i'm making, i knee him in the crotch.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're gonna use your fingers to strike your assailant in the eye.
SUPFEMALE:No! Yeah, that's pretty cool.
SUPMALE:Hey, could you do that to a guy that's still asleep, or would that be unfair? Then after the eye strike, that's when i want you to knee him in the groin.
SUPMALE:No! Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:He's well protected.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the last step is a knockout blow.
LEADMALE:When fred takes you to the ground, i want you to kick him in the head until he puts his hands in front of his face and i blow the whistle.
LEADFEMALE:That means stop.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You ready? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Now, a lot of women find this very traumatic.
LEADFEMALE:Your first instinct may be to panic, stop breathing, even run.
LEADFEMALE:So you just do the best you can.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right? All right.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie is ready.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you! hey! ow! hit him! hit him! kick him hard! kick him! Hey, that's fun.
LEADMALE:Do you have a home version of that game? All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's talk about our attacker's vulnerable spots.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, nancy! oh, god! Don't mean to bother you women, but i need to speak to that chick right over there real quick.
SUPFEMALE:You want me to go kick him in the head for ya? Ugh! It won't make any difference.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Arnie, what the hell are you doing here? why won't you talk to me, nance? I'm gonna tell you one more time.
OTHERMALE:I'm gay.
LEADMALE:It has nothing to do with you or your masculinity.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it doesn't.
LEADMALE:I'm still every bit the man i always was.
LEADMALE:Last night, i beat up three guys in a topless bar to prove it.
LEADMALE:I mean, you just don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:It's about love, trust, and commitment.
SUPFEMALE:What we had was not natural.
LEADMALE:I can accept that, and i know that we won't get back together.
LEADMALE:But that doesn't mean you and me can't, you know, do it one more time, you know? Swine.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:If it's about that marla broad, you can bring her along.
LEADMALE:Arnie! okay, okay! can i at least watch or something? You know, i wanna be in there somewhere! no! Come on out here, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you to see i can take care of myself.
SUPFEMALE:Now get your butt out here.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, do you have on all your equipment? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Like i'm gonna need it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, now go over there, and then when i tell you to, you're gonna come at me.
LEADFEMALE:But i want you to really, really come at me.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I was all-district offensive lineman three years in a row.
LEADMALE:Are you gonna bore me into unconsciousness or are you gonna put on that hat? Oh, hurt me.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, dan.
OTHERMALE:I'm ready for ya.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:What is that, a chicken? Ow! my eye! my eye! ow! We're losing patience with you, human.
LEADFEMALE:You were supposed to bring back the female specimen for breeding stock.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, she's not into that anymore.
LEADMALE:Now we will have to cross-breed him with one of the other species.
OTHERFEMALE:How about the cactipoony? Cactipoony.
LEADMALE:That sounds good.
LEADMALE:I like a little variety.
LEADFEMALE:Good idea.
LEADMALE:We'll have the female defanged immediately.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:I got even a better idea.
SUPMALE:Why don't you give me a new mission? why don't i go down there and mutilate some cows? Don't worry, human.
SUPMALE:We have vastly improved our cross-breeding system since the last time we tried to pollinate you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i hope so.
LEADMALE:You gotta be a little more careful when you're pickin' my dates.
SUPMALE:The last one, i had to put bags on two of her heads.
LEADMALE:Michael, michael, what are you doin'? I wasn't in enough scenes.
LEADMALE:You aren't in this scene either.
LEADMALE:Look, it's arnie and the aliens.
SUPMALE:I want to be an alien.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, guys, beat it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, geez.
LEADFEMALE:Six hours of makeup for this? You know, you do look kinda like a little spock.
LEADMALE:Don't ya? You know spock's-do that.
LEADMALE:Look like a little spock, don't ya? hear about my new show? Um, a little bit.
SUPFEMALE:What'd you hear? good things? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Like what? 
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:How come darlene gets three good-bye dinners? You'll get yours next month when they take you away.
LEADMALE:Well, i just figure i better feed her good before she gets up to college and won't be eating nothing but junk.
OTHERMALE:Mom, you didn't finish the chilli fries.
LEADMALE:Oh, put 'em in the fridge.
SUPFEMALE:We'll have 'em in the morning.
SUPMALE:There's cake in the fridge.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, make mom give us cake.
SUPFEMALE:Woman, my son here wants cake.
SUPMALE:So does your man.
SUPFEMALE:I better see me some cake fetching going on here right now.
SUPFEMALE:I mean it.
SUPFEMALE:Don't make me come over there! Son, i just lost control of the house.
LEADFEMALE:It's every man for himself.
LEADFEMALE:I--i got to hand it to you, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You're handling darlene leaving pretty well.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, it's been kind of a real special week, you know.
LEADMALE:Kind of cool.
LEADFEMALE:And, oh, i've got such a great thing planned for the drive up there on saturday.
SUPMALE:We're gonna pull over, you know, and have a picnic, and then we're gonna get tattooed.
LEADFEMALE:Ohshe's wanted one for months.
OTHERMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:We're gonna get matching mother and daughter tattoos.
SUPFEMALE:She's gonna get one that says, "i love mom," and i'm getting a skull with a great big snake coming out of it.
LEADFEMALE:Think i'm gonna cry.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but i'm kind of worried about how it's gonna affect dan, her leaving, you know.
LEADMALE:You know how bad he freaked out when becky left.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that was bad.
LEADMALE:Him and darlene, they have that kind of a special buddy thing going, you know.
SUPFEMALE:She's kind of like his cool son.
LEADMALE:Uh, mom, can i talk to you a minute? I need to ask you a really big favor.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's see, i let you go to art school, and i let your boyfriend move in.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, and i gave you life.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i guess i owe you one.
SUPMALE:I'll just be out in the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:Unless you want me to stay.
SUPMALE:Well, you know where i'll be.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, i was just wondering, can david take me up to school instead of you and dad? Uh, well, darlene, of course not.
OTHERMALE:Well, i was just thinking that if he took me then he'd feel like he was still a part of my life.
LEADFEMALE:And being as your such a majorly cool mom, a mom like no mom, head mom, my main mom well, you know, this is very important to your father, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:I think you should ask him.
SUPFEMALE:Ask me what? Dad, i was just wondering if it would be okay if david took me up to school on saturday instead of you guys.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:What's your mom say? well, i'm okay with it, but, you know, how do you feel about it, dan? Sure, what the hell.
SUPMALE:Who wants cake? Thanks, dad.
SUPFEMALE:You're the best.
OTHERMALE:Sorry about those teen years.
LEADFEMALE:Um, danare you really sure, you know? I know you were pretty psyched about this.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see her next week.
LEADFEMALE:But you had like the whole day planned.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get drunk and watch the bears game instead.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm flexible.
LEADFEMALE:God, i hate it when you do this, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Your daughter comes in here, she walks all over your feelings, and then you pretend it doesn't bother you.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone can see how upset you are.
LEADFEMALE:And here you are just hiding all your feelings in the stupid cake.
LEADFEMALE:Now you've ruined dessert! I didn't think i'd take it that hard.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How am i feeling today? Aw, it sucks, dan.
LEADFEMALE:How come she won't let me drive her to school? She's almost 17.
SUPMALE:Of course she'd rather go with her boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:She's not even upset about leaving me.
SUPMALE:Look, if you're this upset about it, tell her you thought you were cool with it but now you're not.
LEADMALE:I can't do that, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I can't become queen geek now.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then you'll have to accept it.
LEADMALE:But you could become queen geek though.
SUPMALE:I don't want to be queen geek.
SUPFEMALE:I can't go tell her i have a problem with david taking her, but you could.
LEADMALE:You already told her david could take her.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know, but so what? You could forbid me to do that.
LEADMALE:In what universe? Please, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Forbid me.
LEADMALE:I thought you were supposed to be the man of this house.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you did not.
LEADMALE:Mom, i'm home from soccer practice.
SUPFEMALE:Do you smell? Yes.
LEADMALE:Then take a bath! All right.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, they're all just gonna desert us anyway, dan.
LEADMALE:You know where we went wrong? We named 'em.
LEADFEMALE:That's when you get all attached.
SUPMALE:I know, honey.
SUPFEMALE:It's hard for me, too, but kids grow up and leave.
OTHERMALE:That's what they do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm stuck! Here, i'll help you, son.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, wait.
SUPMALE:What's this? Well, i thought maybe you could take me up to school on saturday, and that way you could keep my car while i'm gone and come visit me whenever you wanted.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, sit down.
SUPMALE:What is it? I was thinking.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should get engaged.
LEADFEMALE:Engaged? Yeah.
LEADMALE:David, are you asking me to marry you? All right.
SUPFEMALE:David, this is sostupid.
OTHERMALE:I just thought that if we got engaged things might be better.
SUPMALE:Your mother might even let us stay in the same room.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna change my mind.
LEADMALE:I'm still leaving for school on saturday.
OTHERMALE:Well, then, i'm not taking you.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Because i've got a date.
LEADFEMALE:You've got a date? A minute ago we were engaged.
SUPMALE:Okay, i don't have a date.
LEADFEMALE:I just want you to know that if you go away to school then i'm gonna be seeing other people.
LEADMALE:You're breaking up with me? Now, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:You're the one who's leaving me, so you're the one who's breaking us up.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, go to hell.
SUPFEMALE:No, you go to hell.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't want you to take me anyway.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't sit in the same car with you for two hours.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:God, i hate you! I really think she needs to be alone now.
OTHERMALE:I really think she needs a ride on saturday.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but no gloating.
LEADMALE:Oh, darlene, i just heard what happened.
LEADMALE:You know, i'm going through this huge thing and all he's thinking about is what he wants.
LEADMALE:Well, that's men for you, but listen.
SUPFEMALE:We'll talk this all out on our drive up there on saturday.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not waiting 'til saturday.
LEADMALE:I'm leaving tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I want to get as far from this place as possible.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah, well, so do i, but i can't get any time off work till saturday, and, you know, i kind of want to take you up there.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't care what you want.
SUPMALE:I never wanted you to take me in the first place.
LEADMALE:I just want to get away from david.
LEADMALE:I want to get away from you.
LEADFEMALE:I hate this whole damn house.
LEADMALE:Just leave me alone, okay? I got to get something out of the car.
LEADFEMALE:Honey what do you want? what do you think i want? I want you to go out there and apologize.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to tell your mother that you want her to take you to school saturday.
LEADFEMALE:No! No? why the hell not? She's gonna go psychotic when she gets up there and she sees that i have my own life now.
LEADFEMALE:She's gonna rag on everything.
OTHERFEMALE:My school, my apartment, my roommate yes, yes, she absolutely will.
SUPMALE:And every time she slams you, you'll know she's suffering.
LEADFEMALE:And the only way your mother can deal with pain is to spread it around.
LEADMALE:Why can't she just take it out on someone else? Don't worry, she will.
SUPMALE:She's gonna ruin this for me.
LEADMALE:I'm the one that's going to school.
LEADMALE:This is supposed to be my big day, not hers.
LEADMALE:Darlene, darlene, darlene.
OTHERMALE:Where did you get a stupid idea like that? Look, honey don't go to your mom just 'cause i told you to.
LEADMALE:Go to her because she's your mother and because she's hurting.
LEADFEMALE:Because she's got too much pride to show you her feelings.
LEADMALE:Well, that's it! We're gonna take you up there on saturday and i don't give a flying crap if you like it or not.
LEADFEMALE:Or let her come to you.
SUPMALE:Weather-strip the windows, spackle the ceiling, fix the bathroom door lock.
LEADMALE:Name the rats.
LEADMALE:Hang in there, champ.
OTHERMALE:You know, you usually have to go to a movie theater to find floors with this kind of texture.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, would you come over here and help me with this thing far away from your mother? so what did darlene say about me on the ride up here? She said nothing.
LEADMALE:She did too, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:When me and dan passed you on that interstate, i saw her with her face all scrunched up.
SUPFEMALE:She was doing me.
LEADMALE:She was not.
SUPFEMALE:She swallowed a bug.
LEADMALE:Socks go in the top drawer! Why? Because they just do.
SUPMALE:Says who? God! I need some help getting the rest of the stuff out of the car.
SUPFEMALE:Any volunteers, darlene? Ooh, dad, how subtle.
SUPFEMALE:Your hair is going out the door.
LEADMALE:You might want to follow.
OTHERFEMALE:This is your last day together.
SUPFEMALE:You want to leave her like this? Jackie, everyone on earth knows the sock rule! You are taking your daughter to college, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You got what you wanted.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but only because i made her.
SUPMALE:She can't wait for me to get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're making her miserable.
LEADFEMALE:Any sane person would want you out of here.
LEADFEMALE:You can say good-bye the right way or you can say good-bye your way, but you're not going to get a second chance.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:That's the last of them.
LEADMALE:So this is it for windows, huh? yeah, why? Well, that's because too many windows can be bad.
LEADFEMALE:Why is that, jackie? Well, the birds birds can fly into the windows and die, and windows are very bad for birds.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least you got a pretty good view.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there's a tree, there's some grass where? Underneath that dead guy.
LEADMALE:Jackie, if you want to make that dinner shift, we got to leave now.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Aw, this is so cool.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, someday i know that you're going to write this good-bye scene in one of your stories.
LEADMALE:So when you do, give me something really clever and really wise to say.
LEADMALE:And maybe a bigger chest.
OTHERFEMALE:You got 'em.
LEADMALE:Oh, here's a credit card for emergencies.
LEADFEMALE:You can only use it once, because your grandma doesn't know we have it.
OTHERMALE:Got it.
LEADMALE:Oh, here's some pizza money.
LEADMALE:Always tip the delivery boy.
SUPFEMALE:He is your friend.
LEADMALE:Got it.
LEADMALE:Here's some blackhawk games money.
SUPFEMALE:Opening game, you and me.
SUPFEMALE:Deal.
LEADFEMALE:Here's some dad money.
SUPFEMALE:Just spend it, okay? Okay.
SUPMALE:If you need anything, just call collect.
LEADFEMALE:And don't worry, every once in awhile i'll stuff d.j. in a hamper for you.
LEADFEMALE:Headfirst, dad.
SUPMALE:I'll follow as soon as i finish getting her unpacked here.
SUPFEMALE:Drive safe and don't flip off anybody you can't outrun.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, jackie, you got any gas money? okay, so where do you want me to put your underwear? Bottom drawer with the socks.
LEADMALE:I'm just going to let you do it.
LEADMALE:Well, i think we're done.
LEADMALE:Well, we haven't made up your bed yet.
OTHERFEMALE:I can do that.
SUPMALE:You can? where did you learn to make your own bed? Picked it up on the street.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i'll be damned.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, i guess i'll get going.
LEADMALE:I got a lot of important dishes to do.
SUPMALE:Boy, it's getting dark out there, isn't it? Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:It's clouding up.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think it might rain? Yeah, i think it might rain.
LEADMALE:Don't you have those really crappy windshield wipers on your car? Oh, not anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I switched them.
LEADFEMALE:They're on the car your dad's driving now.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, good.
OTHERFEMALE:Well well, you know, since it's late and all, you might want to crash here to avoid the rain.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, i never thought of that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you know, it's up to you.
LEADMALE:Whatever.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, sure.
OTHERMALE:Whatever.
LEADMALE:Yeah, either way.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you know, either way.
LEADMALE:I could go home or stay here.
OTHERMALE:It doesn't matter to either one of us.
LEADMALE:Eh, you know, i don't know.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe i'll stay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right, i'm going to go get ready for bed.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right back.
SUPMALE:Well, i'll be here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Hey, the rain's waking up that dead guy.
LEADFEMALE:Mom? yeah? so what do you really think of my apartment? I really think it's cool.
SUPMALE:You do not.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, i do.
SUPFEMALE:I'm jealous.
LEADFEMALE:You're like the first connor woman to ever have her own apartment.
SUPMALE:I wish i could be more excited about it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, how come you're not? because of that whole david thing? Yeah, he hates me now.
LEADFEMALE:He wants to see other people.
SUPMALE:Oh, they always say that.
SUPFEMALE:It's in the handbook.
LEADFEMALE:But what if he does see someone else? Oh, darlene, david really cares about you a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, a boy that short doesn't have that many options.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, there's something i kind of want to tell you.
SUPMALE:Okay, i kind of want to hear it.
SUPFEMALE:I slept with david.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Are you mad? Mmm.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Was i home? No.
LEADFEMALE:Were you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, jeez.
SUPFEMALE:Big-time grown-up stuff, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I was careful.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, i knew you would be.
LEADFEMALE:Are you disappointed in me? Mmm, no.
SUPFEMALE:Not really.
SUPFEMALE:I kind of knew all along anyway.
LEADMALE:I just sort of pretended i didn't so i could, you know, live.
SUPMALE:Well, how come it's so much harder to break up with a guy after you've slept with him? Well, because all human beings connect sex and love except for men.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Were you a virgin when you married dad? Yes, i was.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:I still am.
LEADMALE:Oh, so you weren't.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Wow, my mom's a big tramp.
LEADMALE:Don't get so excited, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I did it with your dad.
LEADMALE:So dad's the only one you did it with before you married him? Of course.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, i guess-yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:I'd have to say yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Who else? I said yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you were totally lying.
LEADMALE:Well, no.
LEADMALE:According to the rules i have set in my own mind i'm am going to say no.
LEADMALE:No, your father is the only one that counted.
LEADMALE:Hey, you can't do that.
SUPFEMALE:If you did it, it counts.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i'll tell you whether it counts or not.
LEADMALE:So, did it count with david? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:David counts.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's good.
SUPMALE:Thanks for staying, mom.
LEADMALE:This is the first time we've ever talked, you know, like friends.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, we could be friends.
LEADMALE:Definitely.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that would be good if we'd be friends.
SUPMALE:You know, darlene, even if i was not your mother, i would still like to know you.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, honey, this bed ain't getting any warmer.
SUPFEMALE:You know, dan, i'm a really good mom.
SUPFEMALE:No arguments here.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, like, a really, really good mom.
LEADFEMALE:Like top five, you know? Giving mary a run for her money.
SUPFEMALE:The haloed one has got nothing on you.
LEADMALE:And you don't suck as a dad.
SUPMALE:You're beautiful.
LEADMALE:You're horny.
SUPMALE:Get over here! yee-hee-hee! hee hee hee hee! yee-hee! So you want to be ribbed or tickled tonight? Tonight let's not use nothing.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think our lovemaking's dangerous enough? I want another kid.
LEADMALE:What? Maybe the fourth time we'll get one of them worker kids, the kind that support you in your old age and avenge your death like in movies and stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, a fictional child.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to say this once, dan, and tomorrow if you ask me, i might deny that i ever said it at all, but i like having kids.
SUPFEMALE:Our kids? remember when darlene was six and she took one of your unemployment checks to school for show and tell? Aw, come on.
LEADMALE:Honey, don't do this.
LEADMALE:And remember when becky was eight and she was singing along with the radio trying to act real cool, but she got all the words wrong.
LEADMALE:Remember? Gypsies, chimpanzees we heard it from the people of the town they called us gypsies chimpanzees and every night all the men would come around and lay the monkey down it's not like i haven't thought about this.
SUPMALE:It's just you could be a lot more rational about it in 15 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, well, i can wait 15 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell.
OTHERFEMALE:A fourth one won't kill me.
LEADMALE:Yee! ha ha ha! Yee-hee-hee!
LEADFEMALE:No beer? Oh, i think mark took the last one.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get you more beer, dan.
SUPFEMALE:After all, it is thanksgiving, the day where i do everything and the rest of you sit around like plymouth rock.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get the beer.
SUPFEMALE:No, i feel i should, dan.
LEADMALE:I mean, you do too much, what with having to carve the turkey tomorrow from 5:00 to 5:10.
LEADMALE:Mom, why don't you let me do the cooking this year? I mean, ever since we've moved in here, i've just felt like a burden, especially seeing how much dad hates having mark around.
LEADMALE:Oh, becky, you're no burden.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what about dad hating mark? what makes you feel like you're a burden? Come on, mom.
LEADMALE:You're doing everything for us.
LEADFEMALE:Please? Okay, i'll let you do it.
LEADMALE:I'll let you do all the cooking, all the cleaning up and all the laundry.
LEADMALE:The laundry? I took a shot.
LEADMALE:Hey, by the way, you're out of beer.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Oh, hi, darlene.
LEADMALE:Um, what time is your bus coming in? Actually, mom, i was wondering if instead of coming home it'd be okay if i went to michigan to see david.
LEADMALE:You know, i don't really get to see him that often.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, i guess you're kinda obligated.
LEADFEMALE:After all, he gives you money anytime you ask for it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, wait! that's me! Mom, i gotta spend time with him or he's gonna start seeing someone else.
LEADFEMALE:Why? is there some rush all of a sudden on 5'2" moody boys with no body hair? please? Fine.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Don't feel guilty about missing your great-grandma.
LEADMALE:I'm sure she can hang on 'til christmas.
SUPMALE:Okay, bye.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:She bought it? Yeah.
LEADMALE:We should join together and give thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Turkey's about ready.
LEADFEMALE:Did you make the stuffing? Mother, i've taken care of everything.
LEADFEMALE:For once we can have a thanksgiving where you don't have to yell and scream at everybody.
SUPMALE:Well, gee, you might as well just take the carols right out of christmas.
LEADMALE:Hello! hey, jacks! Did you bring the cranberry sauce like i asked? isn't that cute? Just like a little roseanne.
LEADMALE:What time did you get up? Look at the circles under your eyes.
LEADFEMALE:It's not cute anymore.
OTHERMALE:You need some help with that? No, no, no, i got it.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:I see you got the, uh canned yams and the carrots.
LEADMALE:By the way, i invited fred.
OTHERMALE:And the potato buds-roseanne! Well, dan said he doesn't have any family here, and, you know, it's thanksgiving, and nobody should be alone on thanksgiving except maybe mom.
LEADFEMALE:Alone? really? But still, ever since he got me pregnant, mom's been pushing me to go out with him, and if she sees him here, she's just gonna think i listen to her.
OTHERFEMALE:If she thinks i listen to her, she's gonna keep talking to me.
SUPMALE:Well, don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:We'll just tell her that fred won a turkey when he slept with ya.
LEADMALE:I just caught the biggest rat you've ever seen in that trap out in the garage.
SUPMALE:Unless what color is the martin's dog? need some help taking care of that? Nah, i'll get it later.
LEADFEMALE:You sure? Yeah, i'm sure.
LEADMALE:Suit yourself.
SUPMALE:Thanks a lot, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Mark, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez.
LEADMALE:Can't you even make an effort to try to be nice to him? I don't know, roseanne.
SUPMALE:I just find it a little awkward sharing a house with a guy who eloped with my and now he's run off with my beer.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, fred.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Glad you could make it, fred.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, with 16 cousins, my family could use the extra room at the kids' table.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know fred had 16 cousins.
OTHERFEMALE:We're a fertile people, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Guess i don't need to tell you that.
LEADMALE:You know, fred, us being here is making it very hard for them to talk about us behind out back.
LEADMALE:To the living room for football! No family for thanksgiving, huh? Stop trying to shove us together.
OTHERFEMALE:Correct me if i'm wrong, but i think the two of you have already been shoved together.
SUPFEMALE:Happy thanksgiving, everybody! You know, i had a lot more chips in here, but shirley ate them all on the way down.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, jackie! Is it true you're gonna let little betty cook the whole dinner this thanksgiving? Mother, hang your coat up, dear, right over there.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, it's awful.
SUPFEMALE:This started last month and it's gotten worse.
SUPMALE:She keeps confusing me with your aunt shirley.
LEADFEMALE:She forgets everything.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid your nana mary's mind is going.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i know this little guy! you're, um uhuhuh d.j. d.j. ! that's right! of course! d.j. ! All right, honey, you better run home now.
OTHERFEMALE:We're gonna have our dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, nana mary! hello, little betty! Oh, it's nice-uh it's nice to see her again.
LEADFEMALE:She's cute.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Listen, um, her name is becky, not betty.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah! And i'm not jackie, i'm roseanne.
LEADMALE:Roseanne? roseanne? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie is the one that tried to iron your neck when she was 4.
LEADMALE:Oh, my achin' back.
LEADMALE:That wasn't jackie, that was you, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Wellwhat's going on? Listen, i'm not senile.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just having a little fun with your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:That is so cool.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna remember that for when i'm old and little betty's all grown up.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, um, this is my nana mary.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you, fred.
OTHERFEMALE:You're the guy that finally knocked up jackie.
SUPMALE:I hear that you busted right through the condom.
SUPMALE:I don't think i should sit too close to him, huh? is this too close? I see fred is here.
LEADMALE:How "with it" for our jackie to invite the father of her child to thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:No, she didn't invite him, i did.
LEADFEMALE:What is wrong with the girl, roseanne? I keep telling her that child needs a father.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's exactly what's wrong.
SUPFEMALE:If you keep telling her that, she's never gonna do it.
SUPFEMALE:So what should i do then? just say nothing? No.
LEADMALE:I mean, i would enjoy that, but you see, if you really want jackie to get together with him then you should tell her that you hate him.
SUPMALE:That's ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADFEMALE:Our whole lives we've done everything just to disappoint you.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you think i live like this? Fine, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:If i have to lie in order to give advice to my daughter, then so be it.
LEADMALE:By the way, your cheekbone makeup is lovely! The more you use, the more i like it.
LEADMALE:Mark! It's thanksgiving and you're a guy.
SUPMALE:Your job is to be out there watching football.
LEADMALE:I don't know anything about it.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't cared about football since i was about well, just say what you know.
LEADFEMALE:Dad will appreciate the effort.
OTHERMALE:Or you could stay in here with us girls and talk about jackie's hemorrhoids.
SUPFEMALE:Standing's getting to be worse than sitting.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Draw play, barry sanders.
LEADMALE:Looking for running room.
OTHERFEMALE:Turns to the right side.
SUPMALE:To the 45 it's too bad about old brian piccolo, huh? Well, that wasn't too bad.
LEADMALE:Hello? Oh, hey, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:How's it going? Hello, jackie.
LEADMALE:Hi, mom.
LEADFEMALE:You and nana mary have a nice drive? Yes! Now she's in there entertaining fredhhmmph.
SUPFEMALE:What's that supposed to mean? Oh, you want me in there entertaining fred.
LEADFEMALE:I told you before, mom, he's not my boyfriend.
LEADMALE:No? Well, thank heaven! Him being here for thanksgiving and all, i was afraid he was.
SUPFEMALE:Whew! you don't want him to be my boyfriend? him? eessh! Why not? Because he's not good.
OTHERMALE:He's bad.
SUPMALE:He's bad, that's why.
LEADMALE:I just thought i'd let you know.
SUPFEMALE:So, fred we have a little time before dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Do you ever wonder what sex is gonna be like with jackie say, in 50 years? Fred even though you have a full beer in your hand, my guess is that you'd like to go to the kitchen right now and get another one.
LEADMALE:You read my mind.
SUPMALE:Hey, kid, rub my feet, will ya? wait for me! Mother-[sighs]-what were you just trying to pull in there? whatever are you talking about? Roseanne, you gotta hear this.
LEADMALE:For three months now, she's been trying to get me to go out with fred.
LEADFEMALE:Now, all of a sudden, she doesn't like him anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think nana mary is the only one around here losing her mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, jenny, give it to her good.
SUPFEMALE:By the way, when do we start hunting for the eggs? I haven't lost my mind.
LEADMALE:Maybe i've just changed my mind.
LEADMALE:No, i know what you're doing.
LEADMALE:What, did you read about reverse psychology in ladies' home journal or something? can you believe this, roseanne? No, i don't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe it at all.
OTHERMALE:God, mom, it's so lame! Try to give jackie a little credit.
SUPFEMALE:It was her! it was all her! she made me do it! that's so ridiculous! roseanne! I didn't say anything like that.
LEADMALE:It's totally untrue.
LEADFEMALE:You think i would do-all right, i did.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe you would use mom to manipulate me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i applaud her efforts to get you two together.
LEADMALE:You got pregnant, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Now you must face the consequences and marry the father.
LEADMALE:Oh, come off it, bev! You think everybody's gotta make the same stupid mistake you made? what? Mother.
SUPMALE:So you got yourself knocked up with roseanne and you had to get married.
SUPFEMALE:That doesn't mean jackie has to do it.
LEADFEMALE:You were pregnant with me before you married dad? Damn right she was.
OTHERMALE:We always lied about the day she got married.
SUPFEMALE:She got married june 1952.
LEADFEMALE:And you were born in november 1952.
LEADFEMALE:Do a little math.
LEADFEMALE:You are not senile, you're just mean! you promised me that you would never tell that! no one in this whole family cares about me! my children don't love me! you don't love me! i'm all alone! alone! I'm going after her, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Release the dogs.
SUPMALE:You okay, jackie? Get out of my way, fred.
LEADMALE:I'm not missing this.
LEADMALE:Yeah, fred, we're quite a family.
SUPMALE:Now that you've gotten one of us pregnant, it's too late to escape.
LEADMALE:Dad, mom and jackie are still chasing grandma.
LEADMALE:So can you put the leaves in the table? Yeah, okay.
LEADMALE:Mark will help you.
SUPFEMALE:No, i can do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:That's just great, dad.
LEADFEMALE:You won't even let mark help you with the table? It's not that big a job.
SUPFEMALE:It's got nothing to do with that.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:I'll let him help me with the table.
SUPMALE:I know he's looking for work.
SUPMALE:He keeps on trying to be nice to you, and you won't even be in the same room with him! ow! becky? dad! what happened? I burned my hand! I'll get some ice.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? It hurts! i burned my hand! Stick it under cold water.
OTHERFEMALE:No, ice is better.
OTHERMALE:She's all right! how did it happen? what's the difference how it happened? she burned herself! i'm putting ice on it! What the hell's wrong with you? hey, you wanna help? Clean up the spill.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, let's mellow out! i can handle this, dan! yeah, you can handle it! what's that supposed to mean? it means you're living here! you handle things great! you told us to move in here! what's the problem now? my problem is my daughter married a guy that can't take care of her! what's going on? that's the first time you've acted like a man the whole time i've known ya! What in the hell is going on? Everything's fine, rosie.
LEADMALE:Dan! bedroom! Mark hit dad, and then dad hit mark real hard.
LEADMALE:Man, darlene, you picked the wrong year to miss thanksgiving.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, roseanne, i know it was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:What was it like to hit him? what? was it great? did you feel bone? Roseanne, this isn't a good thing.
SUPFEMALE:It was stupid.
OTHERFEMALE:I could have really hurt him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know that.
OTHERMALE:Of course i know that.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:Man, what a thanksgiving this turned out to be, huh? Mom runs away and then you beat up our son-in-law.
SUPMALE:Did you draw blood? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You know, now that i got it out of my system, i feel pretty good.
LEADMALE:Think i'm gonna calm down for a minute and go out there and apologize.
SUPMALE:Hey, dan i'm sorry for taking that first shot, you know? you okay? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Are you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Nice right.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, you, too.
OTHERFEMALE:I was, uh the other side.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow! Men are amazing.
LEADMALE:Just like, one shot, okay, you get it all out of your system, and now you're like buddies? Maybe you should hit him, too.
SUPFEMALE:No, not after the fight's over.
OTHERMALE:It would just seem mean now.
LEADMALE:Uh, roseanne? Your mother's out on the porch, and she absolutely does not want you to go out there and talk to her.
SUPMALE:She told me to tell you that.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, maybe it's time i become buddies with mom.
LEADMALE:Puucchh! Mom, it's cold out here.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come back in the house.
OTHERMALE:I'm too embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:I acted like such a fool.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know, but this time it was so extreme that we all felt really sorry for you.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry i didn't tell you, roseanne, but it was a different time.
SUPFEMALE:People didn't talk about these things.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, well, what about the last two decades? I'm an adult.
SUPFEMALE:I could have handled it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not sure i could have handled you knowing it.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding me? This is, like, the coolest thing i've ever heard about you.
LEADFEMALE:Really? then you don't think less of me? No way, mom.
SUPMALE:I guess i should have been honest with you girls about this years ago.
SUPMALE:If i had, maybe jackie wouldn't be repeating my mistakes.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, mom, jackie's kid isn't born yet.
LEADFEMALE:She hasn't even begun to repeat your real mistakes.
LEADFEMALE:Wellthis wasn't nearly as bad as i thought it was gonna be.
SUPMALE:Mm, well, wait a minute, mom.
LEADMALE:I'm not done talking about this yet.
LEADFEMALE:All right, i guess you have a right to ask me a few questions.
LEADMALE:If you hadn't got pregnant with me would you still have married dad? Well, no.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think that's why he was mad all the time? you know, you think that's why he treated me and jackie like he did? Oh, roseanne, you know your father loved you.
LEADFEMALE:You think that's why? Well i don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, i'm gonna ask you one more question, okay? All right.
SUPFEMALE:Was dad the only guy that you were, you know, sleeping with, or is it possible that you've been lying to me my whole life about who my real father is? Of course he was the only one! Damn.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, d.j. , our dinner's ready too.
LEADFEMALE:What? No, i don't want to hear nana mary snoring.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:I feel kind of bad that we're not there.
LEADMALE:Why? They're not even your family.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I still feel bad.
LEADMALE:Don't you miss 'em? No, i'm fine here.
LEADFEMALE:Not at all? No, just shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Want some dinner? I'm carving.
SUPMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:You want light or dark? you burnt the macaroni? No.
LEADFEMALE:Most of it's okay.
LEADMALE:Darlene, the fact that we're having macaroni and cheese on thanksgiving is like cool and nonconformist, right? i mean, it's not pathetic or anything, is it? are you kidding? This is totally cool.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm back.
OTHERMALE:Hope no one missed me.
LEADFEMALE:I always like to take a little walk before dinner.
SUPFEMALE:If only we lived on the rim of a volcano.
LEADFEMALE:You okay? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's funny, but being unmarried and knocked up is the first thing i've had in common with mom.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah, that and the 'roids.
SUPMALE:Dad, me and mark, jackie and fred, nana mary uh, don't sit jackie next to fred.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:After having a talk with mom about her life and all the mistakes she made, i decided i'm not gonna push you to get together with fred anymore.
LEADFEMALE:'til after the holidays.
LEADMALE:So, becky, how's the hand? Oh, it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't you go call everybody for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:You go take all the glory, and i'll take over for you in here.
LEADMALE:I said i'd do everything and i'll do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't be a martyr, becky.
SUPFEMALE:You've been on your feet all day.
LEADFEMALE:You deserve to sit with your husband and have a nice dinner.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, mom.
SUPMALE:Dinner's ready! God, i have to do everything around here.
LEADMALE:More eating for me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, becky, your fist thanksgiving is a total success.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bev, i'm sorry i upset you so much before.
LEADMALE:I shouldn't have given away your little secret about how you got pregnant and had to marry al.
OTHERFEMALE:Mother, what are you talking about? Well, you didn't have to get so embarrassed nowadays.
SUPMALE:I mean, you threw a tantrum and ran down the streets like a raving lunatic.
LEADMALE:Mother, that was thanksgiving five years ago.
OTHERMALE:What the hell are you talking about? No, it wasn't.
LEADMALE:Was it? I know it's hard at your age, but try to stay with us.
LEADMALE:I don't smell the co-mingled scents of sweat and jean nate.
SUPMALE:Can i assume that roseanne's not in today? Nope, she's at home.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, good.
LEADMALE:Can i have a word with you? I need someone with impeccable taste, and i can tell by that paw print jumpsuit of yours that you're my woman.
LEADFEMALE:It has a matching cape.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-hmm, i bet it does.
SUPMALE:Here, try this.
OTHERMALE:I found a way of cooking the loose meat into an omelet.
SUPFEMALE:It's sort of like an egg and meat sandwich.
LEADMALE:Mmm, delicious! Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Thinking of adding it to the menu? Well, i would, except that, you know, eggs aren't exactly the best lunchtime fare.
LEADMALE:No, they're better for breakfast.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Are you suggesting that we open the diner for breakfast, thereby expanding our menu and drawing in a whole new customer base? I love it! Well, it was just a-just a thought.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, leon.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne won't wanna do breakfast.
OTHERMALE:I once suggested we expand the hours and she thought it was dumb.
LEADFEMALE:She called you "dumb," jackie? Oh, i am so sorry.
SUPMALE:Well, she didn't say that i was dumb; she said that my idea was-well, it sounded different the way she said it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, of course we could stick with roseanne's plan of just serving lunch and dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we could afford health insurance in about two years.
SUPMALE:Gosh, i hope you can hold it in till then.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i like the breakfast idea.
LEADMALE:I say we vote "yes".
OTHERMALE:Whoa, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:We can't vote without roseanne here.
SUPFEMALE:That breakfast idea could be a big disaster.
SUPFEMALE:Nancy's idea a disaster.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't feel bad, kid.
SUPMALE:I'm sure she didn't mean it.
LEADMALE:Hey, jackie, i don't have ideas often.
SUPMALE:I'm proud of this one.
LEADMALE:You know, jackie, i'm sure it's easier having roseanne make all your decisions for you, but eventually, you're gonna have to cut the chord.
OTHERMALE:Or else, you and the kid and roseanne are gonna look like mountain-climbers.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, now, roseanne does not control me.
LEADMALE:Well, then, let's vote on breakfast.
LEADMALE:I vote "yes".
LEADFEMALE:Yes! I voteokay.
LEADMALE:I got chills.
SUPMALE:We open monday at 6 a.
SUPFEMALE:M.
LEADMALE:Well, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Who's gonna tell roseanne? Well, it was nancy's idea.
LEADMALE:Good luck, nance.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Sorry those weren't done.
OTHERFEMALE:That's okay, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I know there wasn't time to do the dishes and fall asleep in a puddle of your own drool.
SUPMALE:D.j. said he'd do 'em after his homework.
LEADFEMALE:Now, dan, i think the dishes should come before the homework.
SUPMALE:If he doesn't learn how to do dishes, he'll never get a job after high school.
SUPMALE:Honey, you're tired; why don't you call leon and tell him you're not going to work today? I can't.
LEADMALE:Leon is, like, on to me.
LEADFEMALE:He knows that i control the restaurant, you know, so he's trying to stage this bloodless coup down there to oust me, and he knows that i know.
SUPMALE:So he's trying to get rid of me before i can get rid of him.
LEADMALE:Boy, does he sound paranoid.
SUPFEMALE:You know, he thinks he's so nifty because he turned jackie and nancy against me.
SUPMALE:You know, well, i broke 'em; anybody can ride 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:I better go.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, you gotta drive d.j. to his basketball practice.
SUPMALE:D.j. , come in here! Wrong, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. 's basketball practice is wednesday.
LEADMALE:Uh-uh, it's on tuesday.
SUPMALE:I think i know this.
LEADMALE:D.j. , is basketball on tuesday or wednesday? Tuesday.
LEADMALE:Duy! I don't play basketball.
SUPFEMALE:I quit at the end of last season.
SUPFEMALE:Duy, duuuy.
LEADFEMALE:Face it, dan, we're workin' so much, we hardly know our kid at all anymore.
LEADMALE:I think i'm forgettin' what "d.j. " stands for.
SUPMALE:Gotta go.
SUPMALE:Sokid, what's new in your life anyway that i don't know about? I got married.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, where'd you park your car? what do you mean? I checked it with the valet.
SUPFEMALE:I'm serious, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:It's not in the driveway.
LEADFEMALE:Did you leave your keys in the car? what you mean, did i leave the keys in the car? They're not hangin' on the hook.
LEADMALE:Well, it don't matter what i do with my keys, 'cause i know i put the club on.
LEADMALE:Where'd you leave the key to the club? You didn't do the dishes.
OTHERFEMALE:I love the new breakfast sandwich.
LEADFEMALE:Who asked ya? so, do you guys know what you want yet? We need more time.
LEADMALE:There's, like, one thing on the menu.
SUPMALE:How much more time do you think you need? what is it again? It is eggs and loose-meat sandwich.
LEADFEMALE:What's in it? Chow mein, hence the name.
LEADMALE:We're gonna need more time.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe you'd feel more comfortable yelling your order into the mouth of a clown.
SUPMALE:Nancy? Hey, my breakfast idea brought in a whole new customer base.
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:They're all over 35 and they all want a sammich.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, we're making really good money.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but it isn't supposed to be about the money.
SUPMALE:Don't you remember the old days? It was about us having our own business that we run our own way without no man tellin' us what to do.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, you ran the place.
OTHERMALE:You told us what to do.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened to that? I think you're being hard on leon.
LEADFEMALE:He's a really good organizer.
LEADFEMALE:Plus, he tells us when we've done a good job.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you do do a good job.
LEADFEMALE:Both of you.
LEADFEMALE:You're both great workers.
OTHERFEMALE:Then why don't you ever say it? 'cause it's a big, fat lie! At least i'm honest.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, ladies.
LEADMALE:Could you please not be so patronizing.
SUPMALE:We're not ladies; we are women.
SUPFEMALE:And i'm not patronizing; i'm condescending.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy, when you have a second, i wanna show you the prototype for the uniform.
LEADMALE:Uniform? Now, roseanne i thought we agreed we wasn't gonna wear them humiliatin' things.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when i was talkin' to leon the other day, i came up with a great idea that the uniforms would make us stand out from the customers more.
LEADFEMALE:So why would we wanna do that? Then they'd know who to go to to bring 'em more stuff! Well, we thought it was a good idea when we voted on it yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you says you wasn't gonna vote on nothin' if i ain't here.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, first we voted on whether or not to vote without you, and i voted "no", but i lost.
OTHERFEMALE:So then, we voted on whether or not to have the uniforms.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and how'd you vote on that? That was a secret ballot.
SUPMALE:I can't tell you that.
LEADFEMALE:We also voted that the restaurant's official bird should be the toucan.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to see the bird i voted for? No, really! the cops are here and everything! Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:What's goin' on, dan? Hey, rosie.
OTHERFEMALE:The cops found the car in a ditch a couple blocks away.
LEADMALE:What do we got, boys? Quite a bit of damage.
LEADFEMALE:Passenger door was smashed in, the fender was all dented, busted headlight.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that sounds like our car all right.
LEADMALE:Phoned in a 1099? For a backup and a possible 1057.
SUPMALE:Good man.
LEADMALE:Did you have anything of value that should be reported? Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact.
LEADMALE:We just bought a brand new, really expensive stereo system.
LEADFEMALE:What kind was it? A, uh, pflegular.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, p-f and, uh, two dots over the u.
SUPMALE:Well, there is some good news.
SUPMALE:We were patrolling around the vicinity and found a witness who saw the guy.
LEADMALE:He describes him as a juvenile, caucasian, dark hair, dark eyes, resembling eddie munster.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta get off the phone now.
LEADMALE:I was just going down the street.
LEADFEMALE:George dared me.
SUPMALE:Then i got stuck in the mud and couldn't get out.
SUPFEMALE:So you come home and you just go to bed and you don't even tell us about it? I forgot.
LEADMALE:I think we can handle things from here, guys.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, don't leave me alone with them! You really blew it this time, d.j. you coulda had a horrible accident.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing happened.
LEADMALE:Nothin' happened? you stole a car! you coulda gotten yourself killed! how stupid are you anyway? what were you thinkin' about? you think it's funny or somethin'? Answer me! Let me handle this.
SUPFEMALE:No, you had your turn.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell's that supposed to mean? That is supposed to mean that if i'm not around him every minute, he's gonna end up in prison! shut up and leave me alone! no, i'm not done with you yet! ow! ow! stop! roseanne! ow! leave me alone! roseanne! Honey leave me alone.
SUPMALE:Look, roseanne, what you just did in there, it's not that big a deal.
SUPMALE:Yes, it is.
SUPFEMALE:You're not helping, dan.
LEADMALE:Look, i know what you feel like.
SUPMALE:You've gotta talk about this.
OTHERMALE:Hey, she doesn't need you makin' somethin' outta nothin'.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't grow up in our house.
LEADMALE:This is different! the kid had it comin'! he coulda killed himself! she was out of control! it was just like dad! Why don't you both just shut up and leave me alone? You heard her.
OTHERFEMALE:I got some stuff to do.
LEADFEMALE:Ugh.
LEADFEMALE:Telling her to ignore what she did isn't gonna make her feel any better.
LEADMALE:Oh, but calling her a "child-beater" is.
LEADMALE:You just don't get it, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I am so sick of hearin' i "don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:" look, i know your father was a jerk, but that's got nothin' to do with what's goin' on.
LEADMALE:That has everything to do with it! these patterns repeat! Well, then, you better look out 'cause my father used to love to hit his sister-in-law.
LEADMALE:I can't even talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Look, look, look, look she did it because she's stressed out from work and it would help if you didn't always vote against her! I'm not voting against her; i'm voting for my baby.
LEADFEMALE:Leon's makin' us a lot of money down there.
LEADFEMALE:And if you're so worried about her stress, why don't you help out more? i help out a lot around here! how? you know how i'm gonna help her? By throwin' you outta the house! too late! she already did! Hang on.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, leon.
LEADMALE:Doin' the books? Yes, dan.
OTHERMALE:Trying to make conversation? Actually, i came to talk about roseanne.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No, i don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? what's the matter? Well, you're a rather large man, dan.
LEADFEMALE:And if we discuss your wife, i can either say nice things or i can be honest and get my arms torn off.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, leon.
OTHERFEMALE:I can sympathize with ya.
LEADMALE:Roseanne can be a little difficult.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, hell, she idles at difficult.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i-dan, you have no idea how loudly i can scream.
SUPMALE:Look, leon she is really stressed out and she just needs to spend a little more time at home.
OTHERMALE:But for some reason, she doesn't think she can talk to you about it.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i told her you'd understand.
LEADFEMALE:So if you just cut her a little slack, it'll make life easier for everybody, especially me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'd be happy to.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, you know what? I'm gonna go you one better, dan.
OTHERMALE:How much to buy her out? I'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:What? Come on, jackie and nancy are already on board with everything i'm doin' around here because i can make a success out of this place.
SUPMALE:Leon, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne started this place.
LEADFEMALE:This is her dream.
LEADMALE:Well, i have a dream too.
SUPMALE:And it's to not let her dream go bankrupt.
LEADFEMALE:See, i knew it.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
SUPMALE:You are going to hurt me.
SUPMALE:Worse.
LEADMALE:For weeks, i've been tellin' her that she's just paranoid about you, but i'm through defendin' ya.
SUPFEMALE:From now on, you fight your battles on your own against roseanne.
SUPMALE:May god have mercy on your soul.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , come down here! What? Well, i thought maybe you might wanna spoil your dinner.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Would you mind watching if i spoil mine? do i have to? Yeah, yeah, you do.
LEADMALE:I think we should, you know, talk about stuff you know, 'cause, uh, today was really bad.
LEADMALE:Mm i'm really sorry that i hit you, d.j. i mean, it was totally wrong.
SUPMALE:I never should have done that and i'm so mad at myself for doin' it.
SUPMALE:I wanna go upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:You can't go upstairs till we talk this all out.
LEADFEMALE:Um i know how you're feelin' and i know you're feelin' mad and, you know, kind of embarrassed and-wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's the way that i used to feel when i got hit.
SUPMALE:Who hit you? Your grandpa hit me.
SUPFEMALE:A lot.
SUPMALE:What'd you do wrong? I think i breathed or something.
SUPFEMALE:Do you hate him? Yeah, sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:You know, 'cause, uh, the worst thing was that he never ever said he was sorry for any of it, you know? I don't want you to hate me, d.j. i'm really sorry that i hit you.
SUPMALE:And no matter what, i'm never gonna hit you again, ever.
LEADFEMALE:No matter what i do? I mean it, no matter what you do, ever.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry you got hit.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry you got hit, too.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, big sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Like, "right now would be a great time to ask me for a new puppy" kind of sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down there, now.
SUPFEMALE:We, uh, still have to talk about this little prank you pulled.
SUPFEMALE:I thought we were done.
LEADMALE:D.j. , you stole a car.
SUPFEMALE:You've gotta take the consequences for that.
LEADFEMALE:Man! You know what, i think you're tryin' to tell me somethin' with all this stuff.
LEADMALE:I think you're tryin' to tell me that i'm not spendin' enough time with you lately.
LEADFEMALE:No, i wasn't.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i think you were, and that's why tomorrow, i'm gonna go in; i'm gonna rearrange everything; i'm gonna make sure that i have more time here with you.
LEADMALE:But you can't; you work.
SUPMALE:So? sometimes you gotta trade what's important for what's more important, you know? And i'm gonna make sure that i have a lot of time to spend with you, d.j. i'm gonna be here all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Is that my punishment? You are a funny, funny little man, d.j. a funny little man.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne jackie doesn't fit into hers, but where's your uniform? oh, well, i tore it all up to use for bandages, you know? But then i remembered there was no war.
LEADMALE:Pfft, whoops.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if i'm the only one wearing it, then it isn't a uniform.
LEADFEMALE:People are gonna just think i have really bad taste in clothes or something.
SUPFEMALE:Afternoon, uh, people.
LEADMALE:That is a safe term, isn't it? I wouldn't want to offend you ladies.
LEADMALE:And i wouldn't want to offend you either, you balding albino idiot.
LEADMALE:Let me know when i cross the line.
LEADMALE:I thought you were gonna try spending more time at home.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i was, but me and dan talked about it, and we thought you might like that.
LEADMALE:Oh, slave boy! What's he doing here? Five to ten, grand theft auto.
SUPFEMALE:He can't be here.
LEADFEMALE:He's a child.
LEADMALE:I know, but he was tried as an adult.
LEADFEMALE:And his punishment is that he's gonna help me around the diner here so i have more time to bother you.
SUPMALE:Well, you can't do this, roseanne, because a child cannot work in this restaurant.
LEADMALE:Too late.
LEADMALE:We took a vote while you were out.
LEADMALE:To work, d.j. i hate you! You know what's so great, d.j. ? We're not just spending a lot of time together, we're spending quality time together.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, this connor kid is pretty tough.
SUPFEMALE:He comes from a problem family, so we don't really know what to expect.
SUPMALE:Police! we're comin' in! go! go! go! go! freeze! police! Hey, why don't you leave my kid alone, you [bleep].
LEADFEMALE:Okay, lady, where is he? You're hurtin' my arm, you [bleep].
LEADFEMALE:Drop the pizza, d.j. it's the cops! get down here! d.j. ! the cops are here! get your outta this house! where is he? He went out the window! he took our car! And you left the keys in it, didn't you, for brains?

LEADFEMALE:J.
LEADFEMALE:] i have homework! you can do it in the car! i'm sick! you can do that in the car, too! i don't wanna go to the ballet! Ballets are for girls.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. ! Ballets aren't just for girls.
SUPFEMALE:They're fun.
SUPFEMALE:And you know, you just might learn somethin'.
OTHERMALE:Please yeah, he's gonna learn how to mince around in public, wearing tights.
LEADFEMALE:Why the ballet? 'cause we get rid of him for two days, you know? And if he comes back with certain awakenings, well, we had the weekend.
LEADMALE:Morning.
SUPMALE:Where'd you hide becky's present? In the cereal.
SUPFEMALE:What if she eats it? Dan, other people look at their food first.
LEADMALE:What you doin', becky? Lookin' for a job.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, in that case, you'll need some cereal.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm not that hungry.
LEADMALE:You're gonna need your strength, you're gonna be out there lookin' for work.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:I guess i'll have some toast or somethin'.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? you too good for cereal, all of a sudden? Fine! I'll have cereal.
SUPMALE:Oh my god.
SUPFEMALE:What's this check for? That's enough for a full semester at the community college.
LEADFEMALE:Assuming none of your classes require books.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you guys afford this? Well, funniest thing happened, the other day.
OTHERMALE:I was out shootin' at some food, when up through the ground come a-bubblin' crude.
SUPMALE:And i circled some of the courses that you might be interested in, particularly this "classics of your world literature," there, so you can understand what me and your daddy's talkin' about around the dinner table.
SUPMALE:Man, you guys, this is so great! I gotta go tell mark.
SUPFEMALE:Hm.

LEADMALE:Tomorrow night, don't wait up! we won't be back until after 10! Oh, bev.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll be back before that.
SUPMALE:It's only a two-four drive.
LEADMALE:55 is the speed limit, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:The limit! It doesn't mean you have to go that fast.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.

SUPFEMALE:Dwellers! From the neighborhood association.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, them "mow your lawn" people? This holiday season, we're asking everyone to restrict their decorations to simple white lights, in order to avoid eyesores such as last year's faded plastic santas and 3-legged reindeer.
OTHERMALE:Well, what are we supposed to do with him? shoot him? They've singled us out, honey.
LEADFEMALE:We're the tackiest house in the whole neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:Well this year, i say we go for the national title.
SUPFEMALE:This really sucks, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll stay here alone, on christmas, in this room, with no one to talk to.
LEADMALE:Well, why don't you just come home with me? Right.
LEADMALE:Like your mom's gonna believe i left my mom for christmas.
SUPFEMALE:I left mine for thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you're a bad daughter.
LEADMALE:I'm a good son.
LEADMALE:Well, fine.
SUPMALE:Then stay.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm gonna have to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Which means i'll have to spend that money we've been saving.

OTHERMALE:That ain't a wise man.
LEADFEMALE:That's gumby.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we'll just use some myrrh to level out his head, and no one will know the difference.
LEADMALE:Great idea.
SUPMALE:And then we can have the blessed virgin ride into bethlehem on pokey.
SUPFEMALE:Two mangers! well! dueling saviors! hah-hoo! And that's not all.
LEADMALE:Ta-daa! Liberace.
OTHERMALE:Because there was no room at the desert inn.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Well, you did pretty good, dan.
SUPFEMALE:But, uh, i'm afraid all of your stuff pales, in comparison to my find.
LEADFEMALE:You see, pancho's went out of business.
LEADMALE:Behold! The goddess of tacky.
OTHERMALE:Hey, i'll see you after i pick up the application, okay? Oh, by the way, thanks for the money.
LEADMALE:That was uhreally cool of you guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's he goin'? Welp, mark and i talked things over, and we decided the best way to use the money would be to send mark to school.
OTHERMALE:Hey, youwait a minute! That's supposed to be becky money, not mark money.
SUPFEMALE:Well, there's this new course at the tech school, on how to run a garage.
LEADFEMALE:In 6 months, he'll be able to get a good job, and pay for my college.
LEADMALE:Wake up, becky! In 6 months, you couldn't teach him to pull his hand off a hot burner.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad? wouldn't you rather pay for 6 months of his college than 4 years of mine? You know, that doesdan! we worked hard for that money! That coulda been our dream vacation.
LEADMALE:Dollywood and twitty city.
LEADMALE:Dad! dan daddy! Danny boy, do i have no opinion about this.
SUPFEMALE:Well, dapper dan, you have to pick a side.
LEADFEMALE:A side, roseanne? well, my side! mom! you can't do that! Well, what if, uhwhen he gets out, mark doesn't get a job? okay? what if they are only hiring women and minorities, or people that aren't distracted by shiny objects? This is what's right for us.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think it is.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's a mistake, and i'm not gonna let you do it with my money.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Fine, then! We don't need you or your stupid money.
LEADMALE:From now on, we're gonna do everything all by ourselves.
SUPMALE:We're gonna pay for our own food, rent everything! Oh, well, that really hurts.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! if you really wanna kill us, why don't you just go out and buy us a car? Say somethin', dan! I'm pretty sure that mrs.
OTHERMALE:Puente is the head of the neighborhood association that sent us this nice letter.
OTHERMALE:I think we'll plug in over at her house this year.
LEADMALE:What a lovely afternoon! You know, i never feel like it's christmas till i see the nutcracker.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:That was the longest i never thought i'd long for the ice capades.
LEADFEMALE:Well, d.j. we should really be getting back to lanford.
SUPFEMALE:You say goodbye to your sister while i powder my nose.
LEADMALE:Well, this should be an experience.
LEADMALE:D.j. , i bought you your video games yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Now we're even.
OTHERMALE:You keep your mouth shut about david, or you die.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Why's david here, anyway? Because he couldn't stand your smell, either.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Really.
LEADMALE:Why is he here? Because we wanted to be together.
SUPMALE:Why? Because we do.
LEADMALE:When you have a girlfriend someday, or a really good blow-up doll, you'll understand.
LEADMALE:Do you guys have sex? That is not for you to know.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll tell mom about david.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, all right, d.j. i'm gonna level with you, and talk to you like you're an adult.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:David and i are not having sex.
SUPFEMALE:They told us at school.
LEADMALE:If you don't want a baby, you'd better use birth control.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:This conversation is not happening.
OTHERFEMALE:So do you use birth control? Yes, d.j. we keep a picture of you right next to the bed.
LEADMALE:You're not ever coming home again, are you? You should be so lucky.
LEADMALE:It's all different now.
LEADMALE:What is? Everything.
LEADMALE:Becky just cares about mark.
SUPMALE:You're gone.
SUPFEMALE:Well, gee, deej.
LEADMALE:I never thought you'd actually miss me.
LEADMALE:You want me to, like, sit on your head or somethin'? Mm, no.
LEADMALE:Maybe later.
LEADFEMALE:Got a girl job, here.
LEADFEMALE:I need someone to untangle these christmas lights.
LEADFEMALE:Lookit, they marked all their stuff.
OTHERMALE:Healy cheese.
SUPMALE:Healy jelly.
LEADFEMALE:And healy pudding treats.
LEADMALE:Can you believe that? No.
SUPMALE:When did they start makin' chocolate mint? And then she did their laundry this morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Look what i found on top of the washing machine.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say to that? Great.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna buy me a puddin'.
OTHERMALE:Dan, you have got to talk mark out of goin' to that school.
LEADMALE:I can't do that.
LEADMALE:Yes, you can.
LEADFEMALE:You just talk real slow.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm busy untangli'' these lights.
SUPFEMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:They're untangled.
LEADMALE:Hi, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, quit suckin' up.
LEADMALE:He's not gonna take a side.
SUPMALE:So where have you been? I got a job at a restaurant.
LEADMALE:Startin' training today.
OTHERFEMALE:What? buns? it's my waitress uniform! You're workin' at that buns place? Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i don't know about you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:But i have absolutely no opinion on this at all.
SUPFEMALE:Does you husband know what you're doin'? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Unbelievable.
SUPMALE:This isn't gonna happen, becky.
SUPFEMALE:I am old enough to do what i want.
OTHERMALE:And i want to send my husband to school.
LEADMALE:As long as you are living under my roof, you are not workin' there.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Your dad is right.
LEADMALE:And we're gonna give her back the check, so mark can go to school.
LEADMALE:Your dad's an idiot.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, you wanted me to take a side? My little girl is not going to work dressed like that.
LEADMALE:I am not a little girl! Why can't either of you take me seriously? Because you've got words on your butt.
LEADFEMALE:Now go change your clothes.
LEADMALE:So what? now you just wanna give mark the money? No, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Believe it or not, i'm not too thrilled with the guy right now.
LEADMALE:But i've seen what goes on in that place, and i don't want my daughter to have anything to do with it.
SUPMALE:You've been inside that place? Ugh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I heard the food was good, and you know, brand new, and they couponhey! mark's the bad guy here! i got work to do! Hey, can you staple this down there? Sure, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Watch it! oh, is that your foot? Yeah! Sorry.
LEADMALE:What are ya doin' that for? I did that 'cause get a damn job.
SUPMALE:Hey, i'm tryin', here.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, you are.
LEADFEMALE:Why should you, when you can have your wife go out there and shake her money-maker? I can't believe you let her work there.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, let her? I don't make my wife's decisions.
SUPFEMALE:She's got some rights in this marraige.
SUPMALE:Oh, that is just beautiful.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well.
LEADMALE:I didn't really buy it, either.
SUPMALE:It sounded better when becky said it.
LEADMALE:And of course, she was screaming.
LEADMALE:So you're against her having this job? Yeah, i was against it! Forbid her.
SUPFEMALE:You forbid her? Oh, man.
LEADMALE:That can't have been good! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Then she started yelling, you know.
LEADMALE:"just because you married me, doesn't mean you own me.
SUPMALE:"i'm an adult, and" and she'll do what she damn well pleases.
LEADMALE:How'd you know? I remember everything about my wedding night.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, is it always gonna be like this? Nah.
LEADMALE:No, because eventually, like water to a man crossing the desert, comes sweet, sweet death.
SUPFEMALE:Huh? Never mind.
LEADMALE:You see, mark, in a marraige, there's first, there's your win/lose situation.
LEADMALE:That's where you get what you want, and she has to sacrifice.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:That one's mostly theoretical.
OTHERMALE:The second one, there's the lose/win situation.
LEADMALE:That's where she gets what she wants, and you lose it.
SUPFEMALE:Much more common.
OTHERFEMALE:Then finally, and as long as you'll be livin' under this roof, there's the win/win situation.
SUPMALE:That's where becky gets what she wants, and roseanne gets what she wants.
LEADMALE:Where do you want this? mark? Uh, where does mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner want this? Now you're talkin' like a man.
LEADFEMALE:So, like you've been dealin' with this stuff for 20 years? i mean, how do you do it? Well, mark after a while, husbands go to places they can call their own.
SUPMALE:You know, guy places like the garage.
LEADFEMALE:The basement.
LEADFEMALE:The roof.
LEADFEMALE:Bingo.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i come up here all the time and fix these damn loose shingles.
LEADFEMALE:Yah! See, now? This baby will keep me all of next week.
LEADFEMALE:And the beauty part is, the women send us up here without knowin' we life it.
SUPFEMALE:You know, dan, i'm real, uh, glad we got to talk like this.
LEADMALE:You know? I'm really feelin' better about things, andthink i'm learni'' something.
SUPFEMALE:See? Now i bet you thought i was payin' attention.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow, i'll show you how to do that.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna give her the check, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You might as well admit she beat ya.
OTHERMALE:She did not beat me.
SUPMALE:None of my kids has ever beat me, ever since i became a mother.
LEADFEMALE:I am undefeated.
OTHERMALE:And that is in 10 different weight classes.
LEADMALE:How about when becky was 6, and she gave you the silent treatment till you got her the barbie collection? I didn't get her that barbie collection.
LEADFEMALE:That was santa claus.
LEADMALE:So what's it taste like? what? The beer.
SUPMALE:I been pregnant for so long.
LEADFEMALE:Describe it to me.
OTHERMALE:Mmm you aren't missing nothing.
LEADMALE:Hoo! That hits the spot.
LEADFEMALE:Becky? Here ya go.
LEADMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:Told you so, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Not from me.
SUPMALE:It's from santy claus.
LEADFEMALE:Even if we're gonna use it to send mark to school? Doesn't matter, as long as you quit that horrible job of yours.
SUPMALE:I am not quitting the job! Oh, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:You won.
LEADFEMALE:Don't kick your mom while she's down.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't take the job to bother mom.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! What, that's just one of the perks? Including tips, i get wow, maybe i should sashay down there and pull one of them outfits up over my fat ass.
LEADMALE:Come on, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:No! hey! If you dignity's for sale, why shouldn't mine be? Oh, please.
SUPFEMALE:If this family had any dignity, there wouldn't be a row of elves on the front lawn, mooning the angel gabriel.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:We are not degrading ourselves for tips.
SUPFEMALE:We are degrading ourselves for the sheer holiday joy of it.
SUPFEMALE:But you know, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:This money could help her and mark get out of here.
LEADMALE:Start a life of their own.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, she hasn't even thought this through all the way.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you might be feelin' real good about makin' big money.
LEADFEMALE:But when you come home at night, you're gonna feel like trash.
LEADMALE:I'll feel like i'm helping my family get back on its feet.
LEADMALE:Well, what if it doesn't work out that way? I mean, you don't really know what's gonna happen between you and mark.
SUPFEMALE:You still don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:Mark is not my boyfriend.
SUPMALE:He's my husband! that means forever! she's a married woman, roseanne! Becky, come back here.
LEADFEMALE:Now you're doin' the right thing.
SUPMALE:What? Here.
OTHERFEMALE:C'mon.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mean it? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I do mean it.
SUPMALE:I will, uhtry to accept your marriage, and your new career as a prostitute.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Every damn year.
SUPMALE:Mom, they're actually workin' pretty hard up there.
SUPFEMALE:Workin'? Heh heh heh.
LEADMALE:Don't kid yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:They like it up there.
SUPMALE:Dan finally found himself a little playmate that knows all about, uhdouble-socket wrench, uh, thingers.
SUPFEMALE:The two of them really have a lot in common.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's like it's like the two of you married the same guy.
LEADMALE:Where are you goin'? Get the hard liquor.
LEADMALE:Roseanne.
SUPMALE:Your christmas decorations outside are appalling.
LEADFEMALE:The wise men are supposed to be adoring the baby jesus, not leering at mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Claus.
SUPFEMALE:Well, of course they're leerin' at her.
LEADFEMALE:She's wearin' one of those buns outfits.
LEADMALE:And what on earth are those shepherds doing to the flock? Praising them.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's time to turn on our simple white lights.
SUPMALE:Mother harris, won't you join us? what is santa claus doing? Well, he's just tellin' the whole neighborhood that christmas is number one.
LEADMALE:Hit that music, dan!
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Ugh, general hospital? why are you wasting your time watching this trash? Guiding light is on.
SUPFEMALE:Because i'm a little concerned about what they're doing with jason's character.
SUPFEMALE:It's halfway through the show and he still has his shirt on.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, he's going down to the waterfront.
SUPFEMALE:Brenda's gonna be down there crying.
LEADFEMALE:It's coming off.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, could i get some sugar? roseanne! Should i just rip off the shirt of every customer so that they can get your attention? Not these customers.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:We don't charge mr.
LEADFEMALE:Mehlman of mehlman restaurant supplies.
SUPFEMALE:He's our special friend.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, a special friend, huh? Well, the food is on the house.
OTHERMALE:If you're sleeping with leon, it's a miracle you can eat at all.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks she's funny.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i'd let the girl go except she scares away robbers.
LEADMALE:You know, i got a gal like that who works for me.
SUPFEMALE:Gives me nothing but trouble.
LEADMALE:I'd fire her, but she's my wife! Oh, my.
SUPMALE:Give maureen my love.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i got to get back to the office, find out if my employees are working hard.
LEADMALE:Or hardly working.
SUPFEMALE:Ha ha ha! You know, i hear he's considered a comic genius in france.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, let me give you a little business lesson.
LEADFEMALE:That gentleman you were just so rude to is mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Stu mehlman, who i met at the lanford mens club.
SUPFEMALE:I invited him here.
LEADFEMALE:I made friends with him.
LEADFEMALE:And now we are getting a deep fat fryer for cost.
LEADMALE:Well, that is great 'cause i'd hate to hold your face in a deep fat fryer we paid full price for.
LEADMALE:It's called networking, roseanne.
LEADMALE:And that is why i have been after jackie to join the lanford womens association.
LEADFEMALE:So we can get more things at a discount.
OTHERFEMALE:In fact, nancy why don't you join? You've been asking for more responsibility around here.
LEADFEMALE:I just meant i wanted a key.
SUPMALE:So, hey, hold on a second.
LEADFEMALE:What about me, you know? I can join some group of stupid, snobby, stuck-up broads and make friends.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, roseanne, how can i say this so that i don't hurt your feelings? You're a horrible woman and nobody likes you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, be that as it may, i'm still gonna join, and i'll get us a lot of free stuff too.
SUPFEMALE:No, face it roseanne, you just don't have the skills that it takes to represent this business.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, now, leon, i may not have your vast wealth of business experience, nor your great willingness to kiss butt, but i do have something else.
LEADMALE:Really? and what might that be? Your nipple.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! okay, so what do you think of these earrings? Oh, yeah, that's much better! These are the exact same ones i had on before.
SUPMALE:See, you're not paying any attention at all.
LEADFEMALE:I am too! Holy cow, what are you so dressed up for? 'cause i have to go impress these businesswomen so i can use 'em for contacts.
SUPFEMALE:Then later i can go back to chewing tobacky and rolling up my hair in soup cans.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:So did you make many tips tonight, or won't you know 'til you shake out your underpants? Hey, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Got to go.
LEADMALE:I'm late for class.
SUPMALE:What time did you get in last night? Mm, i don't know.
SUPMALE:Either 10:00 or 11:00.
LEADFEMALE:We really should buy a digital clock for the boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Have a nice night.
SUPFEMALE:Sohow you doing? Well, it sucks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I know he's doing it for us, but he's at school all night and i work all day.
LEADFEMALE:We don't ever get to talk anymore.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's a shame 'cause you're really missing something.
LEADMALE:I mean, when you're not around, the witty, insightful things that come out of that boy's mouth you just wouldn't believe.
SUPFEMALE:It's like the only time we spend together is when he wakes me up when he gets home.
LEADMALE:At least he's still polite enough to wake you up first.
SUPMALE:Wow, the chestnut room at the ramada inn.
LEADFEMALE:These broads have got to be doing all right.
LEADFEMALE:The rooms here are really nice too.
LEADFEMALE:I've heard.
LEADFEMALE:God, nancy, what did you dress like that for? This is a women's business meeting.
SUPFEMALE:It's not a girl bar.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, you are so naive.
OTHERMALE:Butmost of these women are married.
LEADMALE:You are so naive.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, hello, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:I'm lucille lacompt.
LEADMALE:I'm the greeter tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Entre vous.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, that's french, isn't it.
LEADFEMALE:French, the language offrance.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's certainly nice talking to you, and i'm sure we'll get the chance to talk to you again later.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, let's do that.
LEADFEMALE:I think we did pretty good there, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, all these stuck-up broads in business suits.
SUPFEMALE:I should have worn underwear.
LEADMALE:There's a mens group meeting across the hall.
OTHERMALE:All right, it's just a hassle using birth control.
LEADFEMALE:We brought her, and i have to tell everybody i'm married? Hello.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Oh, roseanne conner.
SUPFEMALE:You wouldn't be d.j. 's mother, would you? Well, that depends.
LEADFEMALE:What'd he do? You know, i think our sons are in the same class.
LEADMALE:Ohh! Oh, well, of course they are.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, d.j. talks about him all the time.
LEADMALE:Just this morning he was saying, uh, we don't see enough of that anderson kid.
SUPFEMALE:Elijah.
SUPMALE:Elijah.
LEADMALE:That's such a great name.
LEADFEMALE:I've never seen you at our meetings before.
LEADFEMALE:Do you work here in town? Um, yeah, i'm the proprietor of the lunch box.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you mean leon carp's place.
LEADMALE:Uh, no.
LEADMALE:Actually, leon is just our waiter and we let him think that he owns the place.
SUPMALE:On thursdays he thinks he's the mayor.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know how all men like to think they are the center of the universe.
OTHERMALE:I guess that's why they call it the "sun," and not the "daughter.
LEADFEMALE:" that is brilliant.
SUPMALE:You're certainly a lot wittier than that french lady we met at the door.
LEADMALE:Well, i do write the newsletter.
LEADMALE:Oh, you do.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Uh, what line of work are you in? Well, my family owns a string of bakeries throughout the entire state.
OTHERMALE:Bakeries, huh? so i guess you would make things like, i don't know, what, hamburger buns? Oh, i love that brooch, flo.
OTHERMALE:Why, thanks, ro.
LEADFEMALE:My husband gave it to me.
SUPMALE:Well, either he did something very bad or you did something very good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know, ro, i bet you are just full of the dickens.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, i've got the dickens just running right out of my ears.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the meeting's about to start.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we can chat after.
LEADMALE:Oh, i can't wait.
LEADFEMALE:I got to hand it to you, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You were very pleasant and personable.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it was fun too, although i know i'll be sore tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Hey, can i help you, buddy? Beer.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't know you were working here.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, you know me.
SUPMALE:Eccentric millionaire taking on odd jobs so he can mingle with the common folk.
LEADMALE:That's what i like about you, chuck.
LEADFEMALE:You're not stuck-up.
LEADMALE:Not like our other millionaire friend who works down at the car wash.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, what the hell are you doing here? Oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:He comes in here every night around 7:00.
SUPMALE:Mind if we talk? We'll have to keep our voices down, this being the library and all.
LEADFEMALE:Just leave me alone, dan, will you? why the hell aren't you in class? I went a couple of times.
LEADMALE:It was just not my thing, okay? what do you mean, it wasn't your thing? We gave you money for school.
LEADMALE:We own your thing.
OTHERFEMALE:It just didn't work out, so i quit.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to do? how 'bout showing the family you've got this much responsibility? Man, i can't believe i took your side back at the house.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i don't need you on my side.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:You're not gonna tell becky or mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner you saw me here, are you? Noyou are.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you save them the trouble and kill me right now? Oh, come on, mark, roseanne's not gonna kill you.
OTHERFEMALE:Not with all the questions surrounding the death of becky's first husband.
SUPMALE:So then carol collins, you know, the pie lady, she ends up leaving with nancy.
SUPFEMALE:No way, mom! I know that woman.
SUPFEMALE:She's married.
OTHERMALE:God, you're so naive.
LEADMALE:Hey, mark, how was it tonight? Tell 'em.
LEADFEMALE:I quit school.
OTHERMALE:What! I went a couple of times.
OTHERFEMALE:It just didn't work out.
SUPMALE:I found him at the lobo.
SUPMALE:He's been there every night.
LEADMALE:How could you do something like this? See, i knew you wouldn't be on my side.
OTHERMALE:On your side? why should i be on your side? You've been lying to me for weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Let's just talk about this upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I have nothing to say to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky, oh, you got plenty to say to him, starting with, "get your butt back to school!" i can't make him go.
LEADFEMALE:I don't control him.
LEADMALE:What do you mean you don't control him? You're his wife! But i still can't make him go back.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't even listen to me.
OTHERMALE:That's because you're not yelling loud enough.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not so sure you should blame her, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Mark's got a mind of his own.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i got an exercise bike too, but that don't mean i'm ever gonna use it! Come on, lucky.
SUPFEMALE:Come on out of that coma for luke and laura.
SUPFEMALE:Will liz taylor's curse never end? Sit there.

LEADMALE:Now, you stop being mean to elijah, and play with him.
LEADMALE:I can't.

LEADFEMALE:He never stops.
LEADMALE:I hate him, i hate him, i hate him! D.j. you get ahold of yourself now.
OTHERFEMALE:You are gonna play with him.
LEADFEMALE:He's a very nice boy.
LEADMALE:If you like him so much, you play with him.

SUPMALE:Start spreading the news that's elijah with a j.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Shh! Mark's reading.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, i hate to ruin the end of it for you, mark, but he eats the green eggs and ham.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm studying upstairs.
LEADMALE:Don't pick on him, mom.
LEADMALE:He's really doing it this time.
LEADFEMALE:We spent all day working together.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe how much he's learned.
SUPFEMALE:Well, does this mean we have to stop spelling stuff out that we don't want him to know about? I'm serious.
SUPMALE:I mean, you were right, mom.
LEADMALE:You can make husbands do like anything.
LEADFEMALE:You are catching on, mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Healy.
LEADMALE:Men need to be molded.
LEADFEMALE:Think of them not as lumps of clay, butas lumps.
OTHERFEMALE:Out of milk.
LEADMALE:Well, hi, flo and elijah! Cool hats.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, roseanne.
LEADMALE:We biked over here to talk to you about your son.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he did something that really upset my elijah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you for telling me.
LEADFEMALE:I will punish him severely.
SUPFEMALE:Well, don't you want to know what he did? Oh, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:That'd be good.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yesterday, in front of a large group of children, d.j. called him elijah minnelli.
SUPMALE:No, he didn't.
SUPMALE:D.j. , come out here! Children can be so cruel.
OTHERFEMALE:What? I'm gonna pretend like i'm yelling at you, so just go along with it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , i'm going to ask you a simple question, and i want a simple answer, yes or no.
LEADFEMALE:Did you call him elijah minnelli? yes, but you-yes or no? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you really hurt his feelings, d.j. as you know, i did not raise you to be a name-caller.
LEADMALE:That is mean.
SUPMALE:Tell him you're sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:You want to come over tomorrow? Uh, no, i bet i'm grounded.
OTHERMALE:You sure are.
LEADMALE:See? All right, then.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, ro.
LEADMALE:I'll look forward to seeing you at the next meeting.
LEADFEMALE:Me too, flo.
LEADMALE:And don't you worry about it, because i'm not quite done talking to this young man.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, i said i was sorry! Well, sorry really isn't good enough, is it? Come on, i'll change.
SUPFEMALE:I promise i will.
LEADFEMALE:Please! please, i promise! That's what you say every single time.
SUPMALE:I will, i will.
OTHERMALE:They're gone.
SUPMALE:Let's go have ice cream.
OTHERMALE:Hey, mark.
OTHERFEMALE:I made flash cards for the next two chapters.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? We got our tests back.
LEADMALE:The only f in the class.
SUPMALE:They even posted the grades where everybody could see 'em.
LEADMALE:You proud of me? You studied for this.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand how this could happen.
LEADFEMALE:You should never have made me go to that damn school in the first place.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't make you.
LEADMALE:You wanted to go.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong.
LEADMALE:You never even asked me.
SUPMALE:Then again, you don't give a crap what i think.
SUPMALE:You never have.
LEADMALE:Could you guys start over again? I hate it when i miss out on the beginning.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, you always thought i was stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Now, here's your proof.
LEADMALE:Go ahead, make your jokes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's really not funny now that we know it's true.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, it's kind of sad.
LEADFEMALE:Or at least not as funny.
LEADMALE:Mom, he's not stupid.
LEADMALE:He's just not good at taking tests.
LEADFEMALE:I think when you don't know any of the answers to any of the questions, you're not good at taking tests.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but look here.
LEADMALE:You spelled your name right.
SUPMALE:Although, it is the 15th.
LEADMALE:Mom, leave us alone.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i'm just teasing you, mark.
LEADMALE:Everybody gets an f.
LEADMALE:You're gonna do way better next time.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, i won't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm dropping out.
LEADMALE:Becky.
LEADMALE:Mark, you're going back.
SUPMALE:We both know it's what's best for you.
SUPMALE:No, it's what's best for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are you always trying to change me? I'm not trying to change you.
LEADMALE:I just want you to realize you're not worthless.
SUPFEMALE:I never thought i was worthless.
SUPFEMALE:That's not what i meant.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? I'm gonna stay at roy's tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Why? You're the great student.
LEADFEMALE:You figure it out.
LEADFEMALE:Go find some college boy who's got what you want.
SUPFEMALE:Mark, wait! Well, mother, i kept pushing him like you said, and he left me.
OTHERFEMALE:Congratulations, you finally broke us up.
SUPMALE:Well, it doesn't count.
OTHERFEMALE:I wasn't even trying.
LEADFEMALE:No, you guys can't break up.
LEADMALE:Listen to me.
LEADMALE:I gave some advice to my daughter, and, okay, that kind of blew up in my face, but trust me, you two belong together.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:We've been through so much, and it just gets harder.
LEADFEMALE:You wouldn't believe the incredible drama that we're always going through.
LEADMALE:Oh, wouldn't i? Dan, come out here! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:What the-oh, yes, dear? I'd like to introduce you to somebody famous.
SUPMALE:Oh, man, this is a real honor.
LEADFEMALE:Think paul simon and you will ever get back together again? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, no, we're luke and laura from general hospital.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm a guiding light man.
SUPMALE:They were telling me about all the trouble they're having in their marriage, so i thought you should tell 'em some of the stuff we've been through.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know where to start.
SUPMALE:Last year i lost my job, my daughter ran off, sister-in-law got beat up, i got thrown in jail, roseanne's dad died seems like every week something else is happening to us.
SUPMALE:It seems like it happens again in the summer too.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he got in a fight with my ex-husband on our wedding day.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that was only because you didn't make sure that stupid mexican divorce from him was legal.
LEADMALE:Well, our daughter, becky, left home for a year and a half, and when she came back we barely recognized her.
LEADFEMALE:But the most important thing is we've stuck together.
SUPMALE:Now, you two still love each other, don't you? Well i did really miss you those two years that i was abducted and held captive on that island.
SUPFEMALE:And i'll never forget the good times we had saving the world from mikkos cassadine's evil weather machine.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:I know you thought your allowance wasn't gonna get us through this month, but i brought dinner.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing how well you can eat off loose change.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
SUPMALE:Ding dongs and ho ho's.
OTHERMALE:We'd better use the floral toilet paper tonight for napkins.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:The "steak" button was stuck.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just in a really crappy mood right now.
SUPFEMALE:I just talked to my mom and i had to lie to her again.
LEADMALE:I'm getting so sick of it.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what you're saying.
LEADMALE:You don't want me here.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, david, that's exactly what i'm saying, word for word.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for listening.
OTHERMALE:You don't act like you want me here.
SUPMALE:You're always in a bad mood, i'm beginning to feel like i'm in the way.
SUPFEMALE:You're not in the way, all right? I couldn't possibly be more thrilled that you're here all day long, no matter what time it is doing absolutely nothing.
SUPFEMALE:I love that.
SUPMALE:You know, i get in bad moods, too, but i hold back.
LEADFEMALE:This is me holding back.
SUPMALE:If i wasn't holding back, the better part of your face would be under my fingernails by now.
SUPMALE:You know, the only reason that i don't do anything is because you're never around to do it with.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i'm sorry i have a life, david.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry i have friends.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry i'm not a pathetic zombie like you are.
LEADFEMALE:I do not accept your apology.
OTHERFEMALE:This whole living together thing just sucks.
SUPMALE:I'm not eating that garbage another night.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going out.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Go! Just let me get my jacket first.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! excuse me! Is mark here? He's taking a nap.
LEADFEMALE:I'm dan conner.
LEADMALE:Mark's father-in-law.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, when i was a bachelor, i had quite the sound system myself.
LEADFEMALE:Quadraphonic reel-to-reel.
LEADMALE:What kind of system do you have now? Clock radio.
LEADMALE:It's a nice one.
SUPMALE:Got two alarms.
LEADMALE:So how's mark been doing the last couple of days? why? what happened? He left his wife.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's probably why he moved in here.
LEADMALE:My guess is you and mark used to study together.
SUPMALE:Mark left his wife? That's gotta-i don't know--suck.
SUPMALE:Well they've been together quite a while and i can't imagine him being too happy living here.
SUPMALE:Whoa great tv.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know there was a game on.
LEADFEMALE:I got a satellite dish.
OTHERMALE:There's always a game on.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:So you think mark's in a lot of pain or something? Well, the man hasn't seen his wife in two days, my guess is, he's going through hell.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got a refrigerator in the living room? That's brilliant.
LEADMALE:You want something? can i get it myself? Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing here? Uh, i thought we should talk about becky.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, forget it.
LEADMALE:Look, mark, i know these problems seem huge at first, but if you just call her i mean, roseanne and i have had plenty of fights.
LEADMALE:I remember this one fight we had when i wanted the satellite dish.
SUPFEMALE:We said everything already.
LEADFEMALE:Not good enough.
SUPFEMALE:My daughter's hurtin' here.
SUPFEMALE:Did she send you down to talk to me? No, this is my idea.
SUPFEMALE:I got nothing to say to her.
LEADMALE:Come on, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Forget the pride thing.
LEADMALE:Just come home and see becky.
LEADFEMALE:Becky doesn't wanna see me, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I flunked out of trade school.
LEADMALE:She's not thinking about that right now.
LEADFEMALE:She's been miserable for the last two days without you.
SUPFEMALE:No, she hasn't.
SUPFEMALE:She's hurtin' every bit as bad as you are.
SUPMALE:Two remotes? Cool.
SUPMALE:Look, i'm not coming back, dan.
SUPMALE:Besides, i know mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner's real glad that i'm gone.
LEADFEMALE:She's probably waiting with a shotgun in case i come back.
SUPFEMALE:Mark, please, that thing isn't loaded.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
SUPMALE:I can't go back and tell my wife i failed.
SUPFEMALE:Wanna order a pizza? Number 3 on the speed dial.
LEADMALE:Excellent! So.
SUPMALE:Did anybody call? No, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Mark hasn't called.
LEADFEMALE:See, that just proves what a jerk he is.
LEADMALE:He's been gone for three whole days and he doesn't even call her to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:That kind of thing isn't easy for a guy like mark.
LEADFEMALE:He could get somebody to dial the phone for him.
OTHERMALE:Hi, dad.
LEADMALE:Hey, beck.
SUPFEMALE:So, becky, do you want some donuts? I got tons of 'em.
LEADMALE:This car hit the bloodmobile and there were donuts everywhere it was just awful.
LEADFEMALE:I got all kinds here.
LEADMALE:I got the chocolate twisty kind, lemon squirty kind, and the ones that look like feet.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I got half a plain one over here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Cheer up, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You suck! What? Using my own damn donuts against me.
LEADMALE:What am i supposed to do? She's hurtin' because her husband's gone.
LEADFEMALE:If you really want to be a good dad, why don't you tell her how lucky she is that that creep walked out on her now instead of years from now when she has a ton of his creepy little kids.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to be a good dad.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna be a popular dad.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Is roseanne doing any better? A little.
LEADMALE:She's out of her coma now and can understand words.
LEADMALE:Yeah, she's doing a little better.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:It's dan the one that should feel lousy.
LEADMALE:It's all his fault.
SUPMALE:How is this my fault! ha! Because mark is a butthead and girls always marry their fathers.
LEADMALE:You know, from talking to mark, it didn't sound like it was my fault.
LEADMALE:He's afraid to come home because of you.
LEADMALE:Me? did you tell him how stupid that was? did you defend me? I was there to listen.
LEADFEMALE:I think mark has a point.
SUPMALE:You weren't very nice to him.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? I was a total saint.
SUPMALE:You made constant fun of him, called him names, put him down, hid his keys.
LEADFEMALE:Once i hid his keys and that was a joke.
LEADFEMALE:He never found 'em! Well, you laughed.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to be the bad guy.
LEADMALE:You're not the bad guy.
SUPMALE:She's not mad at you, she's just mad at the world.
LEADMALE:How come she only takes it out on me, then? why doesn't she go get a job at the post office? Hey, jackie.
SUPMALE:Hi, beck.
LEADMALE:Becky, you really should eat more than half a donut.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine, mother.
SUPMALE:A lot of good ones in here.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, jackie.
OTHERMALE:I don't care what the two of you say, i don't think she's acting like a great big spoiled brat.
SUPFEMALE:Come in.
SUPMALE:Um, i'm looking for mark healy.
LEADFEMALE:He's out.
OTHERMALE:He'll be back in a minute.
SUPMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPMALE:Well, um i'm roseanne, dan's wife.
OTHERFEMALE:I think he was over here to play earlier.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I'm royal.
LEADFEMALE:You can call me roy or al.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i think i'll pick roy.
SUPFEMALE:Most chicks do.
SUPMALE:Well, this may just be a stab in the dark, roy, but i'm bettin' that you're not married.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you know? Well, because when i was younger and single, every single guy i dated that didn't live at home lived here.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, i think this is dan's old couch.
LEADMALE:You wanna sit down? Yeah, thanks.
LEADMALE:Is there some place that i could boil this first? That's just beer.
SUPMALE:It's gotta be dry by now.
LEADMALE:You want something to drink? Yeah, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I think a big tumbler of penicillin would really hit the spot right now.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, is that a soap opera? Yeah, with a satellite dish we get shows from all over the world.
LEADMALE:This one's called "dos mujeres, un camino.
LEADMALE:" so that's what happened to that guy from chips.
OTHERFEMALE:" he's way better in this.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, beavis.
OTHERMALE:Butthead's home.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? Oh, i just came by to clear up some stuff.
SUPMALE:We got nothing to talk about.
SUPMALE:Oh, but i'm afraid we do, mark.
SUPMALE:You see, i'm really sick and tired of everybody thinking that i'm some evil woman that broke up your marriage.
OTHERMALE:I am not an evil woman.
SUPMALE:And i believe roy can back me up on that.
SUPMALE:She seems pretty cool to me.
LEADFEMALE:Roy, get outta here.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have to go and talk to becky.
SUPMALE:I already told mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner i can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have to, because she's gonna have to know that you left because of you and not because of me.
SUPMALE:This whole thing is your fault.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
SUPFEMALE:So what do you mean by that? You were right about me.
LEADMALE:I screwed everything up.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you did.
LEADMALE:And you shouldn't have taken our money to go to school when you weren't prepared to go all the way through with it.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to say? I know the school thing wasn't right for me.
OTHERMALE:I mean, i'm not a real smart guy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you say so, mark.
SUPMALE:I fix cars, bikes, things like that.
SUPMALE:I'm not like becky.
SUPMALE:She's the one that should be going to school here.
SUPMALE:Then so why did you go? Because she made me.
LEADMALE:It was all her idea.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to get a job and take care of becky, but i didn't even have the brains to do that.
OTHERFEMALE:God, would you stop calling yourself stupid? You're gonna wreck it for everybody else.
LEADMALE:I'm just trying to be honest.
SUPFEMALE:Becky deserved someone other than a total loser.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, now, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:You were the only one that was smart enough to know that you were gonna flunk out of school.
OTHERFEMALE:That's something.
OTHERFEMALE:Huh? Thanks.
SUPMALE:Okay, i guess you're not the only one to blame for this whole mess.
SUPMALE:Maybe i shouldn't have pushed becky to push you so hard.
SUPMALE:There.
SUPFEMALE:Are you guys okay? 'cause spanish jeopardy is gonna be on in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we're cool.
LEADFEMALE:So does this mean you're gonna get back together with darlene? God, you're looking smarter every second, mark.
LEADMALE:I'm not married to darlene, i'm married to becky.
LEADMALE:Oh, then darlene's the one that lives with your brother in chicago? what? He didn't mean that.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't mean darlene.
SUPFEMALE:He meant, uh, d.j. yeah.
LEADMALE:David is in chicago? so how long have they been living together? what the hell am i asking you for? He's been up there ever since he left you.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe that they would do this to me! Wait, wait.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's just go up to chicago.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you wanna take me to chicago? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm just trying to help.
LEADMALE:What makes you think i want to sit in a car with you for an hour and a half? 'cause i got $8 gas money.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, deej.
LEADFEMALE:How was the hockey game? Dull.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't split anybody's lip or anything.
SUPFEMALE:The important is, you tried.
LEADFEMALE:Now go shower up.
SUPFEMALE:Do i have to? You're darn close to having to take a bath in tomato juice.
LEADMALE:Hey, kiddo.
SUPMALE:I don't know where your mom's at.
SUPFEMALE:Looks like dad's making dinner.
LEADMALE:I was just gonna have something simple.
LEADFEMALE:Something simple? i won't have it! i'm making grilled cheese! So, any word from what's-his-face today? No.
LEADFEMALE:New subject, please.
SUPMALE:Fine, fine.
LEADFEMALE:We're not talking about it.
LEADFEMALE:My marriage is falling apart, dad.
LEADMALE:Mark doesn't even care.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure he cares.
LEADMALE:It's just-his pride is hurting.
LEADMALE:Well, i bet he's sitting around some pig sty surrounded by empty beer cans and pizza boxes.
LEADFEMALE:I bet he's just lovin' it.
LEADMALE:No, i don't think he's been married long enough to really, truly appreciate it.
OTHERMALE:I'm never gonna forgive mom for this.
LEADMALE:Becky, your mom's not what's keeping you guys apart.
SUPMALE:Well, mom's the reason that mark went back to school and flunked, and now he's never gonna face me again.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just go to him? I can't.
LEADMALE:Why, is he right? are you ashamed of him? No.
SUPFEMALE:It's just so weird i could fall in love with someone who could flunk out of trade school.
SUPMALE:Becky, if your husband flunked, you gotta figure out how much that bothers you.
LEADFEMALE:It bothers me.
LEADMALE:If that's the way you feel, maybe it's good he's gone.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
LEADFEMALE:Mark doesn't need someone looking down on him for the rest of his life.
OTHERFEMALE:Now that's a diet margarine, you gotta double up on that.
SUPMALE:After a real big fight, did mom ever come to you and say that she was completely wrong and that it was all her fault? When you've been married as long as your mom and me, it's not necessary to apologize.
LEADMALE:Apparently.
LEADMALE:Oh, we'd better hurry.
LEADFEMALE:I just know there's something on tv you haven't seen three times.
LEADMALE:Shut up, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You're not the only one that's unhappy here.
SUPFEMALE:At least you're not living with the meanest person alive.
LEADFEMALE:Screw you.
LEADMALE:You know what? You are truly horrible.
LEADFEMALE:You know that? I don't even love you anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have anything to say to that, do you? Just get out of my way.
SUPMALE:Hi, david.
SUPMALE:I found this pen.
OTHERFEMALE:Is it yours? Uh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'll be goin', then.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot to shred the crap out of you two.
SUPFEMALE:Mom-no, you're not talking.
LEADFEMALE:You're not talking for a very long time.
SUPFEMALE:And you better sit down, because this is gonna take a while.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, davo.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:You thought you had it all figured out, didn't you? You thought you were gonna live together and be the happy little couple and your parents were just too stupid to find out about it.
SUPMALE:You lied to me about christmas, you lied to me about thanksgiving.
SUPMALE:I wanted to come home for thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:I didn't keep you here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Stop trying to put the blame on me.
LEADMALE:You did what you wanted to do like always.
LEADFEMALE:What do you expect from me, david? i am the meanest person alive, remember? Hey, both of you.
SUPMALE:Me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one you're listening to, okay? I'm the one that you lied to and betrayed over and over and over.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't want to.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry if i made you lie.
LEADMALE:Don't touch me.
OTHERMALE:God, darlene, can't i do anything right? Hello! There's a shredding going on here and i came a very long way to do this.
LEADMALE:I don't want any argument from you, darlene.
LEADMALE:David, you're coming home with me right now.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
LEADMALE:End of story.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:You're doing me a favor.
SUPMALE:No, i'm not doing you a favor.
LEADMALE:You're not enjoying this.
LEADMALE:This is something very painful that i'm doing to you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i got it.
OTHERMALE:You have no idea how many phone calls, discussions, weekends at home and lectures it's gonna take before you and me are square again.
LEADMALE:All right, i'm sorry, mom.
LEADFEMALE:David, i threw all your stuff outside.
LEADFEMALE:So you guys get the suitcases and you grab a flashlight and we'll go see what we can find.
SUPMALE:So, how's it goin'? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Plus all the laundry, plus the dishes, plus giving birth and every other chore i hate to do around this house.
LEADFEMALE:Were the hell have you been? and what are you doing here? and what are you doing with them? And--that's it.
LEADMALE:I'm out of questions.
SUPFEMALE:Let me get the rest of your stuff.
LEADMALE:Dan, i'd like to talk to you in the other room.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:Changing rooms.
SUPMALE:This can't be good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay.
LEADFEMALE:I got this call from david today and him and his mother are not getting along at all, so he calls me from this bus station in rockford.
SUPMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:We were afraid of this.
SUPMALE:Poor kid.
LEADMALE:Is he okay? Yeah, he's fine.
LEADFEMALE:He just needs to be here for a while.
OTHERFEMALE:I gotta hand it to you.
OTHERFEMALE:You had a feeling this was gonna happen.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing gets by me.
LEADFEMALE:David.
OTHERMALE:Yes, sir? Um, look.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I really am.
SUPMALE:I'm glad you're back.
LEADMALE:We missed you.
LEADMALE:I told him and he went insane.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
SUPFEMALE:Nah.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't tell him.
SUPMALE:If you're gonna have a fighting chance with him, you're gonna need me on your side, and for that, i'm going to need plenty of sleep.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, you know i have been known to talk in my sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes, dan walks in his sleep.
OTHERMALE:But rest well, david.
OTHERMALE:Well, i guess i'll, uh, get going too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't you wanna talk to becky? Nah, she's probably asleep.
LEADFEMALE:She's probably not asleep.
OTHERMALE:Becky! come down here! Look, i don't know if i can see her right now.
LEADMALE:I mean, how do i look? Like every mother's nightmare.
LEADMALE:She'll love you.
LEADFEMALE:Look who dropped in.
LEADFEMALE:And, um, i think he wants to talk to you, don't you, mark? Yeah.
LEADMALE:And i'm sure that you would really love to listen.
SUPFEMALE:And this just happens to be a really good listening spot.
LEADMALE:This is where dan sits and does most of his listening.
SUPMALE:You wanna? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Are you coming to bed? Shh, shh, shh.
LEADMALE:What? are they talking? Yeah, and maybe if mark doesn't say too much, they can patch things up.
SUPMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:What, i thought you wanted them to get back together.
LEADMALE:Oh, i do, i just don't have any excuse to go over to roy's now.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:All right, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, i finished moppin' the bathroom.
LEADMALE:Well, i'd check your work, but i don't feel like movin'.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
SUPMALE:Why don't you just clean from here to there.
LEADMALE:Where are you pointing? The horizon.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you caught me at darlene's, you've been working me like a dog.
LEADFEMALE:And the beauty of being a working dog is that you don't get put to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:You know, all this punishment isn't teachin' me a thing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Well, maybe you could learn a lesson if i would tell the big, strong, fiercely protective mr.
SUPMALE:Conner that you were shacking up with his daughter.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, how's my big, strong, fiercely protective husband? Exhausted.
LEADMALE:But you'd still kill for me, right? Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Scrub brush.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll start here.
LEADMALE:David, this new obsession of yours with housework concerns me.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner's always said that a clean house is the devil's playground.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, that's true, but david feels, and i must agree, that cleaning is the least he can do for us after us taking him back after running away to live with-my mom.
SUPMALE:In michigan.
LEADFEMALE:You remember.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:I know you probably had to do this kind of stuff to make your mom happy, but there's nobody here to be scared of.
SUPMALE:Take the rest of the day off.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:David! When you clean out the refrigerator, don't throw away the moldy buns.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. thinks it's chia bread.
LEADFEMALE:You heard mr.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:He said take the rest of the day off.
LEADFEMALE:Well, isn't that funny? I thought he said, "if anybody has been messing around "with my daughter, i'm going to crush him like a beer can.
LEADFEMALE:" david, i'm done with this page.
SUPMALE:Hey, david, remember in chicago when i caught you in darlene's bathroom? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Remember how you gave me that money so i wouldn't tell anyone? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I want more.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't got any more.
LEADMALE:Well, you better get more quick, or i'll tell dad.
SUPMALE:D.j. , do you know what you're doing? You're--you're blackmailing me.
LEADMALE:That's not nice.
OTHERFEMALE:So? All right, look.
OTHERMALE:If you tell your dad about me, i'll tell your mom that you knew about darlene and me since christmas and didn't tell her.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:I care, i care! Yes, david? uhis this shiny enough to blind you? It'll do.
OTHERMALE:But, gee, the carpet looks old.
LEADMALE:Make it look new again.
SUPMALE:I don't think-oh, don't tell me how you're gonna do it.
SUPFEMALE:Just surprise me.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, becky.
LEADMALE:Uh, tell mark thanks for fixin' that blender for me.
LEADMALE:Boy, i should've known that he'd know right what to do, you know, since it's like a miniature truck motor.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, it was no problem for him, seeing as he's a really, really good mechanic.
LEADMALE:Right, dad? Yeah, the list goes me, mark, goober pyle.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm glad to hear that, 'cause mom said you have an opening down at the garage and that mark could probably get it.
LEADMALE:Is that true? why did you tell her that? Well, we were just you knowsittin' around talkin' about trucks and garages.
LEADMALE:You know, girl talk, and it just came up.
LEADFEMALE:Is it true? It's true.
LEADMALE:Except for the part about mark gettin' the job.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, no.
LEADMALE:Well, why not, dan? You used to work with him.
SUPFEMALE:You think he's a good mechanic.
SUPMALE:Look, most guys work for the city a year before they start hirin' all their relatives.
SUPFEMALE:It won't look right if i jump the gun.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Then we'll never have any money and we'll just live here forever! you can put away your own damn groceries, dad! Thanks for turnin' my daughter against me, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually, i had you all set up to be the big hero, but you had to spoil it with that "no" business.
LEADFEMALE:It would've been nice of you to run this little idea by me before tellin' it to mark and becky.
SUPMALE:Dan, have you never heard of the element of surprise? From now on, i want to know what's goin' on in this house before it blows up in my face.
LEADMALE:No more secrets.
LEADMALE:Understood? Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, i'm gonna attack that mildew problem now.
LEADMALE:Well, david, mr.
SUPMALE:Conner says that we are not to have any more secrets in this house.
SUPMALE:Really.
SUPMALE:I'm afraid so.
LEADFEMALE:Dan we have a mildew problem.
SUPFEMALE:Is jackie around? Yeah.
LEADMALE:She must be out in the back.
SUPMALE:You got the goods? I'm sick of havi'' to trick jackie like this.
LEADFEMALE:I shouldn't have to support my baby by sneakin' money into a tip jar.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i told you if you write a check, she's gonna catch on.
SUPMALE:Hey, jackie! Fred.
LEADMALE:How you feeli'' today? Lovelyfred.
LEADFEMALE:If i could do a backbend, i'd be a camel.
SUPFEMALE:Wow! look at all my tips! Umno, those are jackie's tips.
SUPFEMALE:No, they're not.
LEADFEMALE:She got nauseous, and i took over her table.
OTHERMALE:I knew this pushup bra would bring in the extra dough.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:This guy came in yesterday and says he forgot to tip the waitress with the real breasts.
LEADFEMALE:So $15 of that is jackie's.
SUPMALE:Remember, nancy? Ohright! That guy from yesterday.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, you--oh, the man with the glasses who kept drinkin' coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
OTHERMALE:He really liked you.
SUPMALE:There was no man.
LEADMALE:Where's this money comin' from? You don't have any money.
LEADMALE:And you don't know what's goin' on.
SUPFEMALE:Damn it, fred.
SUPMALE:Well, you wouldn't take any money directly from me, so roseanne's been putting it in the tip jar.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not all of it.
OTHERFEMALE:I took some.
LEADFEMALE:I mean you have your pride, jackie.
OTHERMALE:Well, fred, it's not your baby.
SUPMALE:It's mine.
SUPMALE:What makes you think you have any say in how i raise my child? I just want to be involved with this baby.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't you let me help? you want to help? Quit pressuring me.
LEADMALE:Quit tryin' to butt in.
OTHERFEMALE:Just leave me the hell alone.
SUPMALE:God, jackie.
SUPMALE:Well, how many times do i have to tell him?! I think that'll be the last.
LEADMALE:Well, that was really stupid.
LEADMALE:No, it wasn't.
SUPFEMALE:As far as i'm concerned, kids grow up fine as long as they have one decent parent.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, man.
SUPMALE:Would you please stop quoting that murphy brown? I wanna go over to easy miller's house.
SUPFEMALE:No, not till you clean your room.
LEADMALE:Well, you wouldn't want me to tell dad about what's goin' on around here, would you? Oh, no, d.j. now that you have all this information, you have all the power and i have nothing.
SUPMALE:I guess you'll be ruling the roost around here from now on.
LEADMALE:Whatever will i do? All right, i'll clean my room! Hey, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, david! How's my favorite almost son? Mmhh.
OTHERMALE:I can't take this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what, he barely touched you.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta tell him.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, we all live our lives by certain rules, and i like to believe that nothing bad can happen to me as long as i tell the truth.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:How did your mother raise you? David! Hey, mr.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:David, can't you see mr.
LEADMALE:Conner is busy watchi'' the news? can i talk to you? Just a sec.
LEADMALE:David, um, that's our best china soaking in there, and if it soaks too long, the pattern will come off.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:I have to do this.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, you don't know this, but i was in chicago.
OTHERMALE:Ohand he went to a cubs game, and it was the most boring story i've ever heard.
SUPMALE:Blah, blah, blah, blah.
SUPFEMALE:Go do the dishes, david.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, when i was gone, i wasn't living with my mom.
OTHERMALE:I was livin' with darlene.
LEADFEMALE:It was a stupid thing to do, and i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Very sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh, god, i'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:You lyin' little bastard! You got 20 minutes to pack up your crap and get outta my house.
OTHERMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner will drive you to the bus station.
LEADMALE:I don't want to look at you.
LEADMALE:God! you believe this, roseanne?! No.
SUPMALE:I was stunned when i first heard.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean, when you first heard? You know justnow.
LEADMALE:And, uhoh, man, now i'm kind of in shock.
LEADMALE:You take a kid into your house, and this is how he pays you back? I bet i know why he's been doin' all those chores around here.
LEADMALE:He's got a guilty conscience.
SUPFEMALE:I never want to see the kid again.
LEADMALE:Damn! Great.
LEADMALE:He wrecks the place right after he fires my maid.
LEADMALE:Anybody home? I'm in the nursery.
LEADMALE:Hi, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:You want any help with that crib? Oh, yeah, right, like, you came all the way down here to talk about this crib.
SUPMALE:This is so obvious.
OTHERMALE:Crib, baby, fred.
OTHERMALE:You wanna talk about fred.
LEADFEMALE:No, i don't want to talk about fred.
OTHERMALE:See? There.
LEADMALE:You just brought him up again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what can i say? I'm obsessed.
LEADMALE:Look, i don't feel bad about what happened.
LEADFEMALE:It's better now.
SUPMALE:He knows where he stands, and that's that.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i got bigger problems to talk to you about than whether or not you made fred cry.
SUPFEMALE:I made fred cry? Let's not talk about him! Fred is a grownup.
SUPFEMALE:He can take care of himself.
LEADFEMALE:He's not some teenager like poor david.
LEADMALE:Why? what happened to david? Dan found out he was livin' with darlene in chicago, and he kicked him outta the house.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:Where is he now? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:He could be anywhere livin' on the street eatin' out of a dumpster.
LEADMALE:Standing in your hall.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, no.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:He cannot stay here.
OTHERMALE:I can't deal with that now.
LEADMALE:Please.
OTHERMALE:Just tell david i'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do that, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll just crush him.
SUPMALE:You tell him.
LEADFEMALE:David! Hey, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, david.
LEADFEMALE:You don't want me to stay, huh? It's not that i don't want you living here, david, because i do.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that i'm not even allowed to have a cat here, let alone a boy.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, you own this house.
LEADMALE:I know that.
LEADFEMALE:These are my rules.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, it's all right.
SUPFEMALE:Look, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, i really think i should just get on a bus back to my mom's.
LEADMALE:Ohgod.
OTHERMALE:How would he-how long would he have to stay? Not too long at all.
LEADMALE:I think it'll only take me a couple of days to make, you know, dan feel guilty enough to take him back.
LEADFEMALE:Two years at the most.
OTHERFEMALE:We're just pretending like i have a choice here, right? Right.
OTHERMALE:All right, david, get your stuff.
SUPMALE:You can sleep here.
SUPMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:I knew it.
SUPMALE:I knew that if i brought him over here and you saw his little puppy-dog face that you could not turn him away.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess you know me pretty well.
SUPMALE:Got another surprise for you.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, come here! Made you look, made you look i finished puttin' the crib together.
LEADMALE:So, uhi'll get started on this drawer tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Sogood night.
OTHERMALE:David.
LEADMALE:Do you think of me as a mean person? you? No.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're letting me stay here and everything.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're really nice.
LEADMALE:Well, you're wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a horrible, horrible woman.
SUPMALE:The worst.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even think i have a heart.
LEADFEMALE:I'm like the tin man, all hollow inside.
LEADFEMALE:See, i--i'm not sure what to say.
OTHERFEMALE:Usually when darlene says somethin' like that, it's a trick.
LEADMALE:It's been three days, david.
LEADFEMALE:Fred hasn't come by the diner.
OTHERMALE:He hasn't called.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanted him gone, but not like this.
LEADMALE:He's probably sitting at home crying still.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:It's different for guys.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, darlene used to say mean stuff to me all the time, and i never took it personally or anything.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:And now that we broke up, it's a good thing.
SUPFEMALE:You know? I mean, i'm-i'm even starting to think about seeing other people.
SUPMALE:You are? Yeah.
LEADMALE:In fact, i've got a couple of girls lined up already.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well that's good.
LEADFEMALE:That makes me feel a lot better.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i'm doin' much better now.
LEADMALE:Here you're starting to see other people, andfred's a swinging single, andlook at me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just a wall a wall of baby.
LEADFEMALE:Who could love this? Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:Lots of people.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:I mean, sure, you're-you're big and all, but that doesn't mean you're not still great to be around and really funny and just beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Oh you mean that? I do.
OTHERMALE:Honest.
LEADMALE:Oh, david.
LEADMALE:Look at you.
OTHERMALE:Youbroke up with your girlfriend and dan kicked you outta the house, and you're tryin' to cheer me up.
OTHERMALE:You're really special.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think we should be doin' this.
SUPFEMALE:What? I mean, don't get me wrong.
LEADFEMALE:It--it's not that i'm not attracted to you.
SUPFEMALE:I--i am.
SUPMALE:But i'm still really confused about darlene, and i think it would just kinda be a mistake if weyou know? What?! Oh, god.
LEADMALE:You and me? are you serious, david? You're just a little child! Oh, god, that hurts.
LEADMALE:Oh, david, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You really know how to pick a girl up out of the doldrums.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you'd like that.
SUPMALE:Sorry i'm late.
OTHERFEMALE:I stopped at the market to pick up some groceries.
SUPFEMALE:Got ice cream, cookies, candy.
SUPMALE:Dan, did it ever occur to you that we shop like our parents are gone for the weekend? Welli still haven't heard a thing from david.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez, tell a guy to get the hell out and never come back, and this is how he treats ya.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i know you did the right thing, dan.
LEADMALE:I'm just glad that you were the one that made the decision.
LEADFEMALE:I--i just never could live with myself after i heard the stuff his mom says to him.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, we had no choice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i know that.
LEADMALE:I'm just sayin' i couldn't have done it.
OTHERMALE:He's a big kid.
LEADMALE:He can take care of himself.
SUPFEMALE:Now, i don't want to hear another word about it.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:I--i won't bring him up again.
OTHERFEMALE:David! i mean, dinner! Need any help, mom? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Let me do it.
LEADMALE:You've been serving people all day.
OTHERMALE:I've only been doin' it for 25 years.
LEADMALE:Gee, i miss david.
LEADFEMALE:Well, d.j. , your father and i have made a decision, now, and we are gonna stick with it.
LEADMALE:David did a very bad thing, and we do not need anybody second-guessing the extreme severity of his punishment.
LEADFEMALE:If i do something really bad, does that mean you'll get rid of me, too? d.j. , is that the message we're sending you? what's the matter? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I just don't feel like eatin'.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, dan, don't tell me you're startin' to feel guilty.
OTHERMALE:No, roseanne, i'm not.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just not hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Well, god, dan, don't be so defensive! i said, "if you're feelin' guilty," then there is still time to do somethin' about it! Yeah, you're right.
LEADMALE:Of course i'm right, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you know who i am? Mark, if you're still interested in that job at the garage, it's yours.
LEADMALE:What? are you--are you serious, dan? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I figure it'll be okay as long as you don't ask for any special favors.
LEADMALE:You start tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Come in about noon, 1:00, whenever you feel like it.
LEADMALE:Thanks, dad! Hey.
SUPMALE:Feel better already.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the guilt thing really worked.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i really know how to make things happen around here.
LEADMALE:Every time i look at david's empty chair, feels like our whole-ahh, can it.
LEADFEMALE:Ms.
LEADMALE:Harris, what are you doin'? have you got a light? No.
SUPFEMALE:David, what do you think of me? what do you mean? Well, you've known me for quite a few years now.
OTHERFEMALE:You must've formed some opinion of me.
OTHERMALE:Welli think you're a very nice person.
LEADMALE:Do you find me desirable? Sure.
SUPMALE:I think you're the most attractive of all darlene's aunts.
LEADMALE:What are you drinking? bourbon? Ms.
SUPFEMALE:Harris, you're tryin' to seduce me.
LEADMALE:Aren't you? God.
SUPFEMALE:David, we've been through this before! You're just a child! 
OTHERMALE:
OTHERMALE:Is darlene here yet? you don't see her washing my feet with her hair, do you? God, mom, i really hope you're not gonna be too hard on her.
LEADFEMALE:You know i am more than fair, becky.
OTHERMALE:Now, uhcan you think of a punishment that starts with "x"? She lived with her boyfriend 'cause she was in love with him.
SUPMALE:Think back to when you were young.
LEADMALE:You know, becky, if you're feeling left out, mommy has enough anger for all her children.
LEADMALE:Excavate garden.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a punishment that begins with "x.
LEADMALE:" yard work.
LEADFEMALE:Zoo with d.j. i'm done.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think dad's gonna do when he sees her? Oh, becky, your father is a reasonable man.
LEADMALE:I figure he'll sit with her and have a nice long talk.
SUPMALE:Of course, she won't listen, what with being dead and all.
LEADMALE:I have had it, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I can't keep hiding david at my house.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's been, like, a week.
LEADMALE:I can't take care of him anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Luckily, those maternal instincts are kicking in in the nick of time.
LEADFEMALE:Have you told dan about david yet? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Really? what did he say? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean the truth? No.
LEADMALE:It's starting to get very uncomfortable.
LEADMALE:Last night, he thought i tried to seduce him.
SUPMALE:Well, it was kind of funny.
OTHERFEMALE:I just gave him a hug 'cause he said something sweet, and boom, now he thinks i want him.
LEADFEMALE:That is so funny.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, who'd want to go to bed with some big old fat lady? I got to go talk to mark.
SUPMALE:Anyway, david's acting really weird now.
LEADFEMALE:He hasn't showered in three days 'cause he's afraid i'll walk in on him.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Well, hello, darlene! Gosh, it's just so wonderful to have you home, especially when you're in really, really big trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm home.
SUPFEMALE:Now what? Oh, gee, let's see.
SUPMALE:It has been so long since i punished you, i wonder if i even remember how.
LEADMALE:You're grounded.
LEADFEMALE:There! Yeah, it's just like riding a bike.
LEADFEMALE:You can't ground me.
SUPMALE:I don't even live here anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:The only reason i came home is because you said we could talk to dad about david.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he's, like, really unhappy.
SUPFEMALE:David is just fine.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about him.
LEADMALE:He's just a little shook because aunt jackie put the moves on him.
SUPFEMALE:I did not.
SUPFEMALE:Who'd want to sleep with some big old fat lady? David's got to come back here.
LEADMALE:If you won't talk to dad, i'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think this would be the right time with the mood your dad's in.
SUPFEMALE:Let's face it: you need my help.
LEADMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you are twisted.
LEADMALE:Do you think i take joy in punishing my children? Yes, i do.
SUPFEMALE:See, jackie? You must always let the child know why they're being punished.
LEADFEMALE:Damn snow plow blocked the driveway again! Oh, god.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:We won't let you live hooked up to machines.
SUPFEMALE:Did you see that son of-hi, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, sport.
SUPMALE:Great to see ya.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you, too.
SUPFEMALE:What do you say we go get a sundae? really? Oh, okay.
OTHERMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:What the hell were you doing there? don't you know what's been going on for the last three months? We don't get to see her very often.
SUPMALE:She's still one of our kids.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, but you are being really nice to her like she's a total stranger.
LEADMALE:She's never gonna come home if every time she does it's miserable.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? I do! Come on in, darlene.
SUPMALE:I'll put the game on.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i'll be there in a sec, daddy.
LEADMALE:We went sledding.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's great that you're home.
LEADMALE:Now you can do the dishes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I think there's even a few more.
LEADMALE:Dad, mom wants me to do the dishes.
LEADMALE:Don't be silly! come watch the game! Hey, you.
SUPMALE:Get over here and do the dishes.
LEADMALE:Takes it all the way along the base line-what? what is it? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:It's just have you been working out lately? Nah.
SUPMALE:Well, not in a program.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you're looking pretty buff there, dad.
LEADMALE:Ah, quit it.
LEADFEMALE:So how's life? Well, school is okay.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:You know, i'm kind of lonely since david left.
LEADMALE:I mean, which is really weird 'cause i hated having him there.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad.
LEADMALE:I talked to him-i mean, in michigan.
LEADMALE:H-he's not too happy.
LEADMALE:He's really sorry, you know? We're both really sorry that we lied to you.
LEADMALE:Well, it's over.
LEADMALE:It's time to move on.
LEADMALE:Dad, can david move back in the house? No.
LEADMALE:You can't let him live with his mom.
LEADFEMALE:I said no, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:The boy's done enough damage.
LEADMALE:And i don't care how horrible his mother is.
LEADFEMALE:He's not an infant! but, dad-the boy's not coming back to this house, and that's final! Okay.
SUPMALE:I need you.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:What was that? I didn't quite hear what you just said.
LEADFEMALE:Uh i-i'm a horrible, ungrateful daughter.
LEADMALE:You're all-powerful and all-knowing, and i'm nothing but dirt at your feet.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, oh, please have mercy on me o great one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i know, david, but i can't sneak out until everybody goes to sleep.
LEADMALE:Hey, you're not supposed to be on the phone! you're grounded! It's nobody, david.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that little kid we're growing in case one of us needs an organ.
LEADFEMALE:You're talking to david.
SUPMALE:Man, are you in trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, yeah, i got to go.
SUPFEMALE:I got to use the phone cord for something else.
LEADFEMALE:Here, i found these in my room.
SUPMALE:It's gonna take some pretty good scrubbing to get all the cheese off.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's gonna take some pretty good scrubbing to get all your skin off, but, uh, i got time.
SUPMALE:You can't do anything to me, 'cause you're in too much trouble.
SUPMALE:Hey, d.j. , how would you like a second plate in your head? Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, you're up.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Oh, i was just getting my jacket because, uh, the basement's cold.
LEADMALE:You don't have to do that.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just turn the heat up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right, of course.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i keep it down because it enhances the youthfulness of one's complexion.
LEADMALE:Plus it keeps my beer cold.
LEADMALE:All right, well, thanks.
LEADMALE:Then i guess i'll turn in.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, darlene, i'm sorry i yelled at you earlier.
LEADFEMALE:I know the whole thing with david wasn't your fault.
LEADMALE:Yeah, okay.
LEADMALE:As far as i'm concerned, the whole matter's behind us.
LEADFEMALE:It's as if the whole thing never existed.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Tell that to my baby.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, dad.
LEADMALE:I've been waiting in the park for hours.
LEADMALE:Get your coat.
LEADFEMALE:Meet me out front.
SUPMALE:I can't get past my dad.
OTHERMALE:There's an f troop marathon on.
SUPMALE:Well, i can't come in 'cause your mom said i wasn't allowed in the house.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:We're not supposed to be speaking, either.
SUPFEMALE:See ya.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll come in.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Things sure are a mess, huh? Well, you give a decorator complete control, and i meant us.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I miss this room.
LEADMALE:I miss you.
SUPFEMALE:I still love you, darlene.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:So what'll we do? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene, i brought you an ex-mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Connor, i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
SUPMALE:Shut up! Dad-what's the matter, boy? can't keep your pants on? Dad, stop it.
OTHERFEMALE:I made him-i'm not talking to you, darlene! Yeah.
SUPMALE:I can fight my own battles.
SUPFEMALE:David, just go back to jackie's.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Jackie's? I thought he was staying with his mother.
LEADFEMALE:Later, mrs.
OTHERMALE:Connor.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell's going on? yeah, what the hell is going on? You told me you sent david away, and this whole time, he's been staying at your sister's.
LEADMALE:Uh well, yeah, i did send him away.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, but, you know, then jackie got involved, and, uh dan, didn't we say we would never raise our voices in front of the kids? after everything that boy's done, you've been helping him out? No, i haven't been helping him out.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, dan.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm--i'm just soft.
LEADMALE:Oh, i can't handle this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:No, you're not going anyplace.
SUPMALE:You're grounded.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Now, i'm grounded for lying to you guys about living with david, right? Right.
LEADMALE:Just like you lied to dad and said that you didn't know that i was living with him in chicago, even though you did, right? excuse me? Oh, you are in so much trouble now.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, the--ratting out your own mother-there's just, like-there's just nothing lower than that.
SUPMALE:I mean, am i right, dan? is that, like-ratting out your mom, that's got to be the worst, right? I'm going to jackie's.
SUPMALE:What are we gonna do with her? you mean you knew the whole time? No! I didn't-no, i didn't know the whole time, no.
SUPMALE:No, of course i-you know, just for, like-okay, the--you know, uh, like, the last couple of days, when i went up there, you know, uh, and i dragged david home, and i put an end to it all by myself.
LEADMALE:I handled it all by myself, dan, because i just didn't want to get you upset.
SUPMALE:I took all that stress on myself, and--and, uh--of course, now that you're on board, i--i'm feeling a lot of relief, dan.
LEADMALE:Dan? oh, well well, isn't this nice? What a great aunt you are, making them just so comfortable.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you tack up the bathroom mirror on the ceiling? Because, mom, then when we do it in the bathroom, we won't be able to watch.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you're not helping.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you take your butt home right now.
LEADMALE:I'm not going back to that house just so you can torture me.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong.
LEADFEMALE:That is exactly why you're going back there.
SUPFEMALE:You're in big trouble, and your punishment is not gonna be sex with your boyfriend well, obviously, you've never had sex with my boyfriend.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, it's a good thing i'm not living with my abusive mother.
SUPMALE:Well, that's better.
LEADFEMALE:Now it's just us three girls.
OTHERFEMALE:I will be in the kitchen making sure that david doesn't disturb us.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, i don't need you to punish me.
LEADMALE:Huh.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you do.
LEADMALE:I'm your mother, and it's my job to correct you when you make a mistake.
LEADMALE:But i know living with david was a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:It was miserable.
LEADFEMALE:No punishment you could give me could make me feel any worse.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so it'll be a challenge.
LEADFEMALE:You don't get it.
OTHERFEMALE:I learned my lesson.
LEADFEMALE:David and i were not ready to live together.
LEADMALE:You know? I know that now, and i learned it on my own.
SUPMALE:Wasn't that just great? I'm so proud of you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:And lesson number 2 is what? uh always share? No.
LEADFEMALE:It's you don't treat your mother like crap.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you lied to me constantly for three months, okay? It's gonna take a lot of work before you and me are square again.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, fine.
LEADMALE:I'll do the dishes.
OTHERMALE:I'll clean the house.
SUPFEMALE:I'll do the whole alphabet.
LEADFEMALE:But i'm not going home while dad is acting like a psychopathic lunatic.
SUPMALE:Oh, darlene, your father is a reasonable man.
LEADFEMALE:You just give him enough time, and he'll get over it.
SUPMALE:So, uh you want to watch a movie on tv or something? I got to kill a couple of hours before i can go back.
OTHERMALE:Hey, dan? ready to go? Just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Looks like somebody's been riding the couch.
SUPMALE:Hey, this was my choice, so it's not embarrassing.
LEADMALE:Dan, this is between you and roseanne, okay? I don't want to get involved.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, pal, you're already involved.
OTHERMALE:You got her sister pregnant, and if i was you, i'd sue for custody now, 'cause by the time the kid's 17, you won't have any claim on him at all.
SUPMALE:A custody suit? Damn women.
LEADFEMALE:Who the hell do they think they are? We're sugar and spice and everything nice, so bite me.
SUPMALE:Hey, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Why, hello, fred.
LEADMALE:I think i shall be the one taking dan to work today.
LEADFEMALE:I think fred should.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, i'm sorry, but i got to agree with roseanne here.
OTHERMALE:With you, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:On second thought i might just like to walk to work today.
LEADMALE:Oh, you don't even like to walk to the car.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have any idea how this discussion is supposed to begin? You're supposed to apologize.
OTHERFEMALE:You lied to me.
SUPMALE:Well, it's not like i feel good about it.
LEADMALE:I mean, you found out.
OTHERFEMALE:The whole thing would have never happened if you hadn't have brought david into this house.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell were you thinking? I wanted him to live here.
LEADFEMALE:I still do.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Well, maybe because i still think he's a good kid.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, you know? He's handy to have around the house.
OTHERFEMALE:You never know if i'm gonna need something on the low shelf.
LEADFEMALE:What is with you? why are you taking david's side? Well, somebody has to.
SUPMALE:God, dan, you're blaming the whole thing in chicago on david.
LEADFEMALE:Well, darlene was there, too, you know.
LEADMALE:It's not like david forced her to hide him out there.
LEADFEMALE:All i know is before david came along, darlene was not the kind of kid who would move in with her teenage boyfriend.
LEADMALE:Before david came around, darlene was 12.
SUPFEMALE:You know what i mean.
LEADMALE:The teenage boy, they can be very persuasive.
LEADFEMALE:Have you met darlene at all? you seen the control she has over david? I mean, david isn't even his real name.
LEADFEMALE:She just made that up.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you've been saying it for years.
SUPFEMALE:I'm finally gonna agree with you.
LEADFEMALE:Men are pigs.
LEADMALE:I mean, you were every bit as bull-headed as darlene was.
LEADFEMALE:I managed to persuade you.
LEADMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:You remember our second date? You were upset because you had this big fight with your mom.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't thinking about your feelings.
LEADFEMALE:I was thinking you were ripe for the picking.
LEADFEMALE:Show a little charm, pour a few drinks down her.
LEADMALE:Boom! We're at the blue rooster motel: cock-a-doodle-doo.
SUPMALE:My mom was in indiana.
LEADMALE:There was no fight.
LEADMALE:I just set the whole thing up so that you would be able to take advantage of me in my time of need.
SUPMALE:So you've been lying to me from the beginning.
LEADFEMALE:Face it, dan, i seduced you, and darlene may very well have seduced david, okay? So you can't keep blaming david for this whole thing.
LEADMALE:Darlene had sex because she wanted to have sex.
LEADMALE:I got to go to work.
LEADFEMALE:The fact that i had my nightgown in my purse should have tipped you off.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's me! Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't hear your car.
LEADFEMALE:Rode d.j. 's bike.
LEADFEMALE:May have to take it to the shop tomorrow.
SUPMALE:What can i do for you? No.
LEADFEMALE:Now, i shouldn't have to leave.
LEADMALE:This is my house.
LEADMALE:And since this is my house, i should offer you some coffee, which i will make in the kitchen, which is still in my house, so i'm not really leaving.
SUPFEMALE:Mom send you to get me? I didn't come to get you.
SUPMALE:I came to get david.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Wait, so you're, like, cool with this? No.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't blame david for everything anymore.
SUPMALE:You don't have the right to be mad at me for having sex.
LEADMALE:Did you expect me to be a virgin for the rest of my life? No.
SUPMALE:I expected you to be a nice kid.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not a kid anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I know that.
LEADMALE:I don't like it, but i know it.
SUPMALE:I also know you lied to me and your mother for the last three months.
LEADFEMALE:I had to.
LEADMALE:You guys would have freaked out.
LEADFEMALE:I had a good reason for everything that i did.
OTHERFEMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:You had your reasons.
LEADMALE:I just don't know if things between me and you will ever be the same.
LEADMALE:Well, why not? I mean, becky ran off and eloped with mark.
LEADFEMALE:You let her off the hook.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe i expected more out of you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, david.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Do you want to come home with me? for what? It's okay, david.
LEADFEMALE:He's offering to take you back.
SUPMALE:Really? Thank you, mr.
LEADMALE:Connor.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna go get my stuff.
SUPMALE:David, i'm glad you're coming back.
LEADMALE:But no more lying.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Look, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Connor, there's something i want to say to you.
OTHERMALE:Something that you should know.
SUPFEMALE:I really love your daughter, and you should realize that when she and i when wewhen we're having our tenderness-david, stop.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Darlene, i got you an extra-mr.
SUPMALE:Connor, i'm-shut up.
LEADMALE:Just shut up.
LEADMALE:Dad-what's the matter with you, boy? huh? can't you keep your pants on? Dad, i made him come in.
LEADMALE:Darlene, i'm not talking to you.
LEADMALE:I can fight my own battles.
OTHERMALE:David, just go back to jackie's.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie's? I thought he was staying with his mom.
SUPMALE:That method acting will get you in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:What are these for? Oh, they just hook them up and try to figure out which one of your nipples is negative and which one is positive.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, how we doing? Okay.
OTHERMALE:Good, i hope.
LEADMALE:Well, we'll take your first baby picture, if you just lay back here and lift up your blouse for me.
LEADMALE:Wow, just like your prom picture.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it tickles.
LEADMALE:It's gonna burn like hell in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Just kidding.
LEADMALE:Ew, look at your belly button.
LEADFEMALE:Ew, it's so weird.
LEADMALE:What happened? it's all would you like to see a picture of your baby, miss harris? my baby? Oh, it's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it? Looks just like you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's waving at me.
LEADFEMALE:I've had three of these, jackie.
SUPMALE:It's not waving at you.
LEADMALE:It's waving at me.
SUPFEMALE:It is beautiful.
LEADMALE:Look at the little feet! And the spine, and what's on its head? Looks like it's looks like it's wearing a little cap.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's what happened to the condom.
SUPFEMALE:Give me the remote.
LEADMALE:I'm not watching this.
SUPFEMALE:This is a commercial.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even know what i'm watching.
LEADFEMALE:I know it's something i'll hate.
SUPMALE:Not necessarily.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Figure skating.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:It's the finals.
SUPFEMALE:You know, big brothers are supposed to look out for their kid brothers.
LEADFEMALE:And, like, help them and do stuff with them.
LEADMALE:Well, i'd have done stuff with you, but you don't like to do guy stuff.
LEADMALE:I like to do guy stuff.
SUPMALE:Who says drawing isn't something guys do? Guys.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just as much of a man as you are.
LEADMALE:Then how come the only friend you ever had was a girl? Hey, darlene was a lot more like a guy when i first met her.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , who would you rather have for a big brother, me or mark? You.
SUPMALE:See? 'cause you can't beat me up like becky and darlene can.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, that's the last one.
SUPMALE:Want it back? No, it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Are those the x-ray pictures of aunt jackie's baby? No, they're pictures of your dad.
LEADMALE:He swallowed a doll.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know why all my friends think you're the fun mom.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of my way! d.j. , i'm sorry, it's just that i'm pregnant right now and i'm very upset-what am i talking to you for? Get out of my way! look at that, right now! Jackie, i know you've slept with a lot of men, but i don't need to know all their names.
LEADFEMALE:That is a legal document.
LEADMALE:Fred is suing me for custody of my baby! Oh, my god, you're kidding me.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's all right there.
SUPFEMALE:He wants my baby! It's not even born yet.
SUPFEMALE:He-he's suing me for custody of my stomach! Well, just calm down.
SUPMALE:Sit down here.
SUPFEMALE:We'll figure something out.
LEADMALE:I've already thought about it.
LEADFEMALE:I think i've come up with a plan that could really work.
OTHERFEMALE:First, we hire a hit man.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie! Just hear me out.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, we saw that woman on tv who hired that guy for $500.
LEADFEMALE:And the reason she was on tv was because she got caught.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta do something.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't care about this baby.
LEADMALE:He's just doing this to punish me because i won't go out with him.
SUPMALE:As far as i'm concerned, he's found a legal way to beat me up.
LEADMALE:Listen, jackie, i'm not gonna let this happen to you.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go, and i'll talk to him.
LEADMALE:Because deep down inside, you and me both know that fred is a decent guy.
OTHERMALE:A decent guy? A decent guy doesn't sue the mother of his child! there are no decent guys in this world! There never have been, there never will be.
LEADFEMALE:That is not true.
LEADMALE:There's dan.
OTHERFEMALE:And donahue.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Look at the way they all scatter back to work when the boss walks in.
OTHERMALE:You know, dan, i took your advice, and for the first time in months, i actually feel good about myself.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's a dandruff shampoo, but it keeps your hair manageable.
SUPFEMALE:No, i mean about suing jackie for custody.
OTHERFEMALE:What the hell are you talking about? I never told you that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yes, you did.
OTHERMALE:Remember last week, when roseanne was having that big fight with you, you were telling me how a man's gotta stand up for himself.
LEADMALE:That was different.
SUPMALE:I was sleeping on the couch.
OTHERMALE:I had nothing to lose! It made a lot of sense to me.
SUPFEMALE:So i talked to a lawyer.
LEADMALE:He said you're right to recommend suing.
SUPMALE:Would you stop saying that? Dan, you got nothing to be ashamed of.
SUPFEMALE:I'd be proud if it was my idea.
OTHERMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go with that.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i've tried everything else.
LEADMALE:I don't want this kid to grow up not knowing me.
LEADMALE:If it was your kid, wouldn't you do anything to be a part of their life? Well, not now.
SUPFEMALE:But maybe before they were born.
LEADMALE:So you're on my side.
LEADFEMALE:No! But i understand your side.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure jackie has a side too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan.
SUPMALE:Your wife's here.
SUPMALE:And here it comes now.
LEADMALE:I gotta get out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna sit this one out.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan? if she compliments my hair, can i tell her you did recommend the dandruff shampoo? fred? I want to talk to you now.
LEADMALE:Alone.
SUPMALE:I'm not through with my lunch yet.
LEADMALE:Well, you are now.
LEADFEMALE:Don't forget to brush.
LEADFEMALE:Save your breath, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:You're not gonna talk me into dropping this lawsuit.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe i can talk you into begging for your life.
OTHERMALE:Is dan in his office? No, he's not.
LEADFEMALE:We had a big crisis.
LEADFEMALE:Dan had to rush out and take care of it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? what, did somebody forget the crullers again? Now, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You can't-you wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, you cannot sue jackie.
LEADMALE:Before she went out with you, she went out with a whole bunch of really bad guys.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry about that, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:But why should i give a damn about her feelings if she doesn't even care about mine? you are not listening, okay? Her last boyfriend beat her up.
SUPMALE:Oh, god.
OTHERFEMALE:And it's not so easy to bounce back from something like that.
SUPMALE:You're not helping anything by suing her.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I feel awful about this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah, i knew you would, fred.
OTHERMALE:Now, listen.
LEADFEMALE:All's you gotta do is drop the lawsuit, and then, you know, if you ask really nice, i'm sure that jackie and i can be persuaded to share our baby with you.
LEADMALE:I'm not dropping it, roseanne.
LEADMALE:So you'd do this to jackie after what i just told you? I am not doing anything to jackie.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to abandon my kid.
LEADMALE:He deserves a father.
OTHERMALE:I told you before that i will figure out a way for you to see your kid! i'm way more powerful than any law! I'm tired of waiting for you to handle this, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:From now on, i am fighting for my rights and my kid's rights.
LEADMALE:Well, dan and donahue walk alone.
LEADMALE:Sorry, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not sorry! But you are gonna be, 'cause i can make your life a living hell.
SUPMALE:You can't scare me out of this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe i can't, but dan can.
SUPFEMALE:Because dan is the kind of man who automatically defends all women because he knows how helpless and vulnerable we are.
LEADMALE:And when he gets wind of the crap you're trying to pull on my family, there's not gonna be a safe place on this earth for you to hide.
LEADMALE:Is that right, dan? Well, in here's pretty safe.
LEADFEMALE:David, can i talk to you for a minute? I'd go to mark, but he'd just make fun of me.
SUPMALE:Sure, deej.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Do you think it'd be weird if i took a home ec course? No, i think that's okay.
LEADMALE:So you don't think it's wrong for a guy to learn how to cook and sew and stuff like that? Of course not.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Mark, you were right! david's a girl! Hey, i knew what you were doing.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! "ah, hey" to you too.
SUPFEMALE:Where have you been? you have to work late? Yeah, a little overtime.
LEADFEMALE:And, gee, when i was pulling up, i noticed the chimney's got a big crack in it.
SUPMALE:I gotta get to it right away.
LEADMALE:Could take me all night.
LEADFEMALE:Tape gladiators for me, will you? oh, um, dan? did you get a chance to talk to fred today at all? Fred.
SUPMALE:Fred fred.
LEADMALE:Fred no.
LEADMALE:No, i haven't seen fred all day.
LEADMALE:He must be avoiding me or something.
LEADMALE:Well, brace yourself here.
LEADMALE:Fred is suing jackie for custody of the baby.
LEADMALE:What? oh, man! oh, man! you gotta be kiddin' me, right? Oh, man! And, dan, i know it would be unfair to put you in the middle, so you'll be on my side.
LEADMALE:Oh, right, like fred would listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:Like anything i've ever said has had any bearing on what fred has ever done.
LEADFEMALE:Now, dan, don't tell me that you can't talk to him.
LEADMALE:I made a promise to jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:You are gonna have to decide whose happiness is more important to you: fred's or yours! What do you expect me to do, roseanne? I can't fire a city employee because he's suing my sister-in-law.
SUPMALE:Well, you could if he hijacked a city bus, and handcuffed himself to the wheel and drove it right off a cliff, couldn't you? This is between fred and jackie.
OTHERMALE:I'm not getting involved.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you have to get involved.
SUPMALE:Why? Because this will eventually drive you insane.
LEADMALE:You can poke me till i'm black and blue.
LEADMALE:I'm not changing my mind.
LEADMALE:Stop poking me! I can't believe you don't like my sister more than this.
SUPMALE:Why don't you just leave him alone, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner? Shut up! This can be done with a steak knife too.
LEADFEMALE:Don't blame dan.
LEADMALE:You should be mad at me.
LEADFEMALE:It was really my idea for fred to sue jackie.
LEADMALE:You mean it wasn't fred's idea? No, i'm just saying it wasn't dan's.
SUPFEMALE:Dan's idea? why would you say it wasn't dan's idea? It was your idea! This is why you don't talk very much.
LEADMALE:How could you do something like this? Roseanne, me and you were having that big fight about darlene.
LEADMALE:I was mad at every woman.
LEADMALE:Fred comes in.
OTHERFEMALE:Who knew he'd take me seriously? Okay, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But now, in the light of day, after all the other males on earth have decided that it's your turn to use the brain, you can see the error of your thinking, right? Roseanne, if you're gonna push me into a corner, i'll tell you exactly what i think.
LEADMALE:I agree with fred.
LEADMALE:And you agree with fred, too? Damn right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i mean, i agree with dan.
SUPFEMALE:The guy's got rights.
LEADMALE:Okay, so jackie has so far put in what, eight months into this baby.
LEADMALE:And fred, he put in, what do you think, three minutes? and i'm being very generous here! So you think that they're equal partners in the deal? Roseanne, the guy's tried everything.
SUPFEMALE:He just wants to be a part of his child's life.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you have to be a man to understand where we're coming from.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, david.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now, i wanna ask you a question, okay? And i want you to give me a really honest answer.
LEADFEMALE:I agree with you, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:All right, david.
OTHERMALE:Now, a man and a woman who aren't married are gonna have a baby.
LEADMALE:And the mother doesn't want the father to have anything to do with it.
LEADFEMALE:Now, does she have that right? Well, yeah, i guess so.
LEADMALE:I mean, she is the mother.
LEADMALE:She's the one that gave birth.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Good answer, david.
OTHERFEMALE:He doesn't count.
SUPFEMALE:We said you have to be a man to understand.
LEADMALE:Unless, of course, the man wants rights.
LEADMALE:I mean, then, i think the women should do what they're told.
LEADMALE:We should have known, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Men stick together no matter how buttheaded their argument is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dan, i guess you're just not the man i thought you were.
LEADMALE:And i wasn't too happy with that one! Well, men, looks like we're on our own for dinner tonight.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:But i'm not making anything fancy.
LEADMALE:You done with the mustard? So, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, are you and mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner talking yet? Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:We're in the bathroom this morning, she shoved me, i believe she said, "move," so technically, yeah, we're speaking.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't care if becky ever speaks to me again.
LEADFEMALE:She's wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Little something i think you oughta know.
SUPFEMALE:Women live longer than men.
LEADFEMALE:So in the end, they're never wrong.
SUPMALE:I think if you just tell the women how you feel-you'd be one of them.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing wrong with talking about your feelings.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look, it's the eighth dwarf, wimpy.
LEADMALE:You don't buy this crap, do you, mr.
SUPMALE:Conner? Boys, let me tell you how i keep roseanne happy.
LEADMALE:You didn't think i was serious, did you? Well, mark, i think you should tell becky what you just said.
SUPFEMALE:What? what did he say? Look, becky.
SUPFEMALE:Mark only took fred's side because he thinks he has to act tough.
LEADMALE:But he's actually a lot more sensitive than you think.
OTHERMALE:Shut up, raggedy ann.
LEADMALE:See what you mean, david.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's hard for him to tell you this because it's the kind of thing guys only admit to other guys.
OTHERMALE:But he's jealous.
SUPMALE:Jealous? about what? I'm not jealous.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:She won't think you're weak.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he's jealous.
LEADMALE:All guys are jealous.
LEADFEMALE:Because we can't have babies.
SUPFEMALE:We all really want to.
LEADFEMALE:No, david, not that.
LEADFEMALE:Not the biggest secret of all! Oh, that makes so much sense.
OTHERFEMALE:You really said that? Yeah, well, those weren't my exact words.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you talk to me about these things? I'd understand.
SUPFEMALE:Wanna talk now? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:So, uh, who's the wimp now? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Let's trade punches and see.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate you.
LEADMALE:Hi, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Oh, you.
LEADMALE:Out of my diner.
SUPMALE:I changed my mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm dropping the lawsuit.
LEADMALE:Really? I thought about what you said.
LEADFEMALE:I still think i'm right, but i don't wanna put jackie through this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, took you long enough.
SUPFEMALE:I knew you'd be pleased.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell's he doing here? He came here to do evil, but he was drawn into my circle of love.
LEADMALE:He's gonna drop the lawsuit.
LEADFEMALE:I'll drop it if you're willing to be reasonable and at least let me see the baby some.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, this is where you say thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Why the hell should i thank him? No, thank me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one that pulled the whole thing off.
SUPMALE:You don't see what he's doing, roseanne? what? what am i doing? You're dropping it so i'll think you're a really great guy and agree to go out with you again.
LEADMALE:When are you gonna accept the fact that i don't want anything to do with you? when are you gonna accept the fact that i accepted that fact a long time ago? I just want to see my kid once in a while.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, once in a while turns into all the time.
LEADFEMALE:And who do you see when you're seeing the baby? Me.
SUPFEMALE:And you end up attached to my life.
LEADMALE:It's so obvious.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, so let me get this straight.
LEADFEMALE:Um, when fred was suing you, that's because he wants to be with you, right? then when he drops the lawsuit, that's because he wants to be with you too, right? So everything on earth that fred ever does is because he wants to be with you.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:You better hope that kid's head ain't as big as yours.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, jackie, try and get this, okay? I don't want you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want anything to do with you.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't go out with you if you were the last pregnant woman on earth.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:See you in court.
OTHERFEMALE:Let the jerk go.
LEADMALE:He's not a jerk.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay? Now, look, i know you've had bad relationships, and you've been hurt a lot and everything, but get a grip! i am completely gripped! He's trying to do something decent, and you treat him like crap.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, now i see what's going on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not getting together with fred.
OTHERFEMALE:No, i know you're not getting together with fred.
OTHERMALE:Fred is gone for good.
LEADFEMALE:But if you don't snap out of this man-hating stuff of yours, you're gonna be old and alone and thinking you can stay with me.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you're saying this to me! You don't know what i went through.
SUPFEMALE:You think you can just say, "snap out of it," and poof, i'm over it? no! they're not all like fisher, okay? They're not all like dad! I'll make my own decisions.
LEADMALE:If you can't back me up, then screw you! No, screw you.
OTHERFEMALE:Now i have to go home and get into a big fight with dan over nothing because you're so totally wrong, so screw you double.
LEADMALE:I'll call you tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Shut up! Am i still mad? Well, roseanne, i guess you did have kind of a point about me having problems with men.
LEADFEMALE:And you are my sister, and you do love me.
SUPFEMALE:So, yeah, i'm still mad.
LEADMALE:All right, i'll talk to you tomorrow.
LEADMALE:So we made love twice in the last nine months.
LEADMALE:I think we're on a roll.
LEADMALE:I forgot how nice it could be.
SUPMALE:I hope this time i don't throw up for the next four months.
SUPFEMALE:So how come you didn't tell roseanne that what she said got us together? Oh, 'cause me and dan have a bet to see who can make roseanne apologize the most.
LEADFEMALE:That's just mean.
LEADMALE:I like this family.
OTHERMALE:Now i know what i was doing wrong all those months.
LEADMALE:I was being nice.
LEADFEMALE:No, i like that you're nice.
LEADMALE:I just finally decided not to let another one slip through my fingers.
SUPFEMALE:Then how come after eight months of candy and flowers, i got nowhere until i sued you? You liked it when i played hardball.
LEADFEMALE:No! I was angry and hurt and disgusted.
LEADFEMALE:But then dan explained it to me.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? He told me that the only reason you were suing me for custody was because you were jealous.
OTHERMALE:Jealous? Yeah.
SUPMALE:That you can't have a baby.
LEADMALE:I didn't know men felt like that.
LEADFEMALE:We don't.
OTHERFEMALE:That's about the stupidest thing i've ever heard.
SUPFEMALE:Dan said you'd say that.
LEADMALE:Fred, i don't think you're weak.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well you know, it was a really tough thing for me to admit.
LEADMALE:And i think it's really good that you men talk about these things.
SUPFEMALE:At least, with each other.
LEADMALE:Did dan tell you he cried when i told him? I don't wanna abandon my kid! he deserves a father! Blank.
LEADMALE:You know, it's moments like this that bring us closer together as a cast.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Because dan is the kind of man who comes to the defense of all women because he knows how help too many words! I know 'em, get lost.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:I'll see you guys later.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going out with sharon.
LEADMALE:Why don't you bring her in so she can meet the folks? Yeah, you've been dating her for, like, three months.
SUPFEMALE:We've never even met her.
LEADMALE:Nothing personal, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I just haven't introduced sharon to any of my friends.
OTHERMALE:You mean any of your straight friends, right? Because you've never been able to accept our alternate lifestyle.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it isn't a choice, you know.
SUPFEMALE:It's not that.
LEADMALE:What, are you ashamed of her? is she a dog or something? Hey, babe.
LEADMALE:You ready? nancy, how come, when you date guys, they look like arnie, and when you date girls, they look like her? Jackie, roseanne, this is sharon.
SUPFEMALE:She's an erotic dancer performance artist.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a stripper.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I've been wanting to meet you for a while.
LEADFEMALE:But for some reason, nancy was scared to introduce her girlfriend to you guys.
LEADMALE:Why, you ain't one of them lesbians, are ya? can we go already? Look, we're going dancing in that new club in elgin friday night.
LEADFEMALE:You two should join us.
LEADMALE:Oh, i--i don't think that would be a very good idea.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:I think it'd be fun.
LEADMALE:I haven't been dancing since--when was dad's funeral? I don't think you'd have such a great time.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like fun.
LEADFEMALE:It's a gay bar.
LEADMALE:Okey-dokey.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, it doesn't bother us if it's gay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it might.
SUPMALE:Friday is convert a hetero night.
SUPFEMALE:Look, are you afraid that we're gonna embarrass you or something? I know all the etiquette.
SUPFEMALE:It's knives and forks on the left and vibrators on the right.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hi, fellas.
SUPMALE:I got to go.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you guys come.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice meeting you.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i really have to go? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna feel comfortable there.
LEADFEMALE:What if everybody there thinks i'm gay? Well, then, you can just think they're gay right back at 'em.
LEADFEMALE:So friday night, i'll get my chance to see roseanne out with my people, huh? That should prove quite entertaining.
SUPFEMALE:Why? well, hmm, how can i put this delicately? Uh, a gay bar is sort of like a size 12 dress.
SUPFEMALE:You just won't fit in.
LEADMALE:David, did you finish my laundry? Yeah, it's in your bag.
LEADFEMALE:Now that i'm not gonna be there anymore, you're gonna have to learn how to do your own.
LEADMALE:How come? I said you could visit.
SUPMALE:What? You're pathetic, man.
LEADFEMALE:She orders you around, and you just take it.
LEADMALE:You got no guts.
LEADFEMALE:I've got guts.
LEADMALE:I just hide 'em.
LEADMALE:Hey, honey.
LEADMALE:I'm home.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'll be down in a sec.
LEADMALE:What? I wouldn't let my wife show off her body like that.
SUPFEMALE:It gives other guys ideas.
LEADMALE:I don't got to worry about that.
SUPMALE:There's nothing those guys got that she can't get at home.
OTHERFEMALE:See, dave i can keep becky satisfied.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:I keep darlene satisfied.
LEADMALE:David, what's the matter with you? I told you to use fabric softener.
LEADMALE:Wow.
SUPMALE:Dean.
OTHERFEMALE:Dean bates.
SUPMALE:It's been a long time.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Do i know you? no, but when i was a freshman you went out with becky, didn't you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
OTHERFEMALE:It's good you're here.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, mark, this is dean bates.
LEADMALE:Dean used to date becky, your wife.
SUPMALE:Oh, so you're her husband.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:So, dean, you still playing football? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a scholarship to northwestern.
LEADMALE:Really? Great.
SUPMALE:Going to college and playing football.
LEADFEMALE:Can't get that around here.
OTHERMALE:Dean? oh, my god, how are you? Great, becky.
SUPFEMALE:You-you look terrific.
LEADMALE:So do you.
SUPFEMALE:If you ask me, that guy's a lot better-looking than you.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go over there and give him a big kiss? Hey, dean.
OTHERMALE:I'm ready.
SUPMALE:Ready? ready for what? Oh, i'm gonna give her a ride to school.
LEADFEMALE:But you two don't even know each other.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we met at some lame frat party.
LEADFEMALE:He was, like, the only guy there not guzzling beer and saying, "god, i love you guys.
SUPFEMALE:" i'll put your stuff in the car.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene, did you hear dean's got a football scholarship? Darlene hates football players.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm, things change.
LEADFEMALE:Do not.
LEADFEMALE:You're serious.
LEADFEMALE:He's giving you a ride to school? so what, becky? what do you care? Well, i just don't think she should be using my old boyfriends to get rides.
OTHERMALE:So what, you're not done riding him yet? Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Did he just say something clever? I cannot believe you're doing this to me.
SUPMALE:So what's the difference if your sister goes out with the guy? In case you've forgotten, you're married.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, just leave me alone.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, get back here.
SUPFEMALE:Becky? Becky.
LEADMALE:Did you see that? Mark was going crazy with jealousy.
SUPMALE:What an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Becky's not the one who'd gonna have to think of some way to pay dean back for the ride.
LEADMALE:See you, david.
LEADFEMALE:Love come down wow, evelyn champagne king, she is fierce! I want to show you my dental bonding under the black light.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't danced with my clothes on for a while.
SUPFEMALE:No sleep last night been dreaming of you oh, now, just relax, jackie.
LEADMALE:There's nothing to be nervous about.
SUPFEMALE:No, what's to be nervous about? It should be clear to anyone that i'm traditional.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look.
LEADMALE:There's another old-fashioned girl right there.
LEADFEMALE:My god.
LEADFEMALE:That pregnant woman's holding hands with my mailman-woman--lesbian.
SUPFEMALE:She waved at me.
LEADFEMALE:What do i do? Well, wave back.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god, she's smiling at me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:That's 'cause everybody knows that waving is the international gay signal.
LEADMALE:Jackie.
LEADMALE:Jackie harris.
LEADFEMALE:Hi! Wow.
LEADMALE:So, uh, now i know why there's never any mail for your husband.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:You don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, now, you don't have to hide our love, pookie.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm roseanne.
LEADMALE:I'm the father.
LEADMALE:So, uh, how long have you two been together? oh, what's it been now, honey, about 38 years? Oh, and she's just as feisty as ever.
LEADMALE:You know, i had a feeling about you.
SUPFEMALE:You did? why? what'd i do? You are so, so sick.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if it isn't charlie brown.
LEADFEMALE:Is that you, roseanne? I thought it was a drag queen doing a really bad liz taylor.
LEADFEMALE:Leon, come sit at a table with us and act like we're together.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't come here to be with you.
OTHERFEMALE:I came here in search of stimulating conversation.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, i smell aramis.
OTHERFEMALE:So, gals, what'll it be? Well, a beer for me and a ginger ale for the little missus here.
OTHERMALE:All rightie.
LEADMALE:Roseanne! It's nice to see some new faces around here, especially pretty ones like yours.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, thank you, marge.
LEADFEMALE:You're not too bad yourself.
LEADMALE:Ah, go on.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm doing what i do in any bar-scoring free drinks.
LEADMALE:So, uh, wow, awesome tattoo there, marge.
LEADMALE:Yeah? you hiding any others? I wouldn't put it past me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you-ah-ah-ah.
SUPFEMALE:Stop flirting.
LEADMALE:Hey, roseanne, want to come boogie with us? Ah, she doesn't want to dance with you.
LEADMALE:I do, too.
LEADFEMALE:Can i, hon? Hot.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate you.
SUPMALE:Keep an eye on her, marge.
LEADMALE:She's a big tease.
LEADFEMALE:Oh we're sisters.
SUPMALE:Hey, aren't we all? You are one pretty lady.
SUPFEMALE:Care to dance? Oh, no, thank you.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:What could it hurt? Uh, it could hurt you.
LEADFEMALE:You see that big butch broad over there? I'm hers! let's take a break! okay! whew! ha ha! That was wild.
SUPMALE:Can you believe that nancy doesn't think i'm cool enough for this place? That must have been before she saw you teaching 40 people to do the monkey.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:How cool is that? It's pretty damn cool.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you learn to dance like that? Well actually, i studied.
SUPMALE:Really? where? In my living room with the solid gold dancers.
LEADFEMALE:You know, roseanne, we ought to hang out more often.
SUPMALE:I was thinking that, too, but next time, let's leave the wives at home.
LEADMALE:You read my mind.
SUPMALE:Huh? what are you doing, cleaning? Yeah, well, i tried twitching my nose, but that didn't work, so i had to end up doing it manually.
LEADMALE:Something the matter? You didn't say a word on the way home last night.
SUPMALE:That sharon kissed me.
OTHERMALE:Nancy's sharon? No, herb sharon over on elm street.
LEADFEMALE:After i drop you off, i run over there for a quickie.
SUPFEMALE:Exactly what do you mean by kissed you? I mean kissed me, like full on the lips, you know, like dan used to before we were married.
OTHERFEMALE:My god, you got kissed by a woman? No wonder you're upset.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, i'm not upset about that.
LEADMALE:I'm just upset about nancy, you know.
SUPMALE:I mean, this could devastate her.
SUPFEMALE:This is unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't even know how i'm gonna tell her.
LEADMALE:You got kissed, and all i got was a couple of women asking if they could touch my stomach.
LEADMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:Did you have fun last night? why? what'd you hear? Well, you left so early, i had to hitch a ride with leon and some accountant with pierced nipples.
LEADMALE:Hey, uh i have to tell you something, and--and you're probably gonna get really upset, you know, but i figure, if i was you, well, i'd want to know.
LEADMALE:Uh, last night, sharonkissed me.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:She told me.
SUPMALE:Oh, she did? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:She just thought you were real cute, and she wanted to kiss you, so she did.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't she a riot? Oh, so you're not, like, upset or anything.
SUPMALE:No, i think it's funny.
LEADMALE:Why, did it bother you? Well, no.
SUPFEMALE:No, it didn't bother me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i-i pretty much knew it was funny, you know.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:When sharon told me she kissed you, i told her there might be a chance that you might freak out.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, freaked out? I'm not freaking out.
LEADFEMALE:Why would i freak out? Well, you know, maybe-maybe you liked the kiss just a little.
SUPFEMALE:What? that is the most ridic-what? Well, it's not that unusual.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, sexuality isn't all black and white.
LEADMALE:There's a whole gray area.
SUPFEMALE:I know about the gray area.
LEADFEMALE:And you're afraid that just one little tiny percent of you might have been turned on by a woman.
OTHERMALE:That is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard.
OTHERFEMALE:I am not afraid of any, uh, small percentage of my gayness inside, you know what i mean? I--i am totally okay about whether i-i'm, like, 3or lower.
LEADMALE:This is exactly why i didn't want to invite you in the first place, roseanne, because you are a total hypocrite.
SUPMALE:I am not a hypocrite.
LEADMALE:A hypocrite doesn't go to a gay bar and teach 40 gay people how to do the monkey.
SUPMALE:Oh, and we're supposed to admire you because you went to a gay bar? i'm supposed to think you're cool because you have gay friends? I don't care if you think i'm cool at all because i know that i am cool, baby.
LEADMALE:I'm probably the coolest chick you ever met.
LEADFEMALE:And for your information, i have friends that are way gayer than you.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, son? was there something you wanted? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Mom said she went dancing last night with other women.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that wrong? No, son.
LEADFEMALE:It's perfectly fine.
LEADFEMALE:And anyone that tries to tell you different is wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean you dance with other men? Yes, i do.
SUPMALE:Really? No.
OTHERMALE:Never.
LEADFEMALE:Not once.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i don't want to, either.
LEADMALE:That's your choice.
LEADFEMALE:Hallelujah.
SUPFEMALE:Cleaning again? Boy, if sharon had slipped you the tongue, we might actually get this place up to code.
LEADMALE:No wonder women don't find you attractive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, is that so awful that the kiss freaked you out? You're just not as cool as you thought.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i'm not cool? You're the one sitting there at the bar telling everybody you're from pbs doing research.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:If you don't have a problem with what happened, why are you upset? Well, okay, jackie, if you really have to know, uh, well, at first, you know, i--i thought that i was upset for nancy, and then i kind of realized that that was just denial.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really upset about dan.
SUPMALE:Dan? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:'cause remember in 11th grade, when that jimmy mcquirter kissed me, you know, and dan felt all threatened and everything, and he beat the crap out of him? Oh, so you're worried that dan's gonna beat up sharon.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:'cause dan would feel threatened by sharon.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:'cause you and sharon might buh-huh-hoo-woo-woo! of course not! i am not gay! I didn't mean for that to sound like it was bad or anything, you know, because if i was gay, that'd be just fine, but i'm not gay.
LEADMALE:So i just don't like people calling me things that i'm not, like a hypocrite, or gay, you know, because i'm not.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't like anybody calling me, like, uh an astronaut, because it's fine to be an astronaut, but see, i am not an astronaut.
LEADFEMALE:So i'm not gonna admit i was wrong or anything, but i just don't want to fight with you anymore, so i was wrong.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm still pretty cool, you know for a 41-year-old mother of three that lives in lanford, illinois.
SUPFEMALE:I like that snoopy dog dog.
SUPFEMALE:It's not like you have to be cool to be my friend, roseanne.
SUPMALE:I mean, i'm not comfortable with everything about you, either.
LEADMALE:Every time i think about you and dan in bed, ecch.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Join the club.
LEADMALE:Wow.
OTHERFEMALE:That was--wow.
LEADFEMALE:I'd give you a standing ovation, but i can't feel my legs.
OTHERFEMALE:What got into you? I don't know.
SUPMALE:You're just so manly.
LEADMALE:I am so turned on by your masculinity.
LEADMALE:How'd you get so macho? Step class.
LEADMALE:Well, now that i got you feeling all relaxed and confident and everything, there's something i want to tell you, but i'm afraid it's gonna upset you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, i told you, i don't mind if you fake it.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't tell me.
OTHERMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:It's, uh-okay, all right.
LEADMALE:Umum well, uh, recently, i was talking to this person, you know, uh, totally innocently, and, uh, uh, then they kissed me.
LEADMALE:Name? I knew i shouldn't have told you.
LEADFEMALE:I knew you would freak out.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the guy's name, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Now.
LEADMALE:No, because then you'll just do something stupid.
LEADFEMALE:I'm your husband.
SUPMALE:That's my right.
SUPMALE:Now, where'd this happen, at work? No.
LEADFEMALE:When i went out.
SUPFEMALE:Well, from now on, you're not going out without me.
LEADFEMALE:Now give me the guy's name.
LEADMALE:Huh.
LEADFEMALE:Well-now! Sharon.
LEADFEMALE:Herb sharon kissed you? No.
SUPFEMALE:Nancy's sharon.
LEADMALE:A woman kissed you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:What was this, that gay bar? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I don't know what to say.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so-well, you're not angry.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm--i'm, uh moreconcerned.
LEADMALE:I mean, it, uh must have been very unpleasant for you.
SUPMALE:It was.
SUPFEMALE:It really was.
OTHERMALE:It was the total opposite of pleasant.
LEADMALE:It was unpleasant.
LEADMALE:So how'd it happen? she just walk up and kiss you? Well, no.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, no, we--you know, we were dancing.
LEADMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:She's probably wearing that light leather stuff like they like, you know.
SUPMALE:Low-cut kind of thing.
LEADFEMALE:What does it matter what she was wearing? No, it's just helping me imagine your painful moment for you.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh suppose she was probably one of those blonde hard bodies that think they can just walk up and kiss some woman.
LEADFEMALE:Heh heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you see her kissing anybody else? You would really love it at that bar, dan.
SUPMALE:They got a lot of men there, too.
LEADFEMALE:You know, and they're rubbing their hard bodies up against each other and kissing each other.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna get something to eat.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, wake up.
LEADMALE:Jackie, is it time? Dan, it's time.
SUPMALE:Get the keys.
LEADFEMALE:I'm looking, i'm looking.
LEADMALE:No, i'm not having the baby yet.
SUPMALE:No, i--come here.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i'm having that dream where i kill jackie again.
OTHERMALE:I got to tell you something important.
LEADMALE:Okay, i found 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Well? what is it? Well, i just wanted to tell you that i've been thinking about it, and i've come to the conclusion that it's never coming out.
LEADMALE:Never.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna be a 70-year-old woman carrying a 30-year-old baby.
LEADMALE:Jackie, you're only three days overdue.
SUPFEMALE:I have a 3-day-old child inside of me! look at me! it's huge! Yes, but you have a very pretty face.
SUPFEMALE:Eww! look! What is that? how come it's like that? how, roseanne? how is this gonna come out of this? Relax, jackie.
LEADMALE:These have been coming out of those for millions and millions of years, you know? Muscles stretch bones break.
SUPMALE:I'm sick of being pregnant.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe it's like a turkey, you know? When this pops out, it's ready.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, cut it out.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what if i can't even make it through the delivery? what if i'm not strong enough? I'm scared, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so was i.
LEADFEMALE:You were? really? well, how did you get through it? Well, you just grunt and groan and scream and know that it's the most agonizing thing you're even gonna go through.
OTHERMALE:And then you see her perfect little face, and you knew it was all worthwhile.
SUPMALE:Ha! Yeah, whatever.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, that was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Can you believe that i got this whole dinner from one of those banquet rooms over the the holiday inn? They were just gonna throw this stuff away.
LEADMALE:My little rosie's a whiz with the leftovers.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, i figure this will be one of your last nights of freedom.
LEADFEMALE:For the rest of your lives, you'll be worried about that kid.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, where are your kids? Hell if i know.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, by the way, fred, if you're thinking about being in the delivery room, things can get a little wild in there.
LEADFEMALE:You might want to wear a cup.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm looking forward to it.
LEADMALE:Not only do jackie and i get to welcome this new life that we created, it's gonna be our third date.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, it's a very stressful time for a woman, so make sure one of you's always rubbing my shoulders.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, why don't i help you with the dessert? well, where are you going? The dessert's in here.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I just thought we should discuss it before we serve it.
OTHERMALE:Well, jackie, now, if you're having issues with chocolate cake, i think you should confront the cake directly.
SUPMALE:Look, it's a really big deal for fred to be in the delivery room with me when the baby's born.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but it's gonna be kind of crowded 'cause i made big promises to d.j. 's science class.
OTHERFEMALE:The hospital only lets one extra person in the room.
LEADFEMALE:So that means what, fred is the extra person? Well, i know we always talked about doing it together, but it's real important to him.
SUPMALE:Is that what you want? Well, i feel like it's the right thing to do.
SUPMALE:I mean, he is the father.
SUPMALE:He has his rights.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that makes sense.
SUPMALE:I've only been your sister for 38 years, but then, on the other hand, he did buy you dinner and a movie.
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:I told her.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i know you're probably upset you won't be there when the baby's born.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm just fine.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. took a bath yesterday, so i've witnessed my miracle for the week.
LEADMALE:Well, i knew if jackie talked to you, you'd understand.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Hey, if you guys are done discussing the dessert, i think it might be fun to eat it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:Are you all right with this? Yeah, yeah, yeah, i'm fine.
LEADMALE:Hey, fred, you have something hanging off your chin here.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! There, i got it.
SUPFEMALE:So she's definitely moving back into her old pattern, you know.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks she has to please the man, so she's letting fred go in there instead of me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he is the father, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I know he's the father.
LEADMALE:Don't you think i know he's the father? why is everybody so obsessed about fred being the father? Well, the truth is, roseanne, she probably doesn't really need anyone in there.
LEADFEMALE:I read about some foreign women who do it all on their own.
SUPMALE:What if something goes wrong? You know, fred's gonna be, like, totally useless in there.
OTHERFEMALE:They all are.
SUPMALE:I couldn't even hear my kid 'cause dan was crying so loud.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you doing? Not good.
LEADMALE:I went to step up on a curb.
LEADMALE:It took me two tries.
LEADFEMALE:Well, a woman in your condition shouldn't be walking anyway.
LEADMALE:You're right, mother.
LEADFEMALE:I should just driven the car right into the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like someone's a little testy.
SUPMALE:I'll be going now.
LEADFEMALE:I tell you, when i was pregnant with you and felt a little edgy, i didn't let it bother me.
SUPMALE:I just went home and had a nice bottle of wine.
OTHERFEMALE:I cannot believe she drank when she was pregnant with us.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, relax, jackie.
LEADMALE:After a few months inside mom, we probably needed a couple shots.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, sorry i'm late.
LEADFEMALE:So what did the doctor say? He said that the baby's head has dropped, and i'm 2 centimeters dilated.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:So have you lost your mucus plug yet? Ladies, these are customers.
LEADMALE:Not if we don't wait on 'em, they ain't.
LEADFEMALE:'til then, they're just people sitting at a counter.
LEADMALE:So did you? Not yet, i don't think.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? it's this, like, honkin' mucus that, uh, sits up there and plugs up the opening to the--what do you call it? Cervix.
LEADMALE:Well, what next to impress the customers, roseanne? Perhaps take one of the hamburger buns and use it to loofah your butt.
LEADFEMALE:Well, gee, just for that, leon, you are not getting any of our homemade placenta shampoo.
LEADMALE:Jackie, the counter, please? oh, my god--oh-my water just broke! Mom, is she leaking? what am i gonna do, roseanne? Tell me what to do.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, well, get your coat and come on.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:We're taking your car 'cause dan just put brand-new duct tape on my seats.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my god! It's 'cause i pushed her too hard, didn't i? i mean, roseanne, her water didn't break because i-asked her to wipe the counter? Yes, it did, leon, and i hope you're happy.
OTHERMALE:Now jackie is going to have to go through the agonizing pain of a dry birth! Okay.
SUPMALE:I'm ready, i think.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna have a baby! i'm gonna be there with ya! d.j. , let's move! Mom, did you water break when you had me? By the time i had you, everything was already broken.
LEADMALE:My water just broke.
SUPFEMALE:When anything of mine breaks, i want to be at the hospital.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, we're going to the hospital.
LEADMALE:I just want to stop by here and grab a bag that i packed for you and, uh, some crossword puzzles.
LEADMALE:Well, i'll need something to do between screams.
SUPFEMALE:We don't have time for this.
LEADMALE:Yes, we do, jackie.
LEADMALE:I had this very same thing when i had becky, you know.
SUPMALE:I was standing right here in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:My water broke.
LEADFEMALE:It was a whole day before i had her.
OTHERFEMALE:Then it was another 12 years before i could get her to shampoo that spot out of the carpet.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what if the baby comes? I'd have to have it here.
LEADMALE:I don't want to have my baby where dan takes his naps.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, i would not let you have your baby on that couch.
LEADMALE:You know how many things we've lost in there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
OTHERMALE:I'm having one.
LEADMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:I'm having one! Well, just remember, you breathe in.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Breathe in.
LEADFEMALE:And out, 2, 3, 4, 5.
LEADMALE:In and out.
LEADMALE:It's gone.
LEADFEMALE:You think it's over? Well, gee, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Do you see a baby around here? I know it's kind of late for this, but i'm starting to rethink this whole baby thing.
SUPMALE:Everything's gonna be great, jackie, i promise.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really scared.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't worry about nothin', 'cause i'm gonna be right there.
OTHERMALE:I don't know what i'd do without you.
SUPMALE:Could you call fred? That is exactly what i was just thinking.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:He should be called.
LEADFEMALE:After all, he is the father.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone knows that he's the father.
OTHERFEMALE:They all keep telling me that he's the father.
LEADMALE:He better be the father.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't get all mad.
LEADMALE:I'm not mad.
SUPMALE:Well, don't get sad, either.
SUPMALE:Well, you got to pick one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe we don't have to call fred yet.
LEADMALE:I mean, how much time do we have left? Oh, well, i think you got about 11, 12 hours of, uh, horrifying, unbearable pain to look forward to.
SUPMALE:Unless it's one of those difficult births.
SUPMALE:Well, we'll wait a little while before we call him, 'cause, i mean, if he's gonna be alone with me all during the delivery, then it's only fair that you should be alone with me during the labor.
SUPMALE:That way, we can have a little sister time together.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if that's your decision, jackie, you know.
SUPFEMALE:You need to think about you now.
LEADMALE:That's what they taught you in that lamaze class that i drove you to through the snow that one time.
SUPFEMALE:I tell you what we'll do.
LEADFEMALE:We'll get me to the hospital.
LEADMALE:We'll get me settled in, and then we'll call fred.
LEADMALE:All right, well, if that's what you want, my hands are tied.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , you entertain her while i go grab the bag.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You know, grandma says your baby's gonna be a bastard.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
LEADMALE:Oh i still think we got here too soon.
OTHERMALE:Too soon? Any minute, i'm gonna look down there, it's gonna be staring back at me.
LEADMALE:We've been here over an hour.
LEADMALE:Do you think we ought to call fred? Well, we could call him, but i think it's gonna be a lot more hours.
LEADMALE:Are you sure? Yeah, i told you.
SUPFEMALE:The only women that give birth real fast are, like, those big fat iowa women that don't even know they're pregnant in the first place.
SUPMALE:Harris? Over here.
LEADFEMALE:What's the problem? Uh well, i have a dull headache, and, uh, she's about to spew forth a human being from her loins.
SUPFEMALE:Oh-oh, here we go again.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! No, you cannot be having a contraction already.
LEADFEMALE:It's only been one minute, and you're still four minutes apart.
LEADFEMALE:She's a bit of a whiner.
SUPMALE:Ooh insurance? No, no, we don't have any insurance.
OTHERFEMALE:But we do have this public aid medical card.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gee, i'm afraid we're not gonna be able to take you.
LEADFEMALE:We've met our quota of public aid cases.
LEADMALE:Oh, terrific.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, can you point us in the direction of the nearest manger? I'll arrange for an ambulance to take you over to the county hospital.
LEADFEMALE:County? No.
SUPFEMALE:I can't have my baby at county.
SUPMALE:I don't want my kid born next to a gunshot victim.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, but unless this is an emergency, i have to follow the rules.
SUPMALE:We're not going to county.
LEADFEMALE:County isdangerous.
LEADMALE:We wouldn't even visit our own mother when we put her in there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:It's coming again! Oh, i--i think maybe those contractions are one minute apart.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm--i'm-i'm having one of those emergency births! Oh, dear, i think we'd better admit you right away.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Good work.
LEADFEMALE:We're in.
SUPMALE:Next time, don't lay it on so thick.
LEADFEMALE:You sounds more like a cow.
LEADMALE:I'm not faking.
LEADMALE:That's impossible.
SUPFEMALE:This is your first baby.
SUPMALE:Everybody knows that takes hours.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Not necessarily.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, with all the pain she's having, i think it'll be real soon.
LEADMALE:I'm not ready.
SUPFEMALE:Fred's not here yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you know, call him.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get fred here.
LEADMALE:You told me i'd have a lot of time.
OTHERFEMALE:You lied to me.
LEADMALE:I did not lie to you.
OTHERMALE:I've had three kids, and it took the usual three or four days.
LEADFEMALE:It's not my fault you're a freak.
LEADMALE:You got to call fred! i will call fred! Just get in the chair and shut up and keep your legs together.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey! my beeper just went off! My liver's ready.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, help, mommy, please! Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Is fred there? oh, he's not? Well, as soon as he gets back, tell him he's got to get to the hospital because jackie's having the baby.
SUPFEMALE:And tell him i called an hour ago! How's it going? Jackie's in labor.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
LEADMALE:I came home for lunch, and d.j. told me her water heater broke.
LEADFEMALE:I was halfway to her house to fix it when i realized when he meant.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, she's in the delivery room.
LEADMALE:I can happen any minute.
SUPMALE:Yeah, where's fred? fred? well, it's so weird, you know? I mean, me and jackie were just talking and everything, and we just thought we'd have more sister time.
LEADMALE:How was i supposed to know she's like one of them fat ladies in iowa? fred doesn't know, does he? Man, i knew you wanted to be in the delivery room, but i never thought you'd sink this low.
LEADFEMALE:You don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:It didn't happen like that.
LEADMALE:Well, how did it happen? what possible excuse could you have? I don't believe you, dan.
LEADMALE:You expect me to make up excuses when you should be out looking for fred? I don't know where! Well, you better think of some place.
LEADFEMALE:If he misses this delivery, i'll have to live with that guilt, and it will eat at me and eat at me until it destroys you.
SUPMALE:Did roseanne find fred yet? No.
OTHERFEMALE:My goodness, i've heard of being left at the altar, but i've never heard of being left in the stirrups.
SUPFEMALE:Laugh while you can, old woman.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, jackie, i think the pain has killed your sense of humor.
LEADMALE:I'm not having any pain.
OTHERFEMALE:I had an epidural.
SUPMALE:See? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I bet i could get my foot behind my head.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my-who put these booties on my feet? I did when you weren't looking.
LEADMALE:Hideous.
OTHERFEMALE:Get 'em off.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you haven't shaved your legs.
OTHERFEMALE:My god.
LEADFEMALE:The baby's liable to be born with rug burn.
LEADFEMALE:Mother! Can we talk about something else? All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you thought about names? No.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't decided yet.
LEADMALE:Oh, god, there i am, about to give birth.
SUPMALE:I haven't even decided on a name for my baby.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now don't get all worked up.
LEADFEMALE:Just name it the first thing that comes into your mind.
LEADFEMALE:You can always change it later.
LEADMALE:You can't change it later.
OTHERMALE:Well, of course you can.
SUPFEMALE:We don't call you marjorie, do we? why would you call me marjorie? Because that used to be your name.
LEADMALE:Only roseanne couldn't pronounce it.
LEADFEMALE:She kept calling you "my jackie.
LEADMALE:" we thought it was so cute, we all started calling you my jackie.
SUPMALE:And after a while, you just became jackie.
LEADMALE:My name used to be marjorie.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It probably still is.
SUPFEMALE:I think that's what's written on your birth certificate.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even know my own name? You're supposed to be my mother! Oh, we told you all this years ago.
SUPFEMALE:No, you never told-no, never, never, never, never, never told me that.
LEADMALE:Now, jackie, don't upset yourself.
LEADMALE:It's no big deal.
SUPMALE:It's no big deal? It's my name! You go ask a thousand people if they think that's a big deal.
LEADMALE:They're gonna say yes, that is a very big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Or was it mary jane? hey, did you find him? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:He's in elgin.
LEADMALE:He won't be back for three hours.
LEADFEMALE:Three hours.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
OTHERFEMALE:She's ready to pop any minute.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:He's gonna miss this.
LEADMALE:He's gonna miss the birth of his baby, and he'll never get over it, dan.
SUPMALE:He'll never get this moment back, and it's all my fault.
LEADMALE:I'm the most horrible person that ever lived.
SUPFEMALE:Where is she? Right there.
LEADFEMALE:I think you had that coming.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, you're right, and you had that coming.
LEADMALE:Where's fred? He's scrubbing up.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for getting him for me.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, did you know my name used to be marjorie? Well, how are we feeling, ms.
SUPFEMALE:Harris? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Let's take a look at you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:I apologize for her legs.
SUPMALE:I told her to shave them.
SUPFEMALE:Just as i thought.
SUPFEMALE:You're fully dilated.
OTHERMALE:This baby is ready to be born.
OTHERMALE:Oh, the baby's ready? Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Now i need everybody out except for the coaching partner.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye, dear.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
SUPMALE:I'll be pacing.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, stirrup alert.
LEADMALE:Let's go, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i'm coming.
SUPFEMALE:Are you okay? Yeah, i think so.
LEADMALE:Well, don't you worry about nothing, 'cause everything's gonna be just fine.
LEADMALE:I'm just right out there.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I love you, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too, marjorie.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Uh, good luck, fred.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, and i'm sorry that i didn't call you sooner.
SUPMALE:Look, roseanne, i'm not gonna forgive you right now, so don't even try.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk about it later.
LEADFEMALE:Don't say that to her.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get yourself all upset now, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:He shouldn't be mad at you.
SUPMALE:I wanted her to be part of this.
LEADMALE:I really need everyone else to clear the room.
OTHERFEMALE:Bad enough she has to miss the delivery.
LEADFEMALE:Look, jackie, if you wanted roseanne here, you should have just told me.
SUPMALE:Hey, fred, this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure the father of jackie's next baby will let me come in the delivery room.
LEADFEMALE:Look, jackie, if you're gonna resent me, then i should just go.
SUPMALE:No, no way, because then i'm gonna feel horrible guilt.
SUPMALE:No, i'm going.
SUPFEMALE:No, don't everybody go! You have to ask one of them to leave.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do i have to make this decision? I'm the one having the baby.
LEADMALE:This is a really stressful time for me.
SUPMALE:You're asking me to choose between the father and the person who's most important to me-oh, mama, my epidural's wearing off! Okay.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Now, look.
LEADFEMALE:Her sister is staying.
OTHERFEMALE:You want me to leave, you're gonna have to physically throw me out.
LEADMALE:You can't be serious.
OTHERMALE:Go ahead and try it.
SUPMALE:You'll be glad you're already in a hospital.
LEADMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADMALE:I don't have time to argue.
OTHERMALE:Look, just put on a gown and get out of my way, all right? Quite a man you've got there.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:He's my protector.
LEADMALE:You're starting to tear, so i'm going to have to cut you.
LEADFEMALE:Holy cow okay, jackie, now push.
SUPFEMALE:Uhh! it's not coming! Okay, remember what they taught us in lamaze, jackie.
SUPMALE:Close your eyes.
SUPMALE:Close your eyes.
SUPMALE:Now think a bowling ball going through a garden hose.
OTHERMALE:Ohh! I can see the head.
LEADMALE:Jackie, it's gonna happen! oh, god! ohh! oh, god! oh, jackie, it's beautiful! Is it okay? It's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:It's a boy.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's a boy! oh, it's a baby boy! hi! hi! ohh! oh, i'm your-i'm your mommy! Can i hold him? I want to hold him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello, baby.
LEADMALE:I'm your aunt roseanne! 
SUPMALE:Hello there, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ficus.
LEADMALE:Drink up and replenish the world with your oxygen.
OTHERMALE:Mom, i told you to quit talking to the plant.
SUPFEMALE:It tried to throw itself off that stand three times last week.
SUPMALE:Well, roseanne, so far my little inspection has turned up mold, cockroaches, and human hair.
OTHERFEMALE:Unfortunately for the unsuspecting citizens of lanford, it's all within the legal limits.
LEADFEMALE:God, i need a break.
LEADFEMALE:My word, jackie.
LEADMALE:Just look what you've done with yourself.
SUPMALE:It's hard to believe you still haven't got a man.
LEADMALE:I've been cleaning out a grease trap for two hours, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, mom, that's not very nice.
SUPMALE:Jackie needs a hug.
LEADMALE:Go hug her, jackie.
SUPMALE:Mom, you get down there, and i'll spend the day sweating over mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ficus.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, i do a lot more work than you realize.
LEADMALE:In fact, i spent the morning making a to-do list of everything that needs to be done around here.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see any of you making to-do lists.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you can cross off "annoy daughters.
OTHERFEMALE:" "spray all garbage cans, unclog back sink, change grease in french fryer.
LEADFEMALE:" i think you should do that last one, jackie.
LEADMALE:You know how tempted your sister gets around a fry.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, at rodbell's we always found it prudent to put a dead bolt on the pie carousel.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look, it's wayland and madame.
LEADMALE:If you don't mind, i've got more inspecting to do.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Most restaurants aren't this cooperative.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm off to my ceramics class.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, it's the middle of your shift! Jackie, it's kiln day.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, do you really need that chip? She's killing me, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:If you cared about me at all, you would tell mom to stop coming around here.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that brings us to the harsh reality of our own relationship, doesn't it.
LEADMALE:All right, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Neither of us is gonna do it, so we're stuck with her.
LEADMALE:What we need is a glass of chardonnay on a great big ol' rat trap.
LEADMALE:Hey, fred.
LEADFEMALE:How's that big, stupid, horrible, mean boss of yours down at the garage? Oh, man, rosie, is he one enormous pain in the butt.
LEADMALE:Yeah, boy, is he a dr-wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:That's me you're talking about! ooh! hey! hey! what's fred doing here? did you know he was coming down here? Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Jackie likes fred.
SUPMALE:Do not! Go on.
SUPFEMALE:You know you like him.
LEADFEMALE:Go ask him out.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't been with nobody for six months.
LEADMALE:No! Don't make me do this, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not ready to go out with anybody yet.
LEADMALE:Hello, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I had the worst date with this woman last night.
LEADFEMALE:She was rude and awful, and then she wouldn't even spend the night.
OTHERMALE:Let me guess.
LEADFEMALE:All she did was talk about golf.
LEADMALE:Well, that's it.
LEADMALE:I'm back into men this week.
SUPFEMALE:Are there any straight guys in this place? Oh, well, there's fred.
LEADMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Jeez, he looks desperate.
SUPFEMALE:Two buttons should do it.
LEADFEMALE:No, roseanne okay, i'll make this deal with you.
SUPMALE:If you go over there and ask fred out, then i will ask mom to become a silent partner and not come to work anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Really? No, i can't.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you can't, i'm going to, because i still have date hair and it's too good to waste.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right, i'll do it.
OTHERMALE:I'll go back to the kitchen so you have a better chance.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Fred.
SUPMALE:Um, i don't want this to come out the wrong way or anything, but i'd like to go out with you some night.
LEADMALE:Um, you could call it a date.
LEADFEMALE:I'd rather call it two people getting together for food and talking about nothing too personal in a well-lit environment.
SUPFEMALE:Physical contact limited to a handshake.
SUPFEMALE:What do you say? Well, i'd have to ask roseanne, but okay.
LEADMALE:Thanks for helping, dan.
LEADMALE:Fred? Well, let me get this straight.
LEADFEMALE:Food, talking, shaking hands.
SUPMALE:Mm, i'm sorry, jackie, i'm already involved with dan.
LEADMALE:All right, i get it.
LEADMALE:Hey, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I'd love to.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, i'll give you a call about the weekend then.
LEADMALE:So, when are you gonna talk to mom? Well, jackie it wasn't a real deal.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, idiot.
LEADFEMALE:I had my fingers crossed the whole time anyway.
LEADFEMALE:No-ho-ho.
LEADMALE:No take-backs.
LEADFEMALE:I can if i want.
SUPMALE:Can't.
SUPFEMALE:Can.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't.
OTHERMALE:Can! Can't.
LEADMALE:Can.
SUPMALE:Can't.
SUPMALE:Can.
SUPMALE:Can't infinity.
OTHERMALE:Infinity isn't allowed.
LEADFEMALE:Is.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't.
LEADMALE:Is.
LEADMALE:Isn't! Is.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i saw all the animals in the neighborhood running in circles.
LEADMALE:I guess that means your mother will be arriving soon.
LEADFEMALE:Help me hold the knife steady, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I keep missing my wrists.
LEADFEMALE:You know, honey, if you don't confront bev, then jackie won't have to go out with fred and i won't have to share my friend.
SUPMALE:Well, dan, i know you're getting to that age where a lot of you friends are starting to like girls.
LEADFEMALE:But, see, that doesn't mean that they like you any less.
OTHERFEMALE:Just in a different way.
LEADFEMALE:Yoo-hoo, it's mother! God you step on every crack in every sidewalk for 40 years what the hell does it get you? do i smell my favorite, yankee pot roast? what's the occasion? No occasion.
LEADMALE:Dan hit a yankee on the way home.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you two relax and, uh, oh i don't know, chat? Well, jackie, i, uh, i'm not feeling real chatty yet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You said this afternoon you couldn't wait to chat with mom.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go check the potatoes.
LEADMALE:Well, wait, i'm not ready for you to check the-hey! You know, there's nothing i like more than spending time with my daughters.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, same here.
LEADMALE:Um yeah, well, i guess it is good to, you know, spend time together here at home, especially 'cause, you know, well, at work, it's not that much fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's why they call it work.
LEADMALE:Yeah, good one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know how sometimes like when it gets really crazy at the diner and you're having trouble with a coworker and, like, you just really kind of lose it and you feel like you just want to rip their head off with your bare hands but, you know, you can't 'cause of health codes.
LEADFEMALE:Is it nancy? Did she make a pass at you, because i think she made one at me! No, it's not nancy.
LEADMALE:I'm waiting to hear you say it's jackie.
SUPMALE:Uh, mom, i just-i just don't think we should work together anymore.
LEADMALE:I hope you're not boiling all the vitamins out of the vegetables.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, wait.
OTHERMALE:What do you want me to say, roseanne? My daughter just told me she hates me.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't get that far.
OTHERMALE:Well, jackie, your sister doesn't want to work with me anymore.
LEADMALE:So from now on i'll just work on your shift.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, i think that roseanne probably has more to say to you.
LEADMALE:Am i right, roseanne? Well, we don't want you to work on any shift at all.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is a team effort.
LEADMALE:Isn't there anyone here who enjoys my company? You know, i can't remember what color the house is.
LEADMALE:Mom, it's just that we think you'd be happier being more like a silent partner, 'cause you've worked for so long.
OTHERFEMALE:You're 64.
SUPFEMALE:I started working at 63.
SUPMALE:God, has it only been a year? If it weren't for me, you'd still be in debt, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:You wouldn't have a house, jackie.
LEADMALE:And neither of you would have a business to kick me out of.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but mom, we're not saying that we don't like your money.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, you won't see me at the diner ever again for any reason.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, mom, don't overreact! No, no, i'll never talk to you again.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never annoy you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never have anything to do with you again as long as you live.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah! yeah! Sometimes i feel like a motherless child and that's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh i like it so how are you this morning, mr.
LEADMALE:Ficus? what? I can't hear you! you'll have to speak up! It's been three days.
LEADFEMALE:When are the two of you gonna stop dancing around the bonfire with your mother's head on a stick? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Is a year too long? Stop that! The woman gave you life.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, she giveth and she sucketh away.
LEADMALE:I'm taking this back to bev's before you kill it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, be a good sport.
LEADFEMALE:Wait 'til after we kill it.
SUPFEMALE:I think the two of you are being hideous.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look, jackie.
LEADMALE:Some of mom's little guilt spores are glomming onto nancy.
LEADMALE:And i welcome them.
SUPFEMALE:I like her.
LEADMALE:She never judges me, criticizes me, or belittles me.
OTHERMALE:Whenever i see her, she always makes me smile.
LEADFEMALE:No wonder she thinks you're hitting on her.
LEADMALE:Well, i hope you're happy.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, nancy.
LEADMALE:I hope you're happy too.
SUPFEMALE:I just came from your mother's, and she's crying.
SUPFEMALE:Why, what'd you do? punch her? No, you did.
SUPFEMALE:You punched her in the emotional stomach.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nancy, nothing can make my mother cry.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks old yeller had it coming.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she came to the door and tears were running down her face.
LEADFEMALE:How do you explain that? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:She pulled a nose hair? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How do i look? Like an ungrateful brat of a daughter.
LEADMALE:With great shoes.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, jackie nancy says we made mom cry.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:You really like my shoes? No, you guys, she was crying.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure of it.
LEADFEMALE:And her friend jake said she's been like that for days.
LEADMALE:Really? Jackie well, roseanne, this is a really big night for me.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but what if mom is sitting over there crying? But i can only take one trauma a night, and tonight i'm choosing the date.
LEADFEMALE:Well, since when did you cut down to one trauma a night? Hey, mom.
LEADMALE:Um, well, i just stopped over to drop off thekids' school pictures.
LEADFEMALE:Here's this one of becky.
LEADFEMALE:She's like in the fourth grade.
LEADFEMALE:I probably should have brought 'em by earlier, but ever since i had d.j. , you know, i've been kind of busy.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, so i get it.
SUPFEMALE:I get it, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Silent partner.
LEADFEMALE:Very, very clever.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, since we're not at work it doesn't really apply here.
LEADMALE:Oh! Well, it's nice of you to allow me to talk in my own home.
LEADMALE:If my sentences run on too long, please let me know.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that one was pretty close.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, what are you doing here? Well, you know, mom, i didn't mean to hurt your feelings so bad.
LEADMALE:I'd like to apologize for what i said to you the other night at dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's very nice of you, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:So, do you forgive me? Yes, i forgive you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well let's stay in touch.
SUPMALE:Well, you don't have to do that.
LEADFEMALE:If anything important happens, you'll surely be notified as my next of kin.
LEADFEMALE:Knew it.
LEADMALE:You don't really forgive me.
LEADMALE:Yes, i do.
LEADMALE:Didn't you hear me? No, you don't.
SUPFEMALE:You never do.
LEADFEMALE:That's why i have to carry around all this guilt all the time.
LEADMALE:Listen, if you're not gonna forgive me, then you're gonna do something really mean back to me to even the score.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, that's ludicrous.
LEADFEMALE:No, it is not ludicrous.
LEADMALE:Otherwise i'm gonna feel guilty 'til the day you die.
LEADFEMALE:So come on.
LEADFEMALE:Take your best shot.
LEADFEMALE:Give it to me right in the chops.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, if you love me.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Unlike some people, i don't hurt family members.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you do, mom, but you stretch it out.
LEADMALE:When i take a band-aid off of my kid's knee, i just pull it off all at once, but you've been taking the same damn band-aid off of my knee one hair at a time for 40 years.
LEADFEMALE:How can i forgive you, roseanne, if you're not really sorry for what you said.
LEADMALE:I said i was sorry.
OTHERMALE:Didn't you hear me? then you want me to come back to the diner? You know, you can have those pictures.
SUPMALE:You, uh, you don't have to return 'em or anything.
OTHERMALE:Well, just what i thought.
SUPMALE:Oh, mom! Of course you can come back.
LEADFEMALE:Do you need me to come back? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:Please, we--we of course need you to please come back.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, please would you come back please? Thank you, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I just needed to hear you say that.
SUPMALE:You don't need me.
LEADFEMALE:I've raised two smart, capable girls who can get along just fine without anyone's help, even mine.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, mom.
SUPMALE:Well, well.
SUPMALE:I guess you still eat when you feel guilty.
SUPMALE:You had to keep talking, didn't you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Sorry i'm late.
LEADMALE:Before you ask, the date went fine.
LEADFEMALE:It was no big deal.
LEADMALE:We had a good time.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? what was what? That grin.
LEADFEMALE:I seen you grin.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't grin.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ooh, you slept with him.
SUPMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:God, you totally did.
LEADFEMALE:You said you wasn't gonna have sex with him.
SUPMALE:Well, for most of the date we didn't have sex.
LEADMALE:Oh, let's--let's not talk about this now.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, roseanne, is jackie here? oh, so it's jackie now, huh? I'll just check in the back.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, flowers would have been a nice touch.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, since he's your friend, dan, if he don't treat my sister right i'm holding you personally responsible.
OTHERMALE:Okay, i'm making a big leap here, but did fred and jackie do something that's none of my business last night? Oh, right, like you don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Like he didn't come in there swaggering this morning like, "hey, i bagged her," you know, and then then all the other apes, you know, sit there, "way to be!" whack, whack.
OTHERFEMALE:Then they grab their crotch and, you know, belch to celebrate the one-night stand.
SUPFEMALE:F.
LEADMALE:Y.
OTHERFEMALE:I.
OTHERFEMALE:, we don't belch for one-night stand celebrations.
OTHERMALE:We expose our chest hair and do a victory dance.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, he didn't say nothing about it.
LEADMALE:This is the first i've heard of it.
LEADMALE:No, no, believe me, it's not you, it's me.
LEADMALE:I'm just going through a reallyuh, selfish period right now.
LEADMALE:But that's perfect.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going through a doormat period right now.
SUPFEMALE:Look, fred, you had some laughs.
SUPFEMALE:I had some laughs.
LEADFEMALE:The sun came up.
LEADMALE:I'm just not ready to date yet.
SUPMALE:Well, we don't have to call it dating.
LEADFEMALE:We could call it two people getting together and having sex in a poorly lit environment.
SUPMALE:Good-bye, fred.
LEADFEMALE:It was worth a shot.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! Oof.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell are you doing? Halfway through the date i decided i didn't want it to get too serious.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, buy you had sex with him.
LEADMALE:Well, sex is about as far as i want to go right now.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, so--so let me get this, okay? you really like him, and you had sex with him and everything, but, you know, you're just gonna go ahead and one-night-stand him? Yep.
SUPMALE:Way to be.
LEADFEMALE:Leon, it is so great that you came in to eat like a regular person.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you know, somehow i've actually gotten to like this rancid concoction of grade-m beef.
LEADMALE:It is good, isn't it.
LEADMALE:What do i see coming through the door? A woman, a strong woman returning to triumph over the scorn of her children.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, you're back.
LEADMALE:That's just terrific.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i haven't returned to work.
SUPMALE:Heavens, no! no? Oh, rats! rats, rats, rats! Oh, hi, mom.
LEADMALE:I thought about what you said, roseanne, and i'm taking your advice.
SUPMALE:I'm going to do something really mean to you.
LEADMALE:That is so healthy.
LEADMALE:In fact, i'm here to even the score.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna hurt you with one big shot.
LEADFEMALE:Get it, girl! Well, uh, mom, you know, jackie was in on it too.
LEADMALE:Since neither of you really want me to work in the diner, i've decided to sell my share.
SUPFEMALE:What? Mom, it's gonna be really hard to get a buyer in this market.
SUPFEMALE:Ohit wasn't that hard.
SUPFEMALE:She just kept lowering her price.
LEADMALE:I couldn't say no.
LEADMALE:I'm impressed, bev.
LEADMALE:Jackie, i--i can't feel my legs.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't this terrific? I get al my aggression out and it really, really hurts you.
LEADMALE:There.
SUPMALE:Now mommy made everything all better.
SUPMALE:I'm so sick of this.
SUPMALE:Your dad is not leaving that greasy engine out on the lawn for one more day.
LEADMALE:It's starting to attract stupid guys in t-shirts.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't bother him right now, mom.
SUPFEMALE:He's real upset 'cause grandma called and she needs money from us.
SUPMALE:Well, we are not giving that crazy woman any more of our money.
OTHERFEMALE:Last time we did that, she spent it all on dionne warwick and her psychic friends.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , your shoes are caked with mud! get 'em off my couch! Okay.
SUPFEMALE:You know, uh, d.j. , this rebellious phase you're going through is over.
SUPMALE:Go take off those muddy shoes.
SUPMALE:Roseanne! We got to talk about my mother.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you want to talk, we'll talk.
LEADMALE:I got something to tell you, and i don't want any grief, understand? My dad missed an alimony payment.
LEADFEMALE:I got to give my mom some money, and i'm not talking it's more like 400.
LEADMALE:Well, god, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, it is your mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you think i'd object? what kind of a person do you think i am? I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Justi'm so upset with my dad.
LEADMALE:Why the hell can't he ever just be a man? Well, gee, mom, you sure handled him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, becky, you really have to look at the big picture.
SUPMALE:Now, your father's in a bad mood, and he just wants a target, and i'm not going to be that.
OTHERMALE:Instead he'll yell at somebody else, blow off some steam, and then i'll go at him.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, mom, i took off my shoes.
LEADMALE:You are just so clever, d.j. you outwit me at every turn.
LEADMALE:I just don't even know what to say.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Could you do your real stupid mother a favor? would you go ask your dad to move his engine off the front lawn? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You're late.
OTHERMALE:We'd have been here sooner if she hadn't spent so much time putting on the makeup.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a little hard to apply eyeliner when something's suckling on your boob.
LEADMALE:I know, that's why i make dan dress in the other room.
LEADFEMALE:Baby little baby.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right back.
OTHERMALE:I'm just gonna top him off.
LEADMALE:We really appreciate you watching him for us, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Lately it's been kind of hard for us to get any time together.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, who would have thought that a screaming, leaking bundle of smells would kill the romance? I don't think it's the baby.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's just that jackie is a little hard to get close to.
LEADMALE:I mean, i know she hasn't had a lot of experience with men.
SUPMALE:What? Hey.
OTHERMALE:Sofred, you're worried that jackie hasn't had enough experience with men.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, can you come here a minute? Well, trust me, fred, you've got nothing to worry about.
OTHERMALE:Jackie knows her way around a man.
SUPMALE:We could blindfold her and she could take one apart and put him right back together again.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, fred, you and jackie dropping the baby off here and going out on a date.
LEADFEMALE:Things getting serious between you two? has she really been out with a lot of guys? Ah, fred when doing a background check on a girlfriend, it's rarely wise to ask the brother-in-law.
LEADMALE:Especially when his wife is the ham-fisted roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Let me just say this about jackie's past.
LEADMALE:Hoo-ah! The head.
LEADFEMALE:The head! Oh, please, jackie, haven't you noticed that i've gotten a lot better at this by now? I mean, d.j. 's neck is a lot less bent than becky's.
LEADFEMALE:I love my sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
OTHERMALE:Okay, we want to go.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you better go, 'cause we got a couple of buyers coming over to look at him.
LEADFEMALE:See you later.
LEADMALE:I got to get to mom's.
SUPFEMALE:Well, don't you want to play with the baby for a few minutes first? we're not gonna play the last one that touches him changes him, are we? No, the last time we did that you didn't touch d.j. for two years.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is nice.
LEADFEMALE:God, dan, when i look at him, i think that anything's possible.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he could be president someday.
LEADFEMALE:Remember when we used to have hopes for our own kids? kind of relaxed there, huh? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, that's good.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want you to give your mother any money.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, we've been over this.
SUPFEMALE:Well, dan, she's just gonna do something loopy with it.
LEADMALE:I mean, how many boxcar willie albums does someone with no stereo need? She needs the money.
OTHERMALE:Well, i didn't know that we don't need it, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I must not have been home the day that we got everything we need out of life.
LEADFEMALE:She was crying again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course she was crying, dan.
LEADMALE:She cries all the time.
OTHERFEMALE:She cries when people lose on star search.
LEADFEMALE:This is different.
LEADFEMALE:Now, dan, that 400 bucks is supposed to put d.j. through medical school.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't you get your dad to pay it? My dad doesn't care about my mom, so it's up to me.
OTHERMALE:If he doesn't, of course we'll help her out.
LEADMALE:I've always believed in sticking by your family.
SUPFEMALE:But this is a last resort.
OTHERMALE:Fine, i'll do it.
LEADMALE:Take the baby back, he's wet.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You touched him last.
SUPMALE:It's the nicest place anyone's ever taken me.
LEADMALE:You deserve it.
OTHERMALE:Anyone who gives birth to a child of mine gets a free meal.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wow.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm glad i had your child then, 'cause, some of the guys i've dated i'd be lucky to get a bowl of pretzels and a beer at the lobo.
SUPFEMALE:So you had a lot of dates at the old lobo.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, boy, did i.
LEADMALE:Oh, look! They've got dancing on fridays.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, that's nice.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of guys wouldn't like to go dancing.
LEADMALE:Have a lot of guys taken you dancing? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Same guys who took you to the lobo or a whole fresh batch? are you trying to ask me something? No, no.
LEADMALE:Not really.
SUPFEMALE:Well, fred.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:You can ask me anything.
SUPFEMALE:You've seen me in the most embarrassing position imaginable.
OTHERMALE:And you were there when the baby was born.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay.
LEADFEMALE:How many men did you date before we met? you mean, dated at all or dated seriously? I mean seriously.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:I'd have to say just a few.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not that i mind if you slept with a lot of guys.
SUPMALE:Well, slept with, well that's not what you asked me.
SUPFEMALE:No, i guess it wasn't.
SUPMALE:Fred, don't worry.
OTHERMALE:It's not that many.
LEADFEMALE:I'd say three a year.
SUPMALE:Since you were, what, 18? Okay, we'll go with that.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, that's not that many.
LEADFEMALE:Three a year for 20 years is 60.
SUPMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:God.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even know 60 people.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i didn't know all of them.
SUPMALE:You men have such a double standard.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure you've slept with a ton of women.
LEADFEMALE:Three.
SUPFEMALE:Three? three, huh? just the three? Yep.
SUPMALE:Just the three.
LEADFEMALE:Does it bother you that i've beenactive? Oh, look.
LEADMALE:Let's just talk about something else.
OTHERMALE:No, i've got a better idea.
SUPMALE:Let's not talk at all.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:No, i haven't had him.
LEADFEMALE:Why? do you think that's a lot of people to have slept with? Well, yeah, for an amateur.
SUPMALE:It sounded even worse when he said he'd only been with three.
LEADMALE:Eww.
OTHERMALE:Three? That's what he said.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but, i mean, three? That's just so low.
LEADFEMALE:I men, he's 37 and he's single, and we both know he's not that choosy.
LEADMALE:I can't believe how he reacted to it.
SUPFEMALE:So why are you so surprised, jackie? you think a guy wants to know that the woman he's with has slept with 20 times more people than he has? You should have lied.
LEADFEMALE:I would never lie.
LEADMALE:Why not? I lied to dan about how many guys i was with.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:He said he was with, like, seven women, so i figured that meant five.
OTHERMALE:And i was with six guys, so i said three, you know, to make sure to come in under his five.
LEADFEMALE:And you think that was good? I think that was brilliant.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal? Why can't the man just accept that maybe the woman's had more experience than him.
OTHERMALE:Because then he knows that she knows that he's not very good.
LEADMALE:Fred's good.
SUPFEMALE:He's perfectly good.
LEADFEMALE:Especially considering it's just the three.
LEADMALE:Perfectly good, huh? where have you been, jackie? Every man has to think he's the best.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm not gonna lie to him and i think in the long run, fred would want me to tell him the truth.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Men want to hear that they're strong and handsome and smart.
SUPMALE:They do not like to hear the truth.
LEADMALE:Do you agree with that, david? Absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:If darlene ever lied to me, i think i'd be really hurt.
LEADFEMALE:That isn't true, david.
LEADFEMALE:Remember how upset you got when she told you that you had poodle hair? She never said that to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe she was sparing your feelings, but i guess you feel a lot better now that you know the truth, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I do.
OTHERMALE:I feel a lot better.
OTHERMALE:What do you guys think of my hair? We think it's great.
LEADMALE:It looks just great.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's stunning.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, he asked to know the truth.
LEADFEMALE:And david, the truth is that your hair is a little odd.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you for being so honest, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, you know how everyone is telling you you're as thin as you were before you were pregnant? You're not.
OTHERMALE:Dan! Oh, my goodness.
LEADMALE:Come in.
OTHERMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:I suppose it's okay that you see me in my personals.
LEADMALE:We are family.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I keep forgetting that.
LEADFEMALE:Is that danny conner stoppin' by at 9 a.
LEADFEMALE:M.
LEADMALE:? That's me.
LEADMALE:What do you need? morning google? want some breakfast? I got pancakes hot off the griddle.
LEADMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I just ate.
LEADFEMALE:This'll be dessert.
LEADMALE:I got some pure maple syrup that i picked up when i came through vermont.
LEADFEMALE:You know, dan, it's really wonderful of you to stop by like this, it really does ed good.
LEADMALE:There's nothin' i like better than doin' ed good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious.
SUPMALE:Ed's always sayin' that he wishes he could see you more often.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go, son.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Fall down on some of that.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, dad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure you boys have lots to talk about.
SUPMALE:Yeah, woman.
SUPFEMALE:Get back in that kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Your men are getting hungry again.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Man! That's good syrup.
LEADFEMALE:You want a jug? I got plenty.
LEADMALE:No thanks, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i talked to mom today.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? how is she? She's fine.
LEADFEMALE:She says you owe her some money.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well i talked to her, danny, and, uh i'm gonna take care of it.
LEADMALE:Is that boy of your still playing hockey? when, dad? I said i'd take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i'm going over there tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna give her the $400 that you owe her.
SUPMALE:Are you gonna give me the money or is it gonna come out of my pocket? Danny, i've already talked the situation over with your mom.
LEADMALE:What situation? well it hasn't been a really great year, okay? I've had a flat patch.
OTHERMALE:The office doesn't want to send me out so much anymore, i got a new family here.
LEADMALE:Tough.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got old responsibilities.
LEADFEMALE:Danny, are you gonna make a speech? Because if you are, i think we oughta get more chairs, we'll call the neighbors-i'm not gonna make a speech.
LEADFEMALE:What i'm gonna do is try to remind you of your obligations! i shouldn't have to do that! you're a grown man! Can you just calm down? Dad, she was cryin' on the phone.
LEADMALE:Danny, that's her way.
LEADMALE:Not like this.
SUPFEMALE:She was crying so hard i couldn't understand her.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes your mother gets very emotional.
OTHERMALE:And everything kind of gets out of perspective, you know? I mean, danny, women have a tendency to do that, you know.
LEADMALE:Women have a tendency to get upset when you treat 'em like crap.
SUPFEMALE:You know your mother.
OTHERMALE:This is not about money, danny.
LEADMALE:Sometimes you're talking to her and she's just not all there.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:There's nothing wrong with mom.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say there was anything wrong with her.
SUPMALE:Who said there was something wrong with your mom? You know that she's had it hard.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
SUPFEMALE:This kind of stuff is not good for her.
LEADFEMALE:Danny if i could help her, i would.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, roseanne said you might be willing to clean up your own mess, but i told her she was wrong.
SUPMALE:Come on, danny.
LEADMALE:Don't.
SUPMALE:Don't leave mad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not mad.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not mad.
OTHERMALE:One thing about you, dad, you'll never let me down.
LEADMALE:Hey, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Still mad, huh? No, i'm not mad, jim.
SUPMALE:Oh, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Fred.
SUPFEMALE:So many of you i get confused.
SUPMALE:Listen, jackie.
LEADMALE:We need to discuss this.
LEADFEMALE:What's to discuss? I slept with 60 men.
SUPFEMALE:Most of them separately.
LEADMALE:I can vouch for that.
LEADMALE:I was there that night sellin' tickets.
SUPFEMALE:Will you quit giving me a hard time? I'm just trying to accept this.
SUPMALE:Fred, all the men that i have slept with and all the things that i have done in my past have made me the person that i am today.
LEADMALE:The person that you were supposedly in love with.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, but all i'm-not nothing.
SUPMALE:We're supposed to be adults.
LEADMALE:Right? and you know what really ticks me off, fred? Is that i was honest and you didn't even appreciate it, and instead, you're punishing me.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:For god's sake, jackie, i'm not punishing you, i'm just trying to be honest about how i feel about all of this.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're both a couple of idiots.
SUPMALE:Sorry, i thought we were being honest.
LEADMALE:Baby, what's the matter? what do you mean, "what's the matter?" can't you imagine how scary this is to him? the big fuzzy thing is yelling at the milk machine? You know, i'm through discussing it, fred.
LEADFEMALE:The next words i want to hear out of your mouth are an apology.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna apologize for the way that i feel.
LEADFEMALE:Then i don't have anything to say to you.
LEADMALE:Jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Stay out of it, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need your kind of help.
OTHERMALE:I am trying to form an honest, solid relationship here with the father of my child.
LEADMALE:Get the hell out of my way.
SUPMALE:Aw.
SUPFEMALE:Am i nuts, roseanne? wouldn't this bother dan? Not at all.
SUPMALE:Dan knows how many men jackie slept with.
SUPMALE:Come on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:If dan found out that you'd slept with a lot of guys, he'd be upset.
LEADFEMALE:No, fred.
SUPFEMALE:I really don't think he would.
SUPMALE:Because we have known each other a lot longer.
LEADFEMALE:And dan knows he doesn't have anything to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i am not worried.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't about me being insecure.
SUPMALE:No, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Because you have no reason to be insecure.
LEADMALE:Jackie's in love with you.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:And she had your kid.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh she also told me you're the best lover she's ever had.
LEADFEMALE:No yeah, and that's like, the best of 60.
OTHERMALE:That is a lot of guys.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but that doesn't make any difference to you, does it, fred? Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:Forgot his binky.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, can you give us a second? Yeah, sure.
SUPFEMALE:I know you don't need my help.
SUPFEMALE:You're building an honest, solid relationship.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was wrong.
SUPFEMALE:So you're okay with this? Of course i am.
SUPFEMALE:I was never that upset about it.
LEADFEMALE:You weren't? No.
LEADFEMALE:How insecure do you think i am? The most important thing is, we were open and honest with each other.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, you're the best.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you don't have to say it.
LEADMALE:Well, so you're back.
LEADFEMALE:You know, crystal brought by a whole case of maple syrup.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think you could get $400 for it? Roseanne, i'm kinda tired.
LEADMALE:What'd your mom do when you gave her the money? did she do like she did last time and wash each and every bill? I didn't give her the money.
LEADFEMALE:I had to take her to the hospital.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:Is she okay? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I guess.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Did she have an accident or something? It's not that kind of hospital.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? When i got there, she was sitting outside in the rain.
LEADMALE:I don't even think she knew who i was.
LEADFEMALE:One of the doctors thought she might be a danger to herself.
LEADMALE:Well, i mean, is she gonna be okay? God, this is so weird.
LEADMALE:Did you have any idea about this happening at all? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to say.
LEADMALE:I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, did you get anything to eat? did you have dinner? want me to make you something? No.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:My god, honey.
LEADMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just-i'm gonna go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, d.j. , haven't seen you since i got home.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
SUPMALE:Oh, nice to see you too.
SUPFEMALE:School's going really well.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, the bus ride home was nice, but, uh, unfortunately, i was sitting next to this guy who kept singing la la la la la la la la la i'm gonna kill you, darlene! Not if i kill you first.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you kids, if i had a corpse for every time one of you said that she won't shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, shut up, shut up! shut! up! How ironic; grandma's strapped to a bed in a loony bin, and yet d.j. walks free.
LEADMALE:What are you talkin' about? Well, thank you for your sensitivity, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna tell you about grandma connor, you know.
LEADMALE:Last night your dad had to put her into a home.
OTHERMALE:What kind of home? A home not unlike our own.
LEADMALE:She's in a mental institution.
SUPMALE:Is it because grandma's crazy? No, it's because she's tired.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, tired of being sane.
SUPMALE:Well, "crazy" is a mean word to use, d.j. your grandmother is just emotionally, um-well, she's had some emotional, uh-she's a tad nutty.
LEADMALE:How long has she been like this? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Only in our family can someone be a nut case for 20 years without anyone noticing.
SUPMALE:We notice, darlene; we're just ignoring you.
LEADFEMALE:Did grandma do crazy things? Well, there was that one tip-off.
SUPFEMALE:Remember when she was in florida, she sent us that postcard that said, "having a great time.
SUPMALE:Wish i was here.
SUPMALE:" i don't think you should be making fun of grandma.
LEADFEMALE:We're not making fun, d.j. this is just our way of coping, you know? Instead of crying and saying my grandmother's in a mental institution, we say, uh, well, at least grandma is with other people who share her interests in hand-washing.
LEADFEMALE:Mornin'.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
OTHERMALE:Oh, i'm sorry, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, i need to talk about this.
LEADMALE:Why? It didn't happen to your mom.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i know; if it would've happened to my mom, at least it would make sense.
LEADFEMALE:Talk.
OTHERMALE:Well, i just have some questions is all.
LEADFEMALE:Um, you know, when your parents got divorced, when was that? Uh, let's see i was wearing a size 8, so that's about right.
LEADFEMALE:And remember when your mom got hospitalized for exhaustion then? um, was that a mental hospital? Yes, it was a mental hospital.
OTHERFEMALE:Her husband of 32 years had just walked out on her, so she got a little depressed.
LEADFEMALE:Go figure.
LEADFEMALE:Were there other times? Once.
SUPMALE:Really? My dad used to go away on business trips when i was a kid and one time, he took off without even telling my mom.
SUPMALE:Two weeks, no phone calls, no nothin'.
LEADMALE:She didn't know where he was.
SUPFEMALE:He really did that? Yeah, he really did that.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:And it wrecked her so bad that she had to go away for a little while.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, i just had no idea.
SUPMALE:Well, i told you that my dad treated my mom like crap.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah, i know that, but, i mean, i didn't know he was that bad and i didn't know that it affected her so much.
SUPMALE:Well, of course it affected her; he was horrible to her.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing that she held up as well as she did.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so so it must've been really hard on you, huh, dan? No, it wasn't hard on me.
LEADMALE:It's was hard on her.
LEADMALE:She made it okay for me.
OTHERFEMALE:She was a great mother.
LEADFEMALE:She didn't teach her kids to make jokes about things that aren't funny.
LEADMALE:Hey, the kids are just tryin' to handle this, okay? We all feel really bad about what happened to your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Well, you could never tell.
LEADMALE:Of course, you could never tell anybody gives a damn about anything around here.
SUPFEMALE:All we do is yell at each other and make jokes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dan, i'm really upset that you've forgotten the occasional fist fight.
SUPMALE:That's perfect, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just tryin' every way i know how.
SUPMALE:Try somethin' else.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, mom, you know, he probably just doesn't feel comfortable talkin' to you because your mother never went insane.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, i'll talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:Alright, sweetie, you go to bed now.
LEADMALE:I hope you're planning to sing him a proper lullaby and not that rock 'n roll you sang last time.
LEADFEMALE:It was puff the magic dragon.
LEADMALE:Square old bat.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not so square that i don't know that song's about reefer.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see what roseanne thinks.
SUPFEMALE:You think it's a good idea to encourage infants to do drugs? jackie, what is the matter with you? I told you you have to wait till he's at least three before you go and buy him one of those fisher-price bongs.
LEADMALE:Make your little jokes now, but you'll wish you listened to me when that boy is 16 and he's wearing an earring and dungarees.
LEADFEMALE:So is dan doing any better? No, he isn't and it just sucks.
LEADMALE:I mean, you know, he's sleeping right next to me, but there's just nothing i can do about it.
OTHERFEMALE:And he's gettin' really nasty too.
LEADMALE:I mean, you know, he called me a bad mother.
LEADMALE:I think.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't really hear him 'cause d.j. was running by with scissors.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not a bad mother, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:A bad mother thinks one blanket is enough in the dead of winter.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you keep them, jackie? In the basement with the asbestos.
SUPMALE:Grandma to the rescue again.
OTHERMALE:Breathe deep, old woman.
LEADFEMALE:It's just so weird, you know, all that stuff he told me.
SUPMALE:I don't know, it's like his family's way more screwed up than he ever let on before.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe he was ashamed.
LEADMALE:Ashamed? He's been married to me for 21 years.
LEADFEMALE:You'd think he'd be numb to shame by now.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, roseanne.
LEADMALE:It is kinda bad.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, think about it.
SUPMALE:His mom beat our mom to the loony bin.
LEADMALE:And i can't even get him to talk about audrey, you know? He's so defensive.
SUPFEMALE:It's like he has to believe she was, like, the world's greatest mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Egad, imagine a child loving his mother.
LEADMALE:I hope you didn't snap him out of it, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:This is not about dan loving his mother, okay? You can still love your mother even though you know that she is a crazy old shrew.
SUPMALE:Don't think that i can't read between those lines, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You know, dan's mother was lucky she had sons.
SUPMALE:Sons always treat their mothers with respect.
SUPMALE:Ugh, look at the stains! I assumed because it was folded it was clean.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're right, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Dan's mother was lucky and we don't treat you with enough respect.
OTHERFEMALE:Shoulda had sons.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene? I was reading how if your grandmother's insane, there's a one-out-of-three chance that you will be too, so there's a test here to look for the early warning signs.
SUPMALE:Oh, man, not another one of those ink blots that looks like the devil stabbing me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys, what are you doin'? Oh, nothin', just takin' a test.
LEADMALE:Man, i hate tests.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this one's different.
LEADFEMALE:When you're done with this one, you don't hand the nurse a plastic cup.
SUPMALE:Okay, question number one: "when you put your shoes on, do put them on one at a time or both at once?" both at once.
LEADMALE:Okay, that was an easy one.
LEADFEMALE:Question number two: "what color is the sound of a dog barking?" bright green.
OTHERFEMALE:Green or bright green.
OTHERMALE:Both are acceptable.
SUPFEMALE:Question number three: "pick one: triangle, hat, or boat.
SUPFEMALE:" triangle? Boat.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Question number four: "do you ever relive the same moment twice?" no.
LEADMALE:Very good.
SUPMALE:Question number four: "do you ever relive the same moment twice?" no.
LEADFEMALE:Very good.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys, what are you doin'? Oh, nothin', just takin' a test.
LEADFEMALE:Man, i hate tests.
LEADMALE:Oh, this one's different.
LEADMALE:When you're done with this one, you don't hand the nurse a plastic cup.
LEADMALE:Dan, dan, now you're gonna wake the babies.
SUPMALE:Now, why don't you just calm down and roseanne will be here any minute to take you home.
LEADFEMALE:No, crystal, i told you i'd come here to talk to my father.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not leaving until i do.
LEADMALE:I told you he's not here.
LEADMALE:He's on a business trip.
SUPMALE:What a surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Prepare yourself, crystal.
LEADMALE:You may not hear from him for two weeks.
OTHERMALE:Dan, i think you should leave.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't think i should leave.
LEADFEMALE:You know who i think should leave? I think you should leave.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should get away from him.
LEADMALE:Pack up the stuff, grab the kids.
OTHERMALE:I'll give you a hand.
OTHERMALE:Hey, lonnie, get that chair! Dan, dan, put that down.
OTHERMALE:Lonnie, why don't you go get dan some nice, hot coffee? Now, now listen.
LEADFEMALE:I'm married to your father and i'm not leavin'.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, crystal, don't let him do to you what he did to her.
LEADMALE:You haven't heard your father's side.
SUPMALE:He's a good man.
SUPFEMALE:Damn it, he is not! dan, you're scarin' me! Look, crystal, he doesn't love you.
OTHERMALE:He doesn't love the kids.
SUPFEMALE:He just goes away all the time and he leaves you alone by yourself, then he comes back and he says, look, honey, i got you a lamp.
LEADMALE:Lonnie, lonnie, come here.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you gotta talk to your mom, you gotta tell her to get out because he's wreckin' your family.
LEADMALE:No-no he's not.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, i forbid you to talk to my son that way.
LEADFEMALE:Now-now why don't you have a little coffee.
SUPMALE:You're not listening to me.
OTHERMALE:Come on, you need it.
LEADFEMALE:This is not way for you to act in your father's house! i am not drinkin' his damn coffee! Well, that's always the first sign that he's had too much caffeine.
OTHERFEMALE:Rosie, you got nothin' to do here.
SUPMALE:Just get out.
LEADMALE:No, dan, that would be rude.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal would be very insulted if i didn't throw a cup at the wall too.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm not leavin'.
LEADFEMALE:Not till i talk to the son of a bitch.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of our house.
SUPMALE:Um, that was pretty cute, lonnie, but, you know, his ankle is as big as your chest.
SUPMALE:Dan, if you're waitin' around to see your dad, um, you're waiti'' in the wrong place 'cause he's over at our house.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you talkin' about? yeah, isn't that right, crystal? Oh, right, that's where he is.
SUPMALE:Yesiree.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why the hell didn't somebody tell me? Oh, 'cause we wanted it to be a big surprise, you know.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Hey, crystal you know i'm only doin' this to help you.
LEADFEMALE:And you did, dan, but now you're gonna go home and rest, so tomorrow you'll be able to help others.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i'm really sorry, crystal.
SUPFEMALE:You know he loves ya, but right now he's just a big, stupid drunk guy that's just in a lot of pain.
OTHERMALE:It's okay, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:He just broke a few things.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and now a shrub.
SUPFEMALE:Oh get up, dan! Morning, otis.
SUPMALE:Boy, dad, now that i'm in college, let me tell you, i know exactly how you feel.
SUPMALE:I find that if you just start drinking right when you wake up, the hangover's gone.
LEADMALE:And, you know, you can go about your day with full energy, whether it's goin' to classes or, you know, raising a family.
SUPMALE:You're done, darlene.
LEADMALE:Oh, dad i'm really sorry about grandma.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:Alright, darlene, time to leave the house.
LEADFEMALE:You're just a painful reminder of another bender your dad went on.
SUPMALE:Where's the rest of the free-loaders? Well, i told 'em to get lost, you know, um, 'cause i thought that we would talk.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, they didn't have to leave the house.
LEADMALE:Well, i thought we'd maybe talk loud.
SUPMALE:So what were you thinking goin' over there all drunk? did you think you were gonna go over there and beat him up? Maybe.
SUPMALE:Or at least barf on him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, crystal called me last night, you know, and she had some things to say about your mom and dad.
LEADMALE:Listen to me, dan, a person doesn't become mentally ill because their spouse goes away on business trips.
SUPMALE:How in the hell can you say that to me? Well, think about it, dan.
SUPMALE:It can't all be his fault.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what are you sayin'? Oh, i see, you're tellin' me that if i forgive him, i'll feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why didn't you say so? done! Where's my tap shoes? This isn't just the third time your mother's been hospitalized, dan.
SUPFEMALE:It used to happen a lot when you were a kid and they told you that she was visiting some relative? Well, she wasn't.
LEADMALE:Where the hell did you hear that? Crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's bull.
LEADFEMALE:My mother was in a bad marriage.
LEADFEMALE:No, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal told me that your mom was in and out of a lot of hospitals before your parents even met.
SUPMALE:Crystal's protecting him.
SUPMALE:Do you wanna call those hospitals-stop defending him.
OTHERMALE:Stop! He let you blame him for everything, dan.
SUPMALE:He took all your crap, all of his life, just so he could keep your mom lookin' good for you.
LEADFEMALE:No way, no way.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna let you do this.
LEADMALE:You are not gonna twist this around.
LEADMALE:He did a good thing, dan.
LEADMALE:It didn't happen that way.
LEADFEMALE:What you're saying does not make any sense.
OTHERFEMALE:It makes perfect sense, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Why? huh? why? why wouldn't he tell me about it? Because maybe he knew he was gonna be gone all the time.
LEADMALE:Maybe he figured it would be easier for a kid to have a bastard for a father than a crazy person for a mother.
LEADFEMALE:He made her that way.
LEADFEMALE:This was his fault.
LEADMALE:No, it wasn't his fault, dan.
SUPMALE:And it wasn't her fault.
SUPMALE:And it's not your fault either.
LEADFEMALE:I can't take this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i know.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna take it with you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's my son, the tough guy.
LEADMALE:Is there some stuff that you forgot to break last night? I just came to help you clean up.
LEADMALE:Can i come in? You know, when you were younger, at least you had the courage to take your shots at me.
SUPMALE:Well, last night you weren't here.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, my family was.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, look, i'm sorry about the things that i said to crystal.
LEADMALE:At least crystal, thankfully, is smart enough not to listen to some drunk who's tearing up her house.
SUPMALE:Whoa, who broke the toaster? Man, i don't even remember being in the kitchen last night.
SUPMALE:Come on, danny, what are we doin' here? I can help you fix that.
SUPFEMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:I just wanna talk to you, dad.
SUPMALE:I think we're way past it.
LEADFEMALE:Way past talk.
LEADFEMALE:Now, i got an idea.
SUPMALE:Why don't we just call it quits, go our separate ways? You're my father, i'm your son.
SUPFEMALE:We can't do that.
SUPMALE:Why the hell not? We're both grown men.
LEADMALE:We don't need each other anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just say it's done.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, dad.
LEADFEMALE:You know it was different when i was on my own, okay? But now, i can't have you comin' over here and just scarin' the hell out of my family.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't leave until we talk about mom.
LEADFEMALE:That's the difference between you and me.
LEADMALE:You can't stop livin' in the past.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just-i ruined your mother's life.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, see, i admit that.
SUPMALE:I can't keep apologizing.
LEADMALE:Crystal told roseanne about mom.
LEADFEMALE:You know, her history.
SUPFEMALE:Well, she shouldn't have done that.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe she shouldn't have, but i wish you had.
SUPFEMALE:Some things are private, dan.
SUPMALE:I'm her son.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
SUPMALE:And i didn't you to go around thinkin' bad things about your mother, because she was a good woman.
LEADMALE:Still is.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and i know i've said some bad things about you for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:I just want you to know that i really appreciate-there you go.
OTHERFEMALE:There you go.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you're just gonna drag the past up again, aren't ya? Don't.
LEADMALE:Don't.
LEADMALE:Look, you don't understand what i'm tryin' to tell ya.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanna tell ya that i really appreciate-don't! Dan just leave it alone.
OTHERMALE:If that's the way you want it.
LEADMALE:Hey, that toaster is not gonna fix itself.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Hey, i thought you were gonna fix this thing.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to? Hey, i didn't break it.
LEADMALE:There's a ballgame on.
LEADFEMALE:You mind if i watch? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:We can make it more interesting, put 20 bucks on it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take the bulls.
LEADFEMALE:Huh, my house, i'll take the bulls.
SUPMALE:I mean, this is wild.
OTHERMALE:I don't even remember being in the kitchen last night.
LEADMALE:You weren't.
LEADFEMALE:Thing's been broken for months.
LEADMALE:Hey, d.j. i know you guys are just trying to trick me with this stupid test.
LEADFEMALE:Oops, figured it out.
LEADMALE:Hey, d.j. how'd you do that? Oops, figured it out.
LEADMALE:Hey, d.j. you're not scaring me! Oops, figured it out.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, d.j. stop it! Oops, figured it out.
LEADMALE:Hey, d.j. mom! What's the matter with him? The kid's losin' it.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:How do you keep gettin' in here? There must be a hole in the screen or somethin'.
SUPFEMALE:Where you goin'? George's.
LEADFEMALE:That boring kid? I thought you hated him.
LEADMALE:You must be thinking of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, jackie.
SUPMALE:What kind of mood is my mom in? Great.
SUPMALE:We just got our new stove.
LEADFEMALE:Why? what are you up to? Well, david and i want to get matching nose rings, but he insisted we get her approval first.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i didn't wanna, like, fall in love with having one, and have mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner force me to take it out.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't think she'll let us, do ya? Umi don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, how exactly do they do it? Well, they take this long needle, and they put it in really slowly, and then they move it back and forth really quickly.
LEADMALE:But you hardly feel it, 'cause the needle's so hot.
OTHERMALE:Man, that new stove is so cool.
SUPFEMALE:Now we can finally cook the meat, rather than just agin' it.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, i'm glad you're in such a good mood.
LEADMALE:David and i wanna go downtown and get matching nose rings.
LEADMALE:It's okay, right? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Just be home in time for dinner.
LEADMALE:Not that you could have stopped us.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, i'd like to see you try.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i think it's great.
SUPFEMALE:Any time kids can express themselves non-verbally, i'm all for it.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:If you'll just sign here, i'll bring it in.
OTHERMALE:Hey! This is about twice the price you guys advertised.
LEADMALE:Well, you didn't read the fine print.
LEADFEMALE:We only sell the first 10 at that price.
LEADMALE:You must be new at this.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm not new at this.
OTHERMALE:I've been screwed over before.
SUPMALE:Well, i can take it back.
LEADFEMALE:But your old one's not up to code, andi'm sort of obligated to report that.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Bring in your damn stove.
LEADFEMALE:Remember to lift it with your back.
OTHERMALE:Jeez, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:That really sucks.
LEADMALE:I got his pen.
SUPMALE:Ugh, what a jerk.
SUPMALE:Well, we'll see you back at the house.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you goin'? To get the nose rings.
LEADMALE:No way! but you just said we could! Yeah, but you sat here long enough for me to change my mind.
LEADMALE:Maybe there's a lesson in this for you, young lady.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Now we can't get the nose rings? I never get what i really, really want.
LEADFEMALE:Well, david, you're not my kid.
LEADMALE:So you can go ahead and get your nose pierced.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:If she's not gonna let you get one, i won't get one, either.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's okay, david.
LEADMALE:I wanna live vicariously through you.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:There must be dozens of things we can pierce on you.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, miss harris.
LEADMALE:Now.
LEADMALE:You know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna say "knock, knock", like i'm at your door, and you're gonna say, "who's there?" like you're wondering who i am, okay? and then i'm gonnawho's there, george? I-i didn't say "knock, knock" yet.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'll start again.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Knock, knock.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, george has got this really great joke to tell you.
OTHERFEMALE:I-i can't hear it again.
LEADFEMALE:Last time, i about wet myself.
OTHERMALE:Well, gee, george.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have a lot of time to hear your joke.
LEADFEMALE:Only got about a minute or so.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's okayoops.
SUPMALE:Minute's up.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Can ican i just ask you one thing, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:How come d.j. never comes and plays with me anymore? what are you talkin' about? He says he's been over at your house every single night this week.
SUPFEMALE:Which has got to be a record for anybody.
LEADMALE:That's funny, 'cause i haven't seen him in a really long time.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that little boy is in a lot of trouble for lying to me.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Now i'll never be able to come over? Don't you worry about it, george.
SUPFEMALE:No matter how bad he is, yours is the one place he'll still be able to go.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, i'll let ya off work if you do me a favor.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, forget it.
SUPMALE:I am not gonna spy on my brother and rat him out.
SUPFEMALE:What? I'm just kidding.
LEADMALE:I'd love to.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:I've got your stove in the truck? what are you talkin' about? I'm sorry it's a day late, butit's already paid for.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Second stove.
OTHERFEMALE:That can't be.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes it can be, jackie.
LEADMALE:And i don't really think you should question a company the size of appliance station.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, they know what they're doing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure they send out a lot of stoves.
LEADMALE:In fact, they probably send out so many stoves that they can't even keep track of how many stoves they send out.
SUPMALE:Is there some problem here? hm? There'sno problem.
OTHERMALE:You have a problem, roseanne? No.
SUPFEMALE:I have no problem at all.
LEADMALE:We are both problem-free.
SUPMALE:Can you believe this, roseanne? Free stove.
LEADMALE:So, well, gogo get the stove, there, mickey.
LEADMALE:What are you waiti'' on, your pension? So i did it.
SUPFEMALE:Whaddaya think, really? Because if you want me to get rid of it, i will, just purely out of respect.
LEADFEMALE:I like it.
SUPFEMALE:Areare you sure? Because, you know, since i'm living here, i know my appearance reflects on this family.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Makes us look good.
LEADMALE:Hell, that there is pure gold.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, from now on, i'd appreciate it if you'd be a-sittin' on the front porch.
SUPMALE:Hey, dad.
LEADFEMALE:You're never gonna guess what i found out about d.j. wow.
SUPMALE:I still can't believe you got that.
SUPMALE:You're like the first straight guy i've known with the guts to wear one of those.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, i followed d.j. around today, and you were right.
LEADMALE:He is hanging with a new crowd.
OTHERMALE:It's even worse than you thought.
LEADMALE:What kind of crowd? he's not doin' drugs, is he? No, no.
SUPMALE:He's goin' to church.
OTHERMALE:Church.
LEADFEMALE:Church? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I talked to the, uh uh, head holy guy? And, uh, he said that d.j. 's been there, like, every day.
LEADMALE:Oh, god, no.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, dan.
SUPMALE:Now, church is good.
LEADMALE:We support church.
SUPMALE:Could be a good influence on him.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, maybe he'll take after your cousin, jessico.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't he the one who, uh, sent us the bible with every single word highlighted? No, that's his cousin, jeb.
OTHERMALE:His cousin jessico is the elvis-impersonatin' preacher that clog-dances when he's filled with the holy spirit.
SUPMALE:Oh, god, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You know i'm not good with religion.
LEADMALE:Well, you better get good with it, dan.
LEADFEMALE:'cause we don't want d.j. thinkin' we don't approve.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it'sit's not that.
LEADMALE:It's justit just gives me the willies.
LEADFEMALE:You know my family.
OTHERFEMALE:They follow pat robertson around like he's the grateful dead.
SUPMALE:What? where have you been going, every day after school? And remember, god will punish you if you lie.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne well, hey.
SUPFEMALE:We got it.
OTHERFEMALE:We might as well use it.
LEADFEMALE:I've been goin' to church.
LEADMALE:Well, so why didn't you tell us before? 'cause i thought you'd make fun of me.
SUPMALE:D.j. , give us a little credit.
LEADMALE:Why would we make fun of that, when we have the bounty that is your face? Okay.
LEADMALE:Go out of here.
LEADFEMALE:We wanna talk about this.
SUPFEMALE:Dan? You wanna sit here and talk, too.
LEADMALE:Well, i wanted to tell you.
LEADMALE:I just had some questions about god and stuff.
SUPMALE:Well, so why didn't you come to us, if you had questions? you know? There's no two better people to answer your questions than me and your dad.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:What religion are we? I have no idea.
LEADFEMALE:Dan? Well, my family's pentecostal on my mom's side, baptist on my dad's, your mom's mom was lutheran, and her dad was jewish.
SUPFEMALE:So what do we believe? Well we believe in, uh, bein' good.
LEADFEMALE:So basically, we're good people.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but we're not practicing.
LEADMALE:Will you mind if i keep going? No, d.j. your dad and i are real proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Uh, yeah! It's a brand-new, uh, industrial stove.
OTHERFEMALE:And we're sellin' it at a discount.
OTHERMALE:Well, see, that's 'cause, uhwell, uhsee, 'cause, welli won it on a game show.
SUPFEMALE:Well, great! Great.
LEADFEMALE:Then see you tomorrow! You were never on any game show.
SUPMALE:I was too on a game show.
SUPFEMALE:And if you didn't spend all your time down at that damn church, you would know that.
LEADFEMALE:Dinner! ahh! Dinner with the family.
SUPFEMALE:Always a pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:Now if you'll excuse me, longest yard is on, and i haven't seen it since november.
LEADFEMALE:Ahh.
SUPMALE:Dinner with the family.
LEADFEMALE:How come we never say grace? Because, d.j. , grace is for those who are thankful.
OTHERMALE:Darlene, d.j. has a new interest, and we're not going to give him a hard time.
SUPFEMALE:And i think saying grace is a wonderful idea.
LEADMALE:Dan? Say grace.
SUPFEMALE:It's not my turn.
LEADFEMALE:I said it last.
LEADFEMALE:When? Thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:Start prayin'.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:This involves touching? Oh, lord.
SUPMALE:We thanktheefor providing this foodwhichwe have gotten from theethine chicken is particularly good.
SUPMALE:Amen.
OTHERMALE:You know, i really like that.
LEADMALE:You know, we've gotten awfully lazy around here, about our souls and such.
LEADMALE:I think, from now on, we need to be as serious about ourour spiritual fitness as we are about our physical fitness.
LEADMALE:Uh, david.
LEADMALE:Would you pass the goat's blood, please? Ignore her, d.j. she was just sent here to test us.
OTHERMALE:If you have any more suggestions, we'd love to hear 'em.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
OTHERMALE:No, come on! I think it would be fun.
LEADMALE:Like, say, some sunday, we could get up early, and i'll get all dressed up, and sit there on the couch and watch one of them church shows.
LEADMALE:Well, there is one thing that's been bothering me.
OTHERMALE:It's wrong to use swear words, right? so how come you swear so much? Well, because, umwell, sometimes it's real hard not to.
LEADFEMALE:You know.
OTHERMALE:But if i swore as much as i wanted to, i'd never say anything else.
LEADMALE:Soso you see, i'mi'm using a restraint.
OTHERMALE:And god loves that.
LEADMALE:You wanna know why i swear, d.j. ? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Why? Shut the hell up! The truth is, d.j. , god only cares about what's in our hearts.
SUPFEMALE:And he knows we're good people.
LEADFEMALE:If we're good people, how come when we go to the movies, you make me lie and pretend i'm 11? would you like to take that, dan? Well, d.j. , there's a very good reason for that.
OTHERFEMALE:We won't do it anymore.
LEADMALE:This is so stupid.
SUPFEMALE:We make you lie 'cause it's cheaper if you can pass for 11.
LEADFEMALE:Same reason i make david lie.
SUPMALE:And by paying less at the movies, see, we have more money to give to charity, later, and that's just what we're gonna do, one of these days.
LEADFEMALE:Welli don't think darlene and david should be having sex without being married.
LEADMALE:Roseanne? david, would you like to take that? Um well, you see, d.j. , love is, uh, a holy thing.
LEADFEMALE:Stop speaking, david.
LEADMALE:Look, d.j. if you wanna ask anybody about anything, why don't you ask her about the stove she's stealing? I am not stealing that stove.
LEADMALE:Oh, what is it? a gift from the stove fairy? No! The company gave it to me, and it is okay to keep it, because they are a really large company that likes to screwexcuse methat takes advantage of little people like us.
LEADMALE:Look, i could care less if you're takin' the thing, but at least have the guts to admit that you are stealing a stove.
LEADFEMALE:No! Because taking somethingyou know, is not necessarily stealing, if you have a real good reason for needing it.
LEADFEMALE:Right, david? Uh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Like if your baby was starving, andyou stole a loaf of bread for it, or if a stove company accidentally sent you a second stove.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:I wish you'd just take it back.
SUPFEMALE:Your mother is keeping the stove.
SUPMALE:This religious discussion is over.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, d.j. i know it's hard to live in a house where people's behavior conflicts with your religious beliefs.
LEADMALE:Thanks, david.
OTHERMALE:So if you think ourour bodies are like temples, and shouldn't be violated by things like nose rings, thenyou knowjust tell me.
LEADFEMALE:No, i don't think that.
LEADMALE:But i want you to stop having sex.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, darlene says we have some religious people in our family.
SUPMALE:Oh, we did, d.j. butgod has taken them all away.
LEADMALE:She told me about this preacher.
LEADMALE:Jessico.
SUPFEMALE:She said he's like our second cousin.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, d.j. , he's the son of two second cousins.
LEADMALE:I'd like to write to him.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You're not allowed to write to him.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Because then he would know where we live.
LEADMALE:Dad? do you believe in god? Yes, i do.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure? Well, i'm not completely sure.
SUPMALE:But i'm pretty sure.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid if you're not completely sure, you won't go to heaven.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I prefer to stay with your mother.
SUPFEMALE:But, dad, you really should believelisten, d.j. ? D.j. , d.j. if you really wanna save someone.
LEADFEMALE:You know who needs it? Your sister.
OTHERFEMALE:She doesn't believe in god.
OTHERFEMALE:Hell, she worships the devil.
LEADFEMALE:I believe in god.
OTHERFEMALE:Do not! Dad? Me and darlene really wanna help you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i gotta, uh, sand down on a door out in the garage.
LEADFEMALE:Jesus was a carpenter! So, roseanne, you got my cut for the stove? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I do.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just glad that thing's gone, now that i'm living with father flanagan.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a second.
LEADMALE:This is way more than my share.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i know.
SUPMALE:But i started thinkin' about you and the baby, and all the stuff you're goin' through, and i guess i felt a little generous, you know, so i cut leon out.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Uh, can i speak with the owner, please? It's about a delivery mistake, made about aa stove.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPMALE:So, what, are one of you the owner, or what? Uhwell, yeah.
SUPMALE:But, uhuhthis guy named leon, he's the one that's responsible for all the deliveries.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, can you tell leon thatwe know the stove was supposed to be here yesterday, and we're real sorry about the delay.
OTHERFEMALE:Delay? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But i got it on the truck right now, sothey're sending us another one.
LEADMALE:Could you wait outside for a second? Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:We cannot keep doing this, jackie.
SUPMALE:Don't you see what's goin' on? God's punishing us.
LEADFEMALE:They're gonna keep coming and coming, just like locusts.
LEADFEMALE:No! are you kidding? This is great! we're makin' way more money than sellin' these stupid sandwiches! we should just close down the restaurant, and sell their stuff! no! no! no! Can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Restaurant's too good a front.
LEADMALE:Well, i can't make a decision like this.
LEADMALE:Listen.
LEADMALE:Listen, listen.
LEADFEMALE:We willwe'll give it you know, in case god gives us a signal that it's wrong.
LEADFEMALE:We got another one! That stove turkey's outside again.
LEADFEMALE:Are they sending you another one? Yes, d.j. that's the power of prayer.
LEADMALE:But you said you only took the other one to get even.
SUPMALE:Wouldn't this just be stealing to make money? No! but, mom no, d.j. ! You need to honor your mother.
LEADMALE:And i read somewhere that that commandment is way more important than the stealing one.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not gonna believe this.
SUPFEMALE:What? They are delivering us a second stove.
LEADFEMALE:A second stove? That hardly ever happens.
SUPMALE:I was just talkin' to the stupid delivery guy.
LEADFEMALE:He has no idea what's going on.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:That's amazing.
LEADMALE:A guy has no idea what his co-workers are up to? doesn't leon know that you got another stove before this one? Of course not.
SUPMALE:But you said it was only okay with god to cheat a big company who cheated you.
SUPMALE:But you aren't giving leon any of his money.
SUPMALE:Listen to me, d.j. in the bible, it states: render unto caesar what is caesar's, and unto god what is god's, okay? It doesn't say one damn thing in there about rendering nothin' unto leon.
SUPFEMALE:But, mom no, d.j. ! would you get off my back? Even god took a day off! he's just goin' through a faze! he'll get over it! Oh, man.
LEADMALE:That delivery guy is cute! Wait'll he finds out he's gay.
LEADFEMALE:Umlook, leon.
LEADFEMALE:There's somethin' we gotta tell ya.
OTHERMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Um, this is the second free stove that they've delivered by mistake, and we sold the other one.
OTHERMALE:So jackie, give him his cut of the money.
LEADFEMALE:There.
SUPMALE:Wow! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne.
SUPMALE:Youyou could have kept this.
OTHERMALE:And you didn't.
LEADMALE:But here's the thing.
LEADFEMALE:That third stove? That's different.
SUPMALE:That can't stay.
LEADFEMALE:You gotta tell the guy to take it back, or else i will.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You're a more honest woman than i ever knew.
LEADFEMALE:Well, as long as you feel good about yourself.
SUPMALE:Oh, you'll understand when your kid's older.
LEADMALE:At least now i can look d.j. in the face.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:But if they send a fourth stove, we're keeping it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, of course.
LEADMALE:We're not fanatics.
LEADFEMALE: oh, hi.
LEADMALE:I'm bev harris' daughter.
LEADMALE:Is she okay? Yes.
LEADMALE:It's just a hairline fracture in the pelvis.
SUPFEMALE:We're releasing her tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Just make sure she gets plenty of rest while she's at your house.
LEADFEMALE:At our house? Yes, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Harris told us she'd be staying with you during her convalescence.
OTHERFEMALE:That's great! The love of one's family is often the most powerful remedy.
SUPFEMALE:She's a goner.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, that woman is not staying at our house.
SUPMALE:Oh, please, dan.
SUPMALE:Please, can't i have the most horrible woman in the world living in my house? please? please? please? Listen to me, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Her retirement home is set up to handle injured old people.
SUPMALE:When you go in there, you are not allowed to let her give you any guilt.
LEADFEMALE:All right, dan, i can deflect mom's guilt rays, as long as i have an outlet.
SUPMALE:Ow! Ooh, i gotta clip these.
SUPMALE:Hi, mom.
LEADMALE:How are you? Oh, hello, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:We came by the apartment to help you move that couch and they told us you were in here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't worry.
LEADMALE:Even if you had arrived on time, i probably still would've fallen.
LEADMALE:Of course, who knows what damage was caused by delaying medical attention.
LEADFEMALE:Well, mom, you know, i called your house about a hundred times to tell you i was gonna be late, but nobody ever answered.
SUPMALE:Forgive me.
SUPMALE:It's hard to reach the phone when you're shiverin' in agony on the shower floor.
SUPFEMALE:Thank god those cleaning people keep their appointments.
LEADMALE:The cleaning people found you? Well, bev, maybe we should let you rest.
SUPMALE:Ow! You know, i feel really bad about this, mom.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so do i.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:And dan feels even worse, as you can tell.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't blame yourself, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Besides, you're not the one who never got around to putting those appliqués on my slippery shower floor.
OTHERMALE:Damn! Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:Dan forgot to do that? Uhman, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he was gonna do it last weekend, but he was very busy.
LEADMALE:I think there was some kind of sports program on.
SUPFEMALE:Bev, would you like to stay at our h-at our house? Oh, dan, that's so nice of you.
SUPFEMALE:I graciously accept.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's just great, honey.
LEADFEMALE:And if you need me for anything, i'll be stayin' at mom's.
LEADMALE:Ow! Left side for barros.
LEADFEMALE:And back for sean green-please stop watching me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Am i bothering you? Yes, you are.
SUPMALE:Oh, i didn't mean to.
OTHERMALE:But it's just whenever i see men watching one of these games, i wonder what could possibly be going on inside his head.
LEADMALE:Aw, you don't wanna know.
SUPMALE:What's that noise? That's a tie.
LEADMALE:That means they're goin' into overtime.
LEADMALE:Does that mean they get paid more? No, it means-yes, that's exactly what it means.
LEADFEMALE:What are you guys watching? The bulls and the sixers.
LEADMALE:Those are basketball teams.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i really should take my nap.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're not leavin'? But i'll need two strong men to lift my tired old legs into bed.
SUPMALE:Uh, i gotta go.
LEADFEMALE:There's-me too! You're slow, but i'll bet you're strong.
LEADFEMALE:Coming, boys? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I hope she doesn't want us to apply that ointment again.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, fred.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Look, i gotta talk to you guys about somethin', but you gotta promise me you're not gonna tell anyone.
LEADFEMALE:Cross my heart and hope to die.
SUPFEMALE:Course, with bev staying at my place, either way, i win.
LEADMALE:I'm thinkin' about proposing to jackie.
SUPMALE:That's great.
SUPFEMALE:You think so? Absolutely.
SUPMALE:But remember, if she says "yes", you gotta marry her.
LEADMALE:Well, you guys like being married, don't you? Well i love being married because i'm married to the greatest girl in the whole world.
OTHERMALE:Oh, give me a minute.
OTHERMALE:But you're happy, right? I mean, i've been watching you a lot lately and i think i want what you have.
LEADMALE:Great! I'll have my stuff packed and be out by supper.
LEADMALE:Listen, man, if you need someone to tell you what to do-then you're ready to get married.
LEADMALE:Jackie makes me laugh.
LEADMALE:We have a really good time together.
SUPFEMALE:And i really love her.
LEADFEMALE:Chicks can't get enough of that.
SUPMALE:Alright, i think i'm gonna do it.
SUPMALE:Think i'm gonna actually propose to her.
SUPMALE:That's great, man.
LEADFEMALE:How the hell do you actually do that? hey, dan, how did you handle the proposal? I said "yes.
LEADFEMALE:" how 'bout you, mark? how did you propose to becky? Oh, we didn't really get engaged; we kind of eloped.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you had to ask her, right? i mean, what were you and becky doing when you actually popped the question? Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:Well, you-you see-make somethin' up, mark.
SUPMALE:We were, uh, dancing.
LEADMALE:At a boy.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:My toes feel much better.
OTHERFEMALE:It's your mother's head.
LEADMALE:Hello? hello, bev? are you there? Maybe it's death.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, jake.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, roseanne and jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Am i right? You're right.
LEADMALE:And the fact that you've seen us both every week for the last year, don't let that take nothin' away from your victory.
LEADFEMALE:So, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Have a seat.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, thank you.
LEADMALE:Listen, i came about bev.
OTHERFEMALE:You wanna talk to her? I'd like to, but she doesn't wanna talk to me.
OTHERMALE:Every time i call her, she hangs up.
LEADMALE:What's your secret? I know she's embarrassed about what happened, but i wish she wouldn't be mad at me.
LEADMALE:What's there to feel embarrassed about? It happens all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's never happened to me before.
SUPFEMALE:And bev looked like it was the first time for her too.
SUPFEMALE:You were there.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:She-she didn't tell you it was me? Uh, yeah, well, you know, she said it was somebody, but, oh, she didn't say a definite name, but i knew that it was you, and i says, oh, i know it's gotta be jake.
LEADMALE:And remember that, jackie? You go, "oh, that's definitely jake.
OTHERMALE:" yeah, well, you know, bev is-she's so sweet, but she's so old-fashioned when it comes to intimate things.
SUPMALE:Whoa, now.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you know, jake, when mom confided in me, she kinda made, uh-well, she kinda made you look bad, frankly, and so why don't you just tell us your side of the story.
LEADMALE:You could leave stuff out if you want.
LEADMALE:Look, it happened because, uh-well, it's been a while for both of us and i can't balance the way i used to.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my god, they were trying to balance.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, girls, i did everything i could.
LEADMALE:When we hit the floor, i just wish it was me who was on the bottom.
SUPMALE:And then i dressed her.
LEADFEMALE:She was naked? Holy hannah.
SUPMALE:Well, i think she wouldn't be that mad at me if those jokers down at the retirement home hadn't have come up with that awful nickname.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, those jerks.
OTHERMALE:What was it again? Craftmatic adjustable bev.
LEADMALE:That's very bad.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, please talk to bev about this for me, will ya? god, don't you think it oughta be you doin' it, jake? i mean, you know, one on one, face to face, in a letter? please? please? Yeah, alright.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, i'll tell ya, bev is lucky.
LEADMALE:Bev is lucky.
SUPMALE:You girls are the best.
SUPMALE:Well no! back! I don't need no broken pelvis there.
SUPMALE:You're funny, just like your mother.
LEADMALE:So when are you gonna talk to mom? When i can do it with the ouija board.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Gotta do it now, roseanne, 'cause she's humiliated.
SUPMALE:Unless she works through it, she's never gonna go back to the retirement home.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie jackie, i cannot have a talk about sex with mom.
SUPFEMALE:If she even says the word "intercourse", i'll burst into flame.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, do it for dan.
LEADFEMALE:He thinks the whole thing is his fault.
SUPMALE:And you promised jake.
SUPFEMALE:Little jake.
LEADFEMALE:Poor old jake.
LEADMALE:God, you're annoying.
SUPFEMALE:Yes? Mom, i just want you to know that if you need to speak to a doctor, i can arrange it.
LEADMALE:Uh, well thank you, dear.
LEADMALE:I just had the same sex talk with her that she had with me.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:What are we having? Well-use a little lime when you poach the fish! ugh! God, not fish again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it'll be okay.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, your mother is never slipping and falling down again.
LEADMALE:Do you know why? mm? Because when she's all well, i'm sewing appliqués on the bottom of her feet.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, jackie.
LEADMALE:Hi, mom.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, i think on the way over he made you a little present.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, every day is christmas.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, bev.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, fred.
LEADMALE:I think it's wonderful you're taking your child's mother out to dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:When i had children, i had to scrimp and save.
LEADFEMALE:You're very fortunate.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And when your child asks why he's not goin' to college, just tell him that his mother had a steak.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be in here with dan.
LEADMALE:Still wanna marry into this family? Tonight's the night.
SUPFEMALE:My god, it's a ring.
SUPMALE:It's the coolest box, isn't it? Okay, let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Nice seein' ya, mom! Huh, what was that? what? That, what fred did.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Why? was it some sort of secret macho signal thing, you know? Like this is supposed to be jackie's breast and he's tryin' to tell you that he's gonna get some action tonight, that pig! Trust me, roseanne, that gesture was not dirty.
SUPFEMALE:So what was it? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Okay, fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't tell me what that gesture meant, it's your turn to give mom her sitz bath.
OTHERMALE:Jeez if i tell you, you gotta swear to keep your mouth shut.
OTHERMALE:God, i can't believe that you don't even trust your own wife.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i promise.
LEADMALE:Fred was pointing to the ring he bought 'cause he's gonna propose tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:He's gonna propose to her? Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:Did you see the ring? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, so what did it look like? I have no idea.
LEADMALE:What kind of setting did he have it in? I have no idea.
SUPFEMALE:Was it a diamond? I have no idea.
SUPMALE:God, this is so amazing! Yeah, well, look, i swore i wouldn't tell anybody, so you gotta keep your mouth shut.
LEADMALE:I will.
LEADFEMALE:I mean it! I will.
LEADFEMALE:I mean it.
LEADMALE:I will.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, little sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:God, that was hard.
SUPFEMALE:They left that restaurant an hour-and-a-half-ago.
OTHERFEMALE:How come they're late? Well, maybe her and fred are out celebratin'.
SUPFEMALE:They just had a baby; they are not medically allowed to celebrate yet.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, dan, um we came back 'cause i've got some really big news.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, dan um, fred and i are moving in together.
LEADMALE:You're what? Yeah, we're gonna live together.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't that great? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you happy for us? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Really, really happy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really happy and really surprised.
OTHERMALE:Really, really surprised.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too! My heavens, what's all the ruckus? Mom, um, i've got some news that i think is gonna make you really, really happy, but fred convinced me to tell you anyway.
SUPFEMALE:I know, you're gettin' married.
LEADMALE:Congratulations! No.
LEADFEMALE:Mom-we're moving in together.
SUPFEMALE:God! Why is it every time i have big news, you ruin it by guessing that it's even bigger news? No, i don't.
LEADFEMALE:It's just-well, that's what dan said! You told your mother-in-law? Of course not.
SUPMALE:I told my wife! god, mom, can't you ever keep a secret? wait a minute! You were gonna propose? Well, it had crossed my mind.
OTHERMALE:And what made it uncross? what made you go from asking me to share my life with you to asking me to split the rent? well, i don't know about you guys, but i blame mom! well, you shouldn't blame me! if fred doesn't have the courage to make jackie an honest woman, then perhaps it's best jackie found that out! Hey, bev? Do yourself a big favor.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get into this.
SUPFEMALE:Fred, i have every right to be involved in this.
LEADMALE:Unlike you, i am actually a member of this family.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if i ever do become a member of this family, i can tell you one thing right now.
SUPFEMALE:The next time you break your pelvis having sex, you're not gonna stay at our house! if i understand this correctly, unless you had sex in the shower, none of this is my fault! Guess i wasn't supposed to say that.
SUPMALE:Well, i, uh plan to treat bev with the utmost sensitivity.
SUPMALE:But first, a raucous laugh.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, mom.
SUPMALE:Well, i heard what happened, so, uh, do you wanna talk about it? what's left to talk about? Everybody already knows all of the details of the most humiliating experience of my life-fred, dan, you, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait.
LEADMALE:There's little d.j. what a shame he had to miss this.
LEADFEMALE:You'll catch him up.
LEADFEMALE:Won't you, dear? So everybody knows you had sex.
OTHERFEMALE:Big deal.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like you got in an accident wearing dirty old underpants.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it will never happen again.
LEADFEMALE:I can tell you that much.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mom, now you never were a quitter.
LEADFEMALE:My one attempt with jake and i almost kill myself.
LEADFEMALE:And of course, with your father it was always a disaster.
SUPMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:But you probably don't wanna talk about this.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, no, it's not-it's not that.
LEADMALE:I just think you're probably more comfortable, you know, talkin' to your friends.
SUPMALE:My friends? Yes, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I should talk to my friends.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i mean, unless you wanna talk to me, then, you know, i'm here for ya.
LEADMALE:So, i guess the thing is you've never really had uh, any good sexual experiences.
SUPFEMALE:Well, your father was good in the sense that he never took longer than the commercials.
OTHERMALE:That's terrible.
LEADMALE:Love-making is for men.
LEADFEMALE:They enjoy it very much.
LEADFEMALE:But i'd just as soon be knitting.
SUPMALE:Well, it can be enjoyable for you, mom.
LEADMALE:It can be really enjoyable, you know? All's you really need is just to have a partner who is, you know, giving and caring, and i really think that jake is like that.
LEADMALE:So, you like it? Yeah, mom, i like it.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't think i'll ever enjoy it.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:All you gotta do is you just tell the man what you like and what you don't like.
LEADMALE:Didn't jake do anything that, you know that you liked? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Do you wanna tell me what it was? Well, he rubbed my shoulders.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's really nice.
LEADMALE:That's good.
SUPMALE:Well, you should tell him, you know, that you enjoyed that.
LEADMALE:And then later, you can tell him, you know, more intimate things that you like.
SUPMALE:Well, i never had a chance to learn what i like.
SUPFEMALE:That's really, really sad.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know, maybe it would help if you tell me what you like.
LEADMALE:Uhi like it when dan rubs my shoulders too.
SUPMALE:Just like you.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that funny? what are the odds? So this is what it's like to be a modern woman.
LEADMALE:Oh, i would've been so uncomfortable having this conversation with my mother.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it's amazing how things have changed.
SUPMALE:Bev, that was marvelous.
OTHERMALE:You're really giving and caring, and you really worked out that balance problem.
LEADMALE:You seem so much freer and so much more sure of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i talked to my daughter and she told me not to be afraid to ask for what i want.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, you know, jake, i wouldn't mind trying again.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, go easy on me.
OTHERFEMALE:You know i'm not alright.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:I left the light on in the living room.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:I need to know, bo, does vicky really love sloan? or is there a chance i can win her back? what are you doing? I'm watching my stories.
SUPFEMALE:Bo really loves nora, but the court case is tearing them apart.
LEADFEMALE:And cord is helping out luna-oh! I just dropped your baby.
LEADFEMALE:Shh! in a second! Oh, jackie.
OTHERMALE:You're not gonna get what you want from these soap opera guys.
LEADMALE:They can only love you for an hour a day.
SUPFEMALE:'course, that is four times longer than dan.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they may not really exist, but they're better than fred.
LEADMALE:I am not gonna let this happened to you, jackie.
LEADMALE:You're turning into that scary old lady down the block with the satellite dish and the tall grass.
LEADMALE:Hey, jackie! Get rid of him.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I came by to talk to jackie.
LEADMALE:Think it's a good idea? sure, you got your dental records, don't ya? I didn't mean to hurt her feelings, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I was gonna propose and everything, but it just seemed like a more sensible idea for us to live together.
LEADFEMALE:Well, aren't you just jackie's knight in sensible armor.
LEADFEMALE:What's she been doing the last couple of days? She's been comparing you to these soap opera guys.
LEADFEMALE:Guess who's ahead? Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose she wants me to be more like this guy.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:That guy's in love with his mailman.
SUPMALE:But maybe some of these other guys.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i don't understand this romantic stuff.
LEADFEMALE:What am i supposed to do? I don't know, but you should do something just for her, real special.
OTHERMALE:Like what? I don't know! But it should be, like, you know, big and dramatic.
SUPFEMALE:She's always hated that beard.
LEADMALE:My beard? Hey, i've had this beard since high school.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i know, but you were just wearing it then so you could look old.
OTHERMALE:Trust me, you don't need it no more.
LEADMALE:I always thought my beard made me look more interesting.
SUPMALE:You know, i've talked to a lot of women, and they say that the only interesting thing about you is jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all right.
LEADMALE:I love this beard.
LEADMALE:But if you think shaving it off is gonna prove something to her, i'll give it a try.
LEADMALE:Thanks, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:No problem.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what'd you do that for? I don't hate his beard.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i know, but it always kinda bugged me.
OTHERMALE:Who's your mommy? huh? who's your mommy? Maybe you'd have a better idea who his mommy is if his mommy would just give in and marry his daddy.
LEADMALE:Who's your annoying old hag, huh? So fred didn't propose last time.
SUPMALE:I bet he would if the next time he came over, you were wearing a nice dress and maybe a little lipstick.
LEADFEMALE:He's a pig.
SUPFEMALE:He's a pig with a steady job.
OTHERMALE:Nothing but the best for your little girl, huh, mom? Why, it's darlene and young david! I bought a rattle for the baby.
LEADMALE:Just thought i'd drop it off.
SUPMALE:Oh, david, how sweet! David's always thrilled to meet someone smaller than him.
LEADMALE:He's so cute.
OTHERMALE:I just love him.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you wanna hold him? yes! uh, it's just like a cat, right? grab it by the back of the neck? That's a boy! Sure.
SUPFEMALE:There's a boy.
SUPFEMALE:Now what? Now just hold him and enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ho, ho okay, i'm done.
SUPMALE:Oh how can you be done? Look at his little hat.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't he make you wanna have a baby? No, i don't like kids.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't even like myself till i was 14.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:So, you don't wanna have kids? I mean, i thought we were gonna be together.
SUPMALE:What if i want one? Well, you're gonna have to plant your seed somewhere else, farmer bob.
LEADFEMALE:So, what i want doesn't count at all? I mean, having my baby would be a wonderful way of saying how much you love me.
LEADFEMALE:Hearing you say that, david, my new goal in life is to die barren.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't be silly, darlene.
OTHERMALE:Women were made to make babies.
LEADFEMALE:The end! Oh, god, not even you could believe that crap, right, david? Well, you all seem to be pretty good at it.
LEADMALE:So, what are you saying, it's a woman's job to have children? i mean, can you really be that sexist? me? I am not sexist.
SUPFEMALE:I am much too frightened of women to be sexist.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then what did you mean? I didn't mean it was a job.
LEADMALE:I just think that it's every woman's satisfying, fulfilling obligation.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:This is not my opinion.
SUPMALE:This is just nature.
LEADMALE:I mean, you can't see that 'cause you're just being irrational.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're right, david.
LEADMALE:I'm not being rational.
LEADMALE:I know, i must have my period or something, right? i would never say that, but are you? David, i just changed my mind about premarital sex.
LEADMALE:Darlene she always gets like that.
LEADMALE:Did i tell you i like his little hat? Stay away from my son.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't mind jackie, david.
LEADFEMALE:I think her friend is visiting.
LEADMALE:What? what's the matter? Jackie just told me what you said to darlene, and i cannot believe you.
SUPMALE:She didn't understand me.
LEADFEMALE:She said that you told her that having a baby was her obligation.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess she did understand me.
OTHERFEMALE:Women.
LEADMALE:How can she think i'm anti-woman? She's your wife.
LEADMALE:Compared to you, i am a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Compared to a woman, you're a woman.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe it just so happens that i'm secure enough with my masculinity to be a woman.
LEADMALE:Dave, your problem is women expect a lot from you.
LEADFEMALE:When you turn out to be just another guy, then they're all let down.
SUPFEMALE:You think it's better for women not to expect much of you? Sure, then any little thing you do, they love you for.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mark.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't usually help me out like this.
OTHERFEMALE:We should talk more often.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i'd like to.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But right now, i gotta run upstairs.
LEADMALE:When i tell becky i think you're a sexist jerk, it's gonna pay off big! Got another one for ya.
SUPMALE:Where'd you get that? I'm already washing every dish in the house.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i'd like to help, but i think there's a game on.
LEADMALE:All right, enjoy yourself.
LEADMALE:I'm just gonna keep doing dishes.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i noticed that there's still some skin left on my hands.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you guys.
OTHERFEMALE:See, dan? what'd i tell ya? He does have a weak and characterless chin.
LEADMALE:I gotta talk to jackie right away becausei think i know what she wants.
LEADMALE:I been watching her soaps.
LEADMALE:Jackie? We gotta talk.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:Fred, you keep showing up, you think eventually i'll change my mind? will you marry me? don't you think we should leave? We should, but pipe down.
OTHERMALE:Fred, i don't feel like i can give you an answer right now.
LEADFEMALE:That's good, 'cause i don't want your answer yet.
OTHERMALE:First i want to take you away, to a cabin by lake geneva.
SUPFEMALE:I rented a red one, right on the water, just like the one you used to dream about when you were a little girl.
LEADFEMALE:And then, i want to sit in front of the fireplace, and i wanna drink champagne and just look at you.
LEADMALE:And i don't want you to answer me until midnight.
LEADFEMALE:Because that way, if you say no, i'll have had at least one perfect night with you.
SUPFEMALE:You can watch the kid, can't ya? Aw.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't know about you, but i had a tough time keeping a straight face through that one.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh, come on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't you see what was going on? Old freddy was in the doghouse and he barked his way out.
SUPMALE:Ah, damn.
LEADMALE:No game on.
SUPFEMALE:I do not believe you, dan.
LEADMALE:The most romantic thing we'll probably ever witness in our lives, right here, in our own house, and it doesn't even touch you in the least bit.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, touch me.
LEADFEMALE:Who said it didn't touch me.
LEADFEMALE:I just-ooh, look, rugby.
SUPMALE:We have no romance in our lives! What are you talkin' about? I'm very romantic.
LEADMALE:Your idea of romance is popping the can away from my face.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
LEADMALE:We're too old for what that stuff jackie and fred are gonna do there.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, we got stuff that's better than romance.
LEADFEMALE:We got, uh, memories of romance.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just gonna watch this game, if that's okay.
SUPMALE:You don't need the game, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You've got memories of games.
LEADMALE:I must remember to beat fred.
OTHERMALE:Well, so you joined us at last.
LEADMALE:This is most truly a wonderful surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Well, my marriage has finally hit the skids.
OTHERMALE:I'm all yours, boyd.
LEADFEMALE:Now that you're here, my thirst is quenched.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold on, you two.
SUPMALE:You may be my brother, and you may be my son, but this is a woman.
LEADMALE:A woman i'm not related to.
OTHERFEMALE:Out of my way.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:I'm looking for romance, but i can't have all of you.
LEADFEMALE:At least, not at the same time.
LEADMALE:If you'll be mine, my darling, i can give you everything you've always wanted.
SUPMALE:Wow! I've always wanted everything that i've always wanted.
LEADFEMALE:Don't listen to him.
LEADMALE:Okay? Because what you need is a soul mate.
LEADFEMALE:Someone who can extinguish the loneliness burning in your soul.
LEADMALE:Someone who knows your deepest, darkest thoughts.
LEADMALE:Man, this guy is good.
LEADMALE:He really knows what goes on inside of us women.
LEADFEMALE:It's true.
OTHERMALE:I do know what's going on inside of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? can you hear this? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Can you hear this? Wow! Talk about being in sync.
LEADMALE:What about you, cord? Wow! Good answer.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i'm home! cheese it, it's my husband! Hey, i thought i kicked you out.
SUPMALE:No, you kicked out dan conner.
SUPFEMALE:I have returned as dan juan.
LEADMALE:How come you don't smell like cars? Because i am wearing cologne.
LEADMALE:Where'd you get that? You better not have watered down any of my jean nate.
LEADMALE:No, it's my own.
OTHERMALE:It come in the mail.
LEADFEMALE:From the vintage sellers at the a&p.
SUPMALE:Wow, wine! We haven't had wine since the night we, uh, celebrated the odometer on your truck rolling all the way around to zero again.
LEADFEMALE:Break out the crazy straws, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I am in a mood.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, dan, you know i am a sucker for a man who can harness the power of fire.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Prepare yourself for a little treat.
LEADMALE:Let the romance begin.
OTHERFEMALE:Romancing the bone? yeah, i figured we could pop it in, watch it for a few minutes, and then, you know and then what? barf? i did something wrong, didn't i? No, dan, you just did everything wrong.
SUPFEMALE:This is nothing but disgusting, pornographic filth.
SUPFEMALE:Got romance in the title.
SUPFEMALE:It's just some sick old male fantasy that only appeals to other sick old males.
LEADFEMALE:It can't be just for men.
SUPFEMALE:It's got scenes with only women.
SUPFEMALE:I did this for you.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, if you don't want this, what the hell do you want? We been married 21 years.
SUPMALE:You oughta know what i want by now.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, obviously, i don't.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just tell me and i'll just do it! Because if i have to tell you what it is, then i might as well just go do it myself.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, may i speak with you, please? Hey, dave, we don't need that macho crap in here.
LEADFEMALE:I think i can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:I know you can.
LEADFEMALE:It's just the kind of stuff that this guy says really ticks me off.
OTHERMALE:Makes us all look like pigs.
LEADFEMALE:I put mayo on both sides.
OTHERMALE:Just the way you like it.
LEADMALE:Thanks, babe.
LEADMALE:Darlene, listen.
LEADFEMALE:I realize how unfair i was being to you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh look, the fact is i love you so much that even if you don't wanna have kids, i still wanna be with you forever.
OTHERMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:David, you're never gonna be happy if you don't have kids.
LEADMALE:Well, if you ever change your mind-no pressure-um, and you're willing to have kids, i could be the one to stay home and raise them.
SUPMALE:I could change their diapers and take them to school and do all that stuff.
SUPMALE:You'd do that? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
SUPMALE:I mean, but would you still have time to cook? Of course.
LEADFEMALE:I know how important having a career is to you.
SUPFEMALE:You should have everything you want in life.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:That is so romantic.
SUPFEMALE:Romantic? the guy stays at home while the girl goes out and earns a living? so you wouldn't be willing to do that for me? No, it'd be stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Why would it be stupid? Because there's no way you could ever make as much as me.
LEADFEMALE:That's because the world is so unfair to women.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, cord.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so glad i picked you.
LEADMALE:To hell with those other guys.
LEADFEMALE:And their shirts.
OTHERFEMALE:Perhaps a sweet? Wow, this looks like real antique china! Yes.
SUPMALE:I would never dream of asking you to soil your delicate hands washing dishes.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, you sure do talk pretty for a man.
SUPMALE:And tonight, beneath the stars, i plan to serenade you.
LEADMALE:Dan did that only once, and he had his hand under his armpit.
SUPMALE:A night of romance is what i have in store for you, girl.
SUPMALE:A night you will never forget.
LEADMALE:But first, we must share this.
SUPFEMALE:Romancing the bone? I'm home, dan.
OTHERMALE:So get out.
LEADMALE:It's my turn in the house.
SUPFEMALE:Hark, the sound of angels.
OTHERMALE:Welcome home, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I got a little surprise for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, not again.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I watched your soap, just like fred, and, you know, i think i learned a few things.
OTHERMALE:Surprise! oh, dan, you cleaned up! No, i cooked dinner.
LEADMALE:Who says you can't put a metal pan in a microwave.
LEADMALE:You know, i really appreciate the effort, honey, but you don't get it.
LEADMALE:So please don't try anymore.
LEADFEMALE:What, candlelight dinner, that's romantic, isn't it? Yeah, if there wasn't seagulls hovering above the sink.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i guess i could wash those, or oh, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I got an idea.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, maybe it'd make your life easier if i gave you this.
LEADFEMALE:What? Yes, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:R.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, of lanford, illinois.
LEADMALE:Say hello to your only slightly used dishwasher.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god! Pretty great, isn't it? I was watching them soap operas, and i didn't know what the hell they were talking about, but man, they got commercials for all kinds of dishwashing stuff.
SUPMALE:Did you know that glasses aren't supposed to have spots? Oh, dan, i love you, despite your many flaws.
LEADMALE:And i love you, despite my many flaws.
LEADMALE:So, is there something special i can do for you? If i had to tell you, it wouldn't be romantic.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Man, this thing is so cool to watch.
LEADMALE:We should take it out there in the living room and trade in the tv for more dishes.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna get another beer.
OTHERFEMALE:You want one? Yeah, but put mine in a glass and bring it to me on a plate.
LEADMALE:I'm back! so, did you say yes? I said yes! Congratulations, man.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, thanks.
LEADMALE:How's that traffic? Not bad.
LEADMALE:So, where's the baby? 'cause i wanna tell him his daddy's gonna be his daddy.
OTHERMALE:Eh, you pulled it off, huh? Yeah, well, i couldn't even believe it myself, but turns out, uh, i'm kind of great at this romantic stuff.
LEADMALE:So, anytime you need any pointers, i'm here for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i'm not an expert like you, but after 21 years of marriage, there is a little trick i learned that, you know, i could pass on to you.
SUPFEMALE:Really? what is it? Oh, you're just being nice.
LEADMALE:You don't want my advice.
LEADMALE:No, seriously.
SUPFEMALE:I'm curious.
LEADFEMALE:Surprise her with this.
LEADMALE:Yeah, show that to jackie tonight, it drives women crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i'm here for you, buddy.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You ready to go? Yeah, as soon as i finish this mom crap.
SUPMALE:Hello? Yeah yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah! Well, isn't that cute? D.j. just closed his first drug deal.
SUPMALE:What's he up to? I have no idea, but i have a feeling that it threatens all that is good and decent in the world.
LEADMALE:D.j. , get out here! Breakfast is ready.
LEADMALE:Yuck.
LEADFEMALE:These aren't the microwave kind.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:The microwave died this morning.
LEADMALE:It's okay to cry.
LEADMALE:Your dad did.
SUPMALE:I only like the frozen ones.
OTHERMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:They'll be ready in an hour.
LEADFEMALE:I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:Where's my lunch? Right there.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna look like a dork carrying this.
LEADMALE:Yes, you will, but this way people might think it's the bag.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate tuna.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna eat this.
LEADMALE:Hey, i worked hard to make that tuna sandwich.
SUPMALE:You're gonna take it, you're gonna go to school, and at lunch you're gonna trade it for somethin' decent.
LEADFEMALE:Fine! What's his problem? Well, i've seen it before.
LEADMALE:He's 12, he's crabby, he's becoming a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, it happens so fast.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, i guess he has to take over for darlene since satan transferred her to chicago.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks for the teabags.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind if i take this lemon and the coffee mug and that teakettle, too, unless you got a newer one? jackie! well, i gotta furnish a house! Well, hey, why don't you weasel stuff out of people the classy way? Throw yourself a housewarming party.
LEADMALE:I can't do that.
SUPMALE:If i have a party, i have to invite mom, and she'll come.
LEADFEMALE:Then she'll be there.
SUPMALE:All right, fine.
OTHERMALE:I'll throw you a surprise party, and i won't tell mom.
SUPFEMALE:Okay? And if she finds out about it, i'll take the heat.
SUPFEMALE:No, you won't take the heat.
LEADFEMALE:You'll cave in and ask her.
LEADFEMALE:I will not.
LEADFEMALE:You have no idea how much i will not cave.
SUPFEMALE:And i know just what to tell people to get you, too.
LEADFEMALE:A microwave.
SUPMALE:I don't need a microwave.
LEADFEMALE:You're the one that needs a microwave.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it just great when all the parts of your brain start workin' together as a team? george? Yeah, she's gone.
SUPFEMALE:You can come over now.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, i know a microwave's expensive, but you shouldn't be so selfish.
SUPMALE:You should think about jackie for a change.
SUPMALE:Well, maybemaybe she could use a a, uh, a car.
LEADMALE:No, a car would be crazy.
OTHERMALE:A mustache comb.
LEADMALE:No, that's even better.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you can never have too many bye.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a teakettle.
LEADFEMALE:No, this is a teakettle.
OTHERFEMALE:That is a teapot.
SUPMALE:Oh, god! Here comes fred.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, jackie's little huggums.
LEADMALE:He's not my little huggums, and he's not invited to that party.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you ought to give fred a chance.
SUPMALE:He's one of your better sleazy one-night stands that you've ever had.
LEADFEMALE:You should get to know him vertically.
OTHERFEMALE:Just let me handle it, okay? Tell him i'm not here.
LEADMALE:Hey, roseanne, is jackie around? Jackie, did you want me to tell him that you're gone or that you just stepped out?! Thanks a lot, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Well, we both knew i was gonna do it.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, jackie.
OTHERMALE:Hi, fred.
LEADFEMALE:This is where you leave.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Well, you can't tell with his clothes on, but i'll believe you.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, i know you didn't want to talk about this before, but i just gotta tell you.
SUPFEMALE:I had a really nice time the other night.
LEADMALE:Well, of course you did, fred.
OTHERFEMALE:We had sex.
LEADMALE:Sex? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I remember now.
LEADFEMALE:That was right after dinner and right before i thanked you for an hour.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Fred, you're very sweet-did you get the flowers? I got the flowers.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you get the candy? Yeah, i got the candy.
LEADMALE:Did you get the 20 bucks on the end table? Fred! Stop it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:I made a dinner reservation for tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Listen, jackie, if we're gonna have sex again, i need to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, i'm just not really ready to have a relationship now.
SUPMALE:Then we can be friends.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm--i'm not ready to be friends.
OTHERMALE:Then what are you ready for? Well, i was ready for the sex, and now i'm done.
SUPMALE:Fred, i got out of a really bad relationship, and i'm not ready to trust someone yet.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to go out with you again.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna beg.
SUPFEMALE:Just understand this-once i walk out that door you'll be able to reach me at any time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, why can't we invite him to the party? We need at least one decent person.
LEADMALE:Whatever happened to the old-fashioned guys who slept with you once and never bothered to call gain? You've been through 'em all.
SUPMALE:Ah, the smell of dead calves and onions.
SUPMALE:I'm home.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, you.
LEADMALE:Hey, honey, i get the first hug.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the one that gave up cigarettes and alcohol for four months.
LEADMALE:Isn't that honky? so, what's happeni'' with the big gal on campus? Well, biff and todd invited me to the sigma chi dance, but it was the same time as the tri delt formal, so i spent all my drink-beer bonds and finally passed out on beta gamma's lawn.
LEADFEMALE:I slept right through the big game.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that takes me back.
LEADMALE:What's she doin' here? You said david wasn't gonna be around.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I thought you meant david cassidy.
LEADFEMALE:I know how much you, uh, hate him.
LEADMALE:Oh, so this was your little plan.
LEADMALE:You get us in the same room, and then we just make up just like that, and everything would be great.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, my plan was that you would come home and figure out my plan and then be all mad about it.
LEADMALE:And you fell for it.
SUPMALE:I'm goin' back to school.
LEADMALE:No, you're not, 'cause i'm not givin' you any bus money till sunday.
OTHERMALE:For the next two days, we are all gonna pretend that we are one happy, happy family.
SUPMALE:Bite it big time, high school boy.
SUPFEMALE:Shove it.
LEADMALE:Oh, i just love it when a plan comes together.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doin' here? I'msick.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so you're skippin' school, huh? Darlene, please don't tell mom! please! Quit begging.
LEADMALE:The last thing i want to do is help her out.
OTHERFEMALE:But she's gonna know what's goin' on the minute she waddles through that door.
LEADMALE:How come? Clues, bonehead.
LEADFEMALE:Mom monitors the chips.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:See, i put these back in the cabinet, and before she finds 'em, i say, "who ate all the chips?" and then mom thinks dad did, and dad thinks mom did, and then they get into a big fight.
LEADMALE:Good one, deej.
LEADMALE:Have you written a note yet? Yep.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice crumpling.
LEADMALE:Detracts from the handwriting, yet leaves the note legible.
SUPMALE:D.j. , this signature is pathetic.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with it? Well, moms usually sign their name without erasing a bunch of times.
LEADMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:Here's how mom signs her name.
LEADMALE:Now, take this upstairs and practice for a couple hours.
OTHERMALE:A couple of hours? I might as well be in school! Well, yeah, but unlike what you learn in sixth grade, forgery's a skill you can use the rest of your life.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene, how come you're being so nice to me? Ah, you're wise to be suspicious.
SUPMALE:But you see, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, grasshopper.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What's for dinner? Well, because it's darlene's first night back, i'm making vegetarian lasagna.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
SUPMALE:I used meat.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
OTHERMALE:Now, don't hold that too close to your crotch.
SUPFEMALE:We're tryin' to have a baby.
LEADMALE:What happened to the chips? dan, did you eat the chips? I didn't eat the chips.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i didn't eat 'em.
SUPMALE:This is the exact same chip fight we had yesterday.
LEADMALE:Yeah, 'cause you called me a hog.
OTHERMALE:Well, then you called me a cow.
SUPFEMALE:And didn't d.j. start the whole thing? I ate the chips.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, that's just great, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Now we're not gonna have a crunchy crust on the lasagna.
OTHERMALE:Well, whoever ate the chips has to set the table.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene, need some help? D.j. , don't tease your sister.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, deej.
LEADMALE:You wanna grab the silverware? Okay.
LEADMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, come quick.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Something's wrong with the children.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, d.j. , forks go on the left.
LEADMALE:The way i remember is that "fork" and "left" both have four letters.
OTHERMALE:Cool.
SUPMALE:Hey, darlene, i just thought of another one.
LEADFEMALE:"knife" and "right" both have five letters.
SUPFEMALE:Good one, deej.
SUPMALE:Oh, i'm a-scared, rosie, i'm a-scared.
LEADMALE:Hello? Uhmrs.
LEADMALE:Conner doesn't live here.
LEADMALE:You need to call next-door! darlene! What? That was my school.
LEADMALE:I think they know.
OTHERMALE:Well, how many days did you miss last week? Five.
SUPFEMALE:Brilliant, d.j. don't you know if you miss a whole week, they always check? I didn't know! what am i gonna do?! He shouldn't be skippin' school, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:If your mother asks me, i'm not gonna lie to her.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Be a wimp.
SUPFEMALE:No, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:The whole time i was with you, i was a wimp.
LEADFEMALE:Now i'm strong.
LEADFEMALE:It's too bad you picked such a stupid thing to be strong about.
SUPFEMALE:You're just mad 'cause you can't control me anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know why i ever even bothered to control you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you think that i'm gonna-aaahh! Way to keep your cool, deej.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Yeah, this is mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, d.j. 's been real sick.
LEADFEMALE:It's--it's some sort of stomach bug.
SUPMALE:We've all got it.
SUPMALE:Well, i--i feel like i gotta throw up right now.
LEADMALE:No, it's all right.
OTHERMALE:It's a cordless.
LEADMALE:You can come along.
LEADMALE:See? Yeah! sucker! Careful, deej.
OTHERMALE:He's strong now.
OTHERMALE:I don't like deliverin' in this part of town.
SUPFEMALE:There's some scary types down there.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, if you see d.j. down there, tell him to be home by 6.
SUPFEMALE:You figure out what he's up to yet? No, not yet.
SUPFEMALE:This one is gonna take some thought.
LEADMALE:You know, he's workin' with a professional this time.
LEADMALE:Darlene's just gettin' back at your pathetic plan to get her and david together again.
LEADMALE:Pathetic? I'll tell you what's pathetic: a 37-year-old delivery girl.
LEADFEMALE:Fine! then you take it! fine! i will! And then you can wait on fred.
LEADMALE:Here he comes.
OTHERFEMALE:Send him after me, and i swear i'll hit him with a bag of buns! Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, fred.
LEADMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I heard jackie's havi'' a housewarming party.
LEADFEMALE:I really need you to get me invited.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't know, fred.
SUPFEMALE:It's really not my, uh, style to interfere in other people's lives.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I need you on my side here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd be so grateful if you could help me out.
OTHERMALE:Gratefulenough to buy jackie a really nice gift? what do you mean? likejewelry? Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:Like, you know, jewelry.
LEADMALE:Or a microwave.
SUPMALE:A microwave.
SUPMALE:I guess you don't know beans about women, huh, fred? Umsee, uh, this early in the relationship, jewelry would kinda say, "here i am.
LEADFEMALE:I plan to smother you.
OTHERFEMALE:" whereas a microwave kinda goes like, "i like you.
SUPMALE:Let's have some popcorn.
LEADMALE:" it seems to me the last time i was over at your house, dan was working on your microwave.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What are the odds? so, what kind of a microwave did you have in mind for jackie? Well, she's a single gal, soshe'll need a big one.
LEADMALE:Got it.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, fred how would you like to come to jackie's housewarming party? Why, roseanne i'd love to.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's been a pleasure doing business with you, fred.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? If you hurry, you mightcatch jackie out back.
OTHERMALE:Really? Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Watch out for buns.
LEADMALE:Hello, roseanne.
SUPMALE:I hope i'm not botherin' you.
SUPFEMALE:I know how busy you can get plannin' a party.
LEADFEMALE:What party? Oh, why, mom, certainly you haven't forgotten the happy, happy family surprise party we're throwin' for jackie's housewarming.
SUPMALE:I suppose i know why i wasn't invited.
LEADMALE:I already gave my gift-the house.
LEADFEMALE:Well, um, mom, see okay.
LEADMALE:All right, i'll tell ya.
LEADMALE:It's not just a housewarming party for jackie.
LEADMALE:It was also going to be a surprise thank-you party for you for lending jackie the down payment money.
LEADFEMALE:It is?! Yes, but darlene wrecked the surprise and nearly ruined our happy, happy family.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne, i'm sorry, but i don't want a big party.
SUPMALE:Well it's too late.
LEADMALE:But i'll be embarrassed if everyone buys me a present.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i can take care of that.
OTHERMALE:This is so touching! i don't know what to say! Well, see you sunday.
OTHERMALE:So.
SUPMALE:I guess now the score is even.
LEADFEMALE:Things can get back to normal.
SUPMALE:Now you can rat out your little brother.
SUPMALE:Come on, d.j. , let's go to the movies.
LEADMALE:My treat.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. here's the deal.
OTHERMALE:You tell me what rotten thing you're up to and i will punish darlene and buy you ice cream.
LEADFEMALE:Don't look at darlene! I haven't been up to anything.
SUPMALE:After you, deej.
SUPMALE:Thanks, sis.
SUPFEMALE:Damn.
SUPFEMALE:Well, well, well.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. look what i found in the garbage.
SUPFEMALE:So? I told you i didn't like it.
LEADMALE:I bought my lunch.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Well, i saw you leave home with it.
LEADFEMALE:So i came back and threw it away.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want anybody to see me with that stupid bag.
LEADFEMALE:Good one.
LEADMALE:It's the truth.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you think that darlene's helpin' you out, but she really isn't.
LEADFEMALE:She tellin' me everything.
LEADFEMALE:This whole thing is just a big plan that we worked out to set you up.
LEADMALE:No, it isn't.
OTHERMALE:How can you be sure? 'cause darlene told me you'd say that.
OTHERMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:David, you're not a blood relative.
LEADMALE:I think you may have an honest gene left in your body.
LEADFEMALE:What's goin' on with d.j. ? I don't know anything, mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Very impressive, darlene.
LEADMALE:Very impressive.
LEADMALE:I saw what just happened.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i didn't do it 'cause you wanted me to.
LEADMALE:I did it 'cause i'm mad at your mother.
LEADMALE:Besides, lying just seemed like the right thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it usually is.
SUPFEMALE:Watch out, darlene.
LEADMALE:You said somethin' to me without an insult.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tired.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i'm not seeing anybody.
SUPMALE:Are you? Nah.
LEADMALE:Although i am sleeping with several people.
SUPFEMALE:You are? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Mostly professors, mostly for grades.
LEADMALE:I miss you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Are we making up? I hope so.
OTHERMALE:Okay, but just don't tell mom.
LEADMALE:I don't want her to think her little plan worked.
LEADMALE:You're not askin' me to lie again, are you no.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm tellin' you to.
LEADMALE:We're back.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Hello? Just a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, mom! Thanks, son.
LEADFEMALE:How's mom's lunch comin'? Hello.
LEADMALE:Yes, this is mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:He hasn't been able to make it.
OTHERMALE:He's been very sick.
LEADFEMALE:Don't mess with the master, darlene.
LEADMALE:You guys are in so much trouble.
LEADMALE:I'm going to make you wish i was never born.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and by the way, i know that you and david made up, too.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you find out? You just told me.
LEADMALE:D.j. , come on.
LEADMALE:I'm walkin' you to school today.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:You're not goin' in that, are you? Oh, no, d.j. i wouldn't do that to you.
SUPFEMALE:But i would do this.
LEADMALE:And, look.
SUPFEMALE:I found your old sesame street lunchbox, so you won't have to be embarrassed with those big brown bags anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my.
OTHERMALE:Just a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait one minute here.
LEADMALE:This is for when i kiss you good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, come on.
LEADFEMALE:We need to hurry 'cause i've gotta make it up to chicago to surprise your sister.
LEADMALE:I want to get there in time for one of her big classes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to dance for them.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i have a problem.
OTHERFEMALE:The carpet in the corner of my living room is loose.
SUPFEMALE:I need dan to fix it.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, remember when i was 10 years old and i told you you could come to me any time that you had a problem? Well, i was 10! Well, he did build the place.
LEADMALE:You know, he's supposed to fix that stuff.
LEADMALE:What's bugging you? Look what i found in david's room when i was cleaning today.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, that looks like pot.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
LEADMALE:That's pot all right.
LEADFEMALE:Maryjane, stick, weed, dope.
LEADFEMALE:Call it what you like, it's trouble.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes, jackie, you must strike yourself as weird.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you tell dan about it yet? No.
LEADMALE:He's in such a bad mood from work, i'm afraid of what he would do to david.
SUPMALE:Well, just get him in a really good mood, and then you tell him.
LEADMALE:Jackie, i hardly have the time to get dan all liquored up, have sex with him, and make s'mores.
LEADMALE:I will just wait for the perfect moment.
LEADMALE:D.j. ! get off the roof now! He bolted.
LEADMALE:How many times have i told you to stay off the roof? I wasn't on the roof.
LEADFEMALE:Get in your room.
OTHERMALE:You're grounded.
LEADFEMALE:What? Dan, i was the one that told him he could play on the roof.
LEADMALE:I figured it was safer than the park.
SUPFEMALE:I get enough grief at work.
SUPMALE:I don't need it when i come home.
LEADMALE:So you're gonna tell him about the pot? Ha.
LEADMALE:I don't know yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, dan! Uh, jackie's carpet came untacked, and she wants you to fix it immediately.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie can go to hell! No, not the right moment.
OTHERMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, hey, we're with the swedish bikini team.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's our free beer? This is a waste of time.
LEADFEMALE:Getting drunk isn't gonna cheer me up.
LEADFEMALE:True, but you won't irritate me as much.
OTHERFEMALE:The guys at work are really ticking me off.
OTHERMALE:I can't get 'em to listen to me, to take me seriously.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so they're just like the kids.
LEADFEMALE:I can't afford to screw this job up, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's okay to fail when you're 25, but if you fail when you're 42, you're a serious loser.
LEADMALE:Now, that's not really true, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I just told you that when you were 25 to make you feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:The pressure's off.
SUPMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
SUPFEMALE:You owe me another beer.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha ha! Oh, whoa, whoa.
LEADMALE:What's pete doing here? He took the afternoon off 'cause he was supposed to be sick.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe he is.
LEADFEMALE:He ain't walking too steady.
LEADFEMALE:That guy there is my biggest headache.
LEADFEMALE:He comes in late.
LEADMALE:He does lousy work.
OTHERFEMALE:Twice last week, he had somebody else punch his time card for him.
LEADFEMALE:You hate him, dan? I hate him.
LEADFEMALE:You want to kill him? I want to kill him.
OTHERMALE:You go kill him.
LEADMALE:Bring me back some pretzels.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Feeling better? Oh, dan.
LEADMALE:Hey, uh, i didn't expect to see you.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you didn't.
LEADMALE:Uh, dan, do you know my wife marissa? No.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:What did the doctor say? Oh, he, uh, said i should stay off my feet and drink plenty of fluids.
LEADFEMALE:Look, pete, i don't like it when my people lie to me.
LEADFEMALE:Your people? what are you, moses? Ha ha ha ha! No, come on.
LEADMALE:I'm serious.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm busted.
LEADFEMALE:Let me make it up.
LEADFEMALE:Let me buy you and your wife a beer.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Uh i don't want to see you hung over tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:If i'm hung over, i won't come in.
LEADMALE:He'll be on time.
OTHERMALE:He won't get drunk.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha ha.
LEADMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:So what the hell was that? You went over there to yell at him.
LEADMALE:You didn't do a damn thing.
LEADFEMALE:And where's my pretzels? Well, he's buying us a beer.
SUPMALE:I'm handling it.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're not.
SUPMALE:You're just gonna bottle all your anger up, and then you're gonna take it home and take it out on somebody there.
OTHERFEMALE:I got my anger out.
SUPFEMALE:I told him i was upset.
LEADMALE:He won't do it again.
SUPMALE:Yeah, he will.
OTHERFEMALE:Pretty soon, his lunch breaks are gonna start being longer, and then his diseases will be more exotic.
LEADFEMALE:Then his relatives will start dropping like flies.
LEADFEMALE:You're wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I can handle him.
LEADFEMALE:I know him, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I am him, dan.
LEADMALE:Now, you got to start getting tough.
OTHERMALE:You are gonna have to start cracking down on all these people that give you a hard time.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:You're fired.
LEADMALE:Wish you would have told me this 20 years ago.
LEADFEMALE:Stop it, roseanne.
SUPMALE:You're really starting to annoy me.
OTHERFEMALE:Starting? what, have you been ignoring me all night? Look, you don't understand, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:When i came into this job, i had 30 guys under me who were all mad they weren't made foreman.
LEADFEMALE:I can't fix every truck in the city by myself.
LEADMALE:I got to get these guys to like me so they'll work for me.
LEADFEMALE:That isn't how it works, dan.
LEADFEMALE:People don't work for you because they like you.
OTHERMALE:They work for you because they fear you.
SUPMALE:That's the way you work, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:That's not the way i work.
LEADFEMALE:Every boss i've ever had has been a total hard-ass jerk.
SUPMALE:I always swore i wouldn't be that way.
LEADMALE:If i become one of those guys, i'll be a hypocrite.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna deal with this my way.
SUPMALE:If you don't like it, that's tough.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, don't freak out.
SUPFEMALE:David's not the first kid to bring pot in the house.
SUPFEMALE:What? Jackie, this is gonna be your shortest visit ever! Well, you people argue so much, i get so confused.
SUPMALE:David was smoking pot in the house? what is this new obsession with david all about? david! i want to talk with you in the kitchen now! You want to see me get tough? No, dan, not when you're so damn upset about pete.
LEADFEMALE:That isn't fair to david.
LEADFEMALE:I will handle it, okay? David should be killed for the right reasons.
LEADMALE:Don't forget, now.
LEADMALE:It can lead to other drugs and theft.
LEADMALE:And why do you think they call it dope? And if you got a couple of eggs, fry those up and do the brain thing.
OTHERFEMALE:They never have an answer for that.
SUPFEMALE:Something wrong? David, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:David, do you smoke pot? me? No.
LEADFEMALE:Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:I would never.
LEADMALE:Twice.
SUPMALE:Well, i found this in your room today.
SUPFEMALE:Is that yours? Yes.
SUPMALE:Well, david, i guess i really don't need to tell you that drugs can ruin your life, leaving you a physical, emotional, and spiritual wreck.
OTHERFEMALE:And i don't suppose that i have to tell you that you can receive up to 5 years in prison, according to the latest federal sentencing guidelines, and i know because i read that in outlaw biker magazine.
OTHERMALE:But i can tell you that there is a 12-year-old boy living here, and if you ever bring drugs in my house again, you're out, you got it? I think so.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have anything to add, dan? You know, you should really get down on your knees, david, and thank us, because a lot of people would not be this cool.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Well? Thank you for being so cool.
LEADFEMALE:See how low drugs have made you sink, david? This is your brain.
LEADMALE:Dan, a pan.
LEADFEMALE:And this is your brain on drugs.
SUPFEMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:Go to your room, david, while mr.
SUPFEMALE:Connor and i decide your punishment.
SUPMALE:You really showed me, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i hope you took notes, dan.
LEADMALE:Yep.
OTHERMALE:You were tough, you were firm, and now that david fears you, he'll never do that again.
LEADFEMALE:And he respects me, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Only one thing wrong.
SUPMALE:This is your pot, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:What do you mean, that's my pot? see how low drugs have made you sink? Well, dan, i think i would remember hiding pot in the house.
LEADMALE:Not if you were stoned at the time.
LEADFEMALE:I hid it.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's just great, dan.
LEADFEMALE:A very fine example you're setting for the kids, stealing their mother's stash.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, i didn't steal it.
SUPMALE:I put it away 20 years ago when we quit.
SUPFEMALE:We quit? I just thought we were out.
LEADMALE:Don't you remember? You were pregnant with becky, and you told me to get rid of it.
LEADMALE:Then why the hell didn't you? I tried to flush it.
LEADFEMALE:But as i watched it float helplessly i thought to myself, am i really ready for this part of my life to be over with? Next thing you know, i was down on my hands and knees with an aquarium net and your hair dryer.
LEADMALE:Oh, god, dan, i--i feel terrible.
OTHERMALE:I blamed david for pot that was mine.
LEADMALE:Do you think i owe him an apology? Well, he said it was his, so he probably has some, and now he's gonna get rid of it.
LEADMALE:We may be on to something here.
OTHERFEMALE:You could yell at him for something else and see what he confesses to.
SUPMALE:Have you guys decided on my punishment yet? Not yet, young man.
OTHERMALE:I hope you realize that you have put us into a very awkward position.
LEADMALE:I'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Not half as sorry as i am, mister.
LEADMALE:Felt good to apologize.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:David? where are you? I can barely hear you.
OTHERMALE:I'm at a phone booth.
SUPFEMALE:The guy who lives here is letting me use it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why don't you just call from home? I didn't want your parents to overhear this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i get it.
SUPMALE:So what do you want, abuse or heavy breathing? i was just wondering if you might have left something behind in your bedroom-your socks, your hairbrush, your marijuana? what are you talking about? I don't smoke pot.
LEADMALE:Dulls my hatred.
LEADFEMALE:I know you've tried it, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i've tried sex with you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't mean i'm addicted.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if the pot's not yours and it's not mine, then whose is it? All right, becky.
SUPFEMALE:Becky? So then i'm off the hook.
SUPMALE:I'll tell your mom i took the blame 'cause i thought the pot was yours.
OTHERMALE:And she'll say, "well, if you thought it was darlene's, that must mean she smokes pot.
LEADFEMALE:" well, no.
LEADMALE:Not necessarily, mrs.
LEADMALE:Connor.
SUPMALE:Oh, so she just sells it? No, of course not, but-but nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene is dead.
LEADFEMALE:When i see her, she's gonna need drugs to kill the pain.
LEADMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:It's mine.
LEADFEMALE:Very good.
SUPMALE:You know, the hardest part is admitting you have a problem.
LEADMALE:Feeling nostalgic? No.
LEADFEMALE:I just hauled up the rest of my stuff from the basement, and wanted to make sure there was nothing incriminating left.
SUPMALE:Thought you threw out the stuff years ago.
LEADMALE:No, that was your stuff.
LEADFEMALE:"today is the first day of the rest of your life.
SUPMALE:" yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Who knew it was gonna be such a long, bad day? still depressed about this david thing? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, make room for daddy.
LEADMALE:Today i was a real man.
LEADFEMALE:I took the bull by the horns.
SUPMALE:I fired pete.
LEADMALE:What for? Because you told me to.
SUPMALE:Well, dan, you should always check with me before you do anything that i told you to do.
SUPFEMALE:I did the right thing.
SUPFEMALE:I handled it exactly correctly.
SUPMALE:Man, i feel terrible.
OTHERFEMALE:When did it happen, roseanne? when did we go from doing stuff to yelling at people for doing stuff? when did we get old? Wellfor me, i guess it was, uh the first time i ever discussed the corns on my feet with a total stranger.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, can billy sleep here tonight? No.
OTHERMALE:He's rude, and i don't like his parents.
SUPMALE:Well, then, can i sleep over there? Yeah, sure.
SUPFEMALE:This is it.
LEADMALE:We're old.
OTHERMALE:We'll be old for a long, long time.
OTHERFEMALE:Then we'll be dead.
OTHERMALE:You know, we-we have the house to ourselves tonight.
LEADFEMALE:No! i'll roll it, i'll roll it! You get too much spit on it.
SUPFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Roseanne, here's your comforter back.
SUPMALE:You know what that is? you ain't gonna narc on us, are you? what the hell are you doing? you're rolling a joint after yelling at david for bringing pot in the house? and you're using the coffee table mom gave you? And you're doing it all wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Do you feel anything? I'm not sure.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe the stuff is too old.
LEADMALE:Did i just say that sentence out loud? We're stoned.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any more of those pudding pops? No, this is the last one, and it's mine.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i want it, dan.
LEADMALE:And if i have to, i swear to god, i'm gonna rip your whole arm off to get it.
LEADMALE:That would suck.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm.
OTHERMALE:You are the most wonderful, beautiful sexy you know, thing.
SUPMALE:I really, really love you.
LEADFEMALE:What? I thought this stuff would make me feel younger.
SUPMALE:All i feel is old and tired and hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Man, maybe this is how we got fat.
LEADMALE:Nobody loves me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:We thought you went home.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? I got nothing.
OTHERMALE:No boyfriend, no meaningful job, no husband, no family.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just me.
LEADFEMALE:It's just me and my ganja.
OTHERMALE:Did you hear that? Sounded like somebody's coming through the front door.
LEADFEMALE:You shouldn't be all paranoid, dan! birds, birds, birds! woo! don't you hate that when you're stoned? I don't like it any time! Now don't tell me you didn't hear that.
LEADMALE:Is this the sink? am i shrinking? Mom! the jig is up! D.j. d.j. dj.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. d.j. did you ever notice how weird that sounds? D.j. shh! Dan, maintain.
LEADFEMALE:And what do you want, d.j. ? God, you're right.
SUPMALE:I forgot my sleeping bag.
LEADMALE:Where is it? oh, well, it is out behind the house, you know, past the yard, you know, uh, in that building back there, you know, where your dad always is with the tools and the car? Thanks, mom.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god.
OTHERMALE:I'm, like, the worst mother on the face of the earth.
OTHERMALE:No, you're not.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, i am, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even know where i sent my kid.
LEADMALE:Well, say he falls down, you know, and--and he breaks one of his organs, and he needs a transplant from me, but i can't give him any of my organs because they're all full of pot! That's not going to happen, honey.
LEADMALE:I just know.
LEADFEMALE:There-there's just no way i--i could handle any kind of crisis thing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe i could.
SUPMALE:Oh, god, i just want our normal lives back! Were we ever really stupid enough to enjoy this? Yes, we were, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:But, you know, that was a very different time.
LEADFEMALE:There was-there was a war going on.
LEADFEMALE:Everything was just a lot more fun.
LEADMALE:Everything's okay.
SUPMALE:We'll just get the rest of the stuff and flush it, and we'll never ever do this again.
LEADMALE:Let's go lay down.
LEADMALE:What? Let's go.
LEADMALE:Hey, guys? I don't think this stuff is working.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, i don't blame you guys for getting mad at me, but i've been thinking about something, and i got to tell you the truth.
LEADFEMALE:The pot you found in the basement wasn't mine.
LEADMALE:It's really important to me what you guys think about me.
LEADFEMALE:And yeah, i'm not stupid enough to do drugs.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i tried it when i was younger, but i'm much too mature and smart now to do anything that stupid.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i know guys at school that do it, and they're just like these useless zombies.
OTHERMALE:There's no eggs left?
OTHERFEMALE:Rosie what are you doing this time? I'm directing your sperms where to go.
LEADFEMALE:Please i think my boys know their way around a fallopian tube.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I think they're getting old.
SUPMALE:I hear 'em wheezing around in there.
SUPFEMALE:I hate these damn boxers.
LEADMALE:Well, tough.
LEADMALE:The doctor on oprah said that it makes your equipment work better.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a brief man, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me about it.
SUPMALE:Been making me wear these things for three months now.
LEADMALE:They just don't feel natural.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then don't wear any underwear at all.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's just wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i don't know why you bothered to even put 'em back on, dan.
LEADFEMALE:We're going again in 20 minutes.
LEADMALE:Well, you better have something special planned, cause i don't know if i can.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you think it's so tough for you.
LEADMALE:Gee, i feel like stapling a picture of montel williams to your forehead.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? Well, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Withers down the block wants a baby too, so all right, i'll stay.
LEADMALE:Oh, poor dan.
LEADFEMALE:He has to sit here on the bed with me for two minutes and do nothing while me and god create a life.
LEADMALE:Maybe my sperms are just waiting for your egg to shut up.
LEADMALE:Oh, dan, i know that we're both just sick to death of all this love-making crap, but we got to do it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i've been thinking.
SUPMALE:When this kid graduates high school, i'll be 60.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's one of our kids, dan, so you'll probably be more like 65 or 70.
LEADMALE:Be too old even to play ball with him.
LEADMALE:Odds are half my life's over already.
LEADFEMALE:If this kid has to grow up without a father is that fair to him? I'm scared, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:This whole thing's making me think about death.
LEADFEMALE:Well, think about whatever you have to, dan.
SUPFEMALE:We're going again in 20 minutes.
LEADMALE:Hey, david.
LEADMALE:Morning.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, why are all these dates circled on this calendar? Well, you see, david, that's mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner's ovulation schedule.
LEADFEMALE:No, really.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? No, david, it's true.
SUPFEMALE:You see, two weeks ago was the last time mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner was fertile.
LEADFEMALE:So these are the days that you guys ovulate.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, i'm here.
LEADMALE:I got the test.
SUPMALE:This one feels lucky.
LEADFEMALE:Can i get some coffee? No, let's go set up the test and then have coffee while you wait for it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want any coffee.
SUPMALE:Oh, mood swings.
LEADMALE:That's a good sign.
LEADMALE:I started.
LEADMALE:What? I got my period.
LEADMALE:Damn.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, you better go.
SUPMALE:You don't want to be late for work.
LEADFEMALE:Better start loading up on my protein again.
LEADFEMALE:Call me if you need anything.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the good news is i'll be able to start drinking again.
LEADMALE:Don't be upset, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll still be the family drunk.
SUPFEMALE:I'm pregnant.
LEADMALE:What? Fred's the father, and i haven't even told him yet.
SUPMALE:It just happened that one time we went out together.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what are the odds? jackie, you're pregnant? Have you thought about what you want to-well, i'm gonna keep it.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i want to 'cause could be my last chance to oh, i just say that you're happy for me even if you don't mean it, but please mean it.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm happy for you, jackie, yeah.
LEADMALE:I mean, i'd be happier for you if it was me.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted you to be pregnant too so then we could get pregnant together.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not too late.
SUPMALE:Let's get fred over here.
LEADMALE:I don't--i don't know if i can do this, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not like you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not the mothering type.
LEADFEMALE:Remember that doll i had that wet itself? I just thought it was too much trouble, so i stopped giving it water.
OTHERMALE:Well, you were just a kid then.
SUPMALE:That doesn't mean that you will be a bad mother.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, gee, at least you bottle-fed it.
LEADMALE:I used to rip its head off and fill it under the tap.
LEADMALE:Then last night i had this dream that the baby was already born and i put it down somewhere and then i couldn't remember where i put it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, every mom has that dream, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:You just reach in through the back of the crib, you know, into the dragon's mouth, and then you get that banana, bring it out, blow on it.
LEADMALE:It turns back into the baby, and then you just fly away.
LEADMALE:Just i'm really scared.
SUPMALE:Well, you don't need to be, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:I'm here for you, and me and you can do this together.
LEADFEMALE:What if the kid doesn't love me, or what if i don't love the kid? That's not gonna happen.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm trying to see my eyebrows.
SUPMALE:Just tell me that you love him.
LEADMALE:Please, just tell me that you love him.
SUPMALE:Well, roseanne, here i am.
SUPFEMALE:What news is so important i had to hop in the car and race right over here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, um, well i forgot to tell you.
OTHERMALE:Your brakes are shot.
LEADMALE:Okay, mom i have something very important to tell you.
LEADMALE:It's a big one.
SUPMALE:I need you to sit in this chair here.
LEADMALE:Come over here.
LEADFEMALE:Just stay very calm.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, whatever you do, don't get upset, and, mom, keep an open mind.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie's pregnant.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god! Mom well, i always knew something like this would happen.
LEADFEMALE:She got married and didn't invite me.
LEADMALE:No, mom, she did not get married.
LEADFEMALE:She just got pregnant, and you're right, she didn't invite you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my-oh, no.
LEADMALE:She'll never get her reputation back.
LEADMALE:Listen to me, mom.
LEADFEMALE:This is her reputation.
SUPFEMALE:This is awful! you know that sawyer girl who had a baby without a husband? She went insane! Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:I just keep thinking what would your father say? shh, shh what would my father say? Mom! Get some control here.
LEADMALE:Now, jackie is going to need us, and we are going to have to be very supportive, okay? I want you to repeat after me, mom.
LEADMALE:I will be supportive.
SUPFEMALE:I will be supportive.
SUPMALE:Well, i suppose it's nice i'm gonna have another grandchild.
LEADMALE:There you go, mom.
SUPMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:Um, jackie uh, i got something to tell you.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, jackie mom and me were just talking.
SUPFEMALE:Well, just--just a second, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:There's something i want to tell my mother.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, um, i'm pregnant.
OTHERFEMALE:I went out with a guy i hardly know, we had sex for hours, and i got pregnant.
OTHERMALE:And i'm not gonna marry him.
LEADMALE:I'm keeping the baby, and if it's a girl i'm naming it gidget.
LEADMALE:What if it's a boy? what? what are you gonna name it if it's a boy? what about that rock singer you like so much? uh, bongo? what--what's she talking about? I think she means ringo.
LEADMALE:Yes, ringo.
LEADFEMALE:That's pretty jazzy.
LEADMALE:No, wh--what's happening here? You heard your unmarried daughter told you that she's pregnant.
LEADMALE:I heard her, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:And i want you to know i'll be there for you.
OTHERMALE:I've never been one to judge.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank god for that.
LEADMALE:You told her, didn't you.
LEADMALE:Well, i--i just wanted to soften the blow.
SUPMALE:But i didn't want this blow to be soft.
LEADFEMALE:This was the one, the one.
LEADFEMALE:This is the moment i've been waiting for all my life.
OTHERMALE:This one could have killed her! Jackie, if you believe in reincarnation at all, perhaps this is not the perfect time to kill mom, if you know what i mean.
SUPFEMALE:Well, when you did tell her, did she at least, like, faint or turn blue or something? no! well, you didn't do it right! You--you have to let me tell people, okay? Okay, i promise.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna tell anybody else anyways.
LEADMALE:I mean, besides dan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, um, jackie, could i-could i please tell nancy too? No.
SUPMALE:I already did, and i told darlene too.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne i swear to god.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, roseanne, i'm sorry i wasn't around when you called.
OTHERMALE:See, he doesn't know and that counts that i didn't tell him.
OTHERMALE:What was so important? Uh, oh, i couldn't get the li--lid off, uh, these pickles there.
OTHERMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you're strong.
SUPMALE:Anything else? No, that's about it.
SUPMALE:How 'bout you, jackie? need anything off a high shelf? Uh, fred, i am not ready to talk about stuff on the high shelf.
LEADMALE:The stuff that is there is not going anywhere.
LEADMALE:When i am ready to discuss it, i will be the one to call you down here, not roseanne! You just had to keep pushing, didn't you, fred.
LEADMALE:You know, i was just examining our calendar of love.
LEADFEMALE:Seems i am to service you tonight.
LEADFEMALE:First, the seduction.
LEADMALE:Ah, well, not now, dan.
SUPMALE:I got too many troubles with jackie.
LEADMALE:She doesn't have a single clue about this whole pregnancy thing, you know? She's talking about having natural childbirth.
OTHERMALE:With no drugs.
OTHERFEMALE:You should show her the scar i gave you when i had d.j. four stitches, saw the bone.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, next time i'll take the hand wound and you can have the episiotomy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that killed the mood.
LEADMALE:You know if jackie would only tell fred about this, then he could be here helping her with this instead of you.
LEADFEMALE:He really should know.
LEADMALE:Please, dan, it's bad enough that jackie knows.
LEADMALE:Well, this is their problem.
LEADMALE:We're gonna have our own kid.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i can hardly have a baby when jackie's gonna have one.
SUPFEMALE:What? Hold on a damn minute here.
LEADMALE:You had a fit to have this kid.
SUPMALE:You put me on a sex schedule.
SUPFEMALE:You took away my underpants.
LEADFEMALE:You don't take away a man's underpants, roseanne, and then change your mind! Well, jackie needs me.
SUPMALE:What makes you think that? Because she told me so.
OTHERMALE:She is just absolutely terrified, dan, that if i have a baby too that i will not be around, you know, and available to help her.
LEADFEMALE:She got down on her knees and begged me.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:Let's just put our lives on hold for jackie.
LEADMALE:Well, we can still have sex.
SUPMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Just wear that.
LEADFEMALE:You know how i get around.
LEADMALE:I'm angry at you, and when i'm angry at you, i'm not in the mood.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, since when? Just turn off the light and don't talk.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me what to do! And i figure it isn't a shower without entertainment.
OTHERMALE:Well, nancy, i don't think that a stripper is appropriate entertainment for a baby shower.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's a really cool idea.
LEADFEMALE:He strips down to his diaper, and then he sits on everybody's lap.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? your stomach bothering you? No.
SUPFEMALE:No, i told you i don't have morning sickness, okay? You know, you should eat a saltine.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want a saltine.
LEADFEMALE:It'll make you feel better.
LEADMALE:Roseanne come on, for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Fred.
SUPFEMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:You know, lately i get the feeling you've been wanting to talk to me about something.
SUPFEMALE:Um, yeah, fred, i sort of did.
SUPFEMALE:But i don't.
OTHERMALE:You know, jackie, fred's had the same dog for 10 years.
SUPFEMALE:I did not know that, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for telling me that.
LEADMALE:All of his plants are alive too.
SUPMALE:In fact, fred, i've always found you a very loving and nurturing man.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, dan.
LEADMALE:I find your honesty unsettling.
LEADFEMALE:No, i mean i admire you, fred.
SUPMALE:You're that rare combination of soft and caring yet strong and virile.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you two run outside and carve your initials into a tree? I'm gonna go to the bathroom now, and when i come back, let's all be talking about something else.
LEADMALE:Look, hey, hey, whether or not i tell fred is my own damn business.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, dan.
SUPMALE:Yeah, roseanne, it's my baby.
OTHERMALE:Mine.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the one that had sex.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one who's getting fat.
SUPMALE:I'm the one whose hormones are gonna go crazy any day now.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish you would just leave me alone, let me do it by myself.
LEADFEMALE:What? It's all your fault, dan.
OTHERMALE:Ever since you told her you don't want to have a kid, she's trying to get her hands on mine.
LEADMALE:What? Roseanne, i thought you said we couldn't have a baby 'cause jackie begged you to take care of hers.
LEADMALE:What! Roseanne, what the hell's going on here? well, isn't it obvious? I mean, the two of you are in such deep denial that it is pathetic.
LEADFEMALE:What are we denying, roseanne? Well, huh okay, you're both denying the fact that you really do not want me to have a kid.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, the idea of it just terrifies you so bad that you can't even cope with it.
SUPFEMALE:So in order to deal with it, you're putting the whole thing on someone else so the two of you can just deny, deny, deny.
OTHERFEMALE:You totally made that up in your own head.
LEADMALE:See how deep it goes! You lied to me, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but at least i had a good reason this time.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you can't handle a baby by yourself, jackie.
SUPMALE:I mean, you're gonna be shooting people from a tower in a clown suit.
LEADFEMALE:If i'm tough enough to survive you, i'm tough enough to handle anything a kid's gonna throw at me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? what about steak knives? That's happened to me twice.
LEADMALE:Darlene throws like a boy.
SUPMALE:You are not that strong, jackie, because sometime your kid's gonna come to you and want to know who its father is, and you don't even have the guts to tell the father who the father is! fred! I'm pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:You're the father.
SUPMALE:You want to talk about that, i'll be in the kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll meet you at home.
OTHERMALE:Oh, dan, wait a minute! Wow.
LEADMALE:Good thing i was sitting down.
LEADFEMALE:Turn the car off, dan.
LEADMALE:I want to go home.
SUPMALE:We got to talk.
SUPMALE:If you don't want to have a baby, don't go blaming it on me.
OTHERMALE:Maybe it's not that i don't want to have the baby, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's that i can't have a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Is there something i should know? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm 41 years old.
LEADMALE:Is that what this is all about? I mean, come on, roseanne.
LEADMALE:We've only been trying for three months.
LEADMALE:I know, but we never used to have to try at all.
OTHERMALE:We'd get pregnant just using the same soap.
OTHERMALE:I was just thinking maybe my body doesn't work anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Did you ever think maybe it's my body that doesn't work anymore? Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's what got me through the first three months.
SUPMALE:Look, honey, if we can't, we can't.
SUPMALE:Then at least i get my wife back.
OTHERMALE:Then in six years, when d.j. goes and runs off with some religious cult, we can ride a couple of harleys across the country.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's a bunch of crap, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:You want to have a baby as bad as i do.
LEADMALE:Not if it means screwing up my marriage.
OTHERMALE:You've been carrying this around for three months, and you never even said anything to me about it.
SUPMALE:We used to talk about stuff like this.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's 'cause it-it just hurts too much, dan.
SUPMALE:I mean, every month, i--i let us down.
SUPFEMALE:You don't let us down.
LEADMALE:Well, that's what it feels like.
OTHERMALE:Well, it shouldn't feel like that.
LEADFEMALE:That is what it feels like.
SUPMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:We're throwing the damn calendar out.
LEADFEMALE:We're going back to doing the way we always did, and whatever happens happens.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Remember the good old days when sex was fun? Well, yeah, but those guys didn't mean anything to me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that dashboard really brings out your eyes.
LEADMALE:Boy, you french lads sure know what to say to a dame.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we shouldn't do it anyway, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you know, yesterday was my last fertile day.
SUPMALE:There'd be no point.
SUPFEMALE:There's a point.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but try to keep your butt below the window.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do you think maybe i could go to the lamaze classes or something with you? I mean, i am the father.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but i don't-i hardly know you, fred.
LEADFEMALE:We only went out once.
LEADMALE:That's your fault.
LEADMALE:I wanted to go out with you the very next day after i impregnated you.
LEADFEMALE:Well fred, we're gonna have a lot of problems here if you're don't respect my space.
LEADMALE:I understand.
OTHERMALE:It's your body.
SUPFEMALE:It's your decision.
SUPMALE:There is nothing that i can do about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, fred.
OTHERMALE:Just promise me, if you ever need any help, money, support, just somebody to talk to, please call me.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, fred.
SUPMALE:I--i appreciate that.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess we should shake hands or something.
LEADMALE:Well thanks for the child.
LEADMALE:You know that sawyer girl who had a baby without a husband? she went insane! listen, mom-oh, my god, i just keep thinking, what would your father say? what would my father say? your aunt-mom, shh! i'm sorry! i couldn't help laugh-you get hurt? No! I told you i was gonna hit you.
LEADMALE:I know, but i--sorry.
LEADMALE:Was it too hard? No, it was good.
LEADMALE:What's that? Dead guy.
LEADMALE:Nancy, this is an eating establishment.
LEADFEMALE:Are you crazy? You can't tie up a whole table for four.
OTHERMALE:He doesn't look very realistic.
LEADFEMALE:Next year i'm springing for a real dead guy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he looks pretty good to me, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:He looks like he died in his sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:Give me that knife.
OTHERMALE:Yes, here at the lunch box, the customer is always right.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, wait.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not leon.
LEADMALE:Well spiders, blood, corpses.
LEADMALE:You know, charmed as i am by all your accoutrement, i still feel the need to remove the fake vomit.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's wet.
LEADMALE:Well, that plastic stuff never fools anybody.
LEADMALE:You mean this is-no.
LEADMALE:We just doctored up some of the loose meat.
SUPMALE:What did you do to it to make it look like that? Surprisingly little.
SUPFEMALE:Have you decided what you're wearing to dan's lodge party? Well, we were thinkin' that you and me and dan and roseanne would go as the cleaver family.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, look at this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm beaver cleaver.
LEADFEMALE:And dan gets to be june cleaver, and you can be ward, and i get to be wally.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, you guys.
LEADMALE:I kinda already had something else in mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god, you're not going to shave your head and go as that stop-the-insanity woman again, are you? No, but i don't think i should spend the whole evening with you guys.
LEADMALE:I don't think dan would have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? I don't think dan likes me very much.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course he does.
LEADMALE:Look, i'm very sensitive to these things.
SUPMALE:I know when someone doesn't like me.
SUPFEMALE:Does it look something like this? When i tell dan that you said that, he is going to come over here and set everything straight.
LEADFEMALE:He's going to hug you so hard that you're going to be leaking silicone for days.
LEADMALE:Then you think he really does like me? Yes, already.
SUPMALE:Everybody likes you.
SUPMALE:God, you're so annoying.
LEADMALE:Lunch box.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, darlene.
SUPMALE:Hey, if this is about you not coming home for halloween, you better have a damn good excuse.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i was in a horrible accident, and i'm just a head.
SUPMALE:And? Something came up.
SUPFEMALE:There's this halloween party here, and the thing is this guy asked me to go with him, and i'm thinking about going.
SUPMALE:This isn't like a date or nothin' is it? No, it's no big deal.
SUPMALE:Just please don't tell david.
SUPFEMALE:Well, gee, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:It'll be like our little secret, ok? Ok, fine, i'll do this for you, but you remember us when i'm about 80 and i need help getting your dad into his truss.
SUPMALE:Hey, mom, thanks for being there.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, it was my shift.
LEADMALE:Ok, bye.
SUPMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:I cannot believe what darlene just told me.
LEADMALE:She's cheating on david.
LEADFEMALE:I never thought this would happen.
SUPFEMALE:We're like girlfriends.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least the waiting is over, and i survived my annual roseanne prank.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine the shock when i sat down at my desk, only to discover-ooh, oogie, boogie, woogie, boogie, boogie.
OTHERFEMALE:Frankly, roseanne, i'm disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? Ah, that's my pranks, dirty tricks, and flat-out mean stuff i plan to do to my loved ones list.
SUPMALE:Let's see--david, david, david.
LEADMALE:Aha.
LEADMALE:Well, you may want to wear a helmet to bed.
OTHERMALE:Have you figured out what your costume's gonna be for the lodge party? I'm not going.
SUPMALE:I mean, if darlene were gonna be here, i'd give it a try but she called and said that she has to study for a test on halloween night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, that's school for you.
SUPFEMALE:It's either a test or something else.
SUPFEMALE:So i'm not gonna do anything.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but, david, you can't not do anything.
LEADFEMALE:This is halloween.
LEADFEMALE:It's the one night a year where you're supposed to break all the rules.
SUPMALE:And you're a conner now.
LEADFEMALE:I just cannot allow you to sit here at home and be good and nice and well-behaved.
OTHERMALE:People will begin to talk.
SUPMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm home.
OTHERFEMALE:Grr.
OTHERMALE:Ow! I told you to get salted crackers.
LEADMALE:David: i'll be outside.
SUPMALE:Ow! Well, what have we here, my pet, your little prank list? Yes, but you shall never see it.
SUPMALE:I'm putting it in the vault.
SUPFEMALE:I'm coming in after it.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha ho.
LEADFEMALE:Gimme, gimme! Dan? yes? You should have been at the diner today.
LEADFEMALE:The weirdest thing happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Like, right out of the blue, nancy comes up with this thing where she thinks that you don't like her.
LEADMALE:You do so! I'm sorry, roseanne.
LEADMALE:She's the most superficial person i've ever met.
SUPFEMALE:But that's just her facade.
LEADMALE:She's rude and selfish.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but inside she's just a scared little girl.
SUPMALE:And i know who's scaring her-a raging bitch on the outside.
LEADMALE:That is no fair, dan.
LEADMALE:You know all your dumb, stupid, idiot friends that i hate? I like them.
LEADMALE:Hey, roseanne, i pretend to like nancy.
OTHERMALE:Well, then you suck at it, 'cause she's onto you.
OTHERMALE:Nancy's aware of other people? You're gonna go in there tomorrow, dan, and you're gonna tell her that you like her, and then you're gonna give her a great big old hug.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, i'd just have to come home and peel off all my skin.
SUPMALE:I'm serious, dan.
OTHERMALE:You've got to do it.
LEADMALE:Or else it's gonna be two hugs and a nice little poem.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i'm not gonna tell her i like her because i don't like her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i know, but that's why you have to go down there and tell her that you like her.
SUPFEMALE:You never tell people that you like that you like them.
SUPMALE:The only people that you ever tell that you like are the people you actually don't like.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, i'll do it.
LEADMALE:Really? Course not.
SUPFEMALE:The only things you have to say you're gonna do are things you have no intention of doing.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, dan said that all nancy ever talks about is herself.
SUPMALE:Well, roseanne, it is kind of true.
LEADFEMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPFEMALE:What else does she talk about? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I never listen to her.
LEADMALE:I just saw the saddest thing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what is it, nance? see that old lady over there? the bent gray one? I see her.
LEADMALE:I have that same dress.
LEADFEMALE:What was i thinking? I hate it when dan's right.
SUPFEMALE:So what did dan think about all of us going as the cleaver family? Oh, he thought it was really cool.
OTHERMALE:And he thought of a way to make it funnier, too.
LEADMALE:It seems as though june, ok, is so mangled that it's take ward, wally, and the beaver to carry what's left of her around in a mason jar.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:If dan is going as june, that means he's not part of the group.
LEADMALE:I was right.
OTHERFEMALE:He hates me.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not true, nance.
LEADFEMALE:No, he likes you, nancy.
LEADFEMALE:It's just, you know, he's not that comfortable in high heels.
SUPFEMALE:Look, if the two of you can't be honest with me about it, maybe you don't like me, either.
LEADFEMALE:No, we like you, nancy.
LEADMALE:I mean, maybe not right now, but, you know, other times.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you hate me so much, maybe i shouldn't work here anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Leon's been wanting to buy my share.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe i should just sell.
SUPMALE:Gotcha.
LEADFEMALE:Ahha ha ha.
LEADFEMALE:The whole thing's a prank me and sis here worked up to make you think that us and dan don't like you.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha ha.
LEADMALE:Boo! So dan does like me, and he's going to come here and hug me? Oh, welli mean he--he wants to, but i'm just too jealous to let him, you know.
LEADFEMALE:So, instead he's going to pull, like, this great all-time prank on you.
LEADMALE:On me, really? Oh, oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Huge.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll be huge.
LEADFEMALE:Really embarrassing, too.
LEADMALE:Feel better? I am so touched, i could cry.
LEADMALE:Back in a sec.
SUPFEMALE:I love to watch myself cry.
OTHERFEMALE:Is dan playing a trick on nancy? He is now.
LEADMALE:Hi, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:Who's the skirt with david? Huh, nice rack.
OTHERMALE:Hello, david.
SUPMALE:Hello, david's little friend.
SUPMALE:This is sally knopp.
LEADMALE:She's on the halloween dance committee, and she asked me to draw some posters.
LEADMALE:So we came here where you areto work.
LEADMALE:'cause, uh 'cause that's what we're doing workin'.
LEADFEMALE:I knew you'd be here.
LEADFEMALE:Can we get some pop, please? Well, he says that they're working.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you've gotta feel really guilty.
OTHERMALE:You're the one that told david to do something for halloween.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know he was going to do her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what did you think he was gonna do? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't think it was fair, you know, him sittin' there all alone.
SUPMALE:I want him to have some fun.
SUPMALE:Darlene's goin' out with some other guy.
LEADMALE:How the hell was i supposed to know he could get a date with a normal girl? You should have seen me.
LEADMALE:I looked so sad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so excited about dan's prank.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't wait to see how i look surprised.
OTHERFEMALE:David, here's your drink.
SUPMALE:Here, sally.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Lunch box.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hiuh, caller.
LEADMALE:It's darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen, i just made a decision about something.
SUPFEMALE:And i wanted to talk to somebody who'd understand.
OTHERFEMALE:When i thought about goin' out with that other guy it made me realize how much i love david.
LEADFEMALE:I would just feel too guilty dating anybody else.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, that guilt'll really eat you up.
LEADMALE:You know, mom, i think it's really cool the way we can talk to each other now.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, good.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you remember this, for, you know, in case you ever get, like, in a big fight or anything.
LEADFEMALE:Do me a favor.
LEADMALE:Keep an eye on david.
LEADMALE:Make sure he's happy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, happy.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, sure.
LEADMALE:Will do.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Talk to you later.
LEADFEMALE:Well? Well, darlene says she's not gonna go out with this other guy after all because she just realized how much she loved david.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and now david's with another girl.
LEADFEMALE:And you're the one that pushed him into it.
SUPMALE:Man, i'd hate to be in your shoes right now.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i hope your baby doesn't grow really long fingernails, 'cause sometimes they like to hang on on their way out.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, dan, i've been thinking, and i got way too mad last night, and i was really a pain.
LEADFEMALE:And i'm sorry, and blah, blah, blah-love, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever you want, i ain't doing it.
SUPFEMALE:Why, dan, your suspicion truly hurts me.
LEADFEMALE:After i was so nice to you, too.
LEADMALE:Gee, i wonder what you can do to make it up to me.
LEADMALE:I know! You can play a prank on nancy.
LEADFEMALE:God beat me to it.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, if you don't play a prank on nancy to show her that we all like her, she might sell her shares of the restaurant to leon, and then he would be my boss again.
LEADMALE:And this affects me how? Maybe you forgot what i'm like when i work for leon.
SUPMALE:Don't care for that.
LEADMALE:What the hell is that? Hey! You think you would at least ask before you go gettin' into my cheese puffs.
SUPMALE:Maybe they were for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Do you want me to go out and get some more? No.
LEADMALE:Don't bother.
SUPMALE:I'll just have to make chicken now or something.
OTHERMALE:You done with your posters? Well, yeah, but now we're working on costumes.
SUPFEMALE:See, we're going to the halloween dance together as romeo and juliet.
LEADFEMALE:Six months after the suicide.
LEADMALE:Do you want to stay for dinner? We're not having dinner.
SUPFEMALE:I think i'm just gonna go.
LEADFEMALE:Aww call me later? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Promise.
LEADMALE:Gee, do you like her? gee, do you have to cheat on my daughter using my couch and my cheese puffs as your wooing tools? I'm not cheating on darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Sally's a friend.
LEADMALE:You're the one who's making me go out on halloween.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but i didn't know you were gonna go out as a horny teenager.
LEADMALE:I'm telling darlene.
LEADMALE:You can't.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, hey, mothers report back about cheating boyfriends, david.
OTHERFEMALE:It's in the bible.
LEADMALE:Try reading it.
SUPMALE:Come on, i'm just going to the halloween dance with her.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, darlene bailed on me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she had that test.
LEADMALE:All right, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, fine.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead and tell her.
LEADFEMALE:But if you do, i'll know that you lied about me being a part of the family 'cause you'd never screw over one of your own kids.
LEADMALE:D.j. , come here! Excuse me.
LEADMALE:D.j. , you know that girl in your class that you hate and that you call the warthog? what did i ask her to do? To kiss me.
SUPMALE:And did she kiss you? Yes.
LEADMALE:And did i have any reason at all for doing so? No.
SUPMALE:You can go play.
LEADFEMALE:So, you were saying? does this bother you? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Good! How's this? It's ok, but it's not nearly as good as the sound i can make with this pan and a kid's head.
LEADMALE:Aah! aah! aah! Hey, hey, did you do that for halloween, 'cause it looks pretty good.
SUPMALE:Do what? Wear them glasses.
OTHERMALE:Cut the crap, lady.
SUPMALE:All right, everybody do as i say and you won't get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Put your hands on your head.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh.
SUPFEMALE:The great big robber gonna scare me with his itty-bitty gun.
LEADFEMALE:I said put your hands on your head, lady.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but you didn't say "baldy says" first.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm serious! And stop looking at my face.
LEADMALE:I'm looking, i'm looking i'm memorizing everything roseanne! What are you doing? isn't it obvious? I'm getting a prank pulled on me.
LEADMALE:I'm being robbed by daddy warbucks.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up! Everyone, give me your money and jewelry, and you, open the register.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, but there's not a lot of money in there, so i guess i'll have to give you the keys to my house, too.
LEADMALE:You know, it's 714 delaware street.
LEADMALE:Lady, this guy's serious.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, then i'd better give him my wedding ring, too.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, that really wasn't a prank! Oh, please.
LEADMALE:It reeks of dan.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong! That's dan's prank.
LEADFEMALE:Show her, sam.
LEADMALE:Is there really any point in doing this now? I mean i'm a little upset.
SUPMALE:Show her! Oh, no, my god there's something wrong with this meat.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna be sick.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh aah! aah! Ah ha ha.
LEADMALE:Are you serious? why didn't you tell me? I did! I gave him my wedding ring.
SUPFEMALE:Would you please call the police, and i'll try to see where he went.
LEADMALE:Ah ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha.
OTHERMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:I told you i knew it.
LEADMALE:All along i knew it.
LEADFEMALE:Stupe-nagle.
LEADMALE:Not bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Not bad? It was great.
OTHERMALE:Yawn.

LEADMALE:I got a delivery to make.
OTHERMALE:Good one, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha.
SUPMALE:Ha ha ha! Stupe-nagle? So i hope you have nancy's prank all ready.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i do.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? And i'm keeping it right here.
LEADFEMALE:Heh heh heh heh! That ain't no prank.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it fooled you, so it's bound to mystify her.
LEADFEMALE:That's all she's getting, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't gonna waste no killer prank on nancy.
OTHERMALE:She's not worth it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't like her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, nancy, wait.
SUPMALE:You don't understand.
OTHERMALE:You know, dan-oh, my god! Ohh oh, i get it.
LEADMALE:It's my prank.
LEADFEMALE:You should go look at your face and see how surprised it looks.
LEADMALE:Go, go.
LEADMALE:Look, he's still going.
LEADFEMALE:You really do like me, and i like you-aah! eww! I hope this fake stuff washes off.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha.
SUPFEMALE:You're funny, dan.
SUPMALE:Ha ha ha.
SUPMALE:Come on, i'll take you to the emergency room.
LEADFEMALE:Man, i'm never going to the hospital on halloween again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, dan, when else can you get your nose set by a ninja turtle? You went too far this time, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:You really embarrassed me.
OTHERFEMALE:What's this? david brought that girl over here again? They're not in the living room.
SUPFEMALE:They better not be down in his room.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute-oh, man.
LEADMALE:Don't go down there all crazy and everything.
SUPMALE:Surprise! darlene, you're home! Darlene, we didn't know you were coming home.
LEADMALE:Why are you guys acting so weird? did i interrupt some sort of creepy sex thing? Uh, yes.
OTHERMALE:Come back tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i just came to see david.
LEADFEMALE:Is he downstairs? Ohh! This is david.
SUPMALE:He's going as your dad.
OTHERFEMALE:He's just trying to get the nose right.
LEADFEMALE:David's with that sally girl.
LEADMALE:What sally girl? Uh, sally girl, you know, that's one of those a new kids' expression for a guy's friend.
LEADFEMALE:You know, like homeboy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Right now, david's downstairs hangin' with his sally girl mike.
LEADMALE:No, he's not.
LEADMALE:Sally's his new girlfriend.
SUPFEMALE:They were kissing on the couch for, like, a million hours, and then they went downstairs.
SUPMALE:Don't move.
SUPMALE:All right, young man.
LEADFEMALE:Who taught you to tell the truth? Sally: aah! stop it! you're hurting her! you whore! darlene! you tramp! you slut! aah! aah! aah! Happy halloween.
LEADFEMALE:Sucker! sucker! sucker! shut up, all of you! You scared the hell out of me.
OTHERMALE:Pranks are supposed to be funny.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:It was my idea.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted to be part of the family.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, then i guess i'm proud of you.
LEADMALE:Now, give me that head.
LEADMALE:Come on, we'll go over to jackie's.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah oh, yeah 
LEADMALE:Hey, david, you shouldn't be doing your homework in front of the tv.
SUPMALE:I'm not doing homework.
OTHERMALE:Oh, good.
SUPMALE:I'm writing darlene a letter.
LEADFEMALE:I've called her 5 times today and she hasn't called me back.
SUPMALE:That's nice.
SUPMALE:When you're done, go to the store for me and get me some milk and bread and peanut butter.
SUPMALE:Oh yeah, and if they have any left, get a life.
LEADFEMALE:I have a life.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't.
SUPMALE:All you do is sit here on the couch.
SUPFEMALE:You don't get any exercise.
SUPFEMALE:You just eat and sleep, which would be fine if we were raising you for veal.
SUPMALE:It's just that right now i'm having a really hard time with darlene.
OTHERMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Right now you're having a really hard time with me.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to be like a normal kid.
SUPFEMALE:Get out there and start doing all the things your peers are pressuring you into doing.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, i promise.
SUPMALE:But right now i have to straighten out darlene.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of personal if you don't mind.
SUPMALE:No, i don't mind.
LEADMALE:"dear darlene, i really, really miss you.
LEADFEMALE:"it really, really hurts me when you don't call.
LEADFEMALE:"i know you're very busy, but if you don't mind" see, i was gonna get really tough after that.
LEADFEMALE:I was tougher than this in my wedding vows.
SUPMALE:Okay, here, david.
LEADMALE:Take this down.
LEADMALE:Dear darlene, i am tired of your crap.
LEADFEMALE:You are selfish, moody and most of all, ungrateful.
SUPFEMALE:She's not ungrateful.
LEADMALE:Trust me, i've known her longer than you.
SUPFEMALE:And then you gotta finish up with something that'll really, really get her.
LEADFEMALE:I could tell her she's just like you.
LEADFEMALE:That'll kill her.
SUPMALE:Both of us with one shot.
LEADFEMALE:Guess who i found at the train station.
OTHERMALE:Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Hi! Wow.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner thought it would be fun to surprise you.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene, we really, really miss you and it really makes us feel really really bad when you don't call.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for coming.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:She's not moving back here, is she? No, we would never let david's girlfriend move into the house.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, david, would you come help me put my stuff away? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'll be right there.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, can i have that back, please? No, david, i'm afraid not.
SUPMALE:Because, you see, i own you now.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want from me.
SUPFEMALE:I just want you to keep your promise.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out in the world.
LEADMALE:Quit laying there on the couch, 'cause dan and i might not always be there to turn you every half hour.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:And i want you to start sticking up for yourself around darlene.
OTHERMALE:Don't let her push you around all the time.
SUPMALE:David, come help me unpack.
LEADMALE:No, no! i can't help you! No, you can help her unpack.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, have you seen my october cosmo? No, but let me help you look for it.
OTHERFEMALE:Nope, it's not in the sports section.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing downstairs? what's the matter with your bathroom? D.j. 's been in there for, like, an hour.
OTHERMALE:He's just like you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you run a newspaper up to him.
SUPMALE:He's got the door locked, and it's, like, the third time today.
LEADMALE:Maybe i ought to go up there.
LEADMALE:Trust me, i don't think this is a time that a boy needs his mother.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talkin' about? Um, i think i know what she's talkin' about.
LEADMALE:And i think you know what she's talkin' about if you just think about it for a minute.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. 's finally got a friend that's not imaginary.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:You don't know! He could just be brushin' his teeth or, you know, uh, maybe he's compulsively washing his hands, oruh, maybe it's somethin' totally harmless like chronic diarrhea.
SUPMALE:Trust me, he goes in that room 'cause it's the only one with a lock on it.
SUPFEMALE:And he's in there for, like, an hour at a time.
SUPMALE:Which either means he's really, really good at it or really, really bad at it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god! Well, i don't want you to give him any grief about this because you could traumatize him and turn him into a serial killer or somethin'.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't worry.
SUPMALE:How much damage can you do with only one free hand? You know, guys this doesn't have to be a bad thing.
LEADFEMALE:Very natural.
SUPMALE:It'snot like we all didn't do it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:Get outta here.
LEADMALE:I'm goin'.
OTHERMALE:He's too young for this isn't he, dan? Maybe he's gifted.
LEADFEMALE:But lookit.
SUPFEMALE:He still drinks his juice out of a little batman cup.
LEADFEMALE:He's my baby.
LEADMALE:Well, from now on when your baby's bad, i guess we can't send him up to his room.
SUPMALE:Well, we ought to be able to handle this okay.
LEADMALE:I mean, you know, it's just masturbation.
LEADFEMALE:That's great about your short story.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you tell me you got an "a"? Never seen one before.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know what it was.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you don't have to hold back all the good stuff that's happening to you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, good--good stuff's happening to me, too.
LEADMALE:Really? I--i mean, that's great.
LEADMALE:Like what? Well, uh i got some as.
SUPFEMALE:You did? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I got an "a" in art, in history, and, uh, in gym.
SUPFEMALE:And i got a "b" in social studies.
SUPFEMALE:I got a b-plus in english.
LEADMALE:I got a-a "b" in math.
SUPMALE:I got a b-minus in biology.
SUPMALE:I got a-a "b" in music.
SUPMALE:And a "b" in geometry.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez, david, how many classes are you taking? A lot.
LEADMALE:I'm--i'm really into school this year.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, i'm gonna be doin' some art for the yearbook, too.
LEADMALE:Whoa! You must be really busy.
LEADMALE:Sounds like you're doin' really great.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:It's so great to see you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, david! What the hell's going on? what do you mean? Well, your math teacher came by the restaurant today and says you haven't been at school for two weeks.
LEADMALE:What you been doing? Nothin.
SUPFEMALE:' well, you know, if you wanna mope around this house all depressed and down, there's nothing i can do about it, but i'm damn sure not gonna let you drop out of school and screw up your life like you're one of my own kids.
LEADMALE:I'll start going, and i'll make up the work.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you bet you will, and there'll be somebody standing over your shoulder to make sure that you do that.
LEADFEMALE:So you better hope that dan doesn't nod off and crush you.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, i'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:David.
SUPMALE:I lied, okay? I can't believe you just embarrassed him like that.
LEADMALE:He didn't want me to know he was skipping school.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah, i know how strict you are on that kinda thing.
SUPMALE:Well, he just got done telling me how happy he is.
LEADMALE:And you bought that? No, but at least i didn't throw it back in his face and humiliate him.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, i have to do everything around here! dinner's ready! D.j. , you wash your hands? God, i hope so.
LEADMALE:So, what happened, d.j. ? i thought you were gonna eat over at your friend george's house? I got mad at him, so i came home and played by myself.
LEADMALE:Count to 10.
LEADMALE:Jackie said you had a story published in the school's literary journal.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:So what happens in it? Oh, it's not a narrative.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing happens.
LEADMALE:Look, i don't think you'd get it.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, well, gee, darlene, don't you be 'shamed to showing your brain around me and pa.
OTHERFEMALE:Every mama dreams of the day her youngin' will outlearn her.
LEADFEMALE:Course we's never much for your books and such.
LEADMALE:All right, fine.
OTHERFEMALE:The story's from the point of view of an old woman, and she's looking at a picture of herself when she was a kid.
LEADFEMALE:Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:You can read it.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Getting your story published isn't nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Just drop it, dan.
SUPMALE:Your story's getting published? where? In the school journal, but it's no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:It's just 'cause i'm friends with the editor.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear that, honey? She's got a friend.
OTHERMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:I have lots of friends.
OTHERMALE:She has lots of friends.
OTHERMALE:Well, i've got an idea.
LEADMALE:Let's talk about d.j. 's school.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i hear he got caught playing with his instrument in band.
OTHERMALE:I'm not in band, stupid! Okay, next subject.
SUPFEMALE:Dan how was work? Well, today was a special one for me.
SUPFEMALE:It was the 179th day in a row where i did exactly the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, d.j. over here is well on his way to shattering that record.
LEADMALE:I wanna hear more about how great school is.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to talk about school.
SUPFEMALE:What's the matter? you don't think i can take it? Tell us about the old lady in the story.
LEADMALE:I would, uh, like to talk about, uh jackie's pregnancy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, let's talk about jackie's pregnancy.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, she has to go to the bathroom a lot now because, uh right now, the fetus, it's really pressing on thebladder.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that would explain the glow.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand why nobody wants to talk about darlene.
LEADMALE:I mean, nothing's happening in our lives.
LEADMALE:She's at least doing stuff.
LEADMALE:I mean, she didn't do anything in high school.
SUPFEMALE:All she did was hang out with boy, you sure are a quick one, pa.
LEADMALE:Who told you i got caught playing with my instrument in band? so, it's pressing right up against the bladder, huh? Gee, dan, i hate this.
SUPFEMALE:Can't we keep him a little boy a little bit longer? put him in a freezer and just take him out on the holidays? Freezer's full, hon.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just put this lock on and get out of here.
SUPMALE:Aw, look at his little dinosaur sheets.
SUPMALE:Aw.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Oh! He's using my cosmo.
SUPMALE:That makes me like his dealer.
LEADFEMALE:And a montgomery ward catalog opened to the "young miss" section.
SUPMALE:A resourceful young lad.
LEADMALE:D.j. ! whoa! roseanne! I was sleepwalking again.
LEADFEMALE:What are we doing up here? think he bought it? I can't, roseanne.
SUPMALE:I don't know what to tell him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, didn't you ever have this talk with your parents? Yeah.
LEADMALE:My mom said-"you all right in there?" and i said, "i'll--i'll be right out!" well, he thinks we're spying on him, dan, so he thinks he's doing something bad.
LEADFEMALE:You want him to think that, dan? dan? why me? Because it's your turn.
LEADMALE:I talked to the girls after they got their periods.
LEADFEMALE:I talked to the girls after they got their periods.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean i talked to the girls about their periods.
SUPFEMALE:All right, i'll do it.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:And you know, dan, if you handle it right, then maybe he will come to us and feel comfortable later if he has, you know, an questions about sex.
OTHERFEMALE:And that would be good? I don't why i bother to come home! I don't know why either.
LEADFEMALE:You can feel sorry for me in chicago.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what, david? If it'll make you happy, i'll try not to think about you at all in chicago! Ah.
LEADFEMALE:To be young and in love.
SUPMALE:Well, i'll handle this one.
LEADMALE:You go find d.j. oh, man! So, uh, david, you wanna tell me what you and darlene are fighting about? Not really.
LEADMALE:Well, don't you wanna hear what i have to say? Sure, i'll have a seat.
LEADFEMALE:You know, david, i think that someplace in your head you think darlene's gonna start hating school and come back home, but that's not gonna happen.
SUPMALE:She's happy there.
SUPFEMALE:David, are you listening to me? you can't depend on darlene for your happiness, you know? You gotta get out there and find out what it is you really want to do in life.
LEADMALE:Make sure it doesn't annoy me.
LEADMALE:And then go for it.
LEADFEMALE:I have no idea how to communicate, uh with a kid that doesn't yell back.
LEADMALE:Don't you have anything obnoxious to say? Well, that's a start.
LEADMALE:Hey! Uh, don't mind me.
SUPMALE:I was just gonna get something.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Hey, deej, um i think that you and me need to talk about some stuff.
OTHERMALE:I'm justi'm i'm just not it's just what i'm trying to say is look, is there anything you feel like asking me about? No.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Very good.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Okay, look, d.
LEADMALE:J look, buddy, i know you're really embarrassed right now.
OTHERFEMALE:I just want you to know that what you've been doing, it's just a part of growing up.
LEADFEMALE:So are you proud of me? Well, yeah, but not for this.
SUPMALE:Uh the point is i'm not upset with you.
LEADMALE:This is something that everybody does.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Do you do it? Like i said, d.j. , everybody does it.
LEADMALE:How much do you do it? Look, deej, the funny thing about this is even though it's okay and everybody does it, there's nothing wrong with it nobody ever ever talks about it.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go, darlene! this bus is moving out! Oh, by the way, d.j. asked me to bring over my back issues of mademoiselle.
OTHERFEMALE:He said it's for some school project.
LEADFEMALE:It's more like a home project.
SUPMALE:No need to send 'em back.
LEADMALE:This is really great.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna miss you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'll call you as soon as i get back to school.
OTHERFEMALE:If you have the time.
SUPMALE:No pressure.
LEADMALE:Well, call me as soon as you get there, no matter if you have the time or not.
LEADFEMALE:Big pressure.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Need any money? Yeah! Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Have a safe trip.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. ! darlene's leaving! good! Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Well, david it looks like you and darlene patched up your problems after that little talk we had.
LEADMALE:No, no, no! Your happiness is thanks enough.
LEADFEMALE:I was thinking about what you said to me, about my not being happy and that i should do something about it.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:You really listened to me? You are getting weirder and weirder.
SUPFEMALE:I talked to my mom in michigan last night, and i told her i'm gonna go live with her.
SUPMALE:What? I didn't mean that you had to leave.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:You've been great to me.
OTHERFEMALE:But as long as i live here, i'm just gonna be dependent on darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but i mean you can't go back there, david.
LEADMALE:You remember how mean your mom was to you? Well, she's trying to change.
LEADFEMALE:Wellshe says she's trying to change.
LEADFEMALE:Honey.
LEADMALE:Don't "honey" me, dan! Does darlene know about this? No, i was gonna call her as soon as i got to michigan.
LEADMALE:If i told her now, she'd just try to talk me out of it.
LEADMALE:Well, sure she would because she cares about you.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't wanna see you screw up your life.
SUPMALE:That's enough, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:No, dan, that is not enough! It's not enough 'til he changes his mind.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to make you mad, i just can't stay here.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know you'll always have a home if you need one.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:What'd you make him leave for? We can't stop him from going back to his mom.
LEADMALE:But you know how his mom is, dan.
SUPMALE:She's not gonna change.
OTHERFEMALE:She's not gonna get any better.
SUPFEMALE:Then he knows he can come back.
LEADMALE:We just keep losing 'em.
LEADMALE:This one's not even ours.
OTHERFEMALE:Come here and give your mommy a hug.
LEADMALE:Uh-uh! Where you going? Dad told me not to say.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he said he was gonna move back to michigan.
SUPFEMALE:He wanted to tell you himself, but i just thought you should know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, did he say why he was leaving? He said he felt too dependent on you living here.
OTHERFEMALE:Where would he get a stupid idea like that? Oh, well, frankly from your father.
LEADFEMALE:What if this means that i never see him again? This really sucks, mom.
LEADMALE:Hey, fred, you want to grab something at the lunch box with me? Jackie'll be there.
SUPMALE:As will your unborn child.
LEADFEMALE:No, i got to stop running after her.
LEADMALE:Think i've asked her out she always says now.
LEADMALE:It's as if she doesn't want to go out with me.
SUPMALE:Fred, allow me to offer you a small dating tip.
SUPFEMALE:Ears.
SUPMALE:Excuse me? Jackie's a little sensitive about her ears.
LEADMALE:She thinks they're too big.
OTHERMALE:Gee, i never noticed.
SUPMALE:Just like a man.
OTHERFEMALE:Trust me on this one.
SUPFEMALE:Every woman has a body part they worry about.
LEADFEMALE:You zero in on the right one, you can get anything you want.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:Yeah? You're looking particularly slender today.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll put through that raise immediately.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, does dan conner work here? No, he's the boss.
LEADMALE:Uh, i'm phyllis zimmer.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an old friend of danny's from high school.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think it would be okay if i went in there? Okay, but don't make too much noise.
LEADFEMALE:I just put him down for his nap.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my god! It's dan conner, the big football star.
SUPFEMALE:I think he looked at me.
LEADMALE:Phyllis zimmer.
LEADMALE:My god! What in the world are you doing here? Well, i'm in town for a couple of days, and i was driving by the school, and i got to thinking about old times.
SUPFEMALE:You look terrific.

SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She's great.
LEADFEMALE:Am i making you uncomfortable? I mean, you know, because of ourthing.
LEADMALE:Aw, come on, hey, hey, that was 25 years ago.
LEADFEMALE:We were in high school! Me and roseanne were broke up at the time.
LEADMALE:Roseanne ever find out about us? Yeah.
LEADMALE:False, false, crown, bridge.
LEADFEMALE:I guess she probably wouldn't want us to go to lunch then.
LEADFEMALE:Nah, she wouldn't care.
LEADFEMALE:She's be okay.
LEADMALE:She wouldn't mind.
SUPMALE:She could come with us.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, she could, she could.
SUPFEMALE:I could call her and she could come, but she's working.
LEADMALE:Then it's just you and me.
LEADFEMALE:I guess so.
OTHERMALE:Hey, we could go to the place we used to go.
SUPMALE:Well, under the bleachers is an unusual spot for lunch, but, hey, what the hell? Hey, jackie.
LEADMALE:Hi, fred.
SUPMALE:Think fast.
LEADFEMALE:Earrings? Oh, i can't take these from you.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, i saw 'em in a store and they just, i don't know, made me think of your ears.
OTHERMALE:What? what about 'em? they're just petite, you know? Delicate.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Can't really take credit for that.
LEADMALE:Although i have always tried to sleep on them evenly.
LEADMALE:Wellguess i'll see you around.
LEADMALE:You know, fred, um maybe if we went out to dinner again sometime it wouldn't be that bad.
LEADFEMALE:Really? so if i asked you to go out with me tonight at 8:00 for dinner, you'd say yes? Yeah, i would.
LEADFEMALE:That's good to know.
SUPFEMALE:Fred! Yeah, deal.
LEADMALE:So what's dan doing today? Oh, he's having lunch with some old friend from high school.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? who? Maybe i know him.
LEADFEMALE:I think it was phyllis zimmer.
SUPMALE:My god, really? No, maybe not.
SUPMALE:Not if it's gonna get dan in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it could.
SUPMALE:They slept together in high school.
OTHERMALE:If roseanne finds out about this, she's gonna freak out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she doesn't have to find out.
LEADMALE:Well, i can't lie to my sister.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think it would be wrong.
LEADFEMALE:No, i mean i can't lie to my sister.
OTHERFEMALE:I always try, she can always tell.
SUPMALE:Jackie, come here a minute.
OTHERMALE:I'm busy! no, you're not! See? Hi, fred.
SUPFEMALE:Where's dan? Well, hey, look what fred gave me.
OTHERMALE:Look at that.
OTHERMALE:Says he can't stop thinking about my ears.
LEADMALE:That's sweet, isn't it.
LEADMALE:Just what you want to hear from somebody who's seen you naked.
SUPMALE:So, uh, fred, how come dan didn't come down with you? Well, dan couldn't come because he had to have lunch at a seminar.
LEADMALE:Had to go to a motor seminar in dekalb.
LEADFEMALE:Where theyseminar on all the motors that they'll be using.
SUPMALE:Well, fred, how come you didn't go with him? who, fred? Well, fred fred was gonna go.
LEADMALE:And--and, uh fred? It's only for bosses.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:Well, i guess dan finally gets to lead that glamorous powerful life that he's always dreamed of.
LEADFEMALE:I feel just like jackie kennedy.
SUPMALE:It's only for bosses.
OTHERFEMALE:That's really amazing the way you just did that.
OTHERFEMALE:That's weren't lying about my ears, were you? Hey, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:Roseanne's in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:Chicken's in the fridge.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, that's okay.
LEADMALE:I already had lunch.
LEADMALE:Usual place.
LEADMALE:I always eat at the same place.
OTHERMALE:I'm very loyal that way.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a very loyal luncher.
SUPFEMALE:What exactly are we saying about lunch, jackie? I know, dan.
SUPMALE:Oh, jeez.
LEADMALE:What happened? what do you mean what happened? Nothing happened.
SUPMALE:All right, i believe you, but it was still really, really bad.
SUPFEMALE:You took out the one woman in the world roseanne never wanted you to see again to lunch.
LEADFEMALE:How could you do that? I don't know.
LEADMALE:It was noon.
SUPMALE:I was hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember how nuts she went when she found out what you guys did in high school? yeah, and we're not gonna put her through that again, are we? No, of course not.
OTHERMALE:Dan, roseanne is very sensitive about this.
OTHERMALE:And we know how dangerous she is when she gets sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:So if you don't tell her then there's no problem.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, there is! 'cause you made me lie to my sister.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man, you lied to her? She always knows when you lie to her! It's okay.
LEADMALE:Told her a really good one this time.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, is that you? what are you doing? I'mwatching the game with dan.
LEADMALE:Go, team! First down buffalo at the 39 yard line.
SUPMALE:You are the worst! jackie, get in here! What'd you tell her? I told her that you went to elgin to a motor seminar.
LEADMALE:What the hell's a motor seminar? I don't know! Ask roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:She's the one that bought it.
LEADMALE:Oh, milky way bars in the pudding.
LEADMALE:What's the occasion? oh, dan did the coolest thing, you know? Right after he finished with that motor seminar, he came right home, he called in sick, and we spent the whole afternoon, you know, doing it.
LEADMALE:He had sex with you afterthat? Oh, yeah, but it wasn't just sex.
LEADMALE:I mean, it was like the best sex we have ever had since, uh since we started having sex.
LEADFEMALE:My god! Oh, chill out, jackie.
LEADMALE:It's not like i told you that we did it in here or nothing.
LEADFEMALE:We did it in here.
OTHERMALE:Hey, girls.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? well, we're talking about you? really? Yeah, i was just telling jackie how you were showing me all that stuff that you learned about motors.
LEADMALE:Vroom vroom! Oh, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:That trip to elgin really paid off.
OTHERMALE:I thought you said it was in dekalb.
SUPFEMALE:Uh jackie said it was dekalb? No, no.
LEADMALE:Motor seminars are always in elgin.
LEADMALE:What were you thinking? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Elgin, dekalb, i see, it was originally scheduled for dekalb, and then they moved it to elgin.
LEADMALE:They moved it to elgin from dekalb.
LEADMALE:That explains it.
LEADMALE:Oh, i totally believe everything that you guys are saying.
SUPMALE:See, that makes liars of all three of us.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Dan and i were planning a big surprise party for your birthday last month.
LEADMALE:I'm so bad at this.
SUPMALE:Look, rosie.
LEADMALE:Jackie thought she could help me by lying, but the whole thing is no big deal.
OTHERMALE:I had lunch with an old friend who was passing through town.
SUPFEMALE:We talked about you the whole time.
LEADFEMALE:You remember phyllis zimmer.
OTHERMALE:God, she really likes you.
LEADMALE:Honey, it was only lunch.
LEADMALE:Honey? Oh, god.
SUPFEMALE:This is really bad.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, i mean this is really bad.
LEADMALE:I'm parked behind her.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie's never left before.
LEADMALE:Well, never would have happened if you hadn't been with another woman.
OTHERFEMALE:"been with"? I had lunch with phyllis.
SUPMALE:And? And you lied about it badly.
SUPFEMALE:And you came home and had sex with roseanne.
SUPMALE:How do you think that made her feel? Pretty damn happy judging from this pudding.
SUPMALE:No, it was humiliating.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you were thinking about phyllis while you were having sex with roseanne.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, that is just completely and totally not true! So there's no connection at all between you having lunch with phyllis today and having sex with roseanne? For your information, jackie, i have had sex with roseanne many times without having lunch with phyllis, so your whole theory goes right out the window.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, i just got one question.
LEADFEMALE:If you're completely innocent, you did nothing wrong, why do you think your wife just stormed out that door? why are you here? You don't live here.
LEADMALE:You're not married to anyone in this house.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you go out that door, get a life of your own? then you can screw that up instead of messing with mine! You want to know how innocent i am? I could have.
SUPMALE:Could have what? She wanted me, jackie.
OTHERMALE:How do you know that? Men know.
SUPFEMALE:She did the eyelash thing.
OTHERFEMALE:She did the hip thing.
SUPFEMALE:She did all the things.
LEADMALE:I could have had her right then and there, but i never even thought about it! You could have "had her.
LEADFEMALE:" the ramada was right next door.
OTHERFEMALE:The vacancy sign was on.
SUPMALE:And if i was a different kind of guy, i could have had lunch, phyllis, a quick shower, and been back at work by 2:00.
SUPMALE:Well, it's a good thing you never thought about it! That's how the weather is shaping up today.
SUPFEMALE:Now back to charles in new york.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good morning, america.
SUPFEMALE:I'm charles gibson.
SUPFEMALE:And i'm joan lunden.
LEADMALE:Rosie? where is mom? I need breakfast.
LEADMALE:She's not in the bedroom? Nope.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think she slept here.
LEADFEMALE:The bed's not messed up.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't be silly, d.j. you know how sometimes your mom sleeps on the floor because she doesn't want to make the bed.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, i'll cook you breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know how to cook.
SUPMALE:I'll barbecue you breakfast! So, how do you like your eggs, sport? hey, did you ever see the movie rocky? Mom didn't come home, did she.
LEADFEMALE:Deej, you need to eat some healthy food.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! How 'bout some cream-style corn? I'm not hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, we can have mommy's pudding for breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:It's fortified with milky ways.
OTHERMALE:Why aren't you telling me where mom is? Deej your mom and i had a little fight last night.
LEADMALE:You guys always fight.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but this time i guess i messed up pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna get a divorce, are you? I'm the only kid in my class whose parents are married to each other.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry, son.
SUPMALE:Your mom's coming home.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's gonna be okay.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you go upstairs and get ready, and i'll drive you to school.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne get back? Oh.
LEADMALE:Really scary, huh? Yeah, it is.
LEADMALE:You want me to make you some coffee? Jackie, my wife's gone, my son is worried we're gonna get a divorce, and it's all my fault.
OTHERMALE:I'll make you a big pot.
SUPMALE:I don't know how i could have been so selfish.
LEADMALE:Well, dan, you couldn't have known that roseanne would react so badly.
LEADFEMALE:We've been married long enough.
OTHERMALE:I should know exactly how she'd react.
OTHERMALE:Then why did you go to lunch with phyllis? 'cause she walked in and it was like i was 20 years younger.
SUPFEMALE:It just felt good.
LEADFEMALE:Not many people make me feel that way anymore.
SUPMALE:The last few years i've just felt so damn resistible.
LEADFEMALE:Danthat's crazy.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, whatever.
LEADMALE:Dan, there's a lot of women find you very attractive.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Who? You should hear what some of the women customers say about you down at the lunch box.
LEADMALE:What? Well, i promised not to tell, but let's just say the phrase "fine piece of tail" was used quite often.
LEADMALE:Jackie, you know, you're getting a whole lot better at this lying thing.
LEADMALE:I'm back.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now you got cable.
LEADFEMALE:Dan he's worried sick about where you are.
LEADMALE:He just feels horrible.
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
OTHERMALE:No, he feels really, really bad.
LEADMALE:It's kind of a mid-life thing.
SUPFEMALE:Guys get to this point in their life where they have to bolster their ego.
SUPFEMALE:It's not unhealthy.
SUPMALE:It can be a natural phase in a loving relationship.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm trying to turn down the oprah show so i can hear you better.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:That's not oprah.
SUPMALE:That's you.
LEADFEMALE:He just wanted somebody to think he was, you know, attractive.
LEADMALE:Oh, poor boy.
OTHERMALE:Dan doesn't think he's attractive.
SUPFEMALE:Well, life is tough, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes i don't think dan's attractive either.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Cut him a break.
SUPFEMALE:It was--it was lunch! Yeah, when i feel all old and crummy, you don't see me having lunch with donnie van steenus.
SUPMALE:Donnie van steenus is dead.
SUPFEMALE:Well, be that as it may, jackie, not all my old boyfriends are dead.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure i could rustle up one or two of 'em that would be willing to buy me a sandwich.
SUPFEMALE:Haven't you punished dan enough? He had sex with phyllis all afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't have sex with phyllis.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, he did, jackie.
SUPMALE:He just used my body.
OTHERMALE:And let me tell you something.
SUPFEMALE:She's been getting it a whole lot better than i have lately.
LEADMALE:You don't know what was going on in dan's mind.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe phyllis just made him feel good about himself, and the important thing is he came home to you.
LEADFEMALE:In his mind, he was having sex with phyllis! Okay? Can't believe he let that woman on my kitchen table.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, what if he did? haven't you ever fantasized about anybody? No, not about anybody that i, you know, could really get.
SUPMALE:Except for fabio.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:No, it's true.
LEADFEMALE:Fabio, he could show up in lanford, you know, and be looking around for a loose meat sandwich.
LEADMALE:You are never going to get fabio.
LEADMALE:Why do you have to ruin it for me? Well, anyway, so you have fantasized.
LEADMALE:It is very different, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:How? because haven't you heard of the double standard? And besides, dan lied to me.
LEADFEMALE:He just--he lied to protect you.
LEADMALE:Well, he didn't protect me, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:He just made me feel really, really horrible.
LEADMALE:Well, you made him feel really, really horrible back.
LEADMALE:He's sitting on a couch scares his wife is off someplace.
SUPMALE:You won this one.
SUPMALE:Can't you just be big about it? oh so you really think he's sitting over there all by himself on the couch? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess i can go talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:You bought it, didn't you.
LEADMALE:Dan's here.
LEADFEMALE:I said he was home, but he's here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't sleep very well without you last night.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you still slept, right? Rosie, i'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Please come home.
LEADMALE:Do you wanna go somewhere and talk? Yeah, i guess.
SUPMALE:No, i can't, because i have to go to the school first and make sure d.j. got a decent lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about it, i made him lunch.
LEADFEMALE:You did? No, i lied again.
LEADMALE:Isn't it great? Glad you're back.
LEADMALE:I'm glad for you.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's great we have the kind of relationship where we can talk about stuff.
OTHERMALE:Especially if one of us is completely in the wrong and you're completely in the right.
LEADMALE:Dan, just get naked and show me how sorry you are.
SUPFEMALE:If you want to think about other men sometimes, it's okay with me.
SUPFEMALE:I can live with that.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't need to do that, dan, unlike some people.
OTHERMALE:I have evolved.
LEADMALE:Rosie, i'm just glad you love me for who i am.
LEADFEMALE:I know i'm not perfect.
LEADMALE:In my eyes, you're pretty close.
LEADFEMALE:I washed my armpits with a washcloth.
OTHERFEMALE:Just the way you like it.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, don't talk.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:I don't care, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:If becky and mark can come home and sit through your father's stupid, boring, dull 25th reunion of his stupid, boring, god-awful football team, then so can you.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be fun! See ya later.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Herbs? spices? measuring? Why, this is some kind of recipe.
LEADMALE:Yes, i wanted to do something special 'cause of becky and mark coming home, so i'm making this here "chicken barbara walters" like they got in the tv guide this week.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, don't get me wrong, i'm really glad becky and mark are coming home for the reunion, buti'm just worried.
SUPFEMALE:Things get a little tense when they're in the house, and well, the guys will see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, i can understand why you wouldn't want to be embarrassed in front of a guy who used to eat french fries by sucking them through his nose.
LEADMALE:Reunion's a big day for me, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:I don't get big days.
SUPFEMALE:I think in my whole life, i've had a total of three.
OTHERFEMALE:What's that, when the kids were born? Six.
LEADMALE:I suppose one of those is our wedding day, huh? Okay, so i don't count specific days! But tomorrow's gonna be a biggie, and i know you're gonna get in a fight with mark and wreck it.
SUPMALE:Becky and mark just pulled up! I'm not going to fight with mark because i want becky to come home and visit more often.
SUPFEMALE:So i'm just gonna hold it in all weekend.
LEADMALE:No matter what stupid thing mark says, i'm just gonna ignore it.
LEADFEMALE:You can do that? you can be nice to mark? Dan, whether you realize it or not, i'm actually a very forgiving person, you know.
LEADMALE:Didn't i forgive you for not picking me up from work two weeks ago? No, you haven't.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why should i? [becky]not to speed.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to get here by dinnertime.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i didn't know they had a dinnertime at this house.
SUPFEMALE:I thought it was just grazing 24 hours a day.
LEADFEMALE:Breathe in breathe out.
LEADMALE:Hi! hey! Happy reunion, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Mark! hi! Boy, i missed you.
LEADFEMALE:Hi! Dan, it's mark.
LEADMALE:Hey, good to see ya.
SUPMALE:Same here.
LEADMALE:Hey, deej, you got bigger.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm in puberty! You ever heard of it? hey, how was your drive? Well, we would have got here sooner if we hadn't stopped at the colonel's for chicken.
OTHERFEMALE:So you already ate? Well, mark couldn't wait anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You guys didn't go to any trouble, did you? Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:Not at all.
SUPFEMALE:I was hoping we could all sit in the kitchen and catch up.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADMALE:Um, i'll justgo out there and clear the table.
SUPMALE:Well, while we're waiting, why don't we just sit here and rest our bones for a minute? Okay.
LEADMALE:Table's clear.
LEADMALE:Okay, 5-card draw, deuces wild.
LEADMALE:Ante up.
LEADMALE:Nothing that's been bitten or sucked on.
LEADFEMALE:But enough about jackie, let's play poker.
SUPFEMALE:So, dan, uh perry watkins must not be coming is they asked you to make the speech.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe they asked me to make the speech 'cause i'm the only one who's uniform still fits.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and better than ever, too, honey.
SUPMALE:'cause remember who you used to have to stuff it with all them pads and socks and everything? who's perry watkins? He's this guy from high school that your dad was very competitive with.
LEADFEMALE:He's not a guy i was competitive with.
OTHERFEMALE:He was guy i was better than.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow night, we're gonna show him it's still true.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you worry about nothing, pa.
LEADMALE:Me and the youngins gonna do you real proud.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna put in our white store buck teeth.
LEADFEMALE:And nobody's gonna mention that d.j. was born with a tail.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, i wanna help make your party really great.
LEADMALE:Thanks, son.
LEADFEMALE:At least somebody in this family is sticking up for the old man.
SUPMALE:I brought up all those tv trays and arranged them around the living room.
LEADMALE:Then i moved around the chairs so people have more room to talk.
LEADMALE:Well, isn't that handy? Just as your football buddies show up, your son has discovered his passion for interior decorating.
SUPMALE:You know, deej, tomorrow's an important night for mom, too, so we're gonna let her take all the credit for the decorating.
OTHERMALE:Okay! Hey, dad why don't you practice your speech on us? Nah.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on! No, you don't want to hear it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on! Nope.
LEADMALE:Nope.
OTHERFEMALE:Nope.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I ain't much for speechifying, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Ahem.
OTHERMALE:"25 years ago on this same field, a bunch of guys got together--" sit down, you bum! "to play a little game we call football.
OTHERFEMALE:" bring on the pom-pom broads! come on! Oh, we're just being the audience for you, you know, to rehearse.
LEADMALE:Cut it out.
OTHERFEMALE:"little did they know they they--" show us your boobs! "little did they know" "that they would be honored here today.
LEADFEMALE:Now let's go kick some butt in the second half.
SUPMALE:" uh, is that it? that's the whole speech? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yay! hey, dan what is that on your forehead? what? is that a pimple? Oh, man! oooh, man! oh, man! No, it's not that bad, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You can hardly notice it.
LEADMALE:Quit staring at my forehead.
LEADMALE:Hey! Don't you go fooling with that now.
LEADMALE:It's not gonna be ready 'til sunday, and then it's mine! Okay, becky.
SUPMALE:I'm ready to go.
SUPFEMALE:I think i wanna stay here.
SUPMALE:Can i talk to you for a minute? what? I just want to spend some time with my family.
OTHERMALE:What about my friends? I haven't seen 'em in a year.
SUPFEMALE:You should've taped it when they were on america's most wanted.
LEADMALE:So you're just not gonna show up now? You go out without me all the time, mark.
OTHERMALE:Why should tonight be any different? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go alone.
SUPMALE:And i'll have a better time without you.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, becky, are you okay? I'm gonna go unpack.
LEADMALE:Did you hear that? He's cheatin' on her.
LEADFEMALE:Cheatin' on her? All she said was he goes out a lot.
LEADFEMALE:So where do you suppose he goes? He's certainly not going out to think.
LEADFEMALE:She's a married woman now.
OTHERMALE:She's got to make her own choices.
SUPMALE:You get in the middle of this, it's just gonna make it worse.
SUPMALE:I gotta do something.
SUPMALE:What are you gonna do? I'm gonna go pop dan's zit.
LEADMALE:I thought you said it wasn't ready? Tough! i am! Well, there's four hours of my life i'll never get back.
LEADMALE:It was cool seeing all your dad's friends again after all these years.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, they sure have changed a lot since before i was born.
LEADFEMALE:Hard to believe your dad's the one who didn't let himself go.
LEADMALE:I think darlene should have to help with the party.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, i'd love to, deej, but i gotta leave in like, an hour, so that means i have to go lie on my bed and stare at the clock.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we all contributed in our own way.
SUPMALE:What's my job at the party? Coats.
SUPFEMALE:Take them in my bedroom and put them on the bed, and don't go through the pockets.
SUPFEMALE:Then there was the time nobody'd straighten out my nose and i had to do it myself.
LEADFEMALE:Talk about painful.
LEADMALE:That's nothin', dan.
LEADMALE:Remember the time i played the entire second half of the west game with a dislocated shoulder? Now that's pain.
OTHERMALE:One time i went to the hospital and they ripped open my stomach and they took a human being out of me.
OTHERMALE:Welcome to the conner castle.
LEADMALE:Make yourselves at home.
SUPMALE:Thank you, thank you, thank you.
SUPMALE:Yes, check your coats with d.j. here.
LEADMALE:D.j. 's gonna be a heck of a player someday.
SUPFEMALE:Check out perry.
LEADFEMALE:Get a load of that big bald head of his.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i bet nobody would have noticed if he would have just worn a great big band-aid over it.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Did you notice that becky and mark didn't sit together at the game? Yes, i did.
LEADFEMALE:And did you notice that i didn't say one thing to them? I did, and i'm very proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:For once you acted like a normal person.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:A normal person.
OTHERFEMALE:It's all part of my plan.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? What usually happens is that mark does something really mean to becky, and then i yell at mark, and then instead of hating mark, becky ends up hating me.
OTHERFEMALE:So what are you gonna do? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just going to make sure that she knows i'm here for her and i'm gonna wait for her to come to me.
SUPFEMALE:And until then, i am not going to meddle.
LEADMALE:I am not going to get involved at all.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, look! Somebody gave me a tip.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Like all you need is something else to stunt your growth.
LEADMALE:Just stop it.
SUPFEMALE:All right, becky? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead and go, then.
LEADFEMALE:Um, becky.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, i want you to know that i'm here for you if there's anything that you'd like to share with me.
SUPMALE:No, mother.
LEADMALE:There's nothing i want to share with you.
OTHERFEMALE:You think i can't run my own life? No, this is just something new that i'm doing with all the kids.
SUPMALE:D.j. , is there anything you'd like to share with me? Yes.
OTHERMALE:I think i should get paid for carrying the coats because darlene-yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Go back to work.
LEADFEMALE:You call that acting like a normal person? You about blew it with becky.
LEADFEMALE:No, i did not.
OTHERFEMALE:I was laying the groundwork.
OTHERMALE:She knows the door is open.
SUPMALE:Next time mark acts like a jerk, she'll walk right through it.
LEADMALE:It's part of my long-range plan.
LEADFEMALE:It's possible that becky and mark aren't gonna break up.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes they will.
LEADMALE:How do you know that? Because it's the plan.
SUPMALE:Mom if i was to leave mark, would you guys let me move back in here? Of course we would, becky.
SUPFEMALE:We have room for you.
OTHERMALE:'cause i was just asking for the sake of discussion.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I knew that.
SUPFEMALE:You are a spooky little woman.
OTHERFEMALE:Great party, huh? Yeah, there's more big, fat, smelly people in this house than i remember.
LEADMALE:I get to move back in here.
OTHERMALE:What's with these dolls, anyways? Mom's redecorating the room to make it look like we had a happy childhood.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, if you and mark were sleeping in here last night, how come the beds aren't pushed together? It's not like we have to do it every night, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:We're not animals.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's right.
LEADMALE:Mark can use tools.
SUPMALE:So, how's school? Great.
LEADFEMALE:I'm constantly stressed out, i don't get much sleep, sometimes i get this pain in my right eye.
LEADFEMALE:Could be a tumor.
LEADFEMALE:But at least i'm not here with the hindenburgs.
LEADMALE:I mean, there's good stuff too, right? I'm sure you've got some great teachers and there's lots of cute guys.
SUPMALE:Becky, it's not like you're 100 years old.
LEADFEMALE:If you want to go to college, go to college.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't go to my college.
LEADMALE:Can i ask you something? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:What? was it hard to leave david? i mean, did he take it bad? Well, you know, at first.
LEADFEMALE:But we worked it out.
LEADFEMALE:Man, that took a lot of guts.
SUPMALE:Whatever.
OTHERFEMALE:No, seriously.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think i could do something like that.
LEADMALE:I'm really proud of you.
LEADMALE:Ugh.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i can handle the guilt of lying to mom, but i can't handle you slobbering all over me.
LEADFEMALE:Um, david isn't living with his mom in michigan.
LEADMALE:He's living with me in chicago.
LEADFEMALE:You gotta be kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:No, i'm not kidding, so you just gotta keep your mouth shut, okay? darlene, are you sure you know what you're doing? This is serious stuff.
LEADMALE:Look, it's no big deal.
LEADMALE:But you're living together.
OTHERMALE:You guys are having sex, right? No, i force him to sleep naked next to me every night, yet i give him nothing.
LEADFEMALE:You think that makes me a tease? I know that now you're in college you think you know everything, but i'm just trying to give you a little advice here.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you should let sex totally rule your life.
OTHERMALE:That's funny.
SUPMALE:That's the exact same speech mom gave me.
LEADFEMALE:But you forgot to say, "or you'll end up like becky.
LEADMALE:" you know, perry, i really should've gotten a haircut for the party.
SUPFEMALE:I have trouble keeping up with it.
LEADMALE:Quite a place you have here, dan.
LEADMALE:I can see why the hair means a lot to you.
LEADMALE:You know, perry, when you have a family, you put things in perspective.
LEADMALE:Hey, d.j. the old man's over here.
SUPMALE:You never started a family, did you, perry? No.
SUPFEMALE:Funny thing about they're just not looking for a commitment.
SUPFEMALE:Well, when you're alone you have the time to read all about that kind of stuff.
LEADMALE:Hey, son! Do you know what darlene just said to me? This is our youngest, d.j. he loves his big sister, darlene, don't you, son.
SUPMALE:Now what did big sis' say to you? She misses me.
SUPFEMALE:And she loves me.
OTHERMALE:Attaboy.
SUPFEMALE:Now you go run and help your mom in the kitchen, tiger.
SUPMALE:Hey, deej! Wow.
OTHERMALE:Let's see what else we have in the old memory box here.
LEADMALE:Regional champs, 1968! whoo! yay! I thought we lost to lakeside in the regionals.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we did, but we won the fight in the parking lot afterward.
LEADMALE:Ah! Here's a little something of interest to the happily married couple, jim and sarah.
LEADFEMALE:A list that jim wrote junior year of all the scores he made.
LEADMALE:Off the field.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! whoa! Wow.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, your name is on there.
SUPMALE:And who can forget old charlie.
SUPFEMALE:Our spiritual leader.
SUPMALE:Who in order to inspire us, shaved off all the hair he hadn't cut in three years.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, perry.
OTHERFEMALE:That must hurt just looking at all that.
SUPMALE:And here's a little souvenir of dan and roseanne's first date.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, rosie.
OTHERMALE:You had to know about this.
LEADMALE:Everybody else at school did! Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Those aren't even mine.
LEADFEMALE:Who wants a brewski.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, dan.
LEADFEMALE:These better be your underwear or you're in a hell of a lot of trouble.
SUPFEMALE:I stole 'em from my mom.
LEADMALE:Please don't tell her.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, we didn't have sex until our second date.
LEADFEMALE:You ruined my reputation! Honey, please, please act like we're making up in here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, honey.
LEADMALE:I've been a bad boy! I'm the worst.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the worst.
LEADMALE:I'm scum.
SUPMALE:Please, i'll give you anything you want if you just walk back in there and act like we have a nice, happy marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Then it will be two more hours of my usual sweetness and light and then you are gonna owe me bigger than you have ever owed me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i guess ol' rosie doesn't want anybody but danny to see her undies.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a lucky man.
LEADFEMALE:You are a lucky man.
LEADMALE:Don't walk away from me! Go to hell.
OTHERMALE:Shut up, already.
SUPMALE:I'm sick of your mouth.
LEADMALE:I can't believe i married you.
SUPMALE:They're very active in community theater.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, what the hell are you doing? You sit in there screaming in the living room, embarrassing your dad in front of all these stupid idiots he's trying to impress.
LEADMALE:Could you shut that door, please? show 'em your zit! i hate mark! Why did you ever let me marry him? You know, it was kind of hard to cancel after i sent out 500 invitations and booked the country club.
SUPMALE:What am i gonna do, mom? Well, becky, help me to help you make the right decision.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell me all the rotten stuff he does to you.
SUPMALE:He's been in a bad mood ever since he lost his job.
LEADFEMALE:We don't talk anymore.
LEADMALE:Unless we're fighting about money.
LEADFEMALE:So i went out and got a job and he got mad at me for quitting school.
OTHERFEMALE:He did? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know that great apartment i was telling you about? It's a dump.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and i suppose he leaves you alone all the time.
LEADMALE:Probably going out with his friends, drinking, getting in fights and that type of thing, huh? No, he and his friends are always restoring this old car that no one's ever gonna buy.
LEADFEMALE:You mean he's working? But i never get to see him.
LEADMALE:Marriage sucks.
OTHERMALE:Well, becky, i'm still waiting to hear the bad stuff.
SUPMALE:Tell me that he cheats on you or he beats you up or something.
SUPMALE:I got nothing here.
LEADFEMALE:Mark would never do that.
OTHERMALE:Did he ever show your underwear to his friends? I just wish that we weren't married and we could go back to the way we used to be.
LEADMALE:When i lived here.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, so you want to get a divorce so that you can date him.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't work like that, becky.
LEADFEMALE:I should've known you wouldn't get it.
LEADFEMALE:No, i totally get it.
SUPFEMALE:Mark is out there working his butt off to save money so that his immature brat of a wife can go back to school.
SUPMALE:Why are you getting so mad? Because you are making me defend mark.
LEADMALE:So just tell me.
SUPFEMALE:I suppose you still love him.
SUPMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:And he loves you.
LEADFEMALE:What a day i'm having.
LEADMALE:But it doesn't help.
SUPFEMALE:We still fight all the time.
SUPMALE:Well, why don't we just bottom the whole rest of this day out, okay? why don't you and mark just move in here till you get on your feet? God, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm scared if we move back in here, we'll never leave.
LEADFEMALE:No, trust me.
LEADMALE:I will make sure that never happens.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess i could try to convince mark, but he's gonna be really unhappy here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well at least there's something in it for me.
SUPMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna have to check with dad about this? No, becky.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going to have to check with your dad about anything for a very, very long time.
LEADMALE:I cannot believe that they replaced that darren.
LEADMALE:Well, it was a hit show.
LEADFEMALE:They knew they could get away with anything.
SUPMALE:Well, i like the second darren much better.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeez! You see anybody? No.
LEADMALE:No prowler.
SUPMALE:Listen.
SUPFEMALE:Next time you hear something, don't call me, call the police.
OTHERFEMALE:They're specially trained to deal with people like you.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe the guy made it into the basement and he's just hiding out till the coast is clear.
LEADFEMALE:You'd have to break a window to get into the basement.
SUPFEMALE:Did you hear a window break? No.
LEADMALE:But maybe he attached a suction cup to the window pane, and cut a circle around it, and he silently removed the glass and then climbed in.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't think of that.
SUPFEMALE:No, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Better take that.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:You keep it.
LEADFEMALE:You need it more than i do.
OTHERMALE:I have my sanity to protect me.
SUPFEMALE:Be careful.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, be careful down there, dan! I just oiled that the action's real hot.
LEADMALE:Jackie! what? shut up! You see anything? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What's this? what? dan? what do you see? Dan! if you are able to, answer me! Your water heater's leaking.
LEADFEMALE:A joint's gotta be replaced.
LEADMALE:Um how does someone do that? Same way they do anything else.
LEADFEMALE:They ask their brother-in-law to do it for them! What's going on? I saw dan's truck outside.
SUPFEMALE:I thought i heard a burglar! Really? Yeah, but it was a false alarm.
SUPFEMALE:Um, you know, i was home.
LEADFEMALE:So? So you needed a man to protect you, and you called dan.
LEADMALE:Well, i was scared.
LEADFEMALE:It was just instinct.
LEADFEMALE:And your instinct was to call dan.
LEADMALE:Well, fred, my god! You know, i'm sorry i called dan because i heard a burglar.
LEADMALE:And, by the way, i'm fine.
SUPMALE:And so is your child.
LEADMALE:Thanks for asking.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hey, fred.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna need a wrench.
SUPMALE:What do you need a wrench for? Water heater's leaking.
SUPMALE:I'll fix it.
LEADMALE:I'm already greasy.
SUPMALE:No sense in both of us having to wash our hands tonight.
LEADMALE:No, really.
LEADFEMALE:I'll fix it.
OTHERMALE:Knock yourself out.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta get home anyway.
LEADFEMALE:It's graham cracker night.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just let dan fix the water heater? He's the one that installed it.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:And it's leaking.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you so angry? Oh, gee, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe there's nothing to be angry about.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess dan should just fix the leak and i should shut up.
LEADMALE:Oh, see? My milk is coming out.
LEADMALE:Can't you hold it? Yes, fred, and i can also write my name in the carpet.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why did that happen? You woke the baby, he started crying and now i'm leaking.
LEADMALE:Oh! well, hang on! i'll get dan! What are you doing? Uh, movin' the couch to see how much room we have for the wedding.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Honey? You know, dan, i've been telling you all week, i got a really bad feeling about this wedding.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:David? Sometimes it's easier to move mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner than it is to argue with her.
SUPFEMALE:Ho! God, look at that.
LEADMALE:It's a clean spot.
LEADFEMALE:I always thought we had indoor-outdoor.
SUPFEMALE:This here is shag.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, honey.
SUPMALE:We'll just cover the rest of the floor with furniture, and everyone will think we got new carpet.
LEADMALE:No, dan.
LEADMALE:Jackie cannot have her wedding in a room with a clean spot.
LEADFEMALE:This just proves that my bad feeling was right.
LEADFEMALE:This is a sign.
SUPFEMALE:I know it is, dear.
LEADMALE:But we agreed we'd wait for a really big sign, something more concrete, before you wrecked jackie's life.
LEADFEMALE:A really big sign, dan? what do you think of this? God almighty has marked our carpet.
SUPFEMALE:You just had a shock.
OTHERMALE:I mean, this carpet thing, it'd upset anybody, right, david? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm troubled by it.
LEADMALE:Look, honey, why don't you just take a nice, hot bath and relax, and you'll see, jackie's wedding will be a big success and jackie'll live happily ever after.
LEADFEMALE:Do not talk down to me like one of those husbands who is not afraid of his wife.
SUPFEMALE:Calgon's under the sink.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, do you think this is part of that "change of life" thing? Oh, if only this were a change.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner, this could get a lot worse.
OTHERFEMALE:And it will.
LEADFEMALE:But all we can do is walk on eggshells, and keep mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner submerged in warm water.
OTHERMALE:Why is she so upset? I thought she wanted jackie to get married.
SUPMALE:She does.
LEADMALE:But she's also unhappy about losing jackie to fred.
SUPFEMALE:And david, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner is never unhappy alone.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, man.
SUPMALE:Sorry i'm late.
OTHERFEMALE:Looks like i'm gonna have to have a couple of beers to catch up with you.
LEADFEMALE:Six.
SUPFEMALE:Wow! Anyway, let's talk about the, um, bachelor party.
SUPFEMALE:Now, the women have forbidden us from getting a stripper, so we're gonna have to hire one of them nude models from the art school, teach her how to dance.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.
SUPMALE:There's not gonna be any bachelor party.
LEADMALE:What? Oh, of course there's not gonna be a bachelor party.
SUPFEMALE:I gotcha.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, i heard about this shari lewis look-alike who does something incredible with lamb chop.
OTHERMALE:I'm serious, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not even sure there's gonna be a wedding.
LEADMALE:What? Hey, relax.
LEADFEMALE:Most guys get nervous before their weddings.
LEADMALE:I think they call it the moment of clarity.
SUPFEMALE:I'm tired of pretending that i'm the one she really wants.
OTHERMALE:Come on, man.
SUPMALE:It's just cold feet.
SUPFEMALE:There's another guy.
LEADMALE:She sees him almost every day.
LEADMALE:I'm not stupid! Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know leon that well.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you it's not leon, okay? It's not leon.
LEADMALE:It's you.
OTHERMALE:Me? are you kiddin'? My own wife's not even interested in me.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you have no idea how she talks about you.
SUPFEMALE:It's like you're the ideal man and no other guys can live up to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, man.
LEADMALE:You're talkin' stupid.
LEADMALE:She thinks you're like a god.
SUPMALE:All right, look, maybe a long time ago, when we first met, but that's a 20-year crush.
OTHERMALE:On me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, i'm not that great.
LEADMALE:Hey, can we have some more pretzels here, honey? You know, nobody even talks about it because it's like the biggest, dirtiest secret in the family.
SUPFEMALE:And i happen to know that you love it.
LEADMALE:I do not love it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not saying it's not flattering god, please.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you totally egg her on.
LEADFEMALE:That's why she's always having you come over to fix the same stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't egg her on.
LEADFEMALE:I just do sloppy work! Hey, next time she asks you over to help, just cut out the middleman and get into bed with her.
LEADFEMALE:That's enough.
OTHERMALE:I'm telling you right now, i would never take advantage of that, and i'm surprise you're even talking like this about her.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's right, because you're jackie's big protector.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:We're cutting you off.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna drive you home.
LEADFEMALE:Get your hands off of me.
LEADMALE:Okay, fine.
SUPMALE:But you're not gonna drive home.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, neither are you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's okay! He's getting married in a couple of days.
SUPMALE:Somebody call him a cab, would ya? Hi, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Hey,jackie! Dan, you know what's up with fred? I just dropped the baby off and he's being really snippy.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Nope, no, no idea.
LEADMALE:I don't know what's going on.
LEADFEMALE:It's like this all the time, lately.
SUPMALE:Things have gotten really bad between the two of us.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, i don't think you and me should be talking about you and fred.
LEADFEMALE:Why? he say something last night at the lobo? No, it's just i don't want to get in the middle of this.
LEADFEMALE:Fred's like my best friend and you and me, well, we're practically related.
SUPFEMALE:At least that's how i look at it.
LEADFEMALE:My god, what happened to your face? Nothin'.
SUPMALE:I just bumped into roseanne's elbow last night.
LEADMALE:Apparently, i was snoring.
LEADMALE:She really caught you one.
OTHERFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Just, you know, it's all right.
SUPFEMALE:Just ju ju hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, she was just looking at my face, that's all.
SUPMALE:I thought you and fred were gonna go ring shopping this morning.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't know, we might not even need rings, 'cause according to fred, there might not be a wedding.
LEADMALE:He actually said that to me.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:But it's just cold feet.
OTHERFEMALE:Right? People say crazy things all the time before they get married.
LEADMALE:Nothing to worry about, right? what? I think you should postpone the wedding.
LEADMALE:What? are you serious? Yeah, i've had a really bad feeling about it all week, but i just couldn't get to you 'cause dan kept me in the tub.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do you think, dan? Don't ask him! I think you should cancel the wedding.
LEADMALE:What? what? Could be that fred's problem is that he senses that you have a problem.
SUPMALE:And maybe you're questioning things because you still have some feelings about the past.
LEADFEMALE:About someone from the past, and and fred just doesn't measure up.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, right, dan.
LEADFEMALE:We'll call ya if we ever need some gibberish.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks a lot, you two.
LEADFEMALE:I had about that much confidence and you just stomped on it and stomped on it till it's all gone.
LEADMALE:Well, if you don't want our opinion i don't want your opinion.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna find somebody who'll tell me getting married is a good idea even if it isn't.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna ask mom.
LEADFEMALE:Man, i hope she's not making a mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what made you change your mind? First you were treating me like a nutcase, and now you agree.
OTHERMALE:I oughta put you in the tub.
LEADMALE:All right, i'll tell you.
LEADMALE:But you gotta promise me you won't think any less of jackie.
SUPMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Last night, fred told me something about the way jackie feels about me.
SUPFEMALE:What way was that? It's it's no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:It's just one of those crush things that a younger sister has on an older sister's husband, and it's so you think jackie has a crush on you.
OTHERFEMALE:Just a little crush.
LEADFEMALE:It's only natural.
LEADFEMALE:You are out of your clodhoppin', consarned, egg-suckin' mind! Well, fred thinks it's true.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, then he took a swing at me last night.
LEADFEMALE:He told me jackie thinks i'm like a god.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's just 'cause you never do nothin' on sunday.
LEADMALE:Think about it.
OTHERFEMALE:She's always asking me over there to fix stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow! And so is my mom.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god, my entire family's got the hots for you, dan.
LEADMALE:And leon wanted you to come over and fix that pipe.
LEADFEMALE:You better look out, hot stuff.
SUPFEMALE:You just don't wanna believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie has never said one thing about that to me, ever.
LEADMALE:Of course she wouldn't say anything to you! i'm your man! You're a gigantic fool.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you go ahead, you think i'm a fool, but at least i'm not selfish.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not selfish.
LEADMALE:It's so obvious what you're doing, roseanne.
SUPMALE:You don't want jackie to be married, 'cause then you'd have to share her with fred.
LEADFEMALE:You want to keep her all to yourself, even though it means she'll never be happy.
SUPMALE:You are so wrong.
LEADMALE:I mean, you are just so completely wrong.
LEADMALE:If you were any wronger at all, you would be in the guinness book of world records under "world's wrongest man.
LEADFEMALE:" hell, i got that title the day i married you! Hey.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
SUPMALE:So, how are you doing? Not good.
LEADMALE:I called up fred and i told him to come on over, 'cause you and dan are right.
LEADFEMALE:If he has this many doubts about it, maybe we shouldn't be married.
LEADFEMALE:I think you better think about this some more.
LEADFEMALE:I have been, and i'm starting to see fred for what he really is.
LEADFEMALE:Scared.
LEADMALE:Indecisive, emotionally unpredictable, and i don't want to be married to somebody like me.
LEADMALE:No, you should marry fred, jackie.
SUPMALE:And you wouldn't be having all these doubts if you hadn't been influenced by the very worst person on earth.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, mom wants me to be married.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Not mom.
LEADMALE:Me! I'm evil, and i must be stopped.
SUPFEMALE:I'm very confused.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it was always that i was the one that had the kids and was married to the great guy.
OTHERFEMALE:And now if you're gonna get married, well, we'll be tied.
LEADFEMALE:So you told me not to marry fred because you don't want us to be tied? Yeah, because, you know, if we're tied, then we'll be equal and then you won't need me anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh, roseanne! I know.
LEADMALE:I'm so stupid.
SUPMALE:I'm just hideous.
LEADMALE:Don't even look at me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course i will need you.
SUPFEMALE:Even with fred, my life is messed up.
OTHERMALE:You're just saying that to make me feel better.
LEADMALE:I'm not.
SUPMALE:I'm still stuck in a dead-end job.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's true.
LEADFEMALE:I have no confidence in my skills as a mother, so i really need you there.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's true.
LEADMALE:I am a damn good mother.
LEADFEMALE:Gotta be proud of the way david turned out.
LEADFEMALE:And you got me out of that fisher relationship mess, you got me started dating fred, and if it wasn't for you, i probably wouldn't be headed towards a life better than yours.
LEADFEMALE:I said, "tied!" it's pointless, anyway, because fred doesn't want me anymore.
SUPMALE:Oh, he wants you, jackie.
LEADMALE:He's just thinking all screwy.
OTHERMALE:'cause you know what? He thinks that you have the hots for dan.
LEADMALE:What? They had this great big fight about it at the lobo last night.
LEADMALE:Fred thinks that? Uh-huh.
OTHERFEMALE:He thinks that? yeah, and you know what's even scarier? Dan thinks it too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, fred.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:Jackie, i'm really glad you called, 'cause we need to talk.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, can you leave us alone? Well, no, fred, i don't need to, because i know what this is all about.
LEADMALE:You do? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Dan and jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i know.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i've always known.
LEADMALE:Oh, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I just don't think i can go through with all of this knowing how jackie feels about dan.
LEADFEMALE:I don't blame you at all, fred.
LEADMALE:I don't really see how any of us can get through this.
SUPFEMALE:That is why i've agreed to step aside and let jackie and dan be together.
OTHERFEMALE:What? As part of that bargain, you shall be mine.
SUPMALE:Jackie? I just came by with your wedding present.
LEADFEMALE:I can't come out.
LEADFEMALE:I got my dress on already.
LEADMALE:And we got enough strikes against us.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just leave it on the bed then.
OTHERFEMALE:No, wait.
OTHERMALE:Give it here.
SUPMALE:Oh, fred, it's a beautiful picture of you and the baby.
SUPFEMALE:I love it! Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sears had a coupon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of here.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne wanted me to give these to jackie.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, those'll look great.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i wore them at my wedding.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I'd yeah, i know, me too.
LEADMALE:I mean, it was just the wedding i know, i know.
SUPFEMALE:Fred, what are you doing with your arms? I'm just shaking hands.
LEADMALE:Is he gone? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Wow! Great dress.
LEADMALE:Great you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Roseanne wanted me to give you these.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Listen, i know she had that dumb idea about me walking you down the aisle, but if you'd rather go alone no! dan, no! I think it's a great idea.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, you did take a punch for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish roseanne hadn't told you everything about that.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right.
LEADMALE:I'm not embarrassed.
SUPMALE:Of course not.
SUPFEMALE:You're not the big goon that believed it all.
LEADMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:I might not have a crush on you, but i think you're an incredible guy.
LEADMALE:I have been out with so many jerks, and if i didn't know that there were guys like you out there, i would have given up on men a long time ago.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? really? So, i mean, in your eyes, i'm the perfect man.
SUPMALE:Uh, more like a god.
SUPMALE:Man, did she have to tell you everything? move it, you two! Well you ready? I think so.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Sounds like your son's ready for you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! what? what's the matter? Oh i'm leaking! oh! Well, it's not noticeable.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I had no reason to think this day would go well.
OTHERMALE:I mean, i've only been looking forward to it for 37 years! Come on, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you just, uh, go like this? Dan, when something is leaking, you don't apply pressure to it.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Wait, wait, wait.
SUPFEMALE:I got an idea.
LEADMALE:I got an idea.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:All right, here.
SUPMALE:An original creation by mr.
OTHERMALE:Dan.
OTHERMALE:It's not bad.
SUPFEMALE:Shall we? Okay.
SUPMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:It wasn't roseanne's idea for you to walk me down the aisle, it was mine.
LEADFEMALE:You want me.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, do you take jackie to be your lawfully wedded wife? I do.
LEADFEMALE:And jackie, do you take fred to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do.
SUPFEMALE:By the power vested in me by the state of illinois, i now pronounce you husband and wife.
SUPMALE:You may kiss the bride.
LEADMALE:Just let me switch sides first.
OTHERMALE:I suppose you're next, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, no, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I drink my milk from a glass now.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, now.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:See? I told you that amnio wouldn't be that bad.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:They stick a needle in my stomach, and they suck out a bunch of goo.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to come back tomorrow and see if they can do that for my butt.
OTHERMALE:Well, what do you think it's gonna be, a boy or a girl? Well, boy or girl really isn't the question so much as good or evil.
SUPMALE:Now come on, they're having a big thanksgiving sale down at buy 'n' bag, and i got to get a turkey for next week.
LEADFEMALE:Get an organic one this year, because those regular ones, they're pumped up with chemicals and growth hormones.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but d.j. 's favorite part's the third leg.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:You might want to use the back door to avoid those abortion protestors.
LEADMALE:They won't hassle us; we'll just tell 'em we're with the pre-natal care.
OTHERFEMALE:It doesn't matter.
OTHERFEMALE:They won't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what right do they have to hassle anybody? Well, these things can get violent.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, let's go out the back.
SUPFEMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:I'm kickin' ass for two now.
SUPMALE:Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, life begins when we say so! Are you with us? Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I'm from the central office.
LEADMALE:Uh, my name is enid, and this is, uh, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, now, enid, no.
SUPMALE:You can tell them my real name.
LEADFEMALE:I'm roseanne.
SUPMALE:Well, i can see why you're so committed to this cause.
SUPMALE:You look like a fetus.
LEADFEMALE:I think i remember you.
LEADFEMALE:Weren't you at that action in wichita? Well, i wanted to be there, but i got stuck setting myself on fire up in omaha.
LEADMALE:So what did you find out about this place? Well, we did a total sweep, and the place is clean.
LEADMALE:Hey, you just stuck your kid in the eye with your "save the children" sign.
OTHERMALE:But we were told they were performing abortions here.
SUPMALE:Well, see, we've been getting a lot of bad information lately.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:I think we got a mole.
LEADMALE:I don't want to point any fingers, but, uh, roseanne, there, is new.
SUPMALE:So what'll we do? Oh, don't worry; i got everything under control.
LEADMALE:Uh, i'm giving you the address of a clinic that is very active today.
LEADMALE:All right, let's go, let's go.
LEADMALE:And afterwards, we got a big pro-capital punishment rally we can go to.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, enid.
LEADMALE:All right, everybody, follow me! Roseanne, you may not agree with them, but how can you send 'em on a wild goose chase? I didn't.
SUPFEMALE:I sent 'em to mom's.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Will you sew these up for me? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Can you give me the needle and thread? what am i, your slave? This is, like, the third pair of pants i've sewn up for you.
LEADMALE:What do you ever do for me? Well, i don't tell people you can sew, betty ross.
LEADFEMALE:Staircase pattern on 2.
LEADMALE:Hut-hut.
LEADFEMALE:They're trying to double-team conner on this one.
LEADFEMALE:He blows past the first guy, fakes towards the staircase.
SUPFEMALE:The crowd goes crazy! Study these moves, boys, for you shall be performing same tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? It's the annual thanksgiving day football game.
SUPMALE:We need a couple of fearless he-men to replace the guys whose wives won't let 'em play.
LEADFEMALE:Cool, we'll be there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, cool.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Mark, when i look at you, i see speed.
OTHERMALE:David, when i look at you, i know we won't leave any equipment on the field.
LEADFEMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't played football in a long time.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Me, neither.
SUPMALE:I just hope i don't get stuck being the guy with his hands on some other guy's butt.
LEADFEMALE:What position do you want to play? Well, i don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Like the guy who does the main scoring thing.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, like the lineback flanking guy, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:The what? Leave me alone.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know anything about football, do you? When i was in high school, i had better things to do than chase a stupid ball around.
SUPFEMALE:Like what? Like beating up artsy femme boys like you.
LEADMALE:At least i know how to play football.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i always had this theory about football players.
OTHERMALE:Touching each other on the butt, sticking their butts up in the air, and wearing really tight pants to show off their butts.
LEADFEMALE:What are you saying, mark? That they're really into butts.
SUPFEMALE:And i don't want anyone checking me out back there.
SUPMALE:Why not? Cut it out.
SUPMALE:All right, mark.
LEADMALE:I was gonna offer to help you out, but if you don't mind being embarrassed in front of your father-in-law, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Look, i'm sorry, man.
SUPMALE:Would you mind teaching me? Of course not.
SUPFEMALE:You're my brother.
SUPFEMALE:Now, both teams get several chances to score.
OTHERFEMALE:These are called downs.
SUPFEMALE:On first down-well, wait.
LEADMALE:How many are there? I can't believe you haven't picked up any of this in the last 20 years.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe you haven't picked up any sailors in the past 20 minutes.
LEADMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:To answer your question, there are seven downs.
LEADFEMALE:I thought there was always four or five.
LEADMALE:Oh, mark, no.
LEADMALE:Now, if you catch the ball on the fourth down, you cannot run with it.
OTHERMALE:You have to stop right where you are and throw the ball down on the ground.
LEADMALE:That's called a spike.
LEADMALE:Yeah, hey, spike.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen that.
OTHERMALE:That's when you do the dance thing, too, right? You got to do the dance.
LEADFEMALE:Once you spike the ball down in the middle of the field, believe me, everyone's gonna be looking at you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well? is it a boy? No, it's a girl, and her name is darlene, and she's not coming home for thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:More hummus and tabouli for me.
SUPMALE:Did you call the clinic? No.
SUPMALE:I was thinking maybe we're not supposed to know the sex.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should do what we did with d.j. : wait till he's 10 and then let him decide.
SUPMALE:No, i want to know.
OTHERMALE:I want to tell everybody at dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe your mom will get so excited, she'll choke.
SUPMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:Let's find out.
OTHERMALE:At least this way, it'll keep you from trying to peek at it while i'm asleep.
OTHERFEMALE:* over the river and through the woods * * from grandmother's house i come * look what just crawled out from under plymouth rock.
SUPFEMALE:Your nana mary just came in, and she's brought a special guest.
LEADFEMALE:It's her new husband.
LEADMALE:This may turn out to be the worst holiday ever.
SUPMALE:She got married? Yes! Your nana mary has finally found the man she wishes to spend the rest of her life with.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's a big step.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, at her age, that's at least a three-year commitment.
LEADMALE:Happy thanksgiving, everybody! Hey, anybody want to baste this old bird with any booze you got around handy? so, uh who's the looker? This is joe.
SUPFEMALE:That's all she'd tell me.
LEADMALE:Just joe.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, joe, what do you know? No, he doesn't hear very well, rosie, but that's the price you pay for defending your country against the kaiser.
LEADFEMALE:Souh does he do anything? Well, what he's gonna do right now is take a leak.
SUPFEMALE:It was a very long, long trip.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it's another norman rockwell thanksgiving at your house, roseanne! it's right down the hall! zoom! look at him go! Come sit down with me, nana mary.
LEADMALE:Or should i just call you mrs.
LEADMALE:Joe? hey, roseanne, isn't there a phone call you wanted to make before it gets too late? Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You know, the holidays are the busiest time for us phone sex gals.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, mary, you look great.
SUPMALE:Marriage must really agree with you, kiddo.
SUPMALE:Thank you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:My complexion cleared up as soon as joey and i started doing it.
LEADMALE:Oh, mother! Shut up, beverly.
LEADFEMALE:I was hoping that it would bring back his hearing.
LEADMALE:Instead, he went blind in one eye.
SUPMALE:That'll happen.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, ladies.
LEADMALE:So should i get it a pink or blue football helmet? Just a minute.
LEADMALE:She's checking.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:So what kind of kid have we got? does it have indoor or outdoor plumbing? Uh, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, i'm afraid i'm not allowed to give you that information.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why not? You just were gonna a minute ago.
OTHERMALE:Well, i know.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just i'm not allowed to give out any information in situations like this.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about "situations like this"? You'll have to speak to the doctor.
LEADFEMALE:No, you just tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Is something wrong? what's wrong with the baby? You'll really have to ask the doctor.
LEADMALE:Well, put him on the phone.
LEADMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:He left for the holiday, but i'll page him.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure he'll call you as soon as he can.
OTHERMALE:Tell him he'd better get back to me quick, and remind him that i'm the one that yelled into his stethoscope.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? I have to wait for the doctor to call.
SUPFEMALE:It's probably nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:That's why the nurse wouldn't say anything.
SUPMALE:The nurse probably doesn't even know what she's talking about.
SUPFEMALE:What if she does, dan? what then? Well then we'll do what we always said we were gonna do: we'll just try again.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, evidently, mother's new husband needs your help getting off the toilet.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know how christmas is going to top this.
LEADMALE:I love thanksgiving! the whole family pitching in on the meal and pretending mother hasn't made a horrible mistake with her life! Mom, come on.
LEADMALE:Joe's been a big help.
LEADFEMALE:He snapped three beans.
SUPMALE:Why why him, mother? why is this old man my daddy? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How'd the game go? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Why don't you ask spike? I'm really sorry, dan.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
LEADMALE:Nothing's going right this thanksgiving.
SUPFEMALE:It wasn't so bad you threw the ball down on the 30 yard line like that, but what did you do that dance for? It was fourth down, hotshot.
SUPMALE:Sorry you lost.
LEADMALE:No, it was great.
OTHERMALE:Hey, honey.
SUPMALE:Did you get a call? you didn't talk to anybody about this, did you? No.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:I don't want anybody making a big deal out of this.
OTHERFEMALE:Just try not to think about it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it would be silly to worry about that when the bears are having such a bad season.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i don't need a sweater, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I've brought my own special schnapps.
OTHERMALE:Want a bite? She can't, nana mary.
LEADMALE:She's pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:My goodness.
LEADMALE:It's not as if the fetus had to drive somewhere.
SUPFEMALE:I'll do that.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, so? did you call the clinic? Uhyeah, but i couldn't get through.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Well, you know, all those pregnant teenagers just hog the phone.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne! I heard what you did about those abortion protestors.
SUPMALE:I'm proud of you, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yes, roseanne.
SUPMALE:You're quite the revolutionary.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm surprised you're not down in some coffee shop hitting bongos.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of you, too, mom.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe abortion used to be illegal.
OTHERMALE:What if i was one of those girls that got pregnant in high school? You might have had to drop out and marry some loser.
LEADFEMALE:Can we please talk about something else? You know, i had two abortions when i was young.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, you what? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You heard her.
LEADFEMALE:I heard her.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody heard her, except joe.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, come on.
LEADMALE:This is huge! You had two abortions, nana mary? That must have been so hard.
SUPMALE:Well, it was pretty tough in those days.
SUPMALE:The laws were very strict.
OTHERMALE:I had to go to some terrible place way on the south side of chicago.
SUPFEMALE:That was the first time.
LEADMALE:So the second time, i went to mexico.
OTHERMALE:Or was that to get wool? I think it's an abomination.
LEADMALE:If you're willing to lie on your back and have sex, you should be willing to face the consequences.
LEADMALE:Who said i was on my back? Gee, i wonder who told the abortion stories at the very first thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:Now, what if i decided to have an abortion with you, roseanne? or with your sister? what would have happened then? would you like me to tell you, mom? Maybe you wouldn't have had to marry some guy you didn't love and you would've had a happy and fulfilling life.
SUPFEMALE:Wouldn't that be an abomination? Yes, it would, roseanne, because i know the difference between right and wrong.
LEADMALE:And abortion is wrong.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you for giving us all the truth, mother.
LEADMALE:I've always wondered what that red thong was doing in your apartment with the word "god" on it.
SUPFEMALE:That's right i went to mexico for the wool and to canada for the abortion.
LEADMALE:I used to love to travel.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, what is it? This nurse down at the clinic said there might be something wrong with the baby.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god, what? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, roseanne, i am so sorry.
OTHERMALE:When are you gonna find out? We're just sitting here waiting for the doctor to call.
OTHERFEMALE:He hasn't called you back yet at a time like this? how can the man be so insensitive? Well, i'm guessing he's never been pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:You and dan must be scared to death.
LEADMALE:Well, actually, dan isn't allowing himself to feel anything until we know for sure.
OTHERMALE:Well, it is lucky that you're so early in the pregnancy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's not that early, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:I heard the heart beat.
SUPMALE:You know, i always thought that i could have an abortion, but now, i just-i don't think i can.
SUPFEMALE:Part of me would always wonder what the kid was gonna turn out to be.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, roseanne i can't believe that nana mary went through this twice.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least we're better off than she was.
OTHERMALE:At least we have a choice.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, we're so lucky.
SUPFEMALE:We get to choose.
LEADMALE:I was gonna take a shower, but i guess i can go upstairs.
OTHERMALE:Um, dan, i think we should talk.
LEADMALE:I was thinking, and even if something turns out to be wrong, i'm just not sure what i want to do.
LEADMALE:Jackie, could you leave us alone for a minute? Look, i thought we decided that if there was, you know, a serious problem, that we would deal with it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we talked about this.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but everything's different now.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because i'm pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:So are you saying you wanna have this baby no matter what? No, i'm--i'm just saying that this is a much more complicated decision than i ever thought it would be.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i refuse to deal with this now.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, if this is real, you'll probably feel differently.
SUPMALE:Don't tell me how i'm gonna feel.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not telling you how you're gonna feel.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just saying when the time comes for you to make a decision, you're not gonna make it alone.
SUPMALE:Why, are you gonna make it for me? No, i'm gonna make it with you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, after all, this is half my kid.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but it's in my body.
SUPMALE:That's great, as long as it stays in your body.
LEADMALE:When it comes out, i've gotta take half the responsibility.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, telling the kids every couple of years that they cannot have a dog is not taking half the responsibility.
LEADFEMALE:So, that's all i am around here is a sperm donor? No.
SUPFEMALE:You're also sort of an ornament.
LEADFEMALE:This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:We're gonna wait for the call.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and what am i supposed to do in the meantime? count our blessings! --for the touchdown! yes! Did you see that? The guy just spiked the ball.
LEADFEMALE:What a jerk.
LEADMALE:But he scored a touchdown.
LEADMALE:Man, david really got you good.
SUPFEMALE:So when you gonna punch him? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:When are you gonna shut up? Mark, i drained all the oil like you said.
LEADFEMALE:I still can't get my car started.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what, after dinner, just keep cranking it until it starts, then floor it.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Isn't that bad for his engine? Yeah, it's gonna completely wreck it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody, dinner's ready! I forgot he was there.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, there you are, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Everything looks great this year.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, dan, you wanna serve? Oh.
LEADMALE:I'll take this out to joe.
LEADMALE:Oh, isn't he gonna join us for dinner? After all, it might be his last thanksgiving.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, he's quite all right just where he is.
LEADMALE:He's got his bell in case he starts to choke.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetie, don't eat too much! Leave room for your medications.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, baby? Perhaps he's choking and he can't find his bell.
SUPMALE:Shut up, bev.
LEADFEMALE:No, you shut up! everybody, shut up and eat the dinner! I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Hello? Uh, yeah, doctor.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERMALE:No.
SUPMALE:So now dinner's been interrupted.
SUPMALE:I mean, will nothing go right this year? Oh, stop bellyachin', beverly! All you do is complain.
LEADMALE:Try to think of one thing you can be grateful for this year.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, i am grateful for such a sensitive mother who always supports me and nurtures me and never treats me like dirt beneath her feet.
SUPMALE:There you go; you thought of it.
OTHERFEMALE:Now don't hog all the dark meat.
OTHERMALE:What'd he say? He said they don't know anything and that i have to have another amnio.
LEADFEMALE:So we gotta keep waiting? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I don't even wanna deal with this.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even wanna think about it.
OTHERFEMALE:He, uh-he knew the sex, but i didn't want him to tell me.
LEADMALE:There.
LEADMALE:What do you think? I think you did a great job.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? I think you're a chick trapped in a wuss' body.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, mark, i fixed your pants.
LEADMALE:How 'bout giving me a break with fixing my car? Well, i'll tell you what.
OTHERMALE:I'm going out to dinner with becky and when i get back, i'll think about it.
LEADMALE:You got a loose thread here, hold on.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i am pretty good at this.
SUPMALE:You're pathetic.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE: hi.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Fred's taking andy to the ballgame.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted you to see how cute he looked before they left.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you look real cute, fred.
LEADMALE:No! Look at andy's little outfit.
LEADMALE:Oh, he's so sweet.
LEADMALE:Sweet? you hear that, jackie? You're dressing our boy to look sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, did i say sweet? I meant dainty.
SUPFEMALE:You know, if we want him to grow up to be a man, we should dress him like a man.
LEADFEMALE:Why? I think the burping and drooling should cover that.
OTHERMALE:I'm the one who dresses him every morning.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna choose what he wears.
LEADMALE:I am this kid's father, and i should have as much say in it as his mother does.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fred, if you ever pass a kidney stone, we'll let you dress that up.
LEADMALE:Andy, we gotta go.
LEADMALE:I can feel these uterine walls closing in on us.
LEADFEMALE:So, tomorrow, get the results of the second amnio test.
LEADMALE:Thinking good thoughts? Yeah, i had one of them, once.
LEADMALE:You and dan doing okay? No, he's being a total jerk.
LEADMALE:Really? yeah, alls he thinks about is himself, you know? He's worried that a sick baby might be an inconvenience to him, so he's trying to hint around that i should have an abortion.
SUPMALE:Oh, i'm sure he knows it's your decision.
SUPMALE:I mean, he must respect your right to choose.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, as long as i choose to agree with him.
SUPMALE:Hey, we're out of shampoo.
LEADFEMALE:Well, since when did you become too good for tide? Forget i asked.
LEADMALE:When are you gonna go paint that crib? I want to get started on the nursery.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i thought we'd wait until, you know until what, dan? Just say what you mean.
LEADMALE:Fine, you want me to paint the crib? I'll paint the crib.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is your-hey, d.j. , what do you say? Mr.
SUPMALE:Brand new turtleneck! What are you guys yelling about? We're not yelling.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, we're just practicing for when we're old and we can't hear.
LEADMALE:D.j. , why don't you get out of here? I haven't had any breakfast.
SUPMALE:Okay, here.
LEADFEMALE:Take this.
OTHERFEMALE:Go.
OTHERFEMALE:He doesn't know? No, he's too young.
SUPFEMALE:And he's not gonna find out, right, roseanne? Well, i don't know, dan, i think we should tell him.
LEADMALE:And then we should go out and tell the whole neighborhood.
LEADMALE:How else are they all gonna vote on what i should do? I mean it, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Until we decide on this, i don't think we should worry the boy.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right, you know? He was pushing you.
LEADFEMALE:I thought dan was better then that.
LEADMALE:Why? He's a man.
OTHERMALE:You know, this is the only area in the world that they can't control, and it drives them crazy, 'cause it doesn't come with a remote.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, do you know that we're out of shampoo? Yeah, well, i'll wear a hat.
LEADFEMALE:** ** ** son? yeah? I don't think i properly explained camping to you.
LEADMALE:At least it's quiet in here.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? You and mom are always yelling.
SUPMALE:Well, son, that's just what we do.
LEADFEMALE:We're not readers.
SUPMALE:I know it's different this time.
OTHERFEMALE:So what are you fighting about? Well, i guess i should probably tell you.
SUPFEMALE:It's-it's about your christmas gift.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:See, i think you're old enough to handle that dirt bike you wanted, but your mom's thinking clothes.
SUPFEMALE:So that's all the fighting's been about? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's gonna be fine, i promise.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? dan? Dan, i would like to talk with you alone.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , get out of here.
SUPMALE:I don't have to do what you tell me.
LEADFEMALE:You're not my parent.
SUPFEMALE:One two three.
OTHERFEMALE:Four.
LEADFEMALE:Five.
SUPMALE:Six.
LEADFEMALE:Dan? Go.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:You are lucky i didn't make it all the way to seven, young man! I can't believe you're treating roseanne this way.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, it's none of your business.
LEADFEMALE:It is my business.
LEADFEMALE:She's my sister.
LEADFEMALE:And you are trying to push her to do something that she might not want to do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not pushing her.
LEADMALE:This is her decision.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, you don't really mean that.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, i do.
LEADMALE:I don't agree with it, but i accept it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not trying to tell her what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, not straight out, you're not.
OTHERFEMALE:You just hint and imply and, uh-you know, hint.
SUPMALE:No, i don't.
LEADMALE:Really? Shouldn't we wait to paint the crib, roseanne, untilyou know.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just tie her to the examining table and tell the doctor what you want done? Stop it.
LEADMALE:Who do you think you are? I said that because i thought if we got the news tomorrow and it was bad, and roseanne--not me!-but roseanne decided to have an abortion, it might be hard for her to come home to a freshly-painted baby bed.
LEADMALE:I'm not trying to influence her.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to help her through this.
LEADFEMALE:Every time i open my mouth, she shuts me out.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're not-you're not gonna tell me that roseanne is the only person you're thinking of, here, because you know what you want her to do.
SUPMALE:Yeah, if it was up to me, and there was something really wrong with the baby, i'd want her to have an abortion.
SUPMALE:Have you thought about how hard that might be for roseanne? do you realize how selfish that is? is that what you think? why don't you just leave me alone, jackie? I'm not trying to be selfish.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what if they baby's born wrong? what if it's born without a brain, or something? what would that do to the family, huh? what would that do to roseanne? Oh, dan.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid its gonna wreck our marriage.
LEADMALE:I mean, look how well we've handled this stress.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, i had no idea.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Just i'd like to be alone right now.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Jackie, that's the opposite of alone.
LEADMALE:I don't like that, either.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I'll get this back to you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan! hey, fred! Been drinking? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Okay, then we're playing for money.
LEADFEMALE:So how you doing? I called you because i figured you probably had your fill of fighting with roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're late, fred.
OTHERMALE:You should have called in 1975.
LEADFEMALE:I heard she pretty much shut you out.
SUPFEMALE:Nah, she still talks to me.
LEADMALE:Every now and again, she'll point at me and go, "you.
LEADMALE:" i'm really sorry, man.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, i know it's none of my business, but would you mind if i said something to you about all this? Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:As long as you keep it short and you don't try to hug me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well now there's no point.
OTHERMALE:Look, i just don't think you'd be a terrible person if you demanded some control over what roseanne's gonna do.
LEADMALE:"roseanne" and "demand.
OTHERFEMALE:" two words that go together like "waffle iron" and "forehead.
SUPMALE:" look, having a kid it's half yours.
OTHERMALE:This is a 50/50 proposition.
LEADMALE:Yeah, when it finally comes out.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta admit, fred, this is different.
SUPFEMALE:Is it? I mean, roseanne and i always make the big decisions about the kids together.
SUPMALE:Sometimes she gets her way, sometimes i get my way.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
SUPMALE:No, i mean it.
OTHERFEMALE:It's like the time i kicked david out of the house.
LEADMALE:She didn't like it, but i got my way.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but then you let david move right back in again, didn't you? Then she got her way.
LEADMALE:You see? 50/50.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan, i'm not saying it's your fault.
LEADMALE:You know, jackie's the same way.
SUPMALE:They have the kids, so they figure that they own them.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe that's the way it is at your house, fred, but me and roseanne are okay.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, dan, you're forgetting something.
OTHERMALE:I've been to your house.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen the dents in the ceiling from every time she says jump.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, pal, at least i don't let my wife dress my son up like a girl.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not saying jackie doesn't try to push me around.
SUPFEMALE:But at least i still put up a fight.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't tell me i don't fight.
OTHERMALE:I fight plenty, and i'm not shadowboxing like you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm hitting the heavy bag.
SUPFEMALE:And you're way behind on points.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i don't need this.
LEADMALE:Lucky i don't get roseanne over here to kick your butt.
LEADMALE:Mom, i'm hungry.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, i did kind of cheat you on breakfast, so, how 'bout i'll make you a great snack? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Got your message.
LEADFEMALE:What's up? D.j. , get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Where's my snack? Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Go! Are you all right? Yeah, i'm fine.
LEADMALE:I was just wondering if you could get leon to take your shift tomorrow morning.
OTHERMALE:Probably, why? 'cause i want you to go to the doctors with me and dan.
LEADFEMALE:No, i-i really think it's something that you two ought to do alone, together.
SUPMALE:Come on, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I might have a really hard decision to make tomorrow, and i want some support from somebody that gets it.
LEADMALE:Dan'll support you.
OTHERMALE:That's what he's there for.
SUPFEMALE:No, he's there to push his opinion on me, and i do not need to get bad news and look over at that face and know what it's thinking.
LEADFEMALE:He's not gonna push his ideas on you.
LEADFEMALE:Have you really sat down and talked to dan about this? why would i do that? what are you, a man, now? did you grow a kickstand? Italked to dan.
LEADMALE:You talked to dan about this? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, and i thought that he made some very good points.
LEADMALE:He's worried about what a sick baby might do to you.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, he's thinking about the whole family.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so you're on his side, now.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's still your decision.
LEADFEMALE:He just want to be heard.
LEADMALE:I heard him! he loves you, roseanne! So you think i should do what he says, right? No one is trying to control you.
OTHERMALE:Yes, they are, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:You just don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:This is not dan's decision and it is not yours.
SUPMALE:I have to make it, and i have to live with it.
SUPMALE:You're not listening to me.
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne! No, i'm serious.
LEADMALE:Get the hell out of here and leave me alone.
LEADMALE:You okay? No, i lost my tiara.
LEADFEMALE:What were you and aunt jackie fighting about? Which one of us is the prettiest.
LEADMALE:Whose side are you on? everything's fine, d.j. are you sick? What are you asking me that for? 'cause everybody's fighting and whispering.
SUPFEMALE:Like they were at ralph's house last year, when his mom was sick.
SUPMALE:No, i'm not sick.
SUPFEMALE:Then what's going on here? I mean, you can't still be arguing about my christmas present like dad said.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't agree with your father, d.j. i don't think it's right to buy everyone a present except you.
OTHERMALE:Well, when ralph's mom needed an operation, they lied to him, too.
LEADMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:Okay, i'm gonna tell you the truth because you're not a little kid anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm okay, but, um there's a chance that something's wrong with the baby.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, so, i have to, uh-make a decision whether to have it or not.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you might have an abortion? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:It's just a very, very complicated decision, d.j. why? Because i have wanted to have a baby for a long time.
SUPMALE:Well, if you decide not to have a baby, when you come back from the hospital, we can take care of you.
LEADMALE:Hey, i know you're gonna be a man someday, but, see, you cannot do this.
LEADMALE:Do what? No man has any right to tell any woman what she should do in a situation like this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just saying that, if you do have the baby and it's sick, we can take care of the baby, too.
LEADFEMALE:So you mean, you're saying, like, uh what, that you would support any decision i make? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well thanks.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, d.j. it really makes me feel better that you can handle the truth.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:So am i getting a dirt bike for chris-no.
SUPMALE:Where the hell's that doctor? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, i hope he's driving a truck for the city some day, and he has a break down.
LEADFEMALE:Then we'll see who's waiting for who.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look at this.
LEADFEMALE:He's got three kids.
SUPFEMALE:Man, if that's what he thinks kids look like, how's he gonna know if something's wrong with ours? Listen, honey, no matter what this doctor says i'm gonna want to talk about this.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, that's okay.
SUPFEMALE:We still have four bottles of beer on the wall.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, take one down and pass it a-yeah, okay.
LEADMALE:The results of a second amnio indicate that, apparently, this first test was contaminated.
LEADMALE:The second sample shows that everything is developing normally.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:You mean the kid's okay? That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Hallelujah.
LEADMALE:I'm sure you two would like to have some time alone.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:Take all the time you want.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, oh, by the way: it's a girl.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god, it's a little girl.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy, another daughter.
LEADFEMALE:She'll be able to wear hand me downs from jackie's boy.
OTHERMALE:Hey, i'm really sorry, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, i was, like, pushing you away all week.
LEADFEMALE:And i wasn't a very good wife.
SUPMALE:No, man, i know.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADMALE:You've been through a lot.
LEADFEMALE:At least we're partners again, right? God, i just couldn't stand not knowing.
LEADFEMALE:I was so scared.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i haven't been that great, either.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, dan.
LEADMALE:This is my apology, okay? Let me be the ass.
LEADFEMALE:You always get to be the ass.
SUPMALE:Okay, as of tonight, you are the biggest ass in the world.
LEADMALE:Could this day possibly get any better? We are gonna celebrate so huge, tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Anything you want for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Let's finish off d.j. 's halloween candy.
OTHERMALE:Well, i already had that celebration without ya.
SUPMALE:All right, then we'll just have a romantic dinner and finish off with an r-rated movie.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? I've got a better idea.
SUPFEMALE:We skip dinner and we'll make our own r-rated movie.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but i only appear naked if it's tasteful and organic to the plot.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, something's different.
SUPFEMALE:What? Not only did god help our baby, but he cleaned our kitchen.
LEADMALE:What are you doing with all this? They were all over upstairs.
SUPMALE:I mean under my bed, in becky's room.
LEADMALE:There's even a piece of birthday cake in the bathroom! I was saving that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, d.j. , your mother and i are very proud of you for covering up whatever you've done in such a clever way.
LEADMALE:I just thought i'd help out.
SUPMALE:I mean, i felt really bad about the baby.
LEADFEMALE:That's so sweet, d.j. but you know what? There's nothing to worry about, 'cause we just saw the doctor, and he said the baby's fine.
LEADMALE:It is? Yeah, but i think it'd be a lot better if you went and cleaned up the backyard.
SUPMALE:D.j. , you don't have to do any more.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Why did you tell d.j. the baby might be sick? what? I thought we talked and we agreed that we weren't gonna say anything to the kids.
OTHERMALE:Well, we didn't.
OTHERMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you should'a asked me.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because we agreed.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i changed our mind.
SUPFEMALE:Really 50/50, roseanne.
LEADMALE:What's your problem? Aw, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:I don't have a problem.
SUPMALE:Well, great.
LEADFEMALE:So well, what do you want to do to celebrate? Well, you wanted me to paint that baby bed.
LEADFEMALE:I might as well get on it.
LEADMALE:Say, dear, isn't roseanne and dan's little girl i know.
SUPMALE:I sent her a birthday gift, and i also got a little something for her two kids.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that reminds me.
SUPMALE:D.j. called today.
SUPMALE:He finally got that big promotion.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's great.
OTHERMALE:He has wanted to get on that trapeze for years.
LEADMALE:Ooh, where's our little andy? That kid is gonna miss his football game.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't worry, dear.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think they're gonna start without him.
LEADFEMALE:After all, he is the captain of the squad.
OTHERMALE:Do you remember how you used to complain about the way i dressed him? hey, andy! hurry up there, buddy boy! Will you guys stop yelling? I'm ready.
OTHERMALE:Now, son, before you go out there on that field today, your mom and i, we just want to tell you one thing.
OTHERFEMALE:We are so proud of you.
LEADMALE:You've turned into one fine strapping young man.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Where are my pom-poms? Right where you left them.
LEADMALE:Up by your purse.
OTHERMALE:Yep, that boy's gonna break a few hearts one day.
LEADMALE:Why do i drink so much?
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Ah, santa's workshop.
SUPMALE:Can i go in on something with you this year for mom? God, that's who i forgot.
SUPFEMALE:You owe me 29 cents.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, david.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dinah.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:We're just bringing my stuff up to d.j. 's room so darlene can have the basement when she gets home.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dinah.
OTHERMALE:Looks like someone's in the kitchen with ya.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, yeah, you are.
SUPMALE:* strumming on the old banjo * why couldn't dinah have married mark? Then i wouldn't have to know either one of them.
OTHERMALE:You're the one that pushed david to start dating again in the first place.
LEADMALE:You can't go slamming his first attempt.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna slam her.
LEADMALE:I'm just gonna let darlene sniff around at her for a while, and then i'll let go of the leash.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey! Don't you have something to tell me? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:I love you, mom.
LEADMALE:No, not that.
LEADMALE:Your teacher, mrs.
SUPMALE:Holmes, called, and she wants to see me and your dad at school.
SUPFEMALE:I really love you, mom.
SUPMALE:Bye! Why didn't you just tell me she was gonna call? I coulda done that no hablas englais bit.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you guys.
OTHERMALE:Now i'm in the kitchen with you.
LEADMALE:I tried to explain it to her.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You're doing great.
LEADMALE:Hey, i'm home! Oh, darlene, i can't wait 'til you see what i got you for christmas.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, it's kind of a present for both of us.
OTHERMALE:I love what you've done with the place.
LEADFEMALE:It's a real pit.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, darlene, no need to insult the house.
LEADMALE:We have a guest.
SUPMALE:Hey, david.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, darlene.
LEADMALE:How's jimmy? Good.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:This is dinah.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene, dinah here's a cheerleader.
OTHERMALE:What do you think of that, huh? Cool.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we have to-we have to finish bringing my stuff up to d.j. 's room.
LEADMALE:Now.
LEADMALE:Well, darlene, it was nice meeting you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:You were so sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Who taught you to behave that way to company? well, what, would you rather i was mean to her? Well, yeah, somebody has to be.
LEADMALE:And i'm the mom, so it can't be me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm glad david's with her.
LEADMALE:I mean, it makes me not have to feel guilty.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not gonna be mean to her just for your sake.
SUPMALE:Well, you are one selfish little girl, darlene.
LEADMALE:** hi.
SUPFEMALE:We're roseanne and dan conner.
SUPMALE:Thank you both for coming.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry to have to pull you away from work.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, nothing's more important to me than my son's education.
OTHERMALE:So is d.j. acting up, mrs teacher? Oh, d.j. 's behavior is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:But i'm afraid he's not progressing as well as we'd hoped with his homework assignments.
LEADMALE:Oh, well dan and i would like to help him out more, but there's just so many great things on tv these days.
OTHERFEMALE:Every day, i choose one of the students to put his homework answers on the board, and whenever i pick d.j. , he says he didn't understand the assignment.
SUPFEMALE:I think we should consider the possibility that your son is, shall we say, special.
LEADMALE:Uh, do you mean special as in "the sporting goods store is having a special on dumbbells?" that's not what i said, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying that your son might need a little more attention.
LEADMALE:Perhaps after the holidays, we could try putting him in our "explorer" class.
LEADFEMALE:Explorer, huh? what are they exploring? coming in out of the rain? D.j. can't be dumb.
LEADMALE:He's the only one in the family that can keep score in bowling.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen this sort of thing before.
LEADMALE:If we don't do something soon, it could create serious self-esteem problems for him.
SUPFEMALE:Gee.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds serious, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Well, forget about it.
LEADFEMALE:He's just being lazy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:From now on, he'll be hitting the books or the books'll be hitting him.
SUPMALE:Wrong, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not gonna punish him.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna support him.
LEADFEMALE:And for a lot longer than we thought.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, just so i know, and i gonna have any say in how we handle our kid? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:We'll split up the tasks like we always do.
LEADMALE:I'll handle it, and you'll make sure there's fresh batteries in the remote control.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps you'd like to discuss this-oh, there's nothing to discuss, here.
OTHERFEMALE:We always do things her way.
LEADMALE:I knew there was no reason for me to be here.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry about this, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:That's what you get when you marry an explorer.
LEADFEMALE:No, she was serious.
SUPMALE:The teacher's totally convinced that d.j. is stupid.
LEADFEMALE:I guess she's never seen his mashed potato castles.
OTHERMALE:That's weird.
LEADMALE:How are you guys gonna handle it? Excuse me, i can see i'm just in the way, here.
SUPMALE:I'll just leave.
LEADMALE:Well, make sure you send a check every month.
LEADMALE:You oughta go easy on him, roseanne, 'cause he was talking to fred down at work, and i think he's really pretty upset.
LEADMALE:About what? Evidently, the whole thing that you guys went through with the pregnancy and the way you boxed him out of that decision made him feel like he doesn't have an equal say with the kids.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's stupid.
LEADMALE:They're not even the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when the kid's in my body, i make all the decisions, but you know me.
LEADMALE:As soon as i drop it out on the table, they're up for grabs.
SUPMALE:That's not true.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not throw him a bone and let him handle this one? Dan needs to know that you have faith in him.
LEADMALE:Oh, all right, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:He can handle it.
SUPMALE:He is a wonderful father.
LEADMALE:How'd that sound? Dan! Hey, dan.
LEADMALE:I was thinking, uh-well, i think you should handle this d.j. and school thing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Well, that's not what you said this afternoon.
SUPMALE:Well, a lot of stuff has changed since this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:You know, like, i realize he's not my little boy anymore.
LEADFEMALE:He's getting to be a man.
LEADMALE:Except for that plastic sheet on his bed.
OTHERMALE:Okay, i'll talk to him.
LEADMALE:Well, that's great, 'cause i know you'll do a great job.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You mean it? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Hey, i've got an idea.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you bounce off me what you're gonna say to d.j. ? you know i'm sure it will be fine, and everything, but maybe this way, i could learn something, okay? Okay, i'll be d.j. okay.
LEADMALE:Well, deej, uh, being a student is really important because someday soon, you're gonna be out in the real world, and you're gonna wanna be smart enough to know when you're getting hosed by your wife.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, dan-don't interrupt me, son.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
SUPMALE:And i think you're a little young to be calling your father dan.
SUPMALE:Aw, shove it.
SUPMALE:Ah ha! I can still take you over my knee, young man.
SUPMALE:He'll do fine, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i guess he can't do d.j. any harm.
SUPFEMALE:And if he does, well, there's plenty more where he came from.
SUPMALE:Man, these christmas lights are pretty tangled.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, why don't you just buy a new string this year? Well, that'd be a fairly large investment, fred.
LEADFEMALE:Geez, dan, why didn't you just take a little time last year and put those things away carefully when you took them down? Yeah, like that's how i want to spend my easter sunday.
OTHERMALE:Guys, let me ask you something.
LEADMALE:Did you ever have any trouble in school? Yeah, you know.
SUPMALE:Every once in a while.
LEADFEMALE:How come? Well, d.j. 's slacking off, and his teacher thinks he's stupid.
LEADFEMALE:And i made this big stink to roseanne about how i could handle it.
SUPMALE:Yeah? so? Now it's like this big test, and if i blow it, she'll never let me hear the end of it.
OTHERMALE:Look, i talk to the kid, and i know what his problem is.
LEADFEMALE:Well you know what his problem is.
LEADFEMALE:I need to know what his problem is.
LEADMALE:Impasse.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Well, d.j. told me that his teacher makes them write their stuff on the board.
SUPFEMALE:And he can't stand up because he's, uh well, he's embarrassed.
SUPMALE:You're losing me here, mark.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, he can't stand up because, you know, people will see.
LEADFEMALE:And you know, he's 13 now, and sometimes things, you know sometimes things happen.
LEADFEMALE:So you're trying to say that d.j. 's at that age where he wants to go up to the blackboard, but little d.j. won't let him.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you mean he's at that age where, on a sunny day, he could be laying on his back and tell time without a watch.
LEADMALE:No, man, it's nothing to do with telling the time.
LEADFEMALE:The kid's getting erections.
SUPMALE:So i told him just to sit there and pretend he didn't know anything, and that way he wouldn't get called up to the board.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! What a relief.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, i can handle this.
LEADMALE:Here, i was worried about d.j. being stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Turns out it's just you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what was i supposed to say to the kid, dan? Well, it's not that difficult a problem, mark.
LEADMALE:We've all been there.
LEADFEMALE:We've all figured out how to deal with this when we were his age.
SUPMALE:I always found that nobody was any the wiser if i just kept my shirt untucked.
SUPMALE:Oh, an untucker, were you? I occasionally employed that device, myself.
LEADFEMALE:Usually, however i took the more scholarly approach.
LEADMALE:Put a book in front of it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, a book was good.
LEADFEMALE:If you didn't have a book, you just had to stick your hands in your pockets.
LEADMALE:That's usually how mine started.
LEADMALE:You know, back at that age, it didn't even have much to do with girls.
LEADFEMALE:Damn thing'd pop up and say, "howdy-do" for any reason.
LEADMALE:You know what usually set me off was the vibrations on the school bus.
LEADMALE:All through junior high, i dreamed of being a bus driver.
SUPFEMALE:You sure d.j. 's gonna be okay with you talking about all this? Oh, i'm sure he will.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, it was kind of fun for us, wasn't it? that's the nice thing about those coveralls at work, you know? Hey, david.
LEADFEMALE:I like that dinah girl.
LEADFEMALE:She was nice.
LEADFEMALE:I broke up with her.
SUPFEMALE:Why? I really don't want to talk about it.
LEADMALE:Well, what was wrong with her? is there some guy already living in her parent's basement? She wasn't right for me.
LEADMALE:And i'm not interested in dating just anybody.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, david.
OTHERFEMALE:You get bucked off one cheerleader, you gotta just climb right back up on another.
LEADFEMALE:I think i've been spoiled.
LEADMALE:I mean, i know there are other women out there that i could really connect with, so i think i should just hold out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, every relationship's not gonna be like you and me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you have to get over me.
SUPMALE:What makes you so sure that i'm talking about you? fine, then, who are you talking about? Nobody.
LEADFEMALE:Just leave me alone.
LEADFEMALE:No, i mean, come on.
LEADFEMALE:If there's another girl, great.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna ask her out? No.
LEADMALE:Well, why not? Because she belongs to somebody else, and i can't have her.
LEADFEMALE:You have to stop torturing yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you got to get over me for the sake of both of us.
SUPMALE:Hey, what are you guys doing? Just a few seconds ago, we blew this whistle that only dumb blondes can hear.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Hey, we still on for coffee later? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Is 8:00 okay? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and i read that book you gave me.
LEADFEMALE:I can't wait to talk to you about it.
LEADMALE:What book? horton hears a who? This is between me and david.
LEADMALE:You and becky? Oh man, i don't believe this.
OTHERMALE:I don't care what you believe.
LEADMALE:Oh, but you should.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, your little plan has worked.
LEADMALE:It's like, now i feel like i have to keep up with her.
LEADMALE:In fact, i'm gonna get the meat suck out of my head and injected into my breasts.
LEADMALE:You know, you don't even know your sister.
LEADMALE:She's a much cooler person than you realize.
OTHERMALE:Oh, david, cut the act.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not buying it.
LEADMALE:This is not an act.
LEADFEMALE:I like spending time with becky.
OTHERMALE:And if you ever gave her a chance, you'd learn she has some very interesting things to say.
SUPMALE:Boy, does she ever.
LEADFEMALE:Just yesterday, she said to me, "life is like a box of chocolates.
LEADMALE:" i can't get the stain off this plate.
LEADMALE:Let me see it.
SUPMALE:Well, this is a christmas plate.
LEADFEMALE:You scrubbed off the last wise man.
SUPFEMALE:* walking through the house, looking for a beer * * open up the ice box door * * oh, my! There's one right here * what are you so happy about? happy? me? Never.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so? did you talk to d.j. ? i mean, i know you did, but did ya? Yes.
LEADMALE:Suffice it to say, your son is not stupid, and the problem has been solved.
SUPFEMALE:By me.
LEADFEMALE:That's all that i am at liberty to divulge.
LEADMALE:You better tell me, dan.
LEADMALE:Don't make me get out the dental tools.
OTHERFEMALE:It seems as though d.j. was getting in class, at least well, probably other times as well, i'm sure, but definitely in class, d.j. was getting-what, picked on? pushed? stabbed? D.j. was getting erections.
LEADMALE:God, why couldn't he just be stupid? Now, it's no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:He's 13.
LEADFEMALE:It'll go away by the time he's in his 30s.
LEADMALE:Trust me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he better not be having that problem around here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course not.
LEADMALE:Not with his mom around.
LEADMALE:You're the antidote.
LEADMALE:You think boys were having that problem when we were in school? Uh, no, jackie, this must be a new problem.
OTHERFEMALE:God, this is serious, dan.
LEADMALE:He must be feeling really scared and confused.
LEADMALE:What'd you say to him? Never fear.
LEADFEMALE:I just gave him one of the great secrets that's been passed down from father to son since the invention of the printed word.
LEADFEMALE:Told him to put a book in front of it.
LEADMALE:Well, that is great.
OTHERMALE:Idn't that great, roseanne? Oh, absolutely.
OTHERFEMALE:It's about time he got some use out of them schoolbooks.
LEADMALE:I take it you approve? Oh, yeah, i think you did great.
LEADMALE:You're a great father, dan.
SUPMALE:You are the mother of all fathers.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, thank you, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Now if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna go read the paper, check dear abby for errors.
SUPFEMALE:Way to go, big fella.
SUPMALE:Now, roseanne, he tried.
LEADMALE:He did the best that he could.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, his best was very, very bad.
LEADMALE:You know, i'm sure this is a big emotional thing for d.j. what do you say to a kid that has that problem? Well you look him in the eye, and nowhere else, and, uh you tell them that puberty's just a really rough time in their life.
LEADMALE:And their body's going through a lot of changes, and they're not a freak.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, tell that to dan.
LEADMALE:Let him talk to d.j. again.
LEADMALE:No, i'm not gonna risk that.
LEADMALE:What if he screws up even worse? D.j. will wind up climbing a tower with a big book in front of his rifle.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there you are.
LEADFEMALE:Haven't seen you all day.
LEADMALE:What'cha doing? Well, i'm watching this christmas movie with jimmy stewart.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, yeah.
OTHERMALE:They would be better off without him.
LEADMALE:Well, so you're sure growing up.
LEADFEMALE:And that's great, because that is what kids do.
SUPFEMALE:They grow up.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing to be ashamed of.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:You know, uh when i was 13, something really embarrassing happened to me.
OTHERMALE:You know, i never thought i would get over it.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well you know, the junior high had a dance, and, uh your grandma had bought me this real pretty white dress and in the middle of the dance, i looked down at the dress, and there was a, uh-very noticeable stain.
SUPFEMALE:What was it? Well, d.j. , it seems that i was going through what all the girls were going through at a certain age.
LEADFEMALE:I was having my first period.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god! i don't want to hear it! i don't want to hear it! whoa, what's going on? Mom told me a story i don't want to hear anymore! Well, that's no reason for you to go running out of the room screaming like a maniac.
LEADMALE:It was about her having her period! As you were.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? I was just trying to let him know he's not the only that had an embarrassing moment.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, not the white dress story.
SUPMALE:I was trying to help him with his problem.
LEADFEMALE:I helped him.
LEADMALE:Look, he's doing his homework.
SUPMALE:You made him feel ashamed.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want him to be emotionally scarred.
LEADMALE:Well, you're right, it was just i couldn't think of anything that would send him screaming from the room like you did.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought that you might have screwed things up.
LEADMALE:You never did have any faith in me.
SUPMALE:You lied to me.
SUPMALE:All right, i lied to you.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you want me to do, say i'm sorry? Okay, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted you to handle the d.j. thing so you would get over feeling left out as a parent.
OTHERFEMALE:I--i did a horrible thing.
SUPMALE:I lied and i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh, to hell with that.
SUPMALE:I want to hear you say that your way was wrong and my way was right.
LEADMALE:Girl story, bad.
LEADFEMALE:Book, good.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, whatever.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no, no, noooooo.
LEADFEMALE:Say it.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:You did way better than i thought your would have.
LEADMALE:Better than you.
LEADFEMALE:Better than most.
LEADFEMALE:Better than you.
LEADMALE:Okay, you did better than me.
SUPFEMALE:Are you happy, now? Why, if were any happier, i'd need a book.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, neil, give us a break.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a normal, everyday biological function, we have to call it something.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:None of these expressions are acceptable on network television.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, what about "pitching a trouser tent?" no.
LEADFEMALE:"booting up the hard drive?" no.
SUPFEMALE:"charming the anaconda?" what the anaconda? Charming.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, "raising the drawbridge?" no.
LEADMALE:"popping a wheelie?" no! "standing up for democracy?" no! "waving to your chin?" no.
SUPFEMALE:There's absolutely, positively no way any of these are gonna get on the air.
LEADMALE:Too late.
SUPFEMALE:Is that on? Aw,
LEADFEMALE:Hey, honey.
LEADFEMALE:What's goin' on? Well, me and my unborn daughter was just goin' in here to have a little puke party.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doin' in here? doin'? Oh, i thought i heard something.
LEADMALE:Uh, probably a squirrel or a bird but he ran a away.
LEADFEMALE:Or flew, depending on what it was.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you don't wanna know.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, dan.
SUPFEMALE:The only thing i don't wanna know is what is in that green bag in the freezer.
LEADFEMALE:Well, today, after i dropped off darlene at the library, i ran into ed jorgensen and you know he sells firewood in the winter now? Anyhow i didn't see anything yet, but he told me that our new neighbors, they kinda like to run around naked.
LEADFEMALE:And i just wanted to see if it was true, you know, so i could warn ya.
LEADFEMALE:Good, god, what's the matter with you, thinkin' i don't wanna see the neighbors naked! I thought you'd think i was perverted.
LEADFEMALE:No, you watchin' alone is perverted, but us watchin' together, now that's a date.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, this guy i saw the other day carried boxes in over there, he's the kind of guy you normally have to pay to see naked.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god, i-i guess that might have been their grandson.
LEADMALE:Or their great-greatgreat-grandson.
SUPMALE:Oh, me.
SUPMALE:I hope mine don't look like that when i get that old.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i hope not too, dan, because that's the wife.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god, i cannot sit here and look at this anymore.
OTHERMALE:Me neither.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? There's a commercial on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gettin' a beer.
LEADFEMALE:Newsflash, dan.
OTHERMALE:We don't have a tv in our bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:No, but the neighbors got one in theirs.
LEADMALE:By the time they left the room, i realized i hadn't had anything to drink in six hours.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you're still sittin' there watching the illinois raisins.
SUPFEMALE:It's not my fault.
LEADMALE:They're retired.
LEADFEMALE:They never go out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it's really sad how they have no life.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't stop lookin'.
LEADMALE:It's like a train wreck.
LEADMALE:A train wreck full of naked people.
LEADMALE:Stupid keys.
LEADFEMALE:Open up, you stupid door! come on! Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey.
SUPMALE:What's the matter, mark? did the guys at the garage convince you that it was new year's eve again? I'm not drunk, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Hey, you know, that's the first time i've ever called you that? Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Rosie.
LEADMALE:Roady-row-row-row.
LEADFEMALE:You better get in here.
OTHERMALE:You're in no condition to be out there.
SUPMALE:You better get in here and start cleanin' dan's guns.
SUPFEMALE:You know, maybe i could use some coffee.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, if you really wanna sober up, you should see what drinkin' did to our new neighbors.
LEADMALE:So, you wanna tell me why you're drunk? I don't have to tell you anything 'cause you're not my friend.
LEADMALE:All my real friends are down at the bar, like that fat guy, and, um the guy with the hat.
LEADFEMALE:So, is, uh, becky worried about me or um, no, she's still out with david.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene go with 'em? No, they went alone.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:It's like the eighth night this week.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, mark.
LEADMALE:I don't care what those two do.
OTHERMALE:I don't give a damn about them.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you better start caring, 'cause if we start tradin' spouses around here, you just might end up with me.
LEADMALE:Would you like that? No! I can't do anything about it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you can.
LEADMALE:Just tell her that you don't like it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid if i yell at her, she's just gonna hate me.
LEADMALE:She's not gonna hate you, mark.
OTHERMALE:She loves you in a way that makes our entire family think less of her.
SUPFEMALE:Look, i'll handle this my own way.
OTHERMALE:But thanks for tryin' to help me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know somethin'? You're all right.
SUPMALE:Well, gee, thanks, mark.
SUPMALE:You know, i didn't get much approval from my parents, but hearin' it from my drunk son-in-law is just as good.
LEADMALE:Look, i know i'm a big pain in the butt, but i'll tell you what.
OTHERMALE:I'll give you a free one.
LEADMALE:Go ahead, hit me.
SUPFEMALE:Hard as you can.
LEADMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:You can't do it, can you? Yeah, i can.
LEADMALE:I'm just goin' to get a bat.
LEADMALE:Hey, come on! big 'ol greasy bucket of chicken! last one in lives to a ripe old age! Get that stuff away from me.
LEADFEMALE:Just thinking about those people next door has given the term "chicken skin" a whole new meaning.
LEADMALE:What are they doin' now? Playing air hockey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:As if hockey wasn't an ugly enough sport.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hey, guys, brought the beer.
SUPFEMALE:Well, before we eat, i'm gonna run to the bathroom.
LEADMALE:I gotta wash my hands and burn out my corneas with drano.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with him? Oh, he's just really, really into, uh, watching our new neighbors.
LEADFEMALE:They have a new buick.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah, and they walk around naked all the time.
SUPMALE:I can't believe that dan would do that.
LEADFEMALE:What? It's no big deal.
SUPFEMALE:You approve? you're not lookin' too, are you? Well, yeah, but not as much as dan.
LEADMALE:I'm not sick.
OTHERFEMALE:Do your new neighbors know that you're watching 'em.
LEADFEMALE:No, we stand completely still because if they see us, you know, they might change their behavior.
LEADFEMALE:We got that from wild kingdom.
LEADMALE:Good god, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You want a cheap thrill, go rent a porno movie.
SUPMALE:At least those people want to be watched.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but they ain't, like, 112 years old.
LEADFEMALE:That's no excuse.
LEADFEMALE:If anything, it makes it more wrong, more sad, and more sick.
LEADFEMALE:They're really old? Oh, yeah! I'm sure they'll never forget where they were the day lincoln was shot.
LEADMALE:They're completely naked? all the time? Sometimes he wears a hat.
LEADMALE:I gotta look.
LEADMALE:Jackie! Don't do it, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:The coronellis can be quite a monkey on your back.
LEADMALE:Outta my way, dan.
LEADMALE:They gotta be stopped.
SUPFEMALE:It's not the neighbors' problem, dan.
LEADMALE:They got a right to do whatever they wanna do in their own house.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, dan.
LEADMALE:Our forefathers died so the coronellis could play naked air hockey.
SUPFEMALE:But you don't have a right to watch them.
LEADMALE:Watching's wrong.
SUPMALE:Wrong, fred? Wrong is when bad things happen to good people.
LEADFEMALE:And you wanna know why bad things happen to good people? Because god is too busy watching the coronellis.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, if you say there's nothing wrong with it, then let's just forget it.
LEADMALE:Hey, mom, i know what i want for my birthday.
OTHERMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:Keep it a secret so i'll be surprised.
SUPMALE:I want an air hockey game.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is bad.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, this could wreck d.j. 's whole sex life.
LEADMALE:I mean, at the very least, he'll hate old people.
LEADFEMALE:And at the very worst he'll really, really like 'em.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want? You never come down here.
LEADMALE:Well, this time i wanted to.
LEADFEMALE:No, mark, that wasn't an observation, that was an order.
LEADFEMALE:You, never come down here.
OTHERMALE:I just wanted to ask you about something.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh how are you and david getting along these days? Great.
LEADFEMALE:We find that nothing enhances romance like breaking up and sleeping with other people.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you know, i don't think he was real serious about that dinah girl he was seeing.
LEADMALE:You could probably get him back.
SUPMALE:Oh, do you think so? Every night i kneel at the foot of my bed and i pray that we'll get back together and then i make my new boyfriend get out of bed and pray with me.
SUPFEMALE:I just think you guys are really good for each other.
LEADMALE:Mark, stop it.
LEADMALE:David made you come down here, didn't he? No.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't even know i came down.
SUPFEMALE:Just get out.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i don't care what the hell happens between you two.
SUPMALE:I just want david to stay away from my wife.
SUPMALE:Wake up, mark.
LEADMALE:I mean david's just trying to make me jealous.
LEADMALE:He doesn't want becky anymore than my parents did.
LEADMALE:It isn't just for you.
LEADFEMALE:This has been going on way before you came home.
LEADMALE:What? Yeah, they've been spending tons of time together.
LEADMALE:Becky hardly even talks to me anymore.
LEADMALE:I don't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:She thinks david's mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:So what am i? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Uh opposite of that? Get outta my way.
SUPMALE:What are you doing getting involved with david, becky? You're a married woman.
LEADFEMALE:Since when did you care about my marriage? Since you decided to trade moe in for curly.
LEADFEMALE:You're just jealous.
OTHERMALE:No, i am not jealous.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Mind if i watch tv? are you doing this because of some sick competition thing between you and me? i mean, is that what this is about? That is ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:David and i hang out together because we like talking to each other.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i'm sure you find it a lot easier to talk with your skirt over your head.
LEADMALE:You know, i think i watch too much tv.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing with her? Not that i'm necessarily against necrophilia, but i think it's illegal.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing going on between us.
LEADFEMALE:She's my brother's wife, for cryin' out loud.
LEADMALE:The man stuck a fork in my hand when i tried to take his dessert.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if it's not a sex thing, then what is it? I mean, i ran out of things to talk to her about when i was, like, two.
LEADFEMALE:Ignore her, david.
LEADMALE:She's just jealous 'cause we have a relationship where we like and respect each other.
LEADFEMALE:Not like the one you had with david.
SUPMALE:What's that supposed to mean? I was closer to david than you could ever be.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't give me that.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what could the two you possibly have in common? Well we both live with you, and you treated us both like crap.
OTHERMALE:I did not.
SUPMALE:I mean, maybe i treated you like crap, but well, have you ever spent any time with you? Oh, that's right.
LEADMALE:You treated david with lots of respect.
OTHERMALE:I did.
OTHERMALE:Tell her.
LEADFEMALE:You may speak.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, david, now's your chance.
LEADFEMALE:You said you weren't gonna take any more of her abuse.
SUPFEMALE:Abuse? david, what have you been telling her? I can see i'm just in the way here.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, david.
OTHERMALE:Tell her how horrible it was.
LEADMALE:Stand up for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:You don't agree with her, do you? david? Shut up.
SUPMALE:Do you? Darlene come on.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her she's wrong, david.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:At the time, i thought it was great.
SUPFEMALE:But now but now what? I just don't think we ever really connected.
LEADFEMALE:God, david, i mean i was closer to you than anybody i've ever been with in my whole life.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Face it, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You just can't get close to anybody.
SUPMALE:Oh, go to hell, both of you.
LEADFEMALE:You're serving the neighbors sliced twinkies.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think it's too pretentious, do you? you know what? I don't think this is such a good idea.
LEADMALE:We should have just sent them an anonymous note.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:"we're sorry, but our bedroom looks right into yours.
SUPMALE:" signed "anonymous.
SUPFEMALE:" jeez, roseanne, i was taught to respect my elders.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think i can do this.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's no big deal, dan.
LEADFEMALE:If you get nervous, just try picturing them naked.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:We're the coronellis.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:I'm dan connor.
LEADFEMALE:This is my wife roseanne.
LEADMALE:Nice to meet you.
OTHERMALE:I'm skip and this is irene.
LEADFEMALE:Here, i baked you a little something.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Gee, i hate to think of you standing over a hot stove.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on in! sit down! Boy, we were so glad when you moved in.
LEADMALE:'cause, you know, nowadays, when new people move in, you get so nervous, what with oh, all the drug problems and things like that, you know? It seems like everywhere you look nowadays all you see is crack.
SUPFEMALE:This might be a good time to bring up something.
LEADMALE:What a beautiful family! skip, roseanne was talking! Oh, i'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:He loves young people.
SUPMALE:He taught high school for 40 years.
OTHERMALE:And irene was our school nurse.
LEADMALE:Except for those three years when she looked after our boys in korea.
SUPMALE:Oh, but i'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:You were going to say something.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i, uh um, i was wonder what you guys do all day besideshang out.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, roseanne, i thought you had something else you wanted to ask them.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i was wondering where are you guys from? I'm guessing it's some place really warm.
SUPFEMALE:We're from elgin.
SUPFEMALE:You really have a lovely home.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you very much.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, i could give you a tour.
LEADMALE:Yeah, um this is the kitchen.
LEADMALE:You know, no big deal.
SUPMALE:Just--just a kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:The hallway.
LEADMALE:We should go in the bedroom there because at night you get a really good view of the stars there.
OTHERFEMALE:Usually, around now, we have a lovely view of uranus.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, this is our bedroom.
SUPMALE:We named it after our bed.
LEADFEMALE:And, hey, there's our window.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what, skip and irene? I'll bet you can see right into our bedroom from over there.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:We're terribly nearsighted.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, dan's got perfect eyesight.
LEADFEMALE:He don't even need those binoculars he's got sitting there.
SUPFEMALE:You know what your house could use? A hedge.
LEADFEMALE:Not every house can hold a hedge, but yours sure could.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:We like an open yard.
LEADFEMALE:It's more neighborly.
LEADMALE:Uh hold it.
OTHERFEMALE:See, the thing of it is is, um dan? I don't know what "the thing of it is" honey.
LEADMALE:You sure as hell seemed to have a handle on "the thing of it" earlier.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, well, i don't exactly know how tosay this.
LEADMALE:We can see you naked.
SUPFEMALE:That is one time we were looking out the window, and we happened to notice-through no fault of your own-you weren't wearing any clothes.
LEADFEMALE:That's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:We rarely wear clothes around the house.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, dear.
SUPMALE:We believe the human body in its natural state is beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:God, are they nearsighted.
SUPMALE:Uh, look, it's not that we think anything is wrong with nudity.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, me and mr.
LEADMALE:Connor used to have sex that way.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we figure if people don't want to see us, they just won't look.
LEADFEMALE:You don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:It's not that we want to look we can't help it.
SUPFEMALE:You can't help it? Well, we don't want to offend you or anything.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that we think the sight of you might be wrecking our son.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? and how's that? Well uh, no offense, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Uh but look at you.
OTHERMALE:Well, no offense, but look at you and you have clothes on! It isn't our nudity, it's our age, isn't it? Perhaps if we were younger and more attractive, we wouldn't be having this talk.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah, probably not for a couple more weeks.
LEADFEMALE:I feel sorry for you people.
LEADFEMALE:Nudity is our chosen lifestyle.
LEADMALE:But you can't help yourselves.
LEADFEMALE:You're compulsive, sick perverts.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not that easy not to look.
SUPMALE:Well, i certainly think we could manage.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? what color are my eyes? Oh, my god! Come on, dear.
LEADMALE:We're going to plant that hedge, believe me.
LEADFEMALE:And we'll tell all your neighbors just what kind of people you are! Well, it's too late.
SUPFEMALE:They already know.
LEADMALE:You know, honey, we really must entertain more often.
LEADMALE:That was fun.
LEADMALE:Hey, mark where's mom and dad? i gotta get to the bus station are you leaving? No, i just gotta get down there and meet my pimp.
LEADMALE:If i don't get going, he'll smack me around.
LEADFEMALE:Your parents are gone.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:I'm walkin'.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:What, you got a suitcase? No, mark, i wear the same outfit every day.
SUPFEMALE:Then when it gets dirty, i jump into the river fully clothed and beat myself against a rock.
SUPFEMALE:Look, it's a 5-minute drive.
OTHERMALE:I can take you down there.
LEADMALE:That'd be great, but you gotta turn twice to get there.
LEADMALE:How would you find your way back? just forget i offered, all right? I've had enough of your crap.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Look, it hasn't been the best week for me either, all right? I really am sorry.
LEADMALE:Just get your stuff.
LEADFEMALE:You're bummed out about this whole becky thing, right? I mean, there's still a chance you guys could work it out.
SUPMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Like you really care.
SUPMALE:I'm trying to be nice here, mark, you know? It would really be helpful if you didn't speak.
LEADFEMALE:What, you're trying to be nice to me? Man, i must seem really pathetic.
LEADFEMALE:No, i just think that there's gotta be some hope for your marriage if it means this much to you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you cared enough to come down to my room and talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:Apparently, that isn't the easiest thing for anybody to do.
LEADFEMALE:It really didn't help.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe that's because you opened up to me and not to becky.
LEADMALE:So you think if i make myself more open to talk to, becky will come to me instead of david? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well how do i do that? Hell if i know.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene yeah.
SUPMALE:You knowthanks.
OTHERMALE:You know, you're really not that bad a guy, mark.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Are you trying to get back at becky by coming on to me? what? Look, just so you know, no way am i being part of your sick game.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Uh, my son told me that our mom got picked up for speeding.
LEADFEMALE:Just a minute, ma'am.
OTHERMALE:It's a good thing you caught her.
SUPMALE:I mean, these elderly ladies in dodge darts have been terrorizing our community long enough.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, maybe we don't have to bail her out.
OTHERMALE:We could just, like, pretend we didn't get the call.
LEADMALE:Jackie, we've got to get mom out of there before those other prisoners start passing her around like a pack of smokes.
LEADFEMALE:Let me talk to the guy, then.
LEADFEMALE:I did wear the blue.
LEADFEMALE:Sergeant dickson, j.
SUPFEMALE:Harris.
LEADMALE:Ex-officer, retired.
SUPMALE:We are here to retrieve our mother, one harris comma beverly.
LEADMALE:Female, caucasian.
LEADMALE:I said, just a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Said he'd be with us in just a minute.
LEADMALE:I can't believe mom was speeding! She does everything slow.
LEADMALE:She walks slow.
LEADMALE:She eats slow.
SUPMALE:She dies slow.
SUPFEMALE:All right, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Harris comma beverly.
OTHERMALE:She had a minor accident.
LEADMALE:She's fine, but we had to detain her for drunk driving.
LEADFEMALE:What? that huge liar! drunk driving? that's a felony! It is a felony, isn't it? Well, i hope you didn't find the drugs she keeps stashed up her butt.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my goodness, girls, the way they treat an old lady who was speeding.
LEADMALE:Was she belligerent? did you have to beat her? This has been so degrading.
LEADFEMALE:They even took my shoelaces and belt so i wouldn't hurt myself.
LEADFEMALE:Well, wasn't there a sheet you could use? roseanne, why are you so rude to me? what do you mean by driving drunk? If you want to kill yourself, that's fine, but have some consideration for other people.
OTHERFEMALE:We promised that car to d.j. it's not true! i wasn't drunk! What's going to happen to me? Well, usually on a first offense, they give you probation and make you go to aa.
SUPMALE:What? I'm not an alcoholic! i only had one glass of wine! Well, it doesn't count as one glass if you refill it 10 times.
OTHERMALE:Here's her mugshot, sergeant.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god, can i get those in wallet size? Come on, dino.
LEADFEMALE:Frank and sammy are waiting in the car.
SUPFEMALE:So if you can't give me the picture, can i just get the numbers off the bottom? I want to play the lotto.
LEADMALE:** well, i always wondered what an aa meeting looked like.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it should be interesting to see how many of these people mom sends screaming back to the sauce.
LEADMALE:This is so degrading.
LEADMALE:I don't even know why i'm here.
LEADMALE:Well, then, let me remind you.
SUPMALE:Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not an alcoholic.
LEADMALE:Yes, we know.
SUPMALE:We are only here to get your license back.
OTHERMALE:Relax, mom.
SUPFEMALE:You'll have fun.
OTHERMALE:These are party people.
LEADMALE:Hi, welcome to our meeting.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the speaker tonight.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're margaret d.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm roseanne c.
LEADMALE:This is jackie o.
SUPFEMALE:And that's our mother, beverly lorraine harris.
LEADMALE:I'm going to powder my nose.
LEADFEMALE:Huge cokehead.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm four years sober.
SUPFEMALE:How much time do you have? Oh, well, i'm three months pregnant, so it's about two weeks for me.
LEADFEMALE:How much time you got, jackie? She's just kidding.
LEADMALE:We're not really alcoholics.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, you do know that these meetings are only for people in recovery? Now, jackie, you don't have to lie to her about how rough your life has been.
LEADFEMALE:She's 22 years-old.
LEADMALE:There's nothing to be ashamed of.
SUPFEMALE:We've all hit rock bottom.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm clean now.
LEADMALE:And what i'm most proud of is that i was able to quit drinking without gaining a ton of weight.
SUPMALE:Well, one day at a time.
SUPMALE:And a welcome back, kotter to you, too.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god! what? It's leon! hey, roseanne! Wow, i must have stumbled into the wrong room.
SUPMALE:Is this overeaters anonymous? Well, gee, leon, i always kind of figured you for an alky.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you'd have to be pretty drunk to do what you do in bed.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i've noticed that dan drinks quite a bit, too.
SUPFEMALE:Pretty quick for a rummy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, your feeble attempts at wit don't bother me, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:These people are the world to me.
LEADMALE:They're kind, supportive, caring.
LEADMALE:And you on the other hand are cruel, vindictive, and poorly dressed.
LEADMALE:No, leon, they do not have whites only aa.
SUPFEMALE:Keep coming back.
OTHERFEMALE:It works.
SUPMALE:Oh, man, how depressing were those stories? That last guy was the worst.
SUPFEMALE:Imagine passing out on the train tracks.
OTHERFEMALE:You think he would've learned his lesson after he lost that first arm.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's get your thing signed for the judge.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm one of these people.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? It's true, i'm an alcoholic.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't realize it until i heard all these people talking.
LEADFEMALE:C'mon, mom, is this gonna be like when you saw witness and thought you were amish? I drink every day.
LEADFEMALE:I drink whenever i'm alone.
LEADMALE:I am an alcoholic.
LEADMALE:My god, i can't believe all these years mom's a drunk.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you think she would have been more fun.
OTHERMALE:It's true, roseanne.
SUPMALE:This week of sobriety has been the best of my life.
LEADMALE:Every day and in every way, i'm getting better and better.
LEADMALE:Of course, that's due to my higher power.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mom, thank you, but i can't take all the credit.
SUPMALE:It's been so long since we made gingerbread cookies.
LEADMALE:It's very sweet of you to take time off to spend the afternoon with your old, alcoholic grandma.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, mom misled me.
OTHERMALE:I thought she meant we would be drinking.
SUPFEMALE:You know, mom, just last night, darlene was asking me if there was any downside to drinking at all? You're at a very critical age, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to look out for these good time charlies who want to ply a girl with liquor.
LEADMALE:You could wake up with something a lot worse than a hangover.
OTHERFEMALE:That's true, darlene, 'cause a lot of these guys don't want to leave in the morning.
LEADMALE:And these days it's not just the risk of pregnancy.
SUPMALE:A woman of the '90s has to look out for the herpes.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, grandma, there's, like, 10 or hey, hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:You get back in there.
LEADMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:You said david and becky weren't gonna be here.
OTHERMALE:You didn't tell me i was gonna have to spend the afternoon baking with drunken hines.
SUPMALE:What are you laughing at? Uh beetle bailey.
LEADMALE:He's loafing again.
LEADMALE:Will he never learn? so, what are you doing? Get rid of that beer! You are not allowed to drink when my mother's here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, geez, roseanne, don't you think you're going a little overboard with this? No, i don't, dan.
SUPFEMALE:My mother has a disease, and it's not one of those good ones like lockjaw.
SUPFEMALE:It's a disease like cancer.
LEADFEMALE:Would you be making fun of her if she had cancer? what, like, toe cancer, or whole body cancer? Oh, okay, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'll try harder.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me too.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks, you guys.
SUPMALE:There'll be a little extra hash in your brownies tonight.
LEADMALE:Hey, you two, i need someone to put raisins in the eyes.
SUPFEMALE:You hold her down, i'll get the raisins.
LEADMALE:Oh! You know, i can't believe he's gonna sit out the super bowl because of a twisted ankle.
LEADMALE:Football players today ain't nothing but a bunch of babies.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you got that right.
LEADMALE:Dick butkus would have played without pads.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, i seem to recall one year he petitioned the league to play without a helmet.
OTHERFEMALE:Sissy owners wouldn't let him.
LEADMALE:That's nothing.
LEADMALE:You want to talk tough? When the aztecs invented the game, they didn't have a ball, so they used a human head.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:No, that's true.
LEADMALE:And they played for weeks until everybody was dead except for one guy, and they made him king.
OTHERMALE:Now, that's football.
LEADMALE:Yoo hoo! we're here, roseanne! Oh, gee, mom, what a surprise.
SUPFEMALE:I really didn't think jackie would be bringing you by today.
SUPMALE:You could just knock me over with a feather.
LEADMALE:And wonder what i could knock you over with, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Well, mom suggested that we stop by.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, by the way, roseanne, my bridge club is meeting tomorrow, and i'll need you to drive me to elgin.
OTHERFEMALE:I was hoping you wouldn't find this out, mom, but i'm wanted in elgin.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, that's fine.
OTHERMALE:It's just, they serve sherry there, and i didn't want to go alone.
LEADFEMALE:All right, i'll take you.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i drank so much coffee at my meeting, i tell you, i'm wired.
LEADFEMALE:Piddle time! i'm sorry, she insisted on coming over here! but it's your turn! I have to make 50 pigs in the blanket for 20 pigs in the living room.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank god, i thought i heard your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Kind of like those guys in 'nam who still hear the choppers.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, except for it's more like those guys in 'nam who are still in 'nam.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:She can't be here.
LEADFEMALE:It's the super bowl! I got a pony keg out in the garage.
LEADMALE:Well, you guys will have to hurry up and drink it in two minutes.
SUPFEMALE:A pony keg in two minutes? Give me a break, roseanne, we ain't in high school no more.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's unusual.
LEADFEMALE:Someone's left his crutch on the kitchen table.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't you let me order you some of that non-alcoholic beer i used to heat up for d.j. 's bottle.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're busy, then, roseanne.
LEADMALE:So why don't i just go to the store for ya? Oh, that's nice of you, jackie, but i'm going to go to the store myself.
LEADMALE:I have a lot of errands to run, and i'll probably be gone for a long time.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm off to the super game! I'll flip you for it.
LEADFEMALE:Winner gets to leave the house.
SUPFEMALE:Call it.
LEADMALE:Heads.
OTHERMALE:All right! It's heads.
SUPFEMALE:I win! roseanne! I hope none of your friends minded not being able to drink.
OTHERMALE:Nah.
LEADFEMALE:These super bowl parties pretty much break up after kick off, anyway.
LEADMALE:The party won't be dull! i brought a chex mix! Say, that boy looks like the bishop boy who lived down the street.
LEADMALE:Jackie, do you think that could be him? Yes, mother, that's him.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't remember him being that tall.
OTHERFEMALE:He grew.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he used to have long hair, thought, didn't he? He cut it.
SUPFEMALE:No, i don't think that's him.
SUPMALE:You're right, mother, it's not.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, these beer commercials.
LEADMALE:I don't like them one bit.
LEADMALE:They do nothing but promote drinking.
LEADMALE:They are just saying to the american public, that if they drink, they are going to be like those fancy-pants hipsters in the ad.
LEADFEMALE:Now who really drinks beer that cold? I mean, look at the frost forming on the inside of that bottle.
SUPMALE:And why do they pour it so slowly? You're right.
LEADMALE:That's one of the things ruining this country.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna put up the flag, and i'm pretty sure it's out in the garage! good thinking, dan! I better get out there, too.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want old glory dragging on the ground.
SUPMALE:Is that jackson 5 boy gonna be singing at the intermission this year? He's wonderful with the children.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, he's good.
LEADFEMALE:Touch-a-doodle-down-dee! Oh, man, we've been out here for over an hour.
LEADMALE:We'd better go back inside.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you crazy, man? She's in there! Bev.
LEADFEMALE:Beverage.
LEADMALE:Non-alcoholic beverage is in there.
SUPMALE:You know, roseanne's gonna be back really soon, and she's gonna be mad when she finds out we've been drinking.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, she will never be the wiser.
LEADMALE:Breath mints.
OTHERFEMALE:Breath mints? That is just crazy enough to work.
SUPFEMALE:One breath mint.
SUPFEMALE:Damn! damn, damn it all to hell! yoo-hoo, are you in there? Oh, god, too late! it's her! Here she comes.
SUPMALE:One, two, three.
LEADMALE:* for she's a jolly good fellow * * for she's a jolly good fellow * * for she's a jolly good fellow * a party? for me? Yes, a party for you.
OTHERFEMALE:To celebrate celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:Celebrate five days of not drinking.
SUPFEMALE:Hear hear! yeah! you're all drunk! Well, yeah.
SUPMALE:It's a party! I can't believe you would do this to me.
SUPMALE:No one cares.
LEADFEMALE:No one cares! Man, she is an ugly sober.
LEADMALE:Well, better go look for her.
LEADMALE:You know what, dan? She's not a jolly good fellow.
OTHERMALE:Hey, mom, look, i got all these sodas for half-price.
LEADMALE:I went by your old liquor store.
LEADFEMALE:They're having a going out of business sale.
LEADMALE:This is a sick house, roseanne.
LEADMALE:They're all drunk.
LEADFEMALE:Well, lookie who's home.
OTHERMALE:Lookie who's home.
SUPMALE:Well, you said that already.
SUPMALE:You know, mom just said the funniest thing.
SUPFEMALE:She said that you guys were all drunk out there, and i said, well, that cannot possible be, because i specifically told them that they cannot drink when mother's here and they cannot be drunk because if they were drunk, then me doing this would make you both want to puke.
LEADMALE:Stop.
LEADFEMALE:Please, stop.
LEADFEMALE:You can't do one thing.
LEADMALE:You cannot stay sober while my mother, the alcoholic, is in the house.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Your mother is not an alcoholic.
LEADFEMALE:I drink way more than she does.
SUPMALE:Do i look like an alcoholic to you? I'm over here, dan.
LEADMALE:Okay, so we had a little drink.
SUPMALE:It's a special day.
SUPFEMALE:We had just enough to enhance this very special occasion.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that right, jackie? Jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Well, here, let me help you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, we just had a little to drink.
LEADFEMALE:How can i make you understand the importance of super bowl sunday? Perhaps that answer will come to me in a dream.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just lay on the floor, dan, and save yourself that embarrassing fall off the bed? are you okay, mom? Yes, i'm just warning your son about what can happen when you drink too much.
LEADFEMALE:He is what can happen when you drink too much.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, is dad an alcoholic? what are you telling him? Only the truth.
LEADFEMALE:And if your father doesn't get help, he's gonna die! i don't want dad to die! Oh, he's not gonna die, d.j. go check for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:He's in the bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Make sure he's not sleeping on his back.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see any point in lying to the boy.
LEADFEMALE:He's going to have to face the ugly truth sooner or later.
LEADMALE:Dan is not an alcoholic, mom.
SUPMALE:Considering the life he leads, i don't think he drinks nearly enough.
LEADFEMALE:Of course you think that.
LEADMALE:You're in denial.
SUPFEMALE:Your whole family is completely dysfunctional because of an alcoholic father and a mother who is nothing but an enabler.
SUPMALE:Well, that must have been tough for you, mom.
SUPFEMALE:You know, they say the first step is admitting that everyone else has a problem.
SUPMALE:Oh, fine.
LEADMALE:Just dismiss me, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just go on home and maybe i'll have a drink.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:I'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:I did yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, i asked you to stay with me until the news was over, but you had to hurry home and i felt very lonely, and had a drink.
SUPMALE:Get out.
LEADMALE:What? I want you to get out of here before i have a drink.
LEADMALE:You're not just an alcoholic.
SUPFEMALE:You're a carrier.
LEADFEMALE:You can't understand what i'm going through, roseanne.
LEADMALE:I have no control! That is a lot of bull.
SUPMALE:Ever since you became this huge victim, you've got control over everybody.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an alcoholic, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you realize what that means? Yeah, i know exactly what that means, mom.
LEADFEMALE:That means you drink, like you always drank.
LEADFEMALE:Only now you're calling yourself an alcoholic because you think that way you don't have to take any responsibility for anything that you do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, goodbye.
SUPMALE:I should have expected this.
SUPFEMALE:They told me that the people around me might want me to fail.
OTHERMALE:I guess my real family is at aa.
LEADMALE:Keep going home.
OTHERFEMALE:It works.
LEADFEMALE:You know, mom, just last night, darlene was asking me if there was any downside to drinking at all? You're at a very critical age, darlene.
SUPMALE:You've got to look out for these goodtime johnnies who are going to try to ply you with liquor.
LEADMALE:Oh, i'm in trouble now.
LEADFEMALE:All right, here we go.
LEADMALE:Stand by.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Stand by.
OTHERMALE:In five-sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Don't get me started.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, gils, could you turn out? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
OTHERMALE:Stand by.
OTHERFEMALE:In five, four, three, two-you know, mom, just last night, uh, darlene was asking me if there was any downside to drinking at all? You're at
LEADFEMALE:Hey, beck.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dad.
SUPFEMALE:When you were walking around the house this morning, in and out of various rooms, you know, observing things, you didn't happen to see my pants, did you? you lost your pants? Not all of 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:For your information, little girl, i have a very important meeting with my supervisor today, so i need my dockers.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know where they are.
LEADMALE:Ask mom.
SUPFEMALE:I can't ask your mother.
LEADMALE:The doctor said she needed a week of total stress-free bedrest and you know how she hates it when i lose my pants.
SUPMALE:Then wear your regular pants.
OTHERMALE:Dad-just a minute, d.j. these are executives, becky.
LEADMALE:I can't just waltz in there with my regular pants.
SUPMALE:We'll never get that new vending machine.
SUPFEMALE:So? so, what am i supposed to tell my men? that i was kidding about the frozen snack treats? I'd have a riot on my hands.
OTHERFEMALE:I gotta talk to mom about something for school.
SUPMALE:Whoa! Don't bother your mother.
SUPFEMALE:I will tell you everything you need to know about school.
SUPMALE:You have to stay until you're 16, now scoot.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i need something for a bake sale and i told everybody she makes the best cookies in town.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, d.j. , but your mother's just too sick to drive to the bakery.
LEADMALE:But i promised! d.j. ! You okay out there? Never felt younger or more refreshed.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see.
OTHERMALE:Okay, we got frosting and half a meatloaf.
LEADMALE:I'd get real scarce after they sell that.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan? dan? how's roseanne doing? Oh, she's resting.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, you didn't happen to see a pair of pants on the front lawn when you pulled up this morning? things a little hectic, huh? are you kidding? The kids have school, they want breakfast, people have to go to work.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you one thing: she sure picked one heck of a day to get sick.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i hear you.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, could you do me a favor? I don't know, does it involve strangling you? 'cause i'll make time for that.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i wouldn't ask, but fred and i need a babysitter for tuesday night, so we were hoping that maybe you guys could-never mind.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Please finish.
SUPMALE:That we could, what? recommend somebody? sure, who was the guy the lindberghs used? No.
LEADMALE:I'll get somebody else to babysit.
LEADMALE:Someone who loves children.
LEADMALE:Get out of my way, d.j. ! I need the car just as much as you do, mark.
SUPFEMALE:Why should you get it? I'll give you five good reasons.
SUPMALE:One, two, three, four, five.
LEADFEMALE:What are you gonna do with that? wave at me? Ow, ow! Come on, you're wearing a ring.
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner, will you please tell mark that he can't just have the car whenever he wants it? There's gotta be a fair way to settle this.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what it is, so i suggest a slap fight.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine, you wanna make this ugly? I'm getting mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody stop! Okay, the doctor said mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner is sick and has to stay in bed for the next week.
LEADMALE:Okay? That means for the next seven days, under no circumstance is any stress allowed in that bedroom.
OTHERMALE:Therefore, you will all grow up and take care of yourselves around here! you will cook for yourselves, you clean up after yourselves, and you think for yourselves! Got it? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now everybody spread out and find my pants.
LEADMALE:Mom, you'rehere yeah.
LEADMALE:Instead of fred.
LEADMALE:Hi, hi! It's just that i assumed that because fred was babysitting when i left that that when i returned, he would still be here, but, no, it's my mother.
LEADMALE:How nice.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's no trouble really.
LEADFEMALE:Fred had to get some more diapers and i was here to see andy anyway.
SUPMALE:You shouldn't have to come all the way over here to see your grandson.
LEADMALE:What, did you lose the picture we gave you? Hey, honey.
OTHERMALE:Hey, bev.
SUPMALE:Okay, andy, i got the diapers.
LEADFEMALE:Let her rip! Speaking of little accidents, when i babysit, i'll need a list of emergency numbers.
OTHERMALE:I checked next to the phone and i see that in case of fire, there are over 20 chinese restaurants i can call.
SUPMALE:Did you say "babysit"? Hey, honey, good news.
SUPFEMALE:You know how we talked about going out on a date once a week? Well, bev's offered to babysit on tuesday nights.
LEADMALE:Well, that's great.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:Is--but, uh, see, there's trouble.
LEADMALE:'cause, uh i just gave the job to this lady i met.
LEADFEMALE:What lady? what lady? The, uh-the--pffft.
LEADMALE:Wrote the name down, but i--i left it.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna leave our baby with somebody whose name you don't even know? Fred, like she's not gonna introduce herself.
SUPMALE:Why don't you call her and tell her we'd rather have andy's grandmother? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Uh well, there's trouble there 'cause, uh-'cause she's deaf and she won't hear the phone ring.
LEADMALE:I don't think that's really somebody you want watching the child.
OTHERMALE:She has eyes, mother.
LEADMALE:Bev, would you mind putting andy down? Ooh, i'd love it.
LEADMALE:I'll find some of his cleaner stuffed animals to put in the crib with him.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADMALE:Don't you dare call her "mom".
SUPFEMALE:You may call her "bev" or "sea hag.
SUPFEMALE:" what is bugging you? have you lost your mind? I don't want that old woman around the baby.
LEADFEMALE:You're being ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Bev gets along with him great and he loves her! What does he know? He loves my house keys.
OTHERMALE:Come on, jackie.
SUPMALE:You've gotta admit whenever she comes over, his face just lights up.
LEADFEMALE:He is laughing at her.
SUPMALE:I taught him that.
SUPMALE:He looks like an angel.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, jackie, i've rearranged the changing table so it makes sense.
LEADMALE:Look, when she's babysitting, you won't have to be around her.
LEADMALE:Come on, jackie, you owe it to the kid to try to make things up with his grandmother.
SUPMALE:All right, fine.
OTHERMALE:It's just that none of this would've happened if you hated her like a normal person.
SUPMALE:Well, time for me to hit the hay.
LEADMALE:It's my turn to take care of andy in the morning.
SUPMALE:Oh, how nice.
LEADFEMALE:You have a husband who lets you sleep in while he does your work for you.
OTHERMALE:Mom, about tuesday nights-oh, my pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:I can see as long as i have a dustrag, i'll never be bored.
OTHERMALE:Well, the job is yours if you could just do me one little favor.
LEADFEMALE:What, dear? Not a big favor.
LEADMALE:It's just, uh, something i've always wanted you to do and it'd make me feel better about you spending time with andy.
LEADMALE:Well, of course.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Um, say that every single thing you ever did in my life was wrong.
SUPMALE:What? Every decision you made, everything you said, every look you gave, wrong, wrong, wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you talking about? I'm talking about the way you raised me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i don't believe it was wrong.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to believe it.
LEADFEMALE:You just have to say it.
SUPFEMALE:You've lost your mind.
LEADMALE:Not allowed to write it.
LEADMALE:And you can't sing it.
SUPMALE:You must say it loud and clear.
LEADFEMALE:"everything i did was wrong!" i most certainly will not.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then you can't babysit your grandson.
SUPMALE:Butthat's just wrong! Ohthat was close.
LEADMALE:Not close enough.
LEADMALE:Well! Oh, man, this is so great, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Look at me: i'm laying in bed, reading the inquirer, eating this cheese whiz right out of the bottle just like the queen of england.
SUPMALE:Not quite, honey.
SUPMALE:The queen of england can't get the dukes of hazzard.
LEADFEMALE:Happy now? My foot's kinda blocking my view here.
OTHERFEMALE:Mark.
OTHERMALE:That leg gets crossed again, honey, just give us a call.
OTHERMALE:I just wanted to tell you that i finished working your shift at the diner.
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:How were the tips? Pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Well, just leave 'em up there on the dresser.
OTHERFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, there's kind of been something that's bothering me.
SUPMALE:Your doctor called the diner today because he needed to reschedule your next appointment.
SUPMALE:Yeah? well, i hate myself for even thinking this, but why would he call you at the diner if he ordered you to stay in bed? All right, i'll split the tips with you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! You're faking this whole thing? Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:I know it's not my place, but what you're doing is more than just wrong, it's-oh, it's really wrong.
LEADMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPFEMALE:I'm pregnant, i don't feel good, and i'm tired.
LEADMALE:And this is the only way i could get a break.
LEADMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't know if i can go along with it.
LEADFEMALE:What's your favorite dinner? I don't know, roast beef, mashed potatoes, i guess, but-becky! i want you to make me roast beef and mashed potatoes for dinner tonight! No fair.
LEADMALE:It's david's turn to cook.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, david doesn't have to cook anymore.
LEADFEMALE:He's, uh, above you now.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Oh, god, now i'm a part of this.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, it's great.
OTHERMALE:Isn't it, david? And this is just the beginning.
LEADMALE:Go get me that family portrait over there.
SUPMALE:Why? Because.
LEADMALE:I want you to close your eyes and point out a family member.
LEADMALE:And whoever you point out, i'm gonna make them bathe me.
LEADMALE:Dan, i'm bored! How much longer do i have to stay in bed? Well, you told me the doc said a week.
LEADMALE:How many days has it been? Just the one.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Is dandruff shampoo bad for dishes? are they already in there? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:No, it's fine.
LEADFEMALE:How's she doing? She's starting to get a little bored.
LEADMALE:She's been counting the cracks in the ceiling.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, there weren't any till she got a hold of my nail gun.
SUPMALE:I gotta talk to her about a problem.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:The doctor said no stress, and no stress it is.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then i guess i'll just handle it myself.
LEADFEMALE:I'm an adult.
LEADMALE:That's good, jackie.
OTHERMALE:It's really important, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I need to talk to somebody.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't a sex problem, is it? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, i need someone who hates mom.
SUPFEMALE:I'm listening.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:So, mom volunteered to babysit, for free, every tuesday night and fred is pushing me to let her do it.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? so? so? So i'm not going to trust her with andy.
SUPFEMALE:She shouldn't be left alone in a room with any baby.
SUPMALE:Why not? Roseanne always liked having her babysit.
LEADMALE:Bev was great with our kids.
SUPMALE:Man, she could take a punch.
LEADMALE:No, dan, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne would never approve of mom babysitting.
LEADMALE:Roseanne hates our mother.
SUPMALE:Of course she does! Roseanne hates vegetables too, but she doesn't keep our family from corn.
LEADMALE:You're on mom's side.
LEADMALE:No, i'm on you and fred's side.
LEADMALE:You leave the kid with bev, you two get a night out, and all the dishes in the cabinet get rewashed.
SUPFEMALE:Good god, dan, you're talking about mom! i know! What do you think's gonna happen? she's gonna forget to change him, forget to feed him? give him to the paperboy instead of a tip? you really think your mother would harm your child at all? Well last time i went out when i came back you didn't see the hat she put on his head.
LEADMALE:Come on, jackie, you're being ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:You're not worried about andy.
LEADFEMALE:You're doing this to punish bev.
LEADFEMALE:So? You're just doing this to be wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Mom is a horrible woman.
LEADMALE:You and roseanne may let her near your kids, but i love my child.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:If you'd read the instructions on a pack of condoms, you wouldn't have a child.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, do you know the name of mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner's gynecologist? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, no.
LEADMALE:I mean, why? I wanna call 'em to find out what's going on.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner doesn't tell me much and i'm afraid it's worse than she's letting on.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, here it is.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you know what? I'll call the gynecologist for you.
LEADFEMALE:I had to call him yesterday for mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner for something and i kind of have a relationship with her gynecologist.
SUPMALE:That's interesting, david.
OTHERMALE:Hello, doctor? It's david.
LEADMALE:Listen, we were just wondering if mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner's condition is any worse than she says.
LEADFEMALE:No, uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's exactly the same as she says.
LEADMALE:Okay, then.
LEADMALE:Thanks, doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, david.
OTHERFEMALE:Ask the doctor what the condition's called.
SUPMALE:Uh, mr.
SUPMALE:Conner wants to know what this disease is called.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Mono-cly-nosis-david, hang up the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:Goodbye, doctor.
LEADMALE:That wasn't the doctor, was it, david? No, sir.
LEADFEMALE:And mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner is faking it, isn't she? Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:I can't believe she did this! I had to sleep on the couch.
SUPFEMALE:I had to move the tv in there.
SUPFEMALE:I had to sleep on the couch without tv! Come on, she's not totally wrong.
SUPMALE:I mean, you did tell her to take it a little easy and a lot of people might think that that meant to spend a week in bed.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then in a way, i guess this worked out for the best.
LEADMALE:You're not mad? mad? No.
SUPFEMALE:But this is our little secret, okay? dan, i can't stand this anymore! i'm gonna go for a little walk! Get my shoes, will you? No, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:The doctor said you deserve your rest and you're gonna get what you deserve.
SUPMALE:You're not gonna kill me, are you, mr.
LEADMALE:Conner? kill you? No.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't squirrel season, david.
LEADFEMALE:I'm huntin' bear.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my, it's jackie.
SUPFEMALE:What can i do for you.
LEADFEMALE:If you've come to insult me, why don't you just save it for my eulogy.
SUPMALE:You probably won't have to wait long.
LEADFEMALE:Why, what have you heard? why are you always so cruel? Mother, i didn't come over here to fight.
OTHERMALE:I came over to tell you that it is okay for you to babysit andy.
LEADMALE:Really? Yes.
LEADMALE:Thank you, jackie.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE:I'll see you on tuesday.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you changed your mind.
SUPFEMALE:I really didn't understand why you got so upset with me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i take very good care of andy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i know, mom.
LEADMALE:And andy really loves his ol' gran-gran.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he does.
LEADFEMALE:I'm crazy about that boy.
LEADMALE:I'm always very good to him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
OTHERMALE:I justwish you could've been good to me.
SUPFEMALE:Why, jackie, i was good to you.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, you weren't, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Not the way you are with andy.
SUPMALE:I see the way that you look at him and you sing to him and you cuddle with him, and you never were that way with me.
SUPMALE:Oh oh, jackie, it was all so long ago.
SUPMALE:I told myself that you just didn't have it in you, but if you can give it to andy, i don't know why you couldn't ever give it to me.
OTHERMALE:What was so bad about me? Oh, jackie, it wasn't you.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, it was me.
SUPMALE:I mean, why was i so unlovable? It wasn't you.
LEADMALE:Oh, jackie, it was me.
LEADFEMALE:What? Being a mother was just a very hard job for me.
LEADMALE:It was all the time, day and night.
LEADMALE:And i had your father to contend with, not to mention roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, so, you know, i didn't get much love because i had a cheating father and a difficult sister.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:It's because i was young and just not very good at it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Now, mom-i'm just so sorry.
LEADMALE:Mom, don't.
SUPFEMALE:You deserve better.
LEADMALE:Mom, i wasn't perfect.
LEADFEMALE:I--you know, the dog skippy? i put him to sleep after he shredded your wedding dress? That wasn't skippy.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:You know, jackie, the truth is i'm sort of jealous of you.
LEADMALE:What? Yes.
LEADMALE:You waited until you were older to have andy.
OTHERMALE:You're more settled, more patient.
LEADFEMALE:You're a good mother.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:You're telling me that i'm a good mother? you're complimenting me? I can't-this is like a dream come true.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, this is, like, one of those golden moments that comes around only once in a lifetime.
SUPFEMALE:And i also think that you and fred-mom, don't, please, say another word.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Mom, you're gonna say something mom-like and you're just gonna ruin it.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna-you're gonna ruin my moment.
SUPMALE:No, i'm not.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i think you will.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just gonna say.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not listening to you.
LEADMALE:Le le le le le well, i'll see you tuesday.
LEADMALE:Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll bring my vacuum since yours seems to be broken.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No, it's still good.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dan.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going? Pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Quick question.
SUPFEMALE:You weren't just trying to head out the front door, were you? who me? No, i just came to.
LEADFEMALE:'cause d.j. said he saw you heading out the front door and when he called for me, you did a u-y and torqued back in the bedroom.
OTHERMALE:Feet cold? No, not since i put my shoes on.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, the doctor said you were supposed to stay in bed for a week, and that's what you're gonna do.
LEADFEMALE:Now if you'll excuse me, i have a few exits to block up.
SUPFEMALE:And i've nailed the windows shut.
OTHERFEMALE:Shoot! Roseanne, you're not too sick for me to talk to you, are you? No.
SUPFEMALE:Get in here.
OTHERMALE:I've been dying for the sound of another human voice.
LEADFEMALE:Read me the ingredients on this cheez whiz.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not gonna believe this.
OTHERMALE:Mom said she's a bad mother.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? like in the way that shaft was a bad mother? No, i'm serious.
OTHERFEMALE:She said those exact words! Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you've gotta sit down and tell me every single detail of this.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i go over-okay, now wait! All right, now i'm ready.
OTHERMALE:Um-hey, hey, hey, what's going on in here? I'm just telling roseanne this really great stuff about mom.
LEADMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:You bring up the name of-there's gonna be stress.
OTHERMALE:Shut up, dan.
LEADMALE:See, already it starts.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, no.
OTHERFEMALE:She's been waiting then she can wait another week.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Doctor's orders.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Uhokay.
OTHERMALE:The doctor really never said i had to stay in bed.
LEADMALE:Out, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you don't have to go just 'cause he tells you to.
SUPMALE:Yeah! You have a point.
LEADMALE:Dan, put me down! put her down! oh, roseanne, my god, it was glorious! say goodbye, jackie! no, no, no, wait, wait, wait! Roseanne, she cried.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE: i'll be there in a second.
LEADMALE:Why do people always interrupt us whenever we start to fool around? Well, it's all part of my plot, fred.
OTHERMALE:I am trying to die without ever having another orgasm.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look who's up before the cartoons.
LEADFEMALE:Is the baby up yet? Up, shaved, showered, and gone to work.
SUPMALE:He's in the nursery.
LEADFEMALE:That kid is always here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he likes his cousin.
LEADFEMALE:He should be playing with his friends.
SUPMALE:Every day that kid comes over here, and every day he's a little stranger than the day before.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you were gonna talk to roseanne about him coming over here all the time.
LEADMALE:Hey, you guys, look what i did! oh! Look at that, fred.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what a clever boy.
LEADFEMALE:He's got our only child in a cooking pot.
LEADMALE:Just let me have my pot.
LEADMALE:Um, can i have that box? why? Well, 'cause this kid at school taught me to eat cardboard.
SUPFEMALE:Wanna see? I can eat the whole box in an hour.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , if you're hungry, just go in the kitchen and get some of those rice cakes in there.
OTHERFEMALE:They taste just like cardboard and they won't bind you up so bad.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I think there's something really wrong with that kid.
LEADFEMALE:I can't keep him from coming here without hurting roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:At least you got your priorities straight.
SUPFEMALE:After all, roseanne is the father of your child.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, fred, fine.
OTHERMALE:If you're gonna make a federal case out of it, i will talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Let me just think of a very gentle way of telling roseanne that you hate her son.
LEADMALE:I don't hate him.
LEADFEMALE:I just think he's a little weird.
LEADMALE:Why do you have to think of it that way? I don't know why you can't appreciate him the way my family always has.
LEADMALE:You have a headache, d.j. ? Heh, not yet.
LEADFEMALE:Where you going? Mark's out of town and darlene is coming home.
LEADFEMALE:It's the perfect time for me to visit aunt jackie.
OTHERMALE:It's your mother's birthday sunday.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going anywhere.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, becky.
LEADMALE:Now, look your mom doesn't want much for her birthday.
LEADFEMALE:A new pair of shoes, dinner in a nice restaurant, daughters who get along.
LEADFEMALE:Let's be honest; the first two are a pipe-dream.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, you can't make up with someone who has no feelings.
LEADMALE:Darlene is like a machine.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true at all.
OTHERMALE:Machines can't hate.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, i meant what i told her.
OTHERMALE:I think she's a cold-hearted brat who doesn't care about anyone but herself.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i probably shouldn't tell you this but when i was talking to darlene about coming home this weekend, she was actually crying.
SUPFEMALE:She thinks you hate her.
LEADMALE:Really? darlene was crying? And not just a little.
SUPFEMALE:Remember that time when she was ten and we told her that she wasn't adopted? Like that.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know.
LEADMALE:Hey, dad, is the box the refrigerator came in still in the garage? D.j. , do me a favor and don't eat the refrigerator box.
LEADMALE:And why don't you go upstairs and unpack.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:What's that suitcase made out of? Go.
SUPMALE:Why can't i eat the box the refrigerator came in? Because eating cardboard can ruin your life.
SUPMALE:You could end up in the street, living in a box.
LEADMALE:Then you'll eat the box and you'll be homeless.
LEADFEMALE:I'm home.
SUPMALE:Oh, dad, i just feel so bad.
LEADMALE:It's okay, little girl.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get through it.
LEADMALE:I just couldn't believe it when i got your message.
SUPMALE:How did nana mary die? Oh, it was just something fatal.
LEADMALE:I'm just so glad you're home.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, well, of course i'm home.
LEADMALE:I mean, what do you think of me? Oh, well, i didn't know.
LEADMALE:I mean, you wouldn't come home for your mom's birthday 'cause you were so mad at becky.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but this is, like, a whole different thing.
OTHERMALE:I mean, my great-grandmother is dead.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, i've got some happy news.
LEADFEMALE:Nana mary's alive! What? She's not even sick.
SUPMALE:Isn't that great? Wait i can't believe that you faked my great-grandmother's death just to get me home.
OTHERFEMALE:That's horrible.
SUPMALE:That's disgusting.
LEADMALE:That's like something mom would do.
LEADMALE:Yeah, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, i kinda thought of it as a present for her.
LEADMALE:Look, darlene, it's good to have you home.
LEADFEMALE:No matter what i said to you before, i'm still your big sister.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, becky, i think of you more as a big cyst.
LEADMALE:You told me she came home to make up.
SUPMALE:Oh, i did.
SUPFEMALE:I came home to make up a list of losers.
SUPMALE:Let's see, there's you and your husband and-well, that's it.
LEADMALE:That's enough.
SUPMALE:Both of you.
SUPMALE:Now, i want you two to make up and get along.
OTHERMALE:Forget this.
LEADMALE:I'm not staying here if no one's dead.
LEADMALE:And brain-dead doesn't count.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not going anywhere.
LEADMALE:Now look, i can't make you two guys really like each other, but it's your mom's birthday and i can damn sure make you fake it for her.
SUPMALE:Oh, this is insane.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, maybe so, but get your coats on.
LEADMALE:We have a little show to put on for your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Bitch.
OTHERMALE:Skag.
SUPMALE:Nice hair.
OTHERMALE:Nice life.
OTHERFEMALE:Go to hell.
LEADFEMALE:Go to the mall.
SUPFEMALE:We can rehearse more in the car.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going out for about an hour, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Can i pick up anything? Yeah, uh a hitch-hiker with an ax.
SUPFEMALE:I have been handling all the tables all day.
OTHERFEMALE:What have you been doing? Well, somebody has to sit here and handle all the complaints about the slow service.
LEADMALE:Hey, honey look who came home to celebrate your birthday.
SUPMALE:Oh, isn't that great? how did you keep 'em from fighting on the way over? You used that old trick where you put one in the front seat and one in the trunk.
OTHERFEMALE:Fighting? Oh, no, not these two angels.
SUPFEMALE:Watch this, honey.
LEADMALE:Becky, don't you have something to say to darlene? I love you.
SUPMALE:Darlene, don't you have something say to becky? I love you more.
LEADFEMALE:That is so wonderful, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:You've gotten our two daughters stoned.
LEADMALE:Nope, just sat 'em down and gave 'em a good talking-to.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna hurry.
SUPMALE:The lobo's only open for another seven hours.
LEADMALE:I'm not buying it, you guys.
LEADMALE:Michael jackson and lisa marie look more in love than you.
SUPMALE:Well, that's it.
LEADMALE:You can stop pretending that you don't hate me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's not that i hate you, becky.
SUPMALE:I just hate all vegetables.
LEADMALE:You're the vegetarian.
OTHERMALE:Eat me.
SUPMALE:Okay, so that's enough.
OTHERMALE:Now, we have a wonderful, loving family, and you two little bitches are not gonna ruin it.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna be loving, caring sisters just like me and jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll sleep with every guy in town and you can gain you know, roseanne, that reminds me.
LEADMALE:Could you, um, tell d.j. to stop hanging around my place so much? why? Well, the baby could catch something.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. must pick up a lot of germs at school.
SUPMALE:Germs can't live on d.j. ; the lice eat 'em right up.
LEADMALE:No, i'm serious.
SUPMALE:Just tell him not to come by.
LEADMALE:What's going on, jackie? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:It's just d.j. sometimes gets on my nerves.
OTHERMALE:Yeah? so? He gets on my nerves too.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why i send him over to your house.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he has been doing some odd things lately and i would just like if you kept him away.
SUPMALE:Yeah, could you keep him away from me too? Don't get me wrong.
LEADMALE:I like d.j. i just like him more when i'm not around him.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you like him more than i do.
LEADMALE:So, what? you don't like your little nephew? Just because you didn't meet him in a bar doesn't mean that he's not a good guy.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you getting so defensive about? You did just call her son a mentally defective freak.
LEADFEMALE:I said he was annoying.
OTHERFEMALE:And now you're harping on it.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about it, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:You won't ever have to see d.j. again.
LEADMALE:Roseanne! no! I'm not taking the chance that you could hurt his feelings.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be bad enough when i tell him all the terrible things you've said.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Just-i give up.
LEADFEMALE:I never meant to hurt d.j. you think your kid's so great.
SUPMALE:At least my kid doesn't crap in his pants.
LEADFEMALE:You know, leon uh, i'd be happy to drop that off at the bank for you and, you know, you can close up.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:That's just what i should do, give roseanne's daughter all the money to the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:And then later, i'll ask your mother if she'll guard my pork for me.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind if i sit here? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:It might be a little easier for me to ignore you if you stayed over there.
OTHERMALE:Uh, listen, last time you were home, i said some things that were kind of harsh about how you and i never connected.
SUPFEMALE:That's okay, david.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, i kind of agreed with you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Well, still, i might have gone a little overboard when i called you cold and mean.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it, david.
OTHERMALE:Let's face it, our relationship was a bit of a joke.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if i would go that far.
LEADMALE:It's not like we ever really talked or opened up or anything.
LEADMALE:God knows the sex was pretty pathetic, huh? I held back a lot 'cause i didn't want to intimidate you.
LEADFEMALE:God, when i think of how hot the sex is with jimmy, it really makes me laugh.
LEADMALE:Gotta go.
LEADMALE:I'll see you later, okay? Listen, darlene, i really am glad that you've found somebody that you can get close to.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I thought you left already.
LEADMALE:No, i just stayed to cut some onions and i just started thinking about all the people that don't have onions.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, jackie, mom's gonna forgive you for calling d.j. weird.
OTHERFEMALE:Hell, she forgave me for writing "please point at me and scream" in permanent magic marker on his forehead.
LEADFEMALE:There's no way you can help me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:I can't help you.
LEADMALE:I'd be a terrible person for anyone to confide in.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, i'm a cold and unfeeling person who can't get close to anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, that's not what i'm saying.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Darlene, what-what to you mean you can't get close to anybody? You've been seeing jimmy for months.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, we broke up.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i lied.
OTHERFEMALE:He dumped me.
OTHERFEMALE:Apparently, he couldn't get close to me either.
LEADMALE:Well did you ever have a dog? Yeah, thanks, aunt jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene, i was crying because i lied to your mother about d.j. what? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i do like d.j. yeah, i mean, that would upset me too.
LEADMALE:It's fred who thinks that d.j. is weird.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, so then why are you taking the blame for fred? Because fred and your mother both want to be the most important person in my life.
LEADMALE:If your mother knew that fred wanted this, then she would want me to choose her over him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:And now she hates me.
LEADFEMALE:And i hate it when she hates me.
LEADMALE:Uh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:So do you feel better that i confided in you? Yeah, i do.
OTHERFEMALE:'cause i feel better too.
SUPMALE:Uh, would you stop if i gave you a hug? I-see, you're--you're very good at this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, i know.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd better hurry up.
OTHERMALE:Dinner out with jackie and fred.
LEADFEMALE:Where's my fancy eatin'-pants.
LEADMALE:No, we're not going to go out with those two.
LEADMALE:I just had a big fight with jackie about d.j. being weird.
OTHERFEMALE:Which side did you take? which side do you think? you said he wasn't? D.j. is not weird, dan.
SUPMALE:He's just marching to the beat of a weird drummer.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks that he's so weird that she doesn't even want him around her house anymore.
LEADFEMALE:My god, this is serious, roseanne.
SUPMALE:We gotta do something.
OTHERMALE:I know, he won't go around her house anymore.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , come down here! Well, fine, then you sit your teenage son down here and you tell him that his aunt just doesn't want him around anymore.
SUPFEMALE:And while you're at it, why don't you just tell him that there's no such thing as santa claus.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Sit down, son.
LEADMALE:Listen, deej we think you should spend more time here and less at jackie's.
LEADFEMALE:How come? Well, because your aunt jackie's been real busy lately cooking, cleaning, and hating the innocent.
OTHERFEMALE:Doesn't aunt jackie want me to come over? oh, well sometimes grown-ups, like your aunt jackie-we just miss you around here! What do you want to go over there for anyway? Well, i have to go over there.
LEADMALE:Why? Well, you see, becky and darlene are sisters, and mom and aunt jackie are sisters, and mark and david are brothers, and mom's new baby is gonna be a girl, so i'm the only one who can be andy's brother.
SUPFEMALE:He needs me.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, go on, big guy, why don't you just take tiny tim's crutch and beat him over the head with it? No, i'm gonna go find the other kids and tell 'em d.j. 's my favorite.
SUPMALE:Doesn't aunt jackie like me anymore? Yeah, of course she likes you; she likes you a lot.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, she's worried that andy might even get jealous about it.
SUPMALE:So next time you're there playing with andy, if aunt jackie tells you that you're hanging around too much, just play along with it.
SUPFEMALE:You know, tell her to shut up and then wink at her.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Mom, you shouldn't have told d.j. he could play with andy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, jackie's just being a big idiot.
LEADMALE:Andy's not gonna get hurt.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. 's way past the "let's cut it open and see how it works" phase.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's not aunt jackie's fault.
LEADMALE:She doesn't mind d.j. what are you talking about? Well, jackie told me that it's fred that doesn't want d.j. around.
OTHERMALE:She's just going along with him.
LEADMALE:She is dead.
LEADFEMALE:So what, you're gonna go over there and yell at her for taking fred's side over yours? No, i'm gonna yell at her for lying to me.
OTHERMALE:Bull.
LEADMALE:For the first time in her life, jackie's putting fred before you and you can't stand that.
SUPFEMALE:You think she should always put you before her own husband.
OTHERMALE:I do not.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't even think anything like that.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, mom, darlene's right.
LEADMALE:I mean, you always want me to put you in front of mark.
SUPMALE:That is not true.
LEADMALE:What i said was, we should put mark in front of a bus.
LEADFEMALE:Mark getting hit by a bus? doesn't she have any feelings? doesn't she realize how many people would be late for work? Fine, darlene.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry i tried to help you.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Um never mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Keep going.
SUPMALE:Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, i-i just wanna say never mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? Oh, well, there's-there's this question that's been bothering me.
SUPMALE:Okay, if me and fred were in a terrible accident and we both needed a kidney, and you had the kidney to give, where would you want fred buried? did darlene talk to you? Yes.
LEADMALE:I can't believe that you really think that i would expect to be more important to you than your own husband; i'd never do that.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you wanted to stand between us at the altar.
LEADMALE:That was a joke! I know you have to put your husband before me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like it, but i accept it.
LEADFEMALE:All right, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:All right, come on.
LEADMALE:We're all right.
SUPMALE:Cheer up.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, mom's got a mole that changed colors twice this week.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not us that i'm worried about.
SUPMALE:I'm worried about me and fred.
OTHERMALE:Why? what do you mean? Whenever i have to choose between you and fred, i always wanna choose you.
LEADMALE:That's terrible.
SUPMALE:It is terrible, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Fred thinks that i always put you before him and he's right.
SUPFEMALE:What does that say about my marriage? I know you always put dan first.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true, jackie.
LEADMALE:I'm just as bad as you.
LEADMALE:I put me first, too.
SUPMALE:I'm in big trouble, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Fred thinks that he should be the most important person in the world to me and, until i can give him that, things aren't going to be okay between us.
LEADMALE:Hey, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You're parked in my spot.
OTHERMALE:Hi, fred.
LEADMALE:I suppose you want me to move it for him.
LEADFEMALE:Right, jackie? what? Of course i'll move my car for him.
LEADFEMALE:And i'll keep my kid out of here for him.
LEADMALE:Anything else i can do for him, jackie? Well, roseanne, i have to put him first.
LEADMALE:He is my husband.
SUPMALE:But jackie-no, no.
OTHERMALE:I took vows.
LEADMALE:Thanks, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i'm sorry, but this was bound to happen.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:But you've gotta understand, fred, she's not just my sister, she's my best friend.
LEADFEMALE:This hurts.
SUPMALE:Oh, gee man, i didn't wanna hurt you.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay, fred.
OTHERMALE:I still have my work.
OTHERMALE:Well, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You know jackie, maybe d.j. can come over.
LEADMALE:No, no, fred.
LEADMALE:You don't want him, end of story.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:He's a good kid.
LEADFEMALE:He can come over every once in a while.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, fred.
LEADFEMALE:Four or five times a week, tops.
OTHERFEMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:Heh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, why don't we go out to dinner like we planned? No, roseanne, fred really doesn't want to.
LEADMALE:Well, okay.
LEADMALE:I guess i'll just go home and spend some quality time with my husband though i'm not sure our marriage can take it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:It's not that i didn't wanna go out with you and dan, it's just that i didn't wanna go out.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe we could just eat here.
LEADMALE:If that's okay with you, fred.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what, why don't you give dan a call and tell him to bring d.j. too.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how you doing? i'm d.j. what's your name? Well, i know i may not look like much now, but in a few years, i'm gonna look like this.
LEADMALE:Hi, d.j. i'm jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Cardboard, it does a body good.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Well, i give up.
LEADMALE:Our insurance company only gave us a hundred dollars to fix this water damage.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i can't get anybody to paint it for that.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, leon, there's gotta be some interior decorator out there that owes you a big favor.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what a classy comment, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You know, it's a wonder that you work here in a diner and not in the world of opera, where they would appreciate a woman of yourgirth.
SUPFEMALE:Don't talk to me about class.
SUPFEMALE:And it's pronounced oprah.
SUPMALE:Listen, stacy, i'm really sorry about you breaking up with you boyfriend.
LEADMALE:I know how hard that is.
LEADMALE:I mean, you feel alone, you feel empty, you feel like a part of you died.
LEADMALE:So, if there's anything i can do to help can you lend me 40 bucks? Well, uh i've got 12.
LEADMALE:Whenever.
SUPFEMALE:You know, if we don't get him neutered, he's gonna end up spraying everywhere.
SUPMALE:I just--i think it's disgusting the way that stacy is taking advantage of our david.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:If anybody's gonna take advantage of our david, it'll be me.
OTHERMALE:David, come over here.
SUPMALE:Yeah, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner? Uh, you can't hang around here anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I can't? No.
LEADMALE:We've got this painter coming in to do this wall tomorrow.
LEADMALE:It's gonna be way too crowded.
OTHERFEMALE:And it's gonna take that painter probably all day to fix that wall, and then he'll probably stretch it out so he can just stand there and stare at stacy.
SUPMALE:Hey, what if i painted the wall for you? you? Well, that's right.
LEADMALE:You do paint.
LEADMALE:But i couldn't take advantage of you like that, david.
LEADMALE:I've only got $20 to work with.
LEADMALE:No, i could do a mural.
LEADMALE:I mean, it would be a great opportunity for me.
LEADFEMALE:I would feel like i was taking advantage of you.
LEADMALE:Well, i wouldn't want you to feel bad, david.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:I won't pay you anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:And bring your own paint.
SUPFEMALE:Could you help me with my math? I'm not good at math.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't care.
LEADMALE:Get out of here.
SUPMALE:Break's over, stacy.
LEADMALE:Those dishes have been on table three for an hour.
LEADMALE:Could someone else clean that table? I can't.
LEADMALE:Why not? 'cause that's me and billy's table.
LEADMALE:It brings back too many memories.
LEADMALE:I never saw the two of you sitting there.
LEADMALE:Well, we didn't.
LEADMALE:Then how can you call it "our table"? I mean, if you didn't even eat dinner there, what else could you-oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:You had sex on it? is that a problem? No, it's no problem.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta go talk to roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't about you.
OTHERFEMALE:Stacy had sex on one of our tables.
LEADMALE:God, i hope they left her a good tip.
LEADMALE:That's not funny.
SUPMALE:I find it disgusting.
SUPMALE:I wanna fire her.
SUPMALE:Well, i wanna keep her and install some security cameras.
LEADMALE:You think it's okay? God, don't be such a hypocrite, after all the places you've done it.
SUPFEMALE:I never did something like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, jackie, i'm the one that had to tell you that you could do it laying down.
LEADFEMALE:I am an adult now.
LEADFEMALE:My life has become more stable.
LEADMALE:I have values.
LEADFEMALE:You're jealous.
LEADFEMALE:I am not jealous of that slutty, trampy mother of ours.
LEADFEMALE:I like mom.
LEADFEMALE:I really can't clean table three.
OTHERFEMALE:Could someone else please do it? Okay, i'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:Just do me a favor and finish cleaning up this ice machine.
LEADMALE:I can't clean that either.
LEADFEMALE:How's the mural coming? Great.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't wait to get to college and really study art.
LEADFEMALE:Who's art? your new boyfriend? I'm real proud of you, david.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be the first conner man to go to college.
LEADMALE:Wait, you're not a conner.
SUPMALE:You'll be the first man i know to go to college.
SUPMALE:See, mark? Some people value education.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? if those college boys are so smart, how come they're always asking guys like me to fix their toilets? Leave him alone.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you proud of your brother? Yeah, of course.
SUPMALE:Dan, you know, when you were younger did you ever think about going to college? Oh, sure.
SUPFEMALE:When i was his age it was the most important thing in the world to me.
SUPFEMALE:Then the the draft ended and i didn't see the point.
SUPMALE:Hi, mark.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, do you think i could watch you work on the pipes? I mean, i love to watch guys fix things.
LEADMALE:You do, huh? Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:That's pretty mental.
LEADFEMALE:You're so funny.
LEADFEMALE:You want a coffee? No.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:What the hell are you doing? what? You're a married man.
SUPMALE:You shouldn't be coming on to stacy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not coming on to her.
OTHERFEMALE:She was coming on to me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, that doesn't even make sense.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one who's available.
LEADFEMALE:Why would she want you and not me? Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, mrs.
SUPMALE:Size 7 shoes.
LEADFEMALE:Leon? mm-hmm? can i ask you a question about women? Well, it's a bit like asking mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner about low-cal desserts, but go ahead.
OTHERMALE:Uh, i was wondering-come here.
LEADMALE:I was wondering what they like in a guy.
LEADMALE:You know, since you like guys this is offensive, isn't it? No, actually, it's surprisingly interesting.
SUPMALE:Well, it's just-is mark better-looking than me? Come on, david.
LEADMALE:I mean, that's like trying to compare apples and what do they call those dinky little tiny oranges? The ug-kumquats! Everyone loves kumquats.
LEADMALE:I think stacy likes apples.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about it, david.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, when i was a kid about your age, i wasn't very popular with the girls either, and things worked out great for me.
LEADMALE:But you're gay.
OTHERFEMALE:Best of luck to you.
LEADMALE:Hey, stacy, i was wondering could i paint you in my mural? wow! Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:That's why i've been kind of staring at you a lot, not because i'm some creep.
LEADMALE:Hey, mark, guess what? David's going to put me in his picture.
LEADMALE:This is going to be so much fun! Boy, mark, now i bet you wish you had used crayons for more than just stabbing people, huh? hey, stace, you still want to watch me fix that pipe? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey! What are you doing? Just proving a point.
LEADMALE:Why don't you get back to your painting there, fembrandt? jackie? honey? you okay? do we have to go to the lobo tonight? can't we do something different? like what? I don't know, man! i just want to go! I just want to go so far i got to come back just to see where i came from.
LEADMALE:Are you with me? As long as we're back home to relieve the baby-sitter by 9.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, fred.
OTHERMALE:I'm just being silly.
OTHERMALE:Honey, pull the car over.
LEADFEMALE:Why? you getting carsick? No, i only want you to you know, pull over, so we canyou know.
LEADMALE:Oh! What? in the car? You're crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, fred, it will be fun.
OTHERFEMALE:It will be just like high school.
LEADFEMALE:I'll even let you brag to your friends.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, if you wanted to have sex, you should have thought about that before we left the house.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want to have it then.
SUPMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:I'll turn the car around, we'll drive back to our home and our comfortable bed, have the sex, and then go to the bar.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to have the sex in the bed.
LEADFEMALE:There are six rooms in that house.
LEADFEMALE:The only room we have the sex in is the bedroom.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and the only room we cook in is the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Sometimes we barbeque.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really sorry, but i just don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see anything good about having sex in a cramped car.
LEADFEMALE:It's not just the sex, fred.
LEADMALE:Our whole lives are boring.
LEADFEMALE:You're boring! Why, because i don't want to get an ashtray in my butt? Every single thursday night we drive to happy hour and every single time you take kenter to raleigh and a right on radford.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't take sycamore because of the potholes! Okay, i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:We'll take sycamore.
LEADMALE:Woohoo! that's livin'! Hey, dan, where's roseanne? Oh, she was feeling a little nauseous so she filled her purse with chicken wings and went on home.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:I'm glad i came then.
LEADFEMALE:While you two play pool i can sit at the bar and have a drink, because that's what bars are for.
OTHERFEMALE:Bars are for drinking and kitchens are for cooking and cars are for driving.
LEADMALE:That's god's plan.
SUPMALE:You can either stick with that or you can go to hell.
OTHERFEMALE:Grouchy, party of one.
LEADFEMALE:We're kind of having a few problems.
OTHERFEMALE:Yep.
LEADMALE:Should have married yourself a quiet, easy-going gal like i did.
OTHERFEMALE:Driving over here, all of the sudden, out of nowhere she starts blaming me for her life.
LEADMALE:She says it's lousy and predictable, and get this-boring.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, women.
LEADMALE:They just can't say they're happy.
LEADFEMALE:It's got me worried, dan.
LEADMALE:It all started with thisthing.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of thing? This weird sex thing.
LEADFEMALE:Chicken wing? I don't even know how to begin to talk about this.
SUPMALE:I mean, this woman is the mother of my child.
LEADFEMALE:There's hot sauce.
LEADMALE:I am all for having some fun in the bedroom, but what she's talking about, it's-it's bizarre.
SUPMALE:Boy, these must come off tiny chickens.
SUPMALE:Dan is this making you uncomfortable? No, no.
LEADMALE:Speaking in front of a group makes me uncomfortable.
SUPMALE:Listening to your and jackie's sex life makes me wish i was speaking in front of a group.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, what did she want you to do? She wanted us to have sex in the car.
LEADMALE:With how many people? Just me and her.
LEADMALE:She wanted to have sex with her husband in the car? God, it's freaky.
LEADMALE:Someone like that living right here in lanford.
LEADFEMALE:You're making fun of me, dan.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's just if your wife is this unhappy, you got to do something about it.
LEADMALE:Hey, i thought our sex life was great! But apparently she thinks we're in some kind of a rut.
SUPFEMALE:You are in a rut.
SUPFEMALE:We are not! Of course you are.
OTHERMALE:That's why you're happy.
SUPFEMALE:Guys love being in a rut, but women think it's boring.
SUPFEMALE:The trick is to keep them from getting too bored before they leave you.
SUPFEMALE:Then there goes your nice, comfortable rut.
LEADFEMALE:But i don't want to have sex in the car.
SUPMALE:Women like to try new things.
SUPMALE:If you love your wife, you got to give a little.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose doing it in the car is not going to kill me.
LEADFEMALE:Not if you put your flashers on.
LEADMALE:Dan, do you ever have sex with roseanne in your car? Hell, fred, i've had sex with roseanne in your car.
LEADMALE:That's how much i love my wife.
SUPFEMALE:So he just left on his motorcycle.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know why i always end up dating jerks who just care about acting tough.
SUPFEMALE:I just wind up getting burned.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you should start dating more sensitive guys, guys who aren't afraid of showing their emotions.
SUPMALE:Oh, god.
SUPMALE:I said i wouldn't do this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
SUPFEMALE:But guys like that, they just wind up feeling like my brother.
LEADMALE:Or my sister.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, those wussy boys just make me sick.
OTHERMALE:Hey, listen, i've got an extra ticket to the dead concert tonight.
LEADMALE:The chick i was going to go with had to cancel, because she had this, uh she had a baby.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? That would be great.
OTHERMALE:But it gets really hot in the stadium.
OTHERMALE:What do you think i should wear tonight? I don't care, man.
OTHERMALE:Wear whatever you want.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be wearing a tube top.
SUPMALE:Hey, mark, guess what? David's going to take me to the dead show later.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? He must like you.
LEADMALE:Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Quinn is on tonight.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan-aroo.
OTHERMALE:What's the good word? Well, it's not "dan-aroo.
OTHERFEMALE:" david, this came for you in the mail.
LEADMALE:It's my sat scores.
SUPMALE:How come they're already open? Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner made an honest mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:She forgot to reseal it.
LEADFEMALE:How did you do? He did great! Spelling, deciphering, he done whomped all they threw at him.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, not great, but, yeah, i did pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be so modest.
LEADFEMALE:What's the capital of montana? uh, helena? It probably is! Hey, dan, you know, i got that sink practically done in there.
LEADMALE:I was able to save a lot more of that copper tubing than you thought.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You just made us 8 cents.
LEADFEMALE:See us later, egghead.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let it bother you, mark.
SUPFEMALE:He was just all excited about my test scores.
SUPMALE:By tomorrow he'll remember that i mostly just make him uncomfortable.
LEADMALE:Hey, stacy, you know, if you want me to help you with your car, tonight's the only night i have free.
SUPFEMALE:But i'm going to the dead show tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Well, take it or leave it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i really need to get my car fixed.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, david.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, if you want to pick up some beer, i'll hang out afterwards.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:What the hell are you doing? why do you have to ruin this for me? It's not my fault that she likes me more than she likes you.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't give me that.
LEADFEMALE:You just can't stand it that i was getting somewhere with her.
LEADFEMALE:You were just closing in on a handshake.
LEADMALE:God, mark, how evil can you be? Fine, i'll ask you nicely.
LEADFEMALE:I really like stacy.
SUPFEMALE:Okay? now could you please, please as a brother, just back off and give me a chance? No.
SUPMALE:Why are you such a bastard? I'll tell you what, i might leave her alone if you cry for me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hey, what's going on? Nothing.
LEADMALE:No, come on, mark! why don't you tell her what we're fighting about? it's nothing! What did you want? I came by to ask if you wanted to go to a movie tonight.
SUPMALE:Hey, that's a good idea.
SUPMALE:Why don't you go to a movie tonight with your wife? I can't.
SUPFEMALE:I'm busy.
LEADFEMALE:Busy doing what? what? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:What, i have to tell you what i'm doing every second? what is the big deal? why are you acting like this? It's not a big deal.
LEADFEMALE:I just have to fix a car.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Whose car? whose? uh you know, it's, uh what's going on, mark? It's my car.
SUPMALE:Actually, it's a car i'm thinking about buying.
SUPMALE:Mark said he'd come down and take a look at it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, why didn't you just say so? why did you have to be so difficult? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
SUPFEMALE:I guess i'll see you at home, then.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, when it comes to my life, i don't need your help.
LEADMALE:No, i think you do.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you are risking your marriage just to hurt me.
SUPFEMALE:Are you really that jealous of me, mark? I ain't jealous of nobody, especially you.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, let's face it.
SUPMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner is proud of me for something you could never do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what? walk under a table without ducking? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Put me down, take a girl away from me, whatever it takes to make you feel superior.
LEADMALE:Just remember one thing, mark, besides becky, i'm the only person around here that gives a crap about you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:So what time are you going to come by and fix my car? I can't do it.
LEADMALE:You should go to the concert.
LEADMALE:I still don't see why you couldn't just get your wallet in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, honey that's not why i brought you here.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, fred! Oh, god, let's do it someplace bad.
SUPMALE:Real bad! Tables are bad.
SUPFEMALE:Don't i know it.
SUPMALE:I can't wait to get up on top of this table and-it's not too sturdy.
LEADMALE:How about the counter? Oh, the count-oh, the counter is better! You get served quicker there.
LEADFEMALE:Do you need to see a menu or do you already know what you want? what? what? It's kind of dirty.
SUPFEMALE:That's okay, though, because sex is supposed to be dirty.
SUPMALE:You sure there's not, like, a cot in here or something? Fred, i know you're kind of tense about this, but you just have to try and relax because it's supposed to be a fantasy! You tell me what you want to do.
LEADMALE:You don't want to know my fantasy.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, rea-i'm your wife.
LEADFEMALE:We really should talk about this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:You're just going to get mad.
LEADMALE:No, i won't, fred.
SUPMALE:I swear to you.
SUPMALE:Whatever it is, i'm not going to judge you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All my fantasies are you and me at home in bed.
SUPMALE:Really? doing what? What we always do.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, jackie, but that's what i like.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go home, fred.
LEADMALE:You don't mind, do you? No, i don't.
SUPMALE:No, not at all.
SUPMALE:You tried, and that's the important thing.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Oh, man, i thought they'd never leave.
LEADFEMALE:You know, baby, i really missed you since we broke up.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, let's go do it on our table.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i've got a better idea.
LEADMALE:Have you seen the new ice machine? 
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Stacy, uh can't wear that.
OTHERMALE:Have to think of the customers.
LEADMALE:Yeah, she's right.
SUPFEMALE:Stacy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, these are truckers.
LEADMALE:What's with the bra? This isn't for work.
LEADMALE:I have a blind date.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, a blind date.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's such a nice dress.
LEADMALE:I can see you're an outie.
LEADMALE:Can she be anymore annoying? Well, she can dye her hair black and gain 200 pounds.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you find her at all attractive? Nope.
OTHERMALE:Man, am i gay.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, uh, i'm looking for stacy.
OTHERMALE:I'm stacy.
LEADFEMALE:Are you the only stacy who works here? Yeah.
LEADMALE:The one who's got a blind date with a guy named pete? Yeah, that's me.
OTHERMALE:Hey, do you guys sell lottery tickets here? Look, pete, i still have to work for another half an hour.
LEADFEMALE:Would it be okay if i just met you at the club? Oh, sure, sure.
LEADFEMALE:This is the lunchbox on main, right? I'll see you there.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, ma'am, can i help you? Oh, i'm sorry, you work here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I just get so confused 'cause i just see you sitting around everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:I can't go out with that guy.
LEADFEMALE:He's wearing a tie.
LEADMALE:Well, stacy, be optimistic.
OTHERMALE:Maybe he's on trial for something.
SUPMALE:Jackie, will you come dancing with me? I'd feel much better if i had a girlfriend with me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then perhaps you should find one, ms.
LEADFEMALE:Flagler.
SUPMALE:I am running a business here, and the boss-employee relationship is the lynch-pin of that aforementioned enterprise.
SUPMALE:Does lee iacocca go gallivanting around with his mechanics? i don't think so! Jackie, have you seen roseanne? Yes, she is at auntie barbara's, mother.
LEADMALE:Well, why didn't she tell me? I'd have gone with her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i guess she never thought of that.
SUPMALE:Is this your mother? Hi! I'm stacy, the new bus person.
SUPMALE:My, well aren't you a pretty thing, and it's so nice you're not afraid to show everybody.
LEADMALE:Mother, i will tell my employees how they can dress.
LEADMALE:I should have known you'd approve of this.
OTHERFEMALE:It looks like something you might have worn in your wilder days, if you had a bosom.
LEADMALE:Mother, i don't need you harassing the help.
LEADFEMALE:I would never dream of being critical.
LEADMALE:I mean, i hardly know the girl.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps she'll get pregnant on a first date and settle down like you did.
LEADMALE:For heaven's sake, mother! I know why you're saying these things.
SUPMALE:Excuse me? I used to think that people that insulted me were just mean, stupid or horrible, but now i think it's just because they've never had really good sex.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? Well, here's a really good test.
SUPMALE:Have you ever done it and when you were through, your hands were just filled with his hair, but you don't remember pulling it out? jackie, are you going to let her talk to me like this? Well, i'd kinda like to hear the answer to that, mom.
LEADMALE:Well, uhi'm leaving.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to have a respectable conversation with a couple of longshoremen.
LEADMALE:Stacy! i'm sorry! I was just trying to help.
OTHERMALE:Are you mad at me? No, no! come on! The way you just treated my mom, i feel like dancing.
LEADMALE:** hey, this is the life, ain't it? ah? No women around, boobs on a tube and a cold bottle beside ya.
SUPFEMALE:Great job.
SUPFEMALE:You know, a good thing about these blowouts is they show more of the cheerleaders.
LEADMALE:'course, there's no milk in those, but they're fun to look at just the same.
SUPMALE:Are you doing what i think you're doing? Oh, yes, you are! Here's a little something to read.
LEADMALE:D.j. , i don't know if i can go through with this.
OTHERMALE:Look, you don't have a lot of friends so don't cross me.
LEADMALE:Hey, dad! is it alright if george sleeps over tonight? No! You got school tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no we don't.
LEADMALE:It's washington's birthday.
OTHERMALE:Well, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Didn't you just have yesterday off for, whatever they call it, president's day? Yeah, but that was to celebrate all presidents.
LEADMALE:I mean, this is just to celebrate george washington all by himself, right? Uh, yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, ain't that swell.
LEADMALE:So you boys have tomorrow off, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it's great.
SUPMALE:Uh, we gotta go now.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:I want to talk to george now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
OTHERMALE:Hello, george.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you probably studied a lot about washington in school, huh? what was it he said the time he chopped down that cherry tree? i cannot tell a lie? Yeah, that's it.
OTHERMALE:And here he is on the quarter.
LEADFEMALE:And right next to his head, the motto of our proud nation, "in god we trust" do you believe in god, george? Okay, we were lying.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:School's open.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't tell my mom.
SUPMALE:I hate you.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Well, come on, dad, i mean, you have to admit that was a pretty good one.
SUPMALE:We really had you going there.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you sure did have me going.
OTHERFEMALE:And i'll tell you what? No punishment.
LEADMALE:Really? no, but i had you going, didn't i? hey, dan, can i get your opinion on something? do you think it's alright for one spouse to go out for a night of fun without the other spouse? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, if fred wants to play poker on thursday night, you should let him.
LEADFEMALE:It's jackie that wants to go out.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't listening.
LEADFEMALE:What were we talking about? She wants to go out again with stacy like she did last night, and i just don't think doing separate stuff can be healthy for the marriage.
SUPMALE:Dan and roseanne do separate stuff all the time.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't mean that he likes it.
SUPFEMALE:You hate it when roseanne's away from you, don't you, dan? Yes.
LEADMALE:Good effort, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, fred, look, a couple spending time apart is critical for a marriage.
LEADFEMALE:If roseanne didn't go on these periodic trips, i'd only have death to look forward to.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, go dancing with stacy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be in the car.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, dan.
SUPMALE:Ohhe just hates it when we fight before dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Around here, we call that grace.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, jackson! oh, dan! hi! What are you doing here? Well, roseanne's out of town.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. needed help with his homework.
LEADMALE:Voilá! Where's fred? Fred didn't come.
SUPMALE:Oh, i get it.
OTHERFEMALE:This is your girl's night out.
LEADMALE:Yeah, so the hens are going to start with the clucking the girl talk.
SUPMALE:I'll see ya later, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, if you's a-gonna trash men, i got a complaint for ya.
LEADFEMALE:I'm always complimenting that brad at work, but does he ever give me a hug? N-o.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! hey! Dan, this is pete.
SUPMALE:Pete, dan.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Pete goes out with stacy.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:Where is stacey? Well, he goes out without stacy too.
OTHERFEMALE:Where is stacy, anyway? Um, my guess is she's at home.
LEADMALE:She's at home? Oh, drag aw, darn it.
LEADFEMALE:Huge drag jackie, how about a game of pool? No, i don't wanna pete, stay here and guard the stools.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, pool.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, girl talk.
SUPMALE:I broke a nail last week.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you! I know.
LEADMALE:I know what it looks like.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it looks like you're out in a bar with a man.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're just reading that into it, dan.
LEADMALE:Pete is a person who happens to be male and we are in an establishment that happens to serve beverages so, pardon me for being in a building with a human being.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you are definitely in a bar with a man.
OTHERFEMALE:For all i know, he's a good-looking man.
OTHERFEMALE:We are friends who like to go out dancing.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing is going to happen.
LEADMALE:Nothing happened last night.
LEADFEMALE:It's not going to happen tonight.
SUPMALE:Last night? i--you hadn't put that together yet, had you? You gotta to tell fred about this or he'll pick it up on the streets.
OTHERFEMALE:How's that going to happen? I will stand in the street and yell it at your house.
LEADMALE:Dan you're not going to do that.
SUPFEMALE:And why upset fred over nothing? you swear to me that there's nothing going on between you and this guy? Cross my legs and hope to die.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, i believe you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, can i have the winner? Sure, pete.
SUPMALE:Unless i win.
LEADFEMALE:Can't have me! Hi, dan.
LEADMALE:Killing yourself? Hey, fred.
LEADMALE:Didn't expect to see you here.
OTHERFEMALE:Of burnt fat and gristle.
LEADMALE:Turns out it's a lot bigger inside than what we thought.
LEADMALE:I just came by to apologize for the other day.
LEADMALE:You don't have to do that.
SUPFEMALE:No, you were right about jackie going out.
SUPMALE:I have never seen her happier.
LEADMALE:Fred, i really, really don't want to take any credit for that.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, this is cool.
OTHERFEMALE:You got all your screws and your washers separated into these little baby jars.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe i should do this, huh? Well, fred, that's up to you.
SUPMALE:I'm not giving out any more advice.
LEADFEMALE:I was just asking.
LEADFEMALE:No, fred, no more.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not handing out any more free advice, willy-nilly.
OTHERMALE:You figure out the baby jar thing for yourself.
SUPMALE:Ok, dan.
SUPFEMALE:See ya later.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, listen.
LEADMALE:I might be late for your poker game tonight.
SUPMALE:I gotta find a sitter 'cause jackie is having another night out.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, see ya.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, aunt barbara? It's dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Is roseanne there? Roseanne! roseanne! the big lady on the couch! the couch! the couch! the long chair! Okay, i'll wait.
SUPMALE:You know, i don't get why the weatherman always puts up a sun with a big smiley face on it.
LEADMALE:I mean, just 'cause it's sunny doesn't mean you gotta be happy.
LEADMALE:That is the stupidest thing i have ever heard.
SUPMALE:Hey, you're the one who's always so philosophical.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you tell me she wasn't there? what's wrong, man? You're pacing back and forth like a cagedguy.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing, it's just stuff.
LEADMALE:Can we help? No, you must be this big to ride this problem.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Connor, you help us out with problems all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Can't we help you once? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:There's this friend of mine and all signs seem to point to the fact that his wife is maybe, sort of cheating on him.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:See, she claims she was out with this other woman, but it seems as though she was actually with a man and the husband is sitting home all by himself.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, man, mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Connor sucks.
SUPMALE:Mark, no, it's not mrs.
LEADMALE:Connor.
LEADMALE:Come on, dan, away with another woman, husband home alone.
LEADMALE:I'm not stupid.
SUPMALE:Who's the guy? Let's get 'em! mark! Mark, we're not gonna beat anybody up.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, i got you.
SUPFEMALE:You're glad to be rid of her.
LEADMALE:Uh, me too.
LEADFEMALE:She's a mean 'ole bat.
OTHERMALE:You can do way better than her.
LEADMALE:Again, mark, it's not mrs.
LEADMALE:Connor, but i'll be sure to let her know how you feel about her.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Connor, do you want to talk anymore about your friend's problem? No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
OTHERMALE:Mark won't come in.
OTHERMALE:He just heard a fire truck.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:It's just, i don't know what to do here.
SUPMALE:I mean, the wife doesn't have the decency to try to hide it.
LEADFEMALE:It's almost like she's flaunting it.
LEADMALE:Well, if she's not trying to hide it, then my guess is, she wants to get caught.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? Maybe she wants attention.
LEADMALE:It's like when d.j. does something wrong directly in front of you.
SUPMALE:When you yell at him, he still knows you care about him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:That's just what mrs.
LEADMALE:Connor said.
OTHERFEMALE:More often than not, we don't care about the boy.
LEADFEMALE:All i'm saying is is that maybe if your friend paid a little more attention to his wife, then she might just stop doing this stuff and the problems would go away.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, david.
LEADMALE:You're all right.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Connor, don't break up.
OTHERMALE:You guys are like my mom and dad.
LEADMALE:Hey, buddy, glad you could make it.
LEADMALE:Where is everybody? poker is still on, isn't it? Yeah, i told everybody to show up a little late.
SUPMALE:I kinda need to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:Sounds serious.
SUPMALE:Okay there's no easy way to say this, so, uh here.
OTHERFEMALE:What's this? It's the letter i wrote ya.
LEADFEMALE:Uhi figure, you can read it while i'm in the kitchen, get through your emotional stuff and then, if you want to, come on in and play poker.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:You caught jackie with another man.
LEADFEMALE:What is this? It's in the letter.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be in the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a second, dan! Was she kissing him? was he touching her? Dan, you gotta tell me what you saw.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, i'll try to make this quick.
OTHERMALE:Hey, guys! Too late.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, i gotta hear this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, bob, you weren't supposed to show up for another half an hour, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:Not my fault, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I was getting on my wife's nerves.
LEADMALE:Uh, look could you put this beer in the frig, and just give us a sec.
SUPMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:Fred.
LEADMALE:Okay, start at the beginning.
SUPFEMALE:Where did you catch her? It was at the lobo, and i really don't think anything's happened yet.
LEADFEMALE:But, you don't know that.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, anybody want a brewski? No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:What? you don't want a beer? Somebody call the paper.
LEADFEMALE:Dan doesn't want a beer.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, bob.
LEADMALE:I'll take a beer.
OTHERMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:Look, i talked to her about this, and she swears they're just friends.
LEADMALE:Then what the hell is she doing with him? dan-o! Where's your bottle opener? They're twist-offs, bob.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i know, but i got this real delicate skin, and i'm not just saying that.
SUPMALE:The doctor told me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, bob, nobody wants a beer.
SUPMALE:We don't want to hear about your skin.
LEADFEMALE:We just need two minutes alone.
SUPMALE:Can you do that? please? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, dan.
SUPMALE:Just making conversation.
LEADFEMALE:Look, fred, i'm pretty sure it was just a cry for attention.
LEADFEMALE:It was almost, like she wanted to be caught.
LEADMALE:You think that's all it is? I'm pretty sure.
LEADMALE:So, just spend more time with her.
SUPFEMALE:Show her a good time.
LEADFEMALE:Act like you're dating again.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why not? Because i married an adult, dan.
LEADMALE:If she's got a problem, she should tell me.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going to play these stupid high school games.
SUPFEMALE:Marriage is not a game, fred! A game is something fun and you can win.
OTHERMALE:Marriage is a blood sport.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i don't know.
SUPMALE:Maybe you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe i'll just have to do something.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:I really think it'll help.
SUPMALE:Thanks, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You're a good friend.
SUPMALE:Dan! What? I'm lonely.
LEADMALE:My, you are good.
SUPFEMALE:You know don't dance like a guy.
LEADMALE:I mean, obviously you are a guy, so you do dance like a guy.
SUPMALE:But i mean, you dance like a guy who's like a really good dancer who just happens to be a guy.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I guess where'd you learn to dance like that? Oh, out of nowhere.
LEADMALE:I just picked it up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, you don't pick up steps like that from anywhere.
OTHERMALE:No, it's nothing.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that i, uh i used to take ballet.
LEADMALE:Used to what? I took ballet! Well, you know, lots of kid's moms make them take ballet.
LEADMALE:Mom was against it.
LEADMALE:Welllittle kids like to experiment.
LEADMALE:I was 17.
LEADFEMALE:Those rebel teens.
LEADFEMALE:I still go tuesday nights.
LEADMALE:Well--[laughs]-um i have hemorrhoids.
LEADFEMALE:You do? No, i'm just trying to think of something to make you feel better.
LEADFEMALE:You want a beer? Yeah.
SUPMALE:What kind, honey? Uh, just a light.
LEADMALE:What'd you just call me? Oh, i think i said "honey.
LEADFEMALE:" i guess i was being presumptuous, huh? No.
SUPMALE:No, it felt good.
OTHERMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:What the hell am i doing here? jackie? You called me "honey," and i liked it.
LEADMALE:It felt good.
SUPMALE:I mean, it felt more than good.
SUPMALE:It felt right.
LEADFEMALE:Wellgood and right.
LEADFEMALE:Those are good and right, right? I am a married woman.
LEADMALE:I have a child.
SUPMALE:She's not used to the beer.
SUPMALE:I am cheating on my husband.
SUPMALE:Jackie! we haven't even held hands! don't touch me! You and your lively fun self luring me.
LEADMALE:You should be ashamed of yourself.
LEADMALE:We should both be ashamed.
LEADFEMALE:I really have enjoyed your company.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry it couldn't work out.
LEADMALE:All of you! all of you, go home to your husbands! Good, i'm really glad you're here.
LEADMALE:We need to talk.
LEADMALE:Do that you wanna talk? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Here's my phone number.
LEADFEMALE:What is this? I'm leaving.
LEADMALE:What? did you go out with another man tonight? No, i know but i can explain.
LEADFEMALE:That's explanation enough for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Fred, wait wait, now nothing happened.
LEADFEMALE:You broke the rules, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:What rules? The rules of marriage! We both agreed to them.
LEADMALE:You broke them, and now i'm leaving.
LEADMALE:We have to talk about it.
LEADMALE:No! You may have noticed that i was not on tonight's episode.
LEADFEMALE:That's because i'm pregnant, and the doctors ordered me to stay in bed.
SUPMALE:But you needn't worry about me.
OTHERFEMALE:I will be paid.
SUPMALE:Now, we have many younger viewers, and they're probably wondering where babies come from.
OTHERFEMALE:Since i always felt that tv should not only entertain but also educate, i'd like to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:When a woman decides that she's ready to have a baby, she finds herself a man.
OTHERMALE:It could be a limo driver or a bodyguard, it really doesn't matter, as long as he's younger and not in show business.
SUPFEMALE:Now, the man and the woman go off together alone to a place where they can conceive a child.
SUPFEMALE:This place is called a clinic.
OTHERFEMALE:The man is sent to one room and the woman to another.
OTHERMALE:The woman's egg and the man's sperm are put together and manipulated by a laser and 15 doctors.
OTHERMALE:Then, they are placed back in the womb and monitored by ultrasound and hormone therapy until the many experts are sure that conception has occurred.
LEADFEMALE:Now, i know it may be hard for many of your children to picture your own parents doing this, but someday you will understand.
SUPMALE:It is the most beautiful and intimate experience that can be shared by a woman, a man and their fertility expert.
OTHERMALE:I'll be back next week.
SUPFEMALE:Is anyone down there, jackie? This is spooky, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I think there may be rats in here.
SUPMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Tell them their queen has arrived.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think anyone's in here, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Maybe we should've made an appointment.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, if she's such a good fortune teller, she should've known we were coming.
LEADFEMALE:Greetings.
LEADFEMALE:Madame zaftig bids you enter.
LEADMALE:I gotta see this.
OTHERFEMALE:How ya doing? Madame zaftig sees all, hears all, and knows all.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i want to know my future.
OTHERFEMALE:Start with who i'm gonna marry.
OTHERMALE:Is roseanne gonna marry paul mccartney? Of course i am! And every night will be like prince charming and cinderella, and i'll be cinderella.
SUPMALE:I see a man.
LEADFEMALE:The man of your future.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i was a pretty good wrestler in junior high school.
OTHERFEMALE:Coach used to call me "damaging" dan conner.
OTHERFEMALE:God, don't make me listen to that boring story again.
LEADFEMALE:Putting in a bid on a drywall job.
LEADMALE:Great money if i get it.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna get it.
LEADFEMALE:Be a lot of guys bidding.
LEADFEMALE:And they're all better than you, i bet.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i'm pretty good! you are not! yes, i am! You're not, either.
LEADMALE:I am the best! You're the worst.
LEADFEMALE:I am drywall master of the universe! agh! agh! ooh! oh! Look out, ladies and gentlemen.
OTHERMALE:It's a front suplex! no, he's got her over! he's going for it! You think this is a magic kingdom where you just sit up here on your throne.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah! And you think everything gets done by some wonderful wizard.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, poof, the laundry's folded.
LEADFEMALE:Poof, dinner's on the table.
LEADMALE:You want me to fix dinner? I'll fix dinner.
LEADMALE:I'm fixing dinner! Oh, but honey, you just fixed dinner three years ago.
LEADFEMALE:He's bouncing off the ropes! ladies and gentlemen, bar the door! look out! holy cow! He's setting her up for a heart punch.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! It's illegal in 30 states.
LEADMALE:Hey, listen, tell me something, 'cause i gotta know.
LEADMALE:What do you and your fat wife think of my new hat? Just this once.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get out of here.
SUPMALE:Holy cow, ladies and gentlemen! iceman dan conner has gone berserk! He's setting her up.
LEADMALE:He's got her.
LEADFEMALE:One! two! three! Do you quit? One more.
LEADMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:So that's what paul mccartney is gonna look like in 30 years.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, now tell me my whole future.
LEADFEMALE:I want to hear everything.
LEADFEMALE:Your whole future? But you only gave madame zaftig a dollar.
SUPMALE:Well, what did that buy me? I'll show you roseanne, it's my turn.
SUPMALE:I want to know about my future.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Your future's written on the wall.
OTHERMALE:The wall of the boy's room.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, gross.
LEADMALE:I hate boys.
OTHERMALE:That, my dear, will change.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay.
OTHERMALE:How many men did you date before we met? well, do you mean dated at all, or dated seriously? I mean seriously.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i'd have to say just a few.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:It's not that i mind if you slept with a lot of guys.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, slept with well that's not what you asked me.
SUPMALE:No, i guess it wasn't.
LEADMALE:Well, fred, don't worry.
SUPMALE:It's not that many.
LEADMALE:I'd say three a year.
OTHERFEMALE:Since you were, what, 18? Okay, we'll go with that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
SUPMALE:Well, fred, that's not that many.
SUPFEMALE:Three a year for 20 years is 60.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:God.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even know 60 people.
SUPMALE:Well, i didn't know all of them.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, mom and me were just talking.
LEADFEMALE:Just a second, roseanne, there's something i want to tell my mother.
SUPMALE:Mom, i'm pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:I went out with a guy i hardly know.
SUPFEMALE:We had sex for hours, and i got pregnant.
LEADMALE:And i'm not gonna marry him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm keeping the baby, and if it's a girl, i'm naming it gidget.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, jackie? Well, i just wanted to tell you that i've been thinking about it, and i've come to the conclusion that it's never coming out.
SUPMALE:Never.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna be a 70-year old woman carrying a 30-year old baby.
LEADMALE:Jackie, you're only three days overdue.
LEADMALE:I have a three day old child inside of me! look at me! it's huge! Yes, but you have a very pretty face.
OTHERMALE:Eww! look it! What is that? what the--how come it's like that? how, roseanne, how is this gonna come out of this? Relax, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:These have been coming out of those for millions and millions of years.
LEADMALE:Muscles stretch, bones break.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sick of being pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe it's like a turkey.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when this comes out, it's ready.
LEADMALE:Oh, cut it out.
LEADFEMALE:I do.
LEADMALE:By the power vested in me by the state of illinois, i know pronounce you husband and wife.
LEADFEMALE:You may kiss the bride.
LEADMALE:Just let me switch sides, first.
LEADFEMALE:Stop looking, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:This is my future.
LEADFEMALE:I paid for this, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I own your future.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sick of you bossing me around, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Well, i'll give you billy schmitz i.
SUPMALE:D.
SUPMALE:Bracelet if you let me boss you around for the rest of your life.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, this guy is great! all those little irritating things you do, he thinks they're cute! He walked in here and he gave me an ultimatum.
SUPMALE:He told me to quit the force.
LEADMALE:Well, so what? I've been telling you to quit the force since the day you started.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and i've been trying to break up with you, but you won't seem to go away.
SUPFEMALE:Look, becoming a cop is something i worked very, very hard for.
LEADMALE:What would you do if dan just demanded that you give up the house and the job and the kids? I am gonna do exactly what you would do.
LEADMALE:You would never let a man tell you how to run your life.
OTHERMALE:I want somebody who'll love and support me no matter what, just like dan does for you.
SUPFEMALE:Are you insane? do you know how many years i had to put in to dan? you think he came out of a box like that? Now you could put those same years into gary.
OTHERMALE:I'm telling you, he is the perfect guy for you.
SUPMALE:No, roseanne, he's the perfect guy for you.
SUPMALE:You just want him to settle down and take care of your flaky sister so you don't have to worry about her anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's okay, you don't have to worry about her anymore because she's gonna be just fine! This takes a little more effort than a high school romance.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i live with fisher, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so maybe that's your problem.
LEADMALE:Maybe you and fisher spend too much time together.
LEADFEMALE:I never would have moved in with no guy so damn fast.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you wouldn't, but this isn't you, it's me.
SUPMALE:And there's a real easy way to tell us apart.
OTHERFEMALE:You-me.
SUPFEMALE:You.
SUPMALE:Me.
OTHERMALE:What is your problem? You.
SUPFEMALE:You, you are my problem.
LEADMALE:Ah, what'd i do now? Same thing as you always do, roseanne.
SUPMALE:You sit up there on your pedestal? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You act like some big high and mighty self-righteous pedestal type person, and you poo-poo everything in my life.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and you go right for your addictive behavior.
OTHERMALE:'cause you cannot handle conflict.
OTHERFEMALE:That is the whole thing.
LEADMALE:You cannot handle conflict.
SUPMALE:Remember, we saw that whole thing on oprah.
LEADFEMALE:People who cannot handle conflict so right away, they run for the alcohol.
LEADMALE:Well, have another shot of pancake, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Take your best shot.
SUPMALE:Your best shot.
SUPFEMALE:You know that i would just knock your lights out.
SUPMALE:Well, then, go ahead.
OTHERFEMALE:Make my day.
OTHERMALE:Ow! ow! Excuse me? is this like a sex thing? That's it, i'm not making any more calls.
LEADMALE:You do the rest of the family list.
LEADMALE:I can't call people, roseanne! Jackie, dial.
LEADFEMALE:I'm supposed to be in mourning.
SUPMALE:Well, then wear a veil over your face while you do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't-auntie barbara? It's jackie.
SUPMALE:Jackie.
LEADMALE:I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine.
OTHERFEMALE:I have some bad news.
SUPFEMALE:Dad is now with us anymore.
OTHERMALE:I said dad has passed away.
SUPMALE:He's passed away! Dad is gone.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's dead.
SUPFEMALE:He's dead! no, dead! dad! He's fine.
SUPFEMALE:He sends his love.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:I am not doing that again.
LEADFEMALE:You can't make me.
LEADMALE:Well, now, miss harris, you're looking after your nephew, d.j. , huh? Yes, i am his only surviving relative.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, that will speak to him.
LEADMALE:I had to bring him to you, doctor, because d.j. has become so unmanageable lately.
OTHERMALE:Well, why don't we bring d.j. in right now.
LEADFEMALE:Waiting room floor.
LEADMALE:He looks just like his mother.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, d.j. she's not the same.
OTHERFEMALE:They say she's the same, but she's not the same.
LEADMALE:He just repeats that to himself.
LEADMALE:No one knows what it means.
SUPFEMALE:Not the same at all.
LEADMALE:Very different.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now, why don't we start with d.j. 's family? Oh, d.j. 's family was wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:It was happiness times joy plus love.
SUPFEMALE:You stand on the end of the board, i'll jump on it and shoot you in the air, okay? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Ready? Ready.
LEADMALE:Freeze right there! What'd i tell you about killing your brother in the living room? This is a pretty picture.
LEADFEMALE:Is this the one for school? There's daddy, and me, and becky, and you.
LEADFEMALE:Where's darlene? Right there.
LEADFEMALE:That looks like a bunch of flowers.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:That's her grave.
LEADMALE:I just had some questions about god and stuff.
SUPMALE:Well, so why didn't you come to us if you had questions? There's no two better people to answer your questions than me and your dad.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:What religion are we? I have no idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan? Well, my family's pentecostal on my mom's side, baptist on my dad's.
SUPFEMALE:Your mom's mom was lutheran and her dad was jewish.
SUPMALE:So what do we believe? Well we believe in being good, so, basically, we're good people.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but we're not practicing.
SUPMALE:How come we never say grace? Because, d.j. , grace is for those who are thankful.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, d.j. has a new interest, and we're not going to give him a hard time.
LEADMALE:And i think saying grace is a wonderful idea.
LEADMALE:Dan, say grace.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, this involves touching? Oh, lord we thank thee for providing this food which we have gotten from thee.
OTHERFEMALE:Thine chicken is particularly good.
LEADFEMALE:Amen.
SUPMALE:You know, i really liked that.
LEADMALE:I think from now on we need to be as serious about our spiritual fitness as we are about our physical fitness.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm walking you to school today.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, you're not going in that, are you? Oh, no, d.j. i wouldn't do that to you.
SUPFEMALE:But, i would do this.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my, just a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait one minute here.
SUPFEMALE:This is for when i kiss you goodbye.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, this is a very delicate area, but i just have to ask.
OTHERFEMALE:In d.j. 's family, how did they deal with the issue of sex? Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow.
LEADFEMALE:Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop.
LEADFEMALE:Only in the most healthy and appropriate ways.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! mom! mom! Damn.
LEADFEMALE:She hit me! I caught him peeking at me getting dressed.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, i told you to cut that out.
SUPFEMALE:You told me to stop peeking at becky! Well, he's got me there, darlene.
LEADMALE:What's going on? Well, now the little pervert's peeking at me.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Look, it was fun for everybody when he was peeking at becky, but now, someone may get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come here.
SUPMALE:Darlene, go away.
LEADMALE:Darlene called me a "prevert.
OTHERFEMALE:" no, you're not a "prevert," honey.
SUPMALE:You're a pervert.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what are you doing downstairs? what's the matter with your bathroom? Uh, d.j. 's been in there for, like, an hour.
LEADMALE:Boy, he's just like you, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you run a newspaper up to him? He's got the door locked, and it's like the third time today.
SUPMALE:Maybe i oughta go up there.
LEADMALE:Trust me, i don't think this is a time that a boy needs his mother.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? Um, i think i know what she's talking about.
SUPFEMALE:And i think you know what she's talking about if you just think about it for a minute.
LEADMALE:Yeah, d.j. 's finally got a friend that's not imaginary.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't know.
LEADMALE:He could just be brushing his teeth or, you know, uh, maybe he's compulsively washing his hands, or maybe it's something totally harmless, like chronic diarrhea.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me, he goes in that room 'cause it's the only one with a lock on it.
OTHERMALE:And he's in there for, like, an hour at a time.
LEADMALE:Which either means he's really, really good at it, or really, really bad at it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i don't want you to give him any grief about this.
LEADFEMALE:You could traumatize him and turn him into a serial killer, or something.
LEADMALE:Well, don't worry, how much damage could he do with only one free hand? Well, i've got an idea.
SUPMALE:Let's talk about d.
LEADFEMALE:J .
SUPMALE:'s school.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i hear he got caught playing with his instrument in band.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not in band, stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, next subject.
OTHERMALE:Dan how was work? Well, today was a special one for me.
OTHERFEMALE:It was the 179th day in a row where i did exactly the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, d.j. over here is well on his way to shattering that record.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, uh when i was 13, something really embarrassing happened to me.
SUPMALE:You know, i never thought i would get over it.
LEADMALE:What? Well you know, the junior high had a dance, and, uh your grandma had bought me this real pretty white dress and in the middle of the dance, i looked down at the dress, and there was a, uh-very noticeable stain.
OTHERFEMALE:What was it? Well, d.j. , it seems that i was going through what all the girls were going through at a certain age.
LEADFEMALE:I was having my first period.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god! i don't want to hear it! i don't want to hear it! whoa, what's going on? Mom told me a story i don't want to hear anymore! Well, that's no reason for you to go running out of the room screaming like a maniac.
LEADFEMALE:It was about her having her period! As you were.
SUPFEMALE:Was i an accident? No, d.j. , you were a surprise.
LEADMALE:What's the difference? Mmm, well an accident is something that, if you had to do it over again, you wouldn't.
SUPFEMALE:But a surprise is something that you didn't even know you wanted until you got it.
LEADMALE:Was darlene an accident? No, darlene was a disaster.
LEADMALE:Darlene says i'm not gonna be the baby anymore, so nobody's gonna pay any attention to me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'll tell you what, honey.
LEADMALE:How about if we pay lots and lots of attention to you? I'll be happy if you have a baby.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's so sweet.
SUPFEMALE:Finally, i get a chance to kick some butt.
LEADMALE:Well, perhaps his family wasn't completely horrid.
LEADMALE:The problem may have stemmed from some other cause.
OTHERFEMALE:But what, doctor? why is d.j. the way he is? Well, somewhere in his past, something traumatic happened, and d.j. just split with reality.
SUPFEMALE:Some key incident that he cannot remove from his mind.
SUPFEMALE:They say she's the same, but she isn't the same.
LEADFEMALE:If only we could get into his head.
LEADFEMALE:They say she's the same, but she isn't the same.
SUPFEMALE:Um hello? thick thick, medium thick, or thin thick? becky mom, will you help me with my hair? Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Mom and dad, this is mark.
SUPFEMALE:Mark, these are my parents.
LEADMALE:Hi! They say she's the same, but she isn't the same.
LEADMALE:They say she's the same, but she isn't the same.
LEADFEMALE:They say she's the same, but she isn't the same.
LEADMALE:We may never know what that means.
SUPMALE:They say she's the same, but she isn't the same.
OTHERMALE:All right, so, i'll lock up.
OTHERMALE:I just gotta put some more chairs up.
LEADFEMALE:See you later.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye, rob.
LEADMALE:Wow! hi, roseanne! hi! How are you? Hello, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, not june cleaver! wow! Wow, beautiful pearls, june.
LEADMALE:My god, it's lassie's mom! yes! and the "don't eat the daisy's" mom! And the mom from the wonder bread, wonder bra, whatever.
LEADFEMALE:And weezie! I love all you guys.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you're here.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? We're the sitcom mom welcome wagon.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, well, it's been seven years.
LEADFEMALE:What took you so long? We had to make sure you'd last.
LEADMALE:So may families move into our neighborhood, and they're gone in 13 weeks.
SUPFEMALE:I can't tell you what this means to me.
LEADMALE:I'm so honored that you guys like my show.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually, we haven't seen your show.
OTHERFEMALE:But we heard a few things.
OTHERMALE:Elizabeth montgomery was shocked, and she's a witch.
LEADFEMALE:You see, roseanne, we've all worked very hard to promote the image of motherhood.
LEADFEMALE:And if what we've heard about your show is true, well we're about as mad as h-e-double hockey sticks! Excuse my french.
SUPMALE:Well, whatever you heard is a hell of a damn lie.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm afraid you're going to have to prove it, dear.
LEADMALE:Hey, i'm just as wholesome as any of you.
SUPMALE:I ain't the one that named my kid beaver.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm serious, mother.
LEADMALE:Bacon is loaded with sodium, nitrates, grease, and animal fat.
LEADFEMALE:Breakfast! Hey, i thought you had pep squad today.
LEADFEMALE:I'm quitting pep squad.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm quitting school.
LEADFEMALE:I'm never going back again, and if anybody calls me, tell them i'm dead.
OTHERFEMALE:It must be serious.
SUPMALE:She's not taking phone calls.
LEADMALE:Where is she? where is my sister? She went upstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah-ha! I'll nail her on her home turf.
LEADFEMALE:Nah, you're not nailing nobody.
LEADMALE:What happened? This is according to sheryl brewer, whose older sister not only goes to lanford high, but it also on the student council, and had a ringside seat for the event of the century.
LEADMALE:Get to the point, edna.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Well, just as she completes the line, "i'd like to thank the student council for allowing me to speak my mind," it happened.
SUPMALE:What happened? Becky cut the cheese.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now what? Shut up, dan.
LEADFEMALE:What? This isn't funny.
SUPMALE:This is totally serious.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you go upstairs and talk to her? 'cause i figure this is your area of expertise.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell us about this stud we're gonna be meeting tonight.
SUPMALE:Mother, you're not gonna meet him.
LEADMALE:Well, we're gonna be at the bowling alley, and chip's gonna be at the bowling alley.
LEADMALE:We're bound to run into one another.
OTHERMALE:Please don't embarrass me.
SUPFEMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, there's no way we'd embarrass you.
SUPFEMALE:Mom? yeah? If you want it, i still have some birthday money i hid in my closet.
SUPFEMALE:No, you don't, but thanks, anyway.
LEADMALE:I can't handle this.
SUPMALE:I'm outta here.
LEADMALE:No, you're not going any place.
LEADMALE:You're grounded.
LEADMALE:Okay, wait a minute, now.
LEADMALE:I'm grounded for lying to you guys about living with david, right? right! Just like you lied to dad, and said that you didn't know that i was living with him in chicago even though you did, right? excuse me? Oh, you are in so much trouble now.
LEADFEMALE:Ratting out your own mother, there's just, like, there's nothing lower than that.
OTHERMALE:I mean, am i right, dan? is that like-ratting out your mom, that's gotta be the worst, right? I'm going to jackie's.
SUPMALE:What are we gonna do with her? I was thinking, you know, um just in case we decide to, um that it's time for me to, um get some birth control.
LEADFEMALE:Idn't it great, roseanne? that becky has such a wonderful, progressive, open-minded mom that she can talk to about that? Oh, sure! Darlene, you can't just sit there and be kissed.
LEADMALE:You gotta kiss back.
LEADFEMALE:Or you can be the one doing the kissing.
OTHERMALE:But boys don't like that.
LEADMALE:How come? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It's like they think it's their job, or something.
LEADMALE:Well, how do you know when to breathe? You breathe whenever you feel like it.
LEADMALE:So, basically, you just do this? No, no, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:You kind of then you open your mouth a little bit.
LEADMALE:You open your mouth? for what? So you can slip him the tongue.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my! I'm glad i don't stay up past 9:00.
LEADMALE:We moved on up to get away from people like you.
LEADFEMALE:You're supposed to teach your children valuable lessons.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have an episode where your son breaks a window with a baseball and your husband makes him go out and get a job and pay for it? Well, no, we couldn't do an episode like that.
LEADMALE:The network doesn't like it.
SUPFEMALE:Too risky.
LEADMALE:But we did have this one show the network just loved.
OTHERMALE:It was about me finding some old reefer down in the basement.
LEADMALE:Reefer? Ask eddie haskell.
LEADMALE:So, anyway's, i thought it was david's.
LEADFEMALE:You know, that's the guy that's sleeping with my daughter.
LEADMALE:But, anyway, it turns out that it was my old pot so we start smoking it, you know, and roseanne? Mmm.
SUPFEMALE:You are the most wonderful, beautiful, sexy you know, thing.
LEADMALE:I really, really, love you.
LEADFEMALE:What? I thought this stuff would make me feel younger.
LEADMALE:All i feel is old and tired and hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Man, maybe this is how we got fat.
LEADMALE:Nobody loves me.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi, jackie! We thought you went home.
LEADFEMALE:Look at me.
OTHERMALE:I got nothing.
LEADMALE:No boyfriend, no meaningful job, no husband, no family.
LEADMALE:It's just me.
SUPFEMALE:It's just me and my ganja.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you hear that? Sound's like somebody's coming through the front door.
OTHERFEMALE:You're just being all paranoid, dan.
LEADMALE:Ooh, birds, birds, birds! Ooh, don't you hate that when you're stoned? I don't like it anytime.
LEADFEMALE:Now don't tell me you didn't hear that.
SUPMALE:Is this the sink? am i shrinking? mom? The jig is up! D.j. d.j. deeeee jay.
LEADMALE:D.j. d.j. did you ever notice how weird that sounds? D.j. shhhh! Dan, maintain.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want, d.j. ? God, you're right! Forgot my sleeping bag.
SUPFEMALE:Where is it? oh, well, it is out behind the house, you know? past the yard, you know? in that building back there, you know? where your dad always is? with the tools? and a car? Thanks, mom.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god, i'm like the worst mother on the face of the earth.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, i am, dan.
SUPMALE:I don't even know where i sent my kid.
LEADFEMALE:Well, say he falls down, you know, and he breaks one of his organs and he needs a transplant from me, you know, but i can't give him any of my organs, because they're all full of pot! That's not going to happen, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I just know there's just no way i could handle any kind of crisis, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe i could.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, god, i just want our normal lives back.
OTHERFEMALE:Were we ever really stupid enough to enjoy this? Yes, we were, dan.
LEADMALE:But you now, that was a very different time.
LEADMALE:There was a war going on.
LEADMALE:Everything was just a lot more fun.
LEADMALE:Could someone please get me a cold towel.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:We learned our lesson.
LEADMALE:We got the message across.
LEADMALE:Drugs are bad.
LEADFEMALE:Especially really old stuff that's been sitting there awhile.
LEADMALE:But that's the wrong image for a tv mom.
LEADMALE:She's right, you know.
LEADMALE:Once, timmy went off to explore an old, abandoned mine after i had told him not to.
OTHERFEMALE:My husband gave him a good talking to.
LEADFEMALE:Well, see, now that is the difference between us.
LEADFEMALE:In my house, i yell at the kids, and dan is the one whose job it is to just sit there looking pretty.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you're the boss in your own family? Yep.
LEADMALE:And i get all the good jokes, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Pretty sweet, ain't it? On my show, the dog got all the good lines.
LEADFEMALE:I just translated.
SUPMALE:And then they shot me off into outer space, and i had that annoying dr.
OTHERMALE:Smith and that damn robot.
SUPMALE:Well, see, nobody upstages me.
LEADMALE:That's why they call the show roseanne.
LEADMALE:They named the show after you? the wife? I didn't know they could do that.
OTHERMALE:Now, those bastards told me that there were too many letters in june to be on the screen.
SUPFEMALE:It was at that moment i realized i had been ripped off.
SUPFEMALE:I should've been the star of my show.
LEADMALE:I should've had the voiceovers! i still don't like it! You know, in my day, mothers did not have tattoos.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well you obviously never saw harriet nelson naked.
SUPMALE:Anyway's, the important thing is, on my show, i'm the boss, and father knows squat.
LEADMALE:All right, i'll stay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, poor dan.
LEADFEMALE:He has to sit here on the bed with me for two minutes and do nothing while me and god create a life.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe my sperms are just waiting for your egg to shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan, i know that we're both just sick to death of all this lovemaking crap, but we gotta do it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i've been thinking-when this kid graduates high school, i'll be 60.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's one of our kids, dan, so you'll probably be more like 65 or 70.
LEADMALE:Be too old even to play ball with him.
LEADFEMALE:Odds are, half my life's over already.
SUPFEMALE:If this kid has to grow up without a father, is that fair to him? I'm scared, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:This whole thing is making me think about death.
LEADFEMALE:Well, think about whatever you have to, dan.
LEADMALE:We're going again in 20 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Wake up, sleepyhead.
SUPFEMALE:Dan? Hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you feel? how did everything go? Oh, the operation went great.
LEADMALE:The surgeon said it was his best work ever.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to see.
OTHERMALE:I want to see! Okay, there's a mirror over by the wall.
LEADMALE:Let me help you up.
LEADFEMALE:Great, huh? They were supposed to make 'em smaller! This is better.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god! You know, c'mon, dan.
SUPFEMALE:It's been, like, a while.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? I'm not sure this is the right time.
SUPMALE:No, no, it's the perfect time.
SUPMALE:I haven't even made the bed yet.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel kinda weird.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's still me.
SUPMALE:I'm nervous, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Well, don't be.
OTHERMALE:They're higher, now.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, look, it's not that we think anything is wrong with nudity.
OTHERFEMALE:As a matter of fact, me and mr.
SUPMALE:Conner used to have sex that way.
SUPMALE:I feel sorry for you people.
LEADFEMALE:Nudity is our chosen lifestyle.
LEADFEMALE:But you can't help yourselves.
LEADMALE:You're compulsive, sick perverts.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's not that easy not to look.
LEADMALE:Well, i certainly think we can manage.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? what color are my eyes? Oh, my god! run, dear! We're going to plant that hedge, believe me.
LEADFEMALE:And we'll tell all your neighbors just what kind of people you are! well, it's too late! They already know.
LEADFEMALE:Honest to god, this broad was so hot, i thought she was gonna kill me.
LEADMALE:Yeah! Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom.
LEADFEMALE:So then, she brings out this suitcase full of sex toys.
LEADMALE:And i'm thinking, this broad is freaky.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah! Hey, as long as you're getting your battery charged, what's the damn difference? yeah, i mean, while you're getting your car washed, you might as well get the hot wax, right? one thing i want to know is, what does she want with you when she's got a suitcase full of sex toys? that supposed to be a joke? Okay.
OTHERMALE:Ahh! ahh! So, how you doing? Fine.
LEADMALE:You watch that blackhawks game on tv? Nope.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're a bulls fan, 'eh? Oh, i get it! It's like being in an elevator.
LEADMALE:You know, roseanne, we oughta hang out more often.
OTHERMALE:I was thinking that, too, but next time, let's leave the wives at home.
LEADMALE:You read my mind.
SUPFEMALE:Huh? Oh, come on, barbara.
LEADMALE:Wasn't that fun? Yeah, you know, maybe if you would have spoke your mind once in a while, beave wouldn't have had to go get killed in 'nam.
LEADMALE:Oh, that was just a rumor.
SUPFEMALE:Beaver's alive.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, he ain't workin'.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like any of this.
LEADFEMALE:Why, girls kissing girls and foul language? and teenage sex! yeah, i know, that stuff's kinda bad, but you guys wanna hear how much money i make? Oh, my god! why, i'd make out with a chick for that kinda dough! Any one of you, right now.
LEADMALE:All right, well, come on, ladies.
LEADMALE:Let's go toss back a few and raise a little hell.
SUPMALE:Give them something to make a movie of the week about.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call that partridge girl.
LEADFEMALE:She can pick us up on her bus! Ah, screw that.
OTHERMALE:We'll take my limo.
LEADMALE:You have a limo? Yeah! And look what my driver gave me.
SUPMALE:Congratulations! There's nothing wrong with my driving.
OTHERMALE:Uh-huh, right.
SUPFEMALE:That's why you throw me all over the car pumping those brakes.
SUPFEMALE:I pump the brakes to make sure they grab.
SUPFEMALE:Because if they don't grab, i rear-end the guy in front of me, i get a ticket, they raise our insurance premiums we go broke trying to pay 'em, we end up in a poor horse-har-[whinnies wilbur! We end up in a poor house, our children starve.
LEADFEMALE:I pump those brakes to make sure they grab.
SUPMALE:If they don't grab, i rear-end a guy in front of me.
SUPFEMALE:I get a ticket.
LEADMALE:Our insurance premiums go up.
LEADFEMALE:We go broke trying to pay them.
LEADMALE:Our children end up in a poor house, we starve.
LEADFEMALE:That's why i pump the brakes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, just tell me one thing.
SUPMALE:What? why do you pump the brakes? you know, rosie welcome to the tunnel of terror! now, morty, be nice to the people! How do i look? I've got a splitting headache.
SUPMALE:Agh! you tramp! you slut! go away! leave us alone! We are as god made us.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Ugh! david! Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:I know, it's late.
OTHERMALE:I was just down in darlene's room playing monopoly.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right, and i was up here doing sit-ups.
SUPMALE:I'm not lying, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene and i haven't had sex all summer.
SUPMALE:Well, i wouldn't know anything about that, what with being born yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, there's something i have to tell you.
OTHERFEMALE:I love your daughter, but i don't wanna hurt her relationship with you and mr.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:And i plan to marry darlene someday, so if we have to wait for a little while now, it's a small price to pay to be with her forever.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't use lines like that and expect me to think you're not having sex.
LEADMALE:Well, we're not.
SUPFEMALE:I swear.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we still petstop it! Right now, you are grounded for two weeks.
LEADFEMALE:One week for having sex with my daughter, and another week for using the word "pet.
LEADMALE:" d.j. what the hell are you doing up so late? They made me play monopoly.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted to go to bed and get my rest for school.
SUPMALE:You haven't been feeding me a load of the truth, have you? Yeah, i thought that's what you'd like.
SUPMALE:David, obviously you know very little about this family.
SUPFEMALE:We have raised three children without the truth, and we've managed to do very well, thank you, without your consarned, newfangled ways.
SUPMALE:Hey, honey.
SUPFEMALE:David, what are you doing up? Well, uh i heard this noise.
LEADFEMALE:So i came downstairs to see what it was, and it was this huge bird that was caught in the screen door there.
SUPMALE:And i got it out, and then he left.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:See? Gross, oatmeal! I want a bear claw.
OTHERMALE:Well, tough, we don't have any.
OTHERMALE:We're eatin' healthy now, and oatmeal's good for ya.
LEADFEMALE:There's your brown sugar and your syrup.
LEADFEMALE:Since when did this family start eating oatmeal? Well, i'm not having any junk food in the house at all when i'm pregnant this time, 'cause i'm hoping that this one will turn out to be smarter than the other ki-d-s.
OTHERMALE:Is it too much to ask that there be a washcloth in the bathroom in the morning? No, it's not too much to ask.
SUPMALE:It's too much to do.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , why aren't you in the car? We're late.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't eaten my breakfast yet.
LEADMALE:There's tic tacs in the armrest.
LEADFEMALE:Move! What's with him? Oh, he's a great, big, old sugar addict, going through withdrawal.
LEADMALE:So desperate, i caught him out licking a beehive in the yard.
LEADMALE:Good grief.
SUPMALE:Why didn't he just ask for some sugar? Well, he doesn't know that that's what's bothering him.
LEADMALE:He doesn't? No.
LEADFEMALE:He's a man.
LEADFEMALE:He has no insight into why he acts the way he acts.
SUPMALE:He just knows he's mad.
SUPFEMALE:You gonna explain it to him? why should i? He's still taking most of it out on d.j. hey.
SUPFEMALE:Where you two going? I don't have to tell you what i'm doing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in college now.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:I don't own you anymore.
LEADMALE:Where're you two going, david? We're gonna go study in the basement.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, there'll be a little something extra in your paycheck this week.
SUPMALE:I thought they weren't allowed alone together in the basement.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they weren't, but that was before i found out that they're not having sex.
LEADMALE:And it's not like when mom found out that we weren't having sex.
LEADMALE:It's really true.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, it is like when mom found out.
LEADMALE:What? I saw their car parked outside the green lantern motel yesterday.
OTHERMALE:I saw darlene going into one of the rooms.
SUPFEMALE:Was d.j. there with a monopoly board? No.
SUPMALE:Damn them! why did you have to tell me this? Don't get mad at me! I'm just the messenger.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You like some milk in your coffee? You two are having sex.
SUPMALE:We are? david, why didn't you tell me? I'd have put my book down.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i would expect to be lied to by you, young lady.
SUPMALE:But you! I never even saw it coming, with those puppy-dog eyes and that sad clown hair.
LEADFEMALE:What, did d.j. tell you? I don't plan to reveal my source, but suffice it to say, that your car was seen yesterday parked outside of the green lantern motel.
SUPMALE:It was not.
LEADFEMALE:Are you calling jackie a liar? I was at a movie yesterday afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:Don't even start with me.
SUPMALE:We take you into this house and treat you like one of our own kids, and then you turn around and treat us like you're one of our own kids! Mom, leave him alone.
SUPMALE:I was at the motel, but not with david.
LEADFEMALE:Well, did you save your ticket stub, you know, 'cause they're good for free fries at the dairy queen.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing, meeting strange men at motels? No, you have it all wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I meet them at the truck stops, i take them to the motels.
OTHERFEMALE:So who're you meeting? Just this guy from school, jimmy.
OTHERMALE:He came down for a few days and i met him in his room so we could talk.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Yeah, the advantage of talking in a motel is that, what, you can shower afterwards? Look, i didn't want david to find out i was meeting jimmy.
LEADFEMALE:I was trying to be considerate.
LEADFEMALE:God, you are just such a wonderful gal, darlene.
SUPMALE:David is such a lucky fella.
LEADMALE:There's nothing wrong with what i'm doing.
SUPFEMALE:David knows about jimmy.
LEADMALE:What? He's known about it all summer.
LEADMALE:And he's fine with it.
LEADMALE:Oh, he's fine with his girlfriend meeting another guy in a motel? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Cool for me, huh? No, darlene, it isn't cool at all.
SUPMALE:It's cruel and heartless.
LEADMALE:How can you be so insensitive to a tiny, little wuss like david? Hey, i'm okay with it, and so are david and jimmy.
SUPMALE:So why do you have to try and control my life? Because, darlene, i cannot shift the entire balance of nature just to please you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, there's nothing you can do about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, there's plenty i can do about it.
LEADMALE:Like what? Like, no matter what happens, that jimmy kid's not moving in here.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you told me you'd have that truck finished before noon.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you've quite got the hang of this civil service thing.
LEADFEMALE:Finish the truck, then you go to lunch.
LEADMALE:But jackie's coming.
LEADFEMALE:Since the baby, it's hard for us to have lunch as often as we used to.
LEADMALE:And if i don't have lunch now, i'm gonna have to wait till sunday for lunch.
SUPFEMALE:I tell you what, for once, why don't you just act like an employee and do what the boss tells you.
SUPMALE:Guess we won't be having lunch.
OTHERMALE:Now now, jackie.
LEADMALE:Dan? Not now, jackie.
LEADMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Not now, jackie.
LEADMALE:Dan! Not now, jackie.
LEADMALE:I know what's bothering you.
SUPFEMALE:Not now, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, eat a ho ho, would you? what? Roseanne won't tell you, but i will.
LEADFEMALE:You're all testy because you don't have any sugar in your system.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you talking about? I had three donuts when i come in this morning.
LEADFEMALE:You did? so why are you being so short with everybody? I got stuff on my mind.
SUPMALE:Dan, i am your sister-in-law, and i would like to think that if i ever had a problem, that i could come to you.
LEADMALE:You can't.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, i just get the feeling that you wanna talk about it.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, if i tell you anything, you're gonna run to roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not true! No, not if you tell me not to.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna tell you something.
OTHERMALE:And you're gonna think i'm the worst person on the face of the planet.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my god, you're having an affair.
OTHERMALE:No, i'm not having an affair.
LEADMALE:Would i be in my office during lunch if i were having an affair? you have thought about having an affair long enough to know that you would have to do it during lunch? I'm not having an affair.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not thinking about having an affair! I just i'm noti'm not feeling good about having this baby.
SUPFEMALE:That's it? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:My wife is pregnant with my child, and i'm having all these doubts.
SUPFEMALE:That's pretty terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, no, it isn't terrible.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, it's perfectly natural to have doubts.
LEADFEMALE:Not for me.
SUPMALE:I've never felt this way before.
SUPMALE:Dan! You always feel this way.
LEADFEMALE:No, i don't.
LEADMALE:Yes, you do! During every single one of roseanne's pregnancies, you always freak out just like this.
LEADMALE:I do? Yes! You couldn't sleep when she was expecting becky, you had the chronic flop-sweat over darlene, and you were convinced that d.j. was a bad idea.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, that's when he was six.
LEADMALE:You're always a wreck about the pregnancy thing, and then roseanne calms you down, she rubs your head, and she tells you that everything's gonna be all right.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, she does do that, doesn't she? so now don't you feel like everything's gonna be okay? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, thanks, jackie.
LEADMALE:You've actually helped me with my problem.
SUPMALE:Did i really? did i help you? so, what helped you the most? the part where i was really forceful, or the part where i told you how you always are when roseanne is pregnant? Fred, lunch! Hey, don't eat all of that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm saving half of it for jimmy.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, god, david, you're so pathetic.
LEADMALE:Sit down.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, this whole darlene and jimmy thing, i really am cool with it.
LEADMALE:You know, you might not think that you deserve to have darlene all to yourself, but you do, david.
LEADMALE:You're a really great kid.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner i'm willing to do whatever it takes to hold onto darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Even if that means sacrificing my self-respect and every shred of manhood i ever had.
OTHERMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Does this jimmy kid know what he's up against? Honey, i got all kinds of good food for the baby.
SUPMALE:I got oranges, i got grapes, i got raspberries.
LEADFEMALE:You've seen some of this stuff before, on the trix box.
LEADMALE:Why are you in such a good mood? You're not allowed to have sugar, so you better be drunk.
OTHERMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:I've been beating myself up about something all week, and i finally realized that what i need to do is talk to you.
LEADMALE:Yeah? All right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm listening.
LEADFEMALE:Well i been real scared all week.
LEADFEMALE:You know? About the baby.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't get it out of my head that what if it's a huge mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:And i thought we should you know, talk.
LEADFEMALE:Well maybe we should have, you know, talked before we had, you know, sex.
LEADFEMALE:No, see, you're getting mad, and i'm just having my usual doubts about having a baby.
LEADMALE:You know what i'm like.
OTHERMALE:What do you want me to do about it, dan? you want me to get rid of it? I didn't say that.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, this is going all wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Of course it's going all wrong, dan.
LEADMALE:You're not sure you wanna have the baby.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not completely sure, i'mi'm pretty sure i want it.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i'm pretty sure that i'm completely pregnant.
LEADMALE:So you better get completely sure pretty damn quick.
LEADMALE:Thanks, hon, i feel a lot better.
LEADMALE:Don't they have an adult section here or something? This stuff is for 12-year-olds that get knocked up.
OTHERMALE:What are you in such a bad mood about? Well, if you really must know, mike douglas is no longer on the air dan hates the baby, and i suddenly realized i'll never be a ballerina.
LEADMALE:What? dan said he hates the baby? He didn't exactly say that, but he might as well have.
OTHERMALE:He comes home yesterday and starts griping to me about all these fears and doubts he's having.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it.
LEADMALE:You didn't mind comforting him every other time.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, this time's different.
LEADMALE:Why? I don't know, it just is.
SUPMALE:Look at this crap.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna wind up wearing dan's clothes again.
LEADMALE:I don't get it! What is so horrible about dan having a few doubts? Because, jackie, the jerk knew for a whole year that we were trying to have a baby.
SUPMALE:Okay, it's just a little bit too late for him to be having doubts now, isn't it? And besides, i'm having them too.
SUPFEMALE:Really? why? I'm 42 years old.
OTHERMALE:I'm already tired.
LEADFEMALE:What if i don't have the energy to raise this baby right? Well, you never worried about raising them right before.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, but i mean, what if something's wrong with it? I mean, 'cause my eggs are so old.
SUPMALE:And then it ends up with a lifetime of problems and it's all my fault.
LEADMALE:That's just silly.
LEADFEMALE:You had the same worry about d.j. he is a perfectly normal 12-year-old.
LEADMALE:He's 17, jackie.
LEADMALE:We just say he's 12, 'cause we're so damn embarrassed.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just tell dan that you're worried.
LEADMALE:No! I can't be upset if he's upset too.
SUPMALE:He needs me to be all sure, like i was the other three times.
SUPMALE:So i can rub his stupid head and tell him everything's gonna be all right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so what if you've always been the strong one? You have a right to have some doubts.
LEADMALE:I'm sure dan would be very supportive if you just give him a chance.
OTHERMALE:You think so? Yes! Look how good he was when your back went out.
SUPFEMALE:And when dad died.
LEADFEMALE:When you got that really bad haircut.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that was hard on the whole family.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i'll give him a chance.
LEADMALE:Thattagirl.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:And you know, roseanne, one of the magical things about relationships is the way that two people can find strength in being scared together.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you come up with that crap? You said that to me when i was scared to marry fred.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, jackie, this is serious! Darlene, there's something i wanna get off my chest here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, david, a lot of guys have a third nipple.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't make you a freak.
LEADFEMALE:It's jimmy, darlene.
SUPMALE:I wanna talk about jimmy.
LEADMALE:So talk.
LEADFEMALE:What's he look like? David, come on.
OTHERMALE:Is he tall? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Average.
LEADMALE:Is he taller than me? Average would be taller than you, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sleeping with him? No.
LEADMALE:Are you gonna sleep with him? I don'ti don't know, maybe.
LEADMALE:When? David, don't do this.
LEADFEMALE:This is killing me, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:You need to choose.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:No, i'm serious.
OTHERMALE:I mean, i do have an ounce of dignity left.
LEADFEMALE:Who's it gonna be, me or the other guy? The other guy.
OTHERMALE:Or me, that's right, choose.
OTHERFEMALE:I did.
LEADMALE:David, you're so important to me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, were were each other's first love.
OTHERFEMALE:But people who don't explore other relationships end up becoming my parents.
OTHERFEMALE:He can't love you more than i do.
LEADFEMALE:David, stop.
LEADMALE:You know, if you sleep with him and you don't like it, i'll take you back.
SUPMALE:David, please don't say anything else nice to me.
LEADMALE:You know, this is hard for me too.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe i wasted three years of my life with you, you coldhearted bitch.
LEADMALE:Did that make it easier? Oh, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:How you doing? Mmm well, i'm okay, but i thought maybe we should talk.
LEADMALE:Good, good.
SUPMALE:I think we should too.
SUPMALE:Yeah, 'cause there's a lot of stuff i didn't get to say yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, we don't have to argue anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I said a lot of stupid stuff i didn't mean yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Of course i'm not scared about the baby.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:I was completely out of line.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we're having a baby.
LEADMALE:This is great news.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's so sweet, dan.
LEADMALE:I'm so glad that i'm having your kid, and not one of them other guys i'm sleeping with.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we're gonna raise this kid just fine.
SUPMALE:Oh, man, you just have no idea how much this means to me.
LEADMALE:Sometimes i need some support too.
OTHERMALE:Really? Well, you got it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm there 100 percent.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 100 percent behind this.
SUPFEMALE:This is gonna be the best kid yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, so, what was it that changed your mind? Well, you know, your mind has thoughts, and that leads to other thoughts and then you're thinking.
OTHERFEMALE:And pretty soon, you're there and it's great! You're lying to me.
LEADMALE:What do you want me to do? I'm trying to say the right thing here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, saying the right thing doesn't mean anything if you don't mean it.
LEADMALE:Well, i am gonna mean it.
SUPMALE:I'm here to support ya.
OTHERMALE:When you have stuff to talk about, we should talk about it.
LEADMALE:I mean, especially if you have doubts.
SUPMALE:Do you have any, you know, doubts? Come here.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything's gonna be fine, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You really think so? Yeah, sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you and me can handle anything, as long as we just talk these things through.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, makes everybody feel better.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE: hey, i'm home.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene.
SUPMALE:** hello? isn't anybody home? i'm right here! mom? dad? d.j. ! What? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i guess that means i get the tv all to myself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, golf.
LEADMALE:I was watchin' that! Hm, that's odd.
SUPMALE:I'm all alone, yet i distinctly smell foul breath.
SUPFEMALE:That's 'cause i'm right here! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, d.j. i didn't see ya.
LEADFEMALE:But then i do have troll blindness.
LEADMALE:For god's sakes, breathe through your nose.
OTHERMALE:Mom and dad are planning something for you, and i know what it is.
OTHERFEMALE:Oo, must be really important, if they told the dog.
LEADFEMALE:I heard mom and dad talking.
LEADMALE:'cause of the new baby, they're gonna cut your allowance, from $100 a month to 50.
SUPFEMALE:No way! that baby's not gonna cost $50 a month! I mean, it's gonna get all its food free, from elsie in there.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you're nailed.
OTHERMALE:And you can't do anything about it.
SUPMALE:Ha! Oh, d.j. d.j. young, foolish d.j. you see, roseanne and dan are like a vcr.
LEADMALE:They just flash zero until you program them.
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hi, darlene.
OTHERMALE:Welcome home.
SUPFEMALE:Is, uh, dad here? dad! What? Yeah, he's here.
SUPMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:I wanna talk to you guys.
OTHERMALE:Hey, darlene.
SUPMALE:What? Well, actually, we wanna talk to you, too.
SUPMALE:Right, dan? Well, me first.
LEADMALE:Well we shoulda knew somethin' bad like this'd happen, what with her movin' up to the big city.
LEADMALE:Just tell us the boy's name, and i'll get the shotgun, and your maw will rustle up a preacher.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, i've been thinking.
LEADMALE:I know you guys have this new baby on the way, and that's gotta be really expensive.
SUPFEMALE:So i was thinking you could send me less money every month.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you've got to pardon us for being a little shocked.
SUPFEMALE:This is your first act of kindness.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, dan.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:She's always been very generous.
SUPFEMALE:Remember when she called up jerry lewis, and pledged $100,000? So what do you say we cut my allowance fro $100 a month to-oh.
SUPFEMALE:Say-no, no.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna argue about this.
SUPFEMALE:This is what i wanna do.
OTHERFEMALE:That'd be good, but-you know what would be even better--? Now, dan.
LEADFEMALE:This is so sweet of her.
LEADMALE:Well, i just figured the baby needs it more than i do.
SUPMALE:Now what'd you guys wanna ask me? well, um-you know that, uh-berlin wall, comin' down? what was that all about? See ya.
LEADMALE:Like taking candy from two very big babies who really like candy.
OTHERFEMALE:'cept for one thing.
LEADMALE:What? I lied.
LEADFEMALE:They were never gonna cut your money at all.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
SUPMALE:You know what i just said in there? you know, i came in here and i said that? I know.
LEADFEMALE:We can't tell ya how much we appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:But you know, darlene, i'm feeling so, uh-i don't know what it is.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just, uh-oh my god.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of you! I'll be in the basement.
LEADMALE:Plotting d.j. 's death.
LEADFEMALE:She fell right into our trap.
LEADMALE:Yeah, she must be slippin'.
SUPMALE:Yay, it worked.
SUPFEMALE:I did everything you said.
OTHERFEMALE:Now where's my 10 bucks? He fell right into our trap.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, he must be slippin'.
SUPMALE:What a gyp! And you wanted smart kids.
LEADFEMALE:** ha ha ha ha! Come in? Well, someday, maybe they'll invent a receptacle where you can put garbage in.
SUPFEMALE:How are ya doin'? Oh, i'm right where i belong.
LEADMALE:Livin' on failure st.
OTHERMALE:Two blocks south of pathetic.
LEADMALE:My zip code? All zeroes.
LEADMALE:Now don't start that again.
LEADFEMALE:Fred's gonna come back to ya.
SUPMALE:I had dan go over there and talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:And if that doesn't work, then i'll send him back to beat him up.
OTHERMALE:It's not gonna work! Fred left me because i lied to him.
LEADMALE:I went out dancing with another man.
SUPMALE:Well, dancing is not a sin.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't you see footloose? Well, if he just hadn't of gone, then none of this would have happened.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on.
OTHERMALE:When something goes wrong in a marriage, it's never just one partner's fault.
SUPMALE:You can't just blame yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i-i can't blame fred.
SUPMALE:Well, fine! Then blame someone else.
LEADMALE:That's what i do! Just make a list of all your problems.
SUPFEMALE:And then another list of everybody you know.
OTHERFEMALE:And then draw lines.
SUPMALE:There's nobody that i can blame! Well, what about the idiot that narked to fred? We were at the lobo.
OTHERMALE:Half of lanford was there.
LEADFEMALE:That coulda been anybody.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's all the better.
LEADFEMALE:More to choose from.
LEADMALE:You know, mom-did see me and pete at the lunch box.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's perfect.
OTHERMALE:Everyone knows she's pure evil.
LEADMALE:And she gave me one of those looks.
SUPMALE:You know? Like "i'm gonna tell on you!" well, you didn't tell me that you had hard evidence.
LEADMALE:God, i hate that mom! It-you know? I do feel better.
SUPFEMALE:See, i told ya.
LEADFEMALE:So how you need to quit mopin' around and get out there and have some fun.
SUPMALE:Although i wouldn't recommend dancin'.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i-i could take andy to the bulk store.
OTHERFEMALE:Thatta girl! nothing more fun than the bulk store! but-now, see? i don't have any clean clothes! could that somehow be mom's fault? Damn her! Hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Gosh.
LEADFEMALE:I told the agency i wanted a redhead.
SUPFEMALE:Dan.
SUPMALE:What are we doin'? You're checkin' outta here.
LEADMALE:Roseanne was right.
LEADMALE:This crap has gone on long enough.
LEADFEMALE:You're goin' back to your wife and your kid.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Can't.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? You packed my pants.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Dan, i'm not goin' back.
SUPFEMALE:I'm still too angry.
LEADMALE:I know you are, fred.
LEADMALE:But it's just gonna get better.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
SUPMALE:You just bury that anger deep down inside, until it becomes a hard ball in the pit of your stomach.
SUPMALE:And then you put food on it.
LEADMALE:No! I'm staying where i am.
LEADMALE:Damn it, fred! What are you doin' here? I told you to romance her.
OTHERMALE:With the money you spent on this motel, you coulda bought her a-card, or somethin'.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, i see what this is about, okay? You don't have to worry.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne's not gonna know it was you who tipped me off.
OTHERMALE:I told jackie it wasn't you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you don't have to lie for me.
LEADMALE:I'm not afraid of my wife.
LEADMALE:Oh? have you remarried? I'm not afraid because i did nothin' wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not the guy who walked out on his family to punish his wife.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! i'm not punishing her! Jackie is a mess.
SUPFEMALE:And she's sittin' home with a kid who doesn't know what happened to his father.
SUPMALE:What do you call that? what do you want from me, dan? Jackie's the only woman i ever loved! She's the only person i ever trusted, and she betrayed me.
LEADFEMALE:But nothin' happened-something did happen! She went out with another man.
LEADMALE:I'm losin' her.
LEADMALE:I lose her-i lose everything.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to do.
LEADMALE:What can i do? Jeez, fred, i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I just-i need some time to get my head together.
LEADFEMALE:All right, buddy.
LEADMALE:I'll stay with ya for a while.
LEADFEMALE:Fred? does this tv get anything besides adult movies? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, hey, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Did i leave andy's little hat over here? Oh, yeah, well, i'll have to buy you a new one, uh, see, 'cause i ran out of coffee filters.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, have you had a bath? Yeah, i've been getting out, trying to have fun, like you said.
LEADFEMALE:But you still hate mom.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's very invigorating, you know? It's funny.
LEADFEMALE:You hate somebody your whole life, and then you realize there's so much more.
OTHERMALE:Who do we hate? who do we hate? Mom.
OTHERMALE:Oh, good.
SUPFEMALE:I hate bev.
LEADMALE:Can i play? Yeah, we figured out mom told fred about me and pete.
LEADFEMALE:So what do you think we should do to her, dan? Oh, i don't know.
LEADMALE:Who's to say what i think? Well, i got-gymboree starts in an hour.
LEADMALE:I got to get him there, build up his little muscles, 'cause next time he pulls on grandma's earrings, we're gonna do some damage, yes, we are.
LEADMALE:Yes, we are! Oh, she's such a good mother.
LEADMALE:Listen, roseanne, i didn't want to say this in front of jackie, but i'm the one that told fred, not your mom.
SUPFEMALE:Although your mom probably would have if i hadn't.
LEADFEMALE:Man, does she bug me! Well, i should have seen your great-big barbecue-stained fingerprints all over this one.
LEADFEMALE:I was right to do it.
LEADFEMALE:I was right to tell him.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to hear it.
LEADFEMALE:You just go out in the backyard and dig a great-big hole and wait for me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Blame me.
LEADFEMALE:Blame the messenger.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, blame fred, you know, the guy whose wife lied to him? But whatever you do, don't blame the adulteress.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, she's not an adulteress, dan.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to you? You were on her side before you went over there.
LEADMALE:Then i saw how much fred was hurting.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not what happened.
SUPFEMALE:You were in a very small space with another man, and you breathed all those man fumes, and then the very tiny part of your brain that can think for itself dissolved.
SUPMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Hi, becky.
SUPMALE:Did you get me that, uh, catalog i asked you for? Yeah, and that saw that dan would like is right here on this page.
LEADMALE:Yep.
SUPMALE:Whoo.
LEADFEMALE:That's gonna make a great gift.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Now all i need is the picture frame.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, well, why don't you sit down? I'll make you a sandwich, and then we can talk.
LEADMALE:Okay, as long as you keep your promise and we don't talk about jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, didn't she just die? Oh, that jackie.
LEADMALE:Hey, fred.
SUPFEMALE:Heya, mark.
LEADMALE:You here to meet becky? Nah, she's eating with that guy.
SUPMALE:Hey, becky.
SUPMALE:Hey, joe.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Who's joe? Just some guy friend of becky's.
LEADMALE:They go out all the time: lunch, dinner, dancing.
LEADFEMALE:No biggie.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:And that doesn't bug you.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course not, man.
SUPMALE:I'm secure as a man.
OTHERFEMALE:And my male chauvinistic ego doesn't, uh, need, uh, something or other.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that's funny.
LEADFEMALE:I was recently in a very similar situation.
SUPMALE:You were? I had no idea.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:The only thing was that jackie lied to me about her guy friend.
SUPFEMALE:Does becky ever lie to you about this guy? Yeah, of course, all the time.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it'sgood.
LEADMALE:Yeah? how does that make you feel? Uh f-fine.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner! Really? fine? That is so open-minded of you.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it won't bother you to hear that they were holding hands, too.
LEADFEMALE:What? Right up until you came in.
LEADFEMALE:I was a little concerned about it, but i guess i'm not as secure a man as you are.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, get away from my wife, pal.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? were you holding hands with this guy? No.
SUPFEMALE:Well, fred saw you.
SUPMALE:Hey, i told you, if it isn't written on your hand, don't say it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but nobody said nothing about them touching each other.
SUPMALE:Why don't you go stick your head in the freezer? It's going bad.
SUPFEMALE:You think you and jackie are gonna get back together? Roseanne, i can't believe that you think that i was dumb enough to fall for that.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't.
SUPMALE:I am trying to break up becky and mark.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, hello, diner people.
LEADMALE:Hi, bev.
OTHERMALE:I can't talk to bev right now with this jackie thing going on.
LEADMALE:I'll get rid of her.
SUPMALE:Hi, mom.
LEADMALE:Thank god you're here.
LEADMALE:Are you sure that fred wants to talk to me? Yes, absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:I tried to comfort him, but he needs the kind of comforting that only you can give.
LEADMALE:Hello, fred.
LEADMALE:I was so sorry to hear about you and jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are you staying? The green lantern.
SUPMALE:Oh, my.
SUPFEMALE:That place is filthy.
SUPMALE:But then, considering the kind of housekeeper jackie is, i suppose you feel right at home.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I guess.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hey, now's not the time to bring up all of jackie's faults, okay? Next thing i know, you'll start comparing her to, i don't know, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha! And why not? Jackie's father was a cheater, too, and she always took after him.
LEADFEMALE:You know, bev, cheater is probably too strong a word.
LEADMALE:Oh-ho-ho, really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I mean, jackie didn't actually do anything with this guy.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:So there's absolutely no reason at all to bring up all the other men she slept with.
SUPMALE:Oh, why waste the time? The list of men she hasn't slept with is shorter.
LEADMALE:Bev, would you mind not criticizing jackie? After all, she is still my wife.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right, mom.
LEADFEMALE:And she has obviously cut way back on the men ever since she got married.
OTHERMALE:In my day, that woman would become known as a runabout.
SUPFEMALE:She's not a runabout.
SUPFEMALE:Exactly, mom.
LEADMALE:And i don't care if she was wearing charlie-you know, kinda free, kinda wild.
LEADFEMALE:Ohgoodness knows what sort of life jackie's leading.
LEADMALE:If you ask me, you're too good for her.
LEADMALE:Will you get off jackie's case? She just made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you two can sit here and argue about my sister, but i'll be damned if i'm gonna listen to one more minute of it.
LEADMALE:And whatever you do, do not tell fred your theory on how jackie made ends meet that time she was unemployed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Yeah? Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going? We're going to the toy warehouse, and the first toy he finds that he can't break, i'm buying it! No, you got to stay here, 'cause i just left fred with mom, and i think he's caving.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:And so, you know, you got to be here in case he comes by or calls or something, unless mom turns him off women altogether.
SUPFEMALE:I'm--i'm all ready to go.
LEADMALE:Well, come on, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I went to a lot of trouble catching him.
SUPFEMALE:Now you just got to clean and cook him.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but it's just that ever since he left, i've just been enjoying myself.
SUPMALE:What? Well, i'm--i'm sleeping in the middle of the bed, i'm not shaving my legs, and i get to put pretty clothes on andy again, and if he turns out gay, we don't care, because i'll march in one of those parades with him.
LEADMALE:So what about fred? I mean, he's your husband.
LEADMALE:Don't you miss him at all? not even the you know, cute way he does whatever it is that you thought he did cute? It's scary, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I just think that i'm happier without him.
LEADMALE:Well, don't you love him anymore? huh? don't you? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, great.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you better think about this, because he's andy's dad.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I know andy needs him.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, fred.
SUPMALE:Hiya, sport.
LEADFEMALE:How ya doing, buddy? who is that? ha ha ha! Hey, roseanne, can you take andy in the back for a second? Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Can we talk? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I made a mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:I shouldn't have left.
OTHERMALE:You didn't even let me explain.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:You know.
LEADMALE:I just i needed some time to think.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i did, too.
SUPFEMALE:Look, jackie, i know you got some problems with the marriage, and i do, too, but the important thing is, we still love each other, right? Right.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:So where were you two off to? Toy warehouse.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like fun.
OTHERMALE:I'll join you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i don't--ahh let's just-let's just stay in.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, well, i-i better go, 'cause darlene hung d.j. up by his feet, and i want to get some film.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thanks for helping out, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, you know, sometimes you, uh, you go sticking your nose in places where it doesn't belong sothings will turn out like this.
LEADMALE:Dad, we need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:That's what i used to think, but it turns out, son, we don't.
LEADMALE:I mean it.
SUPMALE:I set up darlene so you and mom get to pay her less allowance, but unless you give me i'm gonna tell her.
SUPFEMALE:My, my, what a sly puss.
SUPMALE:Look, she'll start a big fight and ruin her whole time home, and you don't want to start a big fight, do you? Oh, gee, dan, they're so adorable before the horns and the pointed tail grow in.
OTHERMALE:Hey, darlene, come on up here! Why do you want to call her up here? It's the only fun we get since they outlawed cockfighting.
SUPMALE:What? well, uh say, you know that 25 bucks that d.j. scammed you out of? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, that was me and your dad.
OTHERFEMALE:That was our scam.
LEADMALE:We thought of that ourselves.
SUPFEMALE:And d.j. , well, he was nothing but our willing stooge.
LEADFEMALE:So that wasn't your idea at all.
OTHERFEMALE:Nope.
LEADFEMALE:It was all mom and dad.
LEADMALE:You were just playing along.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, that's right.
SUPMALE:You teamed up with them, you little snot factory.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, d.j. , for years, we tried to get darlene to help us scam you, but she'd never do it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she's got principles.
SUPFEMALE:Bad move, d.j. , because they're gonna die way before i do.
LEADMALE:Looks like the two of you got a lot of things to talk over.
LEADMALE:Winner gets this 20.
SUPFEMALE:Someone get a shoebox.
LEADFEMALE:There's gonna be a funeral.
LEADFEMALE:Mom? Have fun, kids.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, i'm scared! Perfectly natural.
LEADMALE:Well, so what? We're reaming the kids together again.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean we're okay? You know, dan, if you weren't around here, i'd really miss you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course.
LEADFEMALE:You'd keep sliding down in the middle where the mattress tips.
LEADMALE:No, i mean it.
LEADFEMALE:Um, i'm really glad that i married you.
OTHERMALE:I know i got me one of the good ones.
LEADFEMALE:Am i dying? Never mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, come here.
SUPFEMALE:What was that for? I don't--you started it.
LEADMALE:Were you holding hands with this guy? No.
SUPMALE:Well, fred saw you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i told you, if it isn't written on your hand, don't say it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but nobody told nothing, uh, about something with them over there.
SUPFEMALE:I told you, if it is not written on your hand, don't say it.
LEADFEMALE:I never knew something was supposed to be about the touches something or other anyway! God, i'm so embarrassing! 
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey! What'd the doctor say? how's the baby? Well, she's doing great, and, uh--pretty weird she's bigger than normal.
SUPFEMALE:Go figure.
SUPMALE:Ha! And they say it's bad to live under power lines.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, first i felt weird for gaining 30 pounds.
SUPMALE:But now i figure most of that weight's the fetus.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Hello, connor baby! oh, man! That's four inches of fightin' fury.
OTHERMALE:Boy, this one really can kick.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yesterday, i got slapped in the head with my own boob.
LEADFEMALE:And we're gonna spoil you rotten, little girl.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, we are! $1,500 in the bank! We can afford to buy you food and water and maybe a shiny new table saw.
OTHERMALE:That's great, dan, except that we owe the doctor $2,000.
OTHERMALE:What? We have to pre-pay the cost of having the baby.
LEADMALE:We didn't have to do that with the first batch.
LEADFEMALE:Well, back then we were broke and the county took care of it.
SUPMALE:That's why those kids were free.
LEADMALE:And apparently, you do get what you pay for.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we brought in all the groceries, but where does everything go? Well, the frozen stuff goes inthe freezer! And the canned stuff goes on the shelf.
LEADMALE:And that about covers it.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, it's gonna be tight.
LEADFEMALE:I wishwe would have invested better.
LEADMALE:Why, oh, why did we stop buying lottery tickets? Mom, dad, we have got some amazing news.
LEADMALE:Mark and i were just looking for apartments, and we found, like, the cutest place to live.
LEADFEMALE:It was available right away, so we just took it.
OTHERFEMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! yes! yes! yes! Of course we'll miss having you around and all.
LEADMALE:Gee, dan, i've never seen you this deliriously unhappy.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's the apartment at? Well, that's the best part.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not an apartment.
LEADFEMALE:It's a chance for us to buy something that's really ours.
SUPMALE:You're buying a house? how can you afford that? Because it's not a house.
SUPMALE:It is a trailer! It is, like, the cutest little trailer you have ever seen.
LEADMALE:Isn't this incredible? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well that's, like, the best news i've heard since you married mark.
LEADFEMALE:** aunt jackie? hmm? didn't you wanna keep this? No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Family things need to be passed down.
LEADMALE:Now that's the chair i was telling you about.
LEADFEMALE:That's one of my favorites, but i want you to have that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why haven't i, like, seen it before? Um oh, itworks in so many different rooms that lately we've just been keeping it in the garage.
OTHERMALE:Don't sit on that! No no, that's more just for looks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's certainly generous of you, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe tomorrow you can bring by your beanless bean-bag chair.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just run that inside for ya.
LEADMALE:Hey, beck, did you see the bathroom door? It slides into the wall! shhhh! Just like star trek.
SUPFEMALE:No way! Aren't you gonna come see it, mom? No, i hate the future.
LEADFEMALE:Man, oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:I'm beat.
LEADFEMALE:Hasn't this just been a great day? you sure are chipper? Yeah, well, you know, that's my way.
OTHERMALE:Your oldest daughter's leaving home.
LEADFEMALE:I just figured you'd be sad.
LEADMALE:Very, very, very, very very sad.
SUPFEMALE:It's not like she's leaving town.
SUPFEMALE:It's like she's gone camping for the rest of her life.
OTHERFEMALE:My turn.
SUPMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Remember our first place? Yeah, that was a dump.
LEADMALE:When are we movin' out of there? My sister is moving into a trailer park.
LEADMALE:I can't tell you where i was the day kennedy was shot, but i will always remember this moment.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think it's so bad, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:I mean it's like they're living in a house it's just got wheels.
LEADFEMALE:It's like living in your car only better, 'cause it's, you know, bigger.
LEADFEMALE:So it's kinda like living in a bus.
SUPMALE:Plus you got the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:So it's kinda like areallynice bus.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, pull the cord.
LEADMALE:I'm getting off.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't make fun of your sister living in a trailer.
LEADFEMALE:If it's good enough for carnival folk, it's good enough for the connors.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! I certainly hope you're gonna clean this mess up when you're done.
LEADMALE:You were afraid there would be no stills nearby.
LEADMALE:So, are you the new owners of this dump? do we look like we're made out of money? We rent.
LEADFEMALE:Where you from? We're from europe.
SUPMALE:Unless you got a problem with that.
LEADMALE:We're the connors.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Connors? did you ever do time at joliet? No, but i've got a question for you.
SUPMALE:Do you ever brush your teeth? Hey, that's personal information, missy.
OTHERFEMALE:We mind our own beeswax around here.
LEADMALE:Well, in that case, i'm not gonna ask if that's your kid sucking on the windex bottle over there.
LEADMALE:Eddie? For god's sake, put that thing down! and you, you stay away fro my husband! Girls let's be neighborly.
LEADMALE:Unless, of course, you wanna swap.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Big hunk o-man.
LEADMALE:Listen, missy! we don't know you and we don't want to know you, and here's why! we're better than you! And we almost never get a chance to say that.
LEADFEMALE:Fine with me, sister! here! It's some coupons and a map to get around the park.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the welcome wagon.
LEADMALE:Welcome, welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you ever feed my dog.
LEADMALE:If i get drunk enough, i'll fight your dog! Man, is she a snob.
OTHERMALE:Come on, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:It won't kill us to help clean the place.
LEADFEMALE:Unless the wind picks up.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, everybody's back in the bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:So you might wanna hang out in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:'cause we don't want the thing to tilt.
SUPFEMALE:Found the perfect spot.
OTHERMALE:I don't know about this, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:I'm a little worried.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be fine, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I told you it was a speed bump you hit, not a cat.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe darlene's right.
LEADFEMALE:Becky doesn't belong in a trailer park.
LEADMALE:Well, we'll have them fix it up, you know? Maybe we can get them a van to use as a guest room.
SUPFEMALE:Becky! mark! They'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Um, your dad and i would like to offer to help you fix this place up a little.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make curtains, and your dad can help you with the plumbing.
LEADFEMALE:And we'll get you a little fence-security system.
LEADMALE:Or at least one of those little signs.
OTHERMALE:Aw, you guys, that's really sweet.
LEADFEMALE:But mark and i don't want any help.
SUPMALE:It's really important for us to do this on our own.
LEADFEMALE:But there's so much to do.
LEADMALE:Yeah but eventually, over the years, it'll all get done.
LEADMALE:Well, you gotta let us give you something.
SUPFEMALE:What about a big-headed banjo-playing boy for the front porch? I said no.
LEADFEMALE:We want to do this ourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Think they're gonna be all right? It could be worse.
LEADMALE:They could be parked on a hill.
SUPMALE:Hey, bob? I need you to put this carburetor back in the garbage truck after lunch.
LEADFEMALE:And be careful.
LEADFEMALE:It took me all morning to get it adjusted right.
LEADMALE:Jeez, dan, i got a big lunch here.
OTHERFEMALE:I was kinda hoping to let it settle for a while.
LEADMALE:Fred, you mind helping him out? No problem.
LEADMALE:Listen, you guys, i need to talk to you about something.
LEADFEMALE:Becky and mark's trailer well, it's kind of a mess, right? And i want to be able to help them out, but they won't let me.
OTHERFEMALE:They probably just want to be alone.
LEADFEMALE:You know the old saying: "when the trailer's rockin'" bob we're talking about my daughter here.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just saying that if it's rockin' you probably wanna level it.
SUPMALE:What are you getting at, dan? Well, i know i'm asking a lot, but here it goes.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna give mark all the overtimefor a while.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I understand.
SUPFEMALE:It's gotta be tough for these kids starting out in life.
SUPFEMALE:If there's anything we can do to make their load a little lighter, it's gonna be our pleasure.
SUPMALE:Give me a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, guys.
SUPMALE:Hey, mark? when you get done with that, can i see you for a second? Oh! Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:There's no work for mark to do around here right now.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? what about the hydraulics on the garbage truck? I took care of it this morning.
LEADFEMALE:What about the school buses? We need them by friday.
LEADMALE:It's all done, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Damn! what the matter with you guys? We work for the city! Don't blame me, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't do squat.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but my daughter's livin' in a big mailbox! There's gotta be somethin' around here that needs fixin'.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i bet the bottom of this here table could use a little paint.
LEADMALE:Woopsie.
SUPFEMALE:Forget about paintin' this table, dan.
LEADFEMALE:What about this carburetor? I think i'll explain this to bob outside.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, dan? Mark.
OTHERFEMALE:Good news.
LEADFEMALE:Got a little overtime for you.
LEADMALE:Look, i can't do any all week.
LEADFEMALE:I got a lot of stuff to do at the new place.
LEADMALE:Exactly! And that time-and-a-half couldn't come at a better time, could it? I'm sorry, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you offer it to one of the other guys? The other guys can't do it, mark.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? Uhgarage quartet's got a gig at the county fair.
SUPFEMALE:Look, dan, it's not like i don't want the money.
SUPMALE:I really can't do any this week.
OTHERMALE:Okay? Dan.
SUPMALE:Weirdest thing.
LEADFEMALE:I just noticed the tail lights are all busted on that cop car out there.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with your foot, man? m-my foot? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:New shoes.
SUPFEMALE:Brad.
SUPFEMALE:Apparently, this week, it's not the right week to paint the table.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? oh? You, uh you might want to talk to bob.
LEADFEMALE:Bob? where's bob? You're not gonna believe this, dan.
LEADMALE:Some clown must've poured sugar in the gas tank of that school bus.
LEADMALE:Bob you--you can't fix somethin' like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are.
OTHERFEMALE:Candles.
SUPMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:Are these the regular kind or the fancy kind that keeps the bugs away? This is a special night.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the first time we're the hosts and you're the guests.
LEADMALE:Look, dan.
OTHERMALE:It's the china we gave 'em for their wedding present.
SUPFEMALE:No, mommy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure the ones we give 'em didn't have these little compartments.
LEADFEMALE:Fancy.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Eat 'em quick.
OTHERFEMALE:In 15 minutes, the bats start comin' around.
OTHERFEMALE:This is great.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it is.
SUPMALE:Good food great setting.
LEADMALE:Makes me wish our kitchen didn't have some stupid house around it.
LEADMALE:Now, before we start mark and i just want to say thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You guys were so great to put us up for so long.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, becky, those three years just flew by.
SUPMALE:We were only there for one.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
SUPMALE:Anyway, so far, setting up house has been a really great experience.
LEADMALE:Well, good.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, i should do my motherly duty and tell you how you can cut down on your food budget.
SUPMALE:Okay, say you get this recipe, you know, and it calls for lobster shrimp, and that expensive cookin' sherry? What you do is you just tear up that recipe.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:We've already figured out a couple of our own budget tricks.
LEADFEMALE:Like, these burgers? Cost 2.
OTHERMALE:79 for a pound of ground beef, but only $1.
OTHERMALE:19 for a pound of ground meat.
LEADFEMALE:You guys got any water? Oh, shoot.
OTHERFEMALE:I forgot to fill up the pitcher.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just run down to the community spigot.
LEADMALE:Your trailer doesn't have running water? Nah, the pipe was broken.
LEADMALE:I'll have enough saved up in a few weeks to buy a new one.
LEADMALE:No big deal.
SUPMALE:Whoa, becky.
OTHERMALE:Don't forget the purification tablets.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Uh where'd you get this salt shaker? Oh, it was in the trailer when we moved in.
OTHERFEMALE:The people before us left it.
LEADFEMALE:Man, that's amazing.
SUPFEMALE:This is not just-a regular salt shaker.
LEADMALE:This is-a niagara falls salt shaker.
LEADMALE:So? I mean, antique stores pay an arm and a leg for this kind of thing.
SUPFEMALE:I should just take it now, and go ahead and give ya wow! okay! And uh, you know, i was noticing your dad was checkin' out that antique hubcap over there.
SUPMALE:Huh? Oh! yeah! Uh-that hubcap.
SUPMALE:That baby there, that's, uh-that's from a 1954, uh fladler.
SUPFEMALE:Uh it's a classic.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see.
SUPMALE:Uh give you, uh ah, well, you know, that's the 1954 price.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta give 'em what it's worth today.
OTHERFEMALE:$60? $70? Hey, becky.
LEADMALE:Why don't you run and get that water? okay! Uh, are you sure it's gonna be okay? i mean, by herself? with the dogs and everything? Yeah, sure.
SUPFEMALE:As long as you bring that big stick, with the long nail in it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look.
LEADMALE:We told you guys.
LEADMALE:We don't want you to give us any money, remember? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, then can't you at least be a little less obvious about it? excuse me? Come on, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Helpin' us out with that overtime thing at the garage, that was good.
LEADFEMALE:But this antique hubcap thing, that's ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well-and besides, we don't need any.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner just made us $50 on that salt shaker.
LEADMALE:Oh, you figured out what we were doin' down at the garage, huh? Come on, dan.
LEADMALE:What do you think i am, stupid? Remember, dan.
LEADMALE:We're guests here.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:Don't tell becky that i told you guys this, but-she feels like, for the past couple years, well, you guys, you've given us a lot.
OTHERMALE:Well, hey.
SUPFEMALE:We're family, you know.
LEADMALE:It's not like we're keeping some running tab of how much you owe us, in our top dresser drawer.
SUPMALE:And you know, with your baby comin' and everything, she feels like she doesn't want to be a drain on you any more.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why don't you just tell us that? Well, uh-see, uh-becky told me that-well, you guys, you-you know, you love her so much that you'd insist on helping, even if-like, you couldn't afford to.
LEADFEMALE:Becky said that? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Got the water! Oh, becky, that's so sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Can't believe how much stuff we're hauling outta here.
OTHERMALE:Remember that hamster you lost when you were 8? I think i found him.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:I always blamed that smell on becky.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he won't be runnin' that wheel any time soon.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it weird to see this place all cleaned out? Like, the only thing left of you girls is that, uh, wrigley field sign up there.
OTHERFEMALE:You get that down for me? Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Seems like the sign's been up there forever.
SUPFEMALE:Hm.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, that gum really holds.
LEADMALE:Man, everything in this house sure is changing.
OTHERMALE:Kinda sad.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, not everything's changing.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we still got your dad, and the furniture, and-d.j. 's haircut.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you okay with this? i mean, another one of your kids movin' out? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i always knew you guys were gonna move out.
LEADMALE:I just-was hoping you wouldn't tell me where you were going.
LEADMALE:Can i ask you somethin', darlene? what? do you ever feel like your dad and me didn't give you enough? what are you talking about? You didn't give us anything.
LEADMALE:No, i'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:You ever resent, like, not havin' a lot of stuff when you were younger? No.
LEADMALE:I used to steal a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys were great parents.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, we did have that one book and all.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you did the best you could.
LEADMALE:I mean-kids are expensive.
LEADFEMALE:Your food budget alone must have gone up by a tenth after you had us.
LEADMALE:Har i'm just worried maybe we didn't give you a good enough head start.
SUPMALE:You know? I always wanted to-have our kids do better than we did.
LEADMALE:And that should have been a realistic goal.
SUPMALE:Becky just-is takin' such a hard road.
LEADFEMALE:Eh, she's gonna be fine.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, she's strong, like you are.
LEADFEMALE:And that'll get her through whatever she has to go through.
LEADMALE:You think? Yeah! Definitely.
OTHERMALE:So what if becky's livin' in a trailer? It's not like she's used to livin' in luxury.
OTHERMALE:You did that much for her! Yeah, it was a crazy plan when we came up with it, but it really worked.
SUPMALE:You know, darlene, me and your dad don't say this to you very often, 'cause, well, it never comes up.
LEADFEMALE:But-we're really proud of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Even though i'm secretly a high-priced call girl? Because you're a high-priced one.
SUPMALE:What the hell.
SUPFEMALE:Put that back up.
SUPMALE:** watch it, buddy! I'm-i'm sorry, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Fishman.
LEADFEMALE:Fired! You sent for me, mr.
OTHERMALE:Fishman? Hey, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Come sit down next to uncle mike.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i had a really good time working on the show this week.
SUPFEMALE:You're sweet, kid.
LEADMALE:You know later this season, the conners are gonna get a french maid.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, i have to see you in the uniform first.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, fishman! i'm not tellin' you again! keep your paws off the guest stars! There's a whole lot of man walkin' out that door right now.
LEADMALE:Stay away.
LEADFEMALE:He'll break your heart.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
OTHERFEMALE:I been there.
OTHERFEMALE:All rightie.
OTHERFEMALE:My husband and i will see you then.
OTHERMALE:You ever done something like this? you and dan ever been to a couples therapist? No, but we did get in a fight at a hockey game one time.
LEADFEMALE:The guy had to separate us.
SUPMALE:I really think this is the best way to fix my marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i really wouldn't know, because in this family we fix our own problems.
OTHERMALE:We use no psychiatrists, no therapists, no educated people of any kind.
LEADFEMALE:How's d.j. doing up there? For a boy going to his first school dance, pretty good.
LEADMALE:I'm letting him use that fancy hair goo that i save for special occasions.
LEADFEMALE:That's called shampoo, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, d.j. 's first date.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:I remember my first date.
LEADFEMALE:I was a freshman in high school.
SUPMALE:Marshall gordon.
LEADMALE:That wasn't his first name.
LEADMALE:That was his job.
SUPFEMALE:He got kicked off the force 'cause of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, well, well, lookie here! that suit looks great! The organ grinder was right.
OTHERFEMALE:How you feel, son? I'm kinda scared.
OTHERMALE:Talk to him, dan.
LEADMALE:There's an extra pork chop in it for you.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to tell him.
OTHERMALE:Well, just tell him the same thing your dad told you on your first date.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Son, if you think of it, bring back a pack of camels.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's pretty much what i expected.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm d.j. 's mom.
LEADMALE:I'm lisa.
LEADMALE:Nice to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, doofus.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:We have lots of little funny nicknames for each other.
LEADFEMALE:What do you call her? Uh lisa.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:It's a flower.
LEADMALE:Look at my dress.
LEADMALE:Are there any colors that come close to going with a blue flower? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry doesn't cut it.
SUPMALE:You get your money back for it, and give that to me.
LEADFEMALE:All right, well, let me take a picture of you two in case d.j. don't make it back.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:I'm your date, d.j. i'm not just some kid you're hanging out with.
OTHERMALE:Put your arm around me.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, smile real big, d.j. i want to see them teeth.
OTHERMALE:After all, this is the first picture i've taken of you since they came in.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Now, who's driving us? David is.
OTHERFEMALE:You david? No, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:I mean no.
LEADFEMALE:David! Well, lisa, while we're waiting for david to come in, sit down, tell us a little about yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm in all the honor classes, and i'm president of the student council.
OTHERFEMALE:I also play the clarinet, and i was just elected to be in the all-county band.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that is very impressive.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, d.j. can make a spoon stick to his forehead.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you guys ready? Nice meeting everybody.
LEADMALE:Man, who gets drunk and cuts this family's hair? Don't just stand there.
SUPMALE:Open the door for me like a gentleman.
LEADMALE:Can you sit up in the front seat with me? Dad, i'm still kind of scared.
SUPMALE:Train's pulling out, doofus! Coming.
SUPMALE:What was that? I don't know.
SUPMALE:But the dark prince takes many forms.
SUPMALE:I like her.
LEADMALE:** what are you doing? Eating my asparagus.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:You're just biting their heads off.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't like the bottom part.
SUPFEMALE:I don't remember asking.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , you eat whatever you want.
OTHERMALE:Hey, stay out of it, dan.
LEADMALE:I agree with her.
OTHERMALE:Why do you have a plate of half-eaten asparagus? 'cause we don't have a dog? Vegetables are very important, dan.
SUPFEMALE:If they weren't, we wouldn't be havin' 'em once a week.
OTHERMALE:Yes'm.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:This is cool.
LEADFEMALE:I never played doubles before.
SUPFEMALE:So did you ask your folks yet? Uh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, he may marry you.
LEADFEMALE:My family's goin' camping at the lake this weekend, and i want d.j. to come with us.
SUPMALE:My mom said it was okay.
LEADMALE:Well, then it's okay with us.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't there someone else you should be asking about this? Oh.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:So, you wanna go, right? Yeah! Cool.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, if you start sittin' around the campfire and tellin' scary stories, change our names.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, i'm serious about this.
SUPMALE:Oh! Yeah, all right.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we'll talk.
OTHERMALE:Uh, see, you don't wanna take all the fight out of your guy.
SUPMALE:You want him to still be able to bark at strangers.
LEADMALE:Gotcha.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, d.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go for a walk.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, l.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:There is no way i'm lettin' my son go to the lake with that girl.
OTHERMALE:Why not? Because she pushes him around.
LEADFEMALE:She's a bully.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:What, so now pushing people around makes you a bully? Roseanne, if this was one of our girls, and some boy was treatin' her this bad, you'd tear that guy apart.
OTHERMALE:This is completely different, dan.
OTHERMALE:A boy starts life way up here on a throne, and a girl is down here.
SUPMALE:So if a boy's pushin' a girl around, he's tryin' to keep her down.
SUPMALE:But if a girl's pushin' a boy around, she's tryin' to elevate herself.
LEADMALE:Can't ya see that? boys bullyin' girls is a step backwards, but girls bullyin' boys? Now that's the future.
SUPMALE:Hey, did you guys decide about the lake thing? 'cause lisa wants to know now.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm against it.
SUPMALE:Your mom's for it-oh, boy! i'm gonna go get my sleeping bag! Hm.
SUPMALE:So that's what a wombat looks like.
SUPFEMALE:I really don't see why we have to be here.
SUPMALE:Because you need help with your anger, fred.
OTHERMALE:Anyone who's had as much therapy as i have knows that.
LEADFEMALE:What anger? The anger that you take and mash down and mash down until it's all buried deep down inside you, just all mashed! I don't have any mashed anger.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ho, ho, ho, okay! Well, i'm sure sorry about that.
LEADMALE:But hey, there are plenty of fish in the sea, huh? buh-bye! uh, jackie and fred? That's us! All right.
SUPMALE:Come on in.
SUPMALE:I'm dr.
LEADFEMALE:Whitman.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's silly.
OTHERFEMALE:Obviously, i'm dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Whitman.
SUPMALE:I'm the only one here, and the sign says dr.
LEADFEMALE:Whitman, sothat's me! Okay, come on.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Can i get you something to drink? you thirsty? Um, no.
LEADMALE:Are you cold? are you warm? I could open a window.
OTHERMALE:But-that's right.
LEADFEMALE:I can't open a window.
LEADMALE:In my old office, i could open a window.
LEADFEMALE:But this office, i can't open the window.
LEADMALE:The window doesn't open at all.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just-i used to-i just moved.
LEADMALE:This is new.
SUPMALE:So, uh-that's why i'm still saying "i could open a window".
SUPMALE:But i can't, so-listen to me, babbling on and on and on.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i guess if you get warm, i could break a window! Oh, i'm just kiddin' about breakin' a window.
SUPMALE:Anyhoo, um-if it's okay with you, i would like to record the session.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:That's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Kinda like to play the tapes for my friends.
SUPMALE:Just kidding.
LEADMALE:Kidding again.
LEADMALE:Okey-dokey.
LEADMALE:Why don't we get started with, uh, each of you stating what you think the problems with the marriage are.
OTHERMALE:Umfred? I don't know what to say.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, see.
LEADFEMALE:That's a-think i-discussed that with you over the phone.
SUPFEMALE:Put down your shield, fred.
LEADMALE:We are your friends.
LEADFEMALE:Did that sound hostile at all? No, i thought that was very well said.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:'cause sometimes i can get started, and then i "woo!" all right.
OTHERMALE:Back to you, fred.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess-apparently, jackie and i could have some kind of communication problem.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Anything else? Nope.
LEADMALE:Uh-uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, um-not gonna need two tapes on you, am i, slugger? Okay, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think the problems are? Uh, not much.
LEADFEMALE:I would have to say, i guess, that, um, it does bother me a little bit that fred always likes things to be the same.
LEADMALE:Good! Good.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, fred, would you like-but it's all things.
LEADFEMALE:All the time.
LEADFEMALE:Always the same.
LEADMALE:Always.
SUPMALE:You know.
SUPFEMALE:Everything we do.
SUPMALE:Everything we eat.
LEADFEMALE:Every tv show that we watch.
SUPFEMALE:Has to be the same.
LEADFEMALE:No change! No.
LEADFEMALE:Can't be variety.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Has to be same same same same same same-till you just wanna-strap him on the back of the car, and drag him around for a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:Ya know? Because at least that would be different.
SUPMALE:That would be something new.
LEADMALE:But what really bothers me is this man's-this fred's calm, polite, "i'm not a bit angry, i'm just sitting here on the couch "with my legs crossed, wearing this shirt" crap! When anybody can see that inside, the man is seething with rage.
SUPFEMALE:Fred? well? Gee.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Um-do you think there's something wrong with this shirt? Ohoh, my.
LEADMALE:What? Oh my oh my oh my.
LEADFEMALE:What, you think he's hopeless, doctor? No, the tape wasn't recording the entire time.
LEADFEMALE:Stupid, stupid-oh.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Now, would you mind starting again? well, from-? The beginning.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Something about fred, wanting things "same same same!" you know.
SUPFEMALE:"rage!" something about dragging me from the back of the car? Oh! oh! oh! Fred spoke.
LEADMALE:Ha ha! Or i think that was you, fred, wasn't it? 'cause i wouldn't recognize his voice.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:There we go, and we're back.
SUPMALE:Uh, it's just like, maybe in the morning, like you just say "pass the toast" so fred just sat there in the office like a deer caught in the headlights.
LEADMALE:I love that look on a man.
LEADMALE:Even if fred did clam up, at least i got a couple things off my chest.
SUPFEMALE:This tea feels good.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know why my throat's so raw! What are you two doin' home in the middle of the day? I just picked d.j. up at the bus depot.
SUPMALE:Why, wasn't there enough droolin' freaks around here to keep ya happy? It seems him and lisa skipped school today, and took the bus to downtown chicago, and didn't have enough money to get back.
SUPFEMALE:What? you went to chicago? Yep.
SUPMALE:And the bus company let 'em ride back free, them made 'em wait at the station, while they called me away from work to come pick 'em up.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i didn't wanna go! lisa made me! whaddaya mean, she "made" you? She made me! i mean, you see her! you know how she is! well, you've seen me, and you know how i am, too! now you go in there and kiss that tv goodbye! can't believe that kid! I gotta get back to work.
LEADMALE:Hey hey hey! I could use a little help here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! a man, helping a woman out? that's a step backwards! but you cleanin' up your own mess? That's the future! All right, let's get this over with.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. ! hi, mom! Son, i am going to punish you so hard that they're gonna throw a benefit concert for you.
LEADMALE:What are you gonna do to me? Well, i don't know that yet.
LEADFEMALE:But i do know it starts with this.
LEADMALE:Go to your room.
SUPFEMALE:For how long? Bring a shaver.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so mad at him-well, of course you are! D.j. did something terrible.
LEADFEMALE:You have to punish him.
SUPFEMALE:Not him, idiot! dan! I hate it when he's right.
LEADMALE:Now he's gonna think he can give his opinion over every little major thing.
LEADMALE:I can't believe that little girl was manipulative enough to get d.j. to go to chicago.
LEADFEMALE:Man, she is a natural.
LEADFEMALE:She's obviously been married before.
LEADMALE:Well-can't blame the whole thing on her, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I mean-did you ever think that d.j. might be mimicking what he sees around here? The way little lisa bosses d.j. around is exactly the way that you boss dan around.
LEADFEMALE:I don't boss dan around.
OTHERFEMALE:I am trying to put him in touch with his submissive side.
LEADMALE:Roseanne! Admit it.
LEADFEMALE:You're bossy! Bossy.
LEADMALE:Is a farmer who turns a pig into a glazed ham bossy? I am not saying that you and dan don't respect each other.
LEADFEMALE:I am just saying that, as an objective third party, i see how it can appear.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, d.j. 's smart enough to know that things aren't always the way they look.
LEADFEMALE:He isn't stupid, jackie.
SUPMALE:Even though he did wear his shoes on the wrong feet for 3 years.
LEADMALE:What? Oh, i'm just waiting to hear you say "you might be right, jackie.
LEADMALE:" yeah? I'm waitin' for chocolate air.
LEADMALE:Where you goin'? I'm going to go show d.j. what terrible things could happen to him in a great big city like chicago.
LEADMALE:Don't you think that you and dan should talk to him? why? what do i need dan for? roseanne, have you been listening? Well, i was listening! but then i stopped talking, and it all got really boring! hey! Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doin'? Me and andy are goin' to the park.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:You mind delayin' the park a little? I'd like to talk.
LEADMALE:Oh, now you wanna talk.
LEADMALE:When it's free.
LEADFEMALE:When it's $90 an hour, you're a block of wood.
OTHERMALE:Well, i wanted to talk about our therapy session.
LEADFEMALE:See, after the ringing in my ears stopped, i thought that you probably had a point.
LEADFEMALE:Really.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i am angry.
LEADMALE:I mean, i was really hurt that you went out with this pete guy-oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:That reminds me.
LEADFEMALE:I got to pick up more salt for that wound.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie.
OTHERMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:Don't get defensive on me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm tryin' to say that-i was partly to blame for it.
LEADMALE:Obviously, you weren't gettin' what you needed at home.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah.
SUPMALE:That was part of it.
LEADFEMALE:And i realized something else, too.
SUPFEMALE:What? We're very different people.
SUPFEMALE:See, that's what i've been saying.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't realize it until now, but we barely knew each other when we got married.
LEADFEMALE:I know! We only had a couple of dates.
OTHERFEMALE:And the baby.
SUPMALE:I know it sounds kind of boring, jackie, but i'm a homebody.
SUPFEMALE:I really like just having a beer, watching tv, and then going to bed.
OTHERFEMALE:And i need more than that.
LEADFEMALE:I need more excitement.
LEADFEMALE:To live on the edge more.
OTHERFEMALE:I need to let the gas go below a quarter of a tank.
LEADFEMALE:And i am the kind of guy that could never do that.
LEADMALE:I'm also the kind of guy that's gotta tell you, that is so bad for your car! I guess you didn't realize you were gettin' somebody so uptight, huh? No.
SUPFEMALE:I guess-you didn't realize you were marrying somebody so neurotic.
SUPFEMALE:Guess not.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we've got-one thing in common.
LEADMALE:We both got married too fast, to people-who aren't what we expected.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:So guess i'll take him to the park.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:You wanna come? Yeah! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! I got a great idea.
SUPMALE:This time we'll do something different.
LEADMALE:We'll go to a different park.
SUPFEMALE:I know it.
LEADMALE:It's got swings.
LEADFEMALE:Small bites at first, fred.
LEADMALE:Don't gobble.
SUPMALE:Small bites.
LEADMALE:D.j. , what are you doing? Gettin' a head start on my punishment.
SUPMALE:Well, dan, that explains those mints on our pillow.
SUPMALE:Turn it off, son.
LEADFEMALE:We need to talk to you.
LEADMALE:It's about lisa.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:See? We think we figured out why you picked her for your girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't pick her! she picked me! What your mom means is, we know why you keep going out with her.
SUPFEMALE:'cause she tells me to! oh-i wanna like this girl! Is something wrong? Yeah, there is.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't treat you very good, deej.
OTHERFEMALE:And we think you're okay with that because you think-that's the way your mom treats me.
LEADMALE:But you got it all wrong.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:See, me and your dad, we totally respect each other.
SUPMALE:We're exactly equal in this house.
LEADMALE:And you know why? Because that's the way i want it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, sure, it may look like she runs things around here.
SUPFEMALE:But-there's a million ways i get my own way around here.
LEADMALE:Like what? Give him an example.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay! Heh.
LEADMALE:Last month, your mom wanted to tune up the truck.
LEADMALE:But that's something i like to do! So i said, "no way!" yeah.
LEADMALE:And giving in feels so good when you love someone.
SUPMALE:Point is, son, you can't let yourself get pushed around.
SUPMALE:So i should only like girls who are wimpy? No, exactly the opposite.
OTHERFEMALE:You should like a girl who's tough enough to know what she wants, but-yet soft enough to know how to get it.
LEADMALE:And she should have a very wealthy father with an enlarged heart.
SUPMALE:See, deej, a strong woman-is a joy forever.
LEADFEMALE:But you always have to be a very strong man.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I think i got it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, you said the same thing about long division.
SUPMALE:Okay, i was going out with lisa because i thought the lady should boss the man around.
SUPFEMALE:But that's wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody should boss anybody around.
LEADMALE:Bingo! you pass! we're proud of ya! We sure are.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean i get to go to the lake with lisa? No, that means you're grounded! But your dad and i are gonna go, and we're gonna send you a postcard.
LEADMALE:I hate this! We make a heck of a couple.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, skip it, dan.
SUPMALE:The kid left the room.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:I heard you in there, talkin' about why you're goin' out with lisa.
LEADMALE:So? So i thought you were goin' out with her 'cause she slips you the tongue.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:But i'm not gonna tell them that! Where's d.j. ? He out back, cleaning dog doo off my shoes.
LEADMALE:Coulda stepped around it, but i wasn't in the mood.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, lisa.
LEADMALE:I think you're really mistreating d.j. do you have any idea the amount of crap i gotta take at school for bein' d.j. 's girlfriend? Then why don't you just break up with him, then? 'cause he does do one thing very well.
LEADMALE:If you know what i mean.
LEADMALE:Oh, god hey, deej! Whaddaya say we show david what makes me-stick around? No.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna see this.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's okay.
SUPMALE:God, i love this man!
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE: darlene, is there more juice? Yeah, but it's frozen and it's on a stick.
LEADMALE:All right, who's freezing bees? I am.
LEADFEMALE:Quick question, freak boy.
LEADFEMALE:Why? So i could thaw 'em out.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't they come thawed out? Yeah, but see, if you freeze a bee, then use a magnifying glass to thaw it out, it'll come back to life.
LEADMALE:Is that really true? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:He was wrong about that nail through the worm thing.
LEADMALE:It's true.
LEADFEMALE:Just thaw 'em out and they fly away.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, d.j. that's impossible.
LEADMALE:No it's not.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, i'll show you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh my god, he's actually gonna unfreeze a bee! D.j. is gonna take something that's dead and bring it back to life.
OTHERFEMALE:That's like playing god! I'm sure god was thrilled by that comparison.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, nice.
SUPMALE:We haven't cooked out in a long time.
LEADMALE:It just takes a minute.
LEADMALE:I feel like there ought to be spooky music playing.
SUPMALE:Please, please be a killer bee.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just zap it in the microwave? Tried that.
SUPFEMALE:Blew up.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Bringing a bee back to life.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:You know, deej, bees are really intelligent creatures, and they're amazingly devoted.
LEADMALE:I read someplace where if you kill one then the whole hive comes and finds your scent and kills you.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, his scent tends to kill them.
LEADFEMALE:See, see, look.
LEADFEMALE:Oh my god, darlene, look! It's a miracle.
LEADFEMALE:The bee's alive! Truly he is the son of god.
LEADFEMALE:See, i told you i could do it! Look, he's getting ready to take off.
OTHERFEMALE:There he goes! Now if you bring that one back, i'll be real impressed.
SUPFEMALE:** so, you guys want to toe tag? When i started watching the trial i was certain, and now i'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's no doubt in my mind, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:F.
SUPMALE:Lee bailey's definitely drunk.
SUPMALE:Has "bored to death" ever actually happened? Don't' pretend like you're not into it, darlene.
OTHERMALE:Why else did you go get that marcia clark haircut? jackie, if you can tear yourself away, you want to go see a movie with me? No way.
LEADMALE:I've followed this from the beginning.
LEADMALE:I know the second i leave it's finally gonna start getting interesting.
SUPFEMALE:All right, mom, i'll go with you.
SUPMALE:But this time i pay and let you in the exit door.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Going would just mean having to take a shower and put on underwear.
LEADMALE:Go ask david.
LEADFEMALE:Too much history there.
LEADMALE:It'd be weird.
LEADMALE:You live for weird.
SUPMALE:Darlene, go with david.
SUPFEMALE:My biggest regret is i lost touch with the guys i dated.
SUPMALE:Doesn't the health department keep them records? I just don't think david and i can have a friendly relationship.
LEADFEMALE:Well then, you know, you're throwing away something good.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i always stayed friends with all the men i was with after the sex stopped.
OTHERMALE:Your father, for example.
SUPMALE:Well, i'd like to be friends with him, but i just don't know that it's possible.
SUPFEMALE:Anything is possible, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:For example, last week i, by myself, refilled the ice trays.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, lighten up.
LEADFEMALE:She's gotta be comfortable with it.
SUPFEMALE:Take your time.
LEADFEMALE:Many people have tried to push me into doing-david! On the other hand, darlene, you're not getting any younger.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? oh, sidebar, huh? Uh, hey, david.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:You want to go to a movie? don't you think that'd be a little uncomfortable? could you two drama queens just get over it? do you have any feelings left for david? No.
SUPFEMALE:And do you have any feelings left for darlene? Well, i respect her as a person-blah, blah, blah.
LEADMALE:Okay, so it's just a movie.
OTHERFEMALE:You can go.
LEADMALE:It doesn't mean nothing.
LEADMALE:If it's okay with you, it's okay with me.
LEADMALE:Okay, let's go.
OTHERMALE:Now remember, no expectations, no attachments.
LEADMALE:Just a couple of buddies hanging out.
LEADFEMALE:They're gonna get back together.
OTHERMALE:I'm so amazing.
SUPFEMALE:I ever get up off this couch, i'll be unstoppable.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hey, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doin'? I'm borrowing dan's long needle nose pliers.
SUPMALE:He said they were in this drawer.
LEADMALE:Well, you don't live here anymore and you got to knock before you come in.
LEADMALE:What if you came in here and i was naked and i was using them needle nose pliers? i'm doing something for becky, okay? Well, becky doesn't live here anymore either.
LEADFEMALE:You gotta knock before you just come in here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! were you ever planning on letting me in? Oh, it's you! Well, it's really rude to show up places unannounced, you know.
LEADMALE:Why don't you go over to your house and call me up on the phone and then maybe i'll let you in.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:I didn't know we were having waffles.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's life in the conner household.
SUPMALE:One unexpected surprise after another.
LEADMALE:So you and david got in pretty late last night, huh? you waited up for me? No, i didn't wait up for you.
SUPMALE:I waited up for david.
LEADMALE:In case you didn't know, he scrapes my feet at night.
LEADMALE:So where did you go after the movie? We got a bite to eat.
SUPFEMALE:And? And he had a burger.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah? It was a little dry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, spill it, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Don't think of me as being your mom.
SUPFEMALE:Think of me as like one of your girlfriends at school.
LEADMALE:In that case, i should tell you that all the other girls always make fun of your clothes.
SUPMALE:Spill it, darlene, or i'm gonna make you go with me to see the movie nell.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:David and i had a good time and i'll deny saying this later, but i'm glad you got us to go out.
SUPMALE:That's it? yeah, i mean it was just real comfortable and natural, you know? The guys i go out with at school, they always try to say something really witty and they expect me to applaud or something.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, your dad looks at me that way whenever he picks the right vowel on wheel of fortune.
LEADMALE:You know, i kind of got the feeling that david might want to get back together.
LEADFEMALE:Really? what about you? Well, i wouldn't mind getting back together either.
SUPFEMALE:I think that's great, darlene.
LEADMALE:I'm really happy for you.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, mom.
SUPMALE:And thanks for butting in.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, this time i hope you guys stay together 'cause you know this is getting tough on me.
LEADFEMALE:Next time i'm just gonna use duct tape.
OTHERMALE:Morning.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, don't hang that up.
SUPMALE:I'm expecting a call.
LEADMALE:You know, david, if you're not busy tonight, i'm really in the mood for some yahtzee.
LEADFEMALE:I was kind of hoping on going out tonight.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? what, you and darlene gonna go see another movie? uh, yeah, why don't we? Uh, no.
LEADMALE:Actually, i have a date.
SUPMALE:Well, david, a date is an easy thing to break, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Uh i could do it for you.
SUPFEMALE:It'd be fun.
SUPMALE:What's the little bitch's name? I am not breaking this date.
LEADMALE:I've been trying to get this girl to go out with me for months.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's cool.
SUPMALE:I got to study anyway.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, could you recommend a good restaurant i could take my date to? I'm not your pimp, david! whoa! That smells well, it doesn't smell good, but it sure is big.
LEADMALE:Just the way you like it.
OTHERFEMALE:What's in there anyway? Meat, vegetables, cheese, fruit-i don't know.
LEADMALE:Something wrong, honey? darlene still loves david, okay? So i got 'em to go to this movie together and now david's got a date with some other girl and darlene's really upset and i feel like it's my fault and i don't know what to do about it.
LEADMALE:Well, call me when dinner's ready.
SUPFEMALE:If you leave this room now, you're having seconds.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you always need me to tell you not to get involved right before you get involved? does it help psych you up? does it make it extra fun? so i shouldn't get involved? i should just leave it to god whether they get back together? Yeah.
SUPMALE:But he has so much, dan, and all i have is this kind of thing.
LEADFEMALE:And the diner.
OTHERMALE:Did you ever think that maybe it'd be better if they didn't get together? I mean, david's doing great, and darlene's doing big things in chicago.
SUPMALE:Maybe she shouldn't be tied down to someone here in lanford.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, maybe i shouldn't be either.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you so intent on getting them together? 'cause i love my daughter and i love david.
SUPFEMALE:No new people! Look, i hate to say this, but if david's dating other people, he's probably not interested in darlene.
LEADMALE:Oh yeah? david, come in here! What are you doing? I'm going to find out whether he loves her or not.
LEADMALE:And if he does, then i'm gonna make him get back together.
LEADMALE:And if he doesn't? Hey.
SUPMALE:So, david.
SUPMALE:Uh this girl you're going out with tonight, you like her? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:That's nice.
LEADMALE:You like her more than you like say, me? Just answer the question, son.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not really a fair comparison.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good point.
LEADFEMALE:What would be a fair comparison? Oh, i know.
SUPFEMALE:Do you like her more than you like darlene? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Is that painful subject? Sort of.
LEADMALE:Why, david, because you think maybe there's a lot of unfinished business? what are you getting at? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just talking about your new girl.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, you're not.
OTHERFEMALE:You're talking darlene.
LEADMALE:See, i wonder why you keep bringing her up.
SUPFEMALE:I don't.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, it's okay if you don't want to talk about this, david, but you really don't have to start playing all these head games with me.
LEADMALE:Okay, i see what this about now.
LEADFEMALE:Look, if darlene thinks i want to get back together with her or something, i don't.
OTHERFEMALE:God, we broke up almost a year ago.
LEADFEMALE:I'm over it now.
LEADMALE:See, i told you.
LEADMALE:He loves her.
LEADMALE:Where did you get that from? Well, it's so obvious.
LEADMALE:Didn't you see the big moony look on his face when he started talking about her? That's the same look you get every year when the mcrib comes back.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Big date tonight, huh? are you wearing cologne? No, i just ate a cough drop.
SUPMALE:Ah, nice.
SUPFEMALE:So, i had fun last night.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i love crappy movies like that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me too.
SUPFEMALE:And dinner afterwards was fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i liked my burger.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Meat is some crazy stuff, huh? what's going on, darlene? Nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:I just well, i suppose that if i had something to tell you and it was really important, that now would probably be the right time.
SUPMALE:Yeah? No, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I guess i should have been more creative with my time.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when i take my spine to the shop i always get a loaner.
SUPMALE:Look, i just changed my mind, all right? Oh, that's such bull, darlene.
LEADMALE:You know you love him.
OTHERFEMALE:So go in there, take a deep breath, and say all those things to him that you used to say to that scott baio poster.
OTHERMALE:Okay, you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:David's all i ever think about.
LEADFEMALE:I can't stand us being apart.
LEADFEMALE:Damn this lousy war.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he likes you.
SUPFEMALE:He does? how do you know? Uh, because posing as a person who cares for him and feeds him, i slowly earned his trust.
OTHERFEMALE:And he said he still likes me? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, he didn't exactly use those words, but he was fidgety and he couldn't look me in the eye, so he might as well of said it like that.
OTHERMALE:What exactly did he say? That he didn't like you.
OTHERMALE:Well, gosh, i guess i better go back on the pill.
LEADMALE:No, trust me.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me on this, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:The guy is nuts about you, but he's not gonna tell you.
LEADMALE:You're the one that's gonna have to stick her neck out here.
LEADFEMALE:Why me? Because he's a guy.
SUPMALE:See, and guys can't talk about their feelings that much.
LEADFEMALE:That part of their brain is totally undeveloped.
SUPMALE:There's mostly just like a big pocket of fat in there to keep the head from laying over to one side.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i can't tell him either.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you can.
OTHERFEMALE:You can tell him you like him, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Or you can do what your dad did to me-punch him in the arm and run away.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:You're scared.
SUPMALE:I don't believe it.
OTHERFEMALE:Here i thought you were a big strong brave woman that could handle anything and you're sitting here scared to death of little kenny g.
LEADFEMALE:That's not it.
LEADMALE:It's just well i know that david is the one that i really want.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i wanted the buy-in bag to carry those foot-long hot dogs, darlene, but i never spoke up.
LEADFEMALE:The result? Unhappiness.
LEADMALE:I've dated a lot of guys at school, and they all suck.
SUPMALE:If i go in there and he rejects me, i just don't think i could take that.
SUPMALE:I don't see any reason why he would reject you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, i do, but he's not as perceptive as me.
LEADMALE:God, i'd reject me if i was him.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i dumped him and i hurt him really badly.
SUPFEMALE:I really messed this whole thing up and it's all my fault.
LEADFEMALE:I just please don't make me go in there and find out.
LEADFEMALE:All right, i'm not gonna make you do anything that you don't want to do.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not gonna even mention it again.
SUPMALE:Appreciate it.
LEADMALE:Yep.
SUPMALE:'course you know if you don't go after him, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
LEADFEMALE:You promised.
LEADMALE:I know, dear, but i lied.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, mother.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, i guess you made your final decision.
OTHERMALE:So all that's left now is just to find a comfortable chair and pick a liquor.
OTHERMALE:I'm putting on my coat.
SUPMALE:You know, i almost let your dad get away from me once.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Uh it was in high school and we had this big fight.
SUPFEMALE:And i told him that i hated his guts, you know, so started seeing this cheerleader.
LEADFEMALE:And they were like all over each other.
LEADMALE:And then, one time after a big football game, he was standing there with all of his friends and i had to force myself to go up to him and tell him i was sorry and that i wanted him back.
SUPMALE:Wow, that must have been really hard.
LEADFEMALE:All right, i'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:David, just shut up and listen for a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I need a pencil.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, look.
SUPMALE:I still have a lot of feelings for you, david.
LEADMALE:And i want us to get back together, okay? So, i guess i kind of love you.
LEADMALE:But you probably don't love me anymore and i don't blame you after the way i treated you, but i had to tell you because i think it would be stupid for me not to tell you when there's a chance that we might get back together.
LEADMALE:I just don't want to get hurt.
SUPFEMALE:I won't hurt you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:So, are we back together again? Yep.
SUPMALE:Except i have that date tonight.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a movie.
LEADMALE:I should be back by 11.
SUPFEMALE:We can start going out then, okay? Okay, fine.
SUPFEMALE:I was just wondering.
LEADMALE:How do you plan on seeing a movie with two forks stuck in your eye sockets? Or, you know, i could stay in tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you know, if you and me ever team up phew.
LEADFEMALE:Cheerleader, my ass.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm, man.
SUPFEMALE:Not only does o.
LEADMALE:J.
OTHERFEMALE:Have the best lawyers money can buy, he's got the best witnesses money can buy too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you're marcia clark! What are you doing here? Well, i just wanted to come by and thank you for all the support you've given over the past few months.
SUPFEMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:I think you're great.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you've got kids, working 16 hours a day i mean, where do you find the time? I'm a single mom.
LEADFEMALE:I make time.
SUPFEMALE:While i'm doing laundry, i go over d.
SUPMALE:N.
OTHERFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:Evidence.
LEADMALE:While i'm making sandwiches for the kids, i look for baloney the defense is throwing at me.
SUPFEMALE:And today, while i'm grilling kato kaelin in front of an audience of millions, i'm cleaning my oven.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when do you sleep? Whenever f.
OTHERFEMALE:Lee bailey opens his mouth.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't believe how great you are.
LEADMALE:I mean, to be able to keep your sense of humor with all you're going through.
LEADFEMALE:And your horrible ex-husband trying to take your kids away.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know how the ex-husband stuff goes.
LEADMALE:Yeah, tell me about it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i should be getting back.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, take a load off.
SUPFEMALE:Let me cut you off a slice of cheese.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Where'd you get that big bloody knife? oh, this? Well, last summer when i was visiting darlene up in chicago, i found it in this big field right by the airport.
SUPFEMALE:Could i borrow that? Sure.
LEADMALE:Okay, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I think it'll come in handy.
LEADMALE:Bye now.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Hey, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for coming.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, dad? why did you call us? We just got back from the doctor's, and i wanted to talk about your mom and the baby.
LEADMALE:Something wrong? No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:I bet she's gonna do one of those home birth deals, and we all have to watch.
SUPMALE:No, it's not that.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just that roseanne is pregnant.
LEADMALE:Dan, we knew that.
LEADMALE:Yeah, maybe the doctor didn't, though.
SUPMALE:You know, maybe, uh, he thought she was just, you knowbig.
LEADFEMALE:No, see, the problem is roseanne is still pregnant, and she will be for another couple of months when the hell are we gonna get a gun? And she's not real happy about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, beck those cinder blocks behind our trailer, they ain't gonna stack themselves, so-yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Now, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner is going through something called "nesting.
OTHERFEMALE:" see, pregnant women always want to make their homes as comfortable as possible for the new baby.
LEADFEMALE:All right, i got jobs for you people.
SUPMALE:Do what you're told, you won't get hurt.
SUPMALE:Though in mrs.
LEADMALE:Connor's case, her role is mostly supervisory.
SUPFEMALE:See, we need to fix this place up for the new baby.
LEADMALE:It's a pig sty, and this baby is used to four-star accommodations.
SUPMALE:You've done a great job at keeping it up, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, i want fresh flowers in every window.
LEADFEMALE:Mark, that's for you.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, what kind of flowers? Green on one end and colored on the other.
OTHERMALE:Need new shelf paper.
OTHERMALE:Becky, you're really good at not dropping stuff, so that's yours.
LEADFEMALE:Vacuuming and dusting, that's dj.
SUPMALE:Ah, man! Why me? Because i don't care about vacuuming and dusting.
SUPMALE:And then we need some healthy stuff around here.
LEADMALE:Fruits and vegetables.
SUPMALE:Jackie, that's for you.
SUPMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, you might as well pick me up some instructions on how to cook those things.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, then i want the whole place to smell better-dan.
SUPMALE:David.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, i guess maybe i could simmer a little spring-rain potpourri in a diffuser.
SUPFEMALE:Okey-dokey.
LEADMALE:Dad, you got a registered letter.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
OTHERMALE:No, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Not any bad news.
LEADFEMALE:Not now.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:This is a very bad time for bad news.
OTHERFEMALE:We can open this later.
LEADMALE:It's probably just my seed catalog.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, hon, you were, uh, giving out instructions? Give me that.
SUPMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
OTHERMALE:Oh, whatever it is, baby, we can get through it together, or i could bear the brunt of it.
LEADMALE:We've been picked to be a nielsen family.
LEADMALE:Oh, roseanne! Oh, that's so much power.
SUPMALE:Oh, it is, man, and i am ready for it, too, i'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:Two weeks from now, you're gonna see bryant gumbel spinning plates in vegas.
LEADMALE:All righty, mr.
LEADFEMALE:And mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, you are all hooked up.
LEADFEMALE:As of this moment, you are officially a nielsen family.
LEADMALE:Do you hear that, dan? We are smack-dab in the white-hot center of show biz.
LEADMALE:Hold me.
SUPFEMALE:For the next year, that box will monitor everything your family watches.
SUPFEMALE:And your viewing habits will effect the lives of millions of other people.
SUPFEMALE:Man, this must be what it feels like to vote.
LEADMALE:Now, i just want to verify some of the answers you put here on your questionnaire.
LEADMALE:I see that you both graduated from high school, but did either of you go to college? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, but we did egg a college once.
OTHERFEMALE:And your children? Sat in the car.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just i see two of them are at least 18.
OTHERFEMALE:Did they graduate high school? Nope.
SUPMALE:David graduated.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but he's not our kid.
LEADMALE:He lives in the basement.
LEADMALE:Came with the house.
LEADFEMALE:Why you gotta ask all this stuff? Well, the advertisers not only like to know how many people watch certain programs, but also what type of people they are.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh, and, uh, what type of people are we? Oh, you're a fine, fine type of people, like many of the people from this type of neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:Large households, modest income, required education only.
LEADFEMALE:Are you calling us stupid? Dan, he's calling us stupid.
SUPMALE:He is? Uh, n-no.
LEADMALE:We don't think of any of our viewers as stupid.
LEADMALE:Really, uh, look, if there's a problem, we can just call this off.
LEADFEMALE:Honey? No, i wanna be a nielsen family.
LEADMALE:Our whole lives have been building towards this.
OTHERMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:Thank you so much for participating.
LEADMALE:If you have any questions, there's an 800 number behind the box.
LEADMALE:That means the call is free.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we know what it means.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, just go on doing what you're doing.
SUPFEMALE:Watch tv like you always do.
LEADFEMALE:Huh, if that means "all the time," consider it done.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Hot dog! Time to down a sixer and help shape the culture of america.
LEADFEMALE:Do you believe that, dan? They think we're dumb hicks.
OTHERFEMALE:They just wanna hook up some poor, uneducated slobs, so the country has somebody to blame america's funniest home videos on.
LEADFEMALE:So what? they're paying us see that little box there, dan? That there nielsen box is a conspiracy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's what you said when they added blue diamonds to lucky charms.
LEADMALE:No, see, they wanna make sure that people like us watch crap like tractor pulls and jerry springer, you know, so the advertisers can sell us all this stuff that we don't really need.
LEADFEMALE:And then they take our money, and they give it to these right-wing washington politicians that cut school lunches and all these other budget cuts, you know, to make sure that people like us have no choice but to stay people like us.
SUPMALE:And who the hell wants to be us? can we still watch montel? No.
SUPMALE:We are not gonna watch nothin' but pbs and the discovery channel and that other smart crap.
LEADFEMALE:We'll show them.
SUPFEMALE:I understand, uh, they've got news on everyday at six.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you what, five bucks on the winner.
LEADMALE:** i don't like to bet on these things.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:It'll make it more interesting.
SUPMALE:Okay, i'll take the big one.
SUPFEMALE:Sucker.
LEADFEMALE:A wolf fighting a moose? That's no contest.
SUPFEMALE:How come we're not watching the bulls? I told you he was a sucker for the nature programs.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, roseanne, the guys are gonna be over here soon and they all wanna watch the playoffs.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? This is sudden death.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't just stand there.
LEADMALE:Fight back.
LEADMALE:Keep your head down.
SUPFEMALE:Use your antlers for god's sake.
LEADMALE:Oh! it's protecting its young! Fixed.
OTHERFEMALE:This idiot! Stupidest moose in north america.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:He's dead.
OTHERMALE:Now can we turn on the game? or do we still have to impress this nielsen guy? Hey, it's not just for him, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I want a better environment for our kid.
SUPFEMALE:Look at the other three kids we got off of watching wrestlemania.
LEADMALE:Do we really have anything to lose? Fine.
OTHERMALE:When the kid's six, we'll start watching the brainy crap.
LEADFEMALE:I happen to know that kids five and under enjoy the same programs as me.
SUPMALE:No, dan.
LEADMALE:Oh your lips say no, but your eyes, they say-how about that? Your eyes say no, too.
SUPMALE:If you want to watch the game, go over to fred's, but don't blame me if we grow apart intellectually.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Won't be as much fun as watching with you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll try to get by.
LEADMALE:I would rather not have dan and his friends over at my house.
LEADFEMALE:Why? You don't have to worry about dan.
OTHERMALE:He just got a new flea and tick collar, and he just got wormed.
LEADMALE:Not me, it's fred.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, fred, fred, fred.
LEADFEMALE:You know how he can be.
SUPMALE:Or do you have to spend understand what i mean? you know, i guess that honeymoon just never ended for you two, did it? Just doesn't want a bunch of people in his house touching his things, you know, moving something from here to there.
LEADFEMALE:Talked about it in therapy.
SUPFEMALE:It's one of his issues.
LEADFEMALE:That's the way it is with men, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:They have that outer child.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call the guys from fred's.
SUPMALE:Enjoy yourselves, ladies.
OTHERMALE:I'm off to spend time with a dumb tv.
SUPFEMALE:You can't go.
LEADMALE:Why not? They've renamed all the streets.
SUPFEMALE:You'll never find it.
LEADMALE:I think what jackie's trying to say is that she would rather be hung up and bled like a hog than have you in her house.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Michael jordan's back in basketball, but william f.
SUPMALE:Buckley is live from yale.
SUPMALE:Don't even think about it, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm quicker than i look.
SUPMALE:Let's play keep way, kind of like with mom and her midol.
SUPMALE:Oh! oh! So much for that family of kittens.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:It's a surprise visit from your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Are you shocked? Well, my pulse just dropped severely, and all my systems have started to shut down, so yeah, i think that is shock.
OTHERMALE:I was doing a little redecorating, digging through some old things, and i thought perhaps you might like to have your old baby quilt.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Well, actually, though, that's the quilt the dog died on.
LEADMALE:Hello, ladies.
OTHERMALE:Beverly.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm gonna fix the couch.
OTHERMALE:When i get done, it'll be as good as new.
SUPMALE:This couch is pretty old and ratty.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just throw it out? Well, around here we don't throw things out just 'cause they're old and ratty.
OTHERFEMALE:And i mean, hell, they can be old and ratty and annoying, and we still keep them around.
LEADMALE:Oh, i see.
OTHERMALE:Well, perhaps i should just go.
LEADFEMALE:You know, since i'm redecorating, i was gonna offer you my old sofa.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that would be great.
LEADFEMALE:But maybe i shouldn't.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps that's the kind of thing you find annoying.
SUPMALE:You're not annoying, mom, when you're giving us stuff.
OTHERMALE:Rosie, can i talk to you in the kitchen? No.
SUPMALE:I don't remember telling you you could talk to me in the living room.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse us, bev.
SUPMALE:If you don't want it, i'll donate it to my theater group.
LEADMALE:They're doing fiddler.
SUPMALE:We are not taking her couch.
OTHERFEMALE:I can just as easily fix ours.
OTHERMALE:But she's right, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Our couch is ugly, and i want our baby to grow up in a nice house, or at least our house with nice stuff in it, or at least our house with crappy stuff in it and one nice couch.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you do this every time we have a new baby.
LEADFEMALE:With becky, you wanted new wallpaper.
SUPMALE:Darlene, you wanted to get rid of the carpeting.
LEADMALE:With dj, you wanted to get rid of darlene.
LEADMALE:See? And i'm always right.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to take this couch and be more indebted to bev.
OTHERMALE:It's bad enough we took that 10,000 from her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:That was over three years ago.
SUPFEMALE:She has eaten dinner here at least five times since then, and one of them times was shrimp, so she owes us.
SUPMALE:Okay, mom, i vacuumed the whole house.
SUPMALE:Can i eat at ralph's now? No, we're all gonna eat in the living room like a family.
SUPFEMALE:And look what we're having-peanut butter and bacon.
SUPFEMALE:Are we watching pbs again? Yeah, but they have a show on tonight that the whole family can enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:It's a documentary on beer making.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna watch that.
LEADMALE:It's in english.
LEADMALE:You're making me hate tv! hey! don't you ever say that, not even in jest! All right.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:But don't blame me if later in your life you cannot tell the difference between hops and malt.
LEADMALE:Uh, mom's not coming over with the couch, is she? No.
LEADMALE:She won't ride in the back of the truck, and dan won't let her sit on all his maps.
OTHERMALE:Just in case she does come over, don't tell her about me and fred being in therapy.
LEADMALE:You don't have to worry about it, jackie.
SUPMALE:I already told her.
LEADMALE:How is that therapy going, anyway? I'm sick of it.
SUPFEMALE:It's all this talk about feelings and boundaries and validations.
SUPFEMALE:Last week we learned that fred needs me to wash the dishes before they go in the dishwasher, because his sister threw his tricycle in the gully.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why don't you give yourself a break? You know, just forget about therapy and all your problems, and go home and fix some romantic type of dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I'm telling you, it really works.
LEADFEMALE:It works for me and dan.
LEADMALE:There is not a man alive who won't fall madly in love with you after a fried bologna sandwich.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, we got it! Okay, so where do you want it? Um, let's see.
SUPMALE:Balanced on the banister? No, in the same place the other couch was.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it looks great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and it's surprisingly comfortable for something made entirely of lead.
OTHERFEMALE:I gotta get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:My back's killing me from carrying that ugly thing.
LEADMALE:That's what we said when you used to live here.
LEADMALE:You know what? I'm gonna take off.
OTHERMALE:I am gonna go give that romantic dinner idea a try.
OTHERMALE:Good for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Any suggestions on what i should wear? weren't you listening when i told you? Fried bologna.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like everyone's gone.
SUPMALE:Just me and you and information about pilsners.
OTHERMALE:Come join me, my pet.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you sure were right about this couch.
SUPFEMALE:It's comfy.
LEADFEMALE:It's good lookin'.
LEADFEMALE:After a couple of beers, it converts to a love seat.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? I don't like this sofa.
OTHERMALE:I drove many miles and may have herniated a disk.
OTHERFEMALE:You love this sofa.
LEADFEMALE:No, i don't.
SUPMALE:It reminds me of mom.
SUPFEMALE:It looks like mom.
SUPFEMALE:It feels like mom.
LEADFEMALE:It smells like mom.
LEADFEMALE:It's just like sitting on mom.
OTHERMALE:I think you'd like that.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't work.
LEADFEMALE:Get it out of here.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? Burn it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you can.
LEADMALE:It's mom's sofa.
SUPMALE:It'll burst into flames if you just sprinkle some holy water on it.
LEADMALE:Rosie, you gotta calm down.
LEADMALE:Obviously, it's the hormones-it is not my hormones, okay? It is a bad sofa, and now i know why mom puts the plastic covers on it.
OTHERFEMALE:It's to keep the evil fresh.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:Calm down.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Don't.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have it smelling like family in no time.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe you're right.
OTHERMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:But it isn't my hormones! No.
LEADFEMALE:A new couch is a big change.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, hell, it's an adjustment for me, and i just have tiny, insignificant guy hormones.
LEADMALE:Sohave you thought of any names for the baby? I cannot believe that you would ask me that now, after i spend the day groveling to my mother, trying to save my sister's marriage, and hauling around your overgrown fetus inside my body.
OTHERFEMALE:Now that was my hormones! It's good.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:It's pretty easy to make.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Can you pass the salt? Here.
OTHERMALE:You want some? The potatoes are kind of blah.
LEADMALE:Nope.
OTHERFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:How's andy today? Good.
SUPMALE:Pretty good.
OTHERMALE:I think it's over, fred.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I think so, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'll pack tonight.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? I'm watching the beverly hillbillies.
LEADMALE:Jethro is ciphering.
LEADFEMALE:I love it when he does the "gazindas.
SUPFEMALE:" "four gazinda twelve three times.
LEADMALE:"two gazinda four two times.
LEADFEMALE:Aught gazinda aught aught times.
OTHERFEMALE:" that's the one thing about the clampetts, dan.
LEADFEMALE:No matter how much money they got, you know, the big house, the fancy eating table, the cement bond, they still love a good possum.
SUPFEMALE:They're true to their roots.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:How many of these have you watched? All of them.
SUPFEMALE:They're having a hillbillies marathon in honor of buddy ebsen's channel 10 is rerunning the barnaby jones.
LEADFEMALE:God bless ted turner.
SUPMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:So what are you doing out here? do you miss the old sofa? Mmm, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Now i understand why granny made jed build her that little cabin out in the back.
LEADFEMALE:You know all that new stuff we got, dan, and them fancy channels we're trying to watch now? I just don't think i can change to that classy lifestyle all at once.
LEADMALE:Honey, a new couch and pbs isn't exactly a classy lifestyle.
SUPMALE:I mean, i thought it would be cool to change for the sake of the baby and everything, but it isn't gonna happen.
LEADFEMALE:We're white trash, and we will stay white trash till the day they haul us out to the curb.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, i don't want you to change.
OTHERMALE:Part of the reason i love you is 'cause you're hill folk.
SUPFEMALE:Like that old saying, "to thine own self be true.
OTHERFEMALE:" well, i'll be damned.
SUPFEMALE:That ain't shakespeare, is it? You have been watching pbs.
SUPMALE:Actually, i got it from a commercial.
LEADMALE:"to thine own self be true.
SUPFEMALE:Shop at eddie's subaru.
OTHERFEMALE:" why don't we just move this couch back into the living room? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:What about the one that bev gave us? We'll put that out on the lawn up on cinder blocks.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Most folks around here don't have a sofa on their front lawn.
OTHERMALE:We don't wanna appear prideful in front of them that ain't have.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a better idea.
LEADMALE:Why don't we sell that sofa? We won't tell mom, and we will spend all that money on opossums and rheumatism medicine.
LEADFEMALE:Reee-doggie! 
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan, they were all out of broccoli so i got frosted flakes instead.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPFEMALE:What? Show her.
OTHERMALE:Show me what? David.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh, i got this thing at school today.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man, i hate things from school.
LEADMALE:The last thing was a note from the principal that said d.j. was selling my bras.
LEADFEMALE:You're graduating? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god! oh, my god, yay! Ow, you're hurting me.
SUPMALE:You're hurting me.
LEADMALE:We totally had you going.
LEADMALE:Somebody from this house graduating from high school! Man, i just never could have seen that coming.
OTHERMALE:Somebody from this house graduating high school.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody from this house graduating high school! did you hear that world? Somebody from this house is graduating high school! Quiet.
SUPMALE:You'll attract gold-diggers.
SUPMALE:Oh, darlene, we are gonna have the biggest blowout ever.
LEADMALE:We never got to do this with you or becky.
LEADMALE:You know, this is our last time to celebrate a high school graduation.
OTHERMALE:No, you still have d.j. like i said, big blowout! We're really proud of you, son.
LEADMALE:You can relax and take comfort in knowing you've done a fine, fine job.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what are you gonna do for the rest of your life? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:But i think i have this next month figured out though.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna do something with the money my mom sent me.
LEADMALE:Well, that's nice, david.
LEADFEMALE:I will think very fondly of your mother while i'm watching that big screen tv.
LEADMALE:No, see, i'm thinking of going to europe.
LEADFEMALE:What? Long way to go to bring back a tv.
SUPFEMALE:Man, i figured the only way any of you kids would ever get to go overseas is if you lucked out and they were having another war.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just looking forward to finally seeing in person all of the art i've been studying in books.
LEADFEMALE:They got art in europe? You can just send me a postcard.
SUPMALE:Darlenehey, david.
SUPMALE:When you're over there, bring me back something real classy, you know, like one of them naked statues for out on the lawn.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, are you mad or something? No, pierre.
LEADMALE:I'm delighted that you're gonna be in europe all summer while i'm stuck here in lanford in chateau de lard ass.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a month, darlene.
SUPMALE:I know, david, but we just got back together.
SUPMALE:I mean, what if some other boy moves into the basement? I just think this is something i gotta do.
OTHERMALE:Well, here's something else you gotta do.
OTHERMALE:Learn the french translation of "no, this is my full height.
LEADFEMALE:" hey, david.
SUPMALE:I thought your graduation ceremony was great.
SUPMALE:I really loved that part where everyone threw them square hats with the tassels up in the air.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I just wish mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner would've asked me first.
SUPMALE:I kind of wanted to do it.
LEADMALE:Got to move quick around us.
SUPMALE:You should know that.
LEADMALE:You've eaten here.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Just thinking about europe.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? I often come out here and think about living over there.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think i'm gonna go.
LEADFEMALE:What? You were looking forward to it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's just kind of stupid, you know? The young artist going to paris to be inspired by famous paintings.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Some of the greatest paintings of all time have come from there.
LEADMALE:Like that woman sitting in the chair, or them kids crying with the big eyes.
LEADMALE:Well, i know.
LEADMALE:It's just, i'm young, you know, and the art over there is so old.
SUPMALE:David, what's this really all about? Are you nervous about leaving home? 'cause, you know, technically this isn't your home.
LEADMALE:Well, it's just, you know, darlene and i are finally back together again, andoh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and i'm starting to think that maybe spending a month apart would be a mistake.
LEADMALE:Well, being together is important, but a man needs time for his own thoughts.
SUPMALE:That's why i put a lock on the bathroom door.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but i'm thinking maybe i could just wait 'til we could both go together.
LEADMALE:Really hate to see you pass this up, david.
LEADFEMALE:You've got the time, you've got the money.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen this before.
LEADMALE:If you don't do this now, maybe you'll never do it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll think about it.
SUPMALE:Thanks, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:Hey, have you ever traveled anywhere exotic? Can't say as i have, david.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, wait.
LEADMALE:One year on the way to florida, me and mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner stopped off at gator village, watched a chicken dance on a hot plate.
LEADMALE:Hey, dan, is the stuff in the dishwasher clean or dirty? Dirty.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:No way! You're not working on that big heap of junk boat again, are you? what, are you gonna drag it out and work on it every six years? if i do it in my spare time and my own garage, who's it gonna hurt? You, and a lot.
LEADMALE:You get rid of it.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I just can't do that for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's amazing what you can do once i set my mind to it.
LEADMALE:Well, well, well.
SUPMALE:What have we here? A new saw, a pile of new wood, and some expensive, new, loud plug-in type of thing.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess the new baby doesn't really need all those stupid shots anyway.
LEADFEMALE:All that cost me, like, 150 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and what's it gonna cost by the time it's finished? And you'd better figure that in bananas, because by that time apes will be running the world.
LEADMALE:Including lumber, paint, tools, everything else i need to build a whole boat spread out over a couple of years, maybe a thousand bucks.
LEADFEMALE:What? You got a kid in college, another one on the way and absolutely no savings.
SUPFEMALE:I could really think of a better way to spend a thousand bucks, like you give me a thousand bucks.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop worrying.
SUPFEMALE:Start dreaming a bit.
LEADFEMALE:Now, now when all the kids are gone or "lost," we'll tow this baby down to florida, set sail for the caribbean, figure we'll stock her up with supplies for a couple of months, maybe get some of that imported beer.
LEADMALE:Your snifter of suds, my love.
OTHERMALE:Hey, uh.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are we, anyway? Well, there's the north star, there's the big dipper, and there's the dock.
LEADMALE:So, i would calculate we're about in the ocean.
OTHERFEMALE:Happy my pet? Oh, beyond happy.
OTHERMALE:Whacked out.
LEADFEMALE:How this night possibly be any better? Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan, you thought of everything.
SUPFEMALE:It's the pizza boat.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that is the stupidest, most ridiculous fantasy i've ever heard.
SUPMALE:Except for the pizza boat part.
LEADFEMALE:If you ever really finish this boat, and it ever actually floats, i'll tell you just what's going to happen.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get lost, in say, the first three hours.
LEADFEMALE:Then we'll run into a rock, and we'll end up shipwrecked on some deserted island in the middle of nowhere.
SUPFEMALE:Wow! An uncharted desert island.
OTHERFEMALE:This wasn't on any of my maps.
LEADFEMALE:Skipper! Over here, little buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Abandon ship.
SUPMALE:Pull yourself together, gilligan.
LEADFEMALE:We've got other passengers to think about.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Howell, are you okay? Well, of course, captain.
LEADFEMALE:We howells are made from a hearty stock.
LEADFEMALE:My darling, are you all right? Yes, thurston, i'm fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Not you love, i was talking to the money.
OTHERMALE:Oh, boy, will you be a dear and help us with our luggage? Yes, rich lady.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, professor, do you have any idea where we are? I mean, i'm only asking 'cause you're so smart, and i'm just a dumb girl from the country with an amazing rack.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:One thing's for sure.
LEADFEMALE:Fixing that hole in that boat of ours is way beyond our technology.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, i'm gonna go find some leaves and twigsbuild us a dentist's office.
OTHERMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:I'm david.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, david.
LEADFEMALE:What am i doing here? I don't even like this show.
LEADMALE:I wanted to be on friends.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the important thing is that everybody is okay.
SUPMALE:Hey, where's that movie star? I hope she's all right.
LEADFEMALE:She's so delicate.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, nice driving, ahab.
LEADMALE:That was sure one fun carnival cruise, huh? Soon as we get rescued, i'm gonna strangle that bitch kathie lee.
OTHERMALE:And in other news, the year-long search for those castaways stranded in the south pacific has been discontinued by the coast guard due to budget cuts and lack of interest.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:Believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Lost and forgotten.
LEADFEMALE:I should have known better than to sign with william morris.
LEADMALE:I got problems of my own, ginger.
LEADMALE:Last night, mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Howell asked me for a romantic moonlight stroll on the beach.
SUPFEMALE:Hi-ho, commodore.
LEADFEMALE:How are you and your little buddy? You better be talking about gilligan.
SUPMALE:Come along, thurston.
LEADFEMALE:We don't want to be late to the crab races.
LEADFEMALE:It's the sport of kings, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy! Hurry up with those crabs.
LEADMALE:Coming, mr.
LEADMALE:Howell.
SUPMALE:Aah! Here comes another emmy.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy, mary ann.
OTHERFEMALE:I love coconut pie.
LEADMALE:Coconut, again? All we ever eat around here is coconut.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't there some steak tree on this damn island? All right, here's a question.
LEADFEMALE:How come i'm mary ann, anyway? I've never been to kansas.
OTHERMALE:I've never been on a farm.
OTHERFEMALE:And i'm tired of everybody thinking you're prettier than me.
LEADFEMALE:Deal with it, dorothy.
LEADMALE:Or else i'll use those pigtails to steer while i ride your hillbilly ass all over this island.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's the basement? I can't find the basement.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:We'll finally be able to leave the island.
LEADFEMALE:I pieced together the windshield from the minnow, and we can use that as a reflector to signal planes.
LEADFEMALE:Skipper.
LEADMALE:Skipper.
OTHERMALE:No! gilligan! You better have a good reason for all of this.
SUPFEMALE:I do.
LEADMALE:I do.
LEADFEMALE:It's justslow down, take a deep breath.
SUPMALE:Let it out.
LEADMALE:Now, what's going on, gilligan? We're all gonna die, skipper.
SUPFEMALE:They say a typhoon's coming.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? The filling in my mouth picked up a radio signal from a coast guard cutter.
SUPMALE:Listen.
LEADMALE:Hey, i once did a love scene with abe vigoda, but i'm not going near your mouth.
SUPMALE:Any minute now, a small uncharted island in the pacific will be hit by a typhoon.
SUPFEMALE:Did someone say tycoon? Yeah, that is exactly what they said.
SUPMALE:Any minute now the island will be hit by a gigantic rich man.
LEADMALE:No, no! Typhoon.
LEADFEMALE:But what are the odds that it'll hit this island? The odds are good.
OTHERMALE:D'oh! I wouldn't really worry about that storm, skipper.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Why not? 'cause that volcano is gonna finish us off first.
LEADMALE:Hello, club med! i want my deposit back! if that volcano is erupting, then it's only a matter of minutes beforewhoa! whoa! earthquake! earthquake! Calm down, little buddy.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess the good news is that things couldn't get any worse.
OTHERMALE:So, it couldn't get any worse, eh, gilligan? Oh, it could get way worse.
LEADMALE:I just heard on the radio that fox is doing my life story.
LEADMALE:What's so bad about that? Four words: "denny dillon is ginger.
SUPFEMALE:" dear diary, europe isn't all it's cracked up to be.
SUPMALE:Hey, tall dark and flesh-eating.
LEADMALE:You're about the sexiest little cannibal i've ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:I can do wonders for your career.
LEADMALE:Trust me.
LEADMALE:I've done it before, and with people less civilized than you.
SUPMALE:Oogah booga booga! Ah, everybody is a critic.
OTHERFEMALE:Ginger, i think the only theater he's interested in is dinner theater.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! You are so grounded.
SUPMALE:I cannot believe i'm going to die like this.
LEADMALE:I hope i give your whole village the trots.
LEADMALE:Hold it.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, that story is absolutely ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:There's no way that would happen in a million years.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? That's the same thing you said about fat-free fig newtons.
LEADMALE:The point is, we can sail around the world together, just the two of us.
LEADFEMALE:No, face it, dan.
LEADMALE:We're marooned in this house, and nobody is ever gonna rescue us.
SUPMALE:That goes for me, you, d.j. , the new baby, and the rest.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just smash it up, leave it on the curb for the garbage man to take it away.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Don't smash it up.
LEADMALE:Just leave it out there and hope for pirates.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, i got apple stuck in my teeth, and we don't have any floss, and i don't feel like using the family toothbrush.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here.
LEADMALE:Use what i use when i got something stuck in my tooth.
LEADMALE:What is it? Caramel.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'll have a coffee with cream and the check, please.
SUPFEMALE:I'm on my way to my job.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a management trainee at the world of pizza.
LEADFEMALE:What? you're going to work at world of pizza instead of going to europe? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Does your love of cheese know no bounds? You know, i thought about it, and i weighed the pros and cons, and i decided not to go.
SUPMALE:Darlene well, it was a stupid idea.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you ruining this for him? Oh, come on, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, everybody knows he'd have a terrible time.
LEADMALE:It is a well-known fact that people from france hate people from lanford.
SUPFEMALE:And he was planning on backpacking.
LEADMALE:I mean, he doesn't even own a backpack.
LEADFEMALE:That's bull, darlene.
SUPMALE:Your father and i went to las vegas with two hefty bags, and we were proud to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i just don't think that he should go.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:What's that? this? It's a hair net.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:Well, put it on.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner no, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Put it on.
LEADMALE:That is totally embarrassing.
LEADMALE:He looks like an idiot.
LEADMALE:You would prefer that he did this instead of going to europe? I gotta go to work, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:No more discussions.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, over in france, they don't care if you wear a hair net or not except for under your arms.
LEADMALE:He still wants to go.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i don't want him to.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we just got back together, mom.
LEADMALE:Come on, you gotta give a guy his dreams.
LEADFEMALE:Then he won't notice that you control his reality.
LEADMALE:Just stay out of this, okay? Oh, darlene.
LEADMALE:Men have to do all this world of pizza-type stuff their whole lives.
LEADMALE:The only thing that keeps them going is hope.
SUPFEMALE:So, no matter how stupid or ridiculous or idiotic their dreams seemi'll be back.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:No, it isn't lumber yet.
SUPFEMALE:Look it, um, well, i've been thinking and the truth of it is i'm actually very excited and looking forward to sailing off with you into the sunset.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you mean? Don't make me actually say it.
LEADFEMALE:I can keep working on the boat? Yeah, but put it together out in the alley because i need the space in here so i can work on my jet.
LEADFEMALE:Deal.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, ginger.
SUPMALE:What? why don't you throw on a little sequin something and we'll play "find the buried treasure"? Only if you're up for a three-hour tour.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, kids! Mom's home.
OTHERFEMALE:Pork rinds light? hey, jackie, what's going on out there? where are you? what's taking you so long? Well, roseanne, i hope you didn't strain yourself carrying that one bag.
LEADFEMALE:So i'm glad you decided to let dan, you know, keep working on his little project in the garage.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, um, how much trouble can you get into on a boat, huh? Hi, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Have you seen my wife becky? No, mark.
LEADMALE:She isn't in this episode.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she said she needed some ice.
LEADMALE:You guys have a recipe for that? Ah, i'm dumb.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Darlene! This family sucks.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong, darlene? I thought you'd be happy now that david's not going to europe.
OTHERMALE:Ugh.
SUPMALE:Aunt jackie, you need to shave.
LEADMALE:Hey, everybody.
SUPMALE:Hi, david.
LEADMALE:Hi, david.
OTHERMALE:We definitely watch too much tv.
OTHERMALE:Cut.
LEADMALE:God, i love this new writing.
SUPFEMALE:Where's my new writer? Sherwood.
OTHERMALE:Sherwood! Sherwood schwartz? yes, roseanne? This script is great.
SUPMALE:If it were a pie, i'd eat it.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, rosie, but you can't stop a scene in the middle like that.
OTHERMALE:I'm the only one who can do that.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? You're fired.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the guy who wrote the brady bunch.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid that's me, too.
OTHERMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:You're hired again.
OTHERFEMALE:Welcome aboard.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Grape, grape.
LEADFEMALE:Grape, grape, grape.
OTHERFEMALE:Grape, grape.
SUPFEMALE:Grape, grape, grape.
LEADMALE:Grape, grape! Orange, orange.
LEADMALE:Orange, orange, orange.
OTHERMALE:Orange hey, david.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going? Great.
LEADMALE:Uh this is about you and darlene breaking up, isn't it? i mean, you didn't catch yourself in your fly, did ya? Uh, listen, david.
LEADMALE:I know you're feeling a lot of feelings.
LEADMALE:And that's good.
LEADFEMALE:Feelings are good.
LEADFEMALE:Even when they're bad.
SUPMALE:Maybe i should go get mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Uh well, because like you, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner has a lot of feelings.
LEADFEMALE:And she likes to talk about 'em.
SUPMALE:I don't want to talk to her.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well listen, i don't think me and you should talk while you're crying, so why don't you just finish up there.
LEADMALE:I don't mind if you're here.
LEADMALE:I i just don't want to embarrass ya.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not ashamed to cry.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh, crying's a sign of strength.
LEADFEMALE:I mean men who cry show a lot of courage.
LEADMALE:A lot more than all the guys who are laughing at 'em.
SUPFEMALE:I just feel like like my heart is just ripped out, you know? And i'm just empty.
LEADMALE:Like a shell.
SUPFEMALE:You understand, don't you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Shell.
LEADFEMALE:I love her so much, mr.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i know, and i'm sure she loves you too.
SUPMALE:She used to.
SUPMALE:Listen, david.
LEADMALE:You know what? Best thing for you to do is just pick yourself up dust yourself off, and start all over again.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with me? why can't she love me? Listen, david.
SUPMALE:Everybody goes through something like this.
LEADMALE:Yeah? you ever lose something you really wanted? I sure have.
LEADMALE:Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:I remember, i was just about your age.
LEADMALE:Regional playoffs, fourth quarter.
LEADFEMALE:We're down by three.
LEADFEMALE:I dive on a fumble, i had it in my arms, it was mine.
SUPFEMALE:Some guy jumped on my back, and i lost it.
SUPMALE:See? No.
LEADFEMALE:I really wanted that ball.
LEADFEMALE:My coach said something to really help me.
LEADFEMALE:He said, "conner, "walk it off.
LEADMALE:" so that's your advice? walk it off? Well, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And the thing about dusting yourself off and starting all over again.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:I'll try.
SUPFEMALE:Thattaboy.
SUPMALE:Oh mom, where's my black coat? Well, that narrows it down.
LEADMALE:My big black one.
LEADMALE:It's in the hall closet.
LEADFEMALE:What are you gonna do with it? I'm gonna take it to school.
LEADMALE:Why don't you get it when you come home for thanksgiving? Yeah, we kind of like having it around here, in case, you know, johnny cash shows up and he's cold.
LEADMALE:I gotta take it now.
SUPMALE:I probably won't be home for thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? I got this job, and i have to work holidays.
LEADFEMALE:Work holidays? what kind of a job is it? Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Dan conner? It's at the radio station.
LEADMALE:And if it works out, i'll get to work there next summer too.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, that's great! I remember my first summer away from home.
LEADFEMALE:I was sick! I hated every minute.
SUPFEMALE:What are you thinking of? where are you going with that mug? I'm gonna pack it for school.
SUPFEMALE:No way, that is your at-home mug.
OTHERMALE:You're not taking that off to school.
LEADMALE:That is to be used only in this house.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, it's mine.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, why don't we just go to denny's and ask which one of us stole it in the first place? Let her have the mug.
LEADFEMALE:If it makes you feel any better, honey, i'll take you out to dinner tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Bring your big purse.
LEADMALE:Now this wouldn't have anything to do with that fact that your ex-boyfriend is living here, and you just don't want to come home and deal with him, does it? Mom, i don't need to use david as a reason not to come home.
LEADFEMALE:I always have you.
OTHERFEMALE:Things still a little tense around here, huh? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Dan, get out of the fridge and go talk to him! i don't wanna go in there! He'll just cry on me again.
LEADMALE:Well, that's tough.
SUPFEMALE:You're drafted.
SUPMALE:I'm putting on a dress and going to canada like i did last time.
LEADMALE:If you like, roseanne, i could talk to the boy.
SUPMALE:I have loved and lost.
SUPFEMALE:I have loved and won.
LEADMALE:Yeah, love's a crazy game.
LEADFEMALE:You pays your money, you takes your chances.
OTHERFEMALE:But that's all part of this cockeyedcockeyed caravan we call life.
LEADFEMALE:What were we talking about? Never mind, jackie.
LEADMALE:I think he should have a man talk to him anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mark.
LEADFEMALE:You know any men? I'm not going in there.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not good with feelings.
LEADMALE:You? you, whose poetry makes me weep? Get in there! All right.
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:I know what you're thinking about, man.
LEADFEMALE:You can't get that picture out of your head.
OTHERMALE:That other guy, climbing on top of her.
SUPFEMALE:God, i never even thought about that.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry, man.
OTHERMALE:I don't think you should be so bummed out.
LEADFEMALE:You can get much hotter girls than darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, she always pushed you around.
OTHERMALE:She's a total bitch.
LEADMALE:Leave me alone.
LEADFEMALE:Nice! Believe me, she was just going to get much worse.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, david, i know you don't want to believe me now, but, you know, you're going to feel better in time.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i don't need your help.
SUPMALE:I was perfectly happy when she was going out with me and jimmy.
OTHERFEMALE:If it wasn't for you, i never would have made her choose.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and the three of you would have made a lovely couple.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe if i would have just waited, she would have gotten tired of jimmy and come back to me.
SUPMALE:Come on, david, that was not gonna happen.
LEADMALE:Darlene felt it was time to move on.
OTHERMALE:You don't know anything about her.
LEADFEMALE:You have no idea what she does in chicago.
OTHERMALE:Well, i assume she's just a little ball of sunshine there same as she is here.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know how she spends her time.
LEADMALE:You don't know who her friends are.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even know she does drugs.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean "drugs"? You name it, she does it.
SUPMALE:But i guess you already knew that, right? Darlene, get up here now! Hey.
OTHERMALE:Let's see if we can get her to pee in a cup without getting her suspicious.
LEADFEMALE:How could our kid could have turned out so stupid? Maybe it's all that pot we smoked in high school.
LEADFEMALE:Get david in here, too.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want darlene to know that he snitched on her.
LEADFEMALE:He's suffered enough.
SUPFEMALE:I don't care, where is he? He's upstairs in the witness protection program.
SUPMALE:He answers to the name steve now.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm packing.
LEADMALE:Sit down, you got a lot of explaining to do.
LEADMALE:Well, see first, i open the suitcase.
OTHERFEMALE:Thensit.
SUPFEMALE:Cut the crap, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Now i want the truth.
SUPFEMALE:Are you using illegal narcotics? No.
SUPMALE:Well, that's funny, 'cause i heard you were.
LEADMALE:Who told you that, david? No.
OTHERMALE:Not david.
OTHERFEMALE:David! get in here now! yeah, 'cause you won't believe what we heard about darlene! Why would you believe david over me? I'm your own daughter.
OTHERMALE:Because we're familiar with your work.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene, how's it going? did you see darlene use drugs? Yeah.
LEADMALE:What kind of drugs? Uh, i know she smoked pot a few times, and she told me she tried speed, and twice i saw her drop acid.
SUPFEMALE:You did acid? i tried it twice, okay? I just tried it.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't like it and i'll never do it again, okay? No, it's not okay.
SUPFEMALE:You tried it and you didn't like it? so then you went and did it again? Well, the first time i was on the floor in convulsions, so i couldn't tell if i liked it, so i tried it a second time.
LEADMALE:If i was you, i'd get serious real fast, darlene.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, i know it was a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:But it was, like, months ago.
LEADMALE:I haven't done it since and i don't plan to.
OTHERMALE:I think you're lying.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not lying.
SUPFEMALE:Well, your father and i think you are, and you say you're not, so i guess we need an impartial third erson to settle this.
LEADMALE:David, you're on our side, what do you think? I think she might.
SUPFEMALE:Unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:Well, darlene, your mother and i are going have to think long and hard about what to do about this.
OTHERMALE:You are not going back to school.
LEADFEMALE:What? That's it! End of discussion.
SUPMALE:Well, we thought about it and we decided you're not going back to school.
LEADMALE:I bet you're high now.
LEADFEMALE:Does my face look all distorted? Yes, which just proves that i'm completely straight.
LEADFEMALE:You know they told us at school, if you do drugs, you wind up all weird and really crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you, dj.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey! Hey, where you goin'? where's your brother going? He's supposed to take out the trash.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i'll do it.
SUPMALE:Hey dad, think fast.
LEADMALE:What's this? you want to try some horse? The game, i mean.
SUPMALE:No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERMALE:It's been a while since we played ball.
SUPFEMALE:This isn't going to work, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going back to school.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, dad.
LEADMALE:Do you really think what i did was that bad? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Give me a break.
LEADFEMALE:You grew up in the '60's.
SUPMALE:I've seen the photo albums.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, those clothes had to have some pharmaceutical explanation.
LEADMALE:Your mother and i smoked pot, and it was stupid, but not nearly as stupid as what you're into.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, you know me, i mean, i'm not an idiot.
LEADMALE:I worked too hard to get into school.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to mess it all up by doing drugs.
SUPFEMALE:Then why'd you try it? 'cause i was curious.
SUPMALE:I mean, now i know.
LEADMALE:I'm not curious anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You believe me, don't you, dad? This matter is closed.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, dj! come on, you gotta take the garbage out! You do believe me.
LEADMALE:You're just going along with mom.
OTHERMALE:Drop it.
LEADMALE:You never stand up to her.
SUPMALE:You know what, darlene? You got a lot to learn about sucking up.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, what are you doing? Well, apparently darlene didn't think i was serious about keeping her home from school, so i'm just helping her unpack.
SUPMALE:You looking for drugs? No, i just want to make sure she doesn't take-off with one of our complimentary bathrobes.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is that? I told her she couldn't take that.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, roseanne? I'm real worried we're doing the wrong thing with darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think she's lying.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think she's going to do it anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dan, if you feel that strongly about it, i guess i'll have to honor your instincts.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:See, you can't even tell when somebody's lying right to your face.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, could you excuse us.
SUPMALE:Roseanne and i have to talk.
OTHERFEMALE:No, this discussion's over.
SUPMALE:You're not going anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:She lied right to us, dan.
LEADMALE:She said she did it once and didn't like it? Come on, nobody doesn't like it.
LEADFEMALE:And besides, david said she would do it again.
OTHERMALE:Well you can't believe david, it's a jilted boyfriend.
LEADMALE:Besides, pulling darlene out of school right now's just gonna screw up any kind of future she might have.
LEADMALE:What, to go on and run one of those huge drug cartels? Well, i could really use some fresh air.
SUPMALE:No! You're not leaving.
SUPFEMALE:He's leaving.
SUPMALE:Leave.
SUPFEMALE:You keep her in lanford, you're just gonna drive her to drugs.
OTHERFEMALE:And around here she won't have to pay those big-city prices.
LEADFEMALE:She won't be doing any drugs around here.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding, look around! why wouldn't she? hell, why don't we? she won't, because we are going to be watching her, and we won't, because we couldn't possibly be any happier than we are right now! anybody need a popsit down! You're gonna keep an eye on her all the time? what are you going to do, quit your job, put her in a box, and watch her all day? No, dan, i'm going to put her on top of the television so you can watch her all day.
LEADFEMALE:I give up.
SUPMALE:Can you believe him? His kid is on drugs and he's acting like she ate her school paste.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i don't know, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Did you ever think that if you keep her home, you could be screwing up your relationship with her forever.
LEADMALE:Who's side are you on? I'm on your side.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just worried you might not be thinking clearly.
SUPFEMALE:Not thinking clearly? i won a great big argument just then, didn't i? I just know that it is very hard for you every time that darlene goes away to school, and now it seems even more permanent because she is taking her "at home" mug.
SUPFEMALE:Are you out of your ever-loving mind? this has nothing to do about a stupid mug, okay? It has to do with my kid on dope! i don't think you understood the symbolism of the mug! Hi, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, i just want to tell you that i really think you're doing the right thing keeping darlene home from school and if you want i can help keep an eye on her for you.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, and i'd like for you to use a variety of disguises.
SUPMALE:I heard her talking on the phone and i think she might be planning on running away to chicago and staying with some friends.
SUPMALE:So, i called the radio station and they said she hasn't quit her job yet.
LEADFEMALE:Plus, i think i know where she keeps her journal.
OTHERMALE:That could help us a lot.
OTHERMALE:Well, thanks for the beat from the street, huggy bear.
OTHERFEMALE:What? well, you've got it all figured out, don't you? why are you mad at me? I'm just trying to help darlene.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:If you were trying to help darlene, why didn't you tell me she was using drugs before this? Because, i, i, i wasn't worried about her when i was around to protect her.
SUPMALE:Mmm hmm.
LEADFEMALE:And who knows the kind of people she's running around with now? Like that new guy she's dating.
SUPFEMALE:He's definitely the type that does drugs.
LEADMALE:Do you know that? do you have proof of that? No, but, you know, it's a feeling.
OTHERMALE:And, uh, that feeling wouldn't be posessiveness and selfishness, now would it, david? what did i do wrong here? You are mad at darlene for dumping you.
OTHERMALE:So you're desperate to keep her in the house.
LEADMALE:And you're spying on her.
LEADFEMALE:Which normally i like, but i don't like the way you're doing it.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go talk to her.
LEADMALE:She's in the basement.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you just don't quit, do you? darlene! Did you have fun looking through my things? Well, i always have.
SUPMALE:Well, if you found something that looks like a stamp, don't lick it.
SUPFEMALE:You know, darlene, i would like nothing better than to believe you so i could let you go back to school.
SUPFEMALE:You don't want to believe me.
SUPMALE:I do so.
SUPMALE:If you could just give me one little thing to hold on to.
LEADMALE:I swear to god, with all my heart and soul, that i regret doing it.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, it was a stupid thing to do, and i'll never do it again, i swear to god.
OTHERFEMALE:What else you got? Nothing, that's all i got.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Well, go to school.
LEADFEMALE:Really? you believe me that i'm not gonna do drugs? I really don't know what to believe, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, you're almost an adult now and i just have no choice but to just let you go and just take my chances.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'd feel better if you trusted me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i'd feel better if i trusted you, too.
SUPMALE:You know, but if you want my trust, then you're going to have to work really hard to earn it back.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, i'm telling the truth.
SUPFEMALE:I only tried it because i was curious.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i really hope that that's true.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope you weren't doing it, for some reason, to, uh, rebel against me and your dad.
SUPMALE:'cause there's other ways to aggrevate us besides frying your brain cells.
OTHERMALE:You know, look at becky.
LEADFEMALE:She never did drugs, she married mark.
SUPMALE:Well, there is a young republican that i'm interested in.
SUPFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Now you're thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:But if i think that anything is up at all, i will yank your butt back here so fast that you'll think you're having a flashback.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i got it.
LEADFEMALE:And you're gonna call me every single hour on the weekends.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:And i want you in this house for all the holidays, okay, thanksgiving, christmas and black history month.
LEADMALE:Well, what am i supposed to say to my job when they say i have to work? Just say no.
SUPMALE:All packed up and ready to go to school, huh? You know, the great thing about this is, is that after all that's happened, we can stil talk like this.
SUPFEMALE:Would it help at all if i told you i'm really sorry about what happened? Yeah, me too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry i didn't dump your ass sooner.
OTHERFEMALE:It's okay, mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, i'm gonna be strong, i'm not going to cry.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:Okay, david.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Just let me get the remote.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Rose, where's that itch cream? I got me one fierce bug bite.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you know that mirror in the bathroom? Well, that mirror is actually a magical door that opens into a world of medicine.
OTHERMALE:I looked in the medicine cabinet, and it ain't in there.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure it was the medicine cabinet you looked in? was it cold? was there milk and beer in there? Come on, becky, i can't sleep with the light on.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i can't read with the light off.
LEADFEMALE:I looked on every shelf.
LEADMALE:I even moved a jar.
LEADFEMALE:Shh! If i don't get some sleep, i'm gonna be in a bad mood all day tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:So, how is that different from any other day of the week? Good one, becky.
SUPMALE:I'm tired, and i want to sleep.
OTHERMALE:Turn off the damn light.
SUPMALE:I'm not tired, and i don't want to sleep.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's that cream? I got me another bite.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you go downstairs and read? You can turn on every light in the damn house then.
LEADMALE:If i go downstairsthey've been fightin' for three days over a light? No, dan, they are not actually fighting about a light.
SUPMALE:The light is just an excuse for what they're really fighting about, like that time we had the fight about you and your bad breath.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? I was actually mad because you came home late, so you brushed your teeth for nothin'.
SUPFEMALE:I'm keeping the light on so i can read.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see how well you can read without the light bulb.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! ha ha ha! He's 23, and he just figures out light bulbs are hot.
SUPMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well, roseanne, the reviews are in.
SUPFEMALE:Our suggestion box is full.
SUPMALE:You know what that means? Yeah, time to get a new box with no slot on the top.
LEADMALE:Oh, you know, i wonder how someone with your obvious people skills could be afraid of a little suggestion box.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's demeaning.
LEADFEMALE:It reminds our regular customers that they are unable to write.
OTHERMALE:Well, just remember there is nothing to fear but, well, everything that's inside.
LEADFEMALE:Ha.
LEADMALE:Okay, suggestion number 1: "the meat is a little dry.
LEADFEMALE:" i would agree with that.
SUPMALE:Suggestion number 2: "make that uptight blond guy "stop hovering over us while we're trying to eat.
OTHERFEMALE:" i would agree with that.
LEADFEMALE:Now let's see suggestion number 3: "lose the waiter guy.
LEADFEMALE:He reminds me of my mother.
LEADFEMALE:" well, aren't we clever, roseanne? Stuffing the suggestion box.
LEADFEMALE:This is your suggestion, isn't it? Guess again.
OTHERMALE:Well, luckily, uh, i don't value the opinion of anyone who would choose to eat here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, a deal's a deal.
SUPMALE:Free pie.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry i'm late.
LEADFEMALE:The baby kept me up all night.
LEADMALE:Well, you married him.
LEADMALE:I was up all night, too.
SUPMALE:Why? 'cause becky and mark were having a big fight in the next room, and it's hard to sleep when you're wearing a stethoscope.
LEADFEMALE:My, they certainly have been fighting a lot lately, hmm? I try to get becky to talk about it, but she won't.
SUPFEMALE:It's a shame when a daughter won't talk to her mother about certain marital problems.
OTHERMALE:You know! I never said that.
LEADMALE:You totally know.
OTHERFEMALE:What's goin' on? Well, it's sort of a bedroom thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I swore to becky i wouldn't tell.
SUPMALE:Well, it's not my fault that you make promises you can't keep.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's really nothing to tell because there's nothing to tell.
LEADMALE:Nothing? so how much nothing? Like five weeks of nothing, and when you're trying to have a baby, that is a whole lot of nothing.
LEADFEMALE:So becky shut mark down.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder what his brain's gonna do with all that extra blood.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i guess one could interpret the situation in that way if one only had partial knowledge.
LEADMALE:Spill it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, um according to becky, she is not the one holding back.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Mark is just not interested in sex.
SUPMALE:Poor becky.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Now she'll have to teach him to talk.
OTHERFEMALE:But please don't tell becky that i told you, because i promised.
LEADFEMALE:You know i wouldn't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, my word is every bit as good as yours.
LEADFEMALE:I just think maybe she felt more comfortable talking to someone who might understand her problem.
LEADMALE:Oh, no way.
SUPFEMALE:Your kid's and you guys still aren't doin' it? No, we're doing it, but things have gotten kind of rushed.
LEADMALE:Well, rushed is kind of fun, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes me and dan try to race the microwave popcorn.
LEADMALE:It's not fun to rush every time.
LEADMALE:Fred is so nervous about wakin' the baby up that he is beginning to gloss over some vital areas.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:Are you talking aboutyou mean he gets in the elevator, but he won't go down? If i wasn't gay before, i would be now.
LEADMALE:Well, if you weren't gay before, then a whole bunch of guys owe you a big apology.
LEADMALE:Hey, have you gotten to the really horny part of pregnancy yet? well, uh, you don't see any delivery boys circling my house yet, do you? No, so-well, that must be tough on dan if you're not all that interested.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he's convinced that it's 'cause we're stale, you know, so he thinks he's gettin' these big ideas out of these crazy men's magazines, stuff to try, you know, like, uh last night, he wanted to suck my toes.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Did it get you excited? No! But it got him goin'.
LEADMALE:No! dan? No! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, it turned out pretty good, but i wasn't gonna kiss him after that.
SUPMALE:Hello? oh, uh, david healy? how do you girls keep getting this phone number? We've had it changed five times.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's a betty fuller, and she wants you to go have coffee with her.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, i don't drink coffee.
LEADMALE:Coffee is just a code, david.
LEADFEMALE:She's trying to be ladylike.
LEADMALE:She can't just come right out and say "nail me!" please, mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, just tell her i'm not in.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, yeah, betty, hi.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but, uh, david isn't here.
LEADFEMALE:Apparently, he had an emergency slouch and mope seminar to attend.
LEADFEMALE:But i'll let him know you called.
LEADMALE:Thanks, i think.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go out with her? Betty's a nice person.
LEADMALE:I just don't think it would work out with her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it doesn't have to work out with her.
LEADFEMALE:She's a practice girl.
LEADMALE:You know, she's like the frame that you bowl before you actually start keeping score.
SUPFEMALE:Look, i'm just not ready to have coffee with someone.
LEADMALE:When i'm ready to have coffee with someone, then i'll have coffee with someone.
SUPMALE:Well, you better start drinking coffee pretty soon, or you're gonna end up alone in your room grinding your own beans.
SUPFEMALE:Good afternoon, family pseudo-family.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, do i feel good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course you do.
SUPMALE:You haven't been here all day.
SUPFEMALE:You are lookin' at a man whose crew just finished the bi-yearly maintenance on the school buses five-count 'emfive days early.
SUPFEMALE:City's so pleased, they're talking bonus.
SUPFEMALE:It'll never happen, but there is talk.
SUPMALE:Well, um, david, could you get out of here? 'cause i need to speak to mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner alone.
LEADMALE:Oh, roseanne, don't speak to me alone.
LEADMALE:Not when i just finished the school buses five days early.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Conner wants you to stay, and yet i want you to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever will you do? oh, what? Okay, becky and mark, they're having all these sex problems, but after you talk to mark, then you fill me in.
LEADMALE:I just remembered somethin' that i have to deal with that isn't this.
LEADMALE:No, come on.
LEADMALE:Now, this is serious because this could split becky and mark up, and you know how our daughters arethey dump 'em, and then we're forced to raise 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you talk to becky? Because becky isn't the one havin' the problem.
LEADFEMALE:Mark's the one that won't put out.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am i swamped with the noises in my head.
LEADMALE:Come on, dan, this is serious.
LEADMALE:He's gotta talk to another man.
SUPMALE:No way.
SUPFEMALE:Men don't talk to each other about this kind of stuff.
LEADMALE:I thought you and mark were supposed to be good friends.
OTHERFEMALE:We are friends.
OTHERMALE:You men.
LEADFEMALE:You say you have these great friendships, but all you really have is just another hairy person to eat chips and itch with.
SUPFEMALE:What could be better? You have to do it, dan.
LEADMALE:You have to do it to help becky.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I helped my daughter learn to walk.
SUPFEMALE:I helped my daughter learn how to ride a bike.
LEADMALE:I helped my daughter with her homework.
SUPFEMALE:But i refuse to help my daughter get some.
SUPMALE:I'm tellin' you, he could take him.
LEADFEMALE:You kiddin'? Never.
OTHERFEMALE:He could never take tyson.
OTHERMALE:I got to go with bob on this one.
LEADFEMALE:He looked pretty old.
SUPMALE:I'm not talkin' about the rocky in rocky 5.
LEADMALE:I'm talkin' about the rocky in rocky 1.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, the real rocky.
SUPMALE:All right, i'll tell you who rocky definitely couldn't take: terminator.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's a completely different thing.
LEADFEMALE:The terminator guy, he's not even real.
SUPFEMALE:You know what, you guys? you ever think we spend too much time talking about sports and stuff? We never talk about our relationships.
LEADMALE:Well i'll tell you somethin' about my wife.
OTHERFEMALE:She could take tyson and the terminator.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, dan, i'm serious.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we should open up a little.
SUPFEMALE:It wouldn't hurt us to talk about personal things that really matter.
OTHERMALE:Well, i gotta go to the can.
SUPMALE:Can't get much more personal than that.
OTHERMALE:Hey, this is nuts, guys.
LEADMALE:I mean, we're all married.
LEADFEMALE:We've all got marital issues.
SUPFEMALE:Fredlike money and love and sex.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, did roseanne get ahold of you? Now, take me and jackie, for instance.
LEADFEMALE:When we first got married, we had a lot of sex.
LEADFEMALE:Then we went through a period where we hardly had any sex at all.
LEADMALE:Oh, dear god.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you're the only one of you not having sex.
SUPFEMALE:What's that supposed to mean? I mean maybe jackie put some more men on the job.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I gave it a shot.
SUPFEMALE:Let's just drop it.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, hit a little bit too close to home, huh? Not my home.
OTHERMALE:It's not my wife who said she's not gettin' any.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell are you talkin' about? I know what hasn't been goin' on between you and becky.
OTHERMALE:I told roseanne we shouldn't talk about this.
LEADFEMALE:I meanjust screw the both of youse.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:God, fred, what were you thinking? I was tryin' to help.
LEADMALE:The guy's obviously in pain.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, he's in a lot more now.
LEADFEMALE:Mark, stop punchin' that truck! How did roseanne get you to talk to him? I think she might be right about this.
LEADMALE:Maybe guys should talk more about this kind of stuff.
LEADMALE:Wrong! We're guys.
SUPFEMALE:When we talk about sex, there should be bragging, dirty jokes, and the occasional limerick.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:But women discuss everything, and they live longer.
LEADMALE:No, they don't live longer.
LEADMALE:We die sooner from boredom from listenin' to their discussions.
LEADMALE:I just think if we could talk about more intimate stuff the way that women do, it would make us feel good.
LEADFEMALE:Like, i gotta try to talk to mark again.
SUPMALE:Fred, haven't you been listenin' to me? why don't you just stop and think? Dan, look, if mark's havin' a little bit of trouble in the sack, maybe he could use some advice from a guy who's got a pretty good track record in that department.
LEADMALE:Kinda counts you out, doesn't it? excuse me? Come on, fred, we're communicating.
SUPMALE:Doesn't that make you feel just great? Apparently, it's not as great as roseanne's toes make you feel.
LEADMALE:Well, all i know is, you're gonna flunk marriage is you can't pass the oral.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, we know too much, we know too much, we know too much.
LEADMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:Fred.
LEADFEMALE:There is no graceful way out of this, so let's just look at our feet and walk away.
LEADFEMALE:Get out and date.
LEADFEMALE:I told you, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, i'm not ready.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't care if you are.
OTHERMALE:I am.
SUPFEMALE:So i went through your yearbook, and i circled all the girls that looked desperate.
SUPFEMALE:You circled all the cafeteria ladies.
SUPFEMALE:Well, try to ignore the hairnets.
LEADMALE:Guess what happened today.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone talked real slow.
SUPFEMALE:How dare you! because i felt like it, that's why! you know what i'm talkin' about? No, but i don't like your tone! I'm talkin' about you tellin' jackie aboutthe other night.
LEADFEMALE:That? Yes, that! What goes on in our bedroom is sacred.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:That's from the old testament, right? A toe for a toe.
LEADMALE:Shut up with that! Now thanks to you, mark and fred and i now know stuff about each other that no guy should ever know about another guy.
SUPFEMALE:And what's worse, we all know that we know.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's not easy being a woman, is it, dan? you just don't get it, do you? It's gonna take years of us guys not talkin' to each other to get back to where we were.
LEADMALE:Why don't you all just cut your tongues out? We all know that fred doesn't need his.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:I can play this little game, too, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:How would you like it if i told everyone our personal stuff? what if i told everybody that you're not too interested in sex lately? well, yeah, why don't you go tell everybody that your wife turns you on all the time for sex? That'd really embarrass me.
LEADFEMALE:This sucks.
LEADMALE:Fine, mark, you drive off! you jerk! I can't believe aunt jackie.
LEADMALE:I confided a huge secret to her, and then she went and told fred.
OTHERMALE:Now mark is madder than ever.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:We all know.
LEADMALE:What? Well, your aunt jackie is a huge blabbermouth, and she tells everybody everything! you should hear what she told about your father! roseanne! This is great.
LEADMALE:So everyone knows that my husband finds me repulsive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, becky, nobody thinks that.
SUPFEMALE:Just leave me alone.
SUPMALE:Well, i hope you're happy.
OTHERFEMALE:You just managed to make everyone's life worse.
OTHERMALE:Yes, and i'm exhausted! i could use a little help next time! Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I brought you up some dinner.
OTHERMALE:Everybody was real hungry, though, so it's mostly just peas.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want any.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, remember when you were a little girl and, um, i used to come up here and sit on the bed with you and i used to brush your hair and you'd tell me about all the stuff that happened to you that day in school? We never did that.
LEADMALE:Well, i always wanted to.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, i should be studying.
LEADMALE:You know, becky, this problem that you and mark are havingmom, i'm really not comfortable talking about this with you.
SUPMALE:Well, why not? We're two married, mature women, and i think that we can talk about, you know it.
OTHERMALE:Mom it's one of the great things about being women, you know? We can talk intimately in a way that men can't.
OTHERMALE:You know sober.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, i'm pretty sure i know what mark's problem is.
OTHERFEMALE:He's feeling like i'm moving away from him because i'm going to school and he's not.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That makes sense.
LEADMALE:That'sthat's really good.
LEADMALE:I know this is not my fault.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, mark's just feeling insecure, and he needs to work it out.
LEADMALE:Wellwell, that's great.
SUPFEMALE:See? see? This kind of girl talk can really help a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i got most of that stuff from david.
OTHERMALE:You girl-talked with david? Talkin' to david made me feel a lot better.
LEADFEMALE:I bet it made you feel a lot taller, too.
OTHERFEMALE:You ready to go? where you goin'? Just to talk.
SUPMALE:David's really sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm sweet.
LEADMALE:How come nobody ever talks to me? We're just gonna go have some coffee.
SUPFEMALE:David is not ready for coffee.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i think i am.
SUPMALE:Don't you think you should be having coffee with your own husband? Mark doesn't want any.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, if mark's not interested in having coffee, then i'll have coffee with her.
LEADMALE:Well, i had to hear it again from dan last night.
LEADFEMALE:I don't cuddle enough.
LEADMALE:Oh, man! Cuddling? I hate it.
LEADMALE:I work hard all day.
LEADFEMALE:I come home i want my dinner little zip-a-dee-doo-dah slap him on the ass, i'm out like a light.
SUPFEMALE:I always take a couple extra minutes with dan, you know, to finish him off.
LEADMALE:Otherwise, i have to lay there and listen to him gripe.
SUPFEMALE:Daaahhh! Fred.
SUPFEMALE:I really feel bad about what happened at the garage the other day.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I really hurt you, mark.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to call you, but i just didn't feel like i could.
LEADMALE:You can call me, fred, anytime.
LEADFEMALE:You know that.
LEADMALE:Even if it's just to talk.
SUPMALE:Well, you see, mark, we don't always get that from you.
LEADMALE:I mean, sometimes you seem so distant.
LEADFEMALE:I know, and ii don't mean to be.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is delicious, dan.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but how many calories? Oh, like you should worry.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, now, i got my problem areas.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please! I would trade my waistline for your thighs any day.
LEADMALE:Why don't you roosters give it a rest, huh? There'll be plenty to gossip about tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, please.
LEADMALE:And while, uh, we're on the subject there, cupcake, i think you could do without that pudding.
SUPMALE:Why must you always embarrass me in front of my friends?! 
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey? what? I gotta talk to ya.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:I had a rough night.
LEADFEMALE:I can't talk right now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i can see why you'd be tired, being out with my wife all night.
LEADMALE:We went out for coffee.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't want her spending so much time with you.
LEADMALE:I mean, she sees you writing poems and reading books, then she expects me to be some kind of freak, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Mark, she does not expect you to read.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? then why is she asking me what i'm thinking about every five minutes? Like i'm thinking all the time.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Are you guys having problems? No, it's i don't know.
SUPMALE:It's just we used to talk a lot, and lately, it's as if we got nothing left to say to each other.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:Well, what did you used to talk about? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Uh "what kind of car do you drive?" uh "what's your middle name?" that's okay, mark.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but if i keep asking her what her middle name is she's gonna think i'm some kind of idiot.
SUPFEMALE:You know, mark, any relationship goes through phases, and only by talking about your feeling with each other can you ever get to the next level.
SUPFEMALE:So you're the one she got that crap from.
LEADFEMALE:Mark! david! i need a hand! Water pipe burst and the basement's flooded.
SUPFEMALE:Mark, go get my wrench.
OTHERFEMALE:D.j. , david's staying with you tonight.
LEADMALE:No way! darlene doesn't have to sleep with him! How come i do? Good.
LEADFEMALE:You can stay in the basement.
LEADFEMALE:You'll finally get some use out of those webbed toes of yours.
LEADFEMALE:David, you better get down there and get the rest of your stuff out.
LEADFEMALE:You should have to move into the garage.
SUPMALE:You're not really a member of this family anyway.
LEADMALE:Young man, i don't ever want to hear you talking like that again.
OTHERMALE:If he moves into the garage, i might have to move my tools.
LEADMALE:You better pray i fall asleep before you do.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to help you get your stuff from downstairs? I'll do it later.
LEADFEMALE:Something wrong? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Maybe i just need to get away from this house.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that.
OTHERFEMALE:That's just a phase.
LEADMALE:You won't get over it.
SUPMALE:You wanna talk about it? No, i can't tell you about people.
SUPFEMALE:It's much too disgusting.
LEADMALE:You'd think i was a total creep.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, david.
SUPMALE:We're friends.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, if something's upsetting you, you can tell me.
LEADMALE:Last night after we got back, i had a dream and it kinda disturbed me.
SUPFEMALE:You mean like a nightmare? No, it was more like a an adult dream.
LEADMALE:You mean about darlene? No, not darlene.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I feel really uncomfortable talking to you about this.
OTHERFEMALE:David, i mean, it's not like you did anything.
LEADFEMALE:In a way, it's kinda flattering.
LEADMALE:What the hell you doing holding my wife's hand? hand? No.
LEADFEMALE:No hands.
OTHERFEMALE:She was just making me feel better.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just ask her for a lap dance? could you possibly be more boorish? Well, i am sorry i'm boring you, becky.
SUPMALE:What the hell are you doing holding his hand? Like you care.
SUPFEMALE:She loves you so much.
LEADFEMALE:** what time is it? It's about8:30.
OTHERFEMALE:You want some toast? We're late.
SUPFEMALE:Leon's gonna blow a gasket.
LEADMALE:How about some blueberry pancakes? from scratch? I'll get the bowl.
LEADFEMALE:As soon as i finish my coffee, i'll go to the store and get the blueberries.
OTHERFEMALE:You're sleeping on the floor again tonight.
SUPMALE:That's not fair, d.j. you know what? I don't care! Mrs.
LEADMALE:Connor, help me out here.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't we supposed to rotate who gets the bed and who has to sleep on the floor? That' right, d.j. , just like your dad and i do.
OTHERMALE:This sucks.
LEADMALE:I'm always the one stuck with david.
SUPMALE:Well, fair is fair, d.j. we wrote your name on a whole bunch of pieces of paper, we put them in a hat.
LEADMALE:And when we drew one out, it said your name on it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, d.j. having a roommate can be great.
LEADMALE:The years i spent growing up in the same room with your mom are the happiest memories of my life.
SUPFEMALE:Sybil, can you have jackie come out now? I hate the way you chew your food! It's all right.
SUPMALE:I won't be staying here much longer.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh, i made a decision.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna move out of the house.
LEADFEMALE:What a coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:I made a decision, too.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not! I've been thinking about getting my own apartment.
LEADMALE:I just think it's time.
LEADMALE:Well, time is a funny thing, david, and it passes very slowly when you're pinned under mr.
SUPMALE:Connor's massive frame, right, dan? Dan hurt david.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a second, david.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't move out just 'cause of the other day.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i can't live here with things the way they are.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean "the way they are"? It's nothing, mother.
SUPFEMALE:Dan! Becky knows something that i don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky, you can't know something your mother doesn't know! I don't think david wants you to find out.
LEADFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:If he has something he doesn't want me to find out about, then he should not be discussing it with anyone on my planet.
LEADMALE:It's not a big deal.
LEADFEMALE:David is just feeling weird 'cause he had this big dream about me and him, you know together.
LEADMALE:And the two of you were being chased by a bear? No, dan.
LEADMALE:My guess is they were having sex.
OTHERMALE:Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:I should have known you couldn't deal with this.
SUPFEMALE:I will handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Just leave it alone.
LEADMALE:Man, oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:David and becky.
SUPFEMALE:We got us a problem here, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:What if mark won't bow out gracefully? He's fantasizing about his brother's wife, for god's sake.
SUPMALE:Calm down.
SUPMALE:It's not like he ate the last piece of pie or nothing.
SUPFEMALE:This is serious.
LEADFEMALE:If he's dreaming it, he's gonna try and make it happen.
LEADMALE:Oh, right.
LEADMALE:That reminds me, i better get down to the supermarket so i can walk around naked.
LEADFEMALE:Look, he's a horny teenage boy.
LEADFEMALE:If he wants to move out of the house, i think we should let him, just to be safe.
LEADFEMALE:We cannot control our kid's dreams, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:We can only make sure they don't come true.
SUPMALE:Uh, can i say something? A dream like this can be interpreted in so many different ways.
LEADFEMALE:We don't know what kind of sex it was.
LEADFEMALE:We don't know where the sex took place.
SUPFEMALE:How many people were involved.
LEADMALE:My point is that sex dreams are rarely about sex.
LEADMALE:Quite often they are merely a yearning for affection.
SUPFEMALE:David could be longing for a puppy.
LEADMALE:Ora kind word.
LEADMALE:But in the dream state, this desire takes the form of, well, intercourse with becky.
LEADMALE:Look, jackie, you made a brand-new vein stand out on dan's head.
SUPFEMALE:We're not done talking about this.
OTHERMALE:Man, i saw this coming.
SUPFEMALE:All these unrelated kids under one roof.
OTHERMALE:It's an abomination.
LEADFEMALE:We're breaking, like, well, that would explain the flood in the basement.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you always following me? what? You know, you're in my room all night.
SUPFEMALE:Now you have to follow me around all day, too? what are you talking about? I was here first.
SUPFEMALE:No, i was here first.
OTHERMALE:You were not.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been here since 1981 when i was born.
SUPMALE:Both of you shut up.
SUPMALE:Why do you have to sit so close? I'm not.
OTHERMALE:You're always hanging around me.
SUPFEMALE:Are you in love with me like you are with becky? Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:What are you guys talking about? I heard becky telling mom and dad that david had a sex dream about her.
LEADFEMALE:What? No.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, man this is not what you think.
LEADMALE:That's bull.
SUPMALE:You wanna sleep with my wife.
SUPFEMALE:Lay him.
LEADFEMALE:I want my room back.
LEADMALE:Get up.
SUPMALE:I've been working out you know.
LEADFEMALE:Fight! fight! What's going on? Mark's killing david.
OTHERMALE:Oh, god! what are you dreaming about my wife? nothing! what are you dreaming about becky? so darlene dumped you and you thought you could take a crack at my wife, is that it? no! no! then what are you dreaming about her for? i'm not! liar! look, i didn't have a sex dream becky, okay? I didn't! I had a dream about mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Connor.
SUPFEMALE:Now can we put him back in the basement? Eating food at the grocery store is stealing.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care what you say.
OTHERMALE:It is never considered stealing when an unborn child has a craving.
SUPMALE:How does an unborn child have a craving for twinkies? Well, you know how kids are.
SUPMALE:They're easily swayed by advertising.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
OTHERFEMALE:He is serious about moving out.
LEADMALE:Look, david circled apartment ads.
SUPMALE:So what? That could be any of my kidsor dan.
LEADMALE:If you want, i could talk to the boy about his becky dreams.
LEADMALE:I think this really ought to be handled with a little bit of sensitivity.
SUPFEMALE:David, i was just thinking about you.
OTHERMALE:Well i wasn't thinking about you, i swear.
LEADFEMALE:Be gentle with him.
LEADFEMALE:I know! Look, david, i don't want to make you feel uncomfortable, but you know, i want you to know that we are, like, totally okay with this dream.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i'm uncomfortable.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm very uncomfortable now.
LEADMALE:Maybe i can help.
LEADFEMALE:David, what mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Connor is trying to say is that that this dream does not bother her at all.
LEADMALE:Really? so you're not mad? Makes perfect sense.
LEADFEMALE:You see her all day, you smell her perfume, you brush up against her in the halls.
SUPFEMALE:Bound to happen sooner or later.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you'd be disgusted.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You're a perfectly healthy adolescent boy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't think you're the only kid that's had these kind of thoughts.
LEADMALE:Why do you think all of d.j. 's little friends always wanna sleep over? It's a part of life, david.
LEADFEMALE:I mean you're a good-looking kid.
LEADFEMALE:She may have dreams about you.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:What's going on? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I feel a lot better.
LEADFEMALE:I can go now.
LEADMALE:Oh, we just wanna tell david that we're all okay with his dream, right, dan? Well, if you say so.
OTHERMALE:I mean, the only important thing is that you're, you know, not considering acting on your impulses.
LEADMALE:I would never.
LEADFEMALE:Everever.
SUPFEMALE:I mean we are talking about a married woman here.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, roseanne, can i see you in the kitchen? why, did you get your water dish stuck under the stove again? No, i think it's good that you talk about things, 'cause, uh a lot of guys might have kept something like that to themselves.
SUPMALE:Rosie, you okay? No, i'm not okay.
OTHERMALE:This is horrible.
LEADFEMALE:What are we gonna do? what choice do we have? You gotta give yourself to him.
OTHERMALE:It's not funny, dan.
SUPMALE:How am i gonna go out there and face him when i know he's probably picturing me in my terrycloth robe? Just ignore him.
LEADMALE:Then he'll think i'm playing hard to get.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, roseanne, it's just a stupid dream.
LEADMALE:When you thought he was dreaming about becky, it was no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, 'cause there's no threat with becky.
OTHERMALE:She's happily married woman.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, if this is such a problem for you, maybe david should move out.
LEADFEMALE:Where could he go? The only place that'd take him in would put him to sleep in 5 days.
OTHERFEMALE:You're overreacting.
OTHERMALE:It's perfectly normal for a teenage boy to have sex dreams about his girlfriend's mother.
LEADMALE:I mean, even mark might have-hey! You finish that sentence, i'll rip your heart out.
SUPMALE:Someone's sensitive.
SUPMALE:Well, how come when you thought it was about becky you were so upset, and then when it turns out to be about me you think it's so funny? Okay, i'm gonna tell you something, and i want you to keep in mind the reason i'm telling you this is to show how normal david is and not that i'm some sort offreak.
LEADMALE:What? what is it? Well, first, you gotta promise that you won't make fun of me or get all weird.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I swear on the thing dearest to both of our hearts: that expensive smoked cheese log we got hidden in the fridge 'til the kids move out.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:When we were dating, i had a dream, a very short one, about your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Uggh! that's disgusting, dan! How could you compare the beautiful thing david and i have to that? Roseanne, you can't go and tell anyone about this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna tell anybody.
SUPFEMALE:So this is just like all teenage boys have these kind of dreams about their girlfriend's mothers? Girlfriend's mothers, their mother's friends, their friend's girlfriends, all the girls on the block, all the girls on tv all the rest of 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Men are so sick.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:Don't women dream about their boyfriend's fathers? No, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Unlike men, women do not have to be disgusted to get excited.
OTHERMALE:No, david, you're not dreaming, i'm really here.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Connor, listen, i really want to apologize to you.
LEADFEMALE:You have to know that i would never think of anything like that-david! The whole idea is just so gross.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, stop, right now.
OTHERMALE:That was just a dream which you could not control, unlike what you are saying to me now.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I don't know what i'm saying.
OTHERMALE:I'm the worst person in the world.
SUPMALE:I don't know what's wrong with me.
SUPMALE:I'm--i'm sick.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're not sick, david, you're a normal teenage boy.
LEADFEMALE:But i can understand how you get the two confused.
SUPMALE:No, this is not normal.
LEADMALE:Yes, it is.
SUPMALE:A lot of, you know, guys fantasize about older women that are, you know really hot.
LEADMALE:Where'd you hear that? Well, you gotta promise not to tell.
LEADFEMALE:Uh well, i--i saw it on oprah.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah! Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, they had this guy on there.
SUPMALE:You know, big guy, a real, kind of macho, blue-collar type of guy, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Not much to look at.
OTHERFEMALE:But, uh for some reason, he had this incredibly gorgeous wife, you know? And he said that he had these dreams about her mother, and her mother was a big old hag.
SUPFEMALE:But see, this is different.
LEADFEMALE:How? Because that guys was talking about his girlfriend's mother, and i just--i don't think of you that way anymore.
LEADMALE:You don't? No.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i think of you as-what? I kinda think of you as, you knowmy own mother.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you do? Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I've lived here, what, 2 years, and you've taken better care of me than my own mother ever did.
SUPFEMALE:David, i think it's great that you think of me as your mother.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:See? It just makes this whole dream thing much, much worse.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No, it doesn't, david.
LEADFEMALE:'cause you know uh, sex dreams, they're really rarely ever about sex anyway, you know? Maybe you're just feeling like you want a puppy.
SUPFEMALE:Where did you get that? Uh from the oprah show.
OTHERMALE:You know--well, they had this woman on the panel, right next to that big guy-you know, this kinda skinny expert type.
SUPFEMALE:Reminded me of barney fife, actually.
LEADMALE:Uh, and she said that, you know, sex dreams are really not about sex, they're just about yearning for, uh, affection.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And you think she knew what she was talking about? Well, she was an expert, david.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Connor, i can't tell you how much better that makes me feel.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's good.
LEADMALE:That's great.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, so-can i have a hug now or what, i gotta get you drunk first? I'm so glad that you think about me as your mother, david.
LEADMALE:Well, i really do, mrs.
LEADMALE:Connor.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want me to start calling you mom? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like the other kids to start calling me mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:And i'd like you to start calling me pickles.
LEADMALE:I told you when you moved in you were gonna have trouble with the pipes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and 20 years later, it happens.
LEADFEMALE:Eerie.
SUPMALE:Hi, becky.
LEADMALE:Hey, grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Is david around? Uh, becky, hold on a sec.
LEADFEMALE:Uhmom.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, d.j. made you the cutest little ashtray upstairs.
LEADMALE:You really should go up there and take a look at it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't smoke! I know that, but he does.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go up there and take a look at the ashtray.
LEADMALE:Okay, roseanne, i'll play along.
LEADMALE:I will now leave you and becky alone as i go to d.j. 's room to look at the ashtray.
LEADFEMALE:I have such fun in your little kingdom of make-believe.
OTHERMALE:What's going on? Well, i talked to david about his dream.
SUPFEMALE:I knew it! You always have to butt in on things that aren't about you.
LEADMALE:This is between him and me.
OTHERMALE:The dream was about me.
LEADMALE:It was? Yeah, it seems that i'm what all the teenage boys are into this year.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I guess it was pretty silly of me to think that it could have possibly been about me.
OTHERMALE:Well, don't feel bad, becky.
SUPMALE:Someday you'll fill out, too, and then all the boys will want you.
OTHERFEMALE:Just shut up, mother.
OTHERMALE:Is there something going on between you and david? No, there's nothing going on-i'll put it a different way.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like there to be? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i didn't until-well, he had that dream about me-or i thought he did.
SUPFEMALE:And now i feel kinda i don't know.
LEADMALE:Does anything in the "stupid" category come to mind? Look, i don't need your help with this, mother.
LEADMALE:I can deal with this myself.
OTHERMALE:Deal with what yourself? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't want to know anyway.
LEADMALE:Okay, she's gone.
LEADMALE:You can tell me.
SUPFEMALE:No, dan, she trusted me with something private.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you would appreciate the fact that i can keep a confidence.
LEADMALE:I saw becky leave the kitchen.
SUPMALE:So i suppose i'm done looking at the ashtray.
OTHERFEMALE:Mother harris.
LEADMALE:Oh, dan.
LEADMALE:I know you've been doing some plumbing around here, and i was thinking while you're still in the monkey-wrench mood, you might come by tomorrow and put in my new garbage disposal.
LEADMALE:Okay, bev, i can do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's a date.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you tomorrow.
SUPMALE:And after you're done with the disposal, i was thinking you and i could have some sex.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:So, fred and i were talking, and we decided this year for halloween instead of candy, we're gonna give out carrot sticks.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, we're going healthy, too.
SUPFEMALE:We're giving out filtered cigarettes.
LEADMALE:Hey, rose.
LEADMALE:Trick or treat, honey.
SUPMALE:No, she don't turn tricks at work no more.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get your lunches.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if it's noon and it's 40 pounds, it must be the city garage boys.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, fred.
SUPFEMALE:Leon.
LEADMALE:Your fries will be out in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i don't know how you eat like this and still maintain that body.
SUPFEMALE:Ha haha.
LEADMALE:Just lucky, i guess.
OTHERMALE:Right, honey? I'd have to say she's the lucky one.
LEADMALE:Well, remember, ladies, we close at 2:00 tomorrow so i can prepare for my halloween soiree.
LEADFEMALE:You might want to use that time to work on your costumes because this is not going to be one of your lame little lodge parties.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, our lodge parties were not lame.
LEADFEMALE:The cops had to come every year.
LEADMALE:Please, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone knows that halloween is our holiday.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe the breeders are trying to take back halloween.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please.
OTHERFEMALE:I was doing halloween since before there even were any gay people.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, leon is the queen of halloween.
SUPMALE:You wish.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the queen of halloween.
OTHERFEMALE:And i am not about to give up my crown to any mary come lately.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i certainly hope that you can make the party.
LEADMALE:I don't think so, i'm really not much for parties, and besides, i have a thing.
LEADMALE:Well, that's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:They're looking for guys with things.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't worry, big guy.
LEADMALE:We don't bite.
LEADFEMALE:Hard as it is not to sometimes.
LEADMALE:You know, leon, i'm not coming to the party.
OTHERMALE:If i did come, i'd come with my wife who i sleep with, and i have sex with.
LEADFEMALE:Lots of sex.
LEADMALE:The old-fashioned way.
SUPFEMALE:So just give me some space.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:Ha.
SUPFEMALE:Methinks young fred doth protest too much.
LEADMALE:What's he mean? Well, you know what they say about guys who whine about gay men.
LEADMALE:No, what do they say? The squeaky wheel wants to get greased.
SUPMALE:Ooh, ooh, ooh.
OTHERMALE:Ghosts, goblins, and ghouls.
LEADMALE:Spooky, spooky.
OTHERMALE:Mom, shouldn't you be home, drinking alone? Fyi, nancy's fixing me a takeout, and you're not the only prankster afoot this year.
LEADMALE:I've cooked up a little scheme for each of my daughters, so boogie, boogie, boogie.
OTHERMALE:I hope you're not going to fake your death again this year, god, that was such a disappointment.
OTHERMALE:Why, roseanne, i see you're already getting into costume.
SUPFEMALE:You got a big patch of gray right there.
SUPMALE:Oh, i get it.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:My hair's gray, my refrigerator's running, i have prince albert in the can.
SUPFEMALE:God, will it never cease with you, mother? Oh, piffle.
SUPMALE:That gray hair certainly isn't my work.
LEADFEMALE:My little trick on you will put the "o" in halloween.
SUPMALE:Here you go, bev.
OTHERFEMALE:We ran out of napkins, so i threw in a couple of extra buns for you.
LEADMALE:If i'm going to eat all this, i certainly don't have room for this can of peanut brittle.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you used to be so fond of it-oh, hey! Mom and we got you your favorite macadamia nuts.
OTHERFEMALE:Macadamia nuts.
SUPMALE:They are, you know, my absolute favorite.
LEADMALE:Yummy, yummy, yum-oh, snakes! ah! fine! You've ruined an old woman's prank.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you're happy.
LEADMALE:Why must you torment me? why? Well, mom's crying.
LEADFEMALE:Halloween has officially begun.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you let mom talk you into coming to her old biddy salon.
SUPMALE:Look at these women.
LEADFEMALE:You know,they say your hair keeps growing after you die, and apparently it's true.
LEADMALE:Hey, jackie! kyle! Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Mwah.
LEADFEMALE:Mwah.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you, girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you.
SUPMALE:Is that your old boyfriend? No, that's a buddy of fred's.
OTHERFEMALE:I think they play softball together.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? was fred pitching or catching? You know, leon is wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Fred does not have a problem with gay people.
LEADFEMALE:He's been friends with kyle for years.
OTHERMALE:Kyle: doll, those streaks are to die! Well, maybe he just didn't know that he was gay.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, i'm antonio.
OTHERFEMALE:How much color are we talking today? Well, not a lot.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to go back to my natural color-hawaiian.
SUPMALE:Boy, you really do have a lot of gray up there.
SUPMALE:Our mother went gray very suddenly.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That was the day she found my underwear in the glove compartment.
SUPFEMALE:No, what i meant is hair is hereditary on the mother's side, so whatever happened to your mom is probably going to happen to you.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to find a buffalo head nickel and talk about it for 25 years.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, look at these.
LEADFEMALE:I guess there's worse things than going gray.
LEADFEMALE:That looks just like mom's hair.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, that is exactly like mom's hair.
LEADFEMALE:Same exact color.
LEADMALE:Same exact style.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, that is mom's hair! Our mom wears a wig.
LEADFEMALE:You think she's bald? No way.
SUPMALE:If she's bald, that means that we could go bald.
SUPFEMALE:This is her hair.
LEADMALE:Look--look at this.
OTHERMALE:Oh, roseanne! A woman of your size shouldn't wear horizontal stripes.
LEADFEMALE:You should wear black or stay home.
LEADFEMALE:And another thing, dear.
SUPFEMALE:I don't mean to alarm you, but i think your little d.j. might be retarded.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mark, how come everybody's talking about leon's halloween party like it's gonna be so different? what's the big deal? Well, see, there are going to be a lot people there that are you know, sort of--uh d.j. , get out of here now.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Mark, that's terrible.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just tell him the truth? 'cause i can't tell him about that.
LEADMALE:Any guy who's comfortable with himself doesn't have a problem talking about this.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , sit down.
LEADFEMALE:What mark meant to tell you is that leon's party is gonna be different 'cause theres gonna be a lot of gay people there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:What does gay mean? Uh well, that's a fine question, d.j. um, see, sometimes boys have boyfriends, and, uh, sometimes girls have girlfriends, and these people are called gay.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i have boys who are friends.
SUPFEMALE:What's the difference? All right.
LEADFEMALE:Um see, uh, boys who have boyfriends do things with-with their friends that a boy who has a friend who just happens to be a boy would probably never do.
SUPMALE:I don't understand.
LEADMALE:Yeah, me, neither.
LEADFEMALE:See when two men love each other, they, uh, like everybody else, they like to share each other's feelings for one another through beautiful expressions of, uh physical love.
LEADFEMALE:How do they do that? If a guy's comfortable with himself, he isn't afraid to talk about this, you fruit.
SUPMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Uh see one guy will, uh uh, he and the other guy they, uh see, what they do is, uh oh, god, i don't know what they do! Leave me alone, d.j. that was great.
LEADMALE:I thought he was going to start crying.
SUPMALE:Let's go down to the arcade.
LEADFEMALE:We can listen to it again on the way.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan: yeah, how's it going? hey, how you doing? Good to see you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, how you doing, bud? Roseanne, i think these guys are checking me out.
LEADMALE:No one can tell we're a couple.
LEADFEMALE:Our costumes should have had a theme.
OTHERMALE:They do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm prince, and you're the duke.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, cowboy.
SUPFEMALE:Diana ross just winked at me.
LEADFEMALE:Really? It's a guy, dan.
LEADFEMALE:That can't be a guy.
SUPMALE:He's got breasts.
LEADMALE:Really beautiful breasts.
LEADMALE:Well, sure, they're beautiful now, but just wait till he has a couple of kids.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, there's mom.
SUPFEMALE:Look, i told you that that hair cannot be real.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Even william shatner would make fun of that piece.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:It's the same hair she's always had.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that is precisely my point.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, her face looks like a dried-up old apple, and she's got the same hairdo for 20 years.
LEADMALE:Go over there and start talking to her and distract her so i can get in there for a closer look.
LEADMALE:Aw, don't make me talk to her.
SUPMALE:How about if i just knock her unconscious, and you rip her hair off? Yoo-hoo, roseanne! Forget about going bald.
LEADFEMALE:Worry about inheriting that voice.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think of my hobo costume? Well, i think it's great, but, um, you should let me straighten up your hair 'cause it's kinda messy.
OTHERMALE:It's supposed to be messy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a vagabond.
SUPMALE:I ride the rails and live by my wits.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but let me straighten it 'cause it's tilted.
LEADMALE:I do not need your help.
LEADMALE:Well.
OTHERMALE:Well, your party is in full swish.
SUPMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:All in purple, let me guess.
LEADFEMALE:You're either one of the california raisins or barney.
LEADMALE:And i know who you are.
LEADMALE:You're becky's gym teacher.
SUPMALE:No, i think you know who i am.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? Many in washington feel i have too much power, and i control the president.
LEADMALE:Hmm? I always wear sensible but feminine dresses.
LEADFEMALE:J.
LEADFEMALE:Edgar hoover? No.
LEADMALE:I'm hillary rodham clinton.
LEADMALE:Hoover would never wear taupe.
LEADMALE:He was an autumn.
LEADFEMALE:Happy birthday mr.
LEADMALE:President happy birthday to you mwah.
SUPMALE:I love you, jack.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you supposed to be? Let me give you a hint.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye, norma jean.
LEADMALE:Holy rented costumes, batman.
LEADMALE:It was the only way i could get him to come.
LEADMALE:He thinks a superhero costume makes him look macho.
LEADMALE:Fred, stop hiding behind the cape.
LEADMALE:I don't want these guys checking out my utility belt.
LEADMALE:Hey, fred.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how you doing? can we go now? No! We're having fun.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going, fred? Hey, dave.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:That's a great costume, uh, dave, is it? Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:How long have you known fred? I used to know him before he stopped coming to the bars and everything.
SUPMALE:Are you trying to tell me that fred is gay? Honey, i can't believe he's trying to be straight.
SUPMALE:Ok, guys and gals, you know what time it is.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Are we going to cane somebody? No, it's limbo time.
LEADFEMALE:Have you seen fred? Um, no.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh-i have to find dan.
OTHERMALE:Dan: the old squad had this crab-style, it was just, bop! Dan, dan, dan, i gotta see you alone in the kitchen right now.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, sure, little lady.
SUPFEMALE:This cowpoke wouldn't mind a little ride on the range.
LEADMALE:Oh! Dan, fred is gay.
LEADFEMALE:What? I was just talking to this diana ross guy, and he said that fred used to be gay.
LEADFEMALE:Fred? Fred's not gay.
OTHERMALE:Fred is gay, ok? He's the gayest.
SUPFEMALE:He's gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.
LEADFEMALE:I get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Old danny boy's not falling for the old fred-is-gay prank.
LEADMALE:You did a lot better when you got that doctor to tell your mom she only had a week to live.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, that is not my prank because this is my prank.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, good prank, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner, can i get down now? I can't feel my toes.
SUPMALE:Shut up! Now do you believe me? First of all, i don't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:Second of all, it's none of your business.
LEADMALE:Jackie has to know, dan.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you can go stick your head in the sand all you want, but i would not do it around fred if i was you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, hey, leon, where's jackie and fred? Uh, fred ran out, and jackie ran after him.
SUPFEMALE:I think the caped crusader was afraid of being unmasked.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, leon, put a sock in it.
SUPFEMALE:Don't need to.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? what are you doing here? Um, well, i heard that you and fred ran out of the party, and so, i was just kind of worried.
LEADFEMALE:Are you guys ok? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:He went straight to bed.
LEADMALE:I don't--something upset him at the party.
LEADMALE:Well, i want to ask your advice about something.
SUPFEMALE:Um, at the party tonight, you know? there was this guy, you know? And, um, i, um-i found out that he's really gay.
LEADMALE:And, i mean, he's a nice guy, see, but he's married.
LEADFEMALE:And i don't think he's told his wife the truth.
SUPMALE:Oh, wow.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:So, do you think i should tell her? Well, i don't know.
SUPFEMALE:That's a hard one.
LEADMALE:No, i wouldn't.
LEADMALE:Well, i would.
SUPMALE:Fred is gay.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? just a lot of guys at the party, they know fred, like you know him, you know? I mean, a different side of him.
OTHERFEMALE:That's ridiculous! Please.
LEADFEMALE:There is no way that fred could be gay.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there are certain things that a wife knows about her husband.
LEADMALE:Ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Just think about it for a minute, jackie.
LEADMALE:Haven't you ever noticed anything a little odd about fred? No.
SUPMALE:Like what? Like when he came back from chicago with that haircut.
OTHERFEMALE:Fred likes to try new things.
LEADFEMALE:With his hair.
LEADMALE:Only with his hair.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, he's only slept with 3 women in his whole life, right? So that leaves a lot of free nights.
LEADFEMALE:And you know that he's always admired your boyish figure.
OTHERMALE:That doesn't prove anything, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Didn't he take you to see that's entertainment, part iii? Oh, my god! Go away.
OTHERMALE:Go away! Leave us alone.
OTHERMALE:We are as god made us.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, ho, ho! We're everywhere, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, i propose a toast to the all-time greatest prank in the history of the universe.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, come on.
LEADMALE:Come on back.
LEADFEMALE:Think we went too far? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you think we should have worn pants? Not now, fred.
SUPFEMALE:We'll talk about it in the shower.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie! Come on, don't be mad.
OTHERMALE:It was just a joke.
SUPMALE:Great pictorial for the employee newsletter.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan, if you're still gay, i could go for a mimosa and some eggs florentine.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't cook for you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fred's bitch.
LEADFEMALE:Admit it, roseanne.
SUPMALE:We got you.
SUPFEMALE:You were totally freaked.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, the really amazing thing was not that dan was gay, but that he would be attracted to fred.
SUPFEMALE:I have a bone to pick with you, missy! You know, mom, no one writes letters anymore.
LEADMALE:And i think you're just the person to revive that lost art.
SUPMALE:I understand that you went to my beauty parlor yesterday and asked antonio about my hair.
SUPFEMALE:You went back there? Oh, chill out, mom.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't tell me anything.
LEADMALE:You've got the only hairdresser in town that doesn't dish.
SUPFEMALE:How could you do something like that? i mean, it's one thing to embarrass me in front of my family, but in front of my hairdresser? i mean, don't you have any decency? How dare you! Well, mom, it's no big deal.
OTHERMALE:I was just curious.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you really want to know what's going on under this hair? you want the truth? Well, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Face your future, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Aah! Don't feel bad, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You won't be bald alone.
LEADMALE:I'm with you, too, sis.
LEADMALE:Ah ha ha! God, mom, i didn't know that you had that in you.
LEADFEMALE:Admit it, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You're not the cleverest trickster in this family anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha ha! Well, i guess you guys showed me this halloween, didn't you? In my kitchen.
SUPMALE:I'm just so ashamed.
SUPMALE:I have nothing to top that with.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Except for 
OTHERMALE:Hey, busboy, where've you been? If i wanted to cook and clean and serve, i'd stay home.
SUPMALE:I was talking with my friends.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i don't want those hoodlums hangin' around here.
LEADMALE:They're scaring away the truckers.
LEADMALE:I hate it here.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just fire me? Because you're a tiny, little man and we're still hoping you might be magical.
LEADMALE:You know, roseanne, if he doesn't want to be here, we should just let him go.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want him hanging out with those hoodlums he's made friends with.
OTHERFEMALE:I figured if they see him in the apron they'll go back to wantin' to beat him up.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that makes the third bucket of lard that i have cleaned out of this grease trap.
LEADFEMALE:I swear to god, roseanne, it's like cleaning out one of your arteries.
LEADFEMALE:Bitch, bitch, bitch, that's all you ever are.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, i just don't understand how this thing can collect that much grease so fast.
LEADMALE:Would you shut up about that thing? we all take our own turn cleaning it out, you know? I haven't cleaned that grease trap out in over a year.
LEADMALE:Neither have i.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, that little boy just left this note on my napkin.
LEADFEMALE:"the big, scary one spits in the food.
OTHERFEMALE:" d.j. ! I think you should apologize to the woman.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i'm real sorry my mom does that to your food.
LEADMALE:Nice try, d.j. , but i'm still not gonna fire you.
LEADFEMALE:And the joke is on you because i do spit in the food.
OTHERMALE:Ugh, that grease trap is unspeakable.
LEADFEMALE:I have not felt this filthy since my last confession.
SUPFEMALE:You know, you're the only one who cleans that.
SUPMALE:Hey, d.j. , break time.
SUPFEMALE:What? what did the boy say? I said you're the only one who-don't listen to him.
SUPFEMALE:He's a hopeless alcoholic.
SUPFEMALE:My god, roseanne.
LEADMALE:This is the lowest thing you've ever done.
LEADMALE:No, it's not.
LEADMALE:You know the tip jar-that's it, d.j. , you're fired.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mom! Your black skirt with the really long slit in it? I--i don't think that's too revealing.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, i'll come over at 7:00 and we'll walk over together.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Don't forget, city's got a leash law.
SUPMALE:That was no dog.
SUPFEMALE:That was diana-what the hell's she going out with you for? Because i'm cute.
LEADFEMALE:You are not.
SUPMALE:I am so.
OTHERFEMALE:Ever since i broke up with darlene and became all miserable, tons of girls have been flirting with me.
LEADFEMALE:They say i have the sad, sensitive thing going.
LEADMALE:Yeah? They can feel sorry for you when they're nailing real guys.
LEADMALE:Actually, i'm jealous of you, mark.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i'll have to sleep with dozens of women, sometimes two at a time, while you have the security of sleeping with the same woman every night till the day you die.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm glad you're laughing, 'cause i was worried that you'd be all bummed out about darlene moving in with that jimmy guy she's been seeing.
LEADFEMALE:You're lying.
LEADMALE:Wait, becky didn't tell you about that one? Oops.
LEADMALE:They hardly know each other.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, seeing each other naked every day ought to change that.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? Those girls are right.
LEADMALE:You are cute when you're miserable.
LEADMALE:George, that's mark.
OTHERFEMALE:Mark, scram.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:I still can't believe you got me tickets to wrestlemania, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Thank you so much.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i really don't know how to thank you enough other than saying "thank you" like i just did right now.
LEADMALE:Yeah, okay, here's the thing.
SUPFEMALE:Yours is free, but for reasons that you're too young to understand, you need to sell d.j. his ticket for 20 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where's d.j. gonna get $20? Well, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I guess he'll just have to get a job.
LEADMALE:You should mention that to him.
SUPMALE:Well, what if he doesn't wanna go with me? You know, i don't think d.j. likes me very much.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's just 'cause you're really boring, but the tickets will change everything.
OTHERMALE:Hey, d.j. , look who's here.
LEADFEMALE:Get rid of him.
SUPMALE:Now, d.j. , that's not very nice.
LEADFEMALE:George has something to ask you.
OTHERMALE:Okay, go ahead, and keep it short.
SUPFEMALE:Um, d.j. , do you wanna go to wrestlemania with me? I got these tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Um, now, the thing of it is, you gotta pay me $20.
LEADFEMALE:Or if you don't have a twenty, you could pay me two tens.
LEADMALE:Or a ten and two fives.
SUPFEMALE:Or four fives, which i'd prefer, 'cause you know i'm collecting them.
LEADMALE:You know, 'cause i like lincoln.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wow, d.j. tickets to the hottest event in town.
LEADMALE:Too bad you're broke.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not broke.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, i'll get my money.
LEADFEMALE:What? You're not supposed to have any money.
LEADFEMALE:You're unemployed.
LEADMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need your stinkin' job.
SUPMALE:I get an allowance from dad.
SUPFEMALE:Freeze.
OTHERMALE:I was just gonna get you something to hit me with.
SUPFEMALE:You can't go just givin' him money, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I want him to learn responsibility by working at the diner.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he's 13 years old.
LEADMALE:He's got plenty of time to learn responsibility.
SUPMALE:That is so wrong, dan.
SUPMALE:He is at a crossroads of his life where he can either become a total loser or a busboy.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, none of his friends have to work.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they will.
LEADMALE:Them license plates don't just make themselves, you know.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:From now on, no more allowance.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll just tell him we went broke again.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, you gotta get back the money you gave him.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do that.
SUPMALE:He'll hate me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, dan, if he hates you because you take back your money, then he wasn't that good of a friend in the first place, was he? See ya.
LEADMALE:D.j. , wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:I've been thinking, and i've decided it's not right for you to get money without working for it, so i want you to give me your allowance back.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, dan, that's not fair.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't have it anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:I gave it to george.
LEADFEMALE:Well then, you just have to give me your ticket.
LEADFEMALE:Now.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, d.j. you know, if it was up to me, i'd let you go in a second.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Now it is up to you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, no, dan.
LEADMALE:Remember? love, honor and obey? I'm forced to go along with you.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, just this once i think we'll let you be in charge.
SUPMALE:All right, here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good time.
SUPFEMALE:Your dad and i'll just be here waiting for you, alone together with no witnesses.
SUPMALE:Guys, wait up! Hey, jimmy, here's an interesting thing from psyche class.
LEADFEMALE:Just answer honestly.
SUPMALE:There's no right or wrong.
LEADMALE:Name three things that you like about yourself.
LEADMALE:Well, let's see, um i'd say i'm open-minded, i've got a good body, and, uh i'm a pretty nice guy.
SUPMALE:Fine, if you're not gonna take it seriously.
LEADMALE:Well, it's almost 2:00.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta run.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i got it darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Coffee's on me.
LEADMALE:Oh, i know.
SUPMALE:I was just getting a piece of gum.
SUPFEMALE:See you later.
SUPMALE:Hey, can i bum a stick? Uh, sure.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Is this seat taken? It's all yours.
LEADFEMALE:You're jimmy gartner, right? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Have we met? No, i'mcraig.
LEADFEMALE:Shapiro.
OTHERFEMALE:You go out with that darlene conner, right? Yeah.
SUPMALE:You know darlene? Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:She's great.
LEADFEMALE:Did you guys meet in her writing class or something? No, actually, we met at my dance recital.
LEADFEMALE:Really? so, you're, like, a dancer? like a ballet dancer? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ballet, jazz, tap.
SUPMALE:Tap? Tap's cool.
OTHERMALE:Are you, like, the only guy in the class or are there otherguys like you in the class? Actually, my boxing coach had me take ballet to help me with my footwork.
OTHERMALE:Boxing.
LEADMALE:You mean likehitting? how do you know darlene? I've--i've known her for a while.
LEADFEMALE:She's a very, very special girl.
LEADFEMALE:Just happy to know that she'sbetter.
OTHERMALE:Better? what do you mean? Nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I can't talk about it.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, it would break a confidence and what confidence? Well, see, uh, i'm a peer counselor and, uh never mind.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene went to a peer counselor? why? I can't divulge that information.
LEADFEMALE:There's a little thing called confidential--esness? so, are you guys serious? Yeah, we're thinking about moving in together.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:What? bad idea? No, no, i just i never thought she'd try that again.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Listen, i'm sorry i can't talk to you about darlene, but, you know, if you wanna talk about your feelings actually, this moving in thing together, it's a little scary, you know? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, it can be.
OTHERMALE:You don't think it's a good idea, do you? Oh, quite the opposite.
SUPMALE:I think it'll be a great test for darlene.
LEADMALE:And for you, well what doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
LEADMALE:Hey, david, where were you for dinner last night? Everybody picked the cauliflower out of their mixed vegetables, but you weren't here to eat it.
SUPFEMALE:Umi was-i joined a team at school.
OTHERFEMALE:A debate team.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, we had a game.
SUPMALE:Don't try to lie to me, david.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:You've got a new girlfriend, don't ya? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:How come she's such a huge secret? Uh, she's very-she's ugly.
OTHERMALE:How ugly? circus ugly? hey, david, where've you been? Dating a really ugly girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Good for him.
LEADMALE:Hey, d.j. , do you have enough room in those pants there? Don't tell me, you're the back of the horse.
LEADFEMALE:They're mine.
LEADFEMALE:Dad bought 'em for me.
LEADMALE:Well, isn't that sweet? Today my little boy is a crypt.
LEADMALE:No, he just wants to look good for his first day on the job.
LEADFEMALE:Really? you mean he's ready to come back to work? Oh, dan, tonight no foreplay.
SUPFEMALE:Well he's gonna be learnin' all about responsibility.
LEADMALE:Yep, just like you wanted.
OTHERMALE:He's coming to work with me at the garage.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that great? You're so delighted, you could barely speak.
LEADFEMALE:You're rewarding me by making sloppy joes.
SUPMALE:And then now you're gonna put on something frilly for dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong? He won't be hanging out with those thugs.
LEADMALE:Why are getting so bent out of shape? Let's just drop it, dan.
LEADFEMALE:He's working for you and that is that.
OTHERFEMALE:And i hope the two of you have a very happy time together.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, are you jealous? Don't be ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:You're upset because he's spending time with me? No! I'm upset because he's not spending any time with me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey i thought you were worried about him becoming a delinquent.
SUPMALE:Oh, please, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I think you know me better than that.
LEADFEMALE:He can mug old ladies for all i care, as long as he comes home at the end of the day and tells me how it went.
LEADFEMALE:He loves you, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody loves me, dan.
LEADMALE:We're not talking about love.
LEADFEMALE:We're talking about time.
OTHERMALE:We used to do things together, you know? I'd cut his hair and we'd bake m&m cookies and we'd send pizzas over to the convent.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, mother-son type things.
LEADFEMALE:A 13-year-old boy doesn't have much in common with a 42-year-old woman.
LEADMALE:Actually, if he did, we'd be worried.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but he still likes you.
LEADFEMALE:You get to be the buddy and i'm stuck being the mom.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's just a phase.
LEADFEMALE:You'll have him back in a few years.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, well, after a few years with you, i ain't gonna want him back.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, jimmy.
OTHERMALE:Funny runnin' into you here.
LEADMALE:Yeah, just like the library yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:And the cafeteria and the bowling alley.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing how we just keep bumping into each other.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, listen, uh, i hope we can talk about something other than darlene this time, because last time i was pretty uncomfortable.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:So how's that whole thing goin'? Stop it.
LEADMALE:What? Look, i went to that peer counseling office.
OTHERMALE:They've never heard of you.
LEADMALE:Well, that's 'cause i do a lot of workundercover.
LEADFEMALE:Cut the crap.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i know you wanna break me and darlene up.
LEADMALE:I do not.
LEADMALE:Yes, you do, and i know why.
LEADMALE:I know your whole story, man.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I was just desperate.
OTHERMALE:Why'd you have to come on to me if you knew i was straight? what? you think i'm gay? what would make you think i'm gay? Come on, craig, it was pretty obvious the first time i met you.
LEADMALE:What made it obvious? A lot of things.
LEADMALE:A lot of things like what? Well, for one, you told me you were an artist.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're a ballet dancer, for god's sakes! you ever had your butt kicked by a ballet dancer? what are you doing here? wait a minute, you do know craig? this is craig? the gay guy that's been hitting on you? I am not gay! i want some answers! No, me first.
LEADFEMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, i wanna hear this.
LEADMALE:Sit down! Not you.
LEADFEMALE:Come here! What the hell are you doing here? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:When i heard that you guys might move in together, i felt like i had to do something.
LEADMALE:So you told my boyfriend you were a gay guy named craig? No, i didn't tell him i was gay, he could just tell.
OTHERMALE:I mean, no.
LEADMALE:You know what i mean.
LEADMALE:David, why are you messing with my life? I just didn't want you to move in with him.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to stop it.
SUPFEMALE:I can't even look at you.
LEADFEMALE:This is, like, the most pathetic thing you've ever done.
OTHERMALE:Is not.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, pal.
LEADMALE:If you weren't after me, why were you trying to break me and my girlfriend up? well see wow, who's he? Mm, i'm kinda nervous.
LEADFEMALE:I've never had a job interview before.
LEADMALE:I got all my other jobs when i was just walking by.
LEADFEMALE:So, tell us, ms.
LEADMALE:Flagler, why the lunchbox, why a busperson? Well, until my boyfriend's band gets a record deal, he thought i should work, 'cause, you know, he's never had a job before.
LEADMALE:And they say all the good ones are taken.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I'm really lucky.
LEADMALE:He says when he gets famous, he's gonna take care of me.
LEADMALE:Well, that is the good thing about rock stars: they're so loyal.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, ms.
LEADFEMALE:Flagler, this position requires someone with experience.
LEADFEMALE:Have you done anything prior to this in the bussing field? I think i can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, stacey, uh, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner and i always like to discuss the applicant before we reach a decision.
LEADMALE:If you will excuse us for one minute, we will retire to the area that we-like to call-those cannot be real.
SUPFEMALE:Think about it, jackie, she'd be really great for business.
SUPMALE:How do you figure? Wake up, jackie.
LEADMALE:Even i'm gettin' a woody.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:What do you want? Mom, i want my job back.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:I mean, i just hated working at the garage.
LEADMALE:All i did was move heavy boxes, so i quit.
SUPMALE:Well, d.j. , um, i don't know if i can take you back because we've already filled the position.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations, stacey, you got the job.
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, when does my insurance start? 'cause i need some shots.
LEADFEMALE:That's not fair; i just quit the garage! Well, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could use two buspersons around here, but i really don't know if i should hire you back after the way you were acting around here, d.j. i think, at least, you owe me an apology.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me you love me.
SUPMALE:What? Tell me you love me or no job.
LEADMALE:All right, i love you.
LEADMALE:Jeez.
LEADMALE:Great, that's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, welcome back.
SUPMALE:Well, do you think tonight you could go to a movie with me? Yeah, sure.
OTHERMALE:But, you know, d.j. , i don't approve of movies with sex and violence in 'em, so you'll just have to pick one or the other.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You get your job back? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You ask your mom to take you to the movies? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Good work.
LEADMALE:Well, how 'bout at the movie i have to buy some popcorn? Nice touch.
LEADMALE:You know, d.j. , you're really doing a good thing for your mom here.
SUPMALE:One day, you're gonna be really glad you came back.
LEADFEMALE:I'm already glad.
SUPMALE:Did you see the new busboy? ** you know, stacey, things have sure changed around here ever since you started workin' at the box.
OTHERMALE:Have they ever! What do you mean? Hello.
LEADMALE:Some sailors told me this was the place to come for a loose meat sandwich.
LEADMALE:My, you're certainly an attractive man.
SUPMALE:Too bad i'm married.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wait, i forgot.
OTHERMALE:I'm a huge slut.
SUPFEMALE:I've always been a nice girl.
LEADFEMALE:I wish someone could teach me to be bad.
LEADFEMALE:Oops i got whipped cream on your shirt.
SUPFEMALE:Let me clean that up for you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And, you know, this belt doesn't really go with these pants.
SUPMALE:Would you like to hear about our three-for-one special? how would you like to get all hot and sweaty and gooey and slippery? Man, don't you guys ever clean this thing?
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Are you sure you want to go on this parents' weekend? I'll be here all alone.
LEADMALE:I'll miss you.
SUPFEMALE:There's a 12-pack chillin' in the fridge.
SUPFEMALE:And you are? Now, don't you go calling darlene and tipping her off that i'm headed down there.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to meet this jimmy guy she's going with, and i do not want to give her time to sober him up and hide his kids.
LEADMALE:Hey! Why aren't you wearing any shoes, boy? I don't want to wear shoes.
SUPMALE:Well, you're gonna.
SUPFEMALE:We've been wearing shoes in this family for two generations.
SUPFEMALE:Well, this big kid said he'd beat me up unless i gave him my shoes.
SUPFEMALE:Mark, will you come to school with me tomorrow and beat him up? It wouldn't be a fair fight for me to beat up a 12-year-old.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you ask david? Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll teach you how to fight.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to learn! Uh, mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, uh, do you think you couldpossibly i don't know.
LEADMALE:Is there any way you could teach me how to fight, too, maybe? Sure, david.
LEADFEMALE:I could teach you a few things.
OTHERMALE:Some of the old patented dan conner moves.
OTHERMALE:Whoop! boom-boom-boom! But that would be wrong.
LEADMALE:Why? Well, i-i have my reasons, and those reasons are plentiful and mysterious.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Thanks anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Do i get to know my reasons? Okay.
LEADMALE:Darlene's going out with this boxer, right? So david thinks if he gets to be a tough guy that darlene will want him back.
SUPFEMALE:See, david needs to find somebody that will love him for just being david, you know? He shouldn't have to be thinking about changing.
SUPFEMALE:So while i'm gone, your mission, should you choose to accept, is to make david feel good about being david.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:By the way, can you tell me some things about being david that he could feel good about? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you know, there'shis drawing, you know, his art, and, uh he sits in front of the tv for a long time, so he's got a very good long attention span.
LEADFEMALE:Groovy.
LEADFEMALE:I can work with that.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye, house! Bye, mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Dan, i'll be counting the kids when i come back.
LEADMALE:We better not be missing more than a couple of them.
OTHERMALE:Hey, david, that's really good! What is that, a horse? No, it's not just a horse, mr.
SUPMALE:Conner, it's supposed to represent power and movement and freedom.
OTHERMALE:See, i'm trying to show the wild spirit that's inside of all of us that we're afraid to acknowledge.
OTHERMALE:He got a name? ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Why don't you move this table saw into the corner, deej? I don't want to hit my head on anything when you knock me down.
SUPFEMALE:Heh heh heh heh.
LEADFEMALE:Good idea.
SUPMALE:We'll stretch first.
LEADMALE:You don't have to teach me how to fight.
LEADMALE:Oh, son, it's normal to be scared, even for a big, strong guy like you.
SUPMALE:But you can't give in to your fear, or you'll be afraid your whole life.
LEADMALE:I'm not afraid of this guy.
LEADFEMALE:I know just how to handle him.
LEADFEMALE:Show me.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna cry.
SUPFEMALE:You can't cry.
LEADMALE:Sure i can.
OTHERFEMALE:I can cry real good.
SUPFEMALE:And he'll look pretty stupid hitting a guy who's already crying.
OTHERMALE:Now, son fighting a bully is just a normal part of growing up and being a man.
OTHERMALE:So if i never fight him, i'll never be a man? Yeah, you'll be a man.
LEADMALE:You'll just be a man without shoes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i don't want to get hit.
LEADMALE:It'll hurt.
SUPMALE:Come on, d.j. i know a little pain doesn't bother you.
LEADMALE:I've seen you go to the doctor to get shots.
LEADFEMALE:I hate getting shots! Is it gonna hurt as much as getting a shot? Damn it, d.j. , when everybody finds out that you're not gonna fight, they're gonna come from all over to start picking on you.
LEADFEMALE:The glee club, the chess team, even the geeks that run the projector.
LEADMALE:What are you gonna do then? I'll do something.
SUPMALE:What? like what, huh? Stop it.
LEADFEMALE:Make me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:What are you gonna do? Fine.
LEADMALE:I give up.
LEADFEMALE:See? It works.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? hello? Oh, this is wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe you've got a key to darlene's apartment.
LEADMALE:Well, it's her own damn fault.
SUPFEMALE:She shouldn't have left her purse laying around the house.
SUPMALE:We're just gonna sit quietly and wait, okay? We're not gonna go snooping around.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Well, prepare yourself.
SUPMALE:It looks like they're serious.
LEADMALE:Jimmy keeps his shirt here.
SUPMALE:Guy is a monster! look at the size of that thing! hey, that's my shirt! She stole that from me.
OTHERMALE:I told you that guy was a bad influence on her.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you don't know that he's bad.
LEADFEMALE:She hasn't told me one thing about him, so every single thing i know i had to make up myself, and it's all bad, and that is no coincidence.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, that's crazy.
SUPMALE:If you're gonna be nasty to the guy, he's gonna clam up.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never find out what he's really like.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not going to pounce on him, jackie.
LEADMALE:I want him nice and relaxed when i kill him.
SUPFEMALE:Otherwise, it spoils the meat.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Surprise! Hi, aunt jackie.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? Well, it's parents' day, and your birth mother, morgan fairchild, couldn't make it.
LEADMALE:Oh, so you must be jimmy.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? Well, i'm darlene's mom.
LEADMALE:You told me your mother was dead.
SUPFEMALE:Why would you tell me your mother's dead? Stick around.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess she's just been trying to keep us apart, jimmy, and i really don't know why.
LEADFEMALE:I like you already.
OTHERMALE:I've always had a thing for a guy with pit stains down to his waist.
LEADFEMALE:I just came from ballet class.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, ballet.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you never told us he was dancer.
SUPMALE:Gee, it seems like maybe you're ashamed of him.
LEADMALE:I never said he was dead.
SUPMALE:Oh, this one, always with the jokes.
LEADFEMALE:I joke around, too, but i don't believe you have to be mean to be funny.
LEADFEMALE:I always told darlene i wish i'd met you before you-you know, passed away.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, and you would have loved me, jimmy.
SUPFEMALE:I was a wonderful woman whose greatest satisfaction in life came from talking about the lives of young people.
SUPMALE:So let's talk about yours.
OTHERFEMALE:She's offering you candy, jimmy.
SUPFEMALE:Don't get in the car.
LEADMALE:You ladies mind if i smoke? Oh, look, jackie, a smoker.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPMALE:And would you look at the way he handles that thing like he's been doing it since he was 10.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:So you're cool with this? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Hey, if i wasn't pregnant, i'd be sitting there right on that bed gunning sticks with that boy all day long.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I can play this game, too.
LEADFEMALE:Me and jimmy will sit around with my cool mom, and we'll all get along great.
LEADFEMALE:I'll order pizza while mom cleans the bong.
OTHERMALE:Oh, how very humorous you are, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I know you don't really smoke.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're right, mom.
LEADMALE:This is my first cigarette ever.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, look.
OTHERMALE:Smoke rings.
LEADMALE:And you taught her all this, didn't you, you sweaty little freak? I ought to just snap your ears off and shove 'em in your pocket so you can hear me kicking your butt! Jimmy, i'd like you to meet my mother.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, whoo! I think the milk in your mom's breasts has expired.
SUPFEMALE:Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
SUPMALE:Yeah, they kinda lose that new car smell after a while, don't they? Aw, don't cry, baby.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Let me show you a little trick.
SUPMALE:Ah-za-za-za-za-zaba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! ba-ba-ba-ba! Wow.
LEADMALE:You're good at this father stuff.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and if you build up enough static electricity, he'll stick right to the wall.
LEADMALE:Hey, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, i was wondering.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think there's any way i could get a motorcycle? I've been thinking about either a harley davidson or a hog.
SUPMALE:Hogs are harleys.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:That's probably why the guy at the store laughed at me, huh? David, i know why you're doing this.
SUPFEMALE:You think having a bike will make you look all tough.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:That's not true, no way.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, unless it had, like, big flames painted on the side.
LEADMALE:You had a bike when you were his age.
OTHERMALE:Chicks love a guy on a bike.
LEADMALE:David doesn't want the kind of girl a motorcycle will attract.
OTHERMALE:If you don't believe me, take a good long look at mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you'd like the idea.
OTHERMALE:You don't want him to get a bike because you think roseanne won't approve.
LEADMALE:Pfft.
SUPMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Let me let you in on a little-known secret, fred.
LEADFEMALE:You know how around here it always looks like roseanne's in charge of the kids, and i'm just along for the ride? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Flip it.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Really? It's true, fred.
LEADMALE:You see, in this case, david's trying to be a tough guy, just like darlene's new boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:And my years of experience tell me that david has to feel good about being david.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, will you be my dad? d.j. ! Yeah? That big kid took my pants.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
OTHERMALE:Put these on.
SUPMALE:It wasn't my fault! i don't want to hear about it! you don't know what it's like being hit with your own pants! Hey, shouldn't you have told him to fight back? Au contraire, mon fred.
LEADMALE:If i'd confronted the boy, he would have released his anger at me.
SUPMALE:This way, he'll direct it at the bully where it belongs.
SUPMALE:You're amazing.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Just a parent.
OTHERMALE:A parent who goes from town to town helping out, then moving on.
LEADMALE:My only hope: that kids are raised just a tiny little better because i was there.
LEADMALE:Hey! hey, d.j. , stop it! help me! somebody get him off me! d.j. , what the hell are you doing? God, this feels great! Now i know why that kid took my shoes.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , what's the matter with you? man, what happened? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. accidentally knocked him down.
OTHERMALE:He's lying.
SUPMALE:I kicked his butt.
SUPFEMALE:Here, i'll show you again.
LEADMALE:That's enough.
SUPMALE:He caught me off-guard.
LEADMALE:What, did he hit you while you were knitting? I wasn't gonna pick on some little kid.
LEADMALE:"i wasn't gonna pick on some little kid.
SUPFEMALE:" mark, out! d.j. , upstairs! Careful, david.
LEADMALE:I hear there's a 7-year-old roaming around the neighborhood just looking for trouble.
OTHERMALE:Y-you need some ice? Boy, david's really upset.
SUPFEMALE:What are you gonna do, dan? why do you keep asking me what i'm gonna do? what is it with you and all the questions? why can't a guy do what he's gonna do without being asked? you don't know what to do, do you, dan? just been doing what roseanne told you to do, haven't you? you're really a very bad father, aren't you, dan? No, i'm not.
LEADMALE:I just don't know what to do with david.
LEADFEMALE:He scares me, fred.
SUPFEMALE:He's probably down there right now crying or reading or drawing a horse.
OTHERMALE:Well, why don't you do what you were trying to do before? You know, raise his self-esteem.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know how to give a 17-year-old who's just been beaten up by a 12-year-old self-esteem.
SUPMALE:I don't even know how to give him hope.
LEADFEMALE:Tell him that getting beaten up by a little kid is not gonna make him any less attractive to darlene or any other girl.
LEADFEMALE:That's good, fred.
SUPMALE:They say it's best to open with a joke.
LEADFEMALE:I mean it, dan.
LEADMALE:You don't have to be a big tough guy to be a man.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes the strongest guys are the ones who aren't afraid to be soft.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:But you know, if this doesn't work, i'm gonna have to kick the crap out of you.
LEADMALE:I really liked that recital, jimmy.
OTHERMALE:I've never been to a ballet before.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for taking us.
OTHERMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Too bad it had to end so soon.
LEADFEMALE:I still have some feeling in my left buttock.
LEADFEMALE:Now, roseanne, i know you enjoyed it.
LEADMALE:Well, it is every mother's dream to get a good look at her daughter's boyfriend's package.
SUPMALE:Very classy, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't making fun of his beard or anything.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i didn't realize that the amish were allowed to dance.
LEADMALE:Would you excuse us for a second? We want to buy a knickknack for the bathroom, and we need to see what the theme is.
LEADFEMALE:You--you have got to give jimmy a chance.
SUPFEMALE:You've been sniping at him all day.
SUPMALE:What's the matter, are you feeling left out? You're not being fair.
OTHERMALE:You expected some horrible guy, the opposite of david, and if anything, he's a lot like david.
SUPMALE:Well, if he's so much like david, then why doesn't she just date david? is that what this is about? You want her to be with david, so you don't like anybody.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't like anybody because i don't like anybody.
LEADMALE:You like david.
LEADMALE:Well, of course i do.
SUPMALE:He's the nicest boy in the world, and i think he was good for darlene.
LEADMALE:Well, jimmy might be good for her.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so what if he's not good for me? Well, darlene is gonna bring a lot of different guys into your life.
SUPFEMALE:You're not gonna love 'em all the way you love david.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, but we were just all so good together.
LEADFEMALE:She's not coming back.
SUPFEMALE:He's not coming back.
LEADMALE:You're the only one left in their relationship.
SUPFEMALE:Give jimmy a chance.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I guess a mother just never really gets over her daughter's first love.
LEADMALE:Well, i know what to get somebody for their bathroom next time we visit.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, renuzit.
LEADMALE:That's it, you know? You've been taking cracks at me and darlene all day.
LEADFEMALE:Now may not be the time.
LEADFEMALE:No, jackie.
LEADMALE:I'd like to hear what the lad has to say.
LEADFEMALE:I am not a lad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a man.
LEADMALE:I wish you'd treat me like one.
SUPFEMALE:You may talk this way to your family.
LEADMALE:When you're talking to me, i demand a little respect.
LEADMALE:Now i think you should leave.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha ha! ha ha ha ha! ha ha ha ha! Oh, isn't he the cutest? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Maybe i was wrong about him.
SUPFEMALE:This might actually turn out to be fun.
LEADMALE:Ahem.
OTHERMALE:Dance for me, boy.
LEADFEMALE:David? Hey, david.
LEADFEMALE:So how's it going? I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:You got nothing to be embarrassed about.
LEADMALE:So you lost a fight.
SUPMALE:It happens to a lot of guys.
SUPMALE:Happened to d.j. all the time-before he ran into you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks a lot.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, there's a lot of girls that aren't into this macho stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Look at those girls in playboy.
OTHERMALE:Their turn-ons are always poets and sensitive guys, crap like that.
LEADFEMALE:Just leave me alone.
LEADMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:Why can't you? I got a good reason, and that good reason's barreling right towards this house right about now about 70 miles an hour in a 55 zone, slurping a big gulp.
LEADFEMALE:So mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner is why you came down here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I was wondering.
OTHERMALE:What's that supposed to mean? Just get out, mr.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:There's no way i'm leaving now.
LEADFEMALE:I can throw you out if that's what it's gonna take.
LEADFEMALE:You done? Go to hell.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't talk to me that way.
LEADFEMALE:I came down here to help you, boy.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't pretend like you give a crap.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't respect me enough to give a crap.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking-i don't respect you? I'm leaving.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're not.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Why is this all of a sudden about me and you? I thought we were talking about darlene and you.
OTHERMALE:Right? Davidyou got to help me out here.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner's real good about figuring out people's feelings, but i'm not mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a regular person.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i know it's weird for you having me living in your house, especially now that i'm not going with darlene anymore.
LEADFEMALE:So? So i thought i'd make things easier for us.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Is that what all this talking about fighting and motorcycles was, to impress me? I thought it would make things less weird if we had stuff in common.
LEADFEMALE:You mean i figured it out? Hey, david, we don't have to like the same stuff for me to respect you.
OTHERMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:No, i-it's true.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, i mean, in high school, i used to be jealous of guys like you because i knew deep down they were better than me.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're making that up.
LEADMALE:Of course i am! But doesn't it prove how much i like you that i'd make up such a ridiculous lie? I just figured you were only letting me live here because mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner was making you.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, david, even if mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner wanted to throw you out, she'd have to throw me out first.
LEADFEMALE:And i may not look like much, but i'm wiry.
LEADMALE:You mean it? Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You're one of the conners now, huh? Abandon all hope.
LEADMALE:Sorry i took that swing at you.
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:We did something here that our family rarely does: solved a problem without the cops.
SUPMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I mean, i feel closer to you now.
SUPMALE:Yeah, me, too.
SUPMALE:Yeah, this is great.
OTHERFEMALE:And now that you know how i feel, mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner doesn't have to be the only one you can talk to in this house.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:When's mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner coming home? Soon! I'd better go see if she's almost here.
LEADMALE:This is good.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I got to hand it to you, dan.
LEADMALE:You got this parenting thing down.
OTHERMALE:You're a great father.
SUPMALE:Kinda like the great dantini.
LEADMALE:Come on, fred.
LEADMALE:You gonna talk or play ball? You know, none of us have ever beat you at anything.
LEADFEMALE:Not softball, fixing cars, not parenting, nothing.
LEADMALE:Uhh! Game over.
SUPMALE:Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, jocko.
SUPMALE:You got to win by two baskets.
LEADFEMALE:You said one.
SUPMALE:I changed my mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Guard me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna guard you, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I won.
SUPMALE:Hey, mama's boy.
OTHERMALE:Mama's boy.
OTHERFEMALE:You gonna cry? huh? Come on, mama's boy.
SUPFEMALE:Squirt me a few.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Let me see you cry.
LEADMALE:Come on, little girl.
LEADMALE:You're my favorite sister-in-law, fred.
LEADMALE:I swear to god, you're my sweetest little girl.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, i don't want you to think of me as your commander.
SUPMALE:I want you to think of me as well, god.
LEADMALE:Dan! kids! I'm home!
SUPFEMALE: jackie, do we have to watch this? Barney is making me very very intensely angry.
SUPMALE:It is important for andy.
LEADFEMALE:Unless you think that he would learn more watching baywatch.
OTHERMALE:Now, there's no point teasing the boy.
LEADMALE:He doesn't get to eat again for another hour.
LEADMALE:Jackie, guess who's come to visit? God, it's mom! Fred, hide, hide.
LEADMALE:Keep your voice down.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother knows about me, jackie.
OTHERMALE:You remember she was at our wedding? That old woman is not coming in here.
SUPFEMALE:I have told her before, if she wants to come over, she has to call first.
LEADFEMALE:That way, we have time to leave.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you should just let her in.
LEADMALE:Are you insane? There is a baby in here.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie?i know you're in there.
SUPFEMALE:I can see your filthy car in the driveway.
LEADMALE:Damn it! We have to start parking down the street.
LEADMALE:Jackie, i know you hate your mom, but i think you're being selfish.
LEADMALE:I am not.
LEADFEMALE:I never said you couldn't hate her too.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie! Fred? Well, i guess no one's home.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose i'll just wait it out in the cold until they show up.
SUPMALE:Burr.
SUPMALE:I wish i'd worn a sweater.
LEADMALE:Fred, turn on the sprinkler.
LEADMALE:This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:No, fred, please don't.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, jackie! Hi, bev.
SUPMALE:Come on in.
OTHERMALE:So, you are home.
OTHERMALE:Thank goodness i wasn't ed mcmahon with a million-dollar check or you two would've really missed the boat.
SUPMALE:Sorry, mom.
LEADMALE:We were taking a nap.
SUPFEMALE:Well, whatever you were doing, i can see you weren't busy cleaning.
SUPMALE:There's my little man.
SUPMALE:Come to grandma, fudgy-face.
SUPFEMALE:See, she's completely harmless.
OTHERFEMALE:It is like radiation, fred.
LEADMALE:It may take 20 years, but that baby is gonna pay the price for this exposure.
SUPMALE:** what are you doing? Oh, i got stuck making this costume for d.j. 's school play.
LEADMALE:I don't know why they can't just do oh, calcutta.
SUPMALE:Well, uh, mom stopped by the house again last night without calling first.
SUPFEMALE:I told you, a couple of loose wires in the doorbell and that'll fix her right up.
LEADFEMALE:Fred just lets her in the house.
OTHERMALE:On purpose.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want her around the baby, but fred is obsessed with our kid having a grandmother around all the time.
LEADMALE:So what's wrong with his mom? Oh-dead.
LEADMALE:Well, you know how men are when they have babies.
SUPFEMALE:They get all sentimental and everything.
LEADMALE:I remember when i had becky.
LEADMALE:Dan made me tell mom.
OTHERMALE:You know what fred needs? He needs to spend a little more time with mom.
LEADMALE:Hi, mom.
LEADMALE:Um, you know, last week me and fred were talking about great uncle saul and i couldn't remember whether he had shingles or phlebitis.
SUPMALE:Oh, the gout.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's fascinating.
SUPFEMALE:And i think fred would think it was fascinating too.
SUPMALE:You should give him a call.
SUPFEMALE:He's home right now.
OTHERMALE:Okay, i gotta go now.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh-ho-ho so, so nasty.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hey, lancelot, i finished your costume and i even put shoulder pads in it so you'll look nice and macho.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna be in that dumb play! well, fine, then you're gonna wear it to soccer practice! What's wrong with him? Well, apparently he has to kiss a girl in this play and he's really upset about it.
SUPMALE:I know what he feels like.
SUPFEMALE:They made me kiss a boy in a school play.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but nobody made you sleep with him.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what, they wouldn't have had to ask me twice.
LEADMALE:By the time i was 13, i had kissed 7 girls.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, two he wasn't related to.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, the teacher says he either kisses this girl or he's out of the play.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's not fair.
LEADFEMALE:He's just a little boy.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go talk to that teacher and tell her what she can kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan? yeah? you hate mom, don't you? Of course.
LEADFEMALE:God, i envy you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, kid, where's your teacher? I'll tell you for a buck.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i don't have a buck but how would you like a quarter shoved up your nose? you're d.j. 's mom, aren't you? Hi, i'm mrs.
OTHERMALE:Sims.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, i'm mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Can we talk? Certainly.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:Well, um you know, it's about that play that d.j. 's in, and he didn't know that he had to kiss somebody and he's really uncomfortable about it.
OTHERFEMALE:D.j. knew about the kiss.
LEADFEMALE:He did? Yes, that's why he wanted the part in the first place.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know how kids change their minds all the time.
OTHERMALE:I mean, he, uh-just last week, he hated all of us and he wanted to run away from home.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, this week, he, uh-i guess that's not a good example.
LEADMALE:D.j. said you didn't want him to kiss gina.
SUPMALE:I'll just put someone else in the part.
SUPMALE:Well, why can't you just cut the kiss out? I mean, if it didn't hurt my wedding ceremony, it ain't gonna hurt your play.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not going to change the entire play because of certain people's values.
LEADFEMALE:Well, um i guess if he's forced to kiss somebody, then i don't want him to be in the stupid play.
SUPMALE:Where should i put my costume, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Sims? why don't you just put it on the table, gina? uhthat wouldn't be the gina, would it? why? you can't tell them apart? Oh, you thought that that's why d.j. didn't want to-and then you thought i knew and that i supported that.
LEADFEMALE:I see a lot of this around here.
LEADMALE:It always starts with the parents.
LEADFEMALE:Dan we've got a problem.
LEADMALE:Nothing that six more of these won't cure.
SUPMALE:You know that gina girl in the play that d.j. doesn't wanna kiss? She's black.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so we've gotta make him kiss her.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody will think we're a bunch of racists.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , get down here! Well, slow down.
LEADFEMALE:We don't know that's why he won't kiss her.
LEADMALE:I'm sure he's got a very good reason.
LEADMALE:I don't care what his reason is.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody'll think it's 'cause she's black and then i will never be able to buy sheets again.
LEADMALE:Sit down; i wanna ask you some questions.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Your dad and i were wondering how come you don't wanna kiss that girl in the play.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Well, is it because you're just not ready to kiss girls yet? No.
LEADMALE:Is she mean to you? No.
LEADMALE:Is she gross? does she pick her nose and eat it? does she have bad breath? does she have a mustache? does she have a whole bunch of extra arms or something? Son, no matter what it is, you can tell us.
LEADMALE:Is it because she's black? it is, isn't it? Well, you'll be mad if i say "yes".
OTHERFEMALE:No, we won't.
SUPMALE:Yes, we will.
LEADMALE:I didn't raise you to be some little bigot.
LEADMALE:I just don't wanna kiss her! Hey, black people are just like us.
LEADFEMALE:They're every bit as good as us and any people who don't think so is just a bunch of banjo-pickin', cousin-datin', barefoot embarrassments to respectable white trash like us.
SUPMALE:I don't care.
LEADMALE:I'm not doing it.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, you are.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you're overreacting.
LEADMALE:D.j. , if you don't wanna kiss this girl, your mom and i won't force you to.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you're kissing that girl, you're doing the play, and that's all there is to it.
LEADMALE:Well, dad said i didn't have to and dad outranks you.
LEADFEMALE:Are you new? I'm not doing anything until dad says i have to.
SUPFEMALE:Well, isn't that great, dan? Let's just make it easy for our kid to be a bigot.
LEADMALE:Why don't you calm down? The subject is closed.
OTHERMALE:Kissing that girl is not gonna hurt him and that is exactly what he's gonna do.
OTHERMALE:I think you're being a little too hard on the kid.
LEADMALE:He grew up in lanford.
SUPFEMALE:It's only five percent black.
LEADMALE:And kissing's a new thing for d.j. it's only natural that he's not as comfortable kissing a black girl as one of his own.
LEADFEMALE:I did not say that.
LEADMALE:Well, at least now i know where he gets it.
OTHERMALE:I'm not a racist.
LEADMALE:Yeah, neither is your father! He always says he has no problem with the coloreds.
SUPMALE:I'm not my father! if i knew you was gonna be passing down your family's crap to my kids, i would not be having another one with you! yeah, well, d.j. 's got it easy! i'm supposed to kiss you tonight! I hate white people.
LEADFEMALE:So roseanne says i'm a bigot.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think i'm a bigot? If i say "yes", you'll stop doing the minstrel show.
LEADFEMALE:Knock it off, marvin.
SUPFEMALE:I'm serious.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she thinks that d.j. could be getting racist attitudes from me.
OTHERMALE:Dan, that's a pretty gray area.
LEADMALE:Personally, i probably would've felt the same way you did.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that makes me feel better.
SUPMALE:You're not a bigot, are you? The kid's just scared.
OTHERMALE:I don't think you should force him.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, man, any of you guys ever been with a black woman? well there was this one girl in atlantic city one time, looked just like that nurse, used to be on television, you know, that julia? I mean this girl had legs that went on-hey, chuck! Well.
LEADFEMALE:So, go on.
LEADFEMALE:Legs that go on forever and shewas a very lovely woman and we had a very nice time.
LEADFEMALE:You're a wild man, marvin.
LEADMALE:So, what's with the extra poker game this week? roseanne finally come to her senses and leave you? Believe me, if roseanne left me, you'd all be a lot prettier and the opening bet would be two panties.
LEADFEMALE:Well actually, chuck, me and the guys was just talking about something.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i should probably get your opinion about this.
OTHERMALE:What? Well, uh, d.j. 's in this play at school and he's supposed to kiss this girl, and he doesn't want to because she's black.
SUPMALE:Andi didn't think he'd be getting this stuff from me, but where else could he be getting it from? He could be getting that stuff from anywhere.
OTHERMALE:I mean, has he been talking to marvin? All right.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm serious, chuck.
OTHERFEMALE:I really want your opinion on this.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, my opinion is you should hold your cards where fred can't see 'em.
LEADFEMALE:No, i mean, you know, we don't know he's prejudiced.
LEADMALE:I mean, the kid is young, he hasn't had much exposure to other cultures.
SUPMALE:Other cultures? why? is the black girl from china? No, i just don't think you should force a kid to kiss someone that's-i mean, you know, you grow up in a certain-with other-this is a very gray area.
SUPMALE:Guys, help me out here.
LEADMALE:Personally, i don't think there could be a gray area when it comes to respecting human beings.
SUPMALE:Chuck, you understand what i'm saying here? wellyou're saying that it's okay that d.j. doesn't want to kiss this girl because she's black? No, i'm not--i'm not saying that at all.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but that's what you want me to say.
OTHERFEMALE:No! I mean, unless you really feel it.
LEADFEMALE:Man, why do you care how i feel so much more than everyone else? because i'm black? Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:So if i feel okay, all black people will feel okay 'cause we all the same? I would never say that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, of course not! Some of your best friends are black.
LEADMALE:Yes, you're one of my best friends.
LEADMALE:That's why you're here.
LEADMALE:Okay, then why is bob here? d.j. 's gotta kiss a dumb girl too? No offense, bob.
SUPMALE:Hey! Hey, hey, guys, this is supposed to be fun.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just play the damn game.
LEADFEMALE:Check.
LEADFEMALE:The pot's light.
LEADFEMALE:I'm wanna ante too.
SUPMALE:Who wants to open? Give me three.
LEADMALE:Two.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How's the comic book? This one guy just tore off the other guy's arm with his bare hands.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me see that.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, deej, uh you know, sometimes parents do certain things or they act a certain way and they don't realize it's wrong until they see their kids doing it.
LEADMALE:You understand? is this about peeing behind the garage? No, but stop doing it.
LEADMALE:You're killing the tomatoes.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, anyway, i think somewhere along the way here, i might have given you the wrong idea about black people.
LEADFEMALE:And your mom was right.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't wanna kiss gina! Hey, tough.
SUPFEMALE:You're doin' it.
SUPFEMALE:I hate you! well, fine! you don't have to kiss me! She just looks real different.
LEADFEMALE:It's only skin.
LEADMALE:It's not just her skin.
LEADFEMALE:She talks with kind of an accent and her hair's kinda different and her lips are different.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and, and you're probably different heights.
OTHERFEMALE:You know? And your hair's brown and your friend ralphy's hair is that red.
LEADFEMALE:My eyes are blue and your mom's eyes are whatever the hell color they are.
LEADMALE:What if it feels weird? Look, son i can't let you get out of this.
LEADMALE:Because that would be wrong.
SUPFEMALE:But i'm afraid of what the other kids will say.
SUPMALE:Oh, the other kids.
SUPMALE:Well, they're gonna be extremely jealous.
SUPFEMALE:Because you're a conner.
LEADFEMALE:And conner men are known as some of the world's best kissers.
LEADMALE:Okay, i'll do it.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:You know, d.j. , you're gonna kiss a lot of girls in your life and they're all gonna be different.
SUPFEMALE:Well, do you think i should even kiss lila matthews? what's different about her? Well, ralph says she uses her tongue.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd go for it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wow, roseanne, we had a great night.
OTHERMALE:What's so great about it? We had all them people to wait on.
LEADMALE:Well why don't we close up early, you know? 'cause it's only yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:What the hell.
LEADMALE:We opened 15 minutes late, so it'll all balance out.
SUPMALE:You know, i am really very proud of dan.
LEADMALE:Admitting that he was kind of prejudice.
LEADFEMALE:It just goes to show you're never too old to learn something new about yourself.
LEADMALE:Yeah, like, just the other day when i learned i was married to a cracker.
OTHERMALE:Lunchbox.
LEADMALE:Hi, fred.
LEADFEMALE:No, i think that's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
OTHERMALE:Mom loves to have company when she has a pedicure.
LEADMALE:Well, you two have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, i love you too.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, bye.
LEADMALE:Hope they file off a toe.
SUPFEMALE:Are harold and maude still seeing each other? It's--it's weird.
LEADFEMALE:Fred must see something in mom that we don't see.
SUPMALE:Butmaybe there is some teeny, tiny decent human part buried deep very deep inside her.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't idealize your mother, jackie.
LEADMALE:Maybe she acts different around him.
LEADFEMALE:Why else would he like her? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Maybe he sees her and he thinks of something good from his childhood.
LEADFEMALE:Like maybe one time some screeching old harpy saved his life or something.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god, another customer.
LEADMALE:How many people have to eat here before word gets out about the food? Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi, would you let me in, please? Uh, we're closed.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well it says here you're open till 10:00.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but see, we had a really busy day and we ran out of food.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Whew.
LEADMALE:He's scary.
LEADFEMALE:Sounded like it.
LEADFEMALE:I did the right thing, didn't i? Well, you said he was scary.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hey, i think i should tell you something.
LEADMALE:I'm mr.
LEADMALE:Williams, gina's father.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, come on in.
OTHERMALE:I'm roseanne conner.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you just say that you were gina's father? you need to know all your customer's names before they come in to your restaurant? Hey, mr.
LEADMALE:Williams, you think that you know what happened but that wasn't what happened.
LEADFEMALE:No, she didn't do that because you are african american.
LEADFEMALE:She did that because you're a man.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, and i'm prejudiced against all men equally.
LEADMALE:That's real funny.
LEADMALE:Hey, we're women, you know? And it's night.
SUPMALE:This is, like, a matter of safety.
LEADMALE:And in situations like that, i just gotta go with my gut instinct.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i guess your kid inherited your instincts.
LEADFEMALE:What? There's no way that that's anything like this.
SUPMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Williams, come on, i'm sure you didn't come here to fight.
SUPMALE:Well, just forget about it anyway.
LEADFEMALE:There's probably just no way you're ever going to see where i'm coming from.
LEADMALE:You know, that's funny.
LEADMALE:I was gonna say the same thing to you.
LEADMALE:Well, i think he blew that out of proportion.
SUPMALE:I mean, you invited him in.
SUPFEMALE:You tried to make it up to him.
LEADMALE:You know, if he was a white guy with the exact same build in those exact same clothes, you would've done the exact same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, i'm glad one of us is sure.
LEADMALE:Well, now don't beat yourself up over it, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You know, anybody else would've done just what you did.
LEADMALE:Well, isn't that great? You know, dear you really should get in the habit of using a coaster, even with this furniture.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, mother.
LEADFEMALE:Do we have to watch this nature crap? Oh, that's right.
OTHERMALE:You never liked educational programs.
LEADMALE:Good thing it didn't affect your career.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, jackie, you should see this.
LEADMALE:In order to claim the carcass entirely for itself, the vulture emits these piercing cries, sending all the other animals running for their lives.
OTHERFEMALE:No, thanks.
SUPMALE:I'm familiar with the concept.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to bed.
LEADMALE:That's a good idea.
SUPFEMALE:You've been looking extremely tired lately.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps some cucumbers for your eyes.
LEADFEMALE:I assume you at least keep vegetables in the house.
SUPMALE:Yes, mother, i keep them on the couch.
LEADMALE:Good night, dear.
LEADFEMALE:The coast is clear.
OTHERFEMALE:Ugh, thank god.
OTHERMALE:Pass me a brewksi.
LEADMALE:I didn't think i could keep up that annoying voice another minute.
LEADMALE:Does anybody else know the real you? now that wouldn't be much fun, would it? Ah.
LEADFEMALE:So, you want a coaster?
SUPMALE:Okay, so we need brushes, lacquer, thinner, turpentine, polyurethane and paint stripper.
OTHERMALE:Anything else? Nope.
SUPFEMALE:Remember though, that stuff needs a lot of ventilation, so take all the lids off in the car on the way home.
SUPMALE:What? I'm sorry for staring at you, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, but there's just something about a pregnant woman that's just so beautiful.
OTHERMALE:Beautiful how? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:You used the word beautiful, you must know what you mean.
SUPMALE:You're just beautiful, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? is it my swollen ankles that you like, or my varicose veins-maybe they appeal to your artist's eye, huh? Or maybe it's my haggard face from lack of sleep.
LEADFEMALE:But i think the real question here is, is "beautiful" strong enough a word? Thank you, mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, for telling me to say that.
LEADFEMALE:Beautiful how? Hey, d.j. , your old room's just about to be painted.
LEADMALE:Becky and darlene volunteered to help.
OTHERFEMALE:How about you? No way.
LEADFEMALE:I'm moving across the hall and i'm never looking back.
LEADFEMALE:So why announce it? Nobody's gonna notice.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, at least tell your sisters to hurry up with that drop cloth.
LEADFEMALE:It's just so great, isn't it, dan? Two girls all grown up, volunteering to help paint their baby sister's nursery.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh! i remember that! How the pregnancy hormones get you all sentimental.
SUPFEMALE:Go to hell, jackie.
OTHERMALE:This ain't about you.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey, remember, you like jackie.
LEADMALE:Jackie good.
SUPFEMALE:Though the nursery's really coming along.
SUPMALE:You gonna fix those dents in the wall before you paint it? oh, wow! You remember these, rosie? I sure do.
LEADFEMALE:That's where darlene banged d.j. 's head in the wall every year to show how tall he'd grown.
SUPFEMALE:You've got to promise me you're not gonna paint over those, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i have to, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:But remember, we'll always have the x-rays.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, i got to get going, but now i have officially returned all the baby clothes that you lent me.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's the rest of the stuff? what do you mean? Going alphabetically, after "clothes" comes "crib," unless you dropped off some crab cakes.
LEADFEMALE:You want the crib back? Roseanne, my little andy still sleeps in that crib.
LEADMALE:Well, let him hop in bed with you.
SUPMALE:He's gonna be in therapy for the rest of his life anyway.
OTHERMALE:Fred moves out, my baby has no father and now you want to take away his bed? All right, fine.
OTHERMALE:Keep it.
SUPMALE:We'll buy another one.
SUPMALE:The thing was a deathtrap anyway.
LEADMALE:Here, dad.
SUPFEMALE:This is all i could find.
SUPFEMALE:Where in the hell have you been? Don't yell at me, mother.
LEADMALE:I was getting this.
OTHERMALE:It took you long enough.
LEADMALE:Seems like you've been gone for three years.
LEADFEMALE:Man, look at all this useless yuppie crap.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there's a whole new world of baby products out there now.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i don't remember any of this kind of stuff when i had d.j. we bought d.j. that rattle, and, uh i guess it was just the rattle.
SUPMALE:Hey, check out the car seats.
LEADMALE:The '96s are in! See, i don't need one of those.
SUPMALE:I'll just use that booster seat i stole from denny's.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell's that? That is a jogging stroller.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, unless the jogger comes with it, i don't want nothing to do with it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted one of these.
SUPFEMALE:See? A wiper warmer.
LEADFEMALE:See there? That keeps the little baby wipes warm.
SUPMALE:What's a baby wipe? Here's the cribs.
SUPMALE:Hey, that one's pretty nice.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, it ought to be.
LEADMALE:It's $499.
SUPMALE:God! For that money, i could buy her a used vega to sleep in.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:This is $425.
LEADFEMALE:They're so fancy, you know? The hampton, the walden, the shenandoah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, find me one called i-need-a-cheap-replacement'cause-my-sister-stole-mine.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe that would be next to the one called "the indian giver.
OTHERMALE:" hi hi hi.
OTHERMALE:Well, here we are.
SUPFEMALE:We're shopping.
LEADMALE:We're having fun.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't this exciting? well, what can i help you with today? Well, it seems as if i have a baby stuck inside me.
SUPFEMALE:Can you help me with that? We're just looking, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Although i'll take a beer if you've got one.
SUPFEMALE:Is this your first? No, i had a couple before i left home.
OTHERFEMALE:You're fun! Well, listen, if you need any help, or you want to register for your baby shower oh no no.
OTHERFEMALE:No baby showers.
LEADMALE:That's for women that are happy they're having a baby.
LEADFEMALE:I'm only having this baby to counterbalance the mormon lady down the road.
SUPMALE:Besides, all you really need is the crib.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but unfortunately none of our friends can waste $400 on anything but lottery tickets.
LEADMALE:Maybe i'll check back with you later.
SUPFEMALE:Although i do have 40 friends who could each afford about a crappy $10 gift.
LEADMALE:Uh, how lenient is your return policy? For store credit.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:This crib is mine and i'm having that shower and i'm inviting every sucker i know and i'm gonna oversalt the popcorn so i can make extra money on drinks.
SUPMALE:Hey, yeah, okay.
SUPFEMALE:The name's conner.
OTHERMALE:So here's what i want.
OTHERMALE:I'll take one of those and, uh, two of those and four of those baby-wipe warmers.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, this is cool.
SUPFEMALE:It's a diaper genie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, a diaper genie.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:Any idea what it does? No.
SUPMALE:Put this down.
LEADFEMALE:What are you so happy about? I thought high school was gonna be hard, but this is gonna be great.
LEADMALE:I mean, look, they made a mistake.
OTHERMALE:They put me in the dumb math.
OTHERMALE:Oh please, d.j. , you'll never make it past lunch.
SUPFEMALE:All the switchblades in your back will keep setting off the metal detectors.
LEADFEMALE:No way! nobody'd do that! Yeah, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:They probably wouldn't let you keep their knives.
LEADFEMALE:Where the hell have you been? why does everyone keep saying that to me? Hey, becky, darlene says on my first day of high school i'm gonna get stabbed.
LEADMALE:Darlene, what are you telling him? Yeah?! No one's gonna want to come near him after they've pulled him naked out of the lunchroom dumpster.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going! Hey, sorry i got held up.
SUPMALE:How far'd you get on the nursery? Oh, i'm finished.
LEADMALE:Wow! You got the whole thing done? That's not what i said.
LEADFEMALE:I said "i'm finished.
LEADFEMALE:" here, you're used to laying on your back.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you start with the ceiling? Come on, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:If we do it together, we can finish in a couple hours.
LEADMALE:You volunteered us to do this, not me.
OTHERFEMALE:I would've bailed earlier, but i ran into mom and she did that hormonal weepy thing and told me she loved me.
OTHERFEMALE:Haven't developed a defense for that yet.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe this.
SUPMALE:You're just gonna quit? All right, i'll come help you after i finish my book.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how far along are you? "call me ishmael.
LEADMALE:" darlene, this isn't about you for once.
OTHERFEMALE:This is about mom's other baby.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna get involved in anything that's gonna encourage these people to procreate.
LEADMALE:That's why i'm so anti-alcohol.
SUPFEMALE:Why can't you just admit that you don't care about anyone but yourself? Don't start with me, blondie.
LEADMALE:Oh, what's going on here? Just talking about painting the nursery.
LEADMALE:You don't have to paint the nursery anymore.
LEADMALE:You've been reassigned.
SUPMALE:You guys are throwing me a baby shower.
LEADFEMALE:A baby shower? do we have to? No, you can throw me a wedding shower or whatever you want to call it, as long as the gifts add up to 400 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the guest list.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, there's like, a thousand people on this list.
LEADFEMALE:"ross perot"? "oprah winfrey"? Yeah see, they don't know that they don't know me.
LEADFEMALE:For my wedding, i got a great bottle of wine from spiro agnew.
LEADMALE:But, mom-no buts about it.
LEADFEMALE:You two are ingrates.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you remember all the times i made you pudding? Okay, we'll do it.
OTHERMALE:What? eh, sure, what the hell? well? Fine, we'll throw you a shower.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:That is just so sweet.
LEADFEMALE:My two daughters, working together to give me a baby shower.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:So great.
SUPMALE:I love you both so much.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna have to make you some pudding.
LEADFEMALE:Someday.
OTHERMALE:What a basket case.
LEADMALE:When she hugged me, i knew true fear.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i guess we should decide who does what.
LEADMALE:How about you do the invitations and i'll make the food? Whoa, cowgirl, i've done my part.
OTHERMALE:I volunteered us.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, you're not gonna stick me with this.
LEADMALE:Well, you stuck me with painting the nursery.
OTHERMALE:Becky, this isn't about you for once.
SUPFEMALE:This is about mom's other baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh! Cuts both ways, doesn't it? Hey, you're not getting out of this, darlene.
LEADMALE:Why do you have to be so lazy? You know, that's just like you, becky-assuming that this is the only shower i have to work on.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Wow.
OTHERMALE:Nice job, david.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, i know this guys' shower was mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner's idea, but i think it's great.
LEADMALE:I mean, why should women get to have all the fun? Men like babies.
OTHERMALE:We're not animals.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Now i called all the guys' wives and got all their baby pictures.
SUPMALE:I thought it would be fun if we tried to match the guys' pictures to their timecards.
LEADMALE:Isn't that fun? you don't hang out with a lot of mechanics, do you, david? Hey, guys, i'm not quite finished setting up yet.
LEADFEMALE:I still have pizza rolls in the toaster oven.
SUPFEMALE:No, you don't.
LEADMALE:Congratulations, dan.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we all chipped in and got you $45.
LEADMALE:Thanks, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Well, better get back to work, huh? yeah, they don't pay us to stand around, right? Hey hey.
SUPFEMALE:We're a present short.
SUPMALE:You pull back on those hors d'oeuvres.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look at this place.
LEADMALE:Oh, becky and darlene did a great job.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, didn't they? They got food and a lot of places to sit-although not too many places to sit so people won't linger.
LEADMALE:Hello, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my other daughter, the one i told you about.
LEADMALE:Who are these women and why are they here? They're mom's friends, and the great thing is that most of them are senile, so we can hit 'em up for presents twice.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you asked me to invite all my friends, and so far you haven't even said one word to them.
SUPFEMALE:Well, can i pick the word? Roseanne! Okay.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Sorry about your husband.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to her husband? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm just playing the odds.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Sorry about your husband.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, i could use some help out there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i've been watching, and you could.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:I've had to do everything myself.
OTHERMALE:You were the one that wanted all this fancy stuff.
LEADFEMALE:If it was up to me, i'd just put out a 50-lb bag of old-people chow.
LEADMALE:Okay, darlene, you got your revenge for painting the stupid nursery.
LEADFEMALE:Now the least you could do is take these stuffed mushrooms out there.
SUPMALE:Isn't it enough that i pretended to wash them? Hey, come on.
LEADFEMALE:We need to get to the part where i open up the old ladies' gifts.
LEADMALE:One of them could die and then the present would be wrapped up in probate.
SUPMALE:What do you got there? Stuffed mushrooms.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, they look pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks.
LEADMALE:I made the mushrooms! There's no "i" in "team," becky.
SUPMALE:I just want to say something to you guys.
LEADFEMALE:I know that you got roped into doing this, but i want to tell you how happy it makes me that you pulled together and pulled this whole thing off.
SUPFEMALE:It's so great how you guys are turning into such really cool adults, and that makes me feel like i could really raise another one.
OTHERFEMALE:It was no problem, mom.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it was our pleasure.
SUPMALE:Hey, you guys, try my special stuffed mushrooms.
LEADMALE:Oh! oh, darlene! What's with the fruit? Making a fruit punch.
SUPMALE:I've always found the best way to make fruit punch is to, uh, put in a carton of fruit punch and add another carton of fruit punch.
SUPMALE:Mother, it's better this way.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, but i'd rather have it fast than good.
LEADMALE:Last call! Good, you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, girls.
SUPMALE:Baby games, baby games.
LEADMALE:Now i've got buttons, i've got string, i've got pipe cleaners and yarn.
SUPFEMALE:It's time to play "make a potato baby.
OTHERMALE:" everybody grab a russet, and remember you're only limited by your imagination.
LEADMALE:You'll be judged on neatness and originality.
LEADFEMALE:Now in case of a tie-present time! Here you go, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Hope you like these.
LEADMALE:Gee, thanks, crystal.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's beautiful.
LEADMALE:Man! Hey, that looks like it came from a pretty expensive boutique.
LEADFEMALE:Oh no, ma'am.
LEADMALE:I made it myself.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Here, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Because i love you and everything that comes out of you.
SUPMALE:What is it? It's a gift certificate to have your baby's zodiac chart done after she's born.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, telling one of my kids what their future's gonna be is no gift, believe me.
LEADMALE:Darlene, these stuffed mushrooms are great! Thanks.
SUPMALE:I chewed up the croutons myself.
SUPFEMALE:Here you are, dear.
LEADFEMALE:My children are all doing very well, and since marvin passed on, i don't really have anything to do with my money, so well, you certainly came to the right place.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:"in honor of your baby, a tree has been planted in israel.
LEADFEMALE:" there you are, beck.
LEADMALE:The world's last surviving confederate widow wants another drink.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene don't get up, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:I know the drill.
SUPFEMALE:Here's the gift.
SUPFEMALE:Here's the receipt.
SUPMALE:I'll just put 'em in the car.
LEADMALE:Hey, let's play a new game now, okay? Um, it's called "unwrapping your gift.
SUPFEMALE:" everybody get the gift that they brought me and unwrap it and make two piles.
LEADFEMALE:This pile here, put the stores where you bought it closest to my house; and the ones farthest away, put over there.
LEADMALE:Well, look at 'em go.
LEADMALE:Hey, becky, we're all done with the mushrooms.
LEADMALE:Start frying up them potato babies.
SUPMALE:She's not in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:She and darlene went upstairs a minute ago.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:I got to go up there and break 'em up.
LEADFEMALE:"break 'em up" why? They're getting along great.
LEADFEMALE:No, they're not.
LEADFEMALE:They've been fighting all week.
OTHERMALE:It's been nothing but trouble ever since becky dipped her chocolate in darlene's peanut butter.
LEADFEMALE:Need some help? No, i can do it.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. ! Get back downstairs, darlene.
LEADMALE:Get out of my life, becky.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not asking for much.
OTHERMALE:It's not like i'm asking you to shave your pits or something.
OTHERMALE:You're just mad 'cause your body hasn't grown into your butt yet.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i am sick of your crap.
SUPFEMALE:You get downstairs and do something.
LEADMALE:No, you're the one that wants to be the perfect daughter, so you go downstairs and serve mushrooms and paint the nursery, and afterwards you can entertain the queen with riddles.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i'm not trying to be the perfect daughter, okay? I'm trying to be a decent human being.
LEADMALE:Oh, bull.
LEADMALE:You are always kissing mom's ass.
LEADFEMALE:You get down there now! no! i said go! stop it, becky! let go! stop it! ow, get off me! hey hey hey! knock it off! If you guys can't do your braids nicely, then don't do 'em at all.
LEADFEMALE:She started it.
SUPMALE:Bull! Okay well, enough is enough.
SUPMALE:You're over there and you're over there, and both of you shut the hell up.
LEADMALE:What's gotten into you guys? I can't believe you're back into the fighting thing.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't stop, i'm wow.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:That was deja vu.
OTHERFEMALE:What? This, all this-you guys fighting again.
OTHERFEMALE:You on that bed, you on that bed, both of you wanting to kill each other.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of nice, you know? it is? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I miss it.
LEADFEMALE:I miss my girls.
LEADMALE:But, damn it, i can't do this anymore.
LEADMALE:I have a child inside of me who really is a child, and you guys can't keep fighting like you're 12 years old.
SUPMALE:This wasn't a kid fight, mother.
SUPMALE:This was an adult fight.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh really? d.j. ! What are you calling him for? You'll see.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i didn't push that lady.
LEADFEMALE:She just fell.
OTHERFEMALE:This is nothing to do with that.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene and becky are fighting again.
OTHERMALE:Do you remember the stuff i used to say to them? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, tell 'em.
OTHERMALE:Darlene, stop acting like such a smart-mouthed little brat.
SUPMALE:And becky, stop acting like a martyr.
LEADMALE:If you two can't get along, i'll lock you in your room until you do.
LEADMALE:Now i don't want to hear another peep out of either one of you during "the love boat.
LEADMALE:" well done, son.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Can i have a car? You guys know that i'm always gonna be your mom, but now i'm only gonna do that if you have 19and 21-year-old problems.
OTHERFEMALE:If you're gonna go pulling all the little-girl crap, then you can just go to d.j. hey, what are you doing here? I decided to come home early and roll the drunks.
SUPMALE:Jackie told me becky and darlene were fighting.
SUPMALE:Yeah well, it's no big deal.
OTHERMALE:I just put d.j. on it.
LEADMALE:Let's go count up the loot.
LEADMALE:D.j. : all right, you heard her.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the boss now.
OTHERMALE:Hey! oh, look, dan! D.j. 's gotten so much taller! 
SUPMALE:Roseanne: let me see if i can figure out how to work this thing.
LEADFEMALE:Here, let me show you.
LEADMALE:Dan, don't crowd me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm trying to turn it on.
LEADFEMALE:It is on.
LEADMALE:No, it's off.
LEADMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:Now it's-okay, hi.
LEADFEMALE:It's me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm your mom, and here's you.
OTHERMALE:I'm making you a time capsule to be opened on your 16th birthday, so today you're 16, and, um, you either have really long hair that's over your eyes or you're totally bald and tattooed-whatever thing it is that'll make me and your dad the maddest.
LEADMALE:Um, i cannot even imagine the stuff that you'll see in your lifetime, 'cause i saw unbelievable things in my lifetime.
LEADFEMALE:I saw people walking on the moon, i saw a woman run for vice president, the fall of communism, and michael jackson marry lisa marie presley-an event that will send thousands of elvis impersonators right back into truck driving.
LEADMALE:Hey, i hope you're all busy thinking about what you're gonna say when it's your turn in here.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if you think about it, this show was really the "friends" of the '70s.
LEADFEMALE:So, you know, you have two sisters.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene is an old soul.
LEADFEMALE:I think this is about her 150th lifetime.
OTHERMALE:She really has the power to totally change the world if she can figure out how to turn her negative crap into positive crap.
LEADFEMALE:She is the first person on either side of our family ever to go to college, which is incredible.
OTHERMALE:I always thought it would be becky, though, 'cause becky is the one who had the grades.
SUPFEMALE:She had the straight "a"s and everything, but like women for millions of years before her, she goes and falls in love with a guy that's really not too bright.
SUPFEMALE:He's kind of like you know.
SUPMALE:So she quit school, is working in a dead-end job with no future-for love-like a million women for a million years before her.
LEADMALE:Love shouldn't end your life.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want becky to end up so bitter that she weighs 700 lbs, watches "court tv" all day and votes republican.
LEADFEMALE:Is it my turn yet? No, and it's gonna be awhile too, because the camera loves me.
LEADFEMALE:When's dinner? what am i, your mother? I'm going.
LEADMALE:Dan: well? She's not done yet.
SUPFEMALE:She said we should start making dinner.
LEADMALE:Okay then, how many for pea soup, how many for fish sticks? You know, mark could whip something up.
LEADFEMALE:He's been cooking at home.
LEADMALE:He's pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Fish sticks.
LEADMALE:Hey, i can cook.
LEADMALE:Now, mark, when you say "cook," do you mean cook or put ragu on bread? Ooh, that sounds good.
LEADFEMALE:Can you do that? mark's cooking? i mean, i may just be a kid, but isn't he an idiot? why can't any of you believe that mark would be a good cook? what's wrong with mark? Okay, not all at once.
LEADMALE:Let's do this in an orderly fashion.
LEADFEMALE:Mark, go to the store, buy what you need.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight the whole family's having rigatoni.
SUPMALE:Then later, rigor mortis.
LEADMALE:Hey, i'm not making dessert.
LEADMALE:Okay, girls, boxes-utility room.
SUPMALE:Got some time here.
OTHERMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:Dad, do we have to clean that stuff up now? Yeah, if we just wait a while, the boxes will decay, turn to dust and blow away.
SUPMALE:Nope.
OTHERMALE:Your mom wants this room cleaned out.
SUPMALE:Now go through these boxes, claim what's yours now or it's trash.
LEADFEMALE:I need to get something sharp to open this, like the remote.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:It's your little pink oven.
SUPMALE:Oh, look, becky.
SUPFEMALE:It's your barbie that i baked inside of it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darlene, you are not gonna believe what i just found.
OTHERMALE:Your virginity? Oh no, wait, you left that behind a dumpster at kmart.
LEADMALE:"dear roseanne, i think you're the cutest chick in homeroom.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you more than chocolate--" no, crossed out chocolate, put "coconut pie.
LEADFEMALE:Love, dan.
LEADFEMALE:P.
LEADMALE:S.
SUPMALE:, i'm the one who painted the 'f' in front of the art building.
LEADFEMALE:Cool, huh?" oh my god.
LEADFEMALE:Give me those.
LEADMALE:"dear dan, i watched you in football practice this afternoon.
LEADMALE:You sweat more than anyone else on the team.
LEADFEMALE:You're such a man.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to get naked, take your shirt, and wring it out all over my body.
SUPMALE:" hey, girls, what are you doing? Just looking at stuff nobody wants anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh-she doesn't mean you, fred.
LEADMALE:Hello, fred.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, jackie.
SUPMALE:I brought andy so he could be in the video.
SUPMALE:Thank you, fred.
OTHERMALE:You're welcome, jackie.
LEADMALE:Good day to you, fred.
SUPMALE:Bye, jack.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look.
LEADMALE:I may be a little late picking him up 'cause i'm getting fitted for ski boots.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, ski boots? for skiing? why, is that odd? No no.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:No, not at all, no.
OTHERMALE:Not odd.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Mommy.
OTHERMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, fred is skiing.
SUPMALE:Why the hell is fred skiing? To get down the hill faster.
LEADFEMALE:No no.
LEADFEMALE:No, it doesn't make sense.
SUPMALE:See, fred is dull.
LEADMALE:When we were together, i begged him to try skiing.
LEADFEMALE:You know what his exact words to me were? "can't talk now.
SUPFEMALE:I'm pressing my slacks.
OTHERMALE:" hey, i do not want to get in the middle of this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so there's a "this" to get in the middle of, huh? Oh, i get it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, how pathetic! "see, jackie, i'm doing stuff that you like now.
LEADMALE:I'm skiing, i'm interesting.
OTHERFEMALE:" and that's supposed to make me want to take him back.
LEADMALE:That's what it is, isn't it, dan? huh? huh? I'm gonna go get a beer.
LEADFEMALE:Enjoy your tour of the galaxy.
SUPMALE:Yeah well, you're not saying that i'm wrong, are you? Okay, i will take your silence as a no.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much! Your dad works really hard.
OTHERMALE:He always wanted to give you guys everything, but over the years, i guess, his dreams kind of fell down one right after the other.
LEADFEMALE:But now he's working for the city, which is great, because you cannot be fired for any reason whatsoever, you know, just like being in congress.
LEADFEMALE:And i do have to say, though, that no matter how hard he works, i have always worked harder.
SUPMALE:I have worked whether your dad was laid up or laid off.
LEADMALE:I'm the one that brought home the bacon.
LEADFEMALE:I cooked it up myself.
OTHERFEMALE:And, yeah sure, i took a few bites off the top, but i figured i got to reward myself some way.
LEADFEMALE:And i have never complained in my entire life.
SUPFEMALE:I've never complained, and i have never ever asked anybody for help.
SUPMALE:Because, you know, even if i did, it's not like anybody'd lift a finger to help me anyway.
LEADMALE:Gee, there's a lot of cool stuff in here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, deej, you ever seen a "tv guide" from before cable? wow! skinny! What are these? Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Becky and darlene's baby books.
LEADMALE:Look, there's darlene's first tooth.
SUPFEMALE:Careful, deej.
LEADMALE:That is razor sharp.
OTHERMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:Is my baby book in here? Oh, it's, uh, probably out in the garage.
OTHERMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:I want to go find it.
LEADMALE:Okay, son, you do that.
SUPMALE:David, i'm gonna need your help here.
LEADMALE:Doing what? Making out d.j. 's baby book.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner! Hey, it was 1981.
LEADMALE:I was still hung up on the bicentennial thing.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Date of birth, middle name we'll get back to that.
LEADFEMALE:Lock of hair.
LEADMALE:Too thick and greasy.
SUPMALE:Too coarse and manly.
SUPMALE:Too much like carpet.
LEADMALE:What? has anyone ever told you you have nice hair? Man, andy was hungry.
SUPMALE:Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Duh.
LEADMALE:Get the scissors.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, jackie.
OTHERMALE:So, mark, mark bo-bark, you and fred work together.
LEADFEMALE:Has he told you about his little plan yet-his little jackie-likesto-skiso-i'm-gonna-skito-get-her-back plan? fred's going skiing? I guess it got too cold for him to go rock climbing.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, he's rock climbing too? I don't like rock climbing.
LEADMALE:Why is he rock climbing? why are you rock climbing? I don't like rock climbing, so your doing it doesn't impress me.
OTHERFEMALE:So why do it? I wasn't doing it to impress you.
LEADFEMALE:Then why the sudden interest in skiing, mister mister famous-guywho's-a-skier-guy? jackie, is andy ready or not? Jean-claude killy! that's it-jean-claude killy! Jackie, you know, i can do things for me too.
OTHERFEMALE:I can go skiing.
OTHERFEMALE:I can go rock-climbing.
SUPFEMALE:I can be in a play.
LEADFEMALE:You were in a play? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell gives you the right to be interesting? You were the one who was always telling me i should be more active.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, before, when we were together.
LEADMALE:It doesn't do me any good now.
LEADMALE:Change back.
SUPMALE:Change back! Goodbye, jackie.
SUPMALE:You've lost your mind! Oh, so now you're a psychiatrist.
LEADMALE:Look, there goes fred, the skiing psychiatrist! Me and your aunt jackie are really close.
SUPFEMALE:We're about as close as two sisters can be.
SUPMALE:But it is kind of funny how life works out, because in high school she was the one that had all these boyfriends and i never had any boyfriends.
LEADMALE:But now i'm the one that's been married for 23 years and aunt jackie just barely got a divorce, which is sad.
SUPMALE:And i'm sure that her little andy's gonna grow up to be some big old flamer uh, well, which isn't a bad thing.
LEADMALE:I mean, um, gay people are cool.
SUPFEMALE:They're just as good and just as bad as other people.
LEADFEMALE:You might be gay yourself.
LEADMALE:So i want you to know that there's nothing you could ever do or say or be that would make us not love you.
LEADFEMALE:"roseanne, roseanne, my name is dan.
SUPFEMALE:I really want to be your man.
SUPMALE:Please say yes or i'll be a mess.
OTHERFEMALE:Leave your answer in my 'dess.
OTHERFEMALE:'" are you listening? becky? Darlene, you got to read what mom wrote here.
OTHERMALE:It's really incredible.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, where's dad? Dad, i couldn't find it.
LEADMALE:Whoa, d.j. ! slow down! running is very dangerous! now you get back out there and you walk in here! go go go go go go! Baby's footprint.
LEADMALE:Done.
LEADMALE:I think that's everything.
SUPFEMALE:Our horrible fraud is complete.
LEADMALE:Cool, thanks, david.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , good news! we found your book! it was in this box the whole time! How about that? Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, it's my first tooth.
LEADMALE:Ooh, and it's all sticky! and minty! There's a real good reason for that, deej.
OTHERMALE:You see, that particular tooth-is a tic-tac! it is? Oh, that's right, it is! that's right, that's right! You see, your real tooth-this is quite a story here-oh my god, you've got your mother's stare.
OTHERMALE:Okay, deej.
OTHERMALE:Look, we made the whole thing up.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:We never did keep a baby book for you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you were the third kid.
SUPFEMALE:That happens sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:But it doesn't mean we love you any less.
LEADMALE:I hope you know that.
LEADMALE:None of this was my idea, d.j. come on, deej.
SUPMALE:I'll make it up to you.
LEADFEMALE:We can do some father-son things.
LEADMALE:You know any? why don't you just finish my book? really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Just write what i was like when i was two.
LEADMALE:Just kind of average.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh, just starting to put sentences together.
SUPMALE:Do better.
SUPFEMALE:"much smarter than either of his sisters.
OTHERFEMALE:" all right! "has x-ray eyes.
LEADMALE:" so i'd better tell you a little bit about your grandparents.
LEADMALE:You know, my mother's bev.
LEADMALE:She drives me nuts.
OTHERMALE:I mean the woman wears a wool cap in the summer, for god's sake.
SUPMALE:But she raised me and jackie almost totally by herself, and she never told us that our father had a girlfriend for 22 years.
LEADMALE:So that tells you everything you need to know about my father.
OTHERMALE:And your father's father married my very best friend crystal and they have two kids now.
LEADFEMALE:We don't see 'em that much anymore 'cause your dad just really doesn't get along with his dad too well.
LEADMALE:And your dad's mom, well, let's just say she enjoys a cocktail.
SUPMALE:Food, now! Darlene: all right, let's get this over with.
SUPMALE:The pizza place closes at 9:00, which doesn't give me much time to eat this, puke and then drive there.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, you knock it off.
LEADMALE:Yeah, leave mark alone.
LEADFEMALE:This looks good.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, can i go to bed without supper? No.
SUPFEMALE:Please? I smoked a cigarette today.
SUPFEMALE:I wish we had a dog.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we did.
OTHERMALE:All right, that's it.
LEADMALE:Dinner's over.
LEADFEMALE:I worked really hard on this and all you people do is sit around and make fun of me.
SUPFEMALE:Mark, mark, bring the plates back.
SUPMALE:We're sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:"sorry" only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.
LEADMALE:You guys are unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:Mark really tried to make a good dinner for you people, and you just make fun of him? Well, i guess that's what passes for "thank you" in this family.
LEADMALE:I feel really bad.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Wait 10 minutes.
LEADMALE:Oh my god! They're eating it.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah, look for yourself.
LEADMALE:Oh my god, they are.
OTHERMALE:Suckers! Serves 'em right, ragging on you all day.
SUPFEMALE:What is in that junk anyway? Lots of stuff, but i think it's the jergens that they're really responding to.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't finish that! get back here! Teach you to smoke a cigarette.
LEADMALE:If you're going in to eat, may i suggest a few of these first? No, dan, alcohol isn't the answer to everything.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:This is about that whole fred thing, isn't it? No.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down please.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, it's not about fred.
LEADMALE:It-it's about me and fred.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my stomach hurts! i can't get up! What? it's just that fred has suddenly gotten so interesting, and i've become so boring, and it's not fair, you know? I want to do stuff too, but i have to spend all my time being a mother.
LEADFEMALE:Could you give fred the baby more hours a week? No, i don't want to do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Cut back on your hours at work? I can't afford to do that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, take the baby and move in with your mom? Okay, that was just plain mean.
LEADFEMALE:Well, jackie, i don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm out of ideas.
LEADMALE:You've shot down all my suggestions.
SUPFEMALE:You've rejected alcohol out of hand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i know.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that i want to do things like ski and stuff and i can't because i have andy.
SUPMALE:And then-i know it sounds horrible-but i feel cheated.
LEADMALE:And then that makes me feel all guilty because it's not little andy's fault, it's nobody's fault.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just stuck.
SUPMALE:I'm just i'm stuck and i'm alone and i don't know what to do.
SUPMALE:Roseanne and i are always here for you.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, i know.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, relax.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get him.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: dan, get in here.
OTHERFEMALE:It's your turn to talk to the kid.
SUPFEMALE:It's not always gonna be like this.
LEADFEMALE:We will be here for you.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, dan.
LEADMALE:It's okay, it's okay.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetie, it's all right.
LEADMALE:Everything's okay.
SUPFEMALE:No, honey, shh shh.
SUPMALE:Okay, i'm gonna give your dad a turn to talk to you now, but before i go, i want to tell you one thing: you know that we had you late in our lives, but we really wanted you.
LEADFEMALE:And that's basically because you're our last hope for a good retirement, which is totally gonna happen, because after all these years i finally figured out how to raise a kid that'll grow up to be incredibly successful.
OTHERMALE:And that is every time you turn around, you tell them how wonderful they are and how beautiful they are and how priceless they are and how much they are loved.
LEADFEMALE:And you are.
LEADMALE:Hi, i'm d.j. , your older brother.
SUPMALE:By the time you see this, i'll have a mustache, 'cause i just sent away for it.
OTHERFEMALE:This is your cousin andy, and he's gonna show you how smart he is.
LEADFEMALE:Honey? Honey.
LEADFEMALE:Honey! Where's mommy's nose? where's mommy's nose, huh? He's usually really good at this.
LEADMALE:Honey honey, where's mommy's nose? Hey, sis.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, mom and dad don't know we found this, so this is just between us, all right? "dear dan, we're getting married tomorrow.
LEADMALE:As cool as it is that you're going to be my husband, it's even cooler that you're gonna be the father of my children, 'cause i really want our family to be different from the families we grew up in.
LEADFEMALE:Our kids are gonna get a better shot than that.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna make sure they know that they're worth something, and that no matter what they do, no matter how mad they make us or how bad they screw up, they can always come home.
LEADFEMALE:" pretty nice letter, huh? Still, watch your back.
SUPMALE:No, come on.
LEADMALE:You can find it.
LEADMALE:He's so close.
LEADFEMALE:Honey honey honey hi, it's me, your dad.
LEADFEMALE:I went out and got this baby book for you today.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna fill it all out for you, stay on top of it.
LEADMALE:I already put your sonogram picture in there.
LEADFEMALE:That's you.
LEADFEMALE:You look real pretty.
LEADMALE:You got your mother's eye sockets.
LEADMALE:Can't wait to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne: your grandmother really really wanted to be on this tape, so go ahead, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Hello! Hello, little grand-trust me.
SUPMALE:That was enough.
LEADMALE:So i'll see you in a few weeks.
LEADMALE:Can't wait.
SUPFEMALE:What do you got to do to get some dinner around here? 
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:That was the most horrible disgusting meal i've ever had in my life.
LEADFEMALE:You should have been here on sushi night.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great, he pays me with a check and then stiffs me on a tip.
SUPFEMALE:It's not enough that i have to work here all morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Now i have to follow him home and drive all over his lawn.
SUPMALE:We'd fire her, but she's got the best attitude on the staff.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, i don't blame her.
LEADMALE:I put myself through college waiting tables.
OTHERMALE:I know how it can grind you down.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but at the end of the day that $6 in loose change just makes it all worthwhile.
LEADFEMALE:Mind if i have a look at that guy's check? You really shouldn't have to put up with that kind of behavior.
OTHERMALE:You know, when i was waiting tables in college, i could tell you stories that'd curl-hello, mrs.
LEADMALE:Sloan? Hi, this is scott.
SUPMALE:I'm the desk clerk at the come and go motel over in elgin, when you and your husband were in here last time, unfortunately you left some of your private garments behind.
LEADFEMALE:You weren't? Well, aren't you a busty whoops! My mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, he stiffs me for a tip and you destroy his marriage.
LEADFEMALE:That's awesome.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i got more checks.
LEADFEMALE:Let's do more.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you'd enjoy that.
LEADMALE:You look like you've ruined a few lives in your day.
SUPMALE:I think i should tell you that i'm a married woman.
SUPMALE:However, i'm not a fanatic about it.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm taken myself almost.
SUPFEMALE:The wedding is saturday.
OTHERMALE:Speaking of which, i have to order a tux and buy some flowers.
LEADFEMALE:What's the quickest way to get over to frank's florist from here? I wouldn't go to frank's if i were you.
LEADMALE:You know that guy that was here? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That was frank.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, okay, so where do i go to get a good price on flowers? Well, the dumpster behind spiegelman's funeral home.
LEADMALE:And i don't think you'd find anything good to wear at that tuxedo shop on main st.
SUPFEMALE:, either.
OTHERFEMALE:Unless you're one of the commodores.
OTHERMALE:Man, you are good.
SUPFEMALE:So are you nervous? Well, yeah, i guess.
LEADFEMALE:Sort of.
LEADFEMALE:We were supposed to get married five years ago, but i got left at the altar.
SUPMALE:I just don't want to have it happen again.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of a horrible bitch would dump you? Scott.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you tell me that you were getting married? Because you are you.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but you didn't tell anybody.
OTHERFEMALE:Because, roseanne, it would have gotten back to you, and again, you are you.
LEADMALE:So this is roseanne.
SUPMALE:Mm-hmm.
OTHERMALE:Prove it.
SUPFEMALE:Do that thing where you spew bile and scare young children.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i only do that at the christmas party.
LEADFEMALE:So what in the hell is wrong with you to leave a terrific guy like this at the altar? You know, roseanne, i don't think this really concerns you.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just waddle away, huh? And oh, look, crumbs.
LEADMALE:You know, you could do so much better.
LEADFEMALE:I mean it.
OTHERMALE:Even in a small town like this one, he is at the very bottom of the homosexual heap.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that sounds like fun.
LEADFEMALE:So, scott, did everything work out all right up in minneapolis? It went fine.
LEADMALE:My family minister's perfectly willing to marry us, but we do have to fly to minnesota for a few days of premarital counseling.
LEADFEMALE:I can't fly to minneapolis.
SUPMALE:What? I have to meet with the wedding planner.
LEADFEMALE:There are still tons of stuff to do.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Maybe roseanne can work with him.
LEADFEMALE:She seems to know everything there is to know about planning a wedding.
LEADMALE:No no no no no! Roseanne is not to be trusted with anything that involves cake.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, leon.
SUPFEMALE:I'll do it for free.
LEADMALE:And i have not said those words since my own wedding night.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you hear that? Roseanne will plan it for free.
SUPMALE:Of course, we'll have roseanne plan our wedding.
OTHERMALE:You know, i've always dreamed of a ceremony that would culminate in a hog fry.
LEADFEMALE:Hog fry? what, is the governor coming? But just think, with the money we save on the wedding planner, we could afford that honeymoon trip in the bahamas we've always wanted.
LEADMALE:Well, scott, i was thinking we'd be going to greece, myself.
LEADMALE:You can grease yourself in the bahamas.
OTHERFEMALE:Just think, this time next week you're right.
LEADMALE:We could be snorkeling in the nude.
LEADFEMALE:Snorkeling, huh? Well, i guess you learn a new word for it every day.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, roseanne! She's terrible.
SUPMALE:Come on, after what you did to me last time, you owe me.
SUPMALE:All right, i will do it.
LEADFEMALE:For you, scott.
LEADFEMALE:I will itemize exactly everything we need and where to get it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you worry about it, leon.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna do a great job for you guys, because you know what? I've always thought of you as the middle-aged obnoxious gay son that i've never had.
LEADFEMALE:Ahh! So have you ever been fitted for chaps? David, roseanne's at the reception hall.
LEADFEMALE:She wants to know how the seating chart's going.
LEADMALE:Hey, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it looks like each table's gonna be boy, girl, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy and boy.
SUPMALE:Okay, and i'm checking on the male strippers.
LEADMALE:I can't stop looking at these guys.
LEADMALE:They're so clean and shiny.
LEADMALE:So who's it gonna be? rod, lance or shaft? dan, you got a second? I need you to check on a stripper for me.
SUPMALE:Those aren't strippers.
LEADFEMALE:Those are guys.
LEADMALE:What are you guys looking at? Radial tires.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wow, cool! Cool? Why would you look at those pictures and say cool? 'cause this one's my math teacher.
LEADMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:What's with the strippers anyway? is she throwing leon a bachelor party too? No, they're for the reception.
LEADMALE:She's gonna put them in cages on either side of the cake.
LEADMALE:I thought leon wanted something modest and tasteful.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why they're in cages.
OTHERFEMALE:She's gone way overboard.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody's gonna have to sit her down and set her straight.
OTHERMALE:I didn't mean me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Where in the hell have you been? The wedding is in an hour.
LEADFEMALE:The flight was delayed.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I got here as soon as whoa.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? No, nothing.
LEADMALE:It's just that the sight of you in tasteful surroundings, roseanne-kind of startling.
LEADFEMALE:This is nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:They wouldn't even let me decorate out here.
SUPMALE:Wait till you see the main hall.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we're never gonna go away can't you see we're really here to stay? Hey, we're never gonna go away again.
OTHERMALE:I do not believe this.
SUPFEMALE:Or this, or this.
LEADFEMALE:What is-this is-this is-what-what is this? oh, well, they didn't have anything with two grooms, see? So we broke off the bride and then we replaced it with one of the action heroes from "pocahontas.
SUPMALE:" roseanne, what is all this? It's a gay wedding.
LEADMALE:This isn't a wedding, it's a circus.
SUPMALE:You have somehow managed to take every gay stereotype and just roll them up into one gigantic, offensive, roseanniacal ball of wrong! Relax, nobody gets the wedding they really want.
LEADMALE:Now look, i need a picture of you for the newspaper and not that retouched one where you look like joan van ark.
LEADFEMALE:It's off.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? I said the wedding is off! Well, of course it's a little off.
OTHERFEMALE:It's two guys for god's sake.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, did anybody here lose their hearing aid? Here, this is yours.
LEADMALE:Seems like everything's going well.
LEADMALE:Where's leon? Locked in the bathroom.
SUPMALE:He locked himself in the bathroom? what, is he, like, crying? He might be by now.
SUPFEMALE:I locked him in there.
LEADFEMALE:What? He was gonna leave.
LEADFEMALE:Apparently, he thinks that i went too far with this wedding.
SUPMALE:Isn't that ridiculous? Oh, hi, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the happy groom.
LEADFEMALE:Please, not too loud.
SUPFEMALE:My buddies took me out and got me drunk last night.
OTHERMALE:Oh, i remember when i needed buddies to get drunk.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i want you to say hello to two very special people.
SUPMALE:This is leon's mother.
LEADMALE:This is reverend crosley.
LEADFEMALE:And my name is scott, and i may be an alcoholic, and i'm going to greet people since my hand is shaking anyway.
LEADMALE:Oh, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Leon's told me a great deal about you, but the polaroids didn't quite prepare me.
SUPMALE:How wonderful it is that you were able to get that house off of you in time for the wedding.
OTHERFEMALE:And you must be the reverend.
SUPMALE:I hear you're just terrific.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:People do find my ceremony to be quite inimical, though it's taken me years of premeditated consecration to bring it to its ultimate contraception.
LEADMALE:Look at this place.
LEADMALE:Have you ever seen such a horrific display of blue-collar tastelessness? You got a big busted vein right in your nose.
LEADMALE:Reverend, would you care to see me to my seat? It would be an extinct pleasure, ma'am.
SUPMALE:Hey, now that the other groom's here, don't you think you ought to let leon out of the bathroom? well, actually, dan, i was hoping you would do it, see? Because as soon as you open that door, he's gonna bolt.
SUPFEMALE:So you are gonna have to tackle him and then drag him down the aisle here and try to make it look like you're giving him away.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, i think you ought to tone the wedding down like he wanted.
LEADFEMALE:No, this is my wedding, and he is lucky i cast him in it.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, i know you wanted this wedding to be a certain way, but if you don't do something, there isn't gonna be a wedding.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be all your fault and you know who's gonna suffer? Me.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy, come here.
OTHERMALE:Now you guys have to stall the guests and keep them entertained so i can go to the bathroom and talk to leon.
LEADFEMALE:Now if you hear any screaming, just tell everybody that yoko ono is warming up.
OTHERMALE:These people need to be entertained.
LEADFEMALE:I need to entertain.
SUPMALE:It's a good thing i'm a giver.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, wedding people, and welcome.
LEADMALE:First, let me compliment you on your impeccable grooming.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i had a little dilemma myself trying to figure out what to buy for two queens getting married.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you, with the pink limo: i'll give you $50 to back that thing through this wall.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:All right, you win.
OTHERMALE:I will totally change the wedding, okay? You can have your nice quiet, boring ceremony and i don't care.
LEADFEMALE:While people are yawning, i'll just throw peanuts in their mouths.
LEADFEMALE:I am not getting married, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you hear me? Wake up.
LEADFEMALE:I said no lizas, no judys, no antonio banderas matchbooks.
SUPFEMALE:This is not about the decorations.
LEADMALE:I mean, as hideous as they may be, that's not the reason that i've been throwing up every morning for the past week.
LEADFEMALE:Oh my god.
LEADMALE:You're pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:It's not funny, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just not ready to get married.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, you're just getting cold feet.
SUPFEMALE:Is that what happened to you before? No no no, last time was different.
SUPMALE:I was young and i was immature.
LEADMALE:You were 47.
SUPMALE:Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you'll excuse me no way.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna do this to scott again.
SUPMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:What was i thinking? I mean, scott deserves better treatment than-first time i stop you.
OTHERMALE:Second time i kill you.
SUPFEMALE:What is the matter with you, leon? I mean, jeez, next to your hair plugs, scott is the best thing that's ever happened to you.
LEADMALE:Well, right, but unlike hair plugs, marriage is permanent.
OTHERFEMALE:No it isn't.
LEADFEMALE:I wake up every single morning knowing i could leave dan if i wanted to.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just too damn lazy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then w-w-what if he doesn't like my cooking? Then eat out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what if i can't stand his mother, huh? Then stay in.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Scott says he is not himself in the morning until he has a pop-tart.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what if they stop making pop-tarts, huh? what will i do then? Listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:I will be living with a person they will never stop making pop-tarts! Who isn't himself.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, then how about this? hmm, ready? what if i am not even really gay? You couldn't be any gayer if your name was gay gayerson.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? well, you just think about it, young lady, hmm? I hate to shop.
LEADMALE:I am absolutely insensitive.
LEADMALE:I detest barbra streisand.
LEADMALE:And for god's sake, i'm a republican.
SUPFEMALE:But do you like having sex with men? well-gay! Oh, yeah? I'm gay.
LEADFEMALE:Let's do it.
LEADFEMALE:Are you okay? I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, if he's happy then i'm happy.
LEADMALE:It's just that years ago when i pictured my son's wedding i certainly didn't have this in mind.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, this probably is weird for you being the mom.
LEADMALE:But, you know, i'm sure when you pictured his wedding, you also pictured him marrying somebody that really loved him.
SUPMALE:And that is what's happening here.
LEADMALE:You know, love is love.
SUPMALE:I suppose.
LEADFEMALE:And besides, you're getting a nice addition to your family.
LEADMALE:That's my son-in-law over there.
SUPMALE:Ouch.
OTHERFEMALE:Ouch.
LEADFEMALE:Ouch.
OTHERMALE:Oh, oh, i'm so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Nearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this couple, he and he in the bonds of holy alimony.
LEADMALE:Now i had some very apportionate remarks here somewhere.
LEADMALE:I love you, you know? I know.
SUPFEMALE:And you love me, right? I love you in a way that is mystical and eternal and illegal in 20 states.
LEADMALE:That's the most beautiful thing i've ever heard.
SUPMALE:So you really want to do this? Yeah.
LEADMALE:In sickness and in health? Till death do us both part.
LEADFEMALE:Sure you can handle it? No.
OTHERFEMALE:It's gonna be great, you know? Yeah, i know.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, that all sounded good to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's move right on.
SUPFEMALE:Do you, leon, take this scott to be your awfully rabid husband? to escalate, to cherish, to fax? I do.
SUPMALE:And do you, scott, erratically agree to all the same stuff? I do.
LEADMALE:Then by the power encrusted in me, i now pronounce you man and i now pronounce you men.
SUPMALE:Amen! You may kiss the bride if there so be one.
SUPMALE:It doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:And there's the kiss.
LEADMALE:I was wondering if they were gonna do it, and they're doing it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, look at 'em go at it.
OTHERFEMALE:They are not going at it, dan.
SUPFEMALE:It just happens to be two people of the same sex kissing, and there's nothing wrong with that.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Kinda nice being here before the store opens.
SUPMALE:Very peaceful.
LEADMALE:Very still.
LEADFEMALE:Shh, there's a deer over there by the brillo pads.
LEADMALE:Good morning, ladies.
LEADMALE:Parkin, manager.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to see you're right on time.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah well, that's 'cause i have to leave early.
LEADFEMALE:Now where can we go to sit and drink coffee? Apparently in your car.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Here, let me show you the demonstration area you'll be working right down here.
LEADMALE:We're expecting a huge crowd this weekend, and if you saw the circular in today's paper, you probably know why.
LEADMALE:Oh, they got a newspaper on the weekdays? Yes, they do.
LEADMALE:Here are two new products we're rather excited about that you'll be giving out samples of today.
LEADMALE:"soyasausage" right here, and cheese in a can.
LEADFEMALE:"'soyasausage,' america's first meatless all-vegetable sausage-like product.
LEADMALE:" cheese in a can.
LEADMALE:"cheese" "in a can.
LEADFEMALE:" all right, i've got a lot to do so i'll make this brief: offer one sample to the customer.
LEADMALE:Just one.
LEADFEMALE:Let them try it, then suggest that they buy some to take home, you see? sound good? Sounds very good.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Parkin, is there a particular type of customer that we should be looking for? I like your pluck.
LEADMALE:All right, let's talk demographics.
LEADFEMALE:Each shopper, we find, is looking for something different.
SUPMALE:Women in their 40s are looking for quality, for example.
SUPMALE:Women in their 20s and 30s are looking for affordability.
LEADFEMALE:On the other hand, men in their 40s are-are looking for women in their 20s.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, how much are we getting paid? $4.
OTHERMALE:25 an hour, plus-and here comes the big money-unit you move.
SUPFEMALE:Wow, i couldn't be more excited if i knew how to multiply.
LEADFEMALE:So if i have a really good day, i could pay for all those christmas presents i just bought.
SUPMALE:Right, 'cause they were what? Well, good luck, and just remember the three rules of product sampling.
LEADFEMALE:Chase, tackle, threaten? Smile, sample sell.
LEADMALE:Whatever.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, so which one do you want, roseanne? the soyasausages? Oh yeah, you would like that, wouldn't you? 'cause nobody's gonna buy that crap.
LEADMALE:Besides, if i go home smelling like sausage, dan will never let me get any rest.
LEADMALE:Smile, sample, sell.
OTHERFEMALE:Smile, sample, sell.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hello there, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:John q.
OTHERMALE:Shopper.
LEADMALE:Smile.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to try some of our soyasausage? Sample.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you take some home for your family? They're bound to enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:Sell.
OTHERMALE:Sweet damn it, it works.
SUPMALE:Oh, relax, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to do anything.
LEADMALE:People will eat cotton in a supermarket as long as there's a toothpick in it.
LEADMALE:Hey, did you know you could cure cancer with three cups of hot water and a pepper? Yeah, i know we just took these jobs to bring in a little extra cash, but that doesn't mean we don't have to take it seriously.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I am ready.
LEADMALE:Skillet's nice and hot.
SUPFEMALE:I got the toothpicks.
LEADFEMALE:I got the napkins.
LEADMALE:Everything is handy within reach.
LEADMALE:I got my backup here.
LEADFEMALE:People are gonna start flooding through that door any second.
LEADMALE:Don't you think you ought to get your area ready? Come and get it before it hardens.
LEADMALE:You know, dan, since i'm helping you with this linoleum and all-yeah yeah, i'll help you put new linoleum in your trailer.
LEADMALE:Who cares about that, man? I wanna be the first person to slide across this in my socks.
SUPFEMALE:You'll be wearing pants too, young man.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, deej, i thought this might help you draw that cat for your art class.
LEADFEMALE:Now you can use these pictures to study bone structure, musculature, coloring.
LEADMALE:It's a cat calendar.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Look at march.
SUPFEMALE:This is from 1987.
LEADMALE:I can't use this.
SUPFEMALE:All these cats are dead by now! That is not true.
LEADFEMALE:They're on a big farm with a nice cat lady.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, i'm done.
LEADMALE:Well, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Let me see.
SUPMALE:D.j. , you were supposed to draw a cat.
LEADFEMALE:Read the bubble over his head.
LEADMALE:"meow.
LEADMALE:" sounds like a cat to me.
LEADMALE:Dan: david, d.j. , get in here a minute.
LEADMALE:D.j. , i think you can do a lot better if you'd just apply yourself.
OTHERMALE:You wanna be proud of this, don't you? I am proud of this.
LEADMALE:You try holding a cat down with one hand and tracing it with the other.
SUPMALE:Now i've got a very important job for you guys.
LEADMALE:You stand in the corners so it doesn't roll up.
LEADFEMALE:And if it does roll up, don't worry, we'll get you out of there, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mark, what time's the movie? 5:00.
OTHERMALE:We gotta get going.
OTHERMALE:D.j. , you're just gonna ditch your art project to go to some movie? Yeah, he is.
LEADMALE:Van damme is so cool.
LEADMALE:You know why? His last name's a cuss word.
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Conner, i don't think d.j. should go to a movie.
SUPFEMALE:Look, he's hardly put any effort into this art project.
SUPFEMALE:Is that so? d.j. is this the absolute best you can do? Yes, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Here's some popcorn money.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, dad! Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Connor, you just let d.j. blow off his homework to go watch some horribly violent movie.
OTHERFEMALE:D.j. doesn't have a problem with violence.
LEADFEMALE:You've met his mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Now run and get me some more of these encyclopedias.
LEADMALE:Oh, and try to keep them in alphabetical order.
SUPFEMALE:I don't wanna spend all day putting them back.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm, smell, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Smell.
OTHERMALE:That full-bodied aroma is created by our thoughtful blend of spices.
SUPMALE:You know i don't mind getting up a little early each morning to cook soyasausages for my big guy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:My husband thanks me in a thousand different ways.
LEADFEMALE:A knowing glance, a gentle touch, it just makes it all worthwhile.
LEADMALE:Mmm, soyasausages.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Another sucker, another 15¢.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, now the trick is to aim it right down the center aisle there.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta give it some arm too, 'cause them are two-liter bottles right there.
LEADMALE:And i've been doing this for a while.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys should start small, like with a cornish game hen or something.
LEADMALE:Now okay.
LEADFEMALE:Strike! Here's a silly question.
OTHERMALE:Could you stop doing that? I suggest you try taking your job a little more seriously.
LEADMALE:Try to be more like jackie here.
LEADFEMALE:Well well well.
LEADMALE:You know, roseanne, you stand in back of that skillet, and you feel all that heat and all that pressure, and you wonder why.
LEADMALE:And then one day, the clouds part, and the manager throws a little bit of sunshine into your life.
LEADMALE:And then you realize that he's only a grocery-store manager, and all the clouds come back.
LEADMALE:This isn't bad.
LEADFEMALE:Oops, got a fish on the line.
LEADMALE:Not bad? Why, soy is god's gift to arteries.
LEADFEMALE:That's a lovely blazer you're wearing.
LEADFEMALE:That really brings out the color in your eyes.
LEADMALE:Oh well, i'll take three boxes.
LEADMALE:Oh, three? Okay.
OTHERMALE:Hey, that's really a great-looking sweatsuit you got on there.
LEADFEMALE:It kind of matches the rug in my husband's pickup truck.
OTHERFEMALE:What's on the crackers? Oh, well, today we're sampling some delightful aerosol cheese.
SUPFEMALE:It's great, i love it.
LEADFEMALE:I've been eating it all day.
SUPMALE:Just the one day? You're so witty.
LEADFEMALE:How many would you like? This cheese stuff sucks.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna do them.
SUPFEMALE:You picked the cheese.
SUPMALE:That was your choice.
LEADFEMALE:You must be going crazy from the soy fumes.
SUPMALE:You picked the cheese.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay fine, switch.
SUPFEMALE:No biggie.
SUPMALE:I finally found something i'm good at.
LEADMALE:I can sell anything.
SUPFEMALE:I'm crazy jackie! i must be insane! You know what my advice to you is: just do the best you can.
LEADMALE:It's not a competition.
SUPMALE:It is now.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hey, kid, get over here and eat some of this.
LEADMALE:It's soy-tastic.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, these are good.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you go and tell your mom to come over here and buy a few boxes from me? Oh, my mom's not here.
SUPMALE:Well, do you got any money? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, get out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, but this is not a cat.
LEADFEMALE:This is an amorphous smear of existential nothingness.
LEADFEMALE:Oui oui! now let us retire to henri's and speak of revolution! Well come on, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, does this look like a cat to you? D.j. says it's a cat, it's a cat recovering from a stroke.
SUPMALE:Made all the more tragic by his having no neck or legs.
OTHERMALE:This is not a cat.
OTHERFEMALE:You're boring me.
SUPMALE:He put zero effort into that.
LEADMALE:He should be home right now redoing it.
LEADMALE:I already told him he could go to the movies.
OTHERMALE:That way when i rent it, he can point out where all the good nudity is.
LEADFEMALE:And then you let him go with mark, of all people.
SUPMALE:So? So mark-mark's mark.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe one of the reasons d.j. 's so lazy about his schoolwork is that he hangs around with a guy like mark.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with mark? I'm just saying that mark's probably not the best role model in the world.
LEADFEMALE:You certainly don't want d.j. taking after him.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner, i'm trying-no, why wouldn't i want d.j. to be a standup guy who busts his ass to support himself and his wife? Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner, all i'm saying is that-no, i know what you're saying, david, and i think it stinks.
OTHERFEMALE:Mark may not be einstein, but you know what? He makes the most of what he's got.
LEADMALE:He tries.
SUPMALE:That's more than i can say for some people around here.
LEADFEMALE:Who, me? Wow, smart guys like you catch on real quick.
LEADMALE:Hey, i try.
SUPMALE:No, david.
LEADMALE:You don't try.
LEADFEMALE:You work part-time at a pizza parlor, and you spend the rest of your life sitting on the couch making ironic comments about everybody else.
LEADMALE:Irony's for people who don't do anything.
SUPFEMALE:You get my drift? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, we're talking about d.j. yeah, and you know what? The truth is i'd rather have him hang around with mark than with you.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, i've got work to do.
SUPMALE:Look at me! look at me! i can barely keep ahead of the demand! Well, try to stay ahead of this demand-shut up.
SUPFEMALE:It just kills you that i might be better than you at something.
OTHERMALE:Actually, jackie, there's a lot of things you're better than me at: finding unavailable men, setting unreachable goals, and ass-kissing.
LEADFEMALE:What have you got there? Soyasausages-they're not only good tasting, but good for you.
OTHERFEMALE:I haven't eaten any and i feel like crap.
OTHERFEMALE:Cheese in a can, it's really good.
LEADMALE:And because these are made without pork, you'll be tops with your jewish pals.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Yes, cheese in a can.
SUPFEMALE:It's really really good.
OTHERFEMALE:Now that's what's known as marketing, roseanne, and, man oh man, am i good at it.
LEADFEMALE:You want marketing? I'll show you marketing.
SUPMALE:Attention, shoppers! Try soyasausages.
OTHERMALE:Almost as good as the cheese, but without the spider eggs and hair.
SUPFEMALE:That is not true! Truth has no place in marketing, jackie.
LEADMALE:And they cure cancer.
OTHERFEMALE:Soyasausages-the food of demons.
OTHERFEMALE:Eat it and go to hell! yeah, where you'll meet the inventor of cheese in a can! Yeah, nice try, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Nice try.
OTHERFEMALE:In fact that was just "grrreat.
SUPMALE:" oh, jackie.
LEADMALE:You and your silly tricks.
OTHERMALE:But as everyone knows trix are for kids! M&m chocolate candies-they melt in your mouth not in your hand.
LEADMALE:You know, the best part of waking up, jackie, is folgers in your cup! Dishwashing liquid.
LEADFEMALE:You're soaking in it! say it! say it! okay, all right! fine! You're better than me.
LEADMALE:There, madge.
LEADFEMALE:Five years ago-five years, at uncle wong's, i was handed a fortune that said "someday your hidden talent will be revealed.
LEADFEMALE:" today that fortune has come true.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations, jackie.
LEADMALE:You know how to sell cheese.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha! Oh jackie? what? got milk? Hello, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:How's your day? I see you're really throwing yourself into your work here.
SUPMALE:Very impressive.
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
LEADFEMALE:You mean we don't work here anymore? I don't even think i work here anymore.
LEADFEMALE:That's fine then.
LEADFEMALE:So who do we go see about getting paid? can i give you a hand with that? No, i got it.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, i've been thinking about what you said.
LEADMALE:It really made a lot of sense.
SUPMALE:So i've decided i need a change.
LEADFEMALE:I need a big change, so i'm gonna move out.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i didn't mean to be that hard on you earlier.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i'm not asking you for an apology.
SUPMALE:I just don't know why the hell you got so upset.
LEADFEMALE:You don't? No.
SUPMALE:You mean in that deep sensitive soul of yours, you can't understand why i might be upset when you rip apart mark-a guy that doesn't read much-he's not book smart-but who works real hard every day at the lanford city garage to support his wife and his family? you can't understand why that might not upset me? I think i can.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a little scared to say it now.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I should not have put mark down like that, and i certainly didn't mean to put down anyone else.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
SUPMALE:And you're right, i should get off the couch and apply myself more.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's good.
SUPMALE:So are we okay now? Yeah, we're cool.
LEADMALE:You know, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner is gonna love this new linoleum.
SUPFEMALE:No no no no.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell her it's new.
SUPFEMALE:See, every couple of years or so she asks me to clean behind the stove, and i've always found that doing this is much easier.
LEADMALE:So, david, what's your time frame? for what? For moving out.
LEADFEMALE:But we just sort of made up and everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well yeah, i know, but you're the one that said you should move out.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah well, i just said that so that you could talk me out of it.
LEADMALE:I think we're just holding you back by letting you live here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no you're not.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we are.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it was great when you were in high school, but now you're a man.
LEADFEMALE:No i'm not.
LEADMALE:I know it's hard for you to hear, but you are a man.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop saying that.
OTHERFEMALE:I said i was sorry.
LEADMALE:David.
OTHERMALE:David, you didn't think we were gonna let you live here forever, did you? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Not "forever.
OTHERFEMALE:" come on, david.
LEADFEMALE:It may take me awhile to find a place.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not kicking you out.
SUPMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i guess i am.
LEADFEMALE:I've never had to do this before.
LEADMALE:All the other kids couldn't wait to get out of here.
LEADMALE:So then shouldn't my loyalty buy me an extra month or two? Done.
LEADMALE:You're gonna be okay, david.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Okay, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you'll see.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be fun.
OTHERFEMALE:A couple, three months from now, you'll be out on your own.
SUPMALE:You'll have a job.
LEADMALE:Before you know it, you'll start feeling more grown up, just like your brother mark.
SUPMALE:Wee! Good evening, everybody.
OTHERMALE:I'm verne lundquist, and welcome to beautiful lanford, illinois, where fans are going wild over what they hope will become a new olympic sport.
OTHERMALE:And here comes our first competitor onto the floor now.
LEADFEMALE:Scott hamilton-an olympic champion and a gutty little competitor, has left the ice behind for the exciting new sport of linoleum sock skating.
LEADFEMALE:Now watch-he's going for the triple wally with the split twist! Well, he backed off.
OTHERFEMALE:Might have been worried about that kitchen cabinet.
OTHERMALE:Wonderful! And now here comes the hometown favorite-mark healy for the pas de deux portion of the routine.
SUPFEMALE:A beautiful maneuver.
SUPMALE:This is an important day for mark healy.
LEADMALE:He missed the nationals last year because he got on the wrong bus.
SUPFEMALE:And here comes the finale lovely.
LEADMALE:Well-deserved bows for national treasure scott hamilton, and for mark healy, hard-working dumb guy.
LEADFEMALE: it's beautiful, more beautiful than i ever could have imagined.
LEADMALE:Nothing smells as sweet as money you didn't earn.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, why couldn't a relative die every day? $382 for doing nothing.
LEADMALE:Now i know how regis feels.
LEADFEMALE:You know, money really is kinda like an aphrodisiac, isn't it? Come here, big boy.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm-muah! It sure took its time getting here.
LEADFEMALE:Your aunt harriet died three months ago.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, when you die on a cruise ship they pack you in buffet ice and just eat around you.
LEADFEMALE:I got an idea.
LEADMALE:Let's get it all in singles, throw it on the floor, roll around in it.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever sticks we get to spend on snow cones.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you guys are actually celebrating someone's death.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, we're not celebrating anybody's death.
SUPMALE:We're celebrating the fact that we got $382 here.
LEADMALE:Her death was just a bonus.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hold on there, sparky.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt harriet sent you an envelope too.
LEADFEMALE:It's probably a bill for 382 bucks.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow, $500! No, d.j. , that's $5.
LEADMALE:It couldn't be-it's $500.
OTHERFEMALE:Why would she give d.j. more money than you guys? Well, actually, it makes perfect sense.
LEADMALE:D.j. is the only member of the family that aunt harriet never met.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner just called from the mall where she's grieving.
LEADMALE:I've convinced her to limit her grief to $230.
SUPMALE:That leaves us $150 for a fancy meal at mcarthur's, okay.
SUPMALE:It's gonna be seven of us so that comes out to $21.
LEADMALE:42 per person.
SUPMALE:Wait, wouldn't we get more per person if somebody didn't go like, uh, david? Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner wants everyone to go, mark.
SUPMALE:And if i was you i wouldn't bring up the subject of somebody not going.
OTHERMALE:Look, everyone's going.
LEADMALE:There's plenty of money for seven people to have a great meal.
LEADFEMALE:Surprise! Look, it's darlene.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What's that you're wearing? Oh, it's the couch.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm sure you've got big fancy plans to go out somewhere starting about, oh say 7:00.
LEADMALE:So why don't you just take off and i'll put your bag away? No, i'm all yours.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't make any plans and i'm wearing shoes that pinch to keep me awake.
LEADMALE:So, what's for dinner? I'm starving.
SUPMALE:I don't know, but it's not gonna be as good as what we were having can you meet me in the kitchen for a sec? how much and when do you need it? Uh $100 by monday night when i leave.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, darlene! Well, it's for heat and books.
LEADMALE:And that pesky heroin habit.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i'll work for it.
LEADMALE:I'll do anything.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:For starts you have to be nice to everyone in the family the whole time you're here.
SUPMALE:Whoa, hold on a minute.
LEADMALE:When i said i'd do anything there is a whole lot of stuff not included in that.
LEADFEMALE:Becky: okay, dad.
SUPMALE:We got it.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:What do we got to play with? $18.
SUPFEMALE:75 per person.
SUPMALE:Well, that sucks.
LEADMALE:You were just dangling that good dinner right in front of me just like a carrot in front of a monkey! You know, i think i'm the only person that can get off a crowded smelly bus and remember that as the highlight of their visit home.
LEADMALE:Okay, now remember, it's $18.
LEADFEMALE:75 each.
LEADMALE:And that has to include your drinks and your dessert.
OTHERMALE:And for your information, "market price" means move on.
SUPMALE:You know, for such a fancy restaurant, they really don't have much of a menu.
LEADFEMALE:There's no jumbles, nothing to color.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, look at all this stuff.
OTHERMALE:I don't even know where to start.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'll simplify it for you here.
LEADFEMALE:Appetizers are the crackers we ate in the car on the way over here.
LEADMALE:And now pasta, you know, that's just spaghetti.
SUPMALE:And i wouldn't pay $12.
OTHERFEMALE:95 for spaghetti if they had mr.
SUPFEMALE:Chef boyardee himself in the kitchen there.
OTHERMALE:I think i'll-i'll get the fish.
OTHERMALE:I see what you're doing there, mark.
SUPMALE:Ordering up the brain food, huh? Nice choice.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad it's too late.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i think i'm gonna have the king cut of prime rib and a caesar salad.
LEADMALE:Can anyone tell dad where he went wrong? do you, dan conner, take this woman? Sorry, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
OTHERFEMALE:You can have my share.
LEADMALE:I can't eat knowing we only got this money because someone died.
SUPFEMALE:All right, we're back up $21.
LEADFEMALE:42 each! all right, david! You know that fasting sure can be cleansing and spiritual.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody else here wanna join up with gandhi so i can double up on the desserts? Hello.
SUPFEMALE:My name is stan.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be your waiter this eveni-oh my god, it's you! hey! It's mr.
LEADFEMALE:Parkin.
LEADMALE:You guys know our waiter? Yeah, we got him fired from the buy-and-bag.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? oh, this is the guy? Yes, this is the guy.
LEADMALE:It's good to see you landed on your feet.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, thanks to you i'm on my feet about 12 hours a day.
LEADMALE:By the way, would you care to order some food so you have something to throw at each other? I think we're gonna need a little time.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, things are a lot different now that we know we won't have to be leaving a tip.
SUPMALE:I really dislike you.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, may i recommend the shellfish? I understand it's tainted.
SUPMALE:Hey, bring us out one of those wine lists, will you? We need something to roll a joint on.
OTHERFEMALE:This is officially the most embarrassing night of my life.
LEADFEMALE:So if anybody wants to yodel, go ahead.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:This is great.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, when my aunt died all i got was a 22-acre farm.
SUPMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:You guys act like you've never seen money before.
LEADMALE:Of course we've seen it, but the bank keeps complaining about our nose prints on the glass.
OTHERMALE:I'm serious.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it's embarrassing that you can't spend money like adults.
LEADFEMALE:Big talk for a girl who's hitting us up for 100 bucks.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we all got jobs, at least.
LEADFEMALE:You're the only one here who has absolutely no money.
OTHERMALE:It's not like you're giving me the money.
LEADMALE:I'm borrowing it.
LEADFEMALE:And i'm gonna pay you back that $100, plus every other loan you guys have ever given me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darlene, just making me laugh like that is repayment enough.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i'm gonna be able to pay you back.
OTHERMALE:I mean, if i took the job i was offered last week i could pay you back in a couple months.
LEADFEMALE:We'll, i'm glad that you didn't take it.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't send you to college so you could drop out and take some crummy job for 200 bucks a week.
OTHERFEMALE:Jobs like that are for people like david who have no future.
LEADFEMALE:Look, the job was not for $200, okay? It was as an advertising copywriter and it started at $500 a week.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, you guys.
LEADMALE:She's kidding! I can't believe the way she's got you guys going.
OTHERMALE:$500 a week! Well, i didn't take it, so it doesn't matter.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, you guys! Okay, oh-okay.
SUPMALE:Darlene turned down a $30,000 a year job.
OTHERMALE:So, mark, how's the senate treating you? That's a lot of money, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, so what? i mean, i want to finish school, all right? Darlene, you go to college so you can get a job like that.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but i can get a job like that after i finish college.
LEADMALE:Or a better one.
SUPFEMALE:God, i'm sorry i brought this up.
LEADMALE:It's just that we can't believe that you would turn something like that down.
LEADMALE:How much money do you make, dad? well, that's kinda hard to say, what with, you know, overtime, retirement benefits weekly salaries-hey, everybody, come on! We're gonna order, aren't we? yeah, what the hell's taking us so long? Come on.
SUPMALE:Always a pain in the butt going out anywhere with you people.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you guys, i didn't mean to like make this-darlene, please, we're trying to get the waiter.
LEADMALE:Everybody know what they want? Yeah, think i do.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene and i are gonna laugh so hard about this someday.
OTHERMALE:Man on tv: release the princess what is this crap? This is hercules versus, uh tribe with well-oiled pectorals.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why are we watching this? Because it's good.
LEADFEMALE:Duh.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, shut up, darlene.
LEADMALE:Are you guys sucking the soul from my body for sport or are you gaining some sort of nourishment? shut up, darlene! Okay, who wants to teach becky a new phrase? She knows "shut up, darlene.
SUPMALE:" and "do you have this in a larger size?" hey! We're watching tv here, all right? d.j. , what is that? It's a trombone.
LEADMALE:I bought it with my inheritance money.
LEADMALE:You spent all $500 on that trombone? Your mother and i told you to put half of it in a college fund.
SUPFEMALE:I did! This only cost $250.
LEADMALE:I'm not stupid.
LEADMALE:I don't know how to play the trombone.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa whoa whoa whoa, young man.
LEADFEMALE:Why did you buy a trombone? I bought it 'cause there's this girl i like.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not getting it.
SUPFEMALE:Neither do a lot of trombone players darlene.
LEADMALE:All right, i like this girl who plays first tuba in the school band.
SUPMALE:And last trombone sits next to the first tuba.
LEADFEMALE:Just like it says in the bible.
LEADMALE:So here's how it works.
LEADMALE:I walk on in there, i sit down next to the chick.
LEADFEMALE:I pull out the trombone-she likes the trombone.
SUPFEMALE:I say "hi, i see you play the tuba.
LEADMALE:You're very beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:" boom! She's mine.
LEADMALE:God, d.j. ladies are my toys.
SUPFEMALE:Wind 'em up, watch 'em go.
SUPFEMALE:Attaboy! Nice parenting, dad, giving your son permission to manipulate some poor little girl.
LEADMALE:I can't believe he spent half his inheritance on a trombone.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Sounds like a typical conner family purchase to me.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, dad, still got the electric rake? hey, i've had just about enough of you, darlene! Knock it off, all right? what's wrong with you? what's wrong with me? I'll tell you wrong with me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sick and tired of your sarcastic comments about my house and my family.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, i've been saying this kind of stuff since i could talk.
LEADMALE:Before that, i just pointed and laughed.
LEADFEMALE:Well, gee, darlene, somehow it just isn't funny anymore.
LEADMALE:So why don't you make some wry comment about how we've all lost our sense of humor and be on your way? what you watching? Tv.
LEADFEMALE:Black and white or color? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with this family? Your father and i are really brothers.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm serious.
SUPMALE:I mean a minute ago he was jumping down my throat, and now he won't even hardly talk to me.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, if he wants me to stop making fun of him then he should stop walking around this dump with shaving cream in his ears.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:So sorry your father and this house aren't up to your standards.
LEADMALE:I wish we could've done better for you.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying-no, i know what you're saying.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody knows what you're saying.
SUPMALE:And you've been saying it since you got here.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:What, so now you're gonna give me this crap too? You know, i thought i could come in here and talk to you like a human being.
SUPMALE:You think that's possible? arrf! You know what? Maybe i should just go back to school.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, maybe you should.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and maybe i shouldn't come back until spring.
LEADFEMALE:Great, more $100 bills for me.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:I think her spending a little less time around this house wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
LEADMALE:Kid's got to learn to have some respect, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Taking her down a notch was the right thing to do.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, just stand there and keep yapping, dan.
SUPMALE:Let me know if you ever hit on anything.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne: darlene oh, great.
SUPMALE:More yelling.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:There isn't gonna be any more yelling.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, i'm really glad that you're going to school and, you know, getting an education like i never got because i got all lost in that love-and-peace crap of the '60s.
LEADFEMALE:And then 10 years later, i realized should have listened to all those women who said: learn how to support yourself or you're gonna be screwed.
SUPMALE:Well, mom, that is exactly what i'm trying to do.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:So maybe i'm a little jealous of you because of all the stuff that i had to do in order for you to get there.
LEADFEMALE:Like working really hard in beauty salons, restaurants and factories is pretty mind-numbing, you know? Especially if you have to stay hammered the whole time.
LEADMALE:Tell me about it.
LEADMALE:It's how i got through puberty.
LEADFEMALE:But, the good part is that i was able to give my kids better than i had.
LEADMALE:And you're gonna be able to do amazing things for your kids.
SUPFEMALE:Every parent tries to improve things at least 50% for their kids.
SUPFEMALE:And if they can do that, then they're a total success.
SUPMALE:A conservative estimate.
OTHERFEMALE:Just by walking erect i improved it 30.
SUPMALE:But you know this college thing is really hard for me too.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, i'm surrounded by all these rich kids that don't have to bust their ass because if they fail their daddy's there to bail 'em out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, your daddy can't bail you out.
OTHERMALE:My daddy couldn't bail me out, you know? But stuff like that, it just ends up making us stronger, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you turned down a great job like that! Well, i told you, i just want to finish school, all right? And besides, it's in advertising.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think i want to devote the rest of my life to coming up with the next "i'm cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
SUPFEMALE:" okay, hold it.
LEADFEMALE:I respect you for being all anti-corporate and burning the flag and bla bla bla bla bla, because, you know, that's the way i was in the '60s.
OTHERFEMALE:So i'm kind of glad that some of my ideals made it to my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:But number two, this is the '90s and you can't pay your rent with that kind of thinking.
OTHERMALE:And number three, you are so out of your mind if you think you're ever gonna top anything like "i'm cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
SUPFEMALE:" okay.
OTHERMALE:But you're all over the map here.
SUPFEMALE:Do you respect my ideals for turning down the job or do you think i'm stupid for turning down the job? Well, i really don't know what i think, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, this is new territory for us.
LEADMALE:No conner's ever turned down a job ever.
LEADFEMALE:It's kinda like the same reason drowning people don't flip off the lifeguard.
LEADFEMALE:I'm still a conner.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but, man! $30,000! I mean, the mayor of lanford himself doesn't even make that much and he works two jobs.
SUPMALE:It's like, if you can make that kind of money then, you know you could be, like, one of them.
LEADFEMALE:Who's them? Them! The ones that ain't us.
OTHERFEMALE:So now when you come home making fun of our family and our house and everything, it just sounds pretty weird to me and your dad.
LEADMALE:You know, it's like you're one of them and you're putting us down.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Got it.
SUPFEMALE:So what type of helper will we be dining on tonight? Well, we happen to be out of helper tonight.
LEADFEMALE:So i'll be using rice krispies and preparing the meatand-meat-byproduct dinner.
SUPMALE:So, i had a little talk with her and she's staying.
LEADFEMALE:You straighten her out? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but you know, she's not the only one that needs to be straightened out.
LEADMALE:We've all got to adjust to this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i've got to adjust? Yeah, you do, actually.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't you think it's cool that one of our kids might actually make it? Yeah, wow.
OTHERMALE:I mean, she still needs us, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Or, at least she still needs that 100 bucks.
SUPMALE:So why don't you go up there and give it to her? and that's supposed to make me feel like the big provider? little daughter needs her big daddy? Be right back.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:We did a really good job with this one, didn't we? Yeah, we did.
SUPMALE:Man, it just looks like the conner luck is starting to change.
LEADMALE:Don't ask.
LEADMALE:There's the little creep.
LEADFEMALE:Look, he's polishing his trap.
SUPFEMALE:Now, becky, we agreed i'd talk to him.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on? D.j. , it's come to our attention that you seem to think that certain material possessions may help you succeed in affairs of the heart.
LEADMALE:That, dear d.j. , is folly.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:She means you don't buy a trombone so you can hit on some poor unsuspecting tuba girl! Oh, that.
SUPMALE:What's wrong with it? Look, you little jerk, if you have no more respect for women than that i'm gonna tie you to the car-okay, becky, becky! becky! becky! now, d.j. , listen to me! Listen.
LEADMALE:First of all, that-that's just not a right thing to do.
LEADMALE:And second of all, it's just not going to work.
LEADFEMALE:Now, d.j. , you-you have-you have put your little heart on a shelf.
SUPFEMALE:And it's going to fall off.
LEADMALE:It's going to break.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , are we gonna practice, or what? I'll be in in a minute, betsy.
LEADMALE:If the music stops, don't come in.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Hey, david, you still looking for an apartment? Remember, if you find one with a stove, you're gonna have to learn how to cook.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's not necessarily true, mark.
SUPMALE:As i recall, your trailer has a reading lamp.
LEADFEMALE:All these apartments are much much too expensive.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna have to find a better job than busboy.
LEADMALE:This is lanford, david.
SUPMALE:Unless the pin setter at the bowling alley dies, you've got the best job in town.
LEADFEMALE:You could get a trailer like becky's and then just hook it up to your truck and haul it wherever the crops are ready for pickin'.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't start with me, darlene.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, the trailer stays parked.
LEADMALE:That's why it's called a "trailer park.
LEADFEMALE:" now, what's wrong with lanford? Well, for one thing, becky's neighborhood is leaking transmission fluid into the water supply.
OTHERFEMALE:Why get a job anyway? why don't you have miss hotshot here set you up in a fancy apartment in some great city? huh? where are you going to after you graduate, darlene? new york? paris? london? Ooh, somebody's been reading hard rock t-shirts.
LEADFEMALE:Look, she's a little bit bummed about darlene getting that big job offer.
LEADMALE:I think she feels like she's in a rut.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry if i'm doing okay while her life is a miserable failure.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right, i'll go downstairs and try and think of something positive to say about her life.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't hear from me till christmas, buy yourselves something nice.
LEADMALE:You gotta understand, mark, becky was always the big achiever in the family.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but she's got to understand that we've achieved a lot too.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, we've got our own place now, we've got a car, we've got a cd player.
SUPFEMALE:And i'm sure there's stuff i'm not even remembering.
LEADFEMALE:I just had a great idea.
LEADMALE:Really? you remember it? why don't you guys come down to the trailer for a party tomorrow? a whole bunch of us all together? wouldn't that attract coyotes? No, it'll be great.
SUPFEMALE:You can say how nice she's fixed up the trailer.
SUPFEMALE:You can compliment her a lot.
SUPFEMALE:It's just what she needs.
OTHERMALE:Hey, i'll buy some beers.
LEADMALE:Well usually, i don't drink during the week unless-well, actually, there are no restrictions.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, it'll be great.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, this is just what she needs.
SUPMALE:Hey-hey, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:I think i found something i can afford with the money i'm making right now.
OTHERMALE:Listen to this: basement apartment, fully furnished, $125 a month.
OTHERMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:See if there's a phone number.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner was just seeing if there was any interest out there.
LEADMALE:Really, there's no rush, david.
LEADFEMALE:Is somebody coming over? what? No.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight? No.
LEADMALE:I mean, you never know, right? But no, uh there are three bowls of peanuts set out.
SUPMALE:Who's coming over, mark? Nobody.
LEADFEMALE:God, don't be so suspicious.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i'm not the one on trial here.
SUPMALE:Roseanne: surprise! hey you should have seen the look on your face! Is the whole family coming? Yeah, and they invited some people from the trailer park.
LEADMALE:Oh, so that's why they were running that can of deodorant back and forth out there.
SUPFEMALE:Art and karen are letting us use their trailer for coats.
LEADMALE:Come on, deej.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i better go change out of my work clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, mom.
LEADMALE:Sorry, dad.
LEADMALE:She didn't exactly seem too thrilled about us being here.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we should just go home.
LEADMALE:Oh, no way.
LEADFEMALE:Becky feels like crap about her life right now, but she's not gonna do anything to change it till we light a fire under her.
OTHERFEMALE:So tonight, we are going to pounce like sharks on a cramping swimmer.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be fun! You have a sickness.
SUPFEMALE:Obviously, the evil little guy in your head finally beat up the good little guy and chucked him out the ear hole.
SUPMALE:Woman, dan! evil little woman in my head! bev: yoo-hoo! is this the one? All these tin traps look the same! And just to make sure that becky will end up feeling really crappy about her life, i invited mom too.
SUPMALE:Come on in! Find me an empty lap, fellas, bev's here.
SUPMALE:Okay, now listen.
LEADMALE:This is the plan: we're gonna try to make becky feel really really good about her life, okay? So think of some really great things to say about the place.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it must be nice to vacuum the entire house and never have to change outlets.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah! That's great, mom.
SUPMALE:But save it.
LEADMALE:Wait till becky gets back here.
LEADMALE:Hi, grandma.
SUPMALE:You've never been to my place before, have you? No, and it's lovely.
SUPFEMALE:It proves you can do a lot with very very very little.
SUPMALE:Bev, can i get you a drink? We got wine, beer-beer.
LEADMALE:Beer? I'm in a.
SUPMALE:A.
SUPMALE:And besides, i never drank beer.
SUPMALE:When i drank, it was wine.
LEADFEMALE:And i miss it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll have a glass of red wine, thank you, dan.
SUPFEMALE:No problem.
SUPMALE:Only 12 steps away.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be very careful not to spill, dear.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think they make this kind of carpet anymore.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I've been thinking all day of nice, uplifting things i can say to becky.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Can i buy one off ya? darlene, where should i put this beer? Oh, go ahead and put it in the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:Unless, of course, we're already in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:Hey, come on in, everyone! Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Mark! You said a couple of people.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but that's only a couple of people by the true definition of the word "people.
LEADMALE:" well, maybe you and your girlfriend should come over and have dinner sometime.
LEADFEMALE:Are you a jew? No.
SUPFEMALE:Catholic? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Queer? No.
LEADMALE:Maybe you and your girlfriend should come over for dinner some night.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mom, why don't you tell becky how much you like her curtains? Mm, the curtains.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, how fun! Most people are not creative enough except to use them in the shower.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, would you stop flirting with me? I'm a married woman.
LEADMALE:I'm-i'm sorry, you guys.
SUPMALE:This isn't exactly the best place to have a party.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i'm having a great time.
LEADMALE:I just wonder what the poor people are doing tonight.
LEADMALE:Mark, your toilet's overflowing! damn it! that only happens because people put too much paper in here! the water's coming this way! You better stop it before it gets to the carpet in here.
LEADMALE:Why doesn't everybody in the kitchen take their shoes off and sop it up with their socks? That's a good idea.
SUPMALE:Mark! Uh, you're right.
LEADMALE:Bad idea.
LEADFEMALE:I better, uh jack up this end of the trailer.
SUPFEMALE:Well, becky, cheer up.
LEADFEMALE:You've still got friends.
LEADMALE:A toast to becky! becky! the richest woman in lanford! I'd like to thank you all for being here on the worst night of my life.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Pardon me.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, becky's certainly got her knickers in a twist.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:And it's all your fault, mom, because you're such a passive-aggressive witch.
LEADMALE:I owe you a brunch.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Excuse me! Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Here, take him.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Hi, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne: move! How did i end up like this? This isn't exactly where i expected to be at 21.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's all mark's fault! If he hadn't wasted the last four years of my life i'd be the one getting big job offers.
LEADMALE:Sure wouldn't be living in this hellhole.
LEADFEMALE:You can't go blaming all the problems you got on mark.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, true, they started when you met him.
LEADFEMALE:And they have continued the whole time you've been with him.
LEADMALE:And he was too dumb to know that the party tonight would totally embarrass you like it did, but where was i going with this? That it isn't mark's fault.
SUPFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADMALE:Well, it's your fault! Why didn't you stop me from marrying him? hey, you eloped, remember? We did what we could to stop you.
SUPFEMALE:And besides, that was the night that the season premiere of "cop rock" was on.
OTHERMALE:What am i gonna do, mom? Oh, becky.
SUPFEMALE:You still have a lot of time to figure out what it is that's gonna make you happy, figure out how to do it, and then go ahead and do it, you know? Don't waste what you got like i did.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's-it's too late for me, but, you know, you're still young, becky.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm already 21.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too old.
LEADFEMALE:To marry jerry seinfeld, yes.
LEADMALE:But to do anything else on earth, no.
LEADFEMALE:You know, becky, we'll be there and we'll support you and help you, whatever we can do, but you're the one that's gonna have to-you know, make the change yourself.
SUPMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh my god! I can't believe he's actually jacking up the trailer.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you just tell him to pull that cork out of the hole in the floor? You threw a nice party, mark.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, you looked a little bit bummed out lately.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it would cheer you up.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, it did.
OTHERFEMALE:Mark oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Mark, this is something i've never shown to you.
LEADFEMALE:It's from the university of illinois, i applied there when i was a senior.
SUPFEMALE:Man, the post office sucks.
LEADMALE:Well, i was accepted, mark.
LEADFEMALE:But we got married and moved to minneapolis and now sometimes i wonder what would have happened if i had gone to college instead.
OTHERMALE:Well, i can tell you what would've happened.
SUPMALE:It would have taken us four years longer to get where we are today! Look.
LEADMALE:I want to go to college, mark.
LEADMALE:I want to be a-a paramedic or a physical therapist or-wait, wait, you want to be like a doctor? Yeah! Yeah, well maybe, i don't know.
OTHERMALE:I don't know, the sky's the limit.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, this is crazy.
LEADFEMALE:You're talking about a lot of money here, and moving.
SUPMALE:Hey, look, i know it'll be hard, but it'll be exciting.
LEADFEMALE:Where's this coming from all of a sudden? what about the plans we had? We never had plans, mark.
LEADMALE:You go to work, i go to work, we go to my parents on sundays.
LEADMALE:Every week is the same and will be for the rest of our lives.
OTHERFEMALE:What about our plans to start a family? Or have you forgotten that we've been trying like hell to have a kid.
OTHERMALE:Actually, mark, i want to go back on the pill.
SUPFEMALE:What? But it was loads of fun trying, big guy.
LEADMALE:I can't believe all that sex was for nothing! Come on, mark.
SUPFEMALE:No, becky.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't want to have a baby and you hate your life.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? Nothing! i've just been thinking about things and i got to talking to mom tonight, and you know-i knew it! I knew your mother had something to do with this.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, she is playing us like a fine wine! Well, she has a point, mark.
LEADMALE:I mean, what if i was pregnant? I'd be trapped just like her.
LEADFEMALE:And i don't want to spent the rest of my life raising kids in a trailer park! It's a mobile home community.
LEADMALE:Hey, i'm sorry if i sprang this on you too suddenly.
LEADFEMALE:But do you have any idea what this will mean for us? Yep.
LEADMALE:Yep.
SUPMALE:I know what it means, all right.
LEADMALE:Who's got the cutest little face in this whole family? huh? who's got da prettiest, cutest wittle face in dis whole family? You do, mother.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you very much! hey, can i talk to you for a minute? what you wanna talk about, mark? i just have one thing to say to you: get the hell out of our lives! You got it? Pretty gutsy there, mark.
LEADMALE:But you know that david and goliath was just a story they made up to sell bibles.
LEADFEMALE:You have no right to tell becky that she should do stuff to change her life.
LEADMALE:Why? she's pretty well wasted it up till now, don't you think? maybe it hasn't been perfect, okay? But it's been pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:There's no reason for her to go to college to become a physical therapist or a doctor or something.
LEADFEMALE:Doctor, huh? Wow, way to go, becky.
SUPFEMALE:Now, all i have to do is to create a lawyer and a union plumber and i shall control the world! It's gonna ruin everything.
SUPMALE:How, mark? how is having a successful wife who is a doctor gonna ruin everything? Well, she's talking about me quitting my job already and us moving out of lanford.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no need to fear, mark.
SUPMALE:I'm sure that your mcdonald's game pieces are negotiable in other states.
SUPFEMALE:And we were gonna start having a family.
LEADMALE:Now all of a sudden she wants to wait.
LEADMALE:And she decides all this without even talking to me.
SUPFEMALE:You mean, she didn't talk to you about any of that? No no.
SUPFEMALE:She just went ahead and made all these ridiculous plans without me.
LEADFEMALE:And let me ask you this: how's she gonna go to college, go to work, and still have time for me? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:She's a real strong person, mark.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure if anybody can do it, she can.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think she can do it alone? oh, alone? why, mark? are you gonna leave her over this? I would not leave your daughter for anything.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what? are you scared that she's gonna leave you? Well, she's been cutting me out of everything else! Don't worry about it, mark.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just the usual becky selfishness.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go over there and talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:No no no! that's the whole point! i came over here to tell you to butt out of our lives and to leave us alone! Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, what are you doing here? Well, i just thought i-you know, wanted to talk to you about more stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not necessary, mom.
SUPMALE:I'm way ahead of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, i figure i'm a lock at u of i because they accepted me before.
LEADFEMALE:Now for grad school, i'm thinking maybe university of chicago or northwestern.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? Well, i think it's fantastic, but-yeah, me too.
SUPFEMALE:And i'm also thinking of-but! What's the "but"? Mark is the "but.
LEADMALE:" no, i must keep going with my point.
OTHERFEMALE:Mark is totally freaking out because you haven't even consulted him in all these plans you've been making.
LEADFEMALE:He talked to you? No, it's more than that.
SUPFEMALE:He came over and he, uh actually stood up to me.
LEADFEMALE:But luckily for him i had already eaten.
LEADMALE:What are you getting at, mom? I think you're being a little selfish here, becky.
LEADMALE:And i think, you know, maybe you're gonna mess up your marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, mother.
LEADMALE:My marriage is gonna be just fine.
LEADMALE:Well, then how come mark has this feeling like he's gonna be left behind? Mark's not gonna be left anywhere.
OTHERMALE:Okay, so-you don't know what you're talking about.
LEADMALE:So you're totally determined that you're gonna stay with mark, then? I asked you a question.
LEADMALE:Oh my god.
LEADMALE:So in your head it's already over? No.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you're the one who got me going to change my life.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but i didn't mean that you should throw out all these other parts of your life just because you get a new idea, becky! You gotta give mark a chance, at least.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, marriage is a big deal, you know? Mark really loves you.
LEADFEMALE:You don't want to mess this up.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, trust me.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's gonna be okay.
SUPMALE:You know, it's one thing to say that-mom! Everything's gonna be okay.
LEADMALE:Now i'm gonna go to the office supply store.
SUPFEMALE:You need anything? An office.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Where you going? I'm going to get some envelopes and stamps for those college applications.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? I thought i told you to butt out.
OTHERFEMALE:Now i find you here and she's gone off to get more college stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but you're totally wrong about becky, mark.
OTHERFEMALE:Because she has no plans to leave you at all.
LEADFEMALE:She wants to do all this with you.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, let me ask you this: how many mechanics do you know that are married to doctors? Congratulations, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:You've really worked this out pretty well for yourself, haven't you? You get a doctor in the family, and you finally get rid of me.
LEADMALE:Deep down, don't tell me you're not happy about it.
LEADFEMALE:Now i gotta work in the morning.
LEADMALE:Hi, i'm david healy.
SUPFEMALE:You've been assigned to be my employment counselor, mr.
SUPMALE:, uh parkin.
LEADFEMALE:I've been reviewing your file hey, mr.
OTHERMALE:Parkin! You're the guy mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner got fired from the buy-and-bag.
OTHERMALE:Conner? you know roseanne c-conner? I-i thought you worked at that restaurant that we ate at last week.
LEADFEMALE:I did! But thanks to your ms.
LEADFEMALE:Conner i was fired from there too! She got me so upset i broke a glass.
SUPMALE:You got fired for breaking a glass? Into her salad.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, uh that-that won't affect our relationship, will it? you listen to me, you snot-nosed little bastard! you're associated with the conners? there's no jobs here for you! get out! Parkin, what the hell is wrong with you? He's one of them.
OTHERFEMALE:He's a conner! I don't care who he is, you are fired.
SUPMALE:Of course i am.
OTHERFEMALE:This isn't over.
LEADFEMALE:This is far far from over.
OTHERFEMALE:Could you hand me my nameplate, please? 
LEADMALE: okay, we're nearing the end with me in the lead, actually-followed by darlene with 137 and becky with 123, and bringing up the rear, mark with a personal best of 73.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you're up.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:I've got it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just put down the y.
OTHERMALE:"buckety"? It's not a word.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course it is.
SUPMALE:It means "of or pertaining to or having the characteristics of a bucket," as in "when roseanne is angry, her mouth is quite buckety.
OTHERMALE:" i'm looking it up.
LEADMALE:Here's an interesting bit of trivia for you, david-milton bradley was killed by his girlfriend.
LEADMALE:Okay, uh the double-letter score is 24.
LEADFEMALE:You wouldn't give me "twinkie" but you give her "buckety"? Well, fine, you challenge her then.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, and then i'll go poke mom with a stick while she's sleeping.
SUPMALE:Oh, none of this really matters, 'cause i'm gonna win.
LEADFEMALE:What's gonna be this time, mark-"it" or "is"? Read it and weep, smart guys-"oxygen.
OTHERMALE:" wow.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, that's "x" on the triple-letter score plus triple-word score is 99.
OTHERMALE:Add that onto what he has my god! That puts mark in the lead.
SUPMALE:Oh, i won! i won! i finally won! The knowledge in my head is quite buckety.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the boss of you i'm the boss of you and i've always been the boss of you.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Uh "oxygen" is not a word.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, she's right.
SUPMALE:"oxygen"? That's not a word.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Ahem.
OTHERFEMALE:It-it's an abbreviation.
SUPMALE:Bull, i saw it on air tanks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah, of course.
LEADFEMALE:That's because they have to use the abbreviation 'cause the full word wouldn't fit on the air tank.
OTHERMALE:Unless you printed it vertically, which is-uh which is-which is just against the law.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Ahem.
OTHERMALE:"it.
LEADFEMALE:" yeah, i'm sure this time.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what i want.
LEADMALE:All right, now deliver that to 714 delaware street, lanford, illinois.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, i think i left my credit card here.
SUPMALE:Oh, never mind.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, pumpkin, i just don't feel like going out tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I mean i know it's saturday, okay? But, gee, not every night has to be a party.
OTHERFEMALE:Every night? We never go out.
LEADFEMALE:The olympic torch goes out more often than we do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm tired after work, okay? Besides, it's hard being around people after being around that all day.
SUPMALE:Oh, sticks and stones may break my bones, but at least they're not part of my sex life.
SUPFEMALE:He never wants to do anything but lie around the house.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know how he can call himself gay.
LEADFEMALE:So what? He just came out of the closet and headed straight for the couch.
LEADFEMALE:So what time do you think nana mary's gonna get to my place tonight? Well, if she remembers her glasses, she'll be in lanford in an hour and if not, she'll be in lansing by midnight.
LEADMALE:She was so excited to meet my andy, she must be dying to meet jerry.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know, she's excited to have someone else in the family that has a soft spot in their head.
SUPMALE:Well, look at this-my first paper tip.
LEADMALE:The conner luck is changing.
LEADMALE:Invest.
SUPMALE:Hey, honey, got those sandwiches for the poker game? Yeah, i do.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I made them last week so you'll have to nuke them for about 10 seconds to reactivate the grease.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, honey.
SUPMALE:Hey, maverick, why don't you invite leon and scott for your poker game tonight? Oh, that sounds wonderful.
LEADMALE:What time, dan? Love to have you.
LEADMALE:You know, he just may go for this.
LEADFEMALE:I'll pass it off as a new and different cultural experience.
LEADMALE:Yeah, dan got the jalapeno doritos this time.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, what are you doing? It's supposed a night out for the guys.
LEADMALE:What, you don't count them as guys? No, it's not that.
LEADFEMALE:They're married-they'll be nagging each other all night long about how much they drank, how much they're betting-is that $5 of your money or our money? Yip yip-yip, yip-yip, yip yip yip.
SUPFEMALE:It'd be like if you came.
LEADMALE:Okay, they can come.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i tried.
LEADMALE:I tried everything.
LEADFEMALE:He absolutely will not come to this poker game.
LEADFEMALE:Well, did you let him know that i'm not gonna be there? I'll bring the dip.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's your great-grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Nana mary is really kind of crazy.
LEADFEMALE:She drinks too much and she's loud and obnoxious, but she's got some killer stories about the depression.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, jackie.
SUPMALE:Look at andy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh, andy.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:Could you run down to the drugstore, please, jackie, and get me a pack of smokes? Maybe later-yeah, nana.
SUPFEMALE:All right, honey.
SUPMALE:Oh, rosie, hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:This here is your great-grandson jerry garcia conner.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, jerry.
LEADMALE:Oh, he's cute.
OTHERFEMALE:He's cute-big.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, fourth baby or not, this one really had to hurt, huh? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Do you wanna hold him? No, they all drip.
LEADMALE:I'll hold him when he's three.
LEADMALE:Okay, naptime.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that sounds great.
LEADMALE:I'm ready.
SUPFEMALE:No, she means the kids.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's okay too.
LEADMALE:Attaboy, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, so what's in the box here? I hope it's not more clothes from all your dead friends.
LEADMALE:It's all the toys that you and jackie used to play with when you came over to my house because your mother and father were trying to kill each other.
LEADMALE:Remember? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at this stuff.
OTHERMALE:This is all of our toys.
LEADMALE:This is gonna make me so sentimental.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but it's not all the toys.
LEADFEMALE:Anything that was worth any money went to pay for my new hip.
SUPMALE:This box actually smells like the 1950s.
LEADMALE:Oh ike.
LEADMALE:It's gonna be so great, you know? Just like old times, the three of us sitting around and remembering all the old stuff that used to happen.
SUPFEMALE:Well, her hair is already short, but, just for old times' sake, let's get the scissors anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Kings bet 50¢.
SUPMALE:Uh, i'm in.
SUPMALE:I see you and raise you $1.
SUPMALE:Ooh.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'm out.
LEADMALE:Scott's probably bluffing like when he said he could cook.
LEADFEMALE:The dealer is in.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you're just upset because you're down $10.
LEADMALE:I am in.
LEADFEMALE:Or because it's been six weeks since the wedding and someone i know hasn't answered their share of the thank-you notes.
LEADMALE:And i've spent the last two weeks-hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought i told you guys no marriage talk.
LEADMALE:We're here to play cards, not chit chat.
SUPFEMALE:He's been chit chatting about the bulls game.
LEADMALE:Games are okay.
LEADFEMALE:Cars.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, cars are fine too.
LEADMALE:How about the arts? you follow the arts, bob? what is that, like theater? Yes, i keep up with the theater.
OTHERMALE:In a tabloid the other day i saw a picture of o.
SUPFEMALE:J.
SUPFEMALE:Going to "damned yankees.
SUPMALE:" oh man.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not talk about the-what, "damned yankees"? why not? I hear the choreography has verve.
LEADFEMALE:He meant o.
LEADFEMALE:J.
OTHERFEMALE:, bob.
LEADMALE:I mean some people are afraid to discuss it in mixed company.
LEADMALE:Yes, i for one am sick of o.
LEADFEMALE:J.
SUPMALE:He's on the golf course, he's making a video-i wish it would just go away.
LEADMALE:Why can't the man do what he wants? He was acquitted.
LEADMALE:Oh please.
SUPMALE:Oh, chuck, come on.
LEADMALE:I mean even you have to admit that trial was a joke.
SUPMALE:I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:I was happy with the way it came out.
LEADMALE:Me too! I'm getting another beer.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody want one? I brought salad.
SUPFEMALE:Look, chuck, please.
LEADMALE:The verdict was ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, all i know is it's hard for a black man to get a fair shake in this country.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:Well, you try being a gay man in lanford, illinois.
LEADMALE:I mean, there is nothing like-like having to correct the spelling when somebody paints "faggot" across your garage door.
LEADMALE:Hey, when was the last time you're driving down the street in a new car and pulled over for nothing? I mean, nothing.
SUPMALE:Hey, you know the pancake jamboree is this sunday? Leon, when i walk down the street, people know i'm black.
LEADFEMALE:Now when you walk down the street, for all people know, you're just another white guy.
LEADMALE:With a great ass.
LEADMALE:They don't care, scott.
OTHERMALE:Look, chuck, have either of you guys ever heard of a little thing called "gay bashing"? Look, don't talk to me about hate crimes.
LEADFEMALE:Most of them are directed at us.
LEADFEMALE:Guys guys guys! You've both made some valid points.
SUPMALE:Now can't we all just accept the fact that we've all got it tough? hey, happy, what do you mean "we"? what? Dan, you're a straight white male-you've got it easier than anybody in the whole world.
SUPMALE:Well, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, it may seem like that, chuck, but i'm telling you, lately us white males been getting blamed for everything.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's cause you did everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, i've never done anything in my life.
LEADFEMALE:Ask anyone.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, listen, i've been hearing a lot lately about how white men are to blame for everything, about how we have all the advantages, how we get all the breaks, but look at me and bob-we ain't living in no mansion.
LEADMALE:We had to struggle for everything we've got.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You've struggled for this? Shh.
OTHERMALE:Oh, roseanne's home.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:False alarm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i guess we do have some common ground, huh? Yeah! Coming around again, brothers and sisters.
LEADFEMALE:"not guilty" is not the same as "innocent," please.
LEADFEMALE:Why would a man get in a car and drive all the way down to-tell them about rosa lopez oh, please.
SUPFEMALE:That you read in the thing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, her.
LEADMALE:She's a man-rosa lopez is a man, all right? Can't hear, can't hear, can't hear oh, you should see him sleeping in there.
LEADMALE:It's so cute, you wouldn't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Aww.
LEADMALE:You know, jerry had pulled all the covers up over himself and little andy is like laying there shivering and his face is pressed up against the crib bars.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i hope you took care of it.
LEADMALE:Took care of what? well, let's-let's go through the box now, okay? No, we can't do it while nana mary is still sleeping.
LEADMALE:That's totally inconsiderate.
SUPFEMALE:But-roseanne, don't.
OTHERMALE:You know her, she's not gonna wake up.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me give her one more shot.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, there goes tyrone power in his underwear! All right, we're going in without her.
OTHERMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, it's like stepping into a time warp.
LEADMALE:And finding a great big box of crap.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:Ah, man, and i was six before i realized this was not a pet.
LEADMALE:This is my cast, when i broke my arm.
LEADMALE:What's this doing with nana mary? don't you remember? She thought you were acting like a big baby.
LEADFEMALE:So she cut it off a week earlier with her pinking shears.
SUPMALE:And to this day it is hard to get a blazer to lay right on me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, look at this.
LEADMALE:"princess isabella" lives.
OTHERFEMALE:Da-ta-da-da! We'll see if yours is in there.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, there you go, queen of the dirt monkeys.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing in my palace? I've come to dethrone you, princess.
SUPFEMALE:Come, my dirt-monkey minions! You shall never get my throne because your red, shiny monkey butt is too big.
SUPFEMALE:God, it's my doll.
SUPMALE:It's my mrs.
LEADMALE:Tuttle.
LEADFEMALE:Oh my god, i thought she was lost forever.
LEADMALE:Where have you been? I missed you so much! Well, her and mr.
LEADMALE:Tuttle got a little condo outside of fort lauderdale.
LEADFEMALE:So the last time i saw her-i know we were sleeping over nana mary's house and i had her with me before we went to sleep and when i woke up, she was gone.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i-yeah, probably, uh, you know, nana mary-she might've taken her away from you because-well, she thought you were getting too attached or something.
LEADFEMALE:And as i recall, you told me there was a string of dollnappings plaguing the area.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:My betsy wetsy was so nervous.
SUPFEMALE:So she held it in for days.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Tuttle was not kidnapped.
LEADFEMALE:And nana mary didn't take the doll.
SUPMALE:Of course nana mary didn't take the doll.
LEADMALE:A workman was cleaning out my attic and he found it stuffed behind some insulation.
OTHERMALE:Oh, i was so glad it wasn't another dead body.
LEADMALE:Dollnapper! thieving, evil, rotten dollnapper! admit it! admit it! Okay, i took her.
SUPFEMALE:Are you happy? no, on the contrary, it sickens me! Why, roseanne? Why would you take mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Tuttle? yeah, why? why does a chicken cross the road? To get at the gin! Come on, stop fighting and let's have a drink.
LEADFEMALE:It's getting dark.
LEADFEMALE:I took her because i hated her! Why? what did she ever do to you? Well, if you wanna know, just when we were little, you used to you know, think of me as some kind of a goddess.
SUPFEMALE:You would do whatever i wanted you to do, whenever i told you to do it and i liked that, jackie.
LEADMALE:I liked feeling all that control.
LEADMALE:And then mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Tuttle came around.
LEADMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:And then all of a sudden i just didn't matter anymore, did i? I'd be like, "come on, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Do you wanna go play jump rope?" and instead of just saying yes, you had to run and ask mrs.
LEADMALE:Tuttle if she wanted to play jump rope and of course she didn't want to play jump rope, did she? No, she wanted to play marbles or play with dolls or have a tea party.
LEADFEMALE:She never wanted to do anything that i wanted to do.
LEADFEMALE:Tuttle asked for it.
LEADMALE:So i smoked her.
LEADFEMALE:By shoving her behind some insulation! Turn her over, you will see what the rats did to her butt.
LEADFEMALE:Let me go check on jerry.
LEADMALE:Did jerry steal the blankets again? No, look.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, they're all cuddled up together.
LEADFEMALE:Nana mary: that's the way you two used to nap-cuddled.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, that sounds like a good idea-a nap around about now.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, roseanne, there's something that you need to know.
LEADMALE:You don't deserve to know it, but i'm gonna tell you anyway.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Tuttle loved you.
LEADMALE:Get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:She loved you, roseanne.
SUPMALE:I'd complain about you and i'd put you down and she always-always-stood up for you.
LEADMALE:This lady was in your corner.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know.
OTHERFEMALE:She should've told me.
LEADMALE:Well, it just wasn't her way.
LEADFEMALE:I hope they're nicer to each other than we were.
SUPMALE:They're gonna grow up practically brothers.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think jerry's like, gonna terrorize little andy, do you? no, how could that happen? Andy is older.
LEADMALE:But jerry is your kid, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:You used to mop the floor with me.
SUPMALE:He already took the blankets before.
LEADFEMALE:Next thing you know, andy will be stuffed in some insulation.
LEADMALE:No, he won't.
SUPMALE:We'll make sure we-you know, we'll break the cycle.
LEADFEMALE:And i promise i will make sure that jerry is as sweet to andy as i should've been to you.
LEADMALE:That'll still leave him open for a whole lot of pounding.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Nana mary: come on, everybody, it's sundown! Who's up for a daiquiri? I'll see that and bump it 50 cents.
LEADFEMALE:Aw.
SUPMALE:I'm telling you, that "damned yankees" was a terpsichorean delight.
SUPFEMALE:I'm always amazed with your philistine inclinations.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in.
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid i have to concur, bob.
LEADFEMALE:There's such an artificial studied formalness to so much broadway choreography.
LEADMALE:Give me martha graham any day.
SUPMALE:I don't know what the hell you're talking about, man.
LEADMALE:Martha graham? If you haven't seen the phoenix dance company, you haven't experienced dance.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bump one.
LEADMALE:Phoenix dance company is yesterday's mummenschanz.
SUPMALE:Hey, don't knock mummenschanz.
LEADMALE:Mummenschanz-that's where theater and dance merge.
SUPFEMALE:Gentlemen, let's get back to what we were discussing before.
OTHERMALE:I still maintain that the boston pops set classical music back 50 years.
OTHERMALE:Bob: hear hear.
LEADMALE:Oh oh! You know what this discussion reminds me of? Puccini's "la granada.
LEADFEMALE:" oh, oh, that vermeer exhibit in washington well changed my life.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Vermeer, bob, yes.
LEADFEMALE:But just as you are dealing this game, the artist in any field must acknowledge that his is a nabokovian presence.
LEADMALE:He must cast off any pretense of a studied and artificial naturalism.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:He must be wholly present in his work.
LEADMALE:All: i agree.
OTHERMALE:Read 'em and weep, suckers-aces, full eights.
LEADFEMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:That's three in a row.
OTHERMALE:I ain't playing here no more.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, can i borrow some sugar? No, i only have 21 and a half bags left.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we can't stay long anyway 'cause we're off to see the p-e-d-i-a "atrician.
SUPFEMALE:" why are you going to the foot doctor? We're gonna have a little talk about andy's verbal skills.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, why? is he still tankin' all his job interviews? I'm just worried about the way he's saying his words.
LEADMALE:Like, he won't say "triangle.
SUPMALE:" he says "tri-an-gle.
SUPFEMALE:" or "hel-lo.
LEADMALE:" pauly shore makes millions of dollars saying that.
OTHERFEMALE:So they're just gonna run some tests, check his palette, make sure his hearing's all right.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna borrow your book on child development, okay? Yeah, but it's really old.
SUPMALE:You probably should ignore that chapter on the heartbreak of polio.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, andy.
SUPMALE:What you got here? This is cool.
SUPFEMALE:Let me push this thing.
LEADMALE:Toy: hel-lo.
SUPMALE:Can you find the tri-an-gle? Jackie! A toast, my dear, to my six-months'-scheduled cost-of-livingding.
LEADFEMALE:The joke's on them 'cause your cost of living only went up you proud of me? What a man, what a man, what a mighty good man.
SUPMALE:Hey, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Chuck, bob.
LEADMALE:What are youse guys up to? Um, you know.
OTHERMALE:Nothin'.
LEADFEMALE:Um, just, um you know.
LEADMALE:Well, now that we caught up, i guess we'll see you later.
OTHERFEMALE:We kind of wanted to talk to dan about something, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of a guy thing.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Oh, no wonder i'm starting to feel all shy and giggly.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, dan? have you heard about the minimum-security prison they're building outside of town? they're building a prison in lanford? No wonder the beauty parlor's been so crowded lately.
LEADMALE:Um, well, they're-they're spending millions on this thing.
OTHERFEMALE:And we were wondering if maybe you'd be interested in getting the old crew together and putting a bid in on the drywalling? Look, i know you got it good at the garage, but this'd be a chance to make a pretty good chunk of dough.
SUPFEMALE:Look, guys, i appreciate you thinking of me, but i'm pretty happy where i am.
OTHERFEMALE:And he's not kidding.
OTHERMALE:That couch under him has hardly even faded.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure, dan? I mean, it's gonna be a bundle.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone in this town's gonna get rich.
SUPMALE:Really? Great, that gives us an excuse to leave.
LEADMALE:Look, guys, i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Hey, man, it's all right.
LEADMALE:It's all right.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, maybe i'll apply to be a guard.
SUPFEMALE:Picture me as a guard? I can picture you as a hostage.
LEADMALE:Well, if you change your mind, let us know, okay? Come on, bob.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, okay.
LEADMALE:Boy, you know, i always wondered what that canadian beer tastes like.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:It's really good.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:One less thing to wonder about.
LEADMALE:Now, my dear i believe we were celebrating.
LEADFEMALE:What shall it be first, the sex or the violence? If you're any good at the sex, i won't need to use the violence.
LEADFEMALE:He's almost got our new computer all hooked up.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna learn how to do the bookkeeping for the diner on that.
LEADFEMALE:Somehow.
LEADMALE:And you're gonna have fun on that too, honey.
SUPMALE:You're not gonna need that old thing anymore, 'cause that magic box sings and talks and plays music.
SUPMALE:It's kind of like grandma after her second manhattan.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, i've got you all set up here.
LEADFEMALE:All right, just show me the instruction pamphlet and away i go.
OTHERMALE:Dear god, what have i done? It's not that hard.
LEADMALE:You can do this.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be frightened.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Come here, little man.
SUPFEMALE:Now, are-aren't these supposed to give out some sort of a death ray? Not unless you press "control-alt-death ray.
LEADFEMALE:" take it back.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that hard.
SUPMALE:Here's that a-b-c software i was telling you about.
SUPMALE:And this one here will teach little andy how to count.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that big bird? That's him.
OTHERMALE:Well that-well, okay.
OTHERMALE:This can't be that bad, huh? I also set you up at america online.
OTHERFEMALE:Just click click and you're on the internet.
SUPFEMALE:You can get news, you can talk to people, it's really cool.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, can this thing play pong? Okay, uh i gotta get going to work, so have fun and if you have any problems, just give me a call.
SUPMALE:A.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:L.
OTHERFEMALE:Voice: welcome.
LEADFEMALE:You've got mail.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? dan: gee! d'oh! who put that there--? oh! Who put that there? why don't you just turn on the light? I didn't want to wake you.
LEADMALE:It's this whole prison drywall thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't get it out of my mind.
SUPMALE:Am i crazy, roseanne? should i go for it? Yes.
OTHERMALE:You gave that no thought at all.
OTHERMALE:Now should i do it? No.
SUPMALE:Roseanne! Do you think we could talk about this later, dan? Come on now, you're ruining our quality time together.
LEADMALE:I'm serious, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you already told 'em no.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to the i've-got-a-great-jobat-the-garage thing? is-is it such a great job? Well yeah, i mean it's the first steady money we've ever had coming in.
OTHERMALE:Except for that coupon scam we ran in the '70s.
LEADFEMALE:What? Just a reminder.
LEADMALE:My bedroom's right above yours.
OTHERMALE:Well yeah, sorry we woke you.
LEADMALE:But now that you're up, go mow the lawn.
SUPMALE:Now let's just look at the pros and cons.
SUPFEMALE:Now it's true, the garage is steady.
LEADMALE:And even if i got this prison job, that doesn't mean there's another job around the corner.
SUPFEMALE:So work slow.
LEADMALE:But the garage is boring.
SUPMALE:It fries my mind.
OTHERMALE:I come home every night, i'm like a zombie.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, not like when you were doing the drywall and you came home and you'd put on all those puppet shows.
LEADMALE:You'd wear those straw hats and strum that ukulele.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Yes, we know.
LEADMALE:Your bedroom is beneath ours.
LEADFEMALE:No, not that.
OTHERFEMALE:I was getting something to drink and the word ukulele caught my ear.
LEADMALE:I love the ukulele.
LEADMALE:Do you have a ukulele? Night.
LEADMALE:Night.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Now i'll lose all my city benefits if i quit.
OTHERMALE:But i'd be making twice as much money working for the prison.
SUPMALE:But it's a gamble, and should we be gambling with a new baby? Yeah, dan, you know when conners gamble, conners lose.
SUPMALE:Of course, there was that time at the state fair where you made that frog land on that lily pad.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Plus we got the diner.
OTHERFEMALE:We got two mortgages.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, and the diner needs new wallpaper and appliances and some of them golden arches.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, it's settled.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:I'm sticking where i am.
LEADFEMALE:Hallelujah.
LEADMALE:Hey, dan? yeah? Since you woke me up, i just want you to know that i'm gonna have some trouble getting back to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:So? So that means you are too.
LEADMALE:I knew that.
SUPFEMALE:Dan? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Just checking.
LEADFEMALE:My name is mommy and i will be your waitress tonight.
SUPFEMALE:We have specials on the menu including tender sweet peas, turkey in its own broth, and peaches.
LEADFEMALE:I know these are good 'cause me and your dad make peach daiquiris out of them.
LEADMALE:How long have i been a waitress? Well, not very long.
SUPFEMALE:And i'm just doing it till an acting job opens up.
SUPMALE:And your dad fixes trucks for the city and he's only doing that till another one breaks.
LEADFEMALE:The best thing about your dad's job is that it's secure.
LEADMALE:You know? Because the last big risk we took was having you and that was a very big risk, but that's just the kind of people we are.
SUPMALE:Or were.
SUPFEMALE:I know what you're thinking.
SUPMALE:You're thinking, "well, since you took such a big risk with me and that turned out so good, how come you're playing it safe now?" quit grilling me.
SUPFEMALE:Because, see, risks are for younger people, not us.
LEADMALE:See, when you get to be me and your dad's age, you want to know that you can do the same thing over and over again, you know, till you die.
LEADMALE:Okay, so let's just hypothetically say that your dad does take this job at the prison, right? and what about when that job's over? Then what is he gonna do? 'course, the way this country's going now, i think they're always gonna be building new prisons.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, 'cause, you know, the way people hardly have to pay for what they do at all, it kind of makes crime look like a really good thing to get into.
LEADMALE:So a lot more people are gonna be doing it, you know? And just by the sheer odds, a lot more of them are gonna get caught.
SUPMALE:So i think they're gonna be building a lot of prisons, man.
LEADMALE:I think those things are gonna start going up faster than starbucks.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and then, like, the people in these prisons you know, they're gonna need to eat.
SUPFEMALE:So me and jackie, maybe we get in on the ground floor with some catering kind of business, you know? And pretty soon convicts from all over the world will be coming to eat loose meat in lanford, illinois.
LEADFEMALE:Dan? That's it.
LEADFEMALE:You're quitting that boring job at the city, and you're gonna apply for that construction bid.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
LEADMALE:What? No, i've really been thinking about this for, you know, the last couple of minutes, and this is a big opportunity here and i think we should take it.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, is this your way of telling me that you drank all my beer? No, i was just sitting here, and i was talking to the baby and-okay, this sounds pretty grounded already.
SUPMALE:No, dan, he made me realize that the thing that was always so great about us is that we always took a chance, you know? And this is a chance.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you're going awful fast here.
LEADMALE:Slow down a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You know you want to do this.
LEADMALE:Let's take the risk.
LEADMALE:Look at him, dan.
LEADMALE:He is just the greatest success we have ever had.
LEADMALE:Something's in the air.
LEADMALE:I mean, look it, darlene gets offered all these really great jobs and becky's applying to colleges and everything's changing, dan.
LEADFEMALE:It's like we're on some huge cosmic roll now.
LEADFEMALE:I guess.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should go for it.
LEADMALE:All right, let's go for it.
LEADMALE:Yeah! All right, here.
OTHERMALE:Take over.
SUPMALE:'cause this is my last day as a city employee's wife, so, fedco, here i come.
LEADFEMALE:Just brought over some more software for andy.
SUPMALE:Hey, you're on the internet.
SUPMALE:Looks like you really got the hang of that thing, huh? I've just been playing around with it a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:I brought over "treasure math storm.
SUPMALE:" it's a little old, but let me put it in.
SUPFEMALE:No, david! David, i'm just right in the middle of something here.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Jackie, aren't those the same clothes you had on yesterday? I don't know, maybe.
LEADMALE:Clothes are clothes.
LEADMALE:What's your point? are you all right? god, have you even left this thing since i last saw you? David, i'm fine.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, i'm just a little distracted.
LEADMALE:So how's school? I graduated last spring.
LEADFEMALE:You were there.
LEADMALE:Good good, so you got finals coming up then? jackie, are you even listening to me? I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Oh my god, you haven't left this thing.
LEADMALE:You're addicted to the internet.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm not.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADMALE:I've seen this before.
LEADFEMALE:I lost two friends to this.
LEADFEMALE:They were weak.
OTHERFEMALE:They were weak, i am strong.
LEADFEMALE:Where's andy? He's fine.
LEADMALE:He's in his room with his toys.
LEADMALE:I've got him on the monitor.
OTHERMALE:Okay, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's time to turn off the computer-no no, not now, david.
SUPFEMALE:I'm learning useful things.
LEADFEMALE:I'm growing as a person.
OTHERMALE:You're in the "urkel" chat room.
LEADMALE:What? what are you doing? I'm gonna unplug you, jackie.
OTHERMALE:David, get away from that right now this is for your own good, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a second, dav-oh god! you can't treat me like this! Plug me back in.
LEADFEMALE:I'll quit tomorrow, i promise.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't take it from me now, man! I need it.
LEADFEMALE:Just five more minutes.
LEADFEMALE:I hate you! Jackie, look at yourself.
LEADMALE:What time is it? Okay, um, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:I'll fix us both some tea, okay? Okay.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:She's here.
SUPMALE:She's here.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you get it? We don't know.
LEADFEMALE:We were waiting till you got here to open the envelope.
LEADFEMALE:You'd better have got it, 'cause i had to sleep with the architect and the warden.
LEADFEMALE:Long wait's over, boys.
LEADMALE:Rejection or selection, this is it.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:I've never gotten anything in a big brown envelope that i could open in front of other people.
SUPFEMALE:I'm-i'm sort of afraid to open it.
LEADFEMALE:So? who's gonna do it? People say luck is a lady.
LEADMALE:So you want me to go find you a lady? Come on, roseanne! Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, all right.
SUPMALE:Oh jeez.
LEADFEMALE:What what what what? I can't get that song, "afternoon delight" out of my head.
SUPMALE:Roseanne! You got it.
LEADMALE:This will get me out of debt and i can take that vacation to the bahamas.
LEADMALE:Oh man, this is a big-screen tv, a new truck, a pair of cowboy boots.
LEADMALE:I'll take the rest on a gift certificate.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, we hit it so big, i can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna be able to pay off the house and the cars.
SUPMALE:And you know what we're gonna end up with, dan? A crappy house and two crappy cars.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess my reputation in the construction industry is still top-notch.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to blow my own horn.
LEADFEMALE:Oh come on, honey, for me, please.
LEADMALE:Woooo! Thanks for standing behind me on this one, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah well, i was back there making faces anyway.
LEADMALE:"please be available to get together, blah blah blah complete list of employees, blah blah blah please inform us of any ownership changes as this decision is partially based on your minority-owned status.
SUPFEMALE:" i don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:I do.
SUPMALE:Hold it.
LEADMALE:Hold it.
LEADMALE:We got this job because you're black.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i mean, god, does that mean that we're not the best men for the job? No, bob, we're the best.
LEADFEMALE:And we know we're the best and we got the stuff to back it up.
LEADMALE:We just got a break.
SUPFEMALE:And damn, it's good to finally get one.
LEADMALE:I've been working so many years, man, and watching other guys somehow get all the breaks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now i got one and i earned it.
SUPMALE:We all earned it.
LEADFEMALE:Nice going, partner.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't have done it without you.
LEADMALE:Well actually, i guess i could have.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call up my old lady.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And i'm gonna call no, i'm gonna get one of them canadian beers.
LEADFEMALE:Well, honey, guess what i'm getting you for valentine's day? You know what they say, a gal can never have too many cans of 3-in-1 oil.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna give you some of that prison money to fix up the diner.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:We're really gonna do good with this money too, dan.
LEADMALE:We're gonna really really do good 'cause i figured out how rich people stay rich.
LEADFEMALE:How's that? Lottery tickets.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Well, last day on the job, boys.
LEADFEMALE:So tomorrow when we come in to have our free coffee and doughnuts, it won't technically be legal.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan, i just wanted to thank you for taking me with you and bob on this new drywall job that you got.
LEADMALE:Well, mark, we looked at a lot of applicants.
LEADFEMALE:We found out you were the only one married to my daughter.
LEADMALE:So i guess i'd better pack up all my personal stuff and take it home.
LEADMALE:There.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll miss this place, dan? I don't know, bob.
LEADMALE:I'll have my memories.
SUPFEMALE:Like this-i bet i've stapled with this thing.
LEADMALE:And how many times have you guys come in here and caught me using this crazy tape dispenser? I've never seen you use that.
OTHERFEMALE:Pens, pencils, paperclips-memories, memories, memories.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess that about does it.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call rosie and tell her i'm on my way home.
LEADFEMALE:Tell you one thing, mark, the city of lanford is losing a great asset right there.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure they can get another stapler, bob.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, honey.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we're just about done here.
OTHERFEMALE:No, i just wanted my last call from the office to be to you.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:Okay, bye-bye.
LEADMALE:I guess that about does it.
LEADMALE:This is dan conner punching out.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe we forgot this.
OTHERMALE:Hey, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, i wanna show you something.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay okay, but this better be good, because they're showing that "full house" where they think one of those little twins is dying.
SUPFEMALE:Looky here.
SUPFEMALE:It's our massive accumulation of bills.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get the lighter fluid.
LEADMALE:No no no no.
OTHERMALE:See, i've sorted them by when they were received-clinton, bush, reagan.
LEADMALE:See here where it says, "amount enclosed"? I thought it might be fun to put a number in there.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Because we can.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
SUPMALE:Not only did they give me last week's pay, but i got my unused vacation time and drew the money out of my pension fund.
SUPMALE:If i had known all you had to do to clean up like this was quit your job, i'd have done it long ago.
OTHERFEMALE:I've never even seen a check for that amount of money before.
SUPMALE:What does that comma mean? You know, if we pay everything off, we'll finally be debt free.
LEADMALE:So we gotta be smart here.
LEADMALE:I say we pay half the bills and split the rest between an aggressive money market and a conservative mutual fund.
LEADMALE:I was practicing that all the way home.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but you know, i think you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:If we're going to invest it, we shouldn't put it all in one place.
LEADMALE:I say we put half of it into the mattress and the other half in tomato cans buried under the bush in the backyard.
SUPFEMALE:Well, wherever we put it, it's gotta be safe and secure.
LEADMALE:We really do have to make a mature decision about this.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna go to paris! I hear that the french people are really rude and they hate americans, so i will, like, totally fit right in there.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i know.
SUPMALE:That's stupid.
LEADFEMALE:But what about england, or, you know, italy, or china, or even canada? But not canada, because we can already buy their bacon here.
SUPFEMALE:I know! I've got it.
SUPMALE:I've got it.
OTHERFEMALE:There's someplace we could go to see all of these places at once.
LEADMALE:International house of pancakes.
SUPMALE:No, but i'll give you two hints.
SUPMALE:Florida, and the happiest place on earth.
SUPMALE:We're going to gator world.
SUPFEMALE:No, you idiot.
LEADFEMALE:Disney world.
SUPFEMALE:It's perfect, because they have that epcot center thing, okay? So, like, say you're in italy and you get really bored.
OTHERFEMALE:You just walk over to china, okay? I know for real that in the real world that would actually take days.
SUPFEMALE:We can't blow my hard-earned cash on a vacation.
LEADFEMALE:I hear they have something called a beer garden.
SUPFEMALE:Hot dog! It'll be so great.
SUPFEMALE:We'll take the whole family.
LEADFEMALE:Oh them.
LEADFEMALE:No, think about it, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Becky's applying for college and darlene's gonna be graduating soon.
LEADMALE:This is probably the last chance we will ever get for a family vacation.
LEADMALE:Well, we could sleep on it i guess and-hey, everybody! cancel next week! we're going to disney world! We can discuss it in the morning.
LEADMALE:Maybe can we just do this meeting without becky? in fact, while we're at it, can we do everything without becky? No, she's part of this family.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not having a family meeting without her.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, i just called her.
SUPFEMALE:She'll be here any minute.
SUPFEMALE:Did i hear right? we're going on vacation? Announcer: ladies and gentlemen, the role of becky, originally played by lecy goranson, then by sarah chalke, then by lecy goranson, will be played this evening by sarah chalke.
LEADFEMALE:The taking of flash photographs or use of recording devices is strictly prohibited.
LEADMALE:Disney world? I've always wanted to go there.
OTHERMALE:Aren't you glad that you're here this week? wait, isn't that the place where happy families go to have fun? We're not letting that stop us.
SUPMALE:Can mark go? Damn.
LEADMALE:He is family.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:What about aunt jackie? Of course.
LEADMALE:She's family.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be in the basement, i guess.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, david, get a grip.
SUPMALE:Of course you're family.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i love mickey mouse! i love mickey mouse! i love mickey mouse! you will stop that now! Your job is to contact a travel agent and make sure you get us a really good package deal.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we've got a lot of prep work that needs to be done before we can make this happen.
SUPFEMALE:For instance, we need to pack our clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, go down to the luggage store.
SUPMALE:Look in the dumpster in the back, bring us the boxes.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, your job: get to the airport early, collect a lot of those carts and turn the quarters over to me.
LEADMALE:What about the baby? Oh yeah, well somebody does need to take care of the baby.
LEADMALE:Now that person will not be able to go on any of the rides and will have to sit there every single day listening to the rest of us talk about how much fun we're having.
LEADFEMALE:So that's gonna be pure torture.
LEADMALE:We'll get mom.
SUPFEMALE:What's my job? Cancel the paper.
LEADMALE:You mean cancel the neighbor's paper.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that would be the paper, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, while i'm at it, i'll also shut down the gas, the electricity, the water.
SUPFEMALE:We're not moving.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, i've never done this before.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, well, we're all set.
LEADMALE:Mom.
SUPMALE:Oh yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Start practicing your limp, because we're gonna wanna park close to the terminal.
SUPMALE:No, school.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think my teacher's gonna let me go.
LEADMALE:We're supposed to make a model out of something from ancient greece by next week.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think i could live with myself if i just blew it off.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you are not going to spoil our family vacation, okay? You are a conner.
SUPMALE:You are skipping school, blowing off that project.
LEADMALE:Now you sit down here.
SUPFEMALE:Turn on that television, watch it, and think about what you just said.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, i found us a great fare to orlando, but they only have six seats and we need eight.
LEADMALE:So should we go ahead and order pet carriers for d.j. and mark? Children children children, pay very close attention here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm about to pass on an old family secret.
LEADMALE:Hello, yes, i'm going to need to cancel my reservations for the 4:15 flight on sunday to orlando.
SUPMALE:My name is smith.
SUPMALE:Oh, damn.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, hello, this is mrs.
LEADMALE:Miller.
LEADFEMALE:And i'm going to need to cancel my reservations for the 4:15 flight on sunday to orlando.
LEADFEMALE:It's not? Well, perhaps it's booked under my maiden name.
SUPMALE:Yes, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:Habib.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, that is it.
SUPMALE:Cool, thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:Oh no, i won't need to reschedule at all.
SUPFEMALE:Praise allah.
LEADFEMALE:Call them back.
LEADFEMALE:I think they got an opening now.
LEADFEMALE:Yet another federal offense i've witnessed in this house.
LEADFEMALE:Man, everything is totally coming together, and why? Because i am the puppet master.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, don't kill me.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone wants something from me.
LEADMALE:Big trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been going over the diner schedule.
LEADFEMALE:There's no way we can get out of our shifts.
LEADMALE:Leon can't work extra hours and nancy's taking off to go to the erotic cartoon festival.
LEADFEMALE:I tried calling former employees, temporary agencies-there's nothing we can do.
LEADMALE:Damn it.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:I'm surprised i didn't think of this earlier.
OTHERMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:What'd you do? I just made our problem into leon's problem.
LEADMALE:So i hope he handles it better than we did.
LEADMALE:So how is the reservations there, david? We are all booked to orlando, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Or should i say, "mrs.
OTHERMALE:Habib.
SUPMALE:" well, grab your veils, gals.
LEADFEMALE:We are going to disney world! Look, i told you.
SUPMALE:The pilot said he's flying as fast as he can.
OTHERMALE:No, it's not about that.
LEADMALE:It's just my family is spread out all over the place.
LEADFEMALE:You think you could ask this nice lady if she'd move? No.
LEADMALE:And thank you for making us your airline.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where are we going to go first? Let me get the map.
OTHERMALE:Here, hold this.
LEADMALE:Dan, could you take him to see mom for a minute? Yeah, sure.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Whoa, he's gained weight since this morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Pardon me.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Hey did i miss a belt loop back there? Hey hey, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? how come we're not all weightless? We are.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just wearing special shoes.
LEADMALE:There's my little jerry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what's wrong, honey? Give me the juice, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:David, heads up.
LEADFEMALE:Man, disney world is huge.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, the blue part is the water and the brown part is the land.
LEADMALE:Why don't we make this home base? Yeah, that's a good idea.
LEADMALE:Okay, everybody, listen up now.
SUPMALE:If we get separated or you get lost from the herd, we'll all meet up in fantasyland.
SUPMALE:Wait wait.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean "if we get separated"? I mean this is a family vacation, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:We have to all stick together.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding, right? I mean, i'm not flying 1000 miles with you people just to sample waffles from around the world.
LEADMALE:I don't believe her.
SUPMALE:You will stick with the herd, young lady.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, dad.
LEADFEMALE:We have to split up.
LEADMALE:So what are you telling me? that you all feel like this? Hey, i have felt that way since i was four.
LEADMALE:Can you believe my kids not wanting to be with me? That is shocking.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be with you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Damn it, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I took care of every single problem that would have ruined our family vacation except one-our family.
SUPMALE:I gotta go check on my baby.
LEADFEMALE:Here, guard these pretzels as if they were potato chips.
LEADFEMALE:So, mom, is he okay? Yes, but i think he misses his mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, if you slide into that seat right there, then maybe i can get by.
SUPFEMALE:Oh man, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I hope that was a cheeto i stepped on.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever it was, it doesn't work anymore anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, jer.
LEADMALE:Come and take a walk with mama.
SUPMALE:There's mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Aw.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's so wonderful that men like you have found a niche in the airline industry.
LEADFEMALE:Your brothers and sisters are a bunch of ingrates.
OTHERFEMALE:Now i know how the queen mother feels.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, now this is living.
LEADMALE:Look at the size of these seats.
LEADMALE:I knew i wasn't dreaming.
LEADMALE:It's true.
LEADMALE:Rich people are fat.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look at this.
LEADFEMALE:It's got a footrest and the best magazines.
LEADMALE:Man, this is like supercuts! Hey, have you seen your mother? No.
LEADMALE:And hasn't this been a wonderful flight? She went that way through those curtains.
LEADMALE:Through those curtains? the first-class curtains? No conner's ever been through those curtains before.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well that's where she went.
SUPMALE:Well i'd better go after her.
LEADMALE:How do i look? Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Mom and dad up in first class.
LEADFEMALE:Guess they won't be taking any pictures for the brochures on this flight, huh? what's going on? They're still up there.
LEADMALE:Why hasn't that flight attendant kicked them out? Well, it's probably a little hard to do when you're hog-tied.
LEADMALE:They probably got arrested and handcuffed the minute they went up there.
LEADMALE:Mark, go check on them.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, good idea, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Send a lifeless probe up to make sure it's safe.
LEADMALE:God, i can't believe you guys are trying to get my husband in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Why wouldn't you believe it? I was the one that put the plastic gun in his carry-on.
OTHERMALE:Hmm, still nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe there's no front to this plane and they're just-they're just walking off the edge.
SUPFEMALE:Well, in that case, i'd better get on the air phone and warn the village below.
SUPMALE:Come on, david.
SUPFEMALE:No no, darlene, no.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, david.
SUPMALE:Isn't there a cover charge or something? If they're all sitting up in first class, i'm gonna sneak up there too.
LEADFEMALE:I'm joining you! no, mom! mom! mom! oh, stewart! My towel's beginning to cool.
SUPMALE:Ooh, oh, ow ow ow! ow ow ow ow ow ow! No no, not for my hands.
LEADFEMALE:I want that one on my feet.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, sir.
LEADMALE:You actually cut the crusts off of these? can i have them? mom, what is this? Oh, well that's what fish looks like before they cut it up into sticks and deep-fat fry it.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't eat it if i was you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, bud.
LEADMALE:Bud, you sure it's okay for us to stay up here? Oh yes.
LEADFEMALE:The other passengers all took a vote and insisted that you stay up here.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't that great, dan? We make friends wherever we go.
LEADMALE:I love it up here.
LEADFEMALE:This is my 10th glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice.
LEADFEMALE:My stomach kind of hurts.
LEADMALE:You know, this is pretty great, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, listen, we were thinking that maybe it would be kind of cool if we spend a little time together as a family once we get there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you know, not the whole time.
LEADMALE:You know what they say-nothing in excess.
LEADFEMALE:No, really.
LEADMALE:People really do say that.
LEADMALE:Oh, you guys, that is so nice.
OTHERFEMALE:I am so excited.
SUPFEMALE:We're going on a family vacation.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, it's totally awesome! ooh, everybody! Channel 12 on your headsets-nipsey russell! 
LEADMALE:I'll give you two hints-florida and "the happiest place on earth.
SUPFEMALE:" we're going to gator world! No, you idiot.
LEADMALE:Disney world.
LEADMALE:Well, we could sleep on it, i guess, and hey, everybody! cancel next week! we're going to disney world! And discuss it in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe we're actually staying in a room this nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and we're not even on jury duty.
SUPFEMALE:Pinch me.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , call the concierge and tell him to send someone up to pinch your mother.
SUPFEMALE:All righty.
SUPMALE:If you need room service, press 21.
LEADMALE:If you need housekeeping, press 22.
LEADMALE:You need the front desk, press 23.
LEADFEMALE:Any questions? Yes.
OTHERMALE:What is this "housekeeping" of which you speak? Rosie, take a picture of me with this lamp.
LEADMALE:Look, somebody left their robes in there.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry about it, son.
SUPFEMALE:We won't be making that same mistake.
OTHERMALE:No way.
SUPMALE:Your room is exactly like ours is.
LEADFEMALE:Did you check out the bathroom, dan? There's a phone in there.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh! There is.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, we got to get one of those for our house.
SUPMALE:No way, dan.
LEADMALE:You're not getting your own phone.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, deej, i bet you can't guess where the tv is.
OTHERFEMALE:Huh? huh? It's in the dresser, man! oh, wow! Look at this.
LEADMALE:There's a refrigerator down here, and it's filled with food and drink.
SUPMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:We're moving in.
LEADMALE:We have adjoining rooms! That's it.
LEADFEMALE:We're moving out.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene's taking a bath in the next room, and i'm gonna call her from your bathroom.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that great? Youse guys are not gonna believe this.
SUPMALE:Oh my god.
LEADMALE:It's just like on "the price is right.
LEADFEMALE:" incredible.
LEADFEMALE:And it's all man-made.
LEADFEMALE:I was reading about this.
SUPFEMALE:This used to all be orange groves, but that's not what one mr.
LEADFEMALE:Walt disney saw.
OTHERMALE:He saw that lake, he saw that castle, he saw that ample parking with convenient shuttle service.
OTHERFEMALE:And he set out to make that dream.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody, it's mickey mouse! Man, steak for breakfast.
LEADMALE:I feel like-like merv griffin.
SUPFEMALE:The waffles are huge.
OTHERFEMALE:After eating these, i don't know how those belgians get anything done.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we're gonna have so much fun, jerry.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna see a big, happy, smiling mouse-not like those ones in the traps at home.
LEADMALE:Man: room service.
LEADMALE:Them's beautiful words.
SUPMALE:Dan: ain't it? Here we are.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, did you bring me the sliced, cut-up kiwi like i ordered it? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:They're right there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's what they look like? I don't know what you're doing, but you're not gonna find any extra change under there.
LEADFEMALE:No, roseanne, he's sweeping the crumbs off the tablecloth.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Why? We could just shake it out the window.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, in that case, i believe i'll do something i've never before done in my entire life-a nice, fresh, crisp dollar for you, my man.
SUPMALE:Thank you, ma'am.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, yeah, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What was it? You're welcome.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to bring this up, but isn't this costing a fortune? Nobody should be worrying anything about money this whole trip.
LEADMALE:D.j. , go over to that there minibar and help yourself to another summer sausage.
LEADMALE:My stomach hurts.
SUPMALE:Attaboy! I've got number 45 sunscreen and big, floppy hats for all.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody has to worry, the corn is safe.
SUPMALE:It's time.
LEADMALE:All right, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Park opens in 15 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:This is not a drill.
OTHERFEMALE:Go go go go go.
LEADMALE:Dan: man, it's so clean.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:Look-i can see myself in the cement.
LEADFEMALE:I want to live here.
OTHERMALE:No, i want to be worthy of living here.
SUPFEMALE:I hear music.
SUPMALE:Am i dead? Okay, we're gonna be here for four days, so remember, we don't have to get out there and see everything at once.
LEADMALE:Yeah, let's pace ourselves, just take it real easy! Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Where are we gonna go first? Well, i'll go wherever, as long as i get my sandwich and my beer at lunch.
SUPMALE:They don't serve beer in the magic kingdom, dan.
LEADMALE:They do at epcot.
SUPFEMALE:Go.
LEADFEMALE:Ugh.
LEADFEMALE:Look at them.
LEADMALE:That's the second couple we've seen holding hands and skipping.
LEADMALE:Maybe we've wandered into some outdoor church.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I've heard of this.
SUPMALE:I think they're being happy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you'd think as long as we're sitting, we could go on something that moves.
SUPMALE:The earth is hurtling through space at 100,000 miles an hour.
LEADMALE:What more do you want? Listen, d.j. , darlene and i were thinking about just spending some time together-you know, people-watching, just talking, being a couple.
LEADMALE:Yeah, d.j. , there's plenty of girls around here your own age.
LEADMALE:Why don't you pick one out and start stalking? Come on, darlene, i just want to go on the rocket.
LEADFEMALE:Then i'll leave you alone for the rest of the day.
LEADFEMALE:Please? please? why don't i just go on one with him? It'll only take a minute, and then we can hang out.
LEADMALE:I give in.
LEADMALE:All this joy and happiness is breaking my spirit.
OTHERFEMALE:Go.
SUPFEMALE:See you soon.
LEADFEMALE:Make sure and pouf up your hair so you meet the height requirement.
LEADMALE:Is this the beer line? Oh, no, we're just looking at spaceship earth.
LEADMALE:I mean, look at this.
LEADMALE:It weighs 16 million lbs, and encompasses cubic feet of space.
SUPFEMALE:So this isn't the beer line? No.
SUPFEMALE:Phht! Look, jackie, that pigeon's a robot.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it is too.
LEADFEMALE:Look, it's totally fake.
OTHERFEMALE:It's eating, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Hey hey hey.
LEADFEMALE:Look at the old guy.
LEADMALE:He's a robot too.
LEADFEMALE:They probably made him out of a bunch of old pigeons.
LEADMALE:Stop, would you? Everything here is not a robot.
LEADFEMALE:And they haven't called it "robot" since the '50s.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:"animatronic americans.
LEADFEMALE:" would you stop littering? I'm not littering, jackie.
LEADMALE:This is a friendly competition.
OTHERMALE:Let me try that.
LEADMALE:Let me try that.

SUPMALE:You get your own.
SUPFEMALE:Now where's she gonna go with that, huh? where's she gonna throw that? over here? No.
OTHERMALE:Over there.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh! That's it.
SUPMALE:Hey, disney guy, come here quick.
LEADFEMALE:Don't, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Oh, you asked for it.
SUPMALE:This woman is littering and totally destroying my fantasy experience.

LEADFEMALE:Beating the turtle is his only shot at self-esteem.
SUPMALE:Come on, jerry.
LEADFEMALE:You're lucky, darlene, the kid was gonna lose.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't stand a chance against lightning.
LEADFEMALE:As ridiculous as this is, d.j. , jerry clearly could've beaten that turtle.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, maybe in a distance race, but not in a sprint.
SUPFEMALE:My baby brother could mop the floor with that reptile.

LEADMALE:Congratulations.
SUPMALE:Now nothing in this world can hold you back except your association with this family.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really proud of you, pal.
LEADFEMALE:If you save up for a couple of months you can get that studio apartment you had your eye on.

OTHERMALE:No, it's even better than that.
SUPMALE:I am going to be working at edelweiss gardens amusement park.

LEADMALE:I met the recruiter today at the mall.
SUPFEMALE:They interviewed me on the spot and said that i was perfect edelweiss gardens material.

OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna go call darlene and then i'm gonna leave notice at the pizza place.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't forget your severance pizzas.
SUPMALE:Nice room, david.
OTHERMALE:No windows to wash.
SUPMALE:Kind of like living in an empty swimming pool.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, with no pesky distractions.
OTHERMALE:Is it night? is it day? did i miss spring? It used to be a days inn.
LEADMALE:Wow, they really fixed this place up.
SUPMALE:Don't these banks and banks of fluorescent lights drain your energy? I think they give you energy.

LEADMALE:Doug, i was looking at your itinerary there.
LEADMALE:I got to tell you-you shouldn't read things on the wall in here, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Say goodbye now, david.
LEADMALE:Smile practice in 15 minutes, where you learn to be friendly to the customers.
SUPMALE:Wow, it's amazing.
LEADFEMALE:It's like he's got one regular smile, you know, and then there's that one.
LEADFEMALE:Man, david, you're gonna be a busy boy around here.
LEADFEMALE:David can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:He's one of us now.
LEADMALE:There it is again.
SUPMALE:Well i guess we ought to get out of your hair.

LEADMALE:We're still gonna be seeing you all the time, david.

OTHERMALE:We should go.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna be okay here, right, david? Oh yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:Uh, well remember to write us every day.
LEADMALE:And don't forget to include a photo of yourself holding up that day's newspaper.
SUPFEMALE:How did you get used to these ties? getting up so early? One sets one's mind to it-simply a matter of dominating the will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, see, i'm usually the dominatee.
SUPMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:All: morning, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Schlosser.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Schlosser.
LEADFEMALE:Are you fresh to our ranks? Yes, sir.
OTHERMALE:David healy.
SUPFEMALE:Uh ahoy.
LEADFEMALE:Sir.
LEADMALE:And how are we fitting in? Oh, pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty good.
LEADMALE:Nice people.
LEADMALE:I've already met some of you.
LEADMALE:Couldn't tell you which ones, but thank you, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Healy.
LEADMALE:Today's topic is character assimilation.
SUPMALE:This is where you learn not just to play but to be the park's signature mascot hans the hare.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that button nose, i couldn't help myself.
LEADMALE:Yes, hans is very funny.
LEADFEMALE:But remember, hans is not purely a comedian like a stan laurel or a sinbad; hans is an all-around entertainer.
LEADMALE:He sings, he dances, he has a fitness video.
LEADFEMALE:It's a full-body workout.
SUPMALE:It's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Now that you've read your "hans the hare" manual tell me what is this hans doing wrong? Hans does not wave constantly, but intermittently.
LEADFEMALE:Good! Hans only spins clockwise.
LEADFEMALE:Excellent! David healy what is hans doing wrong now? Uh, his ears aren't pointing to look, i'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I didn't have time to read my manual last night.
SUPFEMALE:I was so tired after those wind sprints.
SUPFEMALE:Class, help mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Healy.
LEADFEMALE:All: hans doesn't sit.
SUPFEMALE:"a sitting bunny is an invitation to mayhem.
OTHERFEMALE:" listen, mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Schlosser, i'm not sure i'm supposed to be here learning about how to play hans.
SUPFEMALE:I draw, i paint.
LEADFEMALE:I was told i was going to be in the art department.
LEADMALE:How many of you here are on the waiting list for the art department? Mr.
LEADMALE:Healy, if you're having second thoughts about joining the edelweiss family then by all means vacate your room and leave.
LEADFEMALE:Vacate my room? No no, mr.
LEADMALE:Schlosser, i'll stay.
SUPFEMALE:I'll stay and i'll be the best damn-darn hans the hare there ever was.
LEADFEMALE:I thought i was done filling out forms when we got this prison job.
LEADMALE:Every day they send me something new.
SUPFEMALE:I'm getting writer's cramp.
SUPFEMALE:See if they got any forms for workman's comp.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i heard something on the news about these government contractors getting all these kickbacks, you know? Find out how that works.
SUPMALE:Hi, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:May i come in? I'm sorry, but we already subscribe to "the watchtower.
LEADMALE:" what the hell are you knocking for? I haven't lived here for two whole weeks.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to be impolite.
LEADFEMALE:May i remind you where you are, young man? I'm just trying to be nice.
SUPMALE:At edelweiss we're supposed to be nice all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Guess it just kind of stuck with me.
SUPMALE:So how is everyone? Oh, everyone is just fine.
LEADMALE:But i won't be till you take off that stupid tie.
LEADMALE:I need it so i can shoot up.
SUPMALE:I'd really rather keep it on.
LEADMALE:Besides, i like looking nice.
SUPFEMALE:We have this little hans the hare motto: "my teeth brushed white, clothes wrinkle-free, i'm hans the hare, and i love me.
OTHERMALE:" then we kind of hop around a little.
LEADFEMALE:You won't be doing that here.
LEADMALE:What other stuff they got you doing there? Well, first they had me on the crusades adventure but soon i might be working on the fortress of fun or maybe even das glass-bottom boot.
LEADFEMALE:Have they got any adventures that don't have something to do with war? You know, like something happy like little bears or elves or-you know, this is out of my area, but you know what i mean.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure there are other rides, but i don't know the whole park yet.
SUPFEMALE:You'd better not let hans the hare find out about that.
LEADMALE:He'll give you some demerits.
OTHERMALE:How did you know about the demerits? You've got to be kidding me.
LEADFEMALE:No, all it takes is six demerits and then they send you to the edelweiss correction school for a month.
LEADMALE:Correction school? what's that, some kind of brainwashing camp? No, it says right on the brochure "this is not a brainwashing camp.
OTHERFEMALE:" yeah and i put the correct weight on my driver's license.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, this might not mean much to you but it's very important to me that i make this job work.
LEADMALE:Hey, david, looking good.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go comb my hair.
SUPMALE:I'm feeling a little unkempt.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you for the compliment, mr.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Would you look at that? Our david's turning into a man.
OTHERFEMALE:No he's not.
OTHERMALE:He's turning into some kind of buttoned down corporate rabbit robot.
SUPMALE:And the really scary thing is, did you see that tie? It's not even a clip-on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, roseanne, he's just trying to be part of a team.
LEADMALE:Team sports made me what i am today.
OTHERMALE:You made me what i am today.
SUPMALE:But team sports got me ready for you.
LEADMALE:We've got to help him, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:No, we've got to let go.
SUPMALE:He's over 18.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, as much as we love david he's not really our son.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not according to our last tax returns.
SUPMALE:Pardon me, hans.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:You can call me david.
SUPMALE:That's all right, hans.
LEADMALE:You know, i've always had a thing for hans the hare.
LEADMALE:I often dream that i'm even married to hans.
SUPMALE:I know that's silly.
SUPMALE:Or is it? Team leader in the room.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, everyone, we're expecting a full park today and i want to see a lot of children with happy faces because a happy face is all: a repeat customer.
LEADFEMALE:People today ends the twoweek probation period of our newest hans the hare.
LEADMALE:And in keeping with the grand edelweiss gardens tradition hans, today your head will be placed on by none other than the very first ever hans the hare.
LEADFEMALE:Never do anything to disgrace the bunny.
LEADFEMALE:Where's david healy? how did you get past the security goats? Well, actually i had no problem at all.
LEADMALE:Perhaps it was my lucky rabbit's foot.
LEADMALE:Ma'am i'm going to have to ask you to leave the magic rabbit hole.
LEADFEMALE:Pal, i'm gonna have to ask you to kiss my ass.
LEADMALE:Which one of you is david healy? They have no identity.
SUPMALE:They won't answer to any name except the one we've given them.
OTHERMALE:David healy: the kid who secretly hates animals; the kid who told me the buffalo got what they deserved.
LEADFEMALE:Which one of you is david now? Hans! Put your head back on.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't do it, david.
LEADMALE:Once the head is on it does not come off.
LEADMALE:David, no.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't know how many pimplyfaced teenagers have put their heads in there.
SUPMALE:Hans, follow your training.
LEADMALE:I trained you first, david.
LEADMALE:Here, sniff my hand to remember.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, why are you doing this? why are you trying to make me go home? Five words, david: you're dressed like a rabbit.
LEADMALE:They're giving me a job, a place to stay.
LEADFEMALE:I've been at your house too long.
LEADFEMALE:But david, you don't have to sell out everything you believe in just to pay the rent.
SUPFEMALE:I like it here.
LEADFEMALE:No you don't, david.
OTHERMALE:You just think you do because it's so easy.
SUPFEMALE:They do all your thinking for you.
OTHERFEMALE:They make all your decisions for you.
SUPFEMALE:They say "hop" and you say "how high?" three inches.
SUPFEMALE:Wake up, david.
LEADMALE:This place wants to be disneyworld, but it's just some creepy fascist copy.
LEADMALE:Today it's, "hi, i'm hans the hare.
LEADMALE:Welcome to the park.
SUPMALE:" but tomorrow it's, "i was only following orders.
SUPMALE:" i don't know what to do.
OTHERMALE:Well, i do.
LEADMALE:You're gonna go home with me now.
LEADFEMALE:That is if-if they let you.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Healy is free to leave.
LEADMALE:All edelweiss gardens employees have complete freedom.
LEADFEMALE:You say they have freedom, but do they really? are they free after work to go sit and have a beer and trash their boss like you can on any other job? No! And yet this place claims to represent what america stands for.
SUPMALE:Well, my america stands for more than $5 to park, $30 to get in, and $5 tasteless bunny-shaped hamburgers.
LEADMALE:Now if you will excuse us, david and i are going to get in my crappy car, drive along that polluted river where we could get carjacked or forced off the road by drunks, pull up in front of our house and run in before we are robbed.
LEADFEMALE:Because that, mister, is my america and i thank god we're free to enjoy it.
LEADMALE:Come on, david.
LEADMALE:No, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, i want to go back to edelweiss gardens so i can help people have fun again.
OTHERMALE:All right, let's go over this one more time: your name is david healy.
LEADFEMALE:You frown, you're introspective and you mope.
LEADMALE:I'm not listening.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not listening.
LEADMALE:I'm not listening.
LEADMALE:Listen to me, david.
LEADMALE:We don't whistle while we work.
OTHERMALE:We grumble and complain and encourage others to do likewise.
LEADFEMALE:No no no! no no no no! yes yes yes! Let me tell you a little something about your edelweiss gardens, david.
SUPMALE:It's mediocre food and mediocre fun at best.
LEADMALE:And you know why i know that, david? Because i am an expert on what is mediocre.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
SUPFEMALE:You hate me now, don't you, david? Admit it.
SUPMALE:You're feeling hate.
LEADFEMALE:You hate me right now, don't you? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, i don't.
SUPMALE:You're a paying customer and i respect and admire you.
SUPFEMALE:Liar! Break, damn you, break.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to me, david.
OTHERFEMALE:Rabbits and geese and goats are not people.
LEADFEMALE:They don't sing and dance.
LEADFEMALE:They're food! no! There, there.
LEADMALE:Welcome home, son.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Two.
LEADMALE:Th three.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Choppers, radar? Okay, good, it's quiet.
LEADFEMALE:I've been driving andy around in the car.
LEADFEMALE:It took me 45 minutes to finally get him to nap.
LEADMALE:The motion of the car lulls him to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we used to go for drives when our kids couldn't sleep too.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, we never wrecked it by bringing them with us.
LEADFEMALE:Just trying to make your babysitting job a little easier, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, a couple things.
LEADMALE:Oh great, the list.
SUPFEMALE:At least i'll have something to look at while i'm on hold with the poison control center.
LEADFEMALE:You can see i've divided things into three categories: food, sleep and recreation.
LEADMALE:Jackie, food and sleep are recreation.
LEADMALE:Okay, first under "food," andy is not allowed to have cheese, preservatives, fat or sugar.
LEADMALE:I wasn't planning on cooking for the kid.
LEADMALE:So i've got celery sticks, carrot sticks and rice cakes, and if you just stick to this diet, then he's not gonna fuss.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't need all this fiber, jackie.
LEADMALE:He's barely got a colon.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye, sweetie.
LEADMALE:I'd better go.
LEADMALE:If he wakes up early, you wanna get him back to sleep, then you can either say, "moomie wuvs boo-boo" or you say, "boo-boo, tickie tickie tickie.
SUPMALE:" well, she's gone.
LEADMALE:You can quit faking it.
SUPFEMALE:I thought so.
SUPMALE:Tickie tickie, that's all you're getting, kid.
LEADFEMALE:Here, i know what you want.
LEADMALE:No no no.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it doesn't say anything about fondue.
LEADMALE:Hi hi, "tout la monde.
LEADMALE:" especially you, snickle fritz.
LEADFEMALE:I purchased some glorious fabric for the nursery windows.
OTHERFEMALE:It took me all morning.
LEADMALE:Goodness, i'm practically winded.
SUPMALE:You just can't get good quality fabric since the war.
LEADMALE:Well, i guess for me, it's curtains.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's kind of like living near the airport.
LEADMALE:After a while, you just don't hear it anymore.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeez, deej, whatever it is you got in your jacket, i hope it's not that virus-infected monkey the whole town's been looking for.
LEADFEMALE:Leave me alone.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, what's under there, huh? mom doesn't have you defrosting a roast again, does she? I'm not gonna show you what it is.
LEADMALE:You're just gonna make fun of me.
SUPMALE:Son, they're already making fun of you.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's your pictures from photography club.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:We're all in here.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, we were supposed to capture the true essence of our subjects.
SUPMALE:Hey, what's this one? That's darlene's fist.
SUPFEMALE:Oh yeah, you can see the scabs where the knuckles have dragged on the ground.
LEADMALE:Jeez, d.j. , it's really rude to take a picture of someone's butt.
SUPMALE:Oh, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:That's becky's face.
SUPFEMALE:Here's a good shot of you, mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, sitting in your chair in front of the tv with a cold beer in your hand.
OTHERFEMALE:No empties on the floor must have just started.
LEADMALE:Hey, roseanne, come on in and look at d.j. 's photo album.
SUPFEMALE:It's really good.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne: bring it in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:No, you come in here.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, dan, just this once do it my way.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, i had a long shift today.
LEADFEMALE:I'm pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tired.
SUPFEMALE:Do you really want me to come in there? Good thing i needed another beer.
LEADFEMALE:Here, check it out.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i've always wanted pictures of the family.
LEADMALE:Hand me a pen there.
SUPFEMALE:Mustache time.
LEADMALE:There i am.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty nice shot, huh? You're just kind of sitting like a lump in your chair with a beer.
SUPMALE:Yep.
OTHERFEMALE:Just like in the high-school yearbook.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see what other action poses he's got me in.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it looks like that's it.
SUPMALE:Guess you haven't given him much opportunity for a photo shoot ever since your synchronized-swimming group broke up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure there must be some others.
SUPFEMALE:He was supposed to capture the essence of his subject.
LEADMALE:Well, now here you are in your chair with a beer.
OTHERMALE:I think that about covers it.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:Is this all he thinks of me? He's got two pictures of the mailman in here.
LEADMALE:Well yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the mailman has two sides, you know? Here he is delivering the mail and then here he is picking up the mail.
LEADFEMALE:It's not funny.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. thinks i'm a lump.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then do something about it.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? do i have to put on a harry chapin album for you, dan? Spend time with him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, maybe.
SUPMALE:Couldn't hurt to spend some time with the boy, show him i'm every bit as complex as the mailman.
SUPMALE:D.j. , get in here.
LEADFEMALE:What boy wouldn't want to learn what his dad's all about? I don't know-little skippy hitler.
LEADFEMALE:Buddy, you and i are gonna have some fun.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! How many of those has he had? guess what? We're spending the afternoon together.
OTHERMALE:Why, what did i do wrong? what are you guys up to? We're gonna throw the old ball around a little bit.
LEADMALE:Thought i'd show d.j. what made the old man third team all-state.
LEADMALE:Help me.
LEADMALE:Yeah, so grab the ball there, bottom shelf.
LEADMALE:I'll show you how to throw a perfect spiral.
LEADMALE:And you're ready to go.
LEADFEMALE:Are we through? No, we're going to the store.
LEADMALE:We're gonna buy a ball.
SUPMALE:Do we have to? Yes, it'll be fun.
LEADMALE:But i don't want to go-get in the car! All right, just don't hit me again.
LEADFEMALE:How's my little andy? how's my babe? have you been goody good? Yes, all except for that one little incident with the matchy matches.
LEADMALE:Oh, baby.
SUPFEMALE:My god.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey-roseanne my child has oreo breath.
LEADMALE:Well, relax.
OTHERMALE:That's just 'cause we were drinking an oreo-flavored liqueur.
SUPFEMALE:You gave him oreos? roseanne, what about my list? I specifically asked you not to feed him any junk food.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you could spit and you could swear and you can even take the lord's name in vain, but you will not come in my house and refer to oreos as junk food.
SUPMALE:I am serious, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:How would you feel if you left instructions for the care of your child, and somebody just ignored 'em? If i had never raised a kid, and i left him with somebody who had raised three, i'd feel pretty damn good about it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, somehow i don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, you're getting him back alive, and that wasn't even on your list.
SUPFEMALE:I don't care about andy being alive.
SUPFEMALE:Calm down, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:I used to do stuff like that and give my kids cookies all the time.
OTHERMALE:Maybe that's the reason your kids turned out the way they did.
LEADMALE:What the hell's wrong with my kids? Nothing if you're trying to reverse the process of evolution.
LEADMALE:If that's the way you feel about it, maybe you shouldn't bring your kid around here anymore.
LEADMALE:Maybe that is fine with me.
LEADMALE:Maybe i don't want my kid turning out the way yours did-like smart-ass high-school-dropout trailer-trash dark-clothes-wearing boyfriendsin-the-basement too-soon-sex-doing four-letter-wording hoodlum oreo eaters.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what you are, the whole family.
LEADMALE:The whole lot of you, oreo eaters.
LEADMALE:And you-you are the oreo-iest.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, guys.
OTHERMALE:How's it going? Hey, thanks for the ride.
SUPFEMALE:How are things at home? I'll pick you up at 7:00.
LEADFEMALE:How's mom doing? Is she okay? 'cause, you know, i was just wondering.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, 7:00's great.
SUPMALE:Maybe we can catch a movie.
SUPMALE:Okay okay, i see your point.
LEADMALE:I see exactly what's going on here.
SUPMALE:Okay, what's going on here? We heard what you said to mom about us yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, god.
SUPFEMALE:I've got this voice that carries.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with andy turning out like us? come on, guys, you gotta know i didn't mean that, right? guys! Look, you really hurt us, okay? I didn't mean to hurt you.
LEADMALE:I meant to hurt your mom.
SUPMALE:But you've taken something really beautiful like hurting our mom and turned it into something ugly.
SUPMALE:Good one, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:So i can see that you're not really that upset with me 'cause you're still joking with me, right? Actually, i'm still a little upset.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i don't know how i'm gonna be at waiting on customers.
LEADMALE:Becky, you say no more because i'm gonna take over your shift.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you two get on out of here and go have some fun.
LEADMALE:I was kind of counting on that money.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, you can have my tips.
LEADMALE:Well, gee, i mean, that'll make becky feel better, i guess.
SUPMALE:It's $26.
SUPMALE:It's all i got.
SUPFEMALE:Cool, bye.
LEADMALE:See ya.
LEADMALE:Okay okay.
LEADMALE:I love you guys.
SUPFEMALE:I love you two.
SUPMALE:Oh my god, i hope andy doesn't turn out like them.
LEADFEMALE:This is where it all happens, d.j. this is the hub of the lanford transportation department.
LEADMALE:If you see me sitting in that chair at home, it's because i've spent a long day here working diligently.
SUPMALE:Hey, that lady on that calendar's naked.
SUPFEMALE:Well can't blame her, d.j. august is the hottest month.
OTHERMALE:D.j. , where'd you get the shiner? Dad threw a ball at me.
LEADFEMALE:To you, to you.
LEADMALE:Hey, how about it, deej? why don't you climb up in an official city vehicle? Dad, i ride in one of these every day.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
SUPMALE:Where do you go? Hey, i bet you've never seen this part of the bus.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, this stuff is huge.
OTHERMALE:You fix this? Better yet, i'm the supervisor.
SUPMALE:I got seven guys under me, and they better do what i say or else.
LEADMALE:I'll write 'em up and 18 infractions later, there'll be a hearing.
OTHERFEMALE:So you just sit in a chair and watch guys fix stuff? Well yeah, the way a king sits on his throne and watches his knights fix stuff.
LEADMALE:Mark, what are you doing? I'm making a sugar trail for the ants, and they're going for it, the stupid bastards.
SUPFEMALE:That's like 50 feet of ants.
LEADFEMALE:Can i try? mark, don't you have something better to do? I guess i could go shoot staples into a spider web.
LEADMALE:I'm coming with.
OTHERMALE:Hold on, boy, you're here with me.
OTHERMALE:And you haven't seen how we get around those e.
SUPFEMALE:P.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:Rules on the disposal of toxic materials.
LEADFEMALE:Do i have to? Yeah, come on, it'll be great.
LEADFEMALE:Go on outside.
SUPMALE:The water out there has all the colors of the rainbow.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna go back to school.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want a root beer? how about a root beer? Yeah, i guess.
LEADFEMALE:Heads up.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! That was your good eye, wasn't it? And i also found the most delightful wallpaper for the nursery.
LEADMALE:No, mom, you always do this.
LEADMALE:We only wanted you to do the curtains.
LEADFEMALE:Piff-bibble.
SUPMALE:I couldn't help myself.
LEADFEMALE:I just fell in love with these jolly jolly clowns.
SUPMALE:They're so antic, like they just came tumbling out of a little tiny car.
LEADMALE:It's something the baby can remember me by.
LEADFEMALE:She'll remember you every saturday when the whole family goes dancing on your grave.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't bother me, dear.
LEADFEMALE:I know those are just your pregnancy hormones talking.
SUPMALE:My hormones actually wanna kill you, mom.
LEADMALE:And they're out in the front yard right now looking for a big stick.
SUPFEMALE:Water off a duck's back.
LEADMALE:Quack quack quack.
LEADMALE:The coast clear? is she gone? when did you come in? About 40 minutes ago.
SUPFEMALE:I was just waiting till mom left.
LEADMALE:Well, if you're looking for my kids, the girls are turning tricks at the trailer court.
LEADFEMALE:And d.j. 's out back skinning rabbits.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, wait, i came over here to apologize.
SUPFEMALE:I was way over the line about your kids.
LEADFEMALE:I think they're terrific, and i also think that you're a really good mom.
OTHERMALE:Really? Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe my kids are a little screwed up.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, i'll admit that.
LEADMALE:But if they are, it's all dan's fault, you know? did you know he hit d.j. with a ball? So i just wanted you to know that i was sorry.
LEADMALE:Yeah well, i'm sorry too.
SUPFEMALE:I really should have followed your list.
LEADMALE:Thanks for saying that, roseanne.
LEADMALE:See, that makes me feel so much better.
OTHERFEMALE:It's like you respect my mothering.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i mean, he's your kid.
LEADFEMALE:If you tell me to put him in a pink dress and tap shoes, i should do it.
LEADMALE:Well, no, i mean, that would be a silly thing.
SUPFEMALE:The things on my list aren't silly.
SUPMALE:Those are serious parenting issues that i've researched and feel strongly about.
LEADMALE:Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:If it's on the list, i oughta do it.
LEADMALE:No, 'cause there's this odd tone in your voice there that seems to be belittling the list, like there's something keeps getting caught in your throat that is most likely holding back laughter inside the rest of you.
OTHERMALE:No, that's not laughter back there, jackie.
OTHERMALE:That's a little piece of oreo.
LEADFEMALE:I was right about the oreo.
OTHERMALE:No, you weren't.
OTHERMALE:You are totally totally going overboard about this.
OTHERMALE:It's one crummy cookie and i already had ate the middle out of it.
SUPMALE:Oh! It is symptomatic of something more serious, roseanne.
SUPMALE:You substitute cookies and candy and junk for love.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADMALE:You do.
LEADMALE:I am willing to admit i have got a lot to learn about being a mother, but so do you.
SUPMALE:I had a lot to learn.
LEADMALE:And i learned it and now i'm done.
LEADMALE:That is such a ha! That's what that is.
LEADFEMALE:A "ha!" jackie, stop it.
LEADMALE:Stop this instant.
SUPMALE:Stay out of it, old woman.
OTHERFEMALE:I will not have you upsetting roseanne when she's in this fragile state.
SUPFEMALE:You tell her, mom, and she keeps looking at me too.
LEADFEMALE:Just get out of here, jackie, with all your hatred and anger.
LEADMALE:Shoo! shoo! don't touch me, mom! Accidents happen.
LEADMALE:I can't understand why she's doing that.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you just get all comfy, and mother will make it all better.
SUPMALE:She's not one of us, mom.
LEADFEMALE:She never was.
LEADMALE:Are we done, or is there a bag of nails you'd like to show me? No, son, you're free.
LEADMALE:Go run with the ants.
LEADMALE:He hates me.
LEADMALE:I couldn't be duller.
SUPFEMALE:You could golf.
LEADFEMALE:Going to the garage was a huge disaster.
LEADMALE:So i tried taking him to other places that might capture my essence-the bowling alley, the lobo.
OTHERFEMALE:I even took him to the quarry where i used to go swimming.
LEADMALE:You never used to swim at the quarry.
SUPMALE:At that point i was making stuff up.
LEADMALE:It's a lost cause.
OTHERMALE:I'm giving up.
LEADMALE:I'm just gonna relax and grab a beer mother: ding ding ding.
SUPFEMALE:It's the good-humor woman.
LEADFEMALE:In canada.
SUPMALE:Ice cream, yay! I have to admit it.
SUPFEMALE:I kinda like it when you and jackie have a tiff.
LEADFEMALE:It gives me a chance to do some mothering of my own.
SUPMALE:I almost forgot-a crumbled cookie on top.
LEADFEMALE:When you were a little girl, this would always comfort you when you were upset.
LEADFEMALE:So tell me, mom did you ever try any other ways to comfort me? You know how it is with kids.
LEADFEMALE:When you find something that works, you stick with it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so why try anything else? right, mom? If i'm cooking dinner, i'd better go to the store.
SUPFEMALE:Ta-ta.
OTHERMALE:Hello, jackie, i know you're not home yet.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted to say i'm sorry about the oreo stuff.
LEADMALE:I was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i'm not a perfect mother.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i still have a whole bunch of stuff to learn.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:So your eye still hurt? No, not all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Just when i look at stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess i'll go outside and clean the shovels.
LEADMALE:A man's nothing without clean shovels.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, not pepe le pew.
LEADMALE:Hey, come on, son.
LEADFEMALE:Don't knock pepe le pew.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted road runner.
SUPMALE:I can understand that.
SUPFEMALE:The road runner's done some fine work, but he's more for the masses.
SUPFEMALE:Le pew, on the other hand, demands more from his audience.
LEADMALE:Really? Oh, absolutely.
SUPMALE:For instance, the discerning viewer will always ask himself, "how will the black cat get the white stripe down her back this time?" hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't just watch, think.
LEADFEMALE:Something's gonna scare her and part of her fur's gonna turn white.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah-ah-ah, you failed to notice those workmen painting that stripe down the middle of the street.
SUPFEMALE:You're good, dad.
SUPMALE:But of course.
LEADMALE:Aren't you gonna sit down? Well yeah, maybe for a couple cartoons, but if that news comes on, i'm out of here.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:What a great way to end an incredible week.
LEADMALE:The movie was terrific.
SUPMALE:That was the longest you've ever let me use the armrest.
LEADFEMALE:You did eat some of my milk duds.
LEADMALE:Oh, i love this time of day.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it's pretty.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you can say what you want about the sulfides from the paper mill, but it sure makes for a beautiful sunset.
SUPMALE:Have i thanked you enough for helping me get that job in chicago? Yes, david.
SUPFEMALE:And we got a great apartment, right? I'm so psyched to see it.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're going to love your room.
LEADFEMALE:Except i'm going to have to get in there every morning to brush my teeth.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's so much to think about.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, should we each buy our own food? should we split the utilities? should we have separate phone lines? You know, um or we could just get married.
LEADMALE:Yeah right.
LEADMALE:To who? No, i mean, come on.
LEADMALE:There's a lot advantages to being married, right? Oh, i get it.
LEADFEMALE:You mean so we can get all the gifts and money from our friends.
LEADFEMALE:Our friends? The only thing we'd get from them is beer and mono.
SUPMALE:David.
SUPFEMALE:You're serious about this, aren't you? Yeah, i am.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh my god.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Ha ha, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Now you're going to tell me you're kidding, right? Nope, now i'm gonna tell you i'm pregnant.
LEADMALE:Pregnant? you mean, like pregnant? Yes, david.
SUPFEMALE:You've knocked me up.
OTHERMALE:How? when? when? Disneyworld.
SUPFEMALE:Oh my god.
LEADFEMALE:You mean that night after the fireworks? Well, either that or it truly is a magic kingdom.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:What are we gonna do? Oh, don't worry.
LEADMALE:You know, getting married and having a baby can't change things that much.
SUPMALE:I kind of wanted a dog first.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it'll be okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm still gonna finish school and by getting married i can get on your health coverage.
LEADMALE:Our car insurance will go down.
LEADMALE:We'll be in line for married-student housing.
SUPMALE:I mean, it just makes sense, you know? It wouldn't have to be a big dog.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go tell everybody inside and get this over with.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa whoa, slow down.
LEADFEMALE:You mean tell everyone in there? darlene, couldn't we wait a few months? I mean, then they would just think you were getting fat.
LEADMALE:They gotta be expecting that.
LEADFEMALE:So then when we do tell them, they'll just go, "oh good, she's not getting fat.
OTHERMALE:" all right, we don't have to tell them yet.
LEADFEMALE:Now take a deep breath and try not to look so pasty.
SUPMALE:We'll just-we'll tell them the movie we just saw affected me profoundly.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, let's go inside.
SUPMALE:You ready? After you daddy.
LEADMALE:What the hell are those? They're cornish game hens.
SUPFEMALE:I bought them off this guy that was selling them off the back of his truck down at the gas station parking lot.
LEADFEMALE:It's the very same guy that i bought our stereo speakers from last week.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you guys are just in time for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Grab a plate.
LEADMALE:Sit down here, david.
LEADFEMALE:Next to you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Come tell me about your new job as a graphic artist there.
LEADMALE:David, congratulations on the job.
SUPMALE:Is it on computer or do you just draw by hand? Uh, thanks, i'm fine.
SUPMALE:I guess you're pretty excited about moving to chicago, huh? Uh, uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Of course, that means i'll have to move to chicago.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, i'm confused.
SUPMALE:They're some kind of tiny chicken.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't know what they were either.
OTHERMALE:No, i don't think that's it, d.j. david's just a little excited about his new job.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that right, david? The movie affected me profoundly.
LEADMALE:David, why don't you let me sit there? You've been hogging mom long enough.
LEADFEMALE:Okay good, here.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, but you should sit somewhere, you know? what's up? I smell fear.
LEADMALE:I love that smell, but what's up? Nothing's up.
LEADMALE:God.
LEADMALE:Hey d.j. , that's a great shirt.
OTHERMALE:Where'd you get it? My closet.
LEADMALE:Oh, now i think something is up.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i've seen enough of that "murder she wrote" to figure that out.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see here.
SUPMALE:David is pale and kind of weak-kneed and all nervous, so there's no clues there.
LEADFEMALE:But darlene wants to sit next to me and she said something nice to her brother.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, i wonder.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:You're pregnant! that was my joke guess! We're also getting married.
SUPFEMALE:Well i'm-i'm-i'm excited for you guys.
LEADMALE:I think it's great.
LEADMALE:Dan! We're gonna be grandparents.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that great? i'm getting one of those sweatshirts that says "world's greatest grandma" on it, you know? And you can go out and get yourself, i don't know, like a cane or something.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Good good good good good.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Really wasn't the reaction i was expecting.
SUPMALE:Yeah, me neither.
LEADMALE:Guess you peed your pants for nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Dan? dan! What? Oh, i'm just trying to figure out how to go about eating this thing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i think it's good that darlene is getting pregnant, 'cause-getting married 'cause she-she's pregnant.
LEADMALE:And that's just what i did.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. , stop staring at me.
LEADMALE:Babies having babies.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm nauseous.
LEADFEMALE:I was wondering when that would hit me.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is wrong with you? what do you mean? roseanne, darlene says that she has to get married because she's pregnant and all you can say is that you're happy? are you insane? Jackie, d.j. maybe it would be best if you left now.
SUPMALE:Okey-doke.
OTHERMALE:What about my little chicken? He's gonna get cold.
LEADMALE:We're eating them in the car.
LEADFEMALE:What are you going to say to me, dan? Well, the only reason i didn't start yelling is 'cause i was waiting for you and you didn't start yelling.
LEADFEMALE:And it's too late now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's 'cause it's happened and there is nothing we can do about it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so what? let's be happy? why not? Our daughter's throwing her life away.
OTHERFEMALE:Well no, actually, i think we're making a little progress in this family.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky got married when she was 17.
SUPMALE:I was only 18.
SUPFEMALE:At last, a conner woman is mature enough to put it off until she's 19 years old.
LEADMALE:No way are they ready to have a baby.
SUPFEMALE:No way.
SUPMALE:Well, i don't know.
LEADMALE:I can't think of a better mother for a child than david.
SUPMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:You're not even shocked by this.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what is it with this family? Nothing could ever be easy.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing ever goes the way it's supposed to.
LEADFEMALE:I think you'd better just calm down.
SUPFEMALE:No, why should i calm down, damn it? Because we can be angry and that will have no effect whatsoever, or we can be happy and that will have no effect whatsoever either.
LEADFEMALE:So why don't we just be parents and support them? Well, there goes $5 worth of fancy hens down the drain.
LEADMALE:Tv announcer: you're pretty mad at me, aren't you? Nope.
SUPMALE:Well, you're chewing like you're mad.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:I'll try to chew happier.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner, i know this whole me-and-darlene thing is very very weird, especially after all you've been through with mark and becky, but-but you want it to be different.
SUPMALE:Fine, okay, whatever.
LEADMALE:So how mad are you? I'm pretty damn mad.
LEADMALE:From now on, people are eating straight out of the pan.
SUPFEMALE:So you're okay about this whole me-and-darlene thing? I mean, i know you said you were, but so did mr.
OTHERMALE:Conner and he's obviously not.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, pretty weird, huh? Ever since i had that baby, i don't know, things don't bother me as much.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just happier.
SUPMALE:You're a lucky lucky boy, david.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'll tell you how to handle mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:You just stay on his right side.
LEADFEMALE:That's his blind spot.
LEADFEMALE:So how are you doing, david? Okay i guess.
SUPMALE:It's kind of interesting having all of your major life changes happen in one day.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i think i can pretty much relate to that.
SUPFEMALE:I remember this one tuesday, they canceled "card sharks" and they introduced the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream the very same day.
SUPMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:You worried about the baby? Actually, i'm more worried about me and darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Something's just-i don't know.
SUPMALE:When she asked me to marry her-oh, she asked you? That's cute.
SUPMALE:No, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, it wasn't cute.
SUPFEMALE:I felt like she was proposing some sort of business deal or something.
LEADFEMALE:It had nothing to do with love.
LEADMALE:Well, then i'm impressed.
LEADMALE:That means darlene knows what marriage is really all about.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, david, come on.
SUPMALE:You know she loves you.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's just that i pictured it different.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i thought i would tell darlene i had a big surprise for her and we would hop in the car and drive down to that underpass near route 10 where we first-i'm just-i'm not sure that this is how we should be starting a marriage.
LEADMALE:Oh, david.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is-granted, it's a lot to handle, you know, all at once.
LEADFEMALE:But i'm sure darlene has got a lot of things going through her mind too.
SUPFEMALE:And you guys are gonna work it all out.
SUPMALE:Everything will be okay, david.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, how are you doing? pregnant, how about you? you wanting something to eat? can i make you a peanut butter and frito sandwich? That's okay, mom.
SUPMALE:I'm not really craving weird pregnancy food yet.
LEADFEMALE:No, i was making it for me.
LEADFEMALE:You want one? Sure.
LEADMALE:Here, have this one.
SUPMALE:You're staring.
OTHERFEMALE:It's so bizarre that you're going to be a mother.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah well, it won't be official until i chew through the cord.
LEADMALE:You aren't gonna believe the stuff it's gonna do to your body.
SUPMALE:Of course, you know, i'm gonna be there beside you the whole time laughing and pointing.
OTHERMALE:No, but you really are not gonna believe the way everything's gonna change, you know? The way stuff smells, even the way it tastes.
SUPFEMALE:Like, when i was pregnant with becky i had a craving to eat dirt.
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
LEADFEMALE:Then when i was pregnant with you i couldn't get enough of your dad's smell-that intoxicating blend of motor oil, aqua velva, and corn nuts.
SUPFEMALE:Way too much detail.
SUPFEMALE:So i'm assuming that you have considered all the options open to you, you know, having to do with the pregnancy and everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i know the options.
SUPFEMALE:And? And i want the baby.
SUPFEMALE:I want it more than i've ever wanted anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that so hard to believe? Well yeah, a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i remember when you were eight and you wanted to get a vasectomy.
LEADFEMALE:And then even after we told you what it was you still wanted one.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well i'm not eight anymore and i want the baby.
LEADFEMALE:So let's just drop it, okay? Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:You're having a baby and you're getting married.
SUPMALE:Cool.
SUPMALE:I'm not gonna say another thing about it.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have any idea what a mega amount of crap that's gonna be to deal with, darlene? are you ready for that? mom, why are you doing this to me? i mean, do you think there's a single thing that you could say that i haven't thought about, like, 1000 times? Well, you know, you'll have to excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:I might be in a little bit of shock here.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I know everybody is looking at me and thinking, like, "oh, darlene's getting married? Darlene's gonna have a baby?" i mean, hell, even i said it.
LEADFEMALE:But you know, when i found out that there was, like, this life going through me i don't know, i just feel, like different.
SUPMALE:Happier.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, i know all about that euphoria thing.
LEADFEMALE:I've had four children.
LEADMALE:I felt that three times.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i mean, remember when i was in high school and i had that, like, dark depressed funk that i was in? By the way, sorry about that.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, it's just, like, life is not as hard as i made it out to be.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well having a baby is really hard under the very best of circumstances, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You've got a really tough road ahead of you.
LEADMALE:I know that.
SUPFEMALE:And that's why i'm preparing for it now.
OTHERMALE:With summer school i can still graduate on time.
LEADMALE:And david's got a full-time job, so the baby will be covered on his insurance.
OTHERMALE:And i just put in for a copywriting job that i can do part-time at home.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADMALE:Sounds like you're more prepared than i ever was.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and to be honest, i couldn't do any of this if we weren't getting married.
LEADMALE:And there's a lot of benefits that come with that.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, you know, i love david, so it's not like there's-whoa whoa whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you know, that last little part there about you love david, you know? You'd better go find him and tell him that.
SUPMALE:David knows that i love him.
SUPMALE:No, darlene, i was talking to him and he really needs to hear that, okay? Okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, i want you to know something else too.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i am you know, totally happy for you.
SUPFEMALE:And i'm gonna be here for you.
SUPFEMALE:Do not start to cry.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i mean, it is pretty cool to see my little baby a grown-up and responsible woman.
SUPMALE:So go find your fiance.
OTHERFEMALE:Whew.
LEADFEMALE:So i figure it was on the tram somewhere between the dumbo ride and the alien encounter.
SUPFEMALE:Not funny, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Our daughter got pregnant at disneyworld.
LEADMALE:When else do you get the chance to put that in your christmas newsletter? You know, i always figured that darlene was gonna make it, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:You know? I thought darlene was gonna be the one.
LEADFEMALE:It's her last year of college-all these big job offers and now this.
SUPFEMALE:She's still gonna make it, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:She'll just have big bags under her eyes and cheerios in her hair.
LEADMALE:It's not what she planned, honey.
LEADFEMALE:It's not what she wanted.
LEADMALE:It's not what i wanted for her.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well i was out there talking to her, you know? And she, like, totally blew my mind, dan.
SUPMALE:She's thought it all through.
LEADFEMALE:She's got it all planned out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i know, but they're not ready to have kids.
SUPFEMALE:Couldn't they have waited until they had some more money? until they had any money? Well, if we would have waited until we had money, we never would have had any kids.
LEADFEMALE:And then who would we have sent to the store to buy our cigarettes? Yeah, we also never would have had a daughter who derailed her life because she did something stupid.
LEADMALE:She's not stupid, dan.
LEADMALE:She's human and we finally have some proof of that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, stop it, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Our daughter is pregnant and is getting married.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't sit back and do nothing about it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, why don't you start screaming and throwing furniture around like you did when becky eloped? And then we won't see her for a year and a half too.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well she's gonna make it, dan.
SUPMALE:She's fine.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna be there.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna help her through it.
OTHERMALE:We're all gonna make it.
LEADFEMALE:We are good parents, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Check this out.
SUPFEMALE:Not only-not only are we gonna have a grandchild who is roughly the same age as our own child, but our daughter is marrying the boy we consider to be our son.
OTHERMALE:I think that means that we are now officially the whitetrashiest family in all the land! Yee-haw!
OTHERMALE:Ahem.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, what is this piece of meat doing on the floor back there? I don't know.
LEADMALE:It was on the floor out here.
LEADMALE:Somebody must have kicked it back there.
LEADMALE:Okay, so who kicked the meat? roseanne, you know who that is? That's cindy kenner from "wake up chicago.
LEADMALE:" she's on every morning at 6:00 a.
LEADMALE:M.
SUPMALE:Well, i never see it 'cause i never stay up that late anymore.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Are you the manager? No, actually, i am the owner.
SUPFEMALE:Well, actually, he's one of four owners that own this place equally.
LEADMALE:I'm roseanne conner, the main owner.
SUPMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:I'm joe matthews, producer of "wake up chicago.
OTHERFEMALE:" listen, if you don't mind, we're here to do some manon-the-street interviews.
LEADMALE:Would that be all right? Of course that's all right.
SUPFEMALE:You just make yourself right at home-hi.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie harris, owner number three.
OTHERMALE:It's just very nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you too.
SUPFEMALE:All right, let's get started then, huh? He is very good-looking, and i did not see a ring.
LEADFEMALE:Careful, jackie, he might spot your dorsal fin moving through the water.
LEADMALE:This is so great.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna get all this free advertising.
LEADFEMALE:More customers mean more work.
LEADFEMALE:I think we should think about this.
LEADMALE:Okay, our reporter cindy kenner will ask the questions.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, i'm cindy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, i'm roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Say, could i possibly get a little bit of pellegrino? You could if i knew what the hell that was.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, i forgot where i was.
LEADFEMALE:You were in between asking me for a drink and getting punched in the face.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Let's start with him here and then her, and then her.
LEADMALE:Okay, here we go, ready.
SUPFEMALE:In three, two, one.
SUPFEMALE:Today we've come to the little town of lanford to ask some local restaurant people the question that's on everyone's lips this election year.
SUPMALE:Is beef back? does she have to think of all these questions every single day? When does she find the time to not eat? "is beef back?" here at the lunch box located on route 9 just half a mile south of hanging bat caverns we serve beef to our customers.
OTHERFEMALE:So beef is good.
LEADMALE:And remember, leon recommends lean.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:So is beef back? well, i'm going to have to agree with leon that low fat is the way to go, but today there are leaner cuts of beef, so who knows? Maybe someday, beef won't have any fat at all.
LEADFEMALE:Because the future is now and who knows what that's going to bring? Maybe we won't even have beef or cows or cars, or we just will wear those jetpack things.
LEADMALE:We'll just fly all over wherever we want to go.
OTHERMALE:And we'll eat food made out of, i don't know, just old newspapers and air.
LEADMALE:Oh, to be young again.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, andy.
OTHERFEMALE:Mommy's on tv.
LEADMALE:Hi, is beef back? Well, i just wanna say that the only thing i don't like about fat is that it doesn't have any sugar in it.
LEADMALE:Okay, but doesn't a fatty diet-i mean, won't it make you fat? so? A lot of people are fat, you know.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, i think more american women look like me than like you, you know? Yeah, but when you watch tv, there's no fat people on or anything.
LEADMALE:When i watch that show "friends" that has all those whiny girls that are nothing but hair and bones, you know? And i watch them and they're drinking those triple espressos and stuff, and i'm just like, "hey, go for the muffins.
SUPMALE:" it kind of bugs me, you know, because, i feel like, "hey, i eat the same amount of food that they eat.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't puke when i'm done.
SUPMALE:" i must say planning a wedding for you and darlene is such a thrill.
OTHERMALE:Of course, my wedding gown is gonna have to be let out a bit to accommodate her little bun in the oven.
LEADFEMALE:Plus, i'm attaching styrofoam doves to the shoulder pads to draw the eye away from her waistline.
OTHERMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Harris-don't worry, i haven't forgotten about you.
LEADFEMALE:I've already called veils and tails.
LEADFEMALE:They have plenty of tuxes in your size.
LEADMALE:Why, they fit boys as young as four years old.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's very nice, but-but what? We need music.
LEADMALE:Do you have any ideas? Only scads.
LEADMALE:Oh, darlene, there you are.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you've missed all the wedding planning fun, but david will catch you up.
LEADMALE:Now i'll make myself disappear so you two lovebirds can coo.
LEADMALE:Poof! Well, i hope whatever she's on becomes over-the-counter in our lifetime.
LEADMALE:Now what the hell is going on in here? Your grandmother has lots of ideas for our wedding.
LEADMALE:And you're saying okay to them? She's just trying to be nice.
SUPMALE:David, that's just her cover.
SUPMALE:God, and you think you're gonna be a conner? No, i thought you were gonna be a healy.
SUPMALE:Oh, we'll get to that later.
SUPFEMALE:Tell her no.
SUPMALE:What? All these wedding plans she's roped you into, you've gotta tell her no.
LEADMALE:I can't just say no.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, can you say, "ow, quit it, darlene"? Okay, fine.
SUPMALE:How do i do it? Well, you've gotta be tough.
LEADMALE:You've gotta stay firm.
LEADMALE:She's a really crafty manipulator.
SUPFEMALE:Here, practice saying no to me.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go get mom to coach you.
SUPFEMALE:No! Very good.
LEADMALE:"go for the muffins," you know.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i figure i eat the same amount of food that they eat.
SUPMALE:I just don't puke when i'm done.
SUPMALE:I'm wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Well, nobody loves roseanne like roseanne, huh? You're just bitter 'cause they cut all your stuff out.
LEADFEMALE:That's not entirely true.
OTHERFEMALE:They did leave in that pithy epigram "beef is good.
LEADMALE:" three more words than i got in.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really proud of you, honey.
SUPFEMALE:You were great this morning.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, doll, and remember me when the ballots come out for the people's choice awards.
LEADFEMALE:You've got it.
OTHERMALE:No, wait, if i vote for that, will i get called for jury duty? Hey, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Hey, what are you doing back here? Hi, joe, you know, normally my hair is a lot higher than this, but even the most perfect hair can't stand up to beef steam.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to see you again, jackie.
SUPMALE:Listen, can i talk to your sister for a sec? huh? Uh, yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:I was just in elgin on a story, another kid in a well, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, i thought i'd drop by and tell you the news.
LEADFEMALE:Kid in a well.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of takes you back, huh, deej? Roseanne, your appearance on the show this morning, it was fantastic.
SUPMALE:I mean, your whole opinionated blue-collar outlook, people just loved it.
LEADMALE:See, dan, all these years everybody thought i was a bitch, but what i had was an opinionated blue-collar outlook.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you like to come on the show next week and be a commentator on "wake up chicago"? Yeah, and i'll give you a handful of these magic beans.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious.
SUPFEMALE:We want you to come on the show and do a one-minute piece commenting on anything you want.
SUPMALE:What do you say? Oh my god.
SUPFEMALE:Oh my-honey, that's incredible.
LEADMALE:Don't forget us when you're famous, mom.
LEADMALE:Who are you? I don't know who he is, but i am the wind beneath your wings.
LEADFEMALE:All right, let's slow down here, people.
SUPMALE:I'll handle this.
LEADMALE:Speaking as roseanne's manager whatever.
SUPMALE:We're gonna have to work out a couple of things here.
SUPFEMALE:That's really-you don't mind if i do that, do you? all right, first of all, what's the pay scale? what size dressing room does she have, and when we walk into that dressing room are we gonna find a fruit basket? Jackie, it's all right.
LEADMALE:She'll be paid very well for this.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh, well, that's all well and good, but i'm not hearing the words "fruit basket.
OTHERMALE:" fruit basket.
OTHERMALE:I think we can make this thing happen.
SUPMALE:I'm real excited about this, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:We'll give you a call with all the details, all right? And then i guess we'll see you in the studio.
LEADMALE:She'll be there, and maybe you and i should get together for a couple of beers and hammer out the details, yeah yeah yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, dot the is, cross the ts.
LEADFEMALE:You call me day or night.
LEADFEMALE:I am very hot on this project.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:I'd better start thinking about what i would even say on there.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i have to decide 'cause a lot of stuff does tick me off, you know, like politicians and big corporations and him.
LEADMALE:Gee, rosie, you really think they're gonna let you go on tv and say anything you want? Dan, dan, dan, don't get involved in things you don't know anything about.
LEADMALE:Yeah, because that's what the guy said.
LEADFEMALE:He said they wanted my opinionated blue-collar outlook, you know? And that's just what they're gonna get too.
LEADMALE:Roseanne uncensored.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dear god, she is already referring to herself in the third person.
LEADMALE:Hey, if she wants to refer to herself in the third person, there's not a damn thing you can do about it.
OTHERFEMALE:She's a star.
SUPMALE:Hi! hi, david! Sorry i'm late.
LEADFEMALE:I had a brainstorm on the way over.
LEADFEMALE:I've decided to drape the pews with battenberg lace to create a hallowed yet whimsical aura of love.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:We don't have to drape it.
SUPFEMALE:We can fan it.
SUPFEMALE:Good for you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i've auditioned a marvelous band for the wedding-dave dunn and his swing cats.
SUPFEMALE:Very peppy.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Harris.
OTHERFEMALE:No to the band.
SUPFEMALE:No to the lace.
LEADFEMALE:No to all of it.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you cute, teasing your-oh, why not say it even though it's two weeks away? --teasing your grandma.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Harris, i am sorry, but darlene and i talked about this and we decided that we are planning the wedding alone without your help.
OTHERMALE:What? I'm serious.
OTHERMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:It's over, the end.
LEADFEMALE:But, david, i didn't get to plan a wedding for either one of my own daughters.
OTHERFEMALE:Becky eloped.
OTHERFEMALE:I probably won't be around for d.j. 's wedding or-or jerry's.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting old, david.
LEADMALE:Darlene was my last chance at a real wedding oh, please, give me a break.
LEADFEMALE:But all my plans, david.
SUPFEMALE:This is so lame.
LEADMALE:Boo-hoo-hoo! oh! You're a horrible boy, horrible.
LEADMALE:Hey, darlene, look who's crying.
SUPFEMALE:David.
SUPMALE:You were right.
SUPMALE:She tried everything, but i stood firm.
LEADFEMALE:She's never cried before.
LEADMALE:God, what did you do to her? You said to be prepared, that she would try every trick in the book.
OTHERFEMALE:I told you to stand firm, not completely crush her dreams.
OTHERMALE:What are you gonna do next, tell her charlton heston is gay? But you-come on, grandma, i'll make you some tea.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:We were talking so pleasantly and all of a sudden, he just attacked me.
SUPFEMALE:As rescue workers continue to sift through the rubble, the tragic death toll stands at seven, but it's expected to climb during the rest of the day.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, don.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, it's kids-are-king day at the lincoln park zoo.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go there for the cutest report you've ever seen.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Easy with the cotton swab.
LEADMALE:My client's skin is her livelihood.
LEADFEMALE:Can you believe it, jackie? This is the same studio where oprah does her show.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, we are on sacred ground.
LEADFEMALE:Who would have ever thought that a little girl that grew up in lanford, illinois, would make it all the way to chicago, illinois? Hey, roseanne, just wanted to let you know that we are all really excited to have you here.
OTHERMALE:Well, thanks.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hitch up your skirt a little.
LEADMALE:Your skeleton's showing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello, i'm rula lenska.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, roseanne, hi.
SUPMALE:Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:How are you doing? You know, i'm just-i like your slacks.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Well, we're almost ready.
LEADMALE:You got any questions, roseanne? yeah, where's the bagels? Come on, i'll walk you to the studio.
OTHERMALE:You're on in a couple minutes.
LEADMALE:"i like your slacks.
LEADFEMALE:" why don't you just pin him up against the table? Oh my god.
LEADMALE:Oh my god, look.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe i'm meeting don samuels.
LEADMALE:I'm glad to meet you too.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome aboard.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you get me a bagel? Oh, no, we have people who bring those to you.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get you one.
OTHERMALE:Three minutes, joe.
LEADMALE:Okay, let's set you up, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Have a seat over here.
LEADFEMALE:Already? 'cause, i mean, we haven't even talked about what i'm gonna say.
LEADMALE:What's to talk about? I read it.
LEADFEMALE:I loved it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you loved it, as is? I mean, okay, you loved it, but i bet all the suits hated it.
OTHERMALE:No, everyone loved it.
SUPFEMALE:Even cindy liked it.
LEADMALE:So we're just-like, just gonna go ahead then, huh? In two and a half minutes.
SUPMALE:Jackie, do you care to watch in the booth with me? in the booth? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Go in a booth? Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:To watch what? Oh, the show.
SUPMALE:Oh, okay, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sure, okay.
SUPMALE:So good luck.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i need a minute with my manager.
SUPFEMALE:What? what do you need? Go pull the car around.
LEADFEMALE:We're getting out of here.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? You're on in two minutes.
LEADMALE:I don't think i can do it.
LEADFEMALE:Sure you can.
LEADFEMALE:You heard what joe said.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody here loves you.
OTHERMALE:They think you're gonna be great.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i know, but that's the problem, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not used to people liking me.
OTHERMALE:I mean, if they thought i sucked or something, i'd be like, "i'll show those bastards," and then i could blow 'em away.
SUPMALE:That's how i am, but everybody thinking-expecting me to be good, i just-i just don't-i just don't think i could deliver.
SUPMALE:But, roseanne, see, i've never seen you lack confidence like this before, and that gets me all weak, and i can't take that now.
SUPFEMALE:You know, not with everything else that's going on.
SUPFEMALE:Fred called the other day, and i was so upset.
LEADFEMALE:Then he called me right back, and i hung up on him.
SUPMALE:This is so not about you.
SUPFEMALE:Well but what are we gonna do? Soon as that chimp puts down the accordion, you are on.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:You're my manager.
SUPFEMALE:Fix it or make me feel better or something.
OTHERMALE:Go get 'em.
SUPMALE:You are fired.
SUPFEMALE:That felt kind of good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, wait wait.
LEADFEMALE:Just think of it this way-you're all scared because everybody thinks you're great and you don't have confidence-stop saying that.
LEADFEMALE:It's the only way i can say it, but look at it this way-everybody out there in tv land is expecting you to fail.
OTHERFEMALE:No, they're not.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, they are.
LEADFEMALE:Look at yourself.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't look like a cindy or diane sawyer or any other woman on tv.
LEADFEMALE:See, as soon as they see you, they are gonna instantly dislike you.
LEADFEMALE:No, they're not.
SUPMALE:Sure, and then the moment you open your mouth, i mean, that voice, god! So that's two strikes against you right in the very first second of the broadcast.
LEADMALE:Two strikes, huh? Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they're-they're, you know-like, "hey.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hey, who is this big-boned, loudmouth banshee that's polluting my living room? Hey, may, get the remote.
SUPMALE:Change it.
LEADMALE:I don't care to what.
LEADFEMALE:Just get this off my screen.
LEADMALE:" you're not just saying that to make me feel better? Roseanne, think about it.
LEADFEMALE:There's two million people out there waiting for you to fail.
LEADMALE:Two million? Plus mom.
LEADMALE:Out of my way, jackie.
SUPMALE:It's time to wake up chicago.
SUPFEMALE:Attagirl! And mess your hair up.
LEADMALE:You show 'em the true roseanne.
LEADMALE:Well, i kind of liked what they did with my hair.
SUPMALE:It looks really good, so you go, girl! Okay, everybody, here we go.
OTHERFEMALE:In five, four, three, two welcome back.
OTHERFEMALE:Now it's time to meet roseanne conner with her special report from the heartland.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne yeah, hello.
LEADMALE:Well, while i've been here in the big city, i noticed that what you guys call daycare, we in small towns, we just call it babysitting.
LEADMALE:I think you take a lot of things that are pretty simple and make 'em way too complicated.
SUPFEMALE:Granted, moving all the holidays to monday was pure genius but now tuesday sucks.
LEADMALE:Hey, don, you wanna know what really gets my goat? no, what? It's those overchilled little pats of butter they give you in restaurants.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, come on, they're just way too hard.
SUPMALE:I prefer whipped butter.
SUPFEMALE:How about you, don? butter? do you think i really want to sit here and talk to you about butter? I-i am a real journalist.
OTHERFEMALE:I was covering the korean war while your father was chasing your mother around the sock hop.
SUPMALE:I've got shrapnel in my knee older than you.
LEADMALE:Butter? Where were you when j.
OTHERFEMALE:F.
LEADFEMALE:K.
LEADMALE:Was shot? I was on that crowded sidewalk in dallas and i felt that hot lead whistle by my ear.
LEADMALE:Butter? I drank shots with edward r.
SUPMALE:Murrow! if i have to listen to one more of your stupid, inane stories, i am going to open a vein! So, whipped it is.
OTHERMALE:Man, there's just so much to do to prepare for this wedding.
LEADMALE:We still have to get flowers, hors d'oeuvres, a church.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe you should ask darlene to do some of it if you weren't so damn whipped.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i think the first order of business-mom, you're only allowed one suggestion per hour.
LEADFEMALE:And your last one counted as two, because it went on for too long.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, some guy just delivered this for you.
SUPMALE:Well, i didn't order that.
SUPFEMALE:Did you give him any money? No.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, put it down there.
LEADMALE:Saw your commentary on tv about how hard it is to find a descent wedding cake.
OTHERFEMALE:Sincerely, albano's bakery, third and main.
LEADFEMALE:Feel free to mention us on your show.
LEADFEMALE:Man, that's just out-and-out bribery.
LEADMALE:It's totally unethical and chocolaty.
OTHERFEMALE:That cake won't last until the wedding.
LEADFEMALE:That cake won't last till dinner.
LEADMALE:So just because you mentioned wedding cakes on television someone sent you a free one? Yeah, and they say tv only adds 10 lbs.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, i can see my next commentary appearing before my eyes-i was wrong about bakeries.
OTHERFEMALE:Albano's on third and main is a great one.
LEADMALE:And i wonder where i can get a descent wedding dress or hors d'oeuvres, or a candy-apple red pump in a size 7 1/2 with a low heel.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:My divorce is final-signed, sealed, delivered.
LEADMALE:I'm alone, legally forever single till death do i part.
LEADMALE:Hey, jackie, a guy in a long robe carrying a big sickle was by here looking for you.
LEADMALE:Go ahead and joke.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not the one facing a life of solitude, or uneven mattress wear.
OTHERFEMALE:Come one, jackie.
OTHERMALE:You'll find someone.
LEADMALE:Who wouldn't want to go out with you? That's easy for you to say, you little frizzy-haired pollyanna.
LEADFEMALE:You talk to me after a year of marriage, after you've taken up smoking just to shave a couple of years off your miserable life.
SUPMALE:I got to go work on this seating chart now.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, make sure you put me between the priest and the florist.
SUPFEMALE:Hey hey, don't count out that priest.
LEADFEMALE:Times have changed.
LEADMALE:Jackie, i have just the tonic.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come with me saturday night to my ballroom dance class? why didn't i think of that? Mom, that's a great idea.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure that the man of my dreams is sitting at home right now clipping on his bow tie and strapping on his truss.
LEADFEMALE:It's not just for seniors.
LEADFEMALE:There's plenty of cultured and delightful gentlemen of all ages there.
OTHERFEMALE:I may be desperate, but i haven't sunk that low.
LEADFEMALE:Oh really? Hey, i cannot believe that i am agreeing with mom here.
LEADFEMALE:You really should go.
LEADMALE:I was reading this big article about how ballroom dancing is making a big old comeback.
LEADFEMALE:So you really don't think it would be a huge waste of time? No more than your marriage.
SUPFEMALE:All right, i'll go.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna feel really stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, goody! And i'll help you pick out an outfit.
OTHERFEMALE:Plus perhaps we can tease that hair into something presentable.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you try to tease it into a nice set of boobs? Roseanne, you might like to come along too.
SUPMALE:Dance is good exercise.
SUPMALE:Hey, i am not divorced, single, desperate, or lonely.
OTHERMALE:What the hell do i need to exercise for? Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Mark, what happened to your hand? He was working the saw and he almost cut it off again.
LEADMALE:Mark, what an idiot.
LEADMALE:What do you mean an idiot? didn't you hear him? Almost.
LEADMALE:Unbelievable.
LEADMALE:Shouldn't you be sewing up your wedding dress, mary? is he the dumbest guy you've ever known? I work at a construction business, david.
OTHERMALE:I would have to see a list.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, do you know anything about wedding tuxes? i mean, do you have to wear underwear, or are they built into the pants like in bathing suits? Oh, david, i don't know.
OTHERMALE:I don't feel like talking about wedding stuff right now.
OTHERFEMALE:You're still kind of angry about this whole pregnancy-wedding thing aren't you? I am making great strides in my acceptance of this difficult situation.
LEADMALE:Well good, because i really think you're the greatest guy in the world, mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner, and i want you to be my best man.
SUPMALE:Oh, i don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i know it's weird.
OTHERMALE:So don't answer now.
OTHERFEMALE:Just think about it, all right? Yeah, i'll get back to you.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna love me again one day, mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:You'll see.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get back to you about that too.
LEADMALE:Here we are.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, agnes! Hello, dear.
LEADMALE:When we start dancing, if you get confused, just follow her-the left leg.
OTHERMALE:The right one she just drags.
SUPMALE:Oh, this isn't bad.
OTHERFEMALE:There's people my age.
SUPFEMALE:I told you there would be.
LEADMALE:Now let me introduce you around.
SUPMALE:Mother, stay.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, i'm jackie.
LEADMALE:I'm new.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, i'm roger.
SUPFEMALE:Roger.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, so nice to meet a man who likes to dance and who isn't, like, a total troll.
OTHERMALE:Well, my fiancee and i are taking dancing lessons for our wedding.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, that's why a lot of people are here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? who exactly? Well, our whole group.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh, so that would be basically everyone under 90.
LEADMALE:So, okay, well, gotta get back to my mom.
LEADFEMALE:So you and your fiancee have a nice life.
LEADMALE:You know, i was once you.
LEADFEMALE:And now i'm me.
SUPFEMALE:So i will just leave you with that.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, every man here is engaged.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Why, that's lovely.
LEADMALE:Lovely? Listen, old woman, i washed these hose out in the sink and put them on wet because you told me that there were going to be guys here.
LEADFEMALE:Liar.
LEADMALE:Liar! Shh, here he comes.
LEADMALE:Hi, gang.
LEADMALE:Hi, hal.
SUPMALE:Buenos noches.
SUPFEMALE:Buenos noches.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hal.
SUPMALE:Oh, beverly, is that a new scarf? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:I knew we were going to do the samba tonight so i wanted to wear something bold.
SUPMALE:You saucy little thing you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, stop it.
SUPFEMALE:Hal is flirting with bev again.
LEADFEMALE:What else is new? Well, of course i'm flirting with her.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know why? It's because it makes you girls jealous.
LEADMALE:And when you get jealous, your passions come out and you dance like tigresses.
SUPMALE:Wonderful.
OTHERMALE:Okay, everybody, get ready.
SUPFEMALE:We're going to do the samba! hey! Hi there, i'm hal.
LEADFEMALE:I'm jackie.
SUPFEMALE:All right, let's move those hips around, loosen them up.
LEADMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's hot.
LEADMALE:That is good.
SUPMALE:All right, come on, honey.
LEADMALE:You wanna try a turn? a turn? No, i couldn't possibly-yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, do a turn.
LEADMALE:Oh my.
OTHERFEMALE:That's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's do a dip.
LEADFEMALE:You're wonderful.
LEADMALE:What a natural you are.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, really.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, are you gonna be one of my new pupils? Oh, hal, i don't think so.
OTHERMALE:I'm not engaged and i'm not decrepit.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't say that to me.
OTHERMALE:If you had a dagger, you could plunge it into my heart.
SUPFEMALE:You are a big flirt.
LEADFEMALE:With those big beautiful brown eyes, i could be anybody you want.
SUPMALE:Since you're not going to be my student, maybe we can have dinner together.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, sure.
LEADMALE:What do you say, tonight? Yeah yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:After class? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:A little bistro that i know.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me for a minute.
SUPMALE:That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:One, two.
SUPFEMALE:Is this it, hal? where did beverly go, huh? That's beverly's scarf, but you're not beverly.
OTHERMALE:No no, you're carmen on the beach of ipanema.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, hey! Man, look at all this free stuff.
LEADFEMALE:This tv scam is the greatest thing i ever thought of.
LEADFEMALE:Da da da da da the stores! Yes, i think at least six of everything you shamelessly mentioned on the air has been delivered.
OTHERMALE:That is not true.
SUPFEMALE:I did not get the bagel slicer, the fry baby, or the 24-cubic-foot frigidaire.
LEADMALE:Which is almost enough to hold the conner family supply of breakfast meats.
LEADMALE:So where is the stuff you said you got for the diner? Oh man, you wouldn't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:The whole kitchen is full of free hors d'oeuvres.
OTHERFEMALE:I figure the stuff we recognize we'll sell for a buck, and other stuff two bucks.
SUPFEMALE:How come you're so tired? are you having that dream about that giant monkey again? No, i happen to have been out dancing all night.
LEADFEMALE:Oh really? so you met a guy at mom's thing? I was right.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, so who is he? what's he like? Well, he's he's a guy that likes to dance.
OTHERMALE:You know the type.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, he's got shoes and that's who he is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, aside from the likes-to-dance part, sounds just like dan.
SUPFEMALE:There she is.
OTHERMALE:You shameless hussy! you stole my man! Stole your man? what are you talking about? are you gonna deny that you went out with hal after class? He asked me out, so i went out with him.
LEADFEMALE:What's the big deal? so you just stole him from your own mother? you trollop! My sister and my mother are fighting over the same guy? The only thing left for this family is cannibalism.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't steal anybody from her.
LEADFEMALE:The old bat's out of her mind.
LEADMALE:Floozy! jezebel! little miss round heels! Gee, jackie, doesn't that remind you of your sweet-16 party? so you think this is funny? Oh, i think everybody's gonna think this is funny.
SUPMALE:Damn.
OTHERFEMALE:There's that sample limo.
LEADMALE:Well, i hope you guys can keep this up till i get back from my free hot-air-balloon ride.
SUPMALE:You do know that you and hal look ridiculous together.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, i'm not even going to talk to you about this.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong, jackie? been out of circulation too long? too scared to date a man your own age? I'm not scared of anything.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, there's the rabbits.
LEADMALE:Mom-well, maybe a part of it is that i haven't been out there in a number of years, but so hal is a really nice guy.
LEADMALE:He's safe, you know? what's wrong with that? Well, you're not serious about him.
LEADFEMALE:You're taking advantage of him.
OTHERMALE:Mom! You've been going down there for two years.
OTHERMALE:You've never been out with him.
SUPFEMALE:I've cleverly paced myself.
SUPMALE:And he was about to make his move.
LEADMALE:Last week, instead of calling me bev, he accidentally called me "bed.
OTHERFEMALE:" well, there you are.
SUPMALE:Mother, that's not exactly a relationship.
SUPMALE:You don't know anything about hal.
SUPFEMALE:Did you know he was one of the original june taylor dancers? Look, mom, i know you like him, but listen to me.
LEADMALE:You weren't seeing him.
OTHERMALE:I was seeing him every saturday night for the last two years! And it's been wonderful.
SUPMALE:We danced together.
LEADFEMALE:We chatted.
LEADMALE:And oh, how we laughed.
OTHERMALE:You can still do all that.
LEADFEMALE:No, i can't.
SUPMALE:It's ruined.
SUPMALE:From now on, i guess i'll just spend saturday nights looking at television alone.
SUPMALE:Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll go down this week and tell the gals.
LEADFEMALE:And then my dancing days are through.
SUPMALE:Thank you, jackie, for spoiling everything.
LEADMALE:You stole your mother's boyfriend, huh? Been there.
OTHERMALE:Almost cutting my hand off the other day really got me thinking about a lot of stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? like what? Like what it'd be like if i didn't have a hand.
LEADMALE:Shouldn't he be getting ready for his wedding? i mean, is he even thinking about it? Sure he is.
LEADMALE:He's helping darlene with stuff.
OTHERMALE:He asked me to be his best man.
SUPMALE:He's on top of things.
LEADMALE:He asked you to be his best man, huh? oh, did i say "best man"? I'm sorry, i got it wrong.
SUPMALE:He asked me to be his main man.
LEADMALE:Whatever, it's-david, david! I've made up my mind about being your best man, and the answer's no.
LEADFEMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:You hate me.
LEADFEMALE:No, i don't hate you.
OTHERMALE:I mean, it's very nice that you asked me.
SUPFEMALE:I just think it would be better if you asked your brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Mark? I don't like mark.
LEADMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:We just don't get along.
LEADMALE:Aren't you supposed to pick a best man you like and get along with? That's not even true about the person you marry.
SUPFEMALE:Now go on.
OTHERMALE:He's your brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Ask him.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I can just hear his toast now.
LEADMALE:"chicks are weird.
LEADMALE:Let's chug!" there you go.
LEADFEMALE:Mark.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:So i've been thinking about it, and i want you to be my best man.
LEADFEMALE:Look, don't do me any favors, okay? I'm not doing you a favor.
LEADMALE:Look, you asked dan first instead of me.
SUPFEMALE:Why? why? do you really wanna know why? Yeah, that's why i'm asking.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:All right, fine, mark.
LEADMALE:You tormented me my whole life.
LEADFEMALE:You know, my first memory is of you stuffing me in a piano when i was three years old.
LEADFEMALE:You stole my allowance.
LEADFEMALE:You bent the spokes on my bike.
LEADFEMALE:You told every girl i had a crush on that i had fleas.
OTHERMALE:You did.
SUPFEMALE:That one summer.
LEADMALE:Face it, mark, you viciously bullied me until i was old enough to figure out how to just avoid you all together, which is why we are the way we are today.
OTHERMALE:And you wonder why i don't ask you to be my best man? yeah, why not? I just told you, mark.
LEADMALE:It doesn't matter.
SUPMALE:I don't wanna be your best man anyway.
LEADMALE:Fine, then just say no.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Oh, you're driving me crazy! Mark, come here.
OTHERMALE:Just say you'll be my best man and shut up! look at this! you can't even ask me nicely! All right, fine, mark.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be my best man, all right? Just kill me and put me out of my misery.
LEADMALE:Look, if you're that miserable, i'll be your best man.
OTHERMALE:Will that make you happy? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's good.
SUPFEMALE:It's a good start.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i mean, we are brothers.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:No way am i letting you stuff that cake in my face though.
SUPFEMALE:You can't leave us, bev.
SUPMALE:You're the sparkplug for our little ensemble.
LEADFEMALE:Please, ladies, allow me to do this with dignity.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna end up like ginger rogers dancing past my prime.
SUPFEMALE:Well, ladies of the chorus, adieu.
OTHERFEMALE:And where do you think you're going, beverly? I just-i'm quitting the class, hal.
LEADMALE:Quitting? Yes.
LEADMALE:You can't quit.
SUPMALE:We need you.
LEADFEMALE:I need you.
SUPMALE:You're like a willow by a lake.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? You're like a raindrop dancing on a windowpane on a warm hot summer night in august.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hal, that's what jeff chandler said to mamie van doren in "surrender in september.
LEADMALE:" oh.
LEADMALE:You were so wonderful in that.
OTHERFEMALE:What was your line? "i'll pull the car around.
LEADFEMALE:" but this isn't a movie, hal.
LEADMALE:It's my life, and it's time for me to get on with it.
LEADMALE:No no, you can't leave, bevvy.
LEADFEMALE:You can't.
OTHERFEMALE:You're my favorite student.
SUPFEMALE:You're not going to leave me alone here with all these old ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Please don't.
LEADMALE:Jackie isn't old, hal.
OTHERMALE:Oh, her.
SUPFEMALE:Well no, you raised a very charming woman.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, very very nice, and i like her, but there's-what are you saying? you're not interested in her? why should i settle for a pale copy of the original? Oh, hal, please.
LEADMALE:Really? why drink grape juice, when you could have vintage bordeaux? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:I can't have you disparaging my daughter.
LEADMALE:She's a fine young woman and mother.
SUPMALE:And i'm sure her credit rating will be restored within the year.
LEADMALE:Please, you must stay.
OTHERMALE:Should i? Oh, i don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm not starting this class without you.
LEADMALE:My capezios are in the car.
LEADMALE:I'll be back in a trice.
OTHERMALE:Wonderful.
LEADMALE:All right, everybody, tonight we're going to do the rumba.
SUPMALE:I'll be back in five-quicker than you can say "xavier cugat.
LEADFEMALE:" oh, hal, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, hal, for doing that.
LEADMALE:She's such a sweet kid.
LEADMALE:And i wanted to thank you also for the time that we spent together, you know? I haven't been dating for quite a while now and it was very sweet of you to help me get back there in the game.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? You're a beautiful woman.
LEADFEMALE:Guys are gonna be lining up.
LEADFEMALE:You're like a willow by a lake.
SUPFEMALE:You're like a drop of rain dancing on a windowpane after a hot warm summer august night.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hal.
LEADMALE:And you-well, you are like the last piece of pizza that everyone wants and no one will take because who knows how long it's been sitting there? Sure, kid.
SUPFEMALE:Anything you say.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, and, hal, i just wanted to ask one other thing.
SUPFEMALE:You know, when we were out dancing the other night, and i don't know, i just wanted to know, am i any good? You suck, baby.
SUPMALE:Which is port and which is starboard? Well, that depends.
LEADMALE:That depends on whether you're coming or going.
LEADMALE:I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern.
SUPMALE:And that's the bridge so that you can get from one side of the boat to the other.
LEADMALE:Would you like a glass of champagne? Love it.
SUPMALE:Which way? Here we are.
SUPFEMALE:It isn't very much.
LEADFEMALE:After all, it's only a yacht.
LEADMALE:Do you wanna see the ashtray i stole from the white house?
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Wow, i can't believe that today our little darlene is getting married to our little david.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i can't decide whether i'm losing a daughter or gaining a daughter-in-law.
SUPFEMALE:So, any word on nana mary? Nobody's seen her since the rehearsal dinner.
LEADMALE:No, but remember last time she went awol and we found her down at the mall diving in the fountain for change? Well, it's my last morning as a single woman.
SUPFEMALE:Not necessarily.
LEADFEMALE:Right, jackie? so, how are my friends doing? Oh, they're still all passed-out drunk in there, but i still poke 'em every so often.
SUPFEMALE:That sounds like fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:The still-breathing poke is okay, but the wake-up poke is gonna be great.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go to becky's trailer to check on david.
OTHERMALE:Can i bring you back a possum? No no no.
SUPMALE:You are not going anywhere.
SUPMALE:It's very bad luck to see your fiancee before the wedding.
LEADMALE:Did you see fred before your wedding, jackie? You're not allowed to see your fiance before the wedding, you've got to wear something old, and you've got to wear-mom, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Did you do any of that, jackie? I got the tuxes.
LEADMALE:Shh! Don't wake up any of these people until every flea in this room has found a host.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! ow! Hey, it's nana mary.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hi, rosie.
LEADMALE:Hey, who the hell's wearing my pants? Oops.
SUPMALE:Yep.
SUPMALE:We got the wrong color tuxes.
LEADMALE:Hey, you guys look great.
SUPMALE:I'd take your picture, but i'm saving all my film for the cake.
LEADFEMALE:Damn, rosie, this wedding's giving me a nasty case of heartburn.
SUPMALE:See? All those years of eating light bulbs to entertain the kids is finally catching up to you.
LEADMALE:Hey, i want you to know that later on today i'm gonna pull darlene aside and i'm gonna give her the mother-daughter talk.
OTHERFEMALE:Good for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but just this once, i'm not also giving her the father-daughter talk.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doing my part.
SUPFEMALE:I'm walking her down the aisle.
SUPMALE:Come on, dan.
OTHERMALE:You've been avoiding her for six weeks.
SUPFEMALE:You've got to stop acting like she's pregnant and has to get married and start acting like you're six hours away from all-you-can eat shrimp.
SUPMALE:But, rosie no buts about it.
SUPMALE:You are gonna get into the spirit of things, and you're gonna start by going in there and helping those boys get dressed.
LEADMALE:And remember, those jackets do not tuck into those pants.
SUPFEMALE:Another bride, another groom another sunny honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:I'm bleeding from the ears.
LEADMALE:Am i bleeding from the ears? Criminy sakes.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? We're halfway there, nana mary.
LEADFEMALE:Calves are always a bit tricky.
SUPFEMALE:Now you've snagged a varicose vein.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, everybody, smile.
SUPMALE:And try to keep those red dots out of your eyes.
SUPMALE:Where's darlene? She's still in the bathroom trying on grandma's gown.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on out, darlene.
LEADMALE:I can't wait to see you in my dress.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, your dress? That's my dress.
SUPFEMALE:The first time i wore that dress roosevelt closed the banks.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:The first time i wore it, i had to take it in around the boobs.
OTHERMALE:Zip it! Darlene, come on out here.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene: i'm not coming out.
SUPMALE:I look ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure you look fine, darlene.
SUPMALE:It's just the lighting in that room is bad, along with the plumbing and the tile.
LEADMALE:Oh! oh! oh, darlene! I got six sticks of dynamite strapped under here.
SUPFEMALE:The first chuckle takes us all out.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene, you look lovely.
OTHERMALE:And don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:The little baby in there doesn't show at all.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, all us dames, we we all got knocked up before we got married.
LEADMALE:With this family, it's like tradition.
OTHERMALE:You look gorgeous, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma's gown looks beautiful on you.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry to say this, darlene, but you do look beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you happy now that you passed on wearing the flannel shirt and bolo tie? Darlene, i was just wondering if you'd reconsidered about little andy being the ring bearer.
LEADFEMALE:I know you think he's too young, but he's been practicing, haven't you, sweetheart? now look, hold the pillow steady, right, honey? And then we take the froot loops and we put these on there, and then we say he's eating the rings.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, i want you to-he really wants to do it.
LEADFEMALE:You tell everybody how you feel about being the ring boy, okay? You tell everybody what mommy taught you to say.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma's crazy.
SUPMALE:Did-did he say grandma's crazy? He just needs a nap.
LEADMALE:He'll be fine.
LEADMALE:Hey, who put the now-unlucky veil on the bed? I mean, i can counteract the effects, but i don't know if i've got enough time to go get the pigeon blood.
SUPMALE:All right, last call for the tux shop.
LEADMALE:We need black socks.
SUPMALE:For mark, size 11.
LEADFEMALE:For d.j. , one cufflink.
LEADMALE:Rule of thumb for tuxes-always get a spare one so you can cut it up for parts.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner? Don't know how.
LEADMALE:So why haven't you tied your tie? Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner doesn't know how.
OTHERFEMALE:Give it here.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, mark, i know you're probably sick of hearing about this, but it just feels weird that mom and dad aren't here.
SUPFEMALE:You still on that? Well, they're our parents.
SUPMALE:I thought maybe for my wedding day, they might-would you just shut up about them already? Man, they never did anything for us.
LEADMALE:They kicked me out of the house when i was 16, and they treated you like a dog.
LEADMALE:Look, the conners are your parents now, okay? You and me both.
LEADFEMALE:They saved our asses.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, mom and dad gave us life, okay? One of us maybe a little more than the other, but still hey hey hey, it's a slap in the face to the conners for you to be all hung up on a couple of jerks who haven't even bothered to call in the past four years.
LEADMALE:Mark i don't want to hear it! Choking.
SUPFEMALE:Where'd you learn to tie a tie like that? Dad.
LEADMALE:It was the only thing he ever taught me.
LEADMALE:Now i've taught you.
LEADMALE:Since it's the only thing he could've done for you today, you don't need him anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, mark.
LEADFEMALE:So, how many times have you been married, nana mary? I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:Counting the cruises i've been on what's the matter? you got butterflies in your stomach? No, a child.
LEADFEMALE:Nauseous, huh? I hear that, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you remember? Your old aunt here was in a similar situation before she got married.
LEADMALE:Yeah, sort of, except for that you were nursing your child at the altar.
SUPFEMALE:Oh yes, i remember that wedding.
SUPFEMALE:Thank goodness someone was offered something to drink.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, enough yakking.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, everybody gather round.
SUPFEMALE:I want one last picture of all the women together before darlene gets married.
LEADMALE:Nana, bring your ass over there.
LEADMALE:Oh my god.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, come here.
OTHERMALE:What? Look in here.
SUPFEMALE:Look in there.
LEADMALE:Darlene's getting married.
SUPMALE:Well, it's just like i pictured it when i objected to it earlier.
LEADFEMALE:Why do they want to have an outdoor hippie wedding? why? why? oh, because the moon is in the seventh house? Well hey! Glad you could make it, guys.
OTHERMALE:Oh, i wouldn't miss an event where roseanne might cry.
LEADMALE:Well, this is just beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't we have our wedding outside? Snipers.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dad, i think i just saw a skunk.
LEADMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:Hey, d.j. , wait up! Wow.
LEADMALE:This is so cool.
LEADFEMALE:I've never been to an outdoor wedding where everyone was wearing clothes.
SUPMALE:Yeah, the '90s sure are nuts.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, look-nana mary.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, dan.
SUPFEMALE:This is nancy.
SUPMALE:Nancy, this is roseanne's grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i'm sure you two must have scads to talk about.
SUPMALE:Why don't you start with aliens? It's so weird that he said that, because i was abducted by aliens in woods just like these one time.
SUPMALE:Really? For a month afterwards, i could play world-championcaliber chess.
LEADFEMALE:And then it just went away.
LEADFEMALE:Well, scott, i'm sure you remember our alien encounter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dear heavens, of course.
LEADFEMALE:Their names were zortron and dennis.
SUPFEMALE:Dennis, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i hated the way those two were always bickering.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:"let's skip by alpha centauri.
LEADMALE:" "we don't have that sort of time.
SUPFEMALE:" "well, we would, if someone hadn't had to see all the moons of jupiter.
LEADFEMALE:" still, it was fun going antiquing with them.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:You know, if i'd known if i'd known we were gonna sit on these hard wooden benches, i would not have worn this thong.
LEADMALE:Let's see.
SUPMALE:Just enough flowers to look beautiful but not enough to attract the bees.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Uh, you know, i wanted to ask you, do you think dad's gonna walk me down the aisle or do you think he's just gonna give me a big push? Oh, now you know he loves you, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, just try to remember that when he gives you the big push.
LEADMALE:Thank god i'm marrying someone relatively sane like david.
OTHERMALE:No no no, darlene.
SUPMALE:All husbands are kind of insane.
SUPFEMALE:You know, after you marry david and everything, there's gonna be times where you'll be sitting there going, "what the hell did i marry this guy for?" and then, like, it'll snow and he'll put chains on your tires, and then you'll remember.
LEADFEMALE:No, david's not allowed anywhere near my car.
LEADFEMALE:Already talking like a married woman.
OTHERMALE:Oh, god, and soon i'll be talking like a mom, just sitting around with the girls eating salads, chatting about sore nipples and waiting for the prozac to kick in.
SUPFEMALE:You remind me of me so much when i was your age, ready to go out and grab the world by the throat and throttle it into control.
LEADMALE:It's really good that you've got all the energy you've got, girlie, because you're gonna need it.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think i can handle it all? I think you're gonna be great.
LEADMALE:And you know if you have anything going on that you need help with-even that baby-you can bring that to us anytime.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i can bring it to you, anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Your dad's gonna come around.
LEADMALE:It's just after our wedding he hardly saw his parents again.
LEADMALE:So i think maybe this wedding, it's bringing all that stuff back up for him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fine.
SUPFEMALE:Then if he ever talks to me again i'll just let him know i'm gonna be around.
SUPMALE:I mean, i'm gonna need someplace to hang out while david's watching the baby and cleaning the house.
OTHERFEMALE:You go, girl.
LEADMALE:I heard that on "ricki lake.
SUPFEMALE:" yeah, i saw it, so don't even go there.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to thank you because you've been really great during this whole wedding thing.
SUPMALE:So thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I know how you could've been.
OTHERMALE:Oh, i could've made you guys miserable.
LEADMALE:Remember how you were the first time david spent the night? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It was awesome.
LEADFEMALE:I was a total bitch.
LEADFEMALE:That'll happen again, you know? I know.
OTHERMALE:So, you ready? Well, in the words of gary gilmore, let's do it.
LEADMALE:Well, darlene's ready.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it! the little midget's freaking out on us! No, he's not.
LEADMALE:He is not freaking out.
LEADMALE:He ju-he loves his mommy.
OTHERMALE:Bull! D.j. , you are gonna have to be the ring boy.
OTHERFEMALE:No way! i'm gonna look totally stupid! i'll be humiliated! Mark, it's up to you.
LEADMALE:I'm your man.
LEADMALE:No! no! Now we promised little andy that he would be the ring boy.
SUPMALE:So i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Pardon us, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Ring boy coming through.
LEADFEMALE:Ring boy coming through.
LEADFEMALE:All right, well, i guess we're next.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, you know, your daughter would like to hear something from you.
SUPMALE:Can't you just go tell her you're happy for her or something? why are they not standing up? The guy at rehearsal said they only stand up for the bride.
SUPFEMALE:I really don't care what the guy at rehearsal said.
LEADFEMALE:The hell with tradition.
LEADMALE:Everybody up! i want you standing up! Good.
LEADMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Scary, huh? You look different.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mission accomplished.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:She got sick.
LEADFEMALE:What'd you say to her? what's the matter? She's pregnant, she had to barf.
LEADFEMALE:Ain't none of you ever been to a wedding before? I'll go get her.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I had one job-that was to walk my daughter down the aisle.
LEADMALE:I'll do it.
LEADMALE:Well, picked a good spot.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:You should always find a downslope according to "modern bride.
LEADFEMALE:" you okay? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, i guess we'd better get back.
LEADFEMALE:Wait up.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, there's something i've been wanting to talk to you about.
LEADMALE:It's a good thing i had to puke or you'd have missed your chance.
SUPFEMALE:See, uh, i was thinking man, how do i do this? are you all right? Yeah, i'm okay.
SUPFEMALE:It's just um well, here.
OTHERMALE:What's this? That's a key to a savings deposit box.
LEADMALE:Nobody knows about it.
LEADMALE:There's a bunch of savings bonds in there and a coin collection that my grandfather gave to me.
LEADFEMALE:That's your just-in-case money, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, you're gonna need this more than we are.
LEADMALE:No, honey.
SUPMALE:Now you've got a baby coming, and i just think-you have a baby at home now.
LEADMALE:You're just gonna take it, 'cause i just think if you had more money laying around you'd have more chances to change i don't know, whatever it is you want to change.
LEADMALE:I just don't want you to miss any opportunities, darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not going to miss any opportunities.
SUPMALE:David and i are still young enough so that we have plenty of time to do whatever it is-no no no no no no.
LEADMALE:You see, that's where you're wrong, darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody thinks there's plenty of time to do whatever they want.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, there's not.
SUPMALE:Stuff happens.
SUPMALE:What stuff? Oh, i don't know.
SUPMALE:Any kind of stuff.
SUPMALE:All kinds of stuff.
LEADFEMALE:See, you plan things and the clock keeps ticking, and you never do 'em, and suddenly d.j. 's in high school and you're having a baby.
LEADMALE:I haven't talked to my dad in two years.
SUPMALE:Well, you look beautiful.
LEADMALE:What's the occasion? dad, i'm not going anywhere, okay? I'm gonna be around.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the first time i held you, you were wearing white and you threw up.
LEADMALE:I've been behaving like a total jerk when i should have been supporting you.
LEADFEMALE:Are you okay? can i do anything for you? You could walk me down the aisle.
SUPMALE:You ready to give me away? No, i'm not.
LEADFEMALE:At this time darlene and david have elected to share with each other vows that they've written themselves.
SUPMALE:I, david, promise to always love and respect you, darlene, my fellow traveler on this planet, as we tread lightly and replenish what we have taken from this earth.
SUPMALE:I guess we'll have to return the deer rifle we got him.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear that? did you hear what i just said? It was funny.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, deer rifle.
LEADFEMALE:And i, darlene, promise to love and respect you, david, as we strive not for material possessions but for contentment and peace of mind.
OTHERFEMALE:I think she's got marriage mixed up with a nap on the porch.
LEADMALE:How come you're not laughing? did you hear that? Deer rifle.
LEADFEMALE:And we know the best way that we can make it is to rely on each other the way our parents, dan and roseanne conner, have.
SUPMALE:No matter how good or bad life has been to them, they always found the humor in it.
LEADMALE:We hope we can do the same.
LEADMALE:I didn't even see that coming.
LEADMALE:Did you hear that? Yeah, i heard that.
OTHERMALE:Congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:You are now married.
SUPMALE:I can't believe you bought that whole pregnancy thing.
LEADMALE:You ought to see nana mary.
LEADMALE:She thinks the ice sculpture is a mechanical bull.
LEADMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I don't feel so good.
SUPMALE:Well, duh.
LEADFEMALE:You were pounding down the imitation crab like it was the real thing.
LEADFEMALE:Good wedding, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You know what i think? i think we ought to get divorced just so we can get remarried again, you know? And then we could write our own vows, and we'll say that we want to be just like us.
OTHERMALE:Uh, i really don't feel so good.
LEADMALE:I'm not kidding.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you should go find a phone, call dr.
LEADFEMALE:Walker.
LEADMALE:Dan call somebody.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Nurse on intercom: paging dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bender.
SUPFEMALE:Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bender.
LEADFEMALE:Oh my god.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, he was awake in the ambulance, and they kept checking his blood pressure and giving him oxygen and everything like that, you know? But they thought maybe he had-he had a minor heart attack.
LEADMALE:They wouldn't say anything more than that.
LEADFEMALE:Is that bad? I mean, that's gotta be bad.
OTHERFEMALE:No, that doesn't mean-it's only been a couple of minutes.
SUPMALE:They told you he's gonna be all right, right? I mean, at least they told you that much.
LEADFEMALE:No, they didn't tell me anything.
LEADFEMALE:It's weird, he's got all these new guys starting on that prison job next week.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay, because they'll just wait till he gets back.
LEADMALE:No, i mean, you know, what if-the important thing is that he's here and he's being taken care of.
SUPMALE:This is a really good hospital.
LEADMALE:Where's the baby? Mark and becky took andy and jerry back home.
LEADMALE:I said that i would call whenever we knew.
OTHERMALE:I wish they'd tell me something, you know? what kind of hospital is this? can you guys take a sit over there? And i'm gonna go get your mom something to drink.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, i know that it's hard, roseanne, but we have to be patient and be really positive.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be here with you the whole time.
SUPFEMALE:Do you want me to take that stuff? No.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna hold on to this.
LEADMALE:Shouldn't this thing be dripping faster? No, that's how fast it's supposed to drip.
LEADFEMALE:I'll check back in on him in a couple of hours.
SUPFEMALE:We have to watch him closely over the next 48 hours.
LEADMALE:Why, what could happen? Well, even though it wasn't a massive coronary and he's stable right now, there still could be some complications.
OTHERFEMALE:It's too early to tell.
LEADMALE:Really? Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Now you can talk to him for a few minutes, but take it easy.
LEADMALE:I'll be back later.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, good looking.
LEADMALE:What-what's going on? well, darlene got pregnant, you know? And then david married her, so we made out good there.
SUPMALE:And we were at the wedding and then you had this little-minor, little tiny heart attack, blah blah blah.
LEADMALE:And here we are now.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, you wanna meet the person who saved your life? D.j. it was amazing, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody was all panicked, but d.j. here, he just starts giving you c.
LEADMALE:P.
LEADFEMALE:R.
SUPFEMALE:I learned it on a dummy at school.
LEADMALE:I couldn't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:At first, when he throws himself on you, i think he's gonna go through your pockets or something.
OTHERMALE:You really did that, son? Yeah, it was really great to see your eyes open up again.
LEADMALE:I know for sure on my the car of my choice.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really proud of you.
SUPMALE:Thanks, son.
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Here, now go tell everybody out there that your dad's up and that he's doing good.
LEADMALE:A heart attack? Yeah, a minor heart attack.
LEADMALE:Well, i remember getting in the ambulance.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that was really cool, riding in that.
OTHERMALE:They let me ring the siren.
LEADMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We went through five or six red lights, ran over a couple of people, a dog.
SUPFEMALE:Double cool.
LEADMALE:I always wanted to ride in an ambulance.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry i missed it.
LEADFEMALE:I thought your fantasy was to ride on a fire truck with-what's her name? Ursula andress.
SUPFEMALE:Minor heart attack.
LEADMALE:How minor could it be? I mean, look at all the machines i'm hooked up to.
LEADFEMALE:If i was a car this would cost 800 or 900 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they said that they only have to keep you in the shop just overnight.
SUPFEMALE:And the good news is they're giving me a loaner husband.
SUPMALE:Yeah, he's gonna be okay.
LEADMALE:He's sitting up already and he's in good spirits.
LEADMALE:And it looks like everything is gonna be fine.
LEADMALE:But it's getting late.
OTHERFEMALE:There's really nothing you guys can do here.
OTHERFEMALE:So, you know, unless one of you wants to go and give a liver to the guy in 308.
LEADMALE:I really don't think it's wise for this family to be giving away livers.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well i'm gonna stay here with him overnight.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he's okay and everything, but well, the room's paid for, so what the hell.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, can we see him? No, you can see him later.
LEADMALE:He's sleeping now.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, whatever you want us to do, we'll do it.
LEADFEMALE:We're here for you, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Unless you want us to do something somewhere else, then we'll be there for you.
SUPMALE:So, you know, here or there is where we'll be if you want us to be there or here.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's good because we do have a lot to do.
LEADMALE:We do.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, mark, you ought to take back all the tuxedos.
LEADMALE:And put dan's on the bottom, 'cause they had to cut it off of him.
OTHERFEMALE:Good thinking, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:And while you're out then go to the park there you know, where we had the wedding, 'cause we left all that wedding food and garbage laying around.
OTHERMALE:Go get that sign that says conner wedding and throw that away.
LEADMALE:I'll help you, mark.
SUPFEMALE:And i'll drop by the house and bring you back a change of clothes.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh you guys just ought to go home and change.
LEADFEMALE:Go to the cafeteria though, and bring me back some coffee.
SUPMALE:Okay, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Give dad a kiss for me, okay? god, do you believe all of this? Here, you sit down.
LEADMALE:He'll be all right.
LEADMALE:Dan's strong.
LEADMALE:Everything will be all right.
LEADMALE:Man i've been with him since i was 16 years old.
LEADMALE:What are you still doing here? I sent everybody home two hours ago.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want to go.
SUPFEMALE:What have you been doing the whole time? Read magazines, watching tv.
LEADMALE:"highlights"? how are that goofus and gallant doing? Same as always.
SUPMALE:Gallant's getting straight a's-yeah, and goofus is getting all the girls.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call somebody to come get you and take you home.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to stay.
SUPMALE:There is just no reason to stay.
SUPMALE:I mean, everything is totally okay and under control, and we're all really exhausted now.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I keep forgetting how grown-up you are.
SUPFEMALE:Nurse on intercom: dr.
LEADFEMALE:Bender to the nursing ward.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:D.j. 's wanting to sleep over, so i'm gonna let him.
OTHERFEMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Do you want me to call anybody else? you want me to call your parents? No, don't call them.
LEADFEMALE:How are the other kids doing? Well, becky's home taking care of the baby.
LEADMALE:Dave and darlene are around.
LEADMALE:I hear they canceled their honeymoon.
LEADMALE:Oh man, they canceled it? Well, they just moved it to our basement.
OTHERMALE:They can do it later.
SUPMALE:No, they won't.
LEADMALE:Yeah, they can.
LEADFEMALE:Those bus tickets are good for a whole year.
SUPFEMALE:Oh man, i really screwed up.
LEADMALE:No, you didn't.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i did.
OTHERFEMALE:This was supposed to be darlene's day, now all of a sudden everybody has to take care of me.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:Real good, dan.
LEADFEMALE:They didn't even get to finish their reception.
LEADFEMALE:So, nobody cares about the reception.
LEADMALE:I do.
LEADMALE:So what? The wedding is the thing that matters.
LEADFEMALE:We had the wedding so can't you just stop thinking about that and just try to relax? I'm having a real hard time not thinking about this.
SUPMALE:Yeah, me too.
SUPMALE:What are you doing, darlene? Dad bought a new garbage disposal before he went into the hospital, so i'm installing it.
LEADMALE:You don't know how to do that.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a simple machine, becky, that eats up garbage, no more complicated than your husband.
SUPMALE:That's dad's job.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i just thought it'd be a nice surprise for him for when he got home.
LEADMALE:Well, it won't.
SUPFEMALE:It'll make him feel like we think he can't do that kinda stuff anymore, like, we're treating him like some invalid or something.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you may be right.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm right.
LEADMALE:Can you get me the flashlight out of the drawer? Shine it right there.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't taken out the old one yet.
LEADFEMALE:It's stuck.
SUPFEMALE:It doesn't want to come out.
LEADMALE:I guess this is the dream house for a garbage disposal.
SUPFEMALE:It was weird seeing dad like that.
LEADMALE:He seemed so frail.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:God, i never thought i'd see him like that.
SUPFEMALE:I never even conceived of something like this happening.
LEADMALE:Yeah, like i'd see those guys, these big guys and they'd have these huge chili dogs that they'd be munching on and i'd think, "whoa, there's a heart attack waiting to happen.
OTHERMALE:" god, becky, i mean maybe people thought that when they saw dad.
LEADFEMALE:I never did.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Me either.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i should have.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm pretty sure chili dogs are off-limits for the old man from here on out.
LEADMALE:Yeah, which means mom can't eat hers in bed now, so what if he died? He's not gonna die, becky.
LEADFEMALE:He's gonna be fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe not this time, but someday.
LEADFEMALE:What are you thinking? Just shut up, becky.
LEADMALE:What, don't you ever think about that? don't you ever wonder what it'd be like if dad died? God that would be weird.
SUPMALE:And mom-mom will never die.
LEADMALE:It'd be weird to come in here without dad being here.
LEADMALE:Hey, what do you say we just let dad do this when he gets home? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You got to be bored out of your skull, doll.
LEADMALE:No, they got a lot of great magazines laying around here.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to this, "with the election a month away, bush leads dukakis by 12 percentage points.
OTHERFEMALE:" nixon's out of office? Huh.
SUPMALE:Honey, why don't you go down and get yourself something to eat? You got to be starving.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm fine.
LEADMALE:I've been taking hits off your i.
LEADFEMALE:V.
SUPMALE:While you weren't looking.
LEADMALE:Next time we'll get chocolate.
SUPMALE:Rosie, i'm fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Go.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i guess if i hurry down there i can beat the post-dialysis rush.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:You want me to get you anything? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, honey.
SUPFEMALE:You sure you don't want a cigarette or something? Oh, man.
LEADMALE:All right, you got my attention.
OTHERFEMALE:I got no more fight left in me.
SUPFEMALE:That's all i had was the fight.
SUPMALE:Listen, i don't mind that you pegged me for one of these guys that has to keep grinding it out, but you had me feeling like i was shoveling coal on the titanic.
OTHERMALE:No matter how fast i was shoveling, it just keeps going down.
LEADMALE:I've been shoveling so hard that i haven't had time to deal with the stuff i was gonna fix later, you know? I'm gonna quit drinking later, i'm gonna start watching what i eat later, i'm gonna deal with my problems with my mom and my old man later.
LEADFEMALE:So is this the big lesson? huh? that later is now, or what? I'm not ready to leave yet.
LEADFEMALE:I will slow down.
LEADFEMALE:Just give me some more time to work on stuff.
LEADFEMALE:And i know you're probably not real big on making deals, but just give me a few more trips around the sun, you know, to i don't want to leave them.
LEADFEMALE:She can't make it without me.
SUPFEMALE:Just it's not like i'm asking for money or the moon.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that much.
SUPMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:So what is this, some kind of huge cosmic joke thing that you got going? every time anything goes good, you have to like, totally make it all crash in on us? why? what did we do to deserve that? why at darlene's wedding does this have to happen? I depend on you and you totally let me down.
LEADMALE:Although i guess it wasn't you that was cooking up all that greasy meat and bacon and bringing him all those beers.
LEADMALE:Sitting there doing that right along with him.
LEADFEMALE:I mean it-it's obvious.
SUPMALE:I should have seen the guy's in trouble.
LEADMALE:Why didn't i see that? Man.
OTHERFEMALE:So i guess you're not the one that blew it.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, why are you doing this? Okay, open.
LEADMALE:What is it? Breath spray or mace.
SUPFEMALE:I forget which.
LEADFEMALE:But, anyway, you got to get all looking pretty and smelling good 'cause i got a big surprise for you.
SUPMALE:Is my poker buddies coming by? No, better than that-people i like.
SUPMALE:Okay, come on in, guys.
LEADMALE:Hello there.
SUPFEMALE:Dan: oh.
LEADFEMALE:What's all this? It's the wedding reception you missed.
OTHERMALE:A dramatization like on that "911.
LEADMALE:" yeah, it'll be fun.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, so let me totally set the scene here.
LEADMALE:Here we are at the wedding and darlene and david have just kissed.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: okay, do it.
LEADMALE:Do it.
SUPFEMALE:Do it, do it, do it.
LEADFEMALE:Aw! everybody, all: aw! Yes, and now we've left the wedding and we're walking into the reception area there.
LEADMALE:So that would be time for dad to give the toast.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, i don't want to.
LEADMALE:No, come on.
SUPMALE:You had really nice things to say and i want you to say it.
SUPFEMALE:So toast away.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Uh, darlene, you'll always be my daughter.
LEADMALE:David, i'm glad that you're officially my son-in-law now.
LEADFEMALE:And if there's anything you ever need or want that i can provide-okay, that's enough of that.
OTHERFEMALE:We want the reception here to stay fun.
LEADFEMALE:So okey-dokey.
SUPMALE:What's next? Then they dance.
LEADMALE:Okay, d.j. , music.
SUPMALE:Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:What? You're supposed to cut in.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:My dear.
LEADFEMALE:Ready for a little fancy footwork? Ready as i'll ever be.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Ready to be dipped? Thanks, dad, you're really light on your back.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, that was fun.
LEADMALE:That was a lot better than the last time.
SUPMALE:It was so embarrassing.
SUPMALE:Remember barry what'shis-face invited me to that big spring dance thingy and mom gussied me all up like a girl and made me dance around the living room with you? Evans.
LEADMALE:What? Barry evans, that was the kid's name.
LEADFEMALE:My god, you remember that? Well, it was my little girl's first big dance thingy.
SUPMALE:We never danced, mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, but there was that one time you threw me up against a wall.
LEADMALE:Sorry about that.
OTHERMALE:No, when darlene and i started living together, we should have told you.
LEADMALE:I guess i was just afraid you would, i don't know, throw me up against the wall.
LEADMALE:Like you did with my boyfriend.
LEADMALE:I'm not sorry about that.
SUPFEMALE:Fisher had it coming.
LEADFEMALE:No kidding, dan.
OTHERMALE:You really saved me, you know? You're the only guy in my life who ever stood up for me and looked out for me and-without wanting anything back.
LEADFEMALE:So, thanks, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dad.
LEADFEMALE:I got a great story.
LEADMALE:Remember that time i saved your life? D.j. , you're getting the car.
LEADFEMALE:So, how are you holding up? I'm starting to drag a little bit.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, well all right.
SUPMALE:We'll come see you tomorrow, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:David: take care.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie: bye.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene: see you tomorrow.
LEADMALE:So short but sweet, how did you like that reception, huh? A bit gaudy.
OTHERMALE:Okay, i'll let you get some rest now too.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, i'm scared.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well i'm not, so we're cool.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, there's something i got to tell you and it's really important.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah? Yeah, i just want you to know that i've never cheated on you.
OTHERFEMALE:And i've never even want to-wanted to cheat on you.
SUPMALE:I just wanted you to know that, just in case-don't say that.
LEADFEMALE:'cause there isn't any just in case, okay? Okay.
SUPMALE:So i have something i want to tell you too.
LEADFEMALE:For the first time in like 25 years i felt like, totally helpless.
LEADFEMALE:A long time, kiddo.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE: there there there.
LEADMALE:That's perfect, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Just when i'm getting used to these pillows it's time to check out.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, there's two of them in the suitcase, and d.j. managed to sneak one out of here under his coat yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:Ready for your lunch? Yes, please.
LEADMALE:Man, i hate this hospital food.
SUPMALE:It's horrible.
SUPMALE:You think i can get them to put me back on the i.
SUPMALE:V.
LEADFEMALE:? Well, just hold your nose now.
LEADMALE:Here goes.
LEADFEMALE:Get ready for some steak.
LEADMALE:Mmm, juicy and charbroiled.
LEADFEMALE:Just the way i like it.
LEADMALE:Paid for by the insurance.
LEADFEMALE:Just the way i like it.
LEADFEMALE:I feel so much better when you baby me.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be taking care of you the whole time, dan.
SUPFEMALE:You have nothing to worry about.
LEADMALE:Thanks, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Shrimp scampi, please.
OTHERMALE:Mmm, shrimpy.
LEADMALE:I think we should go over these doctor's instructions here.
SUPFEMALE:Recovering from a heart attack requires the patient's cooperation and self-discipline.
SUPFEMALE:You're dead.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, no exercise for two weeks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that shouldn't be hard.
SUPFEMALE:You've gone a lot longer than two weeks.
LEADMALE:Look at number two, though.
SUPMALE:No s-e-x for four weeks.
SUPFEMALE:That'll be hard.
LEADFEMALE:Thank god i don't have to go by this list.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great.
SUPMALE:No sugar, no salt, no cholesterol.
OTHERMALE:You know, dan, if more people ate like this, we'd still have the mamas & the papas.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Conner? All your tests look great.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you hear that, dan? You're gonna live.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to live.
LEADMALE:Now all you've got to do is get something to live for.
LEADFEMALE:You can pack up and leave as soon as you're ready.
SUPMALE:That's great.
SUPMALE:Thanks, doc.
LEADMALE:You take it easy.
LEADMALE:I can't wait to get back home again.
LEADMALE:Well, a lot of things have changed since you've been there.
LEADMALE:The rose gardens are in full bloom.
LEADFEMALE:We moved the renoir to the east wing.
LEADMALE:And three of your polo ponies have gone to foal.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, spring.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man, it's so good to be home again.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you spend that time in the hospital, then you look around and you think: we don't have nearly enough religious art.
LEADMALE:Everything looks so different.
OTHERMALE:Was the tv always there? Yeah, you've probably just never seen it turned off before.
LEADFEMALE:What's all this? Tapes.
LEADFEMALE:While you were in the hospital i taped all your favorite shows.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, i didn't realize i had that many favorite shows.
LEADFEMALE:I got a whole other box upstairs.
LEADMALE:Hey, dad, you're home.
LEADMALE:Did you bring me anything? Yeah, the gene for an early heart attack.
OTHERMALE:Hey, buddy, how' you doin'? did you do everything i told you while i was gone? like barking at the mailman when he comes around? Don't pick him up, dan.
LEADFEMALE:He's 10 lbs over your lifting limit.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, careful with the t-shirt.
OTHERFEMALE:When he grows out of it, it's mine.
LEADMALE:Well i guess if we all are gonna go on this diet, i ought to go in there, throw out all the stuff that's bad for us.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course, it may be easier just to move.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going in there with you.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, dan.
LEADMALE:No, honey.
SUPFEMALE:I can't just lie here and watch you destroy the things i love.
LEADMALE:Okay, first, we're starting with the lard products.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Takes up the whole shelf.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, and now anything with little debbie on it.
LEADMALE:You know, it's kind of a waste to throw all this stuff out.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should give some of this stuff to people.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's a good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see.
LEADMALE:This pork and beans-well, you've got to know how to operate a can opener and a stove, so that lets mark out.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give these to darlene and david.
SUPMALE:And i'll give the marshmallows to mark and becky.
LEADMALE:God, i feel like it's a reading of our will.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is this? I've no idea.
LEADMALE:I'll give it to mom.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:We gotta get rid of these eggs, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that.
SUPFEMALE:I do not want to come in here at midnight again and catch you making a 30-yolk sandwich.
LEADMALE:Oh, do we have to get rid of those? My grandfather brought them over from the old country.
OTHERMALE:Eww, look at all the bugs that died trying to get in there.
LEADFEMALE:Hey hey, i forgot this was here.
LEADMALE:I can't believe there's so much.
OTHERMALE:What, what? It's that box where we used to throw all those condiment packets.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Back when we used to try to economize and save stuff, before we said to hell with it.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at this.
SUPFEMALE:There's ketchup, relish, soy sauce-and all of them antique.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look at here.
OTHERMALE:Mcdonald's mustard.
LEADFEMALE:How old you think that is? Mmm the golden arches have an orange hue-i'd say circa 1972.
SUPMALE:Oh, and look: there's mayor mccheese when he was still city councilman mccheese.
OTHERMALE:You know, i've heard that some people collect stamps.
LEADMALE:Used ones? Oh.
SUPMALE:You know, you're taking this pretty good, dan.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you what, honey, it hasn't really been that hard.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:'cause i'm gonna go over there to the fridge.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? And i'm gonna open it.
OTHERMALE:Honey? Now dan, i want you to take a deep breath, clear your mind, and go to your special place of tremendous courage, because it's going.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:You may not wanna watch this.
LEADMALE:Eee.
SUPMALE:Oh, the humanity.
LEADMALE:So, david, you still think camping is the best way to spend your honeymoon? how often do you get back to the hotel to visit darlene? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Now for my victory lap.
SUPMALE:Hey, you didn't miss him at all.
SUPFEMALE:He just came in with d.j. from one of his walks.
SUPFEMALE:It's darlene and david.
LEADFEMALE:I'll put them on speaker.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys, how' you doin'? You're just in time to hear me eat my olympic victory feast.
OTHERFEMALE:Urinal cakes.
LEADMALE:Here, talk to them like a human being.
LEADFEMALE:Hey guys, how you doin'? yeah, how's the food up there? Yeah, your mama and i went camping one time up in wisconsin, up in door county-that's enough.
LEADMALE:It was collect.
LEADMALE:Honey, i've been home for two weeks.
SUPFEMALE:I think i can handle talking to my children.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? did d.j. got you off the leash long enough to chase that frisbee? That was great.
LEADMALE:God, it's been so long since i've taken a walk.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't there used to be a vacant lot on the corner of vernon and grove? Yeah, it is still there, just underneath that bank they built there seven years ago.
LEADFEMALE:When did everybody start putting security gates around their house? Mmm, gee, round the time d.j. started to walk.
OTHERMALE:Amazing.
LEADMALE:Why don't you go in there, lay down on the couch, and i'll bring you in your lunch? Honey, i can make my own lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you work on one of your tv commentaries? You've been on that show since this whole thing started.
LEADMALE:Well, i never thought i'd say this, dan, but you are more important than tv.
SUPMALE:How sad that it took a heart attack to finally hear those words come out of your mouth.
LEADMALE:Hey, d.j. , good job in getting your dad to go on those walks.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, there's a little bit of green in it for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeez, this blows.
SUPMALE:Why do i have to be in this diet, too? Because you want to get an early start.
LEADFEMALE:You don't wanna end up like your dad.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, i guess you're right.
SUPMALE:Heart attacks are the numberone cause of teenage death.
LEADMALE:Hey d.j. , get in here.
LEADMALE:Candy wrapper? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What in the hell is it doing in your dad's pocket? is there any left? Hey, d.j. oh, i don't know how it got there.
LEADMALE:This is unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna yell at him, aren't you? No.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Well, eating this was way wrong.
LEADMALE:Don't you care? Oh, of course i care d.j. , but jeez, the guy just had a heart attack, it's not like i can go in there and yell at him.
LEADMALE:I wish i had a heart attack.
SUPMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:I have been doubly betrayed.
LEADMALE:This is from my stash.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are.
LEADMALE:Here we are.
LEADMALE:We got two big boys all set ready to go to the park.
SUPFEMALE:I got the drinks, i got the snacks, and andy's gonna feed the pigeons.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just let them toss coins at the winos like all the other kids do? Ha ha, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Is something wrong with your car? I just drove past the corner, i saw dan sitting at the bus bench, reading the paper.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, that's unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:He's supposed to be out on his walk.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he he wasn't, you know, reading the paper.
SUPMALE:He was turning the pages like a demon.
OTHERFEMALE:And the lifestyle section-you know how heavy that is on wednesdays.
LEADFEMALE:Don't take this out on me, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't mean to see dan.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't worry about it, jackie.
SUPFEMALE:You're not telling me anything that i didn't know.
OTHERMALE:I know he's been cheating.
LEADMALE:Are you sure? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I found a candy bar wrapper in his pants when i was doing the laundry.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:And then crystal calls me, she says she saw him yesterday at the gas station, heating up a burrito.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, nobody can do anything in this town without you finding out.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:I hear you bought some rash cream.
SUPFEMALE:What gives? well, have you said something to him about it? No, i didn't.
LEADMALE:'cause i just was hoping it would stop with the candy bar, you know? what was i thinking? Dan is the kind of guy that'll stand there eating a couple of frozen eggos all while he's waiting for the others ones to pop up.
SUPFEMALE:This is not, you know, just a little slip, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You've got to stop him.
SUPMALE:I know i do, but the whole heart attack thing is so weird.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't even know what to say to him.
OTHERMALE:I don't know how to yell at him or anything anymore.
LEADMALE:Man, i gotta start stretching up before these walks.
SUPFEMALE:Mile and a half is a lot longer that it was when i was a kid.
LEADFEMALE:Mile and a half, huh? Boy, you must be exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, dan.
SUPMALE:And yeah, you don't even seem to be sweating.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, park time.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, you know, you're not really sweating that much.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha.
OTHERFEMALE:That new speed stick's pretty good, ain't it? Yeah, you're just dry dry dry dry dry dry.
LEADMALE:I tell you, it's good stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Ought to write them a letter.
OTHERMALE:You know, dan? It's really important that you stick to the doctor's orders.
LEADFEMALE:What are you saying, roseanne? I know it's important.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying-no, look, you think this is easy? It's not.
LEADFEMALE:Now i'm hot and tired from my walk, and i'm gonna go take a shower if you don't mind.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, i'll finish making your angel hair pasta in a light tomato sauce.
LEADMALE:You're not the only one around here that can tell lies.
LEADMALE:So, how was your shower? It was a shower.
LEADMALE:Ugh.
SUPMALE:What? this yellow spongy stuff-i mean, do i eat it or did i eat it? It's squash, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You really ought to be used to eating all these healthy foods since you haven't been eating anything else for the last two weeks, right? yeah, well-well, you're not gonna do it, are you? what? I was trying to give you a chance to come clean here.
SUPFEMALE:But, since you seem to be into lying to me, i'd just tell you that i know about all the junk food that you've been sneaking.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? Well, i found that candy bar wrapper in you pants when i was doing the laundry, and it's still at the lab, but i'm pretty sure it's gonna come back with your prints all over it.
SUPFEMALE:I know about your fake walks.
LEADMALE:I even know about your burrito.
LEADFEMALE:At least i'm not gonna get mad.
SUPFEMALE:You're not? No.
SUPMALE:Because i figure, you know, you're just a human being and you're entitled to a couple of mistakes.
LEADFEMALE:I just would like to put it all behind us, and start over again, okay? Oh, i gotta tell you, i didn't like sneaking around.
SUPFEMALE:I know all about the temptation of the three musketeers, dan-the creamy nougat, the smooth milk chocolate.
LEADFEMALE:The dreams of becoming a swashbuckler.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, look at this stuff, honey: peas, carrots, squash.
LEADMALE:I mean, here i am a grown man, you got me eating like a rabbit.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, i know it's hard, but you just keep it up, a little bit of time passes, and then you're stuck in a rut, which is right up your alley.
LEADFEMALE:Well, doctor's orders or not, i can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:It's hell.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i can't live this way.
LEADMALE:I mean, i want my food back, you know? Real food-dead animals.
LEADFEMALE:Brightly colored snacks.
LEADMALE:Things on sticks.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm not gonna keep cooking those crap dinners that got you in this mess in the first place, dan.
LEADFEMALE:What about the crap breakfasts and the crap lunches? well, dan, if you don't like my cooking why don't you just cook yourself? Maybe i will.
LEADMALE:Oh yeah? Maybe you should.
LEADFEMALE:That'll be fun to watch.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:You want me to fix dinner? I'll fix dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fixing dinner! Oh, but honey, you just fixed dinner 11 years ago.
LEADFEMALE:God, you're hiding food, dan? Yeah, with the cleaning products.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the one place i knew you'll never look.
LEADMALE:What was all that crap you were telling me in the hospital, that big speech about how you never cheated on me? what the hell do you call this? Look, i'm sick and tired of being treated like an invalid.
OTHERMALE:So, you're just gonna do it, aren't you? You're just gonna go right ahead and harden an artery right here in my kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to live a little, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You won't let me eat anything, you won't let me take any calls from work.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and i'm not gonna let you talk anymore either, so shut up.
LEADMALE:Just keep your nose out of my work.
SUPMALE:It's none of your business, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I manage to get along just fine without any of your help.
LEADMALE:Without any of my help? well, what the hell do you think i was doing all those years at wellman's and rodbells and the beauty parlor, and the diner? you think i was just earning enough money to go out and buy new hats? And if it wasn't for me, the bank would've came and took this house a long time ago, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I always pull in more money than you brought in.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? oh, what about that year when your bike shop went broke? Yeah, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:You're gonna show me.
SUPMALE:Spread it on.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing in moderation, right? Oh, you got it, baby.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, not for the indestructible dan conner.
OTHERFEMALE:Drinker, biker, party boy right from the '60s.
SUPMALE:"if it feels good, do it.
LEADFEMALE:" or in your case, if it tastes good, eat it.
LEADFEMALE:Watch it, roseanne.
LEADMALE:You know what you are, dan? You are a big fat guy with absolutely no self-control.
LEADFEMALE:You're jerry garcia without the music.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa whoa whoa.
LEADMALE:Let's back up here.
SUPMALE:You are calling me fat? Yeah, i'm calling you fat.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if that ain't the big fat pot calling the kettle black! you better not be calling me fat! Well, that's what i'm doing.
LEADMALE:Fat fat fat fat fat fat fat fat fat fat fat fat fat fat fat fat fat! fat fat fat fat fat! Fine, if you don't want the food i make, dan, then we'll just get rid of it.
LEADMALE:Okay? and you know what? We don't need any more of this health food, either.
LEADFEMALE:Dog's too.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna watch tv.
LEADFEMALE:Of course you are, dan, because that's what you always do when anything gets too damn real around here.
LEADFEMALE:I do not do that.
SUPMALE:Yes, you do.
SUPFEMALE:You run to that tv and walk away from me every single time there is a problem in this family.
LEADFEMALE:Why the hell shouldn't i walk away? You never let me do squat around here.
SUPMALE:Problem with the kids? Hey, you'll handle it, because i'll sure as hell just screw it up.
LEADFEMALE:I watched these kids grow up around here without ever knowing what was going on, or even who they were, and just look at the way they turned out.
LEADFEMALE:I think they turned out great.
LEADMALE:Oh, please, roseanne, look at them.
LEADFEMALE:They're not exactly the kennedy kids.
LEADMALE:No, they're not.
LEADMALE:But their dad sure drinks like uncle teddy.
LEADFEMALE:They're failures, roseanne, and the only reason you won't admit it is because you'll have to admit you failed as a mother.
LEADMALE:The only way i failed as a mother is to let becky and darlene get married so young that they threw their whole life away on a man, just like i did.
SUPMALE:You didn't throw away a thing.
LEADMALE:Yes, i did, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I threw everything away.
LEADFEMALE:But all that's gonna change.
SUPFEMALE:Because from now on, i'm gonna put all my energy into that tv show.
OTHERMALE:That's fine.
LEADMALE:It's just great, you know.
SUPFEMALE:I'll show my daughters that you don't have to give up your dreams for some stupid guy.
OTHERFEMALE:That's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you just move to chicago for all i care.
SUPFEMALE:Then, maybe your damn family won't be hanging around here all the time, give me some room for my family to come.
SUPMALE:Hell, they can't even show up for thanksgiving anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, so that's it, huh? it's my fault that you don't have any kind of relationship with your family? god, you are pathetic! did i ever stop you from picking up that phone and calling your mother? Hey, at least i put my mother in a psychiatric hospital where she can get some help instead of letting her run around in the streets like yours, scaring people! Well, my mother may be like fingernails on a chalkboard, dan, but at least she's allowed to grow fingernails.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:You got the answer for everything, don't you? Yeah, i do.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, why won't you tell me how to clean up this crap that you call decoration? Okay, i will.
SUPMALE:I want you to pick them all up using your ass.
OTHERMALE:And start with the pointy things! you are a controlling bitch! No, i'm not, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to get you to get up off of your ass and stop staring at that damned tv.
LEADMALE:Boy, i tell you, i wish i had never mar-what? Say it.
LEADMALE:Nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that makes two of us.
LEADMALE:You can die if you want to, dan.
LEADFEMALE:But you're gonna have to do it alone because i'm not gonna sit here and watch you.
LEADMALE:I'll be at jackie's.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, have you seen this book? This is everything you need to know about your baby.
SUPMALE:I don't need a book, i watch kathy lee.
SUPFEMALE:All i want is a book that'll teach my kid to kick her cody's ass.
LEADFEMALE:Don't make fun of it.
SUPFEMALE:There's a lot of really useful information in here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, yeah.
LEADMALE:Here, let me pick out a page.
SUPMALE:I'll point to something, ask me a question and see if i don't already know it.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:What? Say it.
LEADFEMALE:Well are you preparing for lactation by toughening your nipples? Yes, i am.
LEADMALE:I'm using them to grate cheese.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, there's something i need to tell you, but before i do, i just want you to bear in mind that calmer heads will prevail.
LEADMALE:What is it? The diner's going down.
SUPMALE:We are going out of business.
SUPMALE:We're going to lose everything-all of our money, our future-we're dead.
OTHERFEMALE:We are dead.
LEADMALE:We are dead.
OTHERMALE:That restaurant across the street is opening tomorrow, and i'm telling you, i peeked in the window today, it is spectacular.
LEADFEMALE:The competition is going to kill us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, every time somebody takes over that restaurant it's more pathetic.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember when it was "french ed's"? Roseanne take a look at this ad.
SUPFEMALE:These people have money.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, a full page? This looks like a really nice place.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, you should put an ad in the paper.
LEADMALE:Save the advice, david, and just keep sitting there and trying to grow that chia goatee.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, i am really worried.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about the restaurant.
SUPMALE:We're gonna be fine.
LEADMALE:What if we're not? then what are we gonna do? Then we'll just dust off the old g-string and tap dance our way back into america's heart.
LEADFEMALE:Now that's a grand opening.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that crowd.
LEADFEMALE:I think you guys are forgetting that our grand opening was pretty cool too.
SUPMALE:Guessing how many beans were in d.j. 's nose? It was only disgusting.
SUPMALE:Hey, people could not believe that he could get 12 in there.
LEADFEMALE:That saved us a chevy cavalier.
LEADMALE:Okay, now who's that over there signing autographs? is that some celebrity? Oh my god, oh my god, oh my-oh my-that is-that's tv's schneider from "one day at a time.
SUPMALE:" with the jeans, the tool belt, the rolled-up sleeves-it all still works for him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm back from across the street.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Give us the report.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you're not gonna believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Did you know that schneider directed the series finale of "one day at a time"? remember that scene when julie tells barbara she'll always be there for her? I cried.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy, you were sent over there to spy, and apparently your cover as a moron was flawless.
SUPMALE:But what was really cool was i thought the guy was dead, but he wasn't.
LEADMALE:Anyway the restaurant is really nice.
OTHERMALE:They stay open till midnight, and they have a really great salad bar.
OTHERMALE:A salad bar? Obviously they're not from around here.
LEADFEMALE:This is a loose meat kind of a town.
LEADFEMALE:We are not some california tofu-eating nordictracking freaks that wanna live past 50.
OTHERFEMALE:They also have a clean kitchen, napkins on the table, and this weird sign in the bathroom that says, "all employees must wash their hands.
LEADMALE:" i'm not making this up.
LEADFEMALE:I bet they don't reuse their straws.
SUPFEMALE:I am telling you this is not another french ed's.
LEADFEMALE:These people have it together.
SUPMALE:Wake up! We do not have to worry about losing our customers.
SUPMALE:Our customers have to come back.
SUPFEMALE:They need the salt.
LEADFEMALE:I brought a sample of the food.
LEADFEMALE:Schneider was giving this away.
LEADFEMALE:God, he is so nice.
LEADFEMALE:They call this their western skillet sandwich.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Western skillet sandwich, my ass.
LEADMALE:That is loose meat.
LEADFEMALE:Those bastards stole our sandwich.
LEADMALE:God, it's delicious.
SUPFEMALE:And i heard people saying theirs was less greasy than ours.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well good, then we don't have anything to worry about.
LEADMALE:No, they like it that way.
SUPFEMALE:They think less grease is better.
LEADMALE:What? why? Oh my god, that's schneider.
OTHERMALE:Don't be taken in by the hollywood glitz, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want, glamour boy? Just a cup of coffee, lovely lady.
SUPFEMALE:I'm trying to get away from the maddening crowd.
SUPFEMALE:You're open, right? Look, schneider under different circumstances, you and i, well, we might have been friends.
SUPFEMALE:But you're with the enemy now, and i'm gonna have to ask you to leave, as much as i have enjoyed your performances on television, and probably film.
OTHERFEMALE:Just wanted a cup of coffee.
LEADFEMALE:And you probably wanted to get it for free, just because you're some big celebrity, right? Well, let me tell you something, pal, this is not wolfman puck's.
LEADFEMALE:This is the lanford lunch box and hollywood types are not welcome here.
LEADMALE:Not you, not streisand, not even the great don knotts.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to take this.
SUPMALE:I've got "hollywood squares.
LEADFEMALE:" roseanne you realize what you just did? You just kicked out schneider.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you think i don't know what i did, jackie? do you think that doesn't kill me? do you think that doesn't tear my heart out? But, a war was started here today, and we didn't fire the first shot.
LEADMALE:This is so good.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, i know you want to compete with that restaurant, but you can't just have me draw little red hearts next to the chili cheese fries and call it the light-and-healthy menu.
SUPFEMALE:You're right, so why not draw a picture of a cancer-riddled colon? That'll draw 'em in.
SUPMALE:Who's the strange yet voluptuous woman hanging out in my kitchen? Hi, dan.
LEADMALE:Oddly, she knows my name.
LEADFEMALE:I know, i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I've been spending a lot of time at the diner, but i'm gonna make it up to you.
LEADMALE:There, done.
OTHERFEMALE:Reenergized by his wife's affection, the husband goes out to once again confront a hostile world.
SUPMALE:Okay, mom, i'm ready to go kick butt at the other people's restaurant.
LEADMALE:Is it really run by nazis? Yes, son, it is.
OTHERMALE:And if it wasn't for them, that whole lot would be a baseball field for kids like you.
SUPMALE:You know your line? "no, there's glass in the salad.
SUPMALE:Now don't use any more of those blood capsules, or you'll have to bite down on real glass.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, he's only 14.
LEADFEMALE:That's the beauty of it.
LEADMALE:He can't do time.
LEADMALE:And look, that restaurant doesn't know it yet, but they are about to start on a brand-new campaign.
LEADMALE:"will cook any pet.
SUPMALE:" i'm guessing you drew the little puppies and kittens, david.
LEADMALE:It's cute the way you made them dance.
SUPFEMALE:They're in a frying pan.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, look, i'll make a deal with you.
SUPMALE:If you calm down until after the baby's born, i'll let you shoot out tires from the porch.
LEADMALE:Oh, poor dan.
LEADFEMALE:You feel like i'm neglecting you.
SUPMALE:Sort of.
OTHERFEMALE:Well i didn't forget about your dinner, okay? I brought you a whole bunch of sandwiches from the diner, and guess what, they're healthy now.
LEADMALE:Show him the menu, david.
LEADMALE:Why don't i just get a job with the tobacco lobby? Okay, dan, here you go.
LEADMALE:Eat up.
SUPMALE:'cause you didn't come by for lunch today, so you must be starving.
LEADMALE:Actually, i'm still kind of full from breakfast.
LEADMALE:Yeah, how could that be? You only had a handful of franken berry and a kraft single.
SUPFEMALE:I got something from the vending machines at work.
LEADMALE:Man, them peanut-butter-and-cracker things are filling.
LEADFEMALE:I ate them all day long.
SUPMALE:All day, huh? say, what number would those be on the vending machine? i guess b3? That's wrong.
LEADMALE:That's the clark bar.
OTHERMALE:Try again.
LEADFEMALE:J6.
SUPMALE:The o'henry.
SUPMALE:Any idiot knows that.
LEADMALE:You ate at that restaurant, didn't you? Roseanne, i would never.
OTHERMALE:The reason i didn't come into the diner today was because-well, it's just-i'm having an affair.
OTHERMALE:Liar.
LEADFEMALE:You ate at that restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:No, i swear, it's true.
SUPMALE:Look, lipstick on my collar.
LEADMALE:That's ketchup.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I had lunch there.
LEADMALE:But it was just one time and it didn't mean anything to me.
LEADFEMALE:I swear.
OTHERMALE:You're gonna make this up to me, dan conner.
LEADMALE:You and all your buddies from that garage are going over to that restaurant, you're sitting by the salad bar and you're gonna french kiss all through lunch.
LEADFEMALE:If you want to compete with these people, why don't you just offer good food at reasonable prices? what, and stoop to their level? Never.
LEADMALE:You need professional help that i just can't afford.
SUPFEMALE:You know, they can come after me, and they can come after my business, but, by god, when they come after my family, that is personal.
OTHERMALE:Damn, that looks good.
LEADMALE:Everybody, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Let's try to get our second wind, so we can get ready for the midnight rush.
SUPMALE:The only rush we're gonna get at midnight is if we all stand up really fast.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i'm not finished.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:You know, this is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:There is no reason for us to be here this late.
OTHERMALE:Yes, there is-them.
LEADMALE:If they stay open till midnight, we will stay open till 2:00.
LEADFEMALE:If they put one of our men in the hospital, we'll put one of theirs in the morgue.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what happened to the coffee? what are you yelling at me for? You know, yeah, i had a little coffee.
LEADMALE:What's it to ya? A person's working late, she needs a little boost.
SUPMALE:You know, get off my back.
LEADMALE:You know, roseanne, we are not in competition with them.
LEADMALE:Our chief rivals are the dumpsters behind mcdonald's and tommy's house of organ meat.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, not only do they have a drive-through window, but they also have that salad bar, for god's sakes.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody is going to even remember their salad bar when they find out about our waffle bar.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, normal people don't want a waffle bar.
SUPMALE:Normal people are appalled at the idea of a waffle bar.
LEADFEMALE:Why? We've got the good waffles.
OTHERMALE:We've got eggos.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, at least i came through with something.
OTHERMALE:What happened to the celebrity you promised me? where's burt reynolds? Doing "man of la mancha" in green bay.
LEADMALE:But i'm pretty sure i can get keanu reeves.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, how do you know keanu reeves? Not important.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, all right, the fat guy with the dog just left, so that means they're down to two customers.
SUPFEMALE:We've got three, so we win, we win! No, you can't go.
SUPMALE:Please, sir, you can't go.
LEADFEMALE:Have you tried our new waffle bar? I don't want your stupid waffles.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going across the street.
LEADMALE:They got cappuccino over there.
LEADMALE:Well, great.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just go ahead and walk right over there, you big bald-headed coffee-drinking queen? Sit! Okay, that's it.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not sticking around for just two customers.
SUPMALE:If you need me, here's my pager.
LEADMALE:The number's right on the side.
LEADFEMALE:They're staying open for two customers.
OTHERMALE:No no no no no.
LEADMALE:They are staying open for their drive-through window business.
SUPMALE:We don't have a drive-through window.
OTHERFEMALE:I realize that, but we have a waffle bar.
OTHERFEMALE:But they have a drive-through window.
SUPFEMALE:But we have the reputation in this town.
SUPMALE:Right, as the place without a drive-through window.
OTHERMALE:Fine, leon, you want a drive-through window, i'll give you a drive-through window.
LEADMALE:Next! Don't you think you've carried this competition thing a little too far? can't we just go home? No, i mean, call me old fashioned, but i do believe in standing up for what's right.
LEADFEMALE:That's the american way.
LEADFEMALE:That's why we're breaking in here tonight.
OTHERMALE:I am an ex-cop.
LEADMALE:I swore to uphold the law.
LEADMALE:Well, you also swore to stay married to fred.
OTHERMALE:Face it, you're evil.
SUPFEMALE:Let's milk it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, roseanne, look at this place.
OTHERFEMALE:We're finished.
SUPMALE:Look at this.
SUPMALE:"no shoes, no shirts: no service.
LEADFEMALE:" well, la-di-da.
OTHERMALE:Clean and sparkly, and it smells so lemony.
OTHERFEMALE:And what goes better with lemons than fish? Rotting smelling fish.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe the grocery store was gonna throw those out.
LEADFEMALE:Ew! ew! Here, jackie, think fast.
LEADMALE:Oh-oh-oh, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Hey, there's that damn salad bar.
LEADFEMALE:What's that you say, little fella? you wanna be in a spot close to the anchovies? Now go, be with your people.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's go in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's so clean.
LEADMALE:Yeah, forget county hospital, i'm having the baby here.
LEADMALE:Well, let's get started.
LEADFEMALE:First, a little mood lighting.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Oh, i found the perfect spot.
LEADMALE:No, don't don't.
LEADMALE:No, you're gonna hurt yourself.
LEADMALE:Come on, jackie.
SUPMALE:It's not like this is the first time i've ever done anything like this.
SUPFEMALE:I just need to reach up here to this oh, oh my god.
OTHERMALE:Oh my god.
LEADMALE:What? Oh my god.
LEADMALE:What? oh my god! what what? oh my god! what what? i'm stuck! You're stuck? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Get me out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't don't don't.
OTHERMALE:Just-just calm-just relax.
LEADFEMALE:Now just go limp and then you'll slide right out of there.
SUPMALE:How did you get stuck? By my boobs.
LEADMALE:They folded down on the way up, but then they locked like those toggle bolts.
OTHERMALE:All right, all right, this is the plan: i am gonna flee the scene.
LEADFEMALE:You fend for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Don't.
SUPFEMALE:You're not going anywhere.
OTHERFEMALE:You'd better pray my water doesn't break.
LEADMALE:I will-i'll get you out.
SUPMALE:I will get you out.
SUPMALE:Just-i know.
LEADMALE:I'll turn on the stove and then the metal in the vent will expand.
SUPMALE:I'm standing on the stove! Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:It's amazing to have your head stuck in a vent and still not be the stupidest person in the room.
LEADMALE:Okay, i've i have an idea.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna use this crisco to grease you out of the chimney.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear what i just said? I'm going to use this crisco to grease you out of the chimney.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, we should just face it-this place is gonna beat us.
LEADFEMALE:We should just give up.
LEADMALE:No, we're not giving up.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not giving up.
LEADFEMALE:I've been through this once already.
LEADFEMALE:Remember that motorcycle shop? I'm not gonna let that happen with the diner.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
SUPMALE:Stop petting me.
LEADMALE:You're making me feel self-conscious.
SUPMALE:Okay, i'm gonna i'm gonna lube you up now.
SUPMALE:And and then i'm gonna try and pull you out on the count of three, okay? are you ready? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:One, two, three.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez, half of illinois probably thought they were hearing an air raid.
OTHERFEMALE:You should have heard it in here.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:That is it.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call dan.
LEADFEMALE:You need somebody with a tool belt and it's either gotta be him or schneider.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man, dan's been accusing me of being nuts all week and this is just the sort of thing he'll twist to fit his argument.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's that looking at me? Shoo shoo! You're not getting this fish.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry about the whole restaurant bit.
LEADMALE:I lost my mind, i guess.
LEADMALE:It's just i really care about this restaurant.
SUPFEMALE:I don't wanna see it go down.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm staring to go crazy, aren't i? Sometimes i think, like, the whole world is doing this great big choreographed dance around me and i'm just standing there watching it.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be okay.
SUPFEMALE:And nobody's doing a big choreographed dance around you, all right? what was that? Never mind.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Man, our hospital wants us to fill out a lot more of these forms than when d.j. was born.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:We're just having a baby.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not like we're buying a car.
SUPFEMALE:You know, we should do this later, honey.
SUPFEMALE:No, there is no later, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Due in a week-i can't believe how fast this pregnancy went by.
LEADMALE:You're kidding, right? No, i'm not kidding.
LEADMALE:Do you realize that this could be our last weekend of freedom before the baby gets here? God, we gotta go out and do something.
SUPMALE:Here it is, it's saturday night.
OTHERMALE:We gotta go do something tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, losers.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you're thinking-"can she possibly own boardwalk and park place three weeks in a row?" oh yes, she can.
OTHERMALE:Oh yes, she will.
LEADMALE:Well, if there's a lonely, pathetic, yet bizarrely chipper woman standing in our kitchen with a monopoly game, it must be saturday night.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's how life looks when you're stuck on baltic avenue.
LEADMALE:But up on the green properties, life is sweet.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were giving fred the baby on the weekends so you could have a social life.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys are my social life.
OTHERMALE:I can't go out tonight.
SUPMALE:I'm feeling all crampy.
LEADMALE:Tough-we're going out tonight.
SUPMALE:This is our last hurrah.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna go out to a fancy dinner and then we'll sleep over in a fancy hotel-one where the ice machine's indoors.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, we'll have plenty of time to do things once the baby comes.
LEADMALE:No, we're doing it.
SUPFEMALE:And you're wearing you good suit too.
SUPMALE:It's in the dryer.
LEADMALE:Jackie you heard? I laid out your money and everything.
OTHERMALE:Well, this might be our last chance.
OTHERFEMALE:You understand that now, don't you? I'll give you each an extra 500 bucks.
LEADMALE:That's a damn good deal, honey.
SUPMALE:No dan, we are going out.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, we got at least a year of baby jail ahead of us and that kind of time really changes a person-look at her.
SUPFEMALE:I rest my case.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. deej, my favorite nephew, what do you say? so it's just you can me tonight, huh? Monopoly.
OTHERFEMALE:Monopoly? Aunt jackie, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It's saturday night.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to the movies.
LEADFEMALE:Great, we'll catch a movie.
LEADMALE:I'm going with my friends.
OTHERMALE:All right, you can drive me to the movies, but you have to wait in the car until it's over.
SUPFEMALE:Then you can drive me to the ice-cream place, but you have to wait in the car there.
LEADFEMALE:Then you can bring me home.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Sorry, roseanne, i can't play monopoly-i got plans.
LEADMALE:Darlene: come on, becky, let's get out of here-i'm starting to smell like this place.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta at least make it look like i cleaned up.
SUPFEMALE:Just write a note that says "i cleaned up" and put it on that pile of crap.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, check it out.
OTHERMALE:There's a bottle of peppermint schnapps with a card for mom.
LEADFEMALE:"dear leon, congratulations on five years of sobriety.
SUPFEMALE:" that is the meanest thing i've ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:Man, she's good.
LEADFEMALE:You ever had this stuff? peppermint schnapps? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm, what are the odds? It's open.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene oh, relax.
SUPMALE:We're saving a man's life here.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, you got anything better to do? Well-before you answer, remember-it's lanford and it's 8:30.
LEADMALE:We're the only ones up.
SUPFEMALE:Not bad-kind of like a candy cane.
LEADMALE:Yep, every burp is christmas morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Good news-pulled some strings with the maitre d'.
LEADMALE:We only have another hour wait for a table.
LEADMALE:Oh well, that's all right, dan.
LEADFEMALE:There's plenty to do in this hotel.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look at here-"welcome to josh meyer's bar mitzvah.
SUPMALE:" wow, jewish people in their natural habitat.
LEADMALE:I'm starving.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say we grab a bite at the coffee shop and go back up to that room i paid $95 for? That's four times more than i paid for this robert hall.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, hey hey hey.
LEADMALE:Who are those for? They're for the meyer bar mitzvah.
SUPMALE:Oh well, that's us.
LEADMALE:Dinner is starting in five or 10 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:No way, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, dan, grab a yarmulke.
LEADFEMALE:We're going in there.

SUPFEMALE:Are you reform? No, but we're trying to cut down.
SUPMALE:You know, i'm gonna wear this thing with a little southside slide to it.
LEADMALE:Hi there, i've been watching you since you came in.
OTHERFEMALE:You're so brave.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, look at you-your hair is stringy, your ankles are swollen, you are all bloated up.
SUPMALE:But you are out there in public anyway.
SUPMALE:You're an inspiration, you know that? An inspiration.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Well, we're gonna take a little break now.
LEADFEMALE:We come back, the meyer family has requested something from "fiddler on the roof.
SUPMALE:" so if you have any requests, please don't hesitate.
LEADFEMALE:What about something from "jesus christ superstar"? Well, there's one in every crowd.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come up here, young lady, huh? Let's give her a hand.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you give the first toast this evening, hmm? Uh, okay.
LEADMALE:Uh well, um ahem.

LEADMALE:What do we got here? We've got lox and kugel, kreplach, knishes and kasha varnishkes with gravy.
SUPFEMALE:Man, i thought they only liked chinese food.
SUPMALE:Let me have some of that varnish with gravy there.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's delicious.
SUPMALE:Good thing i don't know what it is or i probably couldn't eat it.
LEADMALE:Just like at home.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, they're way better in the old testament.
SUPMALE:Is it okay if we sit here? Only if you got cigarettes.
LEADMALE:Well, don't you think it's a little unhealthy to be smoking at your age? Aw, shut up! i've been to 306 of these things! Okay, mother, let's stop.
LEADFEMALE:Out of here! Let's stop, i'll get you a beautiful cigar in the gift shop.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.

SUPFEMALE:You're gonna go the whole night without saying hello to your uncle sol? you're shlomo, right? No, i'm not, i just had a couple of drinks up in the room.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't recognize us.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you don't recognize us-first no shower gift and now this? you think i don't recognize you? you think i would have sent this through the mail? I wanna deliver it in person.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna give $100 to the baby for college.
LEADFEMALE:I'm having twins.
SUPMALE:She's kidding, uncle sol.
LEADMALE:You're such a kidder.
SUPMALE:She's been a kidder since she was a baby.
SUPMALE:Say, isn't that, um marilyn and marty? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What, do they think they're gonna go the whole night without saying hello to their uncle sol? say you two-you think you're gonna go the whole night without saying hello to uncle sol? what is the matter with you? He was always my favorite uncle.
SUPFEMALE:I'm hot.
LEADMALE:I'm always hot at these things.
LEADMALE:Forget about hot.
LEADMALE:I can hardly hear a thing over that band.
LEADMALE:My fork is too short.
LEADMALE:Did you get a short fork? You know, the kugel was awful.

SUPMALE:Mark is a gorgeous man.
SUPMALE:Now hand me a knife.
LEADMALE:I must gut myself like a fish.
LEADMALE:He is gorgeous, isn't he? But, you know, it's kind of a trade off.
SUPMALE:I mean, he's not exactly the greatest conversationalist.
SUPMALE:Maybe that's your fault.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, when he speaks, you should try rewarding him with little treats.
SUPMALE:Well, he's not that bad.
OTHERMALE:You always make him sound like he's the dumbest guy on the planet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, name someone dumber.
LEADMALE:Oh yeah, like i know everyone on the planet.

LEADMALE:Summer turns into fall, young elvis turns into bloated elvis well, he's more than just looks, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:He's sweet and gentle, doesn't run around, he's perfectly happy spending quiet evenings at home with me and just because we have nothing in particular to talk about ever doesn't mean we don't have a wonderful marriage.
SUPFEMALE:Here-there's no kleenex.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you feel this bad about it, becky, you should do something.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.

LEADMALE:We sure did.
LEADMALE:It was really neat.
OTHERMALE:But i'm confused, dad.
SUPMALE:I mean, aren't atomic bombs bad? Not if they're our bombs, son.
LEADMALE:You see, the atom does play a vital part in our militaryindustrial complex, but it also has a lot of good uses right here at home.
LEADFEMALE:This is a lump of coal.
LEADMALE:Notice how dirty and smelly it is.
LEADFEMALE:Yuck! But this is uranium.
LEADMALE:You'd have to fill a football field to equal the power in this little devil.
LEADMALE:Neato! Soon, if we're lucky, every town in america will have their own atomic power plant and we'll all have electricity that's too cheap to meter.
SUPMALE:Well, stinky and the deej are all tucked in.
LEADFEMALE:And these darn communists are up to their old tricks again.
LEADMALE:Need help? Oh no no, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:You've worked hard all day.
LEADMALE:You just sit there and enjoy your paper.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, little missy, where's the fire? Hi, mark.
LEADMALE:How are you? Oh, tip-toppity, becks.
SUPFEMALE:"where's the fire?" you ask.
LEADMALE:It's in her eyes.
LEADMALE:Here, these-these are for you.
LEADMALE:Marzipan! They're dreamy.
LEADFEMALE:You ready to go, becks? Just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, kitchen.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, you boys go ahead and talk amongst yourselves.
LEADFEMALE:So, how are you, mr.
LEADFEMALE:C? Tip-toppity.
LEADMALE:What am i going to do, mom? We've been dating three weeks already.
OTHERFEMALE:If he doesn't pin me tonight, i'll die! i'll just die! Oh, there there, rebecca.
LEADMALE:If you don't have a steady boyfriend, it won't be the end of the world.
SUPMALE:It won't? I'm just kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it will! Well then, what should i do, mom? Well, actually it's as easy as pie, dear.
OTHERMALE:If you want to trap a man, you cannot appear to be too eager and you must never never act too smart.
LEADMALE:Oh! You know everything about everything, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, i do, dear, but just don't tell your father.
LEADFEMALE:The key to a good fallout shelter is in the locks.
LEADMALE:So when the big one drops and you have to take cover, it's not the commies you'll be fighting off, it's your neighbors.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, have you been talking to mark? We were just talking about the red menace.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm glad i wasn't here for that.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't have understood a word.
OTHERFEMALE:We should be going.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck.
LEADMALE:You know, honey, that boy's starting to grow on me.
LEADMALE:He's opposed to those who are not like us and he's on the football team.
OTHERMALE:Tip-toppity.
LEADMALE:Announcer: "that's our rosey" will return after this brief commercial announcement.
LEADMALE:Gosh, you sound awful.
LEADMALE:These darn cigarettes tickle my throat.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe i should just quit smoking? No, just change brands.
LEADFEMALE:Here, try one of mine.
LEADFEMALE:Say, that's rich tobacco flavor.
OTHERMALE:What brand are these? Yorks.
LEADMALE:Their unique filter allows you to enjoy great taste without wheezing.
SUPFEMALE:And look what i got by saving the coupons.
LEADFEMALE:Why, it's yorkie! The cute little otter from the york cigarette ads.
SUPFEMALE:Stinky, i've got a friend here who'd like to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Yorkie! Both: uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:The old brand's in trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Choir: york's the one for you.
SUPMALE:Come in.
SUPMALE:The balance in this doggone checkbook is as frustrating as this darn anderson account.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't overspent your allowance again, have you? now dear, you haven't seen me wearing any new hats lately, have you? Not this week.
LEADMALE:Look what i've done, dear.
SUPMALE:I've cleared off two whole shelves, so that the deej can fill them up with his football trophies.
SUPMALE:You know, dear, i'm kind of worried about the deej.
LEADMALE:I think that-i mean, i don't think, i-i feel while he likes football, he may actually like music a little better.
OTHERMALE:Music? the deej? yes, dear, haven't you noticed? He's got that pop-beat fever.
SUPMALE:No son of mine is going to be playing in a rock 'n' roll band.
LEADFEMALE:"rock 'n' roll.
SUPFEMALE:" the kids call it music, but i call it noise.
LEADMALE:But, dear, do you really think it would hurt to let the deej decide this for himself? Well-no.
LEADMALE:Let's leave the deej be and let him make up his own mind.
LEADFEMALE:You wanted to see me, dear? Rosey, you've got some explaining to do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, dear.
SUPMALE:I guess sometimes a woman's emotions just get the best of her.
LEADMALE:Well, i forgive you.
SUPMALE:You know, i guess the deej will do whatever he wants to do.
LEADFEMALE:Kids these days just don't listen.
OTHERMALE:Well, i think i know the deej, dear, and he is not going to do anything without his father's approval.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, i'll talk to him.
LEADMALE:What is it, dear? It's just so hard being a man.
SUPMALE:You have to clean out the gutters, balance the checkbook, solve all the kids' problems, and still worry about that darn anderson account.
LEADFEMALE:Oh dear, don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:I'm sure the solution to that darn anderson account will come to you.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Deej, your father's looking for you.
SUPMALE:He wants to talk.
LEADMALE:Go wait in the study.
SUPMALE:Uh-oh, the deej is in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, mose.
SUPFEMALE:Evening, miss rosey.
SUPMALE:I's here to pick up that box of discards for the church.
SUPMALE:It's right over there.
LEADMALE:Go on, get it, june bug.
LEADFEMALE:So, mose, how are all the colored people doing over on your side of town? Good.
LEADMALE:Everybody's workin' over there.
LEADMALE:Colored people's happy when they're working.
SUPMALE:How's all the lovely white folks on this side of town? Just fine, mose, thank you.
SUPMALE:That's good.
LEADMALE:Well, it's late.
LEADMALE:I got to get on now.
LEADMALE:You walk with jesus.
LEADFEMALE:Oh yes, definitely.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so cute! Are things ever gonna change, pop? Oh, someday, when one of us is president.
OTHERFEMALE:Might even be you, son.
SUPMALE:Who were they, mom? Oh, that's just old mose powell and his son colin.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, toots.
SUPMALE:Jackie, where have you been? We only have coffee klatch today and i have to soak my hands in this mild detergent so they'll be nice and soft, the way dan likes 'em and i'm already in his doghouse.
LEADMALE:Doghouse, huh? Did you ball his socks instead of folding them? 'cause i did that to fred once, and whoa! No no, nothing like that.
LEADFEMALE:You see, dan wants the deej to play football and i-i kind of encouraged him to play the guitar instead.
SUPFEMALE:You went against dan's wishes? Well, the deej wants to play guitar, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:And i know, because, well, i'm the one that's home all day every day from morning till night.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, could you please not be wacky for one minute? Sorry! What i'm trying to say is-well, gosh, it seems like i do everything for this family and yet dan gets all the credit.
LEADMALE:Well, he is the man.
SUPMALE:But i do all the laundry, i balance the checkbook, i do the shopping, i take care of the kids and the car and darn it, i'm just not say it, rosey, say it! I'm not happy.
LEADMALE:That's all i needed to hear.
SUPMALE:Jackie, what are you doing? You're not alone.
SUPFEMALE:There are other women who feel the way you do.
LEADMALE:They talk about changing things.
LEADMALE:Changing things? Who don't want to take it anymore! no, stop! who don't want to do what their husbands say just because they say so! no more! no more! you're giving me a pounding headache! I'm not giving you a headache, the truth is giving you a headache.
OTHERMALE:Jackie, i can't believe this is coming from you.
LEADMALE:You're so wacky! That's my cover.
LEADFEMALE:A bunch of us are having meetings once a week.
OTHERFEMALE:We call them "tupperware parties.
LEADMALE:" there's only a few of us now but we're growing.
OTHERFEMALE:We're planning a revolution.
LEADFEMALE:Under the guise of keeping your leftovers fresh? That's brilliant.
SUPFEMALE:Are you with us? are you telling me that if i join, i won't have this feeling of hopelessness anymore? i can have some control in my life, and over my own destiny? yes! that's the spirit, sister! well, you're not gonna hit me, are you? No no! this is what we all do! Announcer: don't go away.
LEADMALE:"that's our rosey" will be right back.
SUPMALE:Ho-hum.
LEADFEMALE:Feeling "ho-hum"? Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Clean.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't have a lot of energy lately, doctor.
LEADFEMALE:I have trouble concentrating, a general feeling of hopelessness and i just feel out of sorts.
LEADFEMALE:Well, has your housework suffered? Not yet.
LEADFEMALE:But i did notice this morning when i was ironing, for the first time i didn't hum.
OTHERMALE:I've been hearing this a lot lately.
OTHERFEMALE:You need baritol.
OTHERMALE:Baritol? Yes, many housewives find that it soothes and restores.
LEADFEMALE:Announcer: baritol contains alcohol and other fine distilled products.
LEADMALE:It helps them get back to the things that matter most, like cooking and cleaning.
LEADMALE:Okay, son, go wash up.
LEADMALE:Dad, you're the greatest.
SUPMALE:Rosey, how about some coffee? so, how did your talk with d.j. go, dear? Swell.
LEADMALE:Turns out i was right all along.
LEADMALE:The lad really did want to play the guitar.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's just great.
LEADMALE:That's nothing.
SUPFEMALE:You should see the way i handled that anderson account.
OTHERFEMALE:The boss has invited me to his club for a steam.
LEADFEMALE:Oh honey, you're so smart! i love you to pieces! Hey, what do you say we push our twin beds together tonight and? Shh.
SUPMALE:The kids'll hear you.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-oh, dad's in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Chorus: that's our rosey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody listen to what i say i may be a kid, but i don't play the stuff i know they don't teach in school do you know what i mean? i'm too cool for cool chorus: he's cool, man, he's too cool well, i'm too cool he's cool, man, he's too cool do you know what i mean? i'm too cool for cool i've got the glasses, the suit and the attitude anybody doubts me, i just say "shoot" i may be young but i ain't no fool do you know what i mean? I'm too cool for cool chorus: cool.
LEADFEMALE:And you didn't want to buy him a guitar.
LEADFEMALE:That's our rosey.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE: okay, he's in his car seat and ready to roll.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that little jerry garcia conner.
OTHERMALE:He's so cute and content in the car.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we sure named him right.
LEADFEMALE:He's only happy when he's on the road.
SUPMALE:Okay, he's starting to fuss.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's get this thing loaded.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that ought to be enough to get us to the mall.
LEADMALE:Boy, i've never seen him this happy.
LEADMALE:Look at him drool.
SUPMALE:You know, my andy still drools.
SUPMALE:At what age does this drooling go from a sign of happiness to a sign of you know hello, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Gump, we found your son? Here's sensitivity, here's you.
OTHERMALE:Chasm! Boy, what a cool day.
LEADFEMALE:For the first time in two weeks, jerry hasn't been cranky or clamping onto my breast every two seconds.
OTHERFEMALE:Now if a car ride could just do the same for dan i'm glad you're happy.
SUPMALE:I can't believe in that whole mall i couldn't find that hair color that cybill shepherd uses.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe you're just not worth it.
SUPFEMALE:We ought to go to that big outlet mall up in elgin.
OTHERFEMALE:Elgin? That's an hour away.
OTHERFEMALE:So, how would you rather spend the next hour? a peaceful drive in the country, or back at my place with gray roots and a screaming baby? can we discuss it before you make up my mind? There has to be someplace closer than that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, jerry's happy and that makes me happy.
OTHERMALE:We want to go to elgin, huh, honey? That's it.
OTHERMALE:Turn this thing around.
LEADFEMALE:You're outvoted.
SUPFEMALE:I can't be outvoted by a baby.
SUPMALE:Okay, then i'll outvote you all by myself.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, deej, are you playing a video game? No, dad, i'm developing my hand-eye coordination, so i can be of use to the u.
LEADFEMALE:S.
SUPMALE:Army.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me put this another way: if you weren't here right now, i would have the house to myself for the first time since well, ever.
LEADFEMALE:So what's it gonna take? I'm writing down a number.
LEADFEMALE:Interesting how does this grab you? are we gonna do business or you just gonna bust my chops? This thing you have done for me, i will not forget.
LEADMALE:I'll be home by 8:00.
LEADMALE:Okay, 9:00.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:The house is mine.
LEADFEMALE:Mine, i tell you! First comfort ah then entertainment.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPMALE:You two are going out tonight, aren't you? Well, we weren't going to.
LEADMALE:Until we heard you were giving away money.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, deej.
LEADMALE:Your brother cleaned me out.
SUPMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:David, why don't you go get that 10,000-piece puzzle off the top shelf? Wait a minute, wait.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:If the waiter cuts that in half you're on your own.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right, i got plenty of cash.
LEADFEMALE:Ahh.
LEADMALE:What's with wives? I don't get it, man.
LEADMALE:She kicked me out of my own house.
SUPMALE:She kicked you out, so you come to her parents' house we're the ones who taught her not to like you in the first place.
LEADFEMALE:Do you understand your wife, dan? I understand that she's gone for the first time since she had the baby.
SUPMALE:And i finally have the opportunity to ponder world events, religious philosophies see how many different sounds my body can make.
LEADFEMALE:What are we watching? I was watching the game alone, by myself, solo, party of one.
SUPMALE:It's a good thing i came over, then.
SUPMALE:Hey, roseanne, put these on.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna take our picture and we'll look just like thelma and louise.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:People do say i look just like geena davis.
LEADFEMALE:And you look just like harvey keitel.
LEADMALE:My boy.
SUPMALE:Here you are.
OTHERMALE:I think you forgot this.
LEADMALE:Oh, i forgot the bag with all my stuff in it.
OTHERMALE:All right, i'll tie it to the back of the car and we'll drag it along behind us.
OTHERMALE:Do you guys think you can give me a ride? I'm kinda stranded.
SUPMALE:Stranded, huh? That's awful.
OTHERMALE:Excuse us, young woman.
LEADMALE:Come on, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:No no.
SUPMALE:Don't even think about it.
LEADFEMALE:We have to go home.
SUPMALE:Look at her, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:She looks so alone.
SUPFEMALE:She looks like an escapee.
SUPMALE:We can't just leave her here.
SUPMALE:Of course we can.
SUPFEMALE:So, where are you heading, miss? My name is garland.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to glenview.
LEADFEMALE:Glenview-that's like an hour out of our way.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, jackie, we're gonna take her with us.
SUPMALE:Just to be safe, go on and pat her down.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, missy if you're gonna be traveling with us, just to be safe, you know, i'm gonna have to give you a little frisk.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay, she used to be a cop.
SUPFEMALE:At least that's what she told me when she did it to me.
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:She's clean.
SUPMALE:I set the thermostat on 70, i come back a few minutes later, becky's got it turned up to 78.
LEADMALE:You rig the thermostat so that when it says 78, it's really 70.
SUPMALE:It's funny.
LEADMALE:I used to be happy when my team was winning.
LEADMALE:Then she forgets to pay the bills for a couple of weeks.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she's the one who wants to handle the money, so you know, handle it, lady.
SUPMALE:Darlene, come on, we're not going to see "showgirls" again, it's a bad movie.
SUPFEMALE:I know, david, it's the worst.
SUPFEMALE:Everything that joe eszterhas writes is his revenge on some girl who ignored him in high school.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen what the guy looks like.
SUPMALE:I'm guessing he's got 1,000 more in him.
LEADMALE:But it embarrasses me when you holler and throw things at the screen.
LEADMALE:Well, it embarrassed me when you teared up at "sleepless in seattle.
LEADFEMALE:" okay, but you know we can't go back to the same theater where we saw "basic instinct.
LEADMALE:" they have our pictures up in the box office.
LEADMALE:Okay, cool.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow we'll see one of those sensitiveforeign-little-boywith-a-bicycle movies you like to see.
LEADFEMALE:And i'll bring a book.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
OTHERMALE:I don't believe them.
LEADMALE:They have a fight and they make up in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:There's a difference, mark.
LEADFEMALE:What, that they're younger than me and becky? The reason that they have a fight and then make up the next minute is that they are not married.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but me and becky are married, so how is that different? When you're married for 20 years, you'll understand.
LEADFEMALE:Why? You guys have been married for 20 years.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Look maybe if i tell you this it'll make you feel better.
LEADMALE:Let me explain to you what it's like to be married to mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna need some more beer.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you'd get a better view and it'd probably be a lot safer if you just had her ride out there on the hood.
OTHERFEMALE:So garland, tell us about your band.
LEADFEMALE:It's awesome.
LEADMALE:See, every member is a riot girl, like me.
LEADMALE:And we call ourselves the "unit shredders.
LEADMALE:" unit shredders? what is unit shredders? Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's cute.
SUPFEMALE:So you have no idea what kind of stuff riot girls are out there screaming about? see, we're about taking control, not trashing yourself, you know? Chicks that rock, taking our place in rock and roll, man-our band is doing it.
SUPMALE:A lot of bands are doing it, actually.
SUPMALE:Have you ever heard of "red aunts"? No.
OTHERMALE:"babes in toyland"? Huh-uh.
OTHERMALE:"l-seven"? Huh-uh.
SUPFEMALE:"bikini kill"? Oh, "bikini kill.
OTHERMALE:" are they back together again? Put it in, let's hear some.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Good message, huh? It's freedom rock, man.
SUPMALE:Turn it up.
SUPMALE:Well, jackie, she's got a metal plate in her head and it amplifies the sound.
LEADFEMALE:That it does.
OTHERFEMALE:Clang-clang, clang-clang.
LEADFEMALE:There's my exit.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we're playing up at the storage unit, up the street.
SUPFEMALE:I'd invite you, but we're sold out.
LEADMALE:All six tickets, huh? pretty good, huh? Keep on truckin', jerry.
LEADMALE:Keep the tape.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm really sorry about your head, dude.
SUPFEMALE:See you later.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know what she is? Nervy.
SUPFEMALE:No, jackie, you know what she is? That music is just noise.
LEADFEMALE:It's a bunch of kids making screeching, loud-just noise.
SUPMALE:What happened to music these days? who the hell are you, tipper gore? Anyways, look, these are pretty good lyrics.
LEADFEMALE:Listen-"don't need you to say we're cute, don't need you to say we're all right don't need your protection don't need no kiss good night.
OTHERFEMALE:" at least these girls are saying something, you know? Not like the music we grew up with.
LEADMALE:Remember "take a letter, maria"? Oh i loved that song.
LEADFEMALE:You do not love that, jackie.
SUPMALE:Have you ever listened to those words? It's about this guy and he's screwing his secretary, and she still has to take his stinking letters to his wife.
LEADMALE:She's getting screwed twice.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's about the guy finds out that the wife is cheating on him.
LEADMALE:Oh yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:Go ahead and take the guy's side, jackie.
OTHERMALE:Okay, what about uh "baby, baby, don't get hooked on me," remember that? He tells her that he'll use her and then he'll just set her free.
OTHERMALE:Use me, i'll set you on fire, you bastard.
LEADMALE:So all of our songs couldn't have sucked.
SUPMALE:What about all those sweet guys, like donovan and jim croce and the beatles? Yeah, the beatles were good.
LEADMALE:Remember they had that song, "run for your life" though? remember that song, "run for your life," the beatles? It goes, "he'd rather see her dead than to be with another man.
LEADMALE:" that's all them wife beaters need is an anthem.
LEADMALE:All our music was guy music.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Never did hear a lot of women on the radio, you know? Till janis.
SUPMALE:Oh well, thank god for janis.
LEADMALE:You know, i also "learned the truth at 17.
LEADFEMALE:" not janis ian, you idiot.
SUPMALE:Janis joplin.
SUPMALE:I like that one, when linda ronstadt came out with that song "different drum.
LEADMALE:" that was cool, yeah.
LEADMALE:'cause for once it says about the girl leaving the relationship.
OTHERFEMALE:You know who was really tough? Pat benatar.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:And joan jett.
SUPMALE:Chrissie hynde.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, chrissie, yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait wait wait.
OTHERFEMALE:I know we have this tape, patti smith.
LEADMALE:Remember? I got it.
OTHERMALE:Which? People have the power people have the power would you look at-look at that.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at that idiot trucker with the naked-woman mud flaps.
OTHERMALE:That makes me mad.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna get mud flaps with a guy with a great big beer gut hanging on it.
SUPFEMALE:That's gross.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, jackie! Look at the bumper sticker: save the whales-harpoon a fat chick.
OTHERMALE:Pull up to him, jackie! We'll show him a little "bikini kill.
SUPFEMALE:" i'm there, sister.
LEADFEMALE:Hey hey.
LEADMALE:So what? It's only the most perfectlyshaped women for you, you big, hairy, toothless, sweaty, cross-eyed hog.
LEADMALE:Man: hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, show me your boobs! what's he doing? He's flipping us off back! man, he's-women rule, dirtbag! crazy-man: hey! there's a motel at the next exit! kiss my fat chick-if you could get your fat -out of the car! Hey stupid, your lane ends in 10'.
LEADMALE:I'll show you 10 feet! Oh my god.
SUPFEMALE:Oh my god, he clipped the utility pole.
SUPMALE:What do i-do we stop and exchange name and numbers? This is no time to try to get a date, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Floor it! Damn, i can't call dan.
LEADMALE:The phone's dead.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe what you did.
OTHERMALE:What did i do? I had an honest, intellectual discussion with a trucker.
LEADMALE:We made him veer off the road! Oh my god, they found us.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the heat, it's the fuzz, it's the man.
SUPFEMALE:Man, they found us fast.
LEADMALE:Too bad we didn't call them, then we'd still have another 15 minutes to work with.
LEADFEMALE:They're coming over here.
LEADFEMALE:Now let's get our story straight.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we were at mcdonald's, you had the quarter pounder and cato had the filet o' fish.
LEADFEMALE:Is there a problem here, ladies? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:I just had to pull over to-i nurse my baby.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Well, we just got word that a car that fits this description was involved in an incident with a big rig.
LEADMALE:It seems that someone made an obscene gesture to the driver, causing him to veer off the road and smash into a utility pole.
LEADFEMALE:Does that sound familiar? as someone who has worn the steel shield herself, i can assure you that there is nothing more to talk about here, is there? You mean, other than your involvement in the incident.
SUPMALE:Hey, do we look like the kind of women that would flip off a trucker? Okay, we do, but it wasn't us, i swear.
SUPMALE:Lucky for you nobody got hurt, but this is serious business.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why don't we discuss it right after i switch sides here? okay, well, it seems that you two have learned your lesson, so why don't you just promise me you'll drive straight home, okay? Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:We won't even stop at the stop signs! You know, i admire the way you cops get up, hit those streets every morning taking on those bloodthirsty crazy maniacs out there.
SUPMALE:That's nothing compared to going home to my wife every night.
SUPFEMALE:Mark, i don't want you to get the wrong idea.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't trade a minute of my time with mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:And when you're old and beaten down, you'll get to say the same thing.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but what keeps you going? what do you look forward to? About once every you get to spend a peaceful hour alone.
SUPFEMALE:I guess i'll give it another shot with becky and i'll give you your hour and all.
LEADMALE:Thank a lot, mark.
LEADMALE:I'll do the same for you when your hour comes up.
LEADFEMALE:Hot dogs, armour hot dogs what kind of kids eat armour hot dogs? Well, fat kids, skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks tough kids, sissy kids, even kids with chicken pox love hot dogs-i'm back.
SUPMALE:So soon? what do you mean so soon? It's almost 9:00.
OTHERMALE:Not on the west coast.
LEADMALE:Get back out there.
OTHERFEMALE:So how'd it go out there? Well, if the cops don't show up in the next half hour, pretty good.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at him.
LEADMALE:He's sleeping like a like a baby.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's where that comes from.
LEADMALE:What went on around here tonight? Oh, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I just had to teach mark how to handle becky.
LEADFEMALE:Handle becky? It's not like she's a sports car, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Men don't handle women, okay? That's one of the things that's gonna change around here.
LEADFEMALE:What went on on the road? There's a revolution out there we didn't even know about.
SUPFEMALE:It's about women taking control, you know? It's about being a riot girl.
LEADFEMALE:The oil light went on, didn't it? No.
LEADFEMALE:A wake-up call went off and i heard it loud and clear.
LEADMALE:I had a hot dog an armour hot dog i wish i woulda ate my armour hot dog 
SUPFEMALE: i'm sick of turkey for thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:Yeah, how come it always has to be turkey? where does that come from? You have to start cooking it on labor day to get it ready for thanksgiving.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's just get a ham.
SUPFEMALE:It comes already cooked.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think that sits too well with the boys.
OTHERMALE:How about a pot roast? Boring! All right, it's gonna be turkey.
LEADFEMALE:Jerry garcia wants turkey, don't you? 'cause he knows turkey's tradition.
SUPMALE:'cause it costs like 5¢ a ton.
LEADMALE:So, we need yams and cranberries yeah, so they can match the stains from last year's tablecloth.
SUPMALE:Now to recap the list-oh, and what kind of rolls do you want? do you want the kind that shrivel when they burn or the kind that burst into flames? Well, flames are more fun for the kids.
LEADMALE:And holidays are for children.
OTHERFEMALE:All right then.
LEADMALE:We have the flaming rolls, check.
LEADMALE:Salad, check.
LEADMALE:Sodas, check.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, would you get me some earplugs too? so i don't have to listen to darlene gripe about the slaughter of innocent turkeys? Thanksgiving gets on my nerves.
SUPFEMALE:Big time.
OTHERMALE:It's like you finally get your weight down to something comfortable, and boom, it's thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Family you can't stand visits from out of town.
OTHERFEMALE:You gotta pretend you like 'em.
SUPFEMALE:Then of course mom starts guzzling the chardonnay.
LEADMALE:Everybody sits around seeing who can tell the biggest lie.
SUPMALE:And it starts with mom and the pies.
LEADFEMALE:She says that she bakes them and everyone knows that she buys them because they don't even fit in the pan.
LEADMALE:I think thanksgiving's just a man's holiday anyhow.
SUPFEMALE:Wait wait, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I want these guys to hear that.
LEADMALE:Because maybe we can save 'em if we catch 'em while they're young.
LEADMALE:Oh, you don't have anything worry about, jackie, 'cause they're gonna be side by side with their mommies in the kitchen helping cook up a great big feast.
LEADMALE:Amen.
SUPFEMALE:You tell it, sister.
LEADFEMALE:You know, men invented football just so they could get out of doing the dishes.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:And they claim that it's a tradition.
LEADFEMALE:A tradition, all right-us slaving over the hot stove serving the meal and then cleaning up the sink full of dirty dishes after.
SUPMALE:Yes, and then the men get to pass out and eat all they want and collapse watching the dallas cheerleaders.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, so to recap the holiday: we've got mom gettin' tipsy lying about the pies, cheap yams that have to be topped with marshmallows to move 'em at all, darlene gripin' about meat, and the men passing out in front of the of tv, everybody else getting in a huge fight.
OTHERFEMALE:All in all, it's not a bad holiday.
LEADMALE:Well, mr.
SUPMALE:Turkey, tomorrow's the big day! We'll roast you up, set you on a platter and then we'll be the ones going "gobble gobble gobble!" get it? Well, you had to cut off his head and pluck him and truss him, but you finally found an audience.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, chief.
OTHERFEMALE:Have fun at your thanksgiving pageant.
LEADMALE:Yeah, break a leg.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't feel bad you can't come.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's my fault.
OTHERMALE:I really should have told you sooner.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
LEADMALE:D.j. , there's something i have to tell you.
LEADMALE:What? We are coming! get your coat, dan! done! no way! I mean, you're just gonna embarrass me.
LEADFEMALE:Like the time you drank that kid's pop at the science fair.
SUPMALE:How was i supposed to know he was dissolving coins at the bottom? Besides, it bumped you up to honorable mention.
LEADMALE:But what about the baby? There's not a babysitter dumb enough in town to come to this house.
OTHERMALE:Luckily for you, your dear sweet grandmother volunteered to babysit.
LEADFEMALE:I like my other grandma better! Suck up all you want, d.j. , but we're still going.
LEADMALE:Come on! I mean, this is really important to me.
LEADMALE:I mean, we've been rehearsing for months.
LEADMALE:I mean, it would mean so much to me if you didn't come.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, deej.
SUPFEMALE:But other kids have to deal with disappointments like this.
LEADMALE:It's about time you learned that we won't be able to miss all your school events.
SUPFEMALE:But we will try our best to skip your graduation.
LEADMALE:Come on, deej, it could be worse.
OTHERMALE:Someone you really hate could be coming.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, someone like nice skirt, loser.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:This day couldn't get any worse.
LEADFEMALE:"x" thanks for the "x-files" that we watch.
LEADFEMALE:"y" thanks for "you" who came to see us.
LEADMALE:"z" thanks for the "z"s that dad catches on the couch.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the alphabet that only has 26 letters.
LEADMALE:We're done.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you just missed my eye.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a little off today.
LEADFEMALE:This is the dullest thanksgiving program ever.
OTHERFEMALE:We're definitely bringing liquor to the christmas pageant.
SUPMALE:Sorry i'm late.
SUPFEMALE:What'd i miss? The knicks against the celtics and "n.
SUPFEMALE:Y.
LEADMALE:P.
SUPFEMALE:D.
SUPFEMALE:Blue.
LEADMALE:" oh, you mean here.
OTHERFEMALE:You didn't save me a seat.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, could you move over one seat? Oh, i'm not getting up.
LEADFEMALE:This ought to be good, she looks like a bleeder.
LEADFEMALE:If i were you i'd get up.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's good to be back in the old auditorium.
SUPMALE:Those drama classes were some of my sweetest memories.
SUPMALE:There's nothing like the rush of an ensemble, young artists honing their crafts.
LEADMALE:You know, jackie, all you did was pull the curtain up and down.
OTHERFEMALE:"all i did!" man over p.
SUPFEMALE:A.
OTHERMALE:: good evening, everyone.
LEADMALE:Our last presentation of the evening comes from the 9th-grade history class.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you enjoy it.
LEADMALE:The great river flows.
OTHERFEMALE:The mighty wind howls.
LEADFEMALE:Let me take you back-back to a time when the harvest was bountiful and the sun shone brightly across the peaceful native plains.
LEADFEMALE:Curtain went up way too fast.
SUPMALE:Not smooth at all.
LEADFEMALE:Jerky.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe the curtain-puller found out that you were in the audience and just freaked under the pressure.
OTHERFEMALE:My father, we have prepared vast amounts of food.
OTHERFEMALE:Surely it is more than our group needs.
LEADMALE:You are right, running deer.
LEADFEMALE:Let us invite the strangers from across the big water to join us, for they have no food themselves.
LEADMALE:Bring on our brothers from faraway land, they who call themselves saints, to join us and celebrate the great harvest.
OTHERFEMALE:Welcome, brothers.
LEADMALE:Share in our bountiful feast.
LEADMALE:Looks like there's not enough seats at the table.
SUPFEMALE:Then we shall make more benches.
LEADMALE:Nah.
SUPFEMALE:Let's make some dead indians! stop! We invited you here in peace and harmony.
LEADMALE:Looks like we're gonna have to get medieval on this savage.
LEADMALE:Pow! all right, d.j. , way to die! all right! I'd like to introduce our teacher mr.
LEADFEMALE:Hill.
LEADMALE:So, how long you been pulling the old curtain? This was my first time.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't mean to be rough, but it shows.
LEADFEMALE:You mind if i give you a couple of pointers? Uh, actually-you want to develop a smooth, fluid rhythm.
OTHERMALE:Don't pull the curtain up, let the curtain pull you down.
LEADMALE:And that way you can take a piece of that applause for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I am so proud of you, son.
OTHERFEMALE:You died real good! That was really a cool play, d.j. and i'm not just saying that because it's the only play i've ever seen.
LEADMALE:Hey, mom! people are watching! I've been there, deej.
LEADMALE:Safest thing to do is just go limp.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez! God, roseanne, could you believe how horrible that play was? what are you talking about? I give it two thumbs up.
LEADFEMALE:And a couple other fingers too.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i'm just sorry i let my son be in it.
LEADMALE:It was nothing but violent propaganda.
OTHERMALE:Hey, the play was violent because that's the way everything was back then.
SUPMALE:Or don't you rent videotapes? did i hear you just defending that? do you know what that was? Drivel.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah! Drivel and tripe.
LEADFEMALE:Revisionist drivel and tripe.
SUPFEMALE:And that's the worst kind.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe that you guys still believe all the stuff they taught us in high school.
OTHERMALE:Man, i'm just glad i was out in the smoking area the whole time.
SUPMALE:Listen, believing that stuff in those history books is what got me where i am today-assistant director of sales for the midwest division of mohawk mutual and life.
SUPMALE:Look, american history comes down to a couple of words-people came here for the freedom.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me? Yeah, well uh all i'm just saying is that i don't want my tax money going towards this kind of violence in school.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, violence is the only truth that can cleanse the corrupt bourgeois establishment of its hypocrisy and inequality.
LEADMALE:That's communist talk! No, that's college talk.
SUPMALE:Her first shift selling lawn furniture at wal-mart will cool her off.
LEADMALE:So, did you folks all enjoy the play? Oh, i thought it was great.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i thought it was pretty cool.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for your support.
SUPMALE:You know, but some of the people here are kind of upset because the story doesn't seem to agree with the thanksgiving story they read on the butterball wrapper.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:But it just so happens that my great great great grandmother was an authentic both: cherokee princess.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:There's no such thing as a princess among native people.
SUPMALE:You are so busted.
SUPFEMALE:And your roots are brown.
LEADMALE:You've got to admit those pilgrims were brave.
SUPMALE:They came over here and discovered america.
OTHERMALE:How can they discover america if my people already lived there? You know, that's like me going outside and discovering someone else's porch.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's like the time my husband shimmied up the telephone pole and discovered cable.
SUPFEMALE:I thought it was pretty cool, you know? But i have to tell you, i will never laugh at "f-troop" again no matter how funny that larry storch is.
LEADMALE:Don't even get me started on "f-troop.
LEADMALE:" i mean, i've never seen an indian person ever go woo-woo-woo-woo-woo! You know, i've seen drunk rednecks do it a lot.
LEADMALE:You know, the pilgrims came here because of a religious conflict.
LEADFEMALE:And now there's still a religious conflict.
LEADFEMALE:Catholics are upset with my people because we stole their most sacred ceremony bingo.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you about the real thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:This is what happened: you see, a long time ago when my people met the pilgrims, they called themselves saints.
LEADFEMALE:English people sure love to give themselves titles.
LEADMALE:My father, we have prepared vast amounts of food.
SUPFEMALE:Surely it is more than we need.
SUPMALE:You're right, my son.
LEADMALE:Let's invite our brothers from across the big water.
OTHERFEMALE:They who call themselves the pilgrims, to join us in a feast of thanks for giving.
LEADMALE:Come, my brothers.
SUPMALE:You're welcome.
OTHERMALE:Who's elk horn do i have to blow to get something to eat around here? Hill: it's true the pilgrims were starving and we fed them.
SUPFEMALE:We also taught them how to grow corn and how to survive.
SUPFEMALE:And we could have taught them so much more, but they stopped listening because what we had to say didn't go along with how they thought men and women should be.
LEADMALE:I saw ye! Thou was having impure thoughts.
OTHERMALE:For shame! No, i-i was not.
LEADMALE:I was-i was just-yeah, i was.
SUPFEMALE:Now, son, thou knowest what this means.
LEADMALE:Grab ye a switch and flog thyself.
SUPMALE:I get impure thoughts when i do that too.
SUPMALE:Listen here, young man.
SUPMALE:Let me explaineth it for you.
LEADFEMALE:You see male-female interactions they are but for one purpose only-the production of children.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, i've heard it is nothing to be enjoyed.
LEADFEMALE:Not if it's done right.
LEADFEMALE:Luckily, i'm barren so my husband and i have never been forced to have sex.
LEADMALE:Praise be to god.
LEADMALE:Both: amen.
SUPMALE:Yay.
LEADFEMALE:Praise be to god.
LEADMALE:Yes, i understand now.
SUPMALE:I will go flog myself.
OTHERMALE:These people have no lawyers, guns or money.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
OTHERMALE:There's nothing to stop us from making this our own golf course.
LEADMALE:They have strong backs, they'll maketh fine caddies.
LEADFEMALE:Here, come and enjoy our bounty.
LEADFEMALE:Bounty "the quicker picker upper.
SUPMALE:" what a bunch of buckle heads.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you sit at the table with the men? Nix nix.
SUPFEMALE:We are trying to keep their weight down for the swimsuit portion of the miss pilgrim competition.
LEADMALE:We waiteth our turn and happily pick off their bones.
LEADFEMALE:The men always eat first.
SUPFEMALE:But there's enough food for everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, chief, chief.
LEADFEMALE:The system worketh.
SUPMALE:Watch.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dear! Go waiteth thou in the woods until i have finished eating.
LEADMALE:When i am finished, i will call thee.
SUPMALE:Yes, husband.
LEADMALE:To the system.
OTHERMALE:Men: to the system! Don't you knock? Sorry.
LEADMALE:Come in, young one.
LEADMALE:Nice hut.
LEADMALE:I've been watching you and your people and she would not approve of imbalance of your spirit.
SUPMALE:She? she who? Our mother earth.
LEADFEMALE:The earth is a woman? No, that's nothing but heathen talk.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you how the world works.
SUPFEMALE:There is one god.
SUPMALE:He's in heaven sitting on a throne so he can damn everything.
LEADFEMALE:The end.
LEADFEMALE:Daughter, sit.
OTHERFEMALE:I have much to tell you.
SUPFEMALE:Heaven and earth are the same.
SUPMALE:Man exists with woman.
LEADMALE:He's part of woman.
OTHERFEMALE:Woman gives life to man.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot understand what you're talking about.
LEADMALE:Well, you should understand.
LEADFEMALE:You're a woman.
SUPMALE:Women give life like the earth does.
OTHERMALE:You thought all this up while you were just sitting here in this hut? Well, i get out some.
LEADFEMALE:The occasional walk, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Dan: rose anne! we art leaving! I don't know what to do.
OTHERMALE:I would love to stay here and learn more from you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then buy my cassettes in the lobby.
LEADMALE:Dan: rose anne! Who is that? That's my husband, newton gingrinch conner.
LEADFEMALE:The three sisters are beans, squash and corn.
LEADFEMALE:And? And they knew if they planted them all together they would grow taller.
LEADFEMALE:And? And i hate having my teacher over for thanksgiving! Well, this has been great.
SUPMALE:Yeah, especially since we invited you and you brought all the food.
SUPFEMALE:I'll say.
SUPMALE:What are you doing next year? Well, you made that delicious turkey.
SUPMALE:All i can say is thanks for giving.
LEADMALE:This may be a little late, but on behalf of the pilgrims, thanks for feeding us.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for helping us to understand more about your culture.
SUPMALE:But your people are doing a lot better now what with the casinos and the cigarettes.
LEADFEMALE:Well said, mrs.
LEADMALE:Harris.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, mr.
LEADMALE:Hill.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? why don't we do the friendship dance? friendship dance? uh, floyd? Well i just happened to bring my drum here.
LEADMALE:The drum is the heartbeat.
SUPMALE:I usually don't dance till after the last call, so you'll have to lead.
OTHERMALE:Here, i'll show you.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody leads.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody leads.
LEADMALE:Hey, i get it.
SUPFEMALE:This is like that jewish dance, the hora.
SUPMALE:And the hokey-pokey! One people.
LEADMALE:We do this at the senior center! This is called "the laughing song.
SUPFEMALE:" and it's for you, little buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Yay!
SUPFEMALE: oh, dan, tell roseanne i borrowed the double boiler, not the stew pot, and the ladle, not the slotted spoon, okay? you want me to write that down? Jackie was here took stuff.
SUPMALE:Got it.
LEADMALE:Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm serious, because roseanne might need the ladle and i just want her to know that i have it, okay? Jackie has the ladle.
LEADMALE:We have a ladle? Hey, i knew it, i knew it.
SUPMALE:There's still one credit card company willing to take a gamble on us.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, melanie mcphee, customer relations, you're about to lose your job.
LEADFEMALE:And she so looked forward to working with us.
LEADFEMALE:Hey hey hey.
SUPMALE:Ray wilson sent us two tickets to come and see him play in chicago.
OTHERMALE:Stingray wilson, wow.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Man, did you even know he was back in town? Yes, i have heard something to that effect.
LEADMALE:Oh, those were good times when you used to play for him.
OTHERMALE:Not for him, with him.
SUPFEMALE:Some people thought i carried him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Like ringo carried john, paul and george.
LEADFEMALE:I held my own with him, didn't i, rosie? yeah, remember that time you guys played the county fairgrounds? You rocked that place.
LEADFEMALE:That was after i left the band.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well then who the hell was i making out with after the show? you know what, dan? I'm starting to remember now and you were good.
LEADMALE:You were really good-really really good.
SUPMALE:Don't patronize me, jackie, because i really was good.
LEADMALE:Rosie, you remember those gigs we played at the sportsman's lodge? We packed that joint five weekends in a row.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i remember you would have had six, but the owner bumped you guys for that wrestling bear.
SUPFEMALE:You were in a band? yes, is that so hard to believe? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:A little, 'cause-no, sir.
SUPMALE:Hey, d.j. , what do you got there? Mice.
LEADFEMALE:Ho ho.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys.
LEADMALE:Oh, d.j. , they're great.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing with these cute little fellas? I'm bringing them to sell to the research lab.
OTHERFEMALE:What? I'm raking it in too.
SUPFEMALE:Look, last batch got me this watch.
LEADFEMALE:D.j. , it's blood money and it's wrong.
LEADMALE:I think your parents should know about this.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wait wait wait.
SUPFEMALE:Now what would it take to keep you quiet about this? you're trying to buy me off? You know, darlene's birthday is coming up.
SUPMALE:You could probably use a little extra cash.
SUPMALE:I don't need it that bad.
LEADMALE:I'll just get her something nice and simple with the money i do have.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, darlene's pretty understanding.
LEADFEMALE:Remember last year when all you did was give her a ride into the country? now exactly how long did it take you to walk back from the country? Mice do eat a lot of really fatty foods, like cheese, so they probably wouldn't live that long anyway.
LEADMALE:Yeah, okay, whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see here.
SUPMALE:This ought to about cover it.
LEADFEMALE:Here, put a nice pretty bow on it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm trying really hard not to notice that you're sending me some nonverbal message.
LEADFEMALE:That or you've got rabies.
LEADMALE:Okay, fine, you want to get into this? Jackie made that comment about ringo.
LEADMALE:It made me feel like a complete idiot.
LEADMALE:You were standing right there and you didn't even come to my defense.
LEADMALE:I gave her a dirty look.
LEADMALE:You call that defending me? It wasn't just any dirty look, dan.
SUPFEMALE:It was my combination nostril flare, lip curl and half a squint.
LEADFEMALE:Go spit.
LEADFEMALE:If you think i'm talented, say it.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're talented.
LEADFEMALE:You're just saying that.
LEADFEMALE:God, your old singing buddy comes back into town and now you're acting like your whole life has been a big mistake.
SUPMALE:Not my whole life, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so it's my fault, right? I had to make a choice.
LEADFEMALE:You made me feel like if i went on the road with ray, you wouldn't be there when i got back.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't about joining a band, dan.
LEADFEMALE:You're using that as some excuse to avoid what's really going on here.
SUPFEMALE:What's really going on here? do the words "midlife crisis" mean anything to you? You are making no sense.
LEADMALE:Yes, i am, dan.
LEADMALE:You are the very same age my dad was when he took up with that mistress.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Maybe i should check and see if his mistress is still available.
SUPMALE:Well, i think enough has been said here.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:You mean we're both actually going to sleep in our bed? Yes, if there's room.
SUPMALE:You win.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Hello.
LEADMALE:David, you've got to help me.
LEADMALE:A couple of the mice got loose.
SUPMALE:If my mom finds out, she's gonna kill me.
SUPMALE:If two mice live and one little boy is killed, justice has been served.
SUPMALE:Hmm.
LEADMALE:I wonder what animal rights activist darlene would think when she found out that you drove me down to that lab with those mice.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't tell her.
LEADFEMALE:"darlene, he just sat in the car counting his money while his furry friends were butchered.
LEADFEMALE:" i've got to get my own place.
SUPMALE:Hey, how many is a couple of mice? You know, you both can't be the horsie at the same time.
LEADMALE:Morning, jackie.
SUPMALE:Yikes.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys aren't talking to each other, are you? Wow, your powers of observation never cease to astound me.
SUPFEMALE:No, actually, dan thinks that i ruined his life.
LEADFEMALE:Because of me, he did not get to pursue his great dream of being the king of rock 'n' roll! I did not stop dan from being a musician.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, i could've stopped him if i wanted to but i didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Did i? Of course you didn't.
OTHERMALE:Did you? i mean, did dan ever once stop and think that maybe i gave up some of my dreams too? Yes! When you were eight you wanted to be a magician.
LEADMALE:And then you wanted to be the flying nun for a while.
LEADFEMALE:Well, who didn't? Okay, i'm gonna get going.
LEADMALE:Just give me the tickets and i'll get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:What tickets? The tickets to see ray wilson play.
LEADMALE:You gave her our tickets? Hey, you guys are talking again.
SUPMALE:No, i didn't just give her the tickets.
LEADMALE:She had to promise to help me throw all your crap out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i still want to go, and i'm going.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you are going, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:So then, looks like it's just you and me, big guy.
LEADMALE:Or actually why don't you just go on your own? And you have a good time, pal.
LEADFEMALE:You probably should cut down on your salt, dan.
LEADFEMALE:That's what killed elvis.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, guys, what are we looking for? Well, if you don't tell anybody-mice.
OTHERMALE:Oh, god.
SUPMALE:Okay, well.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck to you both.
OTHERFEMALE:I found them.
LEADMALE:Really? Cool! No no, not cool.
OTHERFEMALE:Cats.
LEADMALE:Lots of cats.
LEADFEMALE:Cats eating mice.
LEADFEMALE:It's a killing field out there.
LEADMALE:My business is ruined! That serves you right, d.j. .
LEADMALE:What you were doing was wrong, and you were forced to stop.
LEADMALE:While i mourn for those little mice, those cats may have done you a big favor.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:The lab pays $1/lb for cats.
OTHERMALE:Here, kitty kitty kitty! Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot.
OTHERMALE:We're taking a little break.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be right back.
SUPFEMALE:But remember the more you drink, the better we sing.
SUPMALE:Oh man, i love the blues.
LEADMALE:I got to hang out in blues clubs more often.
SUPFEMALE:No you shouldn't, jackie, you would just depress people.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not kidding, my life is the blues.
SUPFEMALE:I've been chewed up, spit out, rode hard and put away wet.
OTHERMALE:If it wasn't for bad luck, i'd have no luck at all.
LEADMALE:Da da da da.
LEADFEMALE:Oh my god.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, jackie.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Hey! Great to see you.
LEADFEMALE:You too.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:I thought i saw dan here.
LEADMALE:How are you two doing? Oh, we're kind of having a fight.
SUPMALE:It's not that same one you had no, it's a different one.
OTHERMALE:Of course, that one's not over yet either.
LEADMALE:So, stingray there's something that i've always meant to clear up.
LEADFEMALE:You know when you asked me out and i told you i had a cold? I've always felt kind of bad about that.
LEADMALE:That's okay, there's no hard feelings.
LEADFEMALE:I just feel kind of bad.
LEADFEMALE:You must've really been hurting 'cause you went and wrote that whole song about it and everything.
OTHERFEMALE:What song? You know, "run around," you know.
LEADMALE:When i saw through the voice of a trusted friend who needed to humor me and tell me lies i really did have a cold.
LEADMALE:Uh, jackie? That song's not about you.
LEADMALE:I think it is, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Tell her, ray.
LEADMALE:It's not about you, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, so-good.
LEADMALE:Never really cared for that song anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry about her, she's out of her mind.
LEADMALE:She thinks that song "gloria" is about her, too.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, this feels like old times.
LEADMALE:Us backstage at a gig, jackie all hyper, you and dan fighting.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, this fight's kind of your fault.
LEADFEMALE:You come back to town a big star and now dan's old rock 'n' roll dreams are keeping him up at night.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, that and me hitting him.
OTHERMALE:We've been pretty lucky, what with the kids and everything like that.
LEADMALE:And we have a lot of laughs together, but it's not the most exciting life and i think dan's starting to feel it.
SUPMALE:The grass is always greener, you know? He'll get over it.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know, he's pretty down.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you don't think that back then that i wasn't supportive about the music, do you? all right, then what about the other one? god, i want to touch you in the place you want to hide now that song was about me, wasn't it? Yeah, sure, okay.
LEADMALE:I knew it, i knew it, this is so embarrassing.
SUPMALE:I've got to get back out there.
LEADMALE:Don't worry so much, roseanne.
SUPMALE:Stand and walk stand! Thank you.
SUPMALE:I want to do this next number with my old buddy dan conner.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see if we can get him up here.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, come on.
SUPMALE:Oh god, i hope he makes it through this.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it, jackie, he'll be great.
LEADMALE:Come on baby, don't you wanna go? oh, come on baby, don't you wanna go? back to the same old place sweet home chicago oh, come on baby, don't you wanna go? i said come on baby, don't you wanna go? well, to the same old place sweet home chicago well, one and one is two six and two is eight come on, baby now don't you be late hidey-hey baby, don't you wanna go? back to the same old place sweet home chicago come on baby, don't you wanna go? i said come on baby, don't you wanna go? Back to the same old tale sweet home chicago.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Put your hands together for dan conner.
SUPFEMALE:You know, dan used to be in the band, but he split 'cause he found a better gig, and that better gig's over there.
OTHERFEMALE:Take a bow, rosie.
SUPMALE:Oh god, i bet i'm next.
LEADMALE:It's good to see two friends who really got it together and love each other a lot.
SUPMALE:And dan you've got a great gig.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, that was my buddy dan conner singing up there.
LEADFEMALE:Best man at my wedding.
OTHERFEMALE:Came here in the same car.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, rosie, join us.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, bob, leave us.
SUPMALE:So, uh, you like what you heard? Yeah, you know i've always been your biggest fan.
LEADFEMALE:I was thinking about it, and maybe it is true.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe i did hold you back.
SUPMALE:You didn't hold me back.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have that much power over me.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, you didn't have that much power over me.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted to be with you.
LEADMALE:I'm not your dad.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i know.
LEADMALE:Oh, once upon a midnight dearie i woke with something in my head i couldn't escape the memory of a phone call and what you said suck it in, suck it in if you're rin tin tin or anne boleyn make a desperate move or else you'll win and then begin to see what you're doing this m.
LEADFEMALE:T.
LEADMALE:V.
SUPMALE:Is not for free, it's so p.
LEADMALE:C.
SUPMALE:It's killing me so desperately i'll sing to thee of love sure, but also rage and hate and pain and fear of self and i can't keep these feelings on the shelf i've tried, well, no, in fact i lied could be financial suicide but i've got too much pride inside to hide or slide i'll do as i'll decide and let it ride until i've died and only then shall i abide by this tide of catchy little tunes of hip three-minute ditties i wanna bust all your balloons, i wanna burn all of your cities to the ground, i've found i will not mess around unless i play, then hey, i will go on all day hear what i say, i have a prayer to pray, that's really all this was when i'm feeling stuck and need a buck, i don't rely on luck because the hook brings you back i ain't telling you no lie the hook ooh ooh, yeah on that you can rely.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:1 what would you think about revisiting "roseanne"? Yes, yes, i'm in.
OTHERMALE:I no longer attempt to stab people when i'm angry with them.
LEADMALE:We answer it, all the questions people have asked me for 20 years.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to see what the connors were up to in 2018.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't believe we were sitting there reading these characters.
LEADFEMALE:In front of the set.
LEADFEMALE:It was the absolute first thing i had ever done.
LEADMALE:29 years ago, you're talking about.
LEADMALE:Laurie said something to me, like, i don't know what i'm doing.
LEADFEMALE:And i was like, well, if laurie doesn't know what she's doing, then it's a mess.
SUPMALE:Roseanne hates the script.
LEADFEMALE:The writer hates roseanne.
SUPMALE:I wanted total control.
LEADFEMALE:Her name is on the freaking thing.
SUPMALE:The show was tapping into something that other shows weren't.
LEADFEMALE:Some of the fun stuff was dan and roseanne and jackie getting high.
SUPMALE:It still cracks me up every time i see it.
LEADMALE:All right, listen up, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:I got an important announcement to make.
SUPFEMALE:You're a woman trapped in a man's body? Sharon stone.
LEADFEMALE:Toby mcguire.
LEADMALE:Leo dicaprio was on.
SUPMALE:He was a doll.
SUPMALE:Am i allowed to say that? I hope you don't show that clip.
OTHERFEMALE:Feels like such a time warp.
LEADMALE:Like being home again.
LEADFEMALE:"roseanne: the return.
SUPFEMALE:" here's our host, joy behar.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:It was a sitcom originally called "life and stuff" and that's exactly what america saw, every day family life, headed by a mother unlike anything tv had ever seen.
LEADMALE:A brassy comic taking on the hottest topics in the funniest way imaginable.
OTHERMALE:Hey, sounds familiar.
LEADMALE:Now, she's back with the rest of the connor crew, and no doubt, the new "roseanne" will be as groundbreaking and funny as ever.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm on my way to the set of the "roseanne" show for the "roseanne" show reboot.
LEADMALE:It's been 20 years.
LEADMALE:I'm so happy to see you! It's pretty amazing.
LEADFEMALE:It's very exciting, but it's very emotionally overwhelming.
LEADMALE:Am i ready yet? It's september 2017 and it's a family reunion.
SUPFEMALE:You look great! Ah, baloney.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne and the rest of her cast mates are gathering to read through the script.
OTHERFEMALE:The name of the number one script, 20 years to life.
LEADFEMALE:Not bad for a one-time struggling comic who forelayed her unique take on family life into a life changing appearance on the tonight show.
LEADMALE:She's a housewife from denver, colorado.
SUPFEMALE:Oh my god, i was anything but relaxed.
OTHERFEMALE:Being funny on tonight show made your career if you were a comic.
OTHERMALE:Getting on the tonight show was the thing that every comic in los angeles was desperate to do.
LEADFEMALE:And this is her very first appearance on national television.
SUPFEMALE:Would you welcome, roseanne barr.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne? I thought i was going to fall over.
LEADMALE:I'm obsessive, so, i must have done that seven-minute act, like a 150 times.
LEADMALE:I hate that word, housewife.
LEADMALE:I prefer to be called domestic goddess.
LEADFEMALE:It's very hard to understand how one spot on one show could make our break your career as a comedian.
LEADMALE:"the tonight show" was that spot.
SUPFEMALE:The carson spot leads to more work and more national exposure.
SUPMALE:What does it take to become successful and how tough it is for you, compared to men? i think it's harder to be a man comic are you? Oh yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Because they are generally not funny or intelligent.
OTHERMALE:Marcy carsey and tom werner meet up with roseanne and they get talking about the possibility of doing a sitcom that would focus on a character like the one roseanne talked about in her standup.
OTHERMALE:It started with an idea about how interesting it would be to portray a family in which the mom was a working mom.
LEADFEMALE:I was inexperienced as far as acting and but i was a big fan of sitcoms all my life and i always pretended that i had "the roseanne show.
LEADMALE:" marcy and i were developing this idea and we said, "well, you know what", "this may be a hard sell, actually.
LEADFEMALE:" even though we had "the cosby show" on television, which was the number one show.
OTHERFEMALE:Nbc passed on it and then we brought it to abc.
SUPFEMALE:So, they cast it, and the first thing they do is they get john goodman.
LEADMALE:They need to get people who are really good, because roseanne has no acting experience.
SUPMALE:All i knew about roseanne barr that she was a rising comedian, and she was on a pizza hut commercial.
LEADFEMALE:That's the only time i'd ever seen her.
SUPFEMALE:How about we take the kids out for pan pizza and you can eat at the salad bar? We hit it off from the very beginning.
LEADMALE:We kind of made each other laugh.
SUPMALE:And that's why i felt like i had the job as soon as i left the audition.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go broke tryin'to pay'em.
LEADFEMALE:We'll end up with a poor heart nobody else was ever considered.
OTHERFEMALE:We kind of bonded around making each other laugh and he has a working class background, too, so, i knew he was the guy, and as soon as i read with him, i knew we had a hit show.
SUPFEMALE:Feel this baby, there's a 200-point game pulsating through these fingers.
OTHERMALE:Let's not waste it on bowling.
LEADFEMALE:And then the next person they brought in was laurie metcalf to play the sister.
LEADFEMALE:I had a real heavy theater background.
SUPFEMALE:Zero tv.
SUPMALE:And i allowed myself two weeks to be in l.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADMALE:And during those two weeks, i happened to go on the roseanne audition.
SUPMALE:So, i was literally in the right place at the right time.
LEADFEMALE:Laurie was her tow truck driver.
LEADMALE:She'd nudge her into the marks and uh and then let her go.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i'd sort of steer her this way.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah i guess i was that, it's like a push here, push there.
LEADMALE:Then meeting the kids, we auditioned a lot of kids.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I was eating chinese food with my family and i opened a fortune cookie and it said, "you will be graced with the presence of stardom.
LEADMALE:" and then the phone rang and it was a callback for "roseanne.
LEADMALE:" come on, just answer my question.
LEADMALE:It's none of your business.
OTHERMALE:It is my business when you start sneaking out of this house to meet some guy that i would consider leaving your father for.
LEADFEMALE:I'd never been in an audition process before, other than like, for the school plays.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Michael came in, he was 6.
LEADFEMALE:He looked like my family.
SUPMALE:And he sits down, he goes, want to hear a joke? So, i'm like, yeah.
LEADMALE:So, i asked her, why did the turtle cross the road? I go, "i don't know.
SUPMALE:" and the punchline was, "chicken's day off.
LEADFEMALE:" chicken's day off.
SUPFEMALE:I go, you're hired.
LEADFEMALE:Mum, i finished folding the laundry.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:You're one of my three favorite kids.
LEADFEMALE:What about me? No.
OTHERFEMALE:It was the absolute first thing i had ever done.
LEADMALE:It was a life-changer.
LEADMALE:When i met the entire cast, i think we went to a howard johnson to have our first table read, and seeing the family trickle in was just so exciting.
LEADMALE:She started it.
SUPFEMALE:She started it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, we know who started it.
OTHERMALE:It was the first time i got this feeling, even though i was young, i just felt like, oh, we have something big here.
SUPMALE:They certainly did have something big here.
SUPFEMALE:A cast member who would later go on to become academy award-winner george clooney.
LEADMALE:We used to play basketball together.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he's that cute and charming and someone you want to pal around with in real life.
SUPMALE:George clooney was, you know, just the manager at a factory on a show and was a small character, and we all felt like he was magical and he was a great guy.
SUPFEMALE:All right, listen up, everybody.
SUPMALE:I got an important announcement to make.
OTHERFEMALE:You're a woman trapped in a man's body? On-set, the cast finds chemistry and comedy, but behind the scenes, there is drama, lots of it.
LEADFEMALE:The show that will soon return for its tenth season was once in real danger of never making it through the first.
LEADFEMALE:They knew they had something really special here, but they also had somebody who wasn't used to the rules of television and who was not going to be easy to work with.
LEADFEMALE:My feet hurt and i got periodic bouts of depression, but other than that, i'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if she told you this but, we were editing the pilot and roseanne called me up and i was just checking with her and i was saying how great the show was.
SUPMALE:And she said, "i'm not sure i want to do anymore episodes.
LEADFEMALE:" and i said what? Big trouble.
LEADMALE:The network wants to pull the plug, roseanne hates the script, the writer hates roseanne, it's a mess.
SUPFEMALE:And that will begin a high stakes battle between two very powerful people on this show roseanne barr, its star, matt williams, its creator and executive producer, that will never be resolved.
SUPFEMALE:We had big fights.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, we all were aware of that, yeah.
LEADMALE:I mean, we were right there.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne wanted him out.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne wanted control of the ship creatively.
LEADMALE:The tension was, you know, unbelievable.
LEADMALE:I remember he threw over a table and chairs and said, "i'm not a scribe"! She was promised a show to voice her point of view.
LEADFEMALE:And what was on the page at that point was really not that.
SUPFEMALE:The show premieres in october of 1988.
SUPFEMALE:As the cast watches the pilot, roseanne notices something is missing.
LEADMALE:Because that is the first time that roseanne barr sees the credit, "created by matt williams.
SUPFEMALE:" she believes that she is the creator of "roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:" ah! Roseanne had it tougher because, as a woman, coming into it, especially in those days, she really had to fight for the power.
LEADMALE:You were in the first year of "roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:" it was a big hit.
LEADFEMALE:You played what, her boss? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:The first season she wanted it to be a specific way.
OTHERMALE:Matt williams did not.
LEADFEMALE:And there was a big fight and she eventually asked matt to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Now, matt's a nice guy, and very talented.
LEADMALE:Roseanne was right.
LEADMALE:And so, that is the question.
SUPFEMALE:Is the show actually going to proceed without roseanne? People told me that he was keeping a list of all the offensive things i did, so that they could replace me, and it included included belching and things like that.
OTHERMALE:In the end, williams decides to leave the show over creative differences.
LEADFEMALE:Matt williams goes on to create "home improvement", with tim allen, which is hugely successful.
OTHERMALE:I knew i would have the last word and i always did.
LEADMALE:Well, she's around and matt's not.
SUPFEMALE:There you have it.
OTHERMALE:When we come back what? You're fired.
SUPFEMALE:From hot button topics on-set school's having a food drive for poor people.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, tell them to drive some of that food over here.
LEADFEMALE:To getting really steamed off-set.
LEADMALE:I made the sign that i put on my door, these are the people that will be fired when this show goes to number one.
LEADMALE:One year later, they were all gone.
LEADFEMALE:We continue now with more of "roseanne: the return.
LEADMALE:" she was the queen of abc, she was the queen of television.
LEADFEMALE:In no time at all, roseanne has become a smash hit.
LEADFEMALE:It's the number one show in the country, reaching a staggering 30 million viewers.
LEADFEMALE:And roseanne has creative control.
SUPMALE:When this show hits number one, the head of abc entertainment, he sends a chocolate cake to the show.
SUPFEMALE:They gave me a chocolate number one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, roseanne has heard, that when guys have number one shows, they don't get cakes.
LEADFEMALE:They get, like, maseratis.
LEADMALE:They get, like, ferrari's.
LEADMALE:And they gave me a chocolate number one.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:She feels it's disparagement.
LEADMALE:But once bob eiger got on abc, boy, they started upping the gifts, i'll tell you.
LEADMALE:You read my diary.
LEADMALE:I have to go to work.
SUPMALE:The question about roseanne was always, was she representing a new kind of person? was she this newly empowered woman who was taking on the old guard? or was she just like a tyrant, like anybody else was, firing men and women? I made the sign that i put on my door, these are the people that will be fired when this show goes to number one.
LEADMALE:And one year later, they were all gone.
SUPFEMALE:When i took the job, my agent and my lawyer said, she will fire you.
LEADMALE:She fires everyone after a year.
LEADMALE:And i said okay.
LEADMALE:They said, it's going to be a hell of a year.
LEADFEMALE:She fired me.
SUPFEMALE:If you're working for roseanne, she's not going to settle for much at all.
LEADMALE:And rightly so.
LEADMALE:Her name's on it, and it's her story.
SUPMALE:It's her real life.
SUPFEMALE:Being roseanne, it was not the calmest of places.
LEADMALE:So, you had to kind of be ready, on your feet.
SUPMALE:We were often changing stories last minute.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes it was, hey, i met joan collins.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i met joan collins at a party and i want joan collins to play my cousin, so, write her into the episode this week.
LEADMALE:That's a nice outfit.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:That's a nice place.
LEADFEMALE:It was a little crazy.
OTHERMALE:Oh hi arnie.
LEADMALE:Hey rosie, where is the "man of the house"? Tom arnold is put in the writer's room.
SUPFEMALE:And tom arnold is there, to make sure that roseanne's wishes are followed.
OTHERMALE:Tom arnold will enjoy many titles on this sitcom.
SUPMALE:Actor, writer, producer.
OTHERMALE:And perhaps most importantly, roseanne's real life husband.
OTHERMALE:It makes things tricky on the set.
LEADMALE:Roseanne taking up with tom arnold was a huge story.
LEADMALE:And all this is turning up in "people" magazine and all that stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:It's all a big topic of conversation.
LEADFEMALE:You are such a leech.
LEADFEMALE:There was always some drama going on every week that i was there.
SUPFEMALE:Wow! "roseanne" really did change things in tv.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, not june cleaver.
LEADFEMALE:She wasn't your typical housewife.
LEADMALE:Oh, let me do it, it's easier.
LEADFEMALE:She wasn't your typical actress with this voice that could be very piercing and grating.
SUPFEMALE:D.j. ! becky! dan, come here! Just that really blue-collar working class person.
LEADMALE:Us regular people, we're paying more taxes than the rich people because they got all the lawyers to figure out the loopholes.
LEADMALE:I want to figure out loopholes.
OTHERFEMALE:To represent working class, as the noble class in this country, that just hasn't been the point of view.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne was the first woman i saw on television that was rejecting the social construct of what femininity was supposed to be.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i always wanted to do a show that was complimentary to the viewers, who i felt were, you know, me when i was a little girl watching tv.
LEADMALE:Give me this damn thing.
SUPMALE:Make it about something that i can identify with, and she certainly did that.
OTHERFEMALE:In my culture, it was always a strong mother-based home with a loving husband and some problems and loudmouth kids, so, i wanted that.
OTHERMALE:Come on, mom.
SUPMALE:And of course they faced money issues.
LEADFEMALE:Our school's having a food drive for poor people.
SUPMALE:Well, them them to drive some of that food over here.
LEADMALE:It was a show where you could see people paying bills, or the lights being turned out, because we weren't able to pay all our bills.
OTHERMALE:Or the games roseanne would play, how to shuffle around the bills.
LEADFEMALE:First, we send in the phone bill and we forget to sign the check.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Then they send the water bill to the electric company and electric bill to the water company.
SUPMALE:Now you're cooking.
LEADFEMALE:And you know, that charge card bill, it never even showed up.
LEADFEMALE:That's what roseanne did over and over again.
OTHERFEMALE:She just constantly reinforced this idea that there were struggles to be had.
LEADFEMALE:What? You're fired.
LEADMALE:You don't have to have a sex just to have a boyfriend.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Look what i found in david's room when i was cleaning today.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man, that looks like pot.
LEADFEMALE:It's set up as a comedy.
LEADMALE:Everybody's loving it.
LEADFEMALE:First season and everybody's relating to it.
OTHERMALE:And now she starts introducing issues.
OTHERMALE:Dad, i'm real sorry that you died before i got to tell you some stuff.
SUPMALE:The birth control stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:It's time for me to um get some birth control.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:I think the episode, where d.j. doesn't want to kiss the girl in the play is kind of pivotal american television.
SUPMALE:I just don't want to kiss her.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Black people are just like us, they're every bit as good as us and any people who don't think so is just a bunch of banjo picking, cousin-dating, barefoot embarrassments to respectable white trash like us.
OTHERFEMALE:We dealt with domestic abuse with jackie's character and her boyfriend.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene says your back's all bruised up.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's nothing.
SUPMALE:Well, let me see.
OTHERFEMALE:No, don't.
LEADMALE:Don't.
LEADFEMALE:Just stop.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone was terrified of tackling that subject.
LEADMALE:Was it going to be too dark? was it going to turn people off, to watch that when they're turnded into sitcom? That son of a bitch.
OTHERMALE:You don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:He beat the crap out of you.
OTHERFEMALE:No, he didn't.
LEADFEMALE:It's no big deal.
SUPFEMALE:I came back to her and i said, "powers that be, are very concerned about this.
OTHERFEMALE:" don't want to do it.
SUPFEMALE:â she said, "we're doing it.
LEADMALE:â" i said, "okay, great.
LEADFEMALE:â" "roseanne was one of the first" people in that arena that said no, you know, this is it.
LEADMALE:It has to be this good all the time or i'm not going to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't say anymore.
LEADFEMALE:She was always willing to sacrifice some of the laughs in a sitcom for the depth, and i think people loved her for that reason.
SUPMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:They were in the comedy business.
SUPFEMALE:But it did give you an ongoing sense that this show was tapping into something that other shows weren't.
LEADFEMALE:And that's what made it special.
LEADFEMALE:Next o say can you see she's singing, she's kissing.
OTHERFEMALE:And we're dishing on the mystery of the two beckies.
LEADFEMALE:Where the hell have you been? I was surprised that they recast me.
LEADFEMALE:On the show, roseanne conner is struggling to make ends meet.
SUPMALE:That negative attitude of yours it's gonna get you nowhere.
OTHERMALE:This is nowhere.
SUPMALE:But in real life, roseanne barr is on top of world.
LEADMALE:The domestic goddess became a hollywood diva.
SUPFEMALE:The embodiment of white trash with money.
LEADMALE:Peek inside her home and you'll find a softer side of roseanne, as she showed my friend barbara walters.
OTHERFEMALE:Her kitchen is bathed in the yellow hue of monet's house in france.
LEADMALE:You're acting as if you are the woman who understands all the women, while you're living in a gorgeous house no.
LEADMALE:I'm the woman who has been screwed every single way a woman can be screwed and have lived through it.
LEADMALE:And survived it and pulled through and triumphed.
LEADFEMALE:Triumphed, she says.
LEADFEMALE:All the power jobs are taken.
LEADMALE:Margaret is running england.
LEADMALE:Ben is turning the letters over.
SUPMALE:Because while she's the star of a sitcom, her personal life with then-husband tom arnold is a soap opera.
SUPFEMALE:Her life outside of the show, it did spiral and spiral.
SUPMALE:Yet they would never expect the fallout from roseanne singing the national anthem at a baseball game.
LEADMALE:I was the general partner of the san diego padres at the time.
LEADMALE:And we were doing a night, actually celebrating working women.
LEADMALE:And the best thing i can say is, i thought it was a good idea at the time.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't show that clip.
SUPFEMALE:O say can you see by the dawn's early light roseanne gets out there to sing the national anthem, and she does not do what we would call a mellifluous version.
OTHERMALE:And the rocket's red glare the bombing bursting in air she spits, and she grabs her crotch.
LEADMALE:Like a player would, like adjusting their jock strap, and spitting.
LEADFEMALE:And that's kind of her whole gag after it.
LEADMALE:And people are aghast.
SUPFEMALE:By the time she walked out of that stadium, she was lucky, as someone said, to be alive.
LEADMALE:People hated her.
LEADFEMALE:The president of the united states criticized her.
LEADMALE:President bush today called the comedian roseannebarr's performance on wednesday night disgraceful.
LEADFEMALE:That's the way i feel about it.
LEADFEMALE:And i think a lot of the san diego fans said the same way.
LEADFEMALE:I got out there and i sang about four notes and then i thought it was okay in the beginning and then everybody started booing me and i really went into this panic thing, and, you know, i sang "the star spangled banner" as best i could under the circumstances.
LEADMALE:My whole life was lived out with the tabloids.
SUPMALE:Everything that's ever occurred, you get the phone call.
LEADMALE:She's always told everybody to be brave, and she really embodies it.
OTHERMALE:It's a pitfall of being, you know, celebrated and then, them wanting to tear you down in the same moment.
LEADMALE:She was an easy target, you know? Uhm, for because she's so outspoken.
SUPFEMALE:It's just a beautiful morning today, it just makes me want to sing.
LEADFEMALE:Ultimately, roseanne did what she does best.
SUPFEMALE:Turn strife into satire.
SUPMALE:That woman is on the cover of every one of these papers.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.
LEADFEMALE:She put a voodoo curse on her ex-husband.
LEADMALE:She's a damn good singer, though.
OTHERMALE:The series was so huge that roseanne broke many of the sitcom rules, like having multiple people play the same character.
SUPFEMALE:Quiet, you.
SUPMALE:Becky! I'm lecy goranson, and i play becky on "roseanne.
SUPMALE:" well, you look incredible.
SUPMALE:Really? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Get in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:The becky.
OTHERFEMALE:Not the one and only, but kind of.
SUPFEMALE:Did i hear right, we're going on vacation? Ladies and gentlemen, the role of becky, originally played by lecy goranson, then by sarah chalke, then by lecy goranson will be played this evening by sarah chalke.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sarah chalke, and i was becky 2/4.
LEADFEMALE:God, i hate this family.
LEADFEMALE:We had lecy goranson playing becky, and then when she left for school, sarah chalke played becky.
OTHERFEMALE:And then i came in for a couple of years, and then she came back, and then i came back.
OTHERMALE:Where in the hell have you been? where the hell have you been? why does everyone keep saying that to me? Seems like you've been gone for three years.
LEADMALE:It was the kind of thing you would see in a high school play.
SUPFEMALE:You know where you triple cast the lead in "once upon a mattress" so everybody gets a chance.
SUPMALE:Disney world? I've always wanted to go there.
OTHERFEMALE:Aren't you glad that you're here this week? They had us all watching an episode of âbewitchedâ at the end.
LEADFEMALE:And roseanne says i cannot believe that they replaced that darren.
LEADMALE:And laurie says "they knew it was a hit show", they knew they could get away with anything.
SUPMALE:" and then i say "well, i like the second darren much better.
LEADMALE:" so, they always found ways to, you know, wink at the audience but.
OTHERMALE:And not shy away from the fact of what we were doing.
LEADMALE:Come here, i got it.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you? Come here.
LEADFEMALE:That's a staple of roseanne's show.
LEADMALE:Silly inside jokes.
OTHERFEMALE:But what eluded roseanne for so long, was acceptance by her peers in hollywood.
LEADMALE:[roseanne]: i think i got nominated.
LEADFEMALE:[man]: there you go! You got nomineed for an emmy, you think? I got an emmy nomination.
SUPFEMALE:That moment finally came when she and co-stars john goodman and laurie metcalf are all nominated for emmys.
LEADFEMALE:The emmy goes to laurie metcalf! yeah! I had received an emmy.
LEADMALE:She presented it.
LEADMALE:And i really quickly in my mind, i thought, is my name really on that card or did she just say it? Because i wouldn't have put it past her.
SUPFEMALE:I had to make sure it really metcalf wins, but the others don't, and soon, art imitates life on the set of roseanne.
SUPMALE:I was sitting there polishing my emmy, you know, in the living room on the set.
LEADFEMALE:And she and john were trying to steal it away from me.
LEADMALE:Give me that.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Come on, i want it.
OTHERMALE:No! Give me it.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, no give it give it! give it, come on! what's going on? Oh! Roseanne would finally get her statue the following year.
LEADFEMALE:Next, as the parade of famous faces marches on through i'm the only one here, and the sign says dr.
LEADMALE:Whitman, so, that's me.
SUPMALE:The cast comes to face the end.
LEADFEMALE:This has been a d.j. conner film.
LEADMALE:The show ended and i was devastated.
OTHERMALE:When roseanne returns, literally.
LEADFEMALE:We continue now with more of "roseanne: the return.
LEADMALE:" through nine seasons of award-winning television, the "roseanne show" welcomed so many guest stars and future stars along the way.
OTHERMALE:I'm the only one here and the sign says dr.
LEADMALE:Whitman, so, that's me.
OTHERFEMALE:George clooney.
SUPFEMALE:Oh my gosh, i remember george clooney came on early in his career.
LEADMALE:You know, i've been playing a long time.
LEADMALE:But i used to be a "high scorer".
LEADFEMALE:We're talking about bowling, booker.
LEADMALE:That too.
SUPFEMALE:Who wouldn't like to kiss johnny galecki? Johnny and i have such a special connection.
OTHERMALE:And when we get to work together, it's just an added bonus.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, am i being too loud? No, you're being perfect and you know it.
LEADFEMALE:Johnny galecki, my god.
SUPFEMALE:He's got so much money.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe i'm angry for his success.
LEADMALE:No, i'm very happy for him, he's great.
LEADFEMALE:I tried an accent once but it didn't work for me.
LEADMALE:People kept asking if i was wearing a retainer.
LEADMALE:Sandra bernhard, who is so funny.
LEADFEMALE:I specifically told arne to be here at 9:30.
SUPMALE:All these years later, people will comment on, you know, what i was wearing and loved the outfits and just nancy's outrageousness.
LEADMALE:It is really a big part of the lexicon of my career.
SUPFEMALE:James pickens, he's unbelievably talented.
LEADMALE:But we knew that, you know, decades ago.
SUPFEMALE:Even before i got the "grey's anatomy" gig.
LEADMALE:People would say, i remember you from "roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:" you were chuck.
LEADFEMALE:You're a wideman, marvin.
LEADMALE:They even brought on bob hope on time for a cameo.
LEADMALE:The audience just, just went up.
SUPFEMALE:We get so used to seeing great people that it just becomes an every day thing.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes you have to step back from it for awhile, and look around and go, wow, i got to work with some of the best who ever done it.
SUPMALE:Martin mull and fred willard, who are just incredible together.
OTHERFEMALE:And sharon stone.
SUPFEMALE:My friend toe tobey maguire was on the show.
LEADMALE:Leo dicaprio was on.
LEADMALE:Leonardo dicaprio was darlene's friend.
LEADFEMALE:He was a "doll" too, he was real sweet.
SUPFEMALE:Joseph gordon-levitt.
LEADFEMALE:Dj, don't forget to come to my party on friday.
OTHERMALE:He was another one of those really talented people, who goes, you know, to "third rock from the sun" and then, obviously his career was really blossoming.
SUPFEMALE:But the legacy of the show wasn't just in front of the camera.
SUPMALE:There was sitcom magic behind the scenes.
LEADMALE:We were writers on "roseanne", and we're the creators of "the middle.
LEADMALE:" are you over 50? Ugh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Do you feel overwhelmed with clutter? We loved the writing of "roseanne" so much.
LEADFEMALE:And we said, if we could bring that kind of authenticity, dealing with having that heart you know, and yet having the comedy, all those are things that we brought from "roseanne" into "the middle.
LEADFEMALE:" yeah, and not being afraid, to write some serious situations with characters who don't have a choice always to quit their job.
SUPFEMALE:Or you know, if their credit card bill comes, it actually is a real problem for them.
LEADMALE:"the middle" is definitely rooted in "roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:" "the roseanne show" became the roots of a comedy writing family tree.
LEADFEMALE:We had so many big writers that have created incredible shows.
LEADMALE:Heline and heisler went on and created "the middle".
LEADMALE:Amy sherman-palladino.
OTHERFEMALE:Who obviously went on to create "gilmore girls.
LEADMALE:" danny jacobson.
LEADMALE:Bruce helford, who went on to create many, many days of "drew carey".
SUPFEMALE:And "drew carey" and multiple things.
OTHERMALE:Chuck lorre.
SUPFEMALE:They a lot of 'm.
SUPMALE:It's a great training ground, and everybody knew, if you survived "roseanne", you must be pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:We owe a debt to our time at "roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:" and we have an afghan on couch.
SUPMALE:Just as an hommage to roseanne.
SUPMALE:Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:It's a little nod, afghan on the couch, it means home to us.
SUPMALE:I think that what frankie and roseanne have in common.
LEADMALE:Is, they're not like june cleaver as far as their families go.
LEADMALE:They're not wearing pearls and a dress with an apron.
LEADFEMALE:They don't necessarily always have a kind word or an encouraging word for their kids.
LEADMALE:And not that they're mean, but it's just sort of a realism with your kids that i think a lot of parents relate to.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Here's your hat.
SUPFEMALE:Backpack.
SUPMALE:Lunch.
SUPFEMALE:I think what comes through in both shows is the heart and the love.
LEADMALE:Just as it opened, so many seasons around the kitchen table, "roseanne's" last episode in 1997 included a final gathering of the extended conner family.
SUPFEMALE:The dining table is sort of like the hallmark of where everybody gathers for all important events and i think that she used, you know, the kitchen and the table as the linchpin of all those stories.
SUPMALE:So, it made sense that you would resolve it all at the table.
LEADFEMALE:The final episode shocked the viewers with revealing dan's character was actually dead, and the entire last season, you know, where they were rich and won the lottery we won the lottery! Was all just a story roseanne made up.
LEADFEMALE:None of it happened.
LEADFEMALE:My writing is really what got me through the last year after dan died.
LEADMALE:I think i'll be a lot better now that this book is done.
SUPMALE:The sad ending hit hard for fans and for the cast.
LEADMALE:The show ended and i was devastated.
SUPMALE:Maybe one of the hardest moments of my entire life.
LEADFEMALE:If you can picture everybody you know that you literally have built your world around for nine years suddenly, everybody has to leave.
LEADMALE:It was strange to be only, you know, 22 years old, start back at ground zero and have to build my life back up after having early success.
OTHERMALE:The show ended, but life moved on.
SUPFEMALE:So, after the show, i did a bunch of other acting, "seinfeld.
LEADMALE:" is there anybody else here but you? I'm alone.
SUPMALE:I did a few movies.
SUPFEMALE:And i focused on family.
SUPFEMALE:And i met my wife and got married.
SUPFEMALE:I really wanted my kids to have some kind of normal life and i wanted to be heavily involved as a dad, and so, i went behind the scenes, i worked on the technical side of everything.
LEADFEMALE:And then i was a high school coach, mostly baseball, and softball.
SUPMALE:I guess i look at it is, i got to chase my dream.
LEADMALE:So, i kind of always loved to help other people chase theirs.
SUPFEMALE:I uhm, had been commuting from canada, so i moved back there.
LEADFEMALE:Did my general arts degree.
SUPMALE:Then when i was 24, i was like, okay, i'm ready, i'll go back.
SUPFEMALE:And then got lucky and got "scrubs.
SUPFEMALE:" next patient.
LEADMALE:And ended up staying.
SUPFEMALE:After the show was over, i did a few movies and i just started to work again, and do different projects.
LEADMALE:Lecy goranson finished college, and continues to act in film and theater.
SUPMALE:You go to sleep john goodman's career includes dozens of blockbusters and independent hits.
OTHERMALE:And roseanne returned to standup, started a farm, and even ran for president.
LEADFEMALE:And laurie metcalf and then maybe you learn to pull yourself up, and not expect everybody to do everything ahh! Well, she's going for oscar gold next month.
LEADMALE:Get ready for the return of "roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:" rare home video.
LEADFEMALE:Their first day back in the old house.
OTHERFEMALE:We continue now with more of "roseanne: the return.
SUPMALE:" after 20 years are you ready? Yeah, this is day enough.
SUPMALE:I am for today.
LEADMALE:The cast of "roseanne" is back to work.
LEADMALE:This is the first time they see the recreated set.
LEADMALE:That first moment when we walked in together i don't know if you can totally explain it.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember this is so look at that.
SUPFEMALE:It was just like walking into your home, because it was so familiar.
LEADMALE:Hi, everybody! Oh, my god.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my it was so crazy to walk into the set for the first time.
LEADMALE:It feels like such a time warp.
SUPMALE:Everybody remembers the couch! And the afghan.
LEADMALE:Cans of spam, and all the knickknacks and the pictures on the walls and everything.
LEADFEMALE:It was startling to walk onto that set again after 20 years.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have the words to describe how it was.
SUPMALE:It-it was strange, exhilarating, the wallpaper was reproduced from photographs.
SUPMALE:And the hair was standing up on my arms.
SUPFEMALE:Like being home again.
SUPFEMALE:So, we'd ever corn, and then we had to find our pickled eggs.
SUPFEMALE:Where are the pickled eggs? pickled eggs? Because we always had a big jar of pickled eggs in the pantry.
LEADFEMALE:And that we got on amazon.
LEADFEMALE:The first table read was surreal.
LEADMALE:Oh, she's my tootsie-wootsie there he is! Just having everybody sit around the table like we used to and have sets behind us looking almost exactly the same.
SUPFEMALE:It was truly incredible.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone was crying and laughing.
LEADFEMALE:And the network was excited, which never happens.
SUPFEMALE:Kids laughing, roseanne curls up next to dan.
LEADMALE:Hey, just because they're up doesn't mean we have to give up, you know, pleasuring me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have no time for the whole symphony of love.
SUPMALE:But you can do with the "greatest hits".
LEADMALE:It ended up being more of a magical, like, christmas morning.
OTHERMALE:How did they all get here after 20 years? There's something i've been wanting to talk to you about for a while now.
LEADMALE:It began when john goodman appeared on sara gilbert's talkshow.
SUPFEMALE:What's that, kiddo? Uhm god, i don't know how to say this.
OTHERMALE:I'm a talk show host.
LEADMALE:It was just a fluke moment on sara's talk show.
OTHERFEMALE:We did a little "roseanne" sketch at the top of the show and that, that felt like gold.
LEADFEMALE:You know, for a minute there, i thought you were going to tell me you were gay.
LEADFEMALE:Just like falling out of bed, it was so easy.
LEADFEMALE:Let's save something for halftime.
OTHERFEMALE:John, would you ever consider a reboot of "roseanne?" oh, hell yes.
LEADMALE:I just thought, oh, maybe the cast will do this.
LEADFEMALE:So, i reached out to roseanne and she thought about it a little bit and we started to talk about it and it just started to feel right.
SUPMALE:I got a call from sara gilbert saying, "what would" you think about revisiting 'roseanne'?â and i said, "yes, yes, when?" where do we show up? I'm in.
SUPFEMALE:â i came with a list of things that i would have to have in order to do it.
LEADMALE:I have a lot of anxiety.
LEADMALE:I don't bear stress well at 65.
LEADMALE:I can't be at odds with anybody anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Too old.
OTHERFEMALE:And she said, i can do it.
SUPFEMALE:And i said, all right, well, then do it.
SUPFEMALE:And she did.
LEADFEMALE:Three weeks later, we had a deal at abc.
LEADFEMALE:The conners joys and struggles are as relevant, and as hilarious today as they were then.
LEADMALE:And there is really no one better to comment on our modern america than âroseanne.
LEADFEMALE:â we're at a point in time in our country where people are divided.
SUPMALE:Where there's a lot of frustration and there's a lot of angst.
SUPMALE:There's a lot of economic frustration.
SUPFEMALE:And i think the conners really signify that.
LEADMALE:Our last elections, the jokes were just writing themselves.
SUPMALE:I will wake up with jokes in my head.
OTHERMALE:Dream jokes.
LEADFEMALE:We wanted to show an accurate depiction of america.
LEADFEMALE:And there are new faces in the conner family portrait.
OTHERMALE:One of my favorite episodes was when d.j. wouldn't kiss the black girl in the school play.
LEADFEMALE:Is it because she's black? Well, you'll be mad if i say yes.
SUPMALE:No, we won't.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, we will.
SUPMALE:We wanted to honor a lot of those really powerful story lines currently in this season, he married her and they have a child that's on the show.
SUPMALE:They are unlike any other family on television.
SUPMALE:And again, in this run, like the first run, do not shy away from any topic.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's exactly what's needed.
SUPFEMALE:And it's so damn funny.
OTHERMALE:I think people need to laugh right now.
LEADMALE:You're not seeing double? Both beckys are back, on screen together for the first time.
SUPMALE:It was really fun.
LEADFEMALE:I play andrea on the show and i hire lecy to be my surrogate.
LEADMALE:A lot of our old friends are back on set too, but what about everybody's favorite outfit, that chicken shirt? I don't know the origin story other than it's fabulous.
LEADFEMALE:The chicken shirt came about as a joke with wardrobe.
LEADFEMALE:They thought initially that it was kind of ugly.
OTHERFEMALE:But next thing you know,the chicken shirt ends up on the show and then it kind of grew.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne was wearing it and laurie was wearing it.
SUPMALE:And i think i wore it once.
LEADFEMALE:It just got around.
LEADMALE:We thought it was so hilarious that it became a game of who could wear the chicken shirt and it rotated on different cast members.
LEADMALE:Oh, the chicken shirt is definitely back.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, the chicken shirt and the afghan, it wouldn't be "roseanne" without either of those.
SUPMALE:The end of the day, folks still like to be told great stories.
OTHERFEMALE:And the conners, they told great stories.
SUPMALE:I think it may even be funnier now, just because of the times we live in.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on, both socially and culturally and politically and i think this is probably perfect timing to reboot "roseanne.
LEADMALE:" there's a lot of surprises in for people.
LEADFEMALE:I think we answer all the questions, people have asked me for 20 years.
SUPFEMALE:Here's a test for you.
LEADFEMALE:What's the one thing everybody remembers from "roseanne?" you'll find out when we return.
SUPMALE:Ah, the afghan on the couch.
LEADFEMALE:You know you had one.
OTHERMALE:But it wouldn't have been "roseanne" without it.
LEADMALE:Dan won't get off the couch.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, get off the couch.
SUPMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:I believe, the afghan just showed up on the set.
SUPFEMALE:Who knew that it would become iconic, you know? This is the show.
OTHERMALE:This thing right here.
LEADMALE:What is it with you? All you do is lay here on the couch staring at that stupid tv.
LEADMALE:We wanted an afghan like my grandmother used to make.
LEADMALE:Now come on, dan, we're missing a chance to give this family a dose of culture.
SUPFEMALE:She'd whip them up in about two hours.
OTHERFEMALE:She was so good at it.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody's house in the midwest had one of those, so, it was like, part of having some realism in the show.
OTHERMALE:You look great, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you.
OTHERMALE:We've all taken naps on that couch.
LEADFEMALE:People have used that afghan to sleep in.
LEADFEMALE:While writers were rewriting stuff.
LEADMALE:You don't even know what cop material is.
OTHERMALE:Somebody swiped it.
LEADFEMALE:They always gave me that when i say, i'd like to have that afghan.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's in the smithsonian.
LEADMALE:That's what they tell me.
LEADFEMALE:We spent a lot of time jumping around, and playing on it, and jumping over it, and the set really, for us, feels like home.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, my dear, thanks for the memories.
LEADMALE:And we look forward to make new ones with you.
SUPMALE:You can catch a first look at the new "roseanne" during this year's oscars.
LEADMALE:And of course, the brand new series starts march 27th right here on abc.
OTHERMALE:I'm joy behar.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for watching.
LEADMALE:And i'll see you tomorrow on "the view.
SUPMALE:" good night.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne: dan? dan! dan! What? what happened? I thought you were dead.
LEADFEMALE:I was sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:Why does everybody always think i'm dead? You looked happy.
LEADMALE:I thought maybe you moved on.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, they're up.
OTHERMALE:I know it's only been a week, but i just can't get used to darlene and her kids living in the house.
LEADMALE:I got no privacy.
LEADFEMALE:I can't even make my maxwell house naked, like god intended.
SUPMALE:Well, just 'cause they're up doesn't mean we have to give up, you know, pleasuring me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if we got time for the full symphony of love, but i'm sure we can knock off a few of the greatest hits.
LEADMALE:Brace yourself, mother! "roseanne" is taped in front of a live studio audience.
SUPMALE:[as sammy davis jr.
LEADFEMALE:] candyman's home, babe.
SUPMALE:Ooh, my favorite drugs! ah! What happened to the rest of our candy? Ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Funny story.
LEADFEMALE:Our insurance don't cover what it used to, so i got half the drugs for twice the price.
LEADFEMALE:What are we supposed to do? Well, tradesies.
LEADMALE:I'll trade you five of my statins for five of your anti-inflammatories, and i'll sweeten the pot by throwing in a couple of blood pressures.
SUPFEMALE:Did you get the pain pills for my bad knee? [as sammy davis jr.
LEADFEMALE:] wouldn't be the candyman without the sunshine, babe.
OTHERMALE:Whoo! My babies.
LEADMALE:Did you get the anti-depressants? They're all yours.
LEADFEMALE:If you're not happy, i have no chance of being happy.
SUPMALE:Morning, lovebirds.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, are you eating peeps for breakfast? what's it to ya? Uh, i didn't quit my job and come home to watch you kill yourself slowly, eating old easter candy.
LEADMALE:Hey, i worked hard all my life, and if i want to eat a marshmallow chicken for my breakfast, i think it's my damn business.
LEADFEMALE:Well, like it or not, i'm here to take care of you, and i can be as stubborn as you are.
LEADMALE:Did you remember to measure your blood sugar this morning? Yup.
LEADFEMALE:Sweet as can be.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i guess that's why you passed out at walmart last month.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:That was because their prices are so low.
SUPMALE:Dad, will you tell her how stupid she's being? That's never worked out for me.
SUPMALE:And, you know, mom, i know you and aunt jackie are mad at each other, but this feud is getting way out of control.
LEADMALE:You weren't here, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't see it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, not only did she vote for the worst person on earth, but she was a real jerk about it, too.
OTHERMALE:And now she's just ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, she's ridiculous? You made a shrine to her as if she's dead.
OTHERMALE:Well, she's dead to me.
LEADMALE:And you better give me some credit 'cause i said very nice things about her in her obituary.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, granny rose.
OTHERMALE:Morning, mark.
SUPFEMALE:Morning, grandpa.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, son.
LEADMALE:Oh, come here.
OTHERMALE:I got to fix your hair.
LEADFEMALE:You got a little piece sticking up.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene says just ignore it.
LEADMALE:He's "exploring.
OTHERFEMALE:" may the winds fill his sails and carry him to the boy's section of target.
LEADFEMALE:What you gonna have for breakfast, mark? My mom always makes me blueberry waffles with real maple syrup.
LEADFEMALE:Cereal, you say? Don't get your hopes up.
LEADMALE:There's no waffles.
LEADMALE:How come you're always smiling? It's weird.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Can i have some money? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Mom, can i have some money? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Can i have some money? You could've just said we were poor.
LEADMALE:I didn't need the routine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be back for dinner.
LEADMALE:Whoa, you didn't tell me you were going out.
LEADFEMALE:I need you to watch mark.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a job interview today.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:I made plans with my one potential friend.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, harris, but i-i tag me in.
SUPFEMALE:You're babysittin'.
LEADMALE:Game over.
SUPFEMALE:This is so unfair.
LEADFEMALE:You're ruining my life! you all suck! I ain't seen that movie in 20 years.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the classics really do hold up.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, darlene, i'll give you a ride to your job interview.
LEADMALE:All's you got to do is open up your uber app and request me.
OTHERFEMALE:And it's surgin' 'cause i know you really need a ride.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, yeah, i'm good.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna like this, but, uh, aunt jackie's picking me up.
LEADFEMALE:What?! How dare you invite her here without asking me first.
OTHERMALE:This is my house! Well, and she's my aunt.
SUPFEMALE:You know, i mean, she was an important part of my childhood.
SUPMALE:I want that for my kids.
SUPFEMALE:She was always fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything's fun when you're a kid.
SUPMALE:You ever go to the circus as an adult? It's nothing but animals getting beat and drunk clowns.
SUPFEMALE:Look, she promised that she would get along, and knowing the both of you, i'm guessing you're the one keeping this feud alive.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, deplorable? Okay, you guys have got to talk this out civilly.
OTHERMALE:Mom, aunt jackie's standing right here, pussyhat in hand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I don't have time for this.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie: knee still giving you trouble, roseanne? why don't you get that fixed with the new health care all you suckers got promised? It works good enough to kick your ass, snowflake.
OTHERMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:All you people go straight to the violence.
LEADFEMALE:Every one of you wrapping yourselves up in the flag and clinging to your guns.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's such a stereotype.
LEADMALE:Where you going? I just realized we got kids in the house and i can't remember where we hid our gun.
LEADMALE:Well, you must have put it someplace you thought it would be safe.
SUPMALE:Yeah, i was gonna put it in the cleaning closet 'cause i know nobody ever goes in there.
SUPMALE:No, i put it in the cleaning closet 'cause every time i had to clean the house, i'd like knowing i had an option.
OTHERMALE:Well, looky here.
SUPMALE:"written by roseanne conner.
LEADFEMALE:" oh, trash that.
LEADFEMALE:This would have sold like hot cakes if only you hadn't killed off the most interesting character.
OTHERFEMALE:He was a gentle giant.
LEADMALE:You know what really would've helped, though? More bondage and a wizard school.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:How was your job interview? Oh, [scoffs], well, the pay was crap with no benefits, there were 50 people in line ahead of me when i got there, but someone did call me "ma'am," so that was great.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! Uh, some of your mail got forwarded here from your old address.
LEADFEMALE:It's on the kitchen counter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, that is startling news.
LEADFEMALE:Where's jackie? She's going to be back in a little bit.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, i'm just not giving up.
SUPFEMALE:I invited her to dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you cared about our health.
LEADFEMALE:Now i got to go take one of your dad's blood pressure pills.
SUPFEMALE:You're killing your father.
OTHERFEMALE:Still a good picture.
LEADMALE:Uh, here's some dressing for the table.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look, dan russian.
SUPMALE:Spread these around.
LEADFEMALE:I can't, my nails are wet.
OTHERMALE:Your nails are wet.
LEADFEMALE:You hear that, honey? My grandson's nails are wet.
LEADFEMALE:I like your nail polish, grandpa.
SUPFEMALE:That's drywall, son.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, aunt jackie! hey, oh-oh, harris! I love the outfit.
LEADFEMALE:Six bucks.
OTHERMALE:I got it at the hospital thrift store.
LEADFEMALE:They're dead people's clothes.
SUPFEMALE:Well, those people must've died from compliments.
SUPFEMALE:Granny rose! oh! it's my little princess! Or senator or doctor or captain of industry because girls can be whatever they want to be.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to train cats to bark.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I think it's cool.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt jackie thinks every girl should grow up and be president, even if they're a "liar, liar, pantsuit on fire.
LEADFEMALE:" i think we know who's a liar and who's on fire, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, aunt jackie.
LEADMALE:D.j. ! Welcome back.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you for your service.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, but i've been out of the army for three months.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i've been off the force for years, but i can still taste the adrenaline.
SUPMALE:Um, how's the missus? she win the war over there yet? Not yet.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, thank her for her service.
SUPMALE:I brought salad.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for your salad.
LEADMALE:Darlene: hey, everybody, this is the first dinner together we've had as a family in a long time.
SUPFEMALE:Let's try to survive it.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:First, let's say grace.
LEADMALE:Jackie, would you like to take a knee? Dear lord, thank you for this food and for bringing our son, d.j. , home safe from syria.
LEADMALE:Please protect his wife, geena, and all our troops still overseas.
OTHERFEMALE:Please watch over our son, jerry, who's on that stupid fishing boat where apparently they don't get phone calls.
SUPMALE:But most of all, lord thank you for making america great again! Mom.
LEADMALE:No, it's okay, darlene.
LEADMALE:I'm going to use my life-coaching degree to model the behavior that i teach all my many, many clients.
OTHERMALE:In situations like this, we don't name-call.
LEADMALE:We respond with a positive affirmation about the other person.
SUPFEMALE:You're looking very fit.
LEADMALE:Uh, apparently, all that weight you lost was the good roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:How could you have voted for him, roseanne?! he talked about jobs, jackie! he said he'd shake things up! I mean, this might come as a complete shock to you, but we almost lost our house, the way things are going.
LEADFEMALE:Have you looked at the news? 'cause now things are worse.
OTHERFEMALE:Not on the real news! oh, puh-leeze! Becky: hey, everybody.
LEADMALE:I have an announcement.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm having a baby.
SUPMALE:A baby what? There's this really nice woman who wants me to have her baby.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be her surrogate.
SUPFEMALE:You're pregnant? No, i have to fill out some forms and answer a bunch of questions first.
SUPMALE:Daddy, is that how you have a baby? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:And she's paying me $50,000.
LEADFEMALE:Wow! Just for having a baby? Dan, you owe me $200,000.
SUPFEMALE:Right after my checkup, i start getting the shots to produce extra eggs.
SUPMALE:Hold up.
OTHERFEMALE:Extra eggs? they're using your eggs? Yeah, it's my eggs and her husband's sperm.
SUPMALE:Sorry, i know you're eating.
SUPMALE:But that's like selling off one of our grandkids.
LEADMALE:Mom, if i do this, i can pay off my credit cards, i could buy a new car, maybe put something down on a house.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do that working at the restaurant.
LEADMALE:Is anyone gonna mention the fact that she's like 50? I'm 43 and i told her i was 33, which, according to the lady at the mac counter, is my skin age.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, you should've used your iq, becky.
OTHERMALE:You could've said you were 23.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, i know you've had a hard time since your husband died.
OTHERMALE:I think this would be a wonderful opportunity for you to get back on your feet, and if you need anybody to talk to, anybody to drive you to appointments, i'm here for you.
LEADMALE:Anybody want to know what i think? Dan, it's her body, her decision.
LEADMALE:Right, roseanne? Jackie's right, dan.
LEADMALE:It's it's becky's call.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, mom.
SUPMALE:I'll be out the garage.
LEADFEMALE:I better go talk to him.
SUPFEMALE:I'll wait 'til he has a couple of beers first.
LEADFEMALE:That oughta do it.
LEADFEMALE:Can you believe the way she put us both on the spot like that? I'm not letting becky do this, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:In this family, if you get pregnant, you're gonna have the baby.
SUPMALE:We're gonna love the baby, we're gonna raise the baby to believe that anything is possible, until the time the baby realizes it got screwed by being born into this family, then we're gonna send that baby out into the world until such time said baby returns home to us to live with its own baby! Well, i don't want her selling off our grandkids, either, dan, but, you know, if there's one thing we learned about becky is we can't tell her what to do 'cause then she'll just go do the exact opposite.
LEADMALE:I mean, remember we told her not to get married? She got married.
LEADMALE:Remember we told her not to get that marky mark and the funky bunch tattoo? She got the tattoo.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and we told her she had to finish high school, so she didn't finish high school? she didn't finish high school? You miss a lot of stuff when you're out drinking in the garage, dan.
LEADMALE:That's the whole point.
SUPFEMALE:So, aren't you gonna say anything about the baby? You're not having a baby.
OTHERMALE:Of course you're gonna give me crap about this.
OTHERFEMALE:No, i'm merely pointing out, at your age, your uterus should be designated a historic landmark.
OTHERFEMALE:At least i'm taking care of myself.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not living at home with my parents.
LEADFEMALE:I'm taking care of them, they're not taking care of me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, [scoffs], look, m-mom and jackie are fighting, dad and mom aren't taking their medication.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want to come home.
LEADMALE:I had to come home because this family's falling apart.
SUPMALE:You're too selfish to care about anyone but you.
LEADMALE:You just keep telling yourself that, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:And, by the way, i'm about to have a baby.
LEADMALE:I don't need to be stressed out.
LEADMALE:I don't live here anymore.
SUPMALE:Don't be mean to your sister.
LEADMALE:She's an old woman trying to have a baby.
LEADMALE:And, by the way, darlene, if you want to tell everybody that you came home to take care of us, we'll back you up on that.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? That is why i came home.
LEADMALE:Your severance check got forwarded here.
OTHERMALE:You lost your job, right? y-you opened my mail? Yeah, i never stopped.
LEADFEMALE:That is such a huge violation.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
OTHERFEMALE:That's this one.
LEADMALE:They caught you on a red light camera.
OTHERMALE:It looks like you're reading a magazine.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:You know, what do you want me to say? i lost my job, okay? You know, i-i didn't know what else to do.
LEADFEMALE:I got two kids, i got no partner, so i came home.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why didn't you just say that? Because it's embarrassing.
LEADMALE:You know, i just i thought i'd be a huge success by now.
LEADMALE:I-i thought i could buy a huge house that i could hold over your head.
LEADMALE:That would've been sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, please just don't tell becky and d.j. about this.
LEADFEMALE:My scathing commentary on their life would be severely compromised.
LEADMALE:Oh, come here.
LEADFEMALE:My little loser.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not letting you eat that pie.
LEADMALE:Shhhh! Well, i finally got you alone.
SUPFEMALE:Are you out of your damn mind? becky's about to make a horrible mistake, and you're talking about helping her out and driving her to the doctor? dan and me don't want her to be a surrogate! What has happened to you? You always believed in "my body, my choice.
LEADMALE:" right, and her body came out of my body, so it's my choice.
LEADMALE:You just can't stand for anybody to have their own opinions about anything, can you? So you tell them how stupid they are all the time, and you get them to question what they believe in their heart is the right thing to do until they make some enormous mistake that tears america apart and brings the world to the brink of nuclear apocalypse! So, i'm guessing this isn't about becky's eggs anymore.
LEADMALE:You kept saying what a disaster it would be if she got elected and how i wasn't seeing the big picture and how everything was rigged, and then i go into the booth and i voted for jill stein! who's jill stein? Some doctor! You did such a good job of making me doubt myself and feel so stupid that i choked, which helped get him elected.
OTHERMALE:Well, the important thing is that you voted.
SUPMALE:Being away from you this past year proved to me that i make good decisions on my own.
SUPMALE:I miss the family but i would rather be alone than let you bully me again.
LEADMALE:Jackie, it is not my fault that i just happen to be a charismatic person who's always right about everything.
SUPMALE:And i never said you were stupid.
LEADMALE:Well, i didn't mean it.
LEADMALE:You're relatively smart.
OTHERFEMALE:And i guess i didn't mean to imply that you're some right-wing jackass.
LEADFEMALE:I should have tried to understand why you voted the crazy way that you did.
LEADFEMALE:And i should have understood that, you know, you want the government to give everybody free health care 'cause you're a good-hearted person who can't do simple math.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:And i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:And you? I forgive you.
SUPFEMALE:I know how hard that was for you.
OTHERMALE:It is so great to finally meet you! And i can see why you picked me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, look at us.
LEADFEMALE:We could be the same person.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:I mean, it is like looking in the mirror before i put my makeup on.
LEADFEMALE:Now, i have all the paperwork here for you to take home and review.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, agreement form, medical release it's standard stuff.
SUPMALE:I also have some questions about your genetic history, so i should probably meet your family.
OTHERFEMALE:You want to meet my family? you know what would save time? If i showed you pictures on my phone and described them instead.
LEADMALE:Mm, say no more.
OTHERMALE:I know how families can be.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think i could warm them up with a monthly delivery of fresh, organic pears? That'd be perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:They've all been meaning to try a pear.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:What the hell? Shh! Don't spook it.
OTHERFEMALE:That's the great north american bottom-heavy white wino.
SUPMALE:It appears to be doing some sort of cleaning ritual.
SUPFEMALE:I hear they only do this every ten years when they really need something.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i need to get ten years of cheeto dust off this table.
LEADFEMALE:Great, now our cold drinks will be sitting directly on the wood.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Andrea's coming over tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys could blow $50,000 for me if she decides not to use me as a surrogate.
LEADMALE:Could you please put away anything you got free with a tank of gas? Oh, i see what you're doing, becky.
LEADFEMALE:You don't want her to think we're poor white trash.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what would help that? Don't have a yard sale in your uterus.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene: are you sure you want her to come here? She wants to meet you guys.
LEADMALE:She has questions about our family history.
SUPMALE:Ohh! We have a family history? mother, have you been keeping our glorious heritage from us? Yeah.
LEADMALE:All of your relatives died from alcoholism.
SUPMALE:The ones that didn't drink were killed by the ones who did.
SUPMALE:What are you doing with my pictures? I don't want her to think obesity runs in our family.
LEADFEMALE:So, i'm getting rid of the ones where you guys were fat.
SUPFEMALE:Those are the only ones where we look happy! Also, remember i told her i'm 33 and i'm the baby of the family.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i love this game.
LEADMALE:If you're 33, can i be an astronaut? You live with mom and dad.
LEADFEMALE:You can't even escape the gravitational pull of this house.
SUPFEMALE:And by the way, i look 33.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, the only reason you look younger than me is 'cause you're embalmed in mike's hard lemonade.
LEADFEMALE:Where have you been? All the bathrooms were ocupado, so i had to "urinado" behind the casa.
LEADFEMALE:Gross.
SUPMALE:Why couldn't you wait? Because i realized i'm old and i can do whatever i want.
LEADMALE:Besides, it was kind of nice out there.
SUPFEMALE:You breathe in the fresh air get close to nature, wave to the neighbors with my free hand.
LEADMALE:Oh, good job, dad.
SUPMALE:We finally got our red dot on the sex offenders map.
SUPMALE:Please don't be like this tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I know you've all seen normal people.
SUPMALE:Can you pick one and act like that? Hey, everybody.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow's the first day at my new school.
SUPMALE:How does this look? Aw, you look great, buddy.
SUPMALE:I feel like it's kind of plain, like it needs something.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Fast shoes and a head start.
LEADFEMALE:"roseanne" is taped in front of a live audience.
OTHERMALE:First day at my old alma ma'.
LEADFEMALE:Lanford high! so am i! if you've got spirit hope you die! go smoke by the river! Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, here's how you get through lanford high.
SUPMALE:Laugh at everything miss cunningham says, ask mr.
LEADMALE:Skinner about the cubs, and tell miss rogers that you love bananarama.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a second.
SUPMALE:These teachers are probably all dead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks for the pep talk.
SUPFEMALE:I think i'm good.
SUPMALE:Wait, so you're not nervous? do you need a hug or anything? No.
OTHERMALE:Do you? Yeah, i kinda do.
LEADMALE:You worried about mark? A little.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:I miss when you guys were at the same school so you could keep an eye on him.
SUPFEMALE:I was supposed to keep an eye on him? Alright, well, let's hope he continues to be lucky.
SUPMALE:Oh, i almost forgot.
SUPFEMALE:Don't go out for soccer.
LEADFEMALE:The field is under the high-voltage power lines.
LEADFEMALE:The whole team from '85 is sterile.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you didn't have to make their lunch.
LEADFEMALE:I would've done that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's out of guilt.
OTHERFEMALE:Your father and i had a lunchables party in the middle of the night.
LEADFEMALE:You get up to use the bathroom, you end up having another dinner.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you talked to mark about wearing that outfit to school, right? He's gonna get beat up, sure as hell.
LEADMALE:He'll be fine.
LEADMALE:He wore stuff like that all the time in chicago.
LEADMALE:The musical? I don't get why he's wearing clothes like that to school.
LEADFEMALE:He just likes to wear clothes like that sometimes.
OTHERFEMALE:I've read a bunch of books about it, and they all say to let him just be who he is.
OTHERFEMALE:He gets good grades, he's happy for a conner and, i mean, that's that's all i really care about.
LEADFEMALE:You know, as a life coach this might be a good time to grab a snack or go pee in the yard.
LEADMALE:As a life coach, let me share some research that i think might be pertinent.
OTHERMALE:Before the 1900s, there were no colors associated with gender at all.
LEADFEMALE:And then the infamous clothing industrial complex decided that pink was for girls and blue was for boys just to make people have to buy more clothes.
LEADMALE:If you're done and so, my point is kudos to darlene for letting mark be himself.
SUPMALE:I mean, given the choice, who knows how many children would choose a style different from what society has "assigned" to them.
SUPMALE:Thank you, aunt jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and grown-ups, too, you know? When i'm home alone sometimes, i like to light a few candles and put on some prince and dance in front of a mirror wearing men's boxers and an old fishing hat.
OTHERFEMALE:You can get off my side now.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene you're his mom.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay if you think it's fine that he plays dress-up around the house, but if you care about his safety, you'll make him wear pants to school.
SUPMALE:Oh, so you're saying when he's out of the house, he's got to pretend to be someone he's not? Yes.
LEADMALE:If i didn't do that, we'd never be able to cash a check anywhere.
LEADMALE:You know what? I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I-i'm not gonna raise him that way, and by the way, you didn't have any problem when i wore basketball shorts and a bulls jersey to school every day.
SUPMALE:Darlene, god did not give me this big a head to hold a narrow mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'm totally cool with girls who like basketball, boys who like sewing, but you're dreaming if you think he isn't in for a world of hurt.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, and we're totally not bigoted because we already came to terms with the fact that you were gay.
SUPMALE:I'm not gay.
LEADMALE:You know, gay people throughout history we're not talking about gay! The kid is nine years old.
LEADFEMALE:He's too young to like girls or boys yet, and frankly, wherever this lands with mark, i'm fine with it.
LEADMALE:Then so am i! I'm totally fine with gay.
SUPMALE:My daughter's gay! not gay! You think i'm smart, don't you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah! What's for breakfast? You better carbo-load.
LEADMALE:I have a feeling today's gonna be more of a marathon than a sprint.
OTHERMALE:Come on, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to be late.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, then start walking.
LEADMALE:No, you have to drive me.
LEADMALE:You've gotta be there to sign a form saying i'm up to date with all my shots.
LEADFEMALE:What? I was taking mark.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have time to go to your school and pretend i get you proper medical care.
SUPFEMALE:Well o-okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right, fine.
LEADMALE:Can one of you guys take mark? Yes, i'll take little braveheart.
LEADMALE:Hey, mark.
LEADMALE:Yeah? I'm taking you to school, but i want to talk to you first.
SUPFEMALE:Shove over.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, i'm gonna ask you something kind of adult, but you're growing up, and i think you can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Do you feel like you're a boy or a girl? A boy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you answered that pretty quick.
LEADMALE:I thought it was gonna be more complicated.
SUPFEMALE:So, what's up with the girls' clothes? This just feels like me.
LEADFEMALE:I like colors that pop.
LEADMALE:It's more creative.
LEADMALE:Well, your mom's creative, so i get that, but here's the thing you gotta pick your fights in life.
SUPMALE:How important is this to you? It's important.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Well, you know it's gonna be rough on you at school, right? But we'll back you up.
LEADMALE:Ohhh! Kinda scary talking to your old granny, huh? I'm not afraid of you.
SUPMALE:Give it time.
SUPMALE:Mark, why don't you find a seat.
LEADMALE:Freak! Do you mind if i talk to the class for a minute? No, go ahead.
SUPMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:Eyes up here.
LEADMALE:Um i'm mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, and, uh, this is my grandson, mark, and he's just starting school here today, which is very cool 'cause all my other kids went here, and they continue to lead crime-free lives.
LEADMALE:I think you guys are really gonna like mark 'cause he is a lot of fun, and he's very fashionable.
LEADMALE:Sometimes he wants to wear a dress or a real fancy top.
LEADFEMALE:I think he's gonna grow up and be a fashion designer.
LEADMALE:A really famous one, like, uh, t.
LEADMALE:J.
OTHERFEMALE:Maxx or, um or that ross guy.
SUPMALE:So, i'm counting on you guys to make the new kid feel welcome.
SUPMALE:And if you don't, i have ways of finding out about it.
OTHERMALE:I'm a white witch.
SUPMALE:Hi, andrea.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, rebecca.
LEADMALE:"rebecca"? Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I'm her aunt jacqueline, and, um, i am lanford's leading life coach, and as such, i respect the powerful process you must be going through to build your family.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:My husband, richard, and i are just so grateful that rebecca's willing to go on this journey with us.
SUPMALE:Journeys! Mm.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh, brought you some ionized water in glass bottles.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I love water.
LEADFEMALE:I hate plastic bottles.
LEADMALE:I mean, you might as well suck the mercury out of a thermometer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i love plastic bottles 'cause when you're done with them, you just gather 'em up and dump 'em in the lake.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:You must be, uh andrea.
SUPFEMALE:This is my mother, roseanne conner.
SUPFEMALE:She's a hoot.
LEADMALE:Why don't we sit down.
SUPMALE:Okay, i'm just gonna do this as quickly as possible.
SUPFEMALE:Um, i just have a few questions about your family's medical history.
OTHERFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner, did all of your children's deliveries go according to your birth plan? Um they found their way out, if that's what you mean.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, she means were there any medical emergencies that arose? a time when the newborn might have been in distress? Thank you, jacqueline.
LEADFEMALE:No, the birth part was easy.
SUPMALE:Followed by decades of unbearable pain.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Next question.
SUPMALE:Uh, does mental illness run in your family? And don't be embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, i get anxiety on international flights.
SUPMALE:No mental illness.
LEADFEMALE:Well our mother was never formally diagnosed, but i'm pretty sure she's stark, raving i'll tell you what runs in our family a sense of humor.
LEADFEMALE:If it's okay, i have some questions for you, too, andrea.
SUPMALE:I hope you don't mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, it's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Really.
LEADFEMALE:Um, so, are you gonna be there when becky has sex with your husband, or what? Mom! They don't do it like that.
SUPFEMALE:Right? Oh, god, no! No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Becky's egg will be extracted at the hospital use becky's egg.
OTHERMALE:Be extracted.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:And then the healthiest one will be fertilized there fertilized.
LEADMALE:And then implanted.
SUPFEMALE:And then implanted! Okay, gotcha.
LEADMALE:So, how are you gonna take care of becky through this whole thing? Oh, she's gonna get the very best medical care, and we're planning a totally natural birth.
LEADMALE:You mean with no drugs? say what now? I just read an article about how mothers who don't use drugs during childbirth recover so much faster.
OTHERMALE:Oh, if you're worried about me, andrea, you don't need to be.
SUPMALE:I don't care how long it takes to recover.
SUPMALE:I'll take all the drugs you got.
LEADFEMALE:Mark, go up to your room.
OTHERFEMALE:Andrea, this is my older sister, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:What happened with mark? Nothing.
SUPMALE:He's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Where's dad? He's in the kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:He's washing his tail in the sink.
SUPFEMALE:Mom! Guess what? I had to pick up mark from the principal's office today.
LEADFEMALE:I knew something bad was gonna happen.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, he showed a kid a knife at school, and he said you gave it to him.
LEADMALE:Is that true? what? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I gave it to him.
LEADMALE:I didn't tell him to bring it to school.
LEADMALE:What the hell were you thinking? I didn't think it was that big of a deal, darlene.
OTHERMALE:You wanted a knife at that age, i gave you one.
LEADMALE:That was to defend myself at home.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i know why you gave mark a knife.
LEADFEMALE:It's to turn him into your version of a boy.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, i didn't know there were that many versions.
LEADMALE:And, yeah, i admit, i was happy he liked it.
LEADMALE:He's got a pocketknife now.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm hoping it's a gateway to having pockets.
LEADFEMALE:So, you admit it? You were trying to make him more masculine.
LEADFEMALE:When did "masculine" become a dirty word? And no, i'm not.
SUPMALE:I'm scared for him.
LEADFEMALE:If i don't get what's going on, what do you think a classroom full of 10-year-olds from lanford is gonna do? From what i remember about the exchange student in my school, what you don't understand, you beat the crap out of.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe things have changed over the last fifty years.
LEADMALE:Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe not.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you ask mark why he really had that knife out today? I'm guessing it wasn't for show and tell.
OTHERMALE:Well, i'm keeping a lid on things out there, but roseanne just found out that andrea's gonna eat becky's placenta.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on! Hey, you guys gotta go fight someplace else.
LEADMALE:I need to yell at becky in here.
SUPFEMALE:It's it's fine.
LEADMALE:We're done.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go check on mark.
LEADFEMALE:He got caught with a knife at school.
SUPFEMALE:What idiot gave him a knife? Dad mom needs to chill.
LEADFEMALE:I am not letting you ruin this for me.
LEADFEMALE:All i want is a down payment on a house and a dentist who doesn't work out of his van or just to sit on my ass for two minutes without stressing about money! Becky, you might not want to see this baby, but we will.
OTHERMALE:And i'll tell you how this whole thing's gonna end.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be kidnapping my own grandkid, and i'm gonna end up in jail.
SUPFEMALE:And don't think that's a deterrent 'cause i'll probably do less laundry! Mark.
OTHERMALE:You know what you did wrong, don't you? Yeah, i do.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna ask you something, and you gotta be honest with me.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:You're not gonna get in trouble.
OTHERMALE:That's what you said last time.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but this time i mean it.
SUPFEMALE:That's what you said last time.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we've established you remember things.
SUPMALE:Why did you take that knife out at school? I told you, i was just showing it off to a kid.
SUPMALE:Okay, so no one was trying to hurt you or anything? No.
LEADFEMALE:He was definitely going to hurt me.
SUPMALE:That's when i decided to give it to him as a gift.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you tell me? 'cause i didn't want you coming down to the school and making a big deal.
OTHERMALE:Granny rose already told everyone she's a witch.
LEADFEMALE:No, she'd never get that close to a broom.
LEADMALE:Was it about your clothes? I guess.
LEADMALE:Well, what did he say? He said i was weird, and he was going to tell everyone i was a girl-bot so that no one would want to play with me.
LEADFEMALE:What a loser.
SUPMALE:You know that's ridiculous, right? Yeah but no one played with me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, they will.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the thing you are weird.
LEADMALE:I'm weird.
LEADFEMALE:This whole family is really weird, right? So, you just gotta hang in there until people figure out that weird is cool.
LEADFEMALE:When is that? I don't know, but it'll happen, and in the meantime, you just find the other weird kids and you hide amongst them.
OTHERFEMALE:By the time the bullies make their way through to you, there'll be a pile so high of glasses, retainers, and headgear, they'll never get over it.
OTHERFEMALE:There's this girl who offers to dissect everybody's frogs.
OTHERMALE:Okay, you could be her friend for now, but, you know, as she gets older, you might want to drift away.
SUPMALE:Ready to go! Oh, you sure? do i need to frisk you? you packing heat? No, mom.
SUPMALE:All right, second day of school.
LEADFEMALE:Remember what i told you if anybody has a problem with what you're wearing? Tell them to wait for me under the high-voltage lines.
LEADMALE:No, the other thing.
LEADMALE:It's their problem.
LEADMALE:And we should all be ourselves, but if things get rough, i put pants and a t-shirt in your backpack, and you know what? You're still gonna be you.
LEADFEMALE:No, i won't.
LEADMALE:I'm fine, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what if that kid teases you again or pushes you down or something? He'll get tired of it eventually.
OTHERMALE:I like my clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, mom.
LEADMALE:I don't want to be late.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! hey! grr! Get out of here.
SUPMALE:Tough kid.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna miss him.
SUPMALE:Hey, mom, i'm on my way to work.
LEADFEMALE:Um andrea sent you a "thank you" gift.
LEADFEMALE:Turns out you didn't totally ruin everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we'll try harder next time.
LEADMALE:Oh, look it.
SUPFEMALE:It's potpourri.
LEADMALE:I hope you like it, becky, 'cause that's what you're getting for christmas.
LEADFEMALE:Guess she thinks our house stinks.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, yeah, that's your fault.
SUPFEMALE:You kicked up all those bad smells with all that vacuuming.
LEADFEMALE:We had 'em settled down real nice.
LEADFEMALE:It looks better than it tastes.
SUPMALE:You gotta put milk on it! He fakes left.
LEADFEMALE:He dribbles past the big man.
LEADMALE:He shoots.
LEADMALE:He scores! Stop it.
LEADFEMALE:How's school treating you? Fine.
LEADMALE:Have any more trouble with that kid? Nope.
SUPFEMALE:He's got a peanut allergy, so i can take him out with a handful of trail mix.
SUPMALE:Hey, can girls play? â­hey.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Can they? Oh, like taking candy from a sweaty baby.
LEADMALE:Ha! Watch and learn, boys.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! little man flying to the hoop! He goes up, up, up.
LEADFEMALE:Flying in boom! ahhh! and the crowd goes wild! Okay, he doesn't have to wear pants, but he's gotta wear underwear.
SUPFEMALE:It's daytime, people! Rise and shine.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, everybody, i got this.
SUPMALE:I have a few years left to live, and this is exactly how i want to spend it.
SUPFEMALE:What is this, courtyard by marriott? Housekeeping! Oh i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Were you sleeping? uh, what's up? You guys are slobs, and i'm sick of it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i don't know how you're so cheerful first thing in the morning.
LEADMALE:I always need coffee.
SUPFEMALE:No, i'm serious.
LEADMALE:You got to make your kids pick up.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to be the disciplinarian.
OTHERMALE:I want to be the fun grandma who gives them too much sugar and teaches them to gamble and stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, it's not mark, it's harris.
OTHERFEMALE:She's all over the place right now because she just started a business on etsy.
LEADFEMALE:What's etsy? It's like a yard sale except online because nobody can afford a yard anymore.
LEADMALE:She sells used clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Apparently, it's cool to look poor now.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's all fun and games 'til you're reusing your diabetes needles.
SUPFEMALE:Enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:"roseanne" is taped in front of a live audience.
OTHERMALE:There's my uber gal.
SUPFEMALE:How was your day of picking up perfect strangers for money? Fine, but every time i stepped on the brake, it killed my knee.
SUPFEMALE:I had this one guy who actually wanted me to stop at every single stop sign.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Have you seen my ice pack? No, but i've got something way better to show you.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, you're really phoning in the foreplay these days.
SUPMALE:Come with me, and prepare to be overjoyed.
SUPMALE:Could it be i'm getting a spanking from mr.
SUPMALE:Wayne newton? Kiss that old ice pack goodbye and say hello to the superior styling and customized craftsmanship of the whisper-quiet easyclimb 5000.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I finally got it working.
LEADMALE:No, i already told you, i'm not using it.
LEADMALE:Those are for old people.
LEADMALE:Yeah, for old husbands who are tired of running up and down stairs for their hot, young wives.
SUPMALE:Come on, just until your knee gets better.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:We can't afford that anyway.
OTHERMALE:Take it where you got it and get your money back.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
LEADMALE:I got it for the very reasonable price of "our neighbor died, and they're tearing down his house.
LEADFEMALE:" so, you just went over to his house and stole it? No! I went over to his house to steal his copper plumbing.
LEADMALE:This bad boy was a bonus.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going out.
LEADMALE:See you later.
LEADMALE:Oh, and, granny rose, your ice pack is in my room somewhere.
SUPMALE:I used it to keep my smoothie cold.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, it's a little sticky.
OTHERMALE:Bye! What a delightful and thoughtful young lady.
LEADMALE:We're so lucky she lets us live here.
LEADFEMALE:How the hell am i supposed to get up the stairs to find my ice pack without my ice pack? No, i don't need it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm young and vibrant.
LEADMALE:And they're off! And it's easyclimb versus stubborn housewife.
LEADMALE:Stubborn housewi looking good, but here comes easyclimb up on the rail! shut up, dan! And it's stubborn wife looking back at awesome husband with hatred in her eyes.
LEADMALE:You know, folks, if she loses this race, they may have to put the old nag down.
LEADMALE:Hey, granny rose, can you drop this off in my room? Oh, wow.
SUPMALE:The chair's going up anyway.
LEADFEMALE:You should really sit in it.
SUPMALE:And it's death wish comin' out of nowhere to take it by a nose! becky: emergency! I can't use the laundry room in my building because someone's living there now.
OTHERMALE:Unh-unh, i'm first.
SUPMALE:Harris has been hogging that washing machine, and i'm totally out of clean underwear.
SUPMALE:I'm wearing a coffee filter and a scrunchie.
SUPFEMALE:But i have to be at the restaurant in two hours, and my uniform has blood all over the sleeve.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Bottomless margaritas and a dart tournament.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we can throw our stuff in together.
SUPFEMALE:The machines are both full.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:It's full of harris' stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Damn it! Is there a problem? Yeah, i need to talk to you about your kid.
LEADMALE:Why are harris' clothes in the washing machine? Because that's where it gets all wet and detergent goes on it.
SUPFEMALE:She's been hogging that machine for three days, and we got a lot of people in this house.
LEADMALE:Okay, i get it.
SUPMALE:I'll talk to her as soon as she gets out of the shower.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna wait for your kid? Mom used to yell at us in the shower.
LEADFEMALE:It was like that scene in "psycho".
LEADMALE:Take out the trash! ree! ree! ree! Well, at least norman bates respected his mother.
LEADFEMALE:Ree! Hey, when you do get around to speaking to the princess of tide she needs to respect her elders, or i'll make sure she never becomes one.
OTHERMALE:This is crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll move the clothes into the dryer.
OTHERFEMALE:Bad idea.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, remember the last time we told you to put stuff in the dryer and you threw a pen in there with it? I had one white shirt.
SUPMALE:And then you had one pinstripe shirt.
LEADFEMALE:You shouldn't be doing your kid's chores.
LEADMALE:And when did you turn into such a pushover? You're not being the darlene that we knew and loved and, quite frankly, feared a little bit.
LEADMALE:You know what? You guys already raised your kids.
SUPMALE:You're free.
SUPMALE:Run.
SUPFEMALE:Now would be a great time to finally learn how to use your phones.
SUPFEMALE:There's the old, nasty darlene! Now, quick, before you lose it, go up there and aim it at your kid.
LEADMALE:You want me to yell at her for doing laundry? are you worried she's gonna do the windows next? cut her some slack, okay? Kids don't need slack, they need boundaries.
OTHERMALE:The happiest kids are raised in cages.
OTHERFEMALE:And it keeps the meat tender.
LEADFEMALE:What's that thing? this? It's a vegetable brush.
OTHERFEMALE:It's for getting the dirt off of vegetables.
LEADMALE:Oh, so it's kind of like a hand? Harris: don't set a place for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not staying.
LEADMALE:Why not? We're having clean vegetables.
LEADMALE:Can you clean it hard enough to make it a french fry? I'm meeting some people at the mall.
LEADMALE:We'll grab something there.
LEADFEMALE:Who are these people? You wouldn't know them.
OTHERMALE:I barely know them.
SUPFEMALE:Why you hanging out with people you don't know? Because i've only been here a month, and i didn't inherit your charming personality.
LEADMALE:A little trust here, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Did she just call you "darlene"? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I have no problem with it.
OTHERFEMALE:It's very modern.
LEADFEMALE:It allows the parent and the child to address each other as equals.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, jackie.
SUPMALE:Please call me "aunt jackie.
SUPMALE:" it's the only title that i have.
LEADMALE:You know what, harris, this isn't really about trust, but it's kind of my job to know who you're hanging out with, so i would really like to meet them.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god! You dragged me away from my friends in chicago, and now you're gonna scare off everybody i meet in this hick town? who's gonna shoot beer cans with me behind the dairy queen? Alright, fine.
LEADMALE:Just be home by 10:00, and, uh here's five bucks.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, so she pushed you around a little, but you gave her five bucks.
OTHERMALE:That'll show her.
SUPFEMALE:You had the perfect chance to check out your daughter's friends, and you let her play you like a chump.
LEADMALE:You know what? This is gonna come as a shock to you people, but i actually trust my kids.
LEADFEMALE:Ha! Here's why you can't trust your kids 'cause they're stupid.
SUPMALE:That's why we don't give 'em cars or booze.
LEADMALE:Well, people parent differently than they did in your day.
LEADFEMALE:Turns out, a lot of what you did did not work, and some of it was against the law.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's against the law because your generation made everything so pc.
SUPMALE:Instead of spanking 'em, you tell 'em to go over there and think about what they did wrong.
OTHERMALE:You know what they're thinking? "i can't believe this loser isn't spanking me.
SUPFEMALE:" let me tell you something.
SUPFEMALE:I wrote a poem for my dad, and he hit me with a broom and then he said, "this broom will do more for you than any poem.
LEADFEMALE:" and that was the greatest generation.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he also checked under his bed every night for japanese soldiers, so there you go.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, the dairy queen.
SUPFEMALE:I dated a boy who worked there.
LEADFEMALE:He gave me free dilly bars.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i guess they weren't totally free.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you're snoring! Wake up.
LEADMALE:What time is it? did i miss dinner? It's 11:00.
LEADFEMALE:We slept from "wheel" to "kimmel".
LEADFEMALE:We missed all the shows about black and asian families.
LEADMALE:Mm, they're just like us.
SUPMALE:There, now you're all caught up.
LEADFEMALE:Help me put clothes in the dryer, would you? now? Yeah, harris has had the machine going all day washing them hobo clothes that she wants to sell on, uh, the betsy.
SUPMALE:You know what i think it is? Darlene doesn't want to be the bad guy.
OTHERFEMALE:There was two of us, so we could be good cop, bad cop.
SUPFEMALE:She's just good cop.
SUPMALE:And you know the movie nobody ever, ever wants to see? Mnh-mnh.
LEADFEMALE:"clint eastwood is 'supportive harry'.
SUPMALE:" now, come on.
LEADMALE:Help me up.
SUPFEMALE:We got to go put clothes in the dryer.
OTHERMALE:Ow! Do i have to? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Keep me company.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make it fun.
OTHERMALE:I'll do my "seven veils" dance with the dryer sheets again.
LEADMALE:Tempting.
LEADMALE:And that's what i'll be dreaming of when i'm lying on this here couch.
LEADMALE:Fine, i'll do it myself.
OTHERMALE:Where'd all the real men go? They're hiding from all the real women.
OTHERMALE:Damn! she's hogging the dryer! Leaving all my wet stuff again.
LEADMALE:This is it! harris, it's on! i'm coming up there! fine! i'm on my way! and i mean business! wow! I didn't think that thing would hold together.
SUPMALE:I just tested it with a bag of rock salt.
SUPFEMALE:Look at her go.
LEADMALE:Quit looking at me, dan! I'm not looking at you.
SUPMALE:I'm just checking to see if i had any calls.
LEADMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, granny rose.
LEADMALE:I need some coffee when you come down! can you make me some? roseanne: damn it! you better stay right where you are, if you know what's good for you, harris! i'll be over there in three or four minutes! harris! Why did you put my clean clothes on top of the filthy washing machine? Now i've got to wash them all over again.
LEADFEMALE:I needed the machine.
LEADFEMALE:I just got a bunch of stuff from the thrift store.
SUPFEMALE:Well, here's an idea why not put my stuff in the dryer first? why? It's your stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Get your stuff out of the dryer now.
LEADMALE:I'm having a muffin.
LEADMALE:I'll do it in a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Those are for breakfast.
LEADMALE:But i'm hungry now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're a woman in america.
LEADMALE:Get used to it.
SUPFEMALE:What is your problem? My problem is you're acting like you own the place, and we don't even own the place.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:What? you think you're better than everybody else in this house, don't you? do you really want me to answer that? No, i'll answer it for you you're not! You're smart for a kid, but you're still dumb for a person.
SUPMALE:And you got it real good here.
LEADMALE:We got shampoo and conditioner in separate bottles and we got three fridges if you count the one in the driveway.
LEADMALE:So you better start showing some gratitude instead of acting like an entitled, little bitch.
LEADMALE:You know what? I don't need to get yelled at by some stupid, old hillbilly.
OTHERMALE:Hey! what?! I want you to rinse off this plate in the sink.
OTHERFEMALE:Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to the hillbilly day spa! mom! stop! what are you doing? Your hellspawn threw all my clean clothes on top of the dirty washing machine, and then she called me a stupid hillbilly! i was being nice! she's a crazy, stupid hillbilly! You apologize to your grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:And old! she said "old"! say it! i'm sorry! god! Great.
LEADMALE:Now you tell your kid to get her stuff out of the dryer so i can finish my laundry and go to sleep.
LEADMALE:Fun grandma loses her cool if she gets less than eight hours.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine! Listen, she was wrong, but you are not her parent.
LEADMALE:How could you do something like that? It wasn't that hard.
LEADMALE:You just get her by the neck and lean into it, you know and then you keep the sprayer going like so.
OTHERMALE:The dryer is empty now.
LEADMALE:Happy? I will talk to you upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Hold up.
LEADMALE:Hey! that's mine! give me that! Not so fast.
OTHERFEMALE:So, they left a security tag on from the thrift store? They left one on.
LEADMALE:Big deal.
SUPMALE:This is not from a thrift store, harris.
LEADMALE:They don't put security tags on clothes that cost less than security tags.
SUPMALE:Did you steal this? No, i got it from some kids at school.
SUPFEMALE:So they stole it? Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Who cares? I just am selling it on my store.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know you can go to jail for selling things that are stolen online? are you stupid? Yes! they told me i couldn't get in any trouble! I just wanted to make some money because my life sucks.
LEADMALE:Hey, all our lives suck.
SUPFEMALE:That's why we put marshmallows on yams.
SUPFEMALE:You know what? You are not helping.
LEADFEMALE:Please just let me talk to harris alone for a second.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:I'm just gonna check around this house to see if any of my stuff is missing.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of my clothes turned vintage.
SUPMALE:Sit.
LEADFEMALE:God! i trusted you! you know? I mean, you completely betrayed that! i was going easy on you because i felt guilty about bringing you here! well, you shouldn't have brought me here because i hate it! I have no friends.
SUPMALE:The kids here are idiots.
LEADFEMALE:Who leaves security tags on stolen clothes? God, i'm sorry your henchmen are stupid, riddler.
LEADMALE:I mean, what what is so important to you that you would go on this crime spree? I needed money to go back and live in chicago.
SUPMALE:I already bought my bus ticket, and anna's sister said i can live with her in her apartment if i chip in for rent.
LEADFEMALE:I was planning on leaving at the end of the month.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Part of me wants to ask how big anna's sister's apartment is, but let's go to a healthier place here.
LEADFEMALE:Are you really that miserable? I yes, i miss my friends.
LEADMALE:I don't belong here.
LEADMALE:If you make me stay i'm gonna hate you.
LEADMALE:Well, then, that's how it's gonna be.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, i'm not a huge fan of yours right now, either.
LEADFEMALE:But we are in this together, okay? We came here because our family needed support.
OTHERMALE:And you know what? No matter what you think of those crazy, old, stupid hillbillies, they will get in the pickup truck, and they will pull you out of any well that you fall into.
LEADMALE:I didn't fall into a well.
LEADMALE:Grandma sprayed me with a hose.
LEADMALE:Alright, well, now you see why you need her on your side, right? I'm gonna make you a deal.
LEADMALE:If you're still miserable in three years, you can move back to chicago.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Oh, thank you so much, mom.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE:Wait in three years, i'll be 18, and i can do whatever i want anyways.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm trying to work with you here.
OTHERFEMALE:But you know i still have to punish you, right? So you're not leaving this house for three weeks, you are closing down the etsy store, and you're giving me all your passwords to all your accounts for everything.
LEADFEMALE:How about none of that happens, but i just lose your trust? Passwords.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:But just know that there are some things on my private instagram account that are less than flattering about you.
LEADFEMALE:Ditto.
LEADFEMALE:Housekeeping.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, before you say anything, i let my guard down, and i shouldn't have.
SUPFEMALE:So lesson learned.
SUPMALE:Well, don't be too hard on yourself.
OTHERMALE:You stepped up when you needed to.
SUPFEMALE:You know, we all want to believe the best in people, but the truth is, kids lie, people cheat and you don't want to be the one that gets eaten by the bear.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Was that one of your poems? 'cause i'm starting to get why your dad hit you with a broom.
LEADMALE:Your father's just trying to say that, you know, it's not easy, and you did a good job.
SUPMALE:The whole parenting thing is kind of learn-as-you-go.
SUPMALE:And there's no books on how to raise kids.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, there are.
LEADFEMALE:There are literally thousands.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but it's not like they're just laying around for free where anybody can pick them up and read them.
LEADMALE:Yes, you can.
LEADMALE:There's a library two blocks from here.
SUPMALE:That's a "liberry"? Okay, you guys are hilarious, but you will be happy to hear that i got all of her passwords.
LEADFEMALE:Now you're talkin'.
LEADFEMALE:Let's fire up this mo-chine and see what we're dealing with here.
SUPFEMALE:Rose, it's okay for her mom to check up on her, but we're just snooping.
SUPFEMALE:Move over, girls! Roseanne: hey, you almost done in there? I put all my dirty clothes in the hamper, i washed my breakfast dishes and mark's, and i closed my etsy account.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you almost done in there? You got people waitin'.
LEADFEMALE:I think i deserve a nice, long shower after all that.
OTHERFEMALE:Wrong answer.
SUPFEMALE:Hand me the soap, would you? oh, my god! ha ha! Oh, what? You're too good to shower with your grandma?
SUPFEMALE:Hellooo.
LEADFEMALE:Who wants to meet armani? Aww, he's cute.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you already had the baby.
LEADMALE:This is your aunt darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you want to pet him? I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm allergic.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, you're not allergic.
SUPFEMALE:Mom just said that 'cause she didn't want a dog in the house.
LEADMALE:I could've had a dog? Yeah, you could've had seafood, too.
SUPMALE:It's just expensive.
LEADMALE:Damn it! i love dogs! So, a dog.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Because today i'm going to andrea's fancy fertility doctor, and he's gonna give us a calendar for my embryo transfer, and then i'm gonna have a baby, and then i'm gonna get $50,000, and then i'm gonna get a house with a yard, and since i'm getting a yard, i can finally get a dog like i always dreamed of.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:So you did the last part first.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you've inspired me.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go dive into a swimming pool and then fill it with water.
LEADFEMALE:You are so damn negative! It serves you right that while i'm in my nice, new house with my nice, new dog, you'll be living here in this mongolian cockfight that's our childhood home.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, want to be my lamaze coach? Oh, yeah, lamaze classes i'd go to those just for the movie they show you.
LEADFEMALE:It's like "carrie", but after the bucket of blood, they hit her with a baby.
OTHERMALE:No, i am not giving any more money to your organization.
LEADMALE:And stop with those sad commercials.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot enjoy my snacks! Mom got caught eating candy out of the bulk bins at the grocery store not a good time.
LEADFEMALE:This is my new dog, armani.
OTHERMALE:We were just leaving to go to andrea's doctor.
LEADFEMALE:What are you telling me for? You know how i feel about this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a little nervous.
LEADMALE:I was hoping you might wish me luck.
SUPMALE:You're gonna need it.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner babies have huge heads.
OTHERFEMALE:You had an uncle who never even got out.
SUPFEMALE:His legs just eventually grew long enough to touch the ground.
SUPMALE:Will you stop it? You're not gonna scare me out of this.
LEADMALE:Well, you're too damn bone-headed to listen to reason.
LEADMALE:What if this is the one baby you can have? You've just not thinking this through.
OTHERMALE:I don't want a baby.
LEADMALE:I have a dog.
SUPFEMALE:You know what? I'm not coming over here again.
SUPMALE:Can you believe that? And she was the smart one.
SUPFEMALE:You know what? Even as an adult, i can't hear that enough.
LEADFEMALE:"roseanne" was taped in front of a live studio audience.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, we're almost done with the medical-history sections.
LEADFEMALE:So, next question is hep-c, hep-b, hiv, stds? No, no, no, and not anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, terminated pregnancies? Zero.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on! aunt jackie! I just know that you were "popular," like i was, so i assumed okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, ladies! Sorry, i was at the hormone specialist.
LEADMALE:He says i'm gonna have no problem producing my own breast milk.
LEADFEMALE:I have very porous nipples.
SUPMALE:Lucky! So, before we go in, i have a small gift for you.
SUPFEMALE:It's just a little "thank you" for the gift that you're giving me.
LEADMALE:Aww.
LEADFEMALE:It's a bedazzled egg.
LEADMALE:That's not just an egg.
LEADFEMALE:That is really expensive.
LEADMALE:That's a "fuh-berj" egg.
SUPMALE:It's uh, it's fabergã©.
LEADFEMALE:And what'd i say? Thank you.
LEADMALE:Becky conner-healy? Here we go, team! here we go! Alright.
OTHERMALE:Let's get in there and put the "us" in "uterus".
LEADFEMALE:I don't hear the pitter-patter of little feet.
LEADMALE:Where are the loud, small things? Oh, it's really funny.
LEADMALE:One of the mothers mentioned an indoor water park in passing and so i shoved mark into her van as they were rolling away.
OTHERFEMALE:What about harris? I know where one of them is.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you give me a break? Hey.
SUPMALE:Where are you going? you know what? Just because i live here does not mean you have the right to ask what i'm doing or where i'm going.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go wherever i want and do whatever i want.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:But seriously, where are you going? Alright, fine.
LEADFEMALE:I got a job interview at build-a-bear.
LEADMALE:I-i guess it's between me and some high-school kid.
SUPFEMALE:Fingers crossed.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dan.
LEADMALE:Did you know you can go on the internet and get anybody's address and also their phone number? No, but i know if you're looking for work, don't click on fantasypositions.
LEADFEMALE:Com.
SUPMALE:There's people working, alright, but it ain't a job site.
LEADFEMALE:Whom are you stalking, my pet? That andrea person.
SUPFEMALE:She's not getting a conner baby.
LEADMALE:What are you gonna do? I'm gonna go tell her that becky is 43 years old.
LEADFEMALE:And once andrea finds out that she lied, that'll shut the whole thing down.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
LEADFEMALE:Lookneither of us wants this to happen, but she's a grown woman and she's made it clear we don't have anything to give her, so we shouldn't be standing in her way.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so what? now you're on her side? did you see the look in her eyes when she thought she had the money for some kind of future? We got no right to tell her she can't take $50,000.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not gonna tell her.
LEADFEMALE:That's why i'm going to see andrea.
LEADMALE:No, you're not! you're gonna stop interfering with becky, and you're gonna do it now! Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you want for lunch? Something that was prepared, cooked, and sealed at another location.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Something quick you can microwave.
LEADFEMALE:I can do that.
LEADMALE:Ding! Okay.
SUPMALE:Usually, the next step is to start monitoring your cycle to see when you need to take the hormone shots so we can move toward fertilization i can't wait.
LEADMALE:But here's what i found her eggs aren't acting their age.
SUPMALE:Not acting their age in a good way, like like cher? The eggs are poor quality.
LEADMALE:You may be 33, but you have the eggs of a much older woman.
SUPFEMALE:What does that mean? i can still have a baby, right? Even with interventions, i'd say you have less than a 5% chance of ever getting pregnant.
SUPMALE:I know you've both been looking forward to this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'll give you all a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Look, becky, i really appreciate everything you've done.
SUPFEMALE:It's just i'm not getting any younger.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess there's really nothing else left to say.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I think we're just gonna sit here for a moment, kind of take all this in.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:I understand.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we just walk away with the things we brought into the relationship.
OTHERFEMALE:But there's also things we've given each other that remain with us forever.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, look, i feel terrible, but i really have to have the egg back.
OTHERMALE:It's too soon.
LEADFEMALE:She'll send it to you.
OTHERFEMALE:No, here.
SUPMALE:It doesn't matter anyway.
LEADMALE:Ahhhhhh.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck with everything, becky.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, you too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, becky.
LEADMALE:I am so sorry.
OTHERMALE:You alright? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I think i need a minute.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Take all the time you need.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, um, you're gonna be mad at me.
LEADFEMALE:I took becky to the fertility doctor today.
OTHERMALE:But it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:She's not going through with it anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Thank god.
SUPMALE:How'd you talk her out of it? I didn't.
LEADMALE:The doctor said the odds of her getting pregnant are slim to none.
LEADMALE:Fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you get him to say that? No.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, it's for real.
SUPFEMALE:Her eggs are too old.
LEADFEMALE:So you mean she can never have a baby? Ah, damn.
SUPFEMALE:Becky: hello? I'm only here to pick up my laundry.
LEADFEMALE:Let her tell you, roseanne, okay? Hey, becky.
SUPMALE:Jackie told us everything.
LEADMALE:Aunt jackie! roseanne! We are not discussing this.
SUPMALE:You don't know what i'm gonna say.
SUPFEMALE:Becky: yes, i do.
LEADMALE:You're gonna tell me how happy you are about this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm happy that you're not giving a baby away, if that's what you mean, but that's not what i and then you're gonna tell me how wrong i was and how i lied and it blew up in my face.
SUPFEMALE:I'm getting punished enough, mother.
LEADMALE:I'm not getting the house, so i have to take armani back to the rescue.
OTHERFEMALE:God knows what's gonna happen to him.
SUPFEMALE:Can you just let me talk? And you're just no! I know what you're gonna say.
OTHERFEMALE:"becky made another stupid decision.
SUPMALE:Mom was right.
OTHERMALE:Mom's always right".
LEADMALE:Becky, let your mom talk.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:She said plenty.
LEADMALE:Now you're getting all riled up and you're not even listening.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now you know how i feel about you all the time.
LEADFEMALE:I've learned in most fights, people just aren't clear enough you are a selfish, old woman! Okay, good.
OTHERMALE:That's you don't know what it was like sitting there, hearing what they said.
SUPFEMALE:You weren't there.
LEADFEMALE:You don't care about me.
LEADMALE:I do care! That's why i wanted you to keep that baby so you could experience all the joys of motherhood that i'm feeling right now.
LEADFEMALE:And we still have stuff to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, you're finally wrong about something.
SUPMALE:Becky! damn it! She'll come around, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:It's been a bad day.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And i made it worse.
LEADFEMALE:I need you to go back to that rescue place and get becky's dog back.
LEADFEMALE:It's the least i can do.
LEADMALE:Why can't you go? I have an uber run! She can't keep it at her apartment.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:That's why you need to keep it at your place so she can take it later.
OTHERMALE:I'm getting a dog?! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, jackie, look what i found.
OTHERMALE:It's a leash for armani.
LEADMALE:Dj used to use it when he took his blanket out for a walk.
LEADFEMALE:They'd rather put armani down than let me love him.
SUPMALE:They said that i wasn't fit to rescue him.
OTHERMALE:What? why would they say that? You're the perfect match.
OTHERMALE:You have no one to love and no one to love you.
LEADMALE:Right? And then they said i was too old and i should get a senior dog so he wouldn't have to go through the trauma of grieving my death.
LEADMALE:Are they still open? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:I just got a text from becky.
LEADFEMALE:Where is she? She's at work.
SUPMALE:She told me what happened.
LEADMALE:And according to the text, she's "wasted as duck.
OTHERFEMALE:" i'm gonna head over there.
LEADMALE:Where are you guys going? To that stupid rescue place.
LEADFEMALE:We're getting becky's dog back.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna keep him for becky, and they rejected me.
LEADMALE:Why? You'd be perfect.
LEADMALE:You're so lonely.
LEADMALE:You got so much free time on your hands.
LEADMALE:Your house is empty.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes you don't talk to people for days don't bother, darlene! I already comforted her.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind if i sit down and catch up to you? Mm.
LEADMALE:Emilio, a margarita and three shots of cuervo.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:I was worried i didn't have plans tomorrow, and now i know i'll be projectile vomiting.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'll be working here tomorrow and the rest of my life, listening to white people order "fah-jee-tas".
SUPFEMALE:Let me give you some advice from a 40-year-old woman with two kids who still lives at her parents' house, that was just told this afternoon she's not "build-a-bear" material.
LEADFEMALE:I have a better idea.
SUPMALE:Put one of these in your mouth.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, wednesday.
SUPMALE:Ugh.
LEADFEMALE:The conner sisters are failing! How did we get here? how about this? You tell me what's wrong with me and i'll tell you what's wrong with you.
SUPFEMALE:That's a terrible idea.
OTHERMALE:Okay, my turn.
SUPMALE:You still act like you're in your 20s.
LEADMALE:You go out and get "lit".
SUPFEMALE:You've shopped at forever 21 for at least two 21s.
SUPMALE:Oh, and you take bathroom selfies.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh! Let's take one.
LEADMALE:I can put whiskers on you and make you look like a cat.
LEADMALE:Ready now your drink looks like a cat.
LEADMALE:Aww, it's a meow-garita.
LEADMALE:Holy crap, we're different.
LEADMALE:Hello? you're still open, right? Excuse me, ma'am.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what your problem is, but this woman would be a damn good owner for that dog.
OTHERFEMALE:And it's not fair that you just took it away.
LEADMALE:Like i said earlier, we have rules to protect the dog.
SUPMALE:What if your sister dies? I'll be sad, but i'll move on.
OTHERFEMALE:We have nothing else to talk about here.
SUPFEMALE:Come on! This woman wants a dog, and that dog needs a home.
OTHERFEMALE:How hard is that for you to figure out? I'm sorry, but there are restrictions on who can get a dog.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just go, roseanne.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Can you just let this sad, old biddy say goodbye one last time to the only thing that's shown her affection in a decade? Only if you promise you'll leave.
LEADFEMALE:We'll leave.
SUPMALE:We're going to a real pet store, where you can buy a dog and do whatever you want with it! Okay, you have one minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, there you are, baby boy! oh, there you are, baby! ooh! Go, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:What? We're taking the dog.
LEADFEMALE:Go! hey, hey, hey! Do do not take that dog.
LEADMALE:I will call the police.
LEADMALE:Do you have any idea who you're talking to? That is officer jacqueline harris of the lanford pd.
OTHERFEMALE:So go ahead and call the cops and tell them their sister in blue is saving a puppy! run, jackie! Alright, so how else did i screw up my life? Bring it.
SUPFEMALE:Alright, hold on.
LEADFEMALE:There's a lot here to pick from.
LEADMALE:I feel if i start with you "dating your teachers", i'm giving short shrift to the tube-top years.
LEADFEMALE:Although i do believe the two are connected.
SUPMALE:My life wasn't supposed to turn out like this.
SUPFEMALE:Mark and i were gonna have kids.
LEADFEMALE:What? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We were trying.
LEADMALE:Like all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wow, becky.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know that.
LEADMALE:I just assumed you never wanted kids 'cause you never had any.
LEADMALE:No, i just never met anyone after who i wanted to have them with.
LEADFEMALE:You never meet anybody, or you never try to meet anybody? No, i just never met anybody as good.
LEADFEMALE:I have high standards.
SUPMALE:Really? how many people that work here have you had a one-night stand with? Geez, you sound like my manager.
LEADMALE:So what if i have a little fun? I'm young.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:You're like a young old person.
LEADMALE:Or like an old young person.
LEADMALE:You know, you're kind of kind of stuck in the middle.
LEADMALE:I-i don't know if you can see yourself frozen in the same place since mark died, but everybody else can.
LEADMALE:You know, becky it's not betraying mark to move on.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the uber is here.
LEADFEMALE:Should i cancel it? No, i should stop.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: hey, your driver's here.
LEADFEMALE:You don't look like allen in a chevy sonic.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:He called me.
LEADMALE:We have a deal he doesn't pick up my kids, and i don't pick up his "drunk whore of a wife".
LEADFEMALE:His words, not mine.
SUPMALE:I need to sit.
LEADMALE:Give your mom a chance.
LEADMALE:Darlene, let's go pick out a song.
SUPMALE:We haven't danced in like forever.
LEADFEMALE:That's because it's creepy.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to give your mother and your sister some space.
LEADFEMALE:Just do it.
LEADMALE:Well, i have a couple of things i want to say mom, i can't right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes, i'm a selfish, old woman.
SUPMALE:Okay, i can.
LEADMALE:I get real stubborn about what i want and i forget that there are other people, and apparently they want stuff, too.
LEADFEMALE:But the point is, i-i should've gone to the doctor with you.
LEADFEMALE:I should've been there for you.
LEADMALE:Thanks, but it wouldn't have changed anything.
OTHERMALE:I can't have kids.
LEADFEMALE:You said you didn't want kids.
LEADMALE:I thought i had more time.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe the doctor's wrong.
LEADMALE:I had a kid in my 40s.
OTHERMALE:It usually happens when you least expect it and when you're least prepared for it.
LEADMALE:That happened to me every single time.
OTHERMALE:Well, one of you i wanted.
OTHERFEMALE:Which one? You.
SUPMALE:Oh, i've got something i want to show you.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this.
SUPMALE:It's your, uh, crazy aunt jackie sharing a popsicle with your dog.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's armani! She's gonna keep him for you 'til you can take him.
LEADMALE:They look so happy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, it's all good now 'til jackie starts asking him where this is all headed.
LEADMALE:You want a drink, mom? Oh, i shouldn't.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Ahh.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh! you're driving! alright, i'll give it a shot, but don't tell mom! How's the dog training going? No, we don't call it "training".
SUPMALE:We call it "behavior sculpting".
LEADMALE:Watch.
LEADFEMALE:Armani, sit.
LEADMALE:Good boy! See? I've taught him to be an independent thinker, not just do what people tell him to do.
LEADFEMALE:So he he's really not trained at all.
LEADMALE:Armani do you want to lie down, or do you have other things to do? see? He's his own dog.
OTHERMALE:Tell me to stay and watch some more.
LEADMALE:Stay and watch some more.
LEADFEMALE:Good job, dan! 
LEADMALE:Man, we are so lucky that shopmore lets us scan our own groceries.
SUPFEMALE:Now we can shop without the hassle of anybody helping us at all! beep! Mom, that didn't go through.
OTHERFEMALE:I heard it beep.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:You're stealing that.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:They're making me work as a checkout lady, and my starting salary is bacon.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:This young lady just smashed the lids on all these cakes in the bakery section.
LEADMALE:Did you do that? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Security camera caught you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then, say that first.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'll pay for these.
LEADFEMALE:Harris, why don't you just go wait outside? Oh, damn it.
SUPFEMALE:It's david.
LEADFEMALE:That's why she smashed the cakes.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Get a summer beach body.
SUPMALE:What's going on? He just texted to say he's coming tomorrow for harris' birthday party.
OTHERFEMALE:He must have already texted her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she should be happy to see her father.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, sure, if he actually shows up.
SUPFEMALE:And he only showed up like three times in chicago.
LEADMALE:And the anxiety of whether he's gonna be here or not really messes with her head.
LEADFEMALE:I just have a feeling that harris isn't gonna be disappointed this year.
LEADFEMALE:I think david is gonna show up.
LEADMALE:Why would you think that? Psh.
SUPMALE:No reason.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:You're in touch with david behind my back.
LEADMALE:That is so wrong! Well, david's kinda like my son and you're kinda like my daughter, so of course i'm involved.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want him knowing everything about my life.
SUPMALE:All's i told him is that you lost your job, you haven't met anybody, and sometimes you're depressed.
SUPMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:I'll buy those cakes.
LEADMALE:Hit it, mary.
SUPFEMALE:Beep! "roseanne" is taped in front of a live audience.
LEADFEMALE:I talked to harris.
LEADFEMALE:She's doing better.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't realize she messed 'em up that bad.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not all harris.
SUPMALE:You know, i needed to see what was inside some of them.
LEADMALE:Uh, i almost wasted my time fixing up a carrot cake.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry i yelled at you at the market.
LEADFEMALE:This is just really hard for me.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:You know, david's made a lot of mistakes, but he's still a good person.
LEADFEMALE:And i want my grandkids to have a father.
SUPFEMALE:You think i don't want that? I don't even like kids.
LEADFEMALE:He's the only person i ever wanted to replicate with.
LEADFEMALE:Have you told him that? 'cause talk like that drives men wild.
LEADMALE:How can you defend him? He's been running around the world building houses for poor people in third-world countries.
LEADMALE:Does that sound like a good person to you? Okay.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:But he's a bad person, too.
SUPFEMALE:David can't just walk in here like everything's fine now.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, he can walk in here.
LEADMALE:Just won't be able to walk out.
LEADFEMALE:You can't keep him from seeing his kids, dan.
SUPFEMALE:He's their father.
SUPMALE:Well, if he acted like it, he'd be welcome here.
LEADMALE:There is no reason to ever leave your family.
SUPFEMALE:You may think about it, you may dream about it you may gas up your bike and make sandwiches but you don't ever do it.
SUPFEMALE:So that's what you did that day! I knew there was no "drywall convention.
LEADMALE:" i've said too much.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie: i got it! Hello, jackie.
LEADMALE:You look tired.
LEADFEMALE:Nice outfit.
OTHERFEMALE:I see you're trying it without the sickle.
LEADMALE:Hey, roseanne! looks like that "putting mom in a home" thing didn't stick! Mom, what are you doing here? what's with the suitcases? The retirement home asked me to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Why? did they figure out you're never gonna die? what did you do? Nothing but live my life.
LEADFEMALE:I watch tv, i play cards, i have an occasional drink, but apparently at my age i am not supposed to enjoy a healthy sex life.
SUPMALE:With multiple partners in multiple parts of the facility.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:What? I had sex.
SUPFEMALE:Is that so difficult to imagine? Not anymore.
LEADMALE:Now it's hard to stop imagining.
SUPMALE:They said i can go back if i write a letter of apology, and i am not ready to do that.
LEADMALE:Now, if you don't mind, i need to get some sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you do.
LEADMALE:What the hell are you doing out there? I told you i was coming.
LEADMALE:I need to talk to you.
LEADMALE:Give me one good reason why i should let you in.
LEADFEMALE:'cause i'm gonna fall.
SUPMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:I'm vegan now.
OTHERMALE:I have no upper-arm strength.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you coming in the window, anyway? does your dad still live here? yeah? That's why i'm coming in through the window.
LEADMALE:Are you okay? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i just need to put my hands on my knees and breathe hard for a second.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, wow.
LEADMALE:Aww.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:They kept everything exactly the same as it was when you guys were kids.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, it's a decorating choice called "poverty.
SUPFEMALE:" so what'd you want to talk about? Something i think you'll be happy to hear.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i've heard it before, david you miss me, you want to get back together, then as soon as things get real, you run back to deadbeats without borders.
LEADMALE:Not this time.
LEADMALE:I just, uh i just signed a lease.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm moving back to lanford.
LEADFEMALE:See? I realized it's not too late to fix things.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:It's over on fourth.
SUPFEMALE:That's so nice.
SUPMALE:It's right by mark's school.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:I met someone.
SUPMALE:You met someone? how'd you meet someone? Uh, i was somewhere, and she was there, too.
SUPMALE:It's not that unusual really.
OTHERFEMALE:Her name's blue, and i've learned so much from her.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:So we're just gonna blow right past the whole blue thing? I was hoping to, yeah.
LEADMALE:She's made me see so many things.
SUPFEMALE:I-i realized i was in denial.
LEADFEMALE:I thought harris and mark were better off without me.
OTHERFEMALE:And then i realized how unfair it is, to you, not to give you a divorce so you can have some closure.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:So let me get this straight.
SUPFEMALE:While i have been picking up kids' clothes, dealing with meltdowns, cleaning up vomit, you're dating a crayon?! I know.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:But she's really good for me.
LEADMALE:And t-that's just gonna make me be better for you and the kids.
SUPFEMALE:So how serious is this thing? Mm.
OTHERFEMALE:Blue says she won't merge our spiritual paths until you and i sign divorce papers.
OTHERMALE:Okay, so, what if i don't want a divorce? why wouldn't you? We both hate me.
LEADFEMALE:I-i don't know how i feel about you, david.
SUPMALE:You come in here, you throw all this stuff at me i thought you would want this.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't mean to stress you out.
LEADFEMALE:Now i'm stressed out.
SUPMALE:Okay, now i'm stressed out and turned on.
OTHERFEMALE:What am i gonna tell blue? Tell her she's got a stupid name.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? Studying your face.
LEADMALE:Why? You look like my kids.
SUPFEMALE:That's weird.
SUPFEMALE:You look like mine.
LEADMALE:You know you're gonna have to talk to blue.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:And you're really done running around saving the world? you got that out of your system? I got dysentery in angola.
LEADMALE:That gets everything out of your system.
OTHERMALE:You know, when i left you and the kids, i rationalized that it was okay because i was helping people.
LEADMALE:The truth is, i left because my brother died and i was overwhelmed with all the responsibility and i i just ran.
SUPMALE:And once i was out there, i was ashamed, and i-i frankly, i didn't expect for you to let me talk this long, so well, you were finally being honest with yourself, so i didn't want to spook ya.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You got to go.
LEADMALE:My dad will be up by now.
LEADMALE:I'll call you after i talk to him if it's safe to come back over.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You know what? She's my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:I'm coming to her party no matter what.
OTHERMALE:David, it's really cute when you assert yourself, but let me just prepare my dad for this.
LEADFEMALE:Cute? Come on.
LEADMALE:Don't why do you always have to belittle me like that? I'm a grown man.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:God.
LEADMALE:Don't be so sensitive.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me what not to be.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Then do be less sensitive.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:How about this? You be less controlling, and i'll be less sensitive.
SUPFEMALE:You know what? Let's not do this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I-it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't been around me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a different person now.
LEADMALE:Other than your father, i'm not so easily intimidated.
LEADFEMALE:You know what they called me in guatemala? I don't know either 'cause it was in spanish, but they said it with incredible respect.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, hotshot, but if my dad finds you, they're gonna call me "el widow blanco.
SUPMALE:" i told you, i don't speak spanish.
LEADMALE:It's so great hanging out with you girls.
SUPMALE:I missed this.
SUPFEMALE:Us too.
LEADFEMALE:You know what we should do, roseanne? Um, we should have you visit mom more often when she goes back to the home.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh i suppose this is as good a time as any to break the bad news.
SUPMALE:Make it short, but painful, and not hereditary.
LEADFEMALE:I can't go back to the home.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna have to stay here with you girls.
LEADFEMALE:Painful for her! for her! What are you talking about, mom? You said you could go back if you apologized.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, that's not the whole truth.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, they said that i am "a danger to others.
SUPFEMALE:" i gave a couple of the men a little gonorrhea.
SUPFEMALE:Well, i think this is for the better.
SUPMALE:I was starting to feel that you had forgotten me entirely.
LEADFEMALE:No, mom, i haven't forgotten you.
SUPFEMALE:There's just been so much going on, with darlene moving back in and her kids.
LEADFEMALE:And you? you really want to get into it? Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Is dad home yet? No, he went to pick up some pain pills for my knee.
LEADMALE:When's that situation gonna change? Uh, as soon as one of you girls marries an orthopedic surgeon.
SUPMALE:Or a drug dealer.
LEADMALE:I know where the smart money is.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's gonna have to be becky.
LEADMALE:Because, uh, david stopped by last night.
LEADFEMALE:We hung out and we talked, and i think we're gonna work things out.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god! you slept with him?! It's one thing for grandma to be having sex with some veiny-legged old guy.
LEADFEMALE:But you and your husband? That's disgusting! I need a bloody mary.
LEADMALE:Why would you do that? uh, what do you mean? Try to get back together with david.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? You said he was a good person.
LEADFEMALE:I said i should give him another chance.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i meant as a father, not as a husband.
LEADFEMALE:You guys are a disaster as a couple.
LEADMALE:It's like dr.
SUPFEMALE:Jekyll and mr.
LEADFEMALE:Hyde.
LEADFEMALE:And david.
OTHERMALE:He's different now.
OTHERFEMALE:He's totally self-aware.
LEADFEMALE:He realized the only reason he left the first time around was because he couldn't handle the pressures of fatherhood.
SUPFEMALE:That's not why he left.
LEADMALE:He left because you guys were fighting all the time, and that's what he couldn't handle.
SUPFEMALE:What? You don't know that.
SUPMALE:I do know.
OTHERMALE:He told me.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:I think i know a little bit more about this than you do.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:You're gonna do what you're gonna do.
LEADMALE:You know, i'm just trying to help you have a happy life, you know, so you don't get so blue.
LEADFEMALE:If you need me, i'm gonna be in the driveway waiting for my pain pills.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not a bloody mary.
LEADMALE:They have vodka, but they don't have tomato juice or tabasco.
LEADMALE:I'm just calling this a mary.
LEADMALE:Cheers.
SUPMALE:Mom's trying to blow up me and david.
LEADMALE:She's telling me there's no way our relationship can work.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:I love david.
LEADMALE:But you guys have been going at this for 20 years.
SUPFEMALE:It's like that ham radio dad tinkers with in the garage.
SUPFEMALE:If it was gonna work, it would've worked by now.
LEADFEMALE:Dad just got that radio working.
LEADFEMALE:He's got a friend in duluth that's 102.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, fine.
SUPFEMALE:You know what? Then just keep tinkering, darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what, so now i'm supposed to take advice from you, becky? No.
LEADFEMALE:Take advice from you.
LEADMALE:Position, feel thyself.
LEADFEMALE:None of those words are right.
OTHERMALE:And i don't know what you're talking about.
SUPMALE:You told me i never moved on after mark died.
LEADMALE:End the misery.
LEADFEMALE:Grieve and get on with your life.
OTHERFEMALE:Your words.
SUPMALE:David didn't die.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but your marriage did.
SUPMALE:Thanks to your advice, i'm getting ready for a second date with a really nice guy tonight.
LEADMALE:Doesn't smoke.
SUPFEMALE:He's not married, has all his own teeth.
LEADMALE:If you're so happy, how come you're drinking before the date? Because i have a drinking problem.
SUPFEMALE:Dad? Wow.
LEADFEMALE:You came.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Did the world run out of poor people? No, it's worse than it's ever been.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, happy birthday.
LEADFEMALE:I-i brought you something.
LEADFEMALE:It's a t-shirt.
LEADFEMALE:"love one an' otter.
SUPMALE:" cute.
OTHERMALE:I-it's from an aquarium in in costa rica.
LEADMALE:'cause i know you love animals and you wear t-shirts.
SUPMALE:Uh, so, good news.
SUPMALE:Uh, i'm moving to lanford.
OTHERFEMALE:Your mom and i, we're we're good.
LEADFEMALE:So i-i'm gonna be here all the time.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:You have enough guilt to buy me some weed? No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I have enough guilt to buy you ice cream.
SUPMALE:Baby steps.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:We've got a lot of cake.
SUPFEMALE:I told you to wait for my call.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I just i got excited.
SUPFEMALE:So, let's go give everyone the good news.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think your dad will kill me in front of the kids.
OTHERMALE:David.
LEADFEMALE:There's no good news.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? It's just not gonna work.
SUPMALE:Sure it is.
SUPFEMALE:We worked last night.
SUPMALE:First of all, i remember doing most of the work.
OTHERMALE:The truth is, we're delusional if we think we can make each other happy.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna fight, you're gonna run, and we're gonna break the kids' hearts.
LEADMALE:We talked.
LEADFEMALE:We know what went wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:We belong together.
SUPMALE:You're the first person i loved, and i still love you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too, you know, and if it was just us, i swear i would keep doing this over and over again, even if it never worked.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not just us.
OTHERFEMALE:You okay? I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Hello, david.
LEADMALE:Hey, dan.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:Sir.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:H-h-how are you doing? I've been better.
SUPFEMALE:I hear you're moving back to lanford.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a place.
SUPMALE:I'll be back permanently in two weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Then that's when you'll see the kids.
LEADMALE:Questions? comments? No, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You always were a smart boy.
LEADMALE:So what now? You're gonna do what you came here to do.
OTHERMALE:You're gonna be a great father.
LEADFEMALE:You can do that, right? Yeah, i can.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Mark's got a parent-teacher night in a month.
LEADMALE:So you be there.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:What's mark like? He's, uh, really artistic, very sweet, like you.
LEADFEMALE:And he likes to wear dresses.
OTHERMALE:So now you're all caught up.
OTHERMALE:You goin'? Didn't go so well.
LEADFEMALE:It could've gone a lot worse.
SUPMALE:Luckily we're a very forgiving family.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, i guess you're gonna have to forgive us for that.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I am gonna do the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:You better, 'cause if you don't, there's not gonna be anybody left in this house to be on your side.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're a quality person, david.
OTHERMALE:I want you to prove me right.
LEADMALE:I will.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:David? Yes, mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner? Tuck in your shirt there.
LEADFEMALE:You're not 15 anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:The rules are simple hands behind your backs, first one to finish their cake wins.
SUPMALE:Okay, if i go into diabetic shock, i want you to get my insulin pen and then you know, quick and then point me back to my cake.
LEADFEMALE:And go! This is the most disgusting thing i've ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:Really? My guess it's not.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, did you know mom sleepwalks? Oh, that's dangerous.
OTHERMALE:I heard if you leave your front door open, a sleepwalker can wander right out into traffic.
SUPFEMALE:I'm talking wide open.
LEADMALE:But you know what the weird thing is? She's actually really nice when she's sleepwalking.
SUPFEMALE:She asked me how i was doing and said i had nice skin.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Then she woke up and said, "where the hell am i," and told me i ruined my children.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, girls.
SUPMALE:Good morning, mom.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? Well, i didn't sleep a wink with all the noise in this house and that lumpy old bed that you've got me sleeping on.
OTHERMALE:But i grew up in the depression, so i'm not a complainer.
SUPMALE:Although, this is worse.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i hear jackie's apartment is nice and quiet.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No! Mom seems very happy here.
OTHERMALE:And i know that roseanne wants to spend more time with her since she's been in the home for a while.
LEADMALE:Don't you think bev would be much more comfortable in your spare bedroom? Mom! Mom, they're done.
OTHERFEMALE:The beans are ground, mom! they're dust! Would it be rude of me if i were to take my coffee in my room? Go for it.
LEADMALE:Absolutely not.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta take her.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Not a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Possession is nine tenths of the law.
SUPMALE:It's not the law when you don't want the thing that you possess.
LEADFEMALE:Now, she's only here because she came here first after the home kicked her out.
SUPMALE:I hear and respect your argument.
SUPFEMALE:I believe that i can make an equally strong case i hate her.
LEADFEMALE:I'm older, so i hated her first.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't have any space for her anyhow.
OTHERMALE:I had to move darlene and her kids into one room.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:I give in.
OTHERMALE:I will take darlene and her kids.
LEADMALE:No, i like one of those kids.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's not fair! She wasn't supposed to be a burden.
SUPMALE:She had money.
SUPMALE:Well, she doesn't have it anymore.
SUPFEMALE:And the only option is the county facility, and that's horrible.
SUPFEMALE:No, i know we can't send her there.
LEADFEMALE:Those people are suffering enough already.
LEADMALE:We're gonna have to split her.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh! Let me split her.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:We each get her for a week.
LEADFEMALE:Who goes first? A-ha! Scissors.
LEADMALE:Aah! I should've knew you was gonna make a fist we were talking about mom.
LEADFEMALE:"roseanne" is taped in front of a live audience.
OTHERMALE:What'cha doing? Writing a letter of introduction for when we drop you at the foster home.
LEADMALE:How much would you say you eat a week? Say whatever you have to to get me in.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doing a drywall job for one of the neighbors.
LEADMALE:How did you learn to do that? did you start doing drywall right after college? Well, first i apprenticed with the great drywallers of vienna.
LEADFEMALE:What's this? Plans for a birdhouse.
LEADMALE:After i'm done with the drywall, he wants me to throw one together for him.
LEADFEMALE:Can i help? I'll tell you what i'll cut the wood, draw up some instructions, and you can put it together and paint it.
LEADFEMALE:I can do that.
OTHERMALE:Why do birds need houses when they have trees? I'll do you one better, and this'll bend your mind.
LEADFEMALE:Why do we cut down trees to make the wood for birdhouses? Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:One day, you'll have a brownie in college.
SUPFEMALE:It'll make it even better.
SUPMALE:All right, baby! mama needs a new pair of shoes! I raise.
OTHERFEMALE:Save your money, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, you're not scaring anybody off with that bubble-gum cigar.
SUPMALE:I call.
SUPFEMALE:I fold i know she's got an ace 'cause it's got the grape-jelly stain on it.
SUPMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:I win.
OTHERMALE:Hold on, i want to take a picture for my instagram.
LEADFEMALE:27 cents rappers gon' be shook.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, put that phone down.
SUPMALE:You're missing the magic of the moment here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not putting mine down.
LEADFEMALE:I'm texting with this really hot chick that i met on a dating app.
LEADFEMALE:We're 100% personality match.
LEADMALE:Well, we fight a lot, but i believe the science.
LEADFEMALE:What do two women even fight about? "i want to put the dishes away.
LEADMALE:" "no, i want to put the dishes away.
LEADMALE:" why do they both want to do dishes? David used to offer to clean the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Then he'd ask me how to clean the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:Then i would show him by cleaning the kitchen.
SUPMALE:So, really, it's a story of how stupid i am.
LEADMALE:The problem with my lady is, we're both tops.
LEADMALE:Well, i still say it's got to be easier to be in a relationship with a woman than a man.
SUPMALE:I bet dan thinks the same thing.
LEADMALE:Heh, excuse me? Well, dear, you have to admit, you're a bit bossy.
LEADMALE:You're calling me bossy? Deal, harris, deal.
LEADFEMALE:The tops are about to go at it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sweetheart, i'm not bossy.
LEADMALE:You just have an adolescent need to challenge.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you really have to have mustard with those.
SUPFEMALE:Ketchup is pure corn syrup.
LEADMALE:That's why i like it.
LEADMALE:You'll try it with mustard, you'll see.
SUPFEMALE:Do not open that refrigerator, mom.
LEADMALE:I swear to god, if i even see a light come on on that thing like this? Roseanne, it's 6:00 a.
SUPFEMALE:M.
OTHERFEMALE:It's technically monday.
LEADFEMALE:You're it.
LEADMALE:You've been grocery shopping for seven hours.
LEADMALE:What took you? Long lines.
SUPMALE:And then i went to the dmv and renewed my license early.
LEADMALE:I've been meaning to ask you i have been staring at this thing all day.
LEADMALE:What is it? Oh, that's my marzipan village.
LEADFEMALE:I made it entirely out of almond paste and, uh working on it helps relieve anxiety.
SUPFEMALE:It's just a just kind of a hobby.
SUPFEMALE:It's not a hobby, dear, it's a symptom.
OTHERMALE:All i'm saying is, if you ever want a man to take you seriously, you need to stop doing things like that.
SUPMALE:I have no problem getting men, mother.
SUPFEMALE:The trick is keeping them, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at how you've arranged your furniture.
LEADMALE:You have a single chair in front of the tv that screams "i don't want anybody else here.
LEADMALE:" and yet some people just don't seem to get the message.
LEADMALE:You know what, mom? I don't want to do this anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I am a certified life coach.
SUPFEMALE:We are breaking this pattern right now.
LEADFEMALE:I love your passion, but when i hear life coach, i think it should be someone who has a life.
LEADFEMALE:You ever see "the godfather," mom? No, i don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Buona notte, mama.
LEADFEMALE:I finished the birdhouse.
LEADMALE:Open the curtain.
SUPMALE:Let's see what you got.
LEADMALE:Is this where birds stay when they go to vegas? The birds only use it in the summer, so i made it more open.
LEADMALE:But the birds didn't pay me for this job.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson did, and he wanted it to match his house exactly.
LEADMALE:Well, mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Nelson also had his wife get plastic surgery to look like his mother.
SUPMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson is a freak.
LEADMALE:Be that as it may, if you don't give the customer what they want, they go to someone else.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna have to do this over in the morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry, grandpa.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, come on.
SUPFEMALE:I try to encourage him when he thinks outside the box.
LEADFEMALE:That birdhouse was amazingly creative.
LEADFEMALE:It was creative.
LEADMALE:But this was a job.
LEADFEMALE:I make up songs in the shower.
SUPFEMALE:They're real creative.
SUPMALE:But if show up to work naked and singing, they don't pay me.
LEADMALE:They call the heat.
LEADMALE:Look, there are different kinds of jobs now where people get rewarded for being creative.
SUPMALE:Elon musk makes his own rules.
SUPFEMALE:And the 600 people who work for elon musk have to follow those rules.
LEADFEMALE:And if they don't, i'm sure he has a real creative way of firing them.
SUPMALE:You know what? would you stop thinking of mark as some guy on an assembly line? He's different.
SUPFEMALE:He's got more potential than that.
LEADMALE:Meddling mothers.
LEADFEMALE:This is why kids can't get work in factories anymore.
SUPMALE:Mom? how did you move all my furniture? You have bones like meringue.
LEADFEMALE:You know who does this? A manipulative, narcissistic psychopath.
SUPFEMALE:Not an insult.
SUPMALE:I'm just giving you a heads up on the eulogy.
SUPFEMALE:Mom? mom? Oh, crap.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, crap.
LEADMALE:Hi, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Is mom there? Uh no reason.
SUPMALE:So, those are the uber rules, nick.
LEADFEMALE:Any questions? water? gum? Oh, no thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:One last thing i never know if i'm supposed to tip.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's see.
LEADMALE:I picked you up at your house, so i know where you live, so i guess it's up to you.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you stopping? Sorry.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Have you heard anything from mom? Driver, excuse me.
LEADMALE:There's not supposed to be any family or friends in the car during a ride.
SUPFEMALE:I know where you live, nick.
LEADMALE:Hey, quick question.
OTHERFEMALE:You're a guy.
SUPMALE:If you walked into a woman's house and she had a chair in front of the tv instead of a couch, would that turn you off? And keep in mind, this woman is fantastic in every other way.
SUPFEMALE:I got to get a car.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, i'm gonna be straight with you, nick.
LEADMALE:My sister lost our mom, and we've got to find her.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? It's me, mom.
LEADMALE:I just wanted to tell you that grandma's at my apartment.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank god.
LEADFEMALE:And you two should be ashamed of yourselves.
LEADMALE:She may not be perfect, but she raised you.
LEADFEMALE:And she helped us out when we needed it.
LEADMALE:And now i'm gonna do the same for her because it's the right thing to do.
LEADMALE:She's going to be staying with me.
LEADMALE:You know she's broke, right? what's that? It doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:That's not why i'm doing this anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're right about us, becky.
SUPFEMALE:You're a better person than we are, and we're gonna have to live with the shame of that.
SUPMALE:Yep, me too.
LEADMALE:Okay, thanks.
LEADMALE:Say "hi" to mom.
SUPMALE:Oh! ha-ho! Mark must be really bummed.
SUPFEMALE:He's been in his room for hours.
LEADMALE:You know when i was playing football in high school eughh.
LEADMALE:Let me finish.
SUPFEMALE:State championship the couch gives me one job stop the running back.
SUPMALE:But i got creative and went for the quarterback.
LEADFEMALE:Running back scampers by me 50 yards for the winning touchdown.
SUPMALE:I didn't follow directions.
LEADMALE:And that's why i'm not a pro today.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought beer and a bad back is why you're not a pro today.
OTHERFEMALE:And by the way, didn't you punch your coach? It's a simple story.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you have to pick it apart? Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for, the unveiling of the most boring birdhouse ever! And crowd goes "ehhh.
LEADMALE:" yeah, but i think mr.
LEADMALE:Nelson's gonna be very pleased.
LEADMALE:And so will his mother-wife.
SUPFEMALE:I painted flowers and a sun on the inside so the birds would think it was always summer.
OTHERMALE:I just wanted it to be a little special.
LEADMALE:You know, the world has a way of kind of forcing you to be like everybody else.
LEADMALE:The trick is to find the balance between playing by the rules and breaking them.
LEADMALE:So it's okay if i unless they're my rules.
LEADFEMALE:Don't test me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, i'll kill you if you tell her, but these franks are great with mustard.
SUPFEMALE:You got to do something about grandma! Well, you made it half a day.
LEADMALE:She's having sex right now in my apartment with a very old man.
LEADMALE:It's only 4:00.
LEADMALE:Yeah, they went to dinner, came right back, and started doin' it.
OTHERMALE:You got to get her out of there right now.
LEADMALE:I am living here and eating your food until you do.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go, jackie.
OTHERMALE:Well, what are we gonna do when we get there, just charge in and break it up? No, we'll go in and yell "fire," and they should be out of the room, 45 minutes to an hour, tops.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, it's us.
LEADMALE:Bev: of course it is.
OTHERMALE:Come in! Hi, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, this is my boyfriend, lou.
SUPMALE:Who treats me like a queen.
LEADMALE:Lou, these are my daughters, roseanne and jackie.
LEADMALE:They treat me like a fly in the potato salad.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
SUPMALE:Pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:Those are your daughters? I would've mistaken them for your sisters.
LEADMALE:Uncalled for, lou.
LEADMALE:Uh, mom, becky says you guys got to go right now.
LEADMALE:You don't need to put up with this kind of disrespect.
SUPFEMALE:Beverly, let's just get in the car and drive.
LEADMALE:All we need is a car.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:No, we'll just go.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to need some help with lou's socks.
SUPFEMALE:He can't bend that far, and my arthritis is killing me.
SUPMALE:Jackie, help your mo i'm not touching his feet.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, sit, lou.
SUPFEMALE:I need my compression socks.
LEADMALE:They force the blood to my heart.
SUPFEMALE:Point your toes, lou.
LEADMALE:If i could feel 'em, i'd point 'em.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna take lou back to the home.
SUPMALE:And jackie's gonna help you pack up all your stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine, but you two have to make a decision about who is going to be stuck with me.
LEADFEMALE:I can't be dragging my belongings from one house to the other.
LEADFEMALE:It's too hard.
SUPMALE:Lou, could you wait for roseanne downstairs? I need a minute.
LEADFEMALE:It's two flights.
LEADFEMALE:You got some time.
SUPMALE:Okay, what are we gonna do? I don't want her, and you don't want her.
LEADMALE:There's only one solution.
LEADMALE:You have to take her.
OTHERFEMALE:No, roseanne, come on.
SUPFEMALE:You know she picks me apart way more than she does you.
LEADMALE:So what do we do take her to the county facility where people die in the hallways? Well, we can go visit it before we make any decisions.
SUPMALE:Well, we got to figure something out.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get going, 'cause i'm sure lou has tumbled down to the bottom stair by now.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, what are you doing? We're getting ready to go.
LEADMALE:You won't be happy until i'm gone, so this is for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERMALE:You know you've just been standing by that window, waiting for me to come in so you can manipulate me and make me feel bad.
LEADMALE:Do you know why i left last night? I watched "the godfather" after you went to bed.
SUPFEMALE:That man killed his brother.
SUPMALE:No, he did not.
OTHERFEMALE:He had someone else do it, and i don't have that kind of money.
LEADMALE:Look, mom! I was just upset.
LEADMALE:Upset enough to put me in a county facility where people die in the hallways? when is your hearing gonna go bad? I knew you girls didn't like me, but i didn't think you hated me so much you would throw me in the garbage.
SUPMALE:Mom, this is crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not gonna do this.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think so? Dare me.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Dare me! no! dare me! i want it to be over! No, mom, stop.
LEADFEMALE:Mom! mom! don't! you're freaking me out! i love you! i don't want you to die! Get in here, you crazy old woman.
OTHERMALE:Why did you stop me? Because my life would be better without you, but it would be so much better if it was better with you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i guess that's up to you.
LEADMALE:Well, you're right.
OTHERMALE:I guess it is.
LEADFEMALE:I just keep asking you for something that you can't give me.
LEADMALE:And i'm gonna have to work on that if we're if you're gonna live with me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna live with you? Yeah, you are.
OTHERFEMALE:What's gonna happen when we start fighting again? how are we going to avoid that? Well, that's obvious.
SUPFEMALE:I'm 60.
OTHERFEMALE:You're 90.
LEADMALE:We go through about 10 years of therapy.
OTHERMALE:Well, i may die before that.
SUPMALE:Well, then i win.
OTHERMALE:I got to ask.
SUPMALE:Would you let your mom move into the county home? Well, thank god it didn't come to that, dan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not really sure.
LEADFEMALE:We certainly don't want to give the kids any ideas.
SUPFEMALE:You're so transparent.
LEADMALE:No, this is pure love here.
LEADFEMALE:You're taking one for the team, and i am never gonna forget it.
LEADMALE:Well, you were right.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't let go of needing mom's approval, and that's something that i'm gonna have to work on if we're gonna have a relationship.
LEADMALE:But i think it was the right thing to do, right? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Good girl, jackie.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:And i promise, i'm gonna take her off your hands at least once a month to give you a break.
LEADFEMALE:Great, she likes to go to the park and criticize the children.
SUPFEMALE:There are no words to express the love that i feel for you in this moment.
SUPMALE:It's okay, dan.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:You saved our lives.
LEADMALE:This is from peterson heating and air.
SUPFEMALE:They'd want you to have it.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:The therapist gave us a list of "trigger words" for me and mom, so i'll use this to hang it on the fridge.
OTHERFEMALE:What kind of words are we talking about? "hi," "hello" there's quite a few that get us into trouble.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Roseanne, get in here.
OTHERMALE:What? You can't just stand on the front porch staring at your muslim neighbors.
SUPMALE:It just so obvious you're spying on them.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPMALE:I've got a rake.
LEADFEMALE:Holding a rake and staring is not a cover.
LEADFEMALE:Raking is a cover.
LEADFEMALE:Now come on.
LEADMALE:We need three people to make this into a fun coupon club.
SUPMALE:Otherwise, we're just two poor people trying to save a nickel on tuna.
LEADMALE:Did you see the crazy amount of fertilizer they got stacked up near their garage? That's how they make bombs.
LEADFEMALE:What if this is a sleeper cell full of terrorists getting ready to blow up our neighborhood? what proof do you have, roseanne? This proof anytime something bad happens, it's always somebody who lives next door to somebody.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god, you figured it out.
SUPFEMALE:Terrorists are always neighbors.
OTHERMALE:So, all we have to do is arrest everybody! i'm telling you, this is what people from iraq and talibanistan do! They hide out in neighborhoods like lanford.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you watch the news?! You don't mean the news, you mean fox news, and, uh there is no talibanis oh, forget it.
SUPMALE:Jump in, here, anne-marie.
LEADMALE:Oh, because i'm black, i'm the expert on racism? Oh, geez, i am so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm willing to learn from my mistakes.
SUPFEMALE:Well, good.
LEADFEMALE:So, in that case, if you just give me the 50% off on this cream cheese, we'll call it even.
OTHERMALE:If you're so sure they're not terrorists, go out there and look at how much fertilizer they've got.
SUPFEMALE:If it makes you shut up and stop with this, then fine.
LEADMALE:That's not that much fertilizer.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on.
SUPFEMALE:That is, like, a crazy amount of fertilizer.
LEADMALE:But it doesn't mean anything.
LEADFEMALE:I'm done talking to you people.
OTHERMALE:Hi, chuck.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, rosie.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, our new neighbors have way too much fertilizer.
SUPMALE:After 45 years of marriage, you run out of things to talk about.
LEADMALE:Okay, so neither one of you are worried about this? We don't have time.
SUPFEMALE:We're getting ready for this meeting.
LEADMALE:They're probably just regular folks who want to make a home here.
LEADMALE:They painted their fence, they put in a new mailbox.
LEADFEMALE:They have an american flag, for god's sake.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dan, i don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna have to go with rosie on this one.
SUPMALE:It sounds like they're trying a little too hard.
LEADFEMALE:When i drove through the south, i had a lynyrd skynyrd bumper sticker.
SUPMALE:Granny rose! grandpa dan! Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's quite an outfit, mary.
OTHERMALE:Did daddy let you dress yourself today? No.
LEADMALE:That's what i figured.
LEADFEMALE:Later, oscar de la renta.
LEADFEMALE:So, is it cool if mary spends the night with you tonight? I have a really early appointment at the v.
SUPFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow in danville.
LEADMALE:You're all mine! Why are you leaving tonight if you've got an appointment in the morning? 'cause the line will be all the way down the sidewalk.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of vets live on the sidewalk, so they have an advantage.
LEADMALE:Hey, deej.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, mary.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, nothing happened to you in the army, did it? you can still see patterns, right? Okay, i almost forgot.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight is mary's skype call with geena.
LEADMALE:It's on afghanistan time, so it's 2:00 a.
SUPFEMALE:M.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:That's oh-two-hundred.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know how to do the skype or get up at 2:00 a.
LEADMALE:M.
LEADMALE:After my nighttime meds kick in, i'm legally dead till 7:00 a.
OTHERMALE:M.
LEADMALE:Darlene, will you help mom with the skype call? Oh, sure, waking mom at 2:00 a.
LEADMALE:M.
LEADFEMALE:To explain technology's kind of what i live for.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, thanks.
LEADMALE:Okay, now, you be good tonight for granny.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you stay here, too? I can't, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, you know what would be super-fun? An all-girls slumber party 'cause we could put a tent up in the living room and do each other's hair and makeup and watch videos and make brownies and tell ghost stories.
SUPMALE:That sounds fun.
LEADMALE:That sounds horrible.
OTHERMALE:But what if i can't sleep? Well, then, i'll tell you a bedtime story about two of my dear friends, applesauce and benadryl.
LEADMALE:I loved that story as a kid.
LEADFEMALE:I can never remember how it ends.
SUPMALE:"roseanne" is taped in front of a live audience.
SUPMALE:Me llamo becky.
LEADMALE:What can i get you? Don't try to pronounce anything, just point to the pictures.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, but just so you know, when you get it, it won't look like that.
SUPMALE:Make it two.
LEADMALE:Nothing for me.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out, al.
SUPMALE:I got these little "sign here" stickers for you so you'll know just where to sign.
LEADMALE:I will need those back, though.
LEADMALE:All you got to do is sign, give us a deposit check and in three months, your apartments will have beautiful drywall that your renters can knock holes in and spackle badly.
LEADFEMALE:The savages.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, listen, dan, chuck, i-i wanted to come here and tell you in person.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna be able to go with you guys on this one.
LEADFEMALE:What's the problem, al? My guys are lined up.
LEADMALE:We've done a dozen jobs for you.
SUPMALE:You've always been happy.
LEADMALE:And we work for union minimum.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody's gonna beat that, al.
LEADMALE:Somebody did, and i can't pass it up.
LEADMALE:Beat my bid? They must be going non-union.
SUPMALE:Oh, al, you're not hiring illegals? Uh, dan, please say "undocumented workers" until our tamales get out here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, guys.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, uh order lunch, put it on my account, okay? Uh sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man! I'm not really hungry now.
LEADFEMALE:Me either.
LEADFEMALE:But i think we should leave the waitress a $300 tip.
LEADFEMALE:This is some of my best work.
SUPMALE:Done.
LEADMALE:Hey, i've got a mustache.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha! I'm mom.
LEADMALE:Hey, mark, pretend you're still painting her mustache.
LEADFEMALE:I want to get a picture.
LEADMALE:Do you want me to take the picture so you can be in it? No screens! There's your kid.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at him.
LEADMALE:A point that could have been made without throwing the center of my life across the room.
SUPFEMALE:Brownies are ready.
LEADMALE:Ooh! Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Here's one for you, mom.
SUPMALE:Don't think i won't eat that later.
SUPFEMALE:So, is it time to talk to my mom yet? No yet.
SUPMALE:It's only 10:00.
LEADMALE:Hey, aunt jackie, got any good ghosted stories? I love ghost stories.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Ghosted stories.
SUPFEMALE:They're a little different, mary, but they're very scary.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh! ooh! There was this guy.
LEADFEMALE:I went out with him three times and now i know that's made up.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell a good one.
LEADMALE:This one is called "the last sleepover.
LEADFEMALE:" once upon a time, there was a little girl, and she was having a sleepover with two of her cousins.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow, you really know how to take us to another place.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, or you will be eaten first! Who's gonna eat her? The monster that roams the neighborhood every night, looking for brownies.
LEADFEMALE:And nobody ever heard the monster coming.
LEADFEMALE:Except for a car door slamming, and only the little girl heard it.
SUPFEMALE:I heard it? And then, the monster came in the little girl's house and all they heard was a door creaking.
LEADFEMALE:And then the monster said what he always says just before he eats all the children dan: hey! aaah! Sorry about that.
SUPMALE:I stepped on a phone.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, that job turns out it fell through.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take anything you got.
LEADMALE:And then they went bankrupt and lost their house.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? I got underbid on al's job.
LEADMALE:He's using illegals.
LEADMALE:What? We needed that money.
OTHERMALE:It ain't right, rosie.
LEADMALE:Those guys are so desperate, they'll work for nothing, and we're getting screwed in the process.
LEADFEMALE:It's al that sucks.
LEADMALE:He's taking advantage.
OTHERFEMALE:All's i know is we can't pay our bills.
LEADFEMALE:Too late.
LEADMALE:I thought the money was for sure, so i sent out the checks a couple of days ago.
SUPFEMALE:I always try to pay the final "final notice" on time.
LEADFEMALE:I hear that's good for your credit.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:Now they're all gonna bounce.
SUPFEMALE:Not all.
LEADMALE:I mean, there's enough money to cover one.
OTHERFEMALE:Round and round it goes.
LEADMALE:Who gets paid, nobody knows.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least the kids are getting used to sleeping in a tent.
SUPMALE:We got that working for us.
SUPMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:We have a problem.
LEADFEMALE:That's all we ever have, jackie.
SUPMALE:You got to be more specific.
SUPFEMALE:We were all set up for mary to skype with her mom, and then your wi-fi cut off, and she's starting to freak out.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:That internet check must've bounced.
SUPFEMALE:But maybe there's a good chance we can show our face at sears again.
SUPMALE:All right, last time this happened, we just used the gerskis' wi-fi.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's nice.
OTHERMALE:The neighbors gave you their password? No, we figured it out.
SUPFEMALE:It was stopusingourwifi123.
LEADFEMALE:There's no gerski network on here.
LEADMALE:Well, i know.
LEADMALE:The gerskis moved away.
LEADMALE:Now the terrorists are living there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my god, mom, you have no reason to believe those people want to hurt you.
LEADMALE:They'd have to get to know you first.
OTHERMALE:The only signal strong enough is called al-harazi.
SUPMALE:That's got to be their last name.
LEADMALE:Or it's an arabic word that means "stop using our wi-fi.
LEADFEMALE:" so, all we have to do is guess the password.
LEADMALE:Try "deathtoamerica".
OTHERFEMALE:This is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Nope.
LEADMALE:Okay, "deathtoamerica123".
LEADMALE:Hey, we're in! really? No! This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:I need to talk to my mom.
SUPFEMALE:It's almost time! Calm down, baby.
LEADMALE:We'll figure it out.
LEADMALE:We could be here forever trying to break into their wi-fi.
SUPFEMALE:You have to go over there, roseanne, and politely ask those people to borrow the password.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god, i'm not gonna go to somebody's house at 2:00 in the morning.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna get to talk to her, and my stomach hurts.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go and wake up the enemies of america.
SUPFEMALE:We should bring something.
LEADFEMALE:We can't just go over there empty-handed.
SUPMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Normal doorbell.
LEADMALE:Samir: who is it? Uh, it's roseanne conner.
LEADFEMALE:I-i'm your neighbor from next door.
LEADMALE:One moment.
LEADMALE:Gimme that.
SUPMALE:Nice work, jackie.
SUPMALE:Uh, here's a plant.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to the neighborhood.
SUPMALE:Um, we know that this is a crazy time to wake somebody up, but, you see, our wi-fi went out, and we need to make an emergency skype call.
LEADMALE:And we were just wondering if you could be so kind as to, uh, lend us your password.
LEADFEMALE:Are you drunk? No, no.
SUPFEMALE:That's really the reason why we came over.
LEADFEMALE:But "drunk" is a good guess on any other night.
LEADMALE:I'm fatima al-harazi, and this is my husband, samir.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, i'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:That was so rude of us.
LEADMALE:I'm jackie, roseanne's sister.
LEADMALE:I'm a certified life coach if you're having any trouble assimilating.
SUPMALE:Not now, jackie! Yeah, well, my little granddaughter, you know, she needs to talk to her mother, and it's a whole other time zone and everything 'cause her mom's in afghanistan.
LEADFEMALE:What does she do in afghanistan? Uh she's in the army.
OTHERFEMALE:If you guys have any family over there, let us know, and we'll put in a good word with the drone people.
LEADMALE:We're from yemen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
SUPFEMALE:Yemen's not even on the travel ban list.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, it is.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, why don't you just bring your granddaughter over here to skype.
SUPMALE:The signal will be much stronger.
LEADMALE:Over here? Uh, well, n-no, we couldn't.
SUPFEMALE:W-we've already imposed on you enough.
LEADMALE:You don't want us to see the skype, so we'll know where in afghanistan her mother is, right? Because you think we'll find out her coordinates and give them to our isis friends on facebook.
SUPFEMALE:You see, they hate us.
SUPFEMALE:We don't hate you.
LEADFEMALE:We're scared of you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we're scared of you, too.
LEADMALE:Well, we have way more reason to be scared of you.
LEADMALE:How do you explain all that fertilizer in your yard? that's because genius over here doesn't know every time you click on the amazon order button, you're putting another 50-pound bag in the cart! What's happening? Kazim, go back to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is fine.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Wow, you only told him once, and he listened right away.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to ask how you discipline him 'cause that looks like a bulletproof vest.
SUPMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADMALE:Some people yelled some pretty terrible things at us the other day, and he started to have nightmares.
SUPFEMALE:Helps him feel safer.
LEADMALE:"go cubs".
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh "yay yemen".
LEADFEMALE:That's the password "go cubs".
OTHERFEMALE:We're big baseball fans.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that is so funny because you should hear what we were guessing that your pass no.
LEADMALE:Well, it's so kind of you, and we really appreciate it.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you so much.
LEADFEMALE:It's the right thing to do.
SUPMALE:The ignorance of adults shouldn't punish children.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, son.
LEADMALE:Hey, dad.
LEADMALE:11:00 a.
LEADFEMALE:M.
LEADFEMALE:Beer, huh? Well, it's 9:00 a.
LEADFEMALE:M.
SUPFEMALE:Somewhere.
LEADMALE:Pass one over.
SUPFEMALE:How was the v.
LEADMALE:A.
OTHERFEMALE:? It's a lot like black friday.
LEADMALE:Except instead of waiting for a cheap tv, everybody's waiting for a cheap doctor.
LEADMALE:They give you a clean bill of health? Yeah, it wasn't just a check-up.
OTHERFEMALE:I started seeing a therapist.
SUPFEMALE:Oh? you want to talk about it? Not really.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:I felt like a girl asking.
LEADFEMALE:I've just been going through some stuff since i got discharged.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's probably normal.
LEADMALE:That's got to be confusing, trying to figure out what to do next.
SUPFEMALE:No, i knew exactly what i wanted to do.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanted to re-up.
LEADMALE:They wouldn't take me.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I didn't think they turned down anybody.
LEADMALE:That was probably better as a thought than a statement.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i told them i wanted to continue defending our country, and they said, "we're good.
OTHERFEMALE:" how'd you know i needed a 3/16th? Dad, i've been out here watching you rebuild bikes and drink since i was 5.
SUPFEMALE:I'm real good at both now.
SUPFEMALE:Well, hell, maybe you and i should restore some bikes, maybe make a few bucks.
LEADMALE:I know i could use it.
SUPFEMALE:What do you say? Okay.
LEADMALE:Maybe you could hand me the tools for a change.
LEADMALE:If you're saying, "will i watch you do the work while i pound brewskis?" i say, "welcome to conner and son.
SUPFEMALE:" hello.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:How you doing? A little tired.
OTHERMALE:I was up at 2:00.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry about that.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, ebt card.
LEADMALE:You can't buy prepared food with food stamps.
SUPMALE:Why not? It's food.
LEADFEMALE:The government doesn't want to pay for it because they think that prepared food is a "luxury item.
LEADMALE:" you know how rich people have yachts and summer homes? We have pre-cooked chicken.
LEADMALE:That's $75.
LEADMALE:43.
LEADFEMALE:It says "insufficient funds.
LEADFEMALE:" you're $30 short.
SUPMALE:Um i didn't know.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe the american taxpayers forgot to fill it up last week.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me? I'm an american taxpayer sometimes.
LEADMALE:Put it on my ebt card.
OTHERMALE:You don't need to do that.
LEADMALE:Well, we're stealing your cable, so this probably makes us even.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you can help her carry the groceries out to her camel, too.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you know that saying, "see something, say something"? Well, i saw something, and i'm gonna say something to your manager.
SUPMALE:You are ignorant.
LEADFEMALE:That woman is twice the person you'll ever be.
SUPFEMALE:And she's dealing with a lot of stuff you don't even know about.
OTHERFEMALE:So, next time she comes in the store, you keep your damn mouth shut.
SUPMALE:She's got enough fertilizer to turn this place into a smoking hole in the ground.
OTHERMALE:Now, will you take a coupon from another store? what's your 20, geena? it looks like you're out there in the midst of it, huh? We do that to mask our location.
SUPMALE:It's pretty cool.
LEADMALE:I miss you so much, mommy.
LEADMALE:And i miss my sweet pea.
OTHERFEMALE:I think about you every day.
SUPMALE:Is there anything else you want to tell me about? Granny rose says we're stealing the muslims' wi-fi.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, so am i.
LEADMALE:You know, one thing i always wondered about, geena.
OTHERMALE:When you're, like, over there, how how do you tell who's dangerous and who isn't? The people who answer their doors are usually okay, but i'm not living somewhere as scary as lanford.
LEADFEMALE:That's what i always tell jackie.
LEADMALE:I'm coming.
LEADFEMALE:I'm coming.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong, samir? My wife told me you lent her $30.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Did you have to bring it back at 2:00 in the morning? Oh, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Margarita on the house for the old married couple! Happy anniversary.
LEADMALE:I thank you.
LEADFEMALE:There.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:This is our 45th anniversary, and, uh, i get to talk.
SUPMALE:She's finally coming out of her shell.
LEADFEMALE:Quiet, everybody.
LEADMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we're not gonna sit here and tell you guys how great we are.
LEADMALE:You're gonna do it! I want somebody to make a toast.
SUPMALE:I'll do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, pipe down, everyone.
LEADMALE:Forrest gump's talking.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanna say how amazing it is to see a marriage that lasts 45 years.
SUPMALE:And, mom and dad, you set a great example for all of us, and it's a pretty high bar.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, darlene couldn't get over it, and becky's stuck under it, and my marriage is it's not really a picnic.
LEADMALE:I mean, my w thank you! Anyway, mom and dad, happy 45th.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, becky, since you're our waitress for this evening, do you guys have any special anniversary song here? Nice try.
LEADFEMALE:We only do birthdays.
OTHERMALE:What a coincidence.
LEADMALE:Don't do it.
SUPMALE:It's my birthday today! yay! hey, everybody! it's darlene's birthday! she's 60! feliz cumpleaã±os a ti feliz cumpleaã±os a ti feliz cumpleaã±os a darlene ifeliz cumpleaã±os a ti! Ay-yi-yi-yiyi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.
LEADMALE:Thank you! Ah.
SUPFEMALE:So, are you guys doing anything special for your anniversary? You got to do something.
SUPMALE:45 years i mean, people get less than that for murder.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, got it! Wait, do you guys get points on your credit card? We get threats.
LEADMALE:Is that the same thing? No, you get points for every dollar that you spend.
LEADMALE:It's like a reward.
SUPFEMALE:You can use 'em for, like, travel or to buy things.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you can stay at some nice hotel in the city for your anniversary.
LEADMALE:Put in your password, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see how many points we have.
SUPMALE:Well, this is the credit card we used to pay off all the other credit cards, so we probably got a bunch.
SUPFEMALE:We got enough for one night at the radford suites, with points left over for h-hold me, mama, 'cause i'm fit to bust a honey baked ham! Did i mention the hotel has a pool? Like if you had a ham and a room, you'd ever come out of there to swim.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm booking it.
LEADFEMALE:And, as my anniversary present to you guys, i'll babysit the kids.
LEADFEMALE:It's not babysitting when they're yours! "roseanne" is recorded live in front of a studio audience.
SUPFEMALE:Right, we'll be there at 3:00.
LEADFEMALE:And it's our anniversary, so i really want this to be special.
SUPFEMALE:I want to reserve the biggest, nicest one you got.
LEADFEMALE:Just like we had on our wedding night.
LEADFEMALE:Is that the hotel? No, it's the ham people.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:We're picking one up on the way.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Thank you have a honey baked day, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we got a problem.
SUPMALE:Two, if you don't think leftover chinese food belongs in an omelette.
LEADMALE:My knee is killing me, and a bunch of my pain pills are missing.
SUPFEMALE:This thing was, like, half full.
SUPMALE:How many did you take? Just a couple for my back.
LEADMALE:Are you sure you didn't take more than you thought? If i was taking handsful of these pills, i'd be in a way better mood.
LEADFEMALE:Have you noticed me in a way better mood, dan? The only thing i've noticed is that i love you more every day.
LEADFEMALE:Sir.
SUPFEMALE:Well, somebody must have taken 'em, so we have to find out who it was.
SUPFEMALE:We have a serious opioid problem in this country.
LEADMALE:Let's examine who else had access to the narcotics! Everybody in this house.
LEADMALE:You know, back in the day, i busted up a hashish ring in the in the model u.
SUPMALE:N.
OTHERFEMALE:Down at the junior high.
LEADFEMALE:It was luxembourg.
LEADMALE:It's always luxembourg.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene! Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:What brings you to the kitchen? I was following a rainbow.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, i just came down for coffee.
OTHERMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Interesting.
LEADMALE:Because you're groggy? unable to deal with the real world? Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:Are you selling vitamins again? Some of your mom's pain pills are missing.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, i don't take pills of any kind.
LEADMALE:I don't like to feel out of control, or i can't manage my multinational empire.
OTHERMALE:How come there's sweet-and-sour shrimp in the eggs? you know, i don't think i've noticed before are you wearing eyelash extensions? I literally can't even afford chapstick.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Because your natural lashes are fantastic.
SUPFEMALE:Open up your eyes real wide.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:No slurred speech or pinpoint pupils.
SUPMALE:Mom, what is this? She's clean! We're never gonna find out anything like this, rose.
LEADMALE:There's been a ton of people through this house.
SUPFEMALE:Let's just hide the pills in a safer place.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that doesn't solve my problem.
LEADFEMALE:I can't get a damn refill for two more weeks, and my knee is holding a gun to my head.
LEADMALE:Well, i could go to my doctor and tell him my back's flared up again.
LEADFEMALE:That's so sweet.
SUPMALE:Tonight i'm gonna give your back a reason to flare up.
LEADFEMALE:Zut alors! Hey, crystal.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hey, everybody.
SUPMALE:Guess what today is.
SUPFEMALE:A fundraiser for your dignity? No, no, no.
LEADMALE:You're such a stitch.
LEADFEMALE:It's my last day before i retire! all right! It's about time.
LEADMALE:You've been working that saloon since when, 1865? Give her a break, roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:There's a cattle drive a-comin' through town, and miss kitty wants her to be real friendly-like to all the cowpokes.
SUPFEMALE:Laugh all you want, but i'm about to start living the best years of my life.
OTHERMALE:I'm retiring from the casino with full benefits! Full benefits? That's amazing, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:No one has that nowadays.
LEADMALE:I brought you champagne for tonight.
LEADMALE:Hey, crystal.
LEADMALE:Uh, i didn't know exactly when the women's movement would end, but now seems like a pretty good time to call it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, darlene, you still looking for work? 'cause if i recommend you for my job, you're as good as in.
SUPMALE:Aw, that's really sweet, crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Did i mention the benefits package includes mental health? I just found out i hate my mother.
SUPMALE:Which is really weird because i love my mother.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, you have full benefits? If you don't want it, darlene, i'll take it.
SUPMALE:Um, you know what? I-i appreciate the offer, but it's not really my thing, so go for it, beck.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't feel like you're betraying your mexican heritage.
LEADMALE:Are you sure you want to turn that job down? For full dental and medical, i'd wear that dress.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, you got to that pretty quick.
OTHERFEMALE:Anything you want to tell me, dad? I gotta be honest, darlene, i don't know how you can pass on a job with full benefits.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, i have some pretty good reasons.
LEADFEMALE:Shall we start with the riverboat-whore vibe? hey, you know who wasn't too good to wear that dress? One mr.
LEADMALE:Bugs bunny.
LEADMALE:Dad, i still want to be a writer.
LEADMALE:I mean, i've gone from novels to textbooks to menus.
LEADFEMALE:If i take this waitress job, i'm just giving up completely.
SUPMALE:What are you gonna do if your kids get sick, write about it? Well, we managed so far.
LEADMALE:You've been lucky.
LEADFEMALE:One emergency can wipe you out.
SUPMALE:You know what i'd give right now to have full coverage for your mother's knee? Sometimes you just gotta suck it up and put your family first.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You made your point.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:I know a little bit about how this world works.
OTHERMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, i got to go jam a sleep-apnea mask and a seven-pound ham into an overnight bag.
LEADMALE:Good evening.
SUPMALE:Checking in.
SUPFEMALE:Points? last name? Hilton.
LEADFEMALE:Staying under the name conner.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:I have you right here.
SUPFEMALE:We have a superior deluxe room with a view.
SUPMALE:Ooh! Were we upgraded? Oh, no, sir.
SUPFEMALE:"superior deluxe" is our lowest level room.
OTHERMALE:You have a mini-bar, and you also have 24-hour access to our business center.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:I can't wait 'til we're checked in, dan, so we can get down there to the business center.
LEADMALE:Capital idea.
OTHERMALE:I need to fax a copy of my ass to our associates in singapore.
LEADMALE:If i could just get a credit card for incidentals? for who? The points cover the room, but the card is in case you want to order room service or purchase a movie.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:I-i guess i'll just use this one.
OTHERMALE:Our platinum card's in the shop.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Do i smell ham? Hm.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, sir.
LEADMALE:This card was declined.
OTHERMALE:Would you like to try another one? Uh, listen here, my good man, we won't be getting any incidents, so you can just skip that part.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, i'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I-i can't check you in without a credit card.
SUPMALE:It's just the policy of the hotel.
LEADMALE:And every hotel in the world.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell's this country coming to when you need money to get free stuff? Let me tell ya something, i don't even want to stay here now.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to go home.
OTHERFEMALE:And if you saw where we live, you would know what an insult that is.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
OTHERFEMALE:This is not who i am.
LEADFEMALE:It's what you've made me! You know, screw that hotel.
OTHERMALE:The two most important things about our anniversary are right here.
OTHERMALE:What, me and ham? I was gonna say "liquor and ham," but i'm glad you joined us.
SUPMALE:And now mexican champagne.
SUPMALE:Ooh! It's pink.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's the salsa.
OTHERFEMALE:Does madame approve? Hells, yeah, madame does! To the woman who makes it a pleasure to wake up every morning.
LEADFEMALE:Here's to you, little debbie.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! Who wants whipped cream? Me.
LEADMALE:Where are my baby birds? Just for the kids.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look.
LEADFEMALE:When you connect the dots, it makes a giant bean.
SUPMALE:You couldn't tell that without connecting the dots? Hey, chica.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, gringa.
LEADFEMALE:So, while i have you alone for a minute, um i've really been thinking about it, and i'd be pretty irresponsible not to go after that job.
SUPFEMALE:It doesn't work like that.
LEADMALE:You can't say you don't want a job one day and then turn around and say you want it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i see you're well-versed in labor law.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have any other options.
LEADFEMALE:You don't need this job.
LEADFEMALE:You have a college degree.
LEADFEMALE:Well, unfortunately, walmart has no more openings in their english lit department.
LEADFEMALE:You still have a better chance of finding something than i do.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to say, becky.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not doing this for me.
SUPFEMALE:My kids need medical and dental.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you want them to have that? so because you have kids, my problems will never be as important as yours? Oh, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Us single moms have had it too easy for too long.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you might want to get back there.
LEADMALE:Harris found some dirty phrases in the word search, and now the little ones are asking questions.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, my turn to spin the bottle now.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Ohh! oh! You got to kiss the ham.
LEADMALE:I've kissed worse.
LEADMALE:Mmm! oohmm! What's so funny? Oh! "ham" is spelled the same way frontward and backward.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:Methinks the lady hath been overserved.
LEADMALE:Arf! are you growling at me? Ruff! I see how this is.
OTHERMALE:It's time to take this party to the bedroom.
SUPFEMALE:Arf! Down, girl.
SUPMALE:Ham! oh! I gotta tell you, i don't even recognize what it is we're doing anymore.
LEADMALE:What the hell, rose? You only had a couple of drinks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not my fault.
SUPMALE:The champagne on the vicodin should say "do not take with label.
SUPMALE:" but the good news is my knees are gone! How could you possibly have taken more vicodin? I didn't even get the prescription yet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you better get on it, because my secret bottles are running low.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you look like my husband.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Busy.
OTHERMALE:Can't talk now.
LEADMALE:I got an 8% tip riding on this.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Crystal called me.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you so much for not going after that job.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to thank me.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to leave here anyway.
SUPMALE:We just got cream-filled churros.
OTHERFEMALE:It's an exciting time.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Um i won't thank you.
LEADMALE:But i will give you a gift.
LEADFEMALE:Brochures? Thanks! I've seen these at the bank, but i never dreamed of owning one.
SUPMALE:Just read it, dork.
OTHERMALE:There's a program in hotel and restaurant management at u of i, st.
SUPFEMALE:Charles, and i checked into it.
SUPMALE:You qualify for a state grant because, luckily, you're poor and old.
LEADFEMALE:I work full time.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have time to go to school.
LEADFEMALE:But they have night classes, or you can do it online.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, becky.
LEADFEMALE:You were always so great in school.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm 43 years old.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, so in two years, you can be a 45-year-old waitress hustling for tips or you can be a 45-year-old with a degree pulling down almost six figures a year.
LEADMALE:And look, between classes, you can sit under a tree and play guitar with one friend of every color.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta get back to work.
SUPFEMALE:I'll think about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:All right, i think i have one more thing to show you.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you gave up a lot for me, so i feel i owe you this.
SUPMALE:Good morning.
OTHERMALE:Afternoon, actually.
SUPMALE:You okay? My mouth hurts.
LEADFEMALE:That's because the tug-of-war over the ham bone took 20 minutes.
LEADMALE:When did that happen? Right after you tried to eat my pants.
OTHERMALE:Let's talk.
LEADMALE:Not until i get a pill.
LEADFEMALE:I'm hurtin'.
LEADFEMALE:You want pills? I got pills.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:That's a lot of pills, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you might have a problem.
SUPFEMALE:I do have a problem.
LEADMALE:I found these pills hidden all over the house.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you tell me how big of a problem i have? Well, you already admitted you have a problem, so that's your first step.
SUPFEMALE:So now you should go find a meeting.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, i'm in pain, so i take a few extra pills.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like i'm a drug addict.
LEADMALE:Really? who's billy kreski? His mom gave those to me.
SUPFEMALE:He got 'em when he got his wisdom teeth out.
LEADFEMALE:If it wasn't for me, the kid might've got hooked on pain pills.
SUPFEMALE:You're hoarding pills, you sent me out for more, you blamed the kids all lies.
LEADMALE:45 years of marriage, you've never lied to me like this before.
SUPMALE:Or have you? No.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't say anything because we can't afford the surgery.
SUPMALE:And i got these pills 'cause i'm gonna be dealing with this for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have any idea how bad it hurts.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i do.
SUPMALE:I got a bad back.
LEADMALE:And when your back goes out, you lay on the couch for two weeks, and i wait on you hand and foot.
LEADMALE:You know what happens when my knee hurts? I do the cleaning, the shopping, the cooking fine! I'll do all that.
SUPMALE:Just show me where the water bucket is and the sponge on the stick thingy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll cut back.
SUPMALE:No, you won't.
LEADFEMALE:You're taking these for more than pain.
LEADFEMALE:Book the surgery.
LEADMALE:Where are we gonna get $3,000 for the deductible? Look, if it's between you od-ing and me coming up with the money, i'll figure out something.
LEADMALE:In the meantime, i'll give you one pill "every six to eight hours for post-operative pain.
LEADMALE:" what the hell? are you sure marcy bellinger doesn't need these? When you get new boobs, compliments should be enough.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to take a walk.
LEADMALE:I know you can do this.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADMALE:Here's your crown and diet, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Thanks, drank skank.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, you forgot my lemon.
LEADFEMALE:Would you be a dear? when i get back with a lemon, are you gonna ask me to bring you a lime? I wouldn't want to have to tell the manager you mistreated me on my birthday.
OTHERMALE:I'll be right back.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, sir.
LEADMALE:That blonde over there asked me to give you her number, and she loves when guys send pics.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: dan? Dan! My knee went out.
LEADMALE:I sat down, and i can't get up.
SUPMALE:Fire! mom, are you okay? No, i'm stuck on the toilet! Yo, top gun, wake up.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie's in trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom's yelling "fire" in the bathroom, and i'm not going in.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Dan! Hello, buttercup.
SUPFEMALE:May i be of service? Just give a good yank.
SUPMALE:Upsy-daisy.
LEADMALE:Did you make the appointment for your knee surgery yet? You know how doctors are, dan.
LEADFEMALE:They say they can see you in a month, and then when you tell them you can't stand the pain any longer, they say, "we'll see you in a month.
OTHERFEMALE:" quit stalling.
LEADFEMALE:We don't have the money, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:And a surgeon is not gonna give it his best shot when you're paying him with a coffee can full of nickels.
LEADMALE:I'm on it.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get the next drywall job, no matter how low i have to bid.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't start the negotiations like that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna cut costs by doing what everybody else is doing.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me you're gonna hire illegals.
OTHERMALE:Hey! I'm also gonna use substandard materials.
SUPMALE:You know, if the union finds out you're hiring those guys, they're gonna kick you out.
SUPMALE:That's a risk i'm gonna have to take.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna stand by and watch you suffer anymore, and i'm not gonna let you go back to taking too many pain pills.
LEADMALE:Well, i don't want you to sacrifice anything for me, dan, 'cause that would give you the upper hand, and that's not how this marriage was built.
LEADFEMALE:"roseanne" is taped in front of a live audience.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, honey.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:You know, i didn't think i'd get used to eating heart-smart, but this turkey bacon isn't bad.
SUPFEMALE:You know what would make it taste better? If you fed it to a big ol' pig and then ate him.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, morning, conners! I brought doughnuts.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh! mmm! mmm! mmm! Finally, a man bringing me something i really want.
LEADMALE:Do you need another wife? Uh, let's see that's another birthday to remember.
LEADFEMALE:I'll ask anne-marie, yeah.
LEADMALE:She'll be fine with it.
SUPMALE:We already decided when you guys die, we're gonna be old-lady lesbians that go on bus trips together.
OTHERFEMALE:Bus trips? we left you nothin'! Hey, chuck huh? didn't your uncle have hip surgery a while back? how'd he afford that? County hospital.
SUPMALE:Well, he actually had both hips done because they did the wrong one first.
SUPMALE:He should've gone to mexico.
LEADFEMALE:They charge, like, half of what they charge here.
LEADFEMALE:I've heard that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh! Here's a doctor in juarez who only charges a grand for a new knee, and he'll throw in moving your nipples for free.
LEADMALE:Do i have to? what if i like my nipples where they are? Doesn't say.
LEADMALE:Okay, i'm taking the rest of these down to the union office.
LEADMALE:Okay, did you put in our bid on that new condo project yet? I'm working on it.
SUPFEMALE:So, you're really gonna hire those other guys instead of chuck? He's been your best friend for 30 years.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the reminder.
SUPMALE:Jackie: soccer star coming through! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you do? They put me in for one play, and i accidentally scored a goal for the other team.
LEADFEMALE:The winning goal.
SUPFEMALE:Man, jackie, dan is still talking about going non-union.
SUPMALE:You know, he's gonna lose everything he's built.
LEADMALE:I got to find another way to pay for this knee.
LEADFEMALE:You have anything you could sell? We should go through all those old boxes in the basement, you know, and see if there's anything of value in them.
LEADFEMALE:"we"? You always think that i have nothing to do, that i'm free to help you whenever you want.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:That was rude.
SUPMALE:Are you available? Yes, i am.
LEADMALE:But if you'd asked me two weeks from thursday, i wouldn't be.
LEADMALE:Unless it was the afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Wake up, morticia! Leave me alone.
LEADMALE:I didn't get off work until 2:00.
LEADMALE:Mom said you weren't making a lot of tips, so i brought you something that could help.
LEADMALE:It's called the "waitress's best friend.
SUPMALE:" oh, man, this is perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a push-up bra.
SUPMALE:It'll make you look anatomically correct.
LEADFEMALE:When do men ever have to do anything like this to earn a living? You know, your attitude is part of your problem.
LEADFEMALE:When you see a customer, how do you greet them? I say, "what do you want?" that's what you say when a bum touches you.
SUPMALE:Look, the kind of guys you're waiting on are very simple creatures.
SUPFEMALE:All you got to do is tell them you like something about them.
LEADMALE:Like, when a guy orders, say, "that's what i drink.
SUPFEMALE:" look, i really appreciate you trying to help, but we're very different people.
LEADMALE:I'm kind of an introvert, and, um i want to get the words right here you're an alcoholic tramp.
SUPMALE:Why do we have to be hurtful? All i'm trying to say is you're not an appealing person.
LEADMALE:You will have to flirt and probably a lot to take care of your kids.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't even flirt to have my kids.
LEADFEMALE:I just said, "what do you want?" hey, look at this.
LEADFEMALE:I found nana mary's favorite hat.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that.
LEADMALE:Talk about passing down something that everybody can use.
SUPMALE:Oh, jackie, look! I found magdalena.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADFEMALE:You know how many years it took me to get over mom treating that evil, glassy-eyed demon better than us? Yeah, you sound like you're over it.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Oh, she wouldn't let us play with it, wouldn't let us touch it.
LEADFEMALE:"oh, don't touch her hair.
OTHERFEMALE:" i'm gonna brush her hair right now.
OTHERMALE:No! don't! Don't do anything to her 'til we find out if she's worth any money.
OTHERMALE:Mom said she was a kestner.
LEADFEMALE:"this is my kestner.
SUPMALE:Isn't my kestner precious?" no, she isn't! oh, my god, roseanne! She's worth $5,000.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom's right she is worth more than both of us put together.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but that's not what you whisper to your kids when you're tucking them in.
LEADMALE:I think we should take her down and try to sell her at that antique mall.
OTHERMALE:This little nightmare might pay for my knee.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, it's a diary.
SUPMALE:This must be mom's.
LEADMALE:Eugh.
SUPFEMALE:"dear diary, today my wonderful mommy brushed my hair with my special brush.
LEADMALE:" this is magdalena's diary! eww! ohhh! Hey, do you know if it's still raining out? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm stuck in this windowless prison, like you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, um i like something about you.
SUPMALE:I'll i'll have it when i get back.
SUPMALE:Before you go, i'll have a sloe gin fizz.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, that's a great order.
SUPMALE:That's exactly what i drink.
SUPFEMALE:Been drinking it since i was a kid.
SUPMALE:Hey, don't run away.
LEADFEMALE:We've been trying to get one of you girls all night.
LEADFEMALE:What can i get you? Uh, six shots of jameson, 12 coors lights.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great order.
SUPMALE:That's exactly what i drink.
LEADMALE:Well, bring an extra one for you.
LEADMALE:And, uh, how about a kiss for good luck? I'm not gonna kiss you.
LEADMALE:'cause it'd be too darn hard to stop! Can i borrow a clean bar rag? Dean: you know, kestners are amongst the most highly sought-after dolls of the '20s.
SUPMALE:And it looks like, from the condition, she's been cared for by someone who had no children of her own to love.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, she was barren and died alone.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, it looks like she's been repaired.
SUPFEMALE:Ah! This is not this doll's original body.
LEADFEMALE:So i would say that she's worth $100.
LEADMALE:A disappointment to the end! Can't you just strip her for spare parts? This is not just a doll.
LEADMALE:It's part kestner.
LEADFEMALE:It's a treasure, family member, companion to a lonely boy who's afraid to get hit by the football.
SUPMALE:Well, what about 200 bucks just for the head? 'cause, i mean, this is real human hair.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you could use it to build a friend in your basement.
OTHERFEMALE:Well oh.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dan.
LEADFEMALE:Where you at? At the end of my rope.
LEADMALE:Where are you? You better come home quick, honey.
SUPMALE:We're flooding.
LEADMALE:Ah, crap.
OTHERMALE:Okay, we're on our way.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, did you grab the kids' photos and their birth certificates? Of course i did! whoa! Looks like you got a leak somewhere.
LEADMALE:Leak? I think this basement holds the water pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know i'd help you out, but you probably found someone cheaper.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a bad time, chuck.
OTHERMALE:How about we talk later? i just ran into one of the gonzalez brothers at home depot, and he said you're using his guys on the condo job? is that true? I was gonna tell you.
SUPMALE:When? after you finished the job? Of course not.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, i just can't afford you guys.
LEADFEMALE:"y-you guys"? Ohhh.
LEADMALE:T-that's what happened.
LEADFEMALE:And i thought the whole time that we were friends.
LEADFEMALE:Turns out i was just one of the guys.
LEADMALE:I don't have a choice, man.
SUPMALE:I got responsibilities.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:And i'm still working construction because i like the way i look in the hat.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to do? I got three extra mouths to feed since darlene moved back in.
LEADMALE:Roseanne started popping pills because we didn't have the money to fix her knee.
LEADMALE:And now i got 20 grand of water damage.
LEADMALE:I've spent my whole life hanging on by my fingertips, telling everybody not to worry, that i was gonna make it okay because that's my job.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now i can't promise that anymore.
SUPFEMALE:So, yeah it makes me sick.
SUPFEMALE:But i'm gonna do whatever i have to do to take care of my family, because i'm old, i'm tired, and i'm not sure how much longer i can hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i'm old, too.
LEADFEMALE:And i'm tired.
LEADFEMALE:And now i'm unemployed.
OTHERMALE:I always told you if i'm eating, you're eating.
LEADMALE:I'm not eating.
OTHERFEMALE:Holy crap! Hey, chuck.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, rosie.
LEADMALE:How bad is it? Well, that depends.
SUPFEMALE:You didn't pick up any flood insurance while you were out, did you? All this water's gonna affect the foundation.
LEADMALE:Is there anything i can do to help? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Take this.
LEADMALE:It's not heavy enough to hold me underwater.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, everything's gonna be fine.
LEADMALE:Go on back upstairs and entertain the troops.
SUPFEMALE:Business as usual.
LEADFEMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, dan, lookit after 40 years, we finally got a pool.
SUPMALE:Yep.
LEADMALE:You guys have like a million boxes of halloween stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we were a lot of fun before you got here.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, aunt jackie, back me up.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a little crazy, right? Perhaps it's a little extreme.
LEADFEMALE:These costumes are so lame.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe anybody would ever be scared by them.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, watch your mouth.
SUPFEMALE:We were famous for that stuff in these parts.
LEADMALE:Ow! Are you okay? Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
SUPMALE:I think it's my heart.
SUPMALE:Somebody call 911! oh, my god! i hate you! each and every single one of you! Don't say that.
OTHERFEMALE:It only makes them stronger.
LEADMALE:Alright, what we need here is a little prestidigitation.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, ladies and gentlemen, prepare for the return of d.j. magic d.
LEADMALE:J who will amaze you with his feats of magic and mystery.
LEADFEMALE:Open the door.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe the storm will suck us out.
OTHERMALE:I want to be your assistant, like in the old days.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I need to pick somebody at random from the audience.
LEADMALE:You! You'll do fine.
LEADFEMALE:Me?! Yes, come on up here and hold "blackstone's ancient book of sorcery for kids.
LEADFEMALE:" uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Open it to "ancient mystical trick #4.
SUPMALE:" three ordinary cups.
LEADMALE:These balls are completely solid.
LEADFEMALE:And now, ladies and gentlemen, "conceal the foam ball in hand.
LEADFEMALE:" i will place the damn it! Aw.
SUPMALE:Ta-da! all: yay! Hey, the president's holding a press conference.
LEADMALE:The governor's trying to get him to declare a state of emergency.
OTHERMALE:Oh, wow.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADMALE:Half the state is underwater.
LEADFEMALE:They took all these senior citizens from one of those old folks' homes and put them on the roof of the building.
SUPMALE:That's great news.
LEADFEMALE:But it's also kind of sad, in a way.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, it's terribly sad.
LEADFEMALE:But if they declare a state of emergency, fema will give us some money to repair the basement.
OTHERMALE:I can do it for half of what they give us and use the rest for rose's knee.
LEADMALE:Hoo! state of emergency! all: state of emergency! this is awful! You have young children rooting for other people's misery.
SUPMALE:He just declared it! state of emergency! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! the president spelled "illinois" wrong in his tweet, but it still counts, right? Yay! yay! yay! Hey, that's really funny.
LEADMALE:Oh, god! Harris, you scared the crap out of me.
LEADFEMALE:What are you writing? Looks really good.
SUPMALE:It's, uh, about a brilliant, young novelist who works at a casino for research, pretending it's a real job.
SUPMALE:You know, i'm really glad that you're writing again.
OTHERFEMALE:It's inspiring.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:That means a lot to me, but, you know, let's manage expectations.
OTHERFEMALE:Who knows? Nothing may come of this.
SUPFEMALE:No, you got to believe in yourself, mom! I mean, stephen king was a janitor, and j.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:Rowling was a single mother living on welfare.
LEADMALE:They were losers, just like you.
LEADMALE:That's sweet.
LEADMALE:Good night, harris.
LEADFEMALE:If you're gonna be writing at night, everyone at my school has adderall, if you want some.
LEADMALE:Good night, harris! Oh, and in case you're wondering, i am not taking any adderall.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen your grades.
SUPMALE:A little more sparkling cider, my dear? Don't mind if i do.
SUPMALE:How come you've never taken me to this restaurant before? Oh, well, it's very exclusive.
LEADFEMALE:It's received three michelin tires.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's to crap finally going our way.
OTHERFEMALE:Dink! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Darlene's got a job, becky still has a job, d.j. 's raising a great kid, and mom's over the vd.
LEADMALE:Eh! ehhhhh! ehhh! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Not while you're eating.
SUPMALE:And plus, that flood did so much damage in lanford, there's plenty of work for everybody legal and illegal.
LEADFEMALE:Phew.
LEADMALE:Did you work things out with chuck? He told me he'd only work with me as an equal partner with three weeks' paid vacation.
LEADFEMALE:What did you say? I told him he was grindin' me no way in hell.
LEADFEMALE:So you're partners now? Soon as he gets back from vacation.
LEADMALE:I'm kinda scared about the surgery, dan.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:It's a good hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Your doctor's won every lawsuit.
LEADMALE:I know, but i just don't want to die.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to go anywhere without you.
LEADMALE:Who's gonna fix the pearly gates if i back into 'em? You don't need me.
SUPMALE:You'll be running the joint.
SUPMALE:God'll be hiding in the garage, fixing motorcycles.
OTHERMALE:I'm serious, dan.
SUPFEMALE:You've been taking care of me almost my whole life.
LEADMALE:I don't want to go anywhere without you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:The odds are, i'll go first anyway.
LEADFEMALE:And if i do, i want you to promise me that you'll do whatever you can to fulfill the rest of your life.
OTHERFEMALE:Even if it means finding love and companionship with another man.
LEADFEMALE:Will you do that? You just want me to say yes so you have permission to go find somebody else when i'm in the ground.
LEADFEMALE:Hell no! I want you to die alone and miserable.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever mother wants.
SUPFEMALE:You know, lord, they're gonna put me under tomorrow for surgery, and, uh i hope i see my husband's face when i wake up and not yours.
OTHERFEMALE:No offense.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene: hey, mom, come in here for a second! Oh, yeah, and could you find her a man? I wouldn't ask, but she's not easy.
LEADMALE:All: surprise! hey! What is this? All your favorites ham and cakes.

LEADMALE:What did i do to deserve this? 7:53.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, move, everybody! Hey, hit me up with that ham.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait, that's gonna take too much time to chew.
SUPMALE:Gimme the casserole.
SUPFEMALE:Come on!
