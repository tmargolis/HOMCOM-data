LEADMALE:well, this one's called "saturday" and i hope you enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:it was one of my favorite ones in that first season because my thenmy first ex-husband bill plays a neighbor freddy who bangs his head and bill was famous in our entire marriage and in his entire life for banging his head.
LEADMALE:i remember when we were living in denver, he banged his head on the same chandelier every single day for about two years like he forgot it was there.
LEADFEMALE:so i kind of wanted him to do that on the show 'cause he was quite funny at banging his head and the facial expressions he'd make.
LEADFEMALE:so i hope you enjoy it.
OTHERFEMALE:dAN: babe, i've looked everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:where's the good rags? they're hanging up in your closet.
LEADFEMALE:all i could find is this flimsy stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:i need substantial rags to work on the truck.
LEADMALE:hello.
OTHERFEMALE:hey, dwight.
SUPMALE:what's up? besides that.
LEADMALE:oh yeah, bring the whole wrench set.
LEADFEMALE:no, we got plenty of beer.
LEADMALE:all right, see you in a few, buckaroo.
LEADMALE:is dwight coming over here? yeah, what's wrong with that? nothing.
LEADMALE:just every time you're with him, your i.
SUPFEMALE:q.
LEADFEMALE:drops ten points.
LEADFEMALE:he's bringing his tools over.
OTHERFEMALE:he's gonna help me tune up the truck.
OTHERFEMALE:you're not gonna get that truck tuned up.
LEADFEMALE:you guys are just gonna be in the driveway, drinkin' beer and spittin' and talking about who's got the biggest hood ornament.
SUPFEMALE:hell, honey, that's not even a contest.
LEADMALE:i know, no one can spit like you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:i love watching you with dwight.
OTHERFEMALE:you guys are so funny.
LEADFEMALE:"yeah, i bet those bears are gonna kick some butt on sunday.
OTHERMALE:" yeah.
OTHERMALE:you got that down.
LEADMALE:maybe you should come out and help us work on the truck.
OTHERFEMALE:i probably should.
SUPMALE:that's the only way you'll probably get it done.
LEADFEMALE:you and dwight have never finished nothing but a six-pack.
LEADFEMALE:utility room is not a truck.
OTHERFEMALE:can i embroider that on a pillow? yes.
OTHERMALE:and you can embroider this.
SUPFEMALE:by 4:00 this afternoon, that truck will have new points and plugs and will be running like a race car.
SUPFEMALE:oh, yeah? yeah.
SUPMALE:yeah? yeah.
LEADMALE:would you care to make a small wager? oh, name it.
LEADMALE:okay, if that truck ain't working by 4:00, then you got to clean this oven today and every month for the rest of your life.
OTHERMALE:fine.
OTHERFEMALE:but if i win, which i will, you got to do all the snow shoveling this winter and every winter for the rest of your life.
LEADMALE:all right, you're on, buckaroo.
SUPMALE:here you go.
LEADMALE:one peanut butter and jelly sandwich coming right up.
LEADMALE:i like it better with the peanut butter on top.
SUPMALE:there you go.
SUPFEMALE:thanks.
LEADFEMALE:hey, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:hi, dwight.
LEADFEMALE:hey there, scooter.
LEADMALE:hi, mr.
LEADFEMALE:goodworth.
LEADMALE:what are you doing, dwight? beer break.
LEADMALE:well, you don't just go in somebody's house and start taking stuff out of their fridge.
OTHERMALE:dan said i could.
SUPMALE:well, what dan says don't matter around here.
OTHERFEMALE:he knows that.
SUPFEMALE:did you hear that, dan? dAN: it's true.
SUPMALE:i'm merely a figurehead.
LEADMALE:i hear you're gonna be shoveling some snow this winter.
OTHERMALE:yeah, rose, you better be nice to dwight.
SUPMALE:he said he can get you a good discount on a snow blower.
SUPMALE:you think freddy wants a beer? he's breathing, ain't he? is freddy out there, too? got all three of us on the job now.
LEADFEMALE:getting worried, girl? oh, yeah, i'm shakin' in my boots.
LEADFEMALE:don't stick your finger in there.
OTHERMALE:tastes better that way.
LEADMALE:that's disgusting.
LEADMALE:you want me to put it back? dan, you told me he was housebroken.
LEADMALE:i lied.
SUPFEMALE:come on, boy.
LEADMALE:hold on there, dan.
OTHERFEMALE:hey, chiquita rosarita.
OTHERMALE:is that little sister of yours gonna be around here today? what do you care? boy, can't a man ask a simple question without some woman giving him the third degree? well, not when that man's you and the woman's my sister.
SUPMALE:what kind of crazy thoughts are rattling around in that empty head of yours, dwight? just wanna talk to her is all.
LEADMALE:about what? nothing.
LEADMALE:are you thinking about asking her out? maybe.
LEADMALE:rOSEANNE: on a date? sorta.
LEADMALE:well, forget about it, dwight.
LEADFEMALE:my sister don't date neanderthals.
LEADMALE:why? come on, dwight, we got a lot of work to do.
OTHERMALE:take that beer out to freddy.
OTHERMALE:dan.
SUPMALE:yes, dear.
SUPMALE:why didn't you tell me he's got the hots for jackie? news to me.
LEADFEMALE:he's not going out with my sister.
SUPFEMALE:why don't we just let them work out their own lives? 'cause it'll just mess 'em up.
LEADFEMALE:rosie.
SUPFEMALE:why must you mere mortals gamble with your own thoughts when you have the goddess of corn here to keep you from screwing up? here, dad.
LEADMALE:thanks, son.
LEADMALE:hey, scooter, you wanna go ask your mom for some more chips? okay.
LEADFEMALE:hey, take it easy there, dwight.
LEADMALE:i wouldn't want you to strain yourself.
LEADMALE:don't worry, pal.
LEADMALE:i lift with my legs, not my back.
SUPMALE:hey, dan yeah? jackie ain't dating anybody, is she? nobody'll have her.
LEADMALE:hand me the screwdriver.
SUPMALE:it's pretty obvious.
LEADFEMALE:she's got a thing for me.
LEADFEMALE:oh, yeah? yep.
OTHERFEMALE:she was in my hardware store last thursday, asking me a lot of questions about those new cordless drills i got in.
LEADMALE:yeah, those are nice.
LEADMALE:but that's not what she was shopping for, if you catch my drift.
SUPFEMALE:dwight, you own a hardware store.
SUPFEMALE:have you considered the remote possibility that jackie came in because she needed something? oh, she needed something, all right.
SUPFEMALE:that's right, i forgot, you're the real expert with women.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, i guess i know my way around the henhouse, all right.
LEADMALE:yeah, probably so, since you're still living at home with your mom.
LEADMALE:hey.
LEADMALE:hey, my mom needs me.
SUPFEMALE:yum.
SUPMALE:well, freddy, i see you're making a heck of a difference there.
SUPMALE:you guys already got the hood up.
OTHERMALE:yeah, we got your hardcore labor going on.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, i see dwight's laboring to suck the bottom out of that beer can.
LEADMALE:dad, can i get in the truck? sure, go ahead, bub.
OTHERFEMALE:rOSEANNE: let me see what kind of mess you're making around here? why, we're so far ahead, we're ready for another break.
LEADFEMALE:we already pulled the points and plugs, and now we're setting the gaps.
LEADFEMALE:what are you talking motors to her for? it's a waste of breath, dan.
SUPFEMALE:he's right, dan, you know.
SUPMALE:the female mind just can't handle the complexities of the modern combustion engine.
LEADFEMALE:it's a proven fact.
SUPMALE:right, freddy? that's right.
SUPMALE:look at all these wires and these gizmos and thingamabobs.
SUPFEMALE:it just makes my head spin.
LEADFEMALE:it's typical.
LEADFEMALE:i say if you can't find the fan belt, you shouldn't get behind the steering wheel.
LEADFEMALE:am i right, dan? you're on your own here, dwight.
SUPFEMALE:tell you what i'd do with you women.
LEADMALE:i'd take all of your little licenses away and i'd put you girls on public transportation where you's belong.
OTHERFEMALE:i'm amazed you're not the governor.
LEADFEMALE:i wouldn't vote for ya.
LEADMALE:damn it, don't honk that when i'm working on the engine.
LEADMALE:sorry, mr.
LEADMALE:meeker.
LEADFEMALE:don't worry, scooter.
LEADMALE:he didn't hit anything he uses.
SUPMALE:mom, can i ride my bike? yeah, but ride in real heavy traffic.
SUPFEMALE:ha-ha, it's so funny i forgot to laugh.
SUPFEMALE:now, you boys pick up all your beer cans and put your little toys away.
LEADFEMALE:and when you're all done playing, you push this big, blue truck right out of the driveway.
LEADFEMALE:boy, i'll tell you what, dan, every morning i wake up, get down on my knees and thank the good lord up above i'm not married to that woman.
LEADMALE:i think rosie's pretty much okay about that, too.
LEADMALE:if my woman ever talked to me that way, you know what i'd say to her? yeah"get back in the house, mom.
LEADFEMALE:" hi, you guys.
OTHERFEMALE:how you doing? dAN: how was the mall? oh, it was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:we ate corn dogs by the pound.
LEADMALE:we sure did.
OTHERMALE:dWIGHT: hey, jackie.
LEADMALE:hi.
OTHERFEMALE:oh, dwight.
LEADFEMALE:hi.
LEADMALE:poor thing.
LEADFEMALE:god, i hate it when a girl embarrasses herself like that.
SUPMALE:what are you talking about, dwight? it's obvious.
OTHERMALE:the woman wants me.
SUPMALE:yeah, so does the animal research lab.
SUPFEMALE:roseanne, look at this.
LEADFEMALE:rOSEANNE: ooh! isn't this the sweetest thing? marked down from 89.
OTHERMALE:99.
SUPMALE:wow.
LEADFEMALE:this is the kind of thing men love.
OTHERFEMALE:or you could wear a sign that said "free sample.
SUPMALE:" get out.
OTHERMALE:you see, if i wear this, i'll feel more feminine.
LEADMALE:and if i feel more feminine, i'll radiate this mysterious sensuality and men will flock to me.
LEADFEMALE:they won't know what it is, but they'll want it.
OTHERFEMALE:yeah, that's kind of the way they feel about chili.
LEADFEMALE:mom, look at the ankle bracelet aunt jackie bought me.
LEADMALE:cute.
SUPFEMALE:you know, dan bought me one of those when we first got married, and he had it engraved.
SUPMALE:it said "p.
LEADMALE:o.
LEADFEMALE:w.
SUPFEMALE:" i also got six colors of blush.
SUPMALE:crystal's gonna help me find my perfect shade.
SUPMALE:let's do it, sugar.
SUPFEMALE:i'll have you looking like a cover girl.
LEADFEMALE:rOSEANNE: once again, the mall has turned out to be the ultimate zen experience.
SUPMALE:roseanne, come here.
LEADFEMALE:you got to see this.
LEADMALE:dwight's out here balancing beer cans on his head.
LEADMALE:he usually don't take his vacation till summer.
LEADFEMALE:he's doing three cans.
LEADMALE:that's hard to do.
SUPFEMALE:well, not when you're in love.
SUPMALE:what you're witnessing is the rarely-seen primitive mating dance of the north american grease monkey.
LEADMALE:and guess who he's dancing for, sister.
SUPMALE:hint, hint, hint.
OTHERMALE:i was down at his hardware store the other day and was following me around like a puppy.
LEADFEMALE:he's kind of cute.
LEADMALE:cute? i bet his parents are brother and sister.
OTHERFEMALE:i could do worse.
SUPMALE:you have done worse, jackie.
LEADMALE:well, maybe you're right, i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:he is single, and he has his own business.
LEADMALE:and he's never been in prison.
OTHERMALE:i think he likes women.
LEADFEMALE:well, when you consider the meat market in lanford, he's not so bad.
LEADMALE:yeah, he kind of reminds me of a big ol' rump roast.
LEADFEMALE:no, there's some good raw material out there.
SUPMALE:this guy's got potential.
SUPFEMALE:with a little work, he could get whipped into shape.
LEADMALE:look what you did with dan.
LEADFEMALE:true, but i'm a unique and incredible woman, jackie.
LEADMALE:and you're saying that i'm not? yeah.
LEADFEMALE:i'll have you know that somebody like me who is tolerant and sensitive and insane.
LEADMALE:i could show you a whole nother side of dwight.
LEADFEMALE:i could go out there right now and show you a dwight that behaves like a perfect gentleman.
LEADFEMALE:oh, right.
SUPMALE:i'll do it, too.
LEADFEMALE:you know, jackie, you really should try earth sometime.
LEADMALE:i think you might like it.
OTHERMALE:i'll tell you what, fellas.
LEADMALE:you let women in as umpires, you can kiss the game of baseball right down the toilet.
SUPFEMALE:wOMAN: freddy, you know what time it is?! coming, honey.
OTHERMALE:all right, fellas, i got to go.
SUPFEMALE:yeah, you better run.
LEADMALE:i hear the warden calling you.

LEADMALE:how was your little shopping trip there, jackie? oh, it was good.
LEADFEMALE:we hit every sale.
LEADFEMALE:yeah? bet you like those malls, huh? all them shoe stores.
LEADMALE:jackie loves buying shoes, don't you, jackie? i do happen to enjoy it, roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:boy, the way you ladies buy shoes, you'd think y'all had six feet on every leg.
SUPMALE:dwight, what did you do with the distributor cap? i didn't have it.
SUPMALE:yeah, you did.
SUPMALE:it's over there somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:oh! oh, oh, doggone it.
LEADMALE:what's wrong? it's this darn money clip, it's nothin'.
SUPFEMALE:it keeps poking me in the leg.
OTHERMALE:look at that, would ya.
SUPFEMALE:i'm losing all my darn money.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, i guess that itty, bitty little money clip's just too much for that great, big wad of yours, huh, dwight? i like to keep my money neat is all.
OTHERMALE:neatness is an admirable quality in a gentleman.
LEADMALE:i'm a really neat gentleman.
LEADFEMALE:dwight, the distributor cap's not over here.
SUPFEMALE:it's somewhere else then.
SUPMALE:where? in the garage, maybe.
LEADMALE:oh, gee.
LEADFEMALE:i think my watch is wrong, jackie, 'cause it says it's almost 4:00.
LEADFEMALE:but it couldn't be almost 4:00.
OTHERFEMALE:'cause if it was almost 4:00, i'd hear this truck purring like a race car.
LEADMALE:it ain't over till it's over.
SUPFEMALE:you guys gonna get this tank up and rattling again? yeah.
LEADFEMALE:pretty sorry piece of scrap iron, isn't it? you ever seen my car? that lime green convertible? yeah.

OTHERMALE:it can do 125 m.
OTHERFEMALE:p.
SUPFEMALE:h.
LEADFEMALE:'S.
LEADMALE:no wonder your mom wears her hair straight back.
LEADFEMALE:i can't find that damn distributor cap anywhere.
LEADMALE:did you look for it? no i was out there tearing up my garage just for the hell of it! well, dan, you should go look in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:why would it be in the kitchen? because everything in the free world ends up in the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:dwight.
OTHERFEMALE:huh? what did you do with the distributor cap? um, far left-hand corner of the tool shelf behind the motor oil.
LEADMALE:and you know what? you got five minutes and when i find that distributor cap, you're gonna be shoveling snow for the rest of your life.
LEADFEMALE:five minutes and 27 seconds.
LEADMALE:dARLENE: mom! i'm busy! i can't get your sewing machine to stop! oh, darlene, stay away from it! don't touch anything! it's a three-ring circus around here.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, and dan's the dancing bear.
LEADMALE:you know, dwight, i was talking to roseanne, and i told her that i thought you were a pretty good guy.
SUPMALE:really? yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:listen, jackie, um you know, ever since you were in my store last week, i've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:about what? uh, about you.
LEADMALE:really? really.
SUPMALE:oh! i've been thinking maybe you'd like me to come over to your place sometime.
LEADFEMALE:we can do that.
SUPMALE:yeah? yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:whoo.
LEADFEMALE:maybe i could give your engine a little tune-up.
SUPFEMALE:a tune-up? no, my car's okay.
LEADFEMALE:i'm talking about your engine.
LEADMALE:engines i tune stay tuned.
OTHERMALE:you know what i mean? yeah, i know what you mean, dwight.
LEADFEMALE:i'll tell you what, jackie, with a chassis like yours, it'll be a pleasure to pop your hood.
LEADMALE:what do you say? i say i think you just blew it.
LEADMALE:hey, guy.
LEADFEMALE:yeah.
SUPMALE:you okay? oh, sure.
LEADMALE:i was only asking her out 'cause she's your sister-in-law.
LEADFEMALE:hey, man, her loss.
LEADFEMALE:why can't i meet a guy who's interested in something other than getting his hands on my chassis? well, jackie, i'm sure there's three or four guys like that left in the world.
LEADFEMALE:they just ain't in my driveway.
OTHERFEMALE:if i could meet a guy with half a brain, an ounce of courage, and a little bit of heart, i'd fall in love.
LEADMALE:follow the yellow brick road.
OTHERMALE:mom and jackie, which is my perfect shade? we put three different blushes on her cheek.
SUPFEMALE:pick the one you like best.
LEADMALE:oh, i like it over here.
LEADFEMALE:this looks great over there.
SUPMALE:mom, there's no blush there.
LEADMALE:i like this middle one.
LEADMALE:that's the one crystal picked.
LEADFEMALE:it's called "pinch of plum.
LEADFEMALE:" yummy.
LEADFEMALE:honey, you put on that blush like i showed you, you'll have the boys standing in line.
LEADMALE:thanks, crystal.
LEADMALE:well, this has been fun, but i have to get home.
LEADMALE:bye, dan.
LEADMALE:i'll see you, crystal.
LEADMALE:rOSEANNE: it's 4:00.
LEADMALE:hark! i believe i hear a dirty oven calling you.
SUPFEMALE:it's fine, you win your stupid bet.
LEADFEMALE:but i was under a handicapyou took away my best man.
LEADMALE:what are you talking about? i'm talking about the joke you played on dwight.
LEADFEMALE:i don't know how you can feel good about winning when my buddy's crushed.
LEADMALE:crushed? you leveled that guy.
LEADFEMALE:dan, i went out there to give him every chance.
LEADMALE:he acted like a pig.
LEADMALE:i know the guy ain't exactly prince charming, but every time i've needed him, he's been there for me.
SUPMALE:he's a human being, jackie.
LEADFEMALE:he's got feelings.
SUPFEMALE:he's right, jackie.
LEADMALE:how could you turn down a guy with a lime green monster? i thought you were gonna stay out of this.
LEADFEMALE:i did, and that's why it's all messed up.
LEADFEMALE:dan, i swear, i went out there to give him a chance.
SUPMALE:a chance? a chance to look like a jerk? but he's so good at it.
LEADFEMALE:go ahead and joke.
LEADMALE:meanwhile, my buddy's sitting out there trying to scrape his pride off the driveway.
OTHERFEMALE:oh, dan, get off it.
SUPFEMALE:honey, you didn't see the look on that poor guy's face.
LEADFEMALE:he's scarred for life.
LEADFEMALE:he'll never get over it.
LEADMALE:excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:jackie, could you move your car? you're blocking me in.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, i'll move it.
SUPMALE:i'm gonna give your friend dwight a ride home.
SUPMALE:he's not feeling too good, and his mother has his car.
LEADMALE:whoa.
OTHERMALE:catch ya later, big guy.
LEADFEMALE:guess he got over it.
LEADFEMALE:listen to thatpurring like a kitten.
LEADFEMALE:and it's only 10:30.
SUPFEMALE:remember how we used to go to the drive-in every saturday night? yeah, we'd put the kids in pajamas.
LEADMALE:then we'd pop that big bag of corn.
LEADMALE:that was really fun, wasn't it? i can't believe they tore down that old drive-in.
OTHERMALE:and put up that incredibly beautiful mini-mall.
LEADFEMALE:the kids always fall asleep during the second feature, and we get romantic.
OTHERFEMALE:you mean you'd get romantic.
SUPFEMALE:of course i would.
SUPMALE:you'd put your head on my shoulder, and we'd cuddle up real close, and you'd look right up there at the screen.
LEADFEMALE:can you see it? yeah.
LEADFEMALE:what are they playing? "guns of navarone.
LEADMALE:" nah, i don't wanna watch that again.
SUPFEMALE:what do you wanna watch? "doctor zee-vaygo.
OTHERMALE:" all right, i could see that.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, see the snow falling and the trains pulling into the station? yeah, she's there waiting for him.
SUPFEMALE:yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:and he steps down off the train.
LEADFEMALE:their eyes meet.
SUPMALE:he walks over, he reaches out and takes her hand and says, "how would you like me to pop your hood?"
SUPFEMALE:
