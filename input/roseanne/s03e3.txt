SUPFEMALE:Maybe he's dead.
OTHERMALE:It's over.
SUPMALE:Bag him and tag him.
SUPMALE:Mom, help me with my hair.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? It just lays there and does nothing.
LEADMALE:Trying to look all grown up for Robert? Get human.
LEADMALE:I hear he does the nasty with college girls.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I hope he gets extra credit for that.
OTHERMALE:He just dated some senior who takes some college classes.
LEADMALE:No big deal.
SUPFEMALE:No, of course not.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think, Dan? Pigtails? Works for me.
SUPFEMALE:Just forget it.
LEADMALE:I'll do it myself.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck covering up those fresh zits tonight, Princess.

OTHERFEMALE:I sat her down and said, "Becky, don't.
SUPFEMALE:" Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:She'll never get undressed in front of a guy.
SUPFEMALE:She thinks her butt's too big.
OTHERMALE:I've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you should talk to her.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should talk to her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, good point, my pet.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I'll have the talk with her.
LEADMALE:We're not telling her to go have sex.
SUPFEMALE:She doesn't need our permission.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell her never, never trust guys because we lie big time.
LEADFEMALE:I had this buddy Very successful with ladies.
LEADFEMALE:He'd tell them they wouldn't get pregnant if they jumped up and down afterwards.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Phil Diangelo.
LEADMALE:How did you know about that? You know, I believe I will have that talk with Becky.
OTHERFEMALE:I told you about that, right? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:And a 9er for Brian and a 7 for Chicago skinny and his faithful sidekick Shrimpo.

OTHERMALE:Hit me.
OTHERMALE:10 and bust.
OTHERFEMALE:Too bad, suckers.
SUPMALE:There's a town in the desert with bright lights waiting for you, boy.
SUPMALE:Too bad you're going to the movies, dad.
SUPMALE:The bulls game will be great.
SUPMALE:I'd love to watch the game, but Debra Winger's coughing up a lung at the cineplex.
LEADFEMALE:In Dolby.
LEADMALE:How come we can't ever do anything fun with Gary and Jackie? Because they're family.
LEADMALE:Did you talk to Becky I will.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:You look incredible.
SUPMALE:Really? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Get in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Um What do you know about birth control? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I swear.
LEADMALE:Really.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to be like the talk, right? Here.
LEADMALE:It's easier to squirm sitting down.
LEADMALE:I'm not sleeping with anyone, if that's what you're worried about.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, Becky.
SUPMALE:Would you be willing to swear on a Bible to make it official? Mom, I know all about birth control.
LEADFEMALE:So then you know about not getting pregnant by jumping up and down afterwards? Brian, let's go shoot some hoops until the game starts.
LEADFEMALE:Can I come? No.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Hey, Gary.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Jacks, you and Rosie pick another female movie to torture us with? What's wrong, Dan? Can't handle a little emotion and sensitivity? Oh, yeah, right.
SUPMALE:I love you, but I'm dying.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You can't die because I'm dying.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? What's killing you? A woman's disease.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, me, too.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Like they'd really have the same disease.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Roseanne? Kitchen.
OTHERMALE:Giving Becky the zero population growth speech.
LEADMALE:Really? Maybe she could use some help.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not bragging, but when it comes to birth control, I've tried To read just about every book on the subject.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Beat it.
LEADMALE:We're talking.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm going to get a glass of water.
SUPFEMALE:I have to go in the store and buy condoms myself? God, how embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to buy them.
LEADMALE:You could use the rhythm method.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, does it work? Ask your brother.
LEADMALE:Thirsty.
OTHERFEMALE:What about the sponge? Is that pretty much foolproof? Well, I don't have any statistics on this kind of stuff Um-hum.
SUPMALE:But then why not hear it from an expert? You're on, professor Jackie.
LEADMALE:Well, if you're sure.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Now, although some of your sponges can help prevent some disease, they're only about 80% effective against pregnancy, so better still is your condom-sponge combo.
LEADMALE:Used correctly, we're talking Fort Knox security at a price you can afford.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling mom.
SUPFEMALE:But doesn't all that stuff kill the mood? Not as much as a screaming baby with a loaded diaper.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's Robert.
LEADMALE:We're through, right? Well, you tell me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm still not going to do anything.
LEADMALE:Well, now that's 100% effective.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Uh Mom couldn't talk to us about birth control.
LEADMALE:She couldn't even talk about sex.
LEADMALE:Sex.
OTHERMALE:She told me it was something people did in Europe.
LEADMALE:She did try and talk about it once, remember? She said if we let a boy go all the way, then we would be called loose or slutty, like that was going to stop us.
SUPMALE:She should have told us we'd be called mommy.
SUPFEMALE:So What did you tell your girls? What? About having sex.
LEADMALE:You were right there.
LEADFEMALE:You heard what I said.
OTHERFEMALE:That was birth control.
LEADMALE:Same thing.
LEADFEMALE:It is not.
LEADMALE:It is, too.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, I'm not talking about mechanics.
SUPFEMALE:I'm talking about when a guy kisses you behind your ear, and you start getting all weird.
LEADFEMALE:These are my daughters you're talking about, Jackie.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, I'm amazed.
LEADMALE:This isn't like you at all.
LEADMALE:You know who? I am not like mom! Give us a break.
SUPMALE:Jordan's missed three in a row.
LEADFEMALE:It looks like he's pushing the ball.
OTHERFEMALE:He should be popping it.
LEADFEMALE:So he gets more backspin.
LEADFEMALE:Time out.
LEADMALE:Bulls.
SUPFEMALE:Finally.
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Here come the bimbo cheerleaders.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe he's not getting enough arc on the ball.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think, Brian? Brian? Huh? You actually like watching those dancing potato heads? Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wow.
SUPMALE:They're all doing splits.
OTHERMALE:Oh, did I say potato heads? I was wrong.
SUPMALE:I must have meant geniuses.
LEADMALE:So, uh, what about the cheerleaders at school? What about them? You think they're pretty? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Some of them.
SUPFEMALE:You won't believe what Vicki Womack said yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:She said I should try out for cheerleader.
LEADFEMALE:Good one.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:That's what I said.
SUPMALE:I'm not even close to being pretty enough, right? You're just not the right type, that's all.
LEADMALE:I think cheerleaders are stupid.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:Hey, Brian.
LEADMALE:What? What was that for? For thinking cheerleaders are stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't think they're stupid.
LEADMALE:I think they're complete idiots.
OTHERMALE:That movie was so sad, so warm, so loving.
LEADMALE:I want a beer.
LEADMALE:They're in the trunk.
LEADMALE:Becky's in the front room with a boy.
LEADMALE:Oh Becky.
SUPMALE:Darlene? Hi, mommy.
OTHERMALE:Uh, we'd better go.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Are you crazy? Hey, sports fans.
SUPMALE:How was the game? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like to hear the final score.
LEADMALE:The Bulls lost, I think.
LEADMALE:What, you guys been wrestling? What did she do, Bri, pin you down? Brian, it's been fun watching the game with you, but it's time for you to go home.
SUPMALE:Bye, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:See you at school tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Come back soon, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be upstairs.
LEADMALE:Good night, kiddo.
LEADMALE:What? Dan, they were making out.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Did you notice how her blouse was, uh Like it hadn't been on her back the whole night.
SUPMALE:That's great.
SUPMALE:That's just great.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? I want to make sure Brian gets home all right.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Some big guy in a truck might plow him over.
LEADMALE:What, did you forget your shotgun? Darlene! Yelling at her won't solve anything.
SUPFEMALE:I want to explain that she's not to touch boys.
SUPMALE:If you do that, she'll have a family of four by the time she graduates.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Go to your room.
SUPFEMALE:It's really not all that bad.
LEADFEMALE:Not now, Jackie, all right? I was her age when Doug Brock got to second base with me.
SUPFEMALE:It was during a football game.
LEADMALE:We were under a big blanket.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, buy me a cup of coffee? I'm helping, Gary.
SUPMALE:I'll be at home if you need me.
LEADMALE:Take it easy, Dan.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, Darlene's 14 years old.
LEADMALE:Well, Becky was 14 when she started dating.
LEADFEMALE:Becky's not Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:She's not stupid enough to get caught groping on her parents' couch.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean that.
LEADMALE:Darlene's different.
SUPMALE:She plays sports.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she's got a new sport.
LEADFEMALE:You're just all upset because you and Darlene are so close.
SUPMALE:I'm close with Becky, too.
LEADMALE:You never got upset about Becky doing this.
SUPFEMALE:Becky's older.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:It's about the fact that you all watch games on TV together and work in the yard together, and you shoot hoopies out in the driveway.
SUPMALE:Hoopies.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not excited about it either, but it's not the end of the world.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, face it, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Your son is becoming a woman.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How did it go? Great.
SUPMALE:I'm going upstairs and jump up and down now.
OTHERMALE:Good night, Becky.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's just you.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:How was your date? Well, he's a great kisser, not that you'd know the difference.
OTHERMALE:Did you get felt up? No.
LEADMALE:I did.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:Me and Brian made out tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:What? You never even went out.
LEADFEMALE:So? We played basketball almost every day.
LEADFEMALE:It's not the same thing.
SUPMALE:How do you know he won't tell everybody at school? I told him I'd punch his face in.
LEADFEMALE:That could work.
LEADFEMALE:Mom and Dad caught us.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god.
OTHERFEMALE:Did they freak? Not yet.
LEADMALE:So how was it? The kissing was pretty good.
LEADMALE:Well, what about the other stuff? Better than volleyball and yet not quite as good as hockey.
LEADMALE:Look, Darlene, you can't be doing this, ok? You got to make guys treat you a certain way.
LEADMALE:You call the shots.
SUPFEMALE:Make them beg, right? Basically.
LEADFEMALE:My dainty daughters.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm so proud of you.
SUPMALE:How long have you been spying? 15 years.
LEADMALE:I'm getting good, huh? So is it official? Am I grounded forever? Why, no.
LEADFEMALE:We're throwing a special debutante party to celebrate this special moment.
SUPMALE:Your dad's on the phone hiring the band.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Torture me, then ground me.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to tell me all about it, lover girl.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:I have a better idea.
SUPFEMALE:Don't tell me, and I'll be surprised when I read your diary.
LEADMALE:You're hysterical.
LEADMALE:So you really go for this dating stuff, huh? I wanted to see what it was like, so I kissed him.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't have to drown my face in mascara like some Barbie dolls who shall remain nameless.
OTHERFEMALE:So you really showed Becky, huh? That's not why I did it.
SUPMALE:At first, maybe, but then it was different.
OTHERFEMALE:And then, maybe, things went a little too far? Maybe.
LEADMALE:You think he'll ever talk to me again? Well, you did use him like a cheap piece of meat.
SUPMALE:Guys love that.
SUPMALE:What about you and Robert? Any wedding plans I should know about while your dad's hiring the band? Oh, right.
SUPFEMALE:Like I'll let him pick the music.
