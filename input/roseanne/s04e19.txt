LEADMALE:Dan, go up there.

LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I guess if they don't listen to reason, They're sure going to listen to me.
LEADMALE:Now, listen up! There will be no talking, no giggling or laughing, No playing music, no singing, No animal noises, No doing whatever the hell you were doing When you were making That peg-leg kind of thumping noise, No bird calls, no bouncing the ball, And no jumping on the bed, or I'm coming up there!
