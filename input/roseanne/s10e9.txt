LEADMALE:ROSEANNE: Dan? Dan! My knee went out.
LEADMALE:I sat down, and I can't get up.
SUPMALE:Fire! Mom, are you okay? No, I'm stuck on the toilet! Yo, Top Gun, wake up.
LEADFEMALE:Charlie's in trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom's yelling "fire" in the bathroom, and I'm not going in.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Dan! Hello, buttercup.
SUPFEMALE:May I be of service? Just give a good yank.
SUPMALE:Upsy-daisy.
LEADMALE:Did you make the appointment for your knee surgery yet? You know how doctors are, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:They say they can see you in a month, and then when you tell them you can't stand the pain any longer, they say, "We'll see you in a month.
OTHERFEMALE:" Quit stalling.
LEADFEMALE:We don't have the money, Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:And a surgeon is not gonna give it his best shot when you're paying him with a coffee can full of nickels.
LEADMALE:I'm on it.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get the next drywall job, no matter how low I have to bid.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't start the negotiations like that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna cut costs by doing what everybody else is doing.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me you're gonna hire illegals.
OTHERMALE:Hey! I'm also gonna use substandard materials.
SUPMALE:You know, if the union finds out you're hiring those guys, they're gonna kick you out.
SUPMALE:That's a risk I'm gonna have to take.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna stand by and watch you suffer anymore, and I'm not gonna let you go back to taking too many pain pills.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't want you to sacrifice anything for me, Dan, 'cause that would give you the upper hand, and that's not how this marriage was built.
LEADFEMALE:"Roseanne" is taped in front of a live audience.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, honey.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I didn't think I'd get used to eating heart-smart, but this turkey bacon isn't bad.
SUPFEMALE:You know what would make it taste better? If you fed it to a big ol' pig and then ate him.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, morning, Conners! I brought doughnuts.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Finally, a man bringing me something I really want.
LEADMALE:Do you need another wife? Uh, let's see That's another birthday to remember.
LEADFEMALE:I'll ask Anne-Marie, yeah.
LEADMALE:She'll be fine with it.
SUPMALE:We already decided when you guys die, we're gonna be old-lady lesbians that go on bus trips together.
OTHERFEMALE:Bus trips? We left you nothin'! Hey, Chuck Huh? Didn't your uncle have hip surgery a while back? How'd he afford that? County Hospital.
SUPMALE:Well, he actually had both hips done because they did the wrong one first.
SUPMALE:He should've gone to Mexico.
LEADFEMALE:They charge, like, half of what they charge here.
LEADFEMALE:I've heard that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh! Here's a doctor in Juarez who only charges a grand for a new knee, and he'll throw in moving your nipples for free.
LEADMALE:Do I have to? What if I like my nipples where they are? Doesn't say.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'm taking the rest of these down to the union office.
LEADMALE:Okay, did you put in our bid on that new condo project yet? I'm working on it.
SUPFEMALE:So, you're really gonna hire those other guys instead of Chuck? He's been your best friend for 30 years.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the reminder.
SUPMALE:JACKIE: Soccer star coming through! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you do? They put me in for one play, and I accidentally scored a goal for the other team.
LEADFEMALE:The winning goal.
SUPFEMALE:Man, Jackie, Dan is still talking about going non-union.
SUPMALE:You know, he's gonna lose everything he's built.
LEADMALE:I got to find another way to pay for this knee.
LEADFEMALE:You have anything you could sell? We should go through all those old boxes in the basement, you know, and see if there's anything of value in them.
LEADFEMALE:"We"? You always think that I have nothing to do, that I'm free to help you whenever you want.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:That was rude.
SUPMALE:Are you available? Yes, I am.
LEADMALE:But if you'd asked me two weeks from Thursday, I wouldn't be.
LEADMALE:Unless it was the afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Wake up, Morticia! Leave me alone.
LEADMALE:I didn't get off work until 2:00.
LEADMALE:Mom said you weren't making a lot of tips, so I brought you something that could help.
LEADMALE:It's called the "waitress's best friend.
SUPMALE:" Oh, man, this is perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a push-up bra.
SUPMALE:It'll make you look anatomically correct.
LEADFEMALE:When do men ever have to do anything like this to earn a living? You know, your attitude is part of your problem.
LEADFEMALE:When you see a customer, how do you greet them? I say, "What do you want?" That's what you say when a bum touches you.
SUPMALE:Look, the kind of guys you're waiting on are very simple creatures.
SUPFEMALE:All you got to do is tell them you like something about them.
LEADMALE:Like, when a guy orders, say, "That's what I drink.
SUPFEMALE:" Look, I really appreciate you trying to help, but we're very different people.
LEADMALE:I'm kind of an introvert, and, um I want to get the words right here You're an alcoholic tramp.
SUPMALE:Why do we have to be hurtful? All I'm trying to say is you're not an appealing person.
LEADMALE:You will have to flirt And probably a lot To take care of your kids.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't even flirt to have my kids.
LEADFEMALE:I just said, "What do you want?" Hey, look at this.
LEADFEMALE:I found Nana Mary's favorite hat.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that.
LEADMALE:Talk about passing down something that everybody can use.
SUPMALE:Oh, Jackie, look! I found Magdalena.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:You know how many years it took me to get over Mom treating that evil, glassy-eyed demon better than us? Yeah, you sound like you're over it.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Oh, she wouldn't let us play with it, wouldn't let us touch it.
LEADFEMALE:"Oh, don't touch her hair.
OTHERFEMALE:" I'm gonna brush her hair right now.
OTHERMALE:No! Don't! Don't do anything to her 'til we find out if she's worth any money.
OTHERMALE:Mom said she was a Kestner.
LEADFEMALE:"This is my Kestner.
SUPMALE:Isn't my Kestner precious?" No, she isn't! Oh, my God, Roseanne! She's worth $5,000.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom's right She is worth more than both of us put together.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but that's not what you whisper to your kids when you're tucking them in.
LEADMALE:I think we should take her down and try to sell her at that antique mall.
OTHERMALE:This little nightmare might pay for my knee.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, it's a diary.
SUPMALE:This must be Mom's.
LEADMALE:Eugh.
SUPFEMALE:"Dear Diary, today my wonderful mommy brushed my hair with my special brush.
LEADMALE:" This is Magdalena's diary! Eww! Ohhh! Hey, do you know if it's still raining out? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm stuck in this windowless prison, like you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, um I like something about you.
SUPMALE:I'll I'll have it when I get back.
SUPMALE:Before you go, I'll have a sloe gin fizz.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, that's a great order.
SUPMALE:That's exactly what I drink.
SUPFEMALE:Been drinking it since I was a kid.
SUPMALE:Hey, don't run away.
LEADFEMALE:We've been trying to get one of you girls all night.
LEADFEMALE:What can I get you? Uh, six shots of Jameson, 12 Coors Lights.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great order.
SUPMALE:That's exactly what I drink.
LEADMALE:Well, bring an extra one for you.
LEADMALE:And, uh, how about a kiss for good luck? I'm not gonna kiss you.
LEADMALE:'cause it'd be too darn hard to stop! Can I borrow a clean bar rag? DEAN: You know, Kestners are amongst the most highly sought-after dolls of the '20s.
SUPMALE:And it looks like, from the condition, she's been cared for by someone who had no children of her own to love.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, she was barren and died alone.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, it looks like she's been repaired.
SUPFEMALE:Ah! This is not this doll's original body.
LEADFEMALE:So I would say that she's worth $100.
LEADMALE:A disappointment to the end! Can't you just strip her for spare parts? This is not just a doll.
LEADMALE:It's part Kestner.
LEADFEMALE:It's a treasure, family member, companion to a lonely boy who's afraid to get hit by the football.
SUPMALE:Well, what about 200 bucks just for the head? 'Cause, I mean, this is real human hair.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you could use it to build a friend in your basement.
OTHERFEMALE:Well Oh.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Where you at? At the end of my rope.
LEADMALE:Where are you? You better come home quick, honey.
SUPMALE:We're flooding.
LEADMALE:Ah, crap.
OTHERMALE:Okay, we're on our way.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, did you grab the kids' photos and their birth certificates? Of course I did! Whoa! Looks like you got a leak somewhere.
LEADMALE:Leak? I think this basement holds the water pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know I'd help you out, but you probably found someone cheaper.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a bad time, Chuck.
OTHERMALE:How about we talk later? I just ran into one of the Gonzalez brothers at Home Depot, and he said you're using his guys on the condo job? Is that true? I was gonna tell you.
SUPMALE:When? After you finished the job? Of course not.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I just can't afford you guys.
LEADFEMALE:"Y-You guys"? Ohhh.
LEADMALE:T-That's what happened.
LEADFEMALE:And I thought the whole time that we were friends.
LEADFEMALE:Turns out I was just one of the guys.
LEADMALE:I don't have a choice, man.
SUPMALE:I got responsibilities.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:And I'm still working construction because I like the way I look in the hat.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to do? I got three extra mouths to feed since Darlene moved back in.
LEADMALE:Roseanne started popping pills because we didn't have the money to fix her knee.
LEADMALE:And now I got 20 grand of water damage.
LEADMALE:I've spent my whole life hanging on by my fingertips, telling everybody not to worry, that I was gonna make it okay because that's my job.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now I can't promise that anymore.
SUPFEMALE:So, yeah it makes me sick.
SUPFEMALE:But I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to take care of my family, because I'm old, I'm tired, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm old, too.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm tired.
LEADFEMALE:And now I'm unemployed.
OTHERMALE:I always told you If I'm eating, you're eating.
LEADMALE:I'm not eating.
OTHERFEMALE:Holy crap! Hey, Chuck.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Rosie.
LEADMALE:How bad is it? Well, that depends.
SUPFEMALE:You didn't pick up any flood insurance while you were out, did you? All this water's gonna affect the foundation.
LEADMALE:Is there anything I can do to help? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Take this.
LEADMALE:It's not heavy enough to hold me underwater.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, everything's gonna be fine.
LEADMALE:Go on back upstairs and entertain the troops.
SUPFEMALE:Business as usual.
LEADFEMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Dan, lookit After 40 years, we finally got a pool.
SUPMALE:Yep.
LEADMALE:You guys have like a million boxes of Halloween stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we were a lot of fun before you got here.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, Aunt Jackie, back me up.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a little crazy, right? Perhaps it's a little extreme.
LEADFEMALE:These costumes are so lame.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe anybody would ever be scared by them.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, watch your mouth.
SUPFEMALE:We were famous for that stuff in these parts.
LEADMALE:Ow! Are you okay? Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
SUPMALE:I think it's my heart.
SUPMALE:Somebody call 911! Oh, my God! I hate you! Each and every single one of you! Don't say that.
OTHERFEMALE:It only makes them stronger.
LEADMALE:Alright, what we need here is a little prestidigitation.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, ladies and gentlemen, prepare for the return of d.j. Magic D.
LEADMALE:J who will amaze you with his feats of magic and mystery.
LEADFEMALE:Open the door.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe the storm will suck us out.
OTHERMALE:I want to be your assistant, like in the old days.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I need to pick somebody at random from the audience.
LEADMALE:You! You'll do fine.
LEADFEMALE:Me?! Yes, come on up here and hold "Blackstone's Ancient Book of Sorcery for Kids.
LEADFEMALE:" Uh-huh.

LEADMALE:The governor's trying to get him to declare a state of emergency.
OTHERMALE:Oh, wow.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADMALE:Half the state is underwater.
LEADFEMALE:They took all these senior citizens from one of those old folks' homes and put them on the roof of the building.
SUPMALE:That's great news.
LEADFEMALE:But it's also kind of sad, in a way.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, it's terribly sad.
LEADFEMALE:But if they declare a state of emergency, FEMA will give us some money to repair the basement.
OTHERMALE:I can do it for half of what they give us and use the rest for Rose's knee.
LEADMALE:Hoo! State of emergency! ALL: State of emergency! This is awful! You have young children rooting for other people's misery.
SUPMALE:He just declared it! State of emergency! Oh.

SUPMALE:It's, uh, about a brilliant, young novelist who works at a casino for research, pretending it's a real job.
SUPMALE:You know, I'm really glad that you're writing again.
OTHERFEMALE:It's inspiring.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:That means a lot to me, but, you know, let's manage expectations.
OTHERFEMALE:Who knows? Nothing may come of this.
SUPFEMALE:No, you got to believe in yourself, Mom! I mean, Stephen King was a janitor, and J.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPFEMALE:Rowling was a single mother living on welfare.
LEADMALE:They were losers, just like you.
LEADMALE:That's sweet.
LEADMALE:Good night, Harris.
LEADFEMALE:If you're gonna be writing at night, everyone at my school has Adderall, if you want some.
LEADMALE:Good night, Harris! Oh, and in case you're wondering, I am not taking any Adderall.
