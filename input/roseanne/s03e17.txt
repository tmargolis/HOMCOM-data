LEADFEMALE:Crystal, he brings you breakfast in bed? How was it? No, I mean the breakfast.
OTHERMALE:Well, of course Ed's going to do something romantic.
LEADMALE:It's Valentine's day, for crying out loud.
LEADMALE:Only the slimiest lowlife of a husband would forget you on Valentine's day.
SUPMALE:And he just came in.
SUPFEMALE:I got to go.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't forget.
LEADFEMALE:What did you get me? A surprise.
SUPMALE:To both of us, huh? Here.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least my son remembered.
LEADFEMALE:"Happy Valentine's day from your son.
SUPMALE:Love Warren.
LEADMALE:" Warren? The one I made was lousy.
LEADFEMALE:I would have loved it anyway, d.j. , because you made it with your own two hands.
LEADMALE:Is there gravy on this? Did you fish it out of the trash? Was that wrong? Keep going.
LEADFEMALE:You're making the old man look good.
LEADFEMALE:It's not too late if he asks tomorrow.
LEADMALE:He's not going to ask me anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Who ain't going to ask you anyway what? Can we just eat breakfast, please? We're all gathered together.
LEADMALE:This is the perfect time to get caught up.
LEADMALE:There are three other people to get caught up on.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Dan, you going to work today? Yep.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. , you got scouts? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, you still blonde? Yeah.
LEADMALE:So, Darlene, what's going on? It's just like you to get all gross about this.
LEADMALE:How come you can't talk behind my back like a normal mother? Ok, let's do it.
OTHERFEMALE:His name is Barry.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Get in here, Jackie.
LEADMALE:Darlene's got a boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Who? This guy she met playing basketball.
OTHERMALE:He's a sophomore.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, an older man.
LEADFEMALE:She really wants him to ask her to the Valentine's dance.
LEADMALE:I suggested she invite him over to help study math.
SUPFEMALE:I thought the helpless girl approach was better than her Larry bird thing.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to catch her groping, like with that last guy.
SUPMALE:This is completely different.
SUPFEMALE:She didn't even like that last guy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, then.
LEADMALE:Becky, what should I wear? I said the pink skirt.
LEADMALE:It's too short.
LEADMALE:She's knows nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like this Darlene-pink-skirtboy-too-short thing.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't like this whole husband-stupidforget-Valentine thing.
SUPMALE:I didn't forget.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, d.j. , I'll drop you off at school.
LEADFEMALE:Well Happy Valentine's day anyhow, honey.
LEADMALE:See? I'm not mad.
SUPFEMALE:So, Jackie.
LEADMALE:Uh, now that you're off the police force Ok, I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:Help me out here.
OTHERMALE:What does she want? I'm sure whatever you pick out would be Tell me! Lingerie.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no! She says you never buy her anything that makes her feel sexy.
OTHERMALE:I bought her cable, didn't I? It's what she wants.
LEADMALE:How about jewelry? She loves jewelry.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't have any of her own, but she admires it on others.
LEADMALE:You're embarrassed because you think you'll be the only man in the lingerie store, and everybody's going to be staring at you and thinking you're a pervert.
SUPMALE:You've been a great help.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, come on.
LEADMALE:A lot of guys do it.
LEADMALE:It's romantic.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't know.
LEADMALE:How am I even going to know if it fits? Try it on.
LEADFEMALE:Good brownies.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:They have nuts in them.
LEADFEMALE:They're good.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Nuts.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, she looks constipated.
LEADMALE:It's all those nuts.
OTHERMALE:She's fine.
OTHERFEMALE:She's just got to relax.
LEADFEMALE:Much better.
OTHERFEMALE:Ohh! Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:That's ok.
LEADMALE:I just go get something to clean that up.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, clean that up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he hates me.
SUPFEMALE:He does not.
LEADMALE:He thinks I'm a dork.
LEADMALE:Show him you're something special.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah A special dork, the head dork, the dork queen.
LEADMALE:Geez, Darlene.
SUPMALE:Try flirting a little.
LEADMALE:You know, smile, laugh, lean in and listen like what he's saying is important.
LEADFEMALE:Lean in and listen? Yeah, like this.
OTHERFEMALE:You're making this up.
SUPFEMALE:I'm only trying to help you out.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, ok.
LEADMALE:He's gorgeous, isn't he? He's cute.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, he's a god! This homework thing's kind of lame, but he came over, so he must like me, right? Why shouldn't he like you? You're funny, you're cute, you're wearing my clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:There is one problem.
LEADMALE:What? Right now he's out there with Mom alone.
LEADMALE:I figure when your husband forgets Valentine's day, you've got a right to say something, you know? I don't want to go busting his chops or nothing, but I want a little romance.
LEADFEMALE:Is that wrong? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:What's that, Lassie? You say Timmy fell down a mine shaft Up on Big Rock mountain, and grandpa's already up there waiting? I'd better get out there.
LEADMALE:Good girl.
LEADMALE:Your mom's nice.
LEADMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Uh, this is my sister Becky.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I've seen you in school.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like another brownie, Barry? Uh, no.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should take off.
LEADMALE:Uh, Barry, have you got your license yet? Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:I'm waiting to get a car.
LEADFEMALE:Ahh.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of car? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:What she said.
LEADMALE:My dream car is a red Corvette with a turbocharger, but I'll probably wind up with my aunt's gremlin.
OTHERFEMALE:What is she doing? Flirting? Well, god, I hope she doesn't hurt herself.
OTHERFEMALE:We're married 17 years, and he forgets Valentine's day.
LEADMALE:I'd divorce him if I were you.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going to reward him.
LEADFEMALE:So did Duke get you anything? Oh, he's such a sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:There were a lot of women in his life before we met.
LEADMALE:So for Valentine's day, he's going to have their names removed from his back.
SUPFEMALE:I'd kill for a guy like that.
SUPMALE:That's how I got him.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Hello! I'd like to speak with the manager please.
OTHERMALE:He's not here.
SUPMALE:He's never here.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's why they fired him and hired me.
OTHERFEMALE:Leon Carp, your new boss.
OTHERMALE:Which leads me to ask, why aren't you working? Nobody's asking for anything.
SUPFEMALE:Attitude We'll cover that later.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, new rules.
LEADFEMALE:Ready? First when your shift starts, you start.
OTHERMALE:If you're five minutes late, you're docked five minutes pay.
LEADMALE:Wow! That's almost 30 cents.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I got to go to the bathroom.
LEADMALE:Here's a buck.
LEADMALE:That's very funny.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Now, to continue on I've been hearing that the customers like to come in here because they enjoy themselves.
LEADFEMALE:You're friendly.
SUPMALE:You chat.
OTHERMALE:We think it's our sexy uniforms.
OTHERFEMALE:Why is this restaurant in the middle of this store? Because when our customers are hungry, we do not want them to leave.
SUPMALE:After they've eaten, we want them back out there buying things.
LEADMALE:Should we be mean? Not mean.
OTHERFEMALE:Brusque.
OTHERFEMALE:That's going to cut down on our tips.
SUPMALE:You'll make it up in volume.
SUPFEMALE:You want us to work twice as hard for the same money? That's great.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I got to go.
LEADMALE:Are you enjoying that coffee? Yes, I am.
LEADFEMALE:That's wonderful! Get her out of here.
LEADFEMALE:She is definitely cute.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you ask her? Her whole family was there.
LEADFEMALE:Her sister was hanging out with us.
LEADFEMALE:Dance is tomorrow, bud.
SUPFEMALE:I think she likes me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not sure.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:What? That's her mother.
SUPMALE:Look, guys, don't, please.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:So all you guys know what you want? Barry does.
SUPFEMALE:But she's not on the menu.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to go.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? It's too embarrassing here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it is not.
SUPMALE:I know you like my daughter, right? Ok.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:I'm a young, hip, happening kind of mother here.
LEADMALE:I totally dig this teen romance stuff.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm giving you some advice, Barry.
SUPMALE:Call her, dude.
LEADMALE:It's more complicated than that.
OTHERMALE:I mean, Darlene It's not complicated.
OTHERFEMALE:You sure? Just promise me you'll have a small wedding, then you'll move away.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, this is Barry Parker.
LEADMALE:Is this Darlene? I'll get her.
SUPMALE:Darlene! Hurry! It's him! It's him! It's him! It's him! Now I'm the kind of girl I hate.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the phone.
LEADMALE:Here she is, Bar.
LEADMALE:What? I wanted to talk to you, Becky.
LEADMALE:Do you have a date for the Valentine's dance? Hey, Bonnie, I'm sleeping over at your house tonight, ok? I was hardly here.
LEADMALE:Exactly how did I steal him away? "Well, hello, Barry, y'all going to be driving sometime soon?" Oh, Darlene, I told you, he's not even my type.
SUPMALE:He's not good enough for you? He's 50 times better than the mutants you date.
LEADMALE:You're not making any sense.
SUPMALE:I don't have to.
LEADMALE:I just have to be more careful with my boyfriends when my sister's feeling feisty.
SUPFEMALE:Mother.
SUPMALE:What's going on? Barry called and asked me out instead of Darlene.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Would you tell her I didn't do anything? Darlene, you know, it's not Take her side like always.
SUPMALE:She's just your little Princess.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? She never takes my side.
LEADMALE:We're always arguing.
LEADMALE:She makes my life miserable.
SUPFEMALE:Am I right? Well, I do what I can.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't care what she says.
OTHERMALE:You hated the idea that I could have a boyfriend.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't have to take this.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Run away, Becky, like you always do.
OTHERMALE:You know, Darlene, this isn't Becky's fault.
LEADFEMALE:This happens to all girls.
LEADFEMALE:It really does.
SUPFEMALE:I promise, it'll get better.
LEADFEMALE:"Tomorrow's another day.
SUPMALE:" "It's not the end of the world.
LEADFEMALE:" Did I leave anything out? There's plenty more fish in the sea.
SUPMALE:That about covers it.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think? Pervert? No.
LEADMALE:Husband.
SUPMALE:He's starting to buckle.
SUPMALE:I got him.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Can I help you? No, thanks, I'm I'm just looking.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm not looking.
LEADMALE:I didn't come to look.
OTHERMALE:I don't enjoy doing that kind of thing.
SUPMALE:Why don't you believe me? Something for your wife.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Valentine's day? Thank you.
LEADMALE:How sweet.
SUPMALE:What do you think she would like? A teddy? A nightie? How about a robe? Robe yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:A big long robe.
LEADMALE:Do you want silk, lace, see-through? Can I have a glass of water? Amy.
SUPMALE:Good construction here.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to sit down? Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:There, there.
LEADFEMALE:Calm down.
LEADFEMALE:It's ok.
OTHERFEMALE:You said a robe, but I think she'll really like this.
LEADMALE:See how sheer it is.
SUPMALE:Feel it.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:It won't bite.
SUPMALE:It's ok.
OTHERMALE:I know you want to.
LEADFEMALE:It's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Wrap it up.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Sir, are you ok? I got to go my car.
LEADMALE:Arnie.
SUPMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:My car broke down I was outside Bye.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:If Darlene's in the bedroom, I'll be in the living room.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I hate this.
LEADMALE:You remember Kenny Billows, my first love? The guy that told you you should cut your hair short like Twiggy's, and you'd look real cute.
LEADMALE:So I cut it.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, he was wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember what I was like after he dumped me? You wore hats.
LEADFEMALE:I stayed in my room for three days.
LEADMALE:You listened to me cry, fed me pizza, and got me to put on make-up.
SUPMALE:I was good then.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad I can't do that for Darlene now.
SUPFEMALE:I never could have taken that to Mom, so maybe what Darlene needs Hey, I got an idea.
SUPMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:It was my idea.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Becky, how's that book? Incredibly boring.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Becky, that's not your fault that that Barry kid asked you out.
SUPMALE:I mean, you're very pretty, and you're a sophomore, and you're comfortable around boys.
OTHERMALE:And it's not his fault, either.
LEADFEMALE:It certainly isn't Darlene's fault.
LEADFEMALE:The book is better than this, mother.
OTHERFEMALE:She really needs you now, Becky.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going up there.
LEADFEMALE:She'll just dump all over me.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Then she'll probably cry some more.
SUPMALE:It'll be an awful experience, and I'm glad I won't be having it.
LEADFEMALE:So why should I? You're the big sister.
LEADMALE:You get to date first and drive first.
LEADFEMALE:You get to do everything first.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene's going to be killing herself her whole life to catch up to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Give her a break.
LEADMALE:She needs somebody to unload on right now.
LEADMALE:This time I'm not good enough.
OTHERFEMALE:This is very, very nice of me.
OTHERFEMALE:I want big points.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it would be a selfless act, but at the last minute she pulled it out.
LEADMALE:I was never trying to catch up to you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? You wish you were me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Get out of here.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:That was the burden of my entire life Trying to hold myself back so you wouldn't feel overshadowed by my magnificence.
OTHERFEMALE:You're dreaming.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, could I see you? He got it.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADFEMALE:Guilt is a many-splendored thing.
LEADFEMALE:Coming, dearest.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you did get me something.
LEADMALE:For my wife on Valentine's day.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh! So nice.
LEADFEMALE:I made it with my own two little hands.
SUPMALE:Oh, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, I tried.
SUPMALE:I went to the underwear store and everything.
OTHERFEMALE:People were staring at me, leering.
OTHERMALE:I felt so cheap.
SUPMALE:"Dear Roseanne, "though this gift is not what you desire, "the sentiment is clear.
LEADMALE:"If you need proof I love you still, hell, Rosie, I'm still here.
SUPMALE:" "Love, Warren.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, Dan.
LEADMALE:I know you really do love me, you old goat.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to go try this on.
LEADFEMALE:Ba-a-a-a! Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:So how was the dance? It was ok.
LEADMALE:You can tell me.
SUPMALE:I'm not going to break down.
LEADFEMALE:It was really nice.
LEADMALE:Anybody there I might know? Barry showed up with Angela Dietz.
LEADFEMALE:She looks just like you.
SUPMALE:That's so gross.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:You know what I mean.
SUPMALE:So, did he spend the whole night gazing at you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Sort of.
LEADFEMALE:Did he ask you to dance? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:So? I thought, what would Darlene want me to do? So you punched him in the neck? I just told him to get lost.
OTHERMALE:Then I told Angela she was his second choice.
LEADFEMALE:So what did she do? Well, let's just say old Bar won't be dancing for a while.
SUPMALE:Cool.
SUPMALE:I can't look at you.
SUPMALE:
