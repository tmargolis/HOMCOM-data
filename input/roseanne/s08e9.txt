SUPFEMALE: Oh, Dan, tell Roseanne I borrowed the double boiler, not the stew pot, And the ladle, not the slotted spoon, okay? You want me to write that down? Jackie was here Took stuff.
SUPMALE:got it.
LEADMALE:Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm serious, because Roseanne might need the ladle And I just want her to know that I have it, okay? Jackie has the ladle.
LEADMALE:We have a ladle? Hey, I knew it, I knew it.
SUPMALE:There's still one credit card company willing to take a gamble on us.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, melanie mcphee, customer relations, You're about to lose your job.
LEADFEMALE:And she so looked forward to working with us.
LEADFEMALE:Hey hey hey.
SUPMALE:Ray wilson sent us two tickets To come and see him play in Chicago.
OTHERMALE:Stingray wilson, wow.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Man, did you even know he was back in town? Yes, I have heard something to that effect.
LEADMALE:Oh, those were good times when you used to play for him.
OTHERMALE:Not for him, with him.
SUPFEMALE:Some people thought I carried him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Like ringo carried john, paul and george.
LEADFEMALE:I held my own with him, didn't I, Rosie? Yeah, remember that time you guys played the county fairgrounds? You rocked that place.
LEADFEMALE:That was after I left the band.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well then who the hell was I making out with after the show? You know what, Dan? I'm starting to remember now and you were good.
LEADMALE:You were really good-really really good.
SUPMALE:Don't patronize me, Jackie, because I really was good.
LEADMALE:Rosie, you remember those gigs we played at the sportsman's lodge? We packed that joint five weekends in a row.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I remember you would have had six, But the owner bumped you guys for that wrestling bear.
SUPFEMALE:You were in a band? Yes, is that so hard to believe? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:A little, 'cause-No, sir.
SUPMALE:Hey, d.j. , what do you got there? Mice.
LEADFEMALE:Ho ho.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys.
LEADMALE:Oh, d.j. , they're great.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing with these cute little fellas? I'm bringing them to sell to the research lab.
OTHERFEMALE:What? I'm raking it in too.
SUPFEMALE:Look, last batch got me this watch.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. , it's blood money and it's wrong.
LEADMALE:I think your parents should know about this.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wait wait wait.
SUPFEMALE:Now what would it take to keep you quiet about this? You're trying to buy me off? You know, darlene's birthday is coming up.
SUPMALE:You could probably use a little extra cash.
SUPMALE:I don't need it that bad.
LEADMALE:I'll just get her something nice and simple With the money I do have.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, darlene's pretty understanding.
LEADFEMALE:Remember last year when all you did was give her a ride into the country? Now exactly how long did it take you to walk back from the country? mice do eat a lot of really fatty foods, Like cheese, So they probably wouldn't live that long anyway.
LEADMALE:Yeah, okay, whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see here.
SUPMALE:This ought to about cover it.
LEADFEMALE:Here, put a nice pretty bow on it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm trying really hard not to notice That you're sending me some nonverbal message.
LEADFEMALE:That or you've got rabies.
LEADMALE:Okay, fine, you want to get into this? Jackie made that comment about ringo.
LEADMALE:It made me feel like a complete idiot.
LEADMALE:You were standing right there and you didn't even come to my defense.
LEADMALE:I gave her a dirty look.
LEADMALE:You call that defending me? It wasn't just any dirty look, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:It was my combination nostril flare, Lip curl and half a squint.
LEADFEMALE:Go spit.
LEADFEMALE:If you think i'm talented, say it.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're talented.
LEADFEMALE:You're just saying that.
LEADFEMALE:God, your old singing buddy comes back into town And now you're acting like your whole life has been a big mistake.
SUPMALE:Not my whole life, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so it's my fault, right? I had to make a choice.
LEADFEMALE:You made me feel like if I went on the road with ray, You wouldn't be there when I got back.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't about joining a band, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:You're using that as some excuse to avoid what's really going on here.
SUPFEMALE:What's really going on here? Do the words "midlife crisis" Mean anything to you? You are making no sense.
LEADMALE:Yes, I am, Dan.
LEADMALE:You are the very same age my dad was When he took up with that mistress.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Maybe I should check and see If his mistress is still available.
SUPMALE:Well, I think enough has been said here.
SUPMALE:good night.
LEADMALE:good night.
LEADFEMALE:You mean we're both actually going to sleep in our bed? Yes, if there's room.
SUPMALE:You win.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Hello.
LEADMALE:David, you've got to help me.
LEADMALE:A couple of the mice got loose.
SUPMALE:If my mom finds out, she's gonna kill me.
SUPMALE:If two mice live and one little boy is killed, Justice has been served.
SUPMALE:Hmm.
LEADMALE:I wonder what animal rights activist Darlene would think When she found out that you drove me Down to that lab with those mice.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't tell her.
LEADFEMALE:"Darlene, he just sat in the car counting his money While his furry friends were butchered.
LEADFEMALE:" I've got to get my own place.
SUPMALE:Hey, how many is a couple of mice? You know, you both can't be the horsie at the same time.
LEADMALE:Morning, Jackie.
SUPMALE:Yikes.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys aren't talking to each other, are you? Wow, your powers of observation Never cease to astound me.
SUPFEMALE:No, actually, Dan thinks that I ruined his life.
LEADFEMALE:Because of me, he did not get to pursue his great dream Of being the king of rock 'n' roll! I did not stop Dan from being a musician.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, I could've stopped him if I wanted to But I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Did I? Of course you didn't.
OTHERMALE:Did you? I mean, did Dan ever once stop and think That maybe I gave up some of my dreams too? Yes! When you were eight you wanted to be a magician.
LEADMALE:And then you wanted to be the flying nun for a while.
LEADFEMALE:Well, who didn't? Okay, i'm gonna get going.
LEADMALE:Just give me the tickets and i'll get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:what tickets? the tickets to see ray wilson play.
LEADMALE:You gave her our tickets? Hey, you guys are talking again.
SUPMALE:No, I didn't just give her the tickets.
LEADMALE:She had to promise to help me throw all your crap out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I still want to go, and i'm going.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you are going, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:So then, looks like it's just you and me, big guy.
LEADMALE:Or actually why don't you just go on your own? And you have a good time, pal.
LEADFEMALE:You probably should cut down on your salt, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:That's what killed elvis.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, guys, what are we looking for? Well, if you don't tell anybody-mice.
OTHERMALE:oh, god.
SUPMALE:Okay, well.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck to you both.
OTHERFEMALE:I found them.
LEADMALE:Really? Cool! No no, not cool.
OTHERFEMALE:Cats.
LEADMALE:Lots of cats.
LEADFEMALE:Cats eating mice.
LEADFEMALE:It's a killing field out there.
LEADMALE:My business is ruined! That serves you right, d.j. .
LEADMALE:What you were doing was wrong, and you were forced to stop.
LEADMALE:While I mourn for those little mice, Those cats may have done you a big favor.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:The lab pays $1/lb for cats.
OTHERMALE:Here, kitty kitty kitty! Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot.
OTHERMALE:We're taking a little break.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be right back.
SUPFEMALE:But remember the more you drink, the better we sing.
SUPMALE:Oh man, I love the blues.
LEADMALE:I got to hang out in blues clubs more often.
SUPFEMALE:No you shouldn't, Jackie, you would just depress people.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not kidding, my life is the blues.
SUPFEMALE:I've been chewed up, spit out, rode hard and put away wet.
OTHERMALE:If it wasn't for bad luck, i'd have no luck at all.
LEADMALE:da da da da.

OTHERMALE:Of course, that one's not over yet either.
LEADMALE:So, stingray There's something that i've always meant to clear up.
LEADFEMALE:You know when you asked me out and I told you I had a cold? I've always felt kind of bad about that.
LEADMALE:That's okay, there's no hard feelings.
LEADFEMALE:I just feel kind of bad.
LEADFEMALE:You must've really been hurting 'cause you went And wrote that whole song about it and everything.
OTHERFEMALE:What song? You know, "run around," you know.
LEADMALE:when I saw through the voice of a trusted friend who needed to humor me and tell me lies I really did have a cold.
LEADMALE:Uh, Jackie? That song's not about you.
LEADMALE:I think it is, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:tell her, ray.
LEADMALE:it's not about you, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, so-good.
LEADMALE:Never really cared for that song anyway.
