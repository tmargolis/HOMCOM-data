SUPFEMALE:You're not from these parts.
SUPMALE:Well, here in the big city, when you change in front of an open window, You're not just amusing the sheep.

OTHERMALE:I just feel that we're at that point in our friendship Where you should realize that we don't have one.
SUPMALE:I mean it.
SUPFEMALE:What did I ever do to you? Is this because David flirts with me? I think you have that backwards.
SUPFEMALE:You're the one always pulling the touchy-feely routine every time he's around.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to be nice.
LEADMALE:Well, he's not used to being treated that way, okay? All right, look.
SUPMALE:Maybe I came on a little strong the other day, but I was mad at you.
LEADMALE:Just trust me.
SUPMALE:I'm not interested in David, okay? Yeah, right.

LEADMALE:you don't understand, here, Molly.
LEADMALE:This is the most normal thing he's ever done.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, at least you tried.
SUPFEMALE:I guess now I'm back to trucking.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I guess I'm back to looking for Some low-paying crap job.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, honey.
LEADMALE:You'll find one.
LEADMALE:Damn it, Dan, I really wanted this, you know? I wanted it really, really bad! I know, rosie.
LEADMALE:It's not fair! I know, Jackie.
LEADMALE:How come our lives always have to be the ones that suck, huh? I don't know, rosie? How come we never get one little thing that we want? I don't know, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:This is all your fault, Jackie.
SUPMALE:My fault? Yeah! You're the one that dragged that damn ray of hope into this house.

SUPFEMALE:It's an awful lot of money.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to the 10,000 I gave you last week? Aw, cripes, mom, We blew that on candy and records.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, I told you it was a big mistake.

LEADMALE:Yeah, it's gonna look way different full of people, mom.
LEADMALE:It's not gonna look so empty.
LEADMALE:Yes, Jackie, I suppose it is the kind of place Your trucker friends would frequent.
SUPMALE:Would you like to see the oven, mom? I think I smell mice.
SUPFEMALE:What are we doing? This is our dream.
SUPFEMALE:We can't have a dream with mom in it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't think about it as asking for her help.
SUPMALE:Think about it as draining her nest egg.
LEADFEMALE:this water is yellow! Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god! Help me drain the water here! Listen, trust me, This is the perfect place to hit her up for money.
LEADFEMALE:And if she says no, it's the perfect place to dump the body.
SUPMALE:Well, I've decided.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to lend you the money.
LEADMALE:Big, fat waste of time.
SUPMALE:However, what I will do is Put up the $10,000 and become your fourth partner.
