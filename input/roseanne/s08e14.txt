SUPFEMALE:Hey, David, you still looking for an apartment? Remember, if you find one with a stove, You're gonna have to learn how to cook.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's not necessarily true, Mark.
SUPMALE:As I recall, your trailer has a reading lamp.
LEADFEMALE:All these apartments are much much too expensive.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna have to find a better job than busboy.
LEADMALE:this is Lanford, David.
SUPMALE:Unless the pin setter at the bowling alley dies, You've got the best job in town.
LEADFEMALE:You could get a trailer like becky's And then just hook it up to your truck And haul it wherever the crops are ready for pickin'.
LEADMALE:hey, don't start with me, Darlene.
LEADMALE:yeah.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, the trailer stays parked.
LEADMALE:That's why it's called a "trailer park.
LEADFEMALE:" now, what's wrong with Lanford? well, for one thing, Becky's neighborhood is leaking transmission fluid Into the water supply.
OTHERFEMALE:Why get a job anyway? Why don't you have miss hotshot here Set you up in a fancy apartment In some great city? Huh? Where are you going to after you graduate, Darlene? New york? Paris? London? Ooh, somebody's been reading hard rock t-shirts.
LEADFEMALE:Look, she's a little bit bummed about Darlene Getting that big job offer.
LEADMALE:I think she feels like she's in a rut.
LEADFEMALE:sorry if i'm doing okay While her life is a miserable failure.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right, i'll go downstairs And try and think of something positive to say about her life.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't hear from me till christmas, Buy yourselves something nice.

LEADFEMALE:But we got married and moved to minneapolis And now sometimes I wonder what would have happened If I had gone to college instead.

LEADMALE:I want to go to college, Mark.
LEADMALE:I want to be a-a paramedic Or a physical therapist or-Wait, wait, you want to be like a doctor? Yeah! Yeah, well Maybe, I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I don't know, the sky's the limit.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, this is crazy.
LEADFEMALE:You're talking about a lot of money here, and moving.

LEADFEMALE:Where's this coming from all of a sudden? what about the plans we had? we never had plans, Mark.
LEADMALE:You go to work, I go to work, We go to my parents on sundays.
LEADMALE:Every week is the same and will be for the rest of our lives.

OTHERFEMALE:Man, she is playing us like a fine wine! Well, she has a point, Mark.
LEADMALE:I mean, what if I was pregnant? I'd be trapped just like her.

LEADMALE:But you know that David and goliath Was just a story they made up to sell bibles.
LEADFEMALE:You have no right to tell Becky That she should do stuff to change her life.
LEADMALE:Why? She's pretty well wasted it up till now, don't you think? Maybe it hasn't been perfect, okay? But it's been pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:There's no reason for her to go to college To become a physical therapist or a doctor or Something.
LEADFEMALE:Doctor, huh? Wow, way to go, Becky.
SUPFEMALE:Now, all I have to do is to create a lawyer And a union plumber And I shall control the world! It's gonna ruin everything.

SUPMALE:I'm sure that your mcdonald's game pieces Are negotiable in other states.
SUPFEMALE:And we were gonna start having a family.
LEADMALE:Now all of a sudden she wants to wait.
LEADMALE:And she decides all this without even talking to me.
SUPFEMALE:you mean, she didn't talk to you about any of that? no no.
SUPFEMALE:She just went ahead and made all these ridiculous plans without me.
LEADFEMALE:And let me ask you this: How's she gonna go to college, go to work, And still have time for me? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:She's a real strong person, Mark.
LEADFEMALE:i'm sure if anybody can do it, she can.
LEADFEMALE:mm.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think she can do it alone? Oh, alone? Why, Mark? Are you gonna leave her over this? I would not leave your daughter for anything.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what? Are you scared that she's gonna leave you? Well, she's been cutting me out of everything else! don't worry about it, Mark.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just the usual Becky selfishness.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go over there and talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:No no no! That's the whole point! I came over here to tell you to butt out of our lives And to leave us alone! hey.
