LEADMALE:HOW COME DARLENE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING? I HOPE I DIDN'T SPOIL THE SURPRISE.
LEADFEMALE:DARLENE, WILL YOU COME DOWN HERE FOR A MINUTE? SWEETIE! WELL, SHE FINALLY DOES GOOD IN SCHOOL, AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN TELL US ABOUT IT.
SUPFEMALE:PROBABLY STILL IN SHOCK.

LEADMALE:THIS IS EXACTLY THE REASON I'M NOT GOING TO CULTURE NIGHT.
SUPMALE:WHAT, ARE YOU ASHAMED OF YOUR TALENT? NO.
LEADFEMALE:I'M ASHAMED OF MY PARENTS.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, SO IS EVERYBODY.
SUPFEMALE:IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT.
LEADMALE:MOM, I'M NOT GOING.
SUPFEMALE:YOU GOTTA SAY I'M SICK.
LEADFEMALE:BUT WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO GO? I MEAN, THIS IS YOUR SHOT, THIS IS LIKE WINNING THE BIG GAME.
SUPFEMALE:MOM, YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO.
LEADFEMALE:AND IF YOU TRY AND MAKE ME READ MY POEM IN FRONT OF THE GEEKOID MASSES, YOU'LL HAVE TO THROW A NET AROUND ME AND DRAG ME OUT OF THE HOUSE LIKE A DEAD SEAL.
LEADMALE:WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO GET THE NET.
SUPMALE:YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE JUST BEING PIGHEADED ABOUT THIS.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, I THINK YOU'RE BEING PIGHEADED ABOUT IT, ROSEANNE.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND LIKE MY DAD.
LEADMALE:"WORK SMART, DANNY, NOT HARD.
LEADFEMALE:BE A SALESMAN.
OTHERFEMALE:" I'M NOT--I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.
SUPFEMALE:I'M NOT GONNA PUSH OUR KIDS LIKE THAT.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, I DON'T WANT TO, EITHER.
LEADMALE:THEN WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT MAKING DARLENE READ THIS STUPID POEM? IT IS CALLED POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT, DAN.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, JUST ONCE, IF MY PARENTS WOULD'VE EVER TOLD ME, "HEY, ROSEANNE, YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT," I MIGHT BE STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU RIGHT NOW MOPPING A BIGGER, MORE LUXURIOUS KITCHEN.
OTHERFEMALE:IT'S WET! GO USE THE PHONE IN MY ROOM.
SUPMALE:I'M TALKING TO YOUR DAD.
LEADMALE:I DON'T NEED TO USE THE PHONE.
SUPFEMALE:OH, LET ME GET THAT ON TAPE.
SUPFEMALE:YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE DARLENE GO TO CULTURE NIGHT.
LEADMALE:OH, YEAH? AND WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE IT'S TOTALLY GEEKY.
OTHERMALE:I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.
LEADFEMALE:THERE'S PAINTINGS, THE SCHOOL BAND, READINGS, AND STUFF.
LEADFEMALE:OH, YOU MEAN, LIKE ART? YEAH.
SUPFEMALE:BUT STRICTLY THE BOW TIE SET.
LEADFEMALE:I MEAN, EVERYONE'S GONNA THINK DARLENE'S A BIG SUCK-UP IF SHE GOES.
LEADMALE:WHY, THANK YOU, MISS CONNER.
SUPMALE:NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU CAN TELL YOUR CLIENT SHE CAN GET HERSELF A NEW ATTORNEY.
SUPFEMALE:SO YOU'RE GONNA MAKE HER GO? NOBODY'S MAKING ANYBODY DO ANYTHING.
LEADFEMALE:GREAT.
SUPFEMALE:I'LL TELL HER.
OTHERFEMALE:BECKY, MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
LEADMALE:IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP AROUND HERE, JUST STAY OUT OF IT.
LEADFEMALE:FINE.
OTHERFEMALE:IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR KIDS, I GUESS THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.
OTHERMALE:SHE DIDN'T BUY IT, DARLENE.
LEADFEMALE:YOU WERE TERRIBLE.
LEADFEMALE:I'M JUST GETTING FED UP.
SUPMALE:WE OWE IT TO DARLENE TO MAKE HER DO THIS, AND SHE'S DOING IT.
LEADMALE:THAT'S FUNNY 'CAUSE I THOUGHT DARLENE HAD 2 PARENTS, AND THIS WAS A DECISION THAT BOTH OF THEM SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN.
LEADMALE:WELL, LOOK, OK, WE OBVIOUSLY DISAGREE, AND WE HAVE TO COME TO SOME KIND OF A DECISION.
SUPFEMALE:AND ONE OF US IS GONNA BE WRONG.
LEADMALE:NOW YOU JUST GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO BE WRONG THIS TIME.
LEADMALE:LOOK, NO MATTER WHAT WE DO, WE'RE GOING TO SCREW OUR KIDS UP.
SUPMALE:YOU LET ME MESS UP DARLENE, AND YOU CAN HAVE BECKY.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT ABOUT d.j. ? WE'LL FLIP FOR IT.
OTHERMALE:YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE THING IS MISS MILLER'S FAULT.
LEADFEMALE:IF I'D KNOWN ANYONE ELSE WAS GONNA SEE THIS POEM, I NEVER WOULD'VE WRITTEN IT.
LEADFEMALE:I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.
LEADFEMALE:YOU'RE NOT GONNA.
LEADMALE:NO, BUT I AM GOING TO HEAR IT BEING READ.
LEADFEMALE:LIVEAND ON STAGE.
OTHERFEMALE:PLEASE, MOM, I'M BEGGING YOU.
LEADFEMALE:I'LL CLEAN WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO CLEAN.
SUPFEMALE:I JUST REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
SUPMALE:REALLY? COME ON, MOM.
LEADMALE:I WROTE THE POEM, OK? I DID MY ASSIGNMENT.
LEADMALE:WHY CAN'T WE JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT? WHAT ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF? I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING.
OTHERMALE:WELL, YOU JUST GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON, YOU GIVE ME THE TRUTH, AND MAYBE I WON'T MAKE YOU DO IT.
LEADMALE:THE TRUTH? YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU USUALLY TELL ME.
LEADFEMALE:THE TRUTH IS MY POEM SUCKS.
LEADFEMALE:I WROTE IT IN, LIKE, 10 MINUTES.
LEADFEMALE:I JUST BLABBED IT OUT ON A PIECE OF PAPER.
SUPMALE:IT'S A JOKE.
OTHERFEMALE:MISS MILLER DOESN'T THINK SO.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, MISS MILLER'S AN IDIOT.
SUPFEMALE:THE ONLY REASON SHE PICKED MY POEM IS 'CAUSE SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD ENCOURAGE ME.
OTHERMALE:YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY SURPRISED AT YOU, DARLENE.
LEADMALE:WHAT'S EVERYBODY GONNA THINK IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP? WHO CARES WHAT EVERYBODY THINKS? WELL, IF YOU DON'T CARE WHAT EVERYBODY THINKS, THEN WHAT ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF? DAN, COME HERE QUICK! DARLENE'S SPEECHLESS! YOU GOT TO SEE THIS! YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? WHAT? I THINK I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID THAT YOUR POEM REALLY IS GOOD.
LEADFEMALE:I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID TO LET EVERYBODY SEE THAT YOU'VE GOT A BRAIN BECAUSE THEN THEY'LL EXPECT YOU TO USE IT.
LEADMALE:YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:RIGHT.
LEADMALE:I'M SO SURPRISED AT YOU.
SUPFEMALE:I MEAN, YOUR WHOLE LIFE YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND TO TAKE ALL THE CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE WRONG, AND NOW SOMETHING REALLY GREAT HAPPENS.
LEADFEMALE:DON'T YOU WANT TO ENJOY IT? DON'T YOU WANT TO GET UP THERE AND TAKE YOUR BOW? NO.
SUPMALE:WELL, FINE.
LEADMALE:YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT.
LEADMALE:I JUST THOUGHT I'D GET A LITTLE JOY OUT OF IT, YOU KNOW? A FEW GOOSEBUMPS.
LEADFEMALE:I'D BE PROUD OF YOU BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO IT JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU OWE IT TO ME.
LEADMALE:OK, I WONT.
LEADMALE:BUT YOU ARE DOING IT.
LEADFEMALE:WHY? BECAUSE I'M YOUR MOTHER, AND I SAID SO.
LEADFEMALE:OH, THAT'S FAIR.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT IF I FREAK OUT? WHAT IF I FAINT AND CRACK MY HEAD OPEN ON STAGE? WELL, THEN EVERYBODY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT YOU'VE GOT A BRAIN.
LEADFEMALE:I HOPE WE GET BACK IN TIME TO WATCH THE END OF THE GAME.
OTHERMALE:OH, I'M SURE YOUR DADDY WILL GIVE US HIS FAMOUS HIGHLIGHTS SPEECH.
OTHERFEMALE:OH, NO.
SUPMALE:OH, HI, DARLENE! HI, MARTIN.
OTHERMALE:HOW YOU DOING? WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, DARLENE, I'M NOT REALLY INTO THIS HIGH-PRESSURE, HIGH-VISIBILITY STUFF.
LEADMALE:I'M REALLY MORE OF A RECLUSE.
OTHERMALE:YOU WANT TO GET SOME PUNCH? YEAH.
OTHERFEMALE:GO AHEAD.
LEADFEMALE:HI.
SUPFEMALE:HEY, I MADE IT.
LEADFEMALE:OH, ROSEANNE, THIS PLACE STILL SCARES ME.
SUPMALE:WE BETTER TAKE OUR SEATS OR ELSE THEY'LL MAKE US STAY AFTER.
LEADFEMALE:WHERE'S DAN? HE'S BOYCOTTING ON PRINCIPLE.
LEADMALE:SO HE'S HOME WATCHING THE GAME? AMONG OTHER THINGS.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT A BUNCH OF NERDS.
LEADFEMALE:JOKE! YOU THINK I DID THE RIGHT THING, DON'T YOU? YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:SURE.
LEADFEMALE:YEAH.
OTHERMALE:I--I THINK THAT SHE'LL PROBABLY DESPISE YOU RIGHT NOW, BUT I--YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.
LEADMALE:AND BESIDES, SHE STILL LOVES HER AUNT JACKIE.
SUPMALE:AWAY AWAY WHY DO YOU STAY? FLY AWAY, BIRD.
LEADMALE:IT LOOKS AT ME.
LEADMALE:ANDSTILL IT HOPS AND HOPS AND HOPS.
LEADFEMALE:FLY AWAY.
LEADFEMALE:YOU GOT A GUN ON YOU? IT SPREADS ITS WINGS AND FLIES AWAY.
LEADFEMALE:AWAY IT DOES NOT LOOK BACK.
LEADMALE:THAT'S IT.
OTHERMALE:CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT KID'S HOME LIFE? GET A LOAD OF THAT-EMBARRASSING YOUR KID IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL.
SUPMALE:MOM DID THAT TO ME.
LEADMALE:DRILL TEAM TRYOUTS IN THE EIGHTH GRADE.
OTHERFEMALE:SHE SAT UP IN THE BLEACHERS WEEPING AND PULLING THOSE STIFF, USED KLEENEX OUT OF HER BAG.
LEADMALE:DO YOU GOT, LIKE, A MINT OR SOMETHING? MY STOMACH'S JUST KIND OF, YOU KNOW OH, ROSEANNE, YOU'RE NERVOUS.
SUPFEMALE:OH, THAT'S SO CUTE.
SUPMALE:OOH, OOH, OOH.
LEADMALE:SHUT UP.
SUPMALE:THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT FINE RENDITION.
LEADFEMALE:AND NOW, FROM MISS MILLER'S SEVENTH GRADE CLASS, DARLENE CONNER WILL READ HER POEM.
SUPMALE:TO WHOM IT CONCERNS.
OTHERMALE:BY DARLENE CONNER.
SUPMALE:TO WHOM IT CONCERNS-DARLENE'S WORK WILL BE LATE.
LEADMALE:IT FELL ON HER PANCAKES AND STUCK TO HER PLATE.
LEADMALE:TO WHOM IT CONCERNS-MY MOM MADE ME WRITE THIS.
SUPFEMALE:AND I'M JUST A KID, SO HOW COULD I FIGHT THIS? TO WHOM IT CONCERNS-I LOST MY ASSIGNMENT.
LEADFEMALE:MAYBE I'LL GET LUCKY.
LEADMALE:SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.
LEADMALE:TO WHOM IT CONCERNS-DARLENE'S GREAT WITH A BALL, BUT GUYS DON'T WATCH TOMBOYS WHEN THEY'RE CRUISING THE HALL.
SUPMALE:TO WHOM IT CONCERNS-I JUST TURNED 13.
SUPFEMALE:TOO SHORT TO BE QUARTERBACK, TOO PLAIN TO BE QUEEN.
SUPMALE:TO WHOM IT CONCERNS I AM NOT MADE OF STEEL.
LEADFEMALE:WHEN I GET BLIND-SIDED, MY PAIN IS QUITE REAL.
LEADFEMALE:I DON'T MEAN TO SQUAWK, BUT IT REALLY BURNS.
LEADFEMALE:I JUST THOUGHT I'D MENTION IT TO WHOM IT CONCERNS.
