LEADFEMALE:Last week on Roseanne Las Vegas.
SUPMALE:We leave sunday, come back tuesday.
LEADFEMALE:Take off and leave the kids? I want to see Wayne Newton! We had a date.
LEADFEMALE:Now? Yeah, now.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie, I'm hot.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
SUPFEMALE:We haven't had five minutes alone since we got here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now we're alone.
SUPFEMALE:I, for one, am having a great time.
LEADMALE:You know, Dan, We should have took separate vacations.
LEADMALE:I go to Vegas.
OTHERFEMALE:You go to hell.
LEADMALE:Dan's beard hairs are all over the sink, and his underwear's hanging on the doorknob.
LEADFEMALE:He's griping about a couple of lipsticks taking up all his bathroom space, you know, like he owns the place.
LEADMALE:"This is my sink.
SUPFEMALE:This is my doorknob.
LEADFEMALE:" That's why men all the time miss the john, 'Cause they're marking their territory.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADMALE:Well, men are pigs.
OTHERMALE:That's not news.
SUPFEMALE:Double zero.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, double zero.
LEADMALE:That just about sums up my whole vacation.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, You're ruining your whole trip.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you just go to Dan and say "I'm sorry?" Let me tell you something, Nancy.
OTHERMALE:You do not stay married for 18 years By blurting out stupid little things like "I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:" I'm on a roll that's unbelievable, And she wants romance and it can't wait.
SUPMALE:She's yelling about underwear on doorknobs.
SUPMALE:She didn't want them on the floor or on me.
SUPMALE:Where do I put them? Another card? Sure.
SUPMALE:Hit me.
LEADMALE:Why should you be any different? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:She yammered the luck right out of me.
SUPFEMALE:Better luck next time.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:No way I'm getting married again.
LEADMALE:Great news, Dan.
LEADMALE:You got the Wayne Newton tickets! Good news, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't? Rosie's been waiting It's the main reason we came.
LEADMALE:It's not my fault.
LEADMALE:Wayne doesn't work on mondays.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't go yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:You said we'd get better tickets tonight.
LEADMALE:I can get us front row tickets tonight, But it won't be much fun without Wayne.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADMALE:, so we don't see Wayne.
OTHERMALE:Somehow she'll make this my fault, But I already left nose hairs in her sink.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't hang a man twice.
LEADMALE:I said I had good news.
LEADMALE:Four tickets to the Las Vegas legends in concert.
SUPFEMALE:The finest showbiz impersonators in the world.
LEADMALE:That's not so bad.
LEADFEMALE:If we saw Wayne it would be over in a couple of hours.
SUPMALE:This I'll hear about the rest of my life.
LEADFEMALE:One thing.
LEADMALE:What? These tickets are free only for looking at time-share vacation condos.
LEADMALE:Let's go! Hit me--no, no.
LEADMALE:Kill me! See marriage is like gambling, you know.
LEADFEMALE:The odds are all in favor of the house.
LEADFEMALE:So, when your marriage breaks up make sure you keep the house.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, I think you'd better eat something.
LEADMALE:And, you know, marriage is like this here slot machine.
SUPMALE:You don't always get back what you put into it, see.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:"Honey I made your favorite dinner.
SUPMALE:" Nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:"Honey I let your favorite pants out another inch.
LEADFEMALE:" Ha ha ha! Nothing.
OTHERMALE:"Honey, I bore you three children, And I got that soap you like.
SUPFEMALE:" Zip.
LEADFEMALE:This proves my point.
LEADMALE:Marriage stinks.
SUPFEMALE:With a capital "suck.
LEADMALE:" Come on, Roseanne.
OTHERMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:Nancy, the longer I know you, the more I got to ask you-Why are you marrying that guy? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I mean, he's not everything I deserve.
LEADFEMALE:So I think, uh, Do you want to marry the guy? Then he did something the other day that really clinched it.
LEADFEMALE:He told me about that affair he had.
OTHERMALE:He did? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:And it's not like I caught him or anything.
LEADFEMALE:He just thought If we're going to be married, There shouldn't be any secrets.
SUPFEMALE:And that's when I knew I could really trust him.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe he told you.
SUPMALE:I was amazed.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy, you are really an incredible person.
LEADFEMALE:You've forgiven him and, man, I haven't even forgiven Jackie yet.
SUPFEMALE:What has Jackie got to do with it? You know, marriage is like-It--it was Jackie? What was Jackie? He told me some bimbo divorcee threw herself at him And he'd never see her again.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to kill him.
OTHERFEMALE:Men! If Dan hadn't made me come to Vegas none of this would have happened.
LEADFEMALE:So, Danny, how's that complimentary drink treating you? You can't beat a big glass of tang with an umbrella.
LEADMALE:Man, I hope the girls don't get lost.
LEADMALE:Why? Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:It's going to be great.
SUPFEMALE:I was in the john, and I saw the guy that does Paul Anka.
SUPMALE:If you close your eyes, you'd swear it was him.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, wow! Legends in concert, huh, Dan? Thank you so much for making this the perfect vacation.
LEADFEMALE:Right back at you, babe.
OTHERMALE:You're dead.
LEADMALE:She knows about Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:It was Jackie Harris.
SUPMALE:I know I'm a lying dog, but marry me.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you tell me before? Why drag Jackie into this? She's a nice person.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want you hating her because I made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie slept with Arnie? Yuck! You're a pig.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You're scum.
