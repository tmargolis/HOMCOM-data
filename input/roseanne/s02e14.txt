LEADFEMALE:WHAT'S GOIN' ON? WELL, I GUESS WE MISSED SOME BIG PARTY RIGHT HERE IN OUR LIVING ROOM YESTERDAY.
SUPMALE:WHAT THE HELL WENT ON HERE? DID YOU GET IN THE LIQUOR WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING THE RECORDS? I WAS PLAYING THE RECORDS.
LEADMALE:WAIT A MINUTE.
SUPMALE:DARLENE, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE PLAYING THE RECORDS.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, YEAH.
OTHERMALE:I MEAN I GOT 'EM OUT, BUT BECKY WAS ACTUALLY PLAYING THEM.
SUPMALE:WHO WAS THE BARTENDER? WASN'T IT THAT GIRL WHO WAS OVER HERE STUDYING WITH YOU? WELL, LOOK, I'M SORRY I WASN'T HERE TO KEEP AN EYE ON WHATEVER THE HELL WENT ON HERE YESTERDAY.
OTHERFEMALE:I'M SORRY, TOO.
LEADFEMALE:I'VE GOT A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL AT HOME WITH A HANGOVER.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO HOME AND TAKE CARE OF HER.
OTHERMALE:MAYBE YOU GUYS SHOULD SHELL OUT A FEW BUCKS AND GET A LOCK ON THAT LIQUOR CABINET.
LEADMALE:THANKS, BUT I THINK WE KNOW HOW TO RUN OUR OWN HOUSEHOLD.
LEADMALE:YEAH, WELL, DON'T EXPECT TO BE SEEING MY KID AROUND HERE ANYMORE.
SUPMALE:BECKY, GET UPSTAIRS TILL WE CALL YOU BACK DOWN.
LEADFEMALE:NO, I WANNA TALK.
LEADFEMALE:YOU SIT THERE.
LEADFEMALE:BECKY, GET UPSTAIRS.
LEADMALE:I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS FIRST.
LEADMALE:THERE'S NOTHING I'M GONNA SAY TO YOU THAT I CAN'T SAY TO HER, AND I'M NOT FEELIN' REAL SHY RIGHT NOW.
LEADFEMALE:BECKY, GET BACK IN HERE AND SIT DOWN.
SUPFEMALE:WHAT THE HELL IS WITH YOU, BECKY? WHAT, DO YOU LOOK PEOPLE IN THE FACE AND THEN LIE TO 'EM? YOU'VE REALLY PUSHED IT TOO FAR THIS TIME, KIDDO.
LEADMALE:THE FIRST TIME WE LEAVE YOU ALONE IN THIS HOUSE AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO? I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS AND FLUSH THE WOK.
SUPFEMALE:ALL RIGHT, BECKY.
LEADMALE:WHAT HAPPENED HERE? AND TRY TELLING THE TRUTH THIS TIME.
LEADMALE:LOOK, IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.
LEADFEMALE:WE HAD A COUPLE OF TORNADOES.
LEADMALE:OH, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
SUPFEMALE:HOW COME YOU LIED? WHO MADE THEM? I MADE THEM.
LEADFEMALE:I WANNA KNOW RIGHT NOW, IS THIS A NEW THING OR A REGULAR THING? I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.
OTHERFEMALE:IS THAT THE TRUTH? YES! WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?! YOU GUYS DRINK ALL THE TIME! FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'T DRINK ALL THE TIME.
LEADMALE:SECOND OF ALL, WE'RE NOT TALKIN' ABOUT US! LOOK, I HAVE ONE DRINK AND YOU'RE ACTING LIKE I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.
SUPMALE:OH, QUICK, CALL THE 800 NUMBER.
OTHERMALE:WE ARE YOUR AND IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM, YOU BETTER TELL US ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
SUPMALE:WE WERE BORED.
LEADMALE:WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO DO.
SUPFEMALE:YOU WANT SOMETHING TO DO? FIND ME! I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DO! I GUESS I JUST WASN'T THINKING.
OTHERMALE:FOR GOD'S SAKE, BECKY, YOU'RE 14 YEARS OLD! MOM, EVERYTHING I DO, EVERYTHING I FEEL, IT'S ALWAYS, "WELL, SHE'S 14.
SUPMALE:" I MEAN, WHEN YOU GUYS DO SOMETHING, PEOPLE DON'T GO, "OH, WELL, SHE'S 37.
LEADFEMALE:" WHATEVER.
SUPFEMALE:YOU KNOW, BECKY, YOU'RE GONNA FIND THAT WHEN GROWNUPS DRINK, THEY MOSTLY DRINK FOR THE WRONG REASONS.
OTHERMALE:SO WHAT ARE THE RIGHT REASONS? HONEY? YOU'RE GROUNDED.
SUPMALE:SIP THAT TEA AND TRY TO EAT SOME OF THIS TOAST, AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.
LEADFEMALE:SO, BECKY, YOU STILL BOMBED? NO.
OTHERFEMALE:SHE'S NOT BOMBED.
LEADMALE:SHE JUST WISHES SHE WAS DEAD.
SUPFEMALE:COULD EVERYONE BE JUST A LITTLE BIT QUIETER? YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HORRIBLE I FEEL.
LEADMALE:OH, YES, I DO.
LEADMALE:YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SO MUCH BOTHERED BY THE FACT THAT YOU TOOK A DRINK.
SUPFEMALE:I MEAN, YOU TRIED IT.
LEADFEMALE:YOU GOT SICK, YOU GOT CAUGHT.
LEADMALE:YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.
SUPMALE:WHAT REALLY BUGS THE HELL OUT OF ME IS THAT I JUST CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE, AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT I COULD.
OTHERMALE:YOU BLEW IT BIG-TIME.
SUPFEMALE:SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THAT I HAVE TO BE CHAPERONED THE REST OF MY LIFE? WELL, YOU TELL ME.
LEADFEMALE:CAN I NOT LEAVE YOU ALONE IN THE HOUSE ANYMORE? WELL, I COULD WATCH HER.
LEADMALE:SO, DO I HAVE TO THROW OUT EVERY BIT OF LIQUOR 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T GET THAT KIDS DO NOT DO WHAT ADULTS DO? NO.
LEADMALE:OF COURSE NOT.
LEADFEMALE:I'M SORRY, MOM.
LEADMALE:YEAH, I'M SORRY, TOO.
LEADFEMALE:I'M SORRY THAT I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE.
OTHERMALE:YES, YOU CAN.
SUPFEMALE:YEAH.
LEADMALE:WELL, WE'LL FIND OUT, I GUESS, 'CAUSE I'M GONNA BE WATCHIN' YOU LIKE A HAWK.
LEADMALE:AND MAYBE SOMEDAY, A LONG, LONG TIME FROM NOW, THINGS WILL BE THE WAY THEY WERE BEFORE 'CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE.
SUPMALE:YOUR FATHER, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS DECIDED TO PUT A LOCK ON THE LIQUOR CABINET, A FINE TRADITION HANDED DOWN IN HIS FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS.
