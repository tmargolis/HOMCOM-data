LEADFEMALE:it's like a blast from the past, man.
OTHERFEMALE:mother, tell your husband these are the '80S.
SUPFEMALE:well, becky, i guess you're old enough to know the grim truth.

OTHERFEMALE:pregame jitters.
LEADMALE:i used to get 'em myself.
LEADFEMALE:all your great ones do.

SUPMALE:hey, wait'll you start dating, and dad asks the guy you're going out with if he has popcorn money.
SUPMALE:i'm not dating, ever.
OTHERFEMALE:it doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:they'll always find a way to embarrass you, believe me.
OTHERFEMALE:it's not fair.
LEADMALE:i mean, parents are supposed to stay in the house.
LEADMALE:except when they're driving you somewhere, and then they're just supposed to drop you off and go away.
LEADMALE:in a perfect world, darlene, in a perfect world.
SUPMALE:i mean, look what dad wanted me to take to dianne's.

LEADFEMALE:i don't want mom to come to my game.
SUPFEMALE:d.j. : i'm gonna go watch tv.
OTHERFEMALE:darlene, what did i tell you i was gonna do if i found these on the couch again? look, just give me the shoes and hold the lecture.
OTHERMALE:darlene! listen, miss smart mouth.
LEADFEMALE:you're not even gonna be needing those shoes, 'cause you're not gonna play baseball again till you're 58! fine with me, i don't wanna play anyway if you're gonna be there.

LEADFEMALE:becky, those aren't just cowgirls.
OTHERMALE:that is the cowgirl.
LEADFEMALE:that's annie oakley.
LEADMALE:there is no way i'm taking that to my slumber party.

LEADMALE:well, they're under the sink.
LEADFEMALE:you'd better take two.
OTHERMALE:oh, mother.
LEADFEMALE:jeez.
LEADFEMALE:oh, if this bag could talk.
LEADFEMALE:i'd cut its tongue out, i would.
