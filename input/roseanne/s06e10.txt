LEADFEMALE:Our whole lives we've done everything Just to disappoint you.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you think I live like this? Fine, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:If I have to lie in order to give advice to my daughter, Then so be it.

SUPFEMALE:It was her! It was all her! She made me do it! That's so ridiculous! Roseanne! I didn't say anything like that.
LEADMALE:It's totally untrue.

LEADFEMALE:All right, I guess you have a right To ask me a few questions.
LEADMALE:If you hadn't got pregnant with me Would you still have married dad? Well, no.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think that's why he was mad all the time? You know, you think that's why he treated Me and Jackie like he did? Oh, Roseanne, you know your father loved you.
