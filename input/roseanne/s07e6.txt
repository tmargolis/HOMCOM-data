SUPMALE:Our mother went gray very suddenly.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That was the day she found my underwear In the glove compartment.
SUPFEMALE:No, what I meant is hair is hereditary on the mother's side, So whatever happened to your mom Is probably going to happen to you.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to find a buffalo head nickel And talk about it for 25 years.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, look at these.
LEADFEMALE:I guess there's Worse things than going gray.
LEADFEMALE:That looks just like mom's hair.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, that is exactly like mom's hair.
LEADFEMALE:Same exact color.
LEADMALE:Same exact style.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, that is mom's hair! Our mom wears a wig.
LEADFEMALE:You think she's bald? No way.
SUPMALE:If she's bald, that means that we could go bald.
SUPFEMALE:This is her hair.
LEADMALE:Look--look at this.
OTHERMALE:oh, Roseanne! A woman of your size shouldn't wear horizontal stripes.
LEADFEMALE:You should wear black or stay home.
LEADFEMALE:And another thing, dear.

LEADFEMALE:d.j. , sit down.
LEADFEMALE:What Mark meant to tell you Is that leon's party is gonna be different 'cause theres gonna be a lot of gay people there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:What does gay mean? uh Well, that's a fine question, d.j. Um, see, Sometimes boys have boyfriends, And, uh, Sometimes girls have girlfriends, And these people are called gay.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I have boys who are friends.
SUPFEMALE:What's the difference? All right.
LEADFEMALE:Um See, uh, Boys who have boyfriends Do things with-with their friends That a boy who has a friend Who just happens to be a boy Would probably never do.

LEADMALE:Yeah, me, neither.
LEADFEMALE:See When two men love each other, They, uh, like everybody else, They like to share each other's feelings For one another Through Beautiful expressions of, uh Physical love.

OTHERFEMALE:Fred likes to try new things.
LEADFEMALE:With his hair.
LEADMALE:Only with his hair.
