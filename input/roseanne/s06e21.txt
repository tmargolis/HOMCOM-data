LEADFEMALE:Hey, d.j. , haven't seen you since I got home.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
SUPMALE:Oh, nice to see you too.
SUPFEMALE:School's going really well.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, the bus ride home was nice, but, uh, Unfortunately, I was sitting next to this guy who kept singing la la la la la la la la la I'm gonna kill you, Darlene! Not if I kill you first.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you kids, if I had a corpse for every time One of you said that She won't shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut! Up! How ironic; grandma's strapped to a bed in a loony bin, And yet d.j. walks free.
LEADMALE:What are you talkin' about? Well, thank you for your sensitivity, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna tell you about grandma Connor, you know.
LEADMALE:Last night your dad had to put her into a home.
OTHERMALE:What kind of home? A home Not unlike our own.
LEADMALE:She's in a mental institution.
SUPMALE:Is it because grandma's crazy? No, it's because she's Tired.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, tired of being sane.
SUPMALE:Well, "crazy" is a mean word to use, d.j. Your grandmother is just emotionally, um-Well, she's had some emotional, uh-She's a tad nutty.
LEADMALE:How long has she been like this? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Only in our family can someone be a nut case for 20 years Without anyone noticing.
SUPMALE:We notice, Darlene; we're just ignoring you.
LEADFEMALE:Did grandma do crazy things? Well, there was that one tip-off.
SUPFEMALE:Remember when she was in Florida, She sent us that postcard that said, "having a great time.
SUPMALE:Wish I was here.
SUPMALE:" I don't think you should be making fun of grandma.
LEADFEMALE:We're not making fun, d.j. This is just our way of coping, you know? Instead of crying and saying my grandmother's In a mental institution, we say, uh, well, At least grandma is with other people Who share her interests in hand-washing.
LEADFEMALE:Mornin'.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
OTHERMALE:Oh, i'm sorry, Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, I need to talk about this.
LEADMALE:Why? It didn't happen to your mom.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know; if it would've happened to my mom, At least it would make sense.
LEADFEMALE:Talk.
OTHERMALE:Well, I just have some questions is all.
LEADFEMALE:Um, you know, when your parents got divorced, when was that? Uh, let's see I was wearing a size 8, so that's about Right.
LEADFEMALE:And remember when your mom got hospitalized For exhaustion then? Um, was that a mental hospital? Yes, it was a mental hospital.
OTHERFEMALE:Her husband of 32 years had just walked out on her, So she got a little depressed.
LEADFEMALE:Go figure.
LEADFEMALE:Were there other times? Once.
SUPMALE:Really? My dad used to go away on business trips When I was a kid and one time, He took off without even telling my mom.
SUPMALE:Two weeks, no phone calls, no nothin'.
LEADMALE:She didn't know where he was.
SUPFEMALE:He really did that? Yeah, he really did that.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:And it wrecked her so bad that she had to go away For a little while.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, I just had no idea.
SUPMALE:Well, I told you that my dad Treated my mom like crap.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah, I know that, but, I mean, I didn't know he was that bad And I didn't know that it affected her so much.
SUPMALE:Well, of course it affected her; he was horrible to her.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing that she held up as well as she did.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so So it must've been really hard on you, huh, Dan? No, it wasn't hard on me.
LEADMALE:It's was hard on her.
LEADMALE:She made it okay for me.
OTHERFEMALE:She was a great mother.
LEADFEMALE:She didn't teach her kids to make jokes about things That aren't funny.
LEADMALE:Hey, the kids are just tryin' to handle this, okay? We all feel really bad about what happened to your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Well, you could never tell.
LEADMALE:Of course, you could never tell Anybody gives a damn about anything around here.
SUPFEMALE:All we do is yell at each other and make jokes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Dan, i'm really upset that you've forgotten The occasional fist fight.
SUPMALE:That's perfect, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just tryin' every way I know how.
SUPMALE:Try somethin' else.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, mom, you know, he probably just doesn't Feel comfortable talkin' to you Because your mother never went insane.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, i'll talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:Alright, sweetie, you go to bed now.
LEADMALE:I hope you're planning to sing him a proper lullaby And not that rock 'n roll you sang last time.
LEADFEMALE:It was puff the magic dragon.
LEADMALE:Square old bat.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not so square that I don't know That song's about reefer.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see what Roseanne thinks.
SUPFEMALE:You think it's a good idea to encourage infants To do drugs? Jackie, what is the matter with you? I told you you have to wait till he's at least three Before you go and buy him one of those Fisher-price bongs.
LEADMALE:Make your little jokes now, but you'll wish You listened to me when that boy is 16 And he's wearing an earring and dungarees.
LEADFEMALE:So is Dan doing any better? No, he isn't and it just sucks.
LEADMALE:I mean, you know, he's sleeping right next to me, But there's just nothing I can do about it.
OTHERFEMALE:And he's gettin' really nasty too.
LEADMALE:I mean, you know, he called me a bad mother.
LEADMALE:I think.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't really hear him 'cause d.j. Was running by with scissors.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not a bad mother, Roseanne.
OTHERMALE:A bad mother thinks one blanket is enough In the dead of winter.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you keep them, Jackie? In the basement With the asbestos.
SUPMALE:Grandma to the rescue again.
OTHERMALE:Breathe deep, old woman.
LEADFEMALE:It's just so weird, you know, all that stuff he told me.
SUPMALE:I don't know, it's like his family's Way more screwed up than he ever let on before.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe he was ashamed.
LEADMALE:Ashamed? He's been married to me for 21 years.
LEADFEMALE:You'd think he'd be numb to shame by now.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:It is kinda bad.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, think about it.
SUPMALE:His mom beat our mom to the loony bin.
LEADMALE:And I can't even get him to talk about audrey, you know? He's so defensive.
SUPFEMALE:It's like he has to believe she was, like, The world's greatest mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Egad, imagine a child loving his mother.
LEADMALE:I hope you didn't snap him out of it, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:This is not about Dan loving his mother, okay? You can still love your mother even though you know That she is a crazy old shrew.
SUPMALE:Don't think that I can't read Between those lines, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:You know, dan's mother was lucky she had sons.
SUPMALE:Sons always treat their mothers with respect.
SUPMALE:Ugh, look at the stains! I assumed because it was folded it was clean.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're right, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Dan's mother was lucky and we don't treat you With enough respect.
OTHERFEMALE:Shoulda had sons.
LEADMALE:Hey, Darlene? I was reading how if your grandmother's insane, There's a one-out-of-three chance That you will be too, so There's a test here to look for the early warning signs.
