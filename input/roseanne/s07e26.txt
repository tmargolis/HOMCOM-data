LEADFEMALE:Hey, Dan, they were all out of broccoli so I got Frosted Flakes instead.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPFEMALE:What? Show her.
OTHERMALE:Show me what? David.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh, I got this thing at school today.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man, I hate things from school.
LEADMALE:The last thing was a note from the principal that said d.j. was selling my bras.
LEADFEMALE:You're graduating? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God! Oh, my God, yay! Ow, you're hurting me.
SUPMALE:You're hurting me.
LEADMALE:We totally had you going.
LEADMALE:Somebody from this house graduating from high school! Man, I just never could have seen that coming.
OTHERMALE:Somebody from this house graduating high school.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody from this house graduating high school! Did you hear that world? Somebody from this house is graduating high school! Quiet.
SUPMALE:You'll attract gold-diggers.
SUPMALE:Oh, Darlene, we are gonna have the biggest blowout ever.
LEADMALE:We never got to do this with you or Becky.
LEADMALE:You know, this is our last time to celebrate a high school graduation.
OTHERMALE:No, you still have d.j. Like I said, big blowout! We're really proud of you, son.
LEADMALE:You can relax and take comfort in knowing you've done a fine, fine job.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what are you gonna do for the rest of your life? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:But I think I have this next month figured out though.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna do something with the money my mom sent me.
LEADMALE:Well, that's nice, David.
LEADFEMALE:I will think very fondly of your mother while I'm watching that big screen TV.
LEADMALE:No, see, I'm thinking of going to Europe.
LEADFEMALE:What? Long way to go to bring back a TV.
SUPFEMALE:Man, I figured the only way any of you kids would ever get to go overseas is if you lucked out and they were having another war.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just looking forward to finally seeing in person all of the art I've been studying in books.
LEADFEMALE:They got art in Europe? You can just send me a postcard.
SUPMALE:DarleneHey, David.
SUPMALE:When you're over there, bring me back something real classy, you know, like one of them naked statues for out on the lawn.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, are you mad or something? No, Pierre.
LEADMALE:I'm delighted that you're gonna be in Europe all summer while I'm stuck here in Lanford in Chateau de Lard Ass.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a month, Darlene.
SUPMALE:I know, David, but we just got back together.
SUPMALE:I mean, what if some other boy moves into the basement? I just think this is something I gotta do.
OTHERMALE:Well, here's something else you gotta do.
OTHERMALE:Learn the French translation of "No, this is my full height.
LEADFEMALE:" Hey, David.
SUPMALE:I thought your graduation ceremony was great.
SUPMALE:I really loved that part where everyone threw them square hats with the tassels up in the air.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I just wish Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner would've asked me first.
SUPMALE:I kind of wanted to do it.
LEADMALE:Got to move quick around us.
SUPMALE:You should know that.
LEADMALE:You've eaten here.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Just thinking about Europe.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? I often come out here and think about living over there.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I'm gonna go.
LEADFEMALE:What? You were looking forward to it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's just kind of stupid, you know? The young artist going to Paris to be inspired by famous paintings.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Some of the greatest paintings of all time have come from there.
LEADMALE:Like that woman sitting in the chair, or them kids crying with the big eyes.
LEADMALE:Well, I know.
LEADMALE:It's just, I'm young, you know, and the art over there is so old.
SUPMALE:David, what's this really all about? Are you nervous about leaving home? 'Cause, you know, technically this isn't your home.
LEADMALE:Well, it's just, you know, Darlene and I are finally back together again, andOh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I'm starting to think that maybe spending a month apart would be a mistake.
LEADMALE:Well, being together is important, but a man needs time for his own thoughts.
SUPMALE:That's why I put a lock on the bathroom door.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but I'm thinking maybe I could just wait 'til we could both go together.
LEADMALE:Really hate to see you pass this up, David.
LEADFEMALE:You've got the time, you've got the money.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen this before.
LEADMALE:If you don't do this now, maybe you'll never do it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll think about it.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:Hey, have you ever traveled anywhere exotic? Can't say as I have, David.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, wait.
LEADMALE:One year on the way to Florida, me and Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner stopped off at Gator Village, watched a chicken dance on a hot plate.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dan, is the stuff in the dishwasher clean or dirty? Dirty.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:No way! You're not working on that big heap of junk boat again, are you? What, are you gonna drag it out and work on it every six years? If I do it in my spare time and my own garage, who's it gonna hurt? You, and a lot.
LEADMALE:You get rid of it.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I just can't do that for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's amazing what you can do once I set my mind to it.
LEADMALE:Well, well, well.
SUPMALE:What have we here? A new saw, a pile of new wood, and some expensive, new, loud plug-in type of thing.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess the new baby doesn't really need all those stupid shots anyway.
LEADFEMALE:All that cost me, like, 150 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and what's it gonna cost by the time it's finished? And you'd better figure that in bananas, because by that time apes will be running the world.
LEADMALE:Including lumber, paint, tools, everything else I need to build a whole boat spread out over a couple of years, maybe a thousand bucks.
LEADFEMALE:What? You got a kid in college, another one on the way and absolutely no savings.
SUPFEMALE:I could really think of a better way to spend a thousand bucks, like you give me a thousand bucks.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop worrying.
SUPFEMALE:Start dreaming a bit.
LEADFEMALE:Now, now when all the kids are gone or "lost," we'll tow this baby down to Florida, set sail for the Caribbean, figure we'll stock her up with supplies for a couple of months, maybe get some of that imported beer.
LEADMALE:Your snifter of suds, my love.
OTHERMALE:Hey, uh.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are we, anyway? Well, there's the north star, there's the Big Dipper, and there's the dock.
LEADMALE:So, I would calculate we're about in the ocean.
OTHERFEMALE:Happy my pet? Oh, beyond happy.
OTHERMALE:Whacked out.
LEADFEMALE:How this night possibly be any better? Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dan, you thought of everything.
SUPFEMALE:It's the pizza boat.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that is the stupidest, most ridiculous fantasy I've ever heard.
SUPMALE:Except for the pizza boat part.
LEADFEMALE:If you ever really finish this boat, and it ever actually floats, I'll tell you just what's going to happen.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get lost, in say, the first three hours.
LEADFEMALE:Then we'll run into a rock, and we'll end up shipwrecked on some deserted island in the middle of nowhere.
SUPFEMALE:Wow! An uncharted desert island.
OTHERFEMALE:This wasn't on any of my maps.
LEADFEMALE:Skipper! Over here, little buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Abandon ship.
SUPMALE:Pull yourself together, Gilligan.
LEADFEMALE:We've got other passengers to think about.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Howell, are you okay? Well, of course, Captain.
LEADFEMALE:We Howells are made from a hearty stock.
LEADFEMALE:My darling, are you all right? Yes, Thurston, I'm fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Not you love, I was talking to the money.
OTHERMALE:Oh, boy, will you be a dear and help us with our luggage? Yes, rich lady.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Professor, do you have any idea where we are? I mean, I'm only asking 'cause you're so smart, and I'm just a dumb girl from the country with an amazing rack.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:One thing's for sure.
LEADFEMALE:Fixing that hole in that boat of ours is way beyond our technology.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, I'm gonna go find some leaves and twigsBuild us a dentist's office.
OTHERMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:I'm David.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, David.
LEADFEMALE:What am I doing here? I don't even like this show.
LEADMALE:I wanted to be on Friends.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the important thing is that everybody is okay.
SUPMALE:Hey, where's that movie star? I hope she's all right.
LEADFEMALE:She's so delicate.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, nice driving, Ahab.
LEADMALE:That was sure one fun Carnival Cruise, huh? Soon as we get rescued, I'm gonna strangle that bitch Kathie Lee.
OTHERMALE:And in other news, the year-long search for those castaways stranded in the South Pacific has been discontinued by the Coast Guard due to budget cuts and lack of interest.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:Believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Lost and forgotten.
LEADFEMALE:I should have known better than to sign with William Morris.
LEADMALE:I got problems of my own, Ginger.
LEADMALE:Last night, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Howell asked me for a romantic moonlight stroll on the beach.
SUPFEMALE:Hi-ho, Commodore.
LEADFEMALE:How are you and your little buddy? You better be talking about Gilligan.
SUPMALE:Come along, Thurston.
LEADFEMALE:We don't want to be late to the crab races.
LEADFEMALE:It's the sport of kings, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy! Hurry up with those crabs.
LEADMALE:Coming, Mr.
LEADMALE:Howell.
SUPMALE:Aah! Here comes another Emmy.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy, Mary Ann.
OTHERFEMALE:I love coconut pie.
LEADMALE:Coconut, again? All we ever eat around here is coconut.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't there some steak tree on this damn island? All right, here's a question.
LEADFEMALE:How come I'm Mary Ann, anyway? I've never been to Kansas.
OTHERMALE:I've never been on a farm.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'm tired of everybody thinking you're prettier than me.
LEADFEMALE:Deal with it, Dorothy.
LEADMALE:Or else I'll use those pigtails to steer while I ride your hillbilly ass all over this island.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's the basement? I can't find the basement.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:We'll finally be able to leave the island.
LEADFEMALE:I pieced together the windshield from the Minnow, and we can use that as a reflector to signal planes.
LEADFEMALE:Skipper.
LEADMALE:Skipper.
OTHERMALE:No! Gilligan! You better have a good reason for all of this.
SUPFEMALE:I do.
LEADMALE:I do.
LEADFEMALE:It's justSlow down, take a deep breath.
SUPMALE:Let it out.
LEADMALE:Now, what's going on, Gilligan? We're all gonna die, Skipper.
SUPFEMALE:They say a typhoon's coming.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? The filling in my mouth picked up a radio signal from a Coast Guard cutter.
SUPMALE:Listen.
LEADMALE:Hey, I once did a love scene with Abe Vigoda, but I'm not going near your mouth.
SUPMALE:Any minute now, a small uncharted island in the Pacific will be hit by a typhoon.
SUPFEMALE:Did someone say tycoon? Yeah, that is exactly what they said.
SUPMALE:Any minute now the island will be hit by a gigantic rich man.
LEADMALE:No, no! Typhoon.
LEADFEMALE:But what are the odds that it'll hit this island? The odds are good.
OTHERMALE:D'oh! I wouldn't really worry about that storm, Skipper.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Why not? 'Cause that volcano is gonna finish us off first.
LEADMALE:Hello, Club Med! I want my deposit back! If that volcano is erupting, then it's only a matter of minutes beforeWhoa! Whoa! Earthquake! Earthquake! Calm down, little buddy.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess the good news is that things couldn't get any worse.
OTHERMALE:So, it couldn't get any worse, eh, Gilligan? Oh, it could get way worse.
LEADMALE:I just heard on the radio that Fox is doing my life story.
LEADMALE:What's so bad about that? Four words: "Denny Dillon is Ginger.
SUPFEMALE:" Dear diary, Europe isn't all it's cracked up to be.
SUPMALE:Hey, tall dark and flesh-eating.
LEADMALE:You're about the sexiest little cannibal I've ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:I can do wonders for your career.
LEADMALE:Trust me.
LEADMALE:I've done it before, and with people less civilized than you.
SUPMALE:Oogah booga booga! Ah, everybody is a critic.
OTHERFEMALE:Ginger, I think the only theater he's interested in is dinner theater.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! You are so grounded.
SUPMALE:I cannot believe I'm going to die like this.
LEADMALE:I hope I give your whole village the trots.
LEADMALE:Hold it.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, that story is absolutely ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:There's no way that would happen in a million years.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? That's the same thing you said about fat-free Fig Newtons.
LEADMALE:The point is, we can sail around the world together, just the two of us.
LEADFEMALE:No, face it, Dan.
LEADMALE:We're marooned in this house, and nobody is ever gonna rescue us.
SUPMALE:That goes for me, you, d.j. , the new baby, and the rest.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just smash it up, leave it on the curb for the garbage man to take it away.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Don't smash it up.
LEADMALE:Just leave it out there and hope for pirates.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, I got apple stuck in my teeth, and we don't have any floss, and I don't feel like using the family toothbrush.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here.
LEADMALE:Use what I use when I got something stuck in my tooth.
LEADMALE:What is it? Caramel.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll have a coffee with cream and the check, please.
SUPFEMALE:I'm on my way to my job.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a management trainee at the World of Pizza.
LEADFEMALE:What? You're going to work at World of Pizza instead of going to Europe? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Does your love of cheese know no bounds? You know, I thought about it, and I weighed the pros and cons, and I decided not to go.
SUPMALE:Darlene Well, it was a stupid idea.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you ruining this for him? Oh, come on, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, everybody knows he'd have a terrible time.
LEADMALE:It is a well-known fact that people from France hate people from Lanford.
SUPFEMALE:And he was planning on backpacking.
LEADMALE:I mean, he doesn't even own a backpack.
LEADFEMALE:That's bull, Darlene.
SUPMALE:Your father and I went to Las Vegas with two Hefty bags, and we were proud to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I just don't think that he should go.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:What's that? This? It's a hair net.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:Well, put it on.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner No, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Put it on.
LEADMALE:That is totally embarrassing.
LEADMALE:He looks like an idiot.
LEADMALE:You would prefer that he did this instead of going to Europe? I gotta go to work, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:No more discussions.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, over in France, they don't care if you wear a hair net or not except for under your arms.
LEADMALE:He still wants to go.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't want him to.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we just got back together, Mom.
LEADMALE:Come on, you gotta give a guy his dreams.
LEADFEMALE:Then he won't notice that you control his reality.
LEADMALE:Just stay out of this, okay? Oh, Darlene.
LEADMALE:Men have to do all this World of Pizza-type stuff their whole lives.
LEADMALE:The only thing that keeps them going is hope.
SUPFEMALE:So, no matter how stupid or ridiculous or idiotic their dreams seemI'll be back.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:No, it isn't lumber yet.
SUPFEMALE:Look it, um, well, I've been thinking and the truth of it is I'm actually very excited and looking forward to sailing off with you into the sunset.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you mean? Don't make me actually say it.
LEADFEMALE:I can keep working on the boat? Yeah, but put it together out in the alley because I need the space in here so I can work on my jet.
LEADFEMALE:Deal.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Ginger.
SUPMALE:What? Why don't you throw on a little sequin something and we'll play "find the buried treasure"? Only if you're up for a three-hour tour.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, kids! Mom's home.
OTHERFEMALE:Pork rinds light? Hey, Jackie, what's going on out there? Where are you? What's taking you so long? Well, Roseanne, I hope you didn't strain yourself carrying that one bag.
LEADFEMALE:So I'm glad you decided to let Dan, you know, keep working on his little project in the garage.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, um, how much trouble can you get into on a boat, huh? Hi, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Have you seen my wife Becky? No, Mark.
LEADMALE:She isn't in this episode.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she said she needed some ice.
LEADMALE:You guys have a recipe for that? Ah, I'm dumb.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Darlene! This family sucks.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong, Darlene? I thought you'd be happy now that David's not going to Europe.
OTHERMALE:Ugh.
SUPMALE:Aunt Jackie, you need to shave.
LEADMALE:Hey, everybody.
SUPMALE:Hi, David.
LEADMALE:Hi, David.
OTHERMALE:We definitely watch too much TV.
OTHERMALE:Cut.
LEADMALE:God, I love this new writing.
SUPFEMALE:Where's my new writer? Sherwood.
OTHERMALE:Sherwood! Sherwood Schwartz? Yes, Roseanne? This script is great.
SUPMALE:If it were a pie, I'd eat it.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, Rosie, but you can't stop a scene in the middle like that.
OTHERMALE:I'm the only one who can do that.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? You're fired.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the guy who wrote The Brady Bunch.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid that's me, too.
OTHERMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:You're hired again.
OTHERFEMALE:Welcome aboard.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:
