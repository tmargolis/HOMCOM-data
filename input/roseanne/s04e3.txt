LEADMALE:Remember the frog, the turtle-Well, this one's too big to flush.
SUPFEMALE:Did he follow you home from school or something? No.
LEADFEMALE:I traded Kenny my comic books for him.
LEADMALE:Does Kenny's mom know he traded his dog? She gave me the dog food.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm sorry, d.j. , But you're going to have to take him back, honey.
LEADMALE:Why? Because it's a big responsibility, d.j. Your sisters aren't going to help you.

LEADFEMALE:No more pets.
SUPMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Aroo! Dan, would you like to explain your no more pets rule Or keep kissing the dog? Your mom's right.

OTHERFEMALE:I slept with Arnie.
OTHERMALE:Aah! Aah! What? Oh, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:You slept with Arnie? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:It's out in the open.
LEADFEMALE:So, where's all the supportive stuff? What the hell were you thinking? I was thinking that I just lost A great guy like Gary, And now he's gone, and I'll never find another great guy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 36 years old, I've got flabby arm and pelican neck, All my house planets are dead and no one loves me, But what difference does that make? Everything in my life sucks.
