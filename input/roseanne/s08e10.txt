OTHERMALE:He always wanted to give you guys everything, But over the years, I guess, His dreams kind of fell down one right after the other.
LEADFEMALE:But now he's working for the city, which is great, Because you cannot be fired for any reason whatsoever, you know, Just like being in congress.
LEADFEMALE:And I do have to say, though, That no matter how hard he works, I have always worked harder.
SUPMALE:I have worked Whether your dad was laid up or laid off.
LEADMALE:I'm the one that brought home the bacon.
LEADFEMALE:I cooked it up myself.
OTHERFEMALE:And, yeah sure, I took a few bites off the top, But I figured I got to reward myself some way.
LEADFEMALE:And I have never complained in my entire life.
SUPFEMALE:I've never complained, and I have never ever Asked anybody for help.
SUPMALE:Because, you know, even if I did, it's not like Anybody'd lift a finger to help me anyway.

SUPFEMALE:Wait, he's rock climbing too? I don't like rock climbing.
LEADMALE:Why is he rock climbing? Why are you rock climbing? I don't like rock climbing, So your doing it doesn't impress me.

SUPMALE:You've lost your mind! Oh, so now you're a psychiatrist.
LEADMALE:Look, there goes Fred, The skiing psychiatrist! Me and your aunt Jackie are really close.
SUPFEMALE:We're about as close as two sisters can be.
SUPMALE:But it is kind of funny how life works out, Because in high school she was the one That had all these boyfriends And I never had any boyfriends.
LEADMALE:But now i'm the one that's been married for 23 years And aunt Jackie just barely got a divorce, Which is sad.
SUPMALE:And i'm sure that her little andy's gonna grow up to be some big old flamer Uh, well, which isn't a bad thing.
LEADMALE:I mean, um, gay people are cool.
SUPFEMALE:They're just as good and just as bad as other people.
LEADFEMALE:You might be gay yourself.

LEADFEMALE:But it doesn't mean we love you any less.
LEADMALE:I hope you know that.
LEADMALE:None of this was my idea, d.j. Come on, Deej.

LEADMALE:" So i'd better tell you a little bit about your grandparents.
LEADMALE:You know, my mother's bev.
LEADMALE:She drives me nuts.
OTHERMALE:I mean the woman wears a wool cap in the summer, for god's sake.
SUPMALE:But she raised me and Jackie almost totally by herself, And she never told us that our father Had a girlfriend for 22 years.
LEADMALE:So that tells you everything you need to know about my father.
OTHERMALE:And your father's father Married my very best friend Crystal and they have two kids now.
LEADFEMALE:We don't see 'em that much anymore 'cause your dad Just really doesn't get along with his dad too well.
LEADMALE:And your dad's mom, Well, let's just say She enjoys a cocktail.
SUPMALE:Food, now! Darlene: all right, let's get this over with.
SUPMALE:The pizza place closes at 9:00, which doesn't give me much time To eat this, puke and then drive there.
OTHERFEMALE:hey, you knock it off.
LEADMALE:yeah, leave Mark alone.
LEADFEMALE:This looks good.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, can I go to bed without supper? no.
SUPFEMALE:please? I smoked a cigarette today.
SUPFEMALE:I wish we had a dog.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we did.
OTHERMALE:All right, that's it.

SUPMALE:We're sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:"sorry" only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.
LEADMALE:You guys are unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:Mark really tried to make a good dinner for you people, And you just make fun of him? Well, I guess that's what passes for "thank you" in this family.
LEADMALE:I feel really bad.

LEADMALE:Oh my god! they're eating it.
LEADFEMALE:really? Yeah, look for yourself.
LEADMALE:Oh my god, they are.
OTHERMALE:Suckers! Serves 'em right, ragging on you all day.
SUPFEMALE:What is in that junk anyway? Lots of stuff, but I think it's the jergens That they're really responding to.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't finish that! Get back here! Teach you to smoke a cigarette.
LEADMALE:If you're going in to eat, may I suggest a few of these first? No, Dan, alcohol isn't The answer to everything.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:This is about that whole Fred thing, isn't it? No.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down please.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, it's not about Fred.
LEADMALE:It-it's about me And Fred.
LEADFEMALE:oh, my stomach hurts! I can't get up! What? It's just that Fred has suddenly gotten so interesting, and i've become so boring, And it's not fair, you know? I want to do stuff too, but I have to spend all my time being a mother.
LEADFEMALE:could you give Fred the baby more hours a week? no, I don't want to do that.
OTHERFEMALE:cut back on your hours at work? I can't afford to do that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, take the baby and move in with your mom? Okay, that was just plain mean.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Jackie, I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm out of ideas.
LEADMALE:You've shot down all my suggestions.
SUPFEMALE:You've rejected alcohol out of hand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that I want to do things like ski and stuff And I can't because I have andy.
SUPMALE:And then-I know it sounds horrible-But I feel cheated.
LEADMALE:And then that makes me feel all guilty Because it's not little andy's fault, it's nobody's fault.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just stuck.
SUPMALE:I'm just I'm stuck and i'm alone And I don't know what to do.
SUPMALE:Roseanne and I are always here for you.

LEADFEMALE:Our kids are gonna get a better shot than that.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna make sure they know that they're worth something, And that no matter what they do, No matter how mad they make us Or how bad they screw up, They can always come home.
