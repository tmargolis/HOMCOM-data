LEADMALE:Man, we are so lucky that ShopMore lets us scan our own groceries.
SUPFEMALE:Now we can shop without the hassle of anybody helping us at all! Beep! Mom, that didn't go through.
OTHERFEMALE:I heard it beep.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:You're stealing that.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:They're making me work as a checkout lady, and my starting salary is bacon.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:This young lady just smashed the lids on all these cakes in the bakery section.
LEADMALE:Did you do that? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Security camera caught you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then, say that first.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'll pay for these.
LEADFEMALE:Harris, why don't you just go wait outside? Oh, damn it.
SUPFEMALE:It's David.
LEADFEMALE:That's why she smashed the cakes.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Get a summer beach body.
SUPMALE:What's going on? He just texted to say he's coming tomorrow for Harris' birthday party.
OTHERFEMALE:He must have already texted her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she should be happy to see her father.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, sure, if he actually shows up.
SUPFEMALE:And he only showed up like three times in Chicago.
LEADMALE:And the anxiety of whether he's gonna be here or not really messes with her head.
LEADFEMALE:I just have a feeling that Harris isn't gonna be disappointed this year.
LEADFEMALE:I think David is gonna show up.
LEADMALE:Why would you think that? Psh.
SUPMALE:No reason.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:You're in touch with David behind my back.
LEADMALE:That is so wrong! Well, David's kinda like my son and you're kinda like my daughter, so of course I'm involved.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want him knowing everything about my life.
SUPMALE:All's I told him is that you lost your job, you haven't met anybody, and sometimes you're depressed.
SUPMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:I'll buy those cakes.
LEADMALE:Hit it, Mary.
SUPFEMALE:Beep! "Roseanne" is taped in front of a live audience.
LEADFEMALE:I talked to Harris.
LEADFEMALE:She's doing better.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't realize she messed 'em up that bad.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not all Harris.
SUPMALE:You know, I needed to see what was inside some of them.
LEADMALE:Uh, I almost wasted my time fixing up a carrot cake.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I yelled at you at the market.
LEADFEMALE:This is just really hard for me.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:You know, David's made a lot of mistakes, but he's still a good person.
LEADFEMALE:And I want my grandkids to have a father.
SUPFEMALE:You think I don't want that? I don't even like kids.
LEADFEMALE:He's the only person I ever wanted to replicate with.
LEADFEMALE:Have you told him that? 'Cause talk like that drives men wild.
LEADMALE:How can you defend him? He's been running around the world building houses for poor people in third-world countries.
LEADMALE:Does that sound like a good person to you? Okay.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:But he's a bad person, too.
SUPFEMALE:David can't just walk in here like everything's fine now.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, he can walk in here.
LEADMALE:Just won't be able to walk out.
LEADFEMALE:You can't keep him from seeing his kids, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:He's their father.
SUPMALE:Well, if he acted like it, he'd be welcome here.
LEADMALE:There is no reason to ever leave your family.
SUPFEMALE:You may think about it, you may dream about it you may gas up your bike and make sandwiches but you don't ever do it.
SUPFEMALE:So that's what you did that day! I knew there was no "drywall convention.
LEADMALE:" I've said too much.
LEADFEMALE:JACKIE: I got it! Hello, Jackie.
LEADMALE:You look tired.
LEADFEMALE:Nice outfit.
OTHERFEMALE:I see you're trying it without the sickle.
LEADMALE:Hey, Roseanne! Looks like that "putting Mom in a home" thing didn't stick! Mom, what are you doing here? What's with the suitcases? The retirement home asked me to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Did they figure out you're never gonna die? What did you do? Nothing but live my life.
LEADFEMALE:I watch TV, I play cards, I have an occasional drink, but apparently at my age I am not supposed to enjoy a healthy sex life.
SUPMALE:With multiple partners in multiple parts of the facility.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:What? I had sex.
SUPFEMALE:Is that so difficult to imagine? Not anymore.
LEADMALE:Now it's hard to stop imagining.
SUPMALE:They said I can go back if I write a letter of apology, and I am not ready to do that.
LEADMALE:Now, if you don't mind, I need to get some sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you do.
LEADMALE:What the hell are you doing out there? I told you I was coming.
LEADMALE:I need to talk to you.
LEADMALE:Give me one good reason why I should let you in.
LEADFEMALE:'Cause I'm gonna fall.
SUPMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:I'm vegan now.
OTHERMALE:I have no upper-arm strength.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you coming in the window, anyway? Does your dad still live here? Yeah? That's why I'm coming in through the window.
LEADMALE:Are you okay? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I just need to put my hands on my knees and breathe hard for a second.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, wow.
LEADMALE:Aww.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:They kept everything exactly the same as it was when you guys were kids.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, it's a decorating choice called "poverty.
SUPFEMALE:" So what'd you want to talk about? Something I think you'll be happy to hear.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I've heard it before, David You miss me, you want to get back together, then as soon as things get real, you run back to Deadbeats Without Borders.
LEADMALE:Not this time.
LEADMALE:I just, uh I just signed a lease.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm moving back to Lanford.
LEADFEMALE:See? I realized it's not too late to fix things.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:It's over on Fourth.
SUPFEMALE:That's so nice.
SUPMALE:It's right by Mark's school.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:I met someone.
SUPMALE:You met someone? How'd you meet someone? Uh, I was somewhere, and she was there, too.
SUPMALE:It's not that unusual really.
OTHERFEMALE:Her name's Blue, and I've learned so much from her.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:So we're just gonna blow right past the whole Blue thing? I was hoping to, yeah.
LEADMALE:She's made me see so many things.
SUPFEMALE:I-I realized I was in denial.
LEADFEMALE:I thought Harris and Mark were better off without me.
OTHERFEMALE:And then I realized how unfair it is, to you, not to give you a divorce so you can have some closure.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:So let me get this straight.
SUPFEMALE:While I have been picking up kids' clothes, dealing with meltdowns, cleaning up vomit, you're dating a crayon?! I know.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:But she's really good for me.
LEADMALE:And t-that's just gonna make me be better for you and the kids.
SUPFEMALE:So how serious is this thing? Mm.
OTHERFEMALE:Blue says she won't merge our spiritual paths until you and I sign divorce papers.
OTHERMALE:Okay, so, what if I don't want a divorce? Why wouldn't you? We both hate me.
LEADFEMALE:I-I don't know how I feel about you, David.
SUPMALE:You come in here, you throw all this stuff at me I thought you would want this.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't mean to stress you out.
LEADFEMALE:Now I'm stressed out.
SUPMALE:Okay, now I'm stressed out and turned on.
OTHERFEMALE:What am I gonna tell Blue? Tell her she's got a stupid name.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? Studying your face.
LEADMALE:Why? You look like my kids.
SUPFEMALE:That's weird.
SUPFEMALE:You look like mine.
LEADMALE:You know you're gonna have to talk to Blue.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:And you're really done running around saving the world? You got that out of your system? I got dysentery in Angola.
LEADMALE:That gets everything out of your system.
OTHERMALE:You know, when I left you and the kids, I rationalized that it was okay because I was helping people.
LEADMALE:The truth is, I left because my brother died and I was overwhelmed with all the responsibility and I I just ran.
SUPMALE:And once I was out there, I was ashamed, and I-I Frankly, I didn't expect for you to let me talk this long, so Well, you were finally being honest with yourself, so I didn't want to spook ya.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You got to go.
LEADMALE:My dad will be up by now.
LEADMALE:I'll call you after I talk to him if it's safe to come back over.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You know what? She's my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:I'm coming to her party no matter what.
OTHERMALE:David, it's really cute when you assert yourself, but let me just prepare my dad for this.
LEADFEMALE:Cute? Come on.
LEADMALE:Don't Why do you always have to belittle me like that? I'm a grown man.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:God.
LEADMALE:Don't be so sensitive.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me what not to be.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Then do be less sensitive.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:How about this? You be less controlling, and I'll be less sensitive.
SUPFEMALE:You know what? Let's not do this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I-It's okay.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't been around me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a different person now.
LEADMALE:Other than your father, I'm not so easily intimidated.
LEADFEMALE:You know what they called me in Guatemala? I don't know either 'cause it was in Spanish, but they said it with incredible respect.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, hotshot, but if my dad finds you, they're gonna call me "El Widow Blanco.
SUPMALE:" I told you, I don't speak Spanish.
LEADMALE:It's so great hanging out with you girls.
SUPMALE:I missed this.
SUPFEMALE:Us too.
LEADFEMALE:You know what we should do, Roseanne? Um, we should have you visit Mom more often when she goes back to the home.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh I suppose this is as good a time as any to break the bad news.
SUPMALE:Make it short, but painful, and not hereditary.
LEADFEMALE:I can't go back to the home.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna have to stay here with you girls.
LEADFEMALE:Painful for her! For her! What are you talking about, Mom? You said you could go back if you apologized.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, that's not the whole truth.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, they said that I am "a danger to others.
SUPFEMALE:" I gave a couple of the men a little gonorrhea.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I think this is for the better.
SUPMALE:I was starting to feel that you had forgotten me entirely.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mom, I haven't forgotten you.
SUPFEMALE:There's just been so much going on, with Darlene moving back in and her kids.
LEADFEMALE:And you? You really want to get into it? Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Is Dad home yet? No, he went to pick up some pain pills for my knee.
LEADMALE:When's that situation gonna change? Uh, as soon as one of you girls marries an orthopedic surgeon.
SUPMALE:Or a drug dealer.
LEADMALE:I know where the smart money is.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's gonna have to be Becky.
LEADMALE:Because, uh, David stopped by last night.
LEADFEMALE:We hung out and we talked, and I think we're gonna work things out.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God! You slept with him?! It's one thing for Grandma to be having sex with some veiny-legged old guy.
LEADFEMALE:But you and your husband? That's disgusting! I need a Bloody Mary.
LEADMALE:Why would you do that? Uh, what do you mean? Try to get back together with David.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? You said he was a good person.
LEADFEMALE:I said I should give him another chance.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I meant as a father, not as a husband.
LEADFEMALE:You guys are a disaster as a couple.
LEADMALE:It's like Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Jekyll and Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Hyde.
LEADFEMALE:And David.
OTHERMALE:He's different now.
OTHERFEMALE:He's totally self-aware.
LEADFEMALE:He realized the only reason he left the first time around was because he couldn't handle the pressures of fatherhood.
SUPFEMALE:That's not why he left.
LEADMALE:He left because you guys were fighting all the time, and that's what he couldn't handle.
SUPFEMALE:What? You don't know that.
SUPMALE:I do know.
OTHERMALE:He told me.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:I think I know a little bit more about this than you do.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:You're gonna do what you're gonna do.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm just trying to help you have a happy life, you know, so you don't get so blue.
LEADFEMALE:If you need me, I'm gonna be in the driveway waiting for my pain pills.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not a Bloody Mary.
LEADMALE:They have vodka, but they don't have tomato juice or Tabasco.
LEADMALE:I'm just calling this a Mary.
LEADMALE:Cheers.
SUPMALE:Mom's trying to blow up me and David.
LEADMALE:She's telling me there's no way our relationship can work.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:I love David.
LEADMALE:But you guys have been going at this for 20 years.
SUPFEMALE:It's like that ham radio Dad tinkers with in the garage.
SUPFEMALE:If it was gonna work, it would've worked by now.
LEADFEMALE:Dad just got that radio working.
LEADFEMALE:He's got a friend in Duluth that's 102.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, fine.
SUPFEMALE:You know what? Then just keep tinkering, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what, so now I'm supposed to take advice from you, Becky? No.
LEADFEMALE:Take advice from you.
LEADMALE:Position, feel thyself.
LEADFEMALE:None of those words are right.
OTHERMALE:And I don't know what you're talking about.
SUPMALE:You told me I never moved on after Mark died.
LEADMALE:End the misery.
LEADFEMALE:Grieve and get on with your life.
OTHERFEMALE:Your words.
SUPMALE:David didn't die.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but your marriage did.
SUPMALE:Thanks to your advice, I'm getting ready for a second date with a really nice guy tonight.
LEADMALE:Doesn't smoke.
SUPFEMALE:He's not married, Has all his own teeth.
LEADMALE:If you're so happy, how come you're drinking before the date? Because I have a drinking problem.
SUPFEMALE:Dad? Wow.
LEADFEMALE:You came.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Did the world run out of poor people? No, it's worse than it's ever been.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, happy birthday.
LEADFEMALE:I-I brought you something.
LEADFEMALE:It's a T-shirt.
LEADFEMALE:"Love One An' Otter.
SUPMALE:" Cute.
OTHERMALE:I-It's from an aquarium in in Costa Rica.
LEADMALE:'Cause I know you love animals and you wear T-shirts.
SUPMALE:Uh, so, good news.
SUPMALE:Uh, I'm moving to Lanford.
OTHERFEMALE:Your mom and I, we're we're good.
LEADFEMALE:So I-I'm gonna be here all the time.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:You have enough guilt to buy me some weed? No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I have enough guilt to buy you ice cream.
SUPMALE:Baby steps.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:We've got a lot of cake.
SUPFEMALE:I told you to wait for my call.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I just I got excited.
SUPFEMALE:So, let's go give everyone the good news.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think your dad will kill me in front of the kids.
OTHERMALE:David.
LEADFEMALE:There's no good news.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? It's just not gonna work.
SUPMALE:Sure it is.
SUPFEMALE:We worked last night.
SUPMALE:First of all, I remember doing most of the work.
OTHERMALE:The truth is, we're delusional if we think we can make each other happy.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna fight, you're gonna run, and we're gonna break the kids' hearts.
LEADMALE:We talked.
LEADFEMALE:We know what went wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:We belong together.
SUPMALE:You're the first person I loved, and I still love you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too, you know, and if it was just us, I swear I would keep doing this over and over again, even if it never worked.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not just us.
OTHERFEMALE:You okay? I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Hello, David.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:Sir.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:H-H-How are you doing? I've been better.
SUPFEMALE:I hear you're moving back to Lanford.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a place.
SUPMALE:I'll be back permanently in two weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Then that's when you'll see the kids.
LEADMALE:Questions? Comments? No, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You always were a smart boy.
LEADMALE:So what now? You're gonna do what you came here to do.
OTHERMALE:You're gonna be a great father.
LEADFEMALE:You can do that, right? Yeah, I can.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Mark's got a parent-teacher night in a month.
LEADMALE:So you be there.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:What's Mark like? He's, uh, really artistic, very sweet, like you.
LEADFEMALE:And he likes to wear dresses.
OTHERMALE:So now you're all caught up.
OTHERMALE:You goin'? Didn't go so well.
LEADFEMALE:It could've gone a lot worse.
SUPMALE:Luckily we're a very forgiving family.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I guess you're gonna have to forgive us for that.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I am gonna do the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:You better, 'cause if you don't, there's not gonna be anybody left in this house to be on your side.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're a quality person, David.
OTHERMALE:I want you to prove me right.
LEADMALE:I will.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:David? Yes, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner? Tuck in your shirt there.
LEADFEMALE:You're not 15 anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:The rules are simple Hands behind your backs, first one to finish their cake wins.
SUPMALE:Okay, if I go into diabetic shock, I want you to get my insulin pen and then you know, quick And then point me back to my cake.
LEADFEMALE:And go! This is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:Really? My guess it's not.
OTHERFEMALE:
