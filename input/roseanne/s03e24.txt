LEADFEMALE:This Mother's Day thing really bites.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:A whole Sunday totally wasted.
LEADFEMALE:Like her birthday wasn't enough.
LEADMALE:Hey, your mom works real hard all year.
OTHERFEMALE:She deserves one day to relax and do nothing.
LEADMALE:What about us? We don't get a kid's day.
OTHERMALE:Some day, my angel, you'll be a parent and realize that every day is kid's day.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, you just want to smack them when they say that.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't park in the driveway, like you asked.
LEADFEMALE:I cleaned the entire house, went shopping for the barbecue items.
LEADMALE:Is there anything else I can do while I'm queen for a damned day? Did you remember the beer? Just wait till Father's Day.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're here already? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's grandma? Talking to the radio station.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Don't go to a station break when I'm in the middle of my opinion.
OTHERMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Do it your way.
SUPFEMALE:I'm on hold.
SUPMALE:What's the topic? Meat.
LEADMALE:This Ted from Toledo thinks it's mean to kill cows.
LEADFEMALE:Does he want us to eat them alive? That's very good.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll use that.
OTHERMALE:What took you so long? We made three stops so she could phone in her outrage.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you be glad that you live in a country where anybody can pull over to a Stuckey's and express their freedom of speech.
SUPFEMALE:And get a nice pecan log.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Ted, I am at a barbecue.
OTHERMALE:What do you suggest we put on the grill? Broccoli? When did you guys get here? A couple minutes ago.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on.
OTHERMALE:Danny! My favorite grandson-in-law! Hey, kids! Nana Mary's here! You giving them what-for, grandma? I'm trying to, but the kind of people that call into these talk shows, they're not the brightest in the world.
SUPMALE:Nana Mary! Hi, Nana Mary! Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Hold on, hold on! My three gorgeous great-grandchildren just walked in.
LEADFEMALE:And guess what? You'll never believe it, but little Darlene has boobies! You remember that Ethel Schneider? She lived in the apartment across the hall? Yeah.
SUPMALE:The one with the rich grandson that would be perfect for you, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:That's the one.
SUPMALE:What about her? Dead.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:If the grandson's at the funeral, you could wear that scoop-necked black sweater.
LEADMALE:Knock it off.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to talk about my love life or dead people.
SUPFEMALE:Can I talk about my love life? Yes, fine.
LEADMALE:Well, you remember that Marvin Spencer? He was the one with the hot pants for me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:He asked you out? Yes, once.
LEADMALE:Oh, we had a wonderful time.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? But he never called me again.
SUPMALE:Why not? Dead.
OTHERMALE:See? I'm I'm leaving.
LEADFEMALE:You coward! Grandma, you should move in.
LEADMALE:We could do this to Jackie all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, we've been through this before.
LEADMALE:Suppose I didn't like living here.
LEADFEMALE:Then you'd fit right in.
SUPFEMALE:Can I bring anything out to the table? Chips or dip or something? No, I don't want you to take anything.
LEADMALE:Just 'cause I'm pregnant doesn't mean I can't pitch in.
SUPFEMALE:Crystal, it's because you eat everything before you get it out there.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the baby's hungry.
SUPFEMALE:You keep feeding him like that and he'll never want to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Mary, I can't tell you how good it is to see you again.

SUPFEMALE:No, you're trying to steal my recipe.
LEADMALE:Get the hell out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why won't you give me your recipe? I slaved for 30 years, creating a perfect potato salad.
LEADFEMALE:You think I'll tell you just like that? Well, I am your granddaughter.
LEADFEMALE:In regards to my potato salad, you are nothing to me.
LEADFEMALE:And speaking of nothing, did you call your mother? I'll call her later.
LEADMALE:You know, I don't talk bad about anybody Yeah, I know.

OTHERFEMALE:It's ok, honey.
SUPFEMALE:We're at a barbecue at your brother Dan's house, and all our friends are here.
SUPFEMALE:I read that you should talk to the baby so he can get used to your voice.
OTHERMALE:He can even understand a little.
SUPMALE:Hey, baby, back off the buffet.
SUPMALE:Rosey! What? I need a big bowl.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, it's in the cupboard next to the sink.

LEADMALE:Uh-oh, we're out of coffee.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make some more.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:This ain't work.
LEADFEMALE:If people want coffee, they can make it their self.

SUPMALE:Hey, she puts Tabasco in the potato salad.
OTHERFEMALE:No way! I'm making myself a bloody Mary.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going long.
SUPFEMALE:Say, Dan, you might think about stacking those coals like a pyramid.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:This way, you get them all with the lighter fluid.
LEADFEMALE:Stack them, you miss the ones in the middle.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you spray them first and stack them after? Well, no, no, no.
OTHERMALE:See, all your fluid evaporates if you do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Trust me, it's better this way.
LEADFEMALE:I disagree.
LEADFEMALE:The way you got them, they're spread out, working all alone, but if you stack them, they're working like a team.
SUPMALE:Well, let me ask you something, Chuck.
SUPFEMALE:Once they're stacked in a pyramid, are you going to cook in a pyramid? Of course not.
OTHERMALE:You spread them out.
SUPFEMALE:If they're going to wind up spread out, why not start them spread out? See, Dan, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:No, I understand! You're just arguing in circles, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, no Well, you know what I'd do? The ones that didn't light, I'd blast them with another shot of fluid.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know what you're talking about.
LEADFEMALE:You blast hot coals with lighter fluid Up the stream, into the can, and boom! You'll be a human torch.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, those burgers are looking pretty thick.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think they'll cook.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm going to stack them in a pyramid so they'll cook as a team.
