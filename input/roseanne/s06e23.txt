LEADFEMALE:Well, it will never happen again.
LEADFEMALE:I can tell you that much.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mom, now you never were a quitter.
LEADFEMALE:My one attempt with jake and I almost kill myself.

LEADMALE:And then later, you can tell him, You know, more intimate things that you like.
SUPMALE:Well, I never had a chance to learn what I like.
SUPFEMALE:That's really, really sad.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know, maybe it would help If you tell me what you like.
LEADMALE:UhI like it when Dan rubs my shoulders too.
SUPMALE:Just like you.
