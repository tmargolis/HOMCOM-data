LEADMALE:Becky, this ain't art class.
SUPFEMALE:Put a glob on, then check your turkey.
LEADMALE:I already stuffed it, seasoned it, and basted it.
LEADFEMALE:What should I do next, massage it? Whatever floats your boat.
LEADMALE:You still mashing those yams? I'm trying to get the fly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, it's a big one, too, isn't it? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We'll just add some raisins.
SUPMALE:Mom! All right.
LEADFEMALE:Throw it away and start a new batch.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, look! It came out of its hole to forage for food.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes they'll eat out of your hand.
SUPFEMALE:Get the camera.
LEADMALE:That was so funny, I'm going back to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Guess what, Darlene? You're making the fruit salad.
SUPFEMALE:Guess what, Becky? You're a big mo.
SUPFEMALE:Guess what, Darlene? You're making the fruit salad, or I'll break your neck.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, could you go to the garage and get the card table and dust it off? I could, but I'd miss the bears-lions pre-game show, and that would be wrong.
SUPMALE:You're not parking your butt on that sofa while we're in here slaving away.
SUPFEMALE:What, exactly, is it that you're doing? I'm pacing myself.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Grocery patrol reporting as ordered.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne's famous homemade pumpkin pies.
SUPMALE:Don't forget your famous homemade dessert topping.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? Home to change.
SUPMALE:I'll be back in an hour.
SUPMALE:You're hiding from mom, Then at 6:00 you'll say you had cramps.
LEADMALE:I'm not doing that this year, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a different person.
LEADMALE:I can handle my mother.
SUPFEMALE:I'm done with the stupid fruit salad.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you supposed to peel the fruit? I'm not eating this crap.
LEADFEMALE:Why should I make it? You're not having dinner? I opt not to celebrate the exploitation of indians by religious fanatics.
OTHERMALE:Good point.
SUPMALE:No sale.
SUPMALE:I want to hang out in my room alone.
SUPMALE:Why can't you people understand that? God, Dan, your daughter is really starting to get on my nerves.
LEADMALE:Come here, little Ed.
LEADMALE:You're getting so big, We'll start calling you big little Ed.
LEADMALE:He puts on a pound every day.
LEADMALE:That's Dan's average.
LEADFEMALE:All muscle, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Let me hold him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look at those big, blue eyes! Oh, you're so cute.
LEADMALE:I want one.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:k.
LEADMALE:, Becky, that's enough for you.
LEADFEMALE:Would you get the diapers from the car? I'll do it later.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Lonnie.
LEADMALE:You like football? Hate it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Football's great for hatred.
SUPMALE:You can hate the refs, Hate the opposing quarterback, And you've got to hate those guys whose faces are painted blue.
LEADMALE:Hello, hello, everybody! Hi.
SUPMALE:Hello, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my aching butt.
LEADMALE:Stop it, mother.
SUPFEMALE:That's a brand-new car.
OTHERFEMALE:Happy thanksgiving.
SUPMALE:So how was the drive? I'd forgotten it was so long.
LEADFEMALE:Where's dad? He couldn't make it.
SUPFEMALE:He's under the weather.
SUPMALE:He's sick, what's the matter with him? I brought my special stuffing.
LEADMALE:I already made stuffing.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You'll eat your stuffing.
LEADMALE:Everybody else will eat mine.
OTHERMALE:Who needs a drink? I'd love half a glass of wine.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Half a glass of wine.
SUPFEMALE:Bring out the bottle.
LEADMALE:Yeah? What do you need, Mary? I need three fingers of bourbon, And a beer chaser.
SUPMALE:One big boiler coming up.
LEADMALE:Grandma.
SUPMALE:Hi! Hello, little hardbody.
SUPFEMALE:How do you keep that body so damn trim? It's her nerves.
OTHERMALE:Nervous people are too thin.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go.
SUPMALE:It's true I read it in a magazine.
OTHERMALE:Before you even ask, I'm doing great.
SUPMALE:I don't have a boyfriend now, but it's because I'm feeling independent and secure, and I feel better about myself than I have in years.
SUPFEMALE:That's the truth.
SUPMALE:Well, that certainly was a mouthful, wasn't it? Becky! Well, nice going, silver tongue.
OTHERMALE:Where's dad? She says he's sick.
LEADMALE:I talked to him a few days ago.
LEADMALE:He was fine.
LEADFEMALE:You cut your hair! Do you like it? What's important is that you like it, dear.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, I notice your table is not set.
LEADFEMALE:You do plan on setting it, don't you? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll throw the food on the floor and have everybody fight for it.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'll set the table.
LEADMALE:Where's the good china? Over at your house till the reading of the will.
LEADMALE:Enter and die.
OTHERMALE:I need a little breather.
SUPMALE:Grandma, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, she's o.
SUPFEMALE:k.
OTHERFEMALE:, But sometimes I just Hate her guts? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I mean, no.
SUPMALE:Nobody hates their mom.
OTHERFEMALE:At least, you're not supposed to.
SUPFEMALE:Well, mi casa es su casa.
LEADFEMALE:Catcher in the rye? oh, god, that's a good one.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Did you read it? No.
SUPMALE:But we were assigned to read it in high school.
SUPFEMALE:That was my sophomore year.
LEADMALE:Yeah, 'cause I had this crush on Terry Halligan.
LEADFEMALE:He was this great-looking college guy.
SUPMALE:So I shortened all my skirts And didn't crack open a book.
LEADFEMALE:Then report cards came out, mom grounded me, And that was the end of Terry Halligan.
SUPMALE:She was always doing that stuff! This other time-Jackie, would you like to read a book? Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:There's some Kurt Vonnegut on the top shelf.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Cat in the hat.
OTHERFEMALE:perfect.
LEADMALE:Well, yes, honey, we miss you so much.
OTHERMALE:Stop that, Ed.
LEADFEMALE:People are listening.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, they can hear me, and I said "stop that.
LEADFEMALE:" They all know what that means.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ed, you're terrible! Ha ha ha ha! Give--you--you-Whoa, me wear something strapless? O.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:, dad, but first I have to shave my back.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and you're an old pervert! We understand.
SUPFEMALE:You got stuck on the road.
LEADMALE:Of course you couldn't see it coming.
LEADFEMALE:Buffalo.
LEADMALE:Winter.
LEADMALE:Snow.
LEADMALE:What are the odds? O.
LEADMALE:k.
SUPFEMALE:, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:I'll talk to you when you get back.
OTHERMALE:I'd better get going.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie needs the phone.
LEADFEMALE:You're really sucking up that chardonnay, beverly.
LEADMALE:It's my first glass, mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Quit treating me like a child! First glass, my aching butt! How much has grandma had? Six fingers, and a very generous thumb.
SUPMALE:Your dad says to save him a big turkey leg.
SUPFEMALE:His name's Ed, and he's my stepdad.
SUPFEMALE:And he says he misses you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not sitting at the kids' table.
OTHERMALE:You can talk to Becky.
OTHERFEMALE:No way, you guys.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 17.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not watching d.j. Make another mashed potato town.
LEADMALE:Well, looks like d.j. is the kiddies table.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of pathetic, isn't it? All right, everybody eats in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Grab a chair.
LEADMALE:I just called dad again.
SUPFEMALE:Still no answer.
LEADFEMALE:I said he was sick.
LEADMALE:Maybe you shouldn't have left him alone.
LEADMALE:He's not that sick.
SUPFEMALE:He's fine.
OTHERMALE:Why didn't he answer the phone? Maybe he didn't hear it.
LEADMALE:He's nearly deaf in one ear.
LEADFEMALE:How many ears does it take to hear the phone? Usually he sleeps on his good one.
SUPFEMALE:Are you buying this? Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:Not me.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:k.
SUPMALE:, girls, there is something you should know, but I don't think now is the time.
LEADFEMALE:Now is the perfect time.
LEADMALE:We want to know now.
LEADMALE:You have a fight? We'll talk about it after dinner.
LEADMALE:Uh-uh, no way, Because there won't be a dinner unless you tell us.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:This year, your father is spending thanksgiving with his girlfriend.
SUPFEMALE:Now, let's eat.
OTHERMALE:My, that turkey smells delicious.
LEADMALE:Now, Crystal, that car seat is from Rodbell's.
SUPFEMALE:If you want to take it back, the receipt's in the box.
LEADFEMALE:No, I love it.
LEADMALE:Al and I felt the baby would enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:There's a little steering wheel and a little horn.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing he can swallow, and he can chew on all of it.
SUPFEMALE:She hasn't stopped yakking since we sat down.
SUPFEMALE:Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
LEADMALE:The woman's a mental case.
LEADFEMALE:Dad? Dad? What do you need, Deej? I can't hear anything anybody's saying.
LEADMALE:No wonder the kid can't hear.
LEADFEMALE:He's practically sitting in the john.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll try to talk louder, d.j. What? She said to shut up and eat.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, I thought Mark was coming.
OTHERMALE:He was supposed to, but he decided to have TV dinners with his buddies.
LEADMALE:That reminds me of the cutest TV show-No, it doesn't.
SUPFEMALE:So, where's Darlene? The daughter of doom? She's upstairs hiding from the sunlight.
LEADFEMALE:You know, now I think I got it.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute-you married Dan's father, And Dan is married to my granddaughter.
LEADMALE:So that makes your baby Nothing to me.
LEADMALE:Honey, would you stop that? Lonnie, I said please.
LEADMALE:Stop it! Stop what? d.j. ! Well, I hope you all noticed-the only thing that kid ate was my stuffing.
SUPMALE:I think I lost my appetite.
SUPMALE:I'll go talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody touch that plate.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't done.
SUPFEMALE:Can I be excused? Yeah, yeah, just get out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:If it wasn't for all that jabbering, it was a very fine meal.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you think so, because this is the last thanksgiving I'm ever having.
LEADMALE:Do you realize there are four generations of our family in this kitchen right now? I'm so proud I could just burst.
LEADMALE:I'd pay to see that.
LEADMALE:I'll have my coffee in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:No, you will not, because you're going to spill your guts.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne Sit.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? It's very simple.
LEADMALE:Your father has met a younger woman.
LEADFEMALE:She's 57 and works in his office.
SUPMALE:Then you'll just have to throw his sorry butt out.
LEADFEMALE:No, I will not.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you're going to just stay with the jerk? We've only heard one side of this story.
SUPFEMALE:He's 60 years old.
LEADFEMALE:He's screwing around.
LEADMALE:That's disgusting.
LEADMALE:That's his side.
LEADMALE:I knew she'd take up for her father.
OTHERMALE:That is so typical.
SUPFEMALE:I guess none of us here have never made a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:Please.
OTHERMALE:Should I hear this? No.
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Wait.
OTHERMALE:How long has the affair been going on? I've known about it for a couple of years, and this morning he finally decided to tell me.
LEADMALE:He's been seeing some office tramp for two years And you never said anything? Come on, beverly, grow up.
LEADMALE:You can't let a man walk all over you like that.
SUPMALE:I didn't want to rock the boat.
LEADMALE:What boat? You don't have a boat.
LEADFEMALE:You have a lousy marriage.
SUPMALE:Watch your mouth, young lady.
OTHERFEMALE:This is serious stuff.
LEADMALE:People get divorced over stuff like this.
OTHERMALE:I'm too old to start my life over again.
SUPMALE:Let me handle it my way.
SUPMALE:I'm telling him what I think.
SUPFEMALE:Where is he? This isn't about your father, this is about my husband.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to stay out of it.
LEADMALE:Please! You're her mother.
SUPMALE:Do something.
OTHERMALE:When she asks for my help, I'll arrange to have your father killed.
SUPFEMALE:But until then, you got to understand-She's scared.
SUPFEMALE:She doesn't know how to live alone.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's the way I raised her.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should blame myself.
LEADFEMALE:Who the hell needs that? Does anybody want any pie? You don't want to sneak beers? No.
SUPFEMALE:Let's at least go get some hot dogs.
SUPMALE:I'm starved.
OTHERMALE:I'm trying to read.
OTHERFEMALE:My mom says you're having a nervous breakdown.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I could snap any minute.
LEADMALE:Is that how come the black clothes? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:They gave them to me at the asylum.
LEADFEMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:I'm not a kid.
SUPMALE:You're a fetus.
SUPFEMALE:You turned into a complete dork.
LEADFEMALE:People change.
LEADMALE:Get used to it or die.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Ho ho ho ho! Aah-ha.
LEADMALE:I used to be a pretty good nerf ball player.
SUPMALE:I was going to turn pro-Did mom tell you to talk to me? No, I'm just making sure Darlene was having any fun.
LEADMALE:Anyway, you're out of here.
LEADMALE:The baby's ready to go.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:He's the boss.
LEADFEMALE:When my dad's gone, you're the man of the house.
SUPMALE:I was before your dad moved in.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:k, forget man of the house.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know where was going with that.
SUPMALE:The thing is, your attitude-the way you tick everybody off-it's not going to get you anywhere.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:I got another new father.
SUPMALE:Actually, you got a new big brother.
LEADMALE:If you act like this next thanksgiving, I'll knock you down and sit on your head.
OTHERFEMALE:Kids.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Listen, I got an idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's ditch the fossils and catch a late movie.
SUPMALE:You still don't get it, do you? No, Darlene, I don't.
LEADFEMALE:You've been moping around for two months And I don't have a clue.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not trying to be mean.
SUPFEMALE:Just stop worrying about me.
LEADMALE:I can't help it.
LEADMALE:I know we're not best buddies anymore.
LEADFEMALE:We don't even talk anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I talk.
SUPMALE:Nobody listens.
LEADMALE:I just want to finish my book.
LEADMALE:I just came up here to get Lonnie anyway.
LEADMALE:Did I interrupt something? She wants to be left alone.
LEADMALE:Who doesn't? Well, what's new at the zoo? Not much.
SUPMALE:Thanks, but I'm really not hungry.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't for you.
SUPMALE:This is mine.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not bothering you, am I? No, you're cool.
SUPMALE:I can't wait to get a place of my own.
OTHERFEMALE:Try New York.
LEADFEMALE:They got great Chinese food there.
LEADFEMALE:Anything to get out of Lanford.
SUPMALE:It's so phony here.
LEADFEMALE:All the kids at school have totally changed.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a freak because I don't kiss up to juniors and seniors.
LEADMALE:I know exactly how you feel.
LEADMALE:Where I come from, If you don't play bridge They think you're a communist.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't people just let you be yourself? Have you ever felt like you don't want to talk to anybody? Like you just need to figure things out? I get this perfect image of what I want to be, But at school I'm just this total geek again.
LEADMALE:You're young.
LEADFEMALE:You got to give it time.
LEADMALE:Tell that to my parents.
LEADMALE:They want to know what the problem is, But how can I tell them if I don't know? Darlene, be patient with them.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I guess.
OTHERMALE:Have a little turkey.
LEADFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I've decided to quit eating meat.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the stuffing you're scarfing down is full of meat.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I meant big chunks of meat.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thanks again, Roseanne, I had a wonderful time.
LEADFEMALE:What's it take to make you miserable? Well, anyway, the food was good.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Dan.
LEADMALE:Drop by the shop.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll give you work.
LEADMALE:That's cool.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Crystal, tell my dad he better not leave me alone for the new year's games I'm going to kick his butt.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want any arguments.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sleeping on the pull-out tonight.
LEADMALE:I don't care how lumpy it is.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we had nana Mary this year.
SUPFEMALE:No way.
SUPMALE:I've got nana Mary.
LEADMALE:Come on, Jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:These party poopers are turning in.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's hit a bar.
LEADMALE:Hold on a second.

LEADFEMALE:Good luck with your trucking career.
SUPMALE:Good night, grandma.

SUPMALE:Not with these relatives.
LEADMALE:I made you a, uh plate, though.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm not that hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Good, 'cause I ate it an hour ago.
