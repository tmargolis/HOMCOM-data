SUPFEMALE:She's here to get us back for what we did today.
LEADMALE:No way! I'm serious, Dan, she hates the lodge.
SUPFEMALE:The only reason she'd show up on our turf Is to try and humiliate us in front of our friends.

SUPFEMALE:Could have saved her a trip.
LEADFEMALE:Great act, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, what was your favorite part? I liked the jokes.

SUPMALE:Roseanne was against it, But we needed a big closer.

OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Dan.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jer.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, where's Rosie? Where's Kathy? At the car getting a sweater.
OTHERMALE:Then Rosie's in the bushes watching her.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks Kathy's going to get even for the trick.
SUPMALE:Kathy was so mad she didn't speak to me all day.
LEADMALE:You owe me a beer.
LEADMALE:I guess I do.
SUPFEMALE:Gus Why call if you didn't want to see me? It wasn't a happy time that night at Jackie's.
SUPMALE:I wanted to talk to someone who wasn't my sister.
LEADMALE:So you needed to talk to someone, Here I am, let's talk.
SUPFEMALE:I called other guys.
OTHERMALE:I'm the only one that showed up.

SUPFEMALE:I made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, sit down.
LEADMALE:There's something I've been wanting to ask you since we broke up.

LEADMALE:Well-I can't talk to you now.
LEADMALE:Jerry, let's go home.
LEADMALE:Bye, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, Jer.
LEADFEMALE:Leaving already, or is that what you want me to think? Roseanne, why are you following me? Why were you at your car? Getting my sweater.
LEADFEMALE:Why were you doing that? To get away from you.
OTHERMALE:Then what are you doing here in the first place? My husband asked me to come, So I did.
LEADFEMALE:Married people do things like that for one another.
SUPMALE:Don't make me laugh.
LEADFEMALE:How many times do I have to tell you That I am not going to waste One iota of energy getting you back? I think I'm better than that.
LEADMALE:Jerry, come.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, Jer.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure you think you're better than me.
LEADFEMALE:But when you remember the terrible thing I did to you today, You'll sink to my level like a rock.
LEADMALE:Why wouldn't she get me back after I got her? Am I not good enough to get? Is she trying to make me feel beneath revenge? Maybe ruining your favorite night was her payback.
LEADMALE:No, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't have that kind of imagination.
LEADMALE:She'll do something to get me back, And it will be really lame, And I'll be ready.
LEADMALE:I'm sure you will be, dear.
LEADMALE:I wish we would have rehearsed the act more.
LEADMALE:People didn't get we were supposed to be dead.
