SUPFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:I asked him to do it just like yours.
LEADFEMALE:See how easy it is for the men folk to get along? Yeah, you're a real inspiration.
LEADFEMALE:David, come.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go make dinner.

OTHERMALE:She's blowing all her money on teenage crap.
OTHERMALE:She's not planning for her future at all.
LEADMALE:Honey, it's everything we prayed for.
LEADFEMALE:Move.
SUPMALE:You're acting like a crazed psychopath.
LEADFEMALE:Huh, well the voices in my head disagree.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't stop coming down on this kid, You're gonna drive her right out of the house.
LEADMALE:Now, i'm willing to share the blame on what happened to Becky, But you're flying solo on this one.
OTHERMALE:Mmm, well, all right.
LEADMALE:I guess maybe 'cause i'm so tired I might be willing to admit That there's a slight chance I was wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I know hard it is for you to admit you were tired.
SUPMALE:Darlene? I kind of want to apologize to you For the way I been treating you.
SUPFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:You're apologizing to me? Well, not for your whole life.
OTHERFEMALE:Just for the past couple of weeks.
LEADMALE:Well, it wasn't all your fault.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like to think that I was pretty mean to you too.
LEADMALE:So, I guess we actually approach the end of bitch fest '93.
SUPMALE:Oh, what a time we had.
LEADFEMALE:See? Now that you said you're sorry, don't you feel better? No.
SUPFEMALE:Don't feel better at all.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Don't you just feel a little bit better? No, I don't feel better at all! Well, you should! Well, i'll tell you what, Dan.
SUPMALE:From now on I won't feel anything i'm feeling, okay? I'll just wait for you to tell me what feelings you feel I should be feeling.
LEADMALE:Feel this.
LEADFEMALE:Stop, stop.
SUPFEMALE:There's no need for begging.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready to tell you all about my first day at the garage.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I even took pictures.
LEADFEMALE:This is my desk.
LEADFEMALE:This is my pencil cup empty.
LEADMALE:Here it is filled with pencils.
SUPFEMALE:And look, a chair.
LEADMALE:A job where you get to sit all day.
LEADMALE:That's class.
LEADMALE:Now, that's class.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they had a special on garbage, what can I say? What, no orange peels? They were on the list.
OTHERFEMALE:I was driving around.
LEADFEMALE:The groceries was in the front seat.
SUPMALE:You do the math.
OTHERFEMALE:You went to buy-and-bag, you saw Darlene, And the two of yous lit the torch for bitch fest '94.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:We got along fine.
LEADFEMALE:I just stood there and watched her bag groceries.
SUPFEMALE:Then how do you explain this gutted potato chip bag? Well, I kinda needed that to help me figure out How come i'm being so mean to Darlene lately.
SUPMALE:I think i'm screwing up her life.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you have to, honey.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do it by myself.
SUPMALE:She's vegetatin' here, Dan.
LEADMALE:She hasn't even worked on her comic for two weeks, You know, and that used to be so important to her.
LEADMALE:Well, she got tired of doing her comic.
SUPFEMALE:Now she'll do something else.
LEADFEMALE:Two weeks ago she's dreaming of being a writer, you know? Now her big dream is being a cashier at the buy-and-bag.
LEADFEMALE:What are you trying to say? I think we should let her go to that school.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, i'm serious.
SUPFEMALE:We couldn't give Becky a future, right? So Darlene goes out and gets one, And now why are we trying to take it away from her? We ain't trying to take nothin' away from her.
LEADMALE:She can wait 'til she's 18 to have a future.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, i'm 40, I just found mine.
SUPMALE:Well, that's my whole point, Dan, see? I mean, i'm standing there watching her doing lousy At a crappy job, you know, and being rude to all the customers.
LEADMALE:It just reminded me so much of me.
LEADFEMALE:In 10 years, I don't want her to end up where i'm at.
LEADFEMALE:Where? Where are you? No place special.
LEADMALE:Stuck in Lanford, Illinois, Kinda wondering about maybe I could have done some stuff.
SUPMALE:What kind of stuff? I don't know, like, what if I would have went to college? Or what if I didn't have kids so young? What if you hadn't gotten married? Well, yeah, maybe.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you ever think about that, Dan? No.
SUPFEMALE:I always thought it was the smartest thing I ever did.
LEADFEMALE:You obviously don't agree.
SUPMALE:No, I do agree with you.
SUPFEMALE:It was the smartest thing you ever did, but we're talking about me now.
LEADFEMALE:I never told you you had to stay in Lanford.
LEADFEMALE:That was a choice you made.
LEADMALE:I am not blaming you, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:I chose this life and I love it.
SUPMALE:Except for that no dishwasher thing! But you know, i'm starting to think about some stuff I gave up.
SUPMALE:Everybody gives up stuff.
SUPMALE:Hell, I gave up a lot of stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? Like being single.
OTHERMALE:I wanted to write children's books, Dan, remember? Honey, I built you a whole writing room in the basement, But you never used it.
LEADMALE:There was nothing stopping you from finishing The adventures of Mancini the elephant or Pee Pee the talkin' mouse.
OTHERMALE:His name is Pippet, Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:And I never had time, what with the bike shop and Becky and bein' broke all the time.

OTHERFEMALE:why are you trying to break us up? David, right now, the only thing I want to see Is the back of your head getting smaller and smaller and smaller.
OTHERFEMALE:There are several ways we can accomplish this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's so sweet.
LEADFEMALE:You two are having your first fight, And you rushed all the way up here to show me.
LEADMALE:You know, I just don't get it, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Doing things 'cause a guy says so, huh? Who raised you? She's doing what she wants to do.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't you just stay out of this? David, I would hate to embarrass you in front of your girlfriend By throwing you out of here physically.
LEADMALE:Ah, what the hell.
SUPFEMALE:thanks for not embarrassing me.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, this is not a big deal.
LEADMALE:David and I are just gonna apply again next year.
SUPMALE:Well, what if you apply every year and he never gets in? Why can't you just drop this? 'cause it's too weird.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you could talk you've been whining About getting out of Lanford and what, Now you got a boyfriend, so you're gonna go change your mind? I thought you wanted something better than this.
LEADFEMALE:Better than what? Better than this! Better than this room.
LEADMALE:Better than this whole house! Better than this pillow.
LEADFEMALE:Better than this quilt, okay? Better than this trash can.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, cut it out! I mean, what if I go there and everybody else is, like, way brilliant And I find out I suck, then what happens? So, you mean this whole thing is not even about David? So, you got to tell me, Darlene, Which of the motherly speeches am I supposed to be giving here 'cause i'm totally off track.
SUPMALE:Well, we're through talking.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we are.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I figure if I wash them all in hot water I can fit 'em in one suitcase.
OTHERMALE:Mom, why can't I just live at home like a normal kid? Because as I have told you for your entire life, Darlene, You are not normal.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, you dress funny, you're weird, You're too smart for your own damn good.
LEADMALE:Let's face it, Darlene, you're special, And I think you could be something great.
OTHERMALE:Well, I tried to leave last week.
SUPMALE:I packed my bags, I got in my car.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't do it.
SUPMALE:You cannot be afraid of failure, okay? So what, you get there, you find out you suck.

LEADFEMALE:Well, let me put it to you this way.
SUPFEMALE:You got to go.
LEADMALE:'cause I want you to go.
LEADFEMALE:Because if you don't go, you're gonna regret it.
