LEADFEMALE:Oh, Darlene, he spent the whole night in your room.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, neither am I.

SUPMALE:Really? You can't.
LEADMALE:You mean you can hear us? Last night I had to tell David you were moving furniture.
SUPMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:We're not talking about my sex life.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an adult.
SUPMALE:We're talking about your sex life.
SUPMALE:I don't have a sex life.
LEADFEMALE:But if I did, I wouldn't tell you, 'cause I don't think it's any of your business.
LEADFEMALE:And unlike your other daughter, if I needed birth control, I'd know how to take care of it myself.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need you to hold my hand.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Why won't you just let me do this? Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:This is for you.

LEADMALE:You want to tell me what we're talking about here? I'll tell you later.
SUPMALE:No, let's tell him now.
LEADFEMALE:Mom wants me to go on the pill because Becky had sex.
OTHERMALE:I don't think that'll work.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think that this is the proper time For you to discuss this with your father, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? I have nothing to hide.
LEADFEMALE:David never left last night.
OTHERFEMALE:We stayed up all night long working on the comic book.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.

OTHERMALE:Don't you listen? Yeah, I heard.
OTHERMALE:And I'll be damned If I'm gonna let this happen twice.
SUPMALE:You are not gonna see David again, do you hear me, Darlene? I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:You guys are treating me like I'm Becky.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not Becky.
LEADFEMALE:I don't go to the mall like Becky, I don't do great laundry like Becky, I don't love school like Becky, and I don't sleep with my boyfriend like Becky! So what are you getting at, Becky? What I'm getting at, mother, is I'm stuck here, So I'm paying for how she screwed up.
LEADFEMALE:But if you guys have a problem, you deal with Becky.
LEADMALE:Leave me out of it.
LEADFEMALE:Remember how excited we were when she first learned to talk? Think she's telling the truth? Well, if she went to all the trouble of saying it in front of you, I guess she'd have to be.
LEADMALE:You should have told me, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even know what I can tell you anymore, Dan, And what I can't tell you, 'cause you already got one kid that you won't even talk to.
OTHERMALE:Well, Stuff happens around here, I should know about it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.

LEADFEMALE:No, no, honey.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that hard.
LEADFEMALE:You just shrink the plastic with a hair dryer.
