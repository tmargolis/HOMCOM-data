OTHERMALE:Hey, I promised Mark.
OTHERMALE:And nobody says anything to Roseanne, either.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, now he lies to his wife.
LEADMALE:Where will this end? You got to lie to your wife once in a while.
OTHERFEMALE:Like when they try out new recipes you hate it.
LEADMALE:I Always tell my wife I got a cold And can't taste a thing.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, that's way better than hocking it up into a napkin.
LEADMALE:Dan's right.
OTHERFEMALE:You got to lie occasionally.
LEADMALE:If just once I'd said, "honey, I don't mind You're sleeping with my business partner," I'd still be married.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Bummer.
SUPFEMALE:They lie to us, too.
LEADMALE:Roseanne smashed up my truck And swore it happened while parked at the mall.
OTHERMALE:Did you call her on it? You kidding me? And waste all that guilt? When I mention how good my truck looked, I Get chocolate cake for dessert.
OTHERFEMALE:If I squeeze out a couple of tears, Cool whip.
SUPMALE:Hey, Dan, you say the fire department checked But didn't find anything, right? It was a false alarm.
LEADMALE:Did they check the wires in the walls? Everything.
LEADMALE:How do they know it's the fire alarm? The burglar alarm sounds the same.
SUPMALE:Roseanne The fire department wouldn't know if anything was stolen.
OTHERMALE:They wouldn't notice a burglar Unless the guy was on fire.
SUPMALE:I Checked.
LEADMALE:Nothing's missing.
OTHERFEMALE:No flaming burglars.
SUPMALE:What about the safe? It's all there-Your grandmother's ring, your good watch, The earrings you never wear Because I never take you anyplace nice enough.
LEADMALE:All there.
SUPMALE:What about the gold card? What gold card? I knew it.
OTHERMALE:They stole the gold card! We don't have a gold card.
OTHERMALE:Not now.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? I got a gold card in the mail.
OTHERFEMALE:It has a $5,000 limit.
OTHERMALE:What fish-brained company gave us a gold card? Well, they asked for your annual income And your social security number.
LEADMALE:Maybe I switched them.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't see it.
LEADFEMALE:It's flat.
LEADMALE:It could've been up against the wall.
LEADMALE:It was in a great big white envelope.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll look for it in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:How can we sleep If somebody's charging us into the poorhouse? They can't buy anything.
SUPMALE:It's 2 a.
LEADMALE:m.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's closed.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, here.
LEADFEMALE:But the burglar could charge tickets And fly to where something is open.
OTHERFEMALE:In some parts of the world, it's yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:We could be broke before it's now.
LEADMALE:How many beers did you have down at the lobo? Go check on that card.
LEADMALE:Honey I won't sleep till you get it.
SUPMALE:Neither will you.
LEADMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:k.
LEADMALE:, o.

LEADFEMALE:k.
OTHERFEMALE:? Thank you, honey.
OTHERMALE:Lie to me, will you? hey.
LEADMALE:hey, Mark.
LEADMALE:How's it going? Please stop, will you? How's your hand? Hurts like hell, man.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see if we can keep it wet and dirty.
LEADMALE:Maybe we can get it infected.
LEADMALE:You didn't tell Becky about anything, did you? No, I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:What about, you know, the other one? I didn't tell my wife for which I paid dearly, Much as you will today.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I Owe you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you do.
SUPMALE:I mean it.
SUPFEMALE:I really do care about Becky.
SUPFEMALE:She's real good for me, you know? If she found out about last night, She'd never see me again.
LEADFEMALE:You saved my butt.
SUPFEMALE:You're a real friend.
LEADMALE:Let me correct a few points.
LEADMALE:I am Becky's father, By definition, therefore, not your friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Secondly, I'm your boss, Which still makes me not your friend.
LEADFEMALE:In my official capacity as not your friend, Here's how it'll be-I Ever catch you under the influence again, Not only are you finished with Becky, You're out of a job.
LEADFEMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:k.
SUPMALE:One more thing--I paid for those stitches.
SUPMALE:I'll pay you back.
SUPMALE:Yes, but until then, I own them.
SUPMALE:I can rip them out anytime I want.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You bring me any ice cream? No.
SUPMALE:Then go away.
SUPMALE:I got gum.
LEADFEMALE:Becky's letting Mark take her to the movies.
SUPFEMALE:When did this happen? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Does it even matter? You just know they're going to get back together, And that is just sickening.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe Dan would even let him in the house After catching him down at the lobo like that.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? Oh, man! This is why Dan is always ticked off at me.
SUPFEMALE:Spill it.
SUPFEMALE:One of the drivers I work with was there.
SUPFEMALE:He said Mark got drunk And put his hand through the jukebox.
SUPFEMALE:Dan had to smooth everything over.
LEADMALE:So that's what's going on.
OTHERMALE:I knew I was busting Dan's chops for something.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't know what.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? It was such an obvious lie.
LEADMALE:I mean, that alarm never went off.
SUPFEMALE:How do you know? Because I haven't paid the alarm company For three months.
LEADMALE:Just don't tell Dan you heard it from me.
OTHERMALE:I won't even tell him that I know.
SUPFEMALE:we're leaving, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Be home early.
SUPMALE:We'll see.
LEADMALE:You're just going to let her go? What if he's been drinking? You're going to trust him? I don't trust him, but I trust Dan.
SUPFEMALE:He loves Becky, too.
LEADFEMALE:If he's letting her go, He must have some stupid reason.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Why, Jackie, what a surprise! How was work, sweetheart? Pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:So you're totally letting him off the hook After lying to you? Oh, Jackie, I wish I could.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dan? Yes? Becky and Mark are dating again.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think of that? Well, we've just got to hope Mark will turn over a new leaf.
LEADFEMALE:How'd he hurt his hand? He, uh, caught it down at the shop On a machine.
SUPMALE:Is it bad? Couple stitches.
LEADMALE:Well, he could sue us, Dan.
LEADMALE:He won't sue us.
LEADFEMALE:What if the thing with Becky turns sour again And he decides he hates us? We're insured.
OTHERMALE:Oh, really? Where's the policy? At the shop.
OTHERMALE:Dan I just got here.
SUPMALE:I'm tired.
SUPFEMALE:I really, really, really want to know, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADMALE:I'll go down to the shop In my beat-up truck.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that reminds me.
SUPMALE:I got to get some cool whip.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, mom wants you to pick up some cool whip.
SUPMALE:Why don't you do it? I'm doing my homework.
LEADFEMALE:That's a lame excuse, Becky.
LEADMALE:Only from you, Darlene.
SUPMALE:She left some money in her purse.
LEADMALE:I don't believe I have to get one thing Just because mom forgot it when she went shopping.
SUPMALE:I'm so sick of running these little crappy errands.
LEADFEMALE:Someday I'll walk out that door and never come back And today's the day!
LEADMALE:
