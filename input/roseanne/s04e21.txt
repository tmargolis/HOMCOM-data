LEADFEMALE:Oh, jeez.
LEADMALE:Colonel klink is going to the russian front For this wacky foul-up.
SUPMALE:You think they'd figure out hogan could hear their secret plans After, like, a thousand episodes.
OTHERMALE:Forget that.

LEADFEMALE:David, we're, like, really good friends.
LEADFEMALE:So? So, I don't think you should cop a cheap feel from a friend.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, my hand's way out of copping range here, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Move it.
SUPMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:Why not.
OTHERMALE:The whole school thinks we're boyfriend and girlfriend.
SUPMALE:So what? I just I put my arm around you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and what was next? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:It took me three weeks to get to that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gross.
LEADFEMALE:You've been planning this? This is the lowest moment of my entire life.
OTHERMALE:Thanks for being a part of it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:You caught me off guard.
LEADMALE:I don't know if I see you that way.
SUPFEMALE:Becky! The next time you let your car hog up the driveway like that, I'm getting it towed to indianapolis! Oh, well, it's not that important.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure she heard you anyway, dear.
SUPMALE:Hey, david.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You know you're out of-Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I do.
LEADMALE:Yeah, so, just 'cause Rodbell's is missing some stuff, Everybody has to take some stupid lie detector test.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't take it.
SUPFEMALE:They can't fire you if you refuse.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, they can.
SUPMALE:They just wouldn't say that that was why.
LEADMALE:They'd say it was 'cause I was always late, Or rude to the customers, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:They'd find some tiny little thing.
SUPMALE:What kind of stuff got stolen? They didn't even tell us.
LEADFEMALE:You have nothing to worry about.
OTHERFEMALE:That's just the point.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't take anything.
SUPFEMALE:I really resent Rodbell's treating me Like I'm some common criminal.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to the big house, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here you go, walter.
LEADMALE:It's unbelievable, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:I called the a.
OTHERMALE:c.
SUPFEMALE:l.
LEADFEMALE:u.
LEADFEMALE:, And they told me I cannot be forced To take a lie detector test.
LEADFEMALE:And the minute I'm fired, I should call them.
LEADMALE:What did you swipe, walter? Nothing, Roseanne, but that doesn't mean I'm not guilty.
OTHERMALE:A cow died for this burger.
LEADFEMALE:A tree died for this napkin.
SUPMALE:I Killed a cow and a tree on my lunch hour.
SUPFEMALE:Am I guilty of murder? I would have to say yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not just me, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:W-w-we're all guilty! He's lucky.
LEADMALE:He can plead insanity.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't know how this happened, But suddenly, ladies, we are overstocked With half-empty jars of mustard and mayonnaise.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody have anything to say? Uh All right.
LEADMALE:Uh Leon, I took some things home from the restaurant.
SUPMALE:I know it's illegal, and I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I brought them back.
LEADMALE:Bonnie, don't you think I notice That you leave here lumpier than when you come in? Now, I have always tried to look the other way When you've taken condiments, But how can I do that If you keep bringing them back? I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I figured if I brought them back, Then when they ask me if I stole anything, I could just say I borrowed them.
SUPFEMALE:You're not gonna bust her, are you, Leon? Of course not.
LEADMALE:Then could you help me? I got a vat of steak sauce in my car.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, I hate to burst your bubble, But your little plan isn't going to work.
SUPMALE:You see, once you believe That you've stolen something, It'll show up on the polygraph.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but like she said, We were just borrowing it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you borrowed a full jar, And when you brought it back, It was half-empty.
SUPFEMALE:Now, don't you believe that that was stealing? Well, I do now, thanks to you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, way to go, Leon.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You got a few minutes? Yeah, sure.
SUPMALE:My break doesn't start for a half-hour.

LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:, well Do want some pie or something? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Isn't that Darlene's little boyfriend? Darlene doesn't have a boyfriend.
SUPMALE:And yes.

LEADMALE:Mark said you were always trashing on him to Becky And that's why she broke up with him.
SUPMALE:Come on, david.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it.
OTHERMALE:I'm not like my brother.
OTHERMALE:I think Mark is the biggest jerk on the planet.
LEADMALE:You were right to try to keep him away from Becky.
SUPMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:You're sucking up.
LEADMALE:That's better.
SUPFEMALE:So I guess I'm just asking you Not to sink me with Darlene.
LEADMALE:So I'm just supposed to forget About what happened last night, is that it? Nothing happened.
LEADMALE:I put my arm around her, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:What did she tell you? I really can't tell you that, david.
SUPMALE:Uh But I will tell you this-Darlene is a lot like I was.
LEADFEMALE:When I first starting dating mr.

OTHERFEMALE:Got it? Yeah, I got it.
LEADMALE:Bring on the lie detector.
LEADMALE:I don't know, he's still Mark's brother.
LEADFEMALE:Totally different kid, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Mark is obnoxious, he's rude, He's going nowhere, And he's too old for Becky.
LEADFEMALE:On the other hand, David likes me.
LEADMALE:Where's the mustard? I Took it back to Rodbell's.
LEADFEMALE:What about the salami? I told you, Dan, I took everything back.
LEADFEMALE:But the salamI was ours.
SUPFEMALE:I Panicked! Damn.
LEADFEMALE:I've been looking forward to that salami ever since dinner.
LEADMALE:Dad? You want to go shoot some hoops? You mean your dad? A quick game.

LEADMALE:So it would always be on your mind? So you couldn't just, like, hang out with her? This about you and david? Let's just say I'm curious And leave it at that.
LEADFEMALE:So? Well, listen, Darlene What I would do or what mr.
