SUPMALE:Was the baby up again all night, Crystal? Oh, yeah, but I'm not complaining.
SUPMALE:I'm seeing all kinds of things you'd never see if you were getting any sleep at all.
LEADFEMALE:Little Ed and I watch the sun rise and set.
SUPMALE:Rise and set.
SUPMALE:And did you know the big valley comes on at 5:00 in the morning? And again at 6:30? Oh, come here, little Ed.
LEADMALE:Come see your auntie-sister-in-law--whatever-Roseanne While mommy has her little breakdown.
LEADMALE:What is wrong with him? Nothing wrong with him, Crystal, he's just a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why won't he sleep? I've tried everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Even the washing machine.
SUPFEMALE:You put him in the washing machine? No, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You put him in his little baby seat on the washer, and the vibrations are supposed to soothe him to sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:When you were a baby, we couldn't afford a washing machine, so I took you down to the river and beat you against a rock.
LEADMALE:Why pick on me? Did I take the last doughnut or something? Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, Becky.
LEADMALE:You want some breakfast? I was running over to return Jackie's top.

LEADFEMALE:Which earrings? I think they're yours.
LEADMALE:Come up and see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ok.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:What's she going to go griping to aunt Jackie about? No, I'm good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, too much coffee gives you the shakes, And then you cut yourself shaving.
LEADMALE:Ohwhat now? I think he's hungry.
OTHERMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Will you hold him for a second? Oh, gimme.

SUPFEMALE:But I won't explode at her.
SUPFEMALE:Neither will you.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to act like nothing's goin' on? Yeah.
LEADMALE:If we go crazy with this, She's not going to trust me with anything.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:He's just going to walk in here All innocent, like nothing happened.
LEADMALE:Well, that's the way you played it with my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god.

OTHERMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Addison? Any diabetes in our family? No.
LEADMALE:Ulcers? No.
LEADMALE:History of migraine? No.
SUPMALE:This is my first one.
LEADFEMALE:I wish they'd just give me the pills instead of this whole exam thing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry, Becky.
LEADFEMALE:Just keep your socks on.
OTHERMALE:There's a good look-A paper dress and socks.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not the prom, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:If she keeps her socks on, Her feet will slip out of the stirrups.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, Jackie, But socks will keep her feet warm in the stirrups.
OTHERMALE:But then she's not going to have any traction.
LEADFEMALE:Traction's the key.
LEADMALE:Becky Conner? Oh, thank god.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey! Go get 'em.
LEADMALE:Go get 'em? I want to say all this stuff Like, "stop, you're too young," But the only thing I talk about is socks.

LEADMALE:I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:I drive her down here.
SUPFEMALE:I make the appointment.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Becky's very, very lucky.
LEADFEMALE:What are people going to say, Jackie? Who's going to know? She's going to tell all her friends, Then they'll tell their moms, "Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner lets Becky have sex.
SUPFEMALE:" Well, Roseanne Do other people go through this, Or am I the only insane mother in the world? I wish our mom had been a little more insane.
SUPMALE:I took some stupid chances When I was a kid, you know.
LEADMALE:Mmm What? She's all grown-up, Jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:She doesn't need me anymore.

SUPMALE:I've thought about this.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I--I just wanted to bring it up.
