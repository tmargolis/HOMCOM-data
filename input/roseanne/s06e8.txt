LEADMALE:Motor seminars are always in Elgin.
LEADMALE:What were you thinking? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Elgin, Dekalb, I See, it was originally scheduled for Dekalb, And then they moved it to Elgin.
LEADMALE:They moved it to Elgin from Dekalb.

SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Dan and I were planning a big surprise party For your birthday last month.
LEADMALE:I'm so bad at this.
SUPMALE:Look, Rosie.

OTHERFEMALE:"been with"? I had lunch with Phyllis.
SUPMALE:And? And you lied about it badly.
SUPFEMALE:And you came home and had sex with Roseanne.
SUPMALE:How do you think that made her feel? Pretty damn happy judging from this pudding.
SUPMALE:No, it was humiliating.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you were thinking about Phyllis While you were having sex with Roseanne.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, that is just completely and totally not true! So there's no connection at all Between you having lunch with Phyllis today And having sex with Roseanne? For your information, Jackie, I have had sex with Roseanne many times Without having lunch with Phyllis, So your whole theory goes right out the window.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I just got one question.
LEADFEMALE:If you're completely innocent, you did nothing wrong, Why do you think your wife just stormed out that door? Why are you here? You don't live here.
LEADMALE:You're not married to anyone in this house.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you go out that door, Get a life of your own? Then you can screw that up instead of messing with mine! You want to know how innocent I am? I could have.
SUPMALE:Could have what? She wanted me, Jackie.
OTHERMALE:How do you know that? Men know.
SUPFEMALE:She did the eyelash thing.
OTHERFEMALE:She did the hip thing.
SUPFEMALE:She did all the things.
LEADMALE:I could have had her right then and there, But I never even thought about it! You could have "had her.
LEADFEMALE:" The Ramada was right next door.
OTHERFEMALE:The vacancy sign was on.
SUPMALE:And if I was a different kind of guy, I could have had lunch, Phyllis, a quick shower, And been back at work by 2:00.
SUPMALE:Well, it's a good thing you never thought about it! that's how the weather is shaping up today.
SUPFEMALE:Now back to Charles in New York.
