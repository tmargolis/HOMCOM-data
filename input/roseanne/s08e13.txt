LEADFEMALE:You're right, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:So sorry your father and this house aren't up to your standards.
LEADMALE:I wish we could've done better for you.
LEADMALE:i'm just saying-no, I know what you're saying.

OTHERFEMALE:There isn't gonna be any more yelling.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, I'm really glad that you're going to school And, you know, getting an education Like I never got because I got all lost in that love-and-peace crap Of the '60s.
LEADFEMALE:And then 10 years later, I realized Should have listened to all those women who said: Learn how to support yourself or you're gonna be screwed.
SUPMALE:Well, mom, that is exactly what i'm trying to do.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:So maybe i'm a little jealous of you Because of all the stuff that I had to do In order for you to get there.
LEADFEMALE:Like working really hard in beauty salons, Restaurants and factories Is pretty mind-numbing, you know? Especially if you have to stay hammered the whole time.
LEADMALE:Tell me about it.
LEADMALE:It's how I got through puberty.
LEADFEMALE:But, the good part is That I was able to give my kids better than I had.
LEADMALE:And you're gonna be able to do amazing things for your kids.
SUPFEMALE:Every parent tries to improve things at least 50% for their kids.
SUPFEMALE:And if they can do that, then they're a total success.
SUPMALE:A conservative estimate.
OTHERFEMALE:Just by walking erect I improved it 30.
SUPMALE:But you know This college thing is really hard for me too.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, i'm surrounded by all these rich kids That don't have to bust their ass Because if they fail their daddy's there to bail 'em out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, your daddy can't bail you out.
OTHERMALE:My daddy couldn't bail me out, you know? But stuff like that, it just ends up making us stronger, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you turned down a great job like that! Well, I told you, I just want to finish school, all right? And besides, it's in advertising.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think I want to devote the rest of my life To coming up with the next "i'm cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
SUPFEMALE:" okay, hold it.
LEADFEMALE:I respect you for being all anti-corporate And burning the flag and bla bla bla bla bla, Because, you know, that's the way I was in the '60s.
OTHERFEMALE:So i'm kind of glad that some of my ideals made it to my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:But number two, this is the '90s And you can't pay your rent with that kind of thinking.
OTHERMALE:And number three, you are so out of your mind If you think you're ever gonna top anything Like "i'm cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
SUPFEMALE:" Okay.
OTHERMALE:But you're all over the map here.
SUPFEMALE:Do you respect my ideals for turning down the job Or do you think i'm stupid for turning down the job? Well, I really don't know what I think, Darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, this is new territory for us.
LEADMALE:No conner's ever turned down a job Ever.
LEADFEMALE:It's kinda like the same reason Drowning people don't flip off the lifeguard.
LEADFEMALE:I'm still a conner.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but, man! $30,000! I mean, the mayor of Lanford himself Doesn't even make that much and he works two jobs.
SUPMALE:It's like, if you can make that kind of money Then, you know You could be, like, one of them.
LEADFEMALE:Who's them? Them! The ones that ain't us.
OTHERFEMALE:So now when you come home making fun of our family And our house and everything, it just sounds Pretty weird to me and your dad.
LEADMALE:You know, it's like you're one of them And you're putting us down.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Got it.
SUPFEMALE:So What type of helper will we be dining on tonight? Well, we happen to be out of helper tonight.

LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't you think it's cool that one of our kids Might actually make it? Yeah, wow.
OTHERMALE:I mean, she still needs us, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Or, at least she still needs that 100 bucks.
SUPMALE:So why don't you go up there and give it to her? And that's supposed to make me feel like The big provider? Little daughter needs her big daddy? be right back.
SUPFEMALE:hey! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:We did a really good job With this one, didn't we? Yeah, we did.
SUPMALE:Man, it just looks like the conner luck Is starting to change.
LEADMALE:Don't ask.
LEADMALE:There's the little creep.
LEADFEMALE:Look, he's polishing his trap.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Becky, we agreed I'd talk to him.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on? d.j. , it's come to our attention That you seem to think That certain material possessions May help you succeed in affairs of the heart.
LEADMALE:That, dear d.j. , is folly.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:She means you don't buy a trombone So you can hit on some poor unsuspecting tuba girl! Oh, that.
SUPMALE:What's wrong with it? Look, you little jerk, If you have no more respect for women than that I'm gonna tie you to the car-Okay, Becky, Becky! Becky! Becky! Now, d.j. , listen to me! Listen.
LEADMALE:First of all, That-that's just not a right thing to do.
LEADMALE:And second of all, it's just not going to work.
