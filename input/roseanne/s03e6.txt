LEADFEMALE:What if my manly abilities aren't really mine? What if it's the mattress? I thought it was the mattress.
SUPFEMALE:What if I can't wow you in a new bed? You didn't have no trouble when we brought home that new kitchen table.

LEADMALE:Does his father bowl? Oh, god.
LEADMALE:Not a league man, eh? Perhaps we've run into them while dining at Spaghetti Bucket.
SUPMALE:I don't recall, lovey.
LEADMALE:Maybe they're not the all-you-can-eat type.
LEADMALE:Oh, god, Dan.
LEADMALE:You don't think they're nouveau poor.
LEADMALE:Please let me go.
SUPFEMALE:It's your first date.

SUPMALE:He'll think I'm ditching him.
LEADMALE:Let him come up and find out.
LEADMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:No, Darlene, no.

LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Can I help you with something? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:How about a couple of margaritas? No salt.
LEADMALE:We're just looking.

LEADMALE:Honey, get me up.
LEADFEMALE:Oopsy-daisy.
SUPMALE:Ahh.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
OTHERMALE:A bed like my mom wanted us to get.
LEADMALE:Oh, look at this.
OTHERFEMALE:That's twice as big as the one we got.
LEADMALE:Let's pretend we're rich, and we actually have a room big enough for this bed to fit in.
SUPFEMALE:And we're waking up to the smell of fresh coffee and croissants that our sexy French maid Ho ho ho ho.
LEADFEMALE:Pierre has made for us.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dan.
SUPMALE:You remember the first time you said you loved me on our old bed? No.
LEADFEMALE:Neither do I.
SUPFEMALE:But I know I did.
LEADMALE:And I still do.
LEADMALE:Boy, are you whipped.
LEADFEMALE:Should I get the hose? No, but you can dim the lights.
SUPFEMALE:We're reminiscing.
OTHERMALE:What a nice word for it.
SUPMALE:I see you've decided on a king-size.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:We'll take that double.
OTHERFEMALE:And for the lady? I'll just, uh, go write it up then.
LEADMALE:Way to defend my honor there, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:It was a shot at me, dear.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Good one.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Timmy.
SUPMALE:A toast.
LEADFEMALE:A toast.
SUPMALE:To our old bed.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Well What was once the cradle of our love is now landfill.
LEADMALE:That was beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Who snaked my beer? Give me that.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that Becky's boyfriend? What the hell's he doing in here? He's drinking.
OTHERMALE:Where are you going? To say hello.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:You'll get mad and try to punch him.
LEADMALE:Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:Just hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, hey.
LEADMALE:Remember us? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:And you? I'm cool.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you in here? We're going to have another one of your little chats? Chat this! Honey.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey.
OTHERMALE:Uh, we were, uh, just wondering how did you get in here? Through the door.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I mean, uh, you're only 18, right? I got a piece of paper that says I'm 21.
SUPFEMALE:How old are you when you're dating Becky? Depends on where we're going.
SUPMALE:I'll ask you again, and remember you're talking to the girl's father.
LEADMALE:You're not going to touch me.
SUPMALE:Touch him, Dan.
LEADMALE:Touch him.
SUPMALE:Rosey.
LEADMALE:All right, Mark.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the deal.
LEADMALE:I don't want you hanging around my daughter anymore.
LEADMALE:You think you can stop me from seeing Becky? I can stop you from seeing tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:If Becky wants to see me, she'll see me.
SUPMALE:I want to go over to his house and beat the hell out of his mother.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Darlene! Come on, Darlene.
LEADMALE:Let me out! Let me out.
OTHERMALE:I won't do it anymore! I won't do it anymore.
SUPMALE:Please! Please.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom? Is that you? Darlene, what is that little boy still doing up? Mom! We were having so much fun, I lost track of time.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to see you two kids getting along.
LEADMALE:Dad! Is that you? d.j. , go to bed now.
LEADMALE:But, mom! Now.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go, squirt.
LEADMALE:Do it again, and it's the dryer.
LEADMALE:Becky.
LEADFEMALE:Becky.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, mom.
SUPMALE:Good night, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't doing it.
LEADMALE:So, what I do this time? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Amazing, isn't it? We saw Mark tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Where? Over at the Lobo drinking.
LEADFEMALE:This may come as a shock, but he's got a fake ID.
LEADFEMALE:We want you two to stay away from each other.
LEADMALE:Now, come kiss mommy good night.
LEADMALE:I just can't believe this.
LEADMALE:Believe it.
OTHERMALE:Why? I don't go out drinking with him.
SUPFEMALE:You never will.
SUPFEMALE:It's so typical of you to butt in where it's none of your business.
LEADMALE:Well, at least we didn't let you down.
OTHERFEMALE:You are our business.
LEADFEMALE:Mark is the greatest guy I've ever dated! You don't like him, and you're just taking it out on me! I remember a time when she was so sweet and innocent and loving.
SUPMALE:I remember that, too.
OTHERMALE:I believe it was a Thursday.
SUPFEMALE:Listen to this one.
SUPMALE:"I sometimes get tiny red pimples on my buttocks "in the summer.
OTHERFEMALE:What can I do about them?" That's gross.
SUPMALE:I hope you didn't sign your name this time.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I signed your name.
OTHERMALE:What did it say to do? Use a healing facial mask.
SUPMALE:Ok, I'm going to pick up that bed before the store closes.
OTHERMALE:Hey, honey.
LEADMALE:On your way back, pick us up two healing facial masks For our butts.
LEADMALE:For our butts.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, I won't be in for dinner.
LEADMALE:I'm going over Judy's.
LEADMALE:Get a ride from your dad.
SUPFEMALE:That's ok.
LEADFEMALE:I can walk.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:What are you guys going to do? Probably just going to the movies.
LEADMALE:There's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe me and Jackie will go see something.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we don't really know if we're going to the movies.
LEADMALE:Call me when you're at Judy's and let us know either way.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You know what? I forgot my wallet.
SUPFEMALE:Well, there it is.
LEADFEMALE:She's going to see Mark.
SUPFEMALE:The old "going over to my girlfriend's house" routine.
LEADMALE:She's probably up there right now working on plan B.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's a really dumb story, like "Judy's parents are Amish and don't have a phone.
SUPMALE:" I was only 11.
LEADMALE:Mom, me and Judy are just going to a party, ok? Ok.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Uh Is Mark going to be at this party? Mom, you told me never to see him again.
LEADFEMALE:Is that yes or no? No.
OTHERMALE:Where's the party? I'm not sure.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call you later and give you the number.
SUPFEMALE:We could drive you over there.
LEADMALE:We're bored.
SUPMALE:We may not go to this party.
LEADFEMALE:We'll probably just invite some girls over to Judy's.
LEADFEMALE:And she goes for the save.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Oh, Becky.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Um Judy's phone number's up there on the bulletin board, right? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Have fun.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Well There she goes.
SUPFEMALE:Are you worried? Of course I'm worried.
LEADMALE:You want to talk about it? What's to talk about? She's out with someone we hate, going god knows where and doing god knows what.
LEADFEMALE:Now I feel like mom felt when she had to watch you completely destroy your life.
OTHERFEMALE:You having fun there, Dan? Just breaking her in.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's time to call Judy again.
SUPMALE:Well, it's been 15 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Judy.
OTHERMALE:It's Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Last time I called, I forgot to ask Becky something.
LEADMALE:She's in the bathroom again? Well, is she sick? Maybe we should pick her up.
SUPMALE:Ok, I'll call back later then.
LEADMALE:Becky's sick? No.
LEADMALE:She's with Mark.
LEADFEMALE:What? We told her she couldn't see him again.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why she lied about being at Judy's.
OTHERMALE:You let her go? I had to so I could catch her.
LEADMALE:I won't sit here while she's out with that punk.
OTHERMALE:I call Judy every 15 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Judy calls Becky wherever she is.
LEADMALE:Then Becky calls me.
LEADFEMALE:And the point of that is? To completely ruin Becky's evening.
OTHERMALE:See? And to make sure that she's all right.
SUPFEMALE:Hiya, Becky.
LEADMALE:You like pork chops, don't you? Ok then.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:She's fine.
LEADMALE:Judy, when you finally do hear from her, tell her to get her butt home.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Let her live with him.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it, Judy.
LEADMALE:You're never leaving this house again.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? So How was your evening? Ok, you know I wasn't at Judy's.
LEADMALE:Oh? I was at Monica's.
LEADFEMALE:I know you hate her, so I asked Judy to cover.
LEADMALE:That's one.
LEADMALE:Where were you? I told you I was at Monica's.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Her parents weren't home.
OTHERMALE:I knew you guys would be mad.
LEADMALE:That's two.
LEADMALE:Two what? Two weeks grounded.
LEADMALE:You want three, or do we hear "Mark"? You lied, and that won't happen ever again.
SUPFEMALE:You're never seeing Mark again.
SUPFEMALE:I mean it, Becky! I know.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:Thanks to my mother, who made me call her every 15 minutes, he'll probably never want to see me again anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Probably? And what if he probably does? I'm never going to see him again.
LEADFEMALE:Ok? Ever.
LEADFEMALE:You put us through a lot of crap tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Can I go now? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Get upstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:You did good.
OTHERMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:I did.
LEADMALE:You knew exactly where she was going to be.
LEADMALE:And you stayed one step ahead of her.
SUPFEMALE:Was there ever any doubt, Dan? I'm the best.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, next time, I'm going to have to be even better.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:Ahh.
OTHERMALE:Not too hard? Not too soft? Just right.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, Dan.
SUPMALE:Just because Becky's not going to see Mark anymore doesn't mean that she's ever going to date somebody that we approve of.
LEADFEMALE:The next guy could be, like, an ax murderer.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:Let me out.
OTHERMALE:I promise I won't see Becky again.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no air in here.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:
