LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, have you seen this book? This is everything you need to know about your baby.
SUPMALE:I don't need a book, I watch kathy lee.
SUPFEMALE:All I want is a book that'll teach my kid To kick her cody's ass.
LEADFEMALE:Don't make fun of it.
SUPFEMALE:There's a lot of really useful information in here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, yeah.
LEADMALE:Here, let me pick out a page.
SUPMALE:I'll point to something, Ask me a question and see if I don't already know it.
SUPMALE:oh.
LEADFEMALE:what? Say it.
LEADFEMALE:Well Are you preparing for lactation By toughening your nipples? Yes, I am.
LEADMALE:I'm using them to grate cheese.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, there's something I need to tell you, But before I do, I just want you to bear in mind That calmer heads will prevail.
LEADMALE:what is it? the diner's going down.
SUPMALE:We are going out of business.
SUPMALE:We're going to lose everything-All of our money, our future-we're dead.
OTHERFEMALE:We are dead.
LEADMALE:We are dead.
OTHERMALE:That restaurant across the street is opening tomorrow, And i'm telling you, I peeked in the window today, it is spectacular.
LEADFEMALE:The competition is going to kill us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, every time somebody takes over that restaurant It's more pathetic.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember when it was "french ed's"? Roseanne Take a look at this ad.
SUPFEMALE:These people have money.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, a full page? This looks like a really nice place.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, you should put an ad in the paper.
LEADMALE:Save the advice, David, and just keep sitting there And trying to grow that chia goatee.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne, I am really worried.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about the restaurant.
SUPMALE:We're gonna be fine.
LEADMALE:What if we're not? Then what are we gonna do? Then we'll just dust off the old g-string And tap dance our way back into america's heart.
LEADFEMALE:Now that's a grand opening.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that crowd.
LEADFEMALE:I think you guys are forgetting That our grand opening was pretty cool too.
SUPMALE:Guessing how many beans were in d.j. 's nose? It was only disgusting.
SUPMALE:Hey, people could not believe That he could get 12 in there.
LEADFEMALE:That saved us a chevy cavalier.
LEADMALE:Okay, now who's that over there signing autographs? is that some celebrity? oh my god, oh my god, Oh my-oh my-that is-that's Tv's schneider from "one day at a time.
SUPMALE:" With the jeans, the tool belt, The rolled-up sleeves-It all still works for him.
LEADFEMALE:i'm back from across the street.
LEADMALE:good.
LEADMALE:Give us the report.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you're not gonna believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Did you know that schneider directed The series finale of "one day at a time"? Remember that scene when julie tells barbara She'll always be there for her? I cried.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy, you were sent over there to spy, And apparently your cover as a moron Was flawless.
SUPMALE:But what was really cool was I thought the guy was dead, but he wasn't.
LEADMALE:Anyway The restaurant is really nice.
OTHERMALE:They stay open till midnight, And they have a really great salad bar.
OTHERMALE:A salad bar? Obviously they're not from around here.
LEADFEMALE:This is a loose meat kind of a town.
LEADFEMALE:We are not some california tofu-eating Nordictracking freaks that wanna live past 50.
OTHERFEMALE:They also have a clean kitchen, Napkins on the table, And this weird sign in the bathroom that says, "all employees must wash their hands.
LEADMALE:" I'm not making this up.
LEADFEMALE:I bet they don't reuse their straws.
SUPFEMALE:I am telling you This is not another french ed's.
LEADFEMALE:These people have it together.
SUPMALE:Wake up! We do not have to worry about losing our customers.
SUPMALE:Our customers have to come back.
SUPFEMALE:They need the salt.
LEADFEMALE:I brought a sample of the food.
LEADFEMALE:Schneider was giving this away.
LEADFEMALE:God, he is so nice.
LEADFEMALE:They call this their western skillet sandwich.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Western skillet sandwich, my ass.
LEADMALE:That is loose meat.
LEADFEMALE:Those bastards stole our sandwich.
LEADMALE:god, it's delicious.
SUPFEMALE:And I heard people saying Theirs was less greasy than ours.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well good, then we don't have anything to worry about.
LEADMALE:No, they like it that way.
SUPFEMALE:They think less grease is better.
LEADMALE:What? Why? Oh my god, that's schneider.
OTHERMALE:Don't be taken in by the hollywood glitz, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want, glamour boy? Just a cup of coffee, lovely lady.
SUPFEMALE:I'm trying to get away from the maddening crowd.
SUPFEMALE:You're open, right? Look, schneider Under different circumstances, You and I, well, we might have been friends.
SUPFEMALE:But you're with the enemy now, And i'm gonna have to ask you to leave, As much as I have enjoyed your performances On television, and probably film.
OTHERFEMALE:just wanted a cup of coffee.
LEADFEMALE:and you probably wanted to get it for free, Just because you're some big celebrity, right? Well, let me tell you something, pal, This is not wolfman puck's.
LEADFEMALE:This is the Lanford lunch box And hollywood types are not welcome here.
LEADMALE:Not you, not streisand, Not even the great don knotts.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to take this.
SUPMALE:I've got "hollywood squares.
LEADFEMALE:" Roseanne You realize what you just did? You just kicked out schneider.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you think I don't know what I did, Jackie? Do you think that doesn't kill me? Do you think that doesn't tear my heart out? But, a war was started here today, And we didn't fire the first shot.
LEADMALE:This is so good.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, I know you want to compete with that restaurant, But you can't just have me draw little red hearts Next to the chili cheese fries and call it the light-and-healthy menu.
SUPFEMALE:You're right, so why not draw a picture Of a cancer-riddled colon? That'll draw 'em in.
SUPMALE:Who's the strange yet voluptuous woman hanging out in my kitchen? Hi, Dan.
LEADMALE:Oddly, she knows my name.
LEADFEMALE:I know, i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I've been spending a lot of time at the diner, But i'm gonna make it up to you.
LEADMALE:there, done.
OTHERFEMALE:Reenergized by his wife's affection, the husband goes out To once again confront a hostile world.
SUPMALE:Okay, mom, i'm ready to go kick butt at the other people's restaurant.
LEADMALE:Is it really run by nazis? Yes, son, it is.
OTHERMALE:And if it wasn't for them, That whole lot would be a baseball field For kids like you.
SUPMALE:You know your line? "no, there's glass in the salad.
SUPMALE:Now don't use any more of those blood capsules, Or you'll have to bite down on real glass.
SUPMALE:Okay.

LEADMALE:it's cute the way you made them dance.
SUPFEMALE:They're in a frying pan.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, look, i'll make a deal with you.
SUPMALE:If you calm down until after the baby's born, I'll let you shoot out tires from the porch.

LEADFEMALE:You feel like i'm neglecting you.
SUPMALE:Sort of.
OTHERFEMALE:Well I didn't forget about your dinner, okay? I brought you a whole bunch of sandwiches from the diner, And guess what, they're healthy now.
LEADMALE:Show him the menu, David.
LEADMALE:Why don't I just get a job with the tobacco lobby? Okay, Dan, here you go.
LEADMALE:Eat up.
SUPMALE:'cause you didn't come by for lunch today, so you must be starving.
LEADMALE:Actually, i'm still kind of full from breakfast.
LEADMALE:Yeah, how could that be? You only had a handful of franken berry and a kraft single.
SUPFEMALE:I got something from the vending machines at work.
LEADMALE:Man, them peanut-butter-and-cracker things are filling.
LEADFEMALE:I ate them all day long.

SUPMALE:Look, lipstick on my collar.
LEADMALE:That's ketchup.

OTHERMALE:You're gonna make this up to me, Dan conner.
LEADMALE:You and all your buddies from that garage Are going over to that restaurant, you're sitting by the salad bar And you're gonna french kiss all through lunch.
LEADFEMALE:If you want to compete with these people, Why don't you just offer good food at reasonable prices? What, and stoop to their level? Never.
LEADMALE:You need professional help that I just can't afford.
SUPFEMALE:You know, they can come after me, And they can come after my business, But, by god, when they come after my family, That is personal.
OTHERMALE:Damn, that looks good.
LEADMALE:Everybody, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Let's try to get our second wind, So we can get ready for the midnight rush.

LEADMALE:If they stay open till midnight, we will stay open till 2:00.
LEADFEMALE:If they put one of our men in the hospital, We'll put one of theirs in the morgue.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what happened to the coffee? what are you yelling at me for? You know, yeah, I had a little coffee.
LEADMALE:What's it to ya? A person's working late, she needs a little boost.
SUPMALE:You know, get off my back.
LEADMALE:You know, Roseanne, we are not in competition with them.
LEADMALE:Our chief rivals are the dumpsters behind mcdonald's And tommy's house of organ meat.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, not only do they have a drive-through window, But they also have that salad bar, For god's sakes.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody is going to even remember their salad bar When they find out about our waffle bar.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, normal people Don't want a waffle bar.
SUPMALE:Normal people are appalled At the idea of a waffle bar.
LEADFEMALE:Why? We've got the good waffles.
OTHERMALE:We've got eggos.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, at least I came through with something.
OTHERMALE:What happened to the celebrity you promised me? Where's burt reynolds? Doing "man of la mancha" in green bay.
LEADMALE:But i'm pretty sure I can get keanu reeves.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, how do you know keanu reeves? Not important.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, all right, the fat guy with the dog just left, So that means they're down to two customers.
SUPFEMALE:We've got three, So we win, we win! No, you can't go.
SUPMALE:Please, sir, you can't go.
LEADFEMALE:Have you tried our new waffle bar? I don't want your stupid waffles.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going across the street.
LEADMALE:They got cappuccino over there.
LEADMALE:Well, great.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just go ahead and walk right over there, You big bald-headed coffee-drinking queen? Sit! Okay, that's it.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not sticking around for just two customers.
SUPMALE:If you need me, here's my pager.
LEADMALE:The number's right on the side.
LEADFEMALE:They're staying open for two customers.
OTHERMALE:No no no no no.
LEADMALE:They are staying open For their drive-through window business.
