LEADMALE:Get you one of these hogs, Gary we're talking about serious freedom.
OTHERMALE:Jackie would love one of these.
LEADMALE:It's not the point.
LEADFEMALE:It's like getting a tattoo.
SUPFEMALE:Even if you've got her name on it, it's not for her.
LEADMALE:Wouldn't it be cheaper to get one of those Japanese bikes? No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:You don't want a bike that sounds like Barry Manilow.
LEADFEMALE:You want one that sounds like Steppenwolf.
OTHERMALE:Get on her.
OTHERMALE:See how she feels.
LEADFEMALE:Man, I'm in love.
SUPMALE:Oh, beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:Incredible.
LEADFEMALE:I can still feel it.
LEADFEMALE:It's always like that.
OTHERMALE:Do you guys want, like, a cigarette or anything? We ready to go? Jackie's not even here yet.
SUPMALE:What else is new? Don't go getting all greasy.
SUPFEMALE:This is a very nice restaurant we're going to.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, mom, me and Eddie was just goofing off.
OTHERMALE:What a lovely dress, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Cleaver.
OTHERFEMALE:What time's our reservation for? 10 minutes ago.
SUPMALE:She's always doing this.
LEADMALE:I'll be waiting 45 minutes at the cineplex while she's at the station printing perps.
LEADFEMALE:She actually said that? "Printing perps"? She's really into this police lingo.
LEADFEMALE:Every time I go over there, she's either eyeballing a mug shot, grilling a dirt bag, or, uh, frisking a biscuit.
LEADFEMALE:Or spanking a chicken.
SUPMALE:I hate that stupid job.
LEADMALE:Mom, I worked it out with Becky.
SUPFEMALE:She'll stay home and baby-sit d.j. , and I'm going out.
LEADMALE:Why would she make a deal like that? I had dirt on her.
LEADMALE:What kind of dirt? If I told you, I'd be staying home.
SUPFEMALE:So, what do you think your punishment ought to be? What do you mean? Darlene told me everything.
LEADMALE:That little rat.
LEADFEMALE:I told her I wouldn't do anything until I got your side of the story.
LEADFEMALE:Well, first we Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:You're getting good.
LEADMALE:If that's Jackie, I'll kill her.
LEADMALE:This better not be you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were somebody else.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's me.
SUPMALE:What? What happened? Did she get shot? Aunt Jackie? What, she was shot? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where is she? We'll be right there.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, where's the keys? She got injured in the line of duty.
SUPMALE:Let's get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:How bad is it? They don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Where's my keys? I gave them to you.
SUPFEMALE:I knew this would happen.
LEADMALE:I'll drive.
LEADMALE:Let her be ok.
SUPMALE:Call me when you find out.
SUPFEMALE:This is for the pain.
SUPMALE:Make it a double.
SUPMALE:Jackie? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:She's down here.
LEADMALE:Are you ok? Couldn't find anybody outside.
LEADMALE:What happened? It was a nightmare.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:You just hurt your back.
LEADFEMALE:May I tell the story? Well, it was a 311.
SUPFEMALE:It was on my beat, so I was first to respond.
LEADMALE:When I got to the scene, I realized the alleged perp was heavily intoxicated.
LEADFEMALE:Not only was it a 311, but a 402 as well.
SUPFEMALE:He resisted arrest, and there was a struggle.
OTHERFEMALE:A 979er, and that's when things got ugly.
LEADFEMALE:He went for his gun.
OTHERMALE:What gun? Your partner said the guy was completely naked.
OTHERFEMALE:It was dark.
LEADMALE:It could've been a gun.
LEADMALE:And then they both fell down a flight of steps.
LEADMALE:You tackled some naked guy and fell down the steps with him? Well, that's what they pay me for, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:If we hurry, we can still make it to that restaurant.
LEADMALE:Want to come, Jackie? Dan, no.
LEADMALE:I do have a herniated disk.
LEADMALE:Anything we can get for you? No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I ruined everybody's night.
LEADMALE:We're just glad you're ok.
LEADFEMALE:Know how long you'll be here? A couple of days for observation, then after that, take it easy.
SUPMALE:You know, bed rest, no physical exertion.
OTHERFEMALE:Could I have a minute alone? Now, no physical exertion.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, we'll be right outside Listening.
LEADFEMALE:I hate seeing you lying here in pain like this.
SUPMALE:Actually, since she gave me that shot, I'm feeling kind of neat.
SUPMALE:When we got that call said you were hurt, I've never been so scared in my life.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're so sweet.
LEADMALE:No, it's the truth.
LEADFEMALE:With your cute little button nose.
LEADMALE:Um, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, every day when you go to work, I worry you're going to get shot or stabbed.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you ask? Maybe we'll talk about this later.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:I'm ok.
LEADFEMALE:You said shot or stabbed.
SUPFEMALE:This time it didn't happen.
LEADFEMALE:You just fell down the stairs, but here you are in the hospital anyway.
SUPFEMALE:What happens if next time maybe some jerk really does have a gun? I know we've talked about this, but I just don't know if I can handle it anymore.
LEADMALE:What a nice man.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder who he was.
LEADFEMALE:What can't d.j. clean his own room? God, what a pig.
LEADFEMALE:How's aunt Jackie going to stand sleeping here? What is this? I think that's his underwear.
LEADMALE:Ooh! Where am I supposed to put this junk? Shove it under the bed.
LEADFEMALE:What are these? Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:What? It's a box full of little heads.
LEADMALE:Barbie.
OTHERMALE:GI Joe.
SUPMALE:Oh, Cher.
SUPFEMALE:The little runt is psycho.
LEADMALE:What does he do, cut their heads off and throw away the rest of the parts? No.
SUPFEMALE:This is very creepy, Darlene.
SUPMALE:Well, let's just put everything back exactly where it was.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Cleaning.
OTHERMALE:We're just cleaning.
LEADFEMALE:Did you clean my closet? No.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Why? No reason.
LEADMALE:Careful, Gary.
LEADFEMALE:You break her, you bought her.
SUPFEMALE:Very funny, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Just put her down here in the bed.
LEADFEMALE:Easy does it.
LEADMALE:How are you feeling? A little stiff, Beck.
LEADFEMALE:Get you anything? No.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:I got it.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, please, stop fussing.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Jackie, I made you a get-well card.
LEADMALE:Oh, Deej, look at that.
SUPMALE:Oh, you are such a good kid.
LEADFEMALE:He's got them all fooled.
SUPMALE:I brought the baggage, master.
LEADMALE:Where do you wish me to put it? Just put it anywhere, Igor.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, master.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps later you'll hit me? We'll see.
OTHERMALE:You're too kind.
LEADMALE:How you doing? Need any magazines? Need anything? I'm ok.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I need some rest.
LEADFEMALE:Check with you later.
LEADFEMALE:Gary, is something wrong? No.
SUPMALE:I'm just incredibly late.
LEADMALE:Ok, you guys, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:She needs to be all alone.
LEADMALE:Let's leave her alone.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, can you stay? I wasn't going to go anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:What's up? I found out that because of my back, I could wind up behind a desk.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you poor thing.
LEADMALE:Can I do my little happy dance now? Roseanne, how can you? You know how much being a cop means to me.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Nothing's happened yet.
LEADMALE:It happens all the time.
LEADFEMALE:You get hurt, can't work, they send you home.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I'd do.
LEADFEMALE:There's lots of things you could do.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to do anything else.
LEADMALE:People respect me.
LEADMALE:I got to do something that means something, that protects people and helps people, even if it means risking my life.
LEADFEMALE:You tackled a naked guy and grabbed for I could've sworn it was a gun.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? Shopping for motorcycles.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's a pip.
SUPFEMALE:"'78 Harley.
OTHERMALE:Mint condition.
LEADMALE:" We can't afford that.
LEADFEMALE:It's for Gary.
SUPMALE:Gary and I are planning on forming a gang.
SUPFEMALE:You and your sister will be our chicks.
LEADMALE:Then we plan on going out terrorizing small communities on the weekends, weather permitting.
OTHERMALE:How's Jackie? She's a bit better, but I don't think she should leave until she can take care of herself.
SUPMALE:You really enjoy this nurturing crap.
LEADFEMALE:Do not.
LEADMALE:Do, too.
LEADFEMALE:You've been real happy the last few days, having somebody to take care of.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it is cool, having somebody depend on me to feed them, take them to the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Besides you, that is.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, if d.j. Was doing something weird I don't mean normal weird, I mean really weird We'd have to send him away, right? Yeah, but he'd probably find his way back, like you always do.
LEADMALE:What's going on? He's doing something really weird.
OTHERMALE:I'm so tired of it.
LEADFEMALE:It's really, really boring.
OTHERFEMALE:Every time he does anything, you come squawking about it.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't do things the way you do.
SUPFEMALE:He does them differently.
LEADMALE:He's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:Real different.
SUPMALE:Looks like d.j. got himself a hobby.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, these are my old dolls.
OTHERMALE:He's not playing with dolls, is he? Oh, that's a relief.
LEADFEMALE:Do you guys think this is insane? Well, this one does kind of look like Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like she put up quite a little struggle.
LEADMALE:You guys are sick.
SUPMALE:Take them back where you got them.
LEADMALE:Mother! It's no big deal.
LEADMALE:He's a boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Boys do things like this.
LEADFEMALE:Go find something to do.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, when we finally lock the wacko up, don't expect me to change his papers.
LEADMALE:Dan, when you were d.j. 's age, you did stuff like that, right? No.
LEADMALE:The boy's odd.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, bud.
SUPMALE:I got you a bike.
LEADMALE:Hey, great.
OTHERMALE:We'll check it out this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Now you need a good, tough biker nickname.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:How about psycho? No.
OTHERFEMALE:We're saving that for d.j. I'm going to see Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:How is she? She's laying up in bed complaining.
OTHERMALE:I'm used to that.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Gary.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you feeling? You tell me.
LEADMALE:Well, that was fun.
LEADFEMALE:These are for you.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Gary, what's wrong? Ever since my accident, we haven't talked.
SUPMALE:Well, um I'm going to buy that Harley.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:And, um, things have been real busy at work.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen.
LEADFEMALE:You remember Hank who has a sign shop next to me? His secretary is leaving at the end of this month.
SUPMALE:Gary.
LEADFEMALE:It's a great job.
LEADFEMALE:I have a job.
LEADFEMALE:Just think about it.
LEADFEMALE:You knew I was a cop when we started dating.
LEADMALE:But I always thought You thought I would give it up.
OTHERMALE:It was just a phase.
LEADMALE:Now she's a cop, next month maybe a cowgirl.
LEADFEMALE:You got hurt.
LEADFEMALE:So, just say, "I told you so.
LEADMALE:" No.
LEADMALE:I can't live like this.
LEADFEMALE:Forget the fact you're never home.
SUPMALE:We can't make plans because you don't know what your day will be like.
LEADMALE:I can't relate to your friends 'cause all you do is talk cop talk.
SUPMALE:I'll be damned if I'm getting a call saying that my wife is in some hospital.
LEADMALE:I have to give up something I want because you can't deal with it.
LEADMALE:Isn't that a wee bit selfish? That's how I feel.
LEADMALE:I won't let you run my life.
SUPMALE:That won't change.
LEADFEMALE:I won't sit around waiting for that call.
SUPMALE:We're saying we're breaking up? Just say you won't be a cop anymore and this all goes away.
SUPFEMALE:Don't sell the bike.
OTHERFEMALE:My buddy really wants it.
SUPMALE:We will be there.
OTHERFEMALE:Soon.
SUPFEMALE:Gary, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, leave him alone.
LEADMALE:He's probably kissing it and making it better.
LEADMALE:We'll lose the bike.
OTHERMALE:I can't deal with that now.
LEADMALE:I got to go.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter, you guys have another fight? It was more than just a fight, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what? It's between her and me.
LEADMALE:It's a problem we've been having from the beginning.
SUPFEMALE:It's private, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:Jackie will tell me.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds bad.
SUPFEMALE:It's over.
LEADMALE:Aw, man.
LEADMALE:Well, these things happen.
SUPMALE:We're still going to do this bike thing, right? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Definitely.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll give me a buzz? Absolutely.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Gary.
LEADFEMALE:Huh, yeah? Take care of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You, too, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:How could you do that without even discussing it with me? He's not your boyfriend.
SUPMALE:This guy's great.
OTHERMALE:Those irritating things you do, he thinks they're cute.
LEADFEMALE:He walked in here, and he gave me an ultimatum.
LEADMALE:He told me to quit the force.
OTHERMALE:I've been telling you that since you started.
SUPMALE:And I've tried to break up with you, but you won't go.
LEADMALE:Becoming a cop is something I worked very hard for.
LEADMALE:What would you do if Dan demanded you leave the house and the kids? Ok.
SUPMALE:Bad example.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what I'd do.
LEADFEMALE:I'd work it out.
OTHERMALE:There's nothing to work out.
LEADMALE:I'm quitting.
LEADFEMALE:What? They said I'd have to take a desk job.
SUPFEMALE:I'm didn't become a cop to sit on my butt typing.
LEADMALE:All you did was sit on your butt drinking coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but I had a radio and a car.
SUPMALE:Now you're doing exactly what Gary wants you to do.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I'm doing what I want to do.
LEADFEMALE:It's the same thing that Gary wants.
LEADFEMALE:Let's rent a chapel and finish it.
LEADFEMALE:He'd think I quit because he told me to.
LEADFEMALE:But you would know the truth! Let him live in ignorance.
SUPMALE:Men love that! I'm going to do exactly what you'd do.
LEADFEMALE:You would never let a man run your life.
LEADMALE:I want somebody to support me no matter what.
LEADFEMALE:Like Dan does for you.
LEADFEMALE:Are you insane? You think he came out of a box like that? You could put those same years into Gary.
LEADMALE:He's perfect for you.
LEADFEMALE:No, Roseanne, he's perfect for you.
OTHERMALE:You want him to take care of your flaky sister so you won't have to worry.
LEADFEMALE:That's ok! You won't have to worry, because she's going to be just fine! Ok, so maybe Maybe you did the right thing.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:God, I hate that.
SUPMALE:Oh, Roseanne No, I really, really hate that, Jackie.

LEADFEMALE:10 days.
LEADMALE:I'll put these in the car.
SUPMALE:I'll miss you, too, Dan.
LEADMALE:You sure you want to go? There's nobody there to take care of you.
LEADMALE:It's just a cramped little hole of an apartment.
LEADMALE:You're depressing me.
LEADMALE:Well, if you're depressed, you really shouldn't go.
LEADMALE:It's time that I get on with my life.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you going to do? Disability pension's coming in.
LEADFEMALE:There's time to try stuff I've always wanted to do.
LEADMALE:Like what? I'm not telling you.
SUPMALE:Every time I try something new, you make fun of it, like becoming a cop.
LEADFEMALE:You don't lay off.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm not going to do anything like that.
LEADFEMALE:You can tell me.
SUPMALE:I will totally support whatever you choose.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:I was thinking of trying something kind of artistic, like being a painter or a sculptor.
LEADMALE:I could join that community theater.
OTHERMALE:I could be an actor.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, or you could be a ballerina.
LEADMALE:Want to be a ballerina? Or you could be an astronaut and fly way up high into outer space.
SUPMALE:Thank you for the support.
LEADFEMALE:You could be a kick-boxer.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:A sumo wrestler.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:No A psychic.
LEADFEMALE:But then you knew that, didn't you?
SUPMALE:
