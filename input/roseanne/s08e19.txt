SUPFEMALE:Healy.
LEADMALE:Today's topic is character assimilation.
SUPMALE:This is where you learn not just to play But to be the park's signature mascot Hans the hare.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that button nose, I couldn't help myself.
LEADMALE:Yes, hans is very funny.
LEADFEMALE:But remember, hans is not purely a comedian Like a stan laurel or a sinbad; Hans is an all-around entertainer.
LEADMALE:He sings, he dances, he has a fitness video.
LEADFEMALE:It's a full-body workout.
SUPMALE:It's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Now that you've read your "hans the hare" manual Tell me What is this hans Doing wrong? Hans does not wave constantly, but intermittently.
LEADFEMALE:Good! Hans only spins clockwise.
LEADFEMALE:Excellent! David healy What is hans doing wrong now? Uh, his ears aren't pointing to Look, i'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I didn't have time to read my manual last night.
SUPFEMALE:I was so tired after those wind sprints.
SUPFEMALE:Class, help Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Healy.
LEADFEMALE:All: hans doesn't sit.
SUPFEMALE:"a sitting bunny is an invitation to mayhem.
OTHERFEMALE:" Listen, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Schlosser, I'm not sure i'm supposed to be here learning about how to play hans.
SUPFEMALE:I draw, I paint.
LEADFEMALE:I was told I was going to be in the art department.
LEADMALE:How many of you here Are on the waiting list for the art department? Mr.
LEADMALE:Healy, If you're having second thoughts about joining the edelweiss family Then by all means vacate your room and leave.
LEADFEMALE:Vacate my room? No no, Mr.
LEADMALE:Schlosser, i'll stay.
SUPFEMALE:I'll stay and i'll be the best damn-Darn hans the hare there ever was.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I was done filling out forms when we got this prison job.
LEADMALE:Every day they send me something new.
SUPFEMALE:i'm getting writer's cramp.
SUPFEMALE:See if they got any forms for workman's comp.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, I heard something on the news About these government contractors getting all these kickbacks, you know? Find out how that works.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:May I come in? I'm sorry, but we already subscribe to "the watchtower.
LEADMALE:" What the hell are you knocking for? I haven't lived here for two whole weeks.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to be impolite.
LEADFEMALE:May I remind you where you are, young man? I'm just trying to be nice.
SUPMALE:At edelweiss we're supposed to be nice all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Guess it just kind of stuck with me.
SUPMALE:So how is everyone? Oh, everyone is just fine.
LEADMALE:But I won't be till you take off that stupid tie.
LEADMALE:I need it so I can shoot up.
SUPMALE:I'd really rather keep it on.
LEADMALE:Besides, I like looking nice.
SUPFEMALE:We have this little hans the hare motto: "my teeth brushed white, clothes wrinkle-free, I'm hans the hare, and I love me.
OTHERMALE:" Then we kind of hop around a little.
LEADFEMALE:You won't be doing that here.
LEADMALE:What other stuff they got you doing there? Well, first they had me on the crusades adventure But soon I might be working on the fortress of fun Or maybe even das glass-bottom boot.
LEADFEMALE:Have they got any adventures That don't have something to do with war? You know, like something happy Like little bears or elves Or-you know, this is out of my area, but you know what I mean.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure there are other rides, But I don't know the whole park yet.
SUPFEMALE:You'd better not let hans the hare find out about that.
LEADMALE:He'll give you some demerits.
OTHERMALE:How did you know about the demerits? You've got to be kidding me.
LEADFEMALE:No, all it takes is six demerits and then they send you To the edelweiss correction school for a month.
LEADMALE:Correction school? What's that, some kind of brainwashing camp? No, it says right on the brochure "this is not a brainwashing camp.
OTHERFEMALE:" Yeah and I put the correct weight On my driver's license.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, this might not mean much to you But it's very important to me that I make this job work.
LEADMALE:Hey, David, looking good.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go comb my hair.
SUPMALE:I'm feeling a little unkempt.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you for the compliment, Mr.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Would you look at that? Our david's turning into a man.
OTHERFEMALE:No he's not.
OTHERMALE:He's turning into some kind of Buttoned down corporate rabbit robot.
SUPMALE:And the really scary thing is, did you see that tie? It's not even a clip-on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Roseanne, he's just trying to be part of a team.
LEADMALE:Team sports made me what I am today.
OTHERMALE:You made me what I am today.
SUPMALE:But team sports got me ready for you.
LEADMALE:We've got to help him, Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:No, we've got to let go.
SUPMALE:He's over 18.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, as much as we love David he's not really our son.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not according to our last tax returns.
SUPMALE:Pardon me, hans.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:You can call me David.
SUPMALE:That's all right, hans.
LEADMALE:You know, i've always had a thing for hans the hare.
LEADMALE:I often dream that i'm even married to hans.
SUPMALE:I know that's silly.
SUPMALE:Or is it? Team leader in the room.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, everyone, we're expecting a full park today And I want to see a lot of children with happy faces Because a happy face is All: a repeat customer.

LEADFEMALE:Never do anything to disgrace the bunny.
LEADFEMALE:Where's David healy? How did you get past the security goats? Well, actually I had no problem at all.
LEADMALE:Perhaps it was my Lucky rabbit's foot.
LEADMALE:Ma'am i'm going to have to ask you to leave the magic rabbit hole.
LEADFEMALE:Pal, i'm gonna have to ask you to kiss my ass.
LEADMALE:Which one of you is David healy? They have no identity.
SUPMALE:They won't answer to any name except the one we've given them.
OTHERMALE:David healy: The kid who secretly hates animals; The kid who told me the buffalo got what they deserved.

SUPMALE:hans, follow your training.
LEADMALE:I trained you first, David.
LEADMALE:Here, sniff my hand to remember.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, why are you doing this? Why are you trying to make me go home? five words, David: You're dressed like a rabbit.
LEADMALE:They're giving me a job, a place to stay.
LEADFEMALE:I've been at your house too long.
LEADFEMALE:But David, you don't have to sell out Everything you believe in just to pay the rent.
SUPFEMALE:I like it here.
LEADFEMALE:No you don't, David.
OTHERMALE:You just think you do because it's so easy.
SUPFEMALE:They do all your thinking for you.
OTHERFEMALE:They make all your decisions for you.
SUPFEMALE:They say "hop" and you say "how high?" Three inches.
SUPFEMALE:Wake up, David.
LEADMALE:This place wants to be disneyworld, But it's just some creepy fascist copy.
LEADMALE:Today it's, "hi, i'm hans the hare.
LEADMALE:Welcome to the park.
SUPMALE:" But tomorrow it's, "I was only following orders.
SUPMALE:" I don't know what to do.
OTHERMALE:Well, I do.
LEADMALE:You're gonna go home with me now.
LEADFEMALE:That is if-if they let you.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Healy is free to leave.
LEADMALE:All edelweiss gardens employees have complete freedom.
LEADFEMALE:You say they have freedom, But do they really? Are they free after work to go sit and have a beer And trash their boss like you can on any other job? No! And yet this place claims To represent what america stands for.
SUPMALE:Well, my america stands for more Than $5 to park, $30 to get in, And $5 tasteless bunny-shaped hamburgers.
LEADMALE:Now if you will excuse us, David and I are going to get in my crappy car, Drive along that polluted river Where we could get carjacked or forced off the road by drunks, Pull up in front of our house and run in before we are robbed.
LEADFEMALE:Because that, mister, is my america And I thank god we're free to enjoy it.
LEADMALE:Come on, David.
LEADMALE:No, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, I want to go back to edelweiss gardens So I can help people have fun again.
OTHERMALE:All right, let's go over this One more time: Your name is David healy.
LEADFEMALE:You frown, you're introspective And you mope.
LEADMALE:I'm not listening.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not listening.
LEADMALE:I'm not listening.
LEADMALE:Listen to me, David.
LEADMALE:We don't whistle while we work.
OTHERMALE:We grumble and complain And encourage others to do likewise.
LEADFEMALE:No no no! no no no no! yes yes yes! Let me tell you a little something about your edelweiss gardens, David.
SUPMALE:It's mediocre food And mediocre fun at best.
LEADMALE:And you know why I know that, David? Because I am an expert on what is mediocre.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
SUPFEMALE:You hate me now, don't you, David? Admit it.
SUPMALE:You're feeling hate.
LEADFEMALE:You hate me right now, don't you? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't.
SUPMALE:You're a paying customer and I respect and admire you.
SUPFEMALE:Liar! Break, damn you, break.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to me, David.
OTHERFEMALE:Rabbits and geese and goats are not people.
LEADFEMALE:They don't sing and dance.
