SUPFEMALE:Mom wants you to set the table.
SUPFEMALE:I'm working on my paper.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:What's the topic, Larry, the unsung stooge? No.
LEADMALE:Columbus-heroic explorer or scumball from Spain? Man, you must really want to go to summer school, huh? It's totally bogus.
OTHERMALE:He was a slave trader.
LEADMALE:Do they want the truth, Or do they want me to spit back the textbook? Who's the teacher? Grayson.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Spit.
LEADMALE:High school's just learning lies and telling lies.
OTHERMALE:Then how come you ain't getting any As? We'll be eating in five minutes, and after two or three helpings, people might notice that there's no silverware.
LEADMALE:One minute.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
OTHERMALE:What smells good? Prime rib, baked potatoes, and all the trimmings.
SUPMALE:Hey, that does smell good.
LEADMALE:What are we having? Something I need scissors for.
LEADMALE:Darlene, set the table! Coming! I got a call from Stan Becker this morning.
SUPMALE:Oh, gee, that reminds me-Stan Becker called yesterday.
SUPMALE:He mentioned that.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, he's remodeling the pizza barn, His regular drywaller bailed on him, So he offered me a buttload of money to do the job.
LEADFEMALE:I said I don't do that anymore.
LEADFEMALE:He says he's heard it's slow at the shop, And he's in a bind.
LEADFEMALE:He made me promise to talk it over with you.
OTHERMALE:What do you think? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I kind of quit listening right after buttload of money.
LEADMALE:I'll feel like a total washout.
LEADMALE:Well, we do what we got to do, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:If we didn't settle for less every so often, me and you would be married to other people.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I got to think about it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, don't do that.
SUPFEMALE:I'm serious.
LEADMALE:Grayson's the summer school king.
LEADFEMALE:You don't give him what he wants, You're looking at eight weeks in a moron steam bath.
SUPMALE:I don't know what he wants, Becky.
OTHERFEMALE:It's easy.
SUPMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Columbus was looking for a new trade route to China.
LEADMALE:He found San Salvador.
LEADFEMALE:And slaughtered, like, thousands of people.
SUPMALE:Well, you can throw that in, But don't make a big deal out of it.
SUPMALE:Look, Darlene, if you want, I'll help you with your paper after dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are you doing this, Becky? 'Cause you're my sister.
LEADMALE:And because I don't want to support you After mom and dad are dead.
LEADFEMALE:Better get going, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to be late.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't you look cute.
SUPMALE:These overalls are all stiff and scratchy.
LEADMALE:That's 'cause we never washed them after your last job.
LEADFEMALE:Once you get a good sweat going, they'll loosen up.
LEADMALE:Now, you play nice with all those other little drywallers.
SUPMALE:There are no other drywallers, just me and a wall and failure.

LEADMALE:This is a great thing.
LEADMALE:I'm thinking of hanging it up in the bathroom where your daddy can sit and admire it.
SUPMALE:A "B"! On the road to honor roll! This is all such a load.
SUPMALE:What's the matter? How come you're not happy? Why would I be happy? Darlene, it was a good paper.

LEADMALE:You wrote it? Well, yeah, but I-You only got a "B"? What'd you do that for? I was trying to help her.
LEADMALE:Aren't we all supposed to be helping Darlene? That doesn't help her, Becky.
LEADMALE:Darlene doesn't do anything.
OTHERMALE:If you do everything for her, She'll never come out of this.
LEADMALE:I kept her from flunking, mother.
LEADFEMALE:She conned you into doing it so she didn't have to.
OTHERFEMALE:Even d.j. Could've seen that coming.
LEADMALE:That's really stupid, Becky.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:I help her and get yelled at.
LEADMALE:It's so typical.
OTHERMALE:Don't give me that martyr crap.
LEADFEMALE:When did you ever buy me a cake for bringing home a decent grade or helping out d.j. or doing the laundry or any of the other million things I do while Darlene sits around and sucks up all the attention? Brother.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, I really wanted that "B"! I know, I know, and you deserved it, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:You worked hard for it.
LEADMALE:My life is crap.
LEADMALE:Now, things will turn around.

LEADFEMALE:You don't want me to gain back all the weight I lost.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Keep smoking.
LEADFEMALE:I like my women skinny and hawking up tar.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's not like you don't come home every night and have two or three beers.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, and it's not like you don't sit in the living room, watching TV, and pig out on garbage.
SUPMALE:No argument there.
OTHERFEMALE:Where do you get off being all high and mighty? I don't smoke.
LEADFEMALE:You taught me to.
LEADMALE:And made you quit.
LEADMALE:I'll quit again.

LEADMALE:I said I'm gonna quit! Why should I believe you? Now you're calling me a liar? You been smoking secretly how many months now? Well, that doesn't make me a liar.
LEADMALE:Well, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What does it make you? Sneaky.

OTHERFEMALE:It's hard in the beginning.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know you smoked.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I quit nine years ago, But I had a rough year and started again.
LEADFEMALE:Now it's like I never quit.

LEADMALE:You should've been yelling at Darlene.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, I'd love to yell at Darlene, But she'd just go up in her room and hide.
LEADFEMALE:I like yelling at you more 'Cause you're fun.
LEADMALE:You yell back.
LEADMALE:I was trying to help.
SUPMALE:I know it.
SUPMALE:And you just gave me grief for it.
LEADFEMALE:I know.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:So how long's it been? Four days.
