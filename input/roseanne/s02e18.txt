OTHERFEMALE:WE'RE GONNA LOOK BETTER, AND WE'RE GONNA FEEL BETTER.
LEADFEMALE:WE WON'T EAT BETTER.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW HOW WE HATE BEING LIKE THIS.
LEADMALE:HEY, ROSEANNE, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T GO OUT A LOT.
SUPFEMALE:WE DON'T HAVE A BIG HOUSE.
SUPFEMALE:FOOD IS THE ONE LUXURY WE CAN AFFORD.
SUPMALE:WELL, FOOD AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A LUXURY, DAN.
LEADFEMALE:I MEAN, IT'S SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOU ALIVE.
LEADMALE:IT AIN'T SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE.
SUPMALE:WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? YOU THINK YOUR MOM NEEDS TO LOSE WEIGHT? NO.

OTHERMALE:YOU COULD STAND TO LOSE A FEW, MOM.
LEADFEMALE:I DIDN'T ASK YOU.

LEADFEMALE:BESIDES, I'M GOING ON A DIET, DAN.
LEADMALE:I'M STARTING RIGHT NOW.
LEADMALE:GO.
LEADMALE:I'LL BE HERE WHEN YOU GET BACK.
LEADMALE:THIS WHOLE FAMILY HAS GOT TO START EATING BETTER, I SWEAR.

LEADFEMALE:AND YOU WERE CHEATING JUST THEN, TOO, WEREN'T YOU? DON'T TRY TO DENY THAT EITHER.
SUPMALE:YOU DID SAY WE'LL GO ON A DIET, AND IF WE ARE GONNA DIET, I SAY LET'S STICK TO THE DIET.
SUPMALE:EATING POTATO CHIPS ISN'T GONNA HELP ANYTHING.
LEADFEMALE:WHO'S EATING POTATO CHIPS? WHAT? YOU SAID POTATO CHIPS.
LEADMALE:WHO'S EATING POTATO CHIPS? I MEANT ICE CREAM.
LEADFEMALE:BUT YOU SAID POTATO CHIPS.
LEADMALE:I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE YOU, DAN.

LEADMALE:YOU SURE? YEAH.
SUPMALE:I'M NOT EVEN HUNGRY.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, YOU HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING.
LEADMALE:HOW ABOUT A BRAN MUFFIN? NO.
SUPFEMALE:NO.
LEADFEMALE:I'VE BEEN GOOD FOR A WEEK NOW.
LEADMALE:ONE LITTLE MUFFIN'S NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.
LEADFEMALE:ARTHUR ATE BRAN EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE.
LEADFEMALE:SO I BET HE HAD A PRETTY CLEAN COLON.
LEADMALE:YES, HE DID.
LEADMALE:I LIKE THAT IN A MAN.
SUPFEMALE:NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO BE CAREFUL, BUT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT TOLD ME I SHOULDN'T HIDE UNDER ALL THE EXTRA WEIGHT.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, OF COURSE I DID, BUT YOU CAN'T STARVE YOURSELF, ROSEANNE.
SUPFEMALE:MAYBE JUST A HALF.
LEADFEMALE:THAT'S RIGHT.
LEADMALE:YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR ENERGY UP.
LEADMALE:I'M NOT EVEN HUNGRY.
LEADFEMALE:I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M EATING THIS THING.
SUPFEMALE:HABIT.
LEADMALE:YOU KNOW, WHEN I NEED TO LOSE A FEW INCHES, I EXERCISE.
LEADMALE:YEAH.
SUPFEMALE:IT'S THE BEST.
LEADMALE:WHEN I EXERCISE, I GET SO RELAXED.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S LIKE I ACTUALLY ZONE OUT.
LEADFEMALE:YOU? ZONE OUT? NO, REALLY.
LEADMALE:I DO STRETCHING FIRST, THEN 20 MINUTES OF LOW-IMPACT AEROBICS TO GET MY HEART RATE UP, THEN A HALF HOUR OF TONING ALL MY PROBLEM ZONES.
SUPFEMALE:IT'S REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT EXERCISE? DODGING MACHINE-GUN FIRE ON A BEACH.
LEADFEMALE:YEAH, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU GET ALL SWEATY, THEN YOU COULD JUST DIVE RIGHT INTO THE OCEAN.
SUPMALE:I KNOW.
OTHERFEMALE:IT'S SO REFRESHING.
LEADMALE:HEY, IRIS, HOW COME YOU'RE ALL THE TIME MAKING THESE DEMENTED COMMENTS ABOUT BEING BLOWN AWAY AND STUFF? THE TRUTH? YEAH.
LEADMALE:I'M SHELL-SHOCKED.
LEADMALE:COME ON.
LEADFEMALE:HEY.
LEADFEMALE:I STAND HERE ALL DAY LISTENING TO WOMEN BELLYACHE.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S MY WAY OF SAYING, "SHUT UP, OR I'LL TURN YOUR HAIR INTO A BONSAI TREE.
LEADMALE:" YOU KNOW, ROSEANNE, IF YOU WOULD EXERCISE EVERY DAY AND GET YOUR METABOLISM GOING, YOU COULD EAT ANYTHING YOU WANT.
OTHERFEMALE:I COULD EAT ANYTHING I WANT.
SUPMALE:OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
SUPMALE:YOU'D IMPROVE YOUR CIRCULATION.
SUPFEMALE:YOU'D HAVE MORE ENERGY DURING THE DAY.
OTHERMALE:I COULD EAT ANYTHING I WANT? HALF-HOUR WALK EVERY MORNING WOULD GET YOU INTO GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION.
LEADFEMALE:AND HELP SUPPRESS YOUR APPETITE.
LEADMALE:I COULD EAT ANYTHING I WANT? THERE'S ALREADY SUGAR IN THAT CEREAL, d.j. TOUGH NOOGIE.
LEADMALE:YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD EAT MORE FRUIT.
LEADFEMALE:I DON'T LIKE FRUIT.
LEADMALE:THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR HEAD LOOKS LIKE AN APPLE.
LEADMALE:WHERE'S MOM AND DAD? I DON'T KNOW.
LEADFEMALE:MAYBE THEY'RE STILL ASLEEP.
LEADMALE:Jackie: ANYBODY HOME? JACKSON.
SUPMALE:MORNING.
SUPFEMALE:THEY WEREN'T IN THERE.
LEADMALE:WHAT UP, JACK? HI.
OTHERMALE:WHERE'S YOUR MOM? I'M SUPPOSED TO GIVE HER A RIDE TO WORK.

SUPMALE:I JUST CHECKED THEIR BEDROOM, AND NOBODY'S HERE.
LEADMALE:AH.
LEADMALE:PROBABLY OUT WALKING.
SUPFEMALE:YEAH.
OTHERMALE:RIGHT.

LEADMALE:YOUR MOM SAID THAT THEY WERE GONNA START WALKING EVERY MORNING.
LEADMALE:I THINK THAT'S GREAT.
LEADFEMALE:YOU WANT SOME TOAST? YEAH.
OTHERFEMALE:THANKS.
LEADFEMALE:BUTTER? IN THE FRIDGE.
SUPFEMALE:AUNT JACKIE, HOW COME MOM IS SO HEAVY AND YOU'RE SO THIN? GENETICS.
LEADFEMALE:OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! BUT IT'S NOT ALL GENETICS.
LEADMALE:A LOT OF HOW MUCH YOU WEIGH DEPENDS ON IF YOU WERE A HEAVY KID, 'CAUSE, UH, THAT'S WHEN ALL YOUR FAT CELLS ARE FORMED, YOU KNOW.
SUPMALE:AND THEN, YOU ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FAT CELLS IN YOUR BODY, AND THEY EITHER GET BIGGER OR SMALLER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
LEADFEMALE:BUT I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALL PRETTY THIN.
OTHERMALE:BUT MOM WASN'T A HEAVY KID.
SUPFEMALE:YOU GUYS WERE BOTH THE SAME-IT'S JUST A THEORY, OK? PLUS THERE'S ALSO THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THERE'S BEING PREGNANT THREE TIMES AND HAVING KIDS AROUND WHO NEED TO EAT CONSTANTLY AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY.
SUPMALE:AND THERE'S ALSO EXTRA TARTAR SAUCE ON HER FISH STICKS AND EXTRA MAYO ON HER ROAST BEEF AND EXTRA ROAST BEEF ON HER KAISER ROLL.
SUPFEMALE:SO BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING MOM JUST EATS A LOT.
SUPFEMALE:NO.
OTHERMALE:NO.
OTHERMALE:WELL, YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:YEAH.
LEADMALE:BUT, LOOK, SHE'S OUT EXERCISING.
LEADMALE:SHE'S NOT EXERCISING.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU SAID SHE'S WALKING.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES BEGINS WITH ONE STEP.
LEADFEMALE:AWESOME.
LEADFEMALE:DID YOU MAKE THAT UP? UH-HUH.
OTHERFEMALE:DAN, HOW'S THE WALK? GREAT.
SUPFEMALE:WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO PICK UP YOUR MOM.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, DAN, I WAS PRETTY GOOD TODAY.
SUPFEMALE:ME, TOO, BABE.
OTHERFEMALE:YEAH, I THINK THAT WALKING STUFF IS REALLY HELPING 'CAUSE I DON'T EVEN FEEL HUNGRY.
SUPFEMALE:WHY DON'T YOU COME HERE AND SIT DOWN AND JOIN THE FAMILY, BABE.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, ORDINARILY RIGHT NOW, I'D SURE BE IN THE MOOD FOR SOMETHING SWEET, BUT NOT EVEN INTERESTED.
LEADFEMALE:Man: SAY, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU TASTED REAL BUTTERSCOTCH? CREAMY, SMOOTH BUTTERSCOTCH WITH WALNUTS, SURROUNDED BY DELICIOUS MILK CHOCOLATE.
LEADFEMALE:HAVE A YUMMY BAR.
LEADMALE:YOU DESERVE IT.

LEADFEMALE:EVEN THE BACON WE PUT ON OUR CHEESEBURGERS IS FLAME-BROILED.
LEADFEMALE:AND WE USE REAL CHEESE, AND ALL OUR BUNS ARE TOASTED.
LEADFEMALE:SO BRING THE WHOLE FAMILY TO BUCKY BURGERS.
OTHERMALE:I'M HUNGRY! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I HAVEN'T HAD ONE THING.
LEADMALE:I CAN'T TAKE IT! DON'T DO IT, ROSEANNE.
SUPFEMALE:DON'T DO IT.
LEADFEMALE:I WANT ONE COOKIE! I'LL WALK AN EXTRA MILE TOMORROW.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU'LL HATE YOURSELF TONIGHT! I'LL WALK 2 MILES FOR ONE COOKIE! DARLENE, WHERE'S THOSE MALLOMARS? FREEZER.
LEADMALE:I THOUGHT YOU SAID ONE.
LEADFEMALE:I GOT ONE FOR YOU.
OTHERMALE:I DON'T WANT IT, AND NEITHER DO YOU.
SUPFEMALE:OH, YES, I DO, DAN! I DO! TRUST ME! I DO! ROSEANNE! NOW, NOBODY SAID THIS WAS GONNA BE EASY, AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE.
LEADFEMALE:FOOD'S A TOUGH THING TO BEAT.
LEADMALE:IT'S EVERYWHERE.
LEADMALE:YOU CAN HEAR IT.
LEADMALE:YOU CAN SMELL IT.
LEADFEMALE:HELL, IF YOU WANT TO, YOU CAN TASTE IT.
LEADFEMALE:BUT WHEN THAT BIG CALORIE COUNTER IN THE SKY LOOKS DOWN IN HIS BOOK, I WANT US TO DO HIM PROUD.
SUPFEMALE:THERE'S GONNA BE CALORIES.
LEADFEMALE:THERE'S GONNA BE CARBOHYDRATES.
LEADFEMALE:BUT IT'S OUR JOB TO KEEP 'EM DOWN, PUSH 'EM BACK, HOLD 'EM TO 3, AND FORCE A TURNOVER.
OTHERMALE:BUT WE CAN'T EAT TURNOVERS! WE CAN'T EVEN HAVE POP TARTS! WE GOT TO ZIG.
SUPFEMALE:WE GOT TO ZAG.
LEADFEMALE:WE'RE GONNA STICK AND MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.
SUPFEMALE:WE'RE THE UNDERDOGS IN THIS GAME, BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE WINNING, SEE.
LEADMALE:BUT REMEMBER, THE FINAL SCORE-IT'S UP TO US.
OTHERMALE:IT'S UP TO US.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S UP TO US.

SUPMALE:WAY TO GO, 37.
LEADMALE:I DIDN'T EAT NOTHING.
LEADMALE:BOY, BUT I COULD SURE GO FOR SEEING THAT BUCKY BURGER COMMERCIAL AGAIN.
LEADFEMALE:YOU GUYS WERE WALKING FOR AN HOUR.
OTHERMALE:THE OLYMPICS ARE ONLY 2 YEARS AWAY.
LEADFEMALE:THEN YOU STILL HAVE TIME.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT EVENT? CHILD THROWING.
OTHERMALE:MAYBE I SHOULD START GETTING UP AND WALKING WITH YOU GUYS.
SUPFEMALE:ME, TOO.
LEADMALE:NO, NO.
LEADMALE:THESE WALKS ARE PRIVATE.
LEADFEMALE:OOH.
SUPMALE:DO YOU GUYS MAKE OUT WHILE YOU'RE WALKING? Roseanne: DAN! WHAT? THEY FIT! THEY FIT! HEY! NOW LET ME TRY 'EM ON.
SUPFEMALE:YOU KNOW, I'M SO HAPPY.
LEADMALE:I KNOW.
LEADMALE:I DID IT.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S NOT THAT MUCH OR NOTHING.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S A SMALL THING.
LEADMALE:BUT MY PANTS FIT, AND I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT.
OTHERMALE:BUT, YOU KNOW, IF I COULD DO THIS GOOD, MAYBE I CAN DO EVEN BETTER.
SUPMALE:MAYBE WE REALLY CAN EXERCISE EVERY DAY, AND MAYBE I REALLY CAN LOSE SOME MORE WEIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:I FEEL GREAT! THAT'S GREAT, BABE.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, I HAVE TIME.
LEADMALE:YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO? I'M GONNA WALK TO WORK.
