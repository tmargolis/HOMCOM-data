SUPFEMALE:Throw a stick at the window when she's gone.
OTHERMALE:Chicken.
LEADFEMALE:I hate how we act when she's around.
LEADFEMALE:You get crazy, the kids get weird, and I become captain son-in-law, fending off deadly insults with his invincible phony grin of steel.
OTHERMALE:I'll call Jackie and tell her mom's coming.
LEADMALE:Like she'll rush right over after that fight they had.
LEADFEMALE:She'll be here.
LEADFEMALE:It's her mother.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:No, watch and learn.

SUPMALE:And here again.
LEADMALE:He really thought this was funny.
LEADFEMALE:How about some more coffee, Grandma? Thank you, sweetheart.

LEADMALE:No, she'll be coming over.
LEADMALE:Be nice to her this time.
SUPMALE:I'm always nice to her.

OTHERFEMALE:That's how we talk.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, I'll be good.
SUPMALE:Hi, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you come say hi when I got here? Why didn't you come up and say hi? Look who forgot to give Grandma a great big kiss.
SUPMALE:Here you go, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:I put in skim milk and brown sugar, just the way you like it.
LEADFEMALE:Becky is certainly blossoming into a beautiful young woman.
LEADFEMALE:Feel free to speak directly to her, mom.
LEADMALE:She's that blonde sitting next to you there.
LEADMALE:Anyone special these days I should know about? There's this guy who just moved here from Evanston.
SUPFEMALE:He asked me out tonight.
LEADMALE:What did you tell him? Well, nothing yet, but She knows you rarely visit, and she'd rather spend that time with you.
LEADMALE:Well, that's just silly.
OTHERMALE:You can't waste an evening with me when you could be having fun.
LEADFEMALE:Why the hell not? Thanks, Grandma.
SUPMALE:I'll wear that silk blouse you got for my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:I better make a call.

SUPMALE:If it rains, I'll wear those galoshes you got me.
LEADMALE:You stay here with us.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to stay.
SUPFEMALE:I want to go out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now where would you be going? What's that supposed to mean? Darlene, when you're a big girl like Becky you'll get to go on dates, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a damn minute! Ok, Darlene, get out in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:She can't decide who's old enough to go out and who isn't.
SUPFEMALE:Don't talk to her like that.
LEADMALE:Why can Becky go out? Becky had a date.
SUPMALE:Well, so could I.
SUPMALE:Grandma acts like I'm 3 years old.
LEADFEMALE:You are acting like you missed your nap.
LEADFEMALE:I bet Becky doesn't even have a date.
LEADMALE:I've got enough going on.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need any more trouble from you.
LEADMALE:I hate her.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going, honey? Run away.
OTHERFEMALE:Run away.
OTHERMALE:It's a shame Becky has to go out the one night I'm in town.
LEADFEMALE:You just told her to go.
LEADMALE:Talk to her.
OTHERMALE:Have her at least stay for dinner.
SUPMALE:You talk to her.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want her to be mad at me.
OTHERFEMALE:No, she can be mad at me.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Well, I need to visit the little girls' room.
SUPFEMALE:62 years old and she still says the little girls' room.
LEADMALE:Bring on the fudge and Kevin Costnerâs butt.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm ready to sink my teeth into both of them.
LEADMALE:How you doing, sis? Roseanne, are these towels clean? You are just evil.
LEADMALE:Is that Jackie? Oh, no, you don't! Let me go! She's your mother! Don't make me hurt you, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:You're going to get up and stay here.
LEADMALE:Grow up.
LEADMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:Mom, hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, tell me, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:How many women can look that good without a drop of makeup? And your hair's adorable.
LEADMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm almost glad your dad couldn't make it.
LEADFEMALE:This give us girls a chance to have some fun.
LEADFEMALE:This is mom, isn't it? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I better check that birthmark she's got.
LEADMALE:No, 665.
LEADMALE:Close enough.
OTHERMALE:I heard from Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Quigley.
SUPMALE:Our old neighbor? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:She said everybody's fine, and her little Jeffrey should be out of prison soon.
LEADFEMALE:Those eight years just flew by, didn't they? Remember when Jeffrey talked you into playing spin the bottle? Yeah.
LEADMALE:He kissed me and his retainer fell off in my mouth.
LEADFEMALE:My little angel was playing spin the bottle? Sure, Jackie, now you got me in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Ground her, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Ground her.
SUPMALE:Ground her.
SUPFEMALE:Anything else you want to tell me while I'm knee-deep in this cheap chardonnay? Ok.
LEADMALE:Remember this one weekend when you and dad went to one of his furniture conventions? Oh Oh, what? You two have some kind of wild party? Yeah In Chicago.
LEADMALE:In Chicago.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:Now she's thinking now.
SUPFEMALE:Will she yell at us for something we did over 22 years ago, or There you go.
LEADMALE:Ok, mom.
OTHERMALE:You two are terrible.
LEADMALE:Hey, I have one that's even better.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Remember my friend Jeanine? You used to stay at her house till all hours.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, well There was no Jeanine.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanine was Dan! Roseanne, I thought you were studying.
LEADFEMALE:I always got good marks.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, mostly on your neck.
SUPMALE:All right, it's my turn.
LEADFEMALE:Remember the design school I applied to that never answered back? Well, I actually got in.
SUPMALE:You were accepted? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Only I threw the letter away before you guys could see it.
LEADMALE:You knew how much we wanted you to go there.
SUPMALE:Well, I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Remember when I told you guys that Ringo actually called me up on the phone? I guess now we see what happens when we squander our opportunities.
LEADFEMALE:Don't start, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe if you'd gone to design school you'd have a career instead of Wasting my life bouncing from one meaningless job to the next.
LEADMALE:You guys, come on.
SUPMALE:Let's grab a vegetable and start chopping.
LEADFEMALE:No, she's going to tell me everything I've ever done wrong in my life.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I know you're dying to.
SUPMALE:I wish for once I didn't have to.
LEADMALE:I'll make it easy for you I'm a screw-up.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you're not a screw-up.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, you tell her she's not a screw-up.
SUPMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:What is it with you? Why can't you let her live her life? Because she had potential.
SUPFEMALE:She had a spark.
SUPFEMALE:We just didn't want to see it wasted.
OTHERFEMALE:Your father and I said to each other, "there's no limit to what Jackie can do.
SUPMALE:" You guys said that? You said I got a spark? Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Your father was convinced you'd be a lawyer because you loved to argue.
SUPMALE:Really? Why do you think we worried so much? We never worried about Roseanne.
LEADMALE:We knew what she'd be.
LEADMALE:Oh? What? Safe and comfortable and a good mommy, just like you are now.
LEADMALE:So what are you saying, mother? You're saying that all I could ever be is some ordinary housewife? Roseanne, you have a nice house, beautiful children A husband.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing wrong at all with being ordinary.
LEADMALE:Hey, how's it going? Run away.
LEADFEMALE:Run away.
LEADFEMALE:So my mother's in there doing these back flips over Jackie.
LEADMALE:I'm the one that turned out ok.
SUPMALE:Jackie's a screw-up.
LEADFEMALE:Roll with it, honey.
LEADMALE:Roll with it? What the hell is that supposed to mean? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I figured it was my turn to speak.
OTHERFEMALE:That's ok.
SUPMALE:I finished watching the whole game.
LEADMALE:This was just the overtime.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really hurt here, you know? I just can't believe it was always, like, Jackie could be this great astronaut or the president, and Roseanne Could be some great organ donor.
SUPFEMALE:Dad? Oh, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:What is it, Darlene? Actually, it was dad I wanted to talk to.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there he is.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Marcy just called and invited me over for dinner.
LEADMALE:No, you're here tonight.
LEADMALE:I don't appreciate your going over my head.

LEADFEMALE:Now go on and get in there.
LEADFEMALE:You come too, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have a nice family dinner.
SUPFEMALE:This is really good.
SUPMALE:Oh, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:It seems ordinary to me.
SUPMALE:I never learned how to cook.
SUPFEMALE:You had other talents, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Like what? Would you like some salt? Roseanne, you know I'm not allowed salt.
LEADMALE:Can I have more potatoes? Here you are, dear.
LEADMALE:Roseanne also keeps this house going like a well-oiled machine.
LEADFEMALE:How does she manage with her job and other stuff? Like what stuff? Like Like the, um PTA committee.
OTHERMALE:How do they manage without her? I quit that over two years ago, Jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Obviously your work there was finished, honey.
LEADFEMALE:And she sold over 50 tickets to the Elks' glaucoma dance.
LEADMALE:Which means I can dial a phone, huh? And d.j. has scouts every Saturday, which also means I had to master the fine art of driving.
LEADMALE:Boy, I'm just a regular renaissance woman, aren't I? Becky, honey, tell me about the boy you're dating.
LEADFEMALE:All my friends think he's really cute.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you're lucky Becky's so popular.
OTHERFEMALE:When you start dating she can give you some pointers.
SUPMALE:If she's so popular, ask her which one of us got felt up.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene, leave the table.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I knew that would do it.
OTHERFEMALE:I have an idea Let's skip dessert.
LEADMALE:I'm full.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, how about some of your fabulous Dutch apple pie? You make that with cinnamon, right? Nutmeg, mom.
SUPMALE:1 1/4 teaspoons of nutmeg.
LEADMALE:You know, speaking of pies, one day when these two were knee-high to a grasshopper, I went out back to call them for supper.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie was over by the fence building a village out of those Legos.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, it was quite a project, believe me.
LEADMALE:She had traffic lights and skyscrapers and hospitals and We get the picture, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, Roseanne was nowhere to be seen.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I looked and looked and finally found her behind that big maple tree near the ditch.
LEADFEMALE:There she sat in her white ruffled dress completely covered with dirt and making mud pies.
LEADMALE:So you see, Roseanne, making pies must be in your blood.
SUPFEMALE:Speaking of blood What time you shoving off tomorrow, Bev? Grandma, I've got to go.
LEADMALE:But we haven't talked.
SUPMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:What do you want to talk about? Maybe she wants to talk about my mashed potatoes, how creamy smooth they are.
SUPMALE:Maybe, huh? Or maybe my biscuits.
LEADFEMALE:How light and airy, the way they just fly across the room.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe she wants to talk about the other 10 million ordinary things I do in my ordinary life.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Is she getting enough iron? Hey, hey, what is your problem? My problem is I've got no spark.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I didn't have to end up ordinary if she'd expected anything like she did you.
LEADMALE:You missed out on the chance to be a neurotic mess.
LEADMALE:It ain't right, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:She should've treated us the same.
LEADMALE:You treat your kids the same? Yeah, I do.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think I do? It's no big deal if she thought I had potential because she'll always think I messed up my life.
SUPMALE:She'll always think you're the best mud pie maker in the whole world.
LEADMALE:She decided that long ago.
LEADMALE:It's not going to change.
LEADMALE:That's the way mothers are.
LEADFEMALE:Not this one.
LEADMALE:I'm not going back down there, so forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I made it through dinner.
OTHERMALE:That was the deal.
SUPMALE:I won't take any more "Becky beautiful" garbage.
SUPFEMALE:You have more respect for your Forget it.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:You're not mad about what I did at dinner? I thought you were really out of line till I started throwing biscuits.
LEADFEMALE:You threw biscuits at Grandma? No, I didn't want to hit d.j. You know how soft his skull is.
LEADMALE:I miss all the good stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Darlene, do you think that I Encourage you, you know, to do stuff? Well, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? Well Do you think that I expect more out of Becky than I do out of you? I don't know.
SUPMALE:You expect Becky things out of Becky Like good grades.
LEADMALE:I expect good grades out of you, too.
SUPFEMALE:I just never get them.
LEADFEMALE:I think we both know that I'm smarter, just in a different way.
SUPMALE:If you dropped me and Becky in the woods, I'd make it home and poor little Becky would crawl into a hollow log and die.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I had two daughters I always carry a spare.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm sorry I said I hated Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I love her, but sometimes I don't like her.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sometimes she makes it kind of tough.
OTHERMALE:But then there's these other times where you just want to take her face in your hands and twist it till her head pops off.
LEADMALE:It's good I never feel that way about you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it's a real good thing.
SUPMALE:You know, I got this theory Grandma was probably a better mom than her mom, and you're definitely a better mom than Grandma was.
LEADMALE:That's a good theory.
LEADMALE:By the time I'm a mom, I'll be awesome because I'll have learned from both your mistakes.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Heavy.
LEADMALE:What do you bet Grandma's downstairs making Becky look at her 400 pictures she took on her trip to Arizona? Becky will probably never get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:I ought to head back to the snake pit.
OTHERMALE:Want to come along? Will you be throwing any more biscuits? Yeah, if I can get a clear shot.
SUPMALE:Here's the world's largest reptile museum Lizardland.
LEADFEMALE:That's a lizard.
SUPFEMALE:Here's a bigger lizard.
OTHERFEMALE:That's the owner of the museum.
SUPMALE:A very nice young man.
SUPMALE:We told him all about you, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:He might be calling you.
SUPFEMALE:His name is fess.
OTHERMALE:Your dad playing stick-'em-up with a lizard.
LEADFEMALE:Not as funny as the cactus, but you know your father.
LEADMALE:You got his sense of humor.
LEADFEMALE:
