SUPMALE:k.
LEADMALE:I left two bottles in the fridge.

LEADFEMALE:Don't heat them in the microwave 'Cause I heard it's dangerous for the baby.
OTHERMALE:Only if the baby's still hanging on to it.
LEADMALE:And--and be careful of his soft spot.
LEADMALE:He's got a soft spot here.
LEADFEMALE:We better not find anything stuck in that head that's not supposed to be there when we get back.

LEADMALE:Coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, Crystal, you woke me up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god, I am so bored.
LEADMALE:You know, I think I'm starting to miss my husband.
LEADMALE:Hey, I vote we don't let Crystal pick what we do on our nights out anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry you're all having such a terrible time.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Crystal, it's really not that bad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, we're just whining and moaning to keep from passing out.
SUPMALE:B-14.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, if you're not enjoying yourself, you're free to go whenever you like.
LEADFEMALE:No, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:You're my ride.
SUPFEMALE:You never complain when Bonnie or Anne Marie pick what we do, but when it's my turn, you jump all over me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting a brownie.
LEADMALE:Whoa, what's with her? Apparently, your friends don't like you very much either.
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you there's something wrong.
OTHERMALE:Well, change his diaper again.
SUPMALE:I just changed it.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you did it wrong.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you gave my little baby a wedgie.
LEADFEMALE:That's not it.
OTHERFEMALE:Does his color look right to you? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What color was he when he got here? What are you doing? I'm trying to calm him down.
SUPMALE:Well, does this calm you down, you moron? Well, gee, I'm sorry, Becky.
SUPMALE:What would you like me to do? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm going to call Crystal.
SUPMALE:Oh, grow up.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? The baby won't stop crying, and he cheesed my shirt.
LEADMALE:We tried everything.
LEADMALE:Just relax.
LEADMALE:I've changed him a hundred times, and I feed him every 15 minutes.
OTHERMALE:Now you know why you had to change him so much.
SUPMALE:He might be warm.
LEADMALE:Should we take him to the hospital? Let the old doctor take a look here.
LEADFEMALE:You cutting a tooth there, little Ed? Yeah, he's teething, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. , see if there's any frozen waffles in the freezer.
OTHERMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
SUPMALE:Crystal's list didn't say anything about frozen waffles.
LEADMALE:That's because she doesn't know the secret.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Chew on this for a while, little Ed.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it's going to make those gums feel better.
LEADMALE:Mmm Ugh.
SUPFEMALE:He's slobbering.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I use a waffle-It's got all those built-in drool cups.
SUPFEMALE:You don't need a bib.
LEADMALE:Oh, gross.
LEADFEMALE:I can't watch this.
LEADMALE:You don't listen to them, little Ed.
LEADMALE:You go ahead and dribble.
SUPMALE:You're a Conner man.

LEADMALE:I don't find that funny.
LEADMALE:Oh, lighten up, Crystal.
LEADFEMALE:He's fine.

SUPFEMALE:You don't have to.
SUPMALE:Just sit here and watch me win.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Crystal will stay with me then.
SUPMALE:Where is she? Maybe she went to the bathroom again.
SUPMALE:Her purse and coat are gone.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't see her leave.
SUPFEMALE:She's my ride.
LEADMALE:Why would she leave me? Maybe that's her little way of ditching you.
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Now I got to quit and find out what the hell's the matter with her.
LEADMALE:You take her.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to.
LEADMALE:She's on your way.
LEADMALE:She won 50 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:She can take a cab.
LEADFEMALE:One of you is taking me home.
LEADMALE:I ain't taking you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Roseanne? Still at bingo.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, little Ed.
LEADMALE:Did you miss me, honey? Did you eat? Did you take a little nap? Good to see he isn't talking to you, either.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought he was snubbing me.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Becky and Darlene? I'm supposed to pay them.
SUPFEMALE:Pay d.j. He fed little Ed, he played with him, He even gave him his old bear.
SUPMALE:That's wonderful, d.j. Here's $5.
LEADMALE:00 for being such a responsible young man.
LEADFEMALE:All right! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Go show your sisters.
SUPMALE:Make sure you rub that in real good.
LEADMALE:How come you didn't bring Roseanne home with you? I left early.
OTHERMALE:How's she going to get home? I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me you two had a fight.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
SUPMALE:, Dan, I won't.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to know anything, so you don't have to do anything about it.
LEADFEMALE:Just like your father.
LEADFEMALE:So was it tequila night down at st.
LEADMALE:Benedict's? Hey! Why did you leave me down there? You were in your glory, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to interrupt.
LEADMALE:Cut the crap, Crystal.
LEADMALE:So what's your problem? Forget it.
LEADMALE:I was having a great time down there-Oh, how about that? I thought playing bingo was just another one of Crystal's stupid ideas.
OTHERMALE:After I won 50 bucks, it got funner.
LEADMALE:Are you going to retire, or will you go to your job tomorrow like nothing happened? I was just teasing.
LEADFEMALE:That's the way we are.
LEADMALE:It's the way you are, always have been.
LEADMALE:Ever since high school, Everything I do is stupid.
LEADMALE:Everything I say is stupid.
LEADMALE:Even the way I raise my kids is stupid.
LEADFEMALE:You're way overexaggerating now.
OTHERMALE:When you're not telling me how stupid I am, you're criticizing me or making fun of me, and when you're not doing that you're just ignoring me.
LEADFEMALE:I do not ignore you.
SUPMALE:How long did it take before you'd realized that I left the bingo parlor? O.
OTHERMALE:k.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, o.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADMALE:? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:"I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:" That's supposed to make up for 20 years.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? Crystal's mad.
LEADMALE:I've never seen her like that, ever.
LEADMALE:She yelled at me, and I was being adorable.
SUPMALE:you really must have done something to tick her off.
SUPMALE:I swear I didn't do anything.
SUPMALE:Come on, Roseanne, what did you do? Dan I did not treat her any different than I always do.
LEADMALE:Well, you better go apologize then.
LEADFEMALE:If she had some complaint against the way I've been treating her all these years, how come she waits till now to say something? I'm easy to talk to.
OTHERFEMALE:I listen.
OTHERMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADMALE:, I'll call her tomorrow and apologize.
LEADFEMALE:That a girl.
SUPFEMALE:How was bingo? Man, it was incredible.
SUPMALE:It was such a rush.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Did you win? Uh, no.
SUPFEMALE:If Crystal's not returning your calls, then you should see her.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Why should I? Hey, Louise.
OTHERMALE:Because you're upset.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not upset.
LEADMALE:She's the one that's upset.
LEADFEMALE:I've been a very good friend to Crystal ever since the eighth grade.
SUPFEMALE:I've been with her through four husbands.
LEADMALE:Hey, Peg.
LEADMALE:Yo, Ro.
LEADMALE:And when she decided she was getting married to Dan's dad, I put the entire wedding together, did I not? Hey, Lloyd.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know these people? I've been playing the church circuit here.
SUPMALE:This here's the best game.
LEADFEMALE:It's got the big pots, and the numbers come fast.
OTHERFEMALE:Stick close to me 'cause things could get hairy.
LEADMALE:Hairy? This is the game where you put the bean on the card, right? Hey! Arnie, what are you doing here? I'm going to be the caller.
LEADMALE:Ha! You're kidding me.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:There's lots of money in bingo.
SUPMALE:The problem is all the callers are boring.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll make it fun.
LEADFEMALE:I'll become a celebrity.
