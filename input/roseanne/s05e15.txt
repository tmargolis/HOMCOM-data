OTHERMALE:He gets enough wrong information from me and your dad.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if he'd actually read something once in a while, He wouldn't be such an easy target.
LEADMALE:You know, I think his picture's probably Under "gullible" in the dictionary.
OTHERFEMALE:See, that just goes to show how much you know.
LEADFEMALE:"gullible" isn't even in the dictionary.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it is.
LEADMALE:No, I just read this whole story in reader's digest Where they said, "can you even believe That 'gullible' is not listed in the dictionary?" Oh, really? We'll see about that.
LEADMALE:It's good to see that the classics still hold up.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.

SUPFEMALE:Well, i'll tell you what you didn't expect.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't expect to be dishing loose meat sandwiches Over at the Lanford days this weekend, But that's exactly what you're gonna be doing.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to be kidding.
LEADMALE:Case closed, Darlene.
LEADMALE:How close do I have to get to the meat? Well, you have to Sell it and serve it And kiss it and love it.

OTHERMALE:Huh.
SUPFEMALE:I'd never thought about it that way before.
SUPMALE:Oh, and now you do just 'cause she said it? All of a sudden you're a vegetarian? Well, i'm vegetarian-like.
SUPMALE:What the hell does that mean? I'm eating a lot more chicken.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot.
SUPFEMALE:Chicken's a vegetable.
LEADMALE:You even argue when I agree with you.
SUPFEMALE:You're not agreeing with me.
LEADMALE:You're agreeing with her, who happens to agree with me, Which makes me want to rethink my whole position.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Darlene.
LEADMALE:Oh, give me a break.
LEADMALE:You're probably just saying you're a vegetarian 'cause you heard somewhere Shannen Doherty might be one.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADFEMALE:All right, sparky, you made me chase her away, So now you're in charge of handling the meat.
LEADMALE:Story of my life.
LEADMALE:Just wait till you see this puppy in action.

SUPFEMALE:I got to be honest with you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think these guys are gonna approve you.
OTHERMALE:Well, sure, they will.
LEADFEMALE:They always do.
LEADMALE:Everything I own is on time payments.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe that's your problem.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think this tub Is way beyond your means? Of course it is.
LEADFEMALE:If I lived at my means, my life would be crap.
LEADMALE:If you lived at my means, your life would be crap.
