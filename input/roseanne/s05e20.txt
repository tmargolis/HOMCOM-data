LEADFEMALE:Oh, man! She's just doing it 'cause she loves you, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure, she says that, But she knows I don't have any money To buy her anything nice.
LEADMALE:If she really loved me, she'd buy me crap.
LEADFEMALE:This is love! Oh, Dan, she knows you're broke, But you could at least get her something thoughtful.
OTHERMALE:Don't you think I wanted to? This was always second on my list.
OTHERMALE:Anything but a shoe rack.
LEADFEMALE:Shoe rack.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't think practical, Dan.
SUPMALE:Think romantic.
SUPMALE:I know you're no good at it, But it's not your fault.
LEADMALE:You're a man.
LEADFEMALE:Probably why my shoes don't match my bag.
LEADMALE:We've been shopping all day.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you just get mom that big Crystal thing? 'cause it costs too much, Deej.
LEADMALE:Everything costs too much.
LEADMALE:There's a valuable lesson to be learned here, son, And I think you can profit from it.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy's in big trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Big, big trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's give it up for a while.
LEADFEMALE:I want to go use aunt jackie's gift certificate.

OTHERMALE:You know, black is very slimming.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not here 'cause i'm big.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here 'cause i'm tall.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPMALE:Then that jacket makes you look very short.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you think? Under 100 bucks? Sold.
LEADMALE:I'll just take a minute and pin these up, And you'll be out of here in a sec.
SUPFEMALE:Man, you guys do a great business here.

OTHERMALE:Well, the recession's still on, But I think that fitness craze is finally starting to pass.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm actually shorthanded.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? You hiring? Why? Are you interested? Well, I gotta tell you, It's always been kind of a dream of mine To work in a place like this.

SUPFEMALE:Well, then this probably isn't for you, Because i'm only looking for someone till June.
OTHERMALE:Perfect.

LEADFEMALE:I'll look cheap.
LEADMALE:Rosie, I searched all through the closet and I couldn't find it.
SUPMALE:Well, it's a wonder you can find anything in that closet, With all them shoes cluttering everything up.

SUPMALE:Except without the great thing and the really nice "I love you" part.
SUPMALE:What? So, you're really gonna work? I tried everything I could to get out of it.
LEADFEMALE:I got no choice.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, yeah, you do.
SUPFEMALE:Quit! I can't.
LEADMALE:I promised i'd be there.
LEADMALE:What? You're keeping a promise To some guy that you knew less than two weeks And breaking a promise to your wife of 20 years? This is a very special anniversary, Dan! It's a temporary job, for god's sake! Look, you don't want to say any more.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I want to say plenty more! I can't believe that you're doing this! I mean, you're the most selfish man in the entire world! You don't care about me! You don't care about I mean, all you care about is you! You think i'm so selfish? You think I only care about myself? You want to know why I can't quit my stupid little job? It's 'cause I had to pay for this! It's my wedding ring.
SUPMALE:Yes! Your wedding ring! Oh, baby, are you in deep now! Come on.
LEADMALE:You got something else to say? Who the hell asked you to do this? What? Well, you wrecked it! Did I ever once ask you to change anything about this ring? Did I? Huh? No! Well, I hope you're happy now, Because you ruined my ring just like you ruined my anniversary! Oh! Oh! Man, you are something else! I took a job where I gotta spend all day Asking fat men whether they dress left or dress right To pay for that ring, And it means nothing to you! Oh, you only took that job So that you could go buy that ring Because you knew you were gonna be working on my anniversary And you needed to get that ring so I wouldn't be mad at you! You are insane.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go out tonight and do exactly what I did The night before our wedding I'll be with my friends getting drunk.
LEADFEMALE:You weren't with your friends.
OTHERFEMALE:You were with your mom.
SUPMALE:My mom can drink my friends under the table any day! Hey, coach.
SUPMALE:Sorry I broke curfew, But if I get a little sleep, i'm sure I can play tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, I wouldn't go in there.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Ever? Not until I give you a little advice.
SUPMALE:But Jackie, I already took your advice.
LEADFEMALE:You told me not to get her the shoe rack or she'd be mad at me.
LEADMALE:What a relief that didn't happen! Let her cool down, Dan.
LEADMALE:She's really upset.
LEADMALE:Did you talk to her? She asked me if I knew about the ring.
LEADFEMALE:And you said? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And then? And then she and I decided That I should spend the rest of the night on the porch.
LEADMALE:So you're locked out? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Good news-you don't live here! I was waiting for you, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to help you out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, help me out some more.
LEADMALE:I'm still breathing! I didn't ask to get dragged into this! No, Jackie, you never ask.
LEADMALE:You just dive right in.
LEADMALE:And the best part is, she hates the ring.
OTHERFEMALE:I know it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, give it to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna take it back.
LEADMALE:Maybe they can put the ring back like it was And then all you have to do is pay for the labor.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Do it.
SUPMALE:You gotta look on the bright side.
LEADFEMALE:If you hadn't given me bad advice And I hadn't taken it And the anniversary wasn't wrecked And Roseanne wasn't mad at me, I wouldn't get to spend the night on the porch.
LEADMALE:So, what do you think? I think the shirt looks great on you.
SUPFEMALE:I came in with the shirt.
SUPFEMALE:I tried on the pants.
LEADMALE:I think the pants really bring out the shirt.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? Well, I wasn't done yelling at you yet.
LEADMALE:You know, I thought of a few more mean things to say, So I wanted to rush down here before I forget.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, I don't need this kind of insanity During the midnight madness sale.
SUPMALE:Well, I think maybe then we should take it outside.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
SUPFEMALE:I'm working.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then, i'll just start screaming here.
LEADFEMALE:Right behind you.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna kick your butt all the way to yogurt city.
SUPFEMALE:What's this? Happy anniversary.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:You got everything here.
LEADFEMALE:Corn dogs.
LEADMALE:You remembered our wedding dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:And Well, you know, i'm not very good at saying i'm sorry, 'cause you know I never am, But I just think I went too far this time And I just figure, you know, After 20 years, Every man deserves to hear this.
LEADMALE:I was wrong.
LEADMALE:And I think after 20 years, Every woman deserves to hear this-I agree with you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so, don't you have something to give me? Uh Come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'll say yes.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Promise.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, will you not be mad at me For giving the ring to Jackie to have it put back the way it was before? What'd you do that for? I loved that ring! Damn it, Roseanne! First you tell me you hate it, Then you tell me you love it.
LEADFEMALE:And then, and only then, I produce it from my pocket And show you that I got it back from jackie Before she took it back to the guy to have it put back.
SUPMALE:You may now eat the corn dog.
LEADMALE:Now I gotta give you your present.
LEADFEMALE:But you gotta promise that you won't laugh.
LEADMALE:Gadzooks! Why, Miss Conner, I can't marry you.
SUPMALE:I've fallen in love with another.
LEADMALE:You don't think it's stupid? You're beautiful, honey.
SUPMALE:Well, hell, I always thought you were beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:You really like it? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, good, 'cause I made you an appointment over there next week, So you might as well start shaving now.
SUPMALE:
