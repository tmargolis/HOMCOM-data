LEADMALE:Where are you pointing? The horizon.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you caught me at Darlene's, You've been working me like a dog.
LEADFEMALE:And the beauty of being a working dog Is that you don't get put to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:You know, all this punishment Isn't teachin' me a thing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Well, maybe you could learn a lesson If I would tell the big, strong, Fiercely protective Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner That you were shacking up With his daughter.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, how's my big, strong, Fiercely protective husband? Exhausted.
LEADMALE:But you'd still kill for me, right? Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Scrub brush.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll start here.
LEADMALE:David, this new obsession of yours With housework concerns me.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner's always said That a clean house is the devil's playground.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, that's true, But David feels, and I must agree, That cleaning is the least he can do for us After us taking him back After running away to live with-My mom.
SUPMALE:In Michigan.
LEADFEMALE:You remember.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:I know you probably had to do this kind of stuff To make your mom happy, But there's nobody here to be scared of.

LEADFEMALE:d.j. Thinks it's chia bread.
LEADFEMALE:You heard Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:He said take the rest of the day off.
LEADFEMALE:Well, isn't that funny? I thought he said, "if anybody has been messing around "with my daughter, I'm going to crush him like a beer can.
LEADFEMALE:" David, i'm done with this page.
SUPMALE:Hey, David, remember in Chicago When I caught you in Darlene's bathroom? Yeah.
