LEADMALE:Me, too.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to wash up.
LEADMALE:I got to make the kid's dinner for tomorrow night.
SUPFEMALE:I'd offer to help, But it would be a shallow, insincere gesture.
LEADMALE:Get lost, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man! I stayed up till 1:30 making this casserole.
SUPMALE:How come you didn't eat it? Gee, mom, I guess it wasn't a casserole kind of day.
LEADMALE:What did you eat? I wasn't hungry.
LEADFEMALE:What about d.j. ? Did he eat? Becky gave him cereal or something.
LEADMALE:Cereal? If he wanted cereal, There's plenty of cereal in the casserole.
LEADFEMALE:Did he brush his teeth or take a bath? I don't know.
LEADMALE:You put him to sleep? I didn't know I had that option.
SUPFEMALE:Where have you been? Out for pizza with Mark.
SUPMALE:You guys are totally useless.
LEADFEMALE:This place is a pigsty.
LEADFEMALE:Pick it up.
OTHERMALE:It's all Darlene's stuff.
OTHERMALE:These shoes are yours.
SUPMALE:The socks and sweat shirt are yours.
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:What about these magazines? Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:The porch is a big mess, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, real mature, mom.
LEADMALE:This family is falling apart, Dan.
LEADMALE:Tough to stop a moving train, honey.
LEADMALE:I can't work at the shop anymore.
LEADFEMALE:We've been through this.
LEADFEMALE:I got too much to do-The restaurant, the kids.
OTHERMALE:I quit.
LEADMALE:You can't quit.
LEADFEMALE:You're an owner.
OTHERFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
OTHERMALE:Well, then I'm fired.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do repair work and watch the shop.
LEADFEMALE:Something has to change around here.
SUPFEMALE:You guys get in here.
LEADFEMALE:How'd they get so spoiled When we've given them absolutely nothing? Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:We're having a family meeting.
OTHERFEMALE:What a bunch of crap.
LEADMALE:Those are the minutes of our last meeting.
LEADFEMALE:Now on to new business.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADMALE:, here's the deal-We're having a tough time now, girls.
LEADMALE:We're turning the corner on the bike shop, Which means we're killing ourselves.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't help, we won't make it.
LEADFEMALE:All right, dad.
SUPFEMALE:We're sorry we let you down.
OTHERFEMALE:Meeting adjourned.
LEADMALE:Darlene, don't, because no matter how lousy your life is now, we can make it much worse.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's what I see-Nothing's getting done around here Because nobody takes responsibility for anything, o.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:? So from now on, Becky, I'm leaving you in charge.
SUPFEMALE:I have a problem with that.
SUPFEMALE:Tough.
LEADMALE:I'm just supposed to do whatever she says? Listen to Becky like you listen to us.
LEADMALE:Um, now I have a problem.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you'll work it out.
OTHERFEMALE:Take care of your brother.
OTHERMALE:Make sure that he washes himself And does his homework.
LEADFEMALE:And you make sure that he eats, too.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to weigh that little boy every night.
SUPFEMALE:If he loses more than two pounds, it's your butt.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
SUPMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Now, go clean something.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Good idea.
LEADMALE:They're always crying We don't treat them like adults.
LEADMALE:Now we are.
LEADMALE:This may work.
SUPMALE:Are you insane? I just put Becky in charge.
LEADFEMALE:That's like putting fredo in charge of the CorLeone family.
LEADMALE:They may surprise us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:The family's doomed unless I get out of that shop.
SUPFEMALE:Once we sell a few bikes, maybe we can replace you.
OTHERMALE:If I sell a bike, I can get out of there? That's one way to look at it.
SUPFEMALE:I thought of us as more of a team.
LEADFEMALE:You and me against the world, husband and wife.
SUPFEMALE:Partners.
SUPMALE:Any bike, right? I know Duke has a bike, but you don't.
OTHERMALE:I don't need a bike.
LEADFEMALE:I ride behind Duke.
SUPFEMALE:That's how it'll be the rest of your life? You'll ride behind him? Not on his side, not equal to him, But like behind him? You have permission to smack her.
OTHERMALE:You ever think of getting a motorcycle? Roseanne, name me one guy That hasn't pictured himself on a big chopper Going down a country road with the wind in his hair.
LEADMALE:We've got some really great-The answer is me.
SUPMALE:I'm the guy.
LEADFEMALE:All I'm asking Is for one person to buy one lousy motorcycle.
LEADFEMALE:Is that too much to ask? Roseanne, what is your problem? I have all of your PMS days circled on my calendar.
SUPFEMALE:This is not one of them.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm just really stressed out, Leon.
LEADMALE:Oh, I understand.
LEADMALE:You need a little distraction.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever considered waitressing? All right.

SUPFEMALE:What's the matter with it? Like to sample our new fragrance? That's all I do all day long.
LEADFEMALE:Like to sample our new fragrance? God, I'm annoying.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, you begged me to pull some strings And get you that job.
LEADFEMALE:But I thought, make-up department, I'd do make-overs, like a cosmetician.
SUPFEMALE:You've got to work your way up.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you know how many squirt girls have to die before I make cosmetician? Fine, jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Try my life.
SUPMALE:work at the bike shop for no money, then come to this dump And work for Preppie the clown here.

LEADMALE:Where can I find somebody to stand in my restaurant And do nothing on such short notice? See what I have to put up with? Now this bike isn't for everybody.

LEADFEMALE:She's got to wrap herself around you real good Or splat.
LEADMALE:And the baby fits real snug Right here in the safety seat.

LEADMALE:God, that is so gross.
LEADMALE:After doing the laundry and vacuuming, There wasn't time to plan an exciting menu.
LEADFEMALE:I ran around all day picking d.j. up from school, taking him to get shoes, going to the supermarket-And when I get home, I expect a decent meal.
OTHERMALE:Don't they make a lovely couple? Remember when we were first married? We had bread and mayonnaise for dinner.
