LEADMALE:How are those apple pancakes? Oh.
OTHERMALE:They're perfect.
LEADMALE:Remember how I always made them for you When you were sick? Oh, you were so great.
LEADMALE:You would feed a fever and a cold.
OTHERMALE:You were such a horrible patient.
LEADFEMALE:I had to hide your medicine in your food.
LEADMALE:What kind of medicine? Oh, whatever I had That would make you drowsy.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Did you get all the stuff I wanted? Yes, my queen.

SUPMALE:Hi, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Jackie.
SUPMALE:Well, how are you doing? Well, even in the middle of an ugly divorce, life goes on.
LEADFEMALE:Fortunately I still have one daughter who asks me to visit.
LEADMALE:How can you even say that? She's treating you like a slave here.
SUPFEMALE:Which is more than I could expect from you, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
SUPMALE:Oh, happy birthday, d.j. Can you get out of bed yet? No.

LEADMALE:He's at that age where the whole world revolves around him.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:My little boy's becoming a man.

LEADFEMALE:I think he believed me.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:d.j. home? No.
SUPFEMALE:Where is he? I think my mom picked him up from school.
SUPMALE:I went to the school to surprise him by going out for ice cream.
LEADMALE:I guess you had to eat the ice cream by yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to make his day special.
SUPMALE:It's his 10th birthday.
LEADFEMALE:You got more tape? I'll go get it.
SUPMALE:You've been throwing your back out since you were 15.
SUPFEMALE:No kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Shouldn't you do something about it? What would you suggest, Jackie? Well, when I was injured in the line of duty-Oh, please.
LEADMALE:You fell down a flight of stairs.
LEADMALE:Stop making it sound like you threw your body on a live grenade.
LEADMALE:I hurt my back is the point, And I have always found exercise to be the answer.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Well, that's great.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you jog out into the kitchen and make me some hot chocolate? They just pulled up.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you want the video game? On top? No! Put it under the bed.
LEADMALE:We're going to make him open all the other presents first, then when he starts whining and being bratty about how he didn't get the video game, then we'll give it to him And then he'll feel really stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Most parents would just give him the gift.
LEADFEMALE:Mom! Mom! Guess what grandma got me! What? Super nintendo! I know it's a little extravagant, but he seemed to want it so much, we stopped off on the way home.
LEADMALE:Dad, help me hook it up.
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Don't you want to open your other presents? Later.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'll just get started on the birthday cake.
LEADFEMALE:Make sure you put some extra medicine in Dan's piece.
OTHERMALE:This is really great, grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Becky, I wanted everything to be special for d.j. Can I go now? No.
LEADMALE:You're not playing video games till you've had your birthday cake.
OTHERFEMALE:how's it going in there? Fine, dear.
LEADMALE:Is Dan still mad? No, Rosie.
LEADMALE:Everything's good.
LEADMALE:Is he lying, Jackie? No, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:He's fine.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
OTHERMALE:Dan, I'm really sorry that I didn't check with you first.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry about it, Bev.
LEADFEMALE:I can take it back and get him something else.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't keep that anger all bottled up.
OTHERMALE:You'll just get diarrhea.
LEADMALE:I said I'm fine, Darlene.
LEADMALE:How's the job, Becky? Why? Because I'm changing the subject, Becky.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they moved me up to the express line.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? They must have a lot of confidence in you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:All I have to do is count to 10.
LEADFEMALE:Don't wear mittens.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll slow you down.
LEADMALE:Mother! Well, it was funny, Becky.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you're all laughing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one who's got to go back there tonight.
LEADMALE:You're working pretty hard these days.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm saving up to buy a car.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's matching me dollar for dollar, So I'm trying to break the bank.
OTHERFEMALE:What about your schoolwork? Oh, I'm doing it.
LEADFEMALE:And your social life you can't be having any fun? Well, I guess I don't see Mark that much.
LEADFEMALE:Nice going, Bev.
LEADMALE:You gave away the plan.
LEADMALE:It just seems like such a shame.
OTHERMALE:Can we do the cake now? Of course, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to What happened, did you forget the words? He took off.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll have his piece.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Becky, all these years I've been driving your grandfather's hand-me-downs.
LEADMALE:It's time I had a new car of my own.
LEADFEMALE:But the one I have is in very good condition.
LEADMALE:Weren't you making coffee? In a minute, dear.
SUPMALE:Becky, you don't have a car, And soon I'll have one too many.
LEADFEMALE:Bev.
LEADMALE:Dan, she's got years ahead of her where she'll have to work.
LEADFEMALE:Let her enjoy herself while she's young.
SUPMALE:Shouldn't you use that car for a trade-in? It's your father's money, dear.
LEADMALE:It's my pleasure to spend it.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? We have an arrangement.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I can get a car for nothing.
LEADMALE:You'll get a car by working for it.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, if I have a car, it'll be easier to get to work.
OTHERFEMALE:Bull.
OTHERMALE:The minute you get a car, you'll find some reason to stop working.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you think that.
OTHERFEMALE:That's so unfair.
SUPFEMALE:We had a deal.
SUPFEMALE:Grandma's deal is better.
LEADMALE:It's better to earn something than to have it handed to you.
LEADMALE:Nothing's ever been handed to me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right! Like your life just stinks! It would make me happy to do this, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I had these kids-just to make you happy.
SUPMALE:Aren't you being a little unreasonable? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:At least go up and talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:You do it! You're doing such a great job deciding what's right and wrong for my kids, they don't need me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I could use a new car.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
LEADMALE:You didn't have to come down tonight.
SUPFEMALE:I had some paperwork.
LEADFEMALE:You going to let Becky have the car? You know about that already? She called me after you left the house.
SUPFEMALE:What advice did you have for her? I asked why she wanted an old-lady car.
LEADFEMALE:Interesting approach.
LEADMALE:They worked it all out without you.
SUPFEMALE:What did they work out? Your wife gets grandma's car, and Becky gets your wife's old car.
LEADMALE:but Becky keeps working, and you're still going to pay half when she gets a better car.
SUPFEMALE:They leave me any cake? Dan? In here.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Bev, this is Mark.
LEADMALE:Mark, this is Becky's grandmother.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Is this the boyfriend? It is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I understand what Becky sees in you.
SUPMALE:You look like that Fonzie fellow who's so popular these days.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, nice meeting you.
SUPFEMALE:See you tomorrow, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:aaay.
SUPFEMALE:Aaay.
LEADMALE:Aaay.
LEADMALE:You came down here to get away from me, and here I am.
OTHERMALE:I had some work to do.
LEADMALE:You know, as I was buying d.j. that gift, I just knew I was doing the wrong thing.
SUPMALE:But while we were in the car, he asked me if grandpa married this other lady, would she be his grandma, too? Ouch.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:So I started to think that without grandpa Al, maybe I wouldn't be as welcome.
LEADMALE:He's always been fun for the kids.
LEADMALE:All I ever seemed to say is, "Get your finger out of your nose.
LEADFEMALE:" So I was just going for a little extra popularity.
LEADMALE:Well, you know what? I guess I was, too.
LEADMALE:I mean, it isn't often that I can afford to get something nice for my kids.
LEADFEMALE:I had two shots today and you aced me out of both of them.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I yelled.
SUPFEMALE:That's o.
OTHERMALE:k.
SUPMALE:It made me feel like part of the family.
OTHERFEMALE:If it makes you feel any better, the kids don't like grandpa any more than they like you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:And I've got an idea.
LEADFEMALE:Until Roseanne's back is better, I'll just take care of my kid, and you can take care of yours.
OTHERMALE:Deal.
LEADMALE:I'm not sure you ever knew this, but I wasn't too thrilled when Roseanne married you.
SUPMALE:You wore black to the wedding.
LEADMALE:But I have to say, you've turned out to be a wonderful husband and father.
SUPFEMALE:And? And what? What do I get? What do you mean? Come on.
LEADMALE:You gave Roseanne a car.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dan No.
OTHERFEMALE:All I need is a A TVbig screen.
LEADFEMALE:and a satellite dish.
LEADMALE:I will fix the car, Becky.
SUPFEMALE:You always fix it, and it always breaks down.
LEADFEMALE:It's temperamental in cold weather.
LEADMALE:What's the point of having a car if it won't get me to work? Well, it'll get you close.
SUPFEMALE:I ought to take it to the junkyard and sell it.
LEADFEMALE:It'll never get you that far.
SUPFEMALE:This stinks.
SUPFEMALE:You'll get a new car when you earn it.
LEADMALE:Until then, this is better than the bus.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the bus gets better mileage.
LEADFEMALE:You're not helping.
LEADMALE:Becky, you've been griping to drive that car ever since you got your license.
LEADMALE:Now it's yours.
OTHERFEMALE:You get grandma's car, and I get your bomb.
LEADFEMALE:What can I say? My mommy's better than your mommy.
OTHERMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:How you doing? Two more swords and I'm queen of the monkey people.
OTHERFEMALE:I meant your back.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I can't do the laundry, and I'm not making dinner.
LEADMALE:So why do you ask? 'Cause you've got a doctor's appointment.
LEADMALE:I don't want to go.
LEADFEMALE:He's not going to hurt you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, he will.
OTHERFEMALE:He'll tell me I'm fine, And then he'll tell me I should do the laundry.
SUPFEMALE:You'll just have to risk it, dear.
SUPMALE:Why are you making me do this? Because I love you.
LEADMALE:You just want me to get better.
LEADMALE:Keep moving.
SUPMALE:I want my mommy! Grandpa Al, it's Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, really.
SUPMALE:I know I haven't called you that much, but, you know, grandma was here and she was talking about you, So I got to thinking-What did she say? Oh.
LEADMALE:It's not important, and I didn't believe any of it anyway.
LEADMALE:She's really sucking up.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, Becky got a car, and d.j. got this really expensive video game.
LEADFEMALE:No, I didn't get anything.
LEADMALE:I don't know probably because I stuck up for you one too many times.
LEADMALE:But, hey, what's right is right.
LEADFEMALE:So when are you coming into town?
