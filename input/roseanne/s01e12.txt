LEADMALE:i haven't had one day off since the day i married you.
LEADFEMALE:sure you have.
LEADFEMALE:oh, i have not.
LEADMALE:what about our honeymoon? what honeymoon? eighteen hours on your cousin's houseboat does not a honeymoon make.
OTHERFEMALE:i happen to recall that that was a veritable lovefest.
SUPMALE:oh, come on, we never had a real honeymoon, and you know it.
LEADMALE:it's the one missing piece in an otherwise picture perfect romance.
LEADMALE:roseanne, are you saying that you want a honeymoon? no, i'm saying i wanna be tarred and feathered.
LEADFEMALE:come on, babe.
LEADMALE:we got two jobs and three kids.
LEADFEMALE:we ain't got the time.
LEADMALE:well, we could make time.
LEADMALE:i bet each of us could get a week off next month.
LEADMALE:you're really serious about this, ain't you? no, i just brought it up to complicate your life.
LEADMALE:all right nothing complicated about that.
OTHERMALE:we'll go on a honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:where are we gonna go? well, i'll call my cousin and see if his houseboat's free.
LEADFEMALE:i wanna go someplace romantic.
LEADFEMALE:are you saying i can't pick something romantic? yeah.
SUPMALE:you are not romantic at all.
LEADFEMALE:i am a hopeless romantic.
SUPFEMALE:well, you're hopeless.
OTHERMALE:i am the king of romance.
LEADFEMALE:that's because you learned it from the queen.
SUPFEMALE:oh, yeah? yeah.
LEADMALE:are you saying that you're more romantic than i am? i most "soitenly" am.
OTHERFEMALE:all right, your royal highness, i'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:you pick a honeymoon spot, i'll pick a honeymoon spot, then we'll see which one's the most romantic.
LEADMALE:you're on, beef boy.
LEADFEMALE:hey, rosie, what if we both wind up picking the same thing? it'll mean we're actually meant for each other.
LEADMALE:no, it won't mean that.
SUPMALE:you know what would be my idea of a perfect honeymoon? mel gibson and a stick of butter.
LEADMALE:i'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:no, it'd be an entire month on a greek island in a quaint little house up in the mountains but not too far away from the beach.
SUPMALE:ah, that sounds real good.
SUPFEMALE:the only thing that's missing is your husband.
LEADFEMALE:that's why it's the perfect honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:oh, i get it.
LEADFEMALE:hey, darlene, you're late.
LEADFEMALE:i know.
LEADMALE:i got hung up at school.
SUPMALE:two people already's been calling looking for their newspapers.
SUPFEMALE:damn.
SUPMALE:well, there's no need to cuss, for hell's sake.
LEADFEMALE:bring it out.
LEADMALE:i'll help you fold them up.
LEADFEMALE:thanks.
OTHERMALE:here.
SUPFEMALE:i'll fold the rest.
LEADMALE:all right.
OTHERMALE:sis, make yourself useful, huh? so, you gonna watch our kids when me and dan goes on our honeymoon? sure, but you're not gonna go anywhere.
LEADMALE:so now you're reading the future, right? now you got e.
OTHERMALE:s.
LEADFEMALE:p.
LEADFEMALE:every time you and dan plan a trip, something happens.
LEADMALE:and you know why that is? oh, enlighten me, swami nanda.
LEADFEMALE:because you don't really wanna go, because you think that nobody can survive without you.
SUPFEMALE:well, they can't.
SUPMALE:because you think you're the center of the universe.
LEADMALE:well, things do revolve around me.
SUPFEMALE:hi, aunt jackie.
LEADMALE:hi, kiddo.
SUPMALE:hey, how was school? all right, except for biology.
OTHERMALE:mr.
OTHERMALE:hodges is making us dissect a frog in lab.
LEADMALE:i remember when we had to do that.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, me, too.
SUPFEMALE:i'm in class with this big guy.
SUPMALE:he's on the football team.
OTHERMALE:i cut into my frog, he goes down like a ton of bricks.
LEADMALE:you know, cold faint, cuts up his chin.
OTHERMALE:really? ask your dad to show you his scar.
LEADFEMALE:well, you guys may have done it, but i think it's morally wrong to hack up poor, defenseless animals.
LEADFEMALE:the frog's already dead by the time you're hacking on it, ain't it? but if i didn't have to dissect it, they wouldn't have to kill it.
OTHERMALE:if you don't wanna do it, don't do it.
LEADFEMALE:but then i'll flunk lab and bring my "a" average down to a "c.
SUPFEMALE:" becky, if you feel strongly about something, you shouldn't do it.
OTHERFEMALE:you won't get mad if i get a "c"? the only time i'd ever get mad at you is if you're doing something that you know is not right.
OTHERFEMALE:thanks.
LEADFEMALE:i got it.
LEADMALE:if that's one of my customers, tell 'em i'm already gone.
SUPFEMALE:hello.
SUPMALE:oh, hi, mrs.
SUPFEMALE:clyde.
LEADMALE:she'll probably gonna call my boss and complain.
SUPFEMALE:your paper should be there any minute.
SUPMALE:okay, bye.
SUPMALE:darlene, you better move.
SUPMALE:she sounded angry.
LEADFEMALE:i'm moving, i'm moving.
OTHERFEMALE:becky, go wash up for dinner now.
OTHERMALE:oh, what are we having? frog legs.
SUPFEMALE:you're so demented.
LEADFEMALE:hey, baby, i'm home.
LEADMALE:hey, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:hey, jackie.
LEADMALE:hey.
SUPFEMALE:you gonna stay for dinner? are you serious? we'd love to have you.
LEADMALE:what's the matter with him? can't a guy have a good day once in a while? well, not that good.
LEADMALE:what are you smiling at, hot stuff? wellwait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:what's this in my pocket? it could be.
LEADMALE:it might be.
SUPFEMALE:it is.
LEADFEMALE:holy cow.
LEADMALE:it's a honeymoon.
LEADMALE:why, yes, it's paradise.
SUPFEMALE:another guy who thinks he's got paradise in his jeans.
SUPFEMALE:yeah, paradise lost.
LEADMALE:ahh.
LEADFEMALE:cackle, cackle, hens.
SUPMALE:baby, this place is perfect for us.
LEADFEMALE:it's romantic, it's secluded, and it's 400 miles from anybody who's ever seen us in our bathrobes.
OTHERFEMALE:oh! look at this.
LEADFEMALE:the lamont cabins, boulder lake, rhinelander, wisconsin.
LEADFEMALE:you're gonna take her camping? dAN: camping? we're talking luxury here.
OTHERFEMALE:these cabins got everything.
LEADFEMALE:electricity, hot water, full kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:well, full kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:gee, sis, that's just the getaway you've been looking for.
LEADFEMALE:we'll be dining at the lodge.
LEADFEMALE:well, maybe if we're lucky, we can get a table under the antlers.
LEADFEMALE:for your information, i talked to a guy down at the lumber yard who went to this place.
LEADMALE:said he had the time of his life.
LEADMALE:did he say what kind of time his wife had? he ain't married went there with a bunch of buddies of his.
OTHERMALE:geez, now, i don't have the intense lumberyard connections that you got, but i did manage to put together a honeymoon in, uh, the grand duchess hotel in sarasota, florida.
LEADFEMALE:"grand duchess resort hotel, sarasota, florida.
LEADMALE:" a-tha.
LEADMALE:it's the perfect honeymoon spot.
LEADMALE:it's warm and it's sunny.
LEADMALE:and not romantic.
OTHERMALE:what are you talking about? walking hand in hand on a beach.
LEADFEMALE:that ain't romantic? yeah, dodging seagulls and 10,000 sunburned tourists.
OTHERFEMALE:honestly, jackie, i ask you.
SUPFEMALE:is that romantic? well, coffee shop's open until 9:00.
LEADFEMALE:ooh! well, now, whose side are you on? i'm on your side.
OTHERFEMALE:and i'm on your side.
OTHERMALE:justjust pick.
LEADMALE:go anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:well, i'm not going there.
LEADFEMALE:there's not nothing for me to do in a place like that.
LEADFEMALE:what are you, nuts? there's plenty of stuff for you to do there.
SUPFEMALE:there's stuff for you to do.
LEADFEMALE:there's hunting, fishing, tracking moose.
SUPMALE:what am i supposed to do, forage for nuts and berries? can i make a suggestion? bOTH: no.
LEADMALE:honey, i'm just not gonna feel comfortable at someplace with palm trees and marble floors.
LEADFEMALE:well, do you think i'm gonna have fun at someplace famous for lightning bugs? there's only one way to settle it separate honeymoons.
LEADFEMALE:no.
LEADFEMALE:hmm.
LEADMALE:all right, i'll settle it.
SUPMALE:call it in the air.
LEADMALE:heads or tails.
SUPMALE:florida.
LEADFEMALE:hey, get your grubby paw out of that cereal box, would ya? i'm looking for the toy.
LEADMALE:well, i already took it out of there, see.
LEADMALE:if you're real nice, maybe i'll let you play with it.
LEADFEMALE:i'll be nice.
SUPFEMALE:liar, liar, pants on fire.
LEADFEMALE:you know, dan, it's not too late for you to change your mind and come with me to the remarkable sunshine state.
OTHERMALE:but, honey, there won't be no sunshine in florida.
OTHERFEMALE:i won't be there.
LEADMALE:oh, i guess then i'll just be sitting in my deluxe suite, crying out my eyes 'cause i can't share a concrete shower with four other cabins.
LEADFEMALE:i bet that's them old cabins right now wondering what color bug light you want.
LEADFEMALE:dARLENE: i got it! hey, are you all right? sure.
LEADFEMALE:why? well, you just walked by a ringing phone.
LEADFEMALE:mom, please, i have a lot of things on my mind.
SUPFEMALE:hodges is gonna make me rip the guts out of some frog.
LEADFEMALE:yum.
LEADFEMALE:more cereal, anyone? yes, please.
LEADFEMALE:i don't see how any of you can eat.
OTHERMALE:pass the milk.
SUPFEMALE:there you go.
LEADFEMALE:i still don't know what i'm gonna do, mom.
LEADFEMALE:you're gonna do whatever you feel is right, okay? you keep the faith.
LEADFEMALE:yeah.
SUPMALE:darlene, who was that? oh, it was mr.
SUPFEMALE:attleroy, my boss at the newspaper.
LEADMALE:and what did he want? he wants to see me after school.
OTHERMALE:i guess he didn't get his paper yet either.
LEADMALE:ah! well, mom, i did it.
SUPFEMALE:i told hodges i wouldn't cut up that frog.
SUPFEMALE:well, i bet that frog is pretty glad to hear that.
SUPFEMALE:yeah, but hodges wasn't.
LEADMALE:thanks to him, i got a "c" on my record.
SUPMALE:you ought to be proud of that "c," becky.
SUPFEMALE:i am.
LEADMALE:you put yourself on the line for that.
SUPMALE:it's not fair.
OTHERMALE:i'm the best student in the class, and everyone else is gonna get a better grade than me.
LEADFEMALE:than i.
LEADFEMALE:well, nobody's gonna do better than you in english.
SUPMALE:you know, when i told hodges i wouldn't do it, all the kids cheered.
LEADFEMALE:but then two seconds later, they started cutting up their frogs.
LEADMALE:what a bunch of hypocrites.
LEADFEMALE:well, becky, you are the best student in that class, and it's just too bad they don't give out grades for standing up for what you believe in.
SUPMALE:i still don't believe i got a "c.
LEADMALE:" becky, if you wanted an "a," you would've cut up that frog.
LEADFEMALE:but instead you did the right thing.
SUPFEMALE:the hip thing, the now thing, the happening thing, the '90S thing.
OTHERFEMALE:then how come i feel so lousy? i think it's 'cause your body's starting to reject the "c.
LEADMALE:" where be the white whale? arrgh! arrgh! arrgh.
LEADMALE:d.j. , let me know if they run.
LEADFEMALE:i'm gonna go upstairs and study.
LEADMALE:i can't afford to screw anything else up this semester.
OTHERFEMALE:hey, stick 'em up.
LEADMALE:don't try nothin' funny, partner.
LEADMALE:just hand me over that money.
SUPMALE:how much is this? i don't know, but it looks like a lot.
LEADMALE:what you gonna do with it? i don't know.
OTHERMALE:buy me something nice.
SUPFEMALE:what would you like? a honeymoon in sarasota, florida.
LEADFEMALE:what's a honeymoon? i don't know, i never had one.
LEADMALE:oh, darlene, mrs.
SUPMALE:clyde just called.
OTHERFEMALE:she said she's looked in all her puddles, and she still can't find her newspaper.
SUPFEMALE:well, that's not my problem anymore.
LEADMALE:and why is that? mr.
OTHERFEMALE:attleroy gave me the ax.
SUPFEMALE:well, darlene, now that you've got some free time, could i get a minute with you? can i at least get a snack before you chop my head off? no.
OTHERMALE:sit.
LEADFEMALE:all right, start talking.
LEADMALE:well, it's a long, boring story.
LEADFEMALE:that's a good beginning.
LEADFEMALE:keep going.
SUPMALE:well, i figured a paper route was an easy way to make some money.
LEADFEMALE:darlene, there's no easy way to make money.
OTHERMALE:if there was, your mother would've found it by now.
OTHERFEMALE:let's face it, darlene.
LEADMALE:you quit on that job a long time before attleroy fired you.
LEADFEMALE:maybe i did.
SUPMALE:you did.
LEADFEMALE:all right, but i'm 11 years old.
LEADFEMALE:i figured why not enjoy myself.
LEADMALE:i can live on my allowance for a few more years.
SUPFEMALE:i guess you ain't heard about the lay-off then, huh? me and your daddy can only afford to support two kids now.
LEADMALE:well, who's gonna tell d.j. ? hey, you're gonna be proud of becky.
SUPMALE:why's that? because she took a "c" in biology, rather than commit animal genocide.
LEADMALE:good for her.
OTHERMALE:hey, i got four "c"S and nobody congratulated me.
LEADFEMALE:"c"S come easy for you, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:becky really had to work for her "c.
SUPMALE:" well, the first one was the hardest for me, too.
SUPMALE:you know, dan, i really adore your kids.
LEADMALE:yeah? i'd say we're three for three.
SUPMALE:you know, i think our first real try was on my cousin's houseboat.
LEADMALE:the only thing i was really trying to conceive on that houseboat was an escape route.
SUPFEMALE:you guys busy? no, we were just sitting around waiting for you to show up.
SUPMALE:you know, every time you arrive, it's the highlight of dan's day.
LEADMALE:well, it is today, 'cause i've been spending a lot of time since yesterday thinking about your guy's honeymoon.
SUPFEMALE:you ain't going with us.
SUPMALE:on the contrary.
LEADFEMALE:you guys have been arguing about it for 15 years.
OTHERFEMALE:you're gonna spend the next 15 years arguing about it.
LEADMALE:so i've decided that since you guys weren't gonna take one, i was gonna give you one.
SUPMALE:what are you talking about? i booked a suite for the weekend at wizard world.
SUPFEMALE:oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:wizard world.
LEADFEMALE:home of the wacky, wiggling worm water ride.
LEADMALE:boy, i bet you never thought we would be spending the weekend there, huh? not weally.
LEADFEMALE:jACKIE: oh, forget it.
LEADMALE:you guys aren't going.
OTHERMALE:becky!darlene! d.j. !front and center! what are you up to? i'm running away for the weekend, and i'm taking your kids with me.
LEADMALE:you guys get to stay in the house and have your honeymoon.
OTHERFEMALE:you mean? ooh, i have to be alone with you? ooh! a girl, ooh! and you better make the most of it, too, because this is the last anniversary present you're getting for the next ten years.
SUPFEMALE:oh, that's so sweet.
SUPFEMALE:thank you, sis.
LEADFEMALE:you guys, pack your bags 'cause we're going to wizard world.
OTHERMALE:all right! wizard world? for the whole weekend.
SUPFEMALE:are mom and dad coming? no.
SUPFEMALE:rosie, what are you doing? don't you worry about it.
SUPMALE:you ready to start? i guess so.
LEADMALE:this is weird.
LEADMALE:i keep waiting for a kid to come tearing through here.
SUPMALE:well, dan, now, we don't have any kids 'cause we're on our honeymoon.
LEADMALE:what are you doing? sit.
LEADMALE:okay, our honeymoon has officially started.
LEADFEMALE:it has? yeah, how do you like our honeymoon suite? i like it.
SUPFEMALE:it has a nice, homey lived-in feel to it.
LEADFEMALE:are you ready for romance? are you? i was born ready.
LEADFEMALE:nice touch.
SUPMALE:i didn't even get to the touching yet.
LEADMALE:now, would you like candlelight or candlelight? how about candlelight? okay, now, which one do you want? a rippling stream or a waterfall effect? surprise me.
SUPMALE:all right.
SUPMALE:there's one rippling stream.
OTHERFEMALE:that's nice.
OTHERFEMALE:a waterfall might be nicer.
SUPFEMALE:you got it.
SUPMALE:watch out for the mist.
OTHERFEMALE:so this is the honeymoon i've always wanted.
LEADMALE:niagara falls!
LEADFEMALE:
