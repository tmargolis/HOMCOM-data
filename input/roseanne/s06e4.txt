OTHERFEMALE:Did you tell Dan about it yet? No.
LEADMALE:He's in such a bad mood from work, I'm afraid of what he would do to David.
SUPMALE:Well, just get him in a really good mood, And then you tell him.

LEADMALE:I will just wait for the perfect moment.

OTHERFEMALE:The guys at work are really ticking me off.
OTHERMALE:I can't get 'em to listen to me, To take me seriously.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so they're just like the kids.
LEADFEMALE:I can't afford to screw this job up, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's okay to fail when you're 25, But if you fail when you're 42, You're a serious loser.
LEADMALE:Now, that's not really true, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I just told you that when you were 25 To make you feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Great.

SUPMALE:I'm handling it.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're not.
SUPMALE:You're just gonna bottle all your anger up, And then you're gonna take it home And take it out on somebody there.
OTHERFEMALE:I got my anger out.
SUPFEMALE:I told him I was upset.
LEADMALE:He won't do it again.
SUPMALE:Yeah, he will.
OTHERFEMALE:Pretty soon, his lunch breaks Are gonna start being longer, And then his diseases will be more exotic.
LEADFEMALE:Then his relatives will start dropping like flies.
LEADFEMALE:You're wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I can handle him.
LEADFEMALE:I know him, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I am him, Dan.
LEADMALE:Now, you got to start getting tough.
OTHERMALE:You are gonna have to start cracking down On all these people that give you a hard time.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:You're fired.
LEADMALE:Wish you would have told me this 20 years ago.
LEADFEMALE:Stop it, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:You're really starting to annoy me.
OTHERFEMALE:Starting? What, have you been ignoring me all night? Look, you don't understand, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:When I came into this job, I had 30 guys under me Who were all mad they weren't made foreman.
LEADFEMALE:I can't fix every truck in the city by myself.
LEADMALE:I got to get these guys to like me So they'll work for me.
LEADFEMALE:That isn't how it works, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:People don't work for you because they like you.
OTHERMALE:They work for you because they fear you.
SUPMALE:That's the way you work, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:That's not the way I work.
LEADFEMALE:Every boss i've ever had Has been a total hard-ass jerk.
SUPMALE:I always swore I wouldn't be that way.
LEADMALE:If I become one of those guys, I'll be a hypocrite.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna deal with this my way.
SUPMALE:If you don't like it, that's tough.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, don't freak out.
SUPFEMALE:David's not the first kid to bring pot in the house.
SUPFEMALE:What? Jackie, this is gonna be your shortest visit ever! Well, you people argue so much, I get so confused.
SUPMALE:David was smoking pot in the house? What is this new obsession with David all about? David! I want to talk with you in the kitchen now! You want to see me get tough? No, Dan, not when you're so damn upset about pete.
LEADFEMALE:That isn't fair to David.
LEADFEMALE:I will handle it, okay? David should be killed for the right reasons.
LEADMALE:Don't forget, now.
LEADMALE:It can lead to other drugs And theft.
LEADMALE:And why do you think they call it dope? And if you got a couple of eggs, Fry those up and do the brain thing.
OTHERFEMALE:They never have an answer for that.
SUPFEMALE:Something wrong? David, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:David, Do you smoke pot? Me? No.
LEADFEMALE:Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:I would never.
LEADMALE:Twice.
SUPMALE:Well, I found this in your room today.
SUPFEMALE:Is that yours? Yes.
SUPMALE:Well, David, I guess I really don't need to tell you That drugs can ruin your life, Leaving you a physical, emotional, and spiritual wreck.
OTHERFEMALE:And I don't suppose that I have to tell you That you can receive up to 5 years in prison, According to the latest federal sentencing guidelines, And I know because I read that in outlaw biker magazine.
OTHERMALE:But I can tell you That there is a 12-year-old boy living here, And if you ever bring drugs in my house again, You're out, you got it? I think so.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have anything to add, Dan? You know, you should really get down on your knees, David, And thank us, Because a lot of people would not be this cool.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Well? Thank you for being so cool.
LEADFEMALE:See how low drugs have made you sink, David? This Is your brain.
LEADMALE:Dan, a pan.
LEADFEMALE:And this Is your brain on drugs.
SUPFEMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:Go to your room, David, While Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Connor and I decide your punishment.
SUPMALE:You really showed me, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I hope you took notes, Dan.
LEADMALE:Yep.
OTHERMALE:You were tough, you were firm, And now that David fears you, He'll never do that again.
LEADFEMALE:And he respects me, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Only one thing wrong.
SUPMALE:This is your pot, Roseanne.
OTHERMALE:What do you mean, that's my pot? See how low drugs have made you sink? Well, Dan, I think I would remember Hiding pot in the house.
LEADMALE:Not if you were stoned at the time.
LEADFEMALE:I hid it.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's just great, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:A very fine example you're setting for the kids, Stealing their mother's stash.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I didn't steal it.
SUPMALE:I put it away 20 years ago when we quit.
SUPFEMALE:We quit? I just thought we were out.
LEADMALE:Don't you remember? You were pregnant with Becky, And you told me to get rid of it.
LEADMALE:Then why the hell didn't you? I tried to flush it.
LEADFEMALE:But as I watched it float helplessly I thought to myself, am I really ready For this part of my life to be over with? Next thing you know, I was down on my hands and knees With an aquarium net and your hair dryer.
LEADMALE:Oh, god, Dan, I--I feel terrible.
OTHERMALE:I blamed David for pot that was mine.
LEADMALE:Do you think I owe him an apology? Well, he said it was his, So he probably has some, And now he's gonna get rid of it.
LEADMALE:We may be on to something here.
OTHERFEMALE:You could yell at him for something else And see what he confesses to.
SUPMALE:Have you guys decided on my punishment yet? Not yet, young man.
OTHERMALE:I hope you realize That you have put us into a very awkward position.
LEADMALE:I'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Not half as sorry as I am, mister.
LEADMALE:Felt good to apologize.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:David? Where are you? I can barely hear you.
OTHERMALE:I'm at a phone booth.
SUPFEMALE:The guy who lives here is letting me use it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why don't you just call from home? I didn't want your parents to overhear this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
SUPMALE:So what do you want, abuse or heavy breathing? I was just wondering If you might have left something behind in your bedroom-Your socks, your hairbrush, your marijuana? What are you talking about? I don't smoke pot.
LEADMALE:Dulls my hatred.
LEADFEMALE:I know you've tried it, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Well, i've tried sex with you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't mean i'm addicted.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if the pot's not yours and it's not mine, Then whose is it? All right, Becky.
SUPFEMALE:Becky? So then i'm off the hook.
SUPMALE:I'll tell your mom I took the blame 'cause I thought the pot was yours.
OTHERMALE:And she'll say, "well, if you thought it was Darlene's, That must mean she smokes pot.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, no.
LEADMALE:Not necessarily, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Connor.
SUPMALE:Oh, so she just sells it? No, of course not, but-But nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene is dead.
LEADFEMALE:When I see her, she's gonna need drugs to kill the pain.
LEADMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:It's mine.
LEADFEMALE:Very good.
SUPMALE:You know, the hardest part Is admitting you have a problem.
LEADMALE:Feeling nostalgic? No.
LEADFEMALE:I just hauled up the rest of my stuff from the basement, And wanted to make sure there was nothing incriminating left.
SUPMALE:Thought you threw out the stuff years ago.
LEADMALE:No, that was your stuff.
LEADFEMALE:"today is the first day of the rest of your life.
SUPMALE:" Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Who knew it was gonna be such a long, bad day? Still depressed about this David thing? Yeah.

LEADMALE:Today I was a real man.
LEADFEMALE:I took the bull by the horns.
SUPMALE:I fired pete.
LEADMALE:What for? Because you told me to.
SUPMALE:Well, Dan, you should always check with me Before you do anything that I told you to do.
SUPFEMALE:I did the right thing.
SUPFEMALE:I handled it exactly correctly.
SUPMALE:Man, I feel terrible.
OTHERFEMALE:When did it happen, Roseanne? When did we go from doing stuff To yelling at people for doing stuff? When did we get old? WellFor me, I guess it was, uh The first time I ever discussed the corns on my feet With a total stranger.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, can billy sleep here tonight? No.
OTHERMALE:He's rude, And I don't like his parents.
SUPMALE:Well, then, can I sleep over there? Yeah, sure.
SUPFEMALE:This is it.

SUPFEMALE:Maybe the stuff is too old.
LEADMALE:Did I just say that sentence out loud? We're stoned.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any more of those pudding pops? No, this is the last one, and it's mine.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I want it, Dan.

LEADMALE:It's really important to me what you guys think about me.
LEADFEMALE:And yeah, i'm not stupid enough to do drugs.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I tried it when I was younger, But i'm much too mature and smart now To do anything that stupid.

OTHERMALE:There's no eggs left?
