LEADFEMALE:Darn! What's the matter, Deej? This problem's impossible.
SUPFEMALE:I'm supposed to multiply And give the answer in base 2.
LEADMALE:You know, Deej, it's ironic.
LEADMALE:You're a kid; you're not supposed to have any problems.
LEADFEMALE:You go to school and they give 'em to you.
LEADFEMALE:Either help me or be quiet so I can work.
LEADMALE:The answer is 3.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
LEADMALE:Okay, you little freak, you're about to see your heart.
LEADMALE:Rosie, Rosie, a little help here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, back, back, back, back.
SUPMALE:You might think they're tame, but you gotta remember They're wild animals.
LEADFEMALE:The evil pinhead was in my room again.
OTHERFEMALE:I locked my door, but he must have gotten in through the bathroom.
LEADMALE:I didn't do anything.
LEADMALE:Cool, it worked! He put bath oil beads in my pockets So that when I sat down they'd break.
LEADFEMALE:I'm walking around school, Everybody's pointing at my butt and laughing.
OTHERFEMALE:For a moment I knew the pain of being Becky.
LEADFEMALE:I want him punished severely for this.
SUPMALE:Okay, bring me the cheese grater.
OTHERMALE:I'm serious, mom.
OTHERMALE:All right, all right, we'll ground him.
SUPMALE:Grounding him won't do no good.
LEADFEMALE:Alls he does is hang around the house anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, how 'bout a week with no video games? Honey, that would be perfect, but i'm on level eight Of super froggy quest and he's gotta show me Where the magic jewels are.
LEADMALE:These punishments bite.
LEADMALE:You guys call yourselves parents? You're supposed to be better at this.
OTHERFEMALE:So why don't you punish him? Really? What do you think, Dan? Bye, Deej.
LEADMALE:Just remember, you're at that awkward age Where you could be tried as an adult.
LEADMALE:I got it.
OTHERFEMALE:You have to wear a suit and tie to school tomorrow.
SUPMALE:In front of everyone? Gee, Darlene, why don't you just beat him up yourself? Don't like you, don't like you, Don't like you.
LEADMALE:Suit and tie, i'm impressed.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, i'm kinda proud of it.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, I woulda made him wear a dress.
LEADFEMALE:Too late.
LEADMALE:You only get one wish.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, can we close the shades? I feel real guilty playing in the daytime.
LEADMALE:Hey, this is the conner unemployment invitational.
OTHERFEMALE:I figure as long as we're all out of work, We might as well use our time productively.
LEADMALE:Well, this is stupid.
LEADMALE:Do I really have to do this? It's indian poker.
LEADMALE:Everybody can see your fifth card but you.
LEADMALE:How-so how do I know what to bet? Well, that's the challenge.
LEADMALE:It's not a game for the timid.
SUPMALE:I'll betA penny.

SUPFEMALE:You guys are smart.
LEADFEMALE:Being self-employed is the only way to go.

OTHERMALE:Yeah, when you wanted a ride somewhere, Wanted somebody to get you pizza, wanted somebody to do your homework.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least I made time.
SUPFEMALE:Well This takes a little more effort than a high school romance.
LEADMALE:You know, I live with Fisher, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Well, so maybe that's your problem.
LEADMALE:Maybe you and Fisher spend too much time together.
SUPFEMALE:I never would have moved in with no guy so damn fast.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you wouldn't, but this isn't you; it's me.
SUPMALE:And there's a real easy way to tell us apart.
OTHERFEMALE:You.
OTHERFEMALE:Me.
LEADMALE:You.
SUPFEMALE:Me.

LEADFEMALE:Just figure that out? Deja vu.
OTHERMALE:I am really angry with you, d.j. Those magazines are not for you to read.
LEADFEMALE:And you know it's wrong to go through other people's things.

LEADMALE:She is.
LEADMALE:I'm her oldest boy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, our principal.
LEADMALE:Cecil Alexander, Dan conner, d.j. 's father.
LEADMALE:We thought you were dead.

LEADMALE:Although this new dressing up phase Does concern us a little.
LEADMALE:Kids.
LEADMALE:But we don't discourage unorthodox dress here.
SUPFEMALE:We do discourage, however, our students from bringing Certain types of reading material to school.
LEADMALE:Well, I understand, Cecil.
LEADFEMALE:Something that might be perfectly normal And acceptable for adults wouldn't be okay for kids To bring to school.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but the filth that d.j. Was reading Couldn't possibly be considered okay anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:It's the most offensively sick piece of garbage I've ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you read the articles? I didn't see any articles in this.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a comic book.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. , you brought a comic book to school.
LEADFEMALE:Good boy! I can see I should have spoken to his mother.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look, I know it's wrong for kids To bring comics to school and read 'em in class, But hey, they're kids.
SUPMALE:I know it's not great literature-my god.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of diseased mind could create something like this? It's obviously some sort of cheap underground thing.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:Hey, I don't know where d.j. Got this, but you can be sure We don't allow things like this in our house.
LEADMALE:This is not the way we raise our children.
LEADFEMALE:Where did you get this? Darlene made it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Dan, my day dealing with the family Was an ice cream cone in the dirt.
LEADFEMALE:How was yours? Well, honey, I hate to top you, but I got a two-for-one.
LEADFEMALE:That obscene reading material d.j. Brought to school? Darlene's the editorin-chief.
LEADMALE:Take a look at this.
SUPFEMALE:It's really sick.
LEADFEMALE:It was a funny part.
SUPMALE:I'm serious, Rosie.
LEADMALE:What if darlene's disturbed? More than we thought.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Dan, have you seen some of the comic books That she buys lately? They're way more screwed up than that.
SUPFEMALE:Warped and depressing is what's cool now.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Finally Darlene's personality pays off.
LEADMALE:Hey, we had underground comics, but it wasn't like This crap darlene's doing.
LEADMALE:Ours were about depraved sex and massive drug abuse.
LEADFEMALE:This is a cry for help.
OTHERMALE:Well, who knows what they're about, you know? Who even wants to? The longer we don't know what's in Darlene's head, The longer we don't sleep in shifts.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, hold it right there.

LEADFEMALE:We had an argument this afternoon And he pushed me a couple times.
OTHERMALE:It's not fisher's fault.
LEADFEMALE:Then whose fault is it? I--I can't believe that you're saying this.

SUPMALE:There's no work.
LEADFEMALE:And I told him that he should look for a job at a bigger company, And he told me that I didn't believe in him, And he told me a million times when he gets in a mood like that That I should just walk away and I didn't.
SUPFEMALE:I just kept pushing him and pushing him.
LEADMALE:Don't say any more.
LEADMALE:What happened? Fisher beat the crap out of her.
