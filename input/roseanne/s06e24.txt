OTHERFEMALE:I need to know, bo, Does Vicky really love Sloan? Or is there a chance I can win her back? What are you doing? I'm watching my stories.
SUPFEMALE:Bo really loves Nora, but the court case is tearing them apart.
LEADFEMALE:And Cord is helping out Luna-Oh! I just dropped your baby.
LEADFEMALE:Shh! In a second! Oh, Jackie.
OTHERMALE:You're not gonna get what you want from these soap opera guys.
LEADMALE:They can only love you for an hour a day.
SUPFEMALE:'course, that is four times longer than Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Well, they may not really exist, but they're better than Fred.
LEADMALE:I am not gonna let this happened to you, Jackie.
LEADMALE:You're turning into that scary old lady down the block With the satellite dish and the tall grass.
LEADMALE:hey, Jackie! Get rid of him.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I came by to talk to Jackie.
LEADMALE:Think it's a good idea? Sure, you got your dental records, don't ya? I didn't mean to hurt her feelings, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I was gonna propose and everything, But it just seemed like a more sensible idea for us to live together.
LEADFEMALE:Well, aren't you just Jackie's knight in sensible armor.
LEADFEMALE:What's she been doing the last couple of days? She's been comparing you to these soap opera guys.
LEADFEMALE:Guess who's ahead? Oh, god.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose she wants me to be more like this guy.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:That guy's in love with his mailman.
SUPMALE:But maybe some of these other guys.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, I don't understand this romantic stuff.
LEADFEMALE:What am I supposed to do? I don't know, but you should do something just for her, real special.
OTHERMALE:Like what? I don't know! But it should be, like, you know, big and dramatic.
SUPFEMALE:She's always hated that beard.
LEADMALE:My beard? Hey, i've had this beard since high school.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know, but you were just wearing it then so you could look old.
OTHERMALE:Trust me, you don't need it no more.
LEADMALE:I always thought my beard made me look more interesting.
SUPMALE:You know, i've talked to a lot of women, And they say that the only interesting thing about you Is Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all right.
LEADMALE:I love this beard.
LEADMALE:But if you think shaving it off is gonna prove something to her, I'll give it a try.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:No problem.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what'd you do that for? I don't hate his beard.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I know, but it always kinda bugged me.
OTHERMALE:Who's your mommy? Huh? Who's your mommy? Maybe you'd have a better idea who his mommy is If his mommy would just give in and marry his daddy.
LEADMALE:Who's your annoying old hag, huh? So Fred didn't propose last time.
SUPMALE:I bet he would if the next time he came over, You were wearing a nice dress And maybe a little lipstick.
LEADFEMALE:He's a pig.
SUPFEMALE:He's a pig with a steady job.
OTHERMALE:Nothing but the best for your little girl, huh, mom? Why, it's Darlene and young David! I bought a rattle for the baby.
LEADMALE:Just thought i'd drop it off.
SUPMALE:Oh, David, how sweet! David's always thrilled to meet someone smaller than him.
LEADMALE:He's so cute.
OTHERMALE:I just love him.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you wanna hold him? Yes! Uh, it's just like a cat, right? Grab it by the back of the neck? That's a boy! Sure.
SUPFEMALE:There's a boy.
SUPFEMALE:Now what? Now just hold him and enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:oh, ho, ho Okay, i'm done.
SUPMALE:Oh How can you be done? Look at his little hat.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't he make you wanna have a baby? No, I don't like kids.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't even like myself till I was 14.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:So, you don't wanna have kids? I mean, I thought we were gonna be together.
SUPMALE:What if I want one? Well, you're gonna have to plant your seed somewhere else, farmer bob.
LEADFEMALE:So, what I want doesn't count at all? I mean, having my baby would be a wonderful way of saying how much you love me.
LEADFEMALE:Hearing you say that, David, my new goal in life is to die barren.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't be silly, Darlene.
OTHERMALE:Women were made to make babies.
LEADFEMALE:The end! Oh, god, not even you could believe that crap, right, David? Well, you all seem to be pretty good at it.
LEADMALE:So, what are you saying, it's a woman's job to have children? I mean, can you really be that sexist? Me? I am not sexist.
SUPFEMALE:I am much too frightened of women to be sexist.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then what did you mean? I didn't mean it was a job.
LEADMALE:I just think that it's every woman's satisfying, Fulfilling obligation.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:This is not my opinion.
SUPMALE:This is just nature.
LEADMALE:I mean, you can't see that 'cause you're just being irrational.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're right, David.
LEADMALE:I'm not being rational.
LEADMALE:I know, I must have my period or something, right? I would never say that, but are you? David, I just changed my mind about premarital sex.
LEADMALE:Darlene She always gets like that.
LEADMALE:Did I tell you I like his little hat? Stay away from my son.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't mind Jackie, David.
LEADFEMALE:I think her friend is visiting.
LEADMALE:What? What's the matter? Jackie just told me what you said to Darlene, and I cannot believe you.
SUPMALE:She didn't understand me.
LEADFEMALE:She said that you told her that having a baby Was her obligation.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess she did understand me.
OTHERFEMALE:women.
LEADMALE:How can she think i'm anti-woman? She's your wife.
LEADMALE:Compared to you, I am a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Compared to a woman, you're a woman.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe it just so happens that i'm secure enough with my masculinity To be a woman.
LEADMALE:Dave, your problem is women expect a lot from you.
LEADFEMALE:When you turn out to be just another guy, then they're all let down.
SUPFEMALE:You think it's better for women not to expect much of you? Sure, then any little thing you do, They love you for.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Mark.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't usually help me out like this.
OTHERFEMALE:We should talk more often.
LEADMALE:Yeah, i'd like to.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But right now, I gotta run upstairs.
LEADMALE:When I tell Becky I think you're a sexist jerk, It's gonna pay off big! Got another one for ya.
SUPMALE:Where'd you get that? I'm already washing every dish in the house.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, i'd like to help, but I think there's a game on.
LEADMALE:All right, enjoy yourself.
LEADMALE:I'm just gonna keep doing dishes.
LEADFEMALE:'cause I noticed that there's still some skin left on my hands.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you guys.
OTHERFEMALE:See, Dan? What'd I tell ya? He does have a weak and characterless chin.
LEADMALE:I gotta talk to Jackie right away BecauseI think I know what she wants.
LEADMALE:I been watching her soaps.
LEADMALE:Jackie? We gotta talk.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:Fred, You keep showing up, you think eventually i'll change my mind? Will you marry me? Don't you think we should leave? We should, but pipe down.
OTHERMALE:Fred, I don't feel like I can Give you an answer right now.
LEADFEMALE:That's good, 'cause I don't want your answer yet.
OTHERMALE:First I want to take you away, to a cabin by lake geneva.
SUPFEMALE:I rented a red one, right on the water, Just like the one you used to dream about when you were a little girl.
LEADFEMALE:And then, I want to sit in front of the fireplace, And I wanna drink champagne and just look at you.
LEADMALE:And I don't want you to answer me until midnight.
LEADFEMALE:Because that way, if you say no, I'll have had at least one perfect night with you.
SUPFEMALE:You can watch the kid, can't ya? Aw.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't know about you, But I had a tough time keeping a straight face through that one.
