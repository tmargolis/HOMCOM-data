LEADFEMALE:Baby Little baby.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right back.
OTHERMALE:I'm just gonna top him off.

LEADMALE:Lately it's been kind of hard for us to get any time together.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, who would have thought That a screaming, leaking bundle of smells Would kill the romance? I don't think it's the baby.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's just that Jackie Is a little hard to get close to.
LEADMALE:I mean, I know she hasn't had a lot of experience with men.
SUPMALE:What? Hey.
OTHERMALE:SoFred, you're worried That Jackie hasn't had enough experience with men.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, can you come here a minute? Well, trust me, Fred, You've got nothing to worry about.

SUPMALE:We could blindfold her And she could take one apart And put him right back together again.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Fred, you and Jackie Dropping the baby off here And going out on a date.
LEADFEMALE:Things getting serious between you two? Has she really been out with a lot of guys? Ah, Fred When doing a background check on a girlfriend, It's rarely wise to ask the brother-in-law.
LEADMALE:Especially when his wife is the ham-fisted Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Let me just say this about jackie's past.
LEADMALE:Hoo-ah! The head.
LEADFEMALE:The head! Oh, please, Jackie, haven't you noticed That i've gotten a lot better at this by now? I mean, d.j. 's neck is a lot less bent than becky's.

OTHERMALE:If he doesn't, of course we'll help her out.
LEADMALE:I've always believed in sticking by your family.
SUPFEMALE:But this is a last resort.
OTHERMALE:Fine, i'll do it.
LEADMALE:Take the baby back, he's wet.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You touched him last.
SUPMALE:It's the nicest place anyone's ever taken me.
LEADMALE:You deserve it.
OTHERMALE:Anyone who gives birth to a child of mine gets a free meal.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wow.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm glad I had your child then, 'cause, some of the guys i've dated I'd be lucky to get a bowl of pretzels and a beer at the lobo.
SUPFEMALE:So you had a lot of dates at the old lobo.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, boy, did I.
LEADMALE:Oh, look! They've got dancing on fridays.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, that's nice.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of guys wouldn't like to go dancing.
LEADMALE:Have a lot of guys taken you dancing? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Same guys who took you to the lobo or a whole fresh batch? Are you trying to ask me something? No, no.
LEADMALE:Not really.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Fred.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:You can ask me anything.
SUPFEMALE:You've seen me in the most embarrassing position imaginable.
OTHERMALE:And you were there when the baby was born.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay.
LEADFEMALE:How many men did you date before we met? You mean, dated at all or dated seriously? I mean seriously.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:I'd have to say just a few.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not that I mind If you slept with a lot of guys.
SUPMALE:Well, slept with, well That's not what you asked me.
SUPFEMALE:No, I guess it wasn't.
SUPMALE:Fred, don't worry.
OTHERMALE:It's not that many.
LEADFEMALE:I'd say Three a year.
SUPMALE:Since you were, what, 18? Okay, we'll go with that.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, that's not that many.
LEADFEMALE:Three a year for 20 years is 60.
SUPMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:God.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even know 60 people.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I didn't know all of them.
SUPMALE:You men have such a double standard.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure you've slept with a ton of women.
LEADFEMALE:Three.
SUPFEMALE:Three? Three, huh? Just the three? Yep.
SUPMALE:Just the three.
LEADFEMALE:Does it bother you that i've beenActive? Oh, look.
LEADMALE:Let's just talk about something else.
OTHERMALE:No, i've got a better idea.
SUPMALE:Let's not talk at all.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:No, I haven't had him.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Do you think that's a lot of people to have slept with? Well, yeah, for an amateur.
SUPMALE:It sounded even worse when he said he'd only been with three.
LEADMALE:Eww.
OTHERMALE:Three? That's what he said.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but, I mean, three? That's just so low.
LEADFEMALE:I men, he's 37 and he's single, And we both know he's not that choosy.
LEADMALE:I can't believe how he reacted to it.
SUPFEMALE:So why are you so surprised, Jackie? You think a guy wants to know that the woman he's with Has slept with 20 times more people than he has? You should have lied.
LEADFEMALE:I would never lie.
LEADMALE:Why not? I lied to Dan about how many guys I was with.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:He said he was with, like, seven women, So I figured that meant five.
OTHERMALE:And I was with six guys, so I said three, You know, to make sure to come in under his five.
LEADFEMALE:And you think that was good? I think that was brilliant.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal? Why can't the man just accept That maybe the woman's had more experience than him.
OTHERMALE:Because then he knows that she knows That he's not very good.
LEADMALE:Fred's good.
SUPFEMALE:He's perfectly good.
LEADFEMALE:Especially considering it's just the three.
LEADMALE:Perfectly good, huh? Where have you been, Jackie? Every man has to think he's the best.
SUPMALE:Well, i'm not gonna lie to him and I think in the long run, Fred would want me to tell him the truth.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Men want to hear that they're strong And handsome and smart.
SUPMALE:They do not like to hear the truth.
LEADMALE:Do you agree with that, David? Absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:If Darlene ever lied to me, I think i'd be really hurt.
LEADFEMALE:That isn't true, David.
LEADFEMALE:Remember how upset you got when she told you that you had poodle hair? She never said that to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe she was sparing your feelings, but I guess You feel a lot better now that you know the truth, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I do.
OTHERMALE:I feel a lot better.
OTHERMALE:What do you guys think of my hair? We think it's great.
LEADMALE:It looks just great.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's stunning.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, he asked to know the truth.
LEADFEMALE:And David, the truth is that your hair is a little odd.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you for being so honest, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, you know how everyone is telling you You're as thin as you were before you were pregnant? You're not.
OTHERMALE:Dan! Oh, my goodness.
LEADMALE:Come in.
OTHERMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:I suppose it's okay that you see me in my personals.
LEADMALE:We are family.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I keep forgetting that.

LEADMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I just ate.
LEADFEMALE:This'll be dessert.
LEADMALE:I got some pure maple syrup that I picked up when I came through vermont.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Dan, it's really wonderful of you to stop by like this, It really does Ed good.
LEADMALE:There's nothin' I like better than doin' Ed good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious.
SUPMALE:Ed's always sayin' that he wishes he could see you more often.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go, son.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Fall down on some of that.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, dad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure you boys have lots to talk about.
SUPMALE:Yeah, woman.
SUPFEMALE:Get back in that kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Your men are getting hungry again.

LEADMALE:Is that boy of your still playing hockey? When, dad? I said i'd take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:Look, i'm going over there tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna give her the $400 that you owe her.
SUPMALE:Are you gonna give me the money or is it gonna come out of my pocket? Danny, i've already talked the situation over with your mom.
LEADMALE:What situation? Well It hasn't been a really great year, okay? I've had a flat patch.
OTHERMALE:The office doesn't want to send me out so much anymore, I got a new family here.
LEADMALE:Tough.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got old responsibilities.
LEADFEMALE:Danny, are you gonna make a speech? Because if you are, I think we oughta get more chairs, We'll call the neighbors-I'm not gonna make a speech.
LEADFEMALE:What i'm gonna do is try to remind you of your obligations! I shouldn't have to do that! You're a grown man! Can you just calm down? Dad, she was cryin' on the phone.
LEADMALE:Danny, that's her way.
LEADMALE:Not like this.
SUPFEMALE:She was crying so hard I couldn't understand her.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes your mother gets very emotional.
OTHERMALE:And everything kind of gets out of perspective, you know? I mean, Danny, women have a tendency to do that, you know.
LEADMALE:Women have a tendency to get upset when you treat 'em like crap.
SUPFEMALE:You know your mother.
OTHERMALE:This is not about money, danny.
LEADMALE:Sometimes you're talking to her and she's just not all there.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:There's nothing wrong with mom.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say there was anything wrong with her.
SUPMALE:Who said there was something wrong with your mom? You know that she's had it hard.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
SUPFEMALE:This kind of stuff is not good for her.
LEADFEMALE:Danny If I could help her, I would.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, Roseanne said you might be willing To clean up your own mess, but I told her she was wrong.
SUPMALE:Come on, Danny.
LEADMALE:Don't.
SUPMALE:Don't leave mad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not mad.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not mad.
OTHERMALE:One thing about you, dad, You'll never let me down.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Still mad, huh? No, i'm not mad, Jim.
SUPMALE:Oh, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Fred.
SUPFEMALE:So many of you I get confused.
SUPMALE:Listen, Jackie.
LEADMALE:We need to discuss this.
LEADFEMALE:What's to discuss? I slept with 60 men.
SUPFEMALE:Most of them separately.
LEADMALE:I can vouch for that.
LEADMALE:I was there that night sellin' tickets.
SUPFEMALE:Will you quit giving me a hard time? I'm just trying to accept this.
SUPMALE:Fred, all the men that I have slept with And all the things that I have done in my past Have made me the person that I am today.
LEADMALE:The person that you were supposedly in love with.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, but all i'm-Not nothing.
SUPMALE:We're supposed to be adults.
LEADMALE:Right? And you know what really ticks me off, Fred? Is that I was honest and you didn't even appreciate it, And instead, you're punishing me.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:For god's sake, Jackie, I'm not punishing you, I'm just trying to be honest about how I feel about all of this.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're both a couple of idiots.
SUPMALE:Sorry, I thought we were being honest.
LEADMALE:Baby, what's the matter? What do you mean, "what's the matter?" Can't you imagine how scary this is to him? The big fuzzy thing is yelling at the milk machine? You know, i'm through discussing it, Fred.
LEADFEMALE:The next words I want to hear out of your mouth are an apology.
OTHERMALE:I'm not gonna apologize for the way that I feel.
LEADFEMALE:Then I don't have anything to say to you.
LEADMALE:Jackie.
SUPFEMALE:Stay out of it, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need your kind of help.
OTHERMALE:I am trying to form an honest, solid relationship here With the father of my child.
LEADMALE:Get the hell out of my way.
SUPMALE:Aw.
SUPFEMALE:Am I nuts, Roseanne? Wouldn't this bother Dan? Not at all.
SUPMALE:Dan knows how many men Jackie slept with.
SUPMALE:Come on, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:If Dan found out that you'd slept with a lot of guys, He'd be upset.
LEADFEMALE:No, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:I really don't think he would.
SUPMALE:Because we have known each other a lot longer.
LEADFEMALE:And Dan knows he doesn't have anything to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I am not worried.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't about me being insecure.
SUPMALE:No, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Because you have no reason to be insecure.
LEADMALE:Jackie's in love with you.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:And she had your kid.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh She also told me you're the best lover she's ever had.
LEADFEMALE:No Yeah, and that's like, the best of 60.
OTHERMALE:That is a lot of guys.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but that doesn't make any difference to you, does it, Fred? Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:Forgot his binky.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne, can you give us a second? Yeah, sure.
SUPFEMALE:I know you don't need my help.
SUPFEMALE:You're building an honest, solid relationship.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, i'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was wrong.
SUPFEMALE:So you're okay with this? Of course I am.
SUPFEMALE:I was never that upset about it.
LEADFEMALE:You weren't? No.
LEADFEMALE:How insecure do you think I am? The most important thing is, we were open and honest with each other.
LEADFEMALE:Fred, you're the best.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you don't have to say it.
LEADMALE:Well, so you're back.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Crystal brought by a whole case of maple syrup.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think you could get $400 for it? Roseanne, i'm kinda tired.
LEADMALE:What'd your mom do when you gave her the money? Did she do like she did last time and wash each and every bill? I didn't give her the money.
LEADFEMALE:I had to take her to the hospital.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:Is she okay? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I guess.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Did she have an accident or something? It's not that kind of hospital.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? When I got there, she was sitting outside in the rain.
LEADMALE:I don't even think she knew who I was.
LEADFEMALE:One of the doctors thought she might be a danger to herself.
LEADMALE:Well, I mean, is she gonna be okay? God, this is so weird.
LEADMALE:Did you have any idea about this happening at all? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to say.
LEADMALE:I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, did you get anything to eat? Did you have dinner? Want me to make you something? No.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:My god, honey.
LEADMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just-i'm gonna go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:
