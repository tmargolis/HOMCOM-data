LEADFEMALE: I said turn it down, toad brain.
SUPMALE:You're not my boss.
SUPFEMALE:I'll rip your face off from the inside, goon.
LEADMALE:You cannot harm me.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:So you really think it was cool, huh? Yeah, who said? Wow.
LEADFEMALE:I guess the whole school knows.
LEADFEMALE:What does the whole school know? Class picture.
LEADFEMALE:Fourth row, second from the left.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:Becky, you're giving the finger.
SUPFEMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. , go watch TV.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:The nerd flips the bird.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call you back, ok? Come on.
SUPFEMALE:You were just scratching your shoulder, right? Why is it such a surprise? Because you're a butt-kisser, and you never get into any decent trouble.
SUPFEMALE:I'm totally impressed.
OTHERFEMALE:Wrong, Jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Paul Revere and the Raiders, but Mark Lindsay was the singer.
LEADMALE:Like there was a Paul Revere.
SUPMALE:Read the back of the album.
LEADFEMALE:Paul Revere's the blond guy playing the keyboards.
SUPMALE:Why didn't he sing? Because Mark Lindsay sang better.
LEADMALE:How come it wasn't Mark Lindsay and the Raiders? Because Paul's mother let them practice in their garage.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Becky got a picture today, and she won't let me see it.
SUPMALE:It's just my class picture.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want him getting it all gross.
LEADMALE:Well, let me see it.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:See? I want to see.
LEADMALE:Me first.
SUPMALE:Why? 'Cause.
LEADMALE:No fair.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, where are you? You mean you can't see me? Look, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy's home.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Princess.
LEADMALE:Bud, kitten.
LEADFEMALE:Margaret.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, our anniversary with the big, greasy car part? You're fixing her car, and I won't have to drive her.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:We've had fun together.
LEADFEMALE:It's fun listening to you give directions.
SUPFEMALE:Speed up, slow down, turn left, turn right, date him, not him.
LEADFEMALE:I got the part I've been looking for.
OTHERFEMALE:All I got to do is figure out what it is.
SUPMALE:Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:This guy's giving the old one-digit salute.
LEADMALE:Yeah, where? Right here.
LEADFEMALE:It's very subtle, under the chin.
SUPMALE:There's another one around the back.
LEADMALE:Oh, look it, a double, the guy with the arms crossed.
LEADFEMALE:Bravo.
SUPFEMALE:Here's the guy adjusting his glasses.
SUPMALE:He's rubbing his eye.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, a mislead.
LEADFEMALE:Let me try to find one now.
LEADFEMALE:You thought it was funny when the other kids did it.
LEADMALE:But the other kids aren't my kid, right, Dan? Not to my knowledge, dear.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'll leave you guys alone since I know how disappointed you are in Becky.
LEADMALE:I think I'm getting a "D" in math.
LEADFEMALE:Go to your room.
LEADMALE:What's Becky doing? d.j. d.j. , go watch TV.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it's Becky.
LEADFEMALE:It's almost as good as his we're number one in the football picture.
LEADMALE:That was a classic.
LEADMALE:Your parents were so very overjoyed.
SUPFEMALE:They were so uncool.
OTHERMALE:I don't know, Dan.
LEADMALE:We ought to do something.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not punishing her for this.
LEADMALE:But we got to be parents.
SUPFEMALE:Not ours.
LEADFEMALE:We can't bust her for things we did.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but I mean, on one hand, I don't want her to think we approve, then on the other hand, I feel so close to her right now.
SUPFEMALE:Say, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, your son just gave Gilligan the finger.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
SUPMALE:Well, he's the reason they're still stuck on that island.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:d.j. , get in here, little buddy.
SUPFEMALE:Becky! Yeah? Have a seat.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, how could I explain this? Ah! Ok, this is the church, this is the steeple, open the doors.
LEADFEMALE:See the big guy in the third row? Don't stick him up in the air at anybody.
SUPFEMALE:Mom did when she was driving.
SUPMALE:Well, the idiot cuts me off.
LEADFEMALE:Scoot.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:I'm going to see if this fits.
LEADMALE:They've taken these pictures forever.
SUPMALE:You'd think the photographer was wise to it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, every generation thinks they're the first.
SUPMALE:You know that picture of Washington crossing the Delaware? The guy in back looks like he's rowing See? Now you think the painter would've caught that.
SUPMALE:So how much trouble am I in? Sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:So? So? This doesn't seem like you, Becky.
SUPFEMALE:Did you know these guys? Was it a dare thing or something? No.
SUPFEMALE:I just did it.
SUPMALE:I don't know why.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do it again, or you're going to get grounded.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Is that it? You're doing dishes tonight, too, and that's final.
LEADFEMALE:But, mom, it's my turn to do the dishes.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, nobody has to know that.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's correct, Amy.
LEADFEMALE:Fourth row, second from the left.
LEADMALE:Yeah, her name's Becky Conner My sister.
LEADMALE:I do, too, have a sister.
SUPMALE:She's just been in, uh reform school.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you want to hand me that dish? Got to go.
SUPFEMALE:Fingers needs me.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go Sis.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:That was Amy Williams.
LEADFEMALE:Her sister's a senior, and even she knows about it.
LEADFEMALE:Seniors are talking about me? Everyone is.
SUPFEMALE:It's like all of a sudden you're Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've always been cool But sometimes it's just Cooler not to flash how cool you really are.
LEADFEMALE:We should just get a new car.
OTHERMALE:That car was built the year Becky was born.
SUPMALE:It's got a lot of history.
SUPMALE:We bought it last year.
LEADFEMALE:It's got somebody else's history.
SUPFEMALE:We can't afford our own history.
SUPMALE:Let's get a used '81.
LEADMALE:Oh, an '81! Dream on! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hold on a minute.
SUPMALE:Uh, it's for "Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:" It sounds serious.
LEADMALE:Who is it? It's Becky's school.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:This is, uh, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Geez! Yeah, ok.
LEADMALE:I'll be there.
OTHERMALE:What? You and your finger just got suspended.
LEADMALE:Cool! Cool? You think it's cool I have to see the principal and take time off? You think that's cool, huh? Uh Mmm Becky.
LEADMALE:And don't be thinking you'll be laying around here on your butt and watch TV.
LEADMALE:There's plenty stuff to do around here.
SUPMALE:Dan, you'll be home fixing the car, right? Make sure she does it all.
LEADFEMALE:A minute ago you said it was no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that was before you got me in trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Now I got to go to your school.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to go to school.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, honey.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be all right.
OTHERMALE:If you run into that assistant principal who told me I wouldn't amount to anything, tell him Dr.
SUPMALE:Conner says hi.
SUPFEMALE:Will the following students please report to the administration office? Brian McDermott.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, I'm Rebecca Conner's mom.
SUPMALE:I'm here to see the principal.
LEADMALE:He'll be right with you.
LEADMALE:Please Take a seat with the other mothers.
SUPFEMALE:Finger? We're all fingers over here.
LEADMALE:Roseanne Harris? I used to be.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I don't believe it.
OTHERMALE:Neither do I.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, 15 years? It's at least that long.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't this weird, running into each other, especially at the principal's office? I'll tell you what's really weird.
SUPMALE:What? I don't have the foggiest idea of who you are.
LEADFEMALE:Anne Marie.
LEADMALE:Dixon? It's Mitchell now.
LEADMALE:Did you marry Chuckie Mitchell? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Who would've thought.
SUPMALE:You? Well You remember that good-looking blond guy that took me to the junior dance? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he dumped me.
LEADMALE:I ended up with Dan Conner.
LEADFEMALE:It's really good to see you.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Boy This place really brings back memories, like the time we got dragged in here for burning our bras, and you told Principal Leeb it was a political statement.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:Ya know, Anne Marie, it wasn't even my bra that I burned.
LEADFEMALE:It was Sally Glimpsher's little tiny bra.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:She didn't need it, and I had gym that day, so I figured I wasn't going to get on the trampoline.
OTHERMALE:I could've hurt somebody.
LEADFEMALE:I remember Sally Glimpsher.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, she was always in trouble.
OTHERMALE:I think they were just giving her conjugal visits in detention.
LEADFEMALE:So tell me, which one is yours? Mmm, right there.
SUPFEMALE:Aw Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:It's her first obscene gesture.
LEADFEMALE:Her father and I are just so proud.
SUPMALE:Here's Chuckie Jr.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, geez, he's got his father's finger.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:This is taking a while, isn't it? I hope I'm not late for work.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I hope to talk this guy out of the three-day suspension.
SUPMALE:I hope I can talk at all.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like I'm 15, listening to what a horrible person I am.
LEADFEMALE:I used to sit there gnawing on my fingernails.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Of course now they've grown back, and I think I can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Principal Hiller will see you now.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't do nothing! Anne Marie did! Get out of here! Ladies, thanks for coming down.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, have a seat.
LEADMALE:Boy, everything sure looks a lot smaller.
SUPMALE:No offense.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what do we think about this? Mrs Mitchell.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Mitchell, yeah.
LEADMALE:And your son has been suspended for three days.
OTHERMALE:True.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you must have an opinion about that, and I'd like to hear what it is.
SUPMALE:I really think a three-day suspension is a little much.
LEADMALE:I think she's right.
SUPMALE:I have to agree here.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not saying flipping the bird is right, but three days is a long time.
SUPMALE:Couldn't you start smaller, say, like, first a warning, and then maybe detention? Something like that? Ok, you may be right, but I don't think so.
LEADMALE:You see, this is the warning.
LEADFEMALE:Next time they're down for something, it'll be two weeks.
SUPMALE:Two weeks at home, watching TV.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, that'll really make them mad.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:And you are? Roseanne Harris Er, Conner.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's easy to see where Becky gets her attitude.
SUPMALE:What do you mean by that? She's she's 16, she gets really good grades, she's not pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:I'd say that's damn near perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:Well I have evidence to the contrary here, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner.
LEADMALE:What are you saying, she's a bad kid, or are you calling me a bad mother? I know how hard it is to juggle a career and children.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! My children are my career, ok? You must be talking about my job, which you're making me late for.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:I sympathize, ladies, really I do, but I just can't do this all by myself.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you could spend the days with your kids and teach them about respect Respect for others, respect for themselves.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, do your kids do this in the family pictures? No way.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:They do it here.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:Following that logic, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, as long as they're not stealing anything out of your living room, they can hold up a convenience store.
SUPMALE:We're not talking about armed robbery here.
LEADFEMALE:We're talking about teenagers flipping the bird.
LEADFEMALE:I think we should get over it.
LEADMALE:Maybe you're right, but I don't think so And neither do all these parents who have called in to complain about the photo.
LEADMALE:They want it re-shot at our cost.
OTHERMALE:Frankly, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner, that's not within our budget.
LEADFEMALE:What would you have me tell them about what your daughter did? Uh That it's a political statement.
LEADFEMALE:Funny But I don't think they would laugh, and I don't think they want to "get over it," because they did their job as parents.
SUPMALE:If you won't do yours, I'll see that it won't happen again by handing out a longer suspension next time.
LEADMALE:Now Let's try this again.
SUPMALE:What do we want to do about this? Did you drain the oil out of the crankcase? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Take the filter off? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Put the oil in the pan? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All this black stuff came squirting out.
LEADMALE:Slide on out of there.
SUPFEMALE:Thank god.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Now you're ready to lube.
LEADFEMALE:You know, dad, I-it's not like I don't like all this or anything, but mom kind of wanted me to work in the house.
LEADFEMALE:But mom's not here.
SUPMALE:Dad, I hate all this.
SUPFEMALE:I know, but you're keeping your old dad company, and, damn, we're having fun! Now get back on under there.
LEADFEMALE:Dad? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What am I supposed to do? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You know those pointed doohickeys I showed you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Point your gun at them and fire.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Eww! All this yellow slime is oozing out.
SUPMALE:Oh, my god! Get out of there quick! Sorry about that.
LEADFEMALE:It was a little garage humor.
SUPFEMALE:Real funny, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh, look at my hands.
OTHERFEMALE:They're all greasy and dirty.
OTHERMALE:Here you go.
SUPFEMALE:Wipe them off on this sandwich.
SUPFEMALE:Say, dad, were you ever suspended? Just once.
LEADFEMALE:For what? Snoring too loud in detention.
SUPMALE:Spent the next three days tuning up my dad's Rambler.
LEADMALE:So this is kind of like a time-honored family tradition, huh? You bet.
SUPFEMALE:Get on back under there now.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Where's your dad? In the garage.
OTHERFEMALE:What? No hug and kiss for your good daughter? As soon as I get one.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, mom.
LEADMALE:What are you doing with Becky's picture? I put that in my special hiding place.
LEADMALE:That's where I found it.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, how come Becky's got three hands in this picture? Three hands? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:Let me see.
LEADMALE:Ahh! She didn't do it.
LEADMALE:I'll kill her! This turned out pretty good.
OTHERMALE:If you're expelled, you can do lube work.
LEADMALE:You know, don't you? Know what? Have a look, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:It's not your finger, is it? It could've been.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Becky's got three hands.
LEADMALE:Catch up, Dan.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, "could've been"? It was the kid next to me.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you say anything? The picture came out, and everyone thought I was cool.
OTHERFEMALE:You two didn't seem to care, so I figured, "hey, I'm popular.
LEADMALE:Might as well go with it.
SUPFEMALE:" And then you got suspended, and I had to go down to the principal's office and get humiliated.
OTHERMALE:How long were you going to go with this? Till now? You let your mom take the heat to be popular? I'm sorry, but I didn't get away with anything.
SUPFEMALE:I got suspended.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you're going to school tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, you can.
LEADMALE:I'll take another hour off work and straighten everything out with our principal.
LEADMALE:Then everyone will know I didn't do it.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Life sucks, don't it? You guys weren't mad when you thought I did do it, and now you're mad because I didn't? Next year I'll moon the class photo so you'll be proud of me.
OTHERFEMALE:Just make sure that it's your own butt.
OTHERMALE:You'll have to wait.
SUPFEMALE:I've been waiting for this all my life.
SUPFEMALE:I'm baaaack.
SUPFEMALE:What is it, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner? Fourth row, second from the left.
LEADMALE:Did you ever lay awake nights thinking, "if I had that one moment to live over again, I would do it differently"? I'm having that moment, and you're in it.
LEADFEMALE:Obviously there's been a little mistake.
SUPMALE:I'll lift Becky's suspension.
LEADFEMALE:And I think an apology's in order.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:And what about the other mothers that were in here? Their children really did it.
LEADFEMALE:Their kid makes one mistake, and they're bad mothers? I believe how a student behaves reflects the attitudes of the parent.
LEADFEMALE:What if Becky wishes she'd done it? What kind of mother would I be? I have already apologized I'll tell you what kind of mother that makes me The exact same kind of mother I was yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:No matter how much we try to control our kids, at some point, they'll just do what they'll do.
OTHERFEMALE:They are like people that way.
OTHERFEMALE:But isn't it our job, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner, to make sure they become responsible, mature adults? Absolutely, absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:But we must remember, Mr.
SUPMALE:Hiller, that it's not easy.
LEADFEMALE:Like, say, when I'm in here next year because of something my Darlene does And I will be here Just remember that today I was a good mother.
OTHERMALE:I'll do that, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:See you next year.
OTHERFEMALE:Tuesdays will be good for me.
SUPMALE:Attention, all students taking Latin, you're wasting your lives!
