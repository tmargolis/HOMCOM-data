LEADFEMALE:HA! PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU MEANT, HUH? MY HUSBAND IS INTERESTED IN A LAWSUIT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU THINK THAT'S THE THING WE SHOULD DO.
OTHERFEMALE:WELL, LIKE I SAID OVER THE PHONE, I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE WHATEVER ADVICE I CAN, MAYBE EVEN WRITE A THREATENING LETTER, THOUGH THE LAST ONE OF THOSE I WROTE, I NEARLY GOT SUED.
LEADMALE:WELL, THAT'S ENCOURAGING.
SUPFEMALE:YOU KNOW, IF THIS THING GETS TO WHERE YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO FILE SUIT, I'D LIKE TO, UH I'D LIKE TO RECOMMEND ANOTHER ATTORNEY, ONE THAT SPECIALIZES IN PERSONAL INJURY ACTIONS.
LEADFEMALE:YOU DON'T THINK YOU COULD HANDLE THIS? OH, TRUST ME, I'M NOT YOUR GUY, ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS GOING TO COURT.

SUPMALE:SO NOW, JACKIE, EXCUSE ME FOR INTERFERING, BUT IS THIS REALLY POLICE BUSINESS OR IS THIS PERSONAL 'CAUSE IT'S YOUR SISTER? THIS IS POLICE BUSINESS, CRYSTAL, THAT HAPPENS TO AFFECT ME PERSONALLY.
LEADMALE:SO ROSEANNE DECIDED TO SUE MEG? I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS THAT.

SUPMALE:WELL, MY ATTORNEY DIDN'T TELL ME SHE WAS SO SERIOUSLY INJURED.
LEADMALE:WELL, DIDN'T YOU EVEN CALL HER UP AND SEE HOW SHE WAS? WELL, MY ATTORNEY ADVISED ME NOT TO.
LEADMALE:HE SAID IT WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF GUILT.
LEADMALE:WELL, YOU ARE GUILTY, MEG.
LEADFEMALE:YOU SMASHED HER CAR, AND YOU GOT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT! REMEMBER ONE THING, WELLMAN-I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

OTHERFEMALE:ROXANNE, YOU DO MAKE ME LAUGH.
LEADMALE:HAVE A SEAT.
LEADMALE:OH, WELL, THANK YOU, ROXANNE.
LEADFEMALE:I BROUGHT YOU SOME TREATS.
LEADFEMALE:OH, THAT WAS VERY NICE.
LEADFEMALE:OH, BY THE WAY, I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T GET RACKED UP OR NOTHING.
SUPFEMALE:OH, I'M FINE.
OTHERFEMALE:WELL, IT WAS VERY NICE OF YOU TO STOP BY.
LEADFEMALE:DON'T BE SILLY.
OTHERFEMALE:WE WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
LEADMALE:WHAT, WERE YOU GETTING AN ESTIMATE ON BODY DAMAGE OR SOMETHING? ACTUALLY, YES.
LEADFEMALE:ROXANNE, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SO SERIOUSLY INJURED UNTIL I SPOKE TO JANET AT THE SALON.
LEADMALE:JANET? YOUR SISTER.
LEADMALE:OH.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, NO OFFENSE, MEG, BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WOULD'VE CALLED ME, I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT I WAS SERIOUSLY HURT.
LEADMALE:WELL, I WOULD HAVE CALLED, ROXANNE, BUT MY ATTORNEY ADVISED ME NOT TO.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, HOW VERY LEGAL OF YOU.
LEADMALE:ROXANNE, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU NO LONGER WORK FOR THE COMPANY, WE STILL THINK OF YOU AS PART OF THE WELLMAN FAMILY.
OTHERMALE:I DON'T SUPPOSE MY HEALTH INSURANCE IS STILL GOOD? YOU JUST DROPPED BY 'CAUSE YOU WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD? WELL, YES.
OTHERFEMALE:AND 'CAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEE HOW I WAS DOING AND BRING ME A GIFT? OH, IT'S NOTHING.
SUPMALE:YES, IT IS.
LEADMALE:VERY NICE OF YOU TO COME BY.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, ACTUALLY, THERE WAS JUST ONE OTHER TEENSY, LITTLE THING, JUST WHILE I'M HERE.
LEADFEMALE:UH, YOU NEED A SHAMPOO? OH, NOTHING THAT COMPLICATED.
SUPMALE:NO, I WANTED YOU TO ENDORSE THIS CHECK.
SUPMALE:A CHECK? FOR WHAT? FOR YOU, ROXANNE, AND--AND FOR YOUR LITTLE FAMILY.
SUPFEMALE:UH, HONEY! I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
LEADMALE:IF YOU'D JUST SIGN THAT, JACQUES AND I WILL RUN IT RIGHT OVER TO YOUR BANK, AND YOU'LL HAVE YOUR MONEY.
OTHERMALE:MEG, YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND DON.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me.
LEADMALE:OH, OF COURSE.
LEADMALE:IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU, DAN.
SUPFEMALE:A PLEASURE, MRS.
LEADMALE:WELLMAN.
LEADMALE:CAN I FIX YOU A DRINK? OH, NO.
LEADMALE:I'LL ONLY STAY A MOMENT.
LEADMALE:AND YOU MUST CALL ME MEG.
OTHERMALE:RIGHT NOW? MEG? MEG, WHY ARE YOU GIVING US ALL THIS MONEY? WHY? WELL, BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I'M A NICE PERSON.
LEADFEMALE:BUT WHAT IS THIS LITTLE, TINY WRITING HERE? "ENDORSEMENT CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF PAYMENT FOR TOTAL LIABILITY.
LEADFEMALE:" THAT'S JUST A BUNCH OF LEGAL MUMBO JUMBO.
LEADMALE:WE WOULDN'T WANT TO GET LEGAL NOW, WOULD WE? OH, OF COURSE NOT.
SUPFEMALE:NO, OF COURSE NOT, 'CAUSE OUR LAWYER TELLS US WE CAN GET THREE OR FOUR TIMES THAT AMOUNT.
SUPMALE:PEOPLE GET SO SILLY ABOUT MONEY.
LEADMALE:HERE.
OTHERMALE:THANKS FOR DROPPING BY, MEG, AND MAKING ME FEEL STUPID.
LEADMALE:ROSEANNE, SHE'S OUR GUEST.
SUPMALE:NOW, WHY WOULD YOU FEEL STUPID? BECAUSE FOR SOME DUMB REASON, I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT YOU DROPPED BY TO SEE HOW I WAS DOING, BUT YOU ONLY CAME BY TO BUY ME OFF.
LEADFEMALE:BUY YOU OFF? YEAH, BUT YOU BOUGHT YOURSELF A HUGE LAWSUIT, LADY.
LEADFEMALE:'CAUSE I'M GONNA HAUL YOU INTO COURT AND I'M GONNA SQUEEZE YOU DRY.
SUPMALE:WELL, I HOPE YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD ATTORNEY.
LEADFEMALE:LET ME REPHRASE THAT, MEG.
LEADMALE:I THINK WHAT I REALLY MEANT TO SAY WAS THAT IF, YOU KNOW, IF I WOULD HAVE BUMPED INTO YOU, I MEAN, I WOULD HAVE CALLED A LAWYER, TOO, YOU KNOW, BUT FIRST I WOULD HAVE MAYBE CALLED YOU TO SEE IF YOU WERE OK AND TO SAY I'M SORRY.
LEADFEMALE:BUT I AM SORRY, ROXANNE.
LEADFEMALE:THERE YOU GO.
SUPMALE:WELL, THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO HEAR.
LEADFEMALE:THAT'S ALL YOU WANT? THAT AND YOUR WORD THAT I NEVER HAVE TO WALK YOUR DOG AGAIN.
LEADMALE:AND THAT'S IT? AND THE CHECK.
LEADMALE:OF COURSE.
SUPFEMALE:OH, DON, COULD YOU WALK ME TO MY CAR? OF COURSE.
LEADMALE:NEIGHBORHOOD.
LEADMALE:OH, ROXANNE, I AM SO GLAD WE GOT THIS STRAIGHTENED OUT JUST BETWEEN US, AND WE ARE FRIENDS AGAIN, AREN'T WE? OH, I'D SAY WE'RE ABOUT AS CLOSE AS WE EVER WERE, MEG.
LEADFEMALE:MY LAWYER GOT ME $25,000.
SUPMALE:HE GOT ME $25,000.
SUPMALE:HE GOT ME $60,000.
SUPMALE:HE TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHING FOR ME-GOT ME A $20,000 SETTLEMENT.
LEADFEMALE:I BROKE MY LEG, AND LARRY PARKER GOT ME $80,000.
LEADMALE:AFTER THE ACCIDENT, MY CAR GOT FIXED, MY MEDICAL WAS PAID, AND I GOT A GOOD SETTLEMENT.
LEADFEMALE:I WAS IN A CROSSWALK.
SUPMALE:I GOT HIT BY A CAR.
OTHERMALE:I GOT MY KNEE AND MY BACK MESSED UP.
LEADMALE:I WENT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF A CAR.
LEADFEMALE:I SHATTERED MY WRIST.
