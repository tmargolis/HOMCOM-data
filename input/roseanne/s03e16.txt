OTHERMALE:Guess so.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Darlene, you're wearing my shirt! Get off my back.
SUPFEMALE:I got bigger problems.
LEADFEMALE:What's happening? Career day at school.
LEADMALE:They want Dad to speak.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, bummer, Darlene.
LEADMALE:He's too cool to do it.
LEADMALE:That's me, Ice-D.
LEADMALE:Too cool for school.
SUPMALE:You know what makes me mad about this? How come it's automatically made out to you and not me? Honey, I am the professional in the family.
OTHERMALE:Oh, right.
OTHERMALE:I forgot about your master's in drywalling.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the real reason is just 'cause you're a man.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god, she's going feminist on me.
OTHERMALE:Like I'm not good enough for their little junior high school career day? Like some housewife doesn't have anything important to say? It's an outrage, mom.
SUPMALE:I say go show them how tough your job really is.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe I will.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Becky.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe next time, you'll keep your grubby little paws off my stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you're not going to let some blond bimbette tell you what to do.
LEADMALE:What's your problem? Are you embarrassed of your mother? Don't get offended, mom.
OTHERMALE:I'm just as embarrassed of Dad.
LEADMALE:Aw, you're just saying that.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. What's, uh, in the bag? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Thanks for bringing him home.
OTHERMALE:I suppose you want a free dinner now.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
SUPMALE:Uh, Roseanne, can I alk-tay with ou-YAY in ivate-pray? O-Kay-do-Kay.
LEADMALE:Duh.
OTHERMALE:I don't understand what they're talking about, do you? So what's up? This is in the strictest of confidence.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. Has a little problem.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Where you been, Jackie? No.
OTHERMALE:I mean there's some bully at school threatening to beat him up unless he brings him a Twinkie every day.
SUPMALE:Are you sure? Yes.
LEADMALE:He made me buy a whole box.
LEADFEMALE:That's what's in that bag.
LEADMALE:Remember, this is just between you and me.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:d.j. ! Don't, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I promised him I wasn't going to tell anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you lied.
LEADMALE:Yeah? What's this about your having some problem at school with some bully? Deej, I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:She forced it out of me.
SUPMALE:Wuss.
LEADMALE:Deej, what's going on? It's ok.
SUPFEMALE:If I give Kevin Morgan two Twinkies every day, he won't beat me up.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You can't go through life giving in to bullies.
LEADMALE:But I want to live! I'm going to call the school.
SUPMALE:You can't do that.
LEADMALE:Everyone will think he's a squealer.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Then he'll really get the cream cheese kicked out of him.
OTHERMALE:Then I'll call this kid's parents.
SUPMALE:Don't do that! He's going to beat me up! What am I supposed to do? I'll have to teach him to fight.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Dan.
OTHERMALE:d.j. 's just a little, tiny boy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, size isn't really the issue here, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:Uh, back when I was on the force Here we go.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying, if you know what you're doing, anybody can take out anybody.
SUPMALE:I could put Dan on the floor if I wanted to.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Then you could sprout little pink wings and fly away.
LEADFEMALE:What, you don't think I can? Dan, I was a cop.
LEADMALE:Take your best shot, officer.
LEADFEMALE:Yaah! Aah! Ow, ow! She pulled a hair out.
LEADFEMALE:See? I'll go teach the kid how to take care of himself.
LEADMALE:You know if d.j. Tries to fight, he'll just get hurt.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll make it clear that fighting isn't the answer Unless you're sure you can win.
LEADFEMALE:Meantime, I'll just keep him stocked up in Twinkies.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'll get this place cleaned up for you.
SUPFEMALE:I'll start by tossing this letter from the school.
LEADFEMALE:Might as well, I guess.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, all right, mom.
SUPMALE:What's the matter? Darlene having problems at school? Not yet.
LEADMALE:All right, everybody, listen up! Today we are very lucky to have as our guest speaker a woman who chose to make home economics her life.
LEADMALE:I want you all to welcome Mrs.
SUPMALE:Roseanne Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Kill me.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner has been a wife and a mother for 17 years, and she's come to us today to present a sort of common-sense approach to home economics.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Well Um, ok.
SUPMALE:Well, ok.
LEADMALE:You know how a lot of people don't think that being a housewife is important, but, ok, a lot of people depend on you, and you got to be really smart and dedicated.
LEADMALE:Well, it's kind of like being a doctor, only, you know, um, the hours are longer and you don't get any pay and, um It's way bloodier, so It's probably not like being a doctor at all.
LEADMALE:Well, anyway, any questions or Yes, Darlene.
SUPMALE:May I be expelled? No, Darlene.
SUPFEMALE:You got a question? What did you really want to do with your life? Well, I tried, you know, lounging on the beaches of Europe, but somehow that just left me empty.
LEADFEMALE:Believe this or not, I really wanted to have a family.
LEADMALE:Maybe not the one I got, but You know.
SUPFEMALE:What's your favorite soap opera? Well I don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Is that what you think, that you just watch soap operas and all that? You know, raising a family, well, it's a career.
LEADFEMALE:Ok? It's kind of like managing a factory.
SUPFEMALE:Now she manages a factory.
LEADMALE:This will be way better than the doctor thing, trust me.
LEADFEMALE:Way better.
LEADMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:Like, I think of my kids like they're the product, right? And if I can get them out there on the market without them getting returned defective Then I done my job.
LEADMALE:But what could you teach us that we couldn't learn here? Well What are you learning here? Oh, well, yesterday we baked a quiche Lorraine.
OTHERMALE:No, really? Yes.
LEADMALE:We think it's very important to learn how to follow a recipe.
LEADFEMALE:And we've learned how to make our own clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how very Little House on the Prairie.
LEADMALE:I don't know anything about that kind of home economics.
SUPFEMALE:What I know about is, like, cleaning and shopping and cooking for a family of five on a really tight budget and still having money left over to buy that all-important aspirin.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't even know if I could teach it in class here.
LEADMALE:I think we ought to go on a field trip.
LEADFEMALE:I think that's a great idea, so why don't you get permission from your parents to spend an afternoon with Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner? Oh, mom! Oh, no, that's ok, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:You can go.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't this class have some boys? They think shopping's a girl thing.
LEADMALE:Get used to that.
LEADFEMALE:Can we get this over with? Come on now, Darlene, this can be fun.
LEADMALE:Here, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:You can ride in the seat.
SUPFEMALE:Aw.
SUPMALE:Aw.
SUPMALE:Aw.
LEADFEMALE:It's just the buy-n-bag.
LEADMALE:We've been here a million times.
LEADMALE:It's not just the Buy-n-Bag, Darlene.
SUPMALE:A supermarket is the very blood and guts of home economics, and besides, it's what makes our country great.
OTHERFEMALE:Where else in the world are you going to find frozen pizzas, microwave pizzas, French bread pizzas, thick crust pizzas, pizza puffs, pizza rolls, pizza squares, pizza tarts? Did I tell you you should never shop when you're really hungry? All right, girls.
LEADFEMALE:The mission is meat.
OTHERFEMALE:You're making dinner for five people, and you're on a really tight budget.
LEADMALE:Uh, what's your name? Meryl.
SUPFEMALE:Step up to the meat counter and pick a meat.
SUPFEMALE:Any meat.
SUPMALE:All right, let's see.
SUPFEMALE:There's a lot of meat in here.
SUPFEMALE:Some veal, some chicken.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you got four loads in the laundry and a sink full of dishes, and your husband gets cranky if he has to wait for his dinner.
SUPMALE:Move! Move! Move! All right, here! God! So, girls, let's see what Meryl picked.
LEADFEMALE:New York steak, hmm? What does your dad do for a living? He's a dermatologist.
LEADMALE:Oh, then that would be a good choice.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody here who doesn't have a trust fund? Darlene, what are we going to have for dinner? Well, I'm eating at Meryl's house.
SUPMALE:Who wants to see a picture of Darlene dressed up like a tulip for her third-grade play? Aw.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Aw.
LEADMALE:Oh, not me.
SUPMALE:Where's that ground garbage? Here you go.
LEADMALE:Yes, girls, ground beef The stuff that gives meat loaf its bulk.

LEADFEMALE:So all right, there we go.
SUPMALE:Corn flakes, girls The most important ingredient in tonight's entree.
SUPFEMALE:Why do we need that? How else you think we're going to turn 2 pounds of ground beef into 11 pounds of mouth-watering meat loaf? And the leftovers stay crunchy in milk.
SUPMALE:All right, suck-up, hand me a box there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nay.
LEADMALE:That's the name brand.
