SUPMALE:You guys can't write off some of this stuff you have down here.
SUPFEMALE:Those are business expenses.
LEADMALE:$1,200 For "a boob job"? It's not a boob job.
SUPFEMALE:It's a breast reduction.
OTHERFEMALE:We're taking it as a loss.
LEADFEMALE:I Buy it.
LEADFEMALE:I, UhI don't think the irs will, But it is medical, So you can write it off as a personal deduction.
LEADFEMALE:Dy-no-mite! Now, um Is this your monthly balance? Because you seem to be a little short on cash.
LEADMALE:That must be the wrong page.
SUPFEMALE:We're not short on cash.
LEADFEMALE:We actually have none.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what happened to all that snowmobile repair work, Dan? Did it.
SUPMALE:Spent it.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, look, I'll, uh, I'll run all this stuff through my computer, And when I have your returns ready, I'll give you a call.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, art.
OTHERMALE:Listen, What do we owe you? I could write you a check.
LEADMALE:You kill me, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Darlene, heard that joke You made up about trudy burke.
LEADMALE:It's really funny.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:The beauty part is, It doesn't just have to be about trudy.
LEADFEMALE:It works for any girl with a mustache.
LEADFEMALE:Did you know that trudy heard it, too? Good.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she'll pull a comb through that thing.
LEADMALE:Another good one.
OTHERFEMALE:You can tell her that tomorrow When she's beating the crap out of you.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? She doesn't know that joke was mine.
LEADFEMALE:Did I forget to tell you Your friend stacy ratted you out? Why'd she do that? So trudy would let her out of her locker.
SUPMALE:All right, so trudy knows.
LEADFEMALE:But I mouth off to everybody.
LEADMALE:People love that about me.
LEADMALE:Look on the bright side.
LEADMALE:You may really like your new face.
SUPFEMALE:And, man, he is so smart.
SUPMALE:He knows so much stuff about taxes and everything.
LEADMALE:I swear, it's fascinating.
LEADMALE:Taxes are fascinating, Roseanne? Well, not normally, you know, But when art's talking about it, I swear, you laugh, you cry.
LEADMALE:Not my type.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you don't know that.
LEADMALE:You're telling me I don't know my type? Well, he's cute, and he's funny.
LEADFEMALE:He looks like the lucky charms guy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's what's inside that counts, Jackie.
LEADMALE:And inside, this guy has a time-share condo in florida.
LEADMALE:Can we drop it, please? I'm trying to tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:Can I say one more thing about it? Why can't you date him? Roseanne! What do you want to tell me? I'm thinking about Going into therapy.
SUPFEMALE:You mean like a shrink? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Why? There's a lot of reasons.
OTHERMALE:Like what? Oh, I just haven't been happy lately, And with mom and dad breaking up, It makes me think how crazy our childhood was, And there's a lot of stuff I've got to deal with.
SUPFEMALE:When would you start? Two months ago.
SUPFEMALE:What? I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:That stinks.
SUPFEMALE:I'm your sister and you go and do something that major Without even talking to me first? Calm down.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really upset about this.
SUPMALE:How come you can talk to some stranger And you can't talk to me? Because when I tell her my problems, We don't spend the next hour Talking about how that makes her feel.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it is a good idea, then.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you told me.
LEADFEMALE:Finally.
OTHERFEMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:You know, art goes to therapy.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hey.
SUPFEMALE:I had an idea about the shop.
LEADMALE:I'm not sure if it's crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's run it by Jackie and find out.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne! Does everybody have to know about this? I was only going to tell Dan.
LEADMALE:It's a very personal thing.
OTHERFEMALE:He's family.
SUPMALE:I'm asking you to keep it to yourself.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPMALE:k.
LEADMALE:, I won't tell Dan.
SUPMALE:All righty.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to take off now.
LEADMALE:I'll call you later.
LEADFEMALE:What's the idea with the shop? Arnie came by this afternoon with a tattoo artist.
OTHERMALE:He wants to rent part of the shop-and he could bring by a lot of bikers.
SUPMALE:A tattoo guy? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERMALE:I didn't commit to anything.
LEADMALE:I'll have art check out the deal.
LEADMALE:Well, what's this guy like? I didn't talk to him much, But I think he's a very talented artist Who's paid his debt to society.
LEADMALE:Gil here, he's the absolute best.
LEADMALE:People come to him from all over.
LEADMALE:Damn it, you're hitting bone! Don't pay attention to me.
LEADMALE:It's easier than it seems.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, it's kind of a macho thing.
LEADMALE:Oh, mommy! Excuse us one moment.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think, art? Uh, I don't know, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Financially, it's a good idea, But personally, I got to wonder about a guy Who's covered his entire body with tattoos.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Think he's got one on mr.
LEADMALE:Winkie? I don't really want to know, Dan.
OTHERMALE:Danny, check it out.

LEADFEMALE:That was a nice guy, And you forced me to hurt him.
SUPMALE:You didn't even give him a chance.
LEADMALE:I said I didn't want to go out with him, But you wouldn't leave it at that.
OTHERMALE:Well, just one dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm standing right here, And you're not listening to a single word I'm saying! Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Your therapy's working out real good.
LEADMALE:What? You still getting beat up today? Shut up.
SUPMALE:You're eating too much.
LEADMALE:You'll barf.

OTHERFEMALE:Oh, boy, when's Dan going to get out of here? See you later.
LEADMALE:Play nice.
SUPFEMALE:Well I Assume you're here to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:I have spoken to my therapist.
LEADMALE:She thinks it would be a good idea If you came down to talk to her.
LEADMALE:Why? You're the nut.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks one reason I may be a nut Is because of you.
LEADMALE:What's that supposed to mean? Whenever I talk to her, your name keeps coming up.
LEADFEMALE:You're a very big influence on me, Roseanne, And she thinks she can help sort it out.
LEADMALE:We had a fight.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all.
LEADFEMALE:So you're not going to come down.
LEADFEMALE:Is she going to ask us All kind of personal questions and stuff? That is sort of the point.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
OTHERMALE:Well Let's get our story straight Before we go down there.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, we're all on the same side, So please don't feel defensive.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not a judge or a referee.
LEADFEMALE:We're both here for one reason-to help Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Get her, doc.
OTHERMALE:Nobody's here to get anybody, Nor will we solve the problem in one session.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I have no problem, o.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:? I'm just here to help out eleanor rigby there.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Now, Roseanne-Here's where I get yelled at.
SUPMALE:I'd just like to set up boundaries.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, let's work on listening without judging.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, I'm going to ask Jackie how she feels.
LEADFEMALE:Some of this may hurt, But I don't want you to answer back.
LEADFEMALE:Instead, I want you to repeat what she said In your own words.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:k.
LEADMALE:Now, Jackie, last session We talked about how choices are difficult for you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well It's just Everything I do.
LEADMALE:I'm always wondering what she's going to say Because she's so judgmental.
SUPFEMALE:Can you be specific? Well, it's just everything.
SUPMALE:It'sif I'm going to be a cop, What's she going to say? If I cut my hair, will she laugh? If I go out with this guy Or if I move Or see a movie or buy a book.
SUPFEMALE:It's everything.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
SUPMALE:Now, Roseanne, what did you just hear? In your own words.
OTHERFEMALE:Why would you want To move out of your apartment? I mean, you pay really low rent.
LEADFEMALE:It's a great place.
SUPFEMALE:You should see it.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:, o.
SUPFEMALE:k.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's start over.
SUPFEMALE:Uh And remember, Roseanne, I'm asking you not to judge her, Just to listen to her.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADMALE:, but she doesn't have to pay utilities.
SUPFEMALE:Even if it is a horrible mistake To move out of my apartment, It's my mistake.
LEADMALE:I'm not one of your children.
SUPFEMALE:Then you go make a mistake, And you come to me to clean it up.
SUPMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:You're my sister.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:So I see.
LEADFEMALE:I can't say anything to stop the mistake, But I mop it up after.
SUPFEMALE:If you loved me, I'd think you'd want to.
LEADFEMALE:You better call for backup.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Uh, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's try something different.
LEADMALE:Let's try a little exercise.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, you go first.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to turn to Roseanne And say "you're my sister, and I love you because" And fill in the rest.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:What's taking you so long? Well, o.
LEADMALE:k.
SUPFEMALE:I got it.
SUPMALE:Uh You're my sister, And I love you because you're strong.
LEADFEMALE:That's it? Well, it's not that easy.
OTHERMALE:You do it.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:I Will.
LEADFEMALE:You're my sister, And I love you Because you're warm and caring and giving And nurturing and kind, But you know, your problem is-Hold up.
LEADMALE:Hold up.
SUPFEMALE:Try it without the but.
LEADFEMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:k.
SUPMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
OTHERMALE:You're my sister, and I love you Because we've shared so many things, although-Uh, that's another but.
LEADMALE:I don't like this game.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go back to the listening deal.
SUPMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:k.
LEADMALE:We'll come back to this later.
LEADMALE:Jackie, your turn to listen.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, tell me, how do you feel When you think Jackie's making a mistake? Well, I worry about her.
LEADFEMALE:Why? 'Cause I don't want her to get hurt, And if I can see some way of preventing that, I'll say something.
SUPMALE:Jackie? In your own words? I mean, I know this art isn't gorgeous or anything, But he'd be nice to her, and he'd protect her.
LEADFEMALE:It wouldn't be so awful to marry such a guy.
SUPMALE:Do you want her married to such a guy So he could take over for you, Then you wouldn't have to look out for Jackie anymore? Are you kidding? What does she know about being married? The thing is, see, I didn't realize I was treating you like a kid.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:I did realize it.
LEADFEMALE:I just--I just didn't think you knew.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least you went with me, And we learned how we can talk this stuff out.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I want you to know That it is, uh, really hard for me To, uh, dialogue with you With a, uh, without a, uh Confrontational agenda.
OTHERFEMALE:I hear that, But you've got to learn How to let go of your control issues Without that triggering your whole abandonment issue.
LEADMALE:I hear that.
SUPMALE:Now There's one thing I want to say to you In a totally, um Non-manipulative and non-judgmental Context.
LEADFEMALE:I'm hearing that.
LEADFEMALE:Um O.
LEADMALE:k.
SUPMALE:The responsibility that I feel towards you Is all your fault.
OTHERFEMALE:How? Oh.
