LEADFEMALE:You know, Charlotte and I begged him to go there, Not stupid Branson.
LEADMALE:Well, I think you girls Would probably like it in Branson, 'cause there's a lot of, you know, musicians down there, And they have their days free, And they'd probably really like Making little friends like you.

SUPMALE:It's your birthright.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but that's not how this family works.
SUPMALE:No, that's how all families work.
LEADMALE:Becky got to treat me bad, I got to take it out on d.j. , And d.j. Gets to take it out on society as a whole.
SUPMALE:I think i'm going to go see if dad wants some tea.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
OTHERMALE:You two are so screwed up.
LEADFEMALE:We are not.
OTHERMALE:Oh, please, why do you think she eats so much And you'll sleep with any guy who gives you a little attention? Go shove it, Darlene.
LEADMALE:Where the hell do you get so much insight? Trust me.

LEADMALE:Isn't this great, honey? Just you and me on the open road? Yeah, it's pretty cool.
SUPFEMALE:Look at all those little houses out there.
LEADMALE:You ever wonder what kind of people live there And what they're doing right now? I know what they're doing right now.
SUPMALE:They're wondering why the hell they bought houses So damn close to the freeway.
SUPFEMALE:You know who lives in those houses? People just like us.
SUPMALE:Each one of those little houses has its own Becky and Darlene.
LEADMALE:Its own d.j. How come they still get to have a Becky? I guess their little bike shops are doing well.
LEADMALE:Boy, stuff sure has changed, hasn't it? Remember that big plan I worked out When we first got married? Yeah.
LEADMALE:What was that again? I think it was, "we'll get by.
LEADMALE:" Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What ever happened to that? Hey, come on, we're doing okay.
LEADMALE:You've got your restaurant now.
LEADMALE:It's doing good.
LEADMALE:Making money.
LEADMALE:Let's have a baby.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Are you serious? Since when do you want to have another kid? Well, I was just thinking about how much fun it was When the kids were little.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but then they get big, remember? I'm not getting burned on that deal again.
LEADMALE:So what are you saying? We're never gonna have any more children? Maybe I am.
LEADFEMALE:Are you the only one that can decide that? You got a uterus? Well, that's pretty damn unfair.
LEADMALE:I don't see why we can't do this.
SUPMALE:Kids take money, Dan, okay? And we don't have that much of it.
LEADMALE:If we did, you think we'd be driving cross-country With our neighbor's toilet? Hey, when we had our first kid, things were tough.
OTHERFEMALE:We didn't have any trouble making that decision.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't make that decision, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Jose cuervo did.
LEADMALE:What a coincidence.
OTHERFEMALE:He's the same guy that proposed to you.
SUPFEMALE:Glad you're feeling better.
LEADMALE:I don't think i'da gotten through it without you.
LEADMALE:Oh, all you needed was a little TLC.

OTHERFEMALE:I can tell.
SUPMALE:I keep watching your eyes, And they never leave the road.
LEADFEMALE:They are so brown.

LEADFEMALE:That's funny.
LEADFEMALE:It is.
LEADMALE:That is funny.
OTHERMALE:Could we get some drinks up here? I got it.
LEADMALE:Boy, I think my dad and your aunt Jackie Are really hitting it off.
OTHERMALE:Wouldn't it be bizarre if they got married? Yeah, then we'd be cousins and we live next door to each other So we could share clothes and talk on the phone And do each other's hair.
LEADFEMALE:Die, dwarf.
OTHERFEMALE:Who wants more peas? You mean some more baby peas? Some of those cute little baby peas? I'd love some more baby peas.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, even though you're done, That doesn't mean I don't want any more baby peas.

LEADMALE:I let him use our bathroom, And I guess I forgot he was in there.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. , what were you thinking? You guys got any tobacco? Jackie, pull over.
SUPMALE:We gotta let somebody out.
LEADMALE:No, no, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:We can't just dump him in the middle of the desert.
LEADMALE:Where you headed, buddy? Anywhere over the border would be fine.
LEADMALE:Jackie, pull over.
LEADFEMALE:Was just a joke.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're out of here, buddy.
LEADMALE:Hold on, i'm gonna check his bag.
SUPMALE:Make sure he didn't take anything.
OTHERMALE:You better hope you're clean, mister.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how do we compare to other families you've killed? You know, ma'am, you might not believe this, But I used to be just like you people.
SUPFEMALE:Oh yeah, I had a family, wife, kids, home.
SUPFEMALE:Whole deal.
OTHERMALE:Then I lost my job, wife took the kids.
LEADMALE:Things started going to hell, and I find myself here.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, Ty, why don't you go ahead and start driving for a while.
LEADMALE:Got it.
OTHERMALE:I don't think it would hurt nothing To have you ride with us for a little bit.
OTHERMALE:Can I get you something to eat? Well, yeah, i'd appreciate that.
SUPMALE:Do you know where your family is now? Nah, I was lying about the family and the job.
OTHERMALE:My problem's always been the liquor and the pills.
LEADFEMALE:Ty, pull over the next exit.
SUPFEMALE:He's getting out.
OTHERMALE:He's clean, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Very well organized.
LEADMALE:Well, putting 8 people in a 20-foot space together For 5 days seemed like a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:What went wrong? Well, for one thing, You've put me in a motor home with a man Who hasn't had a woman in 15 years.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie, can you just keep your distance from him? It's not like I don't try.
SUPFEMALE:Y'know, yesterday I almost lost him at the sink.
SUPFEMALE:Just deal with it, okay? I have my own problems.
LEADMALE:Like, for instance, dan's driving me crazy About having another kid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is great.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have four kids before I even have one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, for your information, I'm thinking about getting a cat.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I didn't say I was gonna do it.
LEADFEMALE:'course, I didn't say I wasn't Gonna do it, either.
SUPFEMALE:What's that mean? Well, i'm thinking about it, you know.
SUPMALE:I've got a whole bunch of experience.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, i'd do things different this time.
OTHERFEMALE:Like, for instance, I wouldn't teach this kid to talk.
LEADMALE:You really think you should do this? Jackie, look at the three kids i've already raised.
SUPFEMALE:Don't I deserve a shot at a good one? Well, good news.
LEADFEMALE:I called home and nobody answered.
OTHERMALE:Everything okay at the diner? That's the better news.
OTHERMALE:You know that job you didn't get? You got it.
SUPMALE:The guy left a message at the diner That their first choice fell through.
SUPMALE:Congratulations, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You're second best.
LEADFEMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and it's steady drywall work With medical benefits and everything So now we can finally afford to get One of them expensive illnesses we talked about.
LEADFEMALE:And I was thinking since we'll have two incomes, That maybe i'll talk about that baby thing you want.
SUPMALE:I'm not taking the job, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:What do you mean you're not taking the job? Just what I said.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not taking the job.
LEADMALE:Here you've been dragging around the house For a whole month complaining how you ain't got no work, Then you start with that baby talk And get my eggs all in an uproar.
SUPMALE:You are taking that job, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not taking the job just 'cause you want a baby.
LEADMALE:I want a baby? You're the one that started the whole baby thing.
LEADMALE:I don't want a baby anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, i'm glad that you made up your mind Before somebody said here comes the head.
SUPMALE:I don't want to talk about this anymore, okay? Let's drop it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I do.
SUPFEMALE:I said let's drop it! What the hell's wrong with you? Why the hell did you say you wanted to have a baby? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe I thought having a baby would make me happy.
SUPMALE:I could have just as easily said A new car or a pool table.
LEADMALE:Maybe I just needed something to look forward to.
LEADMALE:What, and getting paid to be out of the house Eight hours a day isn't enough for ya? Not drywall.
SUPMALE:Well, you don't have to do it forever.
LEADMALE:You could just do it until something better comes along.
OTHERMALE:There's guys there that have been doing the same thing For 30 years waiting for something better To come along.
LEADMALE:I lose my bike shop, The first thing I do is go back to drywall.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, what do you really want to do? Roseanne, there's a theme here.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you're scaring me.
LEADFEMALE:You think you're scared? Well, wherever it is that you don't know Where the hell you're going to, You know that i'm right there behind ya.
