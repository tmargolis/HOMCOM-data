OTHERMALE:Is Darlene here yet? You don't see her washing my feet with her hair, do you? God, mom, I really hope you're not gonna be too hard on her.
LEADFEMALE:You know I am more than fair, Becky.
OTHERMALE:Now, uhCan you think of a punishment That starts with "x"? She lived with her boyfriend 'cause she was in love with him.

SUPMALE:Of course, she won't listen, What with being dead and all.
LEADMALE:I have had it, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I can't keep hiding David at my house.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's been, like, a week.
LEADMALE:I can't take care of him anymore.

LEADFEMALE:Have you told Dan about David yet? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Really? What did he say? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean the truth? No.
LEADMALE:It's starting to get very uncomfortable.
LEADMALE:Last night, he thought I tried to seduce him.
SUPMALE:Well, it was kind of funny.
OTHERFEMALE:I just gave him a hug 'cause he said something sweet, And boom, now he thinks I want him.
LEADFEMALE:That is so funny.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, who'd want to go to bed With some big old fat lady? I got to go talk to Mark.

LEADFEMALE:You can't ground me.
SUPMALE:I don't even live here anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:The only reason I came home Is because you said we could talk to dad about David.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he's, like, really unhappy.
SUPFEMALE:David is just fine.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about him.
LEADMALE:He's just a little shook Because aunt Jackie put the moves on him.
SUPFEMALE:I did not.
SUPFEMALE:Who'd want to sleep with some big old fat lady? David's got to come back here.
LEADMALE:If you won't talk to dad, i'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think this would be the right time With the mood your dad's in.
SUPFEMALE:Let's face it: You need my help.
LEADMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you are twisted.
LEADMALE:Do you think I take joy in punishing my children? Yes, I do.
SUPFEMALE:See, Jackie? You must always let the child Know why they're being punished.

OTHERFEMALE:You lied to me.
SUPMALE:Well, it's not like I feel good about it.
LEADMALE:I mean, you found out.
OTHERFEMALE:The whole thing would have never happened If you hadn't have brought David into this house.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell were you thinking? I wanted him to live here.
LEADFEMALE:I still do.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Well, maybe because I still think he's a good kid.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, you know? He's handy to have around the house.
OTHERFEMALE:You never know if i'm gonna need something on the low shelf.
LEADFEMALE:What is with you? Why are you taking david's side? Well, somebody has to.
SUPMALE:God, Dan, you're blaming the whole thing in chicago on David.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Darlene was there, too, you know.
LEADMALE:It's not like David forced her to hide him out there.
LEADFEMALE:All I know is before David came along, Darlene was not the kind of kid Who would move in with her teenage boyfriend.
LEADMALE:Before David came around, Darlene was 12.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I mean.
LEADMALE:The teenage boy, they can be very persuasive.
LEADFEMALE:Have you met Darlene at all? You seen the control she has over David? I mean, David isn't even his real name.
LEADFEMALE:She just made that up.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you've been saying it for years.
SUPFEMALE:I'm finally gonna agree with you.
LEADFEMALE:Men are pigs.
LEADMALE:I mean, you were every bit as bull-headed as Darlene was.
LEADFEMALE:I managed to persuade you.
LEADMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:You remember our second date? You were upset because you had this big fight with your mom.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't thinking about your feelings.
LEADFEMALE:I was thinking you were ripe for the picking.
LEADFEMALE:Show a little charm, pour a few drinks down her.
LEADMALE:Boom! We're at the blue rooster motel: Cock-a-doodle-doo.
SUPMALE:My mom was in indiana.
LEADMALE:There was no fight.
LEADMALE:I just set the whole thing up So that you would be able to take advantage of me In my time of need.
SUPMALE:So you've been lying to me from the beginning.
LEADFEMALE:Face it, Dan, I seduced you, And Darlene may very well have seduced David, okay? So you can't keep blaming David for this whole thing.
LEADMALE:Darlene had sex because she wanted to have sex.
LEADMALE:I got to go to work.
LEADFEMALE:The fact that I had my nightgown in my purse Should have tipped you off.
LEADMALE:hey, it's me! Hi.
