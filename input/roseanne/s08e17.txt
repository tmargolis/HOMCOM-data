LEADFEMALE:Well, last day on the job, boys.
LEADFEMALE:So tomorrow when we come in to have our free coffee and doughnuts, It won't technically be legal.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Dan, I just wanted to thank you For taking me with you and bob on this new drywall job that you got.
LEADMALE:Well, Mark, we looked at a lot of applicants.
LEADFEMALE:We found out you were the only one married to my daughter.
LEADMALE:So I guess i'd better pack up all my personal stuff And take it home.
LEADMALE:there.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll miss this place, Dan? I don't know, bob.
LEADMALE:I'll have my memories.
SUPFEMALE:like this-I bet i've stapled with this thing.
LEADMALE:And how many times have you guys come in here And caught me using this crazy tape dispenser? i've never seen you use that.
OTHERFEMALE:Pens, pencils, paperclips-Memories, memories, memories.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess that about does it.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call Rosie and tell her i'm on my way home.
LEADFEMALE:tell you one thing, Mark, The city of Lanford is losing a great asset right there.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure they can get another stapler, bob.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, honey.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we're just about done here.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I just wanted my last call from the office to be to you.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:Okay, bye-bye.
LEADMALE:I guess that about does it.
LEADMALE:This is Dan conner Punching out.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe we forgot this.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Rosie.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, I wanna show you something.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay okay, but this better be good, Because they're showing that "full house" Where they think one of those little twins is dying.
SUPFEMALE:Looky here.
SUPFEMALE:It's our massive accumulation of bills.
SUPFEMALE:i'll get the lighter fluid.
LEADMALE:no no no no.
OTHERMALE:See, i've sorted them by when they were received-Clinton, bush, Reagan.
LEADMALE:See here where it says, "amount enclosed"? I thought it might be fun to put a number in there.
SUPFEMALE:why? because we can.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
SUPMALE:Not only did they give me last week's pay, But I got my unused vacation time And drew the money out of my pension fund.
SUPMALE:If I had known all you had to do to clean up like this was quit your job, I'd have done it long ago.
OTHERFEMALE:I've never even seen a check for that amount of money before.
SUPMALE:What does that comma mean? You know, if we pay everything off, We'll finally be debt free.
LEADMALE:So we gotta be smart here.
LEADMALE:I say we pay half the bills and split the rest Between an aggressive money market And a conservative mutual fund.
LEADMALE:I was practicing that all the way home.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but you know, I think you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:If we're going to invest it, we shouldn't put it all in one place.
LEADMALE:I say we put half of it into the mattress And the other half in tomato cans Buried under the bush in the backyard.
SUPFEMALE:Well, wherever we put it, it's gotta be safe and secure.
LEADMALE:We really do have to make a mature decision about this.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna go to paris! I hear that the french people are really rude and they hate americans, So I will, like, totally fit right in there.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know.
SUPMALE:That's stupid.
LEADFEMALE:But what about England, or, you know, Italy, Or china, or even canada? But not canada, because we can already buy their bacon here.
SUPFEMALE:I know! I've got it.
SUPMALE:I've got it.
OTHERFEMALE:There's someplace we could go To see all of these places at once.
LEADMALE:International house of pancakes.
SUPMALE:No, but i'll give you two hints.
SUPMALE:Florida, And the happiest place on earth.
SUPMALE:We're going to gator world.
SUPFEMALE:No, you idiot.
LEADFEMALE:Disney world.
SUPFEMALE:It's perfect, because they have that epcot center thing, okay? So, like, say you're in Italy and you get really bored.
OTHERFEMALE:You just walk over to china, okay? I know for real that in the real world That would actually take days.
SUPFEMALE:We can't blow my hard-earned cash on a vacation.
LEADFEMALE:I hear they have something Called a beer garden.
SUPFEMALE:Hot dog! It'll be so great.
SUPFEMALE:We'll take the whole family.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Them.
LEADFEMALE:No, think about it, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Becky's applying for college and darlene's gonna be graduating soon.
LEADMALE:This is probably the last chance we will ever get for a family vacation.
LEADMALE:Well, we could sleep on it I guess and-Hey, everybody! Cancel next week! We're going to disney world! We can discuss it in the morning.
LEADMALE:Maybe Can we just do this meeting without Becky? In fact, while we're at it, can we do everything without Becky? No, she's part of this family.
