LEADMALE:brass captain's bell.
LEADFEMALE:i saw a real beauty down at fulton avenue boat store.
LEADMALE:well, don't you have to have a boat to put it on? what do you think i'm making out in the garage? a hideous mess.
LEADMALE:you know, if we're real careful with this $500 yeah? we can just about pay everything up, and that'll leave us with $11.
SUPFEMALE:87.
SUPFEMALE:you're kidding.
SUPFEMALE:read it and weep.
SUPFEMALE:11.
LEADMALE:87.
LEADMALE:well, at least i can go out to dinner.
SUPMALE:damn, i was hoping we'd have a little extra money to play around with.
LEADFEMALE:well, do you want extra money? 'cause you know, i have my own system for extra money.
LEADMALE:all right.
OTHERFEMALE:okay first we send in the phone bill and we forget to sign the check.
SUPMALE:there you go! then we send the water bill to the electric company, and the electric bill to the water company.
SUPFEMALE:now you're cooking.
LEADMALE:and you know that charge card bill? it never even showed up.
LEADMALE:that's illegal.
LEADFEMALE:well, we could call them up and tell them that the card got ripped off.
LEADFEMALE:roseanne, we gotta get back to reality here.
OTHERMALE:these bills aren't gonna go away.
LEADMALE:we gotta be responsible.
LEADMALE:why? because for once, we finally get a chance to get caught up.
LEADFEMALE:well, you never cared about catching up before, mr.
SUPMALE:1-800-rush-me-myamazing-new-handy-wrench.
LEADMALE:for 19.
SUPFEMALE:95, that was a great investment.
OTHERFEMALE:yeah, that's why it's out in the garage underneath that electric fish-scaler.
LEADMALE:hey, pal, you've blown your share of the family fortune.
LEADMALE:on what? well, that's irrelevant.
SUPFEMALE:i just think we should handle this money like adults.
SUPMALE:fine, we'll be adults.
OTHERMALE:but i don't want to.
LEADMALE:you will act like an adult.
LEADFEMALE:you can't make me.
LEADMALE:roseanne.
SUPMALE:roseanne, you will act responsible! all right, i'll act responsible.
SUPFEMALE:no perfume.
LEADMALE:right.
LEADMALE:no captain's bell.
LEADFEMALE:hey, dan do you think sometime soon you'll ever be standing out in the driveway in front of the truck when the brakes don't work? well, if you ask me, you oughta buy the perfume.
LEADFEMALE:well, i didn't ask you, so just drop it.
LEADFEMALE:you know what your problem is? besides you? your problem is that you and dan don't know how to manage your money, and that's why you're always broke.
OTHERFEMALE:we're always broke 'cause we live with three little moochers that are suckin' us dry.
LEADMALE:crystal, did they get that damn machine fixed yet? no, they're still working on it.
SUPFEMALE:good.
SUPFEMALE:you gotta learn to treat yourself once in a while, roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:buy yourself something.
OTHERMALE:take a vacation.
SUPMALE:spoken like a true single woman.
LEADMALE:it's a shame you and dan can't take a little bit of that money and go down to that theme motel in aurora.
SUPFEMALE:crystal, please.
SUPFEMALE:have you seen their ads on tv? it's so romantic.
OTHERFEMALE:every room is a different theme.
LEADFEMALE:they have a roaring '20s room, a wild west room, a roman empire room.
SUPMALE:yeah, i can see dan gettin' in his chariot, goin' out and buy a six-pack.
LEADFEMALE:oh, get out.
OTHERMALE:you know what i mean.
SUPFEMALE:come on, let's go see what they're doing in there.
LEADMALE:how much longer? man: five more minutes.
SUPFEMALE:here.
LEADMALE:what's this? you remember that 25 bucks i borrowed? that's ten back.
LEADFEMALE:keep it.
SUPFEMALE:i don't need it.
SUPFEMALE:take it.
LEADFEMALE:i don't want it.
LEADFEMALE:put a down payment on that perfume.
SUPMALE:would you stop with the perfume? i told you, me and dan decided we're not gonna spend the money on nothing frivolous.
SUPFEMALE:oh, right.
LEADMALE:and you do everything your husband tells you to do.
LEADFEMALE:don't start.
LEADMALE:you do, roseanne.
OTHERMALE:you're just like mom.
SUPMALE:i am nothing like that woman.
OTHERFEMALE:but you are exactly like her.
SUPMALE:whatever hubby says, goes.
OTHERFEMALE:well, if i really wanted that perfume, i would go get it.
SUPFEMALE:right, mom.
LEADFEMALE:well, i'll tell you something you don't know about mom.
LEADMALE:what? she used to pay your friends to play with you.
LEADFEMALE:shut up! ah.
LEADFEMALE:can i help you? oh, no, thank you.
SUPMALE:i was just looking.
LEADFEMALE:any particular fragrance? well, i was kind of interested in that one, "submission.
OTHERFEMALE:" we carry the complete "submission" line.
LEADFEMALE:were you interested in the body lotion, the eau de toilet, the dusting powder, the after-bath splash? well, i just kind of wanted to buy the regular perfume.
LEADMALE:oh, yes, of course, but perfume is really the final step in fragrance layering.
OTHERMALE:well, i wasn't that into getting layered, i just wanted to get the perfume.
SUPFEMALE:all righty.
SUPMALE:will this be cash or charge? charge.
SUPMALE:never mind, i'm not getting it.
SUPFEMALE:i'm sorry.
SUPMALE:i'm changing myi'm sorry.
LEADMALE:oh why don't you just try some on? i know what it smells like.
OTHERMALE:it really is a fabulous fragrance alluring, sensual.
SUPMALE:men love it.
LEADFEMALE:are you married? no.
LEADFEMALE:well, i bet you have a boyfriend.
LEADMALE:well, i am kind of shacking up with this one guy.
LEADMALE:trust me, a few drops of this will really excite him.
SUPMALE:well, that's what i live for, to excite that man.
LEADMALE:don't we all? what's your boyfriend's name? lance.
LEADMALE:sexy.
LEADMALE:he's a race car driver.
SUPFEMALE:oh.
LEADFEMALE:a man who likes danger.
LEADFEMALE:well, i just know a little of this will really turn him on.
SUPFEMALE:let's face it, deep down we women all want the same thing, so why not use a little help when we can get it? well, you do have a pretty good point there.
OTHERMALE:you know what the fastest way to a man's heart is? yeah, through his chest.
SUPMALE:freeze! don't even think about it.
LEADFEMALE:you better run.
LEADMALE:you better run! hey, dad! darlene, you shouldn't do that.
LEADFEMALE:you'll scare the animals.
SUPMALE:oh, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:hey, what's that? it's a rag.
LEADMALE:no, that.
LEADMALE:nothing.
LEADMALE:well, it's a bell.
LEADMALE:right, it's a bell.
LEADMALE:now scamper along.
LEADMALE:well, can i ring it? no.
LEADMALE:why not? because it's a surprise.
LEADFEMALE:for who? it doesn't matter for who.
OTHERMALE:now run along into the house.
SUPMALE:for mom? yeah, sort of.
LEADFEMALE:but what if she finds out? she's not gonna find out.
OTHERMALE:but what if she does? i mean, what if she asks me about it? i'd have to tell her the truth, wouldn't i? darlene, she's not going to ask you about it.
LEADMALE:there's your mother now.
OTHERMALE:now remember.
SUPFEMALE:no, i won't say anything unless she asks me.
SUPFEMALE:darlene, you are my favorite.
SUPMALE:dan: you home, roseanne? yes.
LEADFEMALE:hi, darling.
LEADMALE:hi.
LEADFEMALE:i got you some corn.
SUPMALE:oh, cool! let me help you put some of this stuff away.

LEADFEMALE:well, what about our talk? about no perfume, no bell.
LEADFEMALE:were those just empty words blowing in the wind? i shouldn't have bought it.
LEADFEMALE:well, you did buy it, and that's the undeniable fact.
SUPMALE:well, i'm taking it back.
SUPFEMALE:now, just hold on a minute.
LEADMALE:i'm taking it back.
LEADMALE:roseanne, taking it back is not gonna make either of us feel any better.
SUPFEMALE:well, i'm not keeping it.
LEADFEMALE:i mean, every time i put it on i just feel guilty.
OTHERFEMALE:look would it help if i went out right now and bought that stupid bell? 'cause i'd be willing to do that for you.
SUPMALE:you already bought that bell, didn't you? roseanne! you did! i didn't.
SUPMALE:you liar.
SUPMALE:did not.
LEADFEMALE:you bought that bell.
SUPMALE:i did not.
SUPMALE:look me in the eye and tell me you didn't buy that bell.
LEADFEMALE:i didn't buy that bell.
LEADFEMALE:ask not for whom the bell tolls.
LEADMALE:it tolls for thee, butt head.
OTHERFEMALE:ooh, that feels great.
SUPMALE:you could do this for a living.
LEADFEMALE:that's what old man spikeman said.
OTHERMALE:oh, you're sick! so, how do they look? snug.
SUPFEMALE:i gotta wash 'em again before i wear 'em to school so they'll be even tighter.
SUPFEMALE:how popular do you want to be? thanks, mom.
LEADMALE:okay, my turn.
SUPMALE:for what? i did you, now you gotta do me.
LEADMALE:says who? that's the deal, roseanne.
LEADMALE:what deal? i thought you were doing it out of pure love.
SUPFEMALE:no way! i bear you three beautiful children, i labor to make a warm and loving home and i've dedicated my whole life to you, and all i get is a lousy five-minute foot massage? all right, three more minutes.
LEADMALE:deal.
LEADFEMALE:
