SUPFEMALE:Wow! These menus are great.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Fisher says he normally charges $200.
LEADFEMALE:What's he gonna charge us? Well, I told him he could marry Jackie, And then we'd make up the difference.
LEADMALE:You know, I tried to get a hold of her last night.
LEADFEMALE:Have you seen her? No.

LEADFEMALE:They totally forget their family When a man gets involved.
LEADFEMALE:Something came up, okay? Oh, something came up.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure is fun working with sisters.
LEADMALE:Sorry, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Fisher and I needed to resolve Some problems in our relationship, And then we broke up.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're kidding, right? No.
LEADMALE:that pig! How could he dump you? Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:No, this is gonna turn out to be The very best thing that's ever happened to you, trust me.
LEADMALE:Fisher has got nothing going.
OTHERMALE:He's just a kid.
LEADFEMALE:He's got nothing going on at all.
OTHERFEMALE:He didn't break up with me.
LEADMALE:I broke up with him.
LEADMALE:Are you out of your mind? Why would you do that? He's the perfect guy for you.
SUPMALE:It was inevitable, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:We went to the lobo last weekend, And I went into the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:I came out, and he was talking to this woman Who was, like, his own age.
LEADMALE:He's flirting, okay? So you cut him off for a couple of weeks.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:He wasn't flirting, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:They were just talking, and then it hit me.
LEADFEMALE:They looked really right together.
LEADMALE:He and I are never gonna look that way.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you guys look really great together.
LEADMALE:You're so cute, I swear, It makes me want to retch, honest.
OTHERFEMALE:It's so obvious, And it's only a matter of time Before he sees it, too, And dumps me for a younger woman, So I dumped him before he could dump me.
SUPMALE:See, if you're gonna go disqualify Everyone that's gonna dump you, You're never gonna go out on a date again.
LEADFEMALE:I have had enough therapy to know When i'm in a self-destructive relationship.
LEADFEMALE:And since I can't break up with you, Then i'm gonna deal with this one.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you're not even listening to me! No, you're not listening to me.
LEADMALE:If you can't support me, then stay out of it.
LEADMALE:Oh, that is so unfair.
OTHERMALE:You know I can't stay out of it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll support your mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I made the team! I'm an otter! I'm a fighting otter! All right, d.j. ! How about a sandwich for the newest otter? You go wash up.
LEADMALE:I'll make you one.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, the conner dynasty continues.
LEADMALE:I knew he had to have some of the old man in him.
LEADMALE:What, did they take everybody? Just the ones that showed up.
LEADFEMALE:Is he gonna get to play? Only if he brings a deck of cards.
LEADMALE:It's a lost cause.
OTHERFEMALE:It's too bad fisher had to get up at 4 in the morning to coach him.
LEADMALE:Fisher? What was fisher-No, never mind.
LEADMALE:I don't care.
LEADMALE:I don't want to know.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go get some cheese for d.j. What was that all about? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Under the category "failed relationships" for 200, The answer is "Jackie and Fisher.
LEADMALE:" Roseanne, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't go through a breakup right now.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a bad time with d.j. And all.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, this time, it's gonna be different.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be the same as all the others.
LEADFEMALE:She's gonna fall apart, And then we have to put the pieces back together.
SUPFEMALE:How could he dump her right now When i'm at my most vulnerable? Brace yourself, Dan-she dumped him.
LEADMALE:She dumped him? Wow.
LEADMALE:He didn't say anything about it At practice this morning.
SUPMALE:Well, that's 'cause he's a man.
LEADMALE:You know, he probably didn't want to ruin Some precious hockey moment With some stupid outpouring of emotion.
LEADMALE:Here we go, d.j. , my little otter.
LEADFEMALE:Fighting otter.
LEADMALE:Fierce fighting otter.
LEADMALE:So how is hockey going? Great.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:And how is that coach of yours? You know, Fisher? He's cool.

LEADMALE:How did he say it? Did he seem depressed? Has he lost any weight? Is he seeing someone else? Talk to me, d.j. Mom! Okay, here's the pizza.
SUPFEMALE:How's Jackie? She's calmed down a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Now she's just hysterical.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene, I need ice cream.
SUPFEMALE:What about the pizza? No, she's right past the chewy manic phase Into the ice cream depression.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man.
OTHERMALE:How much longer is this gonna last? who knows? This may sound medieval, But there are still working convents.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you people.
LEADMALE:She's always gonna be there for us, And we are gonna be there for her For as long as it takes.
SUPMALE:Or until I can figure out How to get her the hell out of here.
SUPMALE:Here you go, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Your favorite-chocolate chocolate chip.
LEADFEMALE:Ahem.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you doing? Ha ha.
LEADFEMALE:Fisher liked ice cream.
SUPMALE:Well, that's a rare trait to find in a man, But there'll be other guys.
SUPMALE:I'm 37.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 37 years old.
LEADMALE:I had my first real date when I was 15.
OTHERMALE:That's 22 years' worth of dating.
LEADFEMALE:You'd think that in 22 years, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Right would have shown up.
LEADMALE:Well, he probably did, But you were out on a date with some reject.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's just a bad idea.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna call fisher.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Why aren't you stopping me? It's a local call.
LEADMALE:No matter what I do, You can't let me call Fisher.
OTHERFEMALE:You're supposed to be my support! If Fisher was here, he'd never let me pick up that phone.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, let's give him a call and find out.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I want to hear his side of it.
LEADMALE:What did he say when you broke up with him? Not much.
LEADMALE:I did all the talking.
LEADMALE:I just told him it was too intense.
SUPFEMALE:He was bringing me flowers all the time.
LEADMALE:He was calling me constantly.
LEADFEMALE:It was, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
SUPFEMALE:" That bastard.
SUPFEMALE:What else did you tell him? That's about it.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't tell him the real reason? Why should I? I know what the problems are, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:He's too young for me.
LEADFEMALE:He's not ready to get married, And by the time he wants kids, All my eggs will be dried up.
LEADFEMALE:I really don't need To hear him agree with me, okay? Okay.
LEADMALE:No, it's just crazy.
LEADMALE:He's the right guy! I broke up with him for the wrong reasons! I'm gonna call him.
LEADFEMALE:You stink at this.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Deej, this is how they line up for face-off.
LEADMALE:Now, what position are you gonna play tonight? The coach said i'd be equally good at any position.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Deej, It's not important how well you play Or how much you play Or even that you play at all.
LEADMALE:What is important? That's something you're gonna have to find out for yourself.
OTHERMALE:hey, can we have the pizza in here? Yeah, okay.
LEADFEMALE:If I don't get it out there in 30 seconds, It's free.
LEADFEMALE:So, Deej, you really want to know How to play hockey? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Say this guy's in front of you, And he's got the puck.
LEADFEMALE:What do you do? Try and steal it from him? No.
LEADMALE:You do this.
LEADMALE:Any questions? Well, there's a lot of excitement Here at the Lanford arena As we enter the second period Of the otters' home opener.
LEADFEMALE:The goalie is back from the restroom, And the action is resuming, And the Cinderella story of the evening Continues to be young d.j. Conner on the ice, Much to the surprise of his entire family.
LEADFEMALE:And oh, there's a breakaway! There's a breakaway! Young conner moves towards the goal.
LEADMALE:He shoots.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! He forgot the puck! And, Roseanne, why don't you pick us up on the action? Okay, uh, there's a little kid-I don't know his name.
LEADFEMALE:He shoots the puck to this other little kid, And I don't know his name, either-Okay, back to me! What's your take on the game, Jackie? Back to me again.
SUPMALE:Hey, that kid's a maniac! Get him off the ice! He's gonna hurt somebody! Wow.
LEADFEMALE:What a body check.
LEADMALE:Who would have thought the little runt would be a thug? Hey, it ain't his fault.
SUPFEMALE:It's that one kid that took the puck.
LEADFEMALE:Go over there and make sure he's all right.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go, Deej.

OTHERFEMALE:So how's d.j. Doing? I don't see him out there.
OTHERMALE:Oh, he's in his office.
LEADMALE:Like he really cares.
LEADFEMALE:What's that supposed to mean? He just showed up here because he knew i'd be here.
SUPMALE:I can't reach you on the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to talk to you.
LEADMALE:This is totally unfair.
LEADFEMALE:You can't break up with someone without telling 'em why.
LEADFEMALE:Tell him why, Jackie.
LEADMALE:I don't have nothing to say.
SUPMALE:And stay out of it for once, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:It's your life.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks the age difference is a problem.
LEADFEMALE:You know, she thinks there's a huge gap Between 25 and 37.
SUPMALE:I thought you said you were 34.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now, see? This failure to communicate Is maybe what's screwing up the relationship.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you're doing.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I'm out of it.
SUPFEMALE:She don't think you want to get married.
LEADFEMALE:Don't-I didn't say that! Stop talking to him.
SUPFEMALE:You did too say that.
OTHERFEMALE:You said by the time he's ready to have kids, All your eggs is gonna be all dried up.
LEADMALE:Can I say something here? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you should let her finish, okay? She has a very important point to make, Fisher.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, after all, You probably will dump her for some younger woman.
LEADMALE:Hold it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you thought that.
LEADFEMALE:As much fun as we have together, I never think of you being older than me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh You really mean that? Of course I mean it.
SUPMALE:I never said I didn't want to get married or have kids.
LEADMALE:We never even talked about it.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a real sensitive subject for me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this is crazy.
LEADMALE:Why don't we go someplace? We'll get some coffee and we'll talk about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, i'd really like that.
SUPFEMALE:I was miserable without you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Will you take your squabbling elsewhere So I can see my kid play his last hockey game? Okay, but next time, stay out of it.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
SUPFEMALE:Where are they going? They're going to try to figure out How to thank me For saving their miserable lives.
LEADFEMALE:My hero.
SUPMALE:Hey, look, they're gonna let the little monster out of his cage.
SUPFEMALE:d.j. ! d.j. ! d.j. ! d.j. ! d.j. ! Ooh! oh! Oh! Where does a kid get that kind of hostility? Did you see how hard I skated into that goalie? When I hit him, I heard something pop.

LEADMALE:Well, don't you think it's just a tad bit Completely insane? Why can't you ever be supportive of what i'm doing? I'm waiting for you to do something right.
LEADMALE:Well, I just want you to be happy for me.
SUPMALE:Oh, okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Listen to this.
