OTHERFEMALE:Oh, why? Is he still tankin' all his job interviews? I'm just worried about the way he's saying his words.
LEADMALE:Like, he won't say "triangle.
SUPMALE:" He says "tri-an-gle.
SUPFEMALE:" Or "hel-lo.
LEADMALE:" Pauly shore makes millions of dollars saying that.
OTHERFEMALE:So they're just gonna run some tests, Check his palette, make sure his hearing's all right.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna borrow your book on child development, okay? Yeah, but it's really old.

LEADMALE:Oh, really? Oh, no wonder i'm starting to feel all shy and giggly.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Dan? Have you heard about the minimum-security prison They're building outside of town? They're building a prison in Lanford? No wonder the beauty parlor's been so crowded lately.
LEADMALE:Um, well, they're-they're spending millions on this thing.
OTHERFEMALE:And we were wondering if maybe You'd be interested in getting the old crew together And putting a bid in on the drywalling? Look, I know you got it good at the garage, But this'd be a chance to make a pretty good chunk of dough.
SUPFEMALE:Look, guys, I appreciate you thinking of me, But i'm pretty happy where I am.
OTHERFEMALE:And he's not kidding.
OTHERMALE:That couch under him has hardly even faded.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure, Dan? I mean, it's gonna be a bundle.

LEADFEMALE:Somehow.
LEADMALE:And you're gonna have fun on that too, honey.
SUPMALE:You're not gonna need that old thing anymore, 'cause that magic box sings and talks And plays music.

OTHERFEMALE:Voice: welcome.
LEADFEMALE:You've got mail.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Dan: gee! D'oh! Who put that there--? oh! Who put that there? Why don't you just turn on the light? I didn't want to wake you.
LEADMALE:It's this whole prison drywall thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't get it out of my mind.
SUPMALE:Am I crazy, Roseanne? Should I go for it? Yes.
OTHERMALE:You gave that no thought at all.
OTHERMALE:Now should I do it? No.
SUPMALE:Roseanne! Do you think we could talk about this later, Dan? Come on now, you're ruining our quality time together.
LEADMALE:I'm serious, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you already told 'em no.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to the i've-got-a-great-jobat-the-garage thing? Is-is it such a great job? Well yeah, I mean it's the first steady money we've ever had coming in.
OTHERMALE:Except for that coupon scam we ran in the '70s.
LEADFEMALE:What? Just a reminder.
LEADMALE:My bedroom's right above yours.
OTHERMALE:Well yeah, sorry we woke you.
LEADMALE:But now that you're up, go mow the lawn.
SUPMALE:Now let's just look at the pros and cons.
SUPFEMALE:Now it's true, the garage is steady.
LEADMALE:And even if I got this prison job, That doesn't mean there's another job around the corner.
SUPFEMALE:So work slow.
LEADMALE:But the garage is boring.
SUPMALE:It fries my mind.
OTHERMALE:I come home every night, i'm like a zombie.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, not like when you were doing the drywall And you came home and you'd put on all those puppet shows.
LEADMALE:You'd wear those straw hats and strum that ukulele.
OTHERFEMALE:what? Yes, we know.
LEADMALE:Your bedroom is beneath ours.
LEADFEMALE:No, not that.
OTHERFEMALE:I was getting something to drink And the word ukulele caught my ear.
LEADMALE:I love the ukulele.
LEADMALE:Do you have a ukulele? Night.
LEADMALE:Night.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Now i'll lose all my city benefits if I quit.
OTHERMALE:But i'd be making twice as much money Working for the prison.
SUPMALE:But it's a gamble, and should we be gambling With a new baby? Yeah, Dan, you know When conners gamble, conners lose.
SUPMALE:Of course, There was that time at the state fair Where you made that frog land on that lily pad.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Plus we got the diner.
OTHERFEMALE:We got two mortgages.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, and the diner needs new wallpaper And appliances And some of them golden arches.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, it's settled.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:I'm sticking where I am.
LEADFEMALE:Hallelujah.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dan? Yeah? Since you woke me up, I just want you to know That i'm gonna have some trouble getting back to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:So? So that means you are too.
LEADMALE:I knew that.
SUPFEMALE:Dan? yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Just checking.
LEADFEMALE:My name is mommy and I will be your waitress tonight.
SUPFEMALE:We have specials on the menu Including tender sweet peas, Turkey in its own broth, And peaches.
LEADFEMALE:I know these are good 'cause me and your dad Make peach daiquiris out of them.
LEADMALE:How long have I been a waitress? Well, not very long.
SUPFEMALE:And i'm just doing it Till an acting job opens up.
SUPMALE:And your dad fixes trucks for the city And he's only doing that Till another one breaks.
LEADFEMALE:The best thing about your dad's job is that it's secure.
LEADMALE:You know? Because the last big risk we took Was having you and that was a very big risk, But that's just the kind of people we are.
SUPMALE:Or were.
SUPFEMALE:I know what you're thinking.
SUPMALE:You're thinking, "well, since you took such a big risk with me And that turned out so good, How come you're playing it safe now?" Quit grilling me.
SUPFEMALE:Because, See, Risks are for younger people, Not us.
LEADMALE:See, when you get to be me and your dad's age, You want to know that you can do the same thing over and over again, You know, till you die.
LEADMALE:Okay, so let's just hypothetically say That your dad does take this job at the prison, right? And what about when that job's over? Then what is he gonna do? 'course, the way this country's going now, I think they're always gonna be building new prisons.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, 'cause, you know, The way people hardly have to pay for what they do at all, It kind of makes crime look like a really good thing to get into.
LEADMALE:So a lot more people are gonna be doing it, you know? And just by the sheer odds, a lot more of them are gonna get caught.
SUPMALE:So I think they're gonna be building a lot of prisons, man.
LEADMALE:I think those things are gonna start going up faster than starbucks.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and then, like, the people in these prisons You know, they're gonna need to eat.
SUPFEMALE:So me and Jackie, maybe we get in on the ground floor with some catering kind of business, you know? And pretty soon convicts from all over the world Will be coming to eat loose meat in Lanford, Illinois.
LEADFEMALE:Dan? That's it.
LEADFEMALE:You're quitting that boring job at the city, And you're gonna apply for that construction bid.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
LEADMALE:What? No, i've really been thinking about this For, you know, the last couple of minutes, And this is a big opportunity here And I think we should take it.
SUPMALE:Roseanne, is this your way of telling me that you drank all my beer? No, I was just sitting here, And I was talking to the baby and-Okay, this sounds pretty grounded already.
SUPMALE:No, Dan, he made me realize That the thing that was always so great about us Is that we always took a chance, you know? And this is a chance.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you're going awful fast here.
LEADMALE:Slow down a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You know you want to do this.
LEADMALE:Let's take the risk.
LEADMALE:Look at him, Dan.
LEADMALE:He is just the greatest success We have ever had.
LEADMALE:Something's in the air.
LEADMALE:I mean, look it, Darlene gets offered all these really great jobs And becky's applying to colleges And everything's changing, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:It's like We're on some huge cosmic roll now.
LEADFEMALE:I guess.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should go for it.
LEADMALE:All right, let's go for it.
LEADMALE:Yeah! All right, here.
OTHERMALE:Take over.
SUPMALE:'cause this is my last day as a city employee's wife, So, fedco, here I come.
