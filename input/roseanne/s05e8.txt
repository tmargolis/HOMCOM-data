SUPMALE:hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I think I found The perfect creamer for the restaurant.
LEADMALE:What do you think? I think in the wrong hands, Petty cash can be a dangerous thing.
OTHERMALE:No one appreciates my pain.
OTHERMALE:Which is why you should not be alone all the time.
LEADMALE:No, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:What, you don't even know what i'm gonna say.
OTHERFEMALE:You're gonna fix me up With another one of Dan's friends.
LEADFEMALE:That just shows you how wrong you are.
SUPMALE:I was gonna say something totally different.
LEADMALE:What? Well, now I forget.
SUPMALE:The only thing I can think about Is this one friend of dan's That'd be really perfect for you.
LEADMALE:I'm not looking.
LEADFEMALE:Can we just drop it? Come on, Nancy, just 'cause you haven't met anybody lately Doesn't mean you should just give up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, besides, this friend of Dan's, I think he is doing really, really well, okay? 'cause he just blew a ton of money on these hair plugs.
LEADMALE:Sounds like a dream, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Think i'll take a pass.
LEADMALE:No, you won't, because I told him You were gonna call him this morning, And I just know you guys are really-No.
LEADMALE:I'm already seeing someone.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank god, because this bald guy's a real loser.
OTHERMALE:So, come on, tell us about the guy.
OTHERFEMALE:What's his name? We're just gonna bug you 'til you do.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's too soon.
LEADMALE:It's too soon.
LEADMALE:Come on! Tell us, tell us! You big baby.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Her name is Marla.
LEADMALE:I'm seeing a woman.
LEADMALE:What? No, you aren't.
SUPFEMALE:I'm serious.
LEADMALE:I'm gay.
LEADMALE:Ah, you're just screwing with us, right? No.
OTHERFEMALE:So what do you think? Well, it's really surprising.
LEADMALE:I mean, when did this happen? Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You and I used to go out looking for guys all the time.
SUPMALE:We went to all those singles' dances together.
LEADFEMALE:Singles' dances? I thought we were dating.
LEADMALE:Joke.
LEADMALE:Joke.
LEADFEMALE:Just kidding.
LEADMALE:But--well, I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you meet her? At the cosmetic counter at Rodbell's.
LEADMALE:She does makeovers.
SUPMALE:Well, she's certainly thorough.
LEADFEMALE:So Did you do it? Oh, Roseanne.
OTHERMALE:You don't just ask that right away.
SUPMALE:For god's sakes.
OTHERMALE:Why didn't you tell us about it before? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I was scared, And I didn't know how you'd react.
LEADMALE:Well, we'd react the same way we react When you tell us anything personal-We make fun of you 'til it gets old, And then we move on.
LEADFEMALE:I can feel the love.
SUPMALE:It's just so strange.
SUPFEMALE:So weird, I mean So when did you start liking women? I mean, you were married to Arnie.
SUPMALE:Arnie turned her gay.
LEADMALE:Well, sleeping with Arnie would turn any woman gay.
OTHERMALE:Some women.
SUPMALE:Well, it's just like I see it on this Oprah show, okay? Well, they had these women on there, And they says that you're born gay, You know, that it's like a chemical thing and everything.
LEADMALE:But then right after that, I see on Donahue They had on these straight women Who had tried that for a while, But they says it's just a phase.
SUPMALE:Well, I think I may have always been a lesbian.
SUPFEMALE:I was just in denial.
LEADFEMALE:I think maybe Arnie was the phase.
LEADFEMALE:Think that's possible? Oh, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:"lesbians in denial.
LEADFEMALE:" Sally jessy.
LEADMALE:Last Thursday.
OTHERMALE:Oh, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't get it, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:There had to have been some signs.
SUPMALE:Well, Nancy always liked that Miss Hathaway On the Beverly Hillbillies.
OTHERMALE:I think that says it all.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Imagine what it would be like Going through life without wanting or needing a man.
SUPMALE:What do you think it's like, anyway, Two women living together? Oh, that's easy.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, it's my turn to be unselfish and giving! No! You got to be unselfish and giving yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:Today, you have to be supportive and nurturing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, this could be good.
LEADMALE:No espn.
LEADMALE:Twice the pms.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid i'm gonna feel weird around Nancy now.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, what if she starts checking me out? Well, she probably already has.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you said you guys went to buy swimsuits together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, relax, Jackie.
LEADMALE:She can control herself.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like she's a man.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just so weird.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, she's still your friend.
SUPFEMALE:She just happens to be gay.
OTHERFEMALE:What's for lunch? And who's gay? Loose meat, and none of your business.
LEADMALE:Oh, I probably already know anyway.
LEADFEMALE:It's Dr.
SUPMALE:Summers, your gynecologist.
SUPFEMALE:My gynecologist is a lesbian? Hey, she's still your gynecologist.
LEADMALE:She just happens to be a lesbian.
SUPMALE:Chill.
OTHERFEMALE:I was just messing with your head.
LEADFEMALE:So who is it? No.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, come on.
OTHERMALE:She's gonna find out about it somehow.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't you rather it came from her mother With a little explanation? No, not really.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, I hate this.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, well, before I tell you, Let me ask you a question.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, do you ever watch Sally Jessy? Mom, I pretty much already know about lesbians, And what I don't you'd be too embarrassed to tell me.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Well It's Nancy.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:How'd you find out? Did she tell you? No, we saw the "i'm a big old dyke" Bumper sticker on her car.
OTHERFEMALE:I still don't see how we could have missed it, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:How could we not have known that Nancy is a lesbian? Well, she doesn't look like a lesbian, you know? I mean, lesbians are big ol' truck drivers That wear flannel shirts and faded jeans.
LEADMALE:So what do you think, mom? I picked out the linoleum myself.
SUPFEMALE:Looks pretty great, huh? I'm a silent partner.
OTHERFEMALE:It shouldn't matter what I think.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, thanks, mom.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't be so sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I have some wonderful news.
SUPMALE:I found a place to live in Lanford.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:It's nowhere near either of you.
LEADMALE:Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, we're so happy for you, then.
OTHERMALE:You might have heard of it.
SUPFEMALE:It's called harvest glen.
SUPMALE:Isn't that a retirement place? No, they call it a senior community.
LEADMALE:Well, you can't live there.
SUPMALE:That's for old people.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:It's mom's decision.
LEADMALE:I think we should support her in it.
LEADMALE:Mom, you have my support.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Jackie.
SUPMALE:Jackie, they tie old people into chairs at places like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Please don't screw this up.
LEADMALE:Harvest glen is nothing like that.
LEADMALE:It's not a nursing home.
OTHERMALE:Lots of people my age live there, And they have all kinds of activities-Workshops, golfing, day trips.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds great.
OTHERFEMALE:And I assume that there's some sort of curfew.
LEADMALE:Nobody off the grounds after, what, 5, 6? They're having an open-house tomorrow, And i'd like both of you to come along And see how nice it is.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but if I see one old person tied to anything, I'm leaving.
OTHERMALE:Bonjour.
SUPMALE:Marla, Roseanne, Jackie, their mom Bev.
SUPMALE:This is marla.
SUPFEMALE:I just brought her in To show her my new enterprise.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:I know you.
LEADMALE:Didn't you sell me moisturizer the other day at Rodbell's? You know, I think you're right.
SUPFEMALE:That's exactly how we met.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but Nancy got the free gift.
LEADMALE:There was a free gift? You don't want that gift, mom.
LEADFEMALE:It was only available to certain customers.
SUPFEMALE:And this customer's satisfied.
SUPFEMALE:Can we--can-You want to check out the bathroom, mom? I'm sure you're gonna hate the wallpaper We put up in there.
SUPFEMALE:You finished the bathroom? I wanna go see it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Nancy is so lucky To have friends that are so supportive.
SUPMALE:Oh, Nancy is so great.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she is great.
OTHERFEMALE:She's great, And she's, uh, very--really funny.
LEADMALE:Hey, listen, you guys don't have to sell me on Nancy.
LEADMALE:I mean, we hit it off right away.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we're just glad she's happy.
SUPMALE:Not that she was unhappy.
LEADMALE:Or desperate.
SUPFEMALE:She's, er Really very popular.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, popular.
LEADMALE:She could have her pick of-Well, as it turns out, anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Do all the units have the same carpeting? We just put it in.
LEADMALE:We picked a nice neutral tone.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you like it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, it's just fine.
LEADFEMALE:I have lots of throw rugs.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go check the laundry room.
LEADFEMALE:Lint traps tell you a lot about your neighbors.
LEADMALE:So what do you think? I love the place.
SUPMALE:Isn't it great, Roseanne? How soon can we drop her off? What's this for? Oh, well, it's a medical alert button.
SUPFEMALE:There's one in every room.
LEADFEMALE:If there's an emergency, All you have to do is press it, And an ambulance will be here immediately.
LEADFEMALE:Immediately, huh? Roseanne, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and here is something else that's kind of neat.
LEADMALE:This is a motorized lift chair For our tenants who have a little trouble Getting up out of the seated position.
LEADMALE:That's not too depressing.
LEADMALE:Hey, you get your own chair.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, you big baby! You know, before Bev gets back, We want you to know that this is more Than just a place for her to reside.
OTHERFEMALE:We want to do everything we can To take the burden off you and your sister.
LEADMALE:You must have an awfully large staff.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:What I mean is, you see, the price of the condo Includes long-term medical attention.
LEADMALE:You know, when it becomes necessary, Your mother will be automatically relocated Into a bed in our constant care wing.
LEADMALE:What happens to her apartment? Oh, well, it'll go back to a pool To be resold to new residents.
SUPMALE:Well, what if she gets better? Now, this is a long way off.
OTHERMALE:Obviously, your mom is in great shape.
SUPFEMALE:No, but, I mean, I want to know What happens if she gets better.
LEADFEMALE:They're not young people, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Wonderful laundry facility, Although it is a bit of a meet market.
LEADMALE:Mom, you better think about this a little bit.
LEADMALE:Nonsense, I think i'm ready to sign right now.
SUPMALE:No, you're not, mom.
LEADMALE:You need to think about it a little bit more.
SUPFEMALE:Mom knows what she wants, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:She does not.
LEADMALE:Yes, I do.
OTHERMALE:I hope you're not calling mom stupid, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:Well, what else do you call paying for a condo That they take back, And medical care that you might never use? Mom could get run over by a bus tomorrow, and they hit the jackpot! Don't say that, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Mom could lapse into a coma, live 40 years as a vegetable, And she cleans up.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think this is up to either of you.
SUPMALE:It's my money and my life.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, well, if you want to go throwing them both away, I mean, if you're feeble-minded enough To want to take this deal, Then maybe you should be in a home.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if you're narrow-minded enough to try to stop me, Maybe you ought to go home and not come back.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Well, listen to that.
OTHERFEMALE:It sounds like another condo's ready to open up.
OTHERFEMALE:The place is perfect, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:You know how hard it is for mom to make friends? There are hundreds of people there.
LEADFEMALE:It would take her years to alienate them all.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you just want her out of your face.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course I do, But I still think it would be good for mom.
OTHERMALE:Why are you fighting her moving so hard? Well, how come you ain't fighting it at all? Because I think it's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't you get it, Jackie? That would be the last place mom would ever live.
LEADFEMALE:That's the place we have to go get her stuff After she dies.
SUPMALE:Why worry about it now? It's so far in the future.
SUPMALE:We don't know that.
OTHERFEMALE:Gosh, she's 63.
LEADMALE:She can only get insurance from art linklater.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you so freaked out about this? Because it's just really weird to be planning mom's death.
LEADMALE:We have been planning her death for years.
OTHERFEMALE:Plotting, not planning.
SUPMALE:All right, fine.
OTHERMALE:So it's up in our face now.
LEADFEMALE:You knew we'd have to deal with it sooner or later.
SUPFEMALE:I know, but I just thought it would be later-You know, way later, like when we're more mature.
LEADFEMALE:We are mature Kinda.
LEADMALE:How old do you feel? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Most of the time thirty Well, I feel like i'm 16 With an 18-year-old married daughter, Two mortgages, and a mother going into a retirement home.
SUPMALE:I wish I was old enough to drink.
LEADMALE:It's not that bad, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I'm 40, Jackie.
SUPMALE:This is all just going way too fast.
SUPMALE:How long 'til i'm shuffling towards That medical alert button? I'm not gonna listen to this.
OTHERFEMALE:You're still young.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Darlene? Do you think of me as young? Well, that depends.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, if you mean young As in vibrant and full of life, Well, I guess I do.
LEADMALE:On the other hand, if you mean young as in open-minded, And willing to accept new ideas, Then I guess you qualify in that area also.
LEADMALE:Best of all, I think of you as a friend and contemporary.
SUPMALE:I must be getting old.
OTHERMALE:I walked right into that one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess that's it, uh, mom, Unless you want me to stick around And help unpack this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, you went forks, knives, Serving spoons, spoons.
LEADFEMALE:Different! I'm not afraid of change.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what are you doing here? Well, I just thought i'd stop by and bring mom a gift.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Make me look bad.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to wal-mart.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Well, here.
LEADFEMALE:I brought this for you.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you, Roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I better put it somewhere where it won't drip.
LEADMALE:Well, i'm surprised to see you, Considering how you feel.
SUPMALE:Well, it's not like I can stop you or nothing.
LEADMALE:But you know, you can still get out of this whole deal.
SUPFEMALE:You know, if you want, we can just go to 'em And tell 'em that you're senile or something.
LEADMALE:That's sweet, dear, but I don't think senility Would get you out of an old folks home.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I just never want to come in here And find you acting like an old person.
LEADMALE:You don't have to worry about that.
LEADMALE:I don't feel like an old person.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so, how old do you feel? No, I know that.
SUPMALE:But I mean, like, on the inside, You know, how old do you feel? I'm 63.
LEADMALE:I feel like a 63-year-old woman.
LEADFEMALE:How nice having this talk with you, mom.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to say, Roseanne? Well, I want you to say that you feel, like, You know, 16 or 24 or 35.
LEADMALE:Anything but 63.
LEADMALE:But what's wrong with 63? Well, it's old! I don't want you to get old.
LEADFEMALE:I know, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Because you're just dragging me with you, And I don't like it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, dear, I don't get older Just to inconvenience you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm old.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're not old, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I feel old.
LEADMALE:Listen, why can't you just forget about all this, You know, and just go get a regular apartment? And then later on, if you need to, Well, then, you can just move in with Dan and me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, me.
OTHERMALE:I appreciate the offer, dear, And I did consider it.
LEADFEMALE:I just think strangers would take better care of me.
LEADMALE:I think it'll look great over the register.
LEADFEMALE:How come my head's so damn big? It's a caricature, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Your head is supposed to be big.
SUPMALE:Well, nobody else's head is that big.
SUPFEMALE:How come I got a great big old melon head? I mean, in real life, Nancy's head's way bigger than mine.
OTHERMALE:Hello, everyone.
SUPMALE:hi.
SUPMALE:I just thought this would look better Here in the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I can't stay long.
OTHERFEMALE:The harvest glen players are doing You're a good man, Charlie Brown, And i'm up for the role of Lucy.
LEADMALE:I bet you'll get it, 'cause they probably have, what, Six understudies for every part, You know, in case snoopy breaks his hip.

SUPFEMALE:Good luck.

LEADMALE:Sure, they're lesbians.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a lesbian.
