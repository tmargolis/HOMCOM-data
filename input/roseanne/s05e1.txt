LEADFEMALE:Your mother and I have decided to close the bike shop.
SUPFEMALE:We're having a "going out of business" sale and then locking the doors on Friday.
LEADMALE:And I don't have a job, so that means no income.
LEADMALE:How'd we do? What are we gonna do for money? Well, I'm gonna go back to dry-walling And maybe repair a couple of bikes out of the garage, And until things pick up, it's gonna be pretty tight around here.
LEADMALE:So it's just a real good thing that we never gave you anything, Or this could come as a painful blow.
SUPMALE:Wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:What's gonna happen to Mark? He's a good mechanic.
LEADFEMALE:He'll find something.
SUPMALE:You are gonna help him find another job, aren't you? I don't have a job And your mother doesn't have a job, But we'll make Mark our first priority.
SUPMALE:How is he gonna pay the rent? He has an apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like you're back to making heel marks on the ceiling of his car, Beck.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, dar.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Beck, I don't know why, but I thought maybe the first words out of your mouth might be, "sorry you lost your business, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:We know how much it meant to you.
LEADMALE:" I guess it's gonna sound a lot less sincere now when I say it.
LEADMALE:This is great.
SUPMALE:This is just great.
