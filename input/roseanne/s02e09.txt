SUPMALE:POOR LITTLE BIRD.
LEADFEMALE:THEY PROBABLY HUNG YOU UP BY YOUR TOES IN A DARK ROOM SOMEWHERE TILL IT WAS TIME TO CUT OFF YOUR HEAD.
LEADMALE:WELL, STOP COMPLAINING! MY HEADACHE'S JUST BEGINNING.
SUPFEMALE:HERE I AM, STUFFING BREADCRUMBS UP A DEAD BIRD'S BUTT.
LEADMALE:OH, THERE'S YOUR AUNT JACKIE NOW.
LEADFEMALE:10 BUCKS SAYS SHE FORGOT YOUR CRANBERRY SAUCE.
SUPFEMALE:HI.
LEADMALE:I'M NOT UP YET.
LEADMALE:I DROVE OVER HERE IN FIRST GEAR.
SUPFEMALE:DID YOU BRING? ONE CAN FOR 12 PEOPLE? WELL, I WON'T HAVE ANY.
SUPFEMALE:I WON'T HAVE ANY.
SUPFEMALE:WANT ME TO GO BACK TO THE STORE? I'LL GO BACK.
OTHERFEMALE:NO, NO.
LEADFEMALE:WHEN MOM CALLS FOR THE 20th TIME TO SEE WHAT SHE CAN BRING, I'LL JUST TELL HER.
LEADMALE:IT'LL MAKE HER DAY.
SUPFEMALE:THERE YOU GO.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING OF INVITING SOMEBODY OVER THIS AFTERNOON-FOR WHAT? YOU KNOW.
OTHERFEMALE:OH, SO MOM WILL THINK YOU'RE SEEING SOMEBODY AND GET OFF YOUR CASE? YES.
LEADMALE:IF SHE STARTS WITH ME TODAY-WELL, DON'T LET HER.
LEADFEMALE:AND DON'T YOU START WITH HER, NEITHER.
SUPMALE:I DON'T START WITH HER! YOU START WITH HER CONSTANTLY.
LEADFEMALE:AND YOU CONSTANTLY TAKE HER SIDE.
LEADMALE:WHENEVER YOU'RE AROUND MOM, YOU TURN INTO A SPINELESS, COWERING WIMP.
SUPFEMALE:OH, PLEASE! YOU'RE A WIMP, ROSEANNE.
LEADMALE:WIMP, WIMP, WIMP! HEY, HEY, HEY.
OTHERFEMALE:AT LEAST I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MOM.
SUPMALE:OH, HERE WE GO! YOU DIDN'T EVEN CALL HER ON HER BIRTHDAY.
LEADFEMALE:OH, GOD, YOU SOUND JUST LIKE HER.
SUPMALE:"YOU DON'T CALL, YOU DON'T WRITE, YOU NEVER TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON!" WHAT'S GOING ON? NOTHING.
LEADFEMALE:GO BACK TO SLEEP.
SUPFEMALE:I HEARD ALL THE YELLING AND THOUGHT MAYBE YOUR PARENTS GOT HERE.
SUPMALE:I JUST WANT THIS TO BE A NICE THANKSGIVING.
SUPFEMALE:IT WILL BE.
SUPMALE:I WANT EVERYBODY TO GET ALONG.
LEADFEMALE:EVERYBODY WILL BE FINE.
OTHERFEMALE:THINK IT'S TOO EARLY FOR A BLOODY MARY? I'LL GET IT, IT'S JIMMY! HELLO? OH, HI, GRANDMA.
SUPFEMALE:YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT HERE.
SUPMALE:OH, HI, MA.
SUPMALE:YEAH, YEAH, AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU CAN PICK ME UP TWO CANS OF THAT CRANBERRY SAUCE.
OTHERMALE:YOU KNOW, THE JELLY KIND THAT COMES IN A CAN LIKE WE HAVE EVERY YEAR.
SUPMALE:YEAH, JACKIE COMES OVER AND BRINGS ONE CAN FOR 12 PEOPLE, AND IT'S ALL DENTED.
LEADMALE:YEAH, NO, I DON'T NEED A GRAVY BOAT, JUST THE CRANBERRY SAUCE, MA.
LEADFEMALE:NO, JUST THE CRANBERRY SAUCE.
SUPMALE:NO, I HAVE ROLLS, MOM.
SUPMALE:MOM.
SUPFEMALE:MOM! JUST THE CRANBERRY SAUCE.
LEADMALE:OK, THANKS.
OTHERFEMALE:OH! THE SIX IS STARTING TO COME OFF.
OTHERMALE:GOOD, THEN I CAN BURN THAT SHIRT.
SUPFEMALE:SHIRT.
LEADMALE:SHE CALLED IT A SHIRT.
LEADMALE:THIS JERSEY HAPPENS TO REPRESENT TRADITION.
LEADMALE:YEAH, 17 YEARS OF YOU ROLLING AROUND IN THE MUD LIKE A GREAT BIG OLD HOG EVERY THANKSGIVING.
LEADFEMALE:I THINK THE QUESTION HERE TODAY IS-CAN DAMAGING DAN CONNER STOP THE PASSING ATTACK OF ONE DR.
SUPMALE:ZAK BEIRMAN? I THINK I CAN.
LEADFEMALE:WELL-MAYBE YOU CAN WARM UP, YOU KNOW, START BY MOVING THE COUCH A COUPLE FEET SO I CAN SET UP THE KIDS' TABLE.
LEADMALE:RED RIGHT! RED RIGHT! HUT! AAH! AAH! HEY, I MAY NEED YOU TO DO THAT TO MY MOM LATER ON TONIGHT.
SUPMALE:I'D LOVE TO.
LEADMALE:I ALSO NEED YOU TO GO OUT TO THE GARAGE, BRING IN A COUPLE CHAIRS, YOU KNOW, AND WIPE THEM OFF.
SUPMALE:OK, BECKY! DARLENE! SIS! LET'S GO! I'M READY.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO.
LEADMALE:I JUST DON'T THINK TODAY'S A GOOD DAY FOR YOU TO DROP THE BOMB ABOUT YOU BEING A COP.
SUPMALE:WHY NOT? BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE MOM DROP DEAD OF A HEART ATTACK AT THE DINNER TABLE.
LEADFEMALE:WHY NOT? WISH ME LUCK.
OTHERFEMALE:OK.
LEADMALE:HIT 'EM HIGH, HIT 'EM LOW.
LEADFEMALE:BRING ME BACK SOME ICE.
LEADFEMALE:ROSEANNE.
LEADMALE:WHY SHOULDN'T I TELL MOM ABOUT ME BECOMING A COP? SHE'S ALWAYS COMPLAINING THAT I NEVER TELL HER WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY LIFE.
SUPMALE:OH, JACKIE, PLEASE.
LEADMALE:I JUST WANT, LIKE, ONE THANKSGIVING WITHOUT ALL THE INSANITY.
OTHERFEMALE:HOW ARE YOU GONNA AVOID THAT? THEY'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR 24, COUNT THEM, BECAUSE I'VE TAKEN CARE OF IT.
SUPMALE:THEY'RE STAYING IN A MOTEL.
LEADMALE:NO.
LEADMALE:THREE WEEKS AGO, I MADE THEM A RESERVATION AT THE LANFORD MOTEL.
LEADFEMALE:NO.
LEADFEMALE:I REQUESTED A PADDED ROOM WITH A VIEW.
LEADMALE:WHAT'D MOM SAY? WELL I HAVEN'T EXACTLY TOLD HER YET.
LEADMALE:DIDN'T EXACTLY TELL HER YET! YOU KNOW, I GOT THE NICEST CARD FROM ED.

LEADFEMALE:IS HE? NO.
LEADMALE:THEY'RE HERE! THEY'RE HERE! GRANDMA KISS ALERT.
LEADFEMALE:GET YOUR PAPER TOWELS READY.

LEADMALE:WE WILL JUST HOLD ON THE BAGS FOR LATER.
LEADMALE:CAN I GET YOU GUYS A DRINK? OH, I NEED A COUPLE OF ASPIRIN.
SUPFEMALE:I'LL GET THAT.
LEADMALE:WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT'S WRONG IS I SPENT TWO HOURS IN THE CAR WITH THIS WOMAN, AND EVERY EXIT WE PASS ON THE ENTIRE INTERSTATE, SHE SAYS TO ME, "YOU DON'T WANT THAT EXIT.
SUPFEMALE:" SOMETIMES HE TAKES A WRONG TURN.
SUPMALE:WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SISTER'S HAIR? NOTHING.

OTHERMALE:I SENT HIM AND HIS WIFE ON A CRUISE.
SUPFEMALE:YOU KNOW, TO SAVE THEIR MARRIAGE.
OTHERMALE:I SENT THEM TO THE CARIBBEAN DURING HURRICANE SEASON.
SUPFEMALE:THEY DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.
LEADFEMALE:ROSIE.
SUPMALE:I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE YOUR FATHER VERY HAPPY.
LEADMALE:YOU SHOULD ASK HIM TO CARVE THE TURKEY.
LEADMALE:HOW YOU BOYS DOING IN HERE? MUCH BETTER NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE.
LEADMALE:WHY, THANK YOU, ED.
LEADFEMALE:CAN I GET ANYBODY A DRINK? NOT ME, HONEY, I'VE GOT TO START WATCHING THIS FIGURE.
LEADMALE:I'LL TAKE ONE, HONEY.
SUPFEMALE:HOW ABOUT ANOTHER BOURBON, NEAT? VODKA ROCKS WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED.
LEADFEMALE:GOOD ENOUGH.
SUPMALE:YOU NEED A HAND, CRYSTAL? SHE'S GOT ONE.
OTHERMALE:I REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS JUST A SKINNY LITTLE KID.
SUPFEMALE:SHE'S FILLED OUT NICE THOUGH, HUH, DANNY? DID I MEET HER HUSBAND? SHE'S DIVORCED.
OTHERFEMALE:TWICE, THEN WIDOWED.
SUPFEMALE:YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK A MAN WAS MEANT TO BE MARRIED TO THE SAME WOMAN ALL OF HIS LIFE.
SUPFEMALE:BUT I'M NOT A MAN.
OTHERFEMALE:I'M A ROBOT.
SUPMALE:DAN! ONE SECOND.
LEADFEMALE:HONEY, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
LEADMALE:I GUARANTEE IT, THE MINUTE I GET UP, THERE'S GOING TO BE A 90-YARD TOUCHDOWN RUN.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT DO YOU WANT? UH, IS IT OK IF MY DAD CARVES THE TURKEY THIS YEAR? GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, AL.
OTHERMALE:NO.
LEADFEMALE:NO, IT'S NOT OK.

OTHERMALE:THAT'S JUST STUPID.
LEADMALE:BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, IT'S OUR HOUSE.

SUPMALE:I'M JUST SAYING-BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU'RE SAYING IT.
LEADMALE:I WANNA KNOW WHY YOU'RE SITTING HERE-SHE'S TALKING TO ME ABOUT KIM GREENE! ROSE, WHY IS SHE LOSING HER TEMPER? I DON'T KNOW, MOM, MAYBE YOU'RE DRIVING HER NUTS.
LEADFEMALE:I JUST WANT TO KNOW, WHAT'S THE POINT OF TELLING ME THAT KIM GREENE IS MARRIED WITH THREE KIDS? WHAT'S IT MEAN? IT MEANS THAT SHE'S HAD SEX AT LEAST 3 TIMES SINCE SHE'S BEEN MARRIED.
SUPFEMALE:HE WANTED TO SIT WITH US.
OTHERFEMALE:MAJOR BODY ODOR.
LEADFEMALE:TWICE IF SHE HAD TWINS, OR ONCE IF SHE HAD TRIPLETS.
LEADMALE:ALL, YOU'RE BEING FILTHY! OR IT'S POSSIBLE THEY NEVER HAD SEX AND YOUR MOTHER'S MAKING UP THIS WHOLE THING.
SUPFEMALE:THAT'S WHAT I THINK, DADDY.
LEADFEMALE:WHY ARE YOU READING SO MUCH INTO IT? I JUST TOLD YOU A SIMPLE FACT.
LEADMALE:IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR LIFE LIVING ALONE AND WORKING IN A BAR, FINE.
SUPFEMALE:I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.
LEADFEMALE:I'M NOT WASTING MY LIFE, MOM! I JUST SPENT SIX WEEKS AT THE POLICE TRAINING ACADEMY IN SPRINGFIELD.
LEADFEMALE:SPRINGFIELD? WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN SPRINGFIELD? WHAT'D YOU NEED, TIRES? NO.
OTHERFEMALE:I WAS BECOMING A COP, AND I AM NOW A ROOKIE POLICEWOMAN FOR THE LANFORD POLICE FORCE.
LEADFEMALE:DID YOU HEAR THAT? YEAH, I'VE BEEN HEARING IT MY WHOLE LIFE.
SUPMALE:WHAT DOES SHE MEAN SHE BECAME A POLICEWOMAN? HOW COULD SHE DO SOMETHING SO IMPULSIVE? SO RECKLESS, SO DANGEROUS? SHE COULD GET KILLED OR MAIMED.
SUPMALE:ROSEANNE, DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS? I GUESS SO.
OTHERMALE:THEN WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL ME? I DON'T KNOW, MA.
LEADFEMALE:MAYBE SHE THOUGHT YOU WOULD TAKE IT BAD.
LEADMALE:YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK I EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.
LEADMALE:OH, THAT IS JUST WHAT I LOVE ABOUT OUR FAMILY.
LEADMALE:WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING, SO WE BRING IT UP AT THE DINNER TABLE.

LEADFEMALE:THAT'S WHERE JAY AND I ARE STAYING.
LEADFEMALE:MAYBE WE'LL HAVE BREAKFAST TOGETHER.
