SUPMALE:No, Jackie.
SUPFEMALE:I got a microwave.
LEADMALE:I don't have to start cooking till Dan comes home.
SUPFEMALE:I made a meat loaf in 12 minutes.
SUPMALE:It still tasted like crap, but it was so hot, nobody could tell.
SUPMALE:Mother, talk to d.j. I was just in the bathroom completely naked, and he barges in.
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:You traumatized him.
LEADFEMALE:He'll be gay for sure now.
SUPFEMALE:God, I hate you, Darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, are you listening? Your son is sick.
LEADFEMALE:After seeing you naked, he's probably puking his guts out.
OTHERMALE:You shut your face, or I'll shut it for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Go for it, Barbie! Maybe I will, Ken! I think I heard something.
SUPMALE:What? That's the third time he's walked in on me.
LEADMALE:It was an accident.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:I'll call you later.
SUPFEMALE:The sedative I gave the kids for breakfast is wearing off.
LEADMALE:Look me in the eye and say it was an accident.
LEADMALE:I can tell when you're lying.
LEADFEMALE:It was an accident.
SUPMALE:Could you tell? Jeez.
LEADFEMALE:I have so much to teach you, sprout.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody home? It's me Arnie.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in, Arnie.
SUPMALE:Mother.
LEADFEMALE:I'll talk to him later.
SUPMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:I will.
SUPFEMALE:Just keep your shirt on there.
OTHERMALE:Very funny.
LEADMALE:Is this a bad time, Rosie? It's a bad life, Arnie.
SUPMALE:I'm about to nuke some dinner, though.
OTHERFEMALE:I could go for something to eat.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Well, then go.
OTHERFEMALE:You're always a kidder.
LEADMALE:Not always.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, Nancy's got dinner for me at home.
SUPMALE:We're shacking up.
LEADFEMALE:How romantic.
LEADFEMALE:I got evicted from my place, so it worked out good.
LEADMALE:We can spend a lot more time together.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing like quantity time with the person you love.
SUPFEMALE:But you get tired of always seeing that same face.
SUPMALE:Hey, did I tell you we're getting married? When's she due? You're kidding, right? Yeah, I'm kidding.
LEADMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:The minute I turned my back, you stole my man.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going, buddy? Great.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? Hang on a second.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you tell me Arnie was getting married? He didn't want it to mess up his dating action.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:So many magazines, so little time.
OTHERMALE:I really appreciate this.
LEADMALE:No problem.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have the money back in six, seven weeks tops.
SUPFEMALE:Check ok? You got an ID? Thanks, Rosie.
LEADFEMALE:See you, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:"You got an ID"? How much did you lend him? A couple bucks.
SUPMALE:How much? $1,500.
LEADFEMALE:He's thrown work my way.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you talk to me? It's covered.
LEADFEMALE:I got steady work till Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:I'd never do that without talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:For once in my life I can write out a check to help a friend, no questions asked.
LEADMALE:It's for his engagement ring.
LEADFEMALE:How's this new microwave working out? You know, the one I bought you without asking.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:I should have asked you.
SUPFEMALE:You want me to stick my head in the oven? Kids, dinner.
SUPMALE:We're having butt roast.
SUPMALE:Dad, if d.j. accidentally walks in on me one more time, I'm going to kill him.
SUPMALE:I'll talk to d.j. later.
SUPMALE:You say you'll talk to d.j. , so does mom.
LEADFEMALE:Is anybody going to do anything? Try locking your bathroom door.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Now it's my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Everything wrong in this world is my fault.
LEADFEMALE:You just figured that out? Drop dead.
LEADMALE:You got to talk to d.j. The little pervert walked in on me again.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. , stop peeking at Becky! Ok! There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Mother.
LEADFEMALE:I'll talk to him after I put the groceries away.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hey.
LEADMALE:Becky's in a mood.
LEADMALE:Becky's always in a mood.
SUPFEMALE:What you doing? Putting together some bids.
OTHERFEMALE:My, aren't you ambitious? I thought you were busy through Christmas? Not anymore.
SUPFEMALE:The company went belly-up.
OTHERMALE:We'll never see that 6,000 they owe me.
LEADFEMALE:Why does this always happen to us? We're ok.
LEADMALE:I got some jobs lined up.
LEADMALE:I just have to pay a couple small bills.
LEADFEMALE:Like what kind of small bills? Car payment, mortgage, credit cards.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:Cut it out.
SUPFEMALE:We're ok.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean by ok? You mean "Becky can still go to college" ok, or "oh, boy, the government's giving away free cheese" ok? I know what you're thinking.
LEADMALE:Even if I asked Arnie for the money back, we'd still be short.
LEADFEMALE:By how much? 20 bucks.
LEADMALE:Roseanne I didn't know this was going to happen.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure Arnie won't mind.
LEADMALE:Why don't you tell him to return the money? No way.
OTHERMALE:He probably didn't buy the ring.
LEADMALE:A guy doesn't ask for money back after it's lent.
SUPFEMALE:A guy? What, is this some kind of testosterone thing here? I got it covered, ok? Will you be letting the little woman in on how? I'll just get a swing loan.
LEADFEMALE:Why go to the bank? Because that's where the money is, my pet.
LEADFEMALE:But maybe you should ask your folks or my folks.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't I just borrow it from your folks? Yeah, wait a minute Ugh! The bank's just going to charge you some huge interest.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, I know how to cut a deal.
LEADMALE:I'll just waltz in and act like I don't need the money.
LEADFEMALE:You better act like you got a gun.
LEADMALE:Ah, here it is.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Traffic directional guidance apparatus.
SUPMALE:Or as we on the force like to call them, white gloves.
SUPFEMALE:Without these, I'm just some idiot standing in traffic.
LEADMALE:With those, you're just some Stop.
SUPFEMALE:You see? The power of the glove.
LEADMALE:So, uh Did you get these moves at the police academy? No, the Pips.
LEADMALE:So how'd it go? Smooth.
OTHERMALE:What's going on? How come you're all dressed up? What, this old thing? Come on.
LEADMALE:Jackie, do the words "none of your business" mean anything to you? Go ahead and tell her.
SUPFEMALE:She's family.
LEADFEMALE:I had to negotiate a loan from the bank.
LEADMALE:For what? I wanted to be in debt.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:I came up a little short this month and needed help paying bills.
OTHERMALE:I got cash saved.
OTHERFEMALE:I could loan you some.
OTHERMALE:No, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd lend you money, you'd pay me back.
LEADMALE:It's like a game.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, make it stop.
LEADFEMALE:I say we take her for every cent she's got.
LEADFEMALE:How much you talking about? 1,500.
SUPMALE:Is that all? That's chump change.
SUPMALE:Not that all chumps would have that change.
SUPMALE:It's taken care of.
OTHERFEMALE:How much interest are we paying? What difference does it make? I want to know! There's a loan fee of $150.
LEADFEMALE:The interest rate is 19 1/2 %, ok? You really forced them to their knees there, Ace.
SUPMALE:I'll tell you what, I won't charge you any loan fee or interest.
SUPFEMALE:You just got to, uh Suck up to me for a couple weeks.
LEADMALE:Well, hell, in that case, no.
OTHERFEMALE:How come it's ok to pay this huge interest, but it's not ok to get it from Jackie for nothing? It's good business, dear.
SUPMALE:Ok, forget sucking up.
LEADFEMALE:Just your undying gratitude.
SUPFEMALE:I said no! Don't yell at my sister.
SUPMALE:I just don't want her damn money.
LEADMALE:Dan Just keep your nose out of my business.
LEADFEMALE:Jeez.
SUPFEMALE:Grump.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what got into him.
SUPMALE:The opportunity to kiss your butt doesn't come along every day.
SUPMALE:I was joking.
LEADMALE:I'll apologize.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:Listen, you want to make it up to him? Write him a check.
OTHERFEMALE:He won't take it.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, he will.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me.
SUPMALE:Just make it out to Roseanne Conner.
LEADMALE:Aah! Mom, Darlene hit me! I didn't touch you.
OTHERFEMALE:I barely pushed you.
LEADFEMALE:There's no place like home.
OTHERMALE:There's no place like home.
LEADMALE:There's no place like home.
LEADMALE:No! Mom! Damn.
LEADMALE:She hit me! He was watching me get dressed.
LEADFEMALE:I said to cut that out.
OTHERFEMALE:You said stop peeking at Becky.
LEADFEMALE:He's got me there, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Now the little pervert's peeking at me.
LEADMALE:Why? It was fun for everybody when he peeked at Becky, but now someone may get hurt.
OTHERMALE:d.j. , come here.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, go away.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene called me a prevert.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not a prevert, honey, you're a pervert.
LEADFEMALE:You're just growing up and curious, but you don't like people walking in on you when you're getting undressed.
LEADFEMALE:Neither do your sisters.
SUPMALE:Does daddy see you naked? Yeah, but it's different for married people.
LEADMALE:Married people have to see each other naked.
OTHERMALE:Knock knock.
LEADMALE:Anybody home? Hey, Rosie.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I'll be right with you.
LEADFEMALE:You just need to respect your sisters' privacy more, ok? Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Or else one of them's going to kill you.
LEADFEMALE:Go get ready for bed.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Kid's a peeper, huh? Boy, that takes me back.
LEADFEMALE:What, you got sisters, too? I wish.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:This is kind of a thank you thing.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take it in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't have one already.
LEADMALE:Uh, no, Arnie.
OTHERMALE:I don't have a, uh, wine and soap basket.
SUPMALE:I got it at the car wash.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh Did you get Nancy her little surprise yet? Sure did.
SUPFEMALE:Did she like it? You bet.
OTHERFEMALE:So she's going to keep it? There's no way to return it.
OTHERMALE:What if there was, like, a really, really good reason? It's just a ring.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't buy a ring.
LEADMALE:Then what did you do? I got her one of those breast augmentation deals.
LEADMALE:Huh? You know.
LEADMALE:You got her a boob job? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Two of them.
LEADFEMALE:It's what she wanted.
LEADFEMALE:We gave you $1,500 for that? Actually, I only had half, so I borrowed 1,500 so she didn't walk crooked.
LEADMALE:What do you think? Which one is ours? Hey, Arnie.
SUPMALE:Dan, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Danny.
LEADMALE:Yes? There's a couple things we need to talk about.
LEADMALE:Like what? Oh, like Nancy's engagement present.
SUPFEMALE:Please tell me you got her a camera.
LEADMALE:No, but we did help with the developing.
LEADMALE:You bought her The gift that keeps on giving.
OTHERFEMALE:Neat, huh? I thought you were going to give her a ring? Dan, she's got rings.
SUPMALE:Arn, ha-hang out here.
OTHERFEMALE:Finish your beer.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey, honey I thought it was for a ring.
OTHERMALE:Well, it ain't.
SUPMALE:I think he ought to pay interest.
LEADMALE:That wasn't the deal.
LEADFEMALE:We're paying the bank interest.
OTHERFEMALE:What if he can't? Are we going to repossess? We'll give them to Darlene, so d.j. Has something to look at.
LEADFEMALE:Yep, I'm still here.
LEADMALE:You heard what was said? I missed the part about charging me interest.
LEADFEMALE:If I'd known this would happen, I would've said I got her a ring.
LEADFEMALE:I know that, Arnie.
LEADMALE:It doesn't matter.
LEADMALE:I borrowed the money from Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't tell him.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you want to do that.
LEADFEMALE:It's my house.
LEADFEMALE:I got a right.
OTHERMALE:Absolutely.
OTHERFEMALE:You do.
SUPMALE:You said I was wrong.
LEADMALE:I don't want to get you mad, 'cause I owe you money.
LEADMALE:Shouldn't I give Dan a check? Your check ain't worth squat.
LEADMALE:Everybody knows that, but If you give me Jackie's check, I'll cover it.
LEADMALE:This is just another stupid guy thing, isn't it? If the money's from the bank or me, he's taking care of his family.
LEADFEMALE:If it's from Jackie, she's taking care of his family.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't tell Nancy I borrowed money from Dan.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want her to think these are Dan's boobs.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm the man.
LEADMALE:These are my boobs.
OTHERFEMALE:We're out of beer, honey? I'm going to get some.
LEADMALE:You want to come, Arn? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I got that money.
SUPFEMALE:Arnie.
LEADMALE:You said six weeks.
OTHERMALE:It came sooner than I thought.
LEADFEMALE:Where did he get the money from? I bet on a horse named Lucky Arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Dan Right.
LEADMALE:Lucky Dan, a long shot.
LEADFEMALE:Arnie.
LEADMALE:Lucky Arnie, lucky Dan.
OTHERMALE:Work with me here.
SUPMALE:Why are you friends with him? Ok, I took the money from Jackie myself.
LEADFEMALE:You took the check from your sister? Well, I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Hey, enjoy the soap.
LEADMALE:Give it back, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:It's my family, too.
LEADMALE:I said no.
SUPMALE:And I said I'm taking my sister's check.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Well, what do you think of this? Where the hell is that tape? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:What you up to? Waiting for Gary.
OTHERFEMALE:You? Running away from home.
LEADMALE:Buy you a drink? No.
OTHERMALE:Let me buy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'll have a beer.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Willie, give me a couple beers, please.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Things are good with you and Gary? Yeah, great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You and Roseanne? Well I tore up your check.
LEADFEMALE:What's keeping Gary? I know you were only trying to help.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I had it coming.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:All these years I've been eating your food, using your washing machine, making long distance calls on the That's not important, but I just figured I'd pay you back.
SUPMALE:I appreciate it, Jackie, but I borrowed money from relatives before, and it never works out.
SUPFEMALE:I agree.
LEADMALE:Remember who lent me money for my first car? You're welcome.
SUPMALE:"Don't worry, Jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll find you a nice solid transportation vehicle.
LEADMALE:" "I don't want a nice solid transportation vehicle.
SUPFEMALE:"I want a shiny new piece of crap that looks good and goes vrrroom.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, I did.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I remember back when me and Rosey was getting started.
OTHERMALE:We wanted to buy the house.
LEADFEMALE:I had to borrow money from her folks your folks.
SUPFEMALE:14 years ago, and I still have to pretend I like them.
LEADMALE:Same here.
SUPMALE:So Neither one of us will ever borrow from family again.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:But you'd borrow from a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:I don't think of you just as family.
SUPMALE:I think of you as a friend.
SUPFEMALE:I think of you as family.
SUPFEMALE:It would make me feel so good to help you guys out.
LEADMALE:Eeh.
LEADFEMALE:You're my friend, huh? Absolutely.
LEADMALE:You sure you got this kind of money? All you got to do is ask.
SUPMALE:You got it, pal.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Where you been? Having a drink with a friend.

SUPFEMALE:Are you kidding? She begged me.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Oh.
LEADMALE:Nancy's picture here It's like they follow you.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:It's eerie.
LEADMALE:There was a bunch of these.
SUPFEMALE:We shouldn't leave them laying around.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the other ones? I thought you had them.
LEADFEMALE:What do I need them for, proof of purchase? d.j. ! d.j. !
