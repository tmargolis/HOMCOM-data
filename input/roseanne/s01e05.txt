SUPFEMALE:i just wanna see that lumber first thing tomorrow morning, period.
LEADMALE:period.
SUPFEMALE:vroom, vroom! d.j. , please don't drive your truck on my blueprints.
LEADFEMALE:vroom, vroom! vroom-vroom-vroom-vroom-vroom.
OTHERMALE:i can't believe they shortened me 25 pieces of lumber.
OTHERMALE:may they rot in hell.
OTHERFEMALE:i got the receipt.
LEADFEMALE:i got something that'll cheer you up.
SUPMALE:oh, yeah, you got 25 two-by-fours? yeah, and you know what else i got? this official entry blank for that radio station's country-western songwriting contest.
SUPFEMALE:so? so.
LEADMALE:i ain't entering no contest.
LEADMALE:come on, you should do it.
SUPMALE:it'd be a hoot.
LEADFEMALE:you're the writer in the family.
OTHERMALE:you do it.
LEADMALE:well, i don't got no musical talent.
LEADFEMALE:you're the one with the trunkful of songs out in the garage.
OTHERMALE:honey, i wrote that stuff years ago.
OTHERMALE:you ought to dig one out and just send it in.
LEADFEMALE:huh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:no way.
LEADMALE:come on, you're really good at it.
OTHERMALE:no, no contest for this cowboy.
LEADFEMALE:oh, dan whatwhat could you win? what difference does it make? you're not gonna enter it anyway.
SUPMALE:i'm just curious.
SUPMALE:the first prize is a hundred bucks, plus you get to hear your song played over the radio.
LEADMALE:ah, i ain't got no talent.
LEADMALE:come on, you know you wanna do it.
SUPMALE:it would be kind of nice hearing one of my songs played on the radio.
LEADFEMALE:dan, you can no longer deprive the world of your special talent.
LEADFEMALE:maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:of course i'm right.
LEADFEMALE:you need to cut it loose and set it free.
LEADMALE:do it for humanity.
OTHERFEMALE:bingo.
LEADMALE:what are you doing? getting something to eat.
LEADFEMALE:your break isn't for two minutes.
OTHERMALE:well, then, i'll go back to work two minutes early.
LEADFEMALE:sit down, harris.
LEADMALE:sit down.
LEADFEMALE:you know, you have an attitude problem.
SUPFEMALE:i do? oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:and i was thinking that we should, uh, work on it someplace outside of the workplace.
LEADFEMALE:where would you suggest, the back seat of your car? no.
LEADMALE:no.
OTHERMALE:i was thinking more along the lines of my apartment.
LEADFEMALE:there is no way that i'm gonna end up a notch on your bedpost.
SUPFEMALE:i'm not coming on to you.
OTHERMALE:you think i'm coming on to you? it crossed my mind.
LEADMALE:no.
LEADFEMALE:no, no.
LEADMALE:see, i'mi'm just trying to improve employee-management relations.
LEADFEMALE:nice save, booker.
LEADFEMALE:thank you.
LEADFEMALE:what's that? looks like a phone number.
LEADFEMALE:let's work on that attitude.
LEADMALE:roseanne, what kind of song is dan gonna enter? he hadn't even decided yet.
LEADFEMALE:i bet it'll be romantic.
LEADMALE:can't go wrong with a love song.
LEADFEMALE:ah, love songs are hokey.
LEADFEMALE:i like something i can dance to.
LEADFEMALE:get down, sylvia.
SUPMALE:it's a country-western station, right? rOSEANNE: yeah.
LEADMALE:then the song doesn't matter.
SUPFEMALE:all that counts is the title.
LEADFEMALE:sis, i guess you're an expert on that, too, huh? that happens to be true.
SUPFEMALE:look at the classic "take this job and shove it.
SUPFEMALE:" aLL: yeah.
SUPFEMALE:jACKIE: it's just the title.
LEADFEMALE:you know what dan should really try to write? a road song.
LEADFEMALE:gosh, you're right.
OTHERMALE:i love road songs.
LEADFEMALE:when that whiskey-voice guy starts singing about highways and byways.
LEADFEMALE:what exactly is the difference between a highway and a byway? a highway is the main road, right? and the byway is the road that runs right along by it.
LEADMALE:no.
LEADFEMALE:no, that's an access road.
LEADMALE:a byway is a road that goes around something.
SUPMALE:no, that's a bypass.
LEADMALE:there is no difference between a highway and a byway.
LEADMALE:okay? i'm so glad you figured that out.
OTHERMALE:maybe we can all get some sleep tonight.
LEADMALE:i'll tell you what people can't get enough of hardship songs.
LEADFEMALE:you're right.
LEADMALE:there's nothing like a hardship song that set my toes to tappin'.
LEADMALE:well, that's what all the best songs are about.
SUPFEMALE:pain, misery.
SUPMALE:you know, real life.
OTHERMALE:my life.
SUPMALE:my parents kicked me out of the house when i was 16.
LEADFEMALE:moved in with crazy aunt ina and a houseful of cats.
OTHERMALE:married at 17, widowed at 18.
OTHERFEMALE:tornado carried away my car.
LEADMALE:hospitalized for pneumonia.
LEADMALE:everybody sing.
LEADFEMALE:mom.
LEADFEMALE:the one and only.
LEADMALE:where's dad? he's out in the garage, honey, struggling with the muses.
LEADFEMALE:i need him to fix my truck.
LEADFEMALE:what happened to it? the wheel fell off.
LEADMALE:give it to me.
LEADMALE:you don't know how to fix trucks.
LEADMALE:i know how to do anything.
SUPFEMALE:i'm a mom.
OTHERFEMALE:dads are supposed to fix trucks.
LEADMALE:give me that.

LEADFEMALE:yeah, never.
LEADMALE:never.
LEADFEMALE:you know what else? what? they're always in the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:they're horrible, rotten girls.
SUPFEMALE:what are we gonna do with them? kill 'em.
LEADMALE:nah, then i'd just have to clean up the mess.
SUPMALE:i guess we're gonna have to live with them until they move out.
SUPMALE:yeah.
LEADFEMALE:well, here you go.
LEADMALE:one fixed truck.
LEADMALE:thanks.
SUPMALE:vroom! bECKY: just shut up, darlene.

SUPFEMALE:you used to be almost normal.
SUPMALE:yeah, until you were born.
SUPFEMALE:knock it off.
OTHERFEMALE:i wish mom and dad had left you at that hospital.
SUPMALE:shut up, becky.
LEADMALE:mom! she's not here! mother, i can't spend another minute in the same room with her.
SUPFEMALE:and whom, pray tell, are we talking about? mother, please, you know who i'm talking about.
SUPFEMALE:the pig.
LEADMALE:here's your filthy, disgusting pillow.
OTHERMALE:all you two have been doing this whole week is fighting, and i really want it to stop now.
LEADFEMALE:then talk to darlene.
LEADFEMALE:she leaves all her grungy stuff all over my side of the room.
LEADFEMALE:what? i can't leave anything anywhere without her going into convulsions.
LEADMALE:there's only one way to solve this problem.
LEADMALE:give me that pillow.
LEADMALE:and give me that blanket, too.
SUPMALE:now, turn around and face each other here.
LEADFEMALE:now, i want you two to fight to the death.
SUPFEMALE:mother.
SUPMALE:go on, start ripping each other apart, limb from limb.
LEADMALE:and whoever's left standing gets to keep the room.
LEADFEMALE:you know what she's trying to do.
SUPMALE:well, i do have another plan.
SUPMALE:i hate it when she does this.
SUPMALE:go get the masking tape"put a line down the center of the room.
LEADFEMALE:" "and stay on your side.

LEADFEMALE:i tried a few things, but, uh i don't know, i guess i just wasn't inspired.
OTHERMALE:well, i'm here now.
SUPMALE:and yet somehow i'm still not inspired.
SUPMALE:well, if you're not gonna write no songs, why don't you dig out some of these to send in.
OTHERMALE:i already looked.
SUPMALE:there's nothing in there worth sending.
LEADFEMALE:don't give me that.
LEADFEMALE:there's bound to be an undiscovered masterpiece in here.
OTHERMALE:trust me, they all suck mud.
SUPMALE:face it, i'm a small-time contractor.
OTHERFEMALE:i ain't no big-time composer.
SUPFEMALE:well, this is no big-time contest.
LEADFEMALE:what is this? what? give it to me.
