LEADMALE:Is it a boy or a girl? Wait for the ring to start moving.
LEADMALE:Side to side's a boy.
LEADMALE:Up and down's a girl.
SUPMALE:I don't want to know.
LEADMALE:Well, then don't look.
SUPFEMALE:Well, only tell me if it's a girl.
OTHERMALE:Side to side.
SUPMALE:It's a boy.
SUPMALE:Oh, I wanted a girl.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you should have laid the other way.
LEADFEMALE:This is stupid.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's do it the scientific way.
LEADMALE:Let me look at your butt.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? It's a scientific fact.
LEADFEMALE:If it's a flat pancake butt, it's a girl, and if it's a bubble butt, it's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:I am not going to show you my butt.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Just do it.
LEADMALE:God, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Get a life.
OTHERFEMALE:We're just trying to figure out the sex of Crystal's baby.
LEADMALE:Who cares? It's just going to be another screaming, whining, bratty, little life-sucking poop machine.
LEADFEMALE:You still want her to babysit? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What are we going to name this baby? Well, we have a tradition in our family.
SUPFEMALE:My grandmother was Ruby, and my mother was Amber, and I'm Crystal, so I was thinking that this must stop.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't give it some dorky name like Becky.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with your dorky name? It's like a chicken noise.
SUPFEMALE:It's like Becky, Beck-Beck-Becky.
LEADMALE:You're lucky.
LEADMALE:It was the seventies.
LEADFEMALE:You could have been named Frampton or Chablis.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I got to go.
LEADMALE:Help me.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Mom, look.
OTHERMALE:I ate my pop-tart into the shape of a gun.
SUPFEMALE:Boom, boom.
OTHERFEMALE:I definitely want a girl.
LEADFEMALE:You better tell that to your butt.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, Lamaze class tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:I'll be there.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:You're her Lamaze coach? What happened to ed? I'm just a backup in case the baby comes early or Ed's out of town.
SUPFEMALE:I'll deliver my baby in a pool of warm water.
SUPMALE:That's the gentlest way to deliver a baby.
OTHERMALE:And I imagine it keeps the swimmers out of the shallow end.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you.
LEADMALE:You got hurt.
LEADFEMALE:You should sue.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm fine, Arnie.
OTHERMALE:You're lucky you're alive.
LEADFEMALE:What happened, Dan? Are you ok? Nothing.
SUPMALE:No, it's ok.
LEADMALE:I had a little accident at the job site.
SUPFEMALE:You were almost killed.
LEADFEMALE:It was great.
LEADMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:I got in the way of a wrecking ball.
SUPFEMALE:That's so lame.
SUPFEMALE:Tell them the good part.
OTHERMALE:Ok, I'll tell them.
LEADFEMALE:So Dan is sitting in the Porto-Johnny minding his own business, and the wrecking ball comes in, and bam! Knocked that sucker 17 feet.
LEADMALE:I measured it.
LEADMALE:Did you see a doctor? It's just a couple bruises.
LEADMALE:It could be like a concussion.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a hard head.
LEADFEMALE:Does it hurt, dad? Get away from there.
LEADMALE:I'm more embarrassed than anything else.
LEADFEMALE:I crawled out with my pants around my ankles and there's 30 people standing staring at me.
LEADFEMALE:It was really an awkward moment.
LEADFEMALE:Fortunately I had the presence of mind to start the applause.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you owe us money? I got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What are you eating? Salami and peppers.
LEADMALE:One brush with death a day isn't enough for you? I live on the edge.
LEADMALE:You want a bite? Wuss.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing up? I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd go over some bills.
LEADMALE:Maybe what happened today's keeping you awake.
LEADMALE:Nah.
LEADFEMALE:You weren't like worried something more serious could happen? Nope.
LEADMALE:So that's our will there, huh? Ok, I was curious about what might happen to my wife and family if I hadn't been so lucky.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:It's the middle of the night.
LEADMALE:Honey, I think we should talk about this.
LEADFEMALE:What would happen if we went at the same time, like in a plane crash? We never go anywhere, Dan.
LEADMALE:A plane would actually have to crash into the sofa.
LEADMALE:We haven't changed this will in 16 years.
OTHERMALE:Darlene and d.j. Aren't in here.
LEADMALE:We left Becky to Ziggy.
SUPFEMALE:He was the most responsible person we knew at the time.
SUPFEMALE:He had his own Texaco card.
OTHERMALE:What were we thinking? We were thinking anybody but our parents.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Let's go to bed now.
SUPMALE:How can you go to sleep knowing the kids aren't taken care of? Like they're taken care of when we're awake? Come on, Dan.
OTHERMALE:I'm tired.
OTHERMALE:I really think we should deal with this.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:We'll decide who gets the kids.
SUPFEMALE:Now Who do we really hate? Who did we get up to? Do you still want to be cremated? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Not right now.
LEADFEMALE:You know, 'cause it is pretty complicated.
LEADFEMALE:First I got to find the urn, then I got to find the matches.
OTHERFEMALE:I was hoping you'd die on a Thursday when it's trash day.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try to expire near the curb, dear.
SUPFEMALE:You know, when I die, I don't want one of these funerals where everybody cries.
SUPMALE:I want you to throw a great big party.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we will, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, girls.
SUPFEMALE:So, which of us inherits this dump? What, were you eavesdropping? Well, you've been yakking about it all night.
SUPFEMALE:And face it, Mom, you've got a voice that can bend steel.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, we decided that when we die we're dividing everything between the three of you.
LEADFEMALE:I just want the cash.
LEADFEMALE:It has sentimental value.
LEADFEMALE:Don't drink out of the milk carton.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing up so early? I started jogging again.
LEADMALE:I ran all the way over here.
LEADMALE:Good for you.
LEADMALE:I'm just going to rest here for a second, and then you can drive me back home.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to work.
LEADFEMALE:You want a lift? No.
SUPMALE:I'm going to get breakfast first.
OTHERMALE:It is the most important mooch of the day.
LEADMALE:You be careful.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
OTHERMALE:You got any oat bran or shredded wheat or Oh, cocoa puffs.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm out of here, too.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Don't die.
LEADMALE:I'll do my best.
SUPFEMALE:What's that? Your will? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:We were up all night figuring out who gets the kids if we die.
SUPMALE:That's got to be fun.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:You're off the hook.
OTHERFEMALE:d.j. took my keys and locked himself in my truck.
LEADMALE:Can I use yours? They're in my purse.
LEADFEMALE:Why did he do that? He doesn't want me going to work.
LEADMALE:"I'll be killed.
SUPMALE:" Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll talk to him.
LEADMALE:He'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:What did that mean, I'm off the hook? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We decided we'll leave the kids with Crystal and Ed.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't I get the kids? You get the washer and dryer.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't want to separate them.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm serious.
SUPMALE:I'm closer to those kids than anybody.
SUPMALE:I know, but you're a single woman.
LEADFEMALE:Well, a lot of single women raise families.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know, but they do it from the time that they're babies.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, I have been there since day one.
SUPMALE:Since they were babies.
LEADFEMALE:You're trying to tell me I couldn't do it.
SUPMALE:No, we just didn't want to burden you.
OTHERFEMALE:Which is a really nice way of saying you don't trust me.
SUPMALE:Hey, you'll thank me when I'm dead.
OTHERFEMALE:Jack.
LEADFEMALE:King.
LEADMALE:You win.
SUPMALE:Let's play again.
LEADMALE:Don't you have homework to do or something? I want to stay with you.
LEADMALE:Ok.
SUPMALE:You getting hungry? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I ought to get dinner started.
LEADFEMALE:Becky! War! War! Yeah, dad? You know where mom put that casserole? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:It's in the refrigerator.
SUPMALE:I looked.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't find it in there.
SUPMALE:Geez, it's right here.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'll put it in the microwave.
SUPMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Hey, um Could you hand me the aluminum foil? What for? You're supposed to keep it covered, aren't you? Dad, you can't put metal in the microwave.
SUPMALE:I was just going to use a little.
SUPFEMALE:Just forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, honey.
SUPFEMALE:What are you guys doing? Getting ready to set the table.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know where mom keeps the forks? I'm not dumb enough to fall for that stupid move.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't call him stupid.
LEADMALE:I didn't.
LEADMALE:Yes, you did.
OTHERMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:You shut up, Darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, whoa.
SUPMALE:Hold on, killer.
OTHERMALE:Deej, why don't you get washed up for dinner? Ok, dad.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? Since I got home, he won't let me out of his sight.
SUPMALE:Dad, he's crazy.
LEADFEMALE:He's showing concern, which is more than I can say for others considering what happened to me yesterday.
SUPMALE:You were sitting in a Porto-crapper that got nailed by a wrecking ball.
SUPMALE:I didn't take one shot.
OTHERMALE:Now, that is love.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, right.
OTHERMALE:Suck up for the inheritance.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, in through the nose, abdomen, chest, shoulders.
LEADMALE:Fill up with air.
SUPMALE:Exhale.
LEADFEMALE:Think of letting go.
SUPFEMALE:Keep the breathing moving.
LEADFEMALE:Coaches, help mom relax.
SUPMALE:So anyways, Jackie gets all bent out of shape, like trying to make me feel all guilty.
LEADFEMALE:She can't take care of three kids, you know? Have you ever seen her fridge? She's got one egg and a can of Margarita mix.
OTHERFEMALE:Coaches, a little word of encouragement for mom.
LEADFEMALE:Atta girl, Crystal.
SUPMALE:Ok, let's take a little time out here.
LEADMALE:I'm sure you've been thinking of questions since the last class.
SUPMALE:Anybody? This is my first baby.
OTHERMALE:I was wondering how long it takes to push it out? 18 years.
SUPFEMALE:I take it you've got kids? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Two or three.
LEADFEMALE:Did you use natural childbirth? Well Kind of, but actually there's a story that goes along with this.
SUPFEMALE:Get off me, Crystal.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:You're not going to scare them, are you? We'll see what I say.
OTHERMALE:Ok, now, my first kid, they just knocked me out, so I didn't feel anything.
LEADFEMALE:Then they hand me the baby.
LEADFEMALE:She's 16 now Blonde and thin.
LEADMALE:I don't think she's mine.
LEADMALE:But, uh Anyway, then when I had my third kid, I hadn't lost any weight from my second kid or from my first kid, so they were trying to give me this local deal and everything, but I kept feeling pain, so I keep on begging for more drugs until finally the doctor comes over and goes, "I'm sorry, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, "but if we give you any more drugs, it's going to kill your baby.
LEADFEMALE:" So I thought about it for a while and, uh Then I said, "ok.
LEADFEMALE:No drugs, but just hit me with a sledgehammer.
SUPFEMALE:" Of course he wouldn't, so I ended up feeling the whole thing.
SUPMALE:Was your husband there? Yeah.
SUPMALE:He had taken the classes, so they had to let him in.
SUPFEMALE:But all in all, I'm glad he was there.
LEADMALE:This is all your idea.
OTHERMALE:I hate you! Let go! Oh, god.
OTHERFEMALE:It hurts.
LEADFEMALE:Breathe.
OTHERFEMALE:It helped before, but it's not helping now.
SUPFEMALE:You're not doing it.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, breathe.
SUPFEMALE:How's she doing? Contractions are a minute apart.
OTHERMALE:And she's at 8 centimeters.
LEADMALE:8 centimeters.
LEADMALE:You hear that, Roseanne? Way to dilate.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, god, you're such an idiot.
LEADMALE:Your mouth dry, Rosie? You want a Tab? Get her out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Jackie, why don't you go get some ice? Ok.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I'm being so mean to you, Dan.
SUPMALE:You're not, honey.
SUPFEMALE:You're being mean to Jackie.
SUPMALE:That's why I brought her.
LEADMALE:I can't stand it.
LEADFEMALE:I got to push.
LEADFEMALE:Not till the doctor gets here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, come on, blow.
LEADMALE:Ok, ok, it passed.
LEADMALE:You're pushing.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm not.
LEADMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADFEMALE:If you're not going to do this right, let's forget it.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:We'll just go home.
LEADFEMALE:God, you're such a moron.
LEADMALE:Oh, god.
LEADMALE:This is horrible.
LEADMALE:What's happening to me? Either you're having a baby, or you ate the hospital food.
LEADMALE:Oh, god, no.
OTHERMALE:Not a funny doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Just a little more now, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Get this thing out of me! Ok, we got a head.
SUPFEMALE:Just one, right? Keep pushing, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:I can't! I can't! I can't do anymore.
OTHERMALE:Yes, you can.
SUPFEMALE:Just one more good hard push.
SUPMALE:Oh, Jackie, mom was right.
LEADMALE:Sex is baaad! Ooh! What is it? What is it? Five.
LEADMALE:Five.
OTHERFEMALE:Five.
OTHERFEMALE:Five.
SUPMALE:One.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! It's a boy! You did it! Let me see him.
OTHERMALE:Let me see him.
SUPFEMALE:They're cleaning him off right now.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Jackie, I'm so glad you were here.
OTHERMALE:I apologize for being mean.
SUPMALE:No, that's all right.
LEADMALE:This is so great.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here at the beginning of a new life.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why you've got to be the godmother.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:The same thing you said when I asked you to be the girls' godmother.
SUPMALE:Oh, ok.
SUPFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, men, men, the starting quarterback for the Chicago Bears, Dan Conner's boy-oy-oy.
SUPFEMALE:Just give me the baby.
LEADMALE:Ooh He's beautiful, Dan.
LEADMALE:Just like you, honey.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello there, little baby.
LEADMALE:You tried to kill me, didn't you? Oh, look at him, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:He's smiling.
SUPMALE:I'm up.
SUPFEMALE:It's late.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't sleep.
SUPMALE:Why not? I'm thinking too much.
OTHERMALE:Buddy I've already told you.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to worry about me dying, 'cause I'm not going to.
SUPMALE:You almost did.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not planning on dying for a long time, ok? Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Go to sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:But you could.
SUPMALE:Deej, if you spend all your time worrying about dying, living isn't going to be much fun, is it? Well, how do I stop worrying? Well, I try to think about good stuff, like watching you grow up, teaching you how to drive a car, meeting the girl you're going to marry.
SUPMALE:I don't like girls.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you do.
OTHERFEMALE:See? I still got a lot of stuff to teach you.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Dad? When's Darlene going to die? Good night, d.j. See you in the morning.
SUPMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How was baby class? You know.
LEADMALE:Same as always.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I was thinking about this guardian stuff, and I was thinking maybe we should leave the kids with Jackie after all.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, we've been through this.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but she's part of their lives, Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:She knows when Becky's lying.
LEADFEMALE:She knows when Darlene's sucking up to get money, and she understands all of d.j. 's weird little chatter.
SUPMALE:Are you feeling a little guilty? Yeah, I guess so.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you? Yeah, I guess.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:She wants them, she can have them.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Ok.
OTHERFEMALE:You go wake them up, and I'll drive them over there.
SUPMALE:Let's go to bed.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You know, Dan, you need to get more life insurance.
SUPMALE:We got enough.
OTHERMALE:No, we don't.
SUPMALE:If you ever die, I want to grieve in Tahiti.
LEADFEMALE:Me and Dan are dead.
SUPFEMALE:You've moved into the house.
LEADMALE:You're in charge of the kids.
LEADFEMALE:Now, question number one.
LEADFEMALE:It's Saturday night, 2 A.
LEADFEMALE:M.
LEADMALE:, and Becky's not home from her date yet.
LEADMALE:What do you do? Ok.
LEADMALE:Um Am I home from my date yet? Where am I? You don't have a date, Jackie.
LEADMALE:You have three kids.
LEADFEMALE:You will never have a date or life.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:No date, no life.
SUPFEMALE:I forgot.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, I would call up all of Becky's friends.
LEADMALE:Wrong.
OTHERMALE:This is that 911 question, isn't it? Wrong.
SUPMALE:Ok, what? I don't know.
SUPMALE:You go to Darlene's room and threaten Darlene's life Threaten Darlene's life.
SUPMALE:I should have known that.
OTHERMALE:I should have had that one.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, question number two.
LEADFEMALE:d.j. 's found a dead cat and insists on keeping it as a pet.
SUPMALE:What do you do? I would very gently explain to him that the cat had gone through his nine lives and we would have a simple funeral.
LEADFEMALE:God, Jackie.
SUPMALE:Are you even going to try or what? All right.
LEADMALE:Ok.
OTHERMALE:Dead cat.
OTHERFEMALE:Dead cat.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I truly don't know what I'd do.
LEADMALE:Neither did I.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Next question.
SUPFEMALE:Becky and Darlene have been fighting for two weeks.
LEADMALE:So? Right.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, next question.
LEADMALE:You're so exhausted from taking care of three kids and a house that you're not in the mood for sex for three whole months.
SUPFEMALE:What do you do? Maybe you ought to give the kids to Crystal and Ed.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's too late now.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:You wanted it.
SUPMALE:You begged me.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:You made your bed.
SUPFEMALE:
