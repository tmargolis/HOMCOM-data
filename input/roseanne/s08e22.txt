OTHERMALE:Man, there's just so much to do to prepare for this wedding.
LEADMALE:We still have to get flowers, Hors d'oeuvres, a church.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe you should ask Darlene to do some of it If you weren't so damn whipped.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think the first order of business-Mom, you're only allowed one suggestion per hour.
LEADFEMALE:And your last one counted as two, because it went on for too long.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, some guy just delivered this for you.
SUPMALE:Well, I didn't order that.
SUPFEMALE:Did you give him any money? no.
LEADMALE:oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, put it down there.
LEADMALE:Saw your commentary on tv About how hard it is to find a descent wedding cake.
OTHERFEMALE:Sincerely, albano's bakery, third and main.
LEADFEMALE:feel free to mention us on your show.
LEADFEMALE:Man, that's just out-and-out bribery.
LEADMALE:It's totally unethical and chocolaty.
OTHERFEMALE:That cake won't last until the wedding.
LEADFEMALE:That cake won't last till dinner.
LEADMALE:So just because you mentioned wedding cakes on television Someone sent you a free one? Yeah, and they say tv only adds 10 lbs.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, I can see my next commentary Appearing before my eyes-I was wrong about bakeries.
OTHERFEMALE:Albano's on third and main is a great one.
LEADMALE:And I wonder where I can get a descent wedding dress Or hors d'oeuvres, Or a candy-apple red pump In a size 7 1/2 with a low heel.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:My divorce is final-Signed, sealed, delivered.
LEADMALE:I'm alone, Legally forever single till death do I part.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jackie, a guy in a long robe Carrying a big sickle was by here looking for you.
LEADMALE:Go ahead and joke.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not the one facing a life of solitude, Or uneven mattress wear.
OTHERFEMALE:Come one, Jackie.
OTHERMALE:You'll find someone.
LEADMALE:Who wouldn't want to go out with you? That's easy for you to say, you little frizzy-haired pollyanna.
LEADFEMALE:You talk to me after a year of marriage, After you've taken up smoking Just to shave a couple of years off your miserable life.
SUPMALE:I got to go Work on this seating chart now.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, make sure you put me between the priest and the florist.
SUPFEMALE:Hey hey, don't count out that priest.
LEADFEMALE:times have changed.
LEADMALE:Jackie, I have just the tonic.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come with me Saturday night To my ballroom dance class? Why didn't I think of that? Mom, that's a great idea.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure that the man of my dreams is sitting at home right now Clipping on his bow tie and strapping on his truss.
LEADFEMALE:It's not just for seniors.
LEADFEMALE:There's plenty of cultured And delightful gentlemen of all ages there.
OTHERFEMALE:I may be desperate, But I haven't sunk that low.
LEADFEMALE:Oh really? Hey, I cannot believe that I am agreeing with mom here.
LEADFEMALE:You really should go.
LEADMALE:I was reading this big article About how ballroom dancing is making a big old comeback.
LEADFEMALE:So you really don't think it would be a huge waste of time? No more than your marriage.
SUPFEMALE:All right, i'll go.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna feel really stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, goody! And i'll help you pick out an outfit.
OTHERFEMALE:Plus perhaps we can tease that hair Into something presentable.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you try to tease it into a nice set of boobs? Roseanne, you might like to come along too.
SUPMALE:Dance is good exercise.
SUPMALE:Hey, I am not divorced, Single, desperate, or lonely.
OTHERMALE:What the hell do I need to exercise for? hey.
SUPMALE:hey.
SUPMALE:Mark, what happened to your hand? He was working the saw and he almost cut it off again.
LEADMALE:Mark, what an idiot.
LEADMALE:What do you mean an idiot? Didn't you hear him? Almost.
LEADMALE:Unbelievable.
LEADMALE:Shouldn't you be sewing up your wedding dress, mary? Is he the dumbest guy you've ever known? I work at a construction business, David.
OTHERMALE:I would have to see a list.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, do you know anything about wedding tuxes? I mean, do you have to wear underwear, Or are they built into the pants like in bathing suits? Oh, David, I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I don't feel like talking about wedding stuff right now.
OTHERFEMALE:You're still kind of angry About this whole pregnancy-wedding thing aren't you? I am making great strides In my acceptance of this difficult situation.
LEADMALE:Well good, Because I really think you're the greatest guy in the world, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner, And I want you to be my best man.
SUPMALE:Oh, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I know it's weird.
OTHERMALE:So don't answer now.
OTHERFEMALE:Just think about it, all right? Yeah, i'll get back to you.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna love me again one day, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
LEADFEMALE:You'll see.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get back to you about that too.

OTHERFEMALE:Mark? I don't like Mark.
LEADMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:We just don't get along.
LEADMALE:Aren't you supposed to pick a best man you like and get along with? That's not even true about the person you marry.

LEADFEMALE:You know, my first memory Is of you stuffing me in a piano when I was three years old.
LEADFEMALE:You stole my allowance.
LEADFEMALE:You bent the spokes on my bike.
LEADFEMALE:You told every girl I had a crush on that I had fleas.
OTHERMALE:You did.
SUPFEMALE:That one summer.
LEADMALE:Face it, Mark, You viciously bullied me Until I was old enough to figure out how to just avoid you all together, Which is why we are the way we are today.
OTHERMALE:And you wonder why I don't ask you to be my best man? Yeah, why not? I just told you, Mark.
LEADMALE:It doesn't matter.
SUPMALE:I don't wanna be your best man anyway.
LEADMALE:fine, then just say no.
SUPFEMALE:oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Oh, you're driving me crazy! Mark, come here.
OTHERMALE:Just say you'll be my best man and shut up! Look at this! You can't even ask me nicely! All right, fine, Mark.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be my best man, all right? Just kill me and put me out of my misery.
LEADMALE:Look, if you're that miserable, I'll be your best man.
OTHERMALE:will that make you happy? yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's good.
SUPFEMALE:It's a good start.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I mean, we are brothers.
