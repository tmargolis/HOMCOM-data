LEADMALE:Did your mom throw him out? Of course.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't have the strength To drive some ice pick through his skull And drag his lifeless body to some shallow grave.
SUPMALE:Sounds like you've thought this through.
LEADFEMALE:I like to think ahead.
SUPMALE:How come the kids ain't eating with us? Becky's still at work, d.j. 's eating at Todd's, And Darlene's in her room sacrificing a chicken or whatever.

LEADFEMALE:I got an overnight haul to Topeka.
SUPFEMALE:I was going to stop through Kansas City And check out dad's mistress.
LEADMALE:What am I thinking, huh? I don't believe you.
SUPMALE:He told me her name.
SUPMALE:I looked it up in information and got her address.
SUPFEMALE:It's totally insane.
LEADFEMALE:Are you coming? Why would I want to do that? Dad's been having an affair with her for 20 years.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to see what she looks like.
SUPFEMALE:What would we even say to this woman? We can figure that out on the way down there.
LEADFEMALE:No way! O.

SUPMALE:Everything is just so black and white to you.
LEADMALE:Did you consider that mom drove him to it? She drove him crazy.
SUPFEMALE:She made him nuts.
LEADFEMALE:She drove me crazy, too, but I didn't have another mom stashed on the side.
OTHERFEMALE:What will we say to this Joan woman? We'll ask what kind of woman would steal a man away from his happy family.
LEADFEMALE:Where were you living? We were never happy.
LEADMALE:Maybe we would have been if she'd left dad alone.
SUPMALE:Now you're being unfair, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:What woman could rightly turn down a patio furniture salesman who cleaned out his ears with his car keys? You just don't get it, do you? Yeah, I do get it.
OTHERMALE:First it's mom's fault, then it's this woman's fault.
LEADFEMALE:When is it going to be dad's fault, Jackie? There's a word for this, and it's called denial.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to talk about it, o.

LEADMALE:I know, I know.
LEADMALE:Every car that passed us you beat the crap out of me.
SUPFEMALE:in a station wagon.
SUPMALE:Just so dad could see cannonballs in a pile.
OTHERMALE:Mom said there would be rides.
SUPMALE:They were such liars.
LEADFEMALE:The trip back was good, though.
SUPFEMALE:We were making all that noise until dad screamed, "Not another word!" Then we started making all those animal noises.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's yelling at us, mom's yelling at us, and the whole time neither one of them said a word to each other.
LEADFEMALE:They never said a word to each other unless it was about us kids fighting or getting in trouble.
SUPMALE:Which we did a lot.
