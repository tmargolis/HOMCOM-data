SUPMALE:We're fighting.
LEADMALE:What about? Well, he's a pig.
LEADFEMALE:The whole world revolves around him.

LEADFEMALE:Don't toy with me, Becky.
OTHERFEMALE:Finally.
SUPMALE:Hey, look.
LEADFEMALE:It's a little baby bike.
LEADMALE:Get off it, honey.
SUPMALE:You'll kill it.

LEADMALE:Well, I'll take it.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Out of the question.
OTHERMALE:Why not? Don't think you can't handle it.
LEADMALE:You don't know that till you give me a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, I gotta go deal with a customer.
SUPMALE:The answer's no.
SUPFEMALE:Mom.
SUPFEMALE:He said no.
LEADMALE:Mom, dad sells motorcycles.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, he must think that-Can I help you? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I was thinking about getting one of these.

SUPMALE:I like that one.
LEADFEMALE:'73 Norton.
LEADFEMALE:Good choice.

LEADFEMALE:Sit on it.
OTHERMALE:Feel it.

SUPMALE:I'm working now, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, you get back in here! This is great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Roseanne: I said no! Becky: give me one good reason.
LEADFEMALE:Because bikes kill! Ok, Becky? I mean, just ask your aunt Jackie.
LEADMALE:When she was a cop, she used to scrape kids Like you off the street all the time.
LEADFEMALE:And don't think a helmet's gonna help.
SUPFEMALE:All's that does is catch your brains After they fall out of your skull.
SUPFEMALE:Don't forget to tell your friends about us.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha ha ha ha ha! Hi.
LEADMALE:We're unable to get to the phone right now, So leave a message, and we'll get back to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Beep.
LEADMALE:Dan: what happened to, "bikes are dangerous"? Roseanne: I used to think that Till you said what you said.
LEADMALE:What did I say? "No daughter of mine is going to ride a bike.
SUPFEMALE:" That is what you said, Dan.
LEADMALE:"No daughter of mine's going to ride a bike.
SUPMALE:" You know, like it's ok for a boy, but not for a girl.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I meant, Becky's my daughter, And no daughter of mine, such as Becky, Is going to ride a motorcycle.
OTHERMALE:Oh, bull.
OTHERFEMALE:It's true.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, if d.j. Was 17 and he wanted a bike, Would you let him have one? You really want Becky risking her life on a motorcycle? Well, if the only reason you're saying no Is because she's a girl, then yes.
SUPFEMALE:What? I'm getting a motorcycle.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Mom and dad are gonna let you have a bike? It's not a matter of letting me have it, Darlene.
LEADMALE:It's a matter of women being exploited by men for centuries.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe you, Dan.
LEADMALE:You're still, like, living in the fifties.
OTHERMALE:Go on.
SUPFEMALE:Risk your child's life just to spite me.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need your permission.
LEADMALE:Mom, I'm really sorry you had to have that fight with dad.
LEADMALE:It's ok.
SUPFEMALE:I won.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I shouldn't pick up the scooter for a couple days, Huh? You know, let dad get used to the idea.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not getting any bike.
LEADMALE:Well, you were just saying-Forget what I said.
OTHERFEMALE:They're dangerous.
LEADMALE:Oh, for a girl, is that it? If d.j. Was 17 and he wanted a bike, you'd let him.
LEADMALE:No, I would not.
LEADFEMALE:But I would let Darlene, so figure that one out.
LEADMALE:You know, you're worse than dad, Because you're a woman, and you should know better.
SUPMALE:Hey, Becky, if you want a car, Then you can just go get a job and buy yourself a car, but you're not getting a bike! And you What is it with you? All you do is just lay here on the couch staring at that stupid TV.
SUPFEMALE:One dumb rerun after another.
LEADFEMALE:And I do it as well as any man.
SUPMALE:Sorry I'm late.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:I got tied up at trucking school.
LEADFEMALE:I am really enjoying it, And my teacher told me that he thought I was doing really good.
SUPFEMALE:Only he's not sure that I can handle the solitude That a trucker's got to live with, right, So he dares me to sit in one one of the rigs For three hours, alone, no one to talk to, No one's talking to me.
LEADFEMALE:For three hoursalone.
LEADFEMALE:And I did it, and I feel great.
LEADFEMALE:Hip-hip-hooray, huh? Hello.
SUPFEMALE:You guys, you're just screwing with me, right? We have had a fight, And we're not speaking to each other.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what was the fight about? Maybe I can take a side.
LEADMALE:d.j. , what did you do in school today? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Oh, well That must have been really fun for you.

LEADMALE:Darlene, how's that first year of high school treating you? Oh, don't drag me into this.
LEADMALE:You answer her, Darlene.
LEADMALE:Why? Because if you don't, she will come after me next.
LEADMALE:High school's very educational, aunt Jackie.
OTHERMALE:You make the basketball team? Of course she made it.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't make first string.
SUPMALE:Give it time.
SUPMALE:You're only a freshman.
LEADFEMALE:When's your first game? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean you don't know? I mean, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I quit the team.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? I am no longer on the basketball team.
SUPMALE:You didn't talk to me first? Well, it's my decision, isn't it? What happened? You didn't make first string, So you're just bailing out? Look, I got other stuff to do.
LEADMALE:What other stuff? Hey, it's not like it was gonna be my career.
SUPMALE:Stop putting this jock label on me.
LEADMALE:See, there you go again, Dan.
OTHERMALE:You're doing it again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, god, here we go.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, This has nothing to do with Becky or the scooter Or with women's lib.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's just so easy for you, isn't it, Dan? Darlene is the jock, and Becky's the brain.
LEADMALE:What am I? We don't know yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Darlene's got a lot of talent, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:She doesn't want to be your little jock, Dan, So stop using her to fulfill some of your fantasies About being some great girl basketball player.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, you want to be a quitter, be a quitter.
LEADFEMALE:I give up.
LEADFEMALE:Quitter.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I thought that was a really good point-Shut up, Jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Mother, there are absolutely no jobs Out there that are right for me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I need something that'll leave me time to study And help around the house.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you know, what if you really need me here And I'm off at some stupid job? You know, you're right, Becky.
LEADMALE:You should forget about the stupid job, Because you know what? Your father and I have decided That we're just going to get you your very own little convertible.

SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
OTHERMALE:I did.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Well, then how come you just sat down And started talking about basketball? It was on TV.
LEADFEMALE:That's not it.
LEADFEMALE:All we ever talk about is basketball.
SUPFEMALE:No, any time I try to talk to you about anything, You turn it into basketball, and you run away.
SUPMALE:Face it, dad.
LEADFEMALE:All we ever used to do is talk about sports.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm a big girl-Right, right, and I label you.

OTHERFEMALE:I'll yak all night.
LEADMALE:Yak away.
SUPMALE:Just leave me out of it.
LEADFEMALE:And there she goes.
LEADMALE:She's off.
LEADFEMALE:Around the couch and up the stairs right into her room, Where she'll hide out like she always does.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me tell you something, little missy.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need to stand here And have you not talk to me.
LEADMALE:I got a wife and two other kids That are perfectly happy not to talk to me! What? Where the hell you been? What's with you? Darlene's turning into a zombie, And you're doing nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doing the best I can, Dan.
LEADMALE:Why's this about me? I didn't raise her alone, buddy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, you let her do whatever the hell she wants.
SUPFEMALE:If it was up to me, Darlene would still be playing basketball.
SUPMALE:Basketball is not her problem, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:I know that! You think I don't know that?! What do you think I am, stupid? What are you yelling at me for? Because I'm angry, and I need to yell, And you're standing in front of me, and she's not! Oh, ok.
LEADMALE:Well, you keep yelling, honey, and when it's my turn to yell, you just point at me.
LEADMALE:What are we going to do? Well, we'll just talk to her calmly and rationally and sensitively until she cracks.
LEADMALE:Darlene! I already tried it.
LEADMALE:It's your turn.
LEADMALE:Darlene! What? Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
SUPMALE:Jeez.
LEADFEMALE:I just did this with dad.

LEADFEMALE:You're like, withdrawn and distant and I just wondered if there's anything you want to talk about.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Darlene.
SUPMALE:You know how impressed your dad would be If you'd tell me what the problem is and I could fix it? Why is everyone so sure that there's some problem? Well, because you don't go anyplace, you don't do anything.
SUPMALE:You know, at least when you had basketball-Basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go again.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Come on back.
SUPMALE:I'm not telling you to play basketball.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's about the stupidest sport in the world anyway.
LEADMALE:And I spent all 4 years of high school pretending like I had cramps So I didn't have to play it, But I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It seemed like when you had basketball, You cared about something, you know? What do you care about now? I care about being left alone.
SUPFEMALE:Are you doing drugs, Darlene? No! Would you tell me if you were? If I was, no, I wouldn't tell you, But since I'm not, the answer is no.
LEADMALE:Why should I believe you? Because I'm saying it.
LEADFEMALE:You can search my room, give me a blood test, Do whatever you want.
SUPFEMALE:So what is it, Darlene? Is it school? It's school, it's my friends, it's the way I look, It's you, it's dad, it's everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, ok.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I can really relate to that, 'cause when I was-Please, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want you to help me.
LEADMALE:I just want you to leave me alone, please.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, what did you do to the meatloaf? Well, I guess I burned it, didn't I? But you can scrape off the outside and still eat the inside.
SUPMALE:I don't like it.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't even taste it.
LEADFEMALE:I want peanut butter and jelly.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I'm not a restaurant, ok? You eat what I cook, or you don't eat at all.
LEADMALE:Jeez.
SUPFEMALE:I want peanut butter and jelly.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I'm going to go see if Darlene wants to come down.
