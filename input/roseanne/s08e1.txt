SUPMALE:Okay, so we need brushes, lacquer, thinner, Turpentine, polyurethane and paint stripper.
OTHERMALE:anything else? nope.
SUPFEMALE:Remember though, that stuff needs a lot of ventilation, So take all the lids off in the car on the way home.
SUPMALE:What? I'm sorry for staring at you, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Conner, But there's just something about a pregnant woman that's just so beautiful.
OTHERMALE:beautiful how? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:You used the word beautiful, you must know what you mean.
SUPMALE:You're just beautiful, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? Is it my swollen ankles That you like, or My varicose veins-maybe they appeal to your artist's eye, huh? Or maybe it's my haggard face from lack of sleep.
LEADFEMALE:But I think the real question here is, Is "beautiful" strong enough a word? Thank you, Mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, For telling me to say that.
LEADFEMALE:beautiful how? hey, d.j. , Your old room's just about to be painted.
LEADMALE:Becky and Darlene volunteered to help.
OTHERFEMALE:How about you? No way.
LEADFEMALE:I'm moving across the hall and i'm never looking back.
LEADFEMALE:So why announce it? Nobody's gonna notice.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, at least tell your sisters to hurry up with that drop cloth.
LEADFEMALE:It's just so great, isn't it, Dan? Two girls all grown up, volunteering to Help paint their baby sister's nursery.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh! I remember that! How the pregnancy hormones get you all sentimental.
SUPFEMALE:Go to hell, Jackie.

LEADMALE:Jackie good.
SUPFEMALE:Though the nursery's really coming along.
SUPMALE:You gonna fix those dents in the wall before you paint it? oh, wow! You remember these, Rosie? I sure do.

SUPFEMALE:You've got to promise me you're not gonna paint over those, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I have to, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:But remember, we'll always have the x-rays.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, I got to get going, but now I have officially returned All the baby clothes that you lent me.
OTHERFEMALE:where's the rest of the stuff? what do you mean? Going alphabetically, after "clothes" comes "crib," Unless you dropped off some crab cakes.
LEADFEMALE:You want the crib back? Roseanne, my little andy still sleeps in that crib.
LEADMALE:Well, let him hop in bed with you.
SUPMALE:He's gonna be in therapy for the rest of his life anyway.
