LEADMALE:You know, I was just examining Our calendar of love.
LEADFEMALE:Seems I am to service you tonight.
LEADFEMALE:First, the seduction.
LEADMALE:Ah, well, not now, Dan.
SUPMALE:I got too many troubles with Jackie.
LEADMALE:She doesn't have a single clue About this whole pregnancy thing, you know? She's talking about having natural childbirth.
OTHERMALE:With no drugs.
OTHERFEMALE:You should show her the scar I gave you when I had d.j. Four stitches, saw the bone.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, next time i'll take the hand wound And you can have the episiotomy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that killed the mood.
LEADMALE:You know If Jackie would only tell Fred about this, Then he could be here helping her with this instead of you.
LEADFEMALE:He really should know.
LEADMALE:Please, Dan, it's bad enough That Jackie knows.
LEADMALE:Well, this is their problem.
LEADMALE:We're gonna have our own kid.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, I can hardly have a baby When Jackie's gonna have one.
SUPFEMALE:What? Hold on a damn minute here.
LEADMALE:You had a fit to have this kid.
SUPMALE:You put me on a sex schedule.
SUPFEMALE:You took away my underpants.
LEADFEMALE:You don't take away a man's underpants, Roseanne, And then change your mind! Well, Jackie needs me.
SUPMALE:What makes you think that? Because she told me so.
OTHERMALE:She is just absolutely Terrified, Dan, That if I have a baby too That I will not be around, you know, And available to help her.
LEADFEMALE:She got down on her knees and begged me.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:Let's just put our lives on hold for Jackie.
LEADMALE:Well, we can still have sex.
SUPMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Just wear that.
LEADFEMALE:You know how I get around.
LEADMALE:I'm angry at you, And when i'm angry at you, I'm not in the mood.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, since when? Just turn off the light and don't talk.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me what to do! And I figure it isn't a shower Without entertainment.
OTHERMALE:Well, Nancy, I don't think That a stripper is appropriate Entertainment for a baby shower.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's a really cool idea.
LEADFEMALE:He strips down to his diaper, And then he sits on everybody's lap.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? Your stomach bothering you? No.
SUPFEMALE:No, I told you I don't have morning sickness, okay? You know, you should eat a saltine.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want a saltine.
LEADFEMALE:It'll make you feel better.
LEADMALE:Roseanne Come on, for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Fred.
SUPFEMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:You know, lately I get the feeling You've been wanting To talk to me about something.
SUPFEMALE:Um, yeah, Fred, I sort of did.
SUPFEMALE:But I don't.
OTHERMALE:You know, Jackie, Fred's had the same dog for 10 years.
SUPFEMALE:I did not know that, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for telling me that.
LEADMALE:All of his plants are alive too.
SUPMALE:In fact, Fred, i've always found you A very loving and nurturing man.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Dan.
LEADMALE:I find your honesty unsettling.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean I admire you, Fred.
SUPMALE:You're that rare combination Of soft and caring yet strong and virile.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you two run outside And carve your initials into a tree? I'm gonna go to the bathroom now, And when I come back, Let's all be talking about something else.
LEADMALE:Look, hey, hey, whether or not I tell Fred is my own damn business.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Dan.
SUPMALE:Yeah, Roseanne, it's my baby.
OTHERMALE:Mine.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the one that had sex.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one who's getting fat.
SUPMALE:I'm the one whose hormones are gonna go crazy any day now.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish you would just leave me alone, Let me do it by myself.
LEADFEMALE:What? It's all your fault, Dan.
OTHERMALE:Ever since you told her you don't want to have a kid, She's trying to get her hands on mine.
LEADMALE:What? Roseanne, I thought you said We couldn't have a baby 'cause Jackie begged you to take care of hers.
LEADMALE:What! Roseanne, what the hell's going on here? Well, isn't it obvious? I mean, the two of you are in such deep denial That it is pathetic.
LEADFEMALE:What are we denying, Roseanne? Well, huh Okay, you're both denying the fact That you really do not want me to have a kid.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, the idea of it Just terrifies you so bad That you can't even cope with it.
SUPFEMALE:So in order to deal with it, You're putting the whole thing on someone else So the two of you can just deny, deny, deny.
OTHERFEMALE:You totally made that up in your own head.
LEADMALE:See how deep it goes! You lied to me, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but at least I had a good reason this time.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you can't handle a baby by yourself, Jackie.
SUPMALE:I mean, you're gonna be shooting people from a tower In a clown suit.
LEADFEMALE:If i'm tough enough to survive you, I'm tough enough to handle anything a kid's gonna throw at me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? What about steak knives? That's happened to me twice.
LEADMALE:Darlene throws like a boy.
SUPMALE:You are not that strong, Jackie, Because sometime your kid's gonna come to you And want to know who its father is, And you don't even have the guts To tell the father who the father is! Fred! I'm pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:You're the father.
SUPMALE:You want to talk about that, I'll be in the kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll meet you at home.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Dan, wait a minute! wow.
LEADMALE:Good thing I was sitting down.
LEADFEMALE:Turn the car off, Dan.
LEADMALE:I want to go home.
SUPMALE:We got to talk.
SUPMALE:If you don't want to have a baby, Don't go blaming it on me.
OTHERMALE:Maybe it's not that I don't want to have the baby, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's that I can't have a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Is there something I should know? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm 41 years old.
LEADMALE:Is that what this is all about? I mean, come on, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:We've only been trying for three months.
LEADMALE:I know, but we never used to have to try at all.
OTHERMALE:We'd get pregnant just using the same soap.
OTHERMALE:I was just thinking Maybe my body doesn't work anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Did you ever think Maybe it's my body that doesn't work anymore? Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's what got me through the first three months.
SUPMALE:Look, honey, if we can't, we can't.
SUPMALE:Then at least I get my wife back.
OTHERMALE:Then in six years, When d.j. goes and runs off with some religious cult, We can ride a couple of harleys across the country.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's a bunch of crap, Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:You want to have a baby as bad as I do.
LEADMALE:Not if it means screwing up my marriage.
OTHERMALE:You've been carrying this around for three months, And you never even said anything to me about it.
SUPMALE:We used to talk about stuff like this.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's 'cause it-it just hurts too much, Dan.
SUPMALE:I mean, every month, I--I let us down.
SUPFEMALE:You don't let us down.
LEADMALE:Well, that's what it feels like.
OTHERMALE:Well, it shouldn't feel like that.
LEADFEMALE:That is what it feels like.
SUPMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:We're throwing the damn calendar out.
LEADFEMALE:We're going back to doing the way we always did, And whatever happens happens.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Remember the good old days when sex was fun? Well, yeah, but those guys didn't mean anything to me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that dashboard really brings out your eyes.
LEADMALE:Boy, you french lads sure know what to say to a dame.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we shouldn't do it anyway, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you know, yesterday was my last fertile day.
SUPMALE:There'd be no point.
SUPFEMALE:There's a point.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but try to keep your butt below the window.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do you think maybe I could go to the lamaze classes or something with you? I mean, I am the father.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but I don't-I hardly know you, Fred.
LEADFEMALE:We only went out once.
LEADMALE:That's your fault.
LEADMALE:I wanted to go out with you The very next day after I impregnated you.
LEADFEMALE:Well Fred, we're gonna have a lot of problems here If you're Don't respect my space.
LEADMALE:I understand.
OTHERMALE:It's your body.
SUPFEMALE:It's your decision.
SUPMALE:There is nothing that I can do about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Fred.
OTHERMALE:Just promise me, if you ever need any help, Money, support, just somebody to talk to, Please call me.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Fred.
SUPMALE:I--I appreciate that.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess we should shake hands or something.
LEADMALE:Well Thanks for the child.
LEADMALE:You know that sawyer girl Who had a baby without a husband? She went insane! Listen, mom-Oh, my god, I just keep thinking, What would your father say? What would my father say? Your aunt-Mom, shh! I'm sorry! I couldn't help laugh-You get hurt? No! I told you I was gonna hit you.
LEADMALE:I know, but I--sorry.
LEADMALE:Was it too hard? No, it was good.
