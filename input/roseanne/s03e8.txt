OTHERMALE:1 Today's the day.
LEADMALE:24 hours of hell.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I must clear my mind.
SUPFEMALE:The bed is cold.
LEADMALE:She probably has a good half hour on me.
LEADMALE:Got to get out.
LEADMALE:Got to stay out all day.
SUPMALE:Minimize the damage.
LEADFEMALE:Get far away from ground zero.
SUPMALE:Getting too old for this.
LEADFEMALE:The horror.
LEADFEMALE:The horror.
LEADMALE:Shh! Shh! Before Dan gets up, let's go over the plans for his surprise party.
OTHERFEMALE:Crystal, what do you have to report? I want to thank you for having me do decorations.
OTHERMALE:You're quite welcome.
OTHERMALE:And, in light of our $40 budget, I have decided upon balloons and stupid hats.
LEADFEMALE:Good choice.
OTHERMALE:And now can we hear from the cake committee? Two "P"s in happy, right? How are you going to get Dan down there, Roseanne? I'll say, "it's all-you can-eat-night at the lodge.
LEADFEMALE:You got to defend your crown.
LEADFEMALE:" So what should we do? You help Crystal with decorations.
SUPMALE:Darlene, I don't care if you want to go or not, you're going.
LEADMALE:I hate these parties.
LEADFEMALE:No kid should have to watch their parents do the hully-gully.
OTHERFEMALE:Not for the squeamish.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, dad.
LEADMALE:Crystal, let's get out to those garage sales.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you can always find a bargain.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, where you going? Fishing.
SUPFEMALE:Today? Goodbye.
SUPMALE:It's November, dad.
SUPFEMALE:The lake is frozen.
SUPMALE:Then I'm bowling.
LEADMALE:See you tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Dan, wait! Don't you want to be with your family? Is this a trick question? What about the Michigan/Illinois game, dad? Don't you guys realize what today is? Oh, Dan, I forgot.
LEADMALE:It's Dan's birthday.
LEADFEMALE:It is? Happy birthday, Dan.
OTHERMALE:Forget my birthday.
SUPMALE:Do I have to spell it out? P-m-s.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my god! Are you sure? 17 years, every 28 days.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'm sure.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Dan.
LEADMALE:Roseanne seems perfectly pleasant today.
SUPFEMALE:When have you ever known Roseanne to be perfectly pleasant? I'm at the mall.
SUPMALE:I got basketball practice.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:No, no! Hold on! It'll be a 24-hour roller coaster ride with Sybil at the switch.
LEADFEMALE:When my hormones act up, I'm good for one solid day of pure mean.
LEADFEMALE:Once I busted a street light for every man who ever broke my heart.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I remember the great blackout of '84.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, wait.
LEADMALE:You can't leave.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't let go, I'm prepared to gnaw my own arm off.
LEADMALE:Dan! Dan! Roseanne's got a big surprise party planned for you down at the lodge.
SUPFEMALE:There's going to be like 50 people there.
LEADMALE:No, it can't be.
SUPMALE:Now, Dan, don't worry.
LEADMALE:Roseanne does not have PMS today.
LEADMALE:Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you think I'm pretty? I'm out of here! Ok.
LEADMALE:So far, so good.
LEADFEMALE:Dan's out working in the garage, out of the line of fire.
SUPMALE:Dan! Dan, you in there? Yeah! What are you doing? Fixing this thing here.
LEADFEMALE:It's Hair.
LEADFEMALE:Hair is different.
LEADMALE:Do I like it? What if she doesn't? Got to say something before Don't you like my hair? Too late.
LEADFEMALE:I love it! I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:I do something to make myself a little more attractive to you, and you don't even notice.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't do this for myself.
LEADFEMALE:I can't even see the hair on my head.
SUPMALE:God, you men! You're taking me and the kids to the lodge at 5:00, and that's it.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't care if it is your birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:5:00! He doesn't suspect a thing.
SUPFEMALE:I tricked him into going, but No, he just thinks it's another normal birthday dinner.
LEADMALE:Mom, you're ironing the towels? I can't wait around for you to do it, can I? Stay away from those towels! I have to refold them! Why don't you go put on your pretty pink dress with the little flowers on it? The pink dress? The one I had on first? And tell your sister to hurry up.
SUPMALE:This whole family would fall apart if I wasn't here.
LEADMALE:You're wearing that one? No.
LEADFEMALE:And hurry up! I'm starving! This whole surprise party thing sure seemed a lot better last week.
LEADFEMALE:Whose stupid idea was this, anyway? I know it was.
LEADFEMALE:Don't throw it in my face.
SUPFEMALE:Don't patronize me, Crystal! If you're going to have that kind of attitude, don't come if you don't want to.
LEADMALE:You want to, don't you? It wouldn't be a party without you.
OTHERMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Aah! You know, Dan, I've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I ought to take some night school classes like creative writing, word processing, or something like that.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I'm supposed to say something here.
LEADFEMALE:Let's try Sounds good, honey.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should really join an aerobics class and try to get in shape.
LEADMALE:I could do both, but I'd never be home.
SUPMALE:What do you think? Um Oh, you look like the perfect little gentleman.
LEADMALE:Let's see your hands.
SUPMALE:They're filthy.
SUPFEMALE:You wash them.
OTHERMALE:You ought to wash your hands, too, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this tie! I've always loved this tie.
SUPFEMALE:The green and stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I'll change into my green dress so we'll match! Stay away from those clean towels.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan? Save yourself.
LEADMALE:I kind of want to apologize to you 'cause, well, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I know I've been a little excitable today.
SUPFEMALE:Hadn't really noticed, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Know what I asked Darlene to do? Catalog all my coupons according to expiration date and the four food groups.
OTHERFEMALE:Then I began this letter to my third grade best friend.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't had her address for something like 20 years! That's ok, honey.
SUPMALE:You get whacked out every now and then.
LEADMALE:What's your point, Dan? I really don't have a point.
SUPFEMALE:Say it because I know what you're thinking.
LEADMALE:You think I have PMS.
SUPFEMALE:No, I wasn't thinking that, but I have been reading on it lately.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know they have pills that supposedly help If you did have PMS.
LEADMALE:A pill? A pill! You want me to take a pill? Do they have a pill for you, Dan? Oh! We're going to be late for Roseanne's surprise party.
LEADMALE:It's my surprise party, Jackie, and why didn't you stop her? I hate surprise parties.
LEADFEMALE:The only people having fun are the people who were in on it.
LEADMALE:You're in on it.
LEADMALE:Can we go so we can get home? Is she changing into another outfit? Or another personality.
LEADMALE:Let's just enjoy our one moment of peace.
SUPFEMALE:Dan, get in here! I love you, daddy.
LEADMALE:You're going in.
SUPFEMALE:Could be a suicide mission.
LEADFEMALE:Stay low.
LEADFEMALE:Stay low.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPMALE:You'll get through this.
LEADFEMALE:Somewhere your real wife waits for you.
LEADMALE:Come here, you big sexy man.
LEADMALE:That's not her.
OTHERMALE:Of course you don't have to tell your real wife.
LEADMALE:We're out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Jeez, what were you guys doing in there? Never mind.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Honey, come on.
LEADFEMALE:We're almost going to be real late.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going.
LEADMALE:Ok, ok, look, we've been through this before.
LEADMALE:We know she's got 100 different personalities.
OTHERFEMALE:We've seen them all.
SUPMALE:How can I go when we're destroying the ozone layer? Kids, I want you to remember this.
LEADMALE:PMS is serious stuff.
SUPFEMALE:It causes depression, anxiety, physical pain.
LEADFEMALE:And it's rough on your mother, too.
LEADMALE:Listen, everybody, I'm going to check if our table's ready.
LEADMALE:You wait for me.
OTHERMALE:Hey, now, nobody eats the food, got it? Now, get around the door here and be really, really quiet.
OTHERMALE:Then when Dan comes in, just yell surprise.
LEADFEMALE:You know how, right? Our table's ready.
LEADMALE:Surprise! Surprise! For he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow Come on.
OTHERMALE:I'm starving.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's eat.
LEADMALE:Isn't this great, Dan? All your friends came.
LEADMALE:It's great, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:How did you do this without me knowing? You really were surprised, weren't you? Are you kidding? When I You know, Dan, we should have a song, shouldn't we? Then, whenever we hear it, we'd go, that's our song.
OTHERFEMALE:Did I invite you? Eddie, Eddie, hi.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? Oh, ok.
LEADFEMALE:You're all right then.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, I love your hair.
LEADFEMALE:See, Dan.
SUPMALE:So, what do you think, Roseanne? About what? The decorations.
LEADFEMALE:I planned this very carefully.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you didn't realize there are exactly 40 balloons here.
LEADMALE:40? Dan is 39, Crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm sorry, Roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I got him one to grow on.
LEADFEMALE:You needn't apologize to me.
LEADFEMALE:Apologize to Dan for ruining his party! There he goes.
OTHERMALE:Hey, this ought to be our song.
OTHERMALE:Play it again.
SUPMALE:I'm pooped.
LEADMALE:I'm sitting.
OTHERMALE:You're no fun.
SUPFEMALE:Come dance with me, sis.
LEADMALE:Nah Please? Don't you think the party's going real good? The party's going great.
SUPFEMALE:Dan's having a good time, don't you think? Are you kidding? What we have to remember is, she's a wonderful woman when her estrogen isn't whipping her into a psychotic frenzy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Like when I sprained my ankle, she was there.
SUPMALE:And when I got ditched at the dance.
OTHERMALE:And when your parents separated, Dan.
LEADMALE:She was there.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's face it She's bad luck.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go see if mom left any chocolate on the dessert table.
SUPFEMALE:Need anything, Dan? Menopause.
LEADFEMALE:And there's some damn good-looking guys here tonight.
SUPMALE:Ah, get off.
OTHERFEMALE:It's been almost a month since Gary dumped you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I dumped Gary.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Now here you are at some crummy party dancing with your sister.
LEADMALE:It breaks my heart to see you like this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine! You don't have to yell.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the one person that loves you most.
SUPMALE:Roseanne! If you weren't my sister, I just don't know who would be.
LEADMALE:Having fun? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You're probably wondering where Nancy is.
LEADMALE:Who's Nancy? We had a fight.
SUPFEMALE:She said she paid for everything.
LEADMALE:She kicked me out.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm living in my car.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it's her car.
SUPFEMALE:I guess poker night at your place is out.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Singing telegram for Dan Conner! What's that? Me and the guys got together to say happy birthday.
SUPMALE:Well, hello there, birthday boy.
LEADMALE:Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Yeah! Out! Well, uh Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! You are the reason why there will never be a woman president! Whose idea was this? I might have known.
LEADFEMALE:Rosie.
SUPMALE:I blame you for it, Dan.
LEADMALE:I might have expected it from your slimy friends, but not from the father of my children.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, dear.
LEADFEMALE:As if that makes everything ok.
SUPFEMALE:That poor woman was only trying to do her job and has been made to feel like dirt.
OTHERMALE:I have to go comfort her, thanks to you! Mental note Kill Arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Dan.
LEADMALE:Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dan, Dan! She's making people do the limbo! You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:No.

LEADMALE:It's my birthday.
SUPMALE:There are no birthdays in hell.
LEADFEMALE:Go before somebody's hurt.
SUPFEMALE:Give me a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:I just realized I'm 39 years old.
LEADFEMALE:39.
SUPFEMALE:Next year, I'll be 40.
SUPFEMALE:40.
LEADFEMALE:That's almost middle-aged.
SUPFEMALE:What have I done with my life? Oh, cut the introspective crap and get in there! Why do I have to put up with this every month? So she's got hormones.
SUPMALE:Why should she just get away with it? When is it my turn? When will everybody tiptoe around me? When do I get PMS? Better now? Yeah, I'm good.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:We're just about ready to open the presents.
LEADFEMALE:Presents.
LEADMALE:That that's almost the end, right? No.
OTHERMALE:Cake.
LEADMALE:Come on, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Gather around.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan's going to open his presents now.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Look, everybody! Aw.
SUPMALE:Aw.

LEADMALE:d.j. Made it himself.
LEADFEMALE:It's a macaroni thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, look, honey.
LEADFEMALE:He even spelled out "dad" using little, tiny spaghetti-Os.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, and you said he had no talent.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see what's inside this one, huh? Hang in there, champ.
SUPMALE:Only a couple more rounds to go.
SUPFEMALE:You're doing fine.
OTHERMALE:Can I have your attention? I'd like to propose a toast to my husband, so everybody hold up your glasses.
SUPFEMALE:Higher.
SUPFEMALE:For you, Dan Conner, my husband, my best friend, the father of these children.
LEADFEMALE:You Are the ink in my pen.
LEADFEMALE:You are the paper on which I write.

SUPFEMALE:We've had many wonderful times.
SUPFEMALE:We've had many, many bad times.
LEADFEMALE:Happy birthday, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Hear, hear.
LEADMALE:Hear, hear.
LEADFEMALE:Like when we sawOl' Yeller and you cried.
LEADFEMALE:You made me promise I'd never tell anybody, and I never have, and I never will.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, dear.
LEADMALE:So here's to you, Dan Conner, my husband, my soul mate, my friend, my rock God, please let this be over.
SUPMALE:A big rock on my couch that does nothing but watch TV.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:God's a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Occasionally, it'll ask for a beer, and I have to get it because it's just a rock.
SUPFEMALE:A rock can't roll over to the refrigerator, so I have to get the beer for it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, a big TV-watching, beer-drinking rock But he's my rock, and I must live with it.
LEADMALE:So happy birthday, Dan! Happy birthday, Dan! Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday, dear Dan happy birthday to you Make a wish, Dan.

OTHERMALE:My birthday was yesterday, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:I know, but we forgot to do your traditional birthday breakfast.
LEADMALE:What's it going to be, pancakes, waffles, an omelet? Nothing's too good for my man.
SUPMALE:I think I'll just go to the bedroom, read the paper, not talk to a soul.
LEADMALE:Is that ok with you, Roseanne? God, he gets so damn moody.
OTHERMALE:Happens every month, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hmpfh, men!
LEADFEMALE:
