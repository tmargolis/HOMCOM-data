LEADFEMALE:I'm not spending summer vacation at the Grand Canyon.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Think.
SUPFEMALE:You make us go on some long car trip just so you can look down a big hole.
LEADMALE:You don't want any of us standing behind you.
LEADMALE:Ok, show of hands.
SUPFEMALE:Who doesn't want to go to the Grand Canyon? You don't want to do anything as a family? Fine.
LEADMALE:We'll spend summer in the inflatable pool.
LEADMALE:Ooh, show of hands.
SUPFEMALE:Meeting adjourned.
LEADMALE:See you next year.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Where do you think you're going? Basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:You're doing the dishes, or no allowance next week.
SUPFEMALE:Deal.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:I guess a $3.
OTHERMALE:00 threat ain't what it used to be.
LEADFEMALE:Becky.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:They don't even try to humor us anymore.
LEADMALE:How come I got three kids and a husband and I end up doing all the grunt work? The beauty is you actually grunt while you're doing it.
OTHERMALE:I want a dishwasher! Now, we've been all through this, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:The kitchen wasn't designed for one.
SUPMALE:You don't have the right plumbing, you'd lose half your cabinet space.
LEADMALE:Trust me.
SUPMALE:I'm a professional contractor.
LEADFEMALE:It can't be done.
SUPFEMALE:Then I want you to build me that shelf by the door.
LEADFEMALE:That's a whole other ball of worms.
LEADFEMALE:You ain't got the right wall studs.
LEADMALE:The whole unit would fall right over.
SUPMALE:You never build me nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what about this fabulous service porch I built for your washer and drier? Just 'cause you got tired of watching me do laundry in the rain.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you didn't tell me the new neighbors were moving in today.
SUPFEMALE:What's the story? What are they like? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Like you haven't been watching through the window all morning.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the husband Darren, he's in advertising, and they have this real cute little girl Tabatha, but the wife, I don't know.
LEADMALE:Something's wrong with her.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's a witch.
LEADMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Who's this? He's Todd.
LEADMALE:He just moved in next door.
LEADFEMALE:He's my new best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Todd.
SUPMALE:Nice to meet you.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Can Todd camp out in the back yard with us next week? If it's ok with his folks.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Do you have to come? It's my tent.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll be ok.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I burp real good.
LEADFEMALE:Prove it.
LEADMALE:Well, you're on, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Better hold on to the table, Todd.
LEADFEMALE:You're not wearing anything flammable, are you? No.
SUPMALE:Hello.

LEADMALE:Aw, that.
LEADMALE:I could have done better, but I didn't want to hurt the lad.
LEADMALE:We've got a lot of packing to do.
LEADMALE:d.j. was just going to show me his room.
LEADFEMALE:It'll only take a minute.
OTHERMALE:While you're upstairs, show him how to make his bed.
LEADFEMALE:All right! Do you want some coffee? I've got some.
SUPFEMALE:I've got some fudge, too.
LEADFEMALE:It's nowhere near as thick as the coffee, but it's pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, no.
LEADMALE:No, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, sit down at least.
OTHERMALE:I can only stay a minute.
SUPMALE:So You've been doing a lot of work over there lately.
LEADFEMALE:I hope the workmen didn't bother you.
SUPFEMALE:Nah.
SUPFEMALE:Except for one time they came over and asked us to hold it down.
SUPMALE:Your turn.
SUPFEMALE:So, where you from? Oh, uh, Chicago.
SUPMALE:Oh, Chicago.
LEADFEMALE:I love it there.
OTHERFEMALE:There's so much going on with the restaurants and museums and theaters.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? What? I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I sneezed.
SUPFEMALE:I, uh I'm allergic to dust.
OTHERMALE:I just dusted.
SUPFEMALE:That's the only thing that makes me sneeze.
SUPMALE:You call that a sneeze? See you later, d.j. Bye, Todd.
OTHERMALE:Very nice meeting all of you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure I'll see you around.
LEADMALE:If you need anything, give us a call.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
SUPMALE:Man, she is a witch.
LEADMALE:Now Roseanne She hated my house.
SUPMALE:She just sneezed Sort of.
SUPMALE:She wouldn't sit down, she wouldn't have coffee.
LEADMALE:She wouldn't even take two steps away from the door.
LEADFEMALE:So she's nervous about new people.
LEADMALE:Why? We're fun.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't Maybe she was a little uptight.
LEADMALE:A little uptight? Man, you couldn't drag a needle out of her butt with a tractor.
SUPMALE:Remember, we're here because we're neighbors.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm here looking for dust.
LEADMALE:This isn't going to be pleasant, is it? If I find dust, know what I'll do? I'll sneeze.
LEADFEMALE:Not one of them little needle-butt sneezes neither.
SUPMALE:I'm going to blow a lung all over her living room.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome wagon.
LEADMALE:Welcome wagon.
LEADMALE:Ohh How neighborly.
SUPMALE:Well, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just put this in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Neighborly.
LEADMALE:My god, Roseanne, this is our house.
SUPMALE:Same floor plan, same stairs, same archway.
SUPFEMALE:It's the exact same house.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the house I could have had if I would have married somebody better.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:My, uh, husband's in the study.
LEADMALE:I'll just go get him.
LEADMALE:Study? They turned our bedroom into a study.
LEADMALE:Well, you turned the bathroom into a library.
LEADFEMALE:Look-it! You've been lying to me for 12 years.
SUPFEMALE:What? That there is the very shelf I told you I wanted which you says I can't have on account of there wasn't the right studs.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, stand back.
LEADMALE:That sucker's liable to fall over.
LEADMALE:This place is a death trap.
LEADMALE:Hey there, neighbors.
LEADFEMALE:Jerry Bowman.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Dan Conner.
SUPFEMALE:This is my wife Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Great to meet you.
LEADMALE:We lived in our Chicago apartment for nine years, and neighbors never brought us cake.
OTHERMALE:Come on, let's eat.
LEADMALE:Man, I just can't believe how much your living room reminds me of ours.
OTHERFEMALE:Well Well, i-I'm not quite finished with it yet.
OTHERMALE:Honey Remember, f-for better or for worse.
LEADFEMALE:It's a dishwasher! Bet you tore out half the kitchen to get that sucker in there.
SUPFEMALE:Not really.
LEADFEMALE:I thought there wasn't room, but then the contractor slid it right in.
SUPMALE:Whole thing took an hour.
SUPFEMALE:Was there cake? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, sit down.
SUPMALE:Oh, uh, you know, I don't have any coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we go over to our house and I'll make some? Boy, I'd love to, but I'm awfully tired.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, um, maybe we should do this another time.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:We should have given you time to settle in.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, yeah, we just need time to settle in, but, uh, look, thanks for coming, and we'll do this another time, ok? Ok.
LEADMALE:Good night, Jerry, Kathy.
SUPMALE:Good night, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Good night, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:No coffee, I'm sure.
OTHERMALE:She couldn't wait to get us out of her house.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, honey, calm down.
SUPMALE:You'll feel better after a good night's sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:Like I'm going to get any sleep with all the noise you'll be making building me that new shelf.
SUPMALE:I'll try to keep it down.
SUPFEMALE:I'm over at Buy 'n Bag, so I see Kathy walking by, and I'm her neighbor, so I wave at her.
LEADFEMALE:She sees me, but she walks right by like she doesn't see me.
SUPFEMALE:So I'm standing there with my hand in the air.
SUPFEMALE:Then, you know you have to wave at somebody, so I end up waving at the produce manager.
LEADMALE:Now he thinks I have the hots for him.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I could meet a guy in management.
LEADMALE:I just don't get it.
LEADMALE:Her kid plays with my kid.
SUPMALE:Her husband plays with my husband.
LEADMALE:I don't know why she won't play with me.
LEADMALE:You never used to worry about what people thought about you.
LEADMALE:That's 'cause everybody likes me.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, what does Dan say? He talks to that Jerry guy.
SUPMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, he goes that she never wanted to leave Chicago in the first place, and she don't like it here much.
SUPMALE:Big deal.
LEADMALE:Nobody likes it here.
LEADMALE:That's why we watch so damn much TV.
OTHERMALE:Can I go now? I suppose.
SUPMALE:All right, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne Yeah? I like you.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:'Course, I don't have to live next door to you.
LEADMALE:Ha ha.
SUPFEMALE:50 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:What a moron.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know it was a handicap space, ok? That little glow-inthe-dark wheelchair didn't tip you off? Mom, look.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh, man.
LEADFEMALE:It's your very first ticket.
LEADFEMALE:It's just beautiful.
LEADMALE:I'll put it up here next to d.j. 's finger painting.
OTHERMALE:What am I going to do? Pay it.
LEADMALE:How about if I say it blew off the window? Yeah, that's a good one.
LEADMALE:The judge will go for that.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's, like, his first minute on the job.
SUPMALE:Hi, mom.
LEADMALE:Todd cut his arm.
LEADMALE:Oh, geez.
OTHERMALE:Darlene, get me a Band-Aid.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? We were playing down where they're building the new supermarket.
LEADMALE:I told you not to go down there.
LEADFEMALE:You could get hurt.
OTHERMALE:I didn't.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:That's a beauty there, Todd.
SUPMALE:You'd better go home and show it to your mom.
SUPFEMALE:And tell her to dress you warm for the camp-out tonight.
LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:See you tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not done yelling at you yet.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:I told you you're not supposed to go to construction sites to play.
SUPMALE:It's dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:You could get hurt.
LEADMALE:But Todd's never been to one I don't care.
LEADMALE:That's what I told you, and that's what you do.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Go on upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:I was driving you to the mall, so you should pay half.
LEADFEMALE:That's 25 bucks.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok, 15.
LEADMALE:12.
LEADMALE:50.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm Nah, you pay the whole thing.
OTHERMALE:Thanks a lot.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Kathy.
LEADFEMALE:I was just cleaning up a little bit.
LEADMALE:Todd told me he cut his arm at some construction site.
SUPMALE:Did you know they were there? Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:They just told me.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, I left him here assuming you'd keep an eye on him.
SUPFEMALE:They took off on their bikes.
SUPMALE:You allow your son to leave whenever he wants? Yeah, I encourage it.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:When my son takes off on his bike, I like to ask him where he's going.
LEADMALE:If he tells me it's a place with broken glass and little pieces of metal, I say no.
LEADFEMALE:You come over here, but only to tell me you're a better mom than I am.
OTHERMALE:I always know where my son is, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've got three kids and a job, and I can't be everywhere, ok? So I've got to trust my kids, and they're still alive.
LEADFEMALE:I've obviously done something right.
OTHERMALE:You're a better mother because you have more children? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I have three, and you only have one 3-to-1, get it? I have three, I win! Oh, please.
LEADMALE:You probably sneak into Todd's room to check if he's breathing.
LEADFEMALE:Yes Amateur.
LEADFEMALE:My son could have been seriously injured today, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:We're talking about 8-year-old boys here.
OTHERFEMALE:If you're going to blame me for everything they do that you don't like, then just don't send Todd over here anymore.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I had in mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go you one better.
SUPMALE:I'm not sending d.j. over to your house, because I don't need him picking up your attitude.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and just exactly what attitude is that? That one right there.
LEADFEMALE:The one where you think you're too damn good to live next door to me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not.
OTHERFEMALE:You're some stressed-out, over-protective snob who paid way too much for her house.
SUPMALE:And how do you know Everybody knows.
SUPFEMALE:Look, just forget it, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:I don't why I'm even talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not! The police knew the killer was insane.
LEADMALE:At night, he would stalk poor unsuspecting campers.
LEADFEMALE:And as he would creep up upon their tents, he would whistle.
LEADFEMALE:And then he'd hack them to pieces with a machete.
OTHERMALE:Can I have machete? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well? Did they ever catch him? Yeah, once.
LEADMALE:They handcuffed him, but he hacked off his own hand to escape.
LEADFEMALE:And now, he has a hook which he uses to kill his victims and drag their lifeless corpses along the bloody ground.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to the machete? You can't have one! Anyway, he was last spotted here in Lanford.
LEADMALE:The police have been searching for days What was that? What? That's the whistling killer.
SUPMALE:Don't make a sound.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be safe in here.
LEADMALE:Aah! Aah! It's the hook! Mom, I thought you were supposed to bring us something to eat.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Did we scare you, d.j. ? Yeah.
LEADMALE:He was scared you would hurt the hook guy.
LEADMALE:Well, carry on.
SUPFEMALE:All right, where was I? I still don't get why Todd couldn't be here.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm here, and we're having fun, right? Yeah, but he's my best friend.
LEADMALE:Well, you guys got into trouble together.
SUPMALE:So when can we play together again? When you can prove you won't do it again.
LEADMALE:How can we do that if we can't play together? Hang on a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You're here.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and I heard.
LEADFEMALE:Rosey.
SUPMALE:If I go over there, that's like admitting I was wrong, and I wasn't wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Do it for the kids.
OTHERMALE:Oh, cut the telethon crap, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Geez, I have to go over there and eat crow? You'll be the better person.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell him another story.
SUPMALE:I'll be right back.
SUPMALE:Did I ever tell you about the killer who carried his own head around in a bowling bag? No.
LEADMALE:I'm a better person.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a better person.
LEADFEMALE:Hope I don't kill her.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I came to invite Todd to d.j. 's camp-out.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm sure that we both said things that we regret.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh I meant what I said.
LEADMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Uh I regret What I said, ok? Uh Like, d.j. really likes Todd, and to be quite frank, d.j. doesn't have that many friends.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe that has something to do with the attitude with which he was raised.
LEADMALE:Well, now, that's something to chew on.
LEADFEMALE:So, can Todd come? Roseanne, I just wish I could be sure that when Todd is over there, he's receiving the same kind of supervision he would be getting here at home.
LEADMALE:Ok, hey, I personally guarantee his safe return.
SUPFEMALE:Well, as long as you're Admitting that you are wrong.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:I'll just see if Todd wants to go.
SUPFEMALE:Todd Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, Kathy, just 'cause we're neighbors doesn't mean we have to like each other.
SUPFEMALE:No, we don't.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't even have to pretend.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPFEMALE:But we shouldn't take it out on the kids.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:Good night, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, needle-butt.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for helping carry this in.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no problem, neighbor.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think about Lanford, Jerry? I think it's great.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I like best of all, I mean, honest? For the first time in my life, I own a tree.
LEADMALE:Wow.
SUPMALE:No, listen, I'm going to let you in on something.
SUPFEMALE:This morning Kathy and Todd were still asleep I went out in the yard in my robe and slippers, and honest to god I hugged my tree.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just I wouldn't tell that story down at the lodge, Jerry.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, that looks good.
LEADFEMALE:That looks just like the one in my house Like like exactly.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne saw it there.
LEADFEMALE:Now I have one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, you're new here.
SUPMALE:But in a small town when one man remodels, all men suffer.
LEADMALE:
