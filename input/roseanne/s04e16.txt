SUPMALE:Miss! In a minute.
SUPMALE:In a minute! Can I at least get a menu here? No.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't want to get your hopes up.
SUPFEMALE:Just put it on a plate.
LEADFEMALE:I'll pick the hairs out of it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, god.
SUPMALE:You looked swamped.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I'm late.
LEADMALE:Don't apologize to me.
LEADMALE:Apologize to the people I took it out on.
LEADFEMALE:Let me get my coat off.
SUPFEMALE:Walter, what's it going to be? It's unbelievable, Roseanne! I just saw the television set That lets you watch two channels at once.
SUPFEMALE:You can watch what you're watching and what you're missing at the same time, But you're missing life, because-You're getting soup.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:k.
LEADMALE:I hate it when his mommy don't pack his lunch.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Damn it! What? I threw out my back again.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:This is just getting ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:How am I supposed to work when this happens all the time? Let me just sit down.
LEADMALE:Miss! You sit right here.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get that.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss, you got any steak sauce? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's on the other side of the counter there.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind getting it yourself? I can't bend over too good.
SUPMALE:O.
OTHERMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I've seen a couple of doctors.
LEADMALE:They've described these pills, Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind getting it yourself, because I can't really reach up too good? Cut yourself a great big slab.
OTHERMALE:Walter, your soup's up.
LEADFEMALE:Got it.
SUPFEMALE:Walter, honey, will you take those fries and drop them off to this guy in the red? Thanks a lot.
LEADMALE:You want some more coffee? Do you mind, since you're up, pouring her another cup? Well, the pot's almost empty.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, there's some filters right on the shelf there.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, what are you doing? It's taken me a while, but I do believe I'm finally getting the hang of this job.
LEADMALE:Have a seat, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Conner, The doctor will be here in a minute.
LEADMALE:So, what did he say? "Put your clothes on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm done.
LEADMALE:" You know, like any man.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! No.
LEADMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Dixon will be able to help you.
LEADMALE:Why? He's the best.
LEADMALE:He helped me so much When I hurt my back on the force.
LEADMALE:You have a crush on him.
SUPFEMALE:I do not.
LEADMALE:I hope he can do something.
LEADFEMALE:I can't lay in bed when this happens anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I thought the girls were taking care of you.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:They're sick of me.
SUPMALE:The next time I ask for a pillow they're going to brick up my bedroom.
SUPMALE:Sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:.
LEADFEMALE:Conner.
SUPMALE:Jackie! Hi, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Dixon! How's the back? Oh, it's o.
SUPFEMALE:k.
SUPFEMALE:It acts up every once in a while.
LEADFEMALE:Since when? Since Shut up.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should make an appointment.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:That would be fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, Mrs.
LEADMALE:.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner, your x-rays show No spinal damage or abnormality.
LEADMALE:Which means it's a muscular problem.
SUPMALE:I should try diet and exercise, maybe even hot baths.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll prescribe these little blue pills that don't do anything.
SUPFEMALE:Guess that just leaves the small matter of my fee.
LEADMALE:So you can't do anything either? A surgical procedure would give you some relief.
OTHERFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You haven't heard what it is yet.
SUPMALE:I'm talking about a breast reduction.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yikes.
LEADMALE:Are you sure you're not reading The wrong side of the x-rays? You have bra strap pain.
LEADFEMALE:Most of your problems are in the upper back and shoulders.
OTHERMALE:Your back continually compensates for your front, which is Huge.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:If you reduce the weight of your breasts, your posture will be better.
OTHERFEMALE:That will lessen lower back pain.
LEADMALE:Do people really do this? Yeah, it's fairly common.
LEADFEMALE:The risk is minimal.
SUPMALE:Well, what happens? I brought a brochure to show you.
SUPFEMALE:See, the surgeon makes an incision underneath the breast, around the nipple, And in a vertical line between the two.
LEADFEMALE:The excess breast tissue is then removed, and the nipple is then grafted back onto the breast in a higher position.
LEADMALE:What sick nazi man came up with this idea? It sounds worse than it is.
OTHERMALE:Maybe it's something that should think about.
OTHERFEMALE:It's crazy! Well, you've tried everything else.
SUPMALE:Well, how much do they take off? Just enough so you wouldn't need to see me anymore.
SUPFEMALE:What am I going to look like? What if he goes crazy? I don't want to end up looking like, you know.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey! I didn't mean that.
SUPMALE:I just meant these have been a big part of what I am my whole life.
LEADMALE:We're talking about changing that.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you'll feel better.
LEADMALE:I think it's just a moot point anyway.
LEADMALE:It's not like I could ever afford it.
LEADMALE:How much does that cost? Around $6,000.
LEADMALE:Each? No.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Since you've had chronic problems, insurance would probably cover about 80% of it.
LEADMALE:Look, obviously you've got a lot of thinking to do, and, if you want, I can recommend a wonderful specialist.
SUPMALE:Or you might want a second opinion.
SUPMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure I will when I get home.
LEADMALE:Only one night in the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:That's a pro.
OTHERMALE:It's the hospital.
OTHERMALE:Con.
LEADMALE:An art linkletter bed, color TV, room service.
LEADMALE:Pro.
LEADMALE:But the food will suck.
SUPMALE:Con.
LEADFEMALE:It sucks here.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be away from the kids.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but they'll want to visit.
LEADMALE:But you'll be drugged up, so call them names and fall back asleep.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Huge pro.
LEADMALE:What about Dan, though? Dan wants you to feel better.
LEADMALE:I don't even know how to tell him about this.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll think of some-Con, con, con.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll pretend like nothing happened.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing did happen.
SUPMALE:I haven't made up my mind.
SUPMALE:Mark, the car never made this noise before.
LEADFEMALE:It's like a rattling noise.
OTHERFEMALE:No, my father already fixed it.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I can't get it out of the driveway.
SUPMALE:Car doesn't have to run for you to live in it.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How come you're just sitting there? Waiting for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Did it ever occur to you to get off your butt and heat something up? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:It was way too early to panic.
SUPMALE:Well, where's d.j. ? He got hungry and went over to Todd's.
LEADMALE:God, if I didn't come home, you all would starve to death.
LEADFEMALE:Will you hem my new jeans? Yes, but can I please make dinner for you first? Please? If you're making meatloaf, I'm just having salad.
SUPMALE:Does anybody care this woman was at the doctor and has something important to discuss with you all? Thank you, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:It would've been stupid to wait for the right time.
LEADMALE:What did he tell you? It's kind of funny, actually.
SUPFEMALE:I went there to talk about my back.
LEADFEMALE:All he just kept talking about was my boobs.
SUPMALE:Do you want me to beat him up? No.
SUPMALE:He said I should maybe think about getting a breast reduction.
LEADMALE:What? He said it would maybe help my back if I got my boobs shortened up.
LEADMALE:Are you going to do it? I haven't made up my mind yet.
LEADMALE:The doctor says her back keeps going out because of all the weight up front.
OTHERMALE:How long would you be in the hospital? She'd go in the night before.
SUPFEMALE:It would take a couple of weeks to get better, so you'd have to help out with the cooking and housecleaning.
SUPFEMALE:After that she'll go back to doing all the chores, and you'd be off the hook.
LEADMALE:Make that the last thing you say.
SUPFEMALE:O.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADMALE:, o.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADMALE:If it'll stop the back pain, you should have the operation.
LEADMALE:You'll feel better.
LEADFEMALE:You'll look great.
SUPMALE:You can buy all new clothes.
OTHERMALE:Is everything a trip to the mall for you, Becky? Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be good for her.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it's something she's always wanted.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? You know you always wanted perky ones.
SUPFEMALE:You try walking around with your shoulders hunched over and your back up in knots.
SUPFEMALE:Then we'll talk about why I'm really doing this.
LEADFEMALE:So you are doing it? Well Come on, girls.
OTHERMALE:Let's get a pizza.
LEADMALE:Come on, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Why are we leaving? This affects all of us.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you went on solid foods, they ceased to be any concern of yours.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Darlene.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:I'm going to make a sandwich.
LEADMALE:Want one? No, I want you to talk to me about this.
LEADMALE:It's your decision, honey.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Tell me how you feel.
LEADMALE:I don't know how I feel.
LEADMALE:I'm sitting, waiting for dinner, and you say you're getting your breasts reduced.
SUPFEMALE:How am I suppose to feel? I mean, is this the only way? Have you tried everything else? It's got to be surgery? What's bothering you about the surgery? You afraid of how I'll look? Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:You afraid of the money, 'cause insur-No, it's not the money.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then what is it? What was the first one again? I was worried about I'd look, but then I saw these pictures of how you look after, I would just look normal.
LEADMALE:I don't want you looking normal.
LEADMALE:I like you the way you are.
LEADMALE:I should've said it was the money.
LEADMALE:No, I asked how you felt.
LEADMALE:You told me.
LEADMALE:Am I the big pig now 'cause that bothers me? No.
LEADFEMALE:It bothered me, too.
LEADFEMALE:You really think this will make you feel better? Yeah, I really think I do.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll have to deal with it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you know, I'm not going to change or anything.
LEADFEMALE:I'll still be the same woman you married.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just be in less pain, so I won't be grumpy and whiny all the time.
OTHERMALE:O.
SUPMALE:k.
OTHERMALE:, so I won't exactly be the same woman you married.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in, Rose.
SUPFEMALE:Is anybody in there hooked up to tubes or machines or hoses? No.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, 'cause I don't care for that.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, this ain't bad.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Hospital rooms give me the creeps.
SUPMALE:Every time we check out of one we got a new kid.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, what's that smell? My nose is burning.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's the clean, Dan.
LEADMALE:No kidding.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Don't go getting used to it now.
LEADMALE:Well, for your dining pleasure this evening, We are serving "clear beef bouillon Or chicken bouillon," Which the chef informs me is also clear.
SUPMALE:Is that it? If you still have room, Our dessert tray consists of A shimmering brick of green jell-o and the tray itself.
LEADMALE:Do me a favor? Go down the hall and drag that snack machine in here.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not supposed to eat before the surgery.
LEADFEMALE:I'll only lick the salt off the fritos.
LEADFEMALE:You can eat them.
LEADMALE:How long are visiting hours? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Stay and keep me company.
LEADMALE:O.
OTHERFEMALE:k.
LEADMALE:Sports channel.
LEADMALE:Dan, I've got a private room.
OTHERMALE:Good deal.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want to fool around? In the hospital? Look.
SUPFEMALE:The bed goes up and down.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't have to do nothing.
LEADMALE:I don't think so.
SUPMALE:Aw Are you o.
LEADFEMALE:k.
SUPMALE:with this? Why worry about me? Are you o.
LEADMALE:k.
SUPFEMALE:? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Then me, too.
OTHERMALE:You sure? I'm with you all the way-When they wheel you down, when it's over.
LEADFEMALE:While it's happening I'll be far away liquored up.
LEADMALE:Knock, knock.
LEADMALE:Am I interrupting? No, it's o.
LEADFEMALE:k.
SUPFEMALE:Surprise! Surprise! For they were jolly good fellows For they were jolly good fellows For they were jolly good fellows Which nobody can deny Ooh--ooh! Whoo! Oh, look it! A boob cake! Where did you get that? I saw it in good housekeeping.
LEADMALE:It was for a kitty-cat face.
SUPFEMALE:I trimmed the ears and doubled the recipe.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am I leaving.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be here first thing in the morning.
OTHERFEMALE:So will I.
LEADFEMALE:No cake for her.
LEADMALE:He seems to be doing better.
SUPMALE:Well, it would be easier if he was a leg man.
LEADMALE:You know Dan tells everybody the first thing he noticed about you was your eyes.
LEADMALE:Men have to say that, Crystal.
SUPMALE:It's the law.
OTHERMALE:Mmm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:You know they're lying.
SUPMALE:All they think about are our chests.
LEADFEMALE:At least every guy I ever went out with.
SUPMALE:One article said one reason men are so obsessed with breasts is that they represent security and nurturing And--and motherhood.
LEADMALE:Ohh! That's why they call them hooters.
LEADMALE:Or as my fellow truckers like to say, bumpers headlights and then the ever flattering airbags.
SUPMALE:Then there's your fruits and vegetables, right? Coconuts, mangoes pineapples sweet potatoes the entire melon family.
LEADFEMALE:and don't forget a nice pair.
OTHERFEMALE:They have the nerve to say they love you for your brain.
OTHERMALE:Which can't be true, because they've only got one word for brain.
SUPFEMALE:If that was true, all those bars would be having wet hat contests.
OTHERMALE:Well, we brought you a present, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Goody, goody.
LEADMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gimme it.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
