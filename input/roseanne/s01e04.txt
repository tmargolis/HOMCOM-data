LEADFEMALE:gosh, you simply must come over more often, sis! well, dan really went off the deep end.
SUPMALE:oh, you think so? he just lost a job.
SUPFEMALE:that was the phone call he was waiting for.
LEADMALE:oh.
SUPMALE:i don't know how you do it.

OTHERFEMALE:you're strict with me and becky, but you let d.j. get away with murder.
LEADFEMALE:darlene, who are you really mad at? d.j. yeah, well that makes a lot of sense.
SUPFEMALE:if i'd screwed around all semester and was flunking history, i'd be looking for somebody else to blame it on too.
