LEADFEMALE:HEY, IT'S MY LIFE.
OTHERFEMALE:WHY DON'T YOU JUST BUTT OUT? WE'RE TRYING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
OTHERMALE:YOU GUYS ARE REAL HYPOCRITES, YOU KNOW THAT? I MEAN YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING HOW YOU'RE THE COOLEST, HIPPEST, MOST WITH IT PARENTS, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

OTHERFEMALE:WHO DO WE WANT TO BE? WELL, I WANT TO BE THE KIND OF PARENT YOU KNOW, THAT CAN TRUST OUR KIDS.
SUPMALE:OH, WE WANT TO BE THE KIND OF PARENTS THAT CAN LOOK A KID DRESSED LIKE JOHNNY SWANKO AND NOT THINK THAT HE'S ONLY GOT ONE THING ON HIS FILTHY LITTLE MIND AND WE BOTH GOT A PRETTY GOOD SUSPICION OF WHAT THAT ONE THING IS.
SUPMALE:YEAH, WELL YOU WERE KIND OF A PUNK, AND I WAS PRETTY INNOCENT WHEN WE WENT OUT ON OUR FIRST DATE, REMEMBER? YOU SURE DID.
