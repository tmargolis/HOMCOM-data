LEADMALE:Mom, what are you still doing here? Jackie's helping me finish my new puzzle.
SUPMALE:Look, Roseanne, marbles.

LEADMALE:Well, why don't you guys take all your marbles there And move them off the table, 'cause we're going to eat dinner.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't be a party pooper, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:We can just eat around the puzzle.
LEADFEMALE:It'll make dinner more fun.
LEADMALE:Don't make me do this.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne, you wouldn't! It's getting heavy.
LEADMALE:So you had a bad day.
LEADFEMALE:That is no excuse to take it out on me.
SUPFEMALE:When life gives me lemons, I make lemonade.
SUPFEMALE:But when life gives you lemons Sourpuss, sourpuss, sourpuss! What's her problem lately? You think you've got it bad? Try living with the woman.
LEADFEMALE:I came over here to get away from her.
LEADMALE:She followed me.
SUPFEMALE:I swear to god, she's sucking the very life right out of me.
LEADFEMALE:Just a matter of time.
LEADMALE:Everybody in the retirement village got to know her.
LEADMALE:Now they're sending her back to us.
SUPFEMALE:Well, can't she make any friends over there? I mean, don't they have, like, one deaf person Strapped down to something there? We have got to do something soon.
LEADMALE:She is undoing a lot of expensive therapy.

LEADMALE:But I want you to promise me you won't tell mom and dad what David said.
LEADMALE:Well, if it's not true, then why shouldn't I tell them? There's a couple ways we can deal with this.
LEADMALE:I could grab you by the ears And bang your head against the wall, Which is getting a little old.
LEADFEMALE:Or, for the first time in your life, you can act like an adult, Which is not going to be easy with that haircut.
OTHERMALE:I won't tell.
