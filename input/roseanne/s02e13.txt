SUPMALE:BECKY, PLATE.
LEADMALE:HONEY? FEELING A LITTLE TENSE, IRRITABLE, PECKISH? MAYBE IT'S YOUR HAIR COLOR.
LEADMALE:MAYBE IT'S MY JOB.
SUPFEMALE:MAYBE YOU SHOULD QUIT THAT JOB.
LEADFEMALE:AND DO WHAT? ALL THE POWER JOBS ARE TAKEN.
LEADFEMALE:MARGARET'S RUNNING ENGLAND, VANNA'S TURNIN' THE LETTERS OVER, AND DELTA BURKE HAS HER OWN DAMN TV SHOW.
LEADFEMALE:ARE YOU GONNA BE LATE TONIGHT? NO.
LEADFEMALE:I ONLY GOT A HALF DAY'S WORTH OF FINISHING WORK TO DO.

LEADMALE:Manager: NOW SO FAR, THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT WE'VE HAD IS SPEED-PEOPLE WAITING NOW, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE FAST FOOD, PEOPLE, AND WE CAN'T EXACTLY CALL IT FAST.
SUPMALE:WHY NOT? WE CALL IT FOOD.
LEADMALE:LOOK THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT SOME OF YOU ARE JUST NOT PLAYING TO CAPACITY WHICH MEANS I'VE HAD TO DO SOME PLATOONING AND JUGGLE THE SCHEDULE A BIT.
OTHERMALE:SO, JAY, WEDNESDAYS AND FRIDAYS, YOU'RE ON NIGHTS.

LEADFEMALE:THIS IS NOWHERE.
OTHERFEMALE:I DON'T LIKE WORKING WEEKENDS, EITHER.
LEADMALE:I KNOW, AND THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER DO.
LEADMALE:YOU JUST SIT UP THERE IN YOUR OFFICE LIKE A LITTLE CHICKEN NAPOLEON, MAKING YOUR LITTLE CHICKEN SCHEDULES THAT SCREW UP EVERYBODY'S LIFE.
LEADMALE:I TOLD YOU IN THE BEGINNING I WAS NOT WORKIN' WEEKENDS.
LEADFEMALE:YOU ARE PAID TO FOLLOW MY ORDERS.
SUPFEMALE:NOW, IT ISN'T ALWAYS PRETTY, BUT THIS IS THE BUSINESS WE'VE CHOSEN.
LEADMALE:YOU GOT A BIG BOOGER HANGIN' OUT OF YOUR NOSE.
LEADFEMALE:IS THIS MOISTURIZER ANY GOOD? EVERYTHING I GOT IS GOOD.

LEADMALE:HEY, I'M NOT KISSING UP TO SOME DWEEBY LITTLE KID JUST 'CAUSE HE HOLDS MY LIFE IN HIS HANDS.
LEADFEMALE:YOU DON'T HAVE TO KISS UP TO HIM.
LEADMALE:JUST TREAT HIM A LITTLE BETTER.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT.
OTHERFEMALE:YEAH, LIKE NOT CALLING HIM "THE LITTLE MAGGOT.
LEADMALE:" BELIEVE ME, ROSEANNE, I WOULDN'T BE WHERE I AM TODAY IF I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE PEOPLE.
LEADMALE:TRUTH IS, ROSEANNE, YOU COULD USE SOME WORK ON YOUR INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
SUPMALE:STICK IT.
SUPFEMALE:SHE'S AN EXPERT ON INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
LEADMALE:SHE'S RAISING 3 KIDS.
LEADFEMALE:JUST IMAGINE BRIAN AS ONE OF YOUR KIDS.

LEADFEMALE:WELL, WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT ME NOW.
SUPFEMALE:YOU KNOW BRIAN? THE LITTLE MAGGOT? HE'S GONNA MAKE ME WORK WEEKENDS.
SUPMALE:WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM YOU COULDN'T? OH, GEE, NOW, WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT? WE WERE JUST SUGGESTING THAT SHE USE HER NATURAL ABILITIES AND SUCK UP TO THE GUY.
LEADFEMALE:YOU CATCH MORE FLIES WITH HONEY THAN WITH VINEGAR.
LEADFEMALE:OH, A MEETING OF MINDS.
SUPMALE:THAT'S GOOD ADVICE, ROSEANNE.
SUPFEMALE:THAT'S HOW CAREERS ARE MADE.
SUPFEMALE:JUST TREAT THE GUY LIKE YOU RESPECT HIM AND, UH, ACT LIKE YOU THINK HE'S GREAT, AND KEEP YOUR REAL FEELINGS TO YOURSELF.
SUPMALE:OH, YOU MEAN, UH, I SHOULD TREAT HIM LIKE HE'S MY HUSBAND? BINGO.
LEADFEMALE:YOU JUST TREAT HIM LIKE YOU TREAT ME, AND I GUARANTEE YOU HE WON'T WANNA BE ANYWHERE NEAR YOU ON WEEKENDS.
OTHERFEMALE:I DON'T KNOW.

LEADMALE:DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT'S LOW-CHOLESTEROL? NAPKINS.
LEADFEMALE:ALL RIGHT.
SUPMALE:I'LL TAKE THE NUMBER 2 DINNER.
LEADFEMALE:NO.
SUPMALE:NUMBER 4.
LEADMALE:NO, WAIT.
SUPMALE:I DON'T KNOW.
SUPFEMALE:DO YOU NEED SOME MORE TIME TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND? YOU KNOW, THAT WAY I COULD GO AHEAD AND WAIT ON THIS GUY BEHIND YOU WHO'S DROOLING ALL OVER YOUR SHOULDER.
LEADFEMALE:YEAH, OK.
LEADFEMALE:NO, I'LL ORDER NOW.
LEADMALE:YEAH.
SUPFEMALE:OK NO.
LEADMALE:I'LL ORDER NOW.

SUPMALE:THAT'S FOR SURE.
LEADFEMALE:'COURSE, UNLESS YOU'VE GOT A HUSBAND AND 3 KIDS.
OTHERFEMALE:THAT'S FOR SURE.
OTHERMALE:YEAH.
LEADMALE:I GUESS YOU CAN CATCH MORE FLIES WITH MANURE THAN YOU CAN WITH HONEY.
LEADMALE:DAMN IT! WHAT? I CAN'T FASTEN THE CHOKE SPRING! WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU MAKIN'? DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CARBURETORS? THEY GO UNDER THE HOOD.
OTHERMALE:WHY? I'M IN BIG TROUBLE.
SUPMALE:WHAT'S THE MATTER? I'M FLUNKING SHOP.
SUPMALE:WELL, THAT'S A SIGN OF INTELLIGENCE.
LEADMALE:I CAN'T AFFORD TO FLUNK SHOP.

LEADMALE:I THINK YOU'RE GOING WAY OVERBOARD ON THIS DEAL.
SUPMALE:ISN'T IT ENOUGH THAT I HAVE TO REBUILD JUNIOR'S CARBURETOR FOR HIM? ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME? YOU'RE THE ONE THAT TOLD ME TO KISS UP TO THE GUY IN THE FIRST PLACE.
OTHERFEMALE:I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO KISS UP TO HIM.
OTHERMALE:I JUST SAID TREAT HIM RIGHT.
LEADMALE:OH, PLEASE, YOU'VE GOTTA LET ME STICK AROUND AND WATCH THIS.
LEADFEMALE:JACKIE, GO TO WORK.
SUPMALE:AND HE BETTER BRING HIS OWN TOOLS, 'CAUSE HE'S NOT USIN' MINE.

LEADFEMALE:I'M PAYING A MORTGAGE AND PUTTIN' FOOD ON THE TABLE AND BUYING CLOTHES FOR 3 KIDS.
LEADFEMALE:I DON'T THINK YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT.
LEADMALE:I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU'RE NOT, UH, GROWN-UP ENOUGH YET TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR LIFE DOESN'T ALWAYS TURN OUT THE WAY YOU PLAN IT TO BE, AND SOMETIMES YOU END UP DOING STUFF THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER DO IN A MILLION YEARS, BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO DO IT 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO.
LEADMALE:OH, YOU DON'T WANNA LEAVE WITHOUT YOUR CARBURETOR AND YOUR COIL SPRING.

LEADMALE:I PITY HIM.
OTHERFEMALE:WELL YOU'LL DEFINITELY HAVE MORE TIME TO SPEND WITH YOUR FAMILY NOW.
SUPFEMALE:COZY EVENINGS AROUND THE HEARTH SING-ALONGS.
SUPMALE:IT'LL BE LOADS OF FUN.
SUPMALE:HMM.
LEADMALE:YEAH, TILL WE HAVE TO BREAK DOWN AND EAT ONE OF THE CHILDREN.
