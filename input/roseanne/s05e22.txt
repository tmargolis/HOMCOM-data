OTHERMALE:What do you mean "pushing you"? Well, Darlene, you just sprang this on me.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we were just going to the prom.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you weren't gonna try to have sex with me tonight? Yes, I was, but then I would have been the one who started it.

OTHERMALE:Maybe you just don't wanna do it with me.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:I'm just-I'm really scared.
SUPMALE:I just always figured that when we did do it, That you really wouldn't want to And that you'd just be doing it for me, So then, I wouldn't have to be good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I just wanted to be with you.
LEADFEMALE:I never expected you to be good.
OTHERMALE:I just can't see how this is happening.
SUPMALE:My mom probably put something in the food.
