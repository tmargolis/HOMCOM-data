LEADMALE:bECKY: mom, we're watching shock theatre.
LEADMALE:dad said it's really scary.
LEADFEMALE:maybe we can turn out the lights and burn some candles.
LEADFEMALE:you want the neighbors to find out we're devil worshippers? dad said i could watch shock theater.
LEADMALE:oh, he did, did he? me and my man are gonna get shocked.
LEADFEMALE:over my dead body.
OTHERFEMALE:before the night is over, we'll be up to our necks in dead bodies.
LEADMALE:d.j. , you don't want to watch all that scary stuff.
LEADMALE:that'll give you nightmares.
LEADFEMALE:no, it won't.
OTHERFEMALE:well, they give me nightmares.
LEADFEMALE:hey dad, we gonna work on the boat tomorrow? you bet.
LEADFEMALE:i figure we can put in a couple of ribs, and get 'em sanded down real good.
LEADMALE:gee, i only wish you were as interested in your homework as you are in working on that damn boat.
OTHERFEMALE:hey, i do my homework.
OTHERMALE:get off my back! i got dibs on the couch.
LEADFEMALE:you're not hogging the whole thing, lard butt.
SUPFEMALE:bECKY: hey deej, can i have the salt? hey, you.
LEADFEMALE:who, me? yeah.
LEADMALE:what do you think you're doing, letting him stay up late to watch all this trash? honey, this is classic trash.
LEADFEMALE:besides, i wasn't that much older than the lad there when i saw my first shocker.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, and look what happened to you.
OTHERFEMALE:knock it off, count.
LEADMALE:besides, i'm gonna be sitting next to him the whole time.
SUPFEMALE:he's probably gonna fall asleep before the first commercial.
OTHERMALE:what are you worried about? i'm worried he's gonna be sleeping between us for the next two weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:it's starting, dad.
LEADFEMALE:come on, we need you.
SUPMALE:d.j. , wake up, it's starting.
LEADMALE:sorry, babe, kids want vampires.
SUPFEMALE:mob rules.
LEADMALE:instead of watching the thing that wouldn't die, on the thing that wouldn't die, why don't we all do something together? we are doing something together.
OTHERFEMALE:i wonder what people did before television.
LEADFEMALE:they made dolls out of corn cobs, and stared at fire.
SUPFEMALE:dARLENE: mom? what's the matter? i don't feel so good.
LEADFEMALE:what's wrong? i don't know.
SUPFEMALE:you have a headache? no.
LEADFEMALE:or a stomach ache? no.
SUPFEMALE:you worried about making the mortgage payment? no.
OTHERFEMALE:come here.
LEADMALE:well, you don't have a fever, so i guess you're not gonna perish in the night.
SUPFEMALE:i just can't get back to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:did you have a nightmare? maybe.
LEADMALE:was it in turn-ofthe-century vienna? no.
OTHERMALE:what was it about? i can't remember.
SUPMALE:darlene, don't you think you're a little old for this? i don't want to go back to my room.
LEADFEMALE:can't i stay here, just for a little while? just until i fall asleep? oh, you don't want to sleep here, honey.
OTHERMALE:trust me.
LEADMALE:daddy doesn't even like sharing the bed with me.
OTHERFEMALE:oh, i know.
LEADFEMALE:i got a better idea.
LEADFEMALE:come on, i'll take you back up to your room.
LEADMALE:dan? yeah.
LEADFEMALE:remember how you said you'd be responsible for whatever happened tonight? uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:darlene's up, and she can't go back to sleep.
OTHERMALE:so all you gotta do is take her back up to her room and get her a drink of water.
OTHERFEMALE:tuck her in and make sure she gets back to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:okay.
SUPMALE:all right, honey, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:let's go.
LEADFEMALE:i don't think i can fall asleep.
LEADFEMALE:you want me to tell you the story about how i met daddy? that might do it.
SUPMALE:can't i sleep on the couch? no.
SUPMALE:darlene, your nightmare's not gonna come back.
LEADFEMALE:and even if it does, you know where to find me.
LEADFEMALE:i'm in the book.
LEADFEMALE:i don't wanna fall asleep.
LEADMALE:tell me what you dreamt about, honey.
LEADMALE:you might feel better if you talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:it was scary.
OTHERFEMALE:dreams are nothing to be afraid of.
LEADMALE:it's just when you're asleep, there's this part of your brain that just sits around telling stories.
OTHERMALE:you mean like grandpa? tell me what you dreamt.
LEADMALE:no, forget about it.
LEADMALE:i don't want to.
SUPFEMALE:are you okay, honey? i guess.
LEADMALE:sure you are.
LEADMALE:you just lay here and close your eyes, and you'll be asleep in no time.
OTHERMALE:mom! what? nothing.
LEADMALE:do you want me to stay here with you for awhile? okay, move over.
LEADMALE:okay, lift up your head here.
LEADFEMALE:close your eyes.
SUPMALE:give me this damn thing.
LEADFEMALE:okay.
LEADMALE:so it was the spring of 1971.
LEADFEMALE:and i'm coming out of school, and there's this like really great-looking guy standing there, you know.
LEADFEMALE:and he's wearing this really cool varsity jacket and everything.
LEADFEMALE:and he's cussing out his motorcycle, you know, 'cause it wouldn't start.
LEADMALE:so i go over there and darlene? then what happened? nothing.
SUPMALE:go back to sleep! bECKY: do you know what the absolute most grossinating part of the movie was? no, but i got a feeling i'm gonna find out.
LEADFEMALE:definitely when the vampire threw up after eating the judge.
LEADMALE:i'm trying to eat breakfast! would you shut up about the stupid movie? what is your problem? your face.
LEADMALE:what's with her? she had a rough night.
LEADFEMALE:whoo! great morning, huh? shut up.
SUPMALE:i can't wait for aunt jackie to get her to do my hair.
SUPMALE:can i watch? just stay out of the way.
LEADMALE:how come you're still in your nightgown? i'm waiting to go to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:didn't you sleep last night? no.
LEADFEMALE:i slept great.
SUPMALE:i bet you did.
LEADMALE:you had that great, big bed all to yourself.
LEADFEMALE:where were you? i was upstairs ghostbusting.
LEADFEMALE:oh, babe, you should have woke me up.
LEADFEMALE:well, why didn't i think of that? d.j. have a nightmare? i don't know, i was too busy dealing with darlene's.
OTHERMALE:darlene had a nightmare? that's what she said, but it just seems like something else was going on.
LEADFEMALE:why does it have to be something else? kids have nightmares.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, and i bet watching schlock theater didn't help.
LEADFEMALE:hey, i once had a nightmare for an entire month.
OTHERMALE:it was the single most frighteninggod, when i think of it even now.
LEADMALE:i used to have this cup.
OTHERMALE:and on the side of the cup was a decal of an airplane.
OTHERFEMALE:and every time i started to take a drink, the top of the cup would touch my nose and the propellers would start up, and the airplane would get going, and i swear this is true, it flew right up my nose.
LEADFEMALE:you're scary.
LEADFEMALE:i know it doesn't sound like much now, but you didn't see the size of the propellers.
LEADMALE:dan, this is no ordinary airplane-up-the-nose nightmare.
LEADFEMALE:this is darlene.
LEADMALE:when was the last time she didn't make it through the night? and she refused to go back to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:i was up there all night with her.
SUPMALE:hey, big d.
LEADFEMALE:hi, dad.
SUPFEMALE:what time's your basketball game? 1:30.
LEADMALE:great.
OTHERMALE:we can put in a couple of hours on the boat.
LEADMALE:bECKY: d.j. , they're not in there! i don't want to work on the boat today, okay, dad? mom? yeah, honey? ibECKY: d.j. ! hey, baby, i can't fit a rib without my master carpenter.
LEADMALE:not today, okay, dad? mom? what, honey? will you tell d.j. to stop bothering me? he spilled my makeup all over the bathroom.
LEADMALE:yeah, i'll be there in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:no, mother, now.
LEADMALE:i've got to get ready for my date tonight.
SUPFEMALE:mom, this is very important.
SUPFEMALE:oh, honey, i'll be right back in a minute.
LEADMALE:honey, listen to your weatherbeaten old skipper of a father.
SUPMALE:nightmares can really depress you.
LEADMALE:i know, 'cause when i was a kid, and i shudder even thinking of this now, i had a recurring nightmare.
SUPFEMALE:and it happened in broad daylight.
LEADMALE:the most terrifying dreams can happen during the daytime.
LEADMALE:did you know that? because they're so real.
OTHERFEMALE:this one was a beaut.
LEADMALE:i used to have this little cupan airplane flew up his nose.
SUPFEMALE:you don't want to hear it.
LEADMALE:i was just trying to explain to the child that i know how terrifying nightmares can be.
SUPMALE:can everybody shut up about nightmares? i didn't have a nightmare.
LEADMALE:then why'd you have trouble going to sleep? are you worried about your basketball game? no, i wasn't worried about my basketball game.
LEADFEMALE:did you screw up in history again, darlene? no, i didn't screw up in history again.
SUPMALE:then what is the matter? i got my period, okay?! hi, sis.
LEADMALE:hey, jackie.
LEADMALE:welcome to you wash, we pay laundromat.
LEADMALE:you think the only reason i come over here is to do my laundry? no, i think you come over for the free coffee too.
LEADMALE:get outta here! hidden scent.
LEADMALE:all right, what do you guys think of this outfit to go rollerskating in? i think that that would look great with your hair swept up.
LEADFEMALE:yeah.
SUPFEMALE:chip loves my hair like that.
SUPMALE:well, not too up though 'cause i don't want nobody mistaking you for some kind of cocktail waitress.
LEADMALE:mom so, what's new? darlene got her period last night.
LEADFEMALE:you're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:she's only 11.
SUPMALE:well, i was only 11.
OTHERFEMALE:yeah, but you were already wearing a "d" cup.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, two of 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:jACKIE: so, i guess she's pretty upset, huh? yeah, and i wish she'd talk to me about it.
SUPMALE:give her some time.
LEADFEMALE:poor kid's just been sentenced to 35 years of monthly inconvenience.
LEADFEMALE:well, gee, jackie, i only hope i can find a way to impart that enlightened viewpoint onto my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:you will.
LEADMALE:just tell her about all these famous athletic women types and how they all get their periods too.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, why didn't i think of that? well, no matter what you tell her, it's gonna be better than the way mom handled it.
LEADMALE:remember she told us if we had any questions to feel free to ask the school nurse.
LEADFEMALE:right? so whatwhat aboutshe brought pamphlets home from the red cross.
LEADFEMALE:for two weeks i thought what i had was a national disaster.
LEADFEMALE:well, to mom, it was.
SUPMALE:when i got mine, she cried for three days about how she'd lost her little baby.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, well you had it easy, sis.
LEADMALE:'cause i had to break that woman in.
LEADMALE:she was a basket case.
LEADMALE:she almost ruined the whole thing for me.
SUPMALE:you were so weird.
SUPFEMALE:it's like you were looking forward to it.
SUPFEMALE:yeah, i was finally doing something that mom couldn't control.
OTHERMALE:besides, it meant i wasn't gonna get any more nancy drew books for my birthday.
SUPMALE:i was just trying to find a cure for it.
OTHERMALE:it's not a disease.
LEADMALE:i know it's not.
LEADMALE:but it felt like it.
SUPFEMALE:i thought i couldn't go swimming anymore, and i couldn't horse around with the boys anymore like i used to.
SUPMALE:i bet that's exactly the way darlene feels right now.
OTHERFEMALE:yeah, i bet it is too.
LEADMALE:i wish there was some way to tell her, even if she doesn't feel like it now, this is really something to celebrate.
LEADMALE:uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:she's finally becoming a full-fledged member of the woman race.
OTHERFEMALE:and here comes our newest member.
OTHERFEMALE:hi, aunt jackie.
LEADMALE:hi, honey.
SUPFEMALE:how you feeling? god, mom, you have to tell the whole world? jackie, does the phrase "timing is everything" ring a bell here? oh, i'm sorry.

LEADMALE:oh, yeah, i was gonna say something.
LEADFEMALE:and uh, sometimes saying something, as far as your father is concerned isn't the easiest thing in the world.

SUPMALE:all i know is i'm not shaving my legs and wearing pantyhose like becky.
SUPMALE:you think i make becky put on make-up and wear perfume? no.
LEADFEMALE:no, she does it 'cause she's always liked that kind of stuff.
LEADFEMALE:that's the kind of woman she wants to be.
LEADFEMALE:well, that's not the kind of woman i want to be.
OTHERFEMALE:then what are you throwing all your stuff away for? these are a girl's things, darlene, as long as a girl uses 'em.
LEADFEMALE:you love all this stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:that's reason enough to keep it.
