OTHERMALE:Nancy's Sharon? No, Herb Sharon over on Elm Street.
LEADFEMALE:After I drop you off, I run over there for a quickie.

OTHERFEMALE:My god, you got kissed by a woman? No wonder you're upset.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, i'm not upset about that.
LEADMALE:I'm just upset about Nancy, you know.
SUPMALE:I mean, this could devastate her.
SUPFEMALE:This is unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't even know how i'm gonna tell her.
LEADMALE:You got kissed, and all I got Was a couple of women asking if they could touch my stomach.
LEADMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:Did you have fun last night? Why? What'd you hear? Well, you left so early, I had to hitch a ride with Leon And some accountant with pierced nipples.
LEADMALE:Hey, uh I have to tell you something, And--and you're probably gonna get really upset, you know, But I figure, if I was you, well, i'd want to know.
LEADMALE:Uh, last night, Sharonkissed me.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:She told me.
SUPMALE:Oh, she did? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:She just thought you were real cute, And she wanted to kiss you, so she did.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't she a riot? Oh, so you're not, like, upset or anything.
SUPMALE:No, I think it's funny.
LEADMALE:Why, did it bother you? Well, no.
SUPFEMALE:No, it didn't bother me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I-I pretty much knew It was funny, you know.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
SUPMALE:When sharon told me she kissed you, I told her there might be a chance That you might freak out.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, freaked out? I'm not freaking out.
LEADFEMALE:Why would I freak out? Well, you know, maybe-Maybe you liked the kiss just a little.
SUPFEMALE:What? That is the most ridic-What? Well, it's not that unusual.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, sexuality isn't all black and white.
LEADMALE:There's a whole gray area.
SUPFEMALE:I know about the gray area.
LEADFEMALE:And you're afraid that just one little tiny percent of you Might have been turned on by a woman.
OTHERMALE:That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.
OTHERFEMALE:I am not afraid of any, uh, small percentage Of my gayness inside, you know what I mean? I--I am totally okay About whether I-i'm, like, 3Or lower.
LEADMALE:This is exactly why I didn't want to invite you In the first place, Roseanne, Because you are a total hypocrite.
SUPMALE:I am not a hypocrite.
LEADMALE:A hypocrite doesn't go to a gay bar And teach 40 gay people how to do the monkey.
SUPMALE:Oh, and we're supposed to admire you Because you went to a gay bar? I'm supposed to think you're cool Because you have gay friends? I don't care if you think i'm cool at all Because I know that I am cool, baby.
LEADMALE:I'm probably the coolest chick you ever met.
LEADFEMALE:And for your information, I have friends that are way gayer than you.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, son? Was there something you wanted? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Mom said she went dancing last night With other women.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that wrong? No, son.
LEADFEMALE:It's perfectly fine.
LEADFEMALE:And anyone that tries to tell you different is wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean you dance with other men? Yes, I do.
SUPMALE:Really? No.
OTHERMALE:Never.
LEADFEMALE:Not once.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't want to, either.
LEADMALE:That's your choice.
LEADFEMALE:Hallelujah.
SUPFEMALE:Cleaning again? Boy, if sharon had slipped you the tongue, We might actually get this place up to code.
LEADMALE:No wonder women don't find you attractive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, is that so awful that the kiss freaked you out? You're just not as cool as you thought.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, i'm not cool? You're the one sitting there at the bar Telling everybody you're from pbs doing research.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:If you don't have a problem with what happened, Why are you upset? Well, okay, Jackie, if you really have to know, Uh, well, at first, you know, I--I thought that I was upset for Nancy, And then I kind of realized that that was just denial.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really upset About Dan.
SUPMALE:Dan? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:'cause remember in 11th grade, When that Jimmy Mcquirter kissed me, you know, And Dan felt all threatened and everything, And he beat the crap out of him? Oh, so you're worried that Dan's gonna beat up Sharon.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:'cause Dan would feel threatened by Sharon.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:'cause you and Sharon might buh-huh-hoo-woo-woo! Of course not! I am not gay! I didn't mean for that to sound like it was bad or anything, you know, Because if I was gay, that'd be just fine, but i'm not gay.
LEADMALE:So I just don't like people calling me things that i'm not, Like a hypocrite, or gay, you know, Because i'm not.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't like anybody calling me, like, uh An astronaut, Because it's fine to be an astronaut, But see, I am not an astronaut.
LEADFEMALE:So I'm not gonna admit I was wrong or anything, But I just don't want to fight with you anymore, So I was wrong.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm still pretty cool, you know For a 41-year-old mother of three That lives in Lanford, Illinois.
SUPFEMALE:I like that snoopy dog dog.
SUPFEMALE:It's not like you have to be cool To be my friend, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:I mean, i'm not comfortable With everything about you, either.
LEADMALE:Every time I think about you and Dan in bed, ecch.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Join the club.
LEADMALE:Wow.
OTHERFEMALE:That was--wow.
LEADFEMALE:I'd give you a standing ovation, But I can't feel my legs.
OTHERFEMALE:What got into you? I don't know.
SUPMALE:You're just so manly.
LEADMALE:I am so turned on by your masculinity.
LEADMALE:How'd you get so macho? Step class.
LEADMALE:Well, now that I got you Feeling all relaxed and confident and everything, There's something I want to tell you, But i'm afraid it's gonna upset you.
