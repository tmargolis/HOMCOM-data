LEADFEMALE: Hey, I'm home.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Darlene.
SUPMALE:** Hello? Isn't anybody home? I'm right here! Mom? Dad? d.j. ! What? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I guess that means I get the TV all to myself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, golf.
LEADMALE:I was watchin' that! Hm, that's odd.
SUPMALE:I'm all alone, yet I distinctly smell foul breath.
SUPFEMALE:That's 'cause I'm right here! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, d.j. I didn't see ya.
LEADFEMALE:But then I do have troll blindness.
LEADMALE:For God's sakes, breathe through your nose.
OTHERMALE:Mom and Dad are planning something for you, and I know what it is.
OTHERFEMALE:Oo, must be really important, if they told the dog.
LEADFEMALE:I heard Mom and Dad talking.
LEADMALE:'Cause of the new baby, they're gonna cut your allowance, from $100 a month to 50.
SUPFEMALE:No way! That baby's not gonna cost $50 a month! I mean, it's gonna get all its food free, from Elsie in there.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you're nailed.
OTHERMALE:And you can't do anything about it.
SUPMALE:Ha! Oh, d.j. d.j. Young, foolish d.j. You see, Roseanne and Dan are like a VCR.
LEADMALE:They just flash zero until you program them.
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Darlene.
OTHERMALE:Welcome home.
SUPFEMALE:Is, uh, Dad here? Dad! What? Yeah, he's here.
SUPMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:I wanna talk to you guys.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Darlene.
SUPMALE:What? Well, actually, we wanna talk to you, too.
SUPMALE:Right, Dan? Well, me first.
LEADMALE:Well We shoulda knew somethin' bad like this'd happen, what with her movin' up to the big city.
LEADMALE:Just tell us the boy's name, and I'll get the shotgun, and your maw will rustle up a preacher.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, I've been thinking.
LEADMALE:I know you guys have this new baby on the way, and that's gotta be really expensive.
SUPFEMALE:So I was thinking you could send me less money every month.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you've got to pardon us for being a little shocked.
SUPFEMALE:This is your first act of kindness.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, Dan.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:She's always been very generous.
SUPFEMALE:Remember when she called up Jerry Lewis, and pledged $100,000? So what do you say we cut my allowance fro $100 a month to-Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Say-No, no.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna argue about this.
SUPFEMALE:This is what I wanna do.
OTHERFEMALE:That'd be good, but-you know what would be even better--? Now, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:This is so sweet of her.
LEADMALE:Well, I just figured the baby needs it more than I do.
SUPMALE:Now what'd you guys wanna ask me? Well, um-You know that, uh-Berlin Wall, comin' down? What was that all about? See ya.
LEADMALE:Like taking candy from two very big babies who really like candy.
OTHERFEMALE:'Cept for one thing.
LEADMALE:What? I lied.
LEADFEMALE:They were never gonna cut your money at all.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
SUPMALE:You know what I just said in there? You know, I came in here and I said that? I know.
LEADFEMALE:We can't tell ya how much we appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:But you know, Darlene, I'm feeling so, uh-I don't know what it is.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just, uh-Oh my God.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of you! I'll be in the basement.
LEADMALE:Plotting d.j. 's death.
LEADFEMALE:She fell right into our trap.
LEADMALE:Yeah, she must be slippin'.
SUPMALE:Yay, it worked.
SUPFEMALE:I did everything you said.
OTHERFEMALE:Now where's my 10 bucks? He fell right into our trap.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, he must be slippin'.
SUPMALE:What a gyp! And you wanted smart kids.
LEADFEMALE:** Ha ha ha ha! Come in? Well, someday, maybe they'll invent a receptacle where you can put garbage in.
SUPFEMALE:How are ya doin'? Oh, I'm right where I belong.
LEADMALE:Livin' on Failure St.
OTHERMALE:Two blocks south of Pathetic.
LEADMALE:My zip code? All zeroes.
LEADMALE:Now don't start that again.
LEADFEMALE:Fred's gonna come back to ya.
SUPMALE:I had Dan go over there and talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:And if that doesn't work, then I'll send him back to beat him up.
OTHERMALE:It's not gonna work! Fred left me because I lied to him.
LEADMALE:I went out dancing with another man.
SUPMALE:Well, dancing is not a sin.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't you see Footloose? Well, if he just hadn't of gone, then none of this would have happened.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on.
OTHERMALE:When something goes wrong in a marriage, it's never just one partner's fault.
SUPMALE:You can't just blame yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I-I can't blame Fred.
SUPMALE:Well, fine! Then blame someone else.
LEADMALE:That's what I do! Just make a list of all your problems.
SUPFEMALE:And then another list of everybody you know.
OTHERFEMALE:And then draw lines.
SUPMALE:There's nobody that I can blame! Well, what about the idiot that narked to Fred? We were at the Lobo.
OTHERMALE:Half of Lanford was there.
LEADFEMALE:That coulda been anybody.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's all the better.
LEADFEMALE:More to choose from.
LEADMALE:You know, Mom-did see me and Pete at the Lunch Box.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's perfect.
OTHERMALE:Everyone knows she's pure evil.
LEADMALE:And she gave me one of those looks.
SUPMALE:You know? Like "I'm gonna tell on you!" Well, you didn't tell me that you had hard evidence.
LEADMALE:God, I hate that Mom! It-you know? I do feel better.
SUPFEMALE:See, I told ya.
LEADFEMALE:So how you need to quit mopin' around and get out there and have some fun.
SUPMALE:Although I wouldn't recommend dancin'.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I-I could take Andy to the Bulk Store.
OTHERFEMALE:Thatta girl! Nothing more fun than the Bulk Store! But-now, see? I don't have any clean clothes! Could that somehow be Mom's fault? Damn her! Hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Gosh.
LEADFEMALE:I told the agency I wanted a redhead.
SUPFEMALE:Dan.
SUPMALE:What are we doin'? You're checkin' outta here.
LEADMALE:Roseanne was right.
LEADMALE:This crap has gone on long enough.
LEADFEMALE:You're goin' back to your wife and your kid.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Can't.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? You packed my pants.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Dan, I'm not goin' back.
SUPFEMALE:I'm still too angry.
LEADMALE:I know you are, Fred.
LEADMALE:But it's just gonna get better.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
SUPMALE:You just bury that anger deep down inside, until it becomes a hard ball in the pit of your stomach.
SUPMALE:And then you put food on it.
LEADMALE:No! I'm staying where I am.
LEADMALE:Damn it, Fred! What are you doin' here? I told you to romance her.
OTHERMALE:With the money you spent on this motel, you coulda bought her a-card, or somethin'.
OTHERFEMALE:Dan, I see what this is about, okay? You don't have to worry.
OTHERFEMALE:Roseanne's not gonna know it was you who tipped me off.
OTHERMALE:I told Jackie it wasn't you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you don't have to lie for me.
LEADMALE:I'm not afraid of my wife.
LEADMALE:Oh? Have you remarried? I'm not afraid because I did nothin' wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not the guy who walked out on his family to punish his wife.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! I'm not punishing her! Jackie is a mess.
SUPFEMALE:And she's sittin' home with a kid who doesn't know what happened to his father.
SUPMALE:What do you call that? What do you want from me, Dan? Jackie's the only woman I ever loved! She's the only person I ever trusted, and she betrayed me.
LEADFEMALE:But nothin' happened-Something did happen! She went out with another man.
LEADMALE:I'm losin' her.
LEADMALE:I lose her-I lose everything.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to do.
LEADMALE:What can I do? Jeez, Fred, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I just-I need some time to get my head together.
LEADFEMALE:All right, buddy.
LEADMALE:I'll stay with ya for a while.
LEADFEMALE:Fred? Does this TV get anything besides adult movies? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, hey, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Did I leave Andy's little hat over here? Oh, yeah, well, I'll have to buy you a new one, uh, see, 'cause I ran out of coffee filters.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, have you had a bath? Yeah, I've been getting out, trying to have fun, like you said.
LEADFEMALE:But you still hate Mom.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's very invigorating, you know? It's funny.
LEADFEMALE:You hate somebody your whole life, and then you realize there's so much more.
OTHERMALE:Who do we hate? Who do we hate? Mom.
OTHERMALE:Oh, good.
SUPFEMALE:I hate Bev.
LEADMALE:Can I play? Yeah, we figured out Mom told Fred about me and Pete.
LEADFEMALE:So what do you think we should do to her, Dan? Oh, I don't know.
LEADMALE:Who's to say what I think? Well, I got-Gymboree starts in an hour.
LEADMALE:I got to get him there, build up his little muscles, 'cause next time he pulls on Grandma's earrings, we're gonna do some damage, yes, we are.
LEADMALE:Yes, we are! Oh, she's such a good mother.
LEADMALE:Listen, Roseanne, I didn't want to say this in front of Jackie, but I'm the one that told Fred, not your mom.
SUPFEMALE:Although your mom probably would have if I hadn't.
LEADFEMALE:Man, does she bug me! Well, I should have seen your great-big barbecue-stained fingerprints all over this one.
LEADFEMALE:I was right to do it.
LEADFEMALE:I was right to tell him.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to hear it.
LEADFEMALE:You just go out in the backyard and dig a great-big hole and wait for me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Blame me.
LEADFEMALE:Blame the messenger.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, blame Fred, you know, the guy whose wife lied to him? But whatever you do, don't blame the adulteress.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, she's not an adulteress, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to you? You were on her side before you went over there.
LEADMALE:Then I saw how much Fred was hurting.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not what happened.
SUPFEMALE:You were in a very small space with another man, and you breathed all those man fumes, and then the very tiny part of your brain that can think for itself dissolved.
SUPMALE:Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Hi, Becky.
SUPMALE:Did you get me that, uh, catalog I asked you for? Yeah, and that saw that Dan would like is right here on this page.
LEADMALE:Yep.
SUPMALE:Whoo.
LEADFEMALE:That's gonna make a great gift.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Now all I need is the picture frame.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, well, why don't you sit down? I'll make you a sandwich, and then we can talk.
LEADMALE:Okay, as long as you keep your promise and we don't talk about Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, didn't she just die? Oh, that Jackie.
LEADMALE:Hey, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:Heya, Mark.
LEADMALE:You here to meet Becky? Nah, she's eating with that guy.
SUPMALE:Hey, Becky.
SUPMALE:Hey, Joe.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Who's Joe? Just some guy friend of Becky's.
LEADMALE:They go out all the time: lunch, dinner, dancing.
LEADFEMALE:No biggie.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:And that doesn't bug you.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course not, man.
SUPMALE:I'm secure as a man.
OTHERFEMALE:And my male chauvinistic ego doesn't, uh, need, uh, something or other.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that's funny.
LEADFEMALE:I was recently in a very similar situation.
SUPMALE:You were? I had no idea.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:The only thing was that Jackie lied to me about her guy friend.
SUPFEMALE:Does Becky ever lie to you about this guy? Yeah, of course, all the time.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it'sgood.
LEADMALE:Yeah? How does that make you feel? Uh f-fine.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Conner! Really? Fine? That is so open-minded of you.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it won't bother you to hear that they were holding hands, too.
LEADFEMALE:What? Right up until you came in.
LEADFEMALE:I was a little concerned about it, but I guess I'm not as secure a man as you are.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, get away from my wife, pal.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Were you holding hands with this guy? No.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Fred saw you.
SUPMALE:Hey, I told you, if it isn't written on your hand, don't say it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but nobody said nothing about them touching each other.
SUPMALE:Why don't you go stick your head in the freezer? It's going bad.
SUPFEMALE:You think you and Jackie are gonna get back together? Roseanne, I can't believe that you think that I was dumb enough to fall for that.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't.
SUPMALE:I am trying to break up Becky and Mark.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, hello, diner people.
LEADMALE:Hi, Bev.
OTHERMALE:I can't talk to Bev right now with this Jackie thing going on.
LEADMALE:I'll get rid of her.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mom.
LEADMALE:Thank God you're here.
LEADMALE:Are you sure that Fred wants to talk to me? Yes, absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:I tried to comfort him, but he needs the kind of comforting that only you can give.
LEADMALE:Hello, Fred.
LEADMALE:I was so sorry to hear about you and Jackie.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are you staying? The Green Lantern.
SUPMALE:Oh, my.
SUPFEMALE:That place is filthy.
SUPMALE:But then, considering the kind of housekeeper Jackie is, I suppose you feel right at home.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I guess.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hey, now's not the time to bring up all of Jackie's faults, okay? Next thing I know, you'll start comparing her to, I don't know, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha! And why not? Jackie's father was a cheater, too, and she always took after him.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Bev, cheater is probably too strong a word.
LEADMALE:Oh-ho-ho, really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I mean, Jackie didn't actually do anything with this guy.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:So there's absolutely no reason at all to bring up all the other men she slept with.
SUPMALE:Oh, why waste the time? The list of men she hasn't slept with is shorter.
LEADMALE:Bev, would you mind not criticizing Jackie? After all, she is still my wife.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:And she has obviously cut way back on the men ever since she got married.
OTHERMALE:In my day, that woman would become known as a runabout.
SUPFEMALE:She's not a runabout.
SUPFEMALE:Exactly, Mom.
LEADMALE:And I don't care if she was wearing Charlie-you know, kinda free, kinda wild.
LEADFEMALE:Ohgoodness knows what sort of life Jackie's leading.
LEADMALE:If you ask me, you're too good for her.
LEADMALE:Will you get off Jackie's case? She just made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you two can sit here and argue about my sister, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna listen to one more minute of it.
LEADMALE:And whatever you do, do not tell Fred your theory on how Jackie made ends meet that time she was unemployed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Yeah? Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going? We're going to The Toy Warehouse, and the first toy he finds that he can't break, I'm buying it! No, you got to stay here, 'cause I just left Fred with Mom, and I think he's caving.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:And so, you know, you got to be here in case he comes by or calls or something, unless Mom turns him off women altogether.
SUPFEMALE:I'm--I'm all ready to go.
LEADMALE:Well, come on, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:I went to a lot of trouble catching him.
SUPFEMALE:Now you just got to clean and cook him.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but it's just that ever since he left, I've just been enjoying myself.
SUPMALE:What? Well, I'm--I'm sleeping in the middle of the bed, I'm not shaving my legs, and I get to put pretty clothes on Andy again, and if he turns out gay, we don't care, because I'll march in one of those parades with him.
LEADMALE:So what about Fred? I mean, he's your husband.
LEADMALE:Don't you miss him at all? Not even the you know, cute way he does whatever it is that you thought he did cute? It's scary, Roseanne.
OTHERFEMALE:I just think that I'm happier without him.
LEADMALE:Well, don't you love him anymore? Huh? Don't you? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, great.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you better think about this, because he's Andy's dad.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I know Andy needs him.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Fred.
SUPMALE:Hiya, sport.
LEADFEMALE:How ya doing, buddy? Who is that? Ha ha ha! Hey, Roseanne, can you take Andy in the back for a second? Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Can we talk? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I made a mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:I shouldn't have left.
OTHERMALE:You didn't even let me explain.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:You know.
LEADMALE:I just I needed some time to think.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I did, too.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Jackie, I know you got some problems with the marriage, and I do, too, but the important thing is, we still love each other, right? Right.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:So where were you two off to? Toy Warehouse.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like fun.
OTHERMALE:I'll join you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't--Ahh Let's just-Let's just stay in.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, well, I-I better go, 'cause Darlene hung d.j. up by his feet, and I want to get some film.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thanks for helping out, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, you know, sometimes you, uh, you go sticking your nose in places where it doesn't belong sothings will turn out like this.
LEADMALE:Dad, we need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I used to think, but it turns out, son, we don't.
LEADMALE:I mean it.
SUPMALE:I set up Darlene so you and Mom get to pay her less allowance, but unless you give me I'm gonna tell her.
SUPFEMALE:My, my, what a sly puss.
SUPMALE:Look, she'll start a big fight and ruin her whole time home, and you don't want to start a big fight, do you? Oh, gee, Dan, they're so adorable before the horns and the pointed tail grow in.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Darlene, come on up here! Why do you want to call her up here? It's the only fun we get since they outlawed cockfighting.
SUPMALE:What? Well, uh say, you know that 25 bucks that d.j. scammed you out of? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, that was me and your dad.
OTHERFEMALE:That was our scam.
LEADMALE:We thought of that ourselves.
SUPFEMALE:And d.j. , well, he was nothing but our willing stooge.
LEADFEMALE:So that wasn't your idea at all.
OTHERFEMALE:Nope.
LEADFEMALE:It was all Mom and Dad.
LEADMALE:You were just playing along.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, that's right.
SUPMALE:You teamed up with them, you little snot factory.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, d.j. , for years, we tried to get Darlene to help us scam you, but she'd never do it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she's got principles.
SUPFEMALE:Bad move, d.j. , because they're gonna die way before I do.
LEADMALE:Looks like the two of you got a lot of things to talk over.
LEADMALE:Winner gets this 20.
SUPFEMALE:Someone get a shoebox.
LEADFEMALE:There's gonna be a funeral.
LEADFEMALE:Mom? Have fun, kids.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I'm scared! Perfectly natural.
LEADMALE:Well, so what? We're reaming the kids together again.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean we're okay? You know, Dan, if you weren't around here, I'd really miss you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course.
LEADFEMALE:You'd keep sliding down in the middle where the mattress tips.
LEADMALE:No, I mean it.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I'm really glad that I married you.
OTHERMALE:I know I got me one of the good ones.
LEADFEMALE:Am I dying? Never mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, come here.
SUPFEMALE:What was that for? I don't--You started it.
LEADMALE:Were you holding hands with this guy? No.
SUPMALE:Well, Fred saw you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I told you, if it isn't written on your hand, don't say it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but nobody told nothing, uh, about something with them over there.
SUPFEMALE:I told you, if it is not written on your hand, don't say it.
LEADFEMALE:I never knew something was supposed to be about the touches something or other anyway! God, I'm so embarrassing!
