LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:My husband thanks me in a thousand different ways.
LEADFEMALE:A knowing glance, a gentle touch, It just makes it all worthwhile.
LEADMALE:Mmm, soyasausages.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Another sucker, another 15Â¢.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, now the trick is to aim it right down the center aisle there.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta give it some arm too, 'cause them are two-liter bottles right there.
LEADMALE:And i've been doing this for a while.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys should start small, Like with a cornish game hen or something.
LEADMALE:Now Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Strike! Here's a silly question.
OTHERMALE:Could you stop doing that? I suggest you try Taking your job a little more seriously.
LEADMALE:Try to be more like Jackie here.
LEADFEMALE:Well well well.
LEADMALE:You know, Roseanne, You stand in back of that skillet, And you feel all that heat and all that pressure, and you wonder why.
LEADMALE:And then one day, the clouds part, And the manager throws a little bit of sunshine into your life.
LEADMALE:And then you realize that he's only a grocery-store manager, And all the clouds come back.
LEADMALE:This isn't bad.
LEADFEMALE:Oops, got a fish on the line.
LEADMALE:Not bad? Why, soy is god's gift to arteries.
LEADFEMALE:That's a lovely blazer you're wearing.
LEADFEMALE:That really brings out the color in your eyes.
LEADMALE:Oh well, i'll take three boxes.
LEADMALE:Oh, three? Okay.
OTHERMALE:Hey, that's really a great-looking sweatsuit you got on there.
LEADFEMALE:It kind of matches the rug in my husband's pickup truck.
OTHERFEMALE:What's on the crackers? Oh, well, today we're sampling some delightful aerosol cheese.
SUPFEMALE:It's great, I love it.
LEADFEMALE:I've been eating it all day.
SUPMALE:Just the one day? You're so witty.
LEADFEMALE:How many would you like? This cheese stuff sucks.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna do them.
SUPFEMALE:You picked the cheese.
SUPMALE:That was your choice.
LEADFEMALE:You must be going crazy from the soy fumes.
SUPMALE:You picked the cheese.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay fine, switch.
SUPFEMALE:No biggie.
SUPMALE:I finally found something i'm good at.
LEADMALE:I can sell anything.
SUPFEMALE:I'm crazy Jackie! I must be insane! You know what my advice to you is: Just do the best you can.
LEADMALE:It's not a competition.
SUPMALE:It is now.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hey, kid, get over here and eat some of this.
LEADMALE:It's soy-tastic.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, these are good.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you go and tell your mom To come over here and buy a few boxes from me? Oh, my mom's not here.
SUPMALE:well, do you got any money? no.
LEADFEMALE:Well, get out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, but this is not a cat.
LEADFEMALE:This is an amorphous smear Of existential nothingness.
LEADFEMALE:Oui oui! now let us retire to henri's And speak of revolution! Well come on, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, does this look like a cat to you? d.j. Says it's a cat, it's a cat Recovering from a stroke.
SUPMALE:Made all the more tragic by his having no neck or legs.
OTHERMALE:This is not a cat.
OTHERFEMALE:you're boring me.
SUPMALE:He put zero effort into that.
LEADMALE:He should be home right now redoing it.
LEADMALE:I already told him he could go to the movies.
OTHERMALE:That way when I rent it, he can point out where all the good nudity is.
LEADFEMALE:And then you let him go with Mark, of all people.
SUPMALE:so? so Mark-mark's Mark.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe one of the reasons d.j. 's so lazy about his schoolwork Is that he hangs around with a guy like Mark.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with Mark? I'm just saying that mark's probably not the best role model in the world.
LEADFEMALE:You certainly don't want d.j. Taking after him.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner, i'm trying-No, why wouldn't I want d.j. To be a standup guy Who busts his ass to support himself and his wife? Mr.
SUPMALE:Conner, all i'm saying is that-No, I know what you're saying, David, and I think it stinks.
OTHERFEMALE:Mark may not be einstein, but you know what? He makes the most of what he's got.
LEADMALE:He tries.
SUPMALE:That's more than I can say for some people around here.
LEADFEMALE:Who, me? Wow, smart guys like you catch on real quick.
LEADMALE:Hey, I try.
SUPMALE:No, David.
LEADMALE:You don't try.
LEADFEMALE:You work part-time at a pizza parlor, And you spend the rest of your life sitting on the couch Making ironic comments about everybody else.
LEADMALE:Irony's for people who don't do anything.
SUPFEMALE:You get my drift? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Conner, we're talking about d.j. Yeah, and you know what? The truth is I'd rather have him hang around with Mark than with you.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, i've got work to do.
SUPMALE:Look at me! Look at me! I can barely keep ahead of the demand! Well, try to stay ahead of this demand-Shut up.
SUPFEMALE:It just kills you That I might be better than you at something.
OTHERMALE:Actually, Jackie, there's a lot of things you're better than me at: Finding unavailable men, Setting unreachable goals, And ass-kissing.
LEADFEMALE:What have you got there? Soyasausages-They're not only good tasting, but good for you.
OTHERFEMALE:I haven't eaten any and I feel like crap.
OTHERFEMALE:Cheese in a can, It's really good.
LEADMALE:And because these are made without pork, You'll be tops with your jewish pals.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Yes, cheese in a can.
SUPFEMALE:It's really really good.
OTHERFEMALE:Now that's what's known as marketing, Roseanne, And, man oh man, am I good at it.
LEADFEMALE:You want marketing? I'll show you marketing.
SUPMALE:Attention, shoppers! Try soyasausages.
OTHERMALE:Almost as good as the cheese, But without the spider eggs and hair.
SUPFEMALE:That is not true! Truth has no place in marketing, Jackie.
LEADMALE:And they cure cancer.
OTHERFEMALE:Soyasausages-the food of demons.
OTHERFEMALE:Eat it and go to hell! Yeah, where you'll meet the inventor of cheese in a can! Yeah, nice try, Roseanne.
SUPMALE:Nice try.
OTHERFEMALE:In fact That was just "grrreat.
SUPMALE:" Oh, Jackie.
LEADMALE:You and your silly tricks.
OTHERMALE:But as everyone knows Trix Are for kids! M&m chocolate candies-They melt in your mouth Not in your hand.
LEADMALE:You know, the best part of waking up, Jackie, Is folgers in your cup! Dishwashing liquid.
LEADFEMALE:You're soaking in it! Say it! Say it! Okay, all right! Fine! You're better than me.
LEADMALE:There, madge.
LEADFEMALE:Five years ago-Five years, at uncle wong's, I was handed a fortune that said "someday your hidden talent will be revealed.
LEADFEMALE:" Today that fortune has come true.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations, Jackie.
LEADMALE:You know how to sell cheese.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha! oh Jackie? what? Got milk? Hello, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:How's your day? I see you're really throwing yourself into your work here.
SUPMALE:Very impressive.
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
LEADFEMALE:You mean we don't work here anymore? I don't even think I work here anymore.
LEADFEMALE:That's fine then.
LEADFEMALE:So who do we go see about getting paid? can I give you a hand with that? no, I got it.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, i've been thinking about what you said.
LEADMALE:It really made a lot of sense.
SUPMALE:So i've decided I need a change.
LEADFEMALE:I need a big change, So i'm gonna move out.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I didn't mean to be that hard on you earlier.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, i'm not asking you for an apology.
SUPMALE:I just don't know why the hell you got so upset.
LEADFEMALE:you don't? no.
SUPMALE:You mean in that deep sensitive soul of yours, You can't understand why I might be upset When you rip apart Mark-A guy that doesn't read much-he's not book smart-But who works real hard every day at the Lanford city garage To support his wife and his family? You can't understand why that might not upset me? I think I can.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a little scared to say it now.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Conner, i'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I should not have put Mark down like that, And I certainly didn't mean to put down anyone else.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
SUPMALE:And you're right, I should get off the couch and apply myself more.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's good.
SUPMALE:So are we okay now? Yeah, we're cool.
LEADMALE:You know, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Conner is gonna love this new linoleum.
SUPFEMALE:No no no no.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell her it's new.
SUPFEMALE:See, every couple of years or so She asks me to clean behind the stove, And i've always found that doing this is much easier.
LEADMALE:So, David, what's your time frame? for what? for moving out.
LEADFEMALE:But we just sort of made up and everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well yeah, I know, but you're the one that said you should move out.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah well, I just said that So that you could talk me out of it.
LEADMALE:I think we're just holding you back by letting you live here.
LEADFEMALE:oh, no you're not.
SUPMALE:yeah, we are.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it was great when you were in high school, But now you're a man.
LEADFEMALE:No i'm not.
LEADMALE:I know it's hard for you to hear, but you are a man.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop saying that.
OTHERFEMALE:I said I was sorry.
LEADMALE:David.
OTHERMALE:David, you didn't think we were gonna let you live here forever, did you? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Not "forever.
OTHERFEMALE:" Come on, David.
LEADFEMALE:It may take me awhile to find a place.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not kicking you out.
SUPMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess I am.
LEADFEMALE:I've never had to do this before.
