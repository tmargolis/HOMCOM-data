LEADMALE:Oh, god, maybe I should take the test next week.
OTHERFEMALE:Relax, Jackie, you only missed one.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got this trucking license nailed.
LEADFEMALE:O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADMALE:, next question.
OTHERMALE:What is the importance of proper weight distribution? To avoid being top-heavy.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't have to worry about that, aunt Jackie.
LEADMALE:God, I hate Kathy Bowman.
SUPFEMALE:And today's reason is? She spends about a billion dollars on all this furniture That looks like it belongs in Italy, And now she's giving it away to charity.
LEADFEMALE:This couch don't even have any butt-dents in it.
LEADMALE:How can you take a nice, charitable thing And turn it into a mean, vindictive thing? Hey, That's what makes me, me.
OTHERFEMALE:She's just giving away that coffee table to show off.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Becky, quiz me.
LEADFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:k.
LEADMALE:Uh, gross vehicle weight.
SUPFEMALE:Um, total weight of single vehicle plus its load.
LEADMALE:Oh, o.
LEADFEMALE:k.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:That's way too good for the needy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be back.
LEADMALE:You ready? Yeah.
LEADMALE:What is the proper procedure to follow If your vehicle is leaking toxic fluids In a residential neighborhood? Okay, it's got something to do with those orange cones, right? No? O.
LEADFEMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:They'll never ask that on the test anyway.
LEADMALE:Did anybody bring the paper in? No, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Becky, I'm really sorry.
SUPFEMALE:About what? I didn't mean it.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do, you little freak? I was in your room.
LEADFEMALE:It was an accident.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm going to kill you, d.j. Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Just driving her crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Excellent work, son.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, dad.
LEADMALE:I'm so damn proud I could burst.
SUPFEMALE:Stay.
LEADMALE:God, is that tacky.
LEADMALE:I know it.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you believe Kathy Bowman Was giving this to the good samaritans? These go for 200 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:I gave the good samaritan driver 20 bucks for it.
LEADFEMALE:Plus, the money's going to charity.
SUPMALE:What do you think, Dan? It is snowing outside? 'Cause this must be christmas.
LEADFEMALE:Ha ha ha! I knew you'd love it.
LEADMALE:It's art.
LEADMALE:It ain't just art.
LEADFEMALE:It's got a big hole in the back Where you can stick stuff in.
SUPFEMALE:You done good, honey.
LEADMALE:This is a great piece of crap.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you what, this piece of crap Totally out-craps all our other crap.
OTHERMALE:So we follow these good samaritan trucks around And buy stuff really cheap.
OTHERFEMALE:Then we go to a swap meet And sell it for an embarrassing amount of money.
LEADFEMALE:What about the good samaritans? Isn't that going to cut into their business? Forget about them.
SUPMALE:We're squeezing them out.
LEADMALE:Roseanne, what are you doing? Well, I'm changing the cherry On the fruit cups, Leon.
LEADMALE:It is wednesday, isn't it? All day.
LEADFEMALE:I thought so.
LEADFEMALE:How old are these? I don't know.
SUPMALE:They've been here since I got hired.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, ladies.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Are you ready, Leon? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:We've got lots of packing to do.
LEADMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADMALE:Are you going on a trip? Steven is.
LEADMALE:Because Steven must magically disappear Whenever Leon's mother comes to town.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we settled this.
SUPMALE:You're not the one being kicked out of your home, are you Leon.
LEADFEMALE:Why kick him out? Don't your mom know you're gay? Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:My mother knows.
OTHERMALE:That doesn't mean She's going to be comfortable staying in the same house with me and my lover.
LEADMALE:Why not? Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:How do they know how she's going to react unless they give her a chance? Thanks, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:I've been saying that for three years.
SUPMALE:Yes, thank you, Roseanne, If you don't mind, butt out.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to hear her opinion.
SUPFEMALE:Please, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:Don't look at me.
SUPMALE:I want to hear what you have to say, too.
SUPFEMALE:Well Of course I totally agree With my boss' position here and everything, But I understand where Steven's coming from, too, 'Cause he just wants to be acknowledged.
SUPMALE:I mean, he's like your wife--or your husband.
OTHERMALE:I don't really know how you guys work this out.
LEADFEMALE:For instance, I don't know who does the cleaning And who watches monday night football, But-Well That clearly was a waste of time.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think I should have the opportunity To get to know his mother? Why are you asking her? Because she understands.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody does but you.
OTHERFEMALE:No, she is not everybody.
SUPFEMALE:She is nobody.
OTHERFEMALE:Steven, my mother is a 70-year-old woman.
LEADFEMALE:She was uncomfortable with Mary Martin as Peter Pan.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to be very, very awkward for her.
LEADFEMALE:Awkward for you, Leon.
LEADFEMALE:Can we talk about this at home? Are you embarrassed about who you are? No.
LEADFEMALE:Is it about me? No.
LEADFEMALE:Then stop hiding me.
OTHERMALE:Let me stay in my home when your mother visits.
SUPFEMALE:This is important to me, Leon.
LEADMALE:Leon Please.
LEADMALE:All right, no packing.
LEADFEMALE:You can stay.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Attaboy, Leon.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne, did it ever occur to you even one moment to stay out of this? Yeah, but by then it was way too late.
LEADMALE:Oh, you guys.
LEADMALE:My own fuzzy dice.
LEADFEMALE:Smell them.
OTHERFEMALE:They smell.
OTHERFEMALE:Two bucks more, but when your sister gets her trucker's license, you pull out all the stops.
SUPMALE:You aced the driving part? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You'd be surprised how courteous people are When they see an 18-wheeler With "student driver" written on it.
OTHERMALE:So what comes next? I start out short-hauling And then ease into the five-night interstate hauls.
LEADFEMALE:Five nights? Do you stay at motels? The cab's got a sleeping compartment.
LEADFEMALE:But it doesn't have a shower, does it? That's why she needs the dice scented.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Bowman's coming, and she looks mad.
LEADMALE:That's my fault.
SUPFEMALE:My rig's blocking her driveway.
LEADMALE:I better get it back to the lot.
LEADMALE:Anybody want a ride? Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:Darlene? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Darlene, it'll be fun.
SUPFEMALE:You can roll down the window And spit into convertibles.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:That's Kathy.
SUPMALE:I don't want her thinking You was picking through her trash, so here's the deal.
LEADMALE:We paid full price for that dog at Rodbell's-I thought they went for 200.
LEADMALE:Well, we overpaid Because we're making a fortune at the shop.
LEADFEMALE:Got it, lovey.
SUPMALE:But do be quick.
SUPMALE:We dine with the Snotheads at 8:00.
SUPMALE:Hi, Jackie just went out to move her-Roseanne My house was robbed.
SUPMALE:We were away for the weekend, And two guys dressed like good samaritans Just backed a van up to the house And cleaned us out In broad daylight.
SUPMALE:Oh, th-that is unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:You--you better sit down.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Henderson said he saw the entire thing And didn't do a thing.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of a neighbor is that? That's a bad, bad neighbor.
LEADMALE:I feel so So violated.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure you do.
OTHERMALE:They took things I've been collecting for years.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:They took that stuff? That's bad.
OTHERMALE:Hey, if you're going to be mad at anybody, Be mad at them.
SUPMALE:The police are going to take statements.
LEADMALE:I don't suppose you saw anything.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Well, they seemed really nice.
SUPMALE:They called me "ma'am" and everything.
LEADMALE:Wait, You spoke to the criminals? Well, haggled is more like it.
LEADMALE:Oh, my god.
LEADMALE:That's my umbrella stand.
LEADFEMALE:Umbrellas.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
OTHERMALE:You--you bought this from the robbers? How could you do that? Didn't you see the big-screen TV in the truck? Do you really think we would have given away A brand new 45-inch television to charity? Well, it would have been a nice gesture.
LEADMALE:I don't believe you, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Just calm down here.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know your house was getting robbed.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I was doing a good thing.
LEADMALE:I thought I was doing something for charity.
LEADMALE:A good thing? It was a stupid thing, Roseanne.
LEADFEMALE:It was the stupidest thing anybody's ever done.
SUPFEMALE:You're the stupidest woman On the face of the earth.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? I Paid 20 bucks for that piece of crap, And you paid 200! That's stupid! I was starting to worry about you guys you been gone a long time.
SUPMALE:You should have worried.
LEADFEMALE:Jackie almost killed us.
LEADFEMALE:She was just showing how well the rig cornered.
LEADFEMALE:She missed the bus stop by almost a foot.
OTHERMALE:Everybody there dove under the bench.
LEADFEMALE:They were old.
OTHERMALE:They panicked.
LEADFEMALE:It was so cool.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you had fun, Darlene.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what about me? It doesn't sound like you had any fun, Becky.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Jer.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Roseanne here? She's at her friend Crystal's.
OTHERMALE:Uh, could we talk? Sure.
LEADMALE:Want a beer? Definitely.

LEADMALE:The insurance should cover everything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's good, yeah.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Dan, uh, Kathy wants to put up an electric fence.
LEADMALE:An electric fence won't do you no good, Jerry.
SUPFEMALE:They're not going to rob you again.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not for burglars.
LEADFEMALE:It's for Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Electricity won't stop her.
SUPFEMALE:I've tried.
SUPFEMALE:She's not much of a swimmer, though.
LEADFEMALE:You might want to build a moat.
SUPMALE:I've got to do something.
SUPFEMALE:She wants to move back to Chicago.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Really? Wow.
SUPMALE:Anything I can do? Could you get Roseanne to apologize? Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:When you move, can I have your satellite dish? What are we going to do, Dan? Our wives just-they just-Hate each other.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's good for them, Jer.
OTHERMALE:Roseanne gets so worked up over Kathy She gets all flushed, her heart races, works up a sweat.
LEADMALE:It's kind of an aerobic thing.
LEADFEMALE:Look at the weight she's lost Since you guys moved in.
SUPFEMALE:I can't leave without something, Dan.
LEADMALE:I mean, she's--she's making my life miserable.
LEADMALE:Oh, here.
LEADFEMALE:Take the pooch, jer.
SUPMALE:Roseanne was going to return it anyway, But this way you get it in one piece.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:But Kathy said we should start a neighborhood watch.
LEADMALE:But that's what happened, Jer.
SUPFEMALE:You got robbed, and the neighborhood watched.
OTHERMALE:Morning.

LEADFEMALE:I hate you, Leon.
SUPFEMALE:I hate you more.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'll just be up in housewares.
SUPFEMALE:I would tell mom if I was gay.
SUPMALE:You couldn't tell her You were going to be a cop.
LEADFEMALE:How could you tell her you were gay? Easy.
LEADMALE:It would kill her.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.

SUPFEMALE:I don't want him keeping secrets from me.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't mind? No.
