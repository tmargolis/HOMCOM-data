LEADMALE:And miss hearing my family scream At the top of their lungs in the morning? Well, you know, it's breakfast time, Dan.
OTHERMALE:I did my best.
LEADMALE:You should be thankful nobody was hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Is this big pile of dirty clothes on the floor here for me? Oh, honey, and it's not even my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:It was late.
SUPFEMALE:I was tired.
LEADMALE:I was going to pick them up in the morning After a full four hours' sleep.
LEADMALE:Where's the towels? In the washer.

SUPMALE:Just go to school.
LEADFEMALE:Follow Becky.
SUPMALE:She knows where it is.
OTHERMALE:You let her off mighty damn easy.

SUPMALE:Make her do more homework.
LEADMALE:I'll get right on that Because I don't have enough to do.
LEADFEMALE:How long are you going to let this go on? Let's pretend like you're ever home.
OTHERMALE:What would you do? Don't start.
LEADMALE:I'm killing myself at that shop.
LEADMALE:I don't have a job, the restaurant, and the kids.
SUPFEMALE:You get eight hours' sleep.

OTHERMALE:That's why I'm so damn chipper in the morning.
LEADMALE:What is this about, Roseanne--clothes, Darlene, what? Could you just take me to the restaurant? Could you do that without us fighting? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I think I can manage that! Fine! And don't use all the toilet paper either.
SUPFEMALE:That's our last roll! How long have you been here? Since hairy towels.
LEADFEMALE:That was a good one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Jackie, whatever you're here for, Just go ahead, borrow it, eat it, use it, or wash it.

SUPMALE:Do you want to talk about it? Oh, god, Jackie, don't you have some load of innocent chickens to drop off at the nugget factory or something? What's the deal? You guys have been fighting all the time lately.
LEADFEMALE:No, that isn't true.
OTHERFEMALE:We only fight when we see each other, which is hardly ever.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:It's just a combination of the fact That we are both exhausted and he's such a jerk! Oh, my god.
SUPFEMALE:It's Arnie.
LEADMALE:What's he doing here so early in the morning? Perhaps he dropped by to have sex with you again.
LEADMALE:Look I made a mistake, o.
LEADMALE:k.
LEADFEMALE:? When are you going to drop it already? Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm just crazed.

LEADMALE:This time it's for real.
LEADMALE:I Said I wouldn't marry until I had money put away.
LEADMALE:Nancy's dad gave me $5,000 never to see her again.
LEADMALE:You are such a leech.
