SUPFEMALE:yeah, he's great when he's not rotten.
OTHERMALE:there's no such thing as a rotten son, rosie.
LEADMALE:they're too precious.
LEADMALE:i don't know about mothers and sons, but with fathers and sons a father looks at his son, and he sees every mistake he ever made.
LEADMALE:he just wants to put him on some kind of path where he won't make those same mistakes.
LEADMALE:but, edno, a father and a son you see what would've, what could've, what should've been.
LEADMALE:eded, when you're on the phone, do you ever use the top half? oh, oh, yeahyeah, i run off at the mouth sometime, but so do you.
SUPMALE:yeah, but when i speak, i'm speaking for all of womankind.
LEADMALE:what does all of womankind know about fathers and sons? all i was doing was giving danny a little fatherly advice.
LEADMALE:but that's the thing about fatherly advice.
LEADFEMALE:it's a give-and-take kind of thing.
LEADMALE:you can only give it so much before the kid can't take it anymore.
LEADMALE:yeah, butyeah, butbOTH: you knowyou should go talk to him.

LEADFEMALE:that's the guy.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, we almost got a foul ball.
LEADMALE:this close.
LEADMALE:this close.
OTHERMALE:yeah.
SUPMALE:we would've had it, too, if you hadn't been yakking to the people behind us about the invention of the forklift.
LEADFEMALE:you know what this is like, danny? this is like ants.
LEADFEMALE:what's like ants? what the hell are you talking about? you and me.
SUPFEMALE:when an insect threatens an anthill, the ants instinctively protect those they're related to.
SUPFEMALE:that's nature.
OTHERMALE:that's life.
OTHERMALE:that's dinner.
LEADFEMALE:see ya.
SUPMALE:hey, danny.
LEADMALE:what? i came here to square things with you.

LEADMALE:the windshield wipers, they're working like a charm.
SUPFEMALE:i said to your mother, "audrey, i'm gonna revolutionize the automobile industry.
SUPFEMALE:" an idea as simple as a hula hoop, as practical as a paper clip.
LEADMALE:who knows what it is? mud flaps? no.
SUPFEMALE:that's pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:but now see, try to think about the rear of the car.
SUPFEMALE:ed, the only thing i can think of that you do in the rear of a car, i know you didn't invent it.
LEADFEMALE:rear windshield wipers.
LEADMALE:give this young lady you invented rear windshield wipers? could've, should've, would've.
LEADMALE:boy, i'm telling you.
LEADFEMALE:but your mother, she had to have a rest stop.
LEADFEMALE:well, casting no aspersions, she was eight months pregnant at the time.
LEADMALE:she was a little incontinent.
LEADFEMALE:so we stop, and i lose my train of thought.
LEADMALE:it wasn't until two years later till i see a pair on the back end of a chrysler imperial i remember i invented 'em.
SUPFEMALE:this close, danny.
SUPMALE:this close.
LEADMALE:i learned my lesson.
OTHERFEMALE:you got to grab your opportunities when they come by.
LEADFEMALE:darlene, pass the beets, please.
SUPMALE:well, do they? do they what? stain your teeth.

SUPFEMALE:no.
LEADMALE:i was in the main dining room.
LEADFEMALE:i turned aroundhe's gonna tell it.
LEADMALE:he's gonna tell it.
SUPFEMALE:well, dan, it's not like we haven't heard your stories 30 times.
SUPMALE:what stories? oh, come on, dan.
LEADMALE:how many times have i listened to the incredible story about how you were the first customer ever at the new supermarket? i'll tell ya, dan, if you don't wanna hear my stories, you don't have to hear my stories.
LEADMALE:as a matter of fact, you can freeze in hell before you hear another one of my stories.
LEADMALE:excuse me.
LEADMALE:come on, sit down! dan, cool it.
LEADFEMALE:i'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:i got us into this, i'll get us out of it.
SUPFEMALE:ed, you're half right.
LEADFEMALE:you got us into it, and i'll get us out of it.
LEADFEMALE:dan the statute of limitations on parental crime runs out when you're about 30.
LEADMALE:so he didn't invent the rear windshield wiper.
LEADMALE:that's not it.
LEADFEMALE:so he never really met esther williams.
LEADMALE:it's not the windshield wipers.
OTHERFEMALE:it's not esther williams.
LEADMALE:it's his fork.
LEADFEMALE:what? he holds his fork the same way i do.
SUPFEMALE:i hold my fork the same way he does.
LEADMALE:i'm him.
LEADFEMALE:i think you're reading a little bit too much into silverware.
LEADFEMALE:i'm sitting there at the kitchen table, honey, and i'm watching him and i'm listening, and it's me, and i hate it.
SUPFEMALE:well, you know, dan, if you didn't know ed conner and you just bumped into him, you'd go have a couple of beers, and you'd talk about baseball, and he'd probably sell you a forklift.
LEADMALE:you know what scares me the most? when he was 36 years old, he was right where i am today.
LEADMALE:that's me down the road.
LEADFEMALE:no, that's him.
LEADMALE:those are his choices.
OTHERMALE:that's ed.
LEADFEMALE:roseanne, i got a broken-down truck.
LEADMALE:i got a broken-down cement finisher.
SUPFEMALE:i hear myself telling the same damn stories 12 times.
LEADMALE:well, i'm not saying you're not boring.
LEADMALE:you're just boring in a different way than your dad.
LEADFEMALE:it's genetic.
SUPMALE:it's in the genes.
OTHERFEMALE:you see him, you get me.
LEADFEMALE:well, maybe that's why i like him.
LEADMALE:you know, he has that certain virile conner charm, you know.
SUPMALE:come back in there with me, come on.
LEADFEMALE:yeah, we might be missing a good story.
LEADFEMALE:allow me to introducemaking yet another appearance at our dinner tablethe lovely, the indefatigable mr.
OTHERFEMALE:dan conner and his lovely wife tammi.

SUPFEMALE:carrots.
LEADMALE:i hate carrots.
LEADFEMALE:you know why? tell me.
LEADFEMALE:would you stop hogging all of these blankets? blankets? let me tell you a little something about blankets.
SUPFEMALE:i came this close to inventing the blanket in 1969.
LEADFEMALE:it was right after woodstock.
LEADFEMALE:and a guy named navajo joe up to me and he says, "i already invented the blanket.
LEADFEMALE:" so he took it away from me.
LEADMALE:wasn't it? woodstock.
LEADFEMALE:who was on the mound that year? fergie jenkins.
LEADMALE:boy, what a set of chompers he had.
SUPFEMALE:you talk about teeth.
LEADMALE:but he went plumb midget on me.
OTHERFEMALE:and he went and sunk all his money into what you call a hair dryer stock.
LEADFEMALE:he tried to invent a five-speed, four-door mix hair dryer, and he lost all his dough.
SUPFEMALE:then he couldn't do nothing about it.
SUPFEMALE:so i ups to him and i says, "fergie, what the heck do you know about hair dryers anyway?" he goes, "well, it gets windy in chicago.
SUPMALE:" i said, "chicago?" "yeah, i was almost in the band chicago.
LEADFEMALE:i used to mix their sound tracks for 'em, but i couldn't quite get it, see.
LEADMALE:" ahh good night, ed.
LEADMALE:night.
LEADMALE:night.
LEADMALE:what the hell do you know about night? i was almost on the edge of night one time, except i got my foot cut off in vietnam, and i couldn't quite make it to the audition.
LEADMALE:and the cabdriver didn't speak english, so he didn't knowshut up! i was shut up in a cave one time.
LEADMALE:the meramac caverns just south of st.
SUPMALE:louis.
LEADMALE:it was me and three other guys.
