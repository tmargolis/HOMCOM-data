SUPMALE:She's finally coming out of her shell.
LEADFEMALE:Quiet, everybody.
LEADMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we're not gonna sit here and tell you guys how great we are.
LEADMALE:You're gonna do it! I want somebody to make a toast.
SUPMALE:I'll do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, pipe down, everyone.
LEADMALE:Forrest Gump's talking.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanna say how amazing it is to see a marriage that lasts 45 years.
SUPMALE:And, Mom and Dad, you set a great example for all of us, and it's a pretty high bar.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Darlene couldn't get over it, and Becky's stuck under it, and my marriage is It's not really a picnic.
LEADMALE:I mean, my w Thank you! Anyway, Mom and Dad, happy 45th.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Becky, since you're our waitress for this evening, do you guys have any special anniversary song here? Nice try.

LEADMALE:Don't do it.
SUPMALE:It's my birthday today! Yay! Hey, everybody! It's Darlene's birthday! She's 60! Feliz cumpleaÃ±os a ti Feliz cumpleaÃ±os a ti Feliz cumpleaÃ±os A Darlene iFeliz cumpleaÃ±os a ti! Ay-yi-yi-yiyi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.
LEADMALE:Thank you! Ah.
SUPFEMALE:So, are you guys doing anything special for your anniversary? You got to do something.
SUPMALE:45 years I mean, people get less than that for murder.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, got it! Wait, do you guys get points on your credit card? We get threats.
LEADMALE:Is that the same thing? No, you get points for every dollar that you spend.
LEADMALE:It's like a reward.
SUPFEMALE:You can use 'em for, like, travel or to buy things.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you can stay at some nice hotel in the city for your anniversary.
LEADMALE:Put in your password, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see how many points we have.
SUPMALE:Well, this is the credit card we used to pay off all the other credit cards, so we probably got a bunch.
SUPFEMALE:We got enough for one night at the Radford Suites, with points left over for H-Hold me, Mama, 'cause I'm fit to bust A Honey Baked ham! Did I mention the hotel has a pool? Like if you had a ham and a room, you'd ever come out of there to swim.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm booking it.
LEADFEMALE:And, as my anniversary present to you guys, I'll babysit the kids.
LEADFEMALE:It's not babysitting when they're yours! "Roseanne" is recorded live in front of a studio audience.
SUPFEMALE:Right, we'll be there at 3:00.
LEADFEMALE:And it's our anniversary, so I really want this to be special.
SUPFEMALE:I want to reserve the biggest, nicest one you got.
LEADFEMALE:Just like we had on our wedding night.
LEADFEMALE:Is that the hotel? No, it's the ham people.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:We're picking one up on the way.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Thank You have a Honey Baked day, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we got a problem.
SUPMALE:Two, if you don't think leftover Chinese food belongs in an omelette.
LEADMALE:My knee is killing me, and a bunch of my pain pills are missing.
SUPFEMALE:This thing was, like, half full.
SUPMALE:How many did you take? Just a couple for my back.
LEADMALE:Are you sure you didn't take more than you thought? If I was taking handsful of these pills, I'd be in a way better mood.
LEADFEMALE:Have you noticed me in a way better mood, Dan? The only thing I've noticed is that I love you more every day.
LEADFEMALE:Sir.
SUPFEMALE:Well, somebody must have taken 'em, so we have to find out who it was.
SUPFEMALE:We have a serious opioid problem in this country.
LEADMALE:Let's examine who else had access to the narcotics! Everybody in this house.
LEADMALE:You know, back in the day, I busted up a hashish ring in the in the Model U.
SUPMALE:N.
OTHERFEMALE:down at the junior high.
LEADFEMALE:It was Luxembourg.
LEADMALE:It's always Luxembourg.
SUPFEMALE:Darlene! Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:What brings you to the kitchen? I was following a rainbow.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I just came down for coffee.
OTHERMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Interesting.
LEADMALE:Because you're groggy? Unable to deal with the real world? Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:Are you selling vitamins again? Some of your mom's pain pills are missing.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, I don't take pills of any kind.
LEADMALE:I don't like to feel out of control, or I can't manage my multinational empire.
OTHERMALE:How come there's sweet-and-sour shrimp in the eggs? You know, I don't think I've noticed before Are you wearing eyelash extensions? I literally can't even afford ChapStick.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Because your natural lashes are fantastic.
SUPFEMALE:Open up your eyes real wide.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:No slurred speech or pinpoint pupils.
SUPMALE:Mom, what is this? She's clean! We're never gonna find out anything like this, Rose.
LEADMALE:There's been a ton of people through this house.
SUPFEMALE:Let's just hide the pills in a safer place.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that doesn't solve my problem.
LEADFEMALE:I can't get a damn refill for two more weeks, and my knee is holding a gun to my head.
LEADMALE:Well, I could go to my doctor and tell him my back's flared up again.
LEADFEMALE:That's so sweet.
SUPMALE:Tonight I'm gonna give your back a reason to flare up.
LEADFEMALE:Zut alors! Hey, Crystal.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hey, everybody.
SUPMALE:Guess what today is.
SUPFEMALE:A fundraiser for your dignity? No, no, no.
LEADMALE:You're such a stitch.
LEADFEMALE:It's my last day before I retire! All right! It's about time.
LEADMALE:You've been working that saloon since when, 1865? Give her a break, Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:There's a cattle drive a-comin' through town, and Miss Kitty wants her to be real friendly-like to all the cowpokes.
SUPFEMALE:Laugh all you want, but I'm about to start living the best years of my life.
OTHERMALE:I'm retiring from the casino with full benefits! Full benefits? That's amazing, Crystal.
LEADFEMALE:No one has that nowadays.
LEADMALE:I brought you champagne for tonight.
LEADMALE:Hey, Crystal.
LEADMALE:Uh, I didn't know exactly when the women's movement would end, but now seems like a pretty good time to call it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Darlene, you still looking for work? 'Cause if I recommend you for my job, you're as good as in.
SUPMALE:Aw, that's really sweet, Crystal.
LEADFEMALE:Did I mention the benefits package includes mental health? I just found out I hate my mother.
SUPMALE:Which is really weird because I love my mother.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, you have full benefits? If you don't want it, Darlene, I'll take it.
SUPMALE:Um, you know what? I-I appreciate the offer, but it's not really my thing, so go for it, Beck.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't feel like you're betraying your Mexican heritage.
LEADMALE:Are you sure you want to turn that job down? For full dental and medical, I'd wear that dress.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, you got to that pretty quick.
OTHERFEMALE:Anything you want to tell me, Dad? I gotta be honest, Darlene, I don't know how you can pass on a job with full benefits.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I have some pretty good reasons.
LEADFEMALE:Shall we start with the riverboat-whore vibe? Hey, you know who wasn't too good to wear that dress? One Mr.
LEADMALE:Bugs Bunny.
LEADMALE:Dad, I still want to be a writer.
LEADMALE:I mean, I've gone from novels to textbooks to menus.
LEADFEMALE:If I take this waitress job, I'm just giving up completely.
SUPMALE:What are you gonna do if your kids get sick, write about it? Well, we managed so far.
LEADMALE:You've been lucky.
LEADFEMALE:One emergency can wipe you out.
SUPMALE:You know what I'd give right now to have full coverage for your mother's knee? Sometimes you just gotta suck it up and put your family first.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You made your point.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:I know a little bit about how this world works.
OTHERMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, I got to go jam a sleep-apnea mask and a seven-pound ham into an overnight bag.
LEADMALE:Good evening.
SUPMALE:Checking in.
SUPFEMALE:Points? Last name? Hilton.
LEADFEMALE:Staying under the name Conner.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:I have you right here.
SUPFEMALE:We have a superior deluxe room with a view.
SUPMALE:Ooh! Were we upgraded? Oh, no, sir.
SUPFEMALE:"Superior deluxe" is our lowest level room.
OTHERMALE:You have a mini-bar, and you also have 24-hour access to our business center.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:I can't wait 'til we're checked in, Dan, so we can get down there to the business center.
LEADMALE:Capital idea.
OTHERMALE:I need to fax a copy of my ass to our associates in Singapore.
LEADMALE:If I could just get a credit card for incidentals? For who? The points cover the room, but the card is in case you want to order room service or purchase a movie.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:I-I guess I'll just use this one.
OTHERMALE:Our platinum card's in the shop.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Do I smell ham? Hm.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, sir.
LEADMALE:This card was declined.
OTHERMALE:Would you like to try another one? Uh, listen here, my good man, we won't be getting any incidents, so you can just skip that part.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I-I can't check you in without a credit card.
SUPMALE:It's just the policy of the hotel.
LEADMALE:And every hotel in the world.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell's this country coming to when you need money to get free stuff? Let me tell ya something, I don't even want to stay here now.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to go home.
OTHERFEMALE:And if you saw where we live, you would know what an insult that is.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
OTHERFEMALE:This is not who I am.
LEADFEMALE:It's what you've made me! You know, screw that hotel.
OTHERMALE:The two most important things about our anniversary are right here.
OTHERMALE:What, me and ham? I was gonna say "liquor and ham," but I'm glad you joined us.
SUPMALE:And now Mexican champagne.
SUPMALE:Ooh! It's pink.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's the salsa.
OTHERFEMALE:Does Madame approve? Hells, yeah, Madame does! To the woman who makes it a pleasure to wake up every morning.
LEADFEMALE:Here's to you, Little Debbie.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! Who wants whipped cream? Me.
LEADMALE:Where are my baby birds? Just for the kids.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look.
LEADFEMALE:When you connect the dots, it makes a giant bean.
SUPMALE:You couldn't tell that without connecting the dots? Hey, chica.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, gringa.
LEADFEMALE:So, while I have you alone for a minute, um I've really been thinking about it, and I'd be pretty irresponsible not to go after that job.
SUPFEMALE:It doesn't work like that.
LEADMALE:You can't say you don't want a job one day and then turn around and say you want it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I see you're well-versed in labor law.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have any other options.
LEADFEMALE:You don't need this job.
LEADFEMALE:You have a college degree.
LEADFEMALE:Well, unfortunately, Walmart has no more openings in their English Lit department.
LEADFEMALE:You still have a better chance of finding something than I do.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to say, Becky.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not doing this for me.
SUPFEMALE:My kids need medical and dental.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you want them to have that? So because you have kids, my problems will never be as important as yours? Oh, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Us single moms have had it too easy for too long.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you might want to get back there.
LEADMALE:Harris found some dirty phrases in the word search, and now the little ones are asking questions.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, my turn to spin the bottle now.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Ohh! Oh! You got to kiss the ham.
LEADMALE:I've kissed worse.
LEADMALE:Mmm! Oohmm! What's so funny? Oh! "Ham" is spelled the same way frontward and backward.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:Methinks the lady hath been overserved.
LEADMALE:Arf! Are you growling at me? Ruff! I see how this is.
OTHERMALE:It's time to take this party to the bedroom.
SUPFEMALE:Arf! Down, girl.
SUPMALE:Ham! Oh! I gotta tell you, I don't even recognize what it is we're doing anymore.
LEADMALE:What the hell, Rose? You only had a couple of drinks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not my fault.
SUPMALE:The champagne on the Vicodin should say "Do not take with label.
SUPMALE:" But the good news is my knees are gone! How could you possibly have taken more Vicodin? I didn't even get the prescription yet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you better get on it, because my secret bottles are running low.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you look like my husband.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Busy.
OTHERMALE:Can't talk now.
LEADMALE:I got an 8% tip riding on this.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Crystal called me.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you so much for not going after that job.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to thank me.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to leave here anyway.
SUPMALE:We just got cream-filled churros.
OTHERFEMALE:It's an exciting time.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Um I won't thank you.
LEADMALE:But I will give you a gift.
LEADFEMALE:Brochures? Thanks! I've seen these at the bank, but I never dreamed of owning one.
SUPMALE:Just read it, dork.
OTHERMALE:There's a program in hotel and restaurant management at U of I, St.
SUPFEMALE:Charles, and I checked into it.
SUPMALE:You qualify for a state grant because, luckily, you're poor and old.
LEADFEMALE:I work full time.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have time to go to school.
LEADFEMALE:But they have night classes, or you can do it online.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Becky.
LEADFEMALE:You were always so great in school.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm 43 years old.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, so in two years, you can be a 45-year-old waitress hustling for tips or you can be a 45-year-old with a degree pulling down almost six figures a year.
LEADMALE:And look, between classes, you can sit under a tree and play guitar with one friend of every color.
SUPFEMALE:I gotta get back to work.
SUPFEMALE:I'll think about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:All right, I think I have one more thing to show you.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you gave up a lot for me, so I feel I owe you this.
SUPMALE:Good morning.
OTHERMALE:Afternoon, actually.
SUPMALE:You okay? My mouth hurts.
LEADFEMALE:That's because the tug-of-war over the ham bone took 20 minutes.
LEADMALE:When did that happen? Right after you tried to eat my pants.
OTHERMALE:Let's talk.
LEADMALE:Not until I get a pill.
LEADFEMALE:I'm hurtin'.
LEADFEMALE:You want pills? I got pills.
SUPFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:That's a lot of pills, Dan.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you might have a problem.
SUPFEMALE:I do have a problem.
LEADMALE:I found these pills hidden all over the house.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you tell me how big of a problem I have? Well, you already admitted you have a problem, so that's your first step.
SUPFEMALE:So now you should go find a meeting.
SUPFEMALE:Roseanne.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'm in pain, so I take a few extra pills.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like I'm a drug addict.
LEADMALE:Really? Who's Billy Kreski? His mom gave those to me.
SUPFEMALE:He got 'em when he got his wisdom teeth out.
LEADFEMALE:If it wasn't for me, the kid might've got hooked on pain pills.
SUPFEMALE:You're hoarding pills, you sent me out for more, you blamed the kids All lies.
LEADMALE:45 years of marriage, you've never lied to me like this before.
SUPMALE:Or have you? No.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't say anything because we can't afford the surgery.
SUPMALE:And I got these pills 'cause I'm gonna be dealing with this for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have any idea how bad it hurts.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I do.
SUPMALE:I got a bad back.
LEADMALE:And when your back goes out, you lay on the couch for two weeks, and I wait on you hand and foot.
LEADMALE:You know what happens when my knee hurts? I do the cleaning, the shopping, the cooking Fine! I'll do all that.
SUPMALE:Just show me where the water bucket is and the sponge on the stick thingy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll cut back.
SUPMALE:No, you won't.
LEADFEMALE:You're taking these for more than pain.
LEADFEMALE:Book the surgery.
LEADMALE:Where are we gonna get $3,000 for the deductible? Look, if it's between you OD-ing and me coming up with the money, I'll figure out something.
LEADMALE:In the meantime, I'll give you one pill "every six to eight hours for post-operative pain.
LEADMALE:" What the hell? Are You sure Marcy Bellinger doesn't need these? When you get new boobs, compliments should be enough.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to take a walk.
LEADMALE:I know you can do this.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADMALE:Here's your Crown and diet, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Thanks, drank skank.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, you forgot my lemon.
LEADFEMALE:Would you be a dear? When I get back with a lemon, are you gonna ask me to bring you a lime? I wouldn't want to have to tell the manager you mistreated me on my birthday.
OTHERMALE:I'll be right back.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, sir.
LEADMALE:That blonde over there asked me to give you her number, and she loves when guys send pics.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck.
