LEADFEMALE:Nobody wants to hang out with my parents! You would have been doing it for me.
LEADFEMALE:So one time.
OTHERMALE:All the time.

OTHERFEMALE:This is great.

SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Becky, you going out tonight? Real funny, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Great going, Dan.
LEADMALE:Brilliant.
OTHERMALE:Well, I didn't mean anything by it.

LEADMALE:God, you're such a man.
OTHERFEMALE:Should I go up and talk to her? You're the last person she needs to talk to.
SUPFEMALE:She needs her mother.
SUPMALE:And her aunt.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, why did mom call you a man like that? Well, um Because she's mad at me, Deej.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it was good to be a man.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Not since the late sixties, son.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I ought go in there with you.
LEADMALE:I can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know anything about breaking up or getting hurt.
SUPFEMALE:You married the first guy you ever dated.
LEADFEMALE:You think that doesn't hurt? I have something to contribute here.
LEADMALE:I'll call you when I need you, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:What am I supposed to do, just stand here? No, stand here.
LEADMALE:See, you can hear everything that goes on If we're not in the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Well, you must be really happy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Becky, you know that's not true.
OTHERFEMALE:How can I be happy when you're so miserable? Because you always hated him.
LEADMALE:Because he's a jerk.
SUPMALE:Right? Well, if you feel he's a jerk, I'll have to respect that.
LEADFEMALE:He's such a scum.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't love me.
SUPMALE:Cared about his stupid hair more than he cared about me.
SUPMALE:Let it out.
SUPFEMALE:Where was he going with his life anyway? He was such a loser.
LEADMALE:I miss him so much.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, of course you do, honey.
LEADMALE:Gee, you were dating him for what to hurt a little.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm a mess.
LEADMALE:I don't want to eat.

LEADMALE:Thank you very much, Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:The whole family's going to come in here? We love you.
LEADMALE:We're going to see you through this.
LEADMALE:I don't even know why I care.
LEADMALE:I broke up with him.
OTHERFEMALE:That doesn't mean that you don't still love him.
LEADFEMALE:Where you going with this, Jackie? But just because you love him doesn't mean that he's good for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:It just seemed there were more bad times than good times.
LEADMALE:There you go.
SUPMALE:I don't know if I'll feel this way about anybody else.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe not.
LEADFEMALE:He was your first serious boyfriend, That well always be special.
LEADFEMALE:Another guy will come along, and hopefully, he'll be rich, and that'll be the end of it.

LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? They'll be lined up around the block.
OTHERMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You're pretty.
LEADMALE:And you're smart.
LEADMALE:You really think so? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:There's a ton of boys waiting to hear Mark's out of the picture.
LEADMALE:What if the next guy's a creep, too? Then you'll know a lot sooner.
SUPMALE:Eventually you'll meet some guy who's not a creep.
LEADMALE:Even better than that, you'll meet a guy who's everything you wanted and makes you really, really happy.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, you can never let him know that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this one's done.
LEADFEMALE:Already, how can I charge for three hours' labor when you're done in 45 minutes? You want me to start on the next one? Don't you want to get out of here? You saying I got nothing to do? I can get a date.
OTHERFEMALE:I just happen to need the cash.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to run out of here crying, are you? Customer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, jeez.

SUPMALE:I know you didn't mean to say anything stupid.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Hey, Becky.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Mark.
LEADFEMALE:I'll leave you two alone.
LEADMALE:Why would we want to be alone? I don't know that answer to that.
SUPMALE:I heard you out here.
LEADMALE:I figured you might want this back.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:I got to get back to work, so Well I guess it takes a big man to return an earring.
LEADFEMALE:He's still working here? Umyes? You're letting him work here after the way he treated me? You can't expect me to fire him just because you broke up.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I do.
SUPMALE:I can't.
SUPFEMALE:You only hired him 'cause of me.
SUPFEMALE:I hired him because he's a good mechanic.
SUPMALE:You don't care how I feel.
LEADMALE:Of course I do.
LEADMALE:He was horrible to me.
SUPMALE:Becky, this is business.
SUPMALE:He's earned the right to work here.
OTHERMALE:I'm not going to fire him.

OTHERFEMALE:Mind if I smack you around? New guy tonight, huh? Yup.
OTHERMALE:What's his problem? There is no problem.
LEADFEMALE:Dean happens to be a really great guy.
LEADFEMALE:The kind of guy who doesn't make me wait for him.
SUPMALE:The kind of guy who asks me what I want to do.
SUPMALE:Maybe you can train him to treat you like crap.
LEADFEMALE:When are you going to run away? You hate Mark now? No, I'm just glad it's over.

SUPMALE:I did it in jayvee.
SUPMALE:There's no cartilage.
SUPMALE:That's bone on bone.

LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? She thought he was great.
SUPMALE:It was so obvious.
LEADMALE:He's what's known as the transition guy.
LEADFEMALE:Dead before he pulled into the driveway, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Better off forgetting all about Dustin.

LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
SUPMALE:He's the poor slob stuck in-between the first boyfriend and the next boyfriend.

LEADFEMALE:Nice boys.
LEADMALE:Won't be nicer than Dean.
LEADMALE:Well, you'll love them in a different way, Dan.
LEADMALE:You knew this guy was dead from the beginning? Why do you think I tried to unload the salt-free chips on him? In the future, please give me a clue before I let some strange guy listen to my knee.
LEADMALE:Here's the way it works, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:The next guy you hate, he's the keeper.
LEADFEMALE:I got a poker game.
SUPMALE:That's good.
SUPFEMALE:Get yourself out there.
OTHERFEMALE:Get on with your life.
LEADMALE:Well At least I'll know what to do When this happens with Darlene.
OTHERMALE:Look how cute you are.
LEADMALE:I hate this.
SUPFEMALE:Poor guy.
SUPMALE:Doesn't even have a clue.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, it's like somebody moved his food dish.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess we'd better get going.
LEADFEMALE:What are we doing tonight? Well, it was Crystal's pick, So she's got us going to some self-help seminars.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know how Crystal is lately.
OTHERFEMALE:She's a basket case, So she needs to network with other basket cases.

LEADFEMALE:Her car's out front.
LEADFEMALE:She's not home.
SUPMALE:Is she out with that Dean guy? I don't know if that's any of your business, Mark.
LEADMALE:I'm going to be in the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:You've told her I called? Yes, Mark.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'm sure.
SUPMALE:Are you calling me a liar? I got a husband and a boss.
LEADMALE:I have no need to lie to you.
LEADFEMALE:So why didn't she call me back then? Maybe she doesn't want to.
OTHERMALE:Maybe when she said it was over, it really was over.
LEADMALE:Like you had nothing to do with that either.
LEADFEMALE:You think she listens to me? You've always put me down, called me a jerk.
LEADMALE:And the more names I called you, the more I shelled out for birth control pills.
SUPFEMALE:You're the reason we broke up.
LEADFEMALE:If you'd treated me decent-I would've treated you like a king if you'd shown my daughter any respect.
LEADFEMALE:If once you'd thought about her before yourself, you wouldn't need to be trying to blame this on me.
SUPFEMALE:Quit wasting my time and get out of my house.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:You really nuked him.
SUPMALE:I don't know, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I've dreaming about laying into that punk for a yeah and a half.
LEADFEMALE:I finally get the chance, And I forgot to make fun of his hair.
SUPFEMALE:I wish you'd respect that I don't eat meat.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? This is pepperoni.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think an animal should die just to feed us.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, Darlene.
SUPMALE:This stuff's made of the hair, teeth, and tail.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing the little piggy can't live without.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Flowers for Becky Connor.
LEADFEMALE:O.

OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Listen to this-"Dear Becky, thinking of you first for a change.
SUPMALE:I love you, Mark.
LEADMALE:" Too little too late, huh, Becky? I'm going to find something to put these in.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, this is all your fault.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't have called her till you changed that card.
LEADFEMALE:He wouldn't have sent them flowers without your big speech about respect.
SUPMALE:If you'd fired him, he wouldn't be able to afford flowers.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Old stupid's coming back.
SUPMALE:We don't know that.
LEADMALE:Dad, thanks for not firing him.
LEADMALE:You were so right.
SUPFEMALE:And you thought he was a jerk.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Remember me? I played Dean in tonight's episode of Roseanne.
LEADMALE:Now, I don't know about you, but I thought Dean was the kind of character I'd like to see again.
SUPMALE:Mark, he's all wrong for Becky.
LEADMALE:And Dean can make her happy.
LEADMALE:There's no reason Becky couldn't fall in love with Dean.
SUPMALE:They just have to write it that way.
LEADMALE:If you feel like I do, let's bring Dean back.
LEADMALE:You can make a difference.
SUPMALE:Just drop a card or make a phone call-shouldn't you be washing my car? Hey, keep your pants on! I'm talking here! Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:
