LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey! What'd the doctor say? How's the baby? Well, she's doing great, and, uh--pretty weird She's bigger than normal.
SUPFEMALE:Go figure.
SUPMALE:Ha! And they say it's bad to live under power lines.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, first I felt weird for gaining 30 pounds.
SUPMALE:But now I figure most of that weight's the fetus.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Hello, Connor baby! Oh, man! That's four inches of fightin' fury.
OTHERMALE:Boy, this one really can kick.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yesterday, I got slapped in the head with my own boob.
LEADFEMALE:And we're gonna spoil you rotten, little girl.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, we are! $1,500 in the bank! We can afford to buy you food and water and maybe a shiny new table saw.
OTHERMALE:That's great, Dan, except that we owe the doctor $2,000.
OTHERMALE:What? We have to pre-pay the cost of having the baby.
LEADMALE:We didn't have to do that with the first batch.
LEADFEMALE:Well, back then we were broke and the county took care of it.
SUPMALE:That's why those kids were free.
LEADMALE:And apparently, you do get what you pay for.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we brought in all the groceries, but where does everything go? Well, the frozen stuff goes inthe freezer! And the canned stuff goes on the shelf.
LEADMALE:And that about covers it.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, it's gonna be tight.
LEADFEMALE:I wishwe would have invested better.
LEADMALE:Why, oh, why did we stop buying lottery tickets? Mom, Dad, we have got some amazing news.
LEADMALE:Mark and I were just looking for apartments, and we found, like, the cutest place to live.
LEADFEMALE:It was available right away, so we just took it.
OTHERFEMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Of course we'll miss having you around and all.
LEADMALE:Gee, Dan, I've never seen you this deliriously unhappy.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's the apartment at? Well, that's the best part.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not an apartment.
LEADFEMALE:It's a chance for us to buy something that's really ours.
SUPMALE:You're buying a house? How can you afford that? Because it's not a house.
SUPMALE:It is a trailer! It is, like, the cutest little trailer you have ever seen.
LEADMALE:Isn't this incredible? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well that's, like, the best news I've heard since you married Mark.
LEADFEMALE:** Aunt Jackie? Hmm? Didn't you wanna keep this? No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Family things need to be passed down.
LEADMALE:Now that's the chair I was telling you about.
LEADFEMALE:That's one of my favorites, but I want you to have that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why haven't I, like, seen it before? Um Oh, itworks in so many different rooms that lately we've just been keeping it in the garage.
OTHERMALE:Don't sit on that! No No, that's more just for looks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's certainly generous of you, Jackie.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe tomorrow you can bring by your beanless bean-bag chair.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just run that inside for ya.
LEADMALE:Hey, Beck, did you see the bathroom door? It slides into the wall! Shhhh! Just like Star Trek.
SUPFEMALE:No way! Aren't you gonna come see it, Mom? No, I hate the future.
LEADFEMALE:Man, oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:I'm beat.
LEADFEMALE:Hasn't this just been a great day? You sure are chipper? Yeah, well, you know, that's my way.
OTHERMALE:Your oldest daughter's leaving home.
LEADFEMALE:I just figured you'd be sad.
LEADMALE:Very, very, very, very very sad.
SUPFEMALE:It's not like she's leaving town.
SUPFEMALE:It's like she's gone camping for the rest of her life.
OTHERFEMALE:My turn.
SUPMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Remember our first place? Yeah, that was a dump.
LEADMALE:When are we movin' out of there? My sister is moving into a trailer park.
LEADMALE:I can't tell you where I was the day Kennedy was shot, but I will always remember this moment.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think it's so bad, Darlene.
SUPFEMALE:I mean it's like they're living in a house It's just got wheels.
LEADFEMALE:It's like living in your car only better, 'cause it's, you know, bigger.
LEADFEMALE:So it's kinda like living in a bus.
SUPMALE:Plus you got the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:So it's kinda like areallynice bus.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, pull the cord.
LEADMALE:I'm getting off.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't make fun of your sister living in a trailer.
LEADFEMALE:If it's good enough for carnival folk, it's good enough for the Connors.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! I certainly hope you're gonna clean this mess up when you're done.
LEADMALE:You were afraid there would be no stills nearby.
LEADMALE:So, are you the new owners of this dump? Do we look like we're made out of money? We rent.
LEADFEMALE:Where you from? We're from Europe.
SUPMALE:Unless you got a problem with that.
LEADMALE:We're the Connors.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Connors? Did you ever do time at Joliet? No, but I've got a question for you.
SUPMALE:Do you ever brush your teeth? Hey, that's personal information, missy.
OTHERFEMALE:We mind our own beeswax around here.
LEADMALE:Well, in that case, I'm not gonna ask if that's your kid sucking on the Windex bottle over there.
LEADMALE:Eddie? For God's sake, put that thing down! And you, you stay away fro my husband! Girls let's be neighborly.
LEADMALE:Unless, of course, you wanna swap.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Big hunk o-man.
LEADMALE:Listen, missy! We don't know you and we don't want to know you, and here's why! We're better than you! And we almost never get a chance to say that.
LEADFEMALE:Fine with me, sister! Here! It's some coupons and a map to get around the park.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the welcome wagon.
LEADMALE:Welcome, welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you ever feed my dog.
LEADMALE:If I get drunk enough, I'll fight your dog! Man, is she a snob.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:It won't kill us to help clean the place.
LEADFEMALE:Unless the wind picks up.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, everybody's back in the bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:So you might wanna hang out in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:'Cause we don't want the thing to tilt.
SUPFEMALE:Found the perfect spot.
OTHERMALE:I don't know about this, Roseanne.
OTHERMALE:I'm a little worried.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be fine, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:I told you it was a speed bump you hit, not a cat.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe Darlene's right.
LEADFEMALE:Becky doesn't belong in a trailer park.
LEADMALE:Well, we'll have them fix it up, you know? Maybe we can get them a van to use as a guest room.
SUPFEMALE:Becky! Mark! They'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Um, your Dad and I would like to offer to help you fix this place up a little.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make curtains, and your Dad can help you with the plumbing.
LEADFEMALE:And we'll get you a little fence-Security system.
LEADMALE:Or at least one of those little signs.
OTHERMALE:Aw, you guys, that's really sweet.
LEADFEMALE:But Mark and I don't want any help.
SUPMALE:It's really important for us to do this on our own.
LEADFEMALE:But there's so much to do.
LEADMALE:Yeah but eventually, over the years, it'll all get done.
LEADMALE:Well, you gotta let us give you something.
SUPFEMALE:What about a big-headed banjo-playing boy for the front porch? I said no.
LEADFEMALE:We want to do this ourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Think they're gonna be all right? It could be worse.
LEADMALE:They could be parked on a hill.
SUPMALE:Hey, Bob? I need you to put this carburetor back in the garbage truck after lunch.
LEADFEMALE:And be careful.
LEADFEMALE:It took me all morning to get it adjusted right.
LEADMALE:Jeez, Dan, I got a big lunch here.
OTHERFEMALE:I was kinda hoping to let it settle for a while.
LEADMALE:Fred, you mind helping him out? No problem.
LEADMALE:Listen, you guys, I need to talk to you about something.
LEADFEMALE:Becky and Mark's trailer Well, it's kind of a mess, right? And I want to be able to help them out, but they won't let me.
OTHERFEMALE:They probably just want to be alone.
LEADFEMALE:You know the old saying: "When the trailer's rockin'" Bob we're talking about my daughter here.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just saying that if it's rockin' you probably wanna level it.
SUPMALE:What are you getting at, Dan? Well, I know I'm asking a lot, but here it goes.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna give Mark all the overtimefor a while.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:I understand.
SUPFEMALE:It's gotta be tough for these kids starting out in life.
SUPFEMALE:If there's anything we can do to make their load a little lighter, it's gonna be our pleasure.
SUPMALE:Give me a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, guys.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mark? When you get done with that, can I see you for a second? Oh! Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:There's no work for Mark to do around here right now.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? What about the hydraulics on the garbage truck? I took care of it this morning.
LEADFEMALE:What about the school buses? We need them by Friday.
LEADMALE:It's all done, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:Damn! What the matter with you guys? We work for the city! Don't blame me, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't do squat.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but my daughter's livin' in a big mailbox! There's gotta be somethin' around here that needs fixin'.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I bet the bottom of this here table could use a little paint.
LEADMALE:Woopsie.
SUPFEMALE:Forget about paintin' this table, Dan.
LEADFEMALE:What about this carburetor? I think I'll explain this to Bob outside.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, Dan? Mark.
OTHERFEMALE:Good news.
LEADFEMALE:Got a little overtime for you.
LEADMALE:Look, I can't do any all week.
LEADFEMALE:I got a lot of stuff to do at the new place.
LEADMALE:Exactly! And that time-and-a-half couldn't come at a better time, could it? I'm sorry, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you offer it to one of the other guys? The other guys can't do it, Mark.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? Uhgarage quartet's got a gig at the County Fair.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Dan, it's not like I don't want the money.
SUPMALE:I really can't do any this week.
OTHERMALE:Okay? Dan.
SUPMALE:Weirdest thing.
LEADFEMALE:I just noticed the tail lights are all busted on that cop car out there.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with your foot, man? M-My foot? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:New shoes.
SUPFEMALE:Brad.
SUPFEMALE:Apparently, this week, it's not the right week to paint the table.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Oh? You, uh you might want to talk to Bob.
LEADFEMALE:Bob? Where's Bob? You're not gonna believe this, Dan.
LEADMALE:Some clown must've poured sugar in the gas tank of that school bus.
LEADMALE:Bob you--you can't fix somethin' like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are.
OTHERFEMALE:Candles.
SUPMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:Are these the regular kind or the fancy kind that keeps the bugs away? This is a special night.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the first time we're the hosts and you're the guests.
LEADMALE:Look, Dan.
OTHERMALE:It's the china we gave 'em for their wedding present.
SUPFEMALE:No, Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure the ones we give 'em didn't have these little compartments.
LEADFEMALE:Fancy.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Eat 'em quick.
OTHERFEMALE:In 15 minutes, the bats start comin' around.
OTHERFEMALE:This is great.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it is.
SUPMALE:Good food great setting.
LEADMALE:Makes me wish our kitchen didn't have some stupid house around it.
LEADMALE:Now, before we start Mark and I just want to say thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You guys were so great to put us up for so long.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Becky, those three years just flew by.
SUPMALE:We were only there for one.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
SUPMALE:Anyway, so far, setting up house has been a really great experience.
LEADMALE:Well, good.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, I should do my motherly duty and tell you how you can cut down on your food budget.
SUPMALE:Okay, say you get this recipe, you know, and it calls for lobster shrimp, and that expensive cookin' sherry? What you do is you just tear up that recipe.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:We've already figured out a couple of our own budget tricks.
LEADFEMALE:Like, these burgers? Cost 2.
OTHERMALE:79 for a pound of ground beef, but only $1.
OTHERMALE:19 for a pound of ground meat.
LEADFEMALE:You guys got any water? Oh, shoot.
OTHERFEMALE:I forgot to fill up the pitcher.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just run down to the community spigot.
LEADMALE:Your trailer doesn't have running water? Nah, the pipe was broken.
LEADMALE:I'll have enough saved up in a few weeks to buy a new one.
LEADMALE:No big deal.
SUPMALE:Whoa, Becky.
OTHERMALE:Don't forget the purification tablets.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Uh Where'd you get this salt shaker? Oh, it was in the trailer when we moved in.
OTHERFEMALE:The people before us left it.
LEADFEMALE:Man, that's amazing.
SUPFEMALE:This is not just-a regular salt shaker.
LEADMALE:This is-a Niagara Falls salt shaker.
LEADMALE:So? I mean, antique stores pay an arm and a leg for this kind of thing.
SUPFEMALE:I should just take it now, and go ahead and give ya Wow! Okay! And uh, you know, I was noticing your dad was checkin' out that antique hubcap over there.
SUPMALE:Huh? Oh! Yeah! Uh-That hubcap.
SUPMALE:That baby there, that's, uh-that's from a 1954, uh Fladler.
SUPFEMALE:Uh It's a classic.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see.
SUPMALE:Uh Give you, uh Ah, well, you know, that's the 1954 price.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta give 'em what it's worth today.
OTHERFEMALE:$60? $70? Hey, Becky.
LEADMALE:Why don't you run and get that water? Okay! Uh, are you sure it's gonna be okay? I mean, by herself? With the dogs and everything? Yeah, sure.
SUPFEMALE:As long as you bring that big stick, with the long nail in it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look.
LEADMALE:We told you guys.
LEADMALE:We don't want you to give us any money, remember? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, then can't you at least be a little less obvious about it? Excuse me? Come on, Dan.
SUPFEMALE:Helpin' us out with that overtime thing at the garage, that was good.
LEADFEMALE:But this antique hubcap thing, that's ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well-And besides, we don't need any.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Conner just made us $50 on that salt shaker.
LEADMALE:Oh, you figured out what we were doin' down at the garage, huh? Come on, Dan.
LEADMALE:What do you think I am, stupid? Remember, Dan.
LEADMALE:We're guests here.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:Don't tell Becky that I told you guys this, but-she feels like, for the past couple years, well, you guys, you've given us a lot.
OTHERMALE:Well, hey.
SUPFEMALE:We're family, you know.
LEADMALE:It's not like we're keeping some running tab of how much you owe us, in our top dresser drawer.
SUPMALE:And you know, with your baby comin' and everything, she feels like she doesn't want to be a drain on you any more.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why don't you just tell us that? Well, uh-See, uh-Becky told me that-well, you guys, you-you know, you love her so much that you'd insist on helping, even if-like, you couldn't afford to.
LEADFEMALE:Becky said that? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Got the water! Oh, Becky, that's so sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Can't believe how much stuff we're hauling outta here.
OTHERMALE:Remember that hamster you lost when you were 8? I think I found him.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:I always blamed that smell on Becky.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he won't be runnin' that wheel any time soon.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it weird to see this place all cleaned out? Like, the only thing left of you girls is that, uh, Wrigley Field sign up there.
OTHERFEMALE:You get that down for me? Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Seems like the sign's been up there forever.
SUPFEMALE:Hm.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, that gum really holds.
LEADMALE:Man, everything in this house sure is changing.
OTHERMALE:Kinda sad.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, not everything's changing.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we still got your dad, and the furniture, and-d.j. 's haircut.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you okay with this? I mean, another one of your kids movin' out? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I always knew you guys were gonna move out.
LEADMALE:I just-was hoping you wouldn't tell me where you were going.
LEADMALE:Can I ask you somethin', Darlene? What? Do you ever feel like your Dad and me didn't give you enough? What are you talking about? You didn't give us anything.
LEADMALE:No, I'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:You ever resent, like, not havin' a lot of stuff when you were younger? No.
LEADMALE:I used to steal a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys were great parents.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, we did have that one book and all.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you did the best you could.
LEADMALE:I mean-kids are expensive.
LEADFEMALE:Your food budget alone must have gone up by a tenth after you had us.
LEADMALE:Har I'm just worried maybe we didn't give you a good enough head start.
SUPMALE:You know? I always wanted to-have our kids do better than we did.
LEADMALE:And that should have been a realistic goal.
SUPMALE:Becky just-is takin' such a hard road.
LEADFEMALE:Eh, she's gonna be fine.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, she's strong, like you are.
LEADFEMALE:And that'll get her through whatever she has to go through.
LEADMALE:You think? Yeah! Definitely.
OTHERMALE:So what if Becky's livin' in a trailer? It's not like she's used to livin' in luxury.
OTHERMALE:You did that much for her! Yeah, it was a crazy plan when we came up with it, but it really worked.
SUPMALE:You know, Darlene, me and your Dad don't say this to you very often, 'cause, well, it never comes up.
LEADFEMALE:But-we're really proud of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Even though I'm secretly a high-priced call girl? Because you're a high-priced one.
SUPMALE:What the hell.
SUPFEMALE:Put that back up.
SUPMALE:** Watch it, buddy! I'm-I'm sorry, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Fishman.
LEADFEMALE:Fired! You sent for me, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Fishman? Hey, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Come sit down next to Uncle Mike.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I had a really good time working on the show this week.
SUPFEMALE:You're sweet, kid.
LEADMALE:You know later this season, the Conners are gonna get a French maid.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, I have to see you in the uniform first.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Fishman! I'm not tellin' you again! Keep your paws off the guest stars! There's a whole lot of man walkin' out that door right now.
LEADMALE:Stay away.
LEADFEMALE:He'll break your heart.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
OTHERFEMALE:I been there.
