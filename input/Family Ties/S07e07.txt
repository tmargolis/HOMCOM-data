LEADMALE:You don't drop it as much as Dad.
SUPMALE:That's true.
LEADMALE:I used to be a a pretty good ballplayer.
LEADFEMALE:For a girl.
LEADMALE:For a guy.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, all the females in this family are better athletes than the males.
LEADFEMALE:How 'bout you, Mal? Were you good, too? Well, you know, if I wanted to, I could have been a great athlete, Andy.

SUPMALE:I'm sitting here laughing and my husband's in surgery.
LEADMALE:That's okay, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing wrong with laughing.
LEADMALE:It helps to relieve the tension.
LEADMALE:Yeah, absolutely, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Look at Shakespeare.
OTHERMALE:Any time the going got rough in one of his plays, and the-and the tension was unbearable, big Bill would bring out some comic relief.
LEADFEMALE:You know, a clown, a-a buffoon, a fool.
OTHERFEMALE:There you guys are.
LEADFEMALE:Amazing.
LEADMALE:Life imitates art.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADMALE:It-it's very sweet of you to come, Skippy.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton, I would have been here sooner.
LEADFEMALE:They gave me wrong info down at the desk.
LEADFEMALE:Instead of Steven Keaton, they sent me to a Stephanie Kelton, who was in for a liposuction.
LEADFEMALE:What? It went extremely well, she looks great.
SUPMALE:I-In fact, as soon as she gets out, I'm invited to her house for an evening of aerobic dancing.
LEADMALE:Well, sit down, make yourself comfortable.
SUPMALE:I, uh, brought some things to cheer up Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton, and I didn't know what he wanted, so I brought an assortment.
SUPMALE:Here's flowers, chocolates, archery set, uh oh, and this Slinky is for you, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you don't mind it's slightly used.
LEADFEMALE:It's my dad's.

LEADMALE:The surgery is completed, and it went very well.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Doctor.
SUPMALE:If it's okay, - can-can we go see him? - No, no, no, not yet.
SUPMALE:He's in the coronary care unit.
LEADFEMALE:Everything looks good, but we have to go slowly.
SUPMALE:Now we have to wait and see how his heart adapts to the surgical procedure.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait, so-so it's not - really over yet? - No, no, not yet.
LEADMALE:The next few hours are going to be critical.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, thank you for your good work.
SUPMALE:His will to live is extraordinary.
LEADMALE:He obviously has a lot to live for.
SUPMALE:And I think I'm looking at it right now.
LEADMALE:Thank you.

LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Mom? We're all set to go, she's not here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, she had a bunch of meetings.
LEADFEMALE:She's probably stuck in traffic.
SUPMALE:Well, we sure can't go without her.
LEADMALE:We sure can't.
LEADMALE:She has the car.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean it wouldn't be fun unless we all go anyway.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the whole family.
LEADMALE:Well, it's sweet to hear you say that.
LEADMALE:All right, let's do it, let's go.
SUPMALE:We can't go yet.
LEADMALE:Mom's not back.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, but why-why can't we just, you know, leave her a note and catch a cab? Fine plan.
OTHERFEMALE:Ditch Mom.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what I meant.
LEADMALE:Well, no, that is what I meant.
LEADMALE:What does E.
LEADMALE:T.
LEADFEMALE:Stand for? It means "Elyse Tardy.

SUPMALE:" What does that mean? Over to you, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:It means not of this earth.

OTHERMALE:Think Mallory.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's it, Dad.
LEADMALE:I am not going! - Oh He's been doing this to me all day.

SUPFEMALE:Dad's gonna be a little slower for a while.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:Now remember, when Dad walks in, we have to act really nice, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What? What? Come on, what are you talking about? Well, let's face it, Alex.

LEADFEMALE:O-Okay, Dad, think about it.
LEADMALE:Sit yourself down, and you will be zooming from basement to attic in mere seconds.
LEADMALE:Alex, that is absolutely out of the question.
LEADMALE:We are not installing a chairlift in our house.

OTHERMALE:Are you okay? I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:You seem a little edgy with the kids.
LEADMALE:Well, excuse me, Elyse, if I'm not Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Congeniality.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a few things on my mind, okay? Well, if you've got to take it out on someone, why don't you take it out on me? I mean, they're just trying to help.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:In the hospital, all I could think about was how great it would feel to walk through that front door.
SUPMALE:Now that I'm here Why? This is where it happened.
LEADFEMALE:I fell right over here.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid every time I walk in this room, I'll think about it.
LEADMALE:I love this room.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you're gonna love this house.
SUPMALE:It's quite a charming fixer-upper.
SUPFEMALE:It's got four bedrooms, three bathrooms and there's a separate dining room over here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven, this is beautiful.
LEADMALE:Don't you think? Well, yeah, yeah, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Yes, it is.
SUPFEMALE:But don't you think it's also maybe a bit out of our price range? Oh, we can manage it now that you got that promotion.
SUPMALE:Steven just got a job as program manager at WKS.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Public television.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, public television.
LEADMALE:How nice.
LEADFEMALE:We don't get that.
LEADMALE:Channel 3.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, I know.
SUPFEMALE:We had it, but we asked to have it removed.
SUPMALE:Alex! Mallory! Come on in and look at the house! - So, this is going to be your third child.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? - Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:Well, good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Two children is something, but three can really put you in the poorhouse.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:Uh, you're quite a saleswoman.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mom, I've been doing some research in the neighborhood checking out resale values, property taxes and my conclusion is, is this house is wildly overpriced.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, aren't you a clever little fellow? How would you like a nice stick of gum? Don't change the subject, lady.
LEADMALE:You're $7,000 over, and you know it.
SUPFEMALE:Mommy! - Mommy! Mommy! - What is it, Mallory? I love this house.
OTHERFEMALE:You can see the mall from the front porch.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can put your room out there.
LEADMALE:Please, please, kids.
LEADMALE:I think we can handle this.
SUPMALE:$7,000 over? Are you sure? Were you happy with your tax return this year? What's the closet space look like? There's one in every room.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we can add on.
LEADMALE:Add on? You think it's that easy? Have you no sense of zoning laws? Building codes? Housing agreements? Oh, yeah? Richard Nixon has the cooties.
LEADFEMALE:That's quite a comeback, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Richard Nixon has the cooties, and Tricia Nixon wears bad pantsuits.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, your brother's going through a bad time.
OTHERMALE:Watergate.
LEADMALE:Watergate.
SUPFEMALE:Nixon's going to jail.
LEADMALE:That's it! They're sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to see the kitchen? - 
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Can we just talk together for a minute? Oh, sure.
SUPMALE:Sure, take your time.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be right in here with my ear to the door.
SUPFEMALE:I'm getting real good vibes about this place, Steven.
LEADMALE:Well, so am I, but she's got a lot of other houses to show us.
LEADMALE:I don't need to see any other houses.
SUPMALE:I mean, everything we need is right here.
OTHERMALE:All we need to do is open it up a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, can't you just see it? We can open up this stairway here, put in a great big bay window right here in front and oh, we'll get this fireplace working.
OTHERFEMALE:That shouldn't be too hard.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Steven, it-it could be wonderful.
SUPMALE:What? Nothing.
LEADMALE:It's just You're very beautiful when you get all architectural like that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I can just see our family sitting in this living room.
OTHERMALE:You and I holding each other.
SUPMALE:Mallory sitting on the sofa, talking on the phone.
SUPFEMALE:Alex on the sofa digging under cushions, trying to find loose change.
LEADFEMALE:Would you guys mind taking the small bedroom? Can I borrow some turtle food? Hey, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You're not the Epsteins.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, we're the Keatons.
SUPMALE:Hi, I'm Skippy Handleman from across the street.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Well, these are our children, Alex and Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Va-va-va-voom.
LEADFEMALE:Marry me! Marry me! Well? - Let's take it.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey! What am I gonna do, Elyse? What am I gonna be like? It's gonna be fine, honey.
SUPFEMALE:How do you know that? Well, you heard what the doctor said.
LEADMALE:I don't want to hear the word "doctor.
LEADMALE:" I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You heard what the man with the stethoscope said.
OTHERFEMALE:It's gonna take some time to readjust.
LEADMALE:What am I readjusting to? What kind of a what kind of a life am I gonna be living here? Well, the-the same kind of life you led before.
LEADFEMALE:You heard what they said they said an active and full life.
LEADFEMALE:What do they know? Doctors.
SUPMALE:Don't say "doctors.
LEADMALE:" You know what really worries me? Matt Pearson.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, well, he's been on everyone's mind.
LEADMALE:Who is he? Sales rep for PBS.
SUPMALE:Big, brash, full of life kind of guy.
OTHERMALE:Huge fan of my documentaries.
SUPMALE:I think his favorite was probably The 
SUPFEMALE:From River King to Croquette.
LEADMALE:Well, he sounds like one of our kind of people.
LEADMALE:Anyway, six months ago, he doesn't show up for the annual sales meeting.
LEADMALE:And, uh, I ask about him.
LEADMALE:Turns out he's had a heart attack.
LEADMALE:He's five years younger than me, Elyse.
SUPMALE:I saw him recently.
LEADMALE:Completely different guy.
SUPMALE:He looked terrible.
LEADMALE:Thin, tired, skittish.
LEADMALE:Scared of living.
LEADMALE:Told me his doctor said he was as good as new.
LEADMALE:He could do anything.
LEADFEMALE:But he's afraid.
LEADFEMALE:Afraid he's gonna get another heart attack.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you afraid? I am.
SUPFEMALE:Afraid of becoming another Matt Pearson; a living, passionless ghost.
LEADFEMALE:I need passion in my life, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Passion for the kids, passion for my work passion for you.
SUPMALE:Honey it's all still there.
LEADFEMALE:It's just gonna take some time.
OTHERMALE:I'm just thrilled with every minute I have with you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:On second thought, I don't think we're gonna have to worry about that passion coming back.
SUPFEMALE:Va-va-va-voom.
SUPMALE:
