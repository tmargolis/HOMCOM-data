LEADFEMALE: Hi, how you doing, Alex? Ooh! That's gross.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Next time I'll go in the garage, okay? Mom, what's for dinner? Soy meal and hearts-of-palm casserole.
LEADMALE:Again? I'm glad we only have three meals a day.
OTHERMALE:Alex, you promised to go in the garage.
LEADMALE:Honey, you've got a fever.
SUPFEMALE:You should take some aspirin and go right to bed after dinner.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:It's just a cold, Mom.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I can't go to bed early.
LEADFEMALE:Gotta hand in my term paper on the Declaration of Independence tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna be up all night working on this.
LEADMALE:Alex, you're sick.
LEADMALE:I'm sure your professor will understand if you turn it in late.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mom can write your teacher a note like she does for me.
LEADMALE:A note.
LEADMALE:This is not a book report onOur Friend the Policeman.
OTHERFEMALE:It wasOur Friend the Fireman, and I got an A on it.
LEADMALE:I can't believe Skippy.
SUPMALE:He just called me up and asked me if I wanted to go to the Van Halen concert with him on Sunday.
LEADMALE:What'd you say? I asked him if he'd sell me the tickets so I could go with a normal guy.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
SUPMALE:Alex, what's all that stuff? This "stuff," Mallory, as you so eloquently refer to these items, are two great treasures of American history.
SUPMALE:This is the famous John Trumbull painting of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and this, Mallory This is the Declaration of Independence.
LEADFEMALE:How'dyouget it? This is not the original, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hon! Hi! I'm glad you're home.
OTHERMALE:Mmm.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse, Alex, you remember Ed Nelson, PBS in Washington.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Good to see you.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Alex, talk to your dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you'll have more luck than I did in convincing him to come to Washington tomorrow morning.
LEADMALE:Ed, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:We've been over this.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? There's some important congressional hearings tomorrow involving funding for public broadcasting, and, uh, we need your husband to testify.
LEADMALE:In front of Congress? Dad, theCongress? Ed, I am flattered by the offer, but I told you, there are a lot of important things going on here tomorrow, and I just can't get away.
OTHERMALE:Right, Elyse? What's going on tomorrow that's so important? Heh.
LEADFEMALE:That haircut appointment.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Dad, you can't pass this up.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, this is big.
LEADFEMALE:Destiny is calling you.
OTHERMALE:See? Oh, hey, Alex.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Dad.
OTHERMALE:I just came to get some juice for your mother.
LEADMALE:She couldn't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:How come? The baby kicking? No, I was.
LEADFEMALE:I've been tossing and turning.
LEADMALE:This Washington thing, it's really been on my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Dad, come on.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be great.
LEADFEMALE:All right, okay, picture it.
SUPFEMALE:You're in the conference room.
LEADFEMALE:It's jammed with reporters, okay? Hanging on your every word.
SUPFEMALE:Flashbulbs popping all over.
LEADMALE:The, uh, chairman bangs his gavel.
LEADFEMALE:"Ha, ha!" you laugh defiantly, refusing to be silenced.
LEADFEMALE:Slow down! Alex, there are other station managers who are experienced at this sort of thing.
LEADMALE:I'm just not in their league.
LEADMALE:Dad, look.
LEADFEMALE:A- at the Continental Congress in 1776, Thomas Jefferson was a young guy.
OTHERFEMALE:An unknown face in the crowd, a complete nobody, just like you.
SUPMALE:And, uh, when John Adams asked him to write the Declaration of Independence, he must've been a little overwhelmed, just like you are.
OTHERFEMALE:But he said yes.
LEADMALE:Thomas Jefferson was a great man, Alex.
LEADMALE:I'm not a great man, I'm Steven Keaton.
LEADMALE:Dad, Thomas Jefferson wasn't Thomas Jefferson until he was Thomas Jefferson.
OTHERMALE:You know? He didn't know he was gonna be Thomas Jefferson.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, one day he was Thomas Jefferson, and the next day, he was I know.
LEADFEMALE:Thomas Jefferson.
LEADMALE:Yeah! Look.
SUPMALE:Great events make great men.
LEADFEMALE:Thomas Jefferson say that? Uh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Idid.
SUPMALE:Heh.
SUPFEMALE:See, Dad, if If Thomas Jefferson had given in to his fears, if he hadn't written the Declaration of Independence, they would've got somebody else.
OTHERMALE:Somebody less brilliant.
LEADMALE:Somebody less eloquent.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and without this masterpiece, Dad, the revolution might never have succeeded.
LEADMALE:Hediddo a nice job on it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, it was Jefferson's destiny to write the Declaration of Independence.
LEADMALE:Just like it's your destiny to go to Washington and testify.
LEADMALE:How do you know so much about people's destiny? That'smydestiny.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I appreciate what you're saying.
LEADFEMALE:I I really do.
SUPMALE:But I'm just gonna have to go with my instincts on this one.
LEADMALE:I'm not going to testify.
LEADFEMALE:Dad No.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you in the morning, son.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Try to get some sleep.
LEADMALE:Alex.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Alex, wake up.
SUPMALE:We got a lot of work to do.
LEADMALE:What? What? We gotta clean up in here, and then we gotta go clean the stable.
SUPMALE:Stable? Stable? What are you talking about? Skippy? Skippy, what's going on? Aah! Why? Why am I wearing these clothes? If you weren't, you'd be naked.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Uh, Skippy, w- what date is it? It's July 3rd.
SUPMALE:July 3rd, what? It's July 3rd, sir.
LEADMALE:No, Skippy, wha? What year is it? Skip Oh.
LEADMALE:It's 1776.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
OTHERMALE:I'm not used to it, either.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm still writing 1775 on my checks.
OTHERFEMALE:Good day, Mr.
SUPMALE:Jefferson, sir.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Skipford.
LEADMALE:Oh, young boy Stable boy.
LEADMALE:Uh, me? I just saw my horse tied to the post outside.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I've asked you numerous times to please put him inside the stable when it rains.
SUPFEMALE:The rain can damage his coat.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Thomas, I'm glad you're still here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hello, John.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Adams, sir.
LEADMALE:Thomas, I just did some informal polling of the other delegates, and I think the vote tomorrow is going to go our way.
LEADMALE:Independence from England! It'll be quite a day, John.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, it will.
SUPMALE:And the delegates also agree that you're the man to write the document which officially declares our independence from the king.
OTHERMALE:Will you do it? Skippy, pay attention.
LEADFEMALE:You are about to witness one of the greatest moments in the history of mankind.
LEADFEMALE:Never mind that.
LEADFEMALE:Betsy Ross' window shade is up.
LEADFEMALE:I am very honored to be asked to write this declaration, John, but my answer is no.
SUPMALE:Oh, come now, Thomas.
OTHERMALE:You're the finest writer amongst us and the most eloquent of thought, I daresay.
SUPFEMALE:Why, just the other day, you impressed us all so much with your talk about the natural rights of man, about liberty and self-government.
SUPFEMALE:That? That was nothing, John.
LEADMALE:I'd had a few glasses of ale, that's all.
LEADMALE:Come now, Thomas.
SUPFEMALE:This is no time for false modesty.
LEADMALE:I'm not being modest.
LEADMALE:I just have a lot to do tonight.
SUPMALE:I'm having my wig fluffed.
SUPFEMALE:What about John Hancock? He's very good.
SUPMALE:He writes in those nice big letters.
SUPMALE:Very easy to read.
SUPMALE:If you don't change your mind by morning, I'll ask him.
SUPMALE:Well, I think he's your man.
SUPMALE:Come on, John.
LEADFEMALE:I'll walk you to your horse.
LEADMALE:Wait Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Thomas Jefferson isn't gonna write the Declaration of Independence.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get busy.
OTHERMALE:Skippy, lookit, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:Without Jefferson's brilliance in that document, the revolution against England will fail.
LEADMALE:So what? I like England.
OTHERMALE:No, look.
SUPMALE:Skippy, uh I gotta do something.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, do you know where Jefferson lives? I live next door to the Jeffersons.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Take me there.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Uh-uh, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get me involved in this.
LEADMALE:I'm in enough trouble already for cracking that stupid bell.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Skippy the history of the nation, perhaps of mankind, depends on what we do in the next couple of hours.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello there, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Jefferson.
LEADMALE:Skipford.
SUPFEMALE:Wipe your feet.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.

LEADMALE:And how does a stable boy such as yourself come to know so much of these matters? I'm a history buff.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, sir, look.
LEADFEMALE:I I know what you're thinking.

OTHERFEMALE:You are a great man.
