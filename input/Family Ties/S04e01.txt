SUPFEMALE:"ALEX IN WONDERLAND.
LEADFEMALE:" WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO OUT TOMORROW NIGHT? OUT OF THE QUESTION.
SUPFEMALE:C-CARRIE, IT IS THE MAN'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE ADVANCES, A-AND -- AND IT'S THE WOMAN'S DUTY TO FIGHT HIM OFF.
LEADFEMALE:A-ANYWAY, IF WE WERE TO GO OUT, I SHOULD BE THE ONE TO ASK.
LEADMALE:OKAY.
LEADFEMALE:ASK.
OTHERFEMALE:WELL, I CAN'T ASK IF YOU'RE TELLING ME TO ASK.
OTHERFEMALE:I MEAN, THAT'S THE SAME AS YO ASKING ME.

LEADFEMALE:NEWMAN, HOW CAN YOU LET HER GO OUT WITH A GUY LIKE THAT? I TRUST CARRIE.
LEADMALE:I AM OPPOSED TO THIS DATE.
LEADMALE:I JUST WANT TO SAY, FOR THE RECORD, THAT I AM OPPOSED TO THIS.
LEADFEMALE:SO RECORDED.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE THING IS MY FAULT.
LEADMALE:I MEAN, IF I HAD GONE OUT WITH CARRIE, LIKE SHE ASKED ME TO, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO OUT WITH SOCIETAL DREGS.
OTHERMALE: ALEX IS JEALOUS.
OTHERMALE:YOU'RE DYING TO GO OUT WITH HER, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO DO IT.
SUPFEMALE:NO, NO, NO.
SUPFEMALE:THAT -- THAT -- THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.
LEADMALE:I'M GONNA ASK HER OUT.
LEADMALE:BUT NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO.
LEADMALE:I'LL DO IT BECAUSE DUTY CALLS ME.
SUPFEMALE:I OWE IT TO CARRIE TO SAVE HER FROM HERSELF.
LEADFEMALE:I'VE GOT TO BE STRONG FOR BOTH OF US.
LEADMALE:SHE IS -- IS A SHIP T-THAT HAS LOST HER WAY IN THE NIGHT AND I'M HER LIGHTHOUSE.
SUPMALE:I'VE GOT TO SHOW HER THE WAY.
LEADMALE:AND IF I SUCCEED, WE'LL BOTH BE BETTER HUMAN BEINGS AND BETTER CITIZENS.
LEADFEMALE:SOUNDS LIKE A FUN DATE.
LEADFEMALE: ALEX.
LEADFEMALE:I THOUGHT YOU WENT TO BED HOURS AGO.
LEADFEMALE:WHERE COULD SHE BE? I'M TELLING YOU, CARRIE IS HEADED FOR TROUBLE.
LEADFEMALE:SOMEONE HAS GOT TO SHOW HER HOW A PROPER YOUNG LADY SHOULD ACT.
OTHERFEMALE:LET ME GUESS WHO THAT SOMEONE SHOULD BE.
LEADMALE:I HAVE GOT OUR WHOLE DATE PLANNED.
SUPFEMALE:IT'S GONNA BE A VERY WHOLESOME EVENING.
LEADMALE:I THOUGHT WE'D START WITH A QUICK TRIP THROUGH THE ART MUSEUM.
LEADMALE:GOOD CHOICE.
SUPFEMALE:THEY'RE HAVING A WONDERFUL EXHIBIT ON THE RENAISSANCE NUDE.

SUPFEMALE:THEN, UH, I FIGURED WE'D TAIL THE BOOKMOBILE FOR A WHILE.
LEADMALE:AND IF TIME PERMITS, WE'LL GO TO THE ORPHANAGE, PASS OUT LOLLIPOPS.
SUPFEMALE:ALEX, YOU DON'T GO TO ANY OF THESE PLACES.
LEADMALE:WELL, I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR ME, MOM.
OTHERFEMALE:I'M DOING THIS FOR CARRIE.
OTHERFEMALE:WHY DON'T YOU JUST ADMIT THAT YOU WANT TO GO OUT WITH HER BECAUSE YOU LIKE HER? LIKE HER?  MOM, I AM DOING THIS BECAUSE I'M HER FRIEND.
SUPFEMALE:I AM NOT ROMANTICALLY ATTRACTED TO HER AT ALL.
LEADFEMALE: HI, ALEX.
LEADFEMALE: HI, CARRIE.

LEADMALE:SORRY, ALEX.
LEADMALE:NEXT TIME, I'LL JUST TAKE A SPONGE BATH.
SUPMALE:UH, DAD, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN THERE.
LEADMALE:I TOLD MALLORY TO LET ME KNOW AS SOON AS SHE CAME OUT.
SUPFEMALE:I GOT TO HAVE A SHOWER BEFORE MY DATE.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT TIME ARE YOU GOING OUT? JUST UNDER THREE HOURS.
LEADMALE:IF YOU HURRY, YOU'LL MAKE IT.
OTHERFEMALE:    I'M SORRY, ALEX.

LEADMALE:GO AHEAD.
LEADMALE:FINISH YOUR SHOWER.
LEADFEMALE:I'M TOO TENSE NOW.
SUPMALE:I MIGHT DROWN.
SUPMALE:TELL YOU WHAT -- WE CAN TAKE ONE TOGETHER, AND THEN I CAN SAVE YOU IF YOU START TO DROWN.
OTHERMALE:C-CARRIE, PLEASE, WILL YOU JUST GO IN AND TAKE YOUR SHOWER? I'D LIKE TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.
LEADFEMALE: OKAY, OKAY.

LEADMALE:DON'T YOU WANT TO GET CRAZY WITH ME? YEAH.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I MEAN, NO.
SUPMALE:NO! NO.
SUPMALE:WE CAN'T.
SUPFEMALE:WHY NOT? BECAUSE IT DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS NIGHT.
SUPMALE:WE CAN HAVE FUN WITHOUT HAVING FUN.
OTHERFEMALE:ALEX, YOU CAN'T TELL ME THIS IS A NORMAL DATE FOR YOU.
SUPMALE:THE PURPOSE OF TONIGHT WAS NOT TO HAVE A NORMAL DATE.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, YOU'VE SUCCEEDED THERE.
LEADFEMALE:THIS IS NOT THE ALEX THAT I WANTED TO GO OUT WITH.
SUPMALE:MY ALEX MADE ME LAUGH.
SUPMALE:HE MADE ME FEEL SPECIAL.
SUPMALE:AND I COULD MAKE HIM LAUGH AND FEEL SPECIAL.
SUPMALE:WHERE IS HE TONIGHT? THAT -- THAT ALEX HAS NO PLACE HERE.
LEADMALE:I'M HERE INSTEAD.
OTHERFEMALE:CARRIE, I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
SUPMALE:WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
LEADFEMALE:I'M TALKING ABOUT THE -- THE WAY YOU ACT, THE -- THE WAY YOU DRESS, THE WAY YOU TALK.
SUPMALE:YOU DON'T ACT LIKE A GIRL SHOULD ACT.
SUPFEMALE:Y-YOU SHOULD BE MORE LIKE SHERRY? WHAT IS WRONG WITH SHERRY? YOU PUT A BRAIN IN THAT HEAD, YOU GOT A REAL SPECIAL GIRL.
SUPMALE:SO THAT'S WHAT TONIGHT WAS ALL ABOUT? YOU WERE TRYING TO SHOW ME HOW TO BE A GOOD LITTLE GIRL? CARRIE, YOU'VE GOT TO SETTLE DOWN BEFORE YOU DO SOME DAMAGE.
LEADMALE:I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE SOME PRIDE, SOME SELF-RESPECT.
LEADMALE:I JUST WANT YOU TO SEE THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.
LEADFEMALE:YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.
SUPMALE:AND I'M GOING TO EXERCISE ONE OF THEM RIGHT NOW.
LEADMALE:SEE YOU 'ROUND, ALEX.
SUPMALE:OH, HI, ALEX.
LEADMALE:HI, DAD.
OTHERFEMALE:UP KIND OF LATE, AREN'T YOU?  TO BE HONEST, UH, I'M WAITING UP FOR MALLORY.
OTHERMALE:I KNOW IT'S OLD-FASHIONED, BUT, UH, EVERY TIME SHE GOES OUT WITH A NEW BOY, I CAN'T HELP WORRYING A LITTLE.
LEADFEMALE:I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
SUPMALE:THAT'S BECAUSE I USUALLY WORRY UPSTAIRS.
OTHERMALE:THERE'S A LOT MORE TO WORRY ABOUT WITH GIRLS THAN WITH BOYS, ISN'T THERE? NOT MORE WORRIES -- JUST, UH, DIFFERENT ONES.
LEADFEMALE:BUT YOU WOULD SAY THAT A GIRL HAS TO BE MORE CAREFUL THAN A GUY? YOU KNOW, WORRY MORE ABOUT HER REPUTATION, HER DEMEANOR, THE WAY SHE ACTS IN PUBLIC.
OTHERMALE:WHERE'S CARRIE? SHE WALKED OUT ON ME.
LEADFEMALE:ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS HELP HER, AND THAT'S THE THANKS I GET.
LEADMALE:MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE HELPED.
LEADFEMALE:MAYBE SHE'S, UH, HAPPY THE WAY SHE IS.
SUPMALE:WELL, MAYBE SHE'S HAPPY WITH IT, BUT I'M NOT.
LEADFEMALE: I GUESS THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM, ISN'T IT? MM-HMM.
SUPFEMALE:WHY AM I DRIVING MYSELF CRAZY? I MEAN, SHE'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.
SUPMALE:NOT LIKELY.
LEADMALE:I-I GUESS I BETTER JUST FORGET ABOUT HER, HUH? THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
LEADMALE:YEAH.
SUPMALE:YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADMALE:IT WOULD.
LEADFEMALE:THANKS, DAD.
SUPMALE:GOOD NIGHT.
LEADMALE:GOOD NIGHT, ALEX.
SUPFEMALE:WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO CHANGE? BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE WITH HER.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL LIKE WHEN CARRIE AND I ARE TOGETHER? I-I FEEL LIKE AN ASTRONAUT WHO NEVER WENT THROUGH THE TRAINING PROGRAM.
LEADFEMALE:I'M OUT THERE IN SOME OTHER WORLD, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FLY THE SHIP.
LEADMALE:WELL, THEN, UH YOU WERE LUCKY TO BE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOES.
OTHERFEMALE:YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADMALE:I AM LUCKY.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S PRETTY AMAZING OUT THERE.
OTHERFEMALE:I KNOW.
LEADMALE:I MARRIED AN ASTRONAUT MYSELF.
SUPFEMALE:UH, DAD IF, UH, BOYS AND GIRLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED THE SAME, HOW COME YOU'RE WAITING UP FOR MALLORY? 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY HOME.
SUPMALE:UH, WELL, UH  THINK I'LL FINISH MY WAITING UPSTAIRS.
LEADFEMALE:I JUST WANT TO SAY RIGHT OFF, I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAME BACK.
LEADMALE:I THINK I DO.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU WANTED TO TELL ME WHAT A JERK I WAS, H-HOW RUDE I WAS, HOW OBNOXIOUS, PRESUMPTUOUS, MANIPULATIVE.
LEADMALE:KEEP GOING.
LEADFEMALE:I THINK YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.
OTHERMALE:CARRIE, I-I AM SORRY.
LEADFEMALE:BOY, THIS EVENING REALLY BACKFIRED.
SUPFEMALE:I WANTED TO REFORM YOU, TO TURN YOU INTO A REAL LADY, AND INSTEAD INSTEAD WHAT? I THINK MAYBE YOU ALREADY ARE A LADY.
LEADMALE:IT'S JUST THAT Y-YOU'RE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LADY FROM THE KIND OF LADY THAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE WORD "LADY.
LEADMALE:" ALEX, WHAT IF I DECIDED TO BECOME THE GOOD LITTLE GIRL YOU WANT ME TO BE? DO YOU REALLY THINK EITHER OF US WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT? I DON'T KNOW.
LEADFEMALE:CARRIE, WE'RE SO DIFFERENT.
LEADFEMALE:WHY DO WE LIKE EACH OTHER SO MUCH? BECAUSE WE ARE SO DIFFERENT.
LEADMALE:BECAUSE WE SEE IN EACH OTHER SOMETHING WE DON'T SEE IN OURSELVES.
LEADFEMALE:AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT, ALEX.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WHAT WE WANT TO DO.
LEADFEMALE: I'M GLAD I ASKED.
LEADFEMALE:WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME TONIGHT? I ALREADY DID.
SUPMALE:NO, NO, NO.
LEADMALE:I MEAN, AGAIN.
OTHERMALE:IT'S STILL EARLY.
LEADFEMALE:I KNOW A REAL ROMANTIC PLACE.
SUPFEMALE:GREAT AMBIENCE.
LEADFEMALE:SOUNDS NICE.
LEADMALE:
