SUPMALE:don't be silly, Barbara.
SUPFEMALE:I told you yesterday he'll be no trouble at all.
LEADMALE:Ok, I'll see you Saturday.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPMALE:Who was that? That's my cousin Barbara.
OTHERMALE:She and dick are going out of town on Saturday.
LEADMALE:They wanted to know if we could baby-sit for little Kenneth.
LEADFEMALE:Why, are all the reform schools closed for the weekend? Steven, he's a perfectly well-behaved little boy.
LEADMALE:Elyse, we're talking about a kid who needed a police escort to nursery school.
SUPMALE:Come on, Steven, it will be fun.
SUPFEMALE:Alex and Mallory will be out of town.
SUPFEMALE:We'll have plenty of room.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, I have some very important work to get done on Saturday, plus I'm planning on watching the big Ohio state-Iowa game.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer and I will keep him out of your way.
OTHERFEMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:I just wish you'd consult me on these things first.
SUPMALE:I will from now on.
SUPMALE:I promise.
SUPMALE:It's not fair to impose on me.
LEADMALE:I mean, it is the weekend.
LEADMALE:You're absolutely right.
LEADMALE:I'm wrong.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, ok? Ok.
LEADFEMALE:I hope I wasn't too rough on you.
OTHERMALE:I hope Kenneth finds something in here he likes.
LEADFEMALE:This is all I could find out of Alex's old toys.
LEADFEMALE:He used to have a whole closet full.
SUPFEMALE:I think he sold the rest to an orphanage.
SUPMALE:Mom, will you talk to Alex, please? He says I can't go to Princeton with him this weekend.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I did not say that.
LEADFEMALE:All I said was that if she insists on tagging along to visit Jeff, she's going to have to abide by my rules.
LEADFEMALE:What rules? He told me I had to ride in the freight car.
LEADFEMALE:It is not a freight car.
SUPFEMALE:It's a baggage car.
LEADFEMALE:Alex! Look, I went to a lot of trouble to set up this interview with the Dean of admissions.
SUPMALE:This interview is pivotal to my future as a collegian.
LEADFEMALE:It is not a vacation junket for your personal amusement.
LEADMALE:Alex, we understand how important this interview is to you, but I think you ought to ease up on your restrictions a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I promise I will not annoy you for the entire weekend.
LEADMALE:How can I be so sure of that? You've never gone that long without annoying me before.
SUPMALE:I've never tried before.
LEADMALE:Look, Alex, I won't bother you.
SUPMALE:You won't even know I'm there.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:What should we wear on the train? Something collegiate! Yo, Jeff! Wow, 305 This is the place.
OTHERMALE:Wow! This is great! I love college.
LEADMALE:"Alex, I'll be back about 2:00.
LEADMALE:Make yourself comfortable.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff.
SUPMALE:" Alex, Jeff is going to be so surprised to see me.
LEADFEMALE:Are we going to wait here for him? No, are not going to do anything, Mallory.
SUPMALE:I am going to get settled here, walk around the campus, then go to my interview.
OTHERMALE:I got to get mentally prepared.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even want to see you until after the interview is over.
SUPFEMALE:Is that clear? I saw a poster for a dance tonight.
SUPMALE:I wonder if Jeff will take me to that.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think he will? You're really starting to get on my nerves, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:I brought a nice dress with me just in case.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex! This is so exciting! Mallory Listen, Mallory.
LEADMALE:I would very much like to be alone right now, ok? Why don't you go downstairs? Find what room you're going to be in.
LEADFEMALE:Get yourself settled.
SUPFEMALE:I should be gone by the time you get back.
LEADMALE:Mallory Please, I beg of you.
LEADMALE:Go away.
LEADMALE:Ok, I'll go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, listen, if Jeff comes back, don't tell him I'm here.
OTHERMALE:I want to surprise him.
OTHERFEMALE:How's it going? Uh Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Where's, uh You know The little prince? Kenneth is outside playing quietly with Jennifer, just where he's been since he first got here.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, don't rub it in.
SUPFEMALE:He's behaving very well.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I overreacted the other day.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess the memory of Kenneth's last visit was still fresh in my mind.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, Kenneth's last visit was uneventful.
LEADMALE:The fire department didn't think so.
SUPMALE:Relax, get your work done.
SUPMALE:Pretty soon you'll just forget he's even around.
LEADMALE:Ah! Gotcha! What happened? Kenneth shot me.
OTHERFEMALE:What? He was playing, and he snuck up on me, and he zapped me with a toy space gun! Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Should I take you to the pretend hospital? Mom, can we go now? Go where? Don't you remember? Today's mother's day at my ballet school.
LEADFEMALE:All the mothers will be there.
LEADMALE:Don't go! I mean, uh Can't you go some other time? Tomorrow? I forgot all about it, but I promised her, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I have to go.
SUPMALE:I'll go get my stuff.
SUPMALE:Well, if you must go, would you please take Kenneth with you? What would Kenneth do at a ballet class? The same thing he does here Cause misery and human suffering.
LEADMALE:That's enough, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:You are overreacting to the whole situation.
OTHERMALE:Ok, you're right.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, I'll see you in a little while, honey.
LEADMALE:Let's hope.
SUPMALE:Bye, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, honey.
LEADMALE:Kenneth! Hi, cousin Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Kenneth, I have to take Jennifer to ballet class.
SUPMALE:You play nicely while I'm gone? Don't worry about me.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be fine here with good old cousin Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye.
SUPMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Cousin Steven? Yes, Kenneth? I'm sorry for scaring you with the space gun.
OTHERMALE:I accept your apology, Kenneth.
SUPMALE:I know you have a lot of work to do, so I won't bother you anymore, ok? Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:I appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go outside and play with some of those toys.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe when I'm done here, I'll come out, and we can toss the softball around.
SUPFEMALE:How does that sound? Great! I'll go warm up! See you later! I swear Yum dum dum bum bum bum bum take me out to the crowd buy me some peanuts And cracker Jacks Alex! Hey, Jeff! How you doing, buddy? Good to see you! Great to see you! Try to stay off my roommate's side.

LEADFEMALE:Kenneth, it's fine! Fine, really.
LEADMALE:The buckeyes line up in the power I formation.
LEADMALE:Stopwood calls the signals.
LEADMALE:Kenneth! Stopwood fades to pass.
SUPFEMALE:He's in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:He laterals to sobrenko.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be over here! Sobrenko's at the 40! He breaks a tackle! At the 30! The 20! He's got one more man to beat! Go, go, go! Not you, Kenneth! Oops.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I got you something to eat.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.
LEADFEMALE:How are you feeling? I want to die.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess you're not up for a game of gin rummy then, huh? What a weekend.
OTHERFEMALE:I ruined your interview, I lost my boyfriend, I made a complete fool of myself in the process.
LEADFEMALE:Never before have I acted so stupidly and so selfishly.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Sure you have.
LEADMALE:I'm kidding.
SUPMALE:I'm just kidding.
LEADMALE:Come on, cheer up, will you? So, uh How did you and Jeff leave things? Well, there wasn't a whole lot we could say to each other.
LEADMALE:I mean, we did agree to see other people.
LEADMALE:It was stupid of me to go up there this weekend.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you try to stop me? What? Kidding.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just kidding.
LEADMALE:It's good that you can laugh about it.
SUPMALE:Despair does funny things to a woman.
OTHERMALE:Listen, uh Mallory You lost a boyfriend today, a good one, and I know you're upset, but let me tell you something.
LEADMALE:You're a very special person.
SUPFEMALE:You got a good heart, you got a good sense of humor, you're attractive, and, uh You're a lot smarter than I usually give you credit for.
LEADMALE:So, uh Don't you worry, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:There are a lot of guys out there who'd consider themselves lucky to even meet someone like you.
LEADMALE:It's true, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what in the world just possessed me to say all that, but, uh It is true.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I don't understand it.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'm surprised you're not angry with me after what I did to you today.
LEADMALE:Mallory, what would be the point in getting angry at you now? You were broken-hearted.
SUPFEMALE:You were in a weakened state.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll wait till you feel better.
SUPMALE:Then I'll really let you have it.
LEADMALE:No, I'm serious, Alex.
OTHERMALE:I ruined your college interview.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I practically destroyed your chances of getting into Princeton.
SUPFEMALE:What I did today may have damaged the course of your entire life.
LEADMALE:Because of me! Mallory, listen, I'm not angry now.
SUPFEMALE:But if you keep this up, I'm going to throw you off the train.
LEADFEMALE:But it's true.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand it myself.
LEADMALE:All I know is when I was up there in Dean memminger's office, and I saw you wandering across the campus delirious with grief, it really got to me.
OTHERMALE:All of a sudden, getting into Princeton didn't seem as important as helping you out.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're changing, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You may be right, Mallory.
LEADMALE:I really learned a lot about myself today.
LEADFEMALE:What? I always thought that I knew myself, you know, what I wanted, how I wanted to get it, but apparently, I was wrong.
LEADMALE:I am just going to have to face the cold, hard truth that underneath it all, like it or not, I'm just a helluva nice guy.
SUPMALE:Shut up and deal the cards.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:How about a game of hearts? Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Old maid? 
LEADFEMALE:
