LEADFEMALE:Honey, we've been through this before.
SUPMALE:If you pick Andrew up every time he cries, he's never gonna stop crying.
LEADMALE:Does that mean when he's 30, he'll still cry in his crib? Not if we bring him up right.
LEADMALE:Elyse, how can you be so cruel? He's only been alone for four minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Four minutes is a big chunk of his life, Elyse.

LEADMALE:I've got to get to sleep.
LEADMALE:We'll sing, we'll sing.

LEADMALE:Yeah, well, so am I, and I have to get up early to finish the homework that he ruined.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, we're doing the best we can.
LEADMALE:I have to get to sleep! But Andrew's just a baby.
LEADMALE:He's not keeping you up on purpose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm not so sure.

LEADFEMALE:Hey, the French toast is up.
LEADFEMALE:Come and get it.
LEADMALE:Uh maybe you could, uh, bring it over here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sure thing, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Elyse.

LEADFEMALE:I can't reach it.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey, honey, maybe you should take a sip of this coffee.
SUPFEMALE:Um, Mallory made it.
OTHERMALE:I think it'll perk you up.
SUPMALE:Whoa! I used five times the regular amount of beans.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Jennifer? Oh, I saw her upstairs before.
LEADFEMALE:She looked pretty upset.
LEADMALE:She thinks we've forgotten about her.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:We haven't forgotten about her.
LEADMALE:As soon as, uh mmm Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Jennifer gets down here, we're going to have a talk with her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you ask me, I think she's showing all the classic symptoms of regression syndrome.
LEADFEMALE:You know, in order to compete with Andy, she's acting much younger than she really is.
LEADMALE:Did Alex regress when I was born? Well, let's see, he was 2 Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:For a couple of weeks, he refused to tie his own tie.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder if I'll regress at all now that Andrew's born.
LEADMALE:You're at ground zero now, Mallory.
LEADMALE:You regress any more, you're gonna disappear.
OTHERFEMALE:We have a problem and we're gonna have to deal with it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, face the facts, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:When one has a baby late in life, there's a tendency to become obsessed with said infant.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, I don't think we're obsessed with said infant.
LEADMALE:What do you think, Steven? Steven? Good morning, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Jenny.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you feeling? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Um, Jennifer, I- let's discuss what happened last night.
LEADFEMALE:What happened last night? When you got mad and yelled at the baby.
SUPMALE:Oh, that.
OTHERMALE:I was just tired, that's all.
OTHERMALE:I'll see you guys later.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go eat breakfast over at Chrissie's house.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Very interesting.
LEADFEMALE:She's a fascinating subject, isn't she? She's not a subject.
LEADMALE:She's your sister.
SUPMALE:Look, I'm just trying to keep a detached professionalism about this, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Hate to admit it, but maybe Alex has a point.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she didn't even peek at Andrew when she came in here.
LEADFEMALE:All right, well, when she comes home today, then we'll just sit her down and have a talk.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't know, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:This whole thing could blow over.
LEADFEMALE:We could do more harm than good by having a whole big discussion about it.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely.
LEADMALE:All that's required here is a gesture of love.
SUPMALE:Slip her 100 bucks.
LEADMALE:You can't show love by giving someone money.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, give her leg warmers.
SUPMALE:Yeah, maybe we should pay more attention to her.
LEADMALE:You Make her feel more special.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Remember how she felt when we threw her that big birthday party? Maybe we could do something like that.
LEADMALE:Make her feel good again.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:We can.
SUPFEMALE:Let's give her a special night tonight.
LEADMALE:She can plan the whole evening.
LEADMALE:We'll have whatever she wants for dinner, we'll play games, it'll be fun for all of us.
LEADMALE:Keep 100 bucks handy, though, just in case.
LEADMALE:Mom, this cake is great.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I know you always like triple- layered chocolate-chip cake with double-fudge frosting.
LEADMALE:You know, I feel kind of funny about everybody making such a fuss over me tonight.
SUPMALE:Want us to stop? Nope.
LEADMALE:I'm loving it.
LEADMALE:It's our pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:Is there anything special you want to do after dessert? Let's play charades.
