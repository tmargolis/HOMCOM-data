SUPMALE:Guess you guys couldn't either, huh? Not since you got here.
SUPFEMALE:Hasn't mom come back yet, at all? Nope.
OTHERMALE:I Went down to the casino about two hours ago, she was still playing.
LEADMALE:You know, Dad, uh I kind of feel responsible for this.
LEADFEMALE:If I hadn't pushed you and Mom so hard to gamble, none of this would have happened.
LEADFEMALE:It's not really your fault, Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom went nuts.
OTHERMALE:Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I-I didn't expect you'd all be up.
OTHERMALE:We couldn't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Just come from the casino? I left the casino about an hour ago.
LEADMALE:The bottom fell out, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:So, uh I- I took a stroll along the boardwalk.
LEADMALE:Under the boardwalk You'll You'll forgive me if I'm not in the mood for a sing-along right now.
LEADMALE:I I forgive you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey, but I saw this coming.
LEADMALE:You got seduced by the thrill of getting rich quick, and you totally lost all perspective, you fell right into their trap.
SUPFEMALE:You win big for awhile, but inevitably the odds catch up with you.
SUPMALE:So how much did you lose? Oh Steven I won almost $2,000.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Mallory, if I'm dreaming, please don't wake me up.
LEADMALE:You have my word.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:You said Th The bottom falling out.
SUPMALE:It did fall out, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:An hour ago, I-I was sitting at that table, and I'd just won my 18th consecutive hand.
LEADFEMALE:And the dealer handed me a stack of chips that big.
OTHERFEMALE:There was more money than I'd ever seen in my life before.
LEADMALE:And at that moment, I never felt more empty or alone in my life.
SUPFEMALE:You weren't alone.
LEADFEMALE:You had the chips.
LEADMALE:Th Th Then I tried to think about what this weekend was supposed to mean.
LEADFEMALE:The conference, for one thing.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I-I had an opportunity to To present an exciting and innovative paper to my fellow architects.
LEADMALE:A paper I'd spent months preparing.
LEADFEMALE:And I gave it all away.
LEADFEMALE:And then I I thought about you guys and how I'd ignored you and mistreated you.
LEADMALE:I just turned away from my family so that I could win more money.
LEADMALE:It's okay, honey.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Mom what you did was terrible.
LEADFEMALE:We're rich! We're rich! It was so scary, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing I lived for was my next blackjack hand.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just call it temporary insanity.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm glad it's all over.
LEADMALE:Mom, you look awful.
LEADMALE:Let's get some room service up here, And then we'll all feel a lot better.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Jen.
LEADMALE:Do you want to call or should I? No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No room service.
SUPMALE:Why not, Mom? We're rich.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah No, see, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:We are not rich.
LEADMALE:We are not even well-to-do.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, We are not high rollers like you are.
OTHERFEMALE:To us, 2000 bucks is rich.
LEADMALE:No, but you see, this money isn't ours anymore.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? Well, after I left the blackjack table, I- I put the money in the hotel safe and I went for a stroll on the boardwalk.
SUPFEMALE:And about a mile away I found a Midnight Mission, and I went in, and I pledged $2000 to them.
LEADFEMALE:All of this? No.
LEADFEMALE:This is 1800.
OTHERFEMALE:We owe the other 200.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see if I hear you correctly, Elyse.
LEADMALE:You won $1800 playing blackjack, and we are in debt for $200 to the Midnight Mission.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:We're poor.
OTHERMALE:We're poor.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, Let's not panic here.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think any pledge made at 3:30 in the morning is legally binding in the state of New Jersey.
LEADMALE:It is binding, Alex, because I pledged it.
LEADMALE:They don't know you here, Mom.
SUPMALE:We can put a fake mustache on ya and sneak you across the state line.
LEADMALE:You make a father proud, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see? I- I had to do this.
SUPFEMALE:I- I had to do something to get rid of that terrible feeling that I had.
LEADMALE:If If I kept this money, I'd have never felt good about myself again.
SUPFEMALE:This is tainted money! There is no such thing as tainted money, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, that's enough.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you all understand.
SUPFEMALE:We do, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:If you felt that strongly about it, then giving away that money was absolutely the right You gave it all away? You did the right thing.
LEADMALE:You did the right thing.
OTHERMALE:Right, kids? We're with you, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Is the mission still open? 'Cause I could go over there and talk to the guy.
LEADFEMALE:You did the right thing, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I love you all so much.
SUPMALE:I'm still hungry.
LEADMALE:Do you still have those coupons, Dad? 
LEADFEMALE:
