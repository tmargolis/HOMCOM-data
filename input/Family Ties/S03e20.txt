OTHERFEMALE:The car dealers close in an hour.
LEADMALE:What kind of car you thinking of buying? A sports car.
SUPFEMALE:A station wagon.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, the whole reason for buying a new car is to have more room for the baby.
LEADMALE:What would be the point of buying a sports car? I'd look great in one.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mallory, they'd be crazy to let you drive the new car, anyway.
LEADMALE:I happen to be a good driver, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I passed my road test on the third try, and I almost passed on the second try.
OTHERMALE:And she could have if the examiner hadn't been thrown from the car.

LEADFEMALE:You two are the most competitive guys I know.

LEADFEMALE:And we're gonna be rich! Right.
OTHERMALE:And we're gonna split everything down the 
SUPMALE:54, 46.
SUPMALE:Keaton, I recognize that look in your eye.
LEADFEMALE:What look? That competitive look, like when we were teammates in that bicycle race and you kept trying to ride away from me off in your own direction.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jarrett, I saw a shortcut.
SUPMALE:We were on a tandem bike.
LEADFEMALE:And so basically, what we offer is a biweekly tutorial on those subjects you're not performing up to your top standards in.
SUPFEMALE:That's great, but what I really need help in is my schoolwork.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's what "tutorial" means, William.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, I'll see you guys Tuesday, then, huh? Hey, by the way, where do I go? Uh, well, the tutorial will take place here, William.

LEADFEMALE:It looks like a refrigerator on wheels.
LEADMALE:I wanted to get the Panther 4000 Turbo XK.
SUPMALE:It does zero to 100 in two seconds.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, I don't like buying a car that requires a parachute to slow down.
LEADMALE:I heard the Wagonmaster's a real nice car, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it is a beauty, James.
LEADFEMALE:The salesman says it seats eight comfortably and, uh, ten uncomfortably.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go check on Andy.
SUPFEMALE:It's time for his bath.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'll come with you, Elyse.

LEADFEMALE:Robin.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Robin.
LEADFEMALE:Right! Robin! Alex, let's be honest with each other.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's safe to say that Robin is a girl that one might consider to be attractive.
OTHERMALE:Really? Yeah, okay, now that you mention it, I I can see how one might find her attractive Sensuous Incredibly erotic.
LEADFEMALE:Though, personally, I hadn't noticed.
SUPMALE:I hadn't either, but, you know, if two guys are trying to run a business and they were to compete over something like, say, a girl Oh, pfft! It could destroy the whole foundation of their partnership.
LEADMALE:Of course it could, so, uh So they shouldn't compete.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:So let's not.
OTHERMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:Let's, uh Let's remain cool.
LEADMALE:Detached.
OTHERMALE:Professional.
SUPFEMALE:Professional.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Professional.
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Robin! Gee, I had completely forgotten it was your night tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Enter.
LEADFEMALE:Enter.
OTHERMALE:Well, I brought my economics and my poetry books.
LEADFEMALE:Who's gonna tutor me first? I am.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it doesn't matter to me.
LEADFEMALE:All I know is that when I study, whatever I do last stays with me best.
LEADFEMALE:Then, uh Then do poetry first.
SUPFEMALE:Do poetry, take your time.
LEADMALE:I'll be, uh, back in, what, roughly 40 minutes.
LEADMALE:James, that is really funny.
OTHERMALE:See, I bet you never thought that Aleksandr Pushkin was such an amusing poet.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, but I always suspected it.
LEADFEMALE:Forty minutes.
SUPMALE:Time's up.
LEADMALE:Alex, that could not have been 40 minutes.
SUPMALE:You guys run a tight ship here.
OTHERFEMALE:Evidently, though we seem to be a little lacking in professional courtesy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm professional, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:I don't giggle when I tutor.
LEADFEMALE:You know, James is really wonderful.
SUPMALE:He is? He is one of the brightest and most interesting people I've met since I've been at Leland.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, uh Yeah.
SUPMALE:He does make a good first impression, in a superficial sort of way.
OTHERFEMALE:Although I-I think you'll find that I'm pretty bright and amusing in my own right, only with more depth.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure I will.
LEADMALE:Uh, uh, Robin, uh would you like to go out with me tomorrow night? That's really nice of you to ask, Alex, but James already invited me to a poetry reading tomorrow night.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe him! Great! Great.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Alex, can I use the phone in the other room? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Go Go ahead.
LEADMALE:Forgot a book.
OTHERMALE:How could you? I just forgot it, that's all.
LEADMALE:Nah, nah, nah.
LEADMALE:You forgot more than a book.
LEADMALE:You forgot our agreement.
LEADMALE:You asked her out! And so did you! How did you know? I was listening at the door.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:How dare you.
LEADMALE:That's it, Jarrett.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Our partnership is over.
OTHERFEMALE:Suits me just fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah It was an ant.
OTHERMALE:"And make certain to unfasten your seat belt beforegetting out of the car.
LEADMALE:" Dad, how much longer do we have to do this? There's only one more section to go.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:"Your trunk and welcome to it.
OTHERMALE:" Oh, Steven! Dad! Dad! That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:I cannot handle it anymore.
LEADMALE:Now, where are you going? Thought I'd drive the new car over to Chrissie's house.
SUPMALE:Oh, she's kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Ohlbeck! She got the new Panther Turbo.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:I specifically set aside this time to play with the baby, and he's asleep.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mom, I love that kid, but he's inconsiderate.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you've been in a bad mood all day.
SUPMALE:What's your problem? It's you, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Nah, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It's not you.
OTHERFEMALE:It was just a reflex.
LEADMALE:It's James.
SUPMALE:What happened? Oh, Dad, you're not gonna believe this when you hear it.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, are you ready for this? He invited Robin Green to a poetry reading.
SUPFEMALE:And he always seemed so nice.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, Dad, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:You see, she's one of our tutees.
SUPMALE:Who's your other T? Ah Anyway You see, James and I are both attracted to this girl.
LEADMALE:So we made a gentleman's agreement not to ask her out.
SUPFEMALE:Why? It's obvious, Elyse, without such a contract, they might compete for her and destroy their friendship in the process.
SUPFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:They should be stronger than that.
SUPMALE:Well, Elyse, the male ego is a very fragile thing.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's stupid.
LEADMALE:I'm hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm surprised that James would do such a thing.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, me too, but he did.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now, how did you find out about this? Well, because, uh, she told me when I asked her out for tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if you asked her out, then you are just as guilty as James.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not true, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I only asked her out because I suspected that James had asked her out, which he had.
LEADFEMALE:I- it was entirely a defensive move on my part.
SUPFEMALE:And had we gone out, it It would have been purely a A preemptive tactical date.
SUPMALE:How romantic.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, no way! I'm tired.
OTHERMALE:I don't wanna play now.
LEADMALE:Coming, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, uh, Mallory, listen.
LEADMALE:You gotta help me out with something.
LEADFEMALE:You're, uh, sort of a girl.
SUPFEMALE:James and I are both attracted to the same girl.
LEADMALE:Now, what would you do if you had two good-looking, intelligent guys interested in you? What's that got to do with you and James? Come on, Mallory.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Look, if a guy was interested in me, I'd wanna know about it.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Look, all you can do is express how you feel.
LEADMALE:And if you and Robin are meant to be together, it'll happen naturally.
OTHERFEMALE:Just be yourself.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:See, that's a That's a very sensitive, perceptive point, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:I read it inCosmopolitan.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, well! Robin, James.
LEADFEMALE:What a surprise.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I never miss a poetry reading.
LEADFEMALE:I have season tickets.
LEADMALE:May I have your attention, please.
OTHERMALE:This evening, the poetry club is pleased to have with us the Horace Newton award-winner for poetry, Zane Axelrod.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Axelrod is one of the best, the most incomprehensible poets of his generation.
SUPMALE:Where are the chairs? Just sit on the floor, Alex.
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:The floor.
LEADMALE:Bohemians.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Axelrod.

LEADMALE:The fragments of our unfulfillment.
SUPMALE:Boom! Boom! Boom! Bomb shelters Whatever happened to "Hickory Dickory Dock"? Shh! This is art, Alex, something you obviously know nothing about.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Don't, uh Don't Don't pretend to be Mr.
SUPMALE:Culture.
LEADFEMALE:You're only here for one reason, and you know it.
SUPMALE:Born pure and tarnished by distrust, or born tarnished, searching for a shine? Boom.
OTHERMALE:Boom.
SUPMALE:Sha-boom.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you'd be so low as to just barge in on my date.
OTHERMALE:Ah! A date! A date.
LEADFEMALE:So you admit it's a date.
LEADMALE:I admit nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you get lost, Keaton.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? Who's gonna make me? I am! No, I am.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, this is a private discussion, so, uh, you want to just stick to your stupid poetry? Oh, yeah? Well, I'm rubber and you're glue.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.
LEADFEMALE:This guy's good.
LEADFEMALE:What is it with you two? A few weeks ago, you seemed so mature.
OTHERFEMALE:And now you've turned into a couple of third graders.
LEADMALE:He did first! Oh, did not! Look, Robin, we both obviously like you a lot, and I think the ball is in your court now.
LEADMALE:Look, Robin, you can settle this whole thing right now by just saying which one of us you like better.
SUPFEMALE:I never had the chance to find out! I hardly know either of you, and And all of a sudden I'm in the middle of some kind of tug of war.
LEADMALE:I don't enjoy being the object of some adolescent competition, and until the two of you grow up, I don't want to spend any more time with either of you.
LEADFEMALE:I still haven't got the baby seat in.
LEADMALE:I wanna swing by the hardware store and get an acetylene torch and a power wrench.
LEADMALE:I have to take out the back seat.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, that's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Bet we wouldn't have this problem with the Maserati.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Alex, I'm glad you're here.
LEADFEMALE:We need the Volvo to go shopping.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dad, uh, still hasn't figured out the new car yet, huh? You got it.
LEADMALE:All set, let's go.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex, he, uh Andrew needs to be changed.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Wa No! Mom, Mom, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Don't do this to me, Mom! I've only had one lesson, Mom All right.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Andy, it's just you and me.
OTHERFEMALE:Bear with me.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:I know this seems like a great deal to you, but, uh you know, you're gonna have to give it up sooner or later.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Just try and stay in that position.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's you.
LEADMALE:What do you want? I just came by to pick up some of my books.
LEADFEMALE:Well, come in and get 'em.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm gardening.
SUPFEMALE:What does it look like I'm doing? I'm changing Andrew.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Need any help? No, I don't need any help.
LEADMALE:I am perfectly capable Could you, uh, hold this leg and, uh, grab a diaper? How could you bust up my date like that? Aw, hey! You shouldn't have been on that date in the first place.
LEADMALE:Gimme the powder.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's the powder, and you shouldn't have asked her out either.
LEADMALE:Hey, I only asked her out because I knew you were gonna ask her out, which you did.
LEADMALE:Pins.
SUPFEMALE:And I only asked her out because I knew you were going to.
LEADMALE:And you did.
LEADMALE:Here are the pins.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, uh, thanks to you, I made a fool of myself.
SUPFEMALE:I made a fool out of myself too.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, uh all done here.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't look right.
LEADMALE:No, let's try again.
SUPMALE:You know, Alex, when I left the poetry reading, I took a walk down Foxwood Road past the Little League field.
LEADFEMALE:Remember that team we used to play on? Wilson's House of Fine Lingerie? We had the nicest uniforms in the league.
SUPFEMALE:Lace cuffs.
LEADFEMALE:See-through jerseys.
LEADMALE:When I was standing there, I thought of all the stuff we've been through 
LEADFEMALE:all the Cub Scout meetings, the camping trips, the low-interest loans you've given me.
OTHERMALE:We're supposed to be friends, Alex.
LEADMALE:Why are we always competing? Competition is the backbone of our relationship, James.
LEADMALE:I mean, we just push each other to do better.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, okay.
LEADMALE:Moment of truth.
SUPMALE:You want to put your finger right there? Here? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
