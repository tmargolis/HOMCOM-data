LEADFEMALE:Monica Dillon is gonna be here in an hour and, uh, the two of you don't fit into our plans.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, where are we supposed to go? Go to the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Go anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:But Mallory's not allowed to use the car, Alex.
LEADMALE:Remember? She's being punished for using it when she wasn't supposed to last week.
SUPMALE:I'm in charge, and, uh, your punishment's suspended.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Jennifer, you go with her, okay? But I don't want to go to the mall.

SUPMALE:Oh, hi, Alex.
SUPMALE:Hey, Skip, listen, guy, uh, I don't think this is a good time for one of our little chats, okay? Is Monica Dillon coming over? You got it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, uh, I gotta speak to Mallory before I go.
LEADFEMALE:I I got us a couple of tickets to the NCAA chess semifinals.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I I want to invite her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Skip, she just left.
OTHERFEMALE:Although if you hurry, you may be able to catch her.
SUPFEMALE:You know, usually it takes her to back out of the driveway.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, hey, Mallory! It's me! It's Skippy! Uh, do you want to go out with me Friday night? She She stopped.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's considering it.
LEADFEMALE:Um, you know that telephone pole out there? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It smashed into our car.
LEADMALE:I I'll check for damage.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, the car! Oh, the car.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad's car.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, how could you do that? You know you're not supposed to be driving.
LEADFEMALE:You're You're being punished.
LEADFEMALE:What am I gonna do, Alex? We have to get that fixed before Dad gets back.
SUPFEMALE:How are we gonna pay for that? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:There's gotta be three hundred dollars damage to that car.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know where we're gonna come up with that kind of money.
SUPMALE:Uh, good news.
LEADFEMALE:The telephone pole's okay.
OTHERMALE:Look, Skippy, uh, we've got a little problem here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, maybe you could come back another time.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't know where I'm gonna go.
SUPMALE:I can't go home.
LEADMALE:Why not? It's jammed with people.
SUPFEMALE:My whole family's here for the big Leland homecoming game.
LEADFEMALE:They're making me sleep in the garage.
LEADMALE:Unless you guys don't want to rent me a room, huh? Not while I'm alive.
LEADMALE:Skippy, why, uh? Why aren't your relatives staying in a hotel? Because there isn't one available room between here and the state line.
LEADFEMALE:Hm.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, there is.
LEADMALE:Alex, no.
LEADFEMALE:If there really is a shortage of rooms, it seems to me that somebody who had a room to rent out this weekend could really make a killing.
LEADMALE:Or at least enough to buy a new fender, if you get my drift.
OTHERMALE:Alex, no.
LEADMALE:Well, Alex has a point.
SUPMALE:There's a lot of money to be made.
LEADMALE:My dad's charging his cousins $45 a night.
SUPMALE:But Alex, it's wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course it's wrong, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Seventy-five a night is right.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:It's wrong, and I'm telling you you can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what if Mom and Dad find out? What if Mom and Dad see the piece of modern art you turned their car into? Do it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, the, uh, ad is in the paper.
SUPFEMALE:What's our state of readiness, Skipper? All systems are go, chief.
LEADFEMALE:The baby's room is in a state of rental preparedness.
LEADMALE:It still feels weird to me, renting out a room in our own house.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Jen, don't Don't think of it as renting.
SUPFEMALE:All we're doing is letting strangers use a room in our home for money.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I think? Don't ask the impossible, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I think that Mom and Dad would not approve of this.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Mallory.
LEADMALE:You underestimate our parents.
SUPMALE:Now, they are thoughtful, generous people, and I think they'd be thrilled to know we were using their home to To shelter weary travelers.
SUPFEMALE:You mean we're gonna tell them? What are you, crazy? Uh, hi.
SUPFEMALE:We've come about the room.
LEADFEMALE:Come right in.
OTHERFEMALE:Come right in.

SUPFEMALE:You know, you can't get a room in this entire town.
LEADMALE:Do tell.
LEADMALE:I I'll get that.

OTHERMALE:I'll give you 80.
LEADMALE:Eighty? Eighty.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the way I do business.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you offend me.
LEADFEMALE:The Driscolls were here first, and they should get the room.
LEADMALE:Make it 90.
LEADMALE:I'm not as offended anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Do something, Jack.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna sleep in the car again.
SUPMALE:We slept in the car last year for homecoming.
LEADMALE:I still have ashtray marks on my neck.
SUPFEMALE:Ninety-five.

OTHERMALE:Ninety-seven.
SUPFEMALE:Ninety-eight! Ninety-eight fifty.
SUPMALE:Ninety-nine! Ninety-nine! Wait a minute.

OTHERMALE:"Okay.
LEADFEMALE:" Jennifer, I think it's a little better than okay.
SUPFEMALE:The car is being fixed, we, uh We have enough money to pay for it, and we've got a little money left over for ourselves.
OTHERFEMALE:How much left over? Don't you worry your pretty little head about it, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:Let Alex handle all the big old nasty financial details.

SUPFEMALE:I just locked the door.
SUPFEMALE:There is no more bathroom for these people.
LEADFEMALE:No more bathroom for these people? That's hardly a motto for a hotel, Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:This is not a hotel, Alex.

LEADFEMALE:Spilled milk on the rug.
LEADFEMALE:Broken dish.
LEADFEMALE:There was a kangaroo in my living room.
SUPMALE:He was just here for the party, Dad.
LEADMALE:Then I guess I'm overreacting.
OTHERMALE:Dad, if you just give us a chance, we can explain everything.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, can you? Can you explain the valet parking in the driveway? The flashing "Vacancy" sign in front of the house? The billboard on Route 41? Look, Dad, I just I I just lost my head, you know? When the When the money started rolling in, I got out of control.

SUPMALE:Dad, I need help.
LEADFEMALE:Um, Dad, I guess most of this was my fault.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I shouldn't have been driving the car at night without your permission.
LEADFEMALE:And Alex and Jennifer were just trying to help pay for the car damage.
OTHERMALE:They're really not to blame.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess it's my fault too.
SUPFEMALE:I shouldn't have asked Mallory to take me over to Krissy's house when I wasn't supposed to go.

OTHERFEMALE:I was immature, I was irresponsible and, uh And I was greedy.
