LEADMALE:Well, maybe he forgot it was on.
SUPMALE:What am I saying? He has to see it.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to the coin fair on Saturday.
LEADMALE:Why don't you go in and start watching, and when Alex gets here, he'll join you.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no! That's not how it works.
OTHERMALE:We always watch it from the beginning.
SUPFEMALE:We like to sing the theme song.

LEADMALE:Andy's in there waiting for you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Couldn't be helped, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Couldn't be helped.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a big psychology lecture.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't want to miss it.
LEADFEMALE:You know me.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:What was it about? A favorite professor of mine was lecturing on the cognitive powers of African baboons.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it sounds interesting.
LEADFEMALE:Why was Alex there? Because I'm a very supportive boyfriend, Mom.
SUPMALE:Lauren's interests are my interests.
SUPFEMALE:She wanted me to be there, so I went.
LEADMALE:Means a lot to her.
SUPMALE:I'm impressed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm kidding.
SUPMALE:I'm kidding.
SUPFEMALE:I'm kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, hurry! Wall Street Week is starting! Ooh, listen, uh, I'm going to skip it today, okay, pal? But I already made the popcorn, and the cash register's all heated up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, uh, you know, Lauren's here, so But we always watch it together.
LEADMALE:Well, I know we do, but, uh, Lauren's not always here.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, she is.
SUPMALE:So, Lauren, how-how's your psychology study coming? Oh, I think it's going very Oh, very, very well.
SUPMALE:Very well.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, she's doing a fantastic job.
LEADFEMALE:Have you decided to have Alex committed yet? Want to go in the other room and play, Alex? No, not-not not right now, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:But we always play before dinner.
SUPMALE:I know, I know, Andy, but we don't always have company.
SUPMALE:You know, Lauren, I was reading a little Jung yesterday, and I was really fascinated by his use of dreams in psychoanalysis.
SUPMALE:Can you analyze dreams? Can she analyze dreams? She she's like Carnac.
LEADMALE:Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, show 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:Analyze something.
LEADFEMALE:You know, um I had a dream last night.
LEADMALE:I I, uh I-I did, I did.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh I I was walking down the street, and suddenly, I noticed, um, I didn't have any clothes on.
LEADFEMALE:That's gross, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:S-So, I just, uh I just ran around, hiding behind cars, trying to find my clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Was I in this dream? Um, well, yes you were.
LEADMALE:You were playing racquetball with Dwight Eisenhower.
LEADMALE:But, but, oh let's-let's stick to my part.
SUPFEMALE:Uh What do you make of this, Lauren? Is there any hope for my dad? Well, dream analysis is very complex.
LEADMALE:Um but if I had to take an educated guess, I would say that this dream shows that your Dad's trying to hide something.
SUPFEMALE:And there's a part of him he doesn't want anyone to see, which is probably why he has that beard.
LEADMALE:Or maybe not.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no - I'm just a student! - No, no, that's fine.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I can be completely wrong.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I know I am.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're No, you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Obviously.
LEADMALE:How about this, Lauren? Is she my little Miss Freud or what? And she can take a perfectly innocent-looking dream about a man running around naked while his wife plays racquetball with a former president, and use it to prove that that same man has deep-seated abnormalities.
LEADFEMALE:Abnormali? What's abnormal? - All I did was look for my clothes! - 
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Steven, uh, Steven, can-can we talk about this in private? Of course! Of cour Why? Are you worried? Well, I It's I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I-I I just want you to tell me what / was wearing.
SUPFEMALE:A lovely sunflowered tennis dress.
LEADMALE:Uh, ruffles; very pretty.
LEADFEMALE:And-and President Eisenhower? The same dress.
SUPFEMALE:And were you furious! Time to play yet? Uh, uh, no, no, not yet, Andy.
LEADMALE:I had a dream.
LEADFEMALE:It was really weird.
LEADFEMALE:I I was in the mall, and, uh, and I went into my favorite store, and I bought this I bought this really beautiful red leather jacket that I've wanted for the last two months.
LEADMALE:What do you think that could mean? I think it means you really wanted to buy the jacket.

SUPFEMALE:Now I'm really depressed.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how are you feeling, Andy? Hi, Andy.
SUPMALE:Andy don't worry about Alex.

SUPMALE:Uh, okay, look, when I'm around Lauren I want to hug her, you know? I want to kiss her.
LEADMALE:We do that, too.
LEADMALE:She eats all her vegetables and she goes to bed on time.
LEADFEMALE:She wins.
LEADMALE:Look, Andy it's not a matter of winning or losing in this case but only in this case.

SUPMALE:It doesn't? - Look we're still gonna spend time together.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, we're still gonna have fun.
