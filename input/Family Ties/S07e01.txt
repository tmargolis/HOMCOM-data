SUPMALE:All right, who did this? This is the most regressive, childish, immature thing I have ever seen in my life.
SUPMALE:I did the teeth.
LEADFEMALE:I did the mustache.
SUPMALE:I did the beard.
SUPMALE:Who did the antennas? I think he always had those, honey.
LEADFEMALE:-The man was crying out for antennas! I had a Magic Marker.
LEADMALE:Who could resist? Hey, what's going on? I mean, I could barely hear myself blow-dry my hair.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you wouldn't be interested, Mal; we're talking about the election.
LEADMALE:Oh, really, Alex? Are you forgetting something? I'm voting this year.
LEADMALE:Nick and I went down and registered.
SUPMALE:I guess this means they've abolished that literacy requirement.
LEADMALE:Have you decided who you're voting for, Mallory? - No, not yet.
SUPMALE:Well, honey, we've got some Dukakis literature upstairs, if you're interested.
LEADMALE:I have some Bush literature that I think is very helpful in defining the differences between the two candidates.
LEADFEMALE:Dentists also use it when they run out of Novocain.
LEADMALE:Can you vote? Can you vote? Alex, Alex, listen! What are you Sorry to interrupt your quiet morning at home.
OTHERMALE:Uh, sorry, we, uh, we get a little passionate around here - come election time.
SUPFEMALE:Well, have you decided who you're gonna vote for, Lauren? - Because we have some literature upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mom, Mom, Mom.
SUPMALE:Just give me a little bit of credit here, okay? Lauren and I have discussed the issue, and I think she feels the same way as I do about this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you've really got her under your thumb, son.
SUPMALE:Andy, you you want to get Lauren another one of those Bush T-shirts? Okay, but I think we're out of mediums.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not gonna vote for Bush.
LEADFEMALE:For one, I've never fully accepted his explanation of his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
SUPMALE:Bush had an affair? Well, not-not really, Mal.
OTHERMALE:The Iran-Contra scandal.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, Dad "scandal" is a loaded word.
LEADFEMALE:Y-You're right, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:The Iran-Contra prank.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, he had an affair in Iran? - This is the kind of political back-and-forth we have here.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, listen Hold it, hold it, hold it! Wait a minute! That is enough election talk.
LEADFEMALE:For the past month, it's been nothing but Dukakis-Bush around here.
SUPMALE:And, you know, I think we care more about the election than they do.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we ought to get away from this media hype for a while, huh? Go somewhere where there's no television, no radio, no telephone Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Breathe, breathe.
LEADFEMALE:Um, look, um Do you guys remember those weekend camping trips we used to take up to the Sandusky campgrounds? Oh, oh, I loved those weekends.
LEADFEMALE:Friday, we'd leave after dinner, and we'd drive all through the night.
SUPMALE:And my favorite part was in the car.
SUPMALE:We'd play word games and we'd sing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERMALE:Guys.
OTHERMALE:I think we know where you're going with this.
LEADMALE:Well, what do you say? Let's do it again, this weekend.
SUPFEMALE:Um, I can't make it this weekend, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, camping was fun when we were younger, but that's when I was wearing Earth shoes.
LEADFEMALE:And I have a history report on Ancient Greece I want to get started on.
SUPMALE:Well, okay.
LEADMALE:It was just a thought.
LEADMALE:Well, hey, just the two of us can go.
LEADMALE:We can still have fun, despite these spoilsports.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Elyse.
LEADMALE:It won't be any fun with just the two of us.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it'll be too much fun with just the two of us.
LEADMALE:Coming.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what are you guys up to, huh? Well, I'm trying to get Lauren to wear this T-shirt.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know that guy.
LEADMALE:I know who that is.
LEADFEMALE:I I seen him on TV.
OTHERMALE:That's, uh Orville Redenbacher.
LEADFEMALE:This is George Bush.
SUPFEMALE:You're voting this year, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:You're supposed to know this stuff.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, how how are you gonna decide who you're gonna vote for this year? Uh, you know, I'm not too sure.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna have to leave it up to Mel; she's the brains behind this couple.
SUPMALE:I weep for this nation.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Well, hey, what's going on here, huh? Oh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton and Andy and I are going camping this weekend.
OTHERFEMALE:Just the three of you? Everybody else is busy.
SUPMALE:It's no big deal.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, you guys all ready to go? Yeah, I think so.
SUPMALE:Let me just check this list again, see if we've got everything.
LEADMALE:Uh, tent? - Oh, check.
LEADMALE:Flashlight? - Check.
LEADFEMALE:Family? - Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
OTHERMALE:Never mind.
LEADMALE:Dad, are you really upset about us not going? Oh, no! Don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:I was just kidding.
OTHERMALE:No big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, you guys are all busy.
SUPMALE:You have your own lives to lead.
LEADMALE:What about me? Do I have my own life? You're too young to have your own life.
SUPFEMALE:The last thing we want to do is make you guys feel guilty.
OTHERMALE:Absolutely.
OTHERMALE:Let your conscience be your guide.
LEADMALE:Not you, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, could you give me a ride to my apartment? Oh, sure thing, Lauren.
OTHERFEMALE:God knows we've got enough room in the car.
LEADFEMALE:Just kidding! Kidding! All right, on we go, campers.
LEADFEMALE:On, you huskies! - You watch the house.
SUPFEMALE:Just take it with you, okay? Just take it.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:Drive safely.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:See you later, guys.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:See you.
SUPMALE:I don't feel guilty.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, me neither.
LEADFEMALE:They need some bonding time with Andy anyway.
SUPFEMALE:And camping trips are always such a mess.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Alex, remember that time you got poison ivy and nobody wanted to sit next to you on the way home? How could I not remember that? You don't forget driving 200 miles strapped to a ski rack.
LEADFEMALE:It's always cold at night, and the tent's always collapsing.
LEADMALE:Yeah, or it rains.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you get sick.
SUPMALE:That's funny.
SUPMALE:You know, when I was a kid, I always wanted my parents to take me camping.
LEADMALE:I mean, they took me to the woods once, but they just left me there and went home.
OTHERFEMALE:I Anyway, I always imagined sitting out there at night around the campfire.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody being together, cuddling up to stay warm.
LEADMALE:Roasting marshmallows.
LEADMALE:Well, it seemed like it could be fun.
LEADMALE:Sometimes it was nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, like when Mom would play her guitar.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, or we'd just sit and look at the stars.
SUPMALE:I I found ten dollars in the woods once.
SUPFEMALE:We should've gone.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it's true.
SUPFEMALE:And, you know, Mom and Dad they're getting old.
SUPMALE:They're deteriorating rapidly.
LEADMALE:All they've got left are their memories.
LEADMALE:Memories.
LEADFEMALE:Like the corners of their minds.
LEADMALE:I think we should go out there and surprise them.
SUPMALE:Misty water-colored memories.
LEADFEMALE:That is a great idea, Jen.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna go get the sleeping bags.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll get the road maps.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Alex, do you think we could speed it up a little bit? I have to be back for my graduation in two years.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, I am not about to go hot-rodding around for your amusement.
SUPFEMALE:We're only going 35.
SUPFEMALE:An old woman just passed us.
OTHERFEMALE:That's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Let that old woman drive as fast as she wants.
SUPFEMALE:She was on foot.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, come on, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I can't wait to get up there and see Mom and Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, they're gonna be surprised to see us.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially me.
OTHERMALE:I hope they don't scream or anything.
SUPMALE:Look, why don't you all just relax, okay? Enjoy the drive.
OTHERFEMALE:The freedom and exhilaration of the open road, the wind flowing through your hair.
SUPMALE:There's no wind at this speed.
LEADFEMALE:It's really deserted out here.
SUPFEMALE:Where are we? Um I don't know, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, let me see that map.
LEADFEMALE:All righty.
LEADMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:This is a map of Ancient Greece, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
OTHERMALE:Uh-oh? Uh-oh, what uh-oh? I had the maps right next to my history homework.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I must have taken the wrong one.
OTHERMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:How are we supposed to know where we are? I'd say we're about 50 miles from downtown Sparta.
SUPMALE:Well, let's do something.
SUPFEMALE:Like what? Anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, remember what we used to do during those long rides down to the campgrounds? Hold Jennifer out the window? No, no, not that.
LEADFEMALE:No, we used to play the word games and stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Oh-oh, hey, hey, I got one.
LEADFEMALE:How about 20 Questions? You know, where somebody thinks of a person, and everybody else has Okay, okay, okay, I'll start.
LEADMALE:Okay, I've got someone! Okay, ask away.
OTHERMALE:Okay, is this person living or dead? Neither.
LEADMALE:I see hours of fun-filled entertainment ahead.
SUPFEMALE:It's not really a person, it's more of a thing.
OTHERMALE:Like a fictional character or something? Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:Is it Mickey Mouse? Yes! Oh, are we perfect for each other, or what? It's like we're sending telepathic messages to each other that nobody else can hear.
LEADMALE:I'm sure no one's trying to listen in.
OTHERMALE:What was that? - I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'll check it out.
LEADMALE:You got a flashlight? Yeah, we have one in here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good, it doesn't work.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I've got something that lights up.
OTHERFEMALE:My compact! - All right, Mel, give him the compact.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, we got big trouble.
LEADMALE:What-what is it? - It's the generator.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:For crying not the generator.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
OTHERMALE:What does the generator do? Well, without the generator, the battery's dead.
LEADMALE:You know, we're not moving.
LEADMALE:Well, let's look at the bright 
LEADMALE:We have plenty of time for 20 Questions.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, okay, I've got one.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, all right.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's really cold.
LEADFEMALE:How long have we been out here? About 45 minutes.
SUPMALE:I can't believe we haven't seen a car.
SUPFEMALE:We're not going to.
SUPMALE:This road only goes up to Sandusky, and if you were going camping, you'd be there already.
OTHERFEMALE:No, our only hope is to be rescued by some other guilty children.
LEADMALE:It's so dark out here.
OTHERMALE:I've never seen it this dark.
SUPFEMALE:It's kind of scary.
SUPMALE:I miss the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we can't just stand out here all night, and it's too cold to sit in the car without the heater working.
OTHERMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:What else can we do? I think we should go for help.
LEADMALE:Out here at night? I know it's dangerous, but I think we've got to try.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I agree.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck, Jenny.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, I'll go with you, Jenny, all right? All right, that's all right, that's all right, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:That's all right, I'll go, I'll go.
SUPFEMALE:After all, she is my sister; I got to protect her.
SUPMALE:Oh, here, take my compact case.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, this will come in handy in case we have to do any emergency eye-lining.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, and, uh, stay in sight of the road, huh? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, they always say that in those teenage horror movies just before somebody gets hacked up.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, you got the map? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Okay, we'll just head this way, towards the Parthenon.
SUPMALE:I hope they'll be all right.
LEADMALE:You really care about him, don't you? Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I just want my compact back.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, hey, come on.
LEADMALE:I know how you guys are.
LEADFEMALE:You make fun of each other and everything, but deep down you guys really care about each other.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that's what makes you Keatons such a tight family.
SUPMALE:Hope I'm in a family like that someday.
LEADMALE:Well, you will be, Nick.
SUPMALE:Someday we'll get married.
OTHERMALE:That is if we're not eaten by a coyote - or bear first.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:No coyote or bear's gonna keep me from marrying you.
SUPMALE:It's your father I'm worried about.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, listen, Nick.
LEADMALE:As long as we're out here, I want to tell you something my father told me.
SUPMALE:But he made me promise never to tell you, so you can't let him know I told you.
LEADMALE:Shoot.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:One day, completely out of the blue, he says to me, "Mallory, "I guess it's not totally inconceivable that you could've done worse than Nick.
LEADFEMALE:" You think he really meant it? I do, Nick, I really do.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, God.
LEADFEMALE:And all this time, I thought he didn't like me.
SUPFEMALE:It's beautiful, isn't it? Yeah, I'll say.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you look up, up at them stars, and you just can't help thinking.
LEADMALE:Thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, sometimes you are so deep.
LEADMALE:Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:Mating season has already begun.
SUPMALE:What happened? How come you guys are back? Well, we got a little ways up the road and we saw this sign, Great.
LEADFEMALE:Now what? Well, I guess we could set up camp here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, let's set up camp here.
LEADMALE:What are we, the Swiss Family Robinson? This is all right.
LEADFEMALE:Clean air, smell of pine, the moon high above, the thrill of being at one with nature.
OTHERMALE:God, what I wouldn't give for a Holiday Inn.
OTHERMALE:Oh, stop whining, Gumby.
LEADFEMALE:We should've gone with Mom and Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, what would've been the big deal? I know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was kind of selfish, I mean, when you think of all that they've done for us.
SUPFEMALE:It's all gonna come back to us, Jen.
LEADMALE:One day, we'll be asking our kids to go places with us, and they'll tell us they're too busy.
SUPMALE:It's not gonna happen with mine, Mal.
SUPMALE:Oh, it happens to every kid and their parents, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Nope, nope, not mine.
LEADFEMALE:No, my kids are gonna be on a straight commission basis.
LEADFEMALE:Two dollars for a hug.
OTHERFEMALE:Five dollars for a kiss.
SUPMALE:And for an "I don't want to go to Aunt Mallory's house," of American Tourister luggage.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we're not gonna be like that with our kids.
LEADMALE:Are we, Nick? - Mm-mm, no way.
OTHERFEMALE:Our kids are gonna love us whether we give them luggage or not.
OTHERMALE:We're gonna be very close to Nick Jr.
OTHERMALE:And Nicolette Jr.
SUPFEMALE:Or little Mallory and little Mallomar.
LEADFEMALE:Mallomar? Make that a hundred bucks for not wanting to go to Aunt Mallory's house.
SUPMALE:I bet Mom and Dad and Andy are having a great time right now.
LEADFEMALE:They're probably roasting marshmallows.
LEADMALE:Uh, Dad's probably doing that, uh, Indian moon dance he's so fond of.
LEADFEMALE:The one where he's kind of a cross between Geronimo and Ginger Rogers.
SUPFEMALE:They're probably starting in on "A Hundred Bottles of Beer on the Wall" right now.
LEADMALE:By now, we'd probably be on to your version.
SUPFEMALE:What's your version, Mal? Oh, it's silly, Nick.
OTHERFEMALE:That never stopped you before.
SUPMALE:Do it, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Well Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Shh! Car, car.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, don't interrupt the song.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey, hey! - The car! Hey, hey, hey! It's Mom and Dad! It's Mom and Dad! - It's Mom and Dad! - I know who it is, hey! What are you doing here? - What's happening? Why are you here? - Wait, wait.
LEADMALE:All right, hey, hold it.
LEADFEMALE:One at a time.
SUPMALE:What are you guys doing here? We were on our way up to Sandusky.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we were gonna surprise you, but the car broke down.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's so sweet.
LEADMALE:You guys are great.
SUPMALE:Well, what are you guys doing here? Well oh, I don't know, I guess it just didn't feel right up there without you.
SUPMALE:It didn't have that good old-time family feeling.
OTHERMALE:There was no one to heckle my Indian moon dance.
LEADMALE:I heckled.
LEADFEMALE:So did I.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it just wasn't the same.
SUPMALE:I guess we missed you guys.
LEADFEMALE:Oh-ho, hey, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:We missed you, too.
OTHERMALE:Oh, good, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:That-that that means a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, hey, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? - Look, uh, I know how you feel about me.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, I mean, let's put it this way.
SUPMALE:It's not totally inconceivable that Mallory could've done worse than me.
SUPFEMALE:You told him.
LEADMALE:Just drop everything right here.
LEADMALE:We can straighten it all up in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this turned out great.
SUPFEMALE:We logged over 500 miles, - and not a marshmallow was roasted.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I hope we didn't make you feel like you had to follow us up there.
LEADFEMALE:It's just some crazy idea we had.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, Mom, it was our fault.
LEADMALE:We should've gone with you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we felt guilty about not going up there in the first place.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, maybe next time.
SUPFEMALE:You mean, we have to do this again? It's usually not this bad, Andy, believe me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, normally we sit around the fire, we have a nice big dinner beans out of little tin cups.
OTHERFEMALE:Which reminds me, I'm really hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:Jen, check it out, I got something here for you.
LEADFEMALE:Ew, what's that? Well, it's just like beef jerky, but it's only healthier.
OTHERMALE:It's turkey jerky.
SUPMALE:See, I-I keep it in my pocket, and by the end of the day, it's cooked.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just stick with the marshmallows.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, we're camping.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh I notice there's a full moon out there tonight.
LEADFEMALE:No, Dad, no! - No, no! - Please, no, no.
LEADMALE:I'm just okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:Oh, you know what? I'm kind of glad this camping trip didn't work out.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, look at how much fun we're having.
LEADFEMALE:You can't plan moments like this.
LEADFEMALE:They've got to sneak up on you.
LEADMALE:I know what you mean; it's like if you've got a big party to go to and you buy a very special outfit, maybe a plaid skirt with a black blouse No, no, no! Uh, a lavender suit with a matching scarf with paisley - with a little bit of - Mal, Mal, Mal.
OTHERMALE:Just kind of move it along.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right and anyway, um, you get to the party, and it's not that great.
SUPFEMALE:But on the way home, uh, you see a beautiful moon, or a big orange cat comes and rubs itself up against your leg.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, or a complete stranger leaps out of the darkness and gives you a stock tip.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, exactly.
LEADMALE:Anyway, just for a minute, it's a special moment.
OTHERFEMALE:You could never have planned it.
LEADFEMALE:Is this a special moment? You bet it is, pal.
LEADFEMALE:Very special.
SUPMALE:That reminds me of something that John Lennon once said.
LEADMALE:"Life is what happens to you when you're busy making other plans.
SUPFEMALE:" John who? Oh, boy, do I feel old.
LEADFEMALE:One of the Beatles, honey.
LEADMALE:What are the Beatles? Oh, no, now I feel old.
LEADFEMALE:
