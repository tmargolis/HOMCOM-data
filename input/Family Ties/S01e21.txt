LEADFEMALE:The championships are only three days away.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be on television.
SUPFEMALE:I've got to be prepared.
LEADMALE:Now, come on, just one more.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you're violating child-labor laws.
SUPFEMALE:Please! I love it when you beg.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, clear those books off the table.
LEADMALE:We've got to get dinner going.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, mom, I really don't want to break my concentration.
LEADMALE:Why don't you guys go out for dinner? Here's a couple of bucks.
SUPMALE:Alex! Sorry, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just excited about the quiz-off, that's all.
SUPMALE:Oh, me too.
LEADMALE:In fact, this morning, I dropped off my plans for the set at the station.
LEADFEMALE:How did daddy like them? Well, he didn't have a chance to see them yet, but I know he's gonna love my ideas.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, Jennifer, hit me with a literature question, please.
LEADMALE:Okay, but this is the last one.
SUPFEMALE:In act five, scene five, of "MacBeth," MacBeth reflects on the nature of life.
LEADFEMALE:Quote the passage exactly.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:That's a tough one.
SUPFEMALE:G-give me a second.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi, gang.
LEADMALE:Hi, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dad.
LEADMALE:Hey, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:How you doing today? "Life's but a walking shadow.
SUPMALE:"A poor player that struts "and frets his hour upon the stage, "and then is heard no more.
SUPFEMALE:"It is a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
LEADMALE:" He seems a little depressed.
OTHERMALE:He's practicing for the tournament finals.
OTHERMALE:So, what did you think of my set designs? Well, um I-it's a little elaborate, isn't it? I was thinking more along the lines of the kind of set we used last year.
LEADFEMALE:Well, last year's set was so dull.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe.
LEADFEMALE:I it I-I-it's hard for me to talk about the plans without having them in front of me.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad I left them at the office.
OTHERMALE:Good luck.
LEADMALE:I happen to have an extra copy right here.
LEADMALE:What a break.
LEADMALE:Uh, I'll I'll get that.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Uh, just a second.
SUPMALE:Alex, it's for you.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Ted.
LEADMALE:What? What do you mean you can't make it Sunday? So what?! I-it's not even life-threatening until it gets up to 105.
LEADFEMALE:You can make it, Ted.
LEADFEMALE:Come on! Ted! Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.
SUPMALE:No, I didn't mean to excite him.
SUPMALE:Listen, if Ted regains consciousness, could you have him Hello? Great! Just great! Ted Quinn can't make the finals on Sunday.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Some gibberish about infectious pneumonia.
SUPFEMALE:And now our team is a man short.
SUPMALE:What about your friend, Susan aronson? She's very bright.
LEADMALE:No good, dad.
LEADFEMALE:She's in the 11th grade.
OTHERFEMALE:Each team must consist of one player from the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades.
LEADFEMALE:Where am I gonna find an incredibly bright, informed, quick-thinking 10th grader by Sunday? Alex? I know we don't usually get along, but it hurts me to see you in a desperate situation like this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in 10th grade.
LEADFEMALE:I'm willing to be on your team.
LEADMALE:Maybe if we set Ted up in a glass booth, he wouldn't infect anyone.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Alex, I'd be good! You? Yes, her! Alex, what is this? Do you think you're the only one in this house who's interested in academic challenge? Yeah, I love academic challenges.
OTHERMALE:Besides, it's gonna be on television! There's an exchange student from Brazil who's pretty bright.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, by any chance, could you ask some of the questions in Portuguese? I'll adapt.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Petey, one more question.
OTHERFEMALE:Grover Cleveland was elected to the presidency twice, in 1884 and again in 1892.
SUPFEMALE:Who was Cleveland's secretary of the treasury, during his second term? Uh, petey, I don't I don't think this is gonna work out.

SUPFEMALE:Hey, quÃ© serÃ¡, serÃ¡.
OTHERMALE:Ciao.
SUPMALE:Ciao.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer! Yes? Bring in the next guy, please.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, he was the last one, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, he can't be.
LEADMALE:There's got to be at least one qualified kid in the 10th grade.
LEADMALE:There are plenty of smart kids, but none of them wanted to be on the team with you.
SUPMALE:I can't understand that.
LEADFEMALE:I merely asked them to comply with a few simple rules.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you wanted them to salute you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the captain of the team, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:These kids have got to learn to respect authority.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what are you gonna do now? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I got to think.
SUPMALE:Hey, I'm sorry, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, I've been revising these plans all day.
LEADFEMALE:Now, why are you so resistant to my ideas? I'm not resistant to your ideas, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:But I just don't think theater in the round is what we want to do here.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying you don't like it? I-I'm not saying that.
LEADMALE:You do like it? I'm not saying that.
SUPFEMALE:I'm saying this is a high-school quiz show, not "my fair lady.
OTHERMALE:" "My fair lady"! That's it! The quiz will be like "my fair lady"! Well, we've got the set for it.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:What I've got to do is find my Eliza Doolittle.
LEADMALE:A 10th grader who knows virtually nothing about anything.
OTHERFEMALE:An empty vessel that I can fill with my knowledge, my insight, my wisdom.
LEADFEMALE:Someone whose mind is a total blank.
SUPMALE:A clean slate.
OTHERMALE:Mom! Could you help me in the kitchen? I'm trying to make a snack.
SUPMALE:I forgot how the blender works.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Let's turn to the next question.
LEADMALE:Alex, we've been doing this for hours.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting tired! She needs her rest.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, I don't think you fully appreciate what an enormous task I've undertaken here.
OTHERMALE:I'm taking a simple peasant girl whose greatest prior achievement was coordinating her eye shadow with her sweater, and I'm turning her into someone Someone who could have a conversation with me.
SUPMALE:You're gonna have to give her more incentive than that, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, let's just get this over with.
LEADMALE:You're getting a little too pompous, even for you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, we went over this one yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:It's a geography question.
LEADFEMALE:At the Southern tip of Chile lies a body of water named for a famous explorer.
LEADFEMALE:Name this body of water.

LEADFEMALE:Mallory actually named all the cabinet members.
OTHERFEMALE:That was me, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
SUPFEMALE:We need to work.
LEADFEMALE:Please, mom, dad, do it for Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe for a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Okay, Elyse, and uh, Jennifer, sit over there, representing one team.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory and Alex sit here.
SUPMALE:And I'll stand here.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, maybe you should stand on the chair, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because according to my revised, revised plan, the moderator's podium is elevated.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, look, I'm not quite sure we're going to be doing it that way, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Well, there are a variety of factors involved.
LEADFEMALE:Could you guys discuss this later, please? I mean, it's getting late.
LEADFEMALE:It's very important that Mallory get some sense of what the actual tournament will be like.
LEADMALE:Okay? Dad, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.

OTHERFEMALE: Mythology.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:You're good at this.

LEADMALE:Most of our viewers will not have 3-d glasses.
OTHERMALE:Mom, mom.
SUPMALE:Dad! Please.
OTHERMALE:We're on television here.
SUPFEMALE:The question now goes over to Harding high.

SUPFEMALE:Not uncle Remus.
SUPFEMALE:Just Remus.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'll bet he was somebody's uncle.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, if romulus had kids, then Remus would be an uncle, wouldn't he? I suppose he would have, yes.
LEADFEMALE:All right, then he was uncle Remus.
SUPMALE:Maybe we practiced enough for one day.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I have some other plans we can look over, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, actually, you can never practice too much.
LEADFEMALE:Steven! Uh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Now, how about interlocking plexiglas platforms? They can be powered hydraulically.
