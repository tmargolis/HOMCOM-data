OTHERMALE:now, remember, girls, concentration is the single-most important factor in an athlete's performance.
LEADMALE:Index finger of the left hand interlocking with pinkie of the right.
LEADFEMALE:And in your mind's eye, you should be able to see the ball going into the cup.
SUPMALE:I think your mind's eye needs glasses, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, kids.
LEADFEMALE:How was the wedding? Oh, the wedding was fine.
SUPFEMALE:I think the marriage is in trouble, though.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hon, you got to give them a chance.
OTHERMALE:They've only been married for a couple of hours.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse, only one of them's going on the honeymoon.
LEADMALE:Okay, I admit that's a bad sign.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll keep the mystery alive, anyway.
LEADMALE:It was a beautiful ceremony.
OTHERMALE:Ron caught the bouquet.
OTHERFEMALE:Wasn't just a catch, Suzanne.
LEADMALE:I had to elbow out two cousins and a flower girl to make that catch.
OTHERFEMALE:We're all very proud of you, Ron.
OTHERMALE:So, Alex, how's the golf? You ready to, uh, enter any tournaments yet? I think the only way Alex will get into a tournament is inside someone's golf bag.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:Put your head down on this little tee.
LEADMALE:Alex, the most important thing is never take a sport too seriously.
SUPFEMALE:Have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:That's the only way to approach it.
SUPMALE:Am I right? Right, Ron.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Steve, best 6 shots out of 10.
SUPMALE:Loser pays the other guy's mortgage for a year.
LEADFEMALE:You're on.
LEADMALE:Hey, uh, Suzanne, you want to keep score? No, I don't think so, Ron.
OTHERFEMALE:The excitement might be too much for me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, can we come and watch? Well, it's hard to concentrate with a lot of noise.
LEADMALE:We'll root for you this time, daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You can come.
SUPMALE:Suzanne, do you want some coffee? Oh, no, thank you, Elyse.
LEADMALE:It'd just keep me awake tonight.
SUPMALE:I'm having enough trouble falling asleep as it is.
SUPFEMALE:Something bothering you? Oh, no, not really.
LEADFEMALE:You know.
LEADFEMALE:This and that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's so clichÃ©, Elyse, I'm embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Woman turns 40.
LEADMALE:Her kids go off to college.
SUPFEMALE:She's left with a big void in her life.
LEADFEMALE:What about Ron? He's the big void.
SUPFEMALE:Is this Is this something recent? Well, things haven't been quite right for the last 13 years or so.
SUPFEMALE:Could blow over.
OTHERMALE:Elyse, I've got no identity of my own.
LEADMALE:Ron's busy all day, and I've got nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Suzanne, you have You have a very full life.
LEADFEMALE:You you have that, uh Well, you know, you do those Didn't you once What did you major in in college? Medieval folk dancing.
OTHERFEMALE:Not exactly a growth industry.
SUPMALE:Face it.
LEADMALE:Mothers are like pro ballplayers.
LEADFEMALE:Once they get a certain age, all they're good for is selling beer.
LEADMALE:Need any beer, Elyse? Do you want a job? I mean, you could work for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Work for you? All I know about architecture is that the ceiling should be above the floor.
LEADMALE:Well, you'd do office work.
OTHERMALE:You know, make phone calls and type.
SUPMALE:It would take a lot of pressure off me to have someone take care of those things.
LEADFEMALE:You sure you're not offering me this job just to make me feel better? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, not at all.
LEADFEMALE:I've been thinking of hiring someone for a long time.
OTHERMALE:I was going to hire someone qualified, but I'm sure that I don't mean that you're not qualified.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean Well, you know what I mean.
SUPFEMALE:What do you say? What time do I report for work, boss? Tomorrow morning at 9:00.
SUPMALE:Oh oh.
LEADFEMALE:9:00 is tough.
LEADMALE:Ron and I have breakfast together.
SUPFEMALE:That's all the time he can spare to be with me.
LEADMALE:We make love, and then we talk for 12 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, Suzanne, we lost a golf ball.
SUPMALE:It rolled under the car.
SUPMALE:So could you crawl under there and get it for us? I'll be here at 8:30.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Jennifer, how many more questions do I have to answer? Mallory, it's important.
OTHERFEMALE:Our assignment is to interview every member of the family.
LEADMALE:Even the vegetables? Alex, you stay out of this.
LEADMALE:I'll interview you next.
OTHERFEMALE:I've gone limp with breathless anticipation.
LEADFEMALE:Let me check this with you, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Under your ambition, I've got, "to always be in fashion"? Right.
LEADMALE:Aim high, I always say.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Jennifer, you're not making me out to look frivolous in this thing, are you? It has to be factual.
LEADFEMALE:It is a biographical sketch.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:If you were to describe yourself with one word, the essence of your personality, what would it be? Perky! I'll think of something, and I'll put it down.
LEADFEMALE:Are you ready, Alex? Uh, I don't think I can follow that, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I can't top "perky.
OTHERFEMALE:" You guys should hurry up and finish.
LEADFEMALE:Suzanne will be here any minute.
SUPMALE:I can't believe it's my turn to carpool again.
LEADMALE:It seems like only yesterday I did it.
OTHERMALE:It was only yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:That explains it.
OTHERMALE:You're filling in for Sandy whistleman.
SUPMALE:The kids don't like driving with him anymore.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he's always in such a hurry.
LEADFEMALE:Last time, he didn't even stop to let us out.
LEADMALE:He just slowed down.
LEADMALE:We had to jump.
LEADFEMALE:Is this the employee's entrance? 
SUPMALE:Hey, you found it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, but I couldn't decide what to wear.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you look great, Suzanne.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I brought these two backups just in case.
LEADMALE:It really wasn't necessary.
SUPMALE:Come, kids, you don't want to be late for school, do you? 
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Suzanne, good luck in your new job.
SUPMALE: Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Hope your boss treats you okay.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye.
OTHERMALE:Uh Yeah.
LEADMALE:Welcome to your new job.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:How am I doing so far? Oh! Okay, now the first thing I need you to do for me Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Is to type this letter.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Okay? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Now, do you want this double-spaced or single-spaced? Uh, single spaced, I think.
OTHERMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Double-spaced would be easier to read.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Double-spaced.
LEADMALE:Hi, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Hi, don.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Don Bradford.
LEADMALE:My new assistant, Suzanne Davis.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do? How long have you been working here? Oh, almost 3 minutes.
LEADMALE:Huh.
LEADMALE:About ready to retire, huh? Don.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:The wife and I had a chance to look over the plans for the summer home, and, uh, we've got a few questions.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:First question.
LEADFEMALE:I think we were wrong about the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:We'd like to have it moved.
SUPMALE:You want it indoors, then? Mm.
LEADMALE:It's not me.
LEADFEMALE:It's Shirley.
SUPFEMALE:Well, okay.
SUPMALE:That's no problem.
SUPFEMALE:We can bring that indoors, and you can still have that rustic feeling you want.
SUPFEMALE:What else? Oh, you know that fireplace we talked about? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:That's the focal point.
LEADFEMALE:The emotional centerpiece.
OTHERMALE:I designed the whole room around it.
LEADFEMALE:Lose it.
LEADMALE:We're gonna put a giant TV screen there.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea.
SUPMALE:A fireplace is more trouble than it's worth.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's gonna change the whole concept of the home, though, isn't it? Oh, look, I don't know anything about architecture.
LEADFEMALE:That's your job.
LEADFEMALE:I just know what I like.
LEADFEMALE:Do we really need this utility room here? I think it'd work much better on the other side.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know, you may have something there.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:That would enable us to lose this wall here, which is serving no purpose that I can see.
LEADFEMALE:It's holding up the house, Suzanne.
SUPFEMALE:We're not architects, Elyse.
LEADMALE:We're just telling you what we want.
SUPFEMALE:Look here.
LEADFEMALE:You see this deck? Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:This is redwood.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think that's all right? You know what would be good out here? What? Rubber.
SUPMALE:Rubber.
SUPMALE:Rubber?! Hey, we're just bouncing a few ideas around.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Elyse, be a dear and put some tea up for us, please.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see why not.
LEADMALE:Don, let's talk closets.
LEADMALE:Elyse, aren't you ready yet? Do I look ready? No, not really.
LEADMALE:That's why the question came to mind.
LEADFEMALE:And if you had any consideration at all, you would not be taking me out to a nice dinner tonight.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'm just a heel.
OTHERFEMALE:And you certainly wouldn't have asked Suzanne and Ron to join us.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you invited them, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sure, throw that up at me now.
LEADMALE:Okay, uh, Mallory, I'm going to go back upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:When my wife comes in, would you ask her to call me? Steven, I'm I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to snap at you.
LEADMALE:Mommy, are you going through a midlife crisis? No.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that thanks to Suzanne's interference, I've had to totally redesign the Bradford house.
LEADFEMALE:I thought the bradfords loved that design.
LEADMALE:The bradfords loved it.
SUPMALE:Suzanne didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Well, try to make the best of it, Elyse.
SUPMALE:She's a good friend, and it's only one house.
SUPMALE:Not anymore.
SUPFEMALE:It's a duplex.
LEADMALE:And it's not just the bradfords' house.
OTHERMALE:It these past two weeks with Suzanne have just been torture.
OTHERMALE:If it's made me awfully cranky, guys, I apologize.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna have to fire her, mom? I can't fire Suzanne.
LEADMALE:She's my friend.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if I can hurt her like that.
LEADMALE:Mom, this is business.
LEADMALE:Y-you can't let feelings enter into it.
LEADMALE:This body comes with feelings.
OTHERMALE:It's a package deal.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's exactly why women will always be second rate in the business world.
LEADMALE:Alex, your credibility has just sunk to a new low with this crowd.
OTHERMALE:N-now now, maybe he's right.
LEADFEMALE:Mom! No, not about women being second-rate, but about feelings not entering into business.
LEADMALE:I mean, the fact is, that ever since Suzanne's been with me, I have fallen further and further behind.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do my best work when she's taking up my time.
SUPMALE:So as a professional, I should fire her tonight before I change my mind.
LEADMALE:I just changed my mind.
LEADMALE:You want me to do it for you, mom? I'll do it.
OTHERMALE:I won't like it, but I'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Suzanne, Ron.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry we're late.
LEADFEMALE:We, uh, had some car trouble.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't have any car trouble, Suzanne.
SUPFEMALE:Don't lie to these people.
OTHERFEMALE:The truth is, we had a fight A screaming, yelling, clawing fight.
OTHERFEMALE:A fight, car trouble What's the difference? Kids, why don't you go upstairs? I'll bring the ice cream later.
LEADFEMALE:What ice cream? The ice cream I'll bring you if you go upstairs right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:This is bribery But it'll work.
SUPMALE:Ron, take me home now, okay? I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.
LEADMALE:Suzanne, sweetie pie, why are you taking this so personally? The fact that I want to move out of the house has nothing to do with you.
LEADFEMALE:So, what will it be tonight Chinese or Italian? Really doesn't matter to me.
LEADMALE:Our treat if we leave right now.
SUPMALE:Look, I-i-i need to spread my wings, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:Look for new horizons.
OTHERMALE:Italian's good.
OTHERFEMALE:Little wine, relax.
LEADMALE:Vino, huh? After all I put up with all these years, now he wants to leave me.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that fair? Look, Suzanne, you're not acting very maturely about this.
SUPMALE:I'm willing to go out and have a good time.
LEADMALE:I want us to stay friends.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think I could stay friends with a snake? An insect? A a diseased crawling maggot? I guess that's a "no.
SUPMALE:" Okay.
LEADMALE:I have tried to be nice.
LEADMALE:See you around, Suzanne.
LEADMALE:Hey, you're beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Ciao.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Suzanne, I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:A-are you all right, Suzanne? Well, 20 years.
LEADMALE:Over.
SUPMALE:Gone pfft.
LEADMALE:Oh! Well, I-i almost feel like I have nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll tell you one thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I just thank god I've got my job with you.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Mr.
SUPMALE:Bradford.
SUPFEMALE:I'm working as quickly as I can.
LEADMALE:Those are major changes you suggested.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not the elevator that's hard.
OTHERMALE:It's the second floor that goes with it.
LEADMALE:I don't care what Suzanne said.
OTHERFEMALE:Second floors are hard.
SUPMALE:Lo i-I'll talk to you later at the meeting.
SUPMALE:Yes, Suzanne will be there.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Suzanne strikes again, huh? You've got it.
LEADFEMALE:Is it as bad as when she ordered the bumper stickers that said, "architects have flying buttresses"? I don't know what I'm gonna do with her.
LEADMALE:You were ready to fire her two weeks ago, mom.
LEADFEMALE:What's holding you up? Her husband left her.
LEADMALE:That's what's holding me up.
SUPFEMALE:Her whole world fell apart.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to come in and deliver the final blow.
LEADFEMALE:Business can't come to a grinding halt just because of a broken marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Marriages are falling apart all the time these days.
LEADMALE:Alyson gerber's mother brought home a new father, two brothers from a club med vacation.
LEADMALE:All she wanted was a grass skirt.
OTHERMALE:What ever happened to the good old days when a husband and wife stuck together even if they hated each other's guts? Yeah, those were the days.
LEADMALE:It sure is hard to be a kid today.
LEADMALE:You never know when your family unit's gonna fall apart.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, you don't have to worry about that.
SUPFEMALE:This family unit isn't going to fall apart.
LEADMALE:You promise? We can't promise, because nobody knows what the future is going to bring.
SUPFEMALE:But I can tell you we'll do our best to keep that from happening.
SUPFEMALE:I'd rather have a promise.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you need to worry, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:People who kiss as much as they do are bound to stay together.
LEADMALE:You know, I think she's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Aw, you had to remind them, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:We're just doing this for you three, so you'll know our marriage is okay.
LEADMALE:It's not like we enjoy it or anything.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that's enough.
LEADMALE:We get the point.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:I remember kissing.
SUPFEMALE:Rub it in.
LEADFEMALE:Can we get going, dad? What? We It's my turn to drive again? What about Pete dillman's father? Isn't it his turn to drive? Well, he and Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:dillman split up.
LEADMALE:Well, what about Mrs.
LEADMALE:dillman's new boyfriend? He's too young to drive.
SUPFEMALE:See ya.
OTHERMALE:Are you all right, Suzanne? Oh, it's nothing.
OTHERMALE:Just seeing you and your kids and your husband so happy kind of got me depressed, that's all.
LEADMALE:Do you want to talk about it? No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, now is not the time or the place to discuss my personal problems.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Now, let's just get down to work, please.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Did you happen to see the drawings for the Edwards' house here? I thought I left them on your table.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, desk, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:You said you'd call it a desk.
OTHERMALE:The important thing is, did you see them? Yes, I saw them, and I mailed them.
SUPMALE:Suzanne, they weren't finished yet.
SUPMALE:Oh, finished them.
SUPFEMALE:I put a little window in here and a little door in there.
SUPMALE:I think you'll like them.
LEADFEMALE:Suzanne, you shouldn't have done that without asking me first.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:My enthusiasm just got the best of me.
LEADFEMALE:It won't happen again.
LEADMALE:It just comes from having so much time at home alone with nothing to do, no one to talk to.
LEADMALE:Do you want to talk about it? No.
LEADMALE:No, no, I came here to work, not to discuss my personal problems.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe Ron.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know what he wants to do now? Take skydiving lessons.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you're gonna sky-dive, I think lessons are important.
LEADFEMALE:He's acting like such an adolescent, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I oh, I-I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I know I shouldn't be rambling on like this.
OTHERFEMALE:Suzanne, maybe you'd like to take some time off to collect your thoughts.
OTHERFEMALE:Like a year or two.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna sit at home and feel sorry for myself.
LEADMALE:Everybody's treating me like I'm some kind of war casualty.
OTHERMALE:Like I might fall to pieces at any minute.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:That's not gonna happen.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna make a life for myself whether Ron's in it or not.
SUPFEMALE:That's the spirit, Suzanne.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'll tell you another thing.
LEADFEMALE:If one more person pussyfoots around me and offers me comfort instead of respect, I'll scream.
SUPMALE:I just want to be treated like anybody else.
LEADMALE:You're absolutely right.
SUPFEMALE:Now, let's get down to work.
OTHERMALE:I have a great idea for reorganizing the office.
OTHERMALE:Suzanne, you're fired.
LEADMALE:That wasn't it.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, you can't let this thing with Suzanne upset you so much.
SUPMALE:She was driving you crazy.
LEADMALE:You had to let her go.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but if you'd seen her face, you'd know why I was so upset.
LEADMALE:You want to come up to my room and listen to some blues records, mom? They always help me when I'm feeling down.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, the only records you have are the muppets.
LEADFEMALE:They don't sing the blues.
OTHERFEMALE:They do if you play them in the wrong speed.
OTHERMALE:Mom, you did Suzanne a favor.
SUPFEMALE:Now that she's had a little fling in the business world, she can go back to the kitchen, where she belongs.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you're gonna make some woman a wonderful master someday.
LEADFEMALE:I hope so.
SUPMALE:Good night, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Sleep well.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Suzanne, uh H-hello.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to talk to Elyse.
LEADMALE:Hello, Suzanne.
LEADMALE:Hello, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I've got something to say to you.
SUPFEMALE:Where would you like me, Suzanne? Upstairs or in the kitchen? It's up to you.
LEADMALE:It's your house.
LEADFEMALE:The kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:It's quieter in there.
LEADMALE:Well, Suzanne, you look good.
LEADMALE:It's a beautiful sweater.
LEADFEMALE:When did you get it? Let's stop beating around the bush, Elyse.
LEADMALE:You know why I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Suzanne, maybe I was a little hasty this afternoon.
LEADMALE:Maybe we could work things out.
LEADMALE:Oh, Elyse, I came here to apologize to you.
OTHERFEMALE:You were the first person who respected me enough to hold me responsible for my actions.
SUPFEMALE:You dealt with me as Suzanne, not the poor deserted wife.
SUPMALE:Only a friend would do that.
SUPMALE:We are still friends? Oh, of course.
SUPMALE:But if you had been nicer to me, I bet we would have wound up enemies.
OTHERMALE:But because you kicked me out into the cold, brutal world, because you had no regard for my personal feelings or well-being, you made me see that I better stand up on my own.
LEADMALE:What are friends for? Because you rubbed salt into my festering wounds Suzanne, please, you've thanked me enough.
SUPMALE:I've done a lot of thinking today.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a lot more thinking to do.
SUPMALE:But you've put me on the right track.
LEADMALE:I've got to decide what to do with my life, what to do about Ron, about a career.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Elyse.
LEADMALE:My wife here? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:That's her right over there.
SUPFEMALE:Good memory.
LEADFEMALE:Suzanne, got some good news for you.
SUPFEMALE:I've decided to come back home.
LEADFEMALE:Whoopee.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, I missed you.
LEADMALE:I really did, okay? All better now? Hey, Steve, get out here! It's gonna be like old times, you'll see.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
LEADFEMALE:Suzanne, this is no time to play hard to get.
LEADMALE:I'm back, and you've got me.
LEADMALE:Oh, Steve.
SUPFEMALE:Ready for another putting match? I got my clubs out in the car.
LEADMALE:Ron, I'm not sure this is the right time for it.
LEADFEMALE:Why? You tired? Ron, you're incredible.
OTHERMALE:And if you think I want you back, you're not only incredible, you're stupid.
SUPFEMALE:Suzanne, I had a little lapse.
SUPFEMALE:I'm over it.
SUPFEMALE:It's time for you to forgive me, like you always do.
LEADFEMALE:Not this time, Ron.
LEADFEMALE:You can't just walk all over me.
LEADMALE:I'm not a doormat.
SUPMALE:I'm a person.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got feelings.
OTHERMALE:I've got my own identity.
LEADMALE:I've got a b.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:In medieval folk dancing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready to face the world.
LEADMALE:Not true.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have a b.
SUPFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:In folk dancing.
LEADMALE:You're two credits short.
LEADMALE:That's another thing I'm thinking about Changing my major.
LEADFEMALE:Guess there's no point in my trying to talk you out of this.
LEADMALE:None whatsoever.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I might as well leave, then.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Steve, you want to, uh Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Suzanne, I don't understand what you're doing, but, um But I'll respect your wishes.
SUPFEMALE:It's kind of nice to see you so strong, so independent.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you've really changed.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Ron.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I can, too.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe.
OTHERMALE:I'll bring my laundry by on Friday.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, there's a card here from Suzanne.
LEADMALE:It's addressed to both of us.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:How's she doing? Uh, "having a wonderful time here.
LEADMALE:" Greek is very hard to pick up, but I'm not.
OTHERFEMALE:" "I communicate with the natives "through the universal language of dance.
LEADFEMALE:"This works out well, although it is difficult "to order in a restaurant.
LEADMALE:"Have to run now.
OTHERMALE:"Nik Nikolas and I "are going off to stomp some grapes.
LEADMALE:Love, Suzanne.
SUPFEMALE:" Let me see the postcard.
LEADMALE:It's a picture of the acropolis.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, she penciled in the second story.
LEADMALE:
