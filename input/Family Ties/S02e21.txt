LEADFEMALE: well, Jen, you're all set.
OTHERMALE:You've got your stuffed animals, your clock radio, and your baseball cards.
OTHERMALE:Is there anything else we can get you before we go? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Get me out of here! I don't want to have my tonsils out.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, we've been through this.
SUPFEMALE:Having your tonsils out is a very simple procedure.
SUPMALE:There's nothing to worry about.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you had yours out, mom? Wha no.
LEADFEMALE:Dad? Uh, let's see Uh.
LEADFEMALE:No, I-I've still got mine.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory? I wanted to.
LEADMALE:Nice chatting with you Uh, no, you don't.
OTHERMALE:No, come on.
SUPMALE:Come on, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:I apologize if he isn't, but is this person related to you? Why does everybody always ask us that? This is our son, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:See? Will you let go of me now, please? With pleasure.
LEADMALE:Alex, why are you in a white coat? He's been making rounds.
LEADMALE:I was making an informal survey of the quality of care in this institution.
LEADMALE:My sister is gonna be up there on that table tomorrow, and I want to make sure everything is okay.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, I think Mrs.
LEADMALE:ferguson in 104 could use another Alex! You're going to have to leave now.
LEADFEMALE:Visiting hours are just about over.
SUPFEMALE:Please don't tell anyone he's my brother.
SUPFEMALE:They might take it out on me when I'm unconscious.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, young lady.
LEADFEMALE:We are professionals.
LEADFEMALE:We don't let our personal feelings interfere with our work.
LEADMALE:A pox on you! Don't worry, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Everything's gonna be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, just relax and try and get some rest.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay? I'll try.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be back in your own bed tomorrow night.
SUPMALE:Sleep well.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Jen, if I were you, I would stretch this thing out, you know? I mean, have one tonsil out tomorrow, have another one out in a month or so.
LEADFEMALE:You double your sympathy.
LEADMALE:Come on, Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I promised Mrs.
LEADMALE:ferguson I'd check on her.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE: Dear diary Well, here I am in the hospital.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not scared.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe a little.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'm petrified.
LEADMALE:What if something happens to me? What if I never see my family again? I know I complain a lot to you about them, but I love 'em.
LEADMALE:What if I never get to say I'm sorry for all those bad things I've done? I don't know why I've been acting so childish lately.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's because I'm a child.
SUPMALE:Mallory and I used to have so much fun together when we were younger.
LEADMALE:Now she's a lot more interested in boys and clothes than she is in me.
LEADMALE:I guess I'm jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:I could understand being interested in clothes, but the part about boys, I just don't get it.
OTHERMALE:Mallory, do you want to play checkers tonight? Do I look like I'm dressing for checkers, Jennifer? No, I'd say that's more of a parcheesi outfit.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, you promised you'd play with me.
LEADFEMALE:I got everything all ready.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, I don't have time for childish games.
SUPFEMALE:I have a date tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Do I look all right? Your cheeks are uneven.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? I mean there's more red stuff on one side than the other.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have any red stuff on.
LEADMALE:Wow, then you're really in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, you're making me nervous.
SUPFEMALE:You're always nervous before a date.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm not.
OTHERFEMALE:Then why'd you brush your teeth seven times in the last hour? Maybe she's going out with a dentist.
LEADFEMALE:I happen to be going out with Kevin Jenkins.
LEADMALE:I've had a crush on him since the beginning of the year.
OTHERMALE:Do you mind, Alex? No, I don't mind.
SUPFEMALE:How does Kevin feel about it? He doesn't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:That's Kevin.
LEADMALE:I'm not ready.
LEADFEMALE:What should I do? We'll, uh We'll entertain him while you're making yourself presentable.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:We'll, uh We'll set him up in the guest room.
LEADFEMALE:Yo.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
SUPFEMALE:You must be Kevin.
LEADMALE:You must be Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Guess, uh Guess Mallory's told you a lot about me, huh? Yeah.
SUPMALE:How'd your shock treatments work out? Fine.
SUPMALE:Uh, just Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm Jennifer.
LEADMALE:You're Jennifer? You know, from the way Mallory described you, I thought you were just a baby.
LEADMALE:Ha ha Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, that that's funny, isn't it? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Goo-goo.
LEADMALE:Tell me, Kevin, how is it that you, uh That you know our dear sister? I sit in front of her in biology.
LEADMALE:Mallory's had a crush on you for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Jennifer I didn't know that.
OTHERMALE:I don't think you were supposed to.
LEADFEMALE:Oops.
LEADMALE:Silly me.
LEADMALE:You know how us babies are.
LEADMALE:So Uh, where are you two young people off to tonight? Well I thought we'd go see the, um The nuclear-disarmament film.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory said she loves documentaries.
SUPMALE:Did she? She's also said that she's interested in a lot of the same causes that I am Disarmament, protecting our natural resources, improving diplomatic relations with third-world nations.
SUPFEMALE:That's our Mallory.
SUPMALE:So, Kevin, can I interest you in some swampland in Florida? Kidding.
SUPMALE:Joking.
SUPMALE:Well, I got another shock treatment.
LEADMALE:I gotta go.
SUPMALE:They, uh, double the voltage if you're late.
SUPMALE:Are you saying that Mallory just pretended to be interested in those things because I am? You got it.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, she wouldn't be interested in a documentary on nuclear disarmament, then? She might be interested in what the protesters are wearing.
OTHERMALE:I think I get the picture.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Kevin.
LEADFEMALE:Love your sweater.
OTHERFEMALE:See what I mean? Well, uh, Mallory, suppose you tell me where you want to go since you don't like documentaries.
SUPMALE:But I love documentaries.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what I hear.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, what have you been telling Kevin? Just making small talk.
OTHERFEMALE:And what kind of movies does Mallory really like, Jennifer, huh? Why are you asking her what I like? Because maybe she'll tell me the truth.
LEADFEMALE:What is that supposed to mean? Well, Jennifer's been telling me quite a lot.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Well, maybe you'd like to bring her along with us on the date.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe I would.
LEADMALE:I'll get my coat.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you'd rather not go out at all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you'd rather not go.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Let's not go.
SUPFEMALE:I have to wash my hair tonight anyway.
LEADMALE:Me too.
LEADMALE:I mean, I have to shave Again.
SUPFEMALE:Well See you around.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We'll see you.
LEADMALE:Ready for checkers? That was really horrible, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE: I knew I was being horrible.
SUPMALE:But I just couldn't stop myself.
LEADMALE:I wanted Mallory to stay home and play with me like she used to.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I'd grow up already.
SUPFEMALE:Then maybe I wouldn't do so many stupid things, like the way I blew up at dad when he wouldn't let me have my way.
LEADMALE:It started like any other day.
LEADFEMALE:Mom was late, Mallory was looking in the mirror Alex was being pompous.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, kids.
LEADMALE:Bye, kids.
LEADFEMALE:I will see you tonight.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, Alex? Ma, don't you know that the key to a successful day is a good breakfast? Girls, make your mother some breakfast.
OTHERMALE:Frankly, I just don't have time today.
LEADMALE:Mom, can I go to the movies with Chrissy tonight? Now, honey, you went to the movies with Chrissy last night.
LEADMALE:That was Chrissy's birthday.
LEADMALE:It was an exception.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like you going out on a school night two nights in a row.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if dad says yes, can I go? No.
LEADFEMALE:And I don't want you to ask him.
LEADMALE:I don't like it when you do that.
SUPMALE:Now I got to run, honey.
LEADMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I worry about you.
SUPFEMALE:I know the feeling.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Morning, dad.
OTHERFEMALE: Hi, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Hi, daddy! Oh, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, don't you look very handsome today.
LEADMALE:Well Thank you, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:No, I mean it.
LEADMALE:You know, the way a man dresses tells us a lot about him.
LEADMALE:That tie, for example, says that you're an open-minded individual.
LEADFEMALE:That's what they say.
LEADFEMALE:One tie is worth a thousand words.
OTHERMALE:That's very funny, dad! Did you guys hear that? Say it again, dad, please.
LEADMALE:One tie is worth Dad We heard it.
SUPMALE:Hey, take it easy, dad.
SUPFEMALE:My side hurts from laughing.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, I was thinking of going to the movies with Chrissy tonight.
SUPFEMALE:You know Chrissy The one who thinks you're such a wonderful man.
LEADMALE:I got to get out of here.
LEADMALE:Uh What did your mother say? Mom? I know she was talking about how happy she is being married to a man like you.
SUPMALE:I can't take it, either.
SUPMALE:Jennifer You went to the movies last night.
SUPFEMALE:It was Chrissy's birthday.
SUPFEMALE:It was an exception.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want you going out two school nights in a row.
OTHERMALE:Do you and mom rehearse? Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Okay, we'll compromise.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't want me going to the movies on a school night I won't go to school tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds reasonable Wait a minute! No way, j Cut it out! I thought you guys were supposed to be so Liberal, so open-minded.
SUPFEMALE:Sure had me fooled.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, I thought I made myself clear.
SUPFEMALE:This discussion is over.
LEADMALE:You can't go.
LEADMALE:Come on, dad.
OTHERMALE:Chrissy's father said she could go.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm not Chrissy's father, I'm your father.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad for me, isn't it? Hol a minute ago, I was father of the year.
SUPMALE:Yeah?! Well, things change fast around here, buster! And I'll tell you another thing That tie Is right-wing! 
SUPMALE:Dear diary Guess who.
LEADMALE:Good guess.
LEADFEMALE:I keep waking up.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it doesn't matter if I'm tired in the morning 'cause they're just gonna put me to sleep again.
OTHERMALE:I sure hope my surgeon's getting a good night's sleep, though.
SUPMALE:I just dreamt that I went home after the operation, and nobody recognized me without my tonsils.
LEADMALE:There was another girl living in my room who looked just like me, but she was a lot nicer than I am.
LEADMALE:She didn't argue with anyone, not even Alex.
LEADMALE:You remember Alex, don't you, diary? Sure, you do.
SUPMALE:How could you forget him? Girls, girls.
SUPMALE:I need your help.
LEADMALE:I need you to rehearse with me.
LEADMALE:I'm trying out for a part in the school play.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, what I'd like you to do Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Yo, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Uh, where you going? Aren't you gonna help me? No, Alex.
LEADMALE:I have too much respect for the theater.
LEADMALE:Besides, "gilligan's island's" on now.
LEADMALE:Alex, why the sudden interest in the theater? I have always been interested in the theater.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, the theater happens to be a link to the past.
LEADFEMALE:It's an art form as old as man himself A continuum of judeo-Christian amusement as we know it.
LEADMALE:Besides, Melanie Parker's playing the female lead.
OTHERFEMALE:Say no more.
LEADMALE:Uh, look, the, uh The play we're doing is called "a streetcar named desire.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm trying out for the role of Stanley Kowalski.
LEADFEMALE:It's a part that calls for raw, unbridled manly passion.
LEADMALE:Maybe they'll let you work the lights.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, can you put down the apple, please? Why? Well, because you can't read lines and chew at the same time.
SUPFEMALE:Brando could do it.
SUPMALE:You're not Brando.
LEADFEMALE:That makes two of us.
LEADFEMALE:All right? Hey, there, Stella, baby.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Okay, all right.
SUPMALE:Why you laughing? Your accent.
LEADMALE:You sound like deputy dawg.
SUPFEMALE:I happen to have a perfectly acceptable Southern accent.
LEADFEMALE:Susie sperber's from Virginia, and she doesn't talk like that.
SUPMALE:I'm not doing susie sperber.
LEADMALE:I'm doing Stanley Kowalski.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jennifer, this is very important to me.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Listen I'm gonna go outside and pretend I'm calling you from the street.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to stand right here and pretend you're answering me from the balcony.
SUPMALE:Gotcha, Stanley.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, there, Stella, baby.
SUPMALE:Stella-a? Hey, Stella! Jennifer! Hey, Jennifer! 
SUPFEMALE:Alex didn't get the part Or Melanie Parker.
LEADMALE:Why did I give him such a hard time? Sure, he's not a normal person, but he's a good brother.
SUPFEMALE:Stella! 
OTHERMALE:He always helps me when I need it.
SUPMALE:Mom says I should be nicer.
LEADFEMALE:She's right.
LEADMALE:I think I feel worst of all about the way I treated her.
SUPFEMALE:It's not easy for her going back to work after all these years.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't made it any easier.
OTHERMALE:I hope you like this.
LEADMALE:I've never made soufflÃ© before.
LEADFEMALE:No kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Is there a power saw in the garage? I'm i-I'm sure we'll love it, uh Won't we, kids? Well, I suppose it's within the realm of possibility.
SUPFEMALE:Ahh.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think? Uh, Jennifer, can you pass me the water, please? Sure.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I think you went a little overboard on the pepper, Mallory.
LEADMALE:I only put in a cup.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, if mom keeps working through dinner, we're all gonna lose a lot of weight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna get some leftovers from the fridge.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, your mom's working very hard now.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure she'd rather be home for dinner.
SUPMALE:But it's a new job, and there's a lot for her to learn.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Once she knows her job is secure, she can slack off.
OTHERMALE:You know, Mallory, in your own unwitting fashion, you just explained why socialism can never work.
LEADMALE:I wish mom were home more often.
LEADMALE:I keep forgetting what she looks like.
LEADFEMALE:That's her, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What a day! The computer kept printing out football standings instead of floor plans.
LEADMALE:And then on the way home, Steven, the car started acting up.
SUPFEMALE:Will you take a look at it, please? It's in the engine But it's spreading.
OTHERFEMALE:We're having leftovers tonight, mom.
LEADMALE:I kind of ruined dinner.
SUPMALE:But I'll make it up to you when I cook breakfast tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Did I mention I'm having breakfast in Europe tomorrow? Looks like somebody forgot to do the breakfast dishes.
LEADMALE:Whose turn was it? Mine.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you do them? Guess I forgot.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's your responsibility to remember.
SUPMALE:What's the difference? You're gone all day.
LEADFEMALE:Who's gonna notice? Well, just because I'm working doesn't mean you can shirk your responsibilities here at home.
SUPMALE:Why not? You do.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mallory? I think this would be a good time for you and me to be anywhere but here.
LEADMALE:Alex, for once in our lives, I agree with you.
OTHERMALE:I think I'll go with them.
SUPMALE:Not until you tell me what's going on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just tired of doing so many chores all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Well, nobody likes chores, but everybody has to do them.
SUPMALE:Alex and Mallory didn't have to do so many when they were my age.
SUPMALE:We're not talking about Alex and Mallory.
LEADMALE:We're talking about Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Since when did you care about Jennifer? What do you mean? Mom, if you cared about me, you wouldn't have had me last! Jennifer! Well, it's true.
LEADMALE:When Alex and Mallory were young, you were always home for them.
LEADFEMALE:I hardly ever see you.
OTHERMALE:W-why didn't you tell me you felt like this before? Because you were too busy.
SUPMALE:Oh, it looks like we have a real problem.
SUPFEMALE:Look, why why don't you sit down sit down, and we'll talk? Oh, I don't have time.
SUPFEMALE:I have to do my chores.
LEADMALE:You know, mom, ever since you started working, it's been no fun around here.
SUPFEMALE:Hope you're happy.
LEADMALE:Oh! 
LEADMALE:Poor mom.
LEADFEMALE:She got stuck with a spoiled soufflÃ© and a spoiled brat.
LEADFEMALE:How could I be so selfish? I'm so proud of her for going back to work, and being so good at it.
SUPMALE:I want to be just like her when I grow up, except for one thing.
OTHERMALE:I want a nicer daughter than me.
SUPMALE:Well, diary, I know one thing If I make it through this operation okay Which I probably won't, the first thing I'm gonna do is tell everyone in my family how sorry I am for all those selfish things I did to them.
SUPMALE:Oh, sure, Mallory, go ahead and laugh.
OTHERFEMALE:I am never gonna be able to show my face in this hospital again, and you think it's funny.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Alex.
SUPMALE:It's just I've never seen a man faint before.
SUPFEMALE:Well, keep it down.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing to be ashamed of, Alex.
LEADMALE:It happens to a lot of people when they give blood.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, those two old ladies in front of me looked really woozy.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:The next time the family gives blood, just drop me off at the nearest quilting bee.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's waking up.
SUPFEMALE:Jen, you okay? No Shh.
SUPMALE:Don't try and talk.
SUPMALE:The doctors want you to save your throat.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry, your voice will be back in a day or two.
SUPMALE:The operation went just fine, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:The doctor said it was so easy, he could have done it blindfolded.
OTHERMALE:In fact, he wore Steven! I'm just What a trouper! I think she wants to play charades.
LEADMALE:Uh, writing, writing a book.
SUPMALE:A book, a book title "from here to eternity.
LEADMALE:" 
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Uh, no.
SUPMALE:Uh, no "no, no, nanette"! You know, I think maybe she wants a pencil and paper.
LEADFEMALE:Honey.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know you kept a diary, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I thought I was the only one who did.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Yours is the only one we read.
OTHERFEMALE:"You would have been a great Stanley.
SUPMALE:" Uh, thanks, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:I think I make a pretty good Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What is she talking about, Alex? I don't know, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Is she still under sedation? "You look very pretty when you go out on dates.
OTHERFEMALE:" Yeah.
SUPMALE:Definitely still under sedation.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Jennifer I'm afraid you'll have to leave now.
LEADMALE:Our patient needs her rest.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:See you later, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh I heard about your little mishap at the blood bank.
LEADMALE:I hear you dropped like a stone.
OTHERMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:No, honey.
SUPMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:No more games.
SUPMALE:Just listen to the nurse and try and get some rest, honey.
LEADMALE:We'll be back later, okay? 
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Hon, time for a nap.
LEADMALE:You trying to tell me something, dear? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:You want to play charades.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to read this.
SUPMALE:"I love you.
LEADMALE:" Well, isn't that sweet, dear? I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPMALE:This is for them.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm sure they know you love them.
LEADMALE:Now you try to get some sleep.
LEADMALE:We love you, too, darling.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my girl.
SUPFEMALE:She's right.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:
