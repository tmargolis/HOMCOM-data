OTHERFEMALE:Well, it took an hour of singing and rocking, but I finally got Andrew to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Let him cry, Elyse.
SUPMALE:You don't wanna spoil him.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, he's in a new place.
LEADMALE:I think he's a little nervous.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't believe in over-coddling our children.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Well, that's funny because Mom said that you spoiled Dad so much that by the time she got him, he was I'll go check on Andrew.
SUPMALE:Anyway, uh, you want me to put these boxes in the hallway? I don't think I spoiled Steven.
LEADFEMALE:I- I don't think I actually used the word "spoiled," May.
SUPMALE:Uh, anyway, it was mostly in the area of food.
OTHERFEMALE:What kind of food? I- It was nothing.
OTHERMALE:You know, we can organize these boxes by size How did I spoil him with food? Okay, come on, break it up, you two.
LEADMALE:Break it up.
LEADFEMALE:Look, it's all right for Grandma to spoil one of her children.
OTHERMALE:Mom spoiled me.
LEADFEMALE:It's only natural.
LEADMALE:I'm her I'm her favorite.
LEADMALE:That's not true, Alex.
SUPMALE:Don't Don't try to hide it, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:It's It's only natural.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh, Darwin.
OTHERFEMALE:Survival of the cutest.
LEADFEMALE:Who's this Darwin guy, a friend of yours? I don't have any favorites, Alex.
LEADMALE:That's okay, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all right.
LEADMALE:You don't wanna talk in front of the M-A-L.
SUPFEMALE:That's okay.
SUPFEMALE:This guy, number one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we have an offer.
SUPMALE:You have an offer on the house? Yeah, have it here, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Looks real good.
OTHERMALE:I don't know how good it looks.
SUPFEMALE:Take it easy, Steve.
SUPMALE:Well, did you get the price you asked for? Very close.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what's the problem, then? Well, I'm thinking maybe we can get more.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Robert.
LEADMALE:We've been through this.
SUPFEMALE:That's a fair price.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not so sure it's a fair price.
LEADFEMALE:I happen to have some expertise in the real estate area, don't forget.
LEADFEMALE:What expertise? Maureen.
LEADFEMALE:My wife.
LEADFEMALE:Her father was a realtor.
LEADMALE:So, what does that make you, a realtor-in-law? Go ahead, make fun.
LEADFEMALE:But if Dad were here, he would agree with me.
LEADFEMALE:He would say, "Let's get our price.
SUPFEMALE:" He would, and you know it.
LEADMALE:And he'd be wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Dad was always wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I was always wrong.
SUPMALE:Everyone was always wrong, Steve, except you.
LEADFEMALE:You're wrong, Rob.
SUPFEMALE:That's not what I said.
LEADMALE:Now, boys, stop it.
LEADMALE:What is wrong with holding out for a few more dollars? I mean, why is getting more money a sin? It's just not the right time, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:This is not an easy time for Ma.
LEADFEMALE:The faster we get it over with, the better.
OTHERMALE:It's worth a few dollars to save her that aggravation.
LEADFEMALE:All I know is Dad sweated for 40 years to pay off this house.
LEADMALE:I am not letting it go without fighting for every penny.
LEADMALE:Robert.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Rob, this isn't gonna be one of your special deals, you hear me? What's wrong with you? Can't you see you're upsetting Ma? Mom's all right.
LEADFEMALE:You're the problem.
LEADMALE:You haven't changed, Steven.
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Emotional.
LEADMALE:Mom's upset, so let's get her out of here today.
LEADMALE:This minute.
LEADMALE:Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:Never mind we're getting taken in the deal.
LEADMALE:Why don't we just give the house away? Hey! Who wants a free house? What I said makes sense.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a painful time for Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get it over with.
LEADFEMALE:She belongs at the Oaks.
OTHERFEMALE:All her friends are there.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get her there.
LEADMALE:She'll get there.
LEADMALE:There's no big rush.
OTHERMALE:It's simple math, something you were never too terrific at.
SUPFEMALE:If we keep the house on the market, we get a lot more.
SUPMALE:What does "more" mean? She doesn't need more, she needs out.
LEADMALE:You're wrong.
LEADMALE:If we take this price, Mom goes to the Oaks, we're going to run out of money that much sooner.
LEADFEMALE:Then how are we going to support her? We'll worry about that when the time comes.
OTHERMALE:Oh, heh, they don't make 'em like you anymore, Steve.
LEADMALE:All heart, no brains.
LEADMALE:Boy, Dad needed to watch you.
SUPFEMALE:Now I've gotta look out for you.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're still the same kid who gave away a brand-new bike to the orphanage.
OTHERFEMALE:What was wrong with that? It was my bike.
SUPMALE:You never rode it.
LEADMALE:I never got a chance.
LEADFEMALE:I turned around, Sister Mary Francis was pedaling it away.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you bringing this up now, Rob? That was 30 years ago.
LEADMALE:It'll be 32 years in May.
LEADMALE:The point is you don't think like a normal person.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you never did.
LEADMALE:You don't think like Dad, you don't think like me.
OTHERFEMALE:You think like you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and that's very dangerous in the real world, Steve.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't talk to me this way, Rob.
SUPFEMALE:Not anymore.
OTHERMALE:I've come here to make sure Mom gets the very best.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want her hurt now.
LEADFEMALE:Who the hell are you, coming here telling me what's best for Mom? I'm here every day.
SUPFEMALE:I do her shopping.
SUPMALE:When she gets sick, she calls me up.
LEADFEMALE:When she has troubles in the middle of the night, I'm the one who comes over.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you, Steve? Where are you when your mother needs you? I'm asking you.
LEADMALE:Where the hell are you? Because you're sure as hell not here.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, get out here this minute.
LEADMALE:What's with him? We're late already.
SUPMALE:What's this? Why aren't you dressed? I'm not going.
OTHERMALE:What do you mean, you're not going? I'm not going.
OTHERMALE:I'm staying home.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter, Steven? Why don't you wanna come? I just don't want to.
LEADFEMALE:That's all.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma knows.
LEADMALE:It's okay with her.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not okay with me.
SUPFEMALE:When I say the family goes, the family goes.
LEADMALE:Now, you get upstairs and get dressed this minute.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You say no to your father? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, no.
LEADMALE:Both.
LEADMALE:Maybe Dad needs to talk to Steven alone.
LEADMALE:Come on, Robbie.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna get killed.
LEADMALE:I love Grandma.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish we could go there twice a week.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna say this quietly and only once.
SUPFEMALE:You are gonna go up the stairs, you're gonna get dressed, you're gonna get out in the car, and you're gonna go to Grandma's like a normal human being.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I go to school five days a week.
LEADMALE:I work every day after school and Saturday.
LEADFEMALE:So? So does every kid in America.
LEADFEMALE:So it's Sunday.
OTHERFEMALE:It's my day off.
LEADMALE:I should be able to do what I want to on my day off.
SUPFEMALE:You know what my father would do if I talked to him like that? He'd take out the strap? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm not afraid.
LEADMALE:You're not afraid? Actually, I'm petrified, but I decided that I was gonna make a stand today.
LEADMALE:This is your stand? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I should be able to visit Grandma when I want to, not when everybody else does.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, I'm going over there tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Who are you? Are you from this planet or what? Dad.
LEADMALE:It's me, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:This figures to be a pretty one-sided conversation, Dad, but there are some things I have to say to you.
OTHERFEMALE:I can just hear you 
SUPFEMALE:"Why do you have to bother me when I'm lying down?" I wanna tell you I'm sorry, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry for making it so hard for you.
SUPMALE:There's so much I wanna take back, make right.
SUPFEMALE:God.
LEADMALE:It all went by so fast.
LEADMALE:I wish I could do it all over again, but Then again, I don't think I could stand it.
LEADFEMALE:I just couldn't take Geometry again, Dad.
LEADMALE:Three times should be enough for anybody, you gotta understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a father of four kids now.
LEADMALE:Two sons, just like you had.
OTHERMALE:I hear you in me, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:I hear you when I tell Alex not to dribble the ball in the house, or tell Mallory not to come home too late, or Jennifer to finish her milk.
LEADMALE:I hear you, and I have a much better understanding of what you went through with me.
SUPFEMALE:I've learned from you, Dad.
LEADMALE:And I promise you now to use what I've learned to make the best life I can for my family.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'll say goodbye now, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:But we'll talk again.
SUPMALE:I just want you to know I love you so much.
LEADMALE:I always did.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear any of this, Dad? Do you hear me? It's me, Steven.
LEADMALE:Your son.
OTHERMALE:Hey, morning, Dad.
LEADMALE:Morning, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What you got there? Some of Grandpa's old papers.
LEADFEMALE:Anything interesting? Yeah, here's something you might enjoy.
OTHERMALE:Prospectus for a brand-new company called IBM.
LEADMALE:Huh.
LEADFEMALE:See what Grandpa wrote in the margin.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:"This company will be successful on a scale we can only begin to imagine.
LEADMALE:" Knew I got it from somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:My dad was very shrewd financially.
LEADMALE:Of course he was shrewd financially, Dad.
SUPMALE:You don't just get someone like me by accident.
OTHERMALE:It takes, uh It takes generations of breeding.
SUPFEMALE:Of nurturing that one special gene.
LEADMALE:The finance gene.
LEADMALE:Well, I didn't get any of it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it skips a generation, Dad.
SUPMALE:That means your kids won't get it.
SUPFEMALE:Don't even joke about that.
SUPMALE:So how much did grandpa invest in IBM? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:Nothing? No.
LEADMALE:Wh? I don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:See, your grandpa was great at pickin' 'em.
SUPMALE:But he was just too nervous to really risk his own family's money, not in a big way.
LEADFEMALE:He must have known he was right.
LEADFEMALE:I always do.
LEADMALE:A lot of these men who went through the Depression, it colored everything they did.
LEADFEMALE:They'd seen it all collapse, and they never really believed it wouldn't happen again.
OTHERFEMALE:Life insurance.
LEADFEMALE:They believed in that.
LEADMALE:Savings banks.
LEADFEMALE:Five percent, compounded quarterly.
LEADMALE:Small dreams, but safe.
LEADMALE:You know, I remember the, uh, first day I figured out what savings banks were really all about.
LEADMALE:You know, if they were able to pay you five percent to use your money, you could bet they were making a lot more than five percent on it themselves.
LEADFEMALE:I remember I came running home to tell you about it.
LEADMALE:I remember.
OTHERFEMALE:Your kindergarten teacher was furious.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, Miss McCullough.
LEADFEMALE:No head for business, that woman.
SUPFEMALE:It's funny, isn't it? You live a lifetime, this is what's left.
LEADMALE:My dad reduced to a stack of papers and files.
SUPMALE:Such a complex man.
SUPFEMALE:I really loved him, Dad.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:He loved you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, we were a lot alike.
OTHERMALE:You know, sometimes, uh, after you and I have a big talk or a political discussion, and I'd be sitting there 
OTHERFEMALE:"How did I get into this family?" I'd comfort myself by thinking of him.
LEADMALE:You know, I could see the connection.
LEADMALE:Sometimes late at night, I'd give him a call.
SUPMALE:I didn't know that.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:He'd get on, I'd 
SUPFEMALE:"Grandpa, quick.
OTHERFEMALE:Three reasons why liberalism can never work.
LEADMALE:" I don't imagine he had any trouble giving them to you.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:I feel close to Uncle Rob too.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's nice.
SUPMALE:I wish I felt closer to him sometimes.
LEADMALE:He's a good man, Dad.
LEADMALE:He, uh He's a lot more like you than you think.
LEADMALE:He just shows it differently.
SUPFEMALE:When did you become so wise about people, Alex? Well, Dad, I know a lot about conservative, financial-type older brothers.
LEADMALE:It's my specialty.
SUPFEMALE:Rob and I had some good times as kids.
OTHERFEMALE:It's funny how the years color your memories.
SUPFEMALE:I know you're going to find this hard to believe, but when you're older, some of your fondest memories in the world will be of Jennifer and Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:That is hard to believe.
LEADMALE:Morning, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, morning Uncle Rob.
LEADMALE:Hey, did you see the paper today? Bromwell Electronics? Up three and three eights.
LEADMALE:Yeah, ha-ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a good boy.
LEADMALE:He's a terrific kid, Steve.
SUPMALE:You should be proud of him.
LEADMALE:I am.
SUPFEMALE:He likes you too, Rob.
LEADFEMALE:And he respects you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if not the father, at least the son, huh? Robbie, we have to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I realize, uh, you and I have been at odds for a long time now, and, uh, there's a lot of unfinished business between us.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to bring up the baseball card thing again, are you, Steve? I didn't take your Joe DiMaggio.
LEADMALE:How'd we grow so far apart, Rob? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:One day, you were my little brother, tagging after me with a bat and a ball, shouting, "pitch 'em in.
LEADMALE:Pitch 'em in.
LEADFEMALE:" Next year, this snot-nosed, know-it-all teenager telling me what a terrible human being I was and how my values were all wrong.
LEADMALE:You always pitched 'em in to me, didn't you, Rob? Even when you were with your friends, the big guys, you always found a minute to come over and pitch in a few.
SUPFEMALE:I suppose I got a little annoying with that, huh? Ah, I'll be honest with you, Steve.
SUPMALE:You were a real pain.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to be.
LEADMALE:I idolized you, Rob.
LEADFEMALE:You were my big brother.
LEADMALE:I wanted to be like you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you remember when you were in the fourth grade, I got you on the baseball team with all the ninth grade guys? We used to sit around the locker room and talk about sex.
LEADMALE:I was always trying to be so grown up.
OTHERFEMALE:I was the only guy in fourth grade pretending he had kids.
LEADMALE:When did I become such a bad guy, Steve? When did that happen? You were never a bad guy, Rob.
SUPFEMALE:I think it was me.
SUPMALE:Maybe it didn't feel like Dad loved me, I don't know.
LEADMALE:You guys were always close.
SUPMALE:I was I was the outsider.
LEADFEMALE:Dad loved ya, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:He thought you were unbelievably weird, but he loved you.
LEADFEMALE:And he knew you loved him.
LEADMALE:I love you too, Rob.
LEADFEMALE:You're my big brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, look, uh, you know, I was just talking to Mom, and, uh Well, she really wants to move.
LEADMALE:Well, the sooner she does it, the easier it'll be for her, so maybe you're right.
LEADFEMALE:What's another $5000 against the time she has left? Oh, I don't know, Rob.
SUPFEMALE:You know a lot more about this stuff.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're here.
LEADFEMALE:You know best.
LEADMALE:Steven.
SUPFEMALE:I'm taking your financial advice.
LEADFEMALE:This is a big day for us.
LEADFEMALE:Don't blow it.
LEADMALE:Well, this is the last of it, Dad.
SUPMALE:Mom went upstairs to change Andrew.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:What about Jennifer and Mallory? Who? Your sisters.
LEADFEMALE:You sat next to them on the plane for three hours.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Those two.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, yeah, well, they're helping Mom with Andrew.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down for a minute, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sure, Dad, uh, something wrong? Mm-mm.
LEADFEMALE:You've become a good-looking young man, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks Thanks, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:You're a good-looking older man.
SUPFEMALE:You're a knockout.
SUPMALE:No, I mean it.
SUPFEMALE:You were You were pudgy as a kid, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:I was worried for a while.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, thanks, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Can't tell you what it means to a guy my age to know his dad thinks he's good-looking.
LEADMALE:I was afraid you had too much Uncle Harold in you.
OTHERMALE:He, um He had a little weight problem.
SUPMALE:That's only one guy, Dad? He was a nice man.
LEADMALE:Big booming laugh.
SUPMALE:Gosh, he's been dead for Oh, Uncle Wally.
OTHERMALE:He's dead too.
OTHERMALE:Aunt Edna, Cousin Janet, Uncle Les.
LEADFEMALE:They're all dead.
SUPFEMALE:All dead.
SUPMALE:Well, this has been fun.
LEADMALE:I got a date tonight.
LEADMALE:Thank God.
LEADMALE:It's amazing, Alex, isn't it? There's a little piece of all these people in you.
LEADMALE:Little movements, a smile, the way you tilt your head.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes when you walk a certain way, you're the spitting image of your Aunt Ethel.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, that's a real confidence builder before a date, Dad.
LEADMALE:It's family, Alex.
LEADMALE:You can't escape it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Oh, go ahead.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I didn't mean to keep ya.
LEADFEMALE:No problem, uh.
