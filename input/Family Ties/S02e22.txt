SUPMALE:mom, can I talk to you? - In a minute, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta finish my rÃ©sumÃ©, and then I'm off to the interview.
OTHERMALE:Uh, why don't you talk to your father? He can't help me.
SUPMALE:It's about boys.
SUPMALE:Yeah, how would I know about them? You know my philosophy, Mallory.
LEADMALE:If a boy makes you start asking questions, cut him loose.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how's the resume coming, mom? Finished.
SUPFEMALE:I fudged a little bit, but basically it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Did you, uh, - put in those things I told you? - Some.
LEADFEMALE:I left out the part about me designing the Eiffel Tower.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, ma, they never check that stuff.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, I hope not.
SUPFEMALE:I did take some of your advice, and I put all my attributes on page one, right at the top and the center.
LEADMALE:And then I hid the fact that I haven't worked in an office for 12 years on page two, under the staple.
SUPFEMALE:I also changed 12 years to 144 months.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know why I'm going on this interview anyway.
LEADMALE:They probably don't want me.
LEADFEMALE:They probably want someone more up to date, someone younger.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, grandma Moses didn't start painting until she was 80.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:That still gives you a couple years.
SUPMALE:Just trying to relax you.
SUPMALE:Mom, all you've been talking about the past two weeks is how much you want this job.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I thought you wanted to expand your horizons.
LEADMALE:I thought you wanted more challenging work.
SUPMALE:I thought you wanted to make more money.
SUPMALE:I do want all those things, but I'm scared.
LEADMALE:You've got first-day jitters, mom.
SUPMALE:I get the same thing every fall when I go back to school.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I worry about my new teacher, my new classroom, new kids everything.
LEADMALE:But the first day always works out for me.
LEADMALE:And it will for you, too.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, sometimes I throw up around lunchtime.
SUPFEMALE:Wha what are you worrying about? You're a terrific catch for any architectural firm.
LEADMALE:You know what you're doing, you're experienced, you're reliable.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, mom, let's go over your assets and your liabilities.
SUPMALE:Can't we just go over my assets? May I? Okay.
LEADMALE:Elyse Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's a nice name.
LEADFEMALE:That should count as an asset.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's a fine name, mom, but, uh, let's face it.
SUPMALE:It's not gonna get you the job.
OTHERMALE:Your, uh, references seem to be in order.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, enough.
SUPFEMALE:We don't have to add up your assets and liabilities.
SUPMALE:When they meet you and read this rÃ©sumÃ©, they're gonna be very impressed.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:You've all been very supportive.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to be late.
LEADMALE:Any last-minute advice? Ask about vacation.
LEADMALE:Find out if there's a gum ball machine.
LEADFEMALE:Be yourself.
LEADMALE:Don't tell 'em you're a woman.
SUPMALE:sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm I'm waiting here for Karen banks.
SUPFEMALE:You're lookin' at her.
OTHERFEMALE:Just kidding.
LEADMALE:Actually, I'm Karen dugan.
LEADFEMALE:Kidding again.
OTHERMALE:Bill Channing.
SUPMALE:Really? Would I kid you? Elyse Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:So you're here for the new job, huh? Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:I'm an architect myself.
LEADFEMALE:You are? You are.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'm Karen banks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:No kidding.
LEADMALE:She is.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry we have to meet here in bill's office.
OTHERFEMALE:The conference room is tied up.
LEADFEMALE:Bill, I would like to conduct an interview in here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I got a couple extra minutes.
SUPFEMALE:What would you like to know? I would like to know when you're leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:He is actually a very fine architect.
LEADFEMALE:I could tell.
OTHERMALE:May I see your rÃ©sumÃ©, please? Ah, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I have nothing to hide.
SUPMALE:Well, I see you haven't worked in an office for 12 years.
LEADFEMALE:Has it been that long? It didn't seem more than 144 months.
LEADMALE:A-anything else that needs clarification? Everything seems to be in order.
LEADMALE:Ah, no one really checks up on those rÃ©sumÃ©s anyway, huh? We do.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell me why you would like to take a full-time job again.
SUPMALE:Well, uh, I, um I am an architect.
LEADMALE:And now that my, uh, kids can take care of themselves, I-I thought I'd go back to, uh, to work, uh, for what I'm trained to do, in a - In a more meaningful way.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, but more than anything, I'm tired of working out of my kitchen.
LEADMALE:Do you know how hard it is working when When you know that you're just inches away from fudge brownies? Well, you won't have that problem here.
SUPMALE:There's one question I've been asking all the applicants.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:What do you feel should be the role of the architect in the 1980s? And what did they say? I think, uh I-I think we should take advantage of the new technology, but, uh, to build and not destroy.
SUPMALE:Uh, take for example the old Morgan house.
LEADMALE:It was beautiful.
SUPMALE:and they tore it down and put up a parking lot.
LEADMALE:Now, that's the kind of thing that makes me crazy.
SUPFEMALE:That was one of our jobs.
LEADMALE:Are you sure this dress is gonna be ready - for Chrissy's party? - Positive.
LEADFEMALE:It's a very simple pattern.
LEADMALE:You'll see, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna pick up this sewing stuff really quickly.
LEADMALE:Uh, remember, Mallory, the thread goes through the needle.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be surprised, Alex.
SUPMALE:I know how important it is for a woman to learn how to sew.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you're a real woman of the '80s.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:So how did the interview go? Hi.
SUPMALE:Not very well.
SUPMALE:She didn't like me.
SUPFEMALE:She was very, very cold.
LEADMALE:Now, it's not that I expected a big banner saying, "welcome back to architecture, Elyse Keaton.
OTHERMALE:" But I thought, well, at least, you know, a cake.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you made a good first impression, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:You always do.
LEADMALE:From the moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were the only architect for me.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I'm better off if I don't get the job.
LEADMALE:I mean, what do I need a job for? T-the commuting, having a boss.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I-I'm doing okay working here at home.
LEADFEMALE:I know exactly what you mean, mom.
LEADMALE:I mean, I could take geometry next semester.
SUPFEMALE:There's a chance I could handle it, but then there's a chance I couldn't handle it.
LEADFEMALE:So why bother, right? I-I don't think it's the same thing, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Elyse, it's okay to admit you're scared about a new job.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not scared.
LEADFEMALE:Don't answer that! M-maybe I'm a little scared.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, she is.
SUPMALE:One moment, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Speaking.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Karen.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Well, thanks for letting me know.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I got the job! Oh! They liked the fact that That I was older.
LEADMALE:And that I-i had more experience, and they appreciated my honesty at the interview.
SUPMALE:Go figure.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, bill.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, roomie.
LEADMALE:Hey, congratulations on getting the job.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:That's my table.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, where's mine? Right here.
LEADMALE:Just breaking it in for you.
LEADMALE:Well, nice to see you.
SUPMALE:How's everything? Actually, I'm having kind of a rough week.
LEADMALE:I can't get my girlfriend to give me her new phone number.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, why don't you just look it up in the book? You know her last name? Enough about me.
LEADMALE:You know, I think you're really gonna like it here.
LEADMALE:Why don't you let me introduce you to the machines.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, machines, come on over here and meet Elyse.
LEADMALE:All right, have it your own way.
SUPFEMALE:We've got the runnymede 1800k word processor, the merriwell c.
SUPFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:D.
SUPMALE:System.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, these machines are unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, they are.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Elyse, I see you're making yourself at home.
LEADMALE:-Yes.
LEADMALE:We were just talking about the machines.
LEADFEMALE:-Ah.
LEADFEMALE:I assume you're familiar with the merriwell computer-aided design and drafting system.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I-I've never actually used the merriwell, but, uh, how different can it be from any other appliance? Right.
LEADMALE:Well, it could be helpful with the Manhattan corporation project.
LEADMALE:We're bidding on a combination office building/health club.
LEADMALE:Bill is designing the office building part of the project.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be working on the health club.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sounds exciting.
SUPMALE:We have tentatively scheduled a presentation with Mr.
LEADMALE:halifax He's head of Manhattan For two weeks from tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:Two weeks? Isn't that enough time? I-it's more than enough.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADMALE:Site plan.
LEADMALE:Budget.
SUPMALE:Specifications.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for everything.
LEADFEMALE:So let's get to know each other.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me a little bit about yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Family? Kids? - I but i - I don't have any myself.
LEADMALE:Though I was married once.
LEADMALE:Well, twice if you count my cousin.
LEADFEMALE:So, what kind of stuff you been working on lately? Oh, well, the last thing You know, for my senior project, I worked on an entire city of the future.
LEADMALE:Large enough for a half a million people.
SUPFEMALE:It was quite a challenge.
LEADFEMALE:Maximizing geometric aesthetics while maintaining a restrained functionalism.
OTHERMALE:What did you say you did last? I-I just finished a remodel on the Wilsons' ranch house.
SUPFEMALE:We we totally redid the kitchen, which involved putting up a new beam to support the roof.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:A beam.
SUPFEMALE:So, guess you're pretty anxious to get your hands on those little babies, huh? No, I-i can wait my turn.
LEADMALE:Bill, I need to go over these design plans with you.
LEADMALE:There is nothing here that I wanted.
LEADMALE:It's the opposite of what we discussed.
LEADFEMALE:She wants me.
LEADMALE:Can't be much different than a typewriter.
SUPMALE:"The quick brown fox.
SUPFEMALE:" Oh.
LEADMALE:Bing.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, stop.
LEADFEMALE:Stop! Stop! Stop! Elyse, I can't believe you're still working.
SUPMALE:Why don't you take a break? The presentation is tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I'll take a break the day after.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? It's very flattering.
SUPMALE:Have you alerted women's wear daily? Mom, you've got to show Mallory how to do the other sleeve.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I forgot we were sewing tonight.
LEADMALE:I think I did a pretty good job.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you? She'll grow into it.
LEADFEMALE:I won't grow into it by Saturday.
LEADMALE:Mom, I need to wear it for Chrissy's party.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I can't help you tonight.
LEADMALE:That's what you've said for the past five nights.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, look, I'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:A-after you kids go to bed, I'll finish it.
LEADFEMALE:But the whole idea was for me to learn how to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, honey, you can't have everything.
LEADMALE:I am doing the best I can! Girls, girls, your mother's really busy.
LEADFEMALE:I think we should let her work, huh? Well, if you're too busy for us Mom, I sympathize with what you're going through.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, today's woman is in a very difficult position.
LEADMALE:Tradition and certainly biology have put her in the home.
LEADFEMALE:Now there are these ridiculous new feminist pressures for her to do things outside the home, like developing a career.
LEADFEMALE:Your anxiety is natural, mom.
LEADFEMALE:You can't fool with mother nature.
LEADFEMALE:Say good night, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, um I've done a lot of presentations.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes a little joke can get you off on the right foot.
SUPMALE:Maybe, uh Maybe something like this Um A guy and his, uh, dog go into a bar.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm just trying to help.
LEADMALE:A-aren't you supposed to come up with just one design, just one health club? Thank you, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I know what I'm doing.
LEADMALE:Look, once I've laid out all the options, I-I'm going to synthesize them into a single, coherent proposal.
SUPMALE:Elyse I can handle it! I can handle it! Look, Elyse, it's after 10:00.
LEADFEMALE:You promised to sew Jennifer's dress.
LEADMALE:You're gonna be up all night.
LEADFEMALE:You're obviously overworked.
SUPMALE:Now, why don't you talk to Karen about that? I can't! I can't I can't let her know I'm having problems already.
LEADMALE:But you are.
LEADFEMALE:You're pretending you know how to use the computer.
SUPMALE:You're working at a pace that's much faster than what you're used to.
SUPMALE:You're not used to their system there, and you're afraid to ask questions.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just say I'm failing on the job? All all I'm saying is that maybe you should ask for a little help at work.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, I could use a little help around here, too.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll be glad to help.
LEADMALE:That is exactly what I don't want! What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about.
LEADMALE:For the past two weeks, you've been doing more cooking than usual.
LEADMALE:You've been spending more time with the kids.
SUPMALE:You have been sweeter, kinder, more understanding than you have ever been in your life, and I am sick of it! I am trying to be supportive.
SUPFEMALE:I'm trying to help.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Steven, all sorts of women have families and full-time jobs without your help.
LEADFEMALE:That's because I'm not married to them.
LEADFEMALE:But you're telling me you'd like it if you were? Look, Elyse I know you're under a lot of pressure right now.
LEADFEMALE:Evidently you've got to let off a little steam, so go ahead.
SUPMALE:Nothing you can say will make me mad.
SUPMALE:And you call yourself supportive! So in conclusion, Mr.
SUPMALE:halifax, my goal here was to design an office that was more impressive than the offices of the heads of general motors, IBM, at&t, for, in my opinion, you are a more impressive executive than any of those men.
SUPFEMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's the, uh, that's the office in a nutshell.
LEADMALE:Uh, it was a pleasure to design.
LEADFEMALE:And if I may be so bold as to say, you were an inspiration.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you, bill.
LEADFEMALE:That was very good.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what do you think, Mr.
LEADMALE:halifax? It's not what I had in mind at all.
OTHERMALE:I didn't think so, and that's why I'd be more than willing to work on this until I get it exactly right.
LEADMALE:It's not what I had in mind, but I thought it was brilliant.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you have a keen eye.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure you never studied architecture yourself? Positive.
LEADFEMALE:Never been to college.
SUPFEMALE:Self-made man.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to go to college either.
SUPFEMALE:My parents made me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:halifax, I'm glad you're so pleased with the office building.
LEADFEMALE:Now Elyse will show us what the health club's going to be like.
LEADMALE:Warmed him up for you, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Go get him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm real excited about this project, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:halifax, as I'm sure you are, too.
LEADMALE:Before I start the presentation, I'm reminded of a little story.
SUPMALE:This man and his dog go into a bar Elyse.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't stop her.
OTHERFEMALE:This sounds good.
LEADMALE:What kind of a dog was it? Bill.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, please continue.
LEADMALE:And the bartender says, "hey" Elyse.
OTHERMALE:The presentation.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Um, here is the one-story plan.
LEADFEMALE:Here is the multi-story plan.
SUPFEMALE:And here we have a special one The underground gymnasium plan.
SUPFEMALE:Now, uh, within each plan there are several subplans, and we can go over the aspects of each, and you can decide which you like best.
OTHERFEMALE:You're being cute, right? You really just have one proposal.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you did design a health club, didn't you? I really didn't get a chance to narrow it down to just one.
SUPFEMALE:Believe me I wanted to, but I ran out of time last night.
SUPFEMALE:Had to make all those lunches before I went to bed, then I lost the sleeve on Jennifer's dress.
OTHERMALE:Let's start with the underground gymnasium plan.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, that will give you the best of all possible worlds.
SUPFEMALE:And who deserves that more than you, huh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:h? Karen, I'm a busy man.
LEADMALE:I don't have time to look through all these things.
SUPMALE:Now, I'm paying this architectural firm to design my building.
LEADMALE:If I wanted to design it myself, I would have done so.
SUPFEMALE:And I bet you'd have done a heck of a job, Mr.
SUPMALE:h.
SUPFEMALE:I have an idea.
LEADMALE:Why don't you put some of these plans on the computer, and we can see which you like best.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:The computer.
OTHERMALE:Well, why don't I just draw it up on pencil and paper.
LEADMALE:The computer's so impersonal.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I like it.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Uh, well Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I-i can't use the computer.
LEADMALE:Why not? I-I simply don't know how to use the machine.
LEADFEMALE:I've been faking it.
OTHERMALE:Karen, what's going on here? Is this some kind of affirmative-action thing? Did you have to hire that person? Now, see here, Mr.
OTHERMALE:halifax What is it? See here I didn't hear you that well.
SUPFEMALE:See? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:halifax, I-i apologize for wasting your time.
OTHERFEMALE:Karen, I'm I'm I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tired of pretending.
OTHERMALE:Pretending that I know everything about architecture today.
LEADFEMALE:Pretending that That having a job and And three kids is a piece of cake.
OTHERMALE:The the truth of the matter is it's It's hard to design a building under this kind of pressure.
OTHERMALE:It's it's hard using machines you've never even heard of before! And it is damn hard coming back to work after all these years.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that seemed to go pretty well.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven, I made such a fool out of myself.
OTHERMALE:What ever made me think I could handle a job like that? Elyse, just because this one presentation didn't work out doesn't mean you're not qualified for the job.
SUPMALE:How did the joke go over? Did you go Like I told you? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, Steven, I-it's Karen and bill - from the office.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, of course.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Steven.
LEADMALE:Boy, I've heard a lot about you, big guy.
OTHERMALE:I think you'll beat that morals charge.
LEADMALE:Elyse, Â¿quÃ© pasa? Oh, left your purse at the office.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:You got a lot of interesting things in there.
LEADMALE:Uh, I'm sure the three of you have a lot to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:You're out of here.
SUPMALE:You have a way with words, bill.
SUPMALE:Come and sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, why didn't you just tell me you were having problems? We all have problems at work, and we all ask each other for help.
SUPMALE:I-I guess I wanted you to think I could do the job.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's exactly what I do think.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, you have years of experience.
SUPFEMALE:You're practical, and yet you're one of the most creative people I've ever met.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I-I am really embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:I-I've been trying to do everything, and, uh, I can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I t-thought that was what you expected of me, and all the anger and frustration built up and just, well, came out.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it was something to see.
LEADFEMALE:You're quite beautiful when you're angry.
SUPFEMALE:We sifted through your ideas at the office.
LEADFEMALE:You came up with some good things.
LEADMALE:What I think we should do is talk about them together.
LEADFEMALE:You you still want me to work on the project? Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk about it in the morning.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you for the second chance.
LEADFEMALE:I-I was ready to come over tomorrow and clean out my desk.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can clean out mine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you a blowtorch.
OTHERFEMALE:We have to be going.
OTHERFEMALE:We're meeting Mr.
LEADFEMALE:halifax for dinner.
LEADMALE:Oh, I sure hope it goes better than the last time.
LEADFEMALE:He wouldn't let me eat until he was finished.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:I really appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:One of your beams? Steven! Kids! Yeah? What is it, hon? I'm still a working woman.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great! I think I owe everyone an apology.
LEADMALE:I think that's a very noble gesture.
SUPMALE:What did you do? Ever since I started working, I was taking all my irritability and nervousness out on you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I was trying to be the perfect working woman, the perfect mother, the perfect wife, and, uh, that's crazy, 'cause I'm not perfect.
OTHERMALE:Ah, mom, perfection's overrated.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I've been there.
SUPMALE:It hasn't been all your fault, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:If you're going to work, we've got to make some adjustments, too.
LEADFEMALE:As a future working woman, I'm with you 100%.
LEADMALE:That goes double for me.
SUPMALE:Not the bit about working.
LEADMALE:I think what we're trying to say, mom, is we're willing to help out more.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:So, mom What's for dinner? Uh, what I mean is, what would you like us to make you for dinner?
SUPFEMALE:
