LEADMALE:Uh You, uh You could have dressed more casually.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, this is very difficult for me to say.
LEADMALE:I'm having trouble coming up with the exact words, so I-I hope you'll forgive me if I kind of stammer and beat around the bush.
OTHERMALE:Uh, no No problem.
LEADFEMALE:Take your time.
SUPFEMALE:I quit.
LEADFEMALE:Quit? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, I know you've been wondering why a person like me applied for a housekeeping job in the first place.
SUPMALE:Well, it has crossed my mind.
LEADMALE:You see, I'm from a rich family, and we always had servants to take care of us and clean up.
LEADMALE:I never learned how to do anything like that.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I'm such a terrible cook.
LEADMALE:So you became a A housekeeper to learn to do those things.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:There's more.
SUPMALE:You see, I never had to do anything for myself, and so, in some ways, I never really grew up.
SUPFEMALE:After I got out of college, I had no interest in a In a career of any kind.
SUPMALE:I was bored.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, you became a housekeeper.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:There's still more.
SUPMALE:You see, I felt like I needed to cling on to somebody or something, so I met this man, an older man, recently separated from his wife, and we fell in love.
OTHERMALE:Are we up to the hou Housekeeping part yet? No.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, my parents didn't approve of him, but I didn't really mind because this man had asked me to marry him.
SUPMALE:Except he didn't.
SUPFEMALE:And I found out I wasn't the only girl he was dating and then he went back to his wife.
LEADMALE:So, all of a sudden, I found myself very alone and very scared.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, you became a housekeeper to earn a living.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I lived off my trust fund for a year, but then it ran out, so then Then what? Then I became your housekeeper.
LEADMALE:But not just for the money.
LEADMALE:Also for the companionship.
LEADFEMALE:See, I was hoping I'd find a really nice family that I could become close to since I was never really close to my own, and I did.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, uh can you excuse us for a minute? No, Alex, it's all right.
SUPMALE:Your father knows everything.
LEADFEMALE:Karen, I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I I feel terrible.
LEADMALE:I- I was so caught up in my In my own problems that I didn't pay any attention to your feelings.
LEADMALE:You said you didn't want to go.
LEADFEMALE:I should have respected that.
LEADMALE:Go? Go where? You know, it's ironic.
LEADFEMALE:One of the main reasons I came to work here was to avoid seeing him, and then tonight I had to see him.
LEADMALE:Um, see who? Dean McCall and And the rest of those guys are jerks.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, what would you have done in this situation? Uh, what situation is that? What's going on? It's very complicated.
OTHERFEMALE:I was just explaining why I'm quitting.
OTHERMALE:You're quitting? I knew that.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have to quit, Karen? Yeah, I do.
LEADFEMALE:For the first time tonight, I really felt in control of my life.
SUPFEMALE:It's It's time for me to move on now.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm really gonna miss you, Karen.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so am I.
SUPFEMALE:We were gonna cut your hair next.
SUPFEMALE:You're leaving at just the right time, Karen.
SUPMALE:I want to thank you for, uh For helping me out tonight.
OTHERMALE:I'm just sorry for what happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, forget about it.
LEADMALE:Man, I don't belong in that fraternity any more than, uh Than you belong in this kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:You're right, but I'm here and I'm kinda hungry.
SUPMALE:Would you like me to boil some waffles to go with the ice cream? No! 
LEADMALE:
