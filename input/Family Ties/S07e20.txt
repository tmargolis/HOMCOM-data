LEADMALE:Hey! - Hey, Lauren, come on in! - Hi.
LEADFEMALE: Long time, no see.
SUPMALE:Hey, Lauren.
SUPMALE:How was your psychology conference? It was great, except for I really missed Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Is he around? - No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't seen him.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't seen him.
LEADMALE:Out of sight, out of mind.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe he's with that other girl! - Andrew! don't know what you're talking about.
LEADFEMALE:You mean Marty.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's told you about her.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, he told me he was tutoring her.
LEADMALE:Oh, he is! - Oh, yeah, yeah, purely business.
SUPFEMALE:Business relationship, yeah.
LEADMALE:He's tutoring her.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE: Oh, look who's home! - Hey, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE: Hi.
LEADMALE:So, did you miss me? Yeah, sure, I did; sure, I did.
SUPFEMALE:You miss me? Well, sure.
LEADMALE:But I did get kind of friendly with a man at the conference who suffered from wide mood swings.
LEADMALE:See, he even signed my Freud anthology.
OTHERFEMALE:"Dear Lauren, it was nice to meet you.
OTHERMALE:P.
SUPFEMALE:S.
OTHERMALE:I can't stand you.
LEADMALE:" Uh, what do you want to do? You want, you want to go get a bite, something like that? No, let's just sit and talk.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, it's been two weeks.
SUPMALE:You know, I think that's the longest we've ever gone without seeing each other.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, not-not-not including the 20 years before we met.
SUPMALE: Alex, are you okay? Yeah, I'm just, I'm like really tired.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you're tired, then I'll just see you tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What? We've always said that we were gonna be completely honest with each other about everything.
SUPMALE:Alex, what is it? This girl that I've been tutoring, you know, from my economics class? Marty? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, we've been spending a lot of time together lately.
LEADMALE: And I would be lying to you if I, if I, if I didn't say that I was thinking about her a lot.
LEADMALE:Do you love her? I don't, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what I feel.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I'm thinking.
SUPMALE:I don't know anything.
LEADMALE:I just need a few days, okay? - Just a little bit of time.
SUPMALE:Okay, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren? Lauren? Are you all right? Of course, I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a trained psychologist.
LEADFEMALE:I know how to handle these types of emotions.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey, Marty.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Uh, Cecilia, can I get a yogurt? You're too skinny, Marty.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm not very hungry, and besides, I'm a little short of cash.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, it's on me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no no, no, no, I couldn't, really.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:I'm loaded.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, most of it's your money.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, then I'll have a meatball sub, in that case, and some soup, a large salad, uh, the yogurt, some milk, and-and some Twinkies.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:What, are you going into hibernation later today? Alex, we need to talk, so I'm gonna go I'll go get us a table.
LEADMALE:Yeah, all right.
SUPMALE: Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Lauren! Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Cecilia, can I get a yogurt, please? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I'll put it on Alex's tab.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I think we need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get us a table, okay? I don't believe this.
SUPMALE:This is like a bad episode of Love, American Style.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, there.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see, you had the yogurt and you had the yogurt, the meatball hero, the soup, the milk and the Twinkies.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if that'll be all for you ladies Alex, what's going on? Marty Brodie, this is Lauren Miller.
OTHERMALE: You okay? I'm fine, I'm fine.
SUPMALE:My doctor says I'm not getting enough calcium in my, in my nose.
LEADMALE:LAUREN & 
LEADFEMALE:I think I should go.
LEADFEMALE:No, look, look, I got a better idea, okay? Why don't I go? Alex, don't worry, you can stay, because I'm leaving.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, Lauren, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:You haven't even finished your yogurt.
OTHERFEMALE:I just decided I'm not hungry.
LEADMALE: Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:I paid $1.
OTHERFEMALE:20 for this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex, this is terrible.
SUPMALE:I really, I feel horrible.
LEADMALE:I cannot stay here Oh! Alex, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm I'm really hungry.
SUPFEMALE:Did you ever see Fatal Attraction? 
OTHERMALE:Hi, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Alex.
SUPMALE:Feel like catching a movie? No, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not really in the mood tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we're running late.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
LEADMALE: Bye-bye, Alex.
LEADFEMALE: See you later.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Alex, you okay? Oh, yeah, Dad, I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:Just a little distracted lately with this whole Marty-Lauren thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, look, I'd be more than willing to miss this movie so we can stay and talk.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not really up for it.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I got to stay here and work on my valedictory speech for graduation.
LEADMALE:I can't get a handle on it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you let me know.
SUPMALE:I'll be around.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE: I'm gonna need some quotations to kick this thing off.
LEADMALE:Let's see what we got here.
LEADMALE:Shakespeare Bunch of pretentious guys in tights talking to skulls.
OTHERMALE:Better than my speech.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren's Freud 
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:An Introduction.
LEADFEMALE:Nah, I think too much of myself to read that.
SUPFEMALE:Jean-Paul Sartre.
LEADFEMALE:You know, maybe Jennifer's right.
LEADMALE:Maybe life is absurd.
OTHERMALE: Of course it is! You think I was just trying to sell some books? Jean-Paul, don't take it personally.
LEADMALE:I'm just a little skeptical about this existentialism stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Look at your life.
LEADMALE:If that isn't absurd, I'll buy you a ribs dinner.
SUPMALE: Jean-Paul, you're wrong.
LEADMALE:His life is not absurd.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Dr.
LEADMALE:Freud.
SUPFEMALE:He is just highly sexually repressed.
LEADMALE:Jean-Paul, Sigmund, please, I got a problem I'm trying to work out here.
LEADFEMALE:I have an emotional attachment to two women.
OTHERMALE:It can't be worked out.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, don't you see? Love is an impossibility.
SUPFEMALE:It's nothing more than an attempt to justify one's own existence by possessing another in a futile gesture at warding off the bleakness of death.
LEADFEMALE:And you wonder why you don't get invited to more parties.
SUPMALE:You're wrong, Jean-Paul.
OTHERFEMALE:Love does exist.
LEADMALE:Yeah, back me up on this, will ya, Shakespeare? Uh, Bill? May I call you "Bill"? Please.
LEADFEMALE:As I wrote in Hamlet, about love "Doubt the stars are fire, "doubt that the sun doth move, "doubt truth to be a liar, but never doubt my love.
SUPMALE:" How do we really know you wrote those plays? Guys, guys, guys, come on.
OTHERMALE:Look, we're getting nowhere fast here.
LEADFEMALE:You're supposed to be three of the greatest minds in history.
LEADMALE:You can't help me out? The truth is, Alex, we don't know more about this than anyone else.
LEADFEMALE:In the end, we're all just poor players strutting and fretting our hours upon the stage.
SUPMALE:It's true.
SUPMALE:When it comes to love, as my friend Camus once said, "It can burn, or it can last, but it can't do both.
LEADMALE:" God, that's depressing.
LEADMALE:I want it to do both.
SUPMALE:Hmph! Don't we all? That's why people are so unhappy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm not unhappy.
LEADFEMALE:I would be if I was wearing that outfit.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex all I can say is to thine own self be true.
SUPFEMALE:And remember, you must take responsibility for your own choices in this life.
LEADMALE: Talk to your dad.
OTHERMALE: I should have gone to the movies.
LEADFEMALE: 
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Marty Iook at you at that piano.
LEADFEMALE:You look so right sitting there.
LEADMALE:So joyous, so full of life.
LEADMALE:You look like me filling out the new 1040 short form.
LEADMALE:There's so much I like about you.
LEADMALE:Of all the basic applied economic principles of capitalism in the post- industrial-era seminars in the world, you had to walk into mine.
OTHERMALE:This is crazy.
OTHERMALE:This can't work.
LEADMALE:I'm probably gonna go get a job on Wall Street.
LEADMALE:You've got two whole years of college ahead of you.
LEADMALE:So even though I know this is gonna hurt you, we got to stop kidding ourselves.
SUPMALE:We've got to bring this thing to an end.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never forget the time we spent together.
SUPMALE:The way you hold your knife, the way you sip your tea, the way you changed my life Oh, no, they can't take that away from me.
LEADMALE: Hey, hey, don't stop.
LEADMALE:I-I have to.
LEADFEMALE:It's-it's the end of the song.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just, I'm here practicing for the ceremony.
OTHERFEMALE:I've gotta, I've gotta practice the old "Pomp and Circumstance.
SUPMALE:" Oh, yeah? How's it going? Well, I've got the pomp down, it's-it's the circumstance that's giving me a little trouble.
LEADFEMALE:We got to talk about this, Marty.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know, Alex.
OTHERMALE:I-I've been thinking, and, uh, you know, even though I know this is gonna hurt you, I-I think that we've got to stop kidding ourselves and we've got to end this.
SUPMALE:After everything we've been through? Alex, really, the last thing I want to do is break your heart.
LEADMALE:Aah! Aah! Aah! It's a little late for that now, isn't it? Alex I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please.
SUPMALE:Can I just have a minute to be alone with my thoughts? I hope he doesn't start to cry.
SUPFEMALE: I'm not crying.
SUPMALE:There's something in my eye.
OTHERFEMALE: Excuse me? 
OTHERMALE:There's something in my eye.
LEADMALE: Do you want a tissue? Marty, Professor Heller needs you to look over the arrangement for the processional.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know you do.
LEADMALE:Good-bye, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPMALE:Bye, Miss Brodie.
SUPMALE: Oh, Lauren.
OTHERMALE:Two years such a long time.
LEADMALE:And there's been a lot of good times in those two years.
LEADMALE:Remember the first time we met? In that little psychology lab? It was really love.
SUPFEMALE:You were so beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you are so beautiful.
LEADMALE:I'm not so bad myself.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what happened to us.
OTHERMALE:But whatever it is, I've got to admit my true feelings.
SUPMALE:And be honest with you.
LEADMALE:And I know it's probably gonna crush you.
LEADFEMALE: And yet you seem to be handling it pretty well.
LEADMALE:I just have to be honest with her.
LEADMALE:Just tell her that she's a wonderful, decent, intelligent, unique individual.
LEADMALE:And that we're not in love anymore.
LEADFEMALE: Lauren.
SUPMALE:Hi, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Uh, can I talk to you for a minute? Sure.
LEADMALE:Excuse us.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren, I got to be honest with you.
SUPFEMALE:I have to be honest with you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, you're a wonderful, intelligent, decent, honest, unique individual.
LEADFEMALE:But we're not in love anymore.
LEADMALE:Nobody lets me get a word in edgewise.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, the last couple of days have been torture for me.
SUPMALE:I've been trying to 
SUPMALE:What did I do to make you stop loving me? Was it something I said or was it something I did or? Was it that I was just trying too hard? And then I realized it was nothing I did, and nothing you did it just happened.
SUPFEMALE:And it's wrong for me to try to be something that I'm not.
LEADMALE:The same goes for you, Alex.
LEADMALE:You're an obsessive person.
LEADFEMALE:You don't love many things, but the things you love, you really love.
SUPMALE:And either you love me or you don't.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you really know me.
OTHERMALE:I do.
SUPFEMALE:And I know myself.
SUPFEMALE:And I got to admit something to you.
LEADMALE:The other day when Marty was giving a recital at Delaware Hall, I went and I just wanted to see what the attraction was.
LEADMALE:I also brought some rotten tomatoes, just in case.
OTHERMALE:I sat there listening and I I saw she-she's a real artist.
OTHERFEMALE:She's kind of bohemian, and she's very exotic.
SUPFEMALE:And I can't compete with that.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren, you don't have to.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm not.
LEADMALE:I'm not I know who I am and I like myself.
SUPMALE:I'm intelligent, I'm attractive.
SUPMALE:And I'm a good person.
SUPMALE:But I'm not her.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm not gonna make believe that I can be.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go on with my life and find someone who loves me just as much as I love him.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever happens I just want you to know that I can't be happy unless I know that you're happy.
SUPMALE:I really like you.
LEADFEMALE:And, um, we had a lot of great times together.
SUPMALE:I want you to know that part of who I am I mean one of the best parts is what you gave me.
LEADMALE: You gave me a lot, too, Alex.
LEADMALE:I really love to tell you that I hope you and Marty make a great couple, but, um, I really can't.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well uh, the crazy thing is Marty and I aren't gonna be seeing each other either.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? I think I got to take some time to be with myself.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'll go to New York and, uh, get a job on Wall Street.
LEADFEMALE:Try and meet Leona Helmsley.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Lauren.
SUPFEMALE: What next? Huh? Locusts? Boils? Democrats in '92? Am I interrupting anything? 
LEADMALE:Mommy, my gown doesn't fit.
OTHERMALE:It's okay.
SUPMALE:Your hat's no bargain either.
LEADMALE:Let's-let's fix this.
LEADFEMALE:This is just like when you were a little boy.
SUPMALE:Couldn't get yourself dressed then either.
LEADFEMALE:You'd come out of your room with your shirt buttoned the wrong way, and your pants on backwards.
SUPFEMALE:Although always with a tie.
LEADMALE:You'd come into the kitchen, I'd say, "Alex, did you even look at yourself in the mirror?" And I'd say, "I couldn't Mallory took it to school.
SUPMALE:" What I wouldn't give to be eight years old again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're still dressing about the same.
SUPMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's get this hat for you, okay, um You know, moms were a good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, no matter what else is happening, no matter what anybody else is doing you're just always there for me.
LEADMALE:Well, we'll see.
SUPMALE: Okay.
SUPMALE:Let's try this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:Front.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hey, great, you did it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mom, you could give up architecture and go into tailoring.
LEADMALE:Mom? Hey, Mom, I'm only kidding, you know.
SUPMALE:You're a wonderful architect.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, it's not that.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't believe my little boy's graduating.
LEADMALE:You look very handsome.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well It's a good thing 'cause inside, I don't feel too terrific.
LEADMALE:Been a tough couple of weeks for you, hasn't it, honey? The worst.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, if you were eight years old again, I'd just kiss your boo-boo and make it better.
LEADFEMALE:But you're an adult now and that's, uh, that's a little more complex.
SUPMALE:I say we give it a shot.
LEADMALE:I love you so much, honey.
LEADFEMALE: Hey, you guys, come on, break it up.
SUPFEMALE:You got to sit down, graduation's starting.
SUPFEMALE:Well, can you give us a minute? We were just discussing the meaning of life.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's easy.
OTHERFEMALE:Be happy, try not to hurt other people and hope that you fall in love.
LEADFEMALE:It sounds good to me.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:Considering the source, that's truly frightening.
OTHERFEMALE:Well 
LEADFEMALE:So this is it college is finally over.
LEADMALE:Fortunately, it ends on a real high note for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Broke up with two wonderful women on the same day.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, maybe Jen really is right.
SUPMALE:Maybe life is absurd.
SUPFEMALE:Still, it has its moments.
LEADFEMALE:Even the painful ones.
OTHERFEMALE:Lauren this was a tough day for both of us.
SUPFEMALE:Still I don't regret one single moment we had together.
SUPFEMALE:And Marty, even if I never see you ever again, you'll always be a beautiful, wonderful memory.
SUPMALE:You know, Jen, your pal Jean-Paul Sartre once said, "Hell is other people.
LEADMALE:" Well, anybody who's seen a few game shows knows what he means.
SUPMALE:But I think he's only half-right.
LEADFEMALE:Because Heaven is other people, too.
LEADMALE:I mean, after all, when you get right down to it, we are all we've got.
OTHERFEMALE:And no matter how much we may argue or fight or hurt one another, in the end, we just keep running back for more because we're human.
SUPMALE:And for some strange, unexplainable reason, we need each other.
LEADMALE:And maybe that's the only real wisdom any of us will ever have.
LEADMALE:That and the words of another very great philosopher who just happens to be my sister Mallory, I 
LEADMALE:"The meaning of life is to be happy, "try not to hurt other people and hope you fall in love.
LEADFEMALE:" It's ironic.
LEADFEMALE:After all these years of learning, Mallory teaches me the most important lesson of all.
SUPMALE:Boy, life is funny sometimes, isn't it? so now I present to you the valedictorian of the class of 1989, Alex P.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:
