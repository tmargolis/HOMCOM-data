LEADMALE:Alex, will you give us a hand? The Lamaze class is gonna start any minute.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, I can't believe you guys are actually going through with this craziness.
LEADMALE:Nothing crazy about Lamaze, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's a method of natural childbirth.
LEADMALE:The husband assists the wife in the delivery room, and no anesthetic is used.
LEADMALE:See, now, that's crazy.
OTHERMALE:Look, the natural way to have a child, Mom, is for the man to be in the waiting room, smoking, pacing.
SUPMALE:And And the woman to be in the delivery room drugged out of her mind.
SUPFEMALE:You make it sound so attractive.
SUPMALE:I think when I have a baby, I wanna be unconscious.
LEADFEMALE:You're off to a good start.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Whoa, that must be the pregnant women, Dad.

OTHERMALE:They're all so young.
SUPMALE:That's true.
LEADFEMALE:Babies are young.
LEADMALE:No, I-I mean the people in the class.
LEADFEMALE:We're so much older than they are.
LEADFEMALE:So what? So maybe we're too old.
SUPMALE:Too old for what? To have a baby.
SUPMALE:Obviously not.
SUPFEMALE:You don't feel that way? No.
LEADMALE:So you have no sympathy and understanding for the way I feel about this? Not really, no.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, I know what you're going through.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going through the same thing myself.
LEADFEMALE:We're geezers.
LEADMALE:Well, what if we're geezers that are too old for natural childbirth? What if I can't manage this? Well, look, this isn't a contest.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, Elyse, you're the healthiest, strongest woman I know.
LEADMALE:And you're just as young and as beautiful as the day we met.
OTHERFEMALE:You're saying that to make me feel good.
OTHERFEMALE:It's working.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Elyse, we're training for this.

OTHERFEMALE:How are ya, Steve? I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Okay, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:I think we should get started.
OTHERMALE:Now, if you remember, last week, we talked about the importance of a comfortable birthing position, remember? I call it nesting.
OTHERMALE:Now, what I'd like to do is have the birthing partners arrange the pillows on the mats for the mothers.
LEADFEMALE:Here, Donna.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Let me, uh Let me show you to your nest.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Whoa, this looks like a good area to build.
OTHERMALE:Uh, pardon me, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Is this area zoned for nests? Thank you, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:That's very sweet.

SUPMALE:Elyse.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:What's going on? Why is he building nests? He's just being helpful, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:It's his first nest.
SUPFEMALE:Don't make him self-conscious.
LEADFEMALE:Extend your left hand.
OTHERMALE:Make a fist.
LEADMALE:Contract the muscles as you inhale.
SUPMALE:Hold it.
LEADFEMALE:Exhale and release.
SUPFEMALE:Now, partners, check the arms for relaxation.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm, uh I'm checking your arm for relaxation.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, do you mind? No.
LEADMALE:During this exercise, you should be giving your partner warm, supportive messages.
SUPFEMALE:I'm, uh very proud of you, Donna.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Dad.
LEADMALE:I love you too, Alex.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? Uh, Donna, listen, I've been thinking, uh, about what we were talking about the other day.
SUPFEMALE:You know, about, uh About you being, uh, alone and, uh, kinda scared.
LEADFEMALE:You have? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, uh I wanna be your birthing partner.
SUPMALE:What? We hardly know each other.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, what better way to get acquainted? We'll have a baby together.
LEADMALE:I don't understand how you're handling it well as you are.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not a problem.
SUPMALE:Alex is just experiencing the joy and exhilaration of fatherhood for the first time.
LEADMALE:It's a life experience we shouldn't deny him.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna deny him the experience of fatherhood.
LEADFEMALE:I just think he should actually be a father first.
SUPFEMALE:I think he's doing a wonderful thing for this girl.
SUPFEMALE:Now, haven't we always encouraged him to be helpful and supportive? He could send her a card.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Elyse, I just think this has gone too far.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't.
LEADMALE:Your 18-year-old son is touring Saint Vincent's Hospital with a pregnant woman at this very moment.
SUPMALE:You don't think it's gone too far? No.
SUPFEMALE:What's all that lumber doing in the garage? Oh, it's Alex's.
OTHERFEMALE:He's building a crib.
SUPFEMALE:A crib? Mom, if Alex is gonna be a father, does that mean I'm going to be an aunt? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, sort of.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:No, it doesn't.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Alex may not be much of a brother, but something tells me he's gonna make a pretty good father.
LEADMALE:He's not going to be a father.
LEADFEMALE:And you know, Jen, the The best part is that Alex will have someone around who's shorter than he is.
LEADMALE:For the first few years, anyway.
SUPMALE:Enough! Enough.
SUPMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Go get Get ready for dinner.
LEADMALE:Steven, relax.

OTHERFEMALE:You know, Donna, do you realize that sometime in the next six weeks, we are about to become parents? Well, that's not exactly true.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Okay, five weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Um, I was thinking about nursery schools.
SUPMALE:Now, I don't think we should send him to one that pushes academics, you know? Alex And A-and also, I was thinking that I'd really like him to grow up in this neighborhood, you know? I mean, come on, good enough for the old man, it's good enough for him.
SUPMALE:And And And I wanna take him to all the places that my folks took me when I was a kid.
LEADMALE:I can hardly wait to take him to the bank.
SUPMALE:Alex, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:You're talking about us like we're a family.
OTHERMALE:You're not about to become a father.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I know it's not my baby, okay? But that doesn't bother me.
SUPMALE:It really doesn't.
OTHERMALE:A- and I know it's not gonna be easy, but the three of us will make it through.
LEADMALE:Alex, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You're talking about us like we're a real couple, like we're gonna live together, like we're gonna get married or something.
SUPFEMALE:I hadn't thought about it that way, but, uh what the heck? Let's get married.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, we're not in love with each other.
OTHERMALE:We're in love with the idea of being a family.
LEADFEMALE:There's a big difference.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not for me, Donna.
LEADMALE:We've been playing house like a couple of kids.
LEADMALE:I'm the mommy, and you're the daddy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I got caught up in it too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look, can't you just get caught up in it again? No, I can't.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, you're very sweet, and I think it's so nice that you wanna help me, but our relationship's not based on anything real.
LEADFEMALE:So what? Alex, I think you're a wonderful person, and I care for you a lot.
SUPMALE:But we can't keep going on as if we're really gonna share our lives.
LEADMALE:Donna.
SUPFEMALE:This just can't work.
LEADMALE:Donna.
SUPMALE:Yes, Alex? That's my cow.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, Dad.
OTHERMALE:You see, the war was symbolic of Hi, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Where's Donna? She, uh She left.
SUPFEMALE:Symbolic of what, Jennifer? Don't leave me hanging.
LEADMALE:Of man's alienation from his own emotions.
SUPFEMALE:Can I play with your cow, Alex? Did you practice your Lamaze with Donna? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, uh Donna and I had a slight falling out.
LEADMALE:We're never seeing each other again.
LEADMALE:What happened? I'd rather not talk about it, okay? Come on, Alex.
SUPMALE:What happened? Mallory, it's personal, all right? Do you mind? Well, I tell you personal things all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? I told you I love Boy George.
SUPFEMALE:That's not personal.
LEADMALE:That's scary.
LEADFEMALE:That's the last time I open up to you, Alex.
LEADMALE:What happened, Alex? Well, Donna just said she doesn't feel the same way about me that I feel about her.
SUPFEMALE:She never has.
LEADFEMALE:How do you feel about her? Mom, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:She changed my life.
LEADFEMALE:She was almost the mother of my child.
LEADFEMALE:But how do you feel about her? I just told you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it It was so perfect.
LEADMALE:I mean I mean, it was a complete package.
LEADMALE:A great-looking girl, a baby Boom! Instant family.
LEADMALE:You know, it would have been all settled for me.
LEADMALE:I would have skipped all that stuff like, uh, meeting girls and dating.
LEADFEMALE:Falling in love.
LEADFEMALE:Most people look forward to the falling in love part.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, I'm not like most people, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:No argument there.
LEADMALE:No argument there.
LEADMALE:You know, Dad, this whole thing is your fault.
LEADMALE:If you, uh If you weren't such a great father, I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to become one.
LEADFEMALE:I meant well.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, and, uh And you make mothering look real good too, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Alex.
LEADMALE:I guess I just got carried away, huh? No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:It could've happen to no one else in the world.
LEADFEMALE:
