LEADFEMALE:Okay, now don't roll the dough too thin.
LEADMALE:The cookies will burn in the oven.
SUPFEMALE:Why can't we get them at the store like everybody else does? It's more fun this way.
LEADMALE:This is a special time between a mommy and her little boy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, just the two of us here together, kind of working, sharing, creating.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, they're just cookies.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! Okay, guy, we'll try it again tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hot cookies.
LEADMALE:Spud Webb.
LEADMALE:Hey, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:Andy, what are you wearing? An apron.
OTHERFEMALE:Take that off this minute.
SUPFEMALE:Guys don't wear aprons.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, that's my apron.
OTHERMALE:This is a totally inappropriate activity for Andy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh, making cookies? It's one step away from having his nails done.
LEADMALE:That's tomorrow.
LEADMALE:All right, it's time for the guys to take over, teach him a little grit.
SUPFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
OTHERMALE:We've-we've been raising him in a sensitive, nonsexist atmosphere for almost six years now.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything's worked out fine, right, Steven? Well, um, you know, uh sure, sure.
LEADMALE:But there's, uh, there's nothing wrong with a little balance.
SUPMALE:Little yin, a little, uh Yang.
LEADMALE:yang.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's, uh, maybe it's time to try something different, something guy-ish.
SUPFEMALE:Want to go shave? Hey, how about basketball, huh? Basketball.
LEADFEMALE:It'll teach you the thrill of competition, the exhilaration of exercise, the reward of team spirit.
OTHERMALE:You just want someone you can beat, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I beat you, blondie.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't have beaten me, Alex, if you'd have let me use both hands.
SUPMALE:Oh, I thought I heard Nick down here.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What's going on? - Thanks.
LEADMALE:Um, Nick had a job interview.
SUPFEMALE:He's supposed to come over here afterwards.
LEADMALE:What kind of job is Nick trying to get now? It's a grant.
LEADMALE:I saw the job listing on campus, and I knew Nick would be perfect for it.
LEADMALE:What is it? Dean of Admissions.
LEADFEMALE:I'll keep my fingers crossed, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Jen.
LEADMALE:Hey, what happened? Did you get it? When do you start? Aw, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't get the job.
SUPMALE:You know, I don't think I'm going to be Dean of Admissions.
LEADMALE:I am shocked.
LEADFEMALE:I, for one, am flabbergasted.
LEADFEMALE:Stunned.
SUPMALE:That's an outrage.
LEADMALE:Why not? You know, for one thing, the job starts at 9:00 in the morning, and I like to do my art then.
LEADMALE:Either that or lie there and stare at the ceiling.
SUPMALE:You don't want to give that up.
LEADMALE:What about being Dean of Admissions for night school? Nah, Mal, you know, I think this whole dean area is a dead issue.
LEADFEMALE:You can head up the English Department.
OTHERFEMALE:There was this other job that they thought I might be right for.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, janitor.
SUPMALE:Nick, I think you're on to something.
SUPFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, this is the janitor job at my sorority.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm the one who wrote the ad.
LEADMALE:"Janitor needed.
LEADMALE:Must have previous trash experience.
OTHERFEMALE:" How romantic.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you have previous trash experience, don't you, Nick? Well, I don't want to toot my own horn, you know.
OTHERMALE:This is exciting.
OTHERFEMALE:You, my sorority, trash.
LEADMALE:It's all coming together.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, there's just two more applicants for the janitor job.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Larry Briganti and Nick Moore.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, maybe you should sit out those interviews.
LEADMALE:I mean, with your boyfriend being one of the applicants and all.
LEADMALE:Karen, I'm going to be completely and totally impartial here.
OTHERFEMALE:I want what's best for the sorority.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Briganti, can you tell us something about your qualifications? I was chairman of the Custodial Institute of America from 1945 through 1980, Ohio Janitor of the Year 1983, and inventor of the world famous Johnny Mop.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's all fine and good, but, uh, have you ever worked at a sorority before? Can't say that I have.
LEADMALE:Well, do you think you could handle a place of this size? Well, I mean, if the White House wasn't a problem, I can't imagine this place would be.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:We'll-we'll have to get back to you.
LEADFEMALE:W-Well, let me know as soon as you can.
OTHERMALE:It's either this or the Taj Mahal.
LEADMALE:Nick Moore, please.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:That's janitor for "hello.
LEADMALE:" Sisters, this is Nick Moore.
LEADFEMALE:Let's give him a nice Gamma Delta Gamma "hi.
LEADMALE:" Hi.
LEADFEMALE:So, Nick, um, can you tell us something about yourself? Well, you know, I-I got to tell youse all right off, I have no janitorial experience.
LEADFEMALE:I like that.
LEADFEMALE:He's honest.
LEADMALE:That's the most important thing in a janitor.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you know, uh, I know if it wasn't for Mal here, I wouldn't even be considered for this job, and, uh, I got to tell youse, I feel a little bit nervous being around all you smart girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Nick, no, don't be, please.
LEADFEMALE:No one's ever been nervous around us.
OTHERFEMALE:No one's ever called us smart, either.
LEADMALE:Uh, you know, I can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:You see, uh, college is not a place that I'm all that familiar with.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, actually, uh, high school is not a place I'm all that familiar with, either.
SUPFEMALE:But, uh, reform school, ha! Now, there's something we could talk about.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, Nick, a formal education is not a requirement for this job.
LEADMALE:Hey, then I'm your guy.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, some-some interpersonal, uh, qualities you-you have that we might not know about could be helpful.
LEADFEMALE:Um, for instance, um, just a Are you an artist? Why, yes, I am.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! It might be great having an artist in residence.
OTHERMALE:He can help us with floats, banners, posters.
LEADMALE:Maybe he could help us come up with decorations - for the winter dance.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Well, uh, what seems to be the problem? We've tried paper snowflakes, paper snowmen.
SUPMALE:It's just, it's all been done before.
LEADFEMALE:We've got a wastebasket full of bad ideas.
SUPFEMALE:Well, wait a minute, here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, uh, what you see as, uh, bad ideas, I see as snowballs.
LEADMALE:What? Uh, you see, you could, uh, you could take a whole bunch of these and, uh, crumple them all up and cut them into snowballs and have a winter wonderland of snowballs for your sorority dance.
LEADFEMALE:I like that.
SUPMALE:I like that.
LEADFEMALE:Go with it.
OTHERMALE:Uh, see, you can, uh, throw them at each other and have a fight, or, uh, you can glue them together and make a fort, or you could just pour water on them and turn them into slush.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:All those in favor of Nick? Aye.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's settled.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome, Nick.
LEADMALE:Let's all give him a nice Gamma Delta Gamma "You're hired.
OTHERMALE:" You're hired! Okay, now, the object of the game is simply to toss this ball into the basket.
OTHERFEMALE:Humor him.
SUPMALE:All right, now try it.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, that's pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:That's pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:Now let me, uh, let me show you how it's done.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Oops.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, Dad, let me have a shot.
LEADFEMALE:I think Andy should have the pleasure of seeing the ball actually go through the hoop once.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the ball.
OTHERMALE:Forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, give me the ball.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm teaching him.
SUPMALE:Give me the ball! - I'm teaching him! Andy, let's get out of here before it gets ugly.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Two points! Oh! What is going on? We're-we're teaching Andy how to, how to play basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Andy - Andy? I don't want any more basketball in the house, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:You know, he really is a discipline problem, Mom.
LEADMALE:Cheater.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hey, you going out? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Nick's coming over to pick me up.
LEADMALE:We're going to go to his place and watch TV.
LEADFEMALE:How's Nick doing down at the sorority? Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Um, he gets along really well with all the girls, and they all think he's lots of fun.
LEADFEMALE:So he's always hanging out there and learning songs and stuff.
OTHERMALE:I-I really admire what Nick's doing.
SUPMALE:It must be awfully hard to be a janitor.
SUPMALE:Especially at your sorority.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he's really gotten into it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he's always there.
OTHERFEMALE:But today he's coming over, and it's just going to be the two of us together.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to make popcorn and watch cartoons.
OTHERFEMALE:The old think tank in action, huh? - Have a wonderful time.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Um, Nick, what's going on? Uh, Mal, little change of plans.
OTHERMALE:We're all going to go over the football game.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I-I thought we were going to spend the afternoon together.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, just the two of us.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know, you know, but that was before the girls asked me to go to the game.
OTHERMALE:You never liked football before, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:I never knew the cheers before.
SUPMALE:But now Hear us rave.
SUPFEMALE:Hear us rant.
SUPMALE:Win team, win.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go, Grant.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey! Hey! Hey.
SUPFEMALE:This is really scary.
LEADMALE:Come on, uh, you know, it's Sorority Day.
LEADMALE:All us girls get in for half price.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:I have a lot of homework to do.
SUPMALE:So you all go ahead and have fun.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:All right, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, we'll see you later, huh? And, uh, don't work too hard, huh? Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Hear us rave! Hear us rant! Win team, win! Let's go, Grant! Hey! - Okay.
LEADMALE:Where's Mallory? She's upstairs getting ready for her sorority dance.
SUPMALE:I want to give her this truck for her to bring with her tonight.
SUPMALE:That's a great idea, Andy.
LEADMALE:That'll make Mallory the only girl at the dance with a truck.
SUPMALE:Everybody will be really jealous.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's give Mallory that truck.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure she doesn't have anything like it in her closet.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's great.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on! - I'm telling.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, oh! Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, this is the one that counts.
SUPMALE:Hey, short stuff! Steven, we need a lightbulb up here! All right, you're both grounded.
LEADMALE:I told you this would happen.
LEADMALE:You told me? I told you.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I've been telling him for days.
SUPMALE:He started it.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Jen.
SUPFEMALE:That's a fabulous dress, Mallory.
SUPMALE:It really goes with the truck.
LEADMALE:Boy, you sure look great, honey.
LEADMALE:Really.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just not up for it tonight.
SUPMALE:I mean, ever since they made Nick an honorary member of the sorority, I never get to see him alone anymore.
LEADFEMALE:And when I do, it's always Gamma Delta Gamma this, Gamma Delta Gamma that.
SUPMALE:It's making me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:I never thought I-I'd have to call my boyfriend "Sister.
OTHERMALE:" Oh, I don't know, Mal, I think it's kind of cute.
OTHERMALE:I mean, picture him right now.
LEADFEMALE:He's at home, choosing an outfit, primping, putting on Dippity-do.
LEADMALE:I can't believe the way Nick has changed.
SUPMALE:Now he's hopping around all the time, perky, singing.
LEADFEMALE:It's like going out with Annette Funicello.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, did you tell him how you feel? No, not yet.
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Mal.
LEADFEMALE:It's Sister.
SUPMALE:Say, uh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton? - Mm-hmm? Would you be interested in buying some raffle tickets? - No, I - You see, we're trying to bring some members of our sorority over from China.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, th-that's great, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:We're just leaving, too.
SUPFEMALE:Ah-ah-ah, but-but-but let me share with you, uh, a little secret that I learned from the girls.
LEADFEMALE:Hairspray helps remove ink spots.
SUPFEMALE:Got it.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, Mal, you look great.
LEADMALE:Nick, I think you've been taking the sorority stuff a little too seriously.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Well, uh, you know, Mal, I was hoping maybe some of it would rub off on you.
SUPFEMALE:And if something does rub off on you, may I suggest rinsing it briskly with some Epsom salt.
LEADMALE:Nick, I think you're missing my point.
SUPMALE:I think you've become a little too involved with Gamma Delta Gamma.
OTHERMALE:Well, Mal, you know, I think you take Gamma Delta Gamma a little for granted.
OTHERMALE:You see, I don't think you show it enough respect.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, you know, I have been reviewing the, uh, Gamma Delta Gamma rule book, and, uh, I have found out that you break almost every rule in it.
LEADMALE:For instance, you should only entertain male visitors on the porch or in the parlor.
SUPMALE:You should never cross your legs while wearing a skirt.
LEADFEMALE:And at all sorority functions after 6:00 p.
LEADFEMALE:m.
OTHERMALE:, you should always wear gloves.
OTHERFEMALE:Nick, those rules are from 1937.
SUPMALE:Hey, so what? You know, you still got to follow them.
LEADMALE:Listen, Mal, I would really hate to bring you up on charges.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, you're a Gamma Delta Gamma girl, huh? Act like one.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, babe, great party, huh? Oh, yeah, it's great.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't mind me doing a little cleaning up now and then.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, go right ahead; it's your job.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, you know, say, you really should put that drink on a coaster, not on the table.
OTHERMALE:You're going to ruin the finish there.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Nick, congratulations.
OTHERMALE:Everyone just loves all the decorations.
LEADFEMALE:You really did a great job.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, thanks.
LEADMALE:My favorite is definitely the mothball igloo.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:You know, it's, uh, attractive and snow-like, yet it keeps pests away from our fine woolens.
LEADFEMALE:You're incredible.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, everyone! It's time to sing the Gamma Delta Gamma sisterhood song! Where did you get that verse? Ah-ah-ah, read your rule book.
SUPFEMALE:Nick, you really didn't have to sing that song.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, I did, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:If you read the rule book No, I don't want to read my rule book.
LEADFEMALE:And now, the moment that we've all been waiting for, the crowning of the 1987 Gamma Delta Gamma Winter Dance Snow Queen.
LEADMALE:I am so excited.
LEADMALE:You know, I've been pushing for you for Snow Queen all week.
LEADMALE:That's sweet, Nick.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:The new Snow Queen is Nick Moore! Whoa! I can't believe that my boyfriend's a Snow Queen.
LEADMALE:Uh, ladies, gentlemen, sisters this is a most momentous occasion.
LEADMALE:Nick, God, stop it! What do you think you're doing? Uh, Mal, I'm just saying my acceptance speech here.
SUPMALE:I Nick, Nick, take a look at yourself.
LEADMALE:You're not a sorority sister.
LEADMALE:I mean, what are you doing in a crown, a cape and a dozen roses? I won.
LEADMALE:Nick, you have a job here, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't you just show up, punch in your time card and go home? Okay, uh I'll leave.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:She moves! She fakes! She pumps to the left! She pumps to the right! She's all over the court! She sets her shot! - Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:How many times do I have to throw this thing away?! You're grounded.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:How was, uh, how was the dance? Aw, I had a terrible time.
LEADFEMALE:Nick spent half the evening cleaning up, and then he sang the Gamma Delta Gamma song solo, and then he was crowned Snow Queen.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like a full evening.
OTHERFEMALE:I yelled at him in front of everyone.
OTHERMALE:I mean, there he was, the Snow Queen, surrounded by his ladies-in-waiting and I just flipped out.
LEADMALE:Well, don't worry about it, Mal.
SUPMALE:Uh now that Nick is Queen I'm sure he'll calm down.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, didn't you talk to him? I mean, didn't you tell him you thought he was getting carried away? I tried; he wouldn't listen to me.
SUPMALE:He-he kept giving me etiquette lessons and household tips.
SUPMALE:Well, you know, I tried that hairspray trick.
LEADMALE:Really works.
LEADMALE:Oh, Nick! - Hey, Nick! Well, we've-we've heard the news.
LEADMALE:Congratulations! - Yeah.
SUPMALE:Nick, Nick, just tell me.
SUPFEMALE:Tell me, what-what do you think put you over the top? Was it talent? Swimsuit? Uh, just lucky, I guess.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's an honor to have the Snow Queen in our house.
LEADMALE:Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, good evening, Your Majesty.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Evening.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:So, uh, how'd the rest of the dance go? All right, I guess.
LEADFEMALE:Um, we had to elect a new Snow Queen.
SUPMALE:But, uh, you're still the runner-up.
LEADMALE:It's an important job.
OTHERFEMALE:Case the new Snow Queen can't fulfill all her responsibilities, you'd have to step in.
SUPMALE:Look, um, Mal, I've been thinking about what you said and, uh, how I've been acting lately, and I kind of realized that I went over the edge with this sorority stuff and Oh, no, no, I'm-I'm the one who I totally overreacted.
LEADMALE:I mean, you have a right to have fun.
LEADFEMALE:Not every guy gets to be Snow Queen.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you know, I just had no idea that it would bother you so much.
SUPMALE:You know, it's just, I got so caught up with being part of a group, a member of a club.
LEADFEMALE:I never had that.
SUPFEMALE:I It just felt good to belong.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I didn't know you needed that.
LEADMALE:I always thought you were a loner.
SUPMALE:You know, I never really did good in group situations.
LEADMALE:I never really fit in.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, the sorority was the first group that really accepted me as me.
LEADMALE:I finally fit in.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I felt like you fit in too well.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you were always at the sorority, and you were always with the girls.
LEADFEMALE:I never got to see you alone.
LEADFEMALE:And, um, I guess I felt a little threatened.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because I didn't feel special anymore.
LEADMALE:Because all of a sudden, you're-you're spending time with all these girls and you're having all this fun with them the kind of fun I thought you could only have with me.
OTHERFEMALE:And I I felt like you didn't need me anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'll always need you.
OTHERFEMALE:You are my girlfriend, they are just my sisters.
LEADMALE:Well, you're my sister, too Look, Mal, you are very, very special to me.
SUPMALE:I am? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Because you're the only girl that I'll ever love.
SUPMALE:I love you, Nick.
LEADMALE:I propose a toast.
LEADMALE:To the best janitor and Snow Queen in the history of Gamma Delta Gamma.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you got a coaster for that?
LEADMALE:
