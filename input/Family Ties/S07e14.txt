LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Notice anything different about me? - Not a thing.
SUPMALE:Hair's a little different? I'll give you a 
LEADFEMALE:It happens when you're 16, and once it happens, you're never the same again.
LEADMALE:Jennifer! - What?! - No! Yes, yes.
LEADMALE:I got my learner's permit.
OTHERFEMALE: Okay.
LEADFEMALE:That's a relief, and I don't even know why.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, you must be so excited! Getting your learner's permit is a big event.
LEADFEMALE:And you've got something else to get excited 
SUPFEMALE:Driving lessons with your good old dad.
OTHERMALE:Boy, "excited" is such a subjective term.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Dad, I really appreciate that you want to teach me to drive, and it means a lot to me, but I've been thinking of the lessons you gave Alex and Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Yeah, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Those were great lessons.
LEADMALE:They could drive through hell if they had to.
LEADMALE:And in a sense, we did.
OTHERMALE:Dad, I want Mom to teach me to drive.
LEADFEMALE: Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, no, that's, uh that's fine, Jen.
SUPMALE:Just, uh, just fine.
LEADMALE:No, your mother will be a a wonderful teacher.
SUPMALE:If you want to learn to drive that way.
LEADMALE:What way is that? 
LEADMALE:Well You know.
LEADMALE:You mean like a woman? Well yeah, you have to admit that you rarely see a-a man, uh, stopped at a light fumbling through his little purse or  brushing his hair in the mirror.
LEADMALE: Uh, putting on eyeliner during a lane change.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, boys.
SUPMALE:Steven, I know I can teach Jen to drive better than you ever could.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really, Elyse? Oh, really, Steven.
LEADMALE:Not if I hide the keys, you can't.
LEADFEMALE:Steven!  This is gonna be hard the learner's permit says there has to be at least one adult in the car.
LEADFEMALE: - Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:You ready to go? Yes, I am, my little psychoanalytical cupcake.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to the movies, Mal.
LEADMALE:You want to come? Oh, you guys, don't leave me now.
SUPMALE:Skippy's on his way over.
SUPFEMALE:He has a new girlfriend; he wants to introduce her to us.
SUPMALE:That's great! When did this happen? How did this happen? I don't know, but this could be just what Skippy needs.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he hasn't dated since Amy transferred to Yale.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't they decide to see other people? Well, yeah, but Skippy didn't know what that meant.
SUPMALE:So, for months, he just walked around looking at other people.
LEADFEMALE:Hi! Hey, Skip, buddy, come on in.
SUPMALE:Uh, I'd like you all to meet someone special.
LEADFEMALE:This is Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, this is Alex, Lauren and Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, how are you? - Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey, why don't we sit down and get better acquainted.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, uh Well -  -  Um, so, have you two known each other long? - Yes.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Um, we just met this morning.
LEADFEMALE:So this is your first date? Oh, no.
SUPMALE:This isn't a date; we're lab partners.
SUPFEMALE:As soon as I met him, he asked me to come home and meet his neighbors, which is weird enough.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, but I said yes because he begged me, and I have real trouble saying no.
SUPMALE:Will you marry me? Not that much trouble.
SUPMALE:Um, look, I hope you won't mind if I see myself out.
SUPFEMALE:I won't.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I-I don't suppose this engagement ring is gonna change your mind? Oh, there must be something we can do.
LEADMALE:I mean, he's such a sweet, lovable guy.
LEADMALE:There's got to be someone out there for him.
LEADMALE:There's not; I looked.
LEADMALE:That little vixen.
OTHERFEMALE:She's playing hard-to-get.
SUPMALE:No, she's not.
LEADMALE:Who am I kidding? She hates me.
SUPMALE:They all hate me.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, come on.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
LEADFEMALE:Then how come last week I asked Lisa Tobin if she wanted to go to the movies with me, and her head spun around a full 360 degrees? Well, she's had the flu, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, look, the odds are always huge against meeting the right person, but somehow it happens.
LEADMALE:Yeah, look.
LEADMALE:Look at Lauren.
LEADMALE:She wanted the best and, you know, darn it, she got it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sure, Alex, you've never had problems with women, but all the women I meet reject me.
LEADFEMALE:Even the women I don't meet reject me.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Skippy, I think maybe I can help you.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come to my lab at school, and I'll assess your psychological profile.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, maybe we can find out what type of female you're compatible with.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care if she's compatible, as long as she's human.
SUPFEMALE:All right, pal, one time around the maze, then lunch.
LEADMALE:Come on, it's easy.
LEADFEMALE:You can do it.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:Just a little further.
LEADMALE:Okay, now find the cheese.
SUPMALE:I don't know where to start.
SUPMALE: Hi, Skippy.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be done in just a second.
LEADFEMALE:We're trying to find the cheese.
LEADFEMALE:It's right here.
SUPFEMALE:Very good.
SUPMALE:Skippy, are you a little nervous? Uh, uh, well, yes, just a little though.
LEADMALE:Um, I'm not too good with these things.
SUPMALE:Uh, when I was a kid, my parents sent me to a psychologist, and then a week later, he was spotted roller-skating naked through a Woolworth's.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Skippy, I don't skate, and I'm sure this is gonna go fine.
SUPMALE:Just relax.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me a little bit about yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I-I think you're asking the wrong guy.
LEADFEMALE:Um See, I-I'm pretty much a mystery to me.
LEADMALE:Okay, then we'll both discover you at the same time.
LEADMALE:So, Skippy, why don't you tell me a little bit about your past relationships with women.
LEADMALE:Okay, um, well, you know about Amy.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:And before that, there was ooh, let's see, uh nobody.
LEADFEMALE:Mm, unless of course you count Mallory.
LEADMALE:What exactly was the nature of your relationship with Mallory? Somewhere in between close personal friend and dog.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I've got to admit, I was a little nervous about doing this, I mean, because we're friends, and sometimes it's hard to work with people you know real well.
LEADMALE:But I have to tell you, I feel very comfortable talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:I-I feel very comfortable talking to you, too.
SUPMALE:I just wish I could be like this around other women.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you're scared of women.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe-maybe you're scared of relationships.
SUPMALE:Does the word "love" scare you? Well, maybe.
LEADFEMALE:I-I guess it depends on how it's used in a sentence.
OTHERMALE:How so? Well, "I love my mother" is fine.
SUPFEMALE:Um, "We'd love to beat you up and take your bike" worries me.
OTHERFEMALE: Okay, let me rephrase the question.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, does the concept of being in love scare you? Not if I could find the right person.
LEADFEMALE:Well, who's the right person? Uh, someone who listens.
OTHERMALE:Someone who cares.
LEADFEMALE:Someone who makes you feel funny, you know? Like, uh, little sparklers are going off in your stomach.
SUPFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm listening.
OTHERMALE:I guess that's it.
LEADFEMALE:What do you look for in a guy? I-I guess it's just the little things that affect me, you know.
LEADMALE:Someone who's not afraid to show affection.
LEADMALE:You know, a gentle pat or a squeeze of the arm.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:That is delightful.
SUPMALE:Well, enough about me.
OTHERMALE:Let's get back to you.
LEADMALE:What do you look for in a woman? Well, I suppose she's pretty.
SUPFEMALE:What does she look like? Well, she's got long, dark brown, lustrous hair; beautiful pale blue eyes; pink, shell-like ears; and-and cute little orange freckles across the bridge of her nose.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:She sounds like a knockout.
OTHERFEMALE:She is.
LEADFEMALE:So, you ladies prepared for your adventure on wheels? Steven, don't start.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to help.
LEADMALE:I happened upon this Ohio driver's handbook, and I thought I might give you a little quiz.
SUPMALE:Dad, I think we'll be fine on our own.
OTHERFEMALE: Come on.
LEADFEMALE:This will be fun.
SUPFEMALE:Here's one.
SUPFEMALE:"When parking on a hill, which way do you turn your wheels?" Oh, well, okay, that's easy.
OTHERMALE:Um, towards the curb if the car is pointing downhill, away from the curb if the car is pointing uphill.
OTHERMALE:Very good, Elyse.
LEADMALE:That's great, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:You really know your stuff.
LEADFEMALE: Yeah, I'll say.
LEADFEMALE:Let's try another one, shall we? "When making a left turn from a two-lane street "onto a three-lane highway, does the car turning left "onto the street or the car turning right onto the highway have the right of way?" Let-let me think just a minute.
SUPMALE:Quickly, Elyse, there's no time.
OTHERFEMALE:Here comes the tractor-trailer.
LEADMALE:But if-if I were actually on the street - Too late, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:Let's, uh, let's try an easy one.
SUPFEMALE:"At what speed do you require a Class 3 license to tow anhydrous ammonia?" That's impossible.
SUPMALE:I don't know that.
LEADMALE:And you call yourself a driver.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you think you could do better? Yes, I do.
LEADMALE:Okay, big boy, you got it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, Mom, please don't leave.
LEADMALE:No, honey, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I-I cannot take the risk of what might happen on some wild night when you and your girlfriends decide to go out and tow ammonia.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Jen, out to the garage for a few words about tire pressure.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, help.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's taking me to the garage.
SUPFEMALE: I really need to talk, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll get out of your way.
LEADMALE:I-I meant to you.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, okay.
SUPMALE:What? Mallory, I'm having uncontrollable romantic feelings.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I knew it.
LEADMALE:Skippy, stop! You've got to stop pining for me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, sure, you're lonely.
SUPMALE:Yes, I'm desirable.
OTHERFEMALE:But it's got to stop.
OTHERMALE:It's not you.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:That was really embarrassing.
OTHERMALE:Well, sure, I-I felt that way about you, once, but now you're more like a sister to me.
SUPFEMALE:Or even a brother.
LEADMALE:No, no, more like a third cousin on my mom's side Uncle Nestor's boy.
OTHERFEMALE:It's all right, Skippy, I'm over it.
LEADMALE:What's up? I think I'm in love with Lauren.
LEADMALE:Well, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren who? Lauren of Alex and Lauren.
SUPFEMALE:That Lauren?! Skippy, you crazy? I know.
LEADMALE:I feel so guilty.
SUPMALE:I feel horrible.
LEADFEMALE:You should.
LEADMALE:How can you do this to Alex? - I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing you can say that I haven't said to myself already.
LEADFEMALE:Have you said this? "I'm a jerk!" I was much tougher on myself.
LEADMALE:It even got physical; twice I had to separate me.
LEADFEMALE:But she's just the only thing on my mind.
LEADMALE:She's the only thing I can think about.
LEADFEMALE:All day and all night, all I say is, "Lauren, Lauren" I-Lord, I'm thirsty.
SUPMALE:Lauren? Skippy, perfect.
SUPFEMALE:You know, we got some great news for you.
OTHERMALE:Tell him, hon.
LEADMALE:All right, I hope you don't mind, but I matched up your profile with some other women I know at school, - and I got you a date.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Alex and I are gonna double with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't this exciting? Skippy! - Hi, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry we're late.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'm in charge of the introductions.
LEADMALE:Alex, this is Pippi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Pippi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Pippi, this is Skippy.
SUPFEMALE:My folks love Pippi Longstocking, so Oh, my folks love peanut butter, so Well, Pippi and Skippy.
OTHERMALE:Well, you two ever get married, your kids could be, uh, Flippy, Snippy and Dippy.
SUPFEMALE: You look beautiful, Lauren.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think Pippi looks terrific? Pippi who? 
LEADMALE:Pippi Longstocking.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, that Pippi! Of course, yes.
LEADFEMALE:You look very nice, very peppy, Pippi.
LEADMALE:Uh, bread, anybody? - Sure, I Hey, now, don't hog it.
LEADMALE:Lauren? No, thank you.
LEADMALE:No? - No.
OTHERFEMALE:Are we ready to hear the specials? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, will you wait just a minute, please? Lauren, are you ready to hear the specials? I think so.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:I-I don't think I'm ready yet.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm ready.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight I have a lovely veal scallopini, a delightful little chicken in a mustard sauce, and, of course, a number of selections from our brand-new fresh seafood cart.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:We have lobster, crab, roughy and scrod on ice, and you can select the exact one that you'd like.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, I'll have the lobster.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I'll have the lobster, too.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, I'm sorry; we only have one lobster left.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you go ahead, Pippi.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's all right, Lauren.
LEADMALE:Uh, Lauren, you get the lobster.
LEADMALE:Pippi, you get the scrod.
SUPMALE:Oh! Come on! - Skippy! Alex? Flip me a flounder, Skip! - I've got to go.
LEADMALE:Oh, you can't go.
SUPMALE:It's flying fish night at Guido's.
OTHERMALE:That's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I've lost my appetite.
SUPMALE:Alex, would you drive her? - Yeah, absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:I feel kind of responsible.
LEADMALE:I was the designated driver anyway.
OTHERMALE:It's funny, I thought I'd be driving someone home 'cause they drank like a fish, not got hit by one.
LEADFEMALE:All right, honey, save me that lobster, all right? -  - See you in a while.
SUPMALE:I had a very nice time, Pippi.
SUPFEMALE:I hope we can do this again.
LEADMALE:I'll bring my snorkel.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I don't want you to blame yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything was going fine until you started throwing fish.
LEADMALE:It's all my fault.
OTHERMALE:I'm a stupid, clumsy oaf! You're also sweet, sensitive and caring.
LEADFEMALE:I know what your problem is.
LEADFEMALE:You just tend to get overly excited around women.
LEADFEMALE:Your senses overload.
OTHERFEMALE:That only happens around certain women.
LEADMALE:Well, then maybe Pippi's still a good bet.
LEADFEMALE:Pippi wasn't the only woman here tonight, Lauren.
LEADFEMALE:That's very sweet, Skippy, but what I meant was that - Not that! - I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't help myself.
SUPFEMALE:Sure felt like you helped yourself.
SUPFEMALE: I'd better go.
LEADMALE: The Keaton driving school is now in session.
SUPMALE:So are some therapy groups I'd like you to visit.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, would you mind if we didn't go out in the car for the first time at night? I mean, it's gonna be hard enough in the daytime.
LEADMALE:Well, who said anything about a car? We are going to simulate a driving lesson right here in the kitchen.
OTHERMALE:Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
SUPFEMALE:Two more chairs, and we have a backseat.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do this; I get carsick.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, everybody in the car.
LEADFEMALE:  Don't slam the door.
OTHERMALE: Everybody buckled up? Okay, here.
SUPFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Start the car.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Now pull carefully into the street, checking both ways for traffic.
SUPMALE:Stop! -  - What?! You almost hit that bicycle.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer! If you can't drive more carefully, I'm gonna have to get out! Drop me off at the mall! Okay Please, everybody, everybody calm down.
SUPMALE:We're in traffic now.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, watch the road.
LEADMALE:Take a left at the light.
LEADMALE:Where's the light? What light? It's right there! You just ran a red light, young lady.
LEADMALE: Oh, uh-oh, there's a cop behind us.
LEADMALE:Where? Right there.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna try to lose him.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, no! Floor it, Jen! - Jen! - Hold on! Jen  Jen Oh, no, the drawbridge is up! - I can't look! -   Give me those keys.
LEADMALE: I've had it.
LEADMALE:You teach her.
SUPFEMALE:She's too much of a daredevil for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I quit.
LEADMALE:You can't take the heat, get off the highway.
SUPMALE:This is all my fault.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I did his profile; I should've seen this coming.
SUPFEMALE:What-what-what? What happened? Aw, Skippy flipped out at the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:He tossed a scrod and kissed Lauren on the mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good thing it wasn't the other way around.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's Skippy.
LEADMALE:Do you mind if I talk to him alone? He'd be crushed if he thought you knew.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's all right.
LEADMALE:Hello, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Lauren.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you came over.
SUPFEMALE:I-I think we should talk.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I think so, too.
LEADMALE:And, uh, since I have to catch a plane for the Arctic Circle, I'll go first.
LEADFEMALE:I just want you to know that wasn't me who kissed you in that restaurant tonight.
SUPMALE:That was my evil twin, Bad Irwin.
OTHERFEMALE:Skippy, I think we should talk about what happened at the restaurant tonight.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I-I really am.
LEADMALE:It's just that, uh well, you were so close, and, um I started to have these feelings.
SUPMALE:What feelings? That I loved you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Skippy, you don't really love me.
LEADMALE:You just have this need to be loved by someone, and you transferred that need to me.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with me? I make a complete fool out of myself every time a girl is nice to me.
LEADMALE:Fortunately, it doesn't happen that often.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, when we were alone at the lab, you were charming and relaxed and funny, and I liked you.
SUPFEMALE:And someone else will, too.
SUPMALE:If you can be that way around me, you can be that way around anyone.
LEADMALE:Do you think so? All you got to do is be yourself.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I'll give it one more year, but then I'm gonna be someone else.
LEADMALE:Well, now there's just one more thing I have to do, which is, um talk to Alex.
OTHERMALE:Alex? Yes? I think I'll leave you two guys alone.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Alex, there's something I have to tell you.
LEADMALE:I, uh, fell in love with Lauren.
SUPMALE:But, uh, we talked it over, and I'm getting over it, and this will in no way affect you two or your happiness.
OTHERMALE:You fell in love with Lauren? Whoa.
LEADMALE:Whoa, Skippy, this is, uh this is a shocker.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh I'm not sure exactly what to say.
LEADFEMALE: I mean, it's a pretty painful It's a pretty painful thing to spring on a fella.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm just gonna need some time to absorb it and get over it.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm over it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Skip, hey, don't worry, 'cause somewhere out there is a wonderful girl for you.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone keeps telling me this! Where the hell is she? Hi Oh, no!
SUPFEMALE:
