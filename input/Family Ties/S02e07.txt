LEADMALE:You know, you knew he was a barbarian.
SUPFEMALE:You knew his friends were barbarians.
LEADMALE:And you knew he wasn't gonna walk into a dark restaurant and order fish.
LEADMALE:Alex, Swedish films are meant to be symbolic.
LEADFEMALE:When the priest ordered fish, it meant that he still had faith, that his life still had meaning.
LEADMALE:You see, the sea is the origin of life.
SUPMALE:I'm not that good at symbolic thought.
OTHERMALE:You know, I need facts.
LEADMALE:I need figures.
LEADFEMALE:I need to see the bottom line.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex, there's more to life than just the bottom line.
SUPFEMALE:There's beauty for its own sake.

LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Remember that play we saw That guy in tights? I-I learned a lot from him.
LEADMALE:Well, for one thing, I learned never to wear tights.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, put up? Lorraine I've I've had a great time the past two weeks.
LEADFEMALE:I have, too, Alex.

LEADMALE:Steven, this has definitely gone too far! They've had Chinese food together! We didn't have Chinese food together till we'd been married for two years! Let's just be thankful they haven't had Moroccan food together.
SUPMALE:Remember what happened the first time we had that? Hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:It's got to stop, mom.
LEADFEMALE:All we did was ask him how his old lady was.
SUPMALE:Girls, we'd like to talk to Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea let's get this thing out in the open.
SUPMALE:Alone? Well, we've never been so insulted in our lives.
LEADMALE:But hey.

LEADFEMALE:Turn of the century.
LEADMALE:There's something I must ask.
LEADFEMALE:I think I know what it is.
LEADMALE:Elyse, nobody is more surprised about Alex and me than I am.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm not too sure about that.
SUPFEMALE:My husband is gone, and Alex has turned out to be a great companion for me.
OTHERMALE:He's brought a certain joie de vivre that I don't think I've ever felt before.

LEADMALE:You must know how I feel.
LEADMALE:Let me assure you that I have no designs upon Alex beyond friendship.

LEADMALE:Well, I-I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:It's nothing personal.
LEADMALE:He's letting his schoolwork slide.
LEADMALE:He doesn't see any of his old friends.
LEADFEMALE:We feel he should spend more time with someone his own age.
OTHERMALE:Well, you are his parents.
LEADMALE:And if you don't want me to see him, I will abide by your wishes.
LEADMALE:T-that doesn't mean you have to leave.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid it does.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:Steven, did we do the right thing? We had to do something.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Lorraine? She's gone.
LEADFEMALE:What do you What do you mean, she's gone? We told her how we felt.

SUPMALE:You had no right to treat her that way! Alex, we apologize.
SUPMALE:I'm very sorry.

LEADMALE:Uh, you you mean I-i should date girls my own age? Yes, amongst other things.
LEADMALE:I just don't want you to stop leading the life of a 17-year-old.
SUPFEMALE:I've never led the life of a 17-year-old.
LEADMALE:Give it a try.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:everything that's beautiful everything that's good and true
