SUPFEMALE:Jennifer? Jen, you're not gonna believe this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so excited.
LEADFEMALE:I was up in the attic, and I found this shoe box.
LEADMALE:Congratulations, Mal.
LEADMALE:It's a real nice one.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:It's full of Mom and Dad's old love letters.
SUPFEMALE:What's a love letter? It's a really mushy letter you send someone to tell them how much you love them.
SUPMALE:I want to write one to Rachel Feltman.
LEADMALE:I love her.
LEADFEMALE:Who's she? She's a girl in my class.
LEADFEMALE:She's only five, but I don't care I like 'em young.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, listen, listen, listen.
LEADFEMALE:"My dearest, sweetest lambikens "you were so beautiful last night "when we took over the administration building.
LEADFEMALE:"Your lustrous skin was made even more luminous - Oh.
SUPMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:By the rosy" Oh! - Nothing! Um, it's n - Yeah, nothing, Mom.
LEADMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing, lambikens.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, listen Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Lauren's car just pulled up, and I want to talk to you guys about something before she comes in.
LEADMALE:Wow, I haven't seen Lauren around here lately.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, see, that's what I want to talk to you about.
LEADMALE:She's been having a lot of trouble with her senior thesis, and-and she's feeling kind of down about it.
LEADFEMALE:So whatever you do, don't mention the word "psychology" or "thesis.
LEADMALE:" - Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Lauren.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Lauren! How's that senior psychology thesis? Dad, Dad Alex asked us not to mention anything about her senior thesis.
SUPMALE:Why can't we say anything about your senior thesis? Because she's having trouble with it.
LEADMALE:Well, trouble with what? Her senior thesis! I want to thank you all very much.
SUPFEMALE:You pulled that off beautifully.
LEADMALE:I appreciate your concern, but actually, this thesis thing, it's no big deal.
LEADMALE:Really? I hear you're having trouble with it.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, come on.
SUPMALE:Let's not think about that nasty thesis, okay? Bad thesis! Let's let's talk about us, okay? How long it's been since we've seen each other, what a great time we're gonna have tonight, nice movie, fancy dinner I'll even lend you the money.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, Lauren, if you don't like your topic, I've got one for you.
LEADMALE:A friend of mine last year at Grant did her psychology thesis on "Intimacy Problems Between Capricorns and Pisces During the Holidays.
LEADFEMALE:" She got an "A.
LEADFEMALE:" I don't know if I can change my topic now.
LEADFEMALE:I've been researching this one for over two years.
LEADMALE:Well, how much have you written so far? A page and a half.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:If you've written that much, you can't turn back now.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, surprise.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex, I'm so glad you're here! Mm! - Whoa.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Oh! I'm sorry I had to cancel - that date last night.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's all right, that's okay I went to the movies with Skippy.
SUPMALE:You know Fatal Attraction with Skippy takes on a whole new meaning.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm! - I probably should have gone.
SUPFEMALE:As it is, I got nothing done.
LEADMALE:Ah, really? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I look at these mice, running like crazy on that wheel and getting nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:I think, how different am I from a mouse? You don't sit in your food.
SUPMALE:I had a meeting with Professor Lombard this morning.
LEADFEMALE:I showed her what I had on my thesis so far, - and she was disappointed.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:"This thesis will explore the following areas of behavior.
OTHERFEMALE:"One spend more time with Alex.
LEADMALE:"Two go out more with Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Three talk more with Alex.
SUPMALE:" Honey, this is brilliant.
SUPFEMALE:That's not it.
SUPFEMALE:That's the chapter I'm writing now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm thinking of calling it "Things I Can Do With Alex If I Quit My Thesis.
LEADMALE:" That's a snappy title.
LEADMALE:You're not really thinking of quitting your thesis, are you? What would be so wrong with that? I-I could go back to my old life, a life that I liked very much.
LEADFEMALE:I could spend more time with you.
LEADFEMALE:I could care for you and-and nurture you and watch over you.
LEADFEMALE:I could devote myself to you, and make sure that you're as happy and as contented as a human being could possibly be.
SUPMALE:If that would make you happy.
SUPMALE:It would.
LEADMALE:I really want to quit.
LEADFEMALE:D-Don't you think it's a good idea? I can't say.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, that's your decision.
LEADMALE:All right, then fine I'm quitting! Oh, Alex, I-I feel like an enormous weight's been lifted from me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm free! Does that mean you can go out with me tonight? Are you kidding? We're gonna celebrate.
SUPFEMALE:Mm! Come on.
LEADMALE:Mm! I quit! Do you hear that, Sigmund? I quit! Now I'm gonna devote all my time and energy to making you happy.
LEADFEMALE:Mm! Glad I stopped by.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what are you two doing? We're writing another love letter to Rachel Feltman.
LEADFEMALE:Another one? What'd she think of the first one? She hit me.
LEADMALE:It's a start.
LEADFEMALE:The letter made Margie Phillips cry.
LEADMALE:Why? Because Margie loves me, but I don't love Margie.
LEADMALE:I love Rachel.
LEADMALE:Rachel loves Clint Eastwood.
OTHERMALE:She claims they've dated.
LEADMALE:Well, Andy, maybe I can help you win the heart of your fair Rachel.
LEADFEMALE:You probably don't know this, but in my day I was quite the love letter writer myself.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that true my lovely my golden-haired, gossamer angel? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Write this down! It's working! My sweet each breath seems a lifetime when I'm away from you.
LEADFEMALE:I'd walk miles across desert sands for one glimpse - of your rare beauty.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, we were just, uh - Mom, hey, no need to explain, okay? I understand.
LEADMALE:It's tough to keep the excitement alive.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, now, Alex, I've seen you and Lauren get pretty mushy together.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, it's different, Mom we're young.
SUPFEMALE:Mush looks good on us.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you've enjoyed being together - with Lauren again, though, haven't you? - I can't lie to you, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Lauren quitting this thesis is the best thing that ever happened to me.
LEADFEMALE:Better than Nixon's pardon? That was more emotional, of course.
SUPFEMALE:But this is beyond my wildest dreams.
LEADMALE:And-and Lauren is doing all this great stuff for me.
SUPMALE:She even baked me a cake and decorated it.
LEADMALE:It was a scale model of the floor of the stock exchange.
LEADFEMALE:Done entirely in frosting.
LEADMALE:Tiny edible dollars.
SUPFEMALE:Little angry traders.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, as long as she's using her time wisely.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
OTHERFEMALE:Do I detect a note of condescension in your voice? Ooh.
LEADMALE:Certainly not.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mom, when I met Lauren, I was willing to put up with the professional career woman syndrome.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you suffer from that yourself, don't you, Mom? Yes, and I'm getting help.
LEADFEMALE:I lucked out, that's all.
SUPMALE:I mean, you know, Lauren decided she doesn't want a career, so I get the best of both worlds I get a smart girl who doesn't show it.
OTHERFEMALE:Face powder directly on the lips? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Then apply the lipstick, okay? And blot it a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:Then put your lip gloss on, and you're practically smudge-proof.
OTHERMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Alex, you wouldn't believe the things Mallory knows.
LEADMALE:No argument there.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mom, come on up I want to show you these new red sneakers I just bought.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you just bought some red sneakers last week.
LEADMALE:No, these are high-tops; they're for evening.
SUPMALE:So, did you have a good day today, honey? Oh, yeah, not bad, not bad.
SUPMALE:I finally finished that economics paper.
LEADMALE:Um what'd you do? Oh, not much.
LEADMALE:I rested.
LEADFEMALE:Saw a really good Wheel of Fortune on TV.
OTHERFEMALE:Great, great.
SUPFEMALE:So, oh, did you interview for that teaching job you were talking about? Well, not really.
OTHERMALE:There were about a hundred other people applying I can't compete with that.
LEADMALE:Why not? Because I don't want to.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, I've been thinking, if the purpose in life is to be happy, why should I do anything that doesn't make me happy? Right, right.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I can't argue with that.
SUPMALE:I want to learn gourmet cooking.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to learn bonsai gardening.
LEADMALE:I want to learn pebble art.
LEADMALE:Aha! But you're not ruling out this teaching job entirely, are you? It won't make me happy.
LEADMALE:I'm happy doing this.
SUPMALE:And if I need money, I'll just go on Wheel of Fortune.
LEADMALE:Aha.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, if I get a job, I may not be here for you when you need me.
LEADMALE:Don't you understand? I want to spend every second with you starting now.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:This is working out fine.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, will you check this letter for spelling? Yeah.
SUPMALE:"Dear Rachel, you have nice logs.
OTHERMALE:" I meant legs.
SUPMALE:Well, you should change that.
SUPFEMALE:No, she has nice logs, too.
LEADMALE:Sounds like the basis of a good relationship.
LEADMALE:Come on, Andy, let's go deliver your letter to Rachel.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, thanks for letting me go through your recipe file.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, well, since you're making this big dinner for Alex, I thought it might help if you knew some of his favorite dishes.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight I'm making Nancy Reagan's Hearty Beef Stew, for conservative cowboys and ravenous Republicans.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
OTHERMALE:Lauren, I am really impressed.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I could never make a beef stew.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't know the first thing to go into it.
LEADMALE:Well, beef.
SUPMALE:Oh, right! I'm so excited.
SUPFEMALE:I-I just love to cook, but I haven't had time until now.
LEADMALE:So you're really glad you dropped your thesis, right? Oh, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:What a relief! You know, all that time I spent studying, I felt like I was banging my head against the wall.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you do that, too? It just wasn't right for me.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes people make the wrong choices.
LEADMALE:Like in the Days of Our Children.
LEADFEMALE:Do you watch? Oh, the soap opera.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:It's like how Zander keeps trying to please Reef, but she'd be better off with Skyler.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think she should be with Brick.
SUPFEMALE:No, he's got a new girlfriend Cashmere.
SUPMALE:Oh, I love her! Well, I'd better get the groceries for tonight.
OTHERMALE:Tell Alex I'll see him at dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, and I'll see you Friday for that makeover lesson.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:-Oh, Alex, you can go grocery shopping with me.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, listen, I'm-I'm getting a little tired of grocery shopping.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:It's fun.
SUPFEMALE:You like it when I wheel you around in that cart.
SUPMALE:You know, Alex, you really should go.
SUPFEMALE:Nick and I always have a lot of fun grocery shopping.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we well, we go up to the deli counter, and we each take a number, and we run! Well can you imagine the looks on their faces when they call our numbers, and we're not there?! You two have such a full life.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Alex, let's do that.
SUPFEMALE:Honey! I'm, uh I'm not in the mood for deli pranks.
SUPMALE:Okay, if you don't want to go, but I'm gonna miss you every minute.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe what's happening.
LEADFEMALE:I now have a woman who runs errands for me and-and cooks for me and takes care of me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's everything I ever wanted, and I and I can't stand it.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think there's something wrong with me? Um generally speaking? Mallory tell me something.
SUPFEMALE:Do you notice anything different about Lauren? Well, she's definitely dressing better.
LEADFEMALE:And she seems to know a lot more.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, about important things.
LEADMALE:So you two are having a lot of fun together? Oh, I've never gotten along with her better.
LEADFEMALE:We're like one and the same now.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I was afraid of.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, this is your night, so I just want you to sit down and relax.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and I have the evening edition of the paper for you to read while I'm busy with dinner.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Uh, honey? Honey? Honey, um, I would really rather just chat.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not just dinner, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm also doing some laundry for you, arranging some flowers and putting the final touches on dessert.
LEADMALE:What is this, the Betty Crockerathon? Lauren, sit down, talk to me.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want to talk about? How about, uh how about those election primaries, huh? Oh, Alex, I don't read the paper anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:There's so much sad news in it.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to be happy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, honey, it's important to keep up with what's going on in the world.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, for example for For example, uh do you see about this development in-in the Persian Gulf? Yes, I did, and I'm really mad about it.
SUPMALE:You are? Fabulous.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:What are you mad about? Um, U.
LEADFEMALE:S.
OTHERMALE:Involvement? Iranian aggression? What? Tell me.
LEADMALE:Tell me.
LEADMALE:I'm mad that that stupid news report broke in the middle of Days of Our Children.
LEADFEMALE:Right there when Zander was about to tell Reef that Brick and Cashmere were trying to frame Skyler for Nicole's murder.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex, what's wrong? Honey, don't-don't you miss your old life? Your thesis, the lab, the work? The-the-the the feeling that you got when you learned something new, something real? Look, I thought you wanted me to drop my thesis.
SUPFEMALE:I I know.
LEADFEMALE:I did.
SUPFEMALE:I Maybe I was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:You have so much to offer.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you should be doing more than watching soap operas and clipping recipes.
LEADFEMALE:But they're good recipes, Alex.
LEADMALE:Lauren, look at yourself.
LEADMALE:You are frittering your life away on these things.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you get tired of doing the same thing day after day and not accomplishing anything? Don't you appreciate all that I've done? The errand running? The cooking? - It's all for you.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Is-is it so bad that I want to spend my time with you and make you happy? What about you? What about making yourself happy? I mean you're using me as an excuse.
SUPMALE:I am not.
OTHERFEMALE:Admit it! You spend all your time watching TV! Playing along with Wheel of Fortune! All right, may-maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:Maybe I have been watching too much TV.
LEADFEMALE:I'll stop and I'll spend more time with you, okay? Okay, look, just stop trying to please me by satisfying my every whim! I can't believe I just said that.
OTHERMALE:Alex, this isn't that big of a problem.
LEADMALE:It is.
LEADFEMALE:It is.
LEADMALE:You don't see it.
LEADMALE:Lauren, you're hiding.
LEADFEMALE:You're hiding from the real world.
LEADFEMALE:You quit more than your thesis, Lauren.
LEADMALE:You quit life.
LEADMALE:I love you, but not like this, not the way you are right now.
SUPMALE:Lauren? Lauren? Leave me alone.
LEADMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hi, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:So, Mom tells me you're writing a new love letter to Rachel.
OTHERFEMALE:How did that go? She pushed me into a hedge.
SUPFEMALE:She's quite a charmer.
OTHERFEMALE:But Margie Phillips was there, and she helped me up.
LEADMALE:Ah, that's good.
OTHERFEMALE:She loves me.
LEADMALE:Now I love Margie, not Rachel.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, so let me guess.
SUPMALE:So now you're writing a love letter to Margie.
SUPMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Could you help me? Absolutely.
OTHERMALE:Absolutely.
LEADMALE:What have you got so far? "Dear Margie.
LEADFEMALE:" That's good.
SUPFEMALE:That's good.
OTHERMALE:That's good.
SUPMALE:I mean, it's a start.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't want to come on too strong.
OTHERFEMALE:But there's a lot more to say, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Like, um "Thanks for helping me out of the hedge.
LEADMALE:" And, also, "My dear Margie, "I'm sorry that I didn't pay more attention to you.
LEADFEMALE:"Sorry for a lot of things.
LEADMALE:"When you ran out of the room tonight, I my heart sank.
SUPMALE:"I love you.
SUPMALE:I want to be with you.
LEADFEMALE:But your thesis is important.
SUPFEMALE:" Yeah, that's good.
SUPMALE:Margie will like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, any word from Lauren? Uh no.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't think I'll be hearing from Lauren too soon.
LEADMALE:Well, honey, I know it was tough, but but what you did tonight you know, trying to wake Lauren up was a was a very brave and selfless thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it was a very feminist thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, kick me while I'm down.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you actually learned something from this.
LEADMALE:What, Mom? What did I learn? That maybe you don't want to settle for a-a an empty-headed, ditsy little cream puff who's at your beck and call.
OTHERMALE:Maybe just on weekends? No, Alex.
LEADMALE:You know, I-I Under this buttoned-up, macho exterior, you don't really believe that.
SUPMALE:You're not going to be happy unless you're with a woman who is who is strong and vibrant.
LEADFEMALE:Someone who's an equal partner, someone you can talk to.
LEADMALE:You're right, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:And I blame you.
OTHERFEMALE:Then my work here is done.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I forgot to put the fabric softener in the laundry.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to have some wicked static cling in your socks.
LEADFEMALE:Alex what you said tonight cut awfully deep.
LEADMALE:It really hurt.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't easy to say.
LEADMALE:But I had to because I care about you, and I couldn't stand to see what was happening with you.
LEADFEMALE:Alex I feel like I'm alone out here on this one.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm the first woman in my family ever to go to college.
SUPFEMALE:Be a lot easier if I just had a role model.
LEADMALE:Sometimes I-I feel like I'm flapping my wings furiously, not knowing if I'm doing it right, because no one ever taught me how to fly.
OTHERMALE:Role models are important.
LEADMALE:I know, when I'm in a situation, I always think, "I wonder what my parents would do?" Then I do the opposite.
SUPMALE:Alex, it's different with you.
LEADMALE:You've always been confident.
LEADMALE:I remember our first date.
LEADMALE:You looked at me tenderly and said, "Do you know what's great about me?" You talked for six hours non-stop.
SUPMALE:You didn't even notice me leave.
SUPFEMALE:Then you still don't know what's great about me.
SUPMALE:I know what's great about you.
SUPFEMALE:You're smart, you're understanding.
SUPMALE:Ruggedly handsome.
OTHERFEMALE:It's funny.
SUPFEMALE:When-when I was little, I always pictured my future as living in a nice house and a garden and a couple of kids.
LEADFEMALE:And even though I knew I wanted a career, it was really never a part of my life vision.
LEADMALE:When I was a little kid, I always wanted to be supreme ruler of the universe.
SUPMALE:Alex, that's still your dream, isn't it? Yeah, but it doesn't seem like enough now.
SUPMALE:You know what my problem is? I've got a father complex.
LEADFEMALE:I-I was always daddy's little girl, and he always overprotected me.
OTHERMALE:And now, I'm trying to continue that personality dynamic with you.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, but did I just hear you say something psychoanalytical? I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:It just kind of came out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's great! Oh, it's great.
SUPMALE:Alex, I know I have to continue on with my thesis, but what I'm scared.
LEADFEMALE:What if I fail? Hey, hey, you got to take that risk.
SUPFEMALE:Will you help me? No.
LEADMALE:But but I'll be there to support you.
LEADMALE:I get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, this doesn't mean that you still can't dote on me, you know?
OTHERMALE:
