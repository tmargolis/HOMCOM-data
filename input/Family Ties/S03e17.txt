LEADMALE:Where's Dad? He's upstairs fixing the plumbing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
SUPMALE:The last time Dad tried to fix the plumbing, we had to shower at the Y.
SUPFEMALE:I- I hope he gets down here soon.
LEADMALE:I have to talk to him about pledge week.
LEADMALE:Oh, you know, he is so excited.
LEADFEMALE:He looks forward to this every year.
SUPFEMALE:He sees that working together down at the station is one of the few family things we still do together.
LEADMALE:What do you want to talk to him about? I don't want to do it anymore.
LEADMALE:Alex.
SUPMALE:I mean, we do it every year, and it's so boring.
OTHERFEMALE:Stuffing envelopes, answering phone calls, running all those errands.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey, Mallory, let's not forget end of the 
LEADMALE:family portrait time.
LEADMALE:Oh, yuck.
LEADFEMALE:We're not gonna have to do that again, are we? We stand in front of the camera, little frozen smiles on our faces.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Alex Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:And he's our dad.
LEADMALE:And we're happy to be part of WKS family.
LEADFEMALE:## WKS, you're the one ## I- I don't believe you kids.
OTHERMALE:Now, that is one of the nicest parts of the program.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mom, it's not fair, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he always assumes we're gonna do it every year, and never asks if we want to.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mom, we've cooperated with him on this thing for ten years.
LEADFEMALE:All we want is a year off.
SUPFEMALE:I'm with them, Mom.
LEADMALE:Would you talk to Dad for us? No, I won't.
LEADFEMALE:I think your attitudes are terrible.
LEADMALE:And if you don't want to do it, then you have to tell him.
SUPMALE:## WKS, you're the one ## Hey! Good morning, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Heh-hey.
LEADMALE:Well, today's the big day.
LEADFEMALE:Pledge week begins.
LEADFEMALE:Could it have been just a year ago that we had one? It's not possible.
LEADMALE:To me, of course, the most thrilling part of pledge week is that final day, when we have family-portrait time.
SUPMALE:There I'll be surrounded by the ones I love, heh, all there to support me in front of thousands of people.
LEADMALE:Oh, it sends a chill up my neck just thinking about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Say, Dad? Yeah, Alex.
LEADMALE:Uh a- about pledge week.
LEADFEMALE:You're excited, huh? Oh, excited doesn't cover it, Dad.
LEADMALE:Uh, listen, we We were thinking that Well, that is Um Mallory has something she wants to talk to you about.
LEADFEMALE:Um, yeah, Dad.
LEADMALE:See I- I don't think I can express it as well as Jennifer did earlier.
LEADMALE:Jennifer? Uh what time do you want us at the station? Four-thirty.
LEADFEMALE:See you then.

LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Honey, I just don't know how it looks when the boss' wife is the soloist.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:And the kids probably feel a little funny about your doing it.
LEADMALE:Don't lay it on us, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Mom, I can't think of anything a teenaged girl would like more than for her mother to sing in public.
OTHERMALE:Well, if your father thinks I shouldn't do it, well then I won't do it.
SUPMALE:Elyse, I wouldloveto have to you sing.
LEADMALE:Do you mean that? Do I mean it? Heh.

LEADFEMALE:No, Dad, look.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to those pipes.
LEADMALE:That's their way of saying, "Call a plumber, call a plumber.
SUPMALE:" You really think I need a plumber? Dad, it's the plumber.
SUPMALE:It's ringing.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:It goes against my principles of self-reliance, but obviously, you all want me to hire a plumber, and this is pledge week.
LEADMALE:This week we're pulling together as a family, right? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, Gus, have you seen my kids? They should be here by now.
LEADFEMALE:No, I haven't seen 'em.

LEADMALE:They feel comfortable with him.
OTHERFEMALE:They know all his jokes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, at least Jackie Jackerman's a professional.
LEADMALE:You know? You know, some of those other PBS stations, all they do is put on friends and relatives.
OTHERFEMALE:That's That's true.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, Elyse.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here, Elyse? You gonna help us answer the phones? I've come to rehearse my number.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.

OTHERMALE:I'll be very professional, Steven.
OTHERMALE:## Hmmm ## Oh, oh, Steven, I forgot to say, I got in touch with that plumber, and he's coming to the house later today.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
OTHERMALE:That's a nice intro.
SUPFEMALE:## Believe me ## ## If all those Endearing young charms ## ## That I gaze on So fondly today ## ## Were to fade by tomorrow ## ## And fleet in my arms ## Okay, that's great.
SUPFEMALE:That is great.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's just beautiful, Elyse.

LEADFEMALE:I'll work on that note, Steven.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:Everything is going to be fine.
LEADFEMALE:You're here, I'm here.
OTHERMALE:The kids are here, working hard.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Ha, ha, okay.
SUPMALE:Well, I feel terrible, Judy.
LEADMALE:Lost all your money on the first hand.
LEADFEMALE:But, uh, that's all right, you can forget about that IOU.
LEADMALE:That's a nice watch, Judy.
SUPFEMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand it, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:The kids used to love pledge week so much.
LEADMALE:Today they were bored out of their minds.
OTHERMALE:Why would you say that? They were busy working on the phones.
SUPMALE:They were calling each other.
LEADFEMALE:Look, they really don't want to participate in pledge week, do they? I wouldn't say that.
SUPMALE:You know, Steven maybe it's not a question of whether they want to participate or not.
SUPMALE:May Oh, never mind.
OTHERMALE:No, no, w-what is it? No, I shouldn't say anything, in case I'm wrong.
LEADFEMALE:You're not wrong.
OTHERMALE:How do you know? You're never wrong about this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if I am wrong, it's better left unsaid.
LEADFEMALE:But if you're right, I'll never know if you don't tell me.
OTHERMALE:That's true.
LEADMALE:So tell me.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'm wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Now Now, this is just my opinion, but maybe the kids simply resent the fact that you never ask them if they wanted to help during pledge week.
SUPMALE:You just assumed.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure if you presented them with a choice, that they would say yes.
SUPMALE:Elyse, you're right.
LEADMALE:I was unfair.
OTHERMALE:Oh, this is great.
LEADMALE:It is? Of course.
SUPMALE:Now I know what the problem was.
OTHERMALE:I was insensitive, I was a fool.
LEADMALE:I was a jerk.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Bud.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Haven't seen you folks for a while.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh, I've been, uh, doing a lot of the plumbing repairs myself, Bud.
LEADFEMALE:Great! Maybe I'll get that new van I've been looking for.
LEADMALE:Uh, listen, Bud, you're not gonna charge extra because it's nighttime, are you? Well, let me put it to you this way.
SUPFEMALE:The time it took you to ask me that question just cost you $8.
LEADMALE:40.

SUPMALE:Oh, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:My little helper.
SUPFEMALE:How have you been? Great.
LEADFEMALE:My, how you've grown.
LEADFEMALE:How's business? Jennifer, try to keep the chatting down to a minimum.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not a wealthy man.
SUPMALE:Uh.
SUPMALE:Bud, uh, the problem is in the upstairs bathroom.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Oh, kids.
SUPMALE:Uh, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I made a mistake the other night, and I want to apologize for it.
LEADMALE:I was wrong to just assume you wanted to participate in pledge week.
SUPFEMALE:You have your own lives.
SUPMALE:Just because something's important to me doesn't mean it has to be important to you.
SUPFEMALE:So let me say right now, if you want to participate, that is great.
OTHERFEMALE:But if you don't, that's fine too.
LEADFEMALE:So what do you say? Uh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Dad you're unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I mean, that is very sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what other father would approach it that way? Probably lots of fathers.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, come on, Dad, I'm not so sure now.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Francine Wilcox wanted me to study with her this Saturday, and, uh, now I can.

LEADFEMALE:" I have to get something out of the truck, but I think I'm zeroing in on our problem upstairs.
LEADMALE:Bud, you keep saying that.
OTHERFEMALE:Every day you fix something, the next day you're back.
SUPMALE:Why, you getting tired of seeing me? I'm tired of paying to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.

SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Alex.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I had a feeling you'd come around.
SUPFEMALE:After all, if something is important to one member of the family, it should be important to all of us.
OTHERMALE:Absolutely.
SUPMALE:Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, that's why we wanted to give you that.

LEADMALE:Now, that's sweet.
SUPMALE:Those kids must really love their dad.
SUPFEMALE:I sure loved my dad.
LEADMALE:Beautiful man.
SUPFEMALE:I sure miss him.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, my dad was a plumber.
LEADMALE:Taught me all I know.
LEADFEMALE:I used to go watch my dad work when I was so small I could hardly carry a plunger.
LEADFEMALE:If it wasn't for my dad, I don't know who I'd be today.
LEADFEMALE:But that's what dads are for.
LEADMALE:So tell me how come you kids aren't down there? Uh We're kind of busy, Bud.
SUPFEMALE:But I've worked in all kinds of places.
LEADFEMALE:I worked in one club that was so tough, they had a sign that said, "Thank you for spitting.
LEADFEMALE:" Is this thing on? Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Testing, one, two, three.
LEADFEMALE:Testing.
LEADFEMALE:Woo.
OTHERMALE:Bad news, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:We've only got about $10,000 in pledges.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, that's down $40,000 from last year.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand it.
SUPFEMALE:Why aren't people giving this year? But you know, eh-heh, PBS is very educational.
LEADMALE:In fact, from watching it, I learned how to spell PBS.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe he's almost finished.
LEADMALE:And if I was anywhere else in the world, people would try to stop me from talking.
LEADMALE:Of course, they do that here too.
LEADMALE:Huh.
LEADFEMALE:God bless you all.
LEADMALE:I love you.
SUPFEMALE:Stay real.
OTHERMALE:Good night.

LEADFEMALE:Elyse? Thank you, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, I'm Elyse Keaton.
SUPMALE:I- I'd like to reassure the audience that the fact that I'm married to this man here has nothing to do with the fact that I'm singing later on.
OTHERMALE:I I'd like to reassure them, but, uh it's not true.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Elyse these times when we meet the WKS families are always my favorite moments.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, uh, my kids can't be here tonight, but just a few hours ago, before we left the house, those beautiful kids gave me this.
OTHERFEMALE:Paul, can you zoom in on this? It says "good luck.
LEADFEMALE:" And then on the inside they wrote, "Have a great time!" Can you believe that? "Jennifer," she's my youngest.
SUPFEMALE:"Mallory," she's my 16-year-old.
LEADMALE:And "APK," that stands for Alex P.
OTHERMALE:Keaton, my son.
OTHERMALE:Well, uh I don't have to tell you how proud I am of this card.

SUPMALE:We'll clap really loud, no matter how bad you sing.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on here? Oh, not much.

SUPMALE:That magician you had was great.
SUPMALE:Bud, I'm not here to talk about magicians! I'm here to talk about the plumbing.
LEADMALE:What's going on in this house? Does that give you a clue? Ceiling's falling apart.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:That ceiling has to be opened up.
SUPFEMALE:The pressure's gonna keep on building, and the whole ceiling's gonna fall down.
SUPMALE:Bud, you have already bled me dry.
SUPMALE:I'm not paying you one more cent.
LEADFEMALE:So how much is it if you work overtime? Well, until midnight it's double.
LEADFEMALE:After that, it's triple.
SUPMALE:Triple! Now, Mr.
