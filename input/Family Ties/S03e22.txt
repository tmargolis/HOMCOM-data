SUPFEMALE:So catch me when I got a spare decade.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I wish we could just go straight to Grandma's.

SUPFEMALE:I don't think so, Jen.
LEADMALE:But they said we're just gonna stay for a few minutes.
SUPMALE:I am as anxious as you are to get to Grandma's.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I-I love that woman.
LEADMALE:We got a very special relationship.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't wait to go to her house.
LEADMALE:That's only because Lisa Tobin lives next door to Grandma.

LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Mom, we better get going, huh? I don't want to disappoint Lisa Grandma.
LEADMALE:Can't we just go straight to Grandma's? Do we have to go to this reunion? We don't have to go, we want to.

SUPMALE:We went through natural childbirth classes with them.
SUPMALE:Your father and I are really looking forward to it.

OTHERMALE:Thanks, Mal.
LEADMALE:I knew you'd come around.

LEADFEMALE:Do you happen to have any explosives on you? I can't believe that we're locked in the basement.
LEADFEMALE:We could run out of air.

LEADMALE:Think of this as a dungeon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay, I feel better now.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I have been sent by the noble house of Handleman to rescue you.
LEADFEMALE:See, you're the beautiful damsel in distress.
LEADFEMALE:And I am a knight.

SUPMALE:Fuse? Do you know anything about fuses? Are you kidding? Mallory, they don't call me Handy Handleman for nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, stand back.
LEADMALE:Let's see here.

LEADFEMALE:and put it into here.
LEADMALE:That's very nice.

LEADMALE:There.
SUPMALE:Can you get out, Skippy? No, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:There's no way I can fit through the bars.
LEADMALE:Maybe if I buttered myself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Oh, great! Now the window's stuck open.
LEADMALE:We're gonna freeze to death! What are we doing? Jumping jacks.
LEADMALE:Oh, good idea.

LEADMALE:Oh, great, Skippy.
LEADMALE:Nice going.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't thank me.

LEADFEMALE:It's too bad the babies are still asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder if Larry Jr.
SUPFEMALE:is asleep.
LEADFEMALE:He looks so cute when he's sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, Suzie? Well, you know, it It is great getting together like this.
OTHERFEMALE:I I was just, uh, saying to Elyse on the drive over here that we really don't know each other that well.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean that she and I don't know each other that well.
LEADFEMALE:I I, uh, meant all of us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:That's true, you know, during the Lamaze classes, we didn't have much of a chance to socialize, but But now we can just sit back and relax and talk.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Hey, and talk about something other than babies.
OTHERFEMALE:What a relief.
OTHERMALE:Finally.
LEADMALE:So, what'd you guys think of that election? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy, we're pretty upset, let me tell you.
SUPFEMALE:Who wants another four years with that guy? We think he's doing a fine job.
SUPMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:I, uh Well, I don't follow politics.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Then why did you bring it up, Larry? Oh, I was just trying to make conversation.
LEADMALE:I mean, let's face it, this party's dying.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure this goes on this way? I'm positive.
SUPFEMALE:Well I certainly am warm now, huh? We're lucky that your parents like to get dressed up like chipmunks.
LEADMALE:Skippy, I told you it was for a Halloween party.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a good thing they didn't go as nudists.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe this.
SUPMALE:I don't mind freezing to death half as much as the thought of being found looking like this.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm looking for something to eat.
LEADFEMALE:I have a sudden craving for chestnuts.
LEADMALE:"My Summer Vacation by Alex P.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, "age 6.
LEADFEMALE:"This summer, I went to the zoo.
LEADMALE:"It only cost 50 cents because I am a minor.
SUPMALE:"It cost my parents $1 because they are majors.
SUPFEMALE:"One day, I'd like to run the zoo and charge $2 to get in with no discounts for anybody.
LEADMALE:" Maybe we could warm up by setting this on fire.
SUPMALE:Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:That Alex! I Ouch! Ah! What is it? It's my ankle again.
LEADMALE:It really hurts.
SUPMALE:Mallory, I think I'm gonna need an ankle transplant.
SUPMALE:Why don't you sit down or something.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I, uh, didn't know you were so highly-trained for medical emergencies.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you put some ice on it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Um which paw is it? This one.
SUPMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:How's that? Much better.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mallory, you'd make a good veterinarian.
LEADFEMALE:Fat chance of me ever being anything important.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not exactly dressed for success.
SUPMALE:What's that? I- I found it in Alex's trunk.
SUPFEMALE:It's a picture of your 7th birthday party.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Here, take a look at this.
SUPMALE:There's your parents, and there's Alex, and there's Jennifer, and there's me.
LEADMALE:Where am I? You're the one in the corner sticking your tongue out at me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I remember that party.
SUPMALE:You had to leave early 'cause you swallowed a party favor.
LEADMALE:Oh, we've had a lot of good times, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, a lot of water under the bridge.
LEADMALE:I- I know what you mean.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I guess we all consider you kind of an honorary Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:You mean it? Yeah, I'm used to you, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Even though you're very annoying, when you're not around, I kind of miss you.
OTHERFEMALE:You do? I didn't know that.
SUPFEMALE:I- I I always feel like an outsider, wherever I am.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't know what I'm talking about, would you? Well, don't be so sure.
LEADFEMALE:See, sometimes I don't feel like I belong anywhere.
LEADMALE:You know, Alex is real smart, and Jennifer is great at sports.
LEADFEMALE:Andrew's cute, and I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm nothing special.
LEADMALE:I'm I'm just me.
LEADMALE:Mallory, you got to be kidding.
LEADMALE:I mean, you are the most special person in the whole world.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Skippy.
OTHERFEMALE:You're kind of special in your own way.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, because of this kiss, I shall never wash my face again.
LEADMALE:Then you'll never be kissed again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Steven, come on.
LEADFEMALE:They're down here in the basement.
LEADFEMALE:Let's try to imagine what series of events led to this point.
OTHERMALE:I'd rather not, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank God you're home! Honey.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? W Oh, we came down here to get Alex's trunk, and Skippy shut the door and locked us in.
SUPMALE:And then the heater broke, we almost froze to death.
LEADMALE:Aren't you gonna ask us how our day was? Skippy, wake up.
LEADMALE:Oh Oh, you should have let me sleep.
SUPFEMALE:I was having the nicest dream.
SUPFEMALE:I dreamt that I was in this big barrel of macadamia nuts.
SUPFEMALE:Let Let me a-ask you kids something.
LEADFEMALE:Were you in chipmunk costumes when you came down here, or No, no, Dad, we found them down here.
SUPFEMALE:We put them on to keep warm.
SUPMALE:We almost froze to death.
LEADMALE:Mallory, you'll do anything to get out of writing a paper.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! You shut the door! Yeah, why? Well, that's how we got stuck in here.
LEADMALE:It locks automatically.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no, it doesn't.
OTHERMALE:All you do is this, and you're out.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Before hunting season starts.

OTHERFEMALE:I'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know.

SUPFEMALE:Well, it wasn't so bad.
SUPFEMALE:
