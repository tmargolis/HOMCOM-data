SUPFEMALE:Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:You use that phone as long as you want.
OTHERFEMALE:You got 30 seconds, Keaton.
LEADMALE:Hey, morning, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Guess you didn't get much sleep, huh? Thought I heard Andrew cryin' all night.
LEADMALE:Alex, I slept fine from 3 to 3:15.
LEADMALE:Otherwise, I'd be grumpy.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm sorry for having worn your shirt and in order to make it up to you I'm gonna wash it, okay? No, no! Mallory, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, look, you don't even know how to use the washing machine.
LEADMALE:I do so.
SUPMALE:Look, "Before using this machine, "make sure it's been grounded to avoid possible electric shock.
LEADMALE:" Show me how to do that, Alex.
LEADMALE:Don't tempt me, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you goin', Mom? Well, Andrew hasn't been outside for a week because of his cold, so I thought I'd take him on a walk before dark.
LEADMALE:But it's 8 in the morning.
SUPMALE:Well, then I have no problem.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I want to ask Adam to the dance, Chrissie, but what if he says no? Well, then what if he says yes? All right, Jennifer, your time's up.
LEADFEMALE:You get off the phone now, or I'll call Adam and tell him you like him.
SUPMALE:I'll call you right back, okay, Chrissie? That was a dirty trick, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Say, Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Dad? Have you seen your mother? Yeah, she just left.
LEADFEMALE:Left? What do you mean, left? Well, she went to take Andrew for a walk.
LEADMALE:If you hurry, you can catch 'em.
LEADMALE:Well, I can certainly catch him.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Where's the baby? Oh, I put him down for a nap.
LEADMALE:I thought you went out for a walk.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Andrew and I got as far as the front sidewalk and decided we weren't alert enough to be out on the streets.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but Dad just went out to find you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he'll be back.
LEADMALE:Uh look after Andrew for me, will you, honey? Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see her out there anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:She just came back.
LEADFEMALE:She went upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, tell your dad that I've gone up to go to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:He just went upstairs to look for you.
SUPFEMALE:I'll meet him up there, then.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse! I'm getting too old to play these games, Elyse.
LEADMALE:I guess I was just in a playful mood.
OTHERMALE:Surprise.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm off till 3:00.
LEADMALE:Today? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I thought we could spend a few hours getting reacquainted.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, yeah, as long as you don't mind getting reacquainted in front of Paul and Barbara Esposito.
LEADMALE:Well, that'll be fine.
LEADMALE:Who are they? Well, I-I'm designing a guesthouse for them.
LEADMALE:I promised I'd bring by their plans this afternoon.
LEADMALE:Well How about now? We could just sit around and talk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sweetheart, I have got to go back to sleep.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll come with you.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you'll talk in your sleep.
LEADFEMALE:How about tonight? I'm not doing anything.
LEADMALE:We could get together and go over old times.
SUPMALE:I can't think of any flaws in that plan.
SUPMALE:I'll see you tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:So I guess I'll just, uh, call Gus, tell him I'll be comin' in.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Good luck gettin' Jennifer off the pho Whoa! Oh.

LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:So how was your day? Well, let's see.
LEADMALE:First, the Espositos decided they don't want a guesthouse, they want a greenhouse.
OTHERMALE:Seems they have more plants than friends.
OTHERMALE:Then Then I came home, and Alex and Mallory were still arguing about some shirt, and And Jennifer was on this six-hour phone-athon with Chrissie.
SUPFEMALE:I think the high point of my day was when Andrew spit up on me.
LEADMALE:Well, at least we're alone now.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, it's just so nice to have a quiet moment with you.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, yes, she is.

OTHERMALE:I just have to find that out.
LEADMALE:Is there some reason why you can't find that out downstairs? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Chrissie, call me right back, okay? I'm getting a lot of static on this end.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.

LEADFEMALE:Look, why don't you check on? No! No, I do not want a free dance lesson, and I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't interrupt my dinner in the future.
LEADMALE:I tried to be a nice guy by answering a pay phone, and look what happens.
LEADMALE:Why did you hang up? I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Did you want a free dance lesson? Well, how was Andrew? He's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, I think I figured out what went wrong tonight.
LEADMALE:Oh? Well, you see, it's very simple, really.
OTHERMALE:See, we each have careers which take up a lot of our time and energy, and we have three children who are very wonderful, but, uh, who are also very loud and demanding.
SUPFEMALE:And on top of that, we have a baby who is, uh, very beautiful, but also very loud and demanding and who occupies every last moment of our remaining time and energy.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight we tried to escape all that.
LEADFEMALE:And? It's impossible.
SUPFEMALE:That's encouraging.
SUPMALE:But it's true, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Uh, we can, uh, remove ourselves physically from all this, but, uh But not emotionally.
LEADFEMALE:This is our life.
SUPFEMALE:We're trapped in it.
OTHERMALE:You make it sound like a science-fiction film.
LEADFEMALE:It's not such a bad life, is it? No, it's not.
SUPFEMALE:It's a great life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:I-I think we just have to accept the fact that our life has changed, that we're parents.
OTHERMALE:We have fo Four children, and we enjoy it.
SUPFEMALE:And we're not gonna have any fun till Andrew goes to college.
LEADFEMALE:I accept that.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I just wanted to apologize for talking on the phone so much lately.
SUPMALE:It's okay, honey.
OTHERMALE:For some reason, I find myself talking about boys a lot more than I used to.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I find myself talking to boys a lot more than I used to.
LEADMALE:We've noticed.
SUPMALE:I'm sure it's just a phase.
SUPFEMALE:It'll pass.
SUPMALE:I'm not getting that.
LEADMALE:Uh, if it's for me, tell whoever it is that I'll see him at school tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Well, no.
LEADMALE:No, I'm sorry, Adam Dad, no! Hi, uh, Adam? Uh, can I call you right back? Okay.
SUPMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:This is the last phone call I will ever make in my whole life.
LEADMALE:Please? Thanks.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:How you doin'? Oh, not bad.
LEADMALE:Not bad.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we know you guys haven't been able to spend a lot of time together and that we're probably part of the reason why not.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:So, uh, we just wanted to say we're sorry, and, you know, all that stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Apology accepted, and all that stuff.
SUPFEMALE:And if Andrew cries tonight, we'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:If, uh If Andrew cries tonight, Mallory will take care of it.
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:It's too quiet, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Let's enjoy this.
OTHERMALE:This is what we wanted, isn't it? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want to do? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What do you want to do? Well, I have a vague recollection of you and me being in bed together.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, that.
SUPFEMALE:I think I remember.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we're falling asleep, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:We're definitely falling asleep.
LEADFEMALE:I knew there had to be a catch.
LEADMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:I love you too, honey.
LEADFEMALE:
