LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
SUPMALE:What you doing? Oh, I'm working, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Making notes on my new documentary.
LEADFEMALE:The Industrialization of 
SUPFEMALE:From Nacho Chip to Microchip.
LEADMALE:I wrote that line.
LEADMALE:It's a killer, Dad.
LEADMALE:Well, this  Oh, Steven, are you working again, on a Saturday? Honey, I'm just doing a little extra PBS work.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't be working on a weekend.
LEADMALE:Yeah, even during the week it's debatable.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, you know the doctor said that since your heart attack, you should de-stress your life and try to relax.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you need a hobby.
LEADMALE:I hate hobbies.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Hobbies are terrific, huh? I got a million of 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you find time to fit them into your busy schedule? Okay, I'll be in the kitchen, so please let me know when my friend gets here.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:What friend is this? Oh, just someone I know from school.
LEADFEMALE:He I mean, he-slash-she is gonna help me bake some stuff for my French Club bake sale.
LEADMALE:Wait, he "he-slash-she"? Yes.
SUPMALE:This person is a friend, and I don't see how gender enters into it.
SUPFEMALE:Mal, how do I look? Is this a good color for me? Yes, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna knock his-slash-her eyes out.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, is this one of them half-men, half-women guys you see Jennifer, is this, uh is this friend a boyfriend? Well, maybe.
LEADMALE:I don't want to discuss my personal life, though.
LEADFEMALE:He is so sweet, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:He's shy, he walks me to all my classes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really not sure if he likes me, but he's been hanging around my locker a lot this past week.
SUPMALE:Well, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:When he's, uh, talking to you, does he lean against the locker with one hand? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jennifer, then you're practically engaged! I'm so happy for you!  Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, he's shy, he walks, he can lean on one hand.
LEADMALE:That's one way to choose a mate.
LEADMALE:It's better than you did.
LEADFEMALE:Better than you did, too.
OTHERFEMALE:You might know who he is.
OTHERFEMALE:His name is Josh Wakefield.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, Josh Wake Josh Wakefield? Jeff Wakefield's little brother? Or little brother-slash-sister? Great.
SUPMALE:Jeff Wakefield.
OTHERMALE:Who is Jeff Wakefield? Well, it's a boy that, uh, Mallory used to go out with when she was in high school.
LEADMALE:Nick, he's the guy who broke my heart.
LEADFEMALE:He went away to college and asked me to go steady.
LEADFEMALE:Then when I went to visit him, I walked into his dorm and found him kissing another girl.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I was devastated.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I was a complete mess until I met you.
LEADMALE:You're wonderful, Nick.
LEADMALE:But Jeff Wakefield's a complete jerk.
LEADMALE:He's also a good friend of mine.
LEADMALE:Well, they're not mutually exclusive.
SUPFEMALE:I'm beginning to like this Jeff guy.
SUPMALE:What? Oh, you see, if he'd never broke up with you, you and I never would've gotten together.
LEADMALE: Damn that Jeff.
OTHERMALE:Oh, honey, he-he was a nice, shy boy.
LEADMALE:Remember, he'd come to the house, he couldn't even bring himself - to knock on the door? -  Mom, that's not because he was shy.
LEADFEMALE:He was standing out there thinking of ways to dump me.
LEADFEMALE:No, I-I thought he was nice.
LEADMALE:He'd come in and call you "pal.
LEADFEMALE:" Remember that goofy, high-pitched laugh he had whenever he got nervous? The deranged little cackle?  He sounded like Flipper.
LEADMALE:Boy, it's getting late.
LEADMALE:I hope Josh didn't get lost.
OTHERMALE:Josh! Hi.
SUPMALE:Come on in.
SUPMALE:Hey, pal.
SUPMALE:Josh, these are my parents.
LEADFEMALE:All of them?   He doesn't sound like Flipper.
LEADMALE:He sounds like Shamu.
SUPMALE:Well, Josh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:We better get baking.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Jeff? Okay, this last batch should be done pretty soon.
LEADFEMALE:Now all we have to do is glaze the cinnamon rolls.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jennifer, you got a little flour on your nose.
OTHERMALE:Oh, gosh.
LEADFEMALE:Is it gone? No, it's on the side Here, let me, uh Oh.
LEADMALE: Smudged it, uh - Here.
LEADMALE:Ow! Oh, God! I'm such a jerk, I I poked you in the eye, I Yes, you did, but it was the nicest poke in the eye I've ever received.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, can I talk to you about something? I think you went a little overboard powdering your nose.
SUPFEMALE:You don't think it's a good look for me? Oh, God, no.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna freshen up.
LEADFEMALE:Can you stir that for me until I get back? Oh, hey, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Spoke to my brother Jeff the other day.
LEADFEMALE:He said to say hi.
LEADMALE: As if I care.
SUPMALE:Huh? Uh I said, "Oh, have you been to the World's Fair?" Gee, Mal, I could've sworn you said, "As if I" Ow! So, how is Jeff doing? Well, let's see, uh After Jeff graduated summa cum laude in French from Princeton, he landed a job over in Paris.
LEADMALE:Vice president of a big French manufacturing company.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess Jeff's so busy, he doesn't have time for a social life.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he doesn't really go out much.
LEADMALE:Not since he got married.
LEADFEMALE:And Gigi kind of likes to relax when she gets home.
LEADMALE:You know, she says it's really tiring being an astrophysicist.
LEADMALE:Oh, she says that, huh? In French.
LEADMALE:She sounds charming.
LEADFEMALE:Charmant.
LEADMALE:I always knew Jeff would wind up with a bookish little girl.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually, uh, Gigi's quite tall.
SUPFEMALE:She-she used to be a model.
LEADFEMALE: Well, she couldn't make it as a model, she had to go and become an astrophysicist.
SUPMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:So, how about you, Josh? How you doing? Well, uh, I got into Princeton.
LEADMALE:Early admission, just like Jeff.
LEADMALE:And I'm gonna major in French, too.
LEADMALE:Like Jeff.
SUPMALE: Just like Jeff, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I plan to follow in his footsteps.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff's kind of my my hero.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'm back.
LEADMALE:How do I look? - Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:How's that glaze coming? Great.
LEADMALE:Well, it looks like it's done.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Josh, we better get to the bake sale.
LEADMALE:Oh, we got to hurry, because I told Rebecca Philips I was gonna give her a ride, too.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay, great.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:See you guys later.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think of that, Alex? He's taking Rebecca Philips to the bake sale, too.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:We better call the bakery cops and bust his crullers.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Dad.
SUPMALE:Okay, Steven, you can start relaxing right now, because we have the hobby of your dreams.
SUPFEMALE:You remember your favorite childhood toy? We got it for you.
LEADFEMALE:Train set.
LEADMALE:Oh, Elyse, a train set.
OTHERMALE:That's a great idea! Boy, I used to love those freight trains.
SUPMALE:Climbing rugged mountains, crossing raging rivers, all of them pulled by that mighty locomotive.
LEADMALE:Doesn't look very mighty, does it? Yeah, all right, it's mighty tiny.
OTHERFEMALE:But it comes with great accessories for the village, Dad.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:A miniature Young Republicans headquarters with cute little miniature Young Republicans running hither and thither.
LEADFEMALE:They're not hithering and thithering in my village.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Dad.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Look-look at the box.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:Where's Jennifer? Uh, still at the bake sale with Josh.
SUPMALE:Still? Oh, Mom, when I have kids, the rule is gonna be three, at the most four, hours at a bake sale.
OTHERFEMALE:Anything over that, they're grounded.
LEADMALE:What has gotten into you? Oh, I don't know, Mom.
LEADMALE:Look, the truth is, I don't trust Josh.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you say that? Mom, I care about Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Josh worships Jeff.
SUPFEMALE:Josh is gonna do everything Jeff did.
LEADFEMALE:And in my judgment, Josh will jilt Jennifer just as Jeff jilted me.
LEADFEMALE:Gee judging by Jeff, Jen and Josh are really jinxed.
OTHERMALE:Jell-O? No, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, history doesn't really have to repeat itself.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Josh and Jen are unique individuals in a unique relationship, which, as far as I can tell, revolves solely around baked goods.
SUPMALE: Elyse, Alex isn't playing trains fair.
LEADMALE:Do I have to separate you two again? Mallory? Huh? Guess what happened.
SUPMALE:Josh asked me to the senior prom.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't that incredibly romantic? I don't know, Jen.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? This morning, you were so happy for me.
LEADFEMALE:That was before I knew who he was.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, I have to tell 
LEADFEMALE:I don't like Josh.
SUPMALE:How can you say that? You don't even know him.
LEADMALE:I know his type.
SUPMALE:Oh, I get it.
SUPMALE:You just don't like him because he's Jeff's brother.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:See, Jeff led me on and dumped me, and Josh is gonna do the same thing to you.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:Why-why are you trying to ruin this for me? Jennifer, I'm telling you this for your own good.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm your big sister; I think you ought to listen to me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I thought you were more than my big sister, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:I really thought you were my friend.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, excuse me.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, hey-hey-hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Girls, how we doing, huh? Jennifer, I'm only trying to look out for you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe I don't want you to look out for me.
OTHERMALE:Who wants ice cream? Jennifer, I think I know a little bit more about the world than you do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the world of culottes, maybe.
LEADFEMALE:Frozen yogurt, Tofutti? I'm flexible here, huh? I can't believe you made a crack like that, Jennifer! Mallory, just because Jeff dumped you Whoa, whoa, whoa, girls, girls, girls, girls! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Jennifer, he is going What the hell is going on here? Mallory doesn't like Josh, and she's not even giving him a chance.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, I don't think you're thinking clearly.
LEADMALE:Mallory, I can't believe that you would make that statement.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Jeff did it, Josh - Josh worships Jeff.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, girls, girls! Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Mallory, Jennifer you're my sisters.
LEADMALE:I love you both very much.
OTHERMALE:And it pains my heart to see you fight.
LEADFEMALE:And snap at each other.
LEADMALE:So, please do it another room, all right? Thanks, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, all right, I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:I'll mediate your dispute.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God.
LEADMALE:Please, don't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, it will be just like when you were little and you'd have arguments and I'd settle them fair and square.
LEADMALE:No, you wouldn't; you always sided with Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE: - Well, I won't this time, okay? Listen, I'll listen to each of your complaints, I'll think about it, and I'll come up with a solution that will satisfy both of you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Now, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I think if I want to go out with Josh, it is my business, and Mallory should butt out.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:I just think Jennifer should go a little slow with Josh.
SUPMALE: Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Slow with him.
LEADFEMALE:Butt out.
LEADFEMALE:Mm uh Jennifer's right.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's not fair! Yes, it is, Mallory! Mallory, if you would take the time to get to know Josh, you wouldn't be saying these things about him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey, that gives me an idea, huh? Why don't you and me and Josh and Jennifer all go out for dinner, huh? That way, you can get to know him.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a great idea, Nick.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you say, Mal? What if after we go out I still don't like him? Well, I don't know, you know, I only get one idea at a time.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, Josh, you're fluent in French, huh? Say something.
SUPMALE:Nick, you're kind of putting him on the spot.
OTHERMALE:Aw, come on, just tell me a word, you know? Like, for instance, what's the French word for, uh, I don't know, say, um croissant? Croissant.
LEADFEMALE: Oh! Hey, so French and English are the same, huh? Basically.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, what else is going on with your life, huh? Well, we've talked enough about me.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, you haven't said much.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm just listening.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Josh got accepted early admission to Princeton.
SUPMALE:Well, hey, early admissions to Princeton, huh, Josh? You must be pretty excited or as they say in French, "Pretty excited.
SUPFEMALE:" Yeah, my brother Jeff went there, loved it.
SUPFEMALE:Says you can meet all sorts of interesting people.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Yeah, college can open up a lot of doors.
LEADMALE:Both academically and socially.
SUPFEMALE:Do tell.
SUPMALE:Maybe we ought to talk about what Nick's doing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what am I doing? Or as the French say, "What am I doing?" Shush up, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Um, Josh, which door do you think you'd be more interested in, the social one or the academic one? Ah, I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff says studying's pretty important, but, uh, I mean, you need a good social life, too, right? Well, he certainly had one.
LEADMALE:So, uh, you two is going to the prom, huh? That's great.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it, Nick? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, I never went to a prom.
LEADFEMALE:How come? Oh, I was never in school when the year ended, so Um, Josh getting back to your social life what exactly do you think you'll be doing? Well, I I guess in the fall, I'd go to football games.
OTHERFEMALE:Alone, or with someone? Mallory, what does that matter? Oh, hush.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just curious.
LEADMALE:Josh?  Well, with someone, I guess.
LEADMALE:Hoping to make friends pretty fast.
SUPMALE:What kind of friends? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What kind are there? Well, there are the kind you hang out with, and there are the kind you kiss on the lips.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory! - Jennifer! Who here can roll their tongue? Listen, Josh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I just think Jennifer has a right to know where this relationship is going.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, stop it! Just leave him alone.
LEADFEMALE:Look I don't know what's going on here, but I really don't think this evening was a good idea.
LEADMALE:I better go.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, Josh, wait.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I am sorry, I got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer - Well, so long.
LEADFEMALE:Or as they say in French Oh, Nick! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right? Yes.
LEADMALE: 
LEADMALE:Okay, we did it.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay, what's, uh, what's next? Uh glue, glue, glue, glue.
LEADFEMALE:One drop in each of its slots.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, yes, each of the slots.
SUPMALE:All right? - Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Here we go.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do it, Alex.
OTHERMALE:I haven't got the hands anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I  -You can do it, Dad, you can do it.
LEADFEMALE:You're a champ.
SUPMALE:You're a winner.
LEADMALE:Okay, you're right.
LEADMALE:You're a model-building machine.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! - Okay, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Go for it, Dad.
SUPMALE:Tab 82 in slot A.
SUPMALE:It's done.
SUPMALE:It's All right, okay, okay, take a break, take a break.
OTHERMALE: Dad, little bit more?  Okay.
SUPMALE:Tab 83.
SUPFEMALE:It's done.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! One more! - Yes! - One more, Dad.
LEADMALE:One more.
OTHERMALE:God, thank you, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:One more.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, buddy.
LEADMALE:Come on, buddy.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Come on, buddy.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Done! We did it! - Oh! - We did it.
SUPMALE:We did it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex, I love it.
OTHERFEMALE:We've done it.
SUPMALE:We've done it.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:We built our very own Republican Savings and Loan.
LEADMALE:Alex, this is an authentic replica of a Wild West saloon.
SUPMALE:No, it's not, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Dad, look, look, look.
SUPFEMALE:If it's a Wild West saloon, what are all those cute little bankers doing in there? Those aren't bankers.
LEADMALE:Those are drunken cowboys.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
OTHERMALE:They're bankers.
LEADFEMALE:Look, look.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, no, don't tell me.
SUPMALE:Dad, n-no, I just - No.
LEADFEMALE:Al - Oh, oh! - Oh, oh, oh! Now look what you've done.
SUPMALE:How's your hobby coming, honey? Oh, it's tremendously relaxing, Elyse! The trains are so small, you can barely see them.
SUPFEMALE:Alex has turned the village into a bastion of Republican banking.
LEADMALE:You can hardly put-put the buildings together, and when you can, you you glue yourself to them.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to make a presentation at work tomorrow, and now I have to explain why I've got a saloon stuck to my hand.
LEADMALE:It's a Republican Savings and Loan, Dad! 
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE: -Hi.
SUPMALE:Where's Jennifer? Oh, she ran out of the restaurant after Josh.
LEADMALE:Oh, dear.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry to hear that.
SUPMALE:Why? Oh, I started asking him all these questions, Mom, to find out if he was really like Jeff, and I went a little too far.
OTHERMALE:I alienated Josh, I mortified Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I made a complete fool out of myself.
LEADMALE:Nick have a good time? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:He learned French.
LEADMALE:Honey, look, even if Jen is making a mistake, there is nothing you can do about it.
LEADFEMALE:It-lt's the only way she's gonna grow up.
SUPFEMALE:In other words, butt out.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be upstairs.
LEADMALE:How did things go with Josh? Fine, fine.
SUPMALE:He's a really sweet guy, so he didn't hold anything against me.
LEADMALE:You're another matter, however.
LEADFEMALE:He must hate me.
SUPFEMALE:No, I talked him down.
SUPFEMALE:I told him that you're getting over a vicious bout of scurvy.
SUPFEMALE:Then you must hate me.
LEADMALE:It's tempting.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm really, really sorry.
OTHERMALE:Mallory, you had no right to do what you did.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm old enough to handle these things by myself.
OTHERMALE:I-I know that in my head, but in my heart, you're still my little baby sister.
SUPFEMALE:You know, before you were born, I used to dream about what it would be like to have a little sister.
SUPFEMALE:And then, when you came along, I was so happy.
SUPFEMALE:Glad I could help.
LEADFEMALE:I used to sneak into your nursery and-and sit there and-and look at you through the bars of the crib, and I'd talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember what I said? Not offhand.
LEADMALE:I promised that I would be the best big sister in the world, and that I would protect you and care for you and teach you.
SUPFEMALE:You've done that; you've always been there for me when I needed you.
SUPMALE: Oh, sure, when you were a toddler, I'd tell you how to sit up, patty cake and catalog shop.
LEADFEMALE:But then, when you got older, you went in a different direction.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, books and school and intellectual discussions things I don't know anything bout.
LEADFEMALE:And I realized that you're not like me at all.
LEADFEMALE:You're like Alex.
LEADFEMALE:That's an awful thing to say.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Forgive me.
OTHERFEMALE:What I mean is that Alex took over and-and kind of became the one who gave you advice and-and that you looked up to.
LEADMALE:Look, Mal, I know we don't have loads of stuff in common, but you're still my big sister.
SUPMALE:Your opinion means a lot to me.
OTHERFEMALE:If it didn't, I wouldn't have cared what you thought of Josh.
OTHERMALE:Jen, that means a lot to me.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I'm sorry I didn't give Josh a chance.
LEADMALE:Well, do you ever think you'll change your mind about him? Why don't we all go out after my scurvy clears up, and I'm sure I'll like him.
LEADMALE:You're on, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:And Mal? Yeah? I still love you, big sister.
SUPFEMALE: Jen, I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Or as the French say, "I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:
