LEADMALE:Yo, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Look alive.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven.
LEADMALE:And they say that pregnant women can't catch.
LEADMALE:That's an old wives' tale.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Do you realize that this is the actual football I used 13 years ago to teach Alex how to throw? I thought that was in the hall of fame? Nope, hall closet.
OTHERMALE:This is gonna be a great weekend for all of us, Elyse.
LEADMALE:You and the girls up in the country, Alex and I here alone.
LEADFEMALE:Really looking forward to it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me too.
LEADFEMALE:This is a very pivotal weekend in my relationship with the girls.
SUPFEMALE:After the baby's born, I'm not gonna have many opportunities to spend time with them alone, you know, real quality time.
LEADMALE:Oh, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Mm? I made a surprise for the girls.
OTHERMALE:It's a complete photo history of our lives together as mother and daughters.
LEADMALE:"Keaton 
LEADMALE:Oh, How We've Grown.
SUPFEMALE:" I didn't know we were supposed to make things.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I've gone all out.
LEADMALE:I- I have a complete list of activities, Each item is specifically selected to spark memories and generate closeness.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh.
SUPMALE:What have you got besides the football? Do you have any extra pictures? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's okay.
SUPMALE:I'm sure Alex will be happy enough just to see his old ball.
SUPFEMALE:That's all you've got, huh? Jennifer's got some clay.
SUPMALE:Maybe I could build a scale model Oh, that's okay, Steven.
LEADMALE:I'm sure he'll be happy with his football.
SUPFEMALE:I- I don't know if we're doing the right thing, not telling the kids what the weekend is about.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sure we are.
SUPMALE:Don't wanna put any pressure on 'em.
LEADMALE:Let 'em think that our only motive is to have a good time.
OTHERFEMALE:That could work.
OTHERMALE:Well, anyway, I'm not gonna show the football to Alex now.
SUPFEMALE:You know how he doesn't like to get too emotional in front of women.
SUPFEMALE:I'll hide it.
LEADMALE:Give it to him at just the right moment when we're alone.
LEADFEMALE:Good idea.
LEADFEMALE:What you cooking, Dad? Uh, soufflÃ©.
SUPMALE:Okay, Mom, car's all packed.
SUPMALE:Let's hit the road.

LEADMALE:What are you worried about? We got the house to ourselves.
LEADMALE:Just the guys.
LEADMALE:Let me see that arm.
LEADMALE:Good toss, son.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, sorry, Dad.

LEADMALE:I should have dove for it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, uh, that's not just any ball, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I know, Dad.
OTHERMALE:It's a ball with glass on it.
LEADFEMALE:That is the Bart Starr autographed model we used to toss around in Lincoln Park when you were a kid.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember? Not really, Dad, no.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, don't you remember? I taught you to throw with this ball.

LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well Well, this is it.
SUPFEMALE:This is it? This is it.

LEADFEMALE:This is rap with an R.
LEADFEMALE:Um, it's It's a term we used in the '60s.

SUPMALE:I'm afraid I might throw up.
SUPMALE:Thanks for sharing that with us, Jen.
OTHERFEMALE:She asked for my feelings.
SUPMALE:That's not what she meant.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to be so gross.
SUPMALE:Girls.
LEADMALE:Girls.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe this isn't the right time for a rap session.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe Maybe we can ease into that one later.
LEADFEMALE:Um Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've got an idea.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna save this for tomorrow, but we're in the mood now, so why not? Heh.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:You brought a photo album with you? Oh, this is not just any photo album.
SUPFEMALE:This is an album that I made up of our history together as mother and daughters.
LEADMALE:Keaton 
LEADMALE:Oh, How We've Grown.
LEADFEMALE:These are old pictures, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I know they're old pictures.
LEADMALE:That's the point.

LEADMALE:It's It's just us.
LEADMALE:But we've seen these pictures before, haven't we? No, not like this.
SUPFEMALE:Not all together.
LEADFEMALE:See? Not Not in this format.
SUPMALE:They're still the same old pictures.
SUPMALE:They are not the same old pictures.
SUPMALE:When you put 'em all together in one book, they take on a totally different meaning.
LEADFEMALE:Now, they show the joy and the closeness that we've shared down through the years.
LEADMALE:Now, sit down and share the joy.
LEADFEMALE:Say, I I got it.
LEADMALE:How about a game of chess, huh? Yeah, okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Dad, uh, if you really want to.

SUPMALE:Play chess.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we're, uh We're in the middle of a game here, you know? It wouldn't be right for me to just pick up and leave in the middle of a game.

LEADMALE:Today we were, uh Huh? Huh? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Heh-heh.
SUPFEMALE:But you're eating alone? No, not at all.
LEADMALE:I- in fact, Alex is on his way home from the market right now with his own frozen dinner.
LEADMALE:We're having a race.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:All right, we're not having a race.
LEADFEMALE:Alex hasn't been here all day.
SUPMALE:He went over to Susie Farkas' house.
LEADMALE:The girls aren't out making copies.
LEADMALE:They're at the movies.
OTHERMALE:We came home early 'cause they were bored out of their minds.
OTHERMALE:I guess this didn't turn out the way we planned, huh? I tried, Steven.
SUPMALE:I really tried.
LEADMALE:I mean, I-I steered the conversation towards all the old things we used to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:I had the photo album, but they weren't interested.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, we shouldn't feel too bad about this.
LEADFEMALE:It was bound to happen.
OTHERFEMALE:The kids are older now.
LEADMALE:Their lives are expanding to include more and more things all the time.
OTHERMALE:Well, I say we put a stop to it.
LEADMALE:Elyse.
LEADMALE:Well, the depressing thing is it doesn't look like it's gonna get any better.
SUPMALE:Aren't you forgetting something, Elyse? We're gonna have a baby in the house pretty soon.
LEADMALE:So what? The baby's not gonna wanna look at the photo album.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is nice.
OTHERFEMALE:We should be happy to have a little quiet time to spend like this before the baby's born.
LEADMALE:I am happy.
LEADFEMALE:The best part is, we have each other to spend it with.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, great.
LEADMALE:Glad to see somebody's having a good time tonight.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Alex, what are you doing home so early? I thought you had a date with the legendary Susie Farkas.
SUPFEMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, so did three other guys.
OTHERFEMALE:We all sat around her house and watched professional bowling on TV.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the only one who paid any attention to me was her dog, Pierre? I told him to get off my leg, and he barked.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry it went so badly for you.
LEADMALE:Ah, don't worry about it, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Tell you what.
LEADMALE:It's kind of reassuring to come home after a night like tonight, and find you the two of you on the couch carrying on like a couple of crazy teenagers.
SUPFEMALE:Makes me feel like everything's all right, you know? Oh, great.
LEADMALE:They're here.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Ho-ho.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I really missed you.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:W- what are you guys doing home now? Is the movie out already? No, Mallory saw some boy she knew, then we had to leave.
SUPMALE:She didn't wanna be seen with me.
LEADMALE:It's nothing personal, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't want him to think I've got nothing better to do on a Saturday night but to hang around with you.
SUPMALE:Now, who could take that personally? Mom, we really need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I need to reevaluate my whole life.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you have a minute? I think you're underestimating your problem, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it would take a team of mothers working around the clock.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Come up to my room.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mallory, you don't mind if we wait until tomorrow to talk, do you? I'm really pretty tired.
LEADMALE:I thought I'd finish this chapter and go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll join you, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy, please don't go to bed yet.
OTHERFEMALE:I haven't see you all day.
LEADMALE:We have a lot of catching up to do.
SUPMALE:Come on, you guys, if I'd have known I was gonna spend the evening with Mallory and Jennifer I would've stayed with Susie Farkas and Pierre.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, Alex.
LEADMALE:We're pretty tired.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you guys.
SUPMALE:It's not the same without you two.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, come on, stay.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, come on.
LEADMALE:Look, you can sleep any time.
LEADFEMALE:We're all together now.
LEADMALE:Let's do something.
SUPMALE:You know, we don't do enough family stuff anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I got a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:I could make some popcorn, and we can all watch old movies on TV.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
SUPMALE:Great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you kids do that, and we'll just toodle upstairs here.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Okay, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:You win.
SUPFEMALE:Get your old Peace Corps films.
SUPFEMALE:We'll watch those.
LEADFEMALE:Both reels? Yeah, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Both reels.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, great.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jen.
OTHERFEMALE:You can help me make popcorn.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure you wanna be seen with me? You never know who you might run into in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:What do you make of this, Steven? This morning we were the two most boring people in the world.
SUPMALE:And now they can't get enough of us.
SUPMALE:Um, maybe with kids, you just have to take it when you can get it.
LEADMALE:We've got everybody together, and we're gonna have a nice, quiet family evening.
SUPMALE:And if anybody tries to run out, I say we smack 'em.
SUPFEMALE:
