LEADMALE:Okay, now, here's what we do.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone take his own fortune cookie.
LEADMALE:And then we'll break our cookies and we'll read our fortunes aloud.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Andy, be very careful how you open that cookie.
OTHERMALE:There's an old Oriental proverb that says, "If you tear your fortune, you'll have bad luck.
LEADFEMALE:" Here, now, watch.
SUPFEMALE:Watch this.
OTHERMALE:This is That's real good, Dad.
LEADMALE:What's it say? "Stop telling people how to open fortune cookies.
LEADMALE:" Well, I got my usual one.
LEADMALE:"Fame, fortune and riches are yours for the asking Alex.
SUPMALE:" Here goes mine.
LEADMALE:"Alex, no more personalized fortunes until you pay up.
OTHERFEMALE:Signed Mr.

LEADFEMALE:" Uh, what does what does yours say, Andy? I ate mine.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, come on, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go find you another fortune.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE: Well, hi! Hello, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I hope you haven't come for dinner, Skip.
OTHERFEMALE:We're finished.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight's meat loaf surprise night at my house.
LEADMALE:Old Handelman tradition.
OTHERFEMALE:Just a regular meat loaf with many different foreign coins hidden in it.
LEADMALE:Sounds delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, can I please tell them my news now? Of course.
LEADMALE:I was just getting them warmed up.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I Everybody, I did something today that I never thought I'd do before.
SUPMALE:You wore plaids with checks? No.
SUPFEMALE:Something at school.
LEADFEMALE:You wrote in pen.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! 
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I have decided to run for school president.
SUPFEMALE:Great idea! - 
LEADMALE:Oh, that's terrific! - Good, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Wow! Tell me, Mal, how do they decide who's going to run for president of Grant? I mean, I mean, what do you what do you need to qualify for that, a "D" average and a pulse? They're not really strict about the "D" average.
LEADMALE:Honey, this is wonderful, but I got to admit I'm a little surprised.
LEADMALE:You've never shown any interest in politics before.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know I don't know.
LEADMALE:It just came to me out of nowhere.
OTHERMALE:I was sitting with a bunch of my friends, and they said, "Why don't you run?" And I said, "Are you kidding?" And then I thought, "Huh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It could be fun.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a neat job.
OTHERMALE:" So I said, "What the heck," you know?  That's pretty much the way Reagan decided to run.
OTHERMALE:Let me tell you one thing, 
LEADFEMALE:Don't take any, uh, political wisdom from Mom and Dad.
LEADMALE:What is that supposed to mean? Let's face it politically speaking, you two are the kiss of death.
OTHERMALE:I mean, just look at the candidates you supported.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, McGovern, Humphrey uh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Excitement himself, Walter Mondale.
SUPFEMALE:Those names sound so familiar.
LEADMALE:Do they go to Grant? Look, Alex, we don't get involved in the campaigns just to win.
LEADFEMALE:We do it because we feel deeply about certain political or or moral issues.
LEADMALE:It would be nice to win occasionally.
LEADMALE:Well, then, you should work on Mallory's campaign, 'cause she's going to win.
LEADMALE:Everybody at school loves her.
LEADFEMALE:She's really popular.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy's my campaign manager.
LEADFEMALE: Well well, uh, no, you're you're well on your way.
SUPMALE:I just thought Skippy could, uh, help me keep in touch with all the people at Grant that nobody talks to.
LEADFEMALE:I'm close with them.
SUPFEMALE: Wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Listen listen to my fortune.
LEADMALE:"Good fortune will soon smile on you.
OTHERFEMALE:" It's good luck for the campaign.
SUPMALE:What does yours say, Skippy? "You have 15 minutes to live.
LEADFEMALE:" How does this sound for a campaign slogan? - "Vote for Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:" - Um We need something more direct, livelier.
LEADMALE:How about just, "Vote"? That's-that's good, Skippy, but it doesn't say for who.
SUPMALE:Well, you could stand next to the sign.
LEADFEMALE:But I can't be everywhere at once.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's it.
LEADFEMALE:"Vote for Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:She can't be everywhere at once.
LEADFEMALE:" - Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Mallory, congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:I heard you're running for president of Grant.
LEADFEMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Too bad I can't vote for you.
SUPMALE:Aw.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? Skippy, only students at Grant can vote in this election.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Well, there goes my grandma's vote.
SUPMALE:What's this, Mal, material for your campaign? Yes, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Don't look at it.
LEADMALE:You'll just make fun of it.
LEADMALE: No! No, not at all.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm glad you're getting involved.
LEADFEMALE:I'm interested.
LEADFEMALE:What, uh what's your campaign platform? What's my platform, Skippy? We're trying to run a campaign here.
OTHERMALE:We don't have time to build a platform.
LEADFEMALE: I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Hi, Amy.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Uh, this is Amy Sussman, Skippy's girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Amy, this is Lauren.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:How you doing? - 
SUPFEMALE:Sorry I'm late, guys.
SUPMALE:Amy is my campaign treasurer.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, gang! - Well, well, it looks like we walked in on this big, executive campaign meeting.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, you know, Mal, uh, maybe I can help you.
LEADMALE:Uh, I don't want to brag, but I-I was president in college.
LEADFEMALE:Really, Dad? You were president of your school? Well, not exactly the entire school.
LEADMALE:I was, uh, president of the South Campus Aluminum Can Recycling Club.
LEADMALE: And a damn fine one, too.
SUPMALE:Well, uh Excuse me, but if but if Mallory's going to win, she's going to need something more than a "give a hoot, don't pollute" platform.
LEADMALE:Oh, I like that.
LEADFEMALE:Can we use it, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton? - Be my guest, Skip.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to go pick Andy up at school.
LEADFEMALE:Would you mind dropping me off at campus? - Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, not at all, Lauren.
LEADMALE:It'll give me time to, uh, tell you a little bit about the work I did as president of the recycling club.
LEADMALE:Steven, I've heard that story a million times.
LEADFEMALE:Sit in the back, Elyse.
LEADMALE:You know, I had a little slogan, and I had a little magnet I think the first thing we need is a, uh a good campaign strategy.
LEADFEMALE:Any ideas? I have a few ideas.
OTHERMALE:But first, I have a question.
LEADMALE:What exactly is a campaign strategy? Well, a campaign strategy is a 
OTHERMALE:Alex I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:It's your campaign.
LEADMALE:You guys run with it.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead, Mal.
OTHERMALE:Uh a campaign strategy, huh? What's something that you really believe in? Like, uh, more study hours, hard work, good grades.
LEADFEMALE:No, not those.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what, then? Well, I guess I feel that the students should have more of a say in what goes on at Grant.
SUPFEMALE:Like, remember last year, out of the blue, all of a sudden, they took out the diet soda machine? And-and I said, "This is wrong.
LEADMALE:" A lot of people a lot of people agreed.
LEADFEMALE:There you go, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:That's good.
SUPMALE:That's good.
LEADMALE:That's something the students can get behind.
LEADFEMALE:Diet soda? Well, it's not just diet soda, Mal.
LEADMALE:It's-it's a vision that you stand for, uh, to make life easier and more pleasurable for weight-conscious students.
LEADFEMALE:"Vote for Mal, go low-cal.
LEADMALE:" Look, Alex, I don't know if I can get the soda machine put back in.
LEADMALE:And I don't want to make promises I can't keep.
SUPMALE:Well, you have no place in politics.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll tell you I'd vote for someone who could get that soda machine back.
LEADFEMALE:There you go, Mal.
SUPMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:I can feel the groundswell starting.
LEADMALE: I'll tell you something else.
LEADFEMALE:I miss the low-fat chocolate milk with the twisty straws.
LEADFEMALE:Who doesn't? Who doesn't? I can feel it, Mal.
OTHERFEMALE:You're going to win this thing.
SUPFEMALE:I do have another idea about changing the color of the drapes in the student center.
LEADMALE:I like it.
SUPFEMALE:It's hip.
LEADMALE:It's fresh.
LEADMALE:It's contemporary.
SUPFEMALE:It's what the people want.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, Mal, there's only one ingredient missing here for a winning campaign.
LEADMALE:Let's see, we've got diet soda, chocolate milk and drapes.
LEADFEMALE:What's she missing? Oh, Alex, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm nervous about this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:You've got nothing to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:It's the first day on the campaign trail.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go out there and let's get 'em, huh? Remember our platform? "Confidence, diet soda and new drapes.
OTHERMALE:" All right, let's go.
LEADFEMALE: Hi there.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Uh, I'd like you to meet Mallory Keaton, uh, candidate for student government president.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How-how how's your sandwich? Not bad.
SUPFEMALE: Oh.
LEADMALE:It looks a little dry.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you could use a diet soda to go with that.
LEADMALE:I hate diet soda.
SUPFEMALE:MALLORY 
LEADMALE:What do I do? - Try the drapes, try the drapes.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Don't you think we could use some new drapes in here? I mean, these are so ugly.
SUPMALE:My mother made those drapes.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, why does it have to be so complicated? Why can't I just put up posters, pass out buttons and take my chances? Because you want to win, okay? And you're going to win.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
SUPFEMALE:Trust me.
LEADFEMALE:I've got every detail worked out.
LEADMALE: Look, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Mallory Keaton, our choice for student government president.
OTHERMALE:She looks just like she does on these buttons.
LEADMALE:And these posters.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, is it true that you're planning on getting a new soda machine for the snack bar? And low-fat chocolate milk with twisty straws? Well, I was thinking about it.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, what's going on? 
OTHERMALE:Mallory, it's me, Skippy.
LEADMALE: Hey! Where is a guy supposed to get a diet soda around this place? And a room with some decent drapes? Well you raise a fine point, young man.
OTHERMALE:You know you know, Grant College is in desperate need of new, fresh leadership.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you are damn right, you know, and I don't even go to school here.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, what's going on? Hey, Mal, it's me, Nick.
OTHERMALE: Excuse me, did you say something about a soda machine? Yes, she did.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, she did.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, have you seen Mallory's position paper? Alex, I haven't seen my position paper.
SUPMALE:Look at 
LEADFEMALE:"If elected, Mallory Keaton promises to put an end to pop quizzes.
LEADMALE:"  - What? - If you like that if you like that, try number three.
SUPFEMALE:"Frequent flyer bonus miles for commuting students.
SUPFEMALE:"  We can't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, look at these people.
OTHERMALE:They're delirious.
SUPMALE:They'll do anything for you.
LEADMALE:Just go with it.
LEADMALE:Go with it.

LEADFEMALE:STUDENTS

SUPFEMALE:Alex asked me to hang it up in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh, well, what is it, uh Well it's good to see the campaign has brought out Alex's sense of fairness.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory wasn't even on the first poster.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE: Hi, honey.
OTHERMALE:Oh, did you, uh? - I'm so t Oh, great! He finally put my picture on it.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Where have you been, honey? Oh, all over.
SUPFEMALE:Alex has the Keaton campaign trail fully booked.
LEADMALE:I was over on campus this morning passing out campaign buttons to people in the infirmary.
SUPFEMALE:Alex said I should get them in a weakened state.
LEADFEMALE:And then I was over at the snack bar passing out little mustard packets with "Let Mallory spice up your life" printed on 'em.
SUPMALE:Oh, here are some extras.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.

LEADFEMALE: Are you enjoying the campaign? It's tiring, but it's fun.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I've been speaking in public.
LEADMALE:I've met everyone on campus.
LEADMALE:And I've I've had a chance to really listen to people and find out what they're thinking.
LEADFEMALE:What are they thinking? Well, some are thinking about their future, and some are concerned about academics, and some are just sort of staring straight ahead.
SUPMALE:Well, that sounds great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's a good experience for you.
LEADMALE:Well, I-I think it's nice.

LEADFEMALE:We're getting along really well.
OTHERFEMALE:We haven't been fighting at all.

LEADMALE:Uh, what what do you mean, Mal? I'm saying things that would not normally come out of my mouth.
SUPFEMALE:That's because they're coming out of my mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I don't know if I just want to be a puppet.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, suddenly puppet's not good enough for you.
LEADFEMALE:It just doesn't feel like me.
LEADMALE:Look, Mal, we've come this far together.

LEADFEMALE:Alex.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, where were you guys? - We went to vote.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, what took so long? I got stuck in the voting booth.

LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:How are you? - Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Nick.
SUPMALE:Hey! I, uh, got you these for good luck.

SUPFEMALE:That's sweet.
SUPFEMALE:It was no big deal, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, if you get elected president, then I'll be the first lady of Grant College.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure they'll use that in all the brochures.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, nothing for the campaign manager? Just this.
LEADMALE:No flowers? Nothing? If you win.
LEADFEMALE: Alex, quick, turn on the radio! They're announcing the election results!

OTHERMALE:We don't have the final totals just yet in today's student government presidential election.
LEADMALE:Ah, what what, are you having trouble counting the votes? 
OTHERMALE:We're having a little trouble counting the votes.
SUPFEMALE:It's not that the votes aren't in; it's just that we're having trouble counting them.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we finally got this sorted out! The new president of Grant College is Marsha Elkins.
SUPFEMALE: What?! 
LEADMALE:Marsha Elkins.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:Mal, you were great, really.
LEADFEMALE:You tried  Speech! Speech! Oh.

OTHERFEMALE:Thanks to everyone who voted for me, and thanks to my family and and my brother and campaign manager, Alex P.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton.
OTHERMALE: Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE: He taught me to strive hard and do my best, and who, I'm sure, would want me to be gracious in defeat.
LEADFEMALE:Marsha Elkins that idiot! I demand a recount.
SUPMALE:I demand a recount.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry you didn't win, Mal.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm fine, though.
LEADFEMALE:It's really no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's easy for you to say.
LEADMALE:Your mother and I thought we were finally going to win an election.
SUPFEMALE:Alex says, "If you want to win, you have to vote Republican.
OTHERMALE:" Go back to sleep.
SUPFEMALE: Alex, where were you? Oh, I was over at the math department trying to get the final tally on the vote.
OTHERFEMALE:Took a while because they were counting on their fingers.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, uh, they were right.
LEADFEMALE:You lost by 103 votes.
SUPMALE:We're proud of you, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Takes a lot of courage just to run.
LEADFEMALE:And I know how hard you tried, Mal.
LEADMALE:I, uh I've never mentioned this before, but the first time I ran for president of the South Campus Aluminum Can Recycling Club I lost.
LEADFEMALE:It was to Warren McCracken.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, the-the interesting thing about Warren, he he had a nose for aluminum.
SUPMALE:He he could spot an aluminum can at Give it up, Dad.
SUPMALE:You know, Mal, this election is not over by a long shot.
SUPFEMALE:First thing in the morning, I'm going back to that campus and I'm going to demand another recount.
OTHERFEMALE:Another recount? Why? Because, Mal, there were numerous voting irregularities there.
LEADMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:I committed them.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Alex, it's over.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I-I-I ran, I tried hard, and-and I lost, and that's it.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you do it? I mean, why did you suddenly get so involved with my life? I don't know, Mal.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:I guess, um I guess I-I I just finally saw something we could do together.
LEADMALE:I mean, something we had in common.
LEADMALE:I just I just wanted to jump at the chance to do it.
LEADMALE:Pretty soon, we're not going to be living under the same roof together anymore.
SUPMALE:Are you trying to tell me that you're moving out? Don't get too excited, Mal.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to be sensitive here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Anyway, the fact is, um, pretty soon, we we may not be seeing each other that much.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh, I'm going to graduate, marry Lauren, get a job on Wall Street, move to New York.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm going to graduate, marry Nick and get a job in the fashion industry and move to New York.
LEADFEMALE:You aren't going to live uptown, are you? Downtown.
LEADMALE:Well, there you go.
SUPMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:We won't be seeing Anyway, I just wanted to make the most of the last times we have together.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know, it's funny, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Any any time we try to do something together, it turns out to be a disaster.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, that's not true.
SUPFEMALE:That's not true.
LEADMALE:We've had some very good times together.
SUPFEMALE:You remember when we were kids? Saturday mornings, okay? Mom and Dad would sleep late.
SUPMALE:And we'd come down at 6:30 in the morning in our pajamas.
SUPFEMALE:Right, exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I was five, and you were about seven.
LEADMALE:Um, I'd start breakfast, and you'd go down in the driveway and get the Wa// Street Journa/.
LEADMALE:Mom and Dad would always leave out that box of granola, - 'cause they didn't want us to eat sugared cereals.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:We used to go over to Skippy's and get Fruit Loops.
LEADMALE:You'd think they'd notice we had the same box of granola for 12 years.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know when else we had fun? Uh, remember when Mom and Dad finally decided we could stay home without a babysitter? And we'd make popcorn and watch TV? And we were supposed to be in bed, asleep by 11:00, and we were too scared to turn out the lights? No, I I wasn't scared.
LEADMALE:Alex, you used to cry until Mom and Dad came home.
SUPMALE:I missed them.
LEADMALE:So we'd we'd go up to my room and talk, and and I'd tell you which boys I liked in school, and you'd tell me which ones had the best earning potential.
LEADFEMALE:And look who you wound up with.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:We don't talk like that anymore.
LEADFEMALE:It's too bad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's an interesting thing, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I mean, I can argue politics with Dad or, uh, discuss family stuff with Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Or discuss economics with Jennifer.
OTHERMALE:But you you understand my emotional side better than anybody.
OTHERMALE:Really? I didn't think you even had one.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Remember the night after Ellen left for Paris? You stayed up all night, you know, talking to me and listening to me.
LEADMALE:You understood.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll never forget those nights you stayed up trying to teach me long division.
LEADFEMALE:You got a concussion from banging your head against the wall.
SUPFEMALE:I still don't understand it.
SUPMALE:You know, I'm going to look back on life in this house, and I'm going to remember those mornings.
SUPMALE:And I'm going to remember the nights babysitting.
LEADMALE:And I'm going to remember tonight.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE: Sorry about the election, huh? We'll get 'em next year.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, not a chance.
SUPFEMALE:I got an idea.
LEADMALE:What? I have an idea.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow morning, we'll wake up just like we used to.
OTHERMALE:We come down in our pajamas, and we make breakfast.
SUPMALE:Granola is still here.
LEADFEMALE:
