SUPMALE:Here you are, Andy your very own magic set.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I don't know if I told you, but, uh, I was quite a magician in my day.
SUPMALE:In fact, I can do any trick there is.
SUPMALE:Can you disappear? We'll work up to that.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, the, uh, first trick I want to show you is called the magic rings.
SUPFEMALE:As you can see, these three rings are all attached.
SUPFEMALE:All I do is say the magic words abracadabra and presto! I can't believe my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Dad, how you doing? Hey, Andy.
LEADFEMALE: Hi.
OTHERMALE:What's going on, Dad, Dracula tryouts? 
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Dad's in his magic phase again.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:We've all been through it before.
SUPMALE:Are you saying that you doubt my magical powers? I have here a dollar bill.
SUPFEMALE: Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:I will rip this dollar bill into little pieces.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! Aah! - Ah Aah! Never fear, Alex.
LEADMALE:Never fear.
SUPFEMALE:Just say the magic words.
LEADMALE:Ah, hummuna, hummuna.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:And presto.
LEADMALE:Oops.
LEADFEMALE:You killed it! All right, uh, class is dismissed for today.
LEADMALE:Yay! He masks his enthusiasm well.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Carnac.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, do you want to give us a hand cleaning up? Uh, company is coming.
LEADFEMALE:Who's the company? Oh, Evelyn Mitchum.
SUPMALE:Evelyn Mitchum? Yeah, you remember my friend, Rosalie Mitchum.
LEADMALE:She used to live around the corner.
LEADMALE:Well, this is her mom.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I remember.
LEADFEMALE:They must have moved away about three years now.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, two and a half.
SUPMALE:Yeah, remember during the '76 election they had that, uh that Carter-Mondale sign in the front yard? God, what an eyesore that was.
LEADMALE:Funny funny how it kept disappearing.
LEADFEMALE:And kept showing up in our basement.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this is the first time since Rosalie died that Evelyn's come back here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sometimes it's still hard for me to believe.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, 18 years old, and she took her own life.
SUPFEMALE:God, it's so sad.
LEADMALE:I don't know if I can handle this.
LEADMALE:I mean, how are we supposed to act in front of Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Mitchum? Just act normal.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, just act close to normal.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, there she is.
LEADMALE:Oh! - So good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you! - You look great.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Hi, Evelyn.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, gosh.
LEADMALE:Everyone, you remember Evelyn Mitchum.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Mallory look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're just you're a beautiful young woman.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hi, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Mitchum.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please, please, call me Evelyn.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, you look terrific.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:All grown-up now, huh? Nice to see you, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Mitchum.
LEADMALE:Please call me Evelyn.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, uh hope you're not still angry about that that, uh, Carter-Mondale incident, Evelyn.
LEADFEMALE:Please, call me Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Mitchum.
SUPMALE:So, you really like living in New York, huh? Yeah, it's-it's great.
OTHERMALE:It took a little getting used to, but it's very exciting.
LEADMALE:Do you live near Bloomingdale's? I live in Bloomingdale's, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Oh, I want to go to New York so bad, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, Evelyn, you don't have to do the dishes.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be silly.
LEADMALE:I don't mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Mmm.
SUPMALE:All right, everyone into the living room for levitation.
LEADFEMALE:So, Mallory, how's everything going with you? Oh, great.
SUPMALE:Um, I'm a-a sophomore at Grant College.
LEADFEMALE:I'm majoring in-in fashion design.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's great.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad to hear you kept up with that.
SUPFEMALE:You always had a great eye for fashion.
LEADMALE:I remember Rosalie would come home from school saying, "Mallory's wearing a paisley skirt.
SUPFEMALE:I want a paisley skirt.
SUPMALE:" Or, "Mallory's wearing a checked blouse.
LEADFEMALE:I want a checked blouse.
SUPFEMALE:" Well, I hope I wasn't wearing them together.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I have I have very warm memories of you and Rosalie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Those letters you wrote her really meant a lot to her.
SUPMALE:I think she was very lonely in New York.
LEADMALE:She never quite seemed to get the rhythm of the city.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh I got a sense of that in the letters she wrote me.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Well, what exactly did she say? Did-did she say anything specific? Oh well, you know Rosalie.
LEADMALE:She'd write four pages on the color of the trees in Central Park.
LEADFEMALE:And I'd reply with four pages on the, uh, color of the blouse I was wearing.
SUPMALE:You could always make her laugh, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:You were one of the few people who could.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, I really miss her.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:This is this is hard for you to talk about.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I want to talk about this.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, there are a lot of questions I don't have any answers to, and and you're one of the few people that really knew her.
OTHERMALE: Elyse, you're breaking the mood! I just thought I'd levitate in here for a while.
OTHERFEMALE:How's the magic going, Mom? Not so well I had to get in here before your father tried to saw me in half.
LEADMALE:Well, it's getting a little late.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, thanks for dinner, Elyse.
LEADMALE:I'm going to head back to the hotel.
LEADMALE:Mallory would you like to get together tomorrow? Maybe, uh, go to a museum, do some shopping? Great, yeah.
LEADMALE:I'd love for you to meet Nick.
LEADFEMALE:All right, then it's a date.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Well, are you all right? Yeah, it's just  It's so weird.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, you know, standing here in-in my kitchen, talking to Rosalie's mom about Rosalie, and Rosalie is dead.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It just doesn't seem real.
LEADMALE:It takes a brave woman to come back and face all those memories.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I get the feeling she really needs to talk about it.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's a good thing that you're here for her.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE: 
SUPMALE:Sorry! Wrong chant.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Dad's going completely overboard with this magic business.
LEADMALE:He's all tied up in a chair, and he's bet Alex ten dollars that he can get out by dinnertime.
SUPFEMALE:This Houdini stuff has got to stop.
LEADMALE:Hey, h-h-hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, did you guys have a good time? - Oh - Oh, we had a great time.
SUPMALE:We went to the museum, we went shopping.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't mind, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh, bought a few presents for Mallory.
SUPMALE:I mean, she would look at these clothes like she was in love.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't resist.
LEADMALE:Boy, she knows her way around a mall - like no one I've ever seen.
LEADMALE:Oh That's my girl.
LEADMALE:You know that waterfront area? Boy, that's really built up a lot.
LEADMALE:Yeah, 400 stores under one roof.
SUPFEMALE:You can get almost all your shopping done there.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mom! Evelyn invited us to stay with her in New York next month.
SUPMALE:She said the best museums are in New York.
SUPMALE:Uh, did you know they call New York the Big Apple? Anybody know why? No.
SUPFEMALE:Why, Nick? Well, I-I don't know.
LEADMALE:I was hoping one of you would know.
LEADMALE: No fair, Dad! You cannot chew your way through the rope! Uh-uh.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:I escaped! Not only that, but I won't have to floss for a week.
LEADMALE:I know these are words you don't enjoy hearing, but pay up, son.
LEADMALE: - Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:This is way too easy.
LEADMALE: What I really need is a straight jacket.
OTHERMALE:You read my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm going to go put these things upstairs.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll give you a hand.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I really like that Nick.
LEADMALE:What's not to like? Rosalie seems very happy with him.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? I said she and Nick seem very happy together.
LEADFEMALE:You know, we stopped at the playground on the way home.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, boy, did that bring back a lot of memories.
LEADFEMALE:Seems like everything's memories now.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, are you okay? You know, I remember when Rosalie was a little girl.
SUPMALE:She ran inside to tell me about a a bird's nest that she'd found in the yard, and I don't know, I just I I'd had a hard day at work, and I remember I just I didn't hear what she said.
LEADMALE:So I got angry at her for tracking mud into the house.
LEADMALE:And she looked at me with her eyes so full of love.
LEADMALE:How could I yell at her? Um can you hand me that? Hmm? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You know, it just, uh it just gets to me sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it would.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? You know, something like that happens, and you, uh you don't think it's forever.
LEADMALE:You think that somehow they're going to come back.
SUPFEMALE:But they don't, you know? They don't.
SUPMALE:Okay, Alex.
LEADMALE:Pick a card any card.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Jennifer, Jennifer, just the person I want to see.
SUPFEMALE:Get in this box.
LEADMALE:What is this, Daddy Dearest? Come on.
SUPMALE:Steven, we're not gonna put our daughter in a magic box.
LEADMALE:Well, okay, Elyse, then you-you help me.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jen, get in.
LEADMALE:That's All right, then When I next open this box, my daughter Jennifer will be gone! Come one, come all, from far and near.
SUPFEMALE:You have seen my daughter dear.
OTHERFEMALE:I will make her disappear!  Well, that's-that's very good.
LEADFEMALE:Now-now bring her back.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:She's gone, she's gone, alack, alack! I will bring my daughter back.
LEADFEMALE: Yeah, okay.
LEADMALE: Okay.
LEADMALE:Jennifer? Jennifer, the trick worked.
LEADFEMALE:The, uh come out, now.
LEADFEMALE: She's really gone.
LEADFEMALE:Can you do that with Mallory? Uh, wh-wh-what's going on here? Where is Jennifer? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean you don't know? You have one child under a spell and the other one's vanished? I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I didn't know I was this good.
SUPMALE:Well, could you get him to walk? I think so.
OTHERFEMALE:Andrew, I command you to  Arise and walk.
LEADMALE:Levitatos, el niÃ±o.
LEADMALE:Come come 
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE: Hi, Mom.
OTHERMALE:Huh? - Nick's not here yet, is he? - Uh, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, gosh, I don't want to be late.
SUPFEMALE:Evelyn's taking us to the ballet tonight.
OTHERMALE:Oh, really? Well, that's six nights in a row - you've all been out together.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm really having a great time.
LEADMALE:I think it's good for her to be with someone my age.
SUPMALE:You know, we talk about Rosalie a lot, and I think it's really helping her.
SUPFEMALE:That's nice.
LEADMALE:Just try not to get too deeply involved here.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I can handle this.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to help her.
SUPMALE:Honey we cannot begin to imagine the kind of pain that Evelyn is going through.
SUPFEMALE:But I don't think it's your responsibility to take that pain away.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Rosalie and I were best friends I owe it to her.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you don't.
LEADFEMALE: Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:I can't just walk away from this 'cause I might be afraid.
LEADMALE:That's not right, either.
LEADFEMALE:Oh -  - Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hey, babe! - Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:You ready? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm kind of excited about this.
SUPFEMALE:I ain't never been to the ballet before.
LEADMALE:No kidding.
LEADMALE:We'll see you, Mom.
OTHERMALE:Good-bye, darling.
OTHERMALE:Have a good time.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE: You think I scared him enough to make him quit? I hate to say this, but I am really bored.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know if we should stay for the second half.
SUPMALE:Hey, I was enjoying it; I was sleeping good.
LEADFEMALE: What are we gonna say to Evelyn? Maybe we shouldn't say anything; maybe we should just go.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, we can't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, right, right, right, right.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE: Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, could I get anybody something to drink? - I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Um, I'd love some orange juice.
OTHERMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:You know, and by the way, I love this ballet; very restful.
OTHERFEMALE: I'm sorry, it's not very good.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Do you see much ballet, Mallory? Oh, me? Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure.
SUPMALE:What was the last one you saw? Uh  Annie.
LEADFEMALE:It was great.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Rosalie and I used to come here to the ballet all the time.
OTHERMALE:Oh, she loved it.
SUPMALE:She'd say, as soon as the lights went down, she'd escape to another world.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Rosalie loved music.
LEADMALE:I remember in sixth grade she was the only girl with all the Partridge Family albums, even when it wasn't cool anymore.
SUPMALE:You know, she, uh wouldn't go to the ballet with me in New York.
LEADFEMALE:She wouldn't do anything with me; she just shut off.
LEADFEMALE:It was like she knew that it mattered to me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that doesn't sound like Rosalie.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure she had reasons.
LEADFEMALE:Don't defend her.
LEADMALE:She knew what she was doing, believe me.
LEADFEMALE:Um Evelyn, maybe this is not such a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I don't know if we should all stay for the second half.
SUPMALE:You're not leaving.
LEADMALE:What? You're staying till the end.
SUPMALE:Rosalie would have stayed till the end.
LEADMALE:I'm not Rosalie.
LEADMALE:I know that.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you think I know that? - Um, Evelyn - How could she have hurt herself like that? How could she have hurt me like that? What did I do? Evelyn, you can't blame yours She could've talked to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Anytime.
LEADFEMALE:I was there, I was ready to listen! You know how many times I went into her room, trying to get her to talk to me?! How could you leave me?! - What? - How could you do that to me, Rosalie?! - I'm not Rosalie.
OTHERMALE:You I knew I would be the first one to find you! How could you put me through that! You were my life! - Evelyn, I'm not her! - You meant everything to me! My God, I'm your mother! Evelyn?! Hey, uh, Mal, they didn't have orange juice, so I got you pineapple juice.
SUPMALE:I hope you don't mind.
LEADMALE:Um, I have to get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I didn't know it would bug you so much.
LEADFEMALE:No um, um, uh, take Evelyn home.
SUPMALE: Mal, she's crying.
LEADMALE:I I have to get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:All right, here you are, Andy a poodle! Thanks! My very own poodle!  What'll it be, Alex? A mouse? Peacock? Giraffe? - Dad - Hm? This has got to stop.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? Dad Dad, you're a well-educated guy and-and, and-and most of the time, you're pretty normal, but Dad, you got to face it you have a problem.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, it's just a hobby.
LEADMALE:No, Dad, Dad, Dad  It's an obsession.
LEADFEMALE:It's a compulsion.
SUPFEMALE:You have a compulsion for say it with me you have a compulsion for - birthday party tricks.
LEADFEMALE:Birthday party tricks.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, that's right, Dad.
LEADMALE:And it's got to stop the party is over.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, Alex.
SUPMALE:I need help.
LEADFEMALE:Attaboy, Dad.
SUPMALE:Attaboy, attaboy admitting it is the first step.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, come quick.
SUPMALE:Andy's poodle exploded.
LEADMALE:Oh, no! - Hey, Dad 
SUPFEMALE:Well Oh, God.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mom.
SUPMALE:Hi, hon.
LEADMALE: I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Must have been some ballet.
LEADMALE:I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE: That was Evelyn.
LEADFEMALE:It went too far.
SUPMALE:She started yelling at me.
LEADMALE:But she wasn't really yelling at me, she was yelling at me like I was, uh, Rosalie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:  I had this idea that I could help her, that I could fill this void that Rosalie left and I wanted to ease her pain.
LEADMALE:I think I wound up just hurting her more.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you didn't hurt Evelyn; Rosalie did.
LEADMALE: It's so weird! Rosalie and I were best friends.
SUPMALE:We wore the same clothes.
LEADMALE:We snuck in movies together.
OTHERMALE:We got caught smoking cigarettes in the girls' bathroom together.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me? You didn't hear about that, Mom? - No.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, it's water under the bridge.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't know how she could've made a decision like that.
SUPMALE:I mean, how could she have been so sad? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE: I mean, no matter how bad a day is, there's always tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there's always a chance that things can get better.
SUPMALE:I guess Rosalie didn't see it that way.
LEADMALE: She always saw things so differently.
LEADMALE:Even when we were little, I could tell she felt things much deeper than anyone else.
LEADMALE:She was so sensitive!  I remember, one time, we were in McDonald's and these girls started picking on her, and they were much bigger than us, so I stood in front of Rosalie and I took out a cherry pie and I threatened them with the hot fruit filling.
OTHERFEMALE:And they backed off, but Rosalie, she ran outside and she started to cry.
LEADMALE:But it was the way she was crying it's like it's like they hurt her so deeply, in her soul.
LEADFEMALE:It's like she couldn't help herself from hurting so deep.
OTHERMALE: Honey 
LEADMALE:Hello, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, can I talk to you? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, why don't you and I go in the living room, and you can tell me all about the ballet.
LEADMALE:You can start at the beginning, okay? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, first, the lights went down, and then the music started up real soft.
OTHERMALE:And then one person in the audience coughed, and then another and another.
OTHERFEMALE:And that was a real nice surprise, because I was not aware that it was gonna be an audience participation.
LEADFEMALE:What I did tonight was unforgivable.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't be her, Evelyn.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what I was doing.
LEADFEMALE:You're such a beautiful girl, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:You're so full of light and life, and I guess, when Rosalie died, I thought I'd never see that light again.
LEADMALE:Why did you come back here, Evelyn? I guess I wanted to turn back time.
LEADMALE:I wanted to try to remember when everything was okay.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if we hadn't moved away things would still be okay.
LEADFEMALE:I keep thinking, if I'd just done something different, this never would have happened.
LEADFEMALE:You can't think like that, Evelyn it wasn't your fault.
SUPMALE:I guess I spend so much time thinking about the past because I just can't bear to face tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Well, you have been, every day.
LEADFEMALE:You know my biggest fear?  God what am I saying this to you for? - I've done enough damage already.
LEADFEMALE:No, Evelyn it's tell me it's okay.
LEADMALE:My biggest fear is that I'll forget her.
OTHERMALE:That I'll wake up one morning and I won't remember the sight of her face or the sound of her voice or what it felt like, you know, when she was a little girl and she used to put her hand in mine.
LEADFEMALE:So I struggle every day  to try to keep those thoughts very clear in my mind.
SUPFEMALE:And I guess you were part of all that.
LEADFEMALE: I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be.
SUPFEMALE: Rosalie was the most precious thing in my life.
LEADMALE:I guess I'm not ready to stop loving her.
LEADMALE:Well, you don't have to.
SUPMALE:I mean you can still love the spirit of who she was.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't been able to do that.
LEADMALE:
