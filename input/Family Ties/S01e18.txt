OTHERFEMALE:So, what did you guys do today? Well, I picked up ming after school, and we went to the library.
LEADMALE:They were showing a film, "the Dewey decimal system and you.
LEADFEMALE:" Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Did you have trouble handling the excitement, ming? Actually, it was very interesting.
LEADMALE:And the librarian's a knockout.
SUPFEMALE:That's true.
SUPMALE:I meant that in a bibliographical sort of way.
LEADFEMALE:After Alex woke me, we went out and got an ice cream soda.
LEADFEMALE:And then Alex asked this girl Uh, ming, that's, uh, guy talk, remember? Gotcha.
OTHERFEMALE:Gotcha.
SUPFEMALE:That's the best thing about having a big brother Guy talk.

LEADFEMALE:I get to use the blue one.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, ming, I-i don't think you do have time for that.
SUPMALE:I was kind of hoping you'd be able to read this before your mom got here.
SUPMALE:That way we'd have something to talk about tomorrow.
LEADMALE:What is it? Oh, it's, uh, just a little something I threw together.
LEADMALE:It's kind of a "weekly reader" version of the "U.
LEADFEMALE:S.
LEADFEMALE:news and world report.
LEADFEMALE:" Just think of it as a companion piece to my "wall street journal" summaries.
LEADFEMALE:Can't I take it home with me, Alex? Ming, it's my only copy.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure you don't want to chain it to his wrist? No, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Alex is right.
OTHERFEMALE:This will be more fun.
LEADMALE:I can play anytime.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to the dining room to study this.
LEADFEMALE:What a kid.
SUPMALE:You know, this really excites me Shaping his ideas, molding his mind.
LEADMALE:Now I know how you guys must have felt when I was growing up.
LEADMALE:No, you don't.
SUPMALE:Alex, you know there's more to being a big brother than just trying to mold him in your image.
SUPMALE:I know that.
OTHERFEMALE:And I and I love that.
OTHERFEMALE:It's great to have a little guy to take places, a little guy to ask me questions, a-a little guy It's great to have a guy who's littler than me.

OTHERMALE:I've heard such nice things about you from ming and Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Alex.
LEADMALE:Actually, most of it was from ming.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know, it wouldn't look right for me to brag about my own family.
LEADFEMALE:You must be so happy to have Alex as a big brother.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know if "happy" is the word I would have chosen.
LEADMALE:Girls, why don't you go let ming know his mom is here? I gave him some pretty interesting stuff.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be hard to tear him away from his reading.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's going to be.
LEADMALE:He looks so cute when he's asleep.
LEADMALE:How you doing, Jennifer? Okay, but my tongue's getting yucky.
SUPMALE:Why don't you guys switch jobs? You can stuff the envelopes, and Mallory can lick them.
LEADMALE:I don't want to mess up my lip gloss, mom.
OTHERMALE:That's okay, mom.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think we have time to retrain her.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, gang.
LEADMALE:Hi, dad.
SUPMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:How was it down at the station? Oh, a little disappointing.

LEADFEMALE:Well, what was it about last night? Uh, last night? I didn't actually see it last night.
LEADFEMALE:Dad? Uh, I-i meant to see it.
LEADFEMALE:I saw it.
LEADFEMALE:It was about highway repair.
OTHERMALE:If any potholes spring up in the living room, call me.
LEADMALE:How's it going here? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:We're getting out the announcements for the circus benefit.
LEADFEMALE:I have a lot of big surprises there, too.
SUPFEMALE:As long as there's nothing that involves me and a tiger.
LEADMALE:Alex home? No, he's out with ming.
LEADMALE:Uh, they went to a lecture on money management for success-oriented adolescents.
SUPFEMALE:Same kind of thing we did when we were kids.
SUPMALE:Huh? Alex, you're supposed to be his big brother, not his twin brother.
LEADFEMALE:No, he picked it out all by himself.
SUPMALE:I said he could buy any outfit in the store he wanted, or I'd buy him this one.
LEADMALE:Guess you were short of cash, huh, ming? We also got these.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna hang them up in our rooms.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna take these upstairs.
OTHERMALE:I want to hang up mine now.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll bet nobody else has a great big picture of Alex in his room.
LEADFEMALE:Alex does.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:He's hard to keep up with.
LEADMALE:You having a good time with him, ming? Well, the time of my life.
LEADMALE:Alex is the greatest.
LEADMALE:He's brainwashed him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know Alex can be a little intense at times.
LEADMALE:He's probably just going through a phase.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's what we thought at first.
SUPFEMALE:Now we think it's nutritional deficiency.
SUPMALE:All right, what do you want to do now? Let's look at the chart.
SUPMALE:What kind of chart is that? Oh, well, when I took on the responsibility of being ming's big brother, I had to reorganize my time.
SUPFEMALE:It wasn't easy, but I think I've got it worked out.
SUPFEMALE:See, I mapped out all my activities School, chess club, girls, special girls, susie farkas.
LEADFEMALE:Well, commerce department hearings start in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:What say we go upstairs and get our notebooks ready? But, Alex, what about free play? Well, we had free play yesterday.
LEADMALE:I'm a kid, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I need to play every day.
SUPFEMALE:All right, you've got, uh, four minutes.
SUPMALE:What do you want to do? I guess the mile run is out.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever you want to do, Alex, is fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't we go outside and toss the football around, then? We've got time for, uh, 23 throws each, allowing for miscellaneous flubs.
OTHERFEMALE:I say we go for it.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go for it.
SUPMALE:You're gonna go for the whole four minutes, huh, Alex? Why not? Life is short.

SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, but I won't be able to go to the circus with you.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
SUPMALE:Do I look like someone who'd want to go to the circus? Maybe a little.
SUPMALE:I got a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't I go to the meeting with you? That way we can still be together this afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be silly, ming.
LEADMALE:You're gonna have a lot more fun at the circus.
OTHERMALE:Fun's not that important, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You taught me that.

LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and you look great.
OTHERMALE:They drew a big mouth on you and a big nose.
OTHERMALE:They even drew a little tear.
LEADFEMALE:Every time we go to the circus, it's always the same thing.
LEADMALE:You know you guys shouldn't eat all that stuff, but you go right ahead and do it.
SUPMALE:Once in a while, we just can't resist.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'd better go upstairs and change.
SUPMALE:Thanks for taking me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ah, honey, it was our pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry you didn't have such a good time.
OTHERMALE:I had a really good time, a great time.

LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.

LEADMALE:And I love him very much.
LEADMALE:I couldn't be happier.
LEADMALE:You know, I'll never forget the first day I met him.
LEADFEMALE:I wore plaid, he wore stripes.
LEADMALE:I was afraid we'd clash.
LEADMALE:But we looked great together.
LEADMALE:It's nice that you remember that, Alex.
LEADMALE:It's not an easy day to forget.
LEADFEMALE:He had such a cute walk, one foot in front of the other.
SUPFEMALE:And then when he ran, it was the same thing, only faster.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't plan on becoming emotionally involved.
LEADMALE:But this crazy thing just happened.
LEADMALE:You don't plan those things, Alex.
LEADMALE:You don't control them.

LEADFEMALE:In the bed.
LEADMALE:That's the place for it.
LEADFEMALE:Were you always this boring, Alex? I'm nervous.
LEADFEMALE:I always talk like this when I'm when I'm nervous.

LEADMALE:I think this is one of those times.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I-i just wanted to come by and say hi and, uh, give you this.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:But I don't know when I'll be dressing up like a clown again.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, always makes a great paper weight.
SUPMALE:My mom's getting me a new big brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Bigger than you.
SUPFEMALE:I guess there's no chance you'd take me back, huh? Why should I? Because I miss you, ming.
LEADFEMALE:You've got a lot of nerve, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You dump me, and then because you miss me, you expect me to take you back? I'm not saying I deserve you.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying I want you.
SUPMALE:You don't want me.
LEADFEMALE:You want a little you.
LEADFEMALE:You want someone that looks like you, acts like you, and thinks like you.

LEADFEMALE:What if I want to be a liberal democrat? Why would you possibly Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be with you.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't like it, but I'd be with you.
LEADMALE:Well I already got your picture up.
