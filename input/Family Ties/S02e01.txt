LEADMALE:I JUST WANT TO SAY, FOR THE RECORD, THAT I AM OPPOSED TO THIS.
SUPMALE:SO RECORDED.
SUPMALE:YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE THING IS MY FAULT.
LEADFEMALE:I MEAN, IF I HAD GONE OUT WITH CARRIE, LIKE SHE ASKED ME TO, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO OUT WITH SOCIETAL DREGS.
SUPFEMALE: ALEX IS JEALOUS.
LEADMALE:YOU'RE DYING TO GO OUT WITH HER, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO DO IT.
LEADMALE:NO, NO, NO.
LEADFEMALE:THAT -- THAT -- THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.
SUPFEMALE:I'M GONNA ASK HER OUT.
LEADFEMALE:BUT NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO.
SUPMALE:I'LL DO IT BECAUSE DUTY CALLS ME.
LEADFEMALE:I OWE IT TO CARRIE TO SAVE HER FROM HERSELF.
OTHERFEMALE:I'VE GOT TO BE STRONG FOR BOTH OF US.
SUPFEMALE:SHE IS -- IS A SHIP T-THAT HAS LOST HER WAY IN THE NIGHT AND I'M HER LIGHTHOUSE.

OTHERMALE: ALEX.
LEADFEMALE:I THOUGHT YOU WENT TO BED HOURS AGO.
LEADMALE:WHERE COULD SHE BE? I'M TELLING YOU, CARRIE IS HEADED FOR TROUBLE.
SUPFEMALE:SOMEONE HAS GOT TO SHOW HER HOW A PROPER YOUNG LADY SHOULD ACT.
LEADMALE:LET ME GUESS WHO THAT SOMEONE SHOULD BE.
LEADMALE:I HAVE GOT OUR WHOLE DATE PLANNED.
OTHERFEMALE:IT'S GONNA BE A VERY WHOLESOME EVENING.

LEADMALE:AND IF TIME PERMITS, WE'LL GO TO THE ORPHANAGE, PASS OUT LOLLIPOPS.
SUPMALE:ALEX, YOU DON'T GO TO ANY OF THESE PLACES.
SUPMALE:WELL, I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR ME, MOM.
LEADFEMALE:I'M DOING THIS FOR CARRIE.
OTHERMALE:WHY DON'T YOU JUST ADMIT THAT YOU WANT TO GO OUT WITH HER BECAUSE YOU LIKE HER? LIKE HER?  MOM, I AM DOING THIS BECAUSE I'M HER FRIEND.

LEADFEMALE:I MIGHT DROWN.
SUPFEMALE:TELL YOU WHAT -- WE CAN TAKE ONE TOGETHER, AND THEN I CAN SAVE YOU IF YOU START TO DROWN.
LEADFEMALE:C-CARRIE, PLEASE, WILL YOU JUST GO IN AND TAKE YOUR SHOWER? I'D LIKE TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.
LEADMALE: OKAY, OKAY.

OTHERMALE:DON'T YOU WANT TO GET CRAZY WITH ME? YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:I-I MEAN, NO.
SUPFEMALE:NO! NO.
LEADFEMALE:WE CAN'T.
OTHERMALE:WHY NOT? BECAUSE IT DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS NIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:WE CAN HAVE FUN WITHOUT HAVING FUN.
OTHERFEMALE:ALEX, YOU CAN'T TELL ME THIS IS A NORMAL DATE FOR YOU.
LEADFEMALE:THE PURPOSE OF TONIGHT WAS NOT TO HAVE A NORMAL DATE.
LEADMALE:WELL, YOU'VE SUCCEEDED THERE.
OTHERMALE:THIS IS NOT THE ALEX THAT I WANTED TO GO OUT WITH.
LEADFEMALE:MY ALEX MADE ME LAUGH.
LEADMALE:HE MADE ME FEEL SPECIAL.
OTHERFEMALE:AND I COULD MAKE HIM LAUGH AND FEEL SPECIAL.
LEADFEMALE:WHERE IS HE TONIGHT? THAT -- THAT ALEX HAS NO PLACE HERE.
LEADMALE:I'M HERE INSTEAD.
SUPMALE:CARRIE, I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
SUPFEMALE:WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
LEADMALE:I'M TALKING ABOUT THE -- THE WAY YOU ACT, THE -- THE WAY YOU DRESS, THE WAY YOU TALK.
LEADMALE:YOU DON'T ACT LIKE A GIRL SHOULD ACT.
LEADMALE:Y-YOU SHOULD BE MORE LIKE SHERRY? WHAT IS WRONG WITH SHERRY? YOU PUT A BRAIN IN THAT HEAD, YOU GOT A REAL SPECIAL GIRL.
LEADFEMALE:SO THAT'S WHAT TONIGHT WAS ALL ABOUT? YOU WERE TRYING TO SHOW ME HOW TO BE A GOOD LITTLE GIRL? CARRIE, YOU'VE GOT TO SETTLE DOWN BEFORE YOU DO SOME DAMAGE.
LEADMALE:I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE SOME PRIDE, SOME SELF-RESPECT.
LEADMALE:I JUST WANT YOU TO SEE THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.
SUPMALE:YOU'RE RIGHT.
SUPFEMALE:THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.
LEADMALE:AND I'M GOING TO EXERCISE ONE OF THEM RIGHT NOW.
SUPMALE:SEE YOU 'ROUND, ALEX.
SUPMALE:OH, HI, ALEX.
LEADMALE:HI, DAD.
LEADFEMALE:UP KIND OF LATE, AREN'T YOU?  TO BE HONEST, UH, I'M WAITING UP FOR MALLORY.
SUPMALE:I KNOW IT'S OLD-FASHIONED, BUT, UH, EVERY TIME SHE GOES OUT WITH A NEW BOY, I CAN'T HELP WORRYING A LITTLE.
LEADFEMALE:I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
LEADMALE:THAT'S BECAUSE I USUALLY WORRY UPSTAIRS.
LEADMALE:THERE'S A LOT MORE TO WORRY ABOUT WITH GIRLS THAN WITH BOYS, ISN'T THERE? NOT MORE WORRIES -- JUST, UH, DIFFERENT ONES.
SUPMALE:BUT YOU WOULD SAY THAT A GIRL HAS TO BE MORE CAREFUL THAN A GUY? YOU KNOW, WORRY MORE ABOUT HER REPUTATION, HER DEMEANOR, THE WAY SHE ACTS IN PUBLIC.
LEADFEMALE:WHERE'S CARRIE? SHE WALKED OUT ON ME.
LEADMALE:ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS HELP HER, AND THAT'S THE THANKS I GET.
LEADFEMALE:MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE HELPED.
LEADFEMALE:MAYBE SHE'S, UH, HAPPY THE WAY SHE IS.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, MAYBE SHE'S HAPPY WITH IT, BUT I'M NOT.
LEADMALE: I GUESS THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM, ISN'T IT? MM-HMM.
OTHERMALE:WHY AM I DRIVING MYSELF CRAZY? I MEAN, SHE'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.
SUPFEMALE:NOT LIKELY.
LEADFEMALE:I-I GUESS I BETTER JUST FORGET ABOUT HER, HUH? THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
SUPMALE:YEAH.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:IT WOULD.
LEADMALE:THANKS, DAD.
LEADFEMALE:GOOD NIGHT.
LEADMALE:GOOD NIGHT, ALEX.
SUPFEMALE:WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO CHANGE? BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE WITH HER.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL LIKE WHEN CARRIE AND I ARE TOGETHER? I-I FEEL LIKE AN ASTRONAUT WHO NEVER WENT THROUGH THE TRAINING PROGRAM.
SUPFEMALE:I'M OUT THERE IN SOME OTHER WORLD, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FLY THE SHIP.
OTHERFEMALE:WELL, THEN, UH YOU WERE LUCKY TO BE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOES.
LEADMALE:YEAH.
SUPMALE:GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
OTHERFEMALE:I AM LUCKY.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S PRETTY AMAZING OUT THERE.
LEADFEMALE:I KNOW.
LEADFEMALE:I MARRIED AN ASTRONAUT MYSELF.
SUPFEMALE:UH, DAD IF, UH, BOYS AND GIRLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED THE SAME, HOW COME YOU'RE WAITING UP FOR MALLORY? 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY HOME.
LEADMALE:UH, WELL, UH  THINK I'LL FINISH MY WAITING UPSTAIRS.
LEADFEMALE:I JUST WANT TO SAY RIGHT OFF, I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAME BACK.
LEADMALE:I THINK I DO.
LEADFEMALE:YOU WANTED TO TELL ME WHAT A JERK I WAS, H-HOW RUDE I WAS, HOW OBNOXIOUS, PRESUMPTUOUS, MANIPULATIVE.
SUPFEMALE:KEEP GOING.
SUPFEMALE:I THINK YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.
LEADFEMALE:CARRIE, I-I AM SORRY.
LEADMALE:BOY, THIS EVENING REALLY BACKFIRED.
LEADMALE:I WANTED TO REFORM YOU, TO TURN YOU INTO A REAL LADY, AND INSTEAD INSTEAD WHAT? I THINK MAYBE YOU ALREADY ARE A LADY.
LEADMALE:IT'S JUST THAT Y-YOU'RE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LADY FROM THE KIND OF LADY THAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE WORD "LADY.
OTHERMALE:" ALEX, WHAT IF I DECIDED TO BECOME THE GOOD LITTLE GIRL YOU WANT ME TO BE? DO YOU REALLY THINK EITHER OF US WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT? I DON'T KNOW.
LEADFEMALE:CARRIE, WE'RE SO DIFFERENT.
LEADMALE:WHY DO WE LIKE EACH OTHER SO MUCH? BECAUSE WE ARE SO DIFFERENT.
OTHERFEMALE:BECAUSE WE SEE IN EACH OTHER SOMETHING WE DON'T SEE IN OURSELVES.
LEADMALE:AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT, ALEX.
SUPMALE:WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WHAT WE WANT TO DO.
LEADFEMALE: I'M GLAD I ASKED.
LEADFEMALE:WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME TONIGHT? I ALREADY DID.
LEADFEMALE:NO, NO, NO.
SUPFEMALE:I MEAN, AGAIN.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S STILL EARLY.
SUPMALE:I KNOW A REAL ROMANTIC PLACE.
LEADFEMALE:GREAT AMBIENCE.
SUPMALE:SOUNDS NICE.
LEADMALE:
