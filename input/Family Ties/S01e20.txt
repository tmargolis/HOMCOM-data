LEADFEMALE:Elyse, it isn't like you to have such a closed mind.
SUPMALE:I think Dale Lewis would make a good state senator.
SUPMALE:He has some very interesting ideas.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:It's just hard to get excited about someone whose entire campaign revolves around changing the state bird.
LEADFEMALE:What have you got against chickens? I don't think chickens would look good on the state flag.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:But changing the bird is just part of his campaign.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:He also wants a new Ohio state song.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with that? He wants "Oklahoma.
OTHERMALE:" Okay.
SUPMALE:It's not a big issue.
SUPMALE:It just shows he's willing to address himself to even the smallest details.
LEADMALE:I think that's an admirable quality.
LEADFEMALE:It's an admirable quality in a tailor.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like my representatives to address themselves to more important issues.
LEADMALE:Look, if you're so dead set against Lewis, there's no point in your hearing him speak tonight.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just stay home? Maybe I will.
LEADFEMALE:Good for you, mom.
LEADMALE:This Lewis guy is a real clown.
SUPMALE:He wants to cut defense spending.
SUPMALE:He wants to increase welfare spending.
LEADMALE:He supports the era.
SUPFEMALE:The man is an admitted liberal.
LEADMALE:I think you're right not to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Steven, we're gonna be late.
SUPMALE:Uh, Jennifer says I have to babysit tonight.
SUPMALE:Uh, that's right, Mallory, it's your turn.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff asked me to go to the movies with him.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you knew we were going to go out, and you knew it was your turn.
LEADFEMALE:But I couldn't say no.
LEADMALE:You know how insecure Jeff is.
SUPMALE:As it was, he called three times in a phony voice.
SUPMALE:It could be weeks before he asks again.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you let her go? To be honest, I enjoy the solitude.
LEADMALE:I might even write a poem.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, honey, you're still too young to stay alone.
LEADMALE:We'd better get going, or we're gonna be late for the meeting.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:We don't want to miss the opening chorus of "Oklahoma.
LEADMALE:" Bye.
LEADFEMALE: Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
SUPMALE:The answer is no.
SUPMALE:Oh, why can't you stay with her? You're not doing anything tonight.
LEADMALE:That's not the point.
SUPMALE:Mallory, she's your responsibility tonight.
LEADMALE:You got to learn to carry your share of the burden around here.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You stay with her this time.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll do it the next three.
SUPFEMALE:Make it five, you've got a deal.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
SUPMALE:This is doing great things to my self-esteem.
OTHERMALE:I just hope you realize, Mallory, you are shirking your responsibility tonight, not to mention disappointing your little sister.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:My heart goes out to her.
LEADFEMALE:I'd better find something decent to wear.
LEADMALE:Well, kid.
LEADFEMALE:You lucked out.
OTHERFEMALE:You get to spend an evening with me.
SUPMALE:What do you want to do? I think I'll go to bed early.
LEADMALE:Hey, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want to play all star baseball? Nah.
OTHERMALE:Clue? Nah.
SUPMALE:Want me to shave your head? Nah.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you're babysitting me tonight.
LEADMALE:You're responsible for my entertainment.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADMALE:I was saving it for later, but here you go.
LEADFEMALE:"Your personal guide to tax-free municipal bonds"? Enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:So, how are you two getting along? Fine.
LEADMALE:Crummy.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:excitement over here doesn't want to do anything with me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, he'll come around, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you were supposed to sit for me tonight.
LEADFEMALE:It's not gonna be fun with him.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Jen, you can do the same things with Alex that you and I would have done.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? We were supposed to put makeup on each other tonight, remember? No way.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Neil.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on? Oh, tonight? Oh, no, I can't tonight.
OTHERMALE:I'm babysitting my little Really? Uh No, tonight's not good for me.
LEADMALE:Whoa, that's tempting.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, maybe I could Alex.
LEADMALE:Alex.
SUPFEMALE:At the moment, I'd say it's about 50-50.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get back to you.
OTHERMALE:What was it? Another party? No.
LEADMALE:No, not at all.
LEADMALE:It was just a group of fellow young men getting together to chat about world events.
LEADFEMALE:A poker game.
SUPFEMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:And Chuck the fish is gonna be there.
OTHERMALE:He never wins.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mallory, what do you say? How can I get you to stay home tonight? You couldn't.
LEADMALE:We switched tonight, and a deal's a deal.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Alex.
OTHERMALE:So, Jeff.
SUPMALE:You're really going out with Mallory tonight, huh? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Boy, I admire your courage.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? Well, I just wouldn't drive on a night like tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Well, you really want to drive in this weather, Jeff? It's a beautiful night.
LEADMALE:Those are the most dangerous times to drive.
OTHERMALE:All of the people who are afraid to drive in the rain are out there.
LEADMALE:Forget it, Alex.
LEADMALE:We're going.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Maybe he's right.
LEADMALE:I mean Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jen.
SUPFEMALE:I'm real sorry I switched with Alex tonight, but you understand, don't you? Not exactly.
SUPMALE:But I'm sure I will right after puberty.
OTHERMALE:Well, see you later.
LEADFEMALE:You guys have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:So What do you want to do? You want to play cinderella? I seriously doubt it.
SUPFEMALE:Hear me out.
SUPFEMALE:One of us gets dressed up like cinderella, and one of us gets dressed up like the prince.
OTHERMALE:And then we go and see if mom's slippers fit me.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds exciting, but I think I'll pass.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer Let me explain to you the importance of poker in a man's life.
SUPMALE:Alex, you're not going to the game.
SUPMALE:In this industrialized society of ours, there aren't many battles for a man to fight.
LEADFEMALE:There aren't many opportunities to go one-on-one with another man.
SUPMALE:There aren't many tests of one's courage and stamina.
SUPMALE:You know what I mean? Do you want to get mom's slippers, or should I? I've got a better idea.
SUPMALE:Get your coat.
LEADMALE:Alex, you're not throwing me out in the street, are you? I saw "Nicholas nickleby.
LEADMALE:" I know what can happen to kids out there.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jennifer, relax.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to the poker game with me.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be fun.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm not going.
SUPFEMALE:You have no choice.
LEADMALE:Then I'm going.
SUPMALE:I'm just gonna write a note to mom and dad in case they come home early.
LEADMALE:I don't want them to worry about you.
LEADFEMALE:Why would they worry? I'm obviously in good hands.
LEADFEMALE:Kings bet 20 cents.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm in.
LEADMALE:I'm in.
SUPMALE:What are you nuts? Hey.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, knock it off.
SUPMALE:Then let me play.
LEADMALE:I'm bored.
OTHERFEMALE:And you promised I could.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, listen up, guys.
OTHERMALE:Uh, is it all right if my sister plays one hand with us? I dragged her here.
OTHERFEMALE:She's tired.
LEADFEMALE:She's cranky.
LEADMALE:And I think playing just the one hand will mean a lot to her.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I tried, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Doug, it's 45 to you.
LEADFEMALE:I fold.
OTHERMALE:Alex! Jennifer, the guys don't want you to play.
SUPMALE:There's nothing I can do about it.
SUPFEMALE:Neil, do you have any toys she could play with? Toys? Yeah, you know, uh Model cars, a doll, some silly putty.
LEADMALE:I got a toaster.
SUPMALE:Jennifer Neil says you can play with his toaster.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:If he had some bread, it'd be really fun.
LEADMALE:Don't stick a fork in there, kid.
SUPFEMALE:You don't own any forks.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:This isn't a restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't an apartment, either.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, call.
LEADMALE:Your bet, Arnie.
LEADMALE:I call.
SUPFEMALE:I think he's got another king under there.
LEADMALE:He's bluffing.
LEADMALE:Jennifer! Sorry.
SUPMALE:Why don't you, uh, go lie down somewhere? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Toledo.
OTHERFEMALE:You sure know how to make a person feel at home.
OTHERFEMALE:Just leave us alone, please.
SUPFEMALE: I'll go 50 cents.
LEADFEMALE:Neil, are you in or out? I'm in.
SUPMALE:I already put in my money.
LEADMALE:Those are my quarters.
LEADFEMALE: How do you know they're yours? How do you know they're not? I didn't see you put any quarters in there.
LEADFEMALE:Guys, come on! I don't think Neil would lie about 50 cents.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Alex.
LEADMALE:A buck maybe.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in.
SUPMALE:I'm in, too.
SUPMALE:I've got three kings.
LEADMALE:Two pairs.
SUPMALE:Not so fast, Arnie.
LEADMALE:Full house, sevens over Jacks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nice pot.
LEADMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:Hey, Arnie.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be such a poor loser.
LEADMALE:And I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't swear in front of my sister.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Jenn Jennifer? Where's Jennifer, Alex? What are you talking about? She's right over there.

LEADFEMALE:Alex, where is Jennifer? She's With Jeff and Mallory.

SUPMALE:Mallory.

LEADMALE:I got caught up in the moment! I couldn't control myself! Jeff I'm not usually like this, but when I'm around Mallory, I go crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Jeff, calm down! We've got other problems here.
LEADFEMALE:I lost Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you took her to the card game with you.

LEADMALE:Mom and dad came to the card game to get her.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.

LEADMALE:Jeff, thank you for your support.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad you're here.
OTHERFEMALE:Not at all.

LEADMALE:Where's Mallory? She went upstairs to check on Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Everything okay with Jen? Yeah, everything's just fine.

LEADFEMALE:And then, the young kangaroo suckling lives lives in its mother's pouch for many months, until it's able to venture out on its own.
LEADMALE:Uh, I think Mallory knows all that, Steven, and she wants to talk about men and women.

SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Why would we want you to leave? Well, you never seem to want me around, lately.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:That's not true.
SUPFEMALE:It isn't, huh? Is that why you dumped me for Jeff? Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mallory didn't At least she dumped me for a nice guy, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You dumped me for a group of winos.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Alex.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Whose side are you on? On the other hand, Mallory, you hurt me even more.
SUPMALE:I don't expect anything from Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mallory Wait wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean you don't expect anything of me? Are you saying that I neglected you? Alex, the only time you talk to me is when you want me to leave the room, or you need some money.
LEADMALE:Hey, how can you say that? Remember, this morning, I talked to you.
SUPMALE:I talked to you.
SUPFEMALE:I passed you in the hall.
LEADMALE:I said, uh, "hey, how you doing?" I'm touched.
LEADMALE:Look, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if it'll make you feel any better, but we're grounded.
LEADMALE:For how long? Let's put it this way.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll be driving before we will.
LEADMALE:Look, I don't know why you guys are here.
LEADMALE:You don't care about me.
SUPMALE:It's always, "you're too young for this, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:" Or, "we can't go because of you, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:" I'm not a person.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a little sister.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, we don't really treat you like that.
SUPMALE:Yes, you do.
SUPFEMALE:You guys are always so busy.
SUPFEMALE:You never have time for me.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you're busy with your work, your clubs, your school.
OTHERMALE:Mallory, you're busy with your boys and What else do you do? It's just because we're older, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:When you get to be our age, you'll be busy, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never be your age.
SUPMALE:I'll always be younger.
LEADMALE:No matter what I do, you guys will always get to do it first.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's true, Jennifer, but there are a lot of advantages to being the youngest.
SUPFEMALE:Like what? Well, for one thing, Mallory and I have worn mom and dad down.
SUPFEMALE:We've broken them in.
OTHERMALE:We've trained them.
SUPFEMALE:By the time you get to be our age, you'll be running this place.
SUPMALE:That is something to look forward to, but what am I supposed to do between now and then? We'll try and make it more fun for you, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Will you guys let me get in trouble with you more often? Sure we will.
LEADMALE:Will you take all the blame when we do? We always do.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:That's my favorite part of being a little sister.
SUPMALE:You know, Jennifer, uh, when we didn't know where you were, we were really worried about you.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean it? There was a moment there when I realized what it would be like, uh, if you weren't around, and I didn't like the idea.
OTHERFEMALE:For one thing, I'd be stuck here alone with Mallory.
LEADMALE:We love you, Jennifer.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes we forget to say it, but we do.
LEADFEMALE:You too, Alex? Me too.
OTHERFEMALE:Just want to count heads.
SUPMALE:One, two, three.
SUPMALE:All present and accounted for.
LEADFEMALE:Next count will be at 0100 hours.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to do that anymore, dad.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna run away again.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We'll keep her happy.
LEADMALE:We'll make sure she gets out every now and then.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll feed her, keep her clean.
SUPMALE:No child could ask for more.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, at least now we're aware of how Jennifer feels.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe something good has come out of tonight, after all.
LEADFEMALE:That's true.
LEADMALE:Today has been a very positive experience.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, things we've learned Can it, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:You're still in big trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, I know you feel that sometimes you get lost in the shuffle.
LEADMALE:And that's wrong.
LEADMALE:We should watch out for that.
SUPMALE:But even if that happens, please remember that we love you.
SUPMALE:We don't mean to take you for granted.
LEADMALE:If I've taken anyone here for granted in the past six months, I apologize.
OTHERMALE: I accept.
LEADMALE:And and, hey, I'm not totally blameless here.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be so rough on yourself, Alex.
OTHERMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I-i mean it.
LEADMALE:I mean, sometimes I'm not as sensitive to all of you as I could be.
LEADFEMALE:No! No! No! And and sometimes I'm a little too self-centered.
SUPMALE:No! No! No! Well, I'm glad I got that off my chest.
LEADFEMALE:It was a real catharsis, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I'm drained.
OTHERMALE:Well, come on, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:What do you want to do tonight? You name it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm your guy.
OTHERMALE:Do you want to play all star baseball? Nope.

OTHERMALE:I'll go get mommy's slippers.
LEADFEMALE:
