LEADMALE:Freeze! Where do you think you're going? Uh, no place, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:We're just, uh, trying to break in our coats.
LEADMALE:But we were supposed to all be here tonight to share this.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, not another Woodstock slide show where you guys spend the evening trying to spot yourselves among among a sea of long hair and beards.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, we once spotted a blonde speck in that crowd that was definitely your mother.
SUPMALE:That's not what we're doing tonight.
LEADFEMALE:What are we doing tonight? You're helping me make a time capsule for school.
LEADMALE:Oh, that sounds neat what are you gonna put in it? I'm gonna put stuff about our family.
LEADFEMALE:Can you put Alex in there? I could try.
LEADMALE:So if you have any mementos that remind you of growing up, put them in there.
SUPMALE:I, uh, I actually have the first dollar I ever earned.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, and I'll sell it to you for 25 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:You sure you can't put Alex in there? Maybe if we let some of the hot air out of him, he'll fit.
OTHERMALE:So what do you got in here so far, Andy? - I got my baby boots.
OTHERMALE:Oh Yeah, you know, I've got mine bronzed which made it really tough to walk.
LEADFEMALE:Look, our old color slides.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, the slides! - No slides.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you kids loved my slide shows.
SUPMALE:You used to sit there, staring at them, eyes wide open.
SUPMALE:No, Dad, we learned to sleep that way.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe you guys can watch this.
LEADFEMALE:You look ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:Half a million people trying to stop a senseless war.
LEADMALE:You find that ridiculous? I'm talking about the outfits.
OTHERMALE:I'm dying, I'm dying.
LEADMALE:Promise me you'll never show these when my friends are here.
LEADFEMALE:Promise or I'm leaving home right now.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, that was history in the making.
SUPFEMALE:There were people every state in the union at that protest.
LEADMALE:What were you protesting good grooming? Mommy, you look so pretty.
LEADMALE:Like an Indian princess.
LEADFEMALE:That's your father, dear.
LEADMALE:There I am.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:You look almost as pretty as Daddy.
SUPMALE:Daddy, how long ago was that? That was very long ago.
OTHERFEMALE:In a galaxy far, far away.
SUPMALE:All right, who wants to see the Peace Corps slides? You know, this is fun, and it's a great way to clean out my closet.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have room for six pairs of Earth Shoes, a mood ring and a pet rock? Why were you guys always protesting stuff? Well, I think it was just the times.
LEADMALE:There was a lot to be upset about, you know? War, the government.
LEADMALE:Not being able to drag a comb through your hair.
LEADMALE:Don't listen to your brother, Andy.
LEADMALE:If he'd been older, he would've loved the '60s.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, the only way I could've enjoyed the '60s would be if my headband had been too tight, I had lost consciousness and woke up in the '80s.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:I seem to remember your getting involved in a protest or two.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, Andy, and it was for a good cause, too The Equal Rights Amendment.
LEADMALE:Alex? No, it was for a better cause than that.
LEADFEMALE:It was for a girl.
LEADMALE:All right! That's right.
SUPMALE:Sing it! It's important.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you okay? No, not really.
LEADMALE:Look, Deena, I cannot go on with this any longer.
LEADFEMALE:I-I-I'm not really Alex, that was a very courageous thing you did, coming to Dorothy's defense like that.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks, but, uh, listen, about this whole ERA business, this-this this button, this-this shirt it's not Is that a scratch on your ear? Yeah, but it's nothing.
LEADMALE:Oh, those animals.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I don't think I've ever been as attracted to anybody as I am to you right now.
SUPMALE:So, what is it you wanted to tell me? Don't remember.
SUPFEMALE:I think it was a trivia question.
SUPMALE:Isn't this romantic? The two of us in prison together.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I want to think you for coming to my defense.
SUPFEMALE:I'm proud of you.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm very impressed with your passion for the movement.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, Dorothy, it was a privilege to come to your aid.
LEADMALE:I mean, I-I regret I have but one ear to give to the cause.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, when you talk like that, I can barely keep my hands off you.
SUPFEMALE:But-but those are just idle words.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there is a job to be done here.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, there is.
LEADMALE:Right on! You know, and not only by us, but by women everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, tell 'em! How long must we wait? How long are we expected to accept these indignities? How long, Lord? You know, I feel the way President Kennedy must've felt that day at the Berlin wall, when he said, "Today I am a Berliner.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, today in this cell, I say to you, "I am a woman.
SUPFEMALE:" Alex definitely turns up in the most unlikely places.
LEADFEMALE:"His mother put him to bed, and made some chamomile tea, and she gave a dose of it to Peter.
LEADFEMALE:" See? Right there.
LEADMALE:"One tablespoon full to be taken at bedtime.
LEADFEMALE:"But Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail, "who are good little bunnies, had bread and milk and blackberries for supper.
SUPMALE:" There, see? These are blackberries.
SUPFEMALE:Read it again, Mommy.
SUPMALE:Give it a break, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:She read it three times.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, Andy and I love to read together.
LEADMALE:"And then Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Reagan said "'Oh, look, Mommy, "It's Secretary of State It's Secretary of State George Shultz.
OTHERFEMALE:" Boy, Andrew, this I Love Republicans pop-up book was the best purchase I ever made.
OTHERFEMALE:Make Nancy wave again.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What is this word right here? "Impeach.
LEADFEMALE:" Isn't that sweet? It really is.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes I think we're too harsh on Alex.
LEADFEMALE:He-he's not just a callous archconservative Republican.
OTHERMALE:You know, sometimes he can be a warm, loving son and brother.
LEADFEMALE:"I am not a crook.
OTHERMALE:" The one thing you don't want to see, though, is a book in Mallory's hands.
LEADFEMALE:"But I reckon I got to light out "for the territory ahead of the rest because Aunt Sally, "she's gonna adopt me and civilize me and I can't stand it I've been there before.
SUPMALE:" Mal, is that you? What are you doing? I'm reading.
LEADFEMALE:When did you learn how? When I found out that Cosmopolitan magazine was banned in certain places, I became enraged.
LEADFEMALE:Then I saw Huckleberry Finn sitting on the coffee table, and I said to myself, "What better way to show Jennifer my support?" So I picked it up and I started reading and you know what? I love it.
LEADMALE:I love reading I'm gonna teach Nick how to read.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory did a great job of it.
SUPMALE:"The little engine looked at the hill and said, 'I think I can.
SUPFEMALE:"' "I think I can.
LEADMALE:" "I think I can.
LEADMALE:" This is getting pretty exciting, huh? I wonder what happens next? He gets up the hill, Nick.
SUPMALE:I got a few things from my own personal collection.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, that's way too big.
LEADMALE:What's in there, your ego? Andy, I'm gonna give you my favorite baby toy.
LEADFEMALE:She knew how to feather her hair before she even had any.
LEADMALE:And this is the English textbook that I used to help Nick get his high school equivalency diploma.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, you, uh, you were a lot of help.
LEADFEMALE:What is a verb? What does it do in a sentence? Uh, it just kind of sits there, trying not to bother the other words.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Nick.
LEADMALE:A verb is a word that does something active in a sentence, like walk or run or eat.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but, um, eating's not active.
LEADMALE:Unless you eat and run.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you don't have to be moving to be active.
OTHERMALE:You just have to be doing something.
LEADFEMALE:Well what about if you're dead? I mean, you can't be active when you're dead, unless you're a ghost or a vampire.
LEADMALE:Well, you can use verbs for ghosts and vampires.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, just not for ordinary dead people, huh? I'm gonna have to look that up, I think they have special verbs for them.
LEADMALE:You know, this is without a doubt, the most inane and absurd conversation I've ever heard.
LEADMALE:Alex, what are you doing here? What am I do well, I'm not "doing" anything, so I guess I'll need one of those special verbs.
LEADMALE:Like you use for dead people.
LEADFEMALE:Did Nick graduate? Yes, Andy, Nick did graduate What was that, honey? With Alex's help.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
OTHERMALE:And it was no easy feat either, pal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Alex, don't underestimate your sister.
SUPMALE:She's helped quite a few people.
LEADMALE:Remember when she was our little, uh, Ann Landers? I better get started.
SUPFEMALE:Look at all these letters I have already.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh - Oh, hey.
OTHERMALE:You can't actually look, Dad.
LEADMALE:They're confidential.
LEADMALE:Oh, let me look.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess you're family and all, so "Dear Mallory, I need your advice.
LEADMALE:"My partner doesn't satisfy me sexually, and I was wondering" Oh, Dad! My advice is that you don't read that.
LEADFEMALE:Very wise, Dear Mallory.
LEADMALE:Alex, Alex, guess what.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Dear Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I'm adorable Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha.
SUPMALE:No, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm taking over the personal advice column for the Columbus Shopper's Guide.
LEADFEMALE:The column is called "Dear Mallory.
LEADMALE:" No, wait, wait, wait Columbus Shopper's Guide.
OTHERMALE:Isn't that that freebie giveaway thing they have at the checkout counter at the supermarkets, the one with all the coupons in it? That's right.
SUPFEMALE:What are you so excited about, Mal? You're gonna, you're gonna be giving advice to-to lowlife bargain hunters who can't afford to buy a real paper.
SUPFEMALE:But, Alex, they're not lowlife bargain hunters.
LEADMALE:They're people, real people coming to me for advice.
LEADMALE:Mallory, if these people are willing to shell out a quarter, they could turn to Dear Abby.
LEADFEMALE:I can help him.
LEADFEMALE:That was a great job.
OTHERFEMALE:People came to me for help, and I didn't help them one bit, but I had fun.
OTHERMALE:I guess that's all that counts.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, Dad, you-you've messed up on helping people plenty of times.
LEADFEMALE:Like who? Like me, whenever you helped me with my homework.
SUPMALE:I remember a certain philosophy paper that I was doing I don't know, Dad, I have to disagree with you.
LEADMALE:Kierkegaard felt that all knowledge must be self-knowledge.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you're wrong, Jen.
SUPMALE:He was also concerned with the larger societal problems.
SUPMALE:Dad, you're missing the point completely.
LEADMALE:Oh, am I? Kierkegaard believed that examining man's existence within a larger framework of a societal, historical dialectic was the avoidance of subjective knowledge so essential to comprehending any type of spiritual truth.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, go to your room.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, go to your room.
LEADMALE:Now, come on, don't be so hard on your dad.
LEADMALE:He's done a lot around here.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember when he re-wallpapered the kitchen? All by himself, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, Mal, Jennifer, Andrew, everybody! Could you come out for a minute?! There's something I'd like to show you! What, honey? Oh Oh, Steven, it's magnificent! I never really liked this wallpaper, but you made it work.
LEADFEMALE:This is pretty nice, Mr.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPMALE:Maybe you can come over to my house and do my kitchen for me.
LEADMALE:Well, I have to admit I'm really good with my hands.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, there's a certain satisfaction a man gets, a certain satisfaction a man gets from a job well done.
LEADMALE:I think I should do more work around the house.
LEADMALE:I don't think so, Dad.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's that's that's fine no That's fine.
SUPFEMALE:No problem.
SUPMALE:I fully expected that to happen.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Whoa! - Whoa! Hey, hey - Oh! Well, it was beautiful while it lasted.
SUPMALE:Your father's obsessiveness is one of his most charming traits.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you, dear, but I think I've seen you go off the deep end a few times.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you have? Yeah, come on, Mom, he's got you there.
LEADFEMALE:Does the phrase "snake eyes" mean anything to you? All right, all right, all right, don't get into your pet names for each other.
LEADMALE:You know, Andy, there was one time when your mother became a complete compulsive.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I bet you were the prettiest compulsive on the block.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother became a real riverboat gambler.
LEADMALE:All she was missing was the riverboat.
LEADFEMALE:You see, we-we all went to Atlantic City, where your mother was to deliver a lecture at a convention.
LEADFEMALE:Instead, she fell in love with blackjack.
LEADMALE:Who's he? It's a card game, honey.
OTHERMALE:Blackjack's a card game.
LEADMALE:Like "Go Fish"? A little, but when was the last time someone made $2,000 playing "Go Fish"? Mom, I'm hungry.
LEADMALE:Oh, can I get some ice cream? Oh, in a few minutes, honey.
LEADMALE:Your dad and I are gonna play a couple hands of blackjack and then we'll go have a snack.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, Mom, Mom, look, what are you doing? Every second you delay means interest lost on the money we're gonna win.
LEADMALE:Oh, there's Tom Jones! There's Tom Jones! He's coming this way! Here he comes! Good call, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:It looked like him from a distance, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:You want to give it a try? Well, we might as well get it over with.
OTHERMALE:You guys stay behind the rope here and don't get in any trouble.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but only people over 21 in here.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll sit back here.
LEADFEMALE:Your last 21.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think I should do, Elyse? Oh, don't ask me, Steven; I can only think about my speech.
OTHERMALE:Stick.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm? Didn't you read the cards that Alex gave you? Since the deck is rich in tens, you've got to stick, figuring the dealer's four will bust him.
LEADFEMALE:You heard her stick.
OTHERMALE:Oh, whoo! - We won! Come on, let's cash in those chips.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just play one game? - Well, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Guess it'd be silly to come all the way to Atlantic City and not play one hand of blackjack.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Mom, how's it going? Remember, if the dealer has a four, five or six showing, you want to stick on 12.
OTHERMALE:If he's got a three Hit the 13, seven or above, hit the 17.
OTHERFEMALE:It's great to see a mother and son enjoying a common interest.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, see, the dealer has a picture hit.
SUPFEMALE:Stick.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo! - Yay! We win! I got to get in on this.
OTHERMALE:Hi, how you doing? I'm Big Al from Vegas.
OTHERFEMALE:Vinny says hello.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, son, didn't I tell you you weren't allowed in here? Who, Me? No, you've never seen me before.
LEADMALE:I'm just here with my wife and my brother-in-law Nice try, kid.
LEADFEMALE:See you later, hon.
LEADFEMALE:Blackjack! Whoo! On that note, let's call it a day.
LEADMALE:Come on, honey, let's hit the boardwalk.
LEADMALE:Can it, Steven.
SUPMALE:We're not going anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Hit me over here.
OTHERMALE:Stick.
OTHERFEMALE:Hit me over, but be gentle.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, soft 16.
LEADMALE:Hit me again.
LEADMALE:Ooh, stick.
SUPFEMALE:Hit me over here on the end.
OTHERMALE:Stick.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:My pleasure, Elyse.
LEADMALE:The lady wins on all three.
LEADMALE:Whoo! Way to go, Mom.
SUPMALE:Hang in there.
SUPMALE:How ya doing? Nice to see ya.
LEADMALE:You have won quite a bit of money, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we just cash in now? Oh, Steven, everything is under control, baby.
SUPMALE:One more hour, and we are in fat city.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, now, Eddie, I'm doubling my bets.
LEADFEMALE:Be nice to me.
LEADMALE:Mom, can I go backstage and hang around Tom Jones's dressing room? Sure, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Say hi to Tom for me.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I'm really getting hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's ten dollars.
LEADFEMALE:Get yourself some ice cream.
SUPMALE:Mom, I saw this girl in the lobby I think I have enough stuff.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't be silly, Andy.
OTHERFEMALE:The night is young and Keaton memories have just begun.
LEADMALE:You know what, Andy? I think it's time that I pass down to you one of my favorite collections.
LEADFEMALE:Baseball cards? They're better than baseball 
LEADMALE:The Alex Keaton report cards.
LEADFEMALE:Nursery school through college.
LEADFEMALE:You can keep 'em, you can collect 'em, you can trade 'em with your friends.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Alex.
OTHERMALE:I'll treasure 'em.
LEADMALE:You really know how to give that something special, don't you, Alex? Why would you want to save your report cards? Because they're gems.
SUPMALE:I mean, every year, all A's.
SUPFEMALE:Unlike you, Mallory, who spiced up her academic life by getting a Q in math.
LEADMALE:Mal, I think it's great your brother shows such an interest in academics.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, the first day of school is Alex's favorite day of the year.
LEADMALE:Jen, I'm telling you, you're gonna do great in high school.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Jen, what are you worried about? This is Harding High.
LEADFEMALE:This is my alma mater.
LEADMALE:I'm a legend there.
SUPFEMALE:Let me see your schedule.
SUPFEMALE:Little kids.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, first period you got Mr.
SUPMALE:Gibson for English.
OTHERFEMALE:No problem.
SUPFEMALE:He loved me.
LEADMALE:Wrote me a recommendation for college.
LEADFEMALE:Second period, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hentoff for math.
SUPMALE:She wrote me two recommendations for college.
LEADFEMALE:Third period, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Kaufman for science.
SUPMALE:He drove me to college.
OTHERFEMALE:Andy, Andy, let's get to work, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:You got a lot of ground to cover here.
LEADFEMALE:First day of kindergarten, you want to get off to a good start, right? - I'm ready, Alex.
LEADMALE:You know, the first thing your teacher's gonna ask is what you did over the summer.
OTHERMALE:Now, a lot of kids are gonna say, "I went to the zoo" or "I went to the beach," or "I went to a baseball game.
SUPMALE:" What are you gonna say? I watched the Iran-Contra hearings.
OTHERMALE:And? President Reagan doesn't know anything.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't know anything about the scandal, okay? You don't want to be quoted out of context.
SUPFEMALE:See, the great thing about Andy is, whenever I'm talking, the kid is mesmerized.
LEADMALE:He expresses it in a funny way.
SUPFEMALE:Andy? - Hmm? Come on.
LEADMALE:Time for bed, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take him up, Mom.
SUPMALE:Come on, Andy.
SUPMALE:I better stay to oversee the time capsule.
LEADMALE:It's okay, Andy.
OTHERMALE:We'll work on it for you.
SUPMALE:That's what I'm afraid of.
SUPMALE:So now what? Oh, I don't know, maybe mm! this.
LEADMALE:That's great, Merlin.
LEADMALE:Or perhaps this.
LEADMALE:Please, Dad, no magic tricks.
LEADFEMALE:You know what happened the last time.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, Alex, pick a card! Any card.
SUPMALE:Oh, Jennifer, Jennifer, just the person I want to see.
LEADMALE:Get in this box.
SUPMALE:What is this, Daddy Dearest? Come on Steven, we're not gonna put our daughter in a magic box.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, okay, Elyse, then you-you help me.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jen, get in.
SUPFEMALE:That's all right.
SUPMALE:When I next open this box, my daughter Jennifer will be gone.
LEADFEMALE:Come one, come all from far and near, you have seen my daughter dear.
LEADMALE:I will make her disappear.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's-that's very good.
LEADFEMALE:Now-Now bring her back.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:She's gone, she's gone, alack, alack, I will bring my daughter back.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, okay Jennifer? Jennifer, the trick worked.
SUPMALE:You, uh, come out now.
OTHERFEMALE:It's nothing.
SUPMALE:She's really gone.
LEADFEMALE:Can you do that with Mallory? Wha-What's going on here? Where is Jennifer? I don't know.
LEADMALE:That was just the beginning.
OTHERFEMALE:Soon, Dad was completely out of control.
OTHERFEMALE:Poodle! Thanks! My very own poodle.
LEADMALE:What'll it be, Alex a mouse, peacock? Giraffe? - Dad? - Hmm? This has got to stop.
OTHERMALE:What do you mean? Dad Dad, you're a well-educated guy.
LEADMALE:And-and-and most of the time, you're pretty normal, but Dad, you got to face it, you have a problem.
LEADMALE:Alex, it's just a hobby.
SUPMALE:No, no, Dad, Dad, Dad it's an obsession; it's a compulsion.
SUPMALE:You have a compulsion for say it with me you have a compulsion for birthday party tricks.
SUPFEMALE:That's that's right, Dad.
SUPMALE:And it's gotta stop.
LEADFEMALE:The party is over.
SUPMALE:You're right, Alex.
SUPMALE:I need help.
SUPFEMALE:Andy, what are you doing out of bed? I can't sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:The clothes on my chair look like a monster.
SUPMALE:This, uh, this wouldn't by any chance be a ploy to get one of us to read you a bedtime story, would it? No, but the monster's requesting anything but Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Seuss.
SUPMALE:I'll, uh, I'll go.
LEADFEMALE:I speak monster.
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! - Hi.
OTHERMALE:Things were going so well there for a moment.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mal Mal, Mal, Mal, Mal uh, don't you remember? We had a date tonight.
LEADMALE:I got two tickets for the postmodern art exhibition and pie-eating contest.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like quite a full evening.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey, I just got caught up in this Keaton family time capsule that Andy's making for school.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sounds like fun.
LEADFEMALE:Can I play? Sure, Nick.
LEADMALE:Get in.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, we'll let you out when Mallory comes to her senses.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey, don't get in.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, forget it I'll just make my own family time capsule.
LEADMALE:I mean, that is if I did have a family.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Nick, what about your dad? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:I sort of forgot about him.
SUPMALE:I mean, we didn't get together until recently, and that was really weird.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! Hey My God, Elyse, they're speaking Nickanese.
LEADMALE:Look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:You look great! Yeah, you look great, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I don't see what the problem is.
SUPFEMALE:They seem to agree on everything.
LEADMALE:Hey-ey-ey - Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:I think they're summing up now.
SUPMALE:Nick, no matter what happens, you'll always feel like part of this family.
SUPMALE:Stop, Elyse, I'm going to have nightmares.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember when Nick almost became a member of our family? When was that? Oh, honey, don't you remember when we almost got married? Oh, yeah, yeah, that was beautiful.
SUPMALE:We're gathered here today to join you, Erin, and you, Michael, in marriage, which is an honorable institution.
LEADFEMALE:It is the foundation of the home as the home is the foundation of society.
LEADMALE:Oh, sounds serious.
LEADFEMALE:The desire to join together in love with another human being is both noble and courageous.
LEADMALE:Nick, why are you getting married? Because you asked me.
LEADMALE:No, I mean, if I hadn't asked you, would you be here? By myself? Would you have asked me? Ah I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm not sure we're ready.
LEADFEMALE:Then why did you say yes? You know, you're so much smarter about these things than me.
LEADMALE:I mean, you know, I figured since you thought we were ready, we must be ready and I just didn't notice.
LEADMALE:Nick, why doesn't it feel right? We love each other.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Feels like we're breaking the law.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yeah, like our wedding picture's gonna go up on a post office wall.
SUPMALE:Yeah, like you say, we're starting with a couple of strikes against 
LEADMALE:I mean, your parents aren't here, our friends aren't here, this guy doesn't know "Lola" Maybe my parents are right.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we're going too fast.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could slow down a little.
SUPMALE:I mean, we don't have to get married if we don't want to.
OTHERMALE:No, nobody can force us.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, Nick, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not get married.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you and Nick are so romantic.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I've often caught you guys looking into each other's eyes with long meaningful stares.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, Jennifer, those are blinking contests.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Jen, if you're looking for romantic role models, don't go looking at He-Man and She-Ra over here.
OTHERFEMALE:And you happen to have the most romantic person in the world living right here under this roof.
LEADFEMALE:Why, thank you, son.
LEADFEMALE:No, Steven, he meant me.
LEADFEMALE:I beg to differ, darling he meant me.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm the most romantic.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't make me bust your chops.
OTHERFEMALE:I was talking about me.
LEADMALE:I mean, I, uh, I have something of a way about me.
SUPMALE:You may not realize this, but women think of me as something of a Don Juan.
SUPFEMALE:More like a Don Knotts.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Remember when I first started seeing Ellen? And I drove all night? I mean, I drove 400 miles just to see her, to tell her how I felt? Alex? Hey Ellen! What are you doing here? I, uh I, uh You forgot your Newsweek.
SUPFEMALE:I-I-I figured you might want that, so I swung by here.
SUPFEMALE:It was no big deal, really.
LEADMALE:It was seven hours.
LEADMALE:There's a good article on the omelet craze.
SUPMALE:I read someone else's copy on the train.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell you how sorry I am to hear that.
SUPMALE:Uh, Ellen, listen to be honest with you the magazine is not the only reason I came.
SUPFEMALE:Why else? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I, uh, I just had to come.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I was in-in in the car, on my way to the biggest night of my life, and something made me turn the car around.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I knew I missed the dinner and I'd be blowing any shot I had of returning this tux on time.
OTHERMALE:Something made me turn the car around.
SUPMALE:Ellen, uh, you and I are completely different.
SUPFEMALE:You're an artist.
LEADMALE:You write poetry.
SUPMALE:You attend anti-nuclear demonstrations.
LEADMALE:Me I'm an economics major.
OTHERFEMALE:I, uh voted for Reagan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in the Young Executives Club.
SUPMALE:I-I wear a jacket and tie everywhere I go.
LEADMALE:Except for train stations at 3:00 in the morning, in which case, I wear a tuxedo.
LEADMALE:Anyway, the point is, Ellen, that I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why I love you.
