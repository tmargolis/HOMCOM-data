LEADMALE:No, no, see, this color's all wrong for you, Andy.
SUPMALE:You must stay away from green.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not promising anything.
SUPFEMALE:You are a winter person.
LEADMALE:Your colors are gray, blue, navy, azure.
LEADFEMALE:And you must stay away from plaids and avoid large prints whenever possible.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I came in here to eat.
OTHERMALE:Andy, I'm giving you a free color analysis.
LEADMALE:So? I don't even pick out my own clothes.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Is your dad home yet? - Hi, Mom.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Has he called? No, not yet.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Well, your father is down at the Columbus Community Playhouse.
LEADFEMALE:They are considering putting on a play he wrote, and I'm just kind of anxious to see what the decision is.
OTHERMALE:Really? What's it about? Well, it's a very autobiographical story about how we met and fell in love.
SUPFEMALE:There's some very nice moments from the '60s.
LEADMALE:A Draft Card for the Burning by Steven Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:"Oh my diamond in the rough from Buffalo, come let me love you.

OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I've-I've heard that before.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Oh! It's an old memory.
SUPFEMALE:It's an old, old memory.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm-I'm in my crib I'm-I'm tossing, I'm turning It's a nightmare.
LEADFEMALE:It's Dad's play.
OTHERFEMALE:It's alive! There's a chance that the Columbus Community Playhouse is gonna do it.
SUPMALE:They must be stopped.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's nice that it might be produced again.
SUPFEMALE:You mean it's been produced before? Oh, yeah, when we were in college.
OTHERFEMALE:Your father directed and I had the lead the activist-anthropology student Sequoia Free.
LEADMALE: I'm telling you, the '60s were a joke.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, everyone was running around with these cartoon names.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't laugh if I were you.
LEADFEMALE:When you were a little baby, we called you "Moon Muffin.
OTHERFEMALE:" He looks like a little moon muffin, doesn't he? Yeah, well, it could have been worse.
SUPFEMALE:I could have been "Moon Muffin Free.
LEADFEMALE:" I remember you telling us about this play.
LEADMALE:Isn't it the one that almost broke you and Dad up? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It-it did almost break us up.
SUPMALE:Your father's whole personality just changed completely.
SUPMALE:He became insanely jealous about whoever played opposite me.
SUPFEMALE:He became extremely pompous and terribly theatrical.
SUPFEMALE: Yum-da-da, da-da-da, dum! "The Columbus Community Theatre is proud to announce "the Ohio debut of Steven Keaton's A Draft Card for the Burning.
LEADMALE:" Oh! Congratulations.
LEADMALE: Well, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's going to be the first in their "Undiscovered Playwrights of Ohio" series.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to direct it, and, Elyse, I want you to star in it.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's so sweet of you to think of me I can't.
SUPMALE:Why not? It'll be just like the old days.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I'm afraid of.
LEADMALE:I-I know there was a little tension the last time we worked together, but it's all in the past.
OTHERFEMALE:We're so much more mature now.
LEADMALE:Anyway, it's only going to play two days.
LEADMALE:Well, what two days do you have in mind? - Sunday and Monday.
LEADMALE:Oh, heartbreak! I'm not available.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even know which Sunday and Monday.
LEADMALE:Well, it-it doesn't really matter because I've just joined this group "Sundays and Mondays in Ohio.
LEADMALE:" 
LEADFEMALE:Well, um maybe we could move the play nights - to Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Don't do that, because "Sundays and Mondays" might be changing to "Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
LEADMALE:" Well, I'm certainly not going to beg you.
SUPMALE: I'm sure Shakespeare had his rejections.
SUPMALE: Probably not from his wife, but I'll find another leading actress.
OTHERFEMALE:This town must be full of Sequoia Frees.
SUPMALE:"We must turn back the tide of war.

LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Very good.
LEADMALE:Very, very good! - Carol, we'll let you know.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Uh, Steven, I just want you to know that I've done a lot of classic theater from Ibsen to Shaw and back again.
LEADFEMALE:And the role of Sequoia Free in A Draft Card for the Burning is perhaps the most significant role written for a woman since Joan of Arc in Joan of Arc.
SUPMALE:I loved it too, Steve.
SUPMALE:The moment I read it.
SUPMALE:I was in my office, just kicking back, after finishing a root canal.
LEADMALE:I picked it up I picked it up and couldn't put it down.
OTHERFEMALE:It had fire! - It had a - Jeff! Jeff, please! You've already got the part.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I mean it.
LEADFEMALE:It just rolls off the tongue.
LEADMALE:"Kelp of poverty.
LEADMALE:" "Seashells of experience.
LEADFEMALE:" Do you like fish, Steve?  Hey, how's it going? It's tough, Alex.
LEADMALE:Why, Dad having trouble finding any actors for his play? No, it's been tough on me sitting here listening to all this.
LEADMALE:I'm starting to see past lives and envying them.
SUPFEMALE:That tough, huh? Have you read the whole play yet, Alex? No, nobody's read the whole play.
LEADMALE:Not even Dad.
SUPMALE:Why? Have you? I tried, but I, I kept blacking out.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, fine.
LEADMALE:If you just 
LEADMALE:Hey, Pop.
LEADFEMALE:Pop! Nice.
LEADFEMALE:I hear it's going like gangbusters.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, the material's certainly holding up.
LEADFEMALE:The trick is to find actors of the same caliber.
LEADFEMALE:That's gonna be tough, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:All right! Let's, uh, let's get on with it.
SUPMALE:Ready, Alice? - Okey dokey.
LEADFEMALE:Okay - 
LEADFEMALE:Exactly what he did.
LEADFEMALE:I told you he did - Shh.
OTHERMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh! I'm sorry, Steven, I didn't realize your auditions were still going on.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get out of your way.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Stay, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Stay and watch her butcher the dialogue meant to come only from your lips.
LEADFEMALE:Anytime, mon capitan.
LEADMALE:Okay, uh, Jeff, Alice, uh, let's-let's read a little.
LEADFEMALE:Have fun with it, and, um begin.
LEADFEMALE:"We must turn back the tide of war! "Uncover the kelp "of poverty and greed.

LEADMALE: Thank you.
LEADMALE:Yes, all right.
SUPFEMALE: Come again.
LEADFEMALE: Anyone else back there, Jen? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Let me go see.
LEADFEMALE:All right, let's knock it off, then, Jeff.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you know how much I love this? Jeff, you've got the job, I swear! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh!  -  - How'd it go, Dad? Any luck? Rough afternoon, Mal.
SUPMALE:Rough.
LEADMALE:Very discouraging.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:It's still early.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, we're kidding ourselves.
SUPFEMALE:Your mother's the only one who can play Sequoia Free! We might as well not do it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Dad.
OTHERMALE:There's got to be someone else.
SUPMALE:No, no! There's no one! I wrote it for you, only for you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's our it's our life, Elyse, our passion.
LEADMALE:And if you can't find it in your heart to be my Sequoia Free, well, I say forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:Let A Draft Card for the Burning die a proper death.
LEADMALE:Oh, my diamond in the rough from Buffalo come let me love you.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, two performances starting Saturday night.
LEADMALE:You want six tickets? May I ask why? I mean, where? Okay, they'll be held at the door for you.
LEADFEMALE:Six tickets, front row, center.
OTHERFEMALE:That'll be, uh $1.
LEADFEMALE:50.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, six more reservations, Andy.
OTHERMALE:How many does that give us? Eleven.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going, fellow siblings? Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are the Lunts? They're in there rehearsing.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think, Alex? It's Mom's dress for the play.
LEADFEMALE:That's not her dress.
LEADMALE:That's her handkerchief.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, Sequoia Free is a high-spirited, unconventional woman of the '60s.
LEADMALE:This is an extension of her fantasy life.
LEADMALE:Sequoia Free is your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? She does not have a fantasy life.
LEADFEMALE:And she's not going to be wearing this as long as "Alex Free" is alive.
SUPMALE:Elyse! How can you make such a big deal about this? Because already it's getting out of control.
OTHERFEMALE:How can you say that? Steven, maybe you aren't even aware of it, but every time Jeff comes near me, you start acting more like a jealous husband than a director.
SUPMALE:Jeff? You call him Jeff?  Isn't that a little familiar? His name is Dr.
LEADMALE:Cooper.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mom, I'm done.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? - Oh, that's wonderful.
LEADMALE:What's that? Oh, this is for me in the sit-in scene in the second act.
LEADMALE:Why do you need a handkerchief? This isn't a handkerchief, Steven, this is a dress.
SUPMALE:And it reflects the era.
LEADMALE:Elyse, the-the '60s was a time of decorum.
LEADMALE:Of-Of prim and proper behavior, as I remember.
SUPMALE:People wore these, kind of, high-necked dresses.
LEADFEMALE:You know, right up right up to the eyes.
LEADMALE:We're ready in there, Admiral.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Elyse! You gonna wear that? It's no bigger than a handkerchief! Fabulous! Your job's hanging by a thread, Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:I love your dialogue, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:All right! This is the big sit-in scene in the dean's office.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll take it from your speech, Elyse, at the top of page, uh, 311.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Randolph your courage is courageous, outrageous and contagious.
SUPFEMALE:I'm all three of those, Sequoia.
LEADMALE:Let them come.
LEADFEMALE:Let them take us away! At least we'll be together.
LEADMALE: Okay, hold it! What is it, Steve? The kiss was too much! Don't-Don't dwell on it.
SUPMALE:Uh, make it incidental a throwaway.
LEADMALE:What what the well, look at this stage direction, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:"With the heat of love burning in his heart, Randolph sweeps Sequoia into a passionate embrace.
LEADFEMALE:" That's a throwaway? It's a matter of interpretation.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? Hm I think Randolph's worn out.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Too-too tired and emotionally drained to do much more than shake hands with Sequoia.
SUPMALE:I-I-I wouldn't even go that far.
OTHERMALE:Make it a high five.
LEADFEMALE:A high five? That doesn't seem right.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeff, you're a dentist.
LEADMALE:What do you know about art? Your area is pain.
LEADFEMALE:I-I have to agree with Jeff, honey.
LEADMALE:Oh, do you, Sequoia? Well, when-when a man says, uh, "Sequoia, darling, I love you with all my heart.
SUPFEMALE:Come to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm on fire" Well, people expect them to kiss, you know, not-not just give a high five.
SUPMALE:Oh, fine.
SUPFEMALE:Let's just give the people what they expect.
SUPMALE:Let's just give them what they're used to.
LEADMALE:"I love you.
LEADFEMALE:" Kiss.
LEADFEMALE:"I love you.
LEADMALE:" Kiss.
LEADMALE:You've seen it a million times.
LEADFEMALE:"I love you.
LEADFEMALE:" High five.
LEADMALE:Now that's something new something different.
SUPMALE:Look, I'm the director.
LEADFEMALE:I say the kiss does not work.
LEADMALE:Now, let's please get on with it.
LEADMALE:Let's take it from here.
LEADMALE:And, Jeff, please, keep your lips to yourself.
LEADFEMALE: Five minutes, everybody! Five minutes! Four minutes, 55 seconds.
SUPFEMALE:Four, 50.
OTHERMALE:Four, 49.
LEADFEMALE:Ah! Whoa.
LEADMALE:Ah, it's just a play.
SUPMALE:It's just I keep telling myself.
LEADMALE:It's just a play.
SUPFEMALE:Dad? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, well, what do you think of the outfit? Oh, it's a gas! The amazing thing is, this is my own.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you wore that stuff in the '60s? No, this is what I wear now.
LEADMALE:I was really straight in the '60s.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Je - You nervous? - Oh! It's in your hands now, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Yours and and Oscar's and Jeff's.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am I nervous.
LEADMALE:Brings back a lot of memories, doesn't it? - Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:So long ago.
LEADMALE:Our opening night.
LEADFEMALE:Also our closing night.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so glad you decided to do this play.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, you are Sequoia Free.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Now and forever.
SUPMALE:Break a leg, honey.
LEADMALE:Thanks, baby.
OTHERMALE: The Columbus Community Playhouse proudly presents the Midwest premiere of A Draft Card for the Burning by Stephan Micel Keaton.

OTHERMALE:We are not going to budge until you agree to meet us here, in person.
