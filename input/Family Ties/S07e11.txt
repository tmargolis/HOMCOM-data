LEADFEMALE:Can I help you? Can't you see I'm trying to work here? - What is it, honey? -  Well, I'm really struggling, trying to find a new idea for a documentary.
OTHERMALE:It's been two weeks, I haven't come up with anything.
LEADFEMALE:The problem is, honey, you're competing with a lot of your earlier work it's hard to top some of the things you've already done.
LEADMALE:I must admit they were very good.
LEADMALE:"In recognition of excellence for the documentary "The Automatic Milking 
LEADMALE:The Day the Cows Dried Out.
OTHERMALE:" That one made me cry.
LEADMALE:Perhaps my best work.
OTHERMALE:"So You Think You Know Your Hat.
LEADFEMALE:" - Are my friends here yet? - No, not yet, honey, - but I have your milk and cookies all ready.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, hey.
OTHERMALE:Milk and cookies.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, milk.
LEADMALE:Milk, cows.
LEADFEMALE:Milking machines! Don't you oh.
LEADFEMALE: Wait a minute, I've done that.
LEADMALE: I've done it all.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Dad, I think I've got it.
LEADMALE:How about a documentary on teenage sex? As far as you're concerned, there's no such thing as teenage sex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but there is.
LEADMALE:You don't know anything about it either.
OTHERMALE:Okay, how about a documentary about a brilliant young artist? You can use Nick.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you could start in his childhood when aliens replaced his brain with a throw rug.
LEADMALE: I'll get it! They're my friends.
LEADMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Your directions were perfect.
LEADFEMALE:These are my friends, Joseph Simmons and Eva Martin.
LEADMALE:Gee, they're so old.
LEADMALE:Maybe they got left back a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Andy you did tell your parents that we're from the retirement center, didn't you? - Oh!  - Oh! The retirement center! Andy's class visits there every week.
LEADMALE:It's a school project.
LEADMALE:Oh, please, please, - come in, come in, sit down.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:No, welcome.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Steven Keaton, Andy's father.
OTHERFEMALE:It's so nice to meet you.
OTHERFEMALE:This is, uh, my wife Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, excuse me, I feel as though I know the family already.
OTHERMALE:I'll bet that's Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:You're Mallory.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:And you must be Alex.
LEADFEMALE: Alex, you know, everyone at the center is so grateful to you for teaching Andy to fill out our tax returns.
LEADMALE:Who would guess you could deduct prunes? Well, I hope we'll see you again.
SUPFEMALE:Certainly, if Andy will be kind enough to invite us again.
LEADMALE:Mi casa es su casa.
LEADFEMALE:Oh -  - Well, we'll see you later.
SUPMALE:See you later.
LEADFEMALE:Nice meeting you.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Andy really seems to enjoy visiting you at the center.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, Andy's become a very good friend.
SUPMALE:You know, you can't imagine how nice it is to have a lively visitor each week.
LEADMALE: We're running a little low, Andy.
OTHERMALE:I'll go get some more.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, according to Andy, uh, there's so many activities, you hardly have a moment free.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Clark, the director of the center, she believes that seniors should always be kept busy.
LEADMALE:If you're not busy, she'll lecture you until you chase her off with a shuffleboard stick.
SUPMALE:Then she's happy.
LEADMALE: Joseph, you know you enjoy the activities.
SUPFEMALE: - He's shuffleboard champion.
LEADMALE:Yeah, haven't lost a game in four years.
LEADMALE:They're talking about testing for steroids.
LEADFEMALE: Well, it seems like you lead a really full life at the center.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, you know how it is.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing is perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, Eva is perfect.
LEADMALE: 
LEADMALE:Excuse me, but we've done nothing but talk about ourselves since we came in.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, no, don't apologize; it's been very interesting.
SUPMALE:And I think you may have solved a problem for me.
OTHERMALE:How about a documentary about a first grader visiting a retirement center? Oh, I think that's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:No, i-it feels very good, especially since Americans are living so much longer now.
LEADMALE:And I could personalize it by focusing in on you two and your lives.
SUPFEMALE:What did I tell you, Eva? Stick with me, kid, I'll get you in show business.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Joseph! Hi, Eva! Hi, Sam! 
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hello, Andy.
LEADMALE:Hello, Steven.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Sam, this is Steven Keaton.
LEADMALE:He's making a documentary about Andy and all of us people - at the center here.
LEADMALE:How nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And this is, this is Jack McDowell, my cameraman.
SUPFEMALE:Jack is gonna be taking some background footage today.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, Keaton.
OTHERFEMALE:I know your work.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You did the documentary with the hats.
LEADFEMALE: They show that every year.
OTHERFEMALE:That's one of my favorites.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm no film critic, but it seems to me, in a half hour about hats, you could throw in a pair of socks.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton, I'm Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Clark.
LEADMALE:We spoke on the telephone.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Very nice to meet you.
SUPMALE:Yes, we appreciate you giving us permission to tape here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, not at all.
LEADFEMALE:But please remember the conditions.
SUPMALE:Try to keep the noise down, don't interfere with any of the organized activities, and if you overstimulate any of the seniors, I'll have to ask you to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about the over stimulation.
LEADMALE:He did the thing with the hats.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, well, look, uh, here's how I'd like to start.
OTHERFEMALE:Andy, I want you to sit, uh, with Joseph and Eva.
SUPFEMALE:And what am I, an end table? And Sam and I will ask you some questions.
LEADMALE:Very good.
SUPMALE:Okay? - Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Uh, Andy, um, what's it like coming to the retirement center? Well, the first thing I've noticed, everybody's older than me.
SUPMALE:By a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what do you like best about being here? Well, I like it when they tell me stories.
LEADMALE:Joseph, tell the story of how you met Eva.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Andy, you know, when my wife died, I moved in with my son David.
LEADMALE:Well we didn't get along too well, and so eventually we decided that I should move in here to the center.
LEADMALE:I get along with my dad very well.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad! 
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:And then one day we were all sitting around here, you know, just like every other day, then all of a sudden, in walks the most beautiful vision you have ever seen in your life.
LEADMALE:That must have been Eva.
LEADFEMALE: It sure was.
SUPFEMALE:And I noticed Joseph right away, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh And, you know, then I knew right away that I had met the woman that I was gonna marry.
OTHERFEMALE:And someday we will.
LEADFEMALE:Not someday, Eva.
SUPFEMALE:Time goes by too quickly.
LEADMALE:Will you marry me? Did you get that? Joseph my answer is yes.
OTHERFEMALE: Well, I don't believe it! Cut! - Cut! - Wonderful!  Hey, Dad.
SUPMALE:Pretty festive in here.
SUPFEMALE:What's all this? - Well, can't you see, son? - We're in the movies.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Steven Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hey.
LEADFEMALE:WKS.
LEADMALE:David Simmons.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what are you taping here? Well, we're doing a documentary on life here at the center, and, uh, well, we just captured a very, very special moment on tape.
LEADMALE:Well, Joseph, I'm sure you'd like to tell your son.
LEADMALE:Well, David, my boy - What is it, Pop? Well, Eva and I are gonna get married.
LEADMALE:Well, come on, kiss the bride.
LEADMALE:Come on, seriously, Dad, - what's going on? - I I am serious.
LEADMALE:I mean, we've got the honeymoon planned.
LEADMALE:You bet.
SUPFEMALE:They're going to a retirement center in Hawaii.
LEADFEMALE:You are serious about this.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Pop.
LEADMALE:Hmm? Okay, just wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Look, okay, it's crazy.
LEADFEMALE:You two cannot get married.
SUPFEMALE:All right, you're 74 years old.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, too young? No, Dad, now, be realistic.
LEADMALE:You can't get married.
LEADFEMALE:You can't move out of the center.
OTHERMALE:I mean, how are you gonna take care of yourself? I'm not going to take care of myself.
OTHERMALE:I am going to take care of Eva, and Eva is gonna take care of me.
LEADFEMALE:Who's gonna take care of me? David, I'm not going to let anything happen to your father.
LEADFEMALE:Eva with all due respect, I don't think this thing can possibly work out.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to listen to this.
LEADMALE:Let's go, Eva.
SUPMALE:Dad? Jennifer, the water cooler's empty.
LEADMALE:Will you help me with a new bottle? - Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Oh - Here, I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Oh, God, these things are heavy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, maybe we should wait, let Mom do it.
OTHERFEMALE:We can do it.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, we have to take the top off.
LEADFEMALE:I know we have to take the top off.
OTHERMALE:I have to get my hand off -  - Wait, Jennifer, please hold on.
SUPMALE:Here, here.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, my hand's right underneath it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't you can't I can't hold the whole thing by myself.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies you want to hurry up with this, please? I'm thirsty.
LEADMALE:Alex, you could give us a hand, you know.
OTHERMALE:What, are you kidding me? I don't touch this.
LEADMALE:Wait till Mom gets home.
OTHERMALE:Alex! - Alex! All right, all right, all right, - all right, all right.
LEADMALE:All right, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:First we gotta take the top - Take the top off we know.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, all right.
SUPMALE: Thank you.
LEADMALE:Okay, all right, now just bring it around.
OTHERFEMALE:No, wait, you're gonna spill it.
LEADFEMALE: - I-I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm getting it.
LEADMALE:I'm right here.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, we'll, we'll all get it, okay? We'll 
LEADMALE:Hi, kids.
SUPFEMALE:Is your dad home? Uh, he's not in right now; he should be back shortly.
SUPMALE:Care for a drink? Well, no, thanks.
SUPMALE:Do you mind if we wait for him? - No, help yourself.
LEADMALE:No, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:You need some help? - Uh Nah, it's all right.
SUPMALE:No, we got it.
LEADMALE: Well, it's no trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Eva does it all the time.
LEADMALE:Well, we appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:We-we got it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, all right.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE: You're gonna spill it all over me, Mallory! 
SUPFEMALE:Just bring it bring it up.
LEADMALE:Just bring it up.
SUPMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mom, how are you? - Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Mom.
OTHERMALE: Attagirl.
LEADFEMALE:Joseph! Eva! Great to see you! - Getting ready for the big day? - Well, yes, we've actually just been taking a walk.
SUPMALE:And, uh, discussing the wedding plans.
SUPMALE:Oh, you must be so excited.
LEADMALE:I remember what it was like before our wedding.
SUPFEMALE:It must've been very beautiful.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, it was.
SUPMALE:It was outside in Golden Gate Park.
LEADMALE:All our friends were there with guitars and everyone singing.
LEADMALE:Everyone was crying.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, weddings can be very emotional.
LEADMALE:No, it was the tear gas.
SUPMALE:Ou-Our wedding was held in the middle of a protest.
LEADMALE:Was it political? Uh, no, it was her father.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you mean we're having some family problems, too.
LEADMALE:I understand your son David - isn't making this easy for you.
LEADMALE: Well, I don't know what it is.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, why can't he be happy for me? I've tried to talk about it with him, but but somehow we can't communicate.
LEADFEMALE:We were wondering if maybe you could talk to him, Steven.
SUPMALE:Well, Joseph, Eva, I-I'd I'd love to help, but I don't know how I could.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I-I barely know your son.
OTHERMALE:But you can relate to him.
SUPMALE:I mean, you're, you're, you're more his age, and you speak his groovy kind of lingo.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, who can we go to? We're all alone except for the few people we know at the center.
SUPMALE:Please, Steven.
LEADMALE:We could really use some help.
LEADFEMALE:David comes to the center every Thursday to visit.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll try.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try, but I'm not sure what I'm gonna say.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Now we can go on with our walk.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's lovely that you dropped by.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPMALE:Please-please come at any time.
LEADMALE:Good-bye.
SUPMALE:See you Thursday.
LEADMALE:I'll be there.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks a lot.
SUPMALE:You bet.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE: -  What? What-what was that all about? - Well, Joseph and Eva want to get married.
SUPFEMALE: But his son David is adamantly opposed to the idea.
SUPMALE:Ah, well, I'm sure he has his reasons.
SUPMALE:I mean, you know, caring for an elderly parent, that's a that's an awesome responsibility.
LEADFEMALE:How would you know? Oh, come on, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I've given this a lot of thought, you know? And I think that-that children have an obligation to plan for the day when their parents become a burden on society.
LEADMALE:I mean, uh God knows I have.
LEADMALE:Well, that's, uh that's a relief, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother and I were afraid we were going to be set adrift on an ice floe.
LEADMALE:Dad, Mom, I promise you that's a last resort.
LEADMALE:No, when your time comes, I'm gonna make sure you get put into the most comfortable, elegant retirement center available.
SUPMALE:Honey, honey, we're not gonna live in a retirement center.
LEADMALE:We're gonna live with you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then it's the ice floe.
SUPMALE:Joseph, Eva, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello, Steven.
SUPMALE:Hi, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:Where's your camera? - Well, Sam, I'm, uh I'm here to pay a little social call today.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's great, and I got all made-up.
LEADMALE:I didn't notice anything different.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you see what I did with my hair? No.
SUPFEMALE:I parted it on the other side.
SUPMALE:Of the room.
LEADFEMALE: Oh!  - Crazy.
SUPFEMALE: Steve, can I have a word with you? Oh, sure, sure, sure.
SUPFEMALE: - What is it? - Well, first of all, - I want to thank you very much for coming.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
OTHERMALE:And, uh, David is gonna be here soon.
LEADMALE:Well, I just hope I can do some good.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, I'm sure you will be able to, but just if by chance you should run into any kind of a difficulty, I've just, uh, prepared a short list of points you might want to make.
LEADFEMALE:"David, remember when you were seven years old, and I bought you that bicycle?" Thank you, but I, uh I don't think it'll come to this.
LEADMALE: - Hello, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE: Ah, hello, David.
LEADMALE:My, this is a surprise.
LEADFEMALE:Who would have expected you to be here today? What are you talking about? He comes every Thursday.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go part your hair on the other side of the room? All right.
LEADMALE:Uh, I know where I'm not wanted.
LEADMALE:You can cry on my shoulder, Sam.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, sweet potato.
OTHERMALE:Uh, say, David, can I speak to you for a minute? - Yeah, sure.
SUPMALE: Uh look, I-I I realize you have an objection to your father and Eva getting married, but I'd like you to reconsider your position.
SUPFEMALE:Now, from what I can see, wouldn't a marriage make the rest of their golden years more fulfilling and rewarding? Look, yeah, I appreciate your concern, but I don't see how it's any of your business.
LEADFEMALE:David, remember when you were seven, and I bought you that bicycle? Dad, if you have something to say to me, - you want to try saying it yourself? - I have, but you haven't listened.
LEADMALE:I want your blessing on this marriage.
OTHERFEMALE:W-Wait a minute now.
LEADFEMALE:You're old enough.
SUPMALE:You don't need my blessing, so what is it? Why are you so stubborn? Why can't you accept Eva? She's a wonderful woman.
SUPFEMALE:And she's so like your mother.
SUPMALE:No, she's nothing like my mother.
SUPFEMALE:You obviously don't remember Mom.
SUPMALE:You don't want to remember Mom; you want to get married and move on - and forget she ever existed.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so that's what all this is about.
LEADFEMALE:David, don't you know I think of your mother every living day? Don't you think that she'd want me to be happy? Oh  - Um, look, look, may-maybe I should go now.
LEADFEMALE: No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, maybe I should.
SUPMALE:How'd it go? - Oh, he's impossible.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't care anymore.
LEADFEMALE:He is not gonna ruin our happiness.
SUPMALE:We are gonna get married, Eva, and we're gonna get married right here in this center.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe we could fix it up a little.
LEADMALE:Uh throw something over Sam.
OTHERMALE:You do, you lose the whole look of the room.
LEADMALE:I just wish it could be more like family.
LEADFEMALE: Look, Joseph, Eva, I think my family would be honored if you'd consider having the wedding at our house.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Steven, thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE: Andrew, aren't weddings lovely? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Joseph and Eva are the first one in my crowd to get married.
LEADMALE:Oh, Joseph, perfect timing.
LEADMALE:Oh, you got to be kidding.
LEADMALE:I got here an hour ago.
LEADMALE:I've been walking round and round the block.
LEADMALE:I'm a nervous wreck.
LEADMALE:Also, I've got cold feet.
OTHERFEMALE:Cold feet? You aren't having second thoughts, are you? No, my circulation's not too good.
SUPMALE: I-I just took a peek at the bride.
LEADFEMALE:Eva is wearing her grandmother's wedding dress she looks so lovely.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, Joseph, - good to see you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
OTHERMALE:So, my father tells me you're something of a cardplayer.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, I'm nothing special.
LEADMALE:You play? Wha Me? No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to learn, though.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Black Mariah, lowball with a split? One-eyed jacks, kings with the ax?  Hey there.
LEADMALE:I, uh I didn't think you'd come.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, up until a few minutes ago, neither did I.
SUPFEMALE:If you've come here to try to stop me, don't.
LEADMALE:Uh, no.
LEADMALE:No, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I-I th I thought a lot about what you said.
LEADMALE:Dad, you were right.
LEADMALE:Mom would want you to be happy, and-and I do, too.
OTHERFEMALE:And I think that Eva is a wonderful woman.
SUPMALE:So congratulations.
LEADMALE:Thank you, David.
SUPMALE:This means more to me than you will ever know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, listen, if, uh if you can possibly forgive me, I'd love to be your best man.
LEADMALE:There's no better best man in this room.
LEADFEMALE: Yes.
LEADMALE:Mom? The bride's ready.
OTHERMALE:Oh, um Joseph, uh, Eva is ready.
LEADFEMALE:We can, we can start now.
LEADFEMALE:We can start now, all right?  MALLORY 
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, there's one thing I have to ask you before you go down there.
LEADFEMALE:Did anyone talk to you about the wedding night? My mother told me 50 years ago.
LEADMALE:I still think I remember some of the basics.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:  Friends, we are gathered here to witness a very special union, a union that lends credence to the immeasurable power of love.
LEADMALE:Joseph Simmons and Eva Martin will be married here today.
SUPMALE:And now Joseph and Eva would like to express in their own words their feelings at this moment.
LEADMALE:Eva, at a time when most men are only thinking of the life that is behind them, your love and friendship have given me a gift beyond 
SUPFEMALE:A future.
SUPFEMALE:Joseph, before I met you, there were seconds, minutes, hours, but they were only ticks of a clock.
LEADMALE:Now each moment is a precious jewel to be cherished because it'll be shared with you.
LEADMALE: And so, by the power vested in me by the state of Ohio, I pronounce you husband and wife.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to present for the very first time, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:And Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Joseph Simmons.
LEADMALE: Steven, I'm so glad we had the wedding here.
SUPFEMALE:The house just feels full of love.
SUPMALE:You ever seen a more beautiful bride? Only once, Elyse.
SUPMALE:
