LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mom, what are you doing? Taxes.
LEADFEMALE:Got an extension they have to be in next week.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see, that's, uh that's, um  - What? -  Uh, it's nothing.
LEADMALE:It's nothing, Mom.
LEADMALE:It's this is this is cute.
LEADMALE:This it's very cute.
LEADMALE: It's fine.
SUPMALE:Just go ahead.
LEADMALE: Alex, I think Mom is perfectly capable of doing the family taxes.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:I appreciate the words of support.
SUPMALE:Now, why isn't Alex doing 'em, like he usually does? Well, Alex isn't always going to be here.
LEADMALE:Besides, I should be able to do this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Your father can't help because he's got a deadline to meet he has to finish his new documentary on Leo Tolstoy.
SUPMALE:Well, what happened to the one he was doing before? Exotic Pet Stores How Much Is That Armadillo in the Window? He's blocked on that.
LEADFEMALE:So he switched, and I get to do the taxes.
SUPMALE:What? Mom, look, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:This is America, and in America, Americans don't just sit and "do their taxes.
LEADFEMALE:" They go to H&R Block or, uh or me.
SUPMALE:Well, Alex, I don't have to go anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:Our taxes aren't that complicated.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Mom, what I'm telling you is that you are being offered the services of Keaton & Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, because this is America, I support and benefit from many of the government programs our taxes pay for.
LEADMALE:So I am not interested in the Keaton & Keaton "insidious loophole" approach.
LEADFEMALE:Take your hands off Andy's ears.
SUPMALE: All right.
SUPMALE:A good citizen pays all of his or her taxes.
OTHERFEMALE:But at Keaton & Keaton, no one pays taxes.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but no, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Andy, never mind.
SUPMALE:Can't teach an old dog new tricks.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? Oh, I'm sorry, I meant a young dog.
LEADMALE:A puppy.
SUPMALE:Oh, Elyse, I'm really excited about this Tolstoy documentary.
SUPMALE:The whole key to it lies in this book - What? - War and Peace.
SUPMALE:Remember? I was reading this the night you went into labor with Alex - Oh! - This week, I'm gonna pick up where I left off.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven, I remember.
LEADFEMALE:I remember.
SUPFEMALE:You wanted to name 
LEADMALE:Sascha Alexei Keatonovich.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing I grew up so normal.
SUPFEMALE:Don't flatter yourself, Sascha.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mal.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Well, hi, Mal.
SUPMALE:How's your documentary going? Well, I think it's gonna be great.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like you stripped the library bare.
LEADFEMALE: Lucky for me.
SUPMALE: Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Do you want something? Well, I was gonna ask you a question, but it can wait.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mal, if you've got a question, just ask.
LEADMALE:I-I'm sure between the brilliant Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Tolstoy and me, we can come up with an answer.
LEADFEMALE:Can Nick stay here for a week while his apartment's being painted? Nyet.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, please? I mean, Nick really has no place else to go.
LEADMALE:I think we can do this much for Nick.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Dad! I know it's a big favor.
LEADFEMALE:I'm unclear about this did I say yes? Uh, now, look, Mal, um, you've got to explain to Nick that your father's got a lot of work to do on his documentary and Nick's really gonna have to keep out of his way.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, of course, no, you don't have to worry about that.
LEADFEMALE:The Nick I know is a very quiet and private person.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, when we're together, sometimes we we completely forget the other person's there.
LEADFEMALE:One of us has to say to the other "Hey.
LEADMALE:I'm here.
OTHERMALE:" That's one hell of a think tank.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my gosh, I almost forgot! Oh!  Hey.
OTHERMALE:I'm here.
LEADFEMALE: Hey, guys, what's all that stuff for? Well, Nick, he's gonna have to sleep on the couch, so I'm gonna make it comfortable for him.
SUPMALE:Hey, wait a minute, could we get a tax deduction for boarders? 'Fraid not, Mom.
SUPMALE:See, technically, he's not a boarder.
SUPFEMALE:He's a freeloader.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, would you get up? Uh absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, fine.
LEADMALE:Have it your way.
LEADMALE: Mal Mal How's it coming with the taxes, honey? Needn't concern yourself.
LEADMALE: Dad, Mom's not taking full advantage of the new tax laws! Elyse, I'd listen to the couch.
SUPMALE:All right, Alex, that's it! Just get up! Jen, help me with those pillows, okay? No, not that end Nick always likes to sleep with his feet pointing north.
LEADFEMALE:How would you know? How would I know? Uh well, Nick told me.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Nick's like a compass, see? And in fact, if you lay him down with his feet pointing south, he'll turn completely around.
SUPMALE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton, you really ought to change the blades in that razor more often.
LEADMALE:It's an electric razor, Nick.
OTHERFEMALE:Not anymore.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm really tired.
SUPMALE:I think I'm gonna go hit the sack.
SUPMALE:Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, can we point him south? 'Cause I want to see him spin completely around.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going up, too.
SUPMALE:Come on, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Yep, I'm exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go, Mal.
OTHERMALE:I'll be up in a little while, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:No rush.
LEADFEMALE:We'll wait.
LEADMALE:Good night, Nick.
SUPMALE:Night.
SUPMALE:Elyse, I'm not too thrilled with the sleeping arrangements here.
OTHERMALE:We've been sleeping in the same bed for 20 years.
OTHERMALE:Not us.
LEADMALE: Please, Steven, don't be ridiculous.
SUPMALE:Everything's gonna be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Now, can we go to bed? All right, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:We're two mature adults.
SUPMALE:We trust our daughter.
SUPFEMALE: We trust this young man.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go to sleep.
LEADMALE: 
LEADFEMALE:Nick, Nick, wake up.
SUPFEMALE: - We don't have much time.
OTHERFEMALE:My dad's asleep on the landing.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, oh, oh, all right, all right, I'm awake, - Shh! - I'm awake, I'm awake.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go for it in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE: - All right! -   What exactly is going on in here? Aw Mr.

LEADFEMALE:I'm just seconds away from the biggest tax refund in Keaton history.
OTHERMALE:Okay, come on, Keogh deduction plan, do your stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Mama needs a new pair of shoes! How much are we getting back, Mom? - Minus $3,000.
LEADMALE: Oh, my God Don't spend it all in one place, Mom.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, I-I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:It says we we owe $3,000.
SUPMALE:How could we owe $3,000? Guess what I got in the mail? A check for $800.
SUPMALE:Alex did my taxes and this is the refund!  $800? Mallory, that's more than you made.
LEADMALE: Alex, will you take a look at this for me, please? Uh, well, Mom, it looks to me like you've got everything under control, so I'm just gonna shove off, okay? Oh, please, honey.
SUPMALE:Mom, Mom, don't beg, okay? You're much better than Oh, please, I'll be your best friend.

LEADFEMALE:Tea! Mal, can I talk to you about something for a minute? Sure, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Have you noticed a slight tension in this house between me and your dad? No more than usual.

LEADFEMALE:However, his wife, Aunt Louie she loves me.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, I'm a good guy, you know? Your father should like me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Nick, maybe if you stopped whining about whether or not he likes you and just act the way you do around me, he's bound to like you.

LEADFEMALE:Just be patient.

LEADMALE:Okay, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:You don't need me to help you with nothing, huh? Nick, please.
LEADMALE:I have work to do.
SUPFEMALE:You know, you've never really given me a chance.
LEADFEMALE:A chance for what? A chance to show you who I really am.
LEADMALE:I mean, from the minute you met me, you always thought I was this dumb guy with no future who's no good for your daughter.
SUPFEMALE:And now four years later, you think I'm this dumb guy with no future who's no good for your daughter.
LEADMALE:Nick, that's not true.
SUPMALE:I don't think you're dumb.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but you don't think I'm any good for your daughter.
OTHERFEMALE: Look, if Mal wants to talk to me, tell her she can find me down at the Hi-De-Ho Hote.
SUPMALE: Elyse, I've been up all night up all night thinking.
OTHERMALE:I need your opinion.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I've always been nice to Nick, haven't I? Are you crazy? No, I'm serious.
SUPMALE:Come on, Steven, from the moment Nick set foot in this house, you were determined not to like him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so were you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I came around, though.
LEADFEMALE:I learned to like him; I talked to him got to know the real Nick, the true Nick, the inner Nick.
LEADMALE: 
LEADMALE:Aw.
OTHERFEMALE:Steven, once you get to know him, he's really a wonderful guy.
SUPFEMALE:He's very good-hearted, he's sensitive, he's-he's good-looking, he's caring.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, he reminds me a lot of you.
LEADMALE:What?! Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:Just think about it.
SUPFEMALE:Do you remember the first time you came to my parents' house? You-you had this headband on, and the real long hair and-and your ripped jeans.
SUPMALE:God, you scared my mother half to death.
OTHERFEMALE: My father thought you were Cher.
SUPMALE:Look, Elyse, I know what you're getting at here, but it's a completely different situation.
SUPMALE:When I was Nick's age, I was goal-oriented.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I had a career in mind.
SUPMALE:I had a college degree.
LEADFEMALE:That may be true, but there is something you have in common with Nick.
LEADFEMALE:It's the way that you loved and cared for me when you were a young man it's-it's the same way that-that Nick loves and cares for Mallory now.
LEADMALE:That's a real rare thing to find.
SUPFEMALE: Dad, I hope you're happy, making Nick stay at the Hi-De-Ho Hotel.
SUPMALE:You don't understand the impact you have on Nick.
SUPFEMALE:And he really cares a lot what you think of him.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Nick is one of the sweetest guys I know.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'd do anything to have a boyfriend like him.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, go stand in the corner.
OTHERMALE: - 
LEADFEMALE:Oh, um - Hi.
LEADMALE:Uh, I just came by to pick up my toothbrush.
LEADMALE:MALLORY/JENNIFER/
OTHERMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Nick, come in.
SUPFEMALE:Uh make yourself at home.
SUPMALE:What is this, a trap? No, no, I, uh I think we need to talk.
OTHERFEMALE:I, uh I realize I made things pretty unpleasant for you these last few days.
OTHERFEMALE:Years.
SUPFEMALE:When I first met you, you didn't strike me as the sort of young man I wanted for my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:And now? Well when you say "now," do you mean right now?  Look, uh Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, sit down.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I know I am not exactly the kind of guy you wished your daughter had fallen in love with.
SUPFEMALE:But I got to tell you, uh, you know, uh I'm really happy being me.
LEADMALE:I like me.
LEADFEMALE:I would go out and buy me a Coke.
LEADFEMALE:But if you don't like me and if you're never gonna like me, I mean, hey, that's the way it's got to be, you know? But I love your daughter, and I want to be with her for the rest of my life.
SUPFEMALE:And I want you to know that I am gonna take excellent care of her.
LEADMALE:I know you will, Nick.
LEADMALE:And, listen about whether I'm ever gonna like you or not  I like you right now.
LEADFEMALE:You have respect for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:You have respect for my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:I admire that in a man.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE: - Thanks, Dad.
LEADFEMALE: I knew I shouldn't have said anything.
SUPFEMALE:
