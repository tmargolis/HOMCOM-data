OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, that is two! Break another, and we're down to service for one.
LEADMALE:I don't know what's wrong with me tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I seem so nervous.
SUPMALE:Would the fact that it's parents night at school have anything to do with it? It's parents night? At school? Already? Yes, yes, it is, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Your night of nights.

LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:We should be back by 9:30.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I know it's gonna be very hectic there tonight, so if you have to skip seeing my algebra teacher, I'll understand.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, as of yesterday, Mrs.
SUPMALE:stigney She took a vow of silence.
LEADFEMALE:We'll pass notes to each other.
LEADFEMALE:What about you, Alex? Anyone you want us to avoid? Au contraire! You go anywhere you want to go.

LEADMALE:Alex Keaton Good man.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:You must be very proud.
SUPMALE:Alex is the best student in this class.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, that's not saying much.
SUPFEMALE:Half of them think "the hunchback of notre dame" was a football player.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, this is one of his favorite classes.
LEADFEMALE:He talks about you all the time.
LEADFEMALE:No need to butter me up.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't buttering you up.
LEADFEMALE:That was the truth.
LEADFEMALE:My husband and I were very anxious to meet you, but he had to go to my daughter Mallory's algebra class.
LEADMALE:Mallory? I had a student named Mallory Keaton last year.
LEADFEMALE:She's the one.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Which one of your children is adopted? All right, everybody.

LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco, I-i think you owe Mrs.
SUPMALE:binney and everyone else in here an apology.
SUPFEMALE: Yes! Y-you've been terribly rude and insulting to us all.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton, it's clear that your son does not get his intelligence from you.
SUPMALE:If you feel I'm being insulting, fine.
LEADMALE:I won't insult anyone anymore.
LEADMALE:This little get-together is over.
SUPMALE:I'm leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.

SUPMALE:What should we do? All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Don't panic.
LEADMALE:Don't panic.
LEADMALE:Hello? Yeah, just a second.
OTHERFEMALE:It's for you Linda.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:Uh, Linda? I'm gonna take it in the other room.

SUPFEMALE:What happened? I-it's a long story.
LEADMALE:You talked to Mrs.

SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe not every night, but every other night Mallory! We have other, more serious problems right now.
SUPFEMALE:Thank god.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Mom and dad.
LEADMALE:How'd it go? Alex, maybe you'd better sit down.
LEADMALE:I can't sit down.
SUPMALE:I'm too excited.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, did you see Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco? Did you, uh, make an impression on him? Very definitely.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Tell me every detail.
LEADMALE:I don't know exactly how to put this.
LEADMALE:I punched Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco in the mouth.
LEADFEMALE:What did you say? I punched him.
LEADMALE:Um W-when you say "punched," d-do you mean an affectionate little tap, like, uh, "way to go, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco"? I decked him.
LEADMALE:Wow! Wow! Any particular reason? He shoved an elderly lady! That's it?! How old? Alex, your Mr.
SUPMALE:tedesco is a rude, crass, vile human being! I could have told you that! What did you have to hit him for?! He was being so rude and insulting that That hitting him was an automatic reflexive response! I was seized by an uncontrollable impulse! Can't you understand?! No! It was just one of those things.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I-i-I'm sure we can all understand it.
SUPFEMALE:Could you explain it to me one more time, Elyse? Maybe if you showed us how it happened, mom.
OTHERMALE:Alex, you be Mr.
OTHERMALE:tedes Steven, I'm so ashamed of myself Striking another human being.
SUPMALE:Well, look, Elyse, I'm sure that this can all be cleared up cleared up very easily.
LEADMALE:Now, why don't you just call him up and apologize? Good idea, good idea.
LEADMALE:I'll get the number.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is going to be fine.
SUPFEMALE:You just had a bad night, that's all.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Champ.
LEADMALE:That's right, mom.
LEADMALE:And anyways, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco's been asking for it for a long time now.
LEADFEMALE:It's time somebody put him in his place.
SUPMALE:Mallory, I don't want you to interpret this in any way as meaning that I condone violence.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't.
LEADFEMALE:It was a freak occurrence.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Okay, mom.
SUPMALE:Here you go.
SUPFEMALE:Say anything you have to say.
OTHERMALE:But get me that recommendation.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I think I know how to handle this.

LEADFEMALE:She's really sorry.
SUPMALE:We both are.
LEADMALE:I could sue, you know.
SUPMALE:Look, uh, look, l-l-let's let's try to gain some perspective on the situation here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, haven't you ever done something without thinking Something you regretted later? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:I showed up for parents night.
OTHERMALE:Look, look, I know you're upset, and you have every right to be, but you're obviously a very intelligent, civilized person who can recognize this incident for what it is.
LEADFEMALE:An aberration.
LEADMALE:And, uh, I hope you'll forgive and forget.
SUPMALE:Fortunately, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, your son inherited your rational temperament.
OTHERFEMALE:For his sake, I will allow myself to be appeased by your words.
LEADMALE:I am nothing if not civilized.
LEADMALE:Well I can see that.
SUPMALE:Your wife, however, is an Amazon.
LEADFEMALE:Part Irish, part French.
OTHERMALE:No Amazon.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what I mean, Keaton.
LEADMALE:She's primal! Not fully evolved.
LEADMALE:You must have a tough time keeping her in line.
LEADMALE:Tell me Do whips ever enter the picture? I think I'll be going now.
LEADMALE:No, I'm curious What's it like to live with that kind of unbridled she-devil? Goodbye, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:tedesco.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Just one more question.
OTHERMALE:Does she ever, uh? Why, you You're in a good mood, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, why shouldn't I be in a good mood? Right now, dad and Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco are probably shaking hands.
OTHERMALE:They're probably deciding whether or not to go out for a beer.
LEADFEMALE:My problems are over.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, mom, want to go for a few rounds, just for old times' sake? Alex! Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee? Alex, I'm getting angry! Whoa! Kids, she's mad! Hit the deck! Aah! Will you stop it?! Just get the table set for dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, come on, mom.
LEADMALE:It's over now.
LEADMALE:We can laugh about it.
LEADMALE:Can't we? She's not laughing, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
OTHERMALE:What's this? It's a plate.
SUPMALE:It use to be a plate.
OTHERMALE:Now it's art.
SUPFEMALE:There's lots more art in the cupboard, mom.
OTHERMALE:Well, dad, how'd it go? Will he write me the recommendation? Well, we didn't exactly discuss the recommendation.
SUPMALE:Well, what did you talk about? Well, um First, I introduced myself.
SUPMALE:Then, I-i told him how sorry we were.
LEADMALE:I convinced him to forgive and forget.
SUPMALE:Then we made a little bit of small talk, idle chatter.
LEADFEMALE:Then I punched him in the face.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Alex.
SUPMALE:The man is slime.
LEADMALE:Elyse, if you'd heard the things he'd said I can't believe this! I can't let you two out of the house! Alex, that man would have made a killer out of Gandhi.
LEADFEMALE:That man held the key to my future in his hands.
LEADMALE:That that letter of recommendation w-was my passport to the Ivy league, t-to penny loafers, raccoon coats Girls named muffy.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, there's always trade school.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh! How did all this happen, Elyse? For all these years, we've lived by the doctrine of non-violence, of sympathy and love towards our fellow man, peace and Harmony.
LEADMALE:The man is a rodent.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, my geography teacher has been wising off lately.
LEADMALE:Could one of you rough her up a bit? We've got to put a stop to this.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, I know this may sound crazy, but I think we ought to invite Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco to dinner tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:What for? To finish him off? I don't want that man in my home, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Neither do I, Steven, but until we can sit down in peace with him, we'll never be able to sit down in peace with ourselves.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:And I think we owe it to Alex to smooth this thing over.
SUPMALE:Well Now you're talking some sense.
SUPFEMALE:It's settled.
LEADMALE:We'll invite him for dinner tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, you got to help me out tonight.
LEADMALE:We got to keep things in an up mood when Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco comes Happiness, gaiety.
LEADFEMALE:Laugh and giggle as much as possible.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, let's practice, okay? Go ahead laugh.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
OTHERMALE:That's not bad, not bad, but try it with a little more enthusiasm.
OTHERFEMALE:Hee hee hee hee hee.
LEADMALE:Hee hee hee hee hee.
OTHERMALE:Better.
SUPMALE:Okay, look, uh If he starts getting into it with mom and dad, talk about something else, okay? Like Like the weather.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Alex, now, the chicken's in the oven, and the table is set.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, chicken? Chicken? Is that the best you could do, mom? What's wrong with chicken? You do not appease a man with poultry.
OTHERMALE:Beef! We need beef! We're having chicken, Alex.
SUPMALE:Okay, look, I've given some thought a-as to what you might say to Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco.
SUPMALE:"Never has so cruel an attack been perpetrated on so innocent a victim.
LEADFEMALE:" "Would that I could reverse the hands of time, I would.
SUPMALE:I beg your forgiveness with all my heart and soul"? Alex, we're not gonna say these things.
LEADMALE:We had no right to hit him.
LEADFEMALE:We know that.
LEADMALE:But we're not going to beg his forgiveness.
LEADMALE:Begging's out? Afraid so.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not gonna grovel, either.
LEADMALE:No groveling, either? Why are we having the guy over? I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:Please sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Hee hee hee hee hee! Hee hee hee hee hee! I'm glad you could accept our invitation, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course he accepted, mom.
LEADFEMALE:He's a very forgiving man.
LEADFEMALE:Before you sits a human being who thinks and acts on the highest plane imaginable.
SUPMALE:I came for the free dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Hee hee.
LEADMALE:Hee hee.
SUPMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:tedesco, why don't we start with a clean slate here? Now, we're all reasonable, intelligent human beings who have just behaved poorly over the past few days.
LEADMALE:Now, I know my husband and I are sorry for hitting you, and I'm sure that you're sorry for saying the things you said.
SUPMALE:What's for dinner? Chicken.
LEADFEMALE:But before we eat, I was hoping that I had chicken for lunch.
SUPMALE:Mom, there's got to be something else in the fridge.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can go out and eat.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, no, Alex.
LEADMALE:We are staying here.
LEADFEMALE:And we're eating chicken.
LEADFEMALE:I said I had chicken for lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Um They say it might rain.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Rain's good.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's the Mallory I remember.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco Steven! I-I think I need some help in the kitchen With the chicken.
LEADMALE:We'll help too, mom.
LEADMALE:Good! It's a big chicken.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry about that, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:tedesco.
SUPMALE:It's about what I expected.
LEADMALE:Look, uh There's no point in going on with this charade any longer.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna write that letter of recommendation for me, are you? Uh Are you? You know, Keaton This is one of those moments when I prize being a teacher When I can watch a student squirm because I hold his fate in my hands.
LEADFEMALE:You like that, huh? I do.
LEADMALE:I do.
SUPFEMALE:There's something very appealing about Playing god.
OTHERFEMALE:That's how we think of you.
LEADMALE:I love having power.
LEADFEMALE:And it's inspiring to see that you don't abuse it.
SUPMALE:Uh, look I really need that recommendation.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, okay! You've suffered long enough.
LEADMALE:You got the recommendation.
LEADMALE:Uh I-i do? Yeah wrote it the day you asked me for it.
SUPMALE:It's right here.
SUPFEMALE:I don't usually show letters of recommendation to students, but this one's exceptionally well-written, and Well Here you go.
LEADMALE:Ohh! Oh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is beautiful.
LEADMALE:This is beautiful.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:I admit that I thought about not giving you a recommendation.
SUPMALE:Then I realized that wouldn't be fair.
OTHERMALE:It wasn't you that hit me.
OTHERMALE:Uh, no, no, no, it wasn't.
LEADFEMALE:It's not your fault your parents are the way they are.
LEADFEMALE:You know, in fact, considering what your parents are like, you're a remarkable fellow.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Now, when they came into the classroom, I realized that evolution sometimes takes a detour.
OTHERFEMALE:We're all descended from apes, but not quite as directly as you.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco Sorry about flying off the handle earlier.
SUPMALE:My, uh, my wife and I were talking out there, and we reminded each other what this evening is all about and how much it means to this family.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:We're defrosting some steaks.
LEADMALE:Should be ready in about 20 minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Yummy.
LEADMALE:No, mom.
SUPMALE:No steaks tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight We're having chicken.
OTHERMALE:No, Alex, remember? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco had chicken for lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I don't care what Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco had for lunch, and, uh, this is what I think of his recommendation.
OTHERMALE:Alex, what are you doing?! I'm keeping my self-respect.
SUPMALE:I overrated you, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you were better than your parents.
SUPFEMALE:I was wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:tedesco, I-I don't feel like I'm better than my parents.
SUPMALE:As a matter of fact, if I grow up to be as good as they are, I'll be very proud.
LEADFEMALE:How conventionally sweet.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:I think we'd all appreciate it if you left our house now, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco.
LEADMALE:My pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Nice going, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You should've punched him.
SUPFEMALE:No, he shouldn't have.
LEADMALE:I think you handled the situation just right.
LEADMALE:Look, I know it wasn't easy for you guys to invite him over here for dinner tonight, and I know you did it for me.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:The evening didn't end up the way we thought it would, but at least nobody got hit.
SUPMALE:Alex, you're hard to figure.
LEADFEMALE:Right when I think I know you, you go and do something nice.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have the chicken.
LEADFEMALE:
