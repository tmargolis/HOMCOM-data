SUPMALE:We did it.
SUPFEMALE:We won.
SUPMALE: Yay! You know how lucky you are, Andy? Born under Reagan, raised under Bush.
SUPMALE:I mean, with any luck at all, you will have a completely Democrat-free childhood.
LEADMALE:I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What about Dad? He took it really hard.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, you know, what can you say? The man was, uh, completely Dukakis-ized.
LEADMALE:He said you were Bush-whacked.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I feel great! - Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I bet I know why, Jen.
LEADMALE:It's a shopper's sky.
OTHERMALE:Shopper's sky? I knew you'd like that.
SUPMALE:Oh, I didn't realize that another meeting of the Young Republican Gloaters Club was in session.
LEADMALE:Want to sit in? Yeah, Jen.
SUPMALE:Join us.
SUPFEMALE:Just to refresh your memory Bush won.
LEADFEMALE:I'm warning you, Alex, I've had enough of this.
LEADMALE:Read my lips.
LEADMALE:That felt good.
LEADFEMALE:Shopper's sky.
LEADMALE:What? You don't want to know, Mom.
SUPMALE: - What happened to you? We were stride-for-stride there for a while.
LEADMALE:I had to stop.
LEADFEMALE:I got a pain right here, a burning feeling.
LEADMALE:Must've been something I ate.
OTHERMALE:What'd you eat? Just my usual breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Hearty helping of your tofu buckwheat loaf.
SUPFEMALE:Look no further, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE: There it goes again.
SUPMALE:What is that? Does it hurt really bad, Dad? Uh no, Andy, it just hurts a little.
LEADFEMALE:Think about Mickey Mouse.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Works for me.
SUPFEMALE: I don't know what to say, honey the buckwheat was fresh.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:It's it's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, Dad, Jennifer and I really need to go shopping.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, let your dad finish his pain first, dear.
LEADMALE:Well, how long are you gonna be? In just a few more good, sharp stabs, I'll be with you.
OTHERFEMALE: Well, because there's a really big sale going on, and, well, I'm sure you noticed the shopper's sky.
SUPMALE:Yes, I heard the birds singing all about it.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Oh! Don't forget to fill the tank.
SUPMALE:Okay! Feel better, Dad! - Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hope you feel better.
LEADMALE:Take a bath! The tofu was fresh, too, I swear it.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Dad, it may not be the tofu buckwheat loaf after all.
SUPMALE:Although it certainly remains our prime suspect.
LEADFEMALE:No, Dad, my guess is that you're suffering from a little-known malady called Dukakis Separation Anxiety.
LEADFEMALE:Now, there's no known cure for DSA but there is hope.
OTHERFEMALE:Hope that sufferers like yourself will stop clinging rigidly to the Democratic Party.
LEADMALE:Hope that they will join me and millions of other jolly, pain-free Republicans for four more years of joy.
LEADMALE:Do it, Dad.
SUPMALE:Join us.
LEADMALE:Join the Republican Party and hurt no more.
LEADFEMALE:Go away.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Come on, George.
SUPFEMALE: - Hi, Andy.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:I'm telling! I don't care, Andy; enough's enough.
LEADMALE:Alex, come quick! Jen's got George! Freeze, Democrat! Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Frisk her.
LEADMALE:Alex, we all live in this house together.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Not you, missy.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to jail.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, really? And what for? The, uh, the unlicensed dismantling of the Columbus White House.
LEADMALE:Now give me George.
OTHERMALE:Come on, nice and slow, nothing fancy.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Okay, Alex, but I'm throwing out your Ron and Nancy pillowcases.
LEADFEMALE:Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let her out of your sight.
SUPMALE: George.
LEADFEMALE:George, George, George, George, George.
LEADFEMALE: George! Ah! Aren't you glad you listened to me, George? Huh? I told you, lose that high-pitched, squeaky voice, look people straight in the eye, and never, ever mention Pearl Harbor again.
OTHERMALE:And you did it, George.
LEADMALE:You won.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations! Of course, it's not perfect.
SUPMALE:Democrats have the Congress.
LEADMALE:All right, okay, we still have the veto.
SUPFEMALE:And if we want to, George, for the next four years, we can make sure absolutely nothing gets done.
OTHERMALE:Now, George -  Excuse me, Alex, I didn't realize you were in conference.
LEADMALE:Uh that's all right, Dad, we're just, uh, we're just winding down.
OTHERMALE:Oh, look at you, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:You look like you're obviously feeling better.
LEADMALE:Much better, thanks.
LEADMALE:I just, uh, cycled down to Darby Creek Park.
LEADMALE:You know, I think it might have been all that jogging that wasn't working for me.
OTHERFEMALE:All that, all that, uh, you know, pounding may have, uh Shifted the buckwheat?  Very possibly.
OTHERMALE:I hate when that happens.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
OTHERMALE:Well, listen, I think I'm gonna go throw that-that buckwheat loaf out, okay? Um I'll give you a call if I need a hand lifting it.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:   Elyse?  - Well, what'd they say? Mom? - What? What? Well, nothing new.
SUPMALE:He's still being examined.
OTHERMALE:You know, I've had about enough of this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna get something out of them.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:(woman speaking indistinctly over P.
LEADMALE:A.
SUPMALE:System) All right, okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:He's still being examined.
SUPMALE:They They'll let us know, you know.
LEADMALE:What do you think happened, Mom? I mean Oh, honey, we obviously don't know.
LEADFEMALE:But we're just gonna make ourselves crazy if we try to guess.
LEADMALE:Shortness of breath, dizziness, pain.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it could be something he ate.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we've considered that possibility.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Ruth Hobart.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi -Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm Elyse Keaton, - and this is Mallory and Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:My husband had the very same symptoms, and they told me it could very well be food poisoning.
SUPMALE:And? It was a heart attack.
LEADMALE: Oh, Lord.
SUPMALE:We came in from Greenville two days ago, and Tony had surgery yesterday morning.
LEADFEMALE:They said it went okay, but it was tough.
OTHERMALE:His heartbeat wasn't normal.
LEADFEMALE:He had these arrhythmias that's what they called them.
SUPMALE:Anyway, he's in the intensive care unit, and he's doing okay.
LEADMALE:Well, that's good.
SUPMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
SUPMALE:Course, he still thinks it was food poisoning.
LEADFEMALE:He says I've been trying to kill him with my meat loaf for years.
SUPMALE:I know how he feels.
LEADMALE:That's just like with Yeah, well it sounds like things are going in the right direction.
SUPFEMALE:I'd just love to take him home right now, but they say he's gonna be here for a few more days.
LEADFEMALE:I've been sleeping here and changing my clothes in the washroom.
LEADMALE:It's not the Hilton, but I'm not leaving till Tony's ready to go home.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hobart, I'm going down for a sandwich.
SUPMALE:Can I get you anything? No, thank you, Mr.
LEADMALE:Meyers.
LEADMALE:And how about you nice people? - No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:That's Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Meyers.
LEADMALE:His wife had heart surgery; it was a big success.
SUPFEMALE:She's going home soon, and I only hope he doesn't tell her that he and I slept in the same room last night.
LEADMALE:I feel sorry for these people, having to wait around the hospital day after day.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I remember the last time I sat in the hospital.
LEADMALE:Brought Alex in.
LEADMALE:He swallowed a dollar.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know what they 
LEADMALE:"You are what you eat.
SUPMALE:" I remember you said they pumped his stomach and they came up with $11.
SUPFEMALE:35.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if they had left that in there, you know how much I'd be worth right now? 
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Keaton? - Yes, Doctor? - Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's very good that you brought your husband in when you did.
SUPMALE:He had a heart attack.
LEADFEMALE:What? - Oh.
LEADFEMALE: Now, the angiogram shows there is some blockage of the left coronary artery.
OTHERFEMALE:But he's an excellent candidate for bypass surgery, and we're checking his schedule to see how soon we can fit him in.
SUPFEMALE:Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jen, one more game of Chutes and Ladders.
SUPMALE:Please? I can't, Andy, I just can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:I've been down more chutes and up more ladders than anyone my age in America.
LEADFEMALE:You can't poop out now, Jen; Mom's paying you to watch me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't you turn on the TV.
OTHERFEMALE:There's nothing on.
SUPMALE:Maybe there's a ball game.
LEADMALE:There's not.
SUPMALE:I checked.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe there's one of Dad's documentaries.
LEADMALE:There is.
LEADMALE:I checked.
SUPMALE: Ah, the sound of grown-ups.
SUPMALE:We're saved, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:Kiss me.
SUPMALE:Fat chance.
LEADFEMALE: Hi.
SUPFEMALE: Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Dad? Uh Dad's Dad's in the hospital.
SUPMALE:He's gonna he's gonna be staying there for a while.
SUPFEMALE:Did he get lost? - 
SUPFEMALE:No, honey.
SUPMALE:We don't want to scare you; we want to tell you truth, too.
SUPFEMALE:But the thing is, your-your dad had a heart attack, honey.
LEADMALE:What that means, honey, is that his heart, which-which is right here, has a boo-boo in it, and the doctor is gonna fix it, make it better.
LEADMALE:Was it a massive coronary? How do you know about that? I saw a TV show on it.
OTHERFEMALE:Could they operate? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:They do a million of those a week.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, I'm gonna go up and get some of Dad's things together.
LEADFEMALE:Come on up, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you can console me.
SUPFEMALE:This is so hard to believe this would happen to Dad.
SUPMALE:I mean, he did everything right he exercised, he ate right.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, think about what he ate.
OTHERMALE:It's quite a testimonial to sprouts.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm really scared.
SUPMALE:This is dangerous, isn't it?  Yeah, it is.
OTHERMALE:I love him so much.
SUPMALE:We all do.
LEADMALE:We've known him for quite some time.
LEADMALE:But it's such a helpless feeling though.
SUPFEMALE:How could somebody like Dad have a heart attack? Well, Grandpa Jake did have a heart condition.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:He did.
LEADMALE:That means that means I could have one.
LEADMALE:That means any of us could have one.
LEADMALE:Well, women don't get heart attacks nearly as often as men do.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hey, ain't that a kick? I mean, I mean, men, we-we work, we slave and we die.
OTHERFEMALE:And-and you women, you-you just sit back and eat bonbons and collect the insurance.
SUPFEMALE:Well, some insurance policies come with bonbons.
LEADMALE:Oh! All right, okay, you laugh, you laugh.
LEADMALE:It's true.
SUPFEMALE:Men men, we men, we're up every morning crack of dawn.
LEADFEMALE:Job to do, we get it done.
LEADMALE:Close shave, suit and tie, bag lunch and we're out the door.
OTHERFEMALE:"Bye, honey.
LEADMALE:Have a nice day.
LEADMALE:"Oh, no, sweetheart, don't worry about me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be dead soon.
LEADMALE:" We must remember these moments, Mallory.
SUPMALE:We must write them down, because no one will ever believe them.
SUPFEMALE:Where am I going?   -  - Yeah? Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, there's someone to see you.
SUPFEMALE:No more doctors.
SUPMALE: No.
LEADFEMALE:It's me, honey.
LEADMALE:Elyse.
SUPMALE: Oh, Mr Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, please.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you must get back into bed.
LEADFEMALE:He has a bit of a conduct problem.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's nothing new.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you only have a moment; we have a blood test to run.
OTHERFEMALE: More needles? Why don't you just run me through a sewing machine? Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Calm down, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Just-just let them do what they have to do; they're gonna do it anyway.
OTHERMALE:If I could just stick them with a few needles.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, maybe when you're feeling better, you can, uh, sneak up on someone.
LEADFEMALE: Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I really missed you.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone else is out in the waiting room.
LEADMALE:I was the only one they'd let in.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse I think there are a few things we need to discuss.
SUPMALE:I will never serve the buckwheat loaf again.
LEADFEMALE:The key to the safe deposit box I don't want to talk about that.
LEADMALE:I don't want to talk about it either, but this may be our last chance to talk.
LEADMALE:I'm not going in for a haircut here.
SUPMALE:Listen, don't-don't talk like that.
SUPMALE:We are not gonna need a safe deposit key for at least 50 years.
OTHERFEMALE:By which time, we'll be living off Alex anyway.
LEADFEMALE: Look, Elyse Uh I'm worried.
LEADFEMALE:Uh It's possible I  You're gonna live a long time, Steven.
SUPMALE:I want to live a long time.
LEADMALE:I want to live a long time with you.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to be old with you, I want to sit on a porch and rock with you.
OTHERFEMALE:I want that, too.
LEADMALE:And when we die I want us to die together.
LEADMALE:I want us to get real old.
LEADMALE:And then say, "One, two, three, die.
LEADMALE:" That sounds like fun.
LEADFEMALE:I want it to be that way, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:Because I cannot imagine being on this Earth without you.
SUPFEMALE:How 'bout them Browns? I'm not really that interested in sports.
LEADMALE:That so, a young fella like yourself? What are you interested in? Banking.
LEADMALE:How 'bout them interest rates? I feel they're artificially inflated at the moment.
OTHERFEMALE:Due to the rampant fluctuations in the price-earning ratios of certain blue-chip stocks in the industrial quadrant.
LEADMALE:Although, I'm sure you'll agree that the EEC's recent proclamation on the possible reactivation of the gold standard, making petrodollars a more financially lucrative option in this quarter, may help mitigate the crisis brought on by the refinancing of the deutsche mark.
LEADFEMALE:I think the Browns got a shot.
LEADFEMALE: What? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, he's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:He's fine.
LEADMALE:He He's making everyone nuts back there.
LEADFEMALE:I take that as a good sign.
OTHERMALE:Way to go, Dad.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's-that's Dad.
LEADMALE:This is some beautiful family you have, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Reminds me a lot of my own until they grew up, moved out and never call.
LEADFEMALE:Are you the Keatons? - Yes.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Peggy Vincent, - Dr.
SUPMALE:Harrison's secretary.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:And if I may, I'd like to describe - the surgical procedure to you.
OTHERMALE: Well, it's about time.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE: All right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! Grow up.
SUPFEMALE:It's just a heart.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it is.
SUPFEMALE:And this right here is the left coronary artery.
LEADMALE:That's the one that has the blockage.
LEADFEMALE:So what Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Harrison will do is open the chest cavity Uh, is that a must? Yes, it is, dear.
OTHERMALE:That's where the heart is.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the object of the surgery is to bypass this clogged coronary artery -  - With a piece of another artery.
SUPMALE:So what Dr.
SUPMALE:Harrison will do is sew  You don't look very well.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I'm fine, really.
LEADMALE:I'm just, you know, listening quietly here.
OTHERFEMALE:You have my complete undivided attention.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, the doctor is going to sew the new artery into Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton's left coronary artery to develop a flow of blood - around the blocked area, - Right.
OTHERFEMALE:And thereby bring a supply of vital nutrients to the heart.
LEADFEMALE: And that's it.
LEADMALE:Now, the surgery will take place tomorrow morning at 7:00, and the procedure normally takes about five hours.
OTHERFEMALE:So, are there any questions?  DR.
SUPFEMALE: Just breathe normally, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE: Good.
LEADFEMALE:Very good.
LEADMALE:Now, this is a team effort, Steven, and we're gonna need your help here.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You lie down, I'll do the surgery.
SUPFEMALE: I'm all scrubbed up.
OTHERFEMALE:You better let me do it.
OTHERMALE:That's a beautiful family you have out there.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to be seeing them very soon.
LEADMALE:I had a nice chat with your wife.
SUPMALE:She's a lovely woman.
SUPFEMALE:What's her first name? 
SUPMALE:Elyse.
LEADMALE:DR.
LEADFEMALE: That's a beautiful name, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Come on, Steven, tell me.
SUPMALE:There's something on your mind.
SUPMALE:Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm-hmm? I was accepted into the Peace Corps.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:They're sending me to Africa.
LEADFEMALE:Zambezi.
OTHERFEMALE:Your first choice! Good for you.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to come with me.
LEADFEMALE:I want to go.
LEADMALE:Well, I called and asked.
LEADMALE:They can't guarantee that we can go to the same place.
SUPFEMALE:That is, unless we're married.
SUPMALE:Now, I know how we feel about marriage.
OTHERMALE:So unnecessary when the love and the commitment is real.
SUPMALE:And we're so right.
SUPFEMALE:And that's how we feel.
LEADFEMALE:Funny, last night after you left, I was thumbing through this.
SUPMALE:Listen to this it's a quote from Euripides, who was no fool, by the way.
SUPMALE:"Never say that marriage has more joy than pain.
LEADMALE:" Is that saying it?  Says it all.
LEADMALE:It's funny, when I got home last night, I picked up some Shakespeare.
SUPFEMALE:Same subject.
LEADFEMALE:"When daisies pied, and violets blue, "And lady-smocks all silver-white, "And cuckoo-buds of a yellow hue "Do paint the meadows with delight, "The cuckoo then, on every tree, "Mocks married men, for thus sings 
LEADFEMALE:"'Cuckoo! Cuckoo, cuckoo! ' O word of fear, Unpleasing to the married ear.
OTHERMALE:" Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any idea what that means? Absolutely none.
LEADFEMALE:Will you marry me? I want nothing more.
SUPFEMALE: We got a problem here.
OTHERFEMALE:His blood pressure's falling.
LEADMALE:His heart is fibrillating.
LEADMALE:Quick, let's shock him.
LEADFEMALE: - Hurry up.
LEADMALE:We're gonna lose him.
LEADFEMALE:
