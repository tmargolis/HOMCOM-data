SUPFEMALE:Oh, here's an old Eddie Dupre album.
SUPMALE:Eddie Dupre at the Monterey Blues Festival.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:"Perhaps the highlight of the festival was Dupre's classic "rendition of 'Keys to the Highway', in which he showed why many consider him to be the King of the Delta Blues.
LEADFEMALE:" It's hard to believe that such a great musician could just disappear from the music scene.
LEADMALE:None of these guys owned the publishing rights to their song.
SUPFEMALE:They'd come in, make-make a record, uh, get some lunch if they were lucky.
OTHERMALE:Maybe 50 bucks for the day somebody else got rich.
OTHERFEMALE:What about the videos? Didn't they own the rights to those? Mal, Mal, this is before videos.

LEADMALE:No, it's about these "blues" you keep referring to.
LEADFEMALE:What exactly are you blue about? Little lady, personally, I'm not blue about anything.

LEADMALE:Um I mean, it Mr.
LEADMALE:Dupre, it just seems to me that this is a big opportunity.

OTHERMALE:People don't want to hear a bus driver sing the blues.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well uh, we're going to play a song now that Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Dupre recorded in 1943.
LEADFEMALE:It's called "Cornbread and Peas.

LEADFEMALE: Very good! Very good indeed.
SUPMALE:I had no idea we had two such down-home funky hepcats in the Keaton family.
SUPFEMALE:You're right, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:We're cool.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely.
OTHERMALE:Andy has even decided what he's going to be when he grows up.
LEADMALE:Oh, what is that? A bluesman? No, a music publisher.
LEADMALE:Bluesmen don't make money.
LEADMALE:You must understand, Professor Webster See, in my view, your "Pawn Shop Blues" has overtones of the Aeolian cadences in Mahler's "Das Lied von der Erde.
LEADFEMALE:" That's the way I think, too.
SUPFEMALE:You see, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Dupre, you are the absolute epitome of the American spirit.
LEADFEMALE:Professor Webster, you're going to get on my nerves.
OTHERFEMALE:"Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Dupre, you're a living legend.
LEADMALE:"Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Dupre, you're indebted to the blues.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Dupre, you're a national treasure.
LEADMALE:" You caused all this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'm proud of it.
LEADMALE:I just happen to believe that the blues of Eddie Dupre are every bit as important a contribution to American culture as Huckleberry Finn.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go find Huckleberry Finn and hassle him, too? - Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE: Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE: Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mr.
LEADMALE:Dupre.

LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:So we made this for you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.

OTHERMALE:The last time I played before an audience was 1965.
LEADMALE:You wasn't born then.
LEADMALE:And I don't know what Xerox was selling at.
LEADMALE:I've got a good notion to just jump right out that door.
LEADMALE:No, Eddie, listen to me.
SUPMALE:If you don't sing tonight, I will.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton, you fight dirty.
OTHERFEMALE: Evening.
LEADMALE:We, uh we have a very special treat for you tonight.

LEADMALE:This next song is for a special friend of mine.
SUPMALE:If you lose your money Please don't you lose your mind Don't lose your mind If you lose your money Please don't lose your mind Well, if you lose your woman Please, please don't fool with mine Come rain, come sunshine, from the skies From the skies above, blue, blue skies above Let it come rain, come sunshine From the skies, the lonely skies above The blue, blue skies above You know if I'm a fool I'm a fool about the woman I love Yes, I am Walk on, walk on Walk on walk on Walk on, walk on Walk on walk on People, I'm going to keep on walking Until I find my way back home Talk and tell me something.
