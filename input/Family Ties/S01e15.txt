LEADMALE:I can't believe I lied to the FBI.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid we can all say the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Not me.
LEADFEMALE:I had my fingers crossed.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure the court will take that into consideration.
LEADMALE:Look, let's try and examine this logically.
LEADMALE:If uncle ned is innocent, then we really didn't do anything wrong by lying to the FBI.
LEADMALE:If he's guilty, then we're harboring a criminal, and we'll all go to jail.
SUPMALE:Let me start again.
LEADMALE:Probably should have told the FBI the truth.
LEADMALE:No, mom, you did the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle ned's your brother.
LEADFEMALE:You had to protect him.
SUPMALE:I mean, if the FBI were looking for Alex, I'm sure I would Sorry, bad example.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
OTHERMALE:Sorry I missed dinner.
LEADFEMALE:How'd it go? Did Jennifer eat all her vegetables? Ned, the man who was here before was an FBI agent.
LEADFEMALE:Darn it! And I missed him? I'm always out of the house when exciting things happen.
LEADMALE:He said you embezzled $4.
LEADMALE:5 million from the syntram corporation.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:That's a lot of money.
LEADFEMALE:Ned, I think maybe we should talk.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I-i think so, too.
LEADMALE:Uh, kids, why don't you go on up to bed now? I just got my second wind.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I don't want to be in trouble with the FBI and mom and dad.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to stay, if it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:I think Alex should hear this, too.
LEADMALE:So, what did you say to the FBI guy? We told him we hadn't seen you, we didn't know where you were.
SUPMALE:I appreciate that you gave me the benefit of the doubt.
LEADMALE:But we only lied 'cause we knew you wouldn't do something like that.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Did you steal the money, ned? Yes.
LEADMALE:Are you crazy? H-have you absolutely gone out of your mind? You have to understand, I-I didn't steal that money for myself.
LEADMALE:I stole it for those 1,800 people who are going to lose their jobs.
SUPMALE:What were you gonna do, send them each 100,000 bucks for Christmas? I felt as though I had to do something to try to stop this merger.
SUPMALE:So before I left, I, uh I took the hemsdale portfolio, all the corporate records and $4.
LEADMALE:5 million in assets, and I hid it.
OTHERMALE:You hid it? Where? In the computer.
LEADMALE:Nowadays the records, all the money, everything is stored on computer disks.
SUPFEMALE:I simply opened up an account in my own name, with an access code that only I know, and I transferred the hemsdale portfolio into it.
LEADFEMALE:This way that merger cannot go through.
LEADFEMALE:Ned, I respect you quitting the job, but stealing the money and the records is downright stupid.
LEADMALE:And whether that money is stuffed in a computer or in a suitcase, it's still stealing.
LEADFEMALE:I was under the impression that you guys once took a stand against things like injustice and blind corporate greed.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't break the law, ned.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no? Why were you in jail during the Democratic convention of '68? You couldn't get a hotel room? It's not the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it's the same thing.
OTHERMALE:It was just fashionable when you did it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you guys took your stand in the '60s, and I respect you for it.
OTHERMALE:And two days ago, I was on the verge of seeing my work, my education, my entire life up to this point come to harvest in the senseless firing of 1,800 people.
LEADMALE:And I took my stand, damn it! You don't have to worry.
LEADFEMALE:I won't involve you in this anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be gone in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:I stopped by your room to talk.
SUPFEMALE:You weren't there.
LEADMALE:I was here.
LEADFEMALE:So I see.
LEADMALE:You were pretty quiet earlier.
LEADMALE:How could you do it, uncle ned? There was no other way to save those jobs.
LEADFEMALE:There had to be another way.
SUPMALE:Maybe you could have done something to create new jobs for those people.
LEADMALE:Like what? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe you could have hired them to help out around your apartment, clean up, stuff like that.
SUPFEMALE:They could take shifts.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I think you're missing the point here.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't understand, uncle ned.
LEADMALE:I thought you loved the business world.
LEADFEMALE:It's exciting, right? Isn't it exciting? Knowing when to buy short and when to sell long.
LEADMALE:When to play hardball and when to use soft soap.
SUPFEMALE:When to lick your wounds and when to bite your bullet.
LEADMALE:Usually you lick your wounds after you bite your bullet.
LEADMALE:See? You know all this stuff.
LEADMALE:Alex, I admit, it was very exciting.
SUPMALE:But in the final analysis, I just didn't have the stomach for it.
LEADMALE:I began to realize there is something very wrong built into the whole corporate structure.
LEADFEMALE:Bite your tongue.
SUPMALE:The survival of a corporation hinges on one thing Its ability to increase profits.
OTHERMALE:You know that.
LEADFEMALE:If little trivial things like ethics and concern for the public good get in the way, they get pushed aside.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle ned, I agree that the hemsdale merger was a pretty sleazy deal.
SUPFEMALE:But you've got to weigh the good with the bad on the scales of injustice.
LEADFEMALE:Let's say this bowl is the 1,800 workers and, uh, this banana represents syntram's corporate health.
LEADMALE:So they're equally important.
OTHERMALE:But, Alex, those people are going to be collecting unemployment, which is a drain on the federal reserve.
LEADFEMALE:In addition, there's the lost revenue to all the smaller businesses that dealt with hemsdale.
SUPFEMALE:Finally, and most important of all, there's the human factor, the intangibles.
LEADFEMALE:Syntram's corporate health is an illusion that is easily stripped away.
OTHERMALE:So you see, when you take all of these factors into consideration, the implementation of this merger is not congruent with the public good.
OTHERMALE:I rest my case.
OTHERMALE:What are you gonna do, uncle ned? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Look for something simple Cottage in the country, swing on the old oak tree, white picket fence.
LEADMALE:Will you marry me, Alex? I don't know what I'm gonna do.
LEADFEMALE:Steven! Aah! Get the kids! Did I wake you? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Am I awake? I've been up all night worrying.
SUPFEMALE:About the FBI? No, about Joey la grande's baseball mitt.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, honey, I can underst Who the hell is Joey la grande? He was a bully who used to push ned around when we were kids.
LEADMALE:Well, one day, ned got fed up, and he stole Joey la grande's baseball mitt.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:The FBI will probably come looking for that, too.
OTHERFEMALE:I told ned that no matter what Joey had done, stealing the mitt was wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Well, ned said he knew that, but he was scared to give it back.
SUPFEMALE:So I took ned to Joey's house, and I stood beside him while he gave the mitt back to Joey.
LEADMALE:That's fascinating, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see? I helped ned.
LEADMALE:I protected him 'cause he was my little brother and he needed me.
LEADFEMALE:He's still my little brother.
LEADMALE:I think we ought to let him stay here, and I'm gonna go tell him that, okay? No, I don't think it's okay.
SUPMALE:Now, look, I love your brother, and I'm worried about him, too, but he can't stay here.
LEADMALE:Why not? Elyse, he didn't just steal a baseball mitt this time.
LEADMALE:He's scared, Steven.
LEADMALE:That's why he came here.
LEADMALE:We can't turn him away now.
LEADMALE:The stakes are too high.
LEADMALE:Ned is not a child, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, he is.
SUPFEMALE:In many ways, he's still a child.
LEADMALE:That's because you treat him like one! You can't keep bailing him out every time he gets into trouble.
LEADMALE:H-he's committed a crime, and we can't be a party to that.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I think maybe ned was right.
LEADMALE:Maybe we are hypocrites.
SUPMALE:What? When ned told us what he'd done, we immediately condemned him for it.
LEADMALE:There was a point in our lives where we would've applauded what he did.
LEADMALE:What ned did was not simply a protest.
LEADFEMALE:It was one man taking the law into his own hands because he thinks he's right.
LEADMALE:That's nothing I can applaud! Hello? It's Mrs.
LEADMALE:obeck next door.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mrs.
LEADMALE:obeck.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:obeck, I'm sorry if we were making too much noise.
OTHERFEMALE:W-what's that? Ned is Elyse's brother.
LEADMALE:No, he is not going to stay here.
SUPMALE:Yes, I know Elyse made a good point.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:obeck, if you don't mind, this is a private matter.
LEADMALE:Good good night.
LEADFEMALE:She always takes your side.
OTHERMALE:Elyse, we shouldn't be fighting.
LEADFEMALE:I know how you feel about ned, but this is his battle.
LEADMALE:You can't protect him forever.
LEADFEMALE:Did you guys hear that? I think somebody's stealing the car.
LEADMALE:I heard it, too.
OTHERFEMALE:See if ned's in his room.
SUPMALE:What do you think the odds are that ned is in his room, Elyse? Uncle ned's gone.
LEADFEMALE:Alex is gone, too.
SUPFEMALE:Alex? Just a minute.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE: Attention, please.
LEADMALE:Flight 437 to Miami beach will be delayed for 30 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You got me here safely.
SUPMALE:Now I want you to go home.
SUPMALE:In case anything goes wrong, I don't want you involved.
LEADMALE:Uncle ned, I may not agree with what you did.
SUPMALE:I may not even understand it.
OTHERFEMALE:But you're my uncle, and I care about you, and I want to help.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I will be fine by myself.
LEADMALE:No, you won't.
SUPMALE:It's not even safe for you to talk to anyone.
SUPMALE:This place could be crawling with FBI agents.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Do you know where gate 27 is? Uh, he doesn't speak English.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, then maybe you know where it is.
LEADFEMALE:I don't speak English, either.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Smooth, Alex.
SUPMALE:The trick is to be inconspicuous.
LEADFEMALE:Just act natural.
OTHERFEMALE:Be cool, collected.
LEADFEMALE:Under no circumstances panic.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Ned! Uncle ned, why don't you just sit over here and I'll go and buy your ticket? Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:How's it going? Pretty good.
SUPMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Do you want something? Nah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, there is one thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I need an airline ticket.
SUPMALE:What a break.
LEADMALE:I happen to sell airline tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you want to go? What do you mean? I think the question is self-explanatory.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I haven't really decided yet.
LEADFEMALE:Let me just step back and look at the big board and see what strikes my fancy.
LEADMALE:Where do you want to go? Seattle.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:The next flight leaves in one hour.
LEADMALE:Name, please.
LEADFEMALE:Alex Keaton.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Not Alex Keaton.
LEADMALE:Not Alex Keaton? No.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Ned Donnelly.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:Uh, not Not ned Donnelly.
OTHERMALE:My name is definitely not ned Donnelly.
SUPFEMALE:You had less trouble picking a city.
SUPFEMALE:Look, kid, relatively speaking, this is one of life's easier questions.
OTHERMALE:What's your name? Alfredo Gomez.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure? Hey, I ought to know my own name.
LEADMALE:I should have guessed it.
LEADMALE:It's written all over your face.
LEADMALE:SeÃ±or.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Gomez.
LEADMALE:Cash or charge? Cash or charge? Cash or charge? Let me think.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be glad to wait while you go ask.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Carlyle! Hello, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Small world, isn't it? Round, too.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? Where? Here.
LEADMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, here.
OTHERFEMALE:What am I doing here? I, uh I come here a lot.
LEADMALE:Oh, you do? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I like airports.
SUPMALE:I like to pretend that I'm going somewhere.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Gomez, do you want smoking or nonsmoking? Are you talk Are you talking to me? SÃ­.
LEADFEMALE:My name is not Gomez.
SUPFEMALE:Do you want to go back to one of your old names? Or do you have a new one for me? This guy's crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Cut the charade, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I followed you here from your house.
OTHERMALE:Boy, that traffic was something, wasn't it? Look, Alex, you're Look, al Look, Alex, you're a good kid.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm going to have to arrest uncle ned.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want you to be involved.
SUPFEMALE:Go home, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Carlyle.
SUPMALE:Please, don't arrest uncle ned.
SUPMALE:He had a good reason.
OTHERFEMALE:Just let him explain.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Aah! Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, what were you thinking? I wasn't thinking.
LEADMALE:I was trying to help uncle ned.
SUPMALE:I feel so bad for uncle ned.
LEADFEMALE: All right.
LEADMALE:All right, come on.
LEADMALE:We're not gonna solve anything by standing around and worrying.
SUPFEMALE:You've got to get to school.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to get to work.
SUPMALE:We're all gonna look pretty silly unless we get dressed first.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Ned! Your tea's ready.
LEADMALE:Are you all right? Why are you here? Fine, and I don't know.
LEADMALE:I was worried about Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Did he make it back okay? Yeah, Alex is fine.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:They're looking for me at the airport now.
LEADMALE:If it's okay, I'd like to hide out here until I can think of something else.
LEADMALE:Just a night or two, all right? No.
SUPFEMALE:That's not all right.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? I think you should turn yourself in.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, ned, but I-i can't bail you out this time.
LEADMALE:Are you implying that there have been other times when you've had to "bail me out"? Do you want a list? Name one, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:The time you took dad's car without permission.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Kids do that kind of stuff all the time.
LEADFEMALE:You left him in Cleveland.
LEADMALE:He had bus fare.
SUPMALE:Maybe this isn't all your fault.
LEADFEMALE:I know I coddled you and I always tried to make things right for you.
SUPMALE:But I've got to say no to you sometime.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Elyse, come on, I mean, what's a couple of days? You won't even know I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't understand this, do you? You don't need a big sister anymore.
SUPMALE:You need a lawyer.
SUPFEMALE:I begged you to go to law school.
LEADFEMALE:This is not a game.
SUPFEMALE:You are not a kid anymore.
SUPMALE:For god's sakes, will you please grow up? 
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:Uncle ned.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, Gomez.
OTHERFEMALE:Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡? Listen, Carlyle is back, and there's another guy with him.
LEADFEMALE:Just give me 10 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Ned! That's all the head start I need.
LEADMALE:No, I'm sorry, but you're going to have to take my word for it.
LEADFEMALE:He's not up there.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Then where is he? Who are you? Elyse, this is Mr.
LEADMALE:Peterson.
LEADFEMALE:He is the president of the syntram corporation.
LEADMALE:And, uh You know Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Carlyle.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to see you all again.
LEADMALE:All right, enough chatting.
LEADFEMALE:Where is he? I presume you're referring to my brother.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I'm looking for the pope.
LEADMALE:Did you try Rome? Or maybe he's touring somewhere.
LEADMALE:That wasn't funny, kid.
LEADMALE:You watch how you speak to my daughter, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Peterson.
OTHERMALE:That's telling him, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:Carlyle, this is supposed to be an arrest! That doesn't mean it can't be pleasant.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we know ned's here.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I had Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Peterson fly in.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Carlyle, I'm sorry we lied to you yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:To be honest, we were very scared.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm telling you the truth when I say now that ned is not here.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Look who's here.
SUPFEMALE:What a pleasant surprise.
LEADFEMALE:It's, uh, ned.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, rob.
LEADFEMALE:Just passing through? No, I came to have you arrested, ned.
LEADMALE:That was my next guess.
SUPFEMALE:All right, look, ned, here's the deal.
LEADFEMALE:If you issue a formal apology and give us that computer access number, we may be willing to reduce some of the charges against you.
OTHERFEMALE:Rob, I'm turning myself in, but I don't plan to reveal that code.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, don't be a fool.
LEADMALE:You know as well as I do that computer can be programmed to crack that code all by itself.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's true.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you probably also know that it'll take about 8.
SUPFEMALE:7 years.
OTHERMALE:But, uh, I'm willing to wait if you are.
LEADMALE:I'll see you in the car, ned.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you really blew it.
LEADFEMALE:You had such a big future at syntram.
LEADMALE:Why, in 15 years, you could've been running the whole place.
LEADMALE:How long you figure it'll take me now? Okay, ned.
OTHERMALE:Get your things.
LEADMALE:We're going downtown.
LEADFEMALE:I've always wanted to say that.
OTHERFEMALE:What made you stop and come back? I tripped over Jennifer's baseball mitt.
LEADFEMALE:I think I tore some ligaments.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, uncle ned.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I'm glad it happened.
SUPFEMALE:As I was lying there on the edge of the front lawn, writhing in pain, desperately trying to flag down a ride, uh, I thought about something.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, I thought about Cleveland and dad and about that time, Elyse, when I stole Joey la grande's baseball mitt.
SUPFEMALE:And you took me back to his house and made me give it back to him.
SUPMALE:And then you beat the hell out of him.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't tell me that part.
LEADFEMALE:It was a long time ago.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse, I didn't want to give Joey his baseball mitt back then, and I certainly don't want to go back to New York now.
LEADMALE:But, uh, if I'm gonna be fighting these battles, I should at least do it in person.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, monkey-face.
LEADMALE:I want you to remember one thing.
LEADFEMALE:What? Never swing at curve balls on the outside corner.
LEADMALE:I won't.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, uncle ned.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, remember, when all else fails, "x" equals 8.
LEADFEMALE:I'll try not to forget.
LEADMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Big business can be exciting and challenging.
SUPFEMALE:But don't put blinders on.
LEADFEMALE:Always remember the things that are really important.
SUPMALE:Two secretaries, huh? Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks for putting up with me, Steve.
LEADMALE:I know it's been rough.
LEADMALE:Well, hey, sometimes it's rough, but it's never dull.
OTHERMALE:Who knows, Elyse? I may just grow up yet.
SUPMALE:I think maybe you already have.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, ned.
SUPMALE:I love you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Take care of yourself, Mr.
SUPMALE:Carlyle.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, ned.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute! I'm just testing.
SUPFEMALE:
