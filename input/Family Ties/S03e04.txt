LEADMALE:What do you got there, Dad? Well, I've got a teddy bear, two rattles, a cuddle bunny, and a little ducky.
LEADMALE:Well, you can play for five minutes, and then you got to go night-night.
SUPMALE:Alex, we're just trying to get an inventory of the baby toys we have so, uh, we'll know what we need to buy.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, what's that, Dad? This is the mobile that used to hang over your crib.
LEADMALE:I remember we experimented with a lot of different things until we found the one symbol that would calm you down.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, t-turn it on, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Turn it on.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:MAN Continental Telegraph up three points.
LEADMALE:It's up to 25 cents.
SUPFEMALE:Cintram Corporation, down 14.
LEADFEMALE:Still works.
LEADMALE:Oh, and when you've finished your nap, uh, take a look through that catalog there.
LEADFEMALE:We're trying to pick out a new crib.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Dad.
LEADMALE:What do I know about cribs? A crib is a crib.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with this one here, The Inky-Binky-Beddy-Bye? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:That one, uh, scares me a little.
SUPFEMALE:The Inky-Bink looks like a bear to put together.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:More food for Mom? I know.
LEADMALE:It's getting ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:This is the fourth meal Mom's eaten in two hours.
SUPFEMALE:Try to be a little more understanding, Mal.
SUPMALE:She's an energetic person.
LEADFEMALE:Now that the doctor wants her to stay off her feet, she's channeling all her energies, uh, into eating.
SUPFEMALE:Is Scott here yet? No, Jen.
SUPMALE:We told you we'd call you when he gets here.
LEADMALE:Uh, coming! That's Mom again.
LEADMALE:She's getting a little demanding now.
SUPFEMALE:You better hurry up and take that to her.
LEADMALE:You don't want to miss Scott when he gets here.
SUPFEMALE:What's the big deal? He was your goofy friend, not mine.
SUPFEMALE:He wasn't goofy, Mallory.
LEADMALE:He just had glasses and braces and big ears.
LEADMALE:Well, then, I'll hurry back down.
SUPMALE:What's all this? This is equipment from all the different sports Scott and I used to play together.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd let him pick which one he wants to start with.
LEADFEMALE:Scott is in town for a college interview, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I don't think he'll have time for the decathlon.
LEADMALE:I know he'll want to play, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Before he moved away the two of us were the first two kids outside every morning and the last two kids in every night.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but that was five years ago, Jen.
OTHERFEMALE:Scott is 17 years old now, you know.
SUPMALE:People slow down as they get older.
LEADMALE:Their bones start to deteriorate with each passing year.
SUPFEMALE:Look at Dad.
LEADMALE:Thanks, coach.
SUPFEMALE:He's here.
SUPFEMALE:Scott, it's good to see you! Jennifer! How are you? Great.
LEADFEMALE:Look at you.

SUPMALE:What'll it be, Scott? Baseball, soccer, tennis.
LEADMALE:Greco-Roman wrestling? What do you mean? I thought we'd play some sports just like we did when we were kids.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sure.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like fun.
SUPMALE:You two have a good time.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Scott? Hi, Mallory.
SUPMALE:Boy, have you changed.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you changed too.
LEADMALE:I mean, you grew into your ears, and You look good too.
LEADMALE:Scott, what are you waiting for? Uh, Let's hold off on the soccer for a while, okay, Jennifer? Good idea.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, do you want to go down to your old house? Or maybe we could just sit on the lawn and talk about old times.
LEADMALE:Uh, yeah, sure.
SUPMALE:Go ahead and start without me and I'll be right there.
OTHERMALE:Okay.

SUPMALE:Yeah, well, it travels well, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what's all this? Just a few things for Scott to see, pictures of us when we were kids and stuff like that.
LEADMALE:He didn't have a chance to look at them yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:There she is.
LEADMALE:You want me to take this up to Mom, Dad? Oh, no, no, I'll do it.
LEADMALE:She denies it, but I think she kind of enjoys, being waited on by her husband.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, they all do, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:You know, they may say things have changed, but basically, they're happiest when they're barefoot and pregnant.
OTHERMALE:Oh, coming, Elyse! Sounds serious.
SUPMALE:This won't be enough.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, give me a hand.
SUPMALE:Uh, Mallory, get the peanut butter.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Jennifer, the garlic bread and the antipasto.
LEADMALE:Oh, and, Mallory, uh, a watermelon.
SUPFEMALE:That ought to hold her for a while.
OTHERFEMALE:## Ya, ya-da-da, da-da, da-da ## ## Ya, da-da-da-da-da-da ## ## Hey ## Hey, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Scotty.
OTHERFEMALE:What, are you cooking? You bet-a your life.

SUPFEMALE:She's upstairs or something.
LEADFEMALE:So hey, Scott.
SUPMALE:Are you up for your interview tomorrow? Uh, yeah.
SUPMALE:I'm pretty excited.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Let me give you a couple of tips, okay? I am, uh Well, hey, I'm kind of a legend at that college, and so I think you should slip my name into the conversation as much as you can.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, why don't you, uh, take this with you? This is a picture of you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:You know, you can keep that.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, uh, Mallory must be about, what, 17 years old now, huh? I don't know.

OTHERFEMALE:She's in her teens.
LEADMALE:I know that.
LEADMALE:Oh, another thing.
LEADFEMALE:Another thing.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.

OTHERFEMALE:They like you to be a good student, but, uh, fun-loving, like me.
LEADMALE:So, uh, is anybody seeing Mallory on a regular basis? Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:I am, and I've had about all I can take.
LEADFEMALE:Your mom really loved the Pasta Alex, Alex.
LEADMALE:Never seen anyone eat that fast.
LEADMALE:It was incredible.
OTHERFEMALE:I was afraid to put my hands near her mouth.
SUPMALE:Hi, Jennifer, Mallory, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:I was giving Scott a couple of tips for his interview.
LEADMALE:Ooh, let me give you the opposite advice I gave Alex before his 
LEADMALE:Just be yourself.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Dinner, she's served.
LEADMALE:Ah.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.

LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Well, I-I guess she's still hungry.
LEADMALE:I'll take her some more the Pasta Alex, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's all this stuff? Just a few pictures of us when we were kids and stuff like that.
OTHERMALE:Are there any pictures of you in here, Mallory? I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:There's Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:That's us when we dressed up for Halloween as Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:In the back.
LEADMALE:Look.
SUPMALE:That's Mallory's foot.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Scott, I was just thinking.
LEADMALE:The Indians are playing a twinight double-header this Saturday.
OTHERMALE:Do you want to go? Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:Anyway, Mallory, we have a lot of catching up to do.
LEADMALE:This picture of your foot really sparks the memories.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I was wondering if you have two tickets left for tonight's Indians game? You have 35,000? Well, I only need two.
LEADMALE:Can you hold them for me, please? My name is Jennifer Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Any sign of Scott yet, Alex? Ah, no, Jen.
LEADMALE:I haven't seen him.
LEADMALE:Tonight's the night we're going to see the Indians play a twinight double-header against the Seattle Mariners.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:The clash of the Titans.
SUPMALE:You want to come? There are 35,000 extra tickets.
OTHERMALE:Uh, no.
SUPMALE:Just, uh, give them to somebody else.
LEADFEMALE:Scott and I are gonna have a great time, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:He loves baseball, remember? You used to come sometimes when we were kids.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Remember that time I got that foul ball? You know, I made that great diving catch, you know, leaning over the railing.
LEADMALE:You didn't make a diving catch.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:It was a one-bouncer.
LEADMALE:It bounced once, I jumped up and I caught it.
LEADFEMALE:No, you didn't.
OTHERMALE:Ah, rolled down the steps to me.
SUPMALE:It rolled down the steps right to me.
SUPMALE:Alex, you bought that ball.
SUPFEMALE:I remember the store was really crowded.
SUPMALE:I had to leap over this lady Alex, give it up.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to go in the garage and see if I can find some old pennants.
LEADFEMALE:Call me when Scott comes.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Coming.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Let me give you a hand with this.
OTHERMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:What have you got in here, a new tie? It's the crib.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, roll up your sleeves, Alex.
SUPMALE:We've got some work to do.
LEADMALE:We? Yeah, it's been a while since you and I built anything together.
LEADMALE:You can assemble some furniture, can't you, Alex? Of course I can.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:It's just that you'd be surprised how many guys can't put together a simple kit.
LEADFEMALE:Well you're, uh You're looking at a guy who can, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see what we got here.
LEADMALE:Okey-doke.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Elyse! Mom! Mom! Honey! Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Scott.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:How did your interview go? Oh, pretty well, I think.
OTHERFEMALE:I tried to mention Alex's name a few times.
OTHERMALE:I hope they don't hold it against you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, have you eaten yet? No.
OTHERFEMALE:How about dinner at Guido's? Sure.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, champ.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened to your baseball game? Rained out.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:It's not raining.
LEADMALE:I have a problem, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, you're 11 years old.
OTHERFEMALE:You got a roof over your head.
OTHERFEMALE:You're fed every day.
SUPFEMALE:You don't pay taxes.
OTHERFEMALE:What kind of problem could you possibly have? The baseball game wasn't rained out.
LEADMALE:Scott took Mallory out to dinner instead.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe he forgot.
SUPMALE:How could you forget about something like that? Scott and I used to be best friends.
OTHERFEMALE:He never used to like Mallory at all.
LEADFEMALE:Now it's the opposite.
SUPMALE:What has Mallory got that I don't? Ah, let's put it this way, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:A 17-year-old guy will tend to have different tastes in girls than an 11-year-old guy.
OTHERFEMALE:It's only natural.
OTHERFEMALE:At this point in his life, Scott is interested in girls who are more soft.
LEADMALE:When did this happen to Scott? Why did he have to change? Well, it's nature, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Through, uh Through none of our her doing, Mallory just happens to have that certain intangible quality that attracts boys.
OTHERMALE:Boys who are helpless victims to the hormones coursing through their veins.
SUPFEMALE:You know, boys like Scott.
LEADFEMALE:Can we put a stop to this? It's too late, Jen.
SUPMALE:It's all over for Scott and his kind.
LEADFEMALE:It's not fair, Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:There's nothing you can do about it, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:My advice to you is that you just enjoy being a child for as long as you can.
OTHERFEMALE:I know I did.
OTHERMALE:It was the best two weeks of my life.
SUPMALE:You know, Mallory, it's really nice being here with you tonight.
LEADMALE:Heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Grazie, grazie.
SUPMALE:That's terrific.
LEADMALE:When did you learn to speak Italian? Grazie, grazie.
LEADMALE:Uh, Scott Handley's table, please.
LEADFEMALE:If you will follow me, signora.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Good evening, Scott.
LEADMALE:I thought I'd join you.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory! How nice to see you! Hi, Jen.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, why are you dressed this way? I'm a woman of many moods, Scott.
OTHERFEMALE:Young and playful one moment, sophisticated and deadly serious the next.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Jennifer, this is a table for two.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you can make room for your sister.
LEADMALE:Well, Scott, what do you recommend? The last time I was here I found the pizza with the bologna very much to my liking.
LEADFEMALE:Shall I go for it again? I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:This a joke or something? I'm deadly serious, Scott.
LEADFEMALE:Pizza with bologna or not? Jen, we already ordered.
LEADMALE:Mallory, Scott needs his strength.
LEADFEMALE:He has Mormons coursing through his veins.
LEADMALE:What? There will be no talking about baseball tonight, Scott.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean? Not really.
SUPMALE:You'll find tonight that I can be as soft as the next girl.
LEADFEMALE:Buy you a drink? Uh, all right, Jen.
SUPMALE:Uh, come here a minute No! You're making a spectacle of yourself.
OTHERMALE:Hey, listen.
SUPFEMALE:I think we ought to take you home now.
SUPMALE:I don't need you to take me home.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer Stop Are you okay, little girl? I'm fine.
SUPMALE:And I'm not a little girl.
LEADMALE:Waiter, my bike.
LEADFEMALE:Jen.
SUPMALE:Well, Alex, what do you think? She a beauty? She is a beauty, Dad, although I'd, uh, feel a little better about her if we'd, uh, used all the parts she came with.
LEADFEMALE:How many are left over? Well, uh, she came with 22 nuts, We used six nuts and seven bolts.
SUPMALE:That's not good.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, where have you been? I- I was upstairs playing dress-up in my room, and I heard Mrs.
LEADMALE:Alpeck pulling up next door, so I wanted to say hi to her.
OTHERMALE:Because I haven't seen her for such a long time.
SUPMALE:So I leaned out my window and I called to her, but she didn't hear me.
SUPMALE:So I leaned out some more and I fell out my window.
SUPMALE:And I'm coming back in now.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:Jennifer Jennifer, your window is 20 feet off the ground.
SUPMALE:You don't believe me, do you? If you'll excuse me, I'd like to go talk to Mom.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm sorry, honey.
LEADMALE:Your mom's asleep.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure you can talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:It's not the same.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, if you'll excuse us, I think she needs me right now.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Try and be a good brother, and they spit on you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh, what's What's going on? I made a mistake tonight, Dad.
LEADMALE:What did you do? I walked in on Mallory and Scott's date at Guido's.
LEADFEMALE:I made such a fool out of myself.
LEADMALE:It happens sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:It just happens.
LEADMALE:I wanted Scott to like me so much.
OTHERMALE:I thought if he got a good look at me in this dress, he'd leave Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:He doesn't know what he's missing, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, come on.
OTHERMALE:You cry.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
LEADMALE:You cry.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:What does Scott know? He knows that he doesn't want to be with me.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe you're too young to have a romance with someone like Scott.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want a romance.
LEADFEMALE:All I want is for things to go back the way they used to be.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm afraid that can't happen, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You and Scott had a very special relationship when you were younger.
LEADFEMALE:Things change.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so confused, Dad.
SUPMALE:I don't know the way I'm supposed to act.
SUPMALE:Sometimes I feel really grown up, and sometimes I feel like a little baby.
LEADFEMALE:That's one of the great things about being 11.
LEADMALE:You get to act any way you want.
LEADFEMALE:You do that at my age, they put you away.
SUPFEMALE:How did this happen to Scott? He grew up and I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:You grew up too, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:You're growing up right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, hi.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Um, can I be alone with Jen, Dad? We have some things to talk about.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, no problem.
SUPFEMALE:I was, uh I was just about to go into the kitchen, uh, get me a handful of trail mix.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Love that trail mix.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I made a big fool out of myself, huh? Ah.
LEADMALE:No, you didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I didn't notice anything.
LEADMALE:You must think I'm the biggest jerk in the world.
LEADFEMALE:As long as Alex is around, you aren't even the biggest jerk in this house.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I shouldn't have barged in on your date.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I should've been more sensitive to the way you feel.
LEADMALE:You know, I-I knew you were excited about Scott coming and everything.
LEADFEMALE:I should've invited you to come along with us.
SUPFEMALE:I may only be 11, but I know how many people it takes to make a good date.
SUPMALE:Mallory? Huh? What does it feel like to go out with boys? Is it as much fun as playing soccer with them? Um Well, it's a different kind of fun.
LEADMALE:Just give yourself a little time, Jen.
LEADMALE:You're getting there.
LEADFEMALE:I guess so.
SUPFEMALE:You know, lately I've been feeling like we weren't friends anymore.
SUPFEMALE:We don't spend time together like we used to.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on.
LEADFEMALE:We'll always be friends.
LEADMALE:It's just that we're growing up, and our interests are changing.
LEADFEMALE:You know? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm not so crazy about it, though.
LEADMALE:Do you want to go to the Cleveland Indians game with me tomorrow? Oh, wow.
OTHERMALE:I'd love to.
LEADFEMALE:What time's kickoff? Maybe we'll just go to the movies.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:Hey, you know something? With any luck, we'll have a little baby sister soon, and we'll start all over again.
LEADFEMALE:It will be fun, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, little sister.
LEADFEMALE:We have a present for you.
LEADMALE:Nice going, Dad.
OTHERMALE:
