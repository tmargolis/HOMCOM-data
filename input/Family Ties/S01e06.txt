LEADMALE:Oh, Steven, I got those lists you wanted.
SUPFEMALE: Thanks.
SUPMALE:This one is private contributors.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:This one here is government grants.
OTHERMALE:If Reagan cuts back any more, the white house won't be eligible to get our magazine.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, this will get us off to a good start.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a check for $500 from Dennis ellway.
OTHERMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Why aren't you excited? He sends us a check for $500 every week.
LEADMALE:They always bounce.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:What do you want me to do with it? Deposit it.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe this time we'll get lucky.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess this is one part of public-broadcasting life you won't miss, huh, Arthur? Oh, I don't know After 14 years, you get used to begging and groveling it becomes a way of life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, kids.
SUPMALE:Where you been? Down the hall.
LEADFEMALE:Alex stopped off to watch "wall street week.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, how was it? Well, I found it a little simplistic, but I guess it's okay for your average broker.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, look at you! You're getting cuter every day.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're just saying that, uncle Arthur.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not.
LEADMALE:Yes, he is.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, congratulate me.
OTHERMALE:I just talked wincott industries into donating $5,000 to the station.
OTHERFEMALE:How did you get that money out of wincott? Arthur's been after him for years.
SUPMALE:I explained the tax and public relations benefits to Mr.
LEADMALE:wincott, and he bought it.
SUPFEMALE:I was beautiful.
OTHERMALE:I was gorgeous.
SUPMALE:I was sensational.
LEADMALE:And modest.
LEADFEMALE:No, I wasn't modest.
SUPMALE:I did have to buy him six Martinis and promised that you'd give his wife some airtime for a Latin club.
SUPMALE:Her Latin club? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:They come out, they conjugate a few verbs.
LEADFEMALE:Veni, vidi, vici, e pluribus unum, and they're gone.
LEADMALE:That's crazy, Richard.
LEADFEMALE:You're always talking about originating local programming.
LEADMALE:Here's your opportunity.
LEADFEMALE:Arthur, talk to him.
OTHERFEMALE:What can I say, Steven? That's not my job anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, Arthur.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:wincott is waiting in your office.
LEADFEMALE:He wanted to tell you personally how happy he is to be involved with the pbs station.
LEADMALE:No problem, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:I'll take care of things down here.
LEADMALE:Steven, let me tell you how persuasive I was.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
SUPFEMALE:Please! Please! Please! That's Alex in 10 years.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:I'll send someone down.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Alex, would you mind going over and picking up these clips of these shows? We're doing a retrospective of the last 15 years.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, I'll handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Those film cans are very heavy.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, maybe you should do it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we'll all go help.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, you don't all have to go.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll stay here and help with the phone campaign.
LEADMALE:I love to talk on the phone.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, don't forget.
SUPMALE:This is business.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Don't start gossiping with any of the donors.
SUPFEMALE:Well, do you want me to To start organizing some numbers or or call or I'm sorry I'm staring, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't get over how fast time has flown by.
LEADMALE:How old are you now? No.
LEADFEMALE:You can't be.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm pretty sure.
SUPMALE:Oh, you've become a Such a beautiful girl.
LEADFEMALE:Or should I say young woman? Girl.
LEADFEMALE:Girl.
OTHERMALE:Young girl.
OTHERFEMALE:It's wonderful to see you growing up, becoming such a beautiful young lady.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh Thank you.
LEADMALE:Now, do you want me to start calling or should I handle incoming calls? Oh, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:That can wait.
LEADMALE:I haven't seen you in ages.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, before we start working, why don't you give your uncle Arthur a hug? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Arthur.
LEADMALE:How did we do today, honey? Not bad.
SUPFEMALE:We got pledges for $7,500.
LEADMALE:Is that counting the money from Dennis ellway? Uh, no.
LEADMALE:Including his money, we have $87,000.
OTHERMALE:Alex, I want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:I need your advice on something.
LEADFEMALE:It's really serious.
LEADFEMALE:Your hair looks great.
SUPFEMALE:Can I go now? Alex, I mean it.
LEADMALE:It's just I've got a problem.
LEADMALE:We all know that, Mallory, but admitting it is the first step.
LEADMALE:Alex, stop it.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, what is it? Well, this problem Uh, see, it's kind of in the neighborhood of sex.
LEADMALE:"The neighborhood of sex"? What, are we talking central-downtown sex or is this a suburb of sex? I'm not sure.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, didn't they show you that film in hygiene class? You know, the one with the baby chickies? Alex, times have changed.
SUPMALE:They show us one with the baby babies.
SUPFEMALE:You sure that, uh, I'm the one you want to talk to about this? I mean, I'm your brother.
LEADMALE:You don't want to reveal anything too personal to me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'll go outside and get a stranger.
LEADMALE:Alex, cut it out! This is really hard for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? Well, down at the station after everyone else left, I was alone with Arthur, and Well, I think he made a pass at me.
LEADMALE:Arthur? Uncle Arthur? Come on.
SUPFEMALE:He's known you since you were born.
LEADMALE:He used to bathe you when you were a baby.
SUPFEMALE:I think he wants his old job back.
LEADFEMALE:I can't I can't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:There has to be some reasonable explanation.
SUPMALE:There might be.
SUPFEMALE:Like I said, I'm not sure it was a pass, but What exactly did he do? Well, he held my hands, and, uh He gave me a kiss and then a hug.
LEADFEMALE:He's friendly, Mallory.
SUPMALE:He hugged me real tight.
LEADMALE:He's a warm person.
LEADFEMALE:And then he patted me on the behind.
OTHERMALE:Doesn't mean anything.
LEADFEMALE:Ballplayers do it all the time.
SUPFEMALE:I'd understand if I'd just hit a home run.
SUPFEMALE:He thinks you're cute, that's all.
OTHERMALE:Look, uncle Arthur just wouldn't do something like that.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure? I'm positive.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:I've never been so happy to be wrong about something in my life.
LEADFEMALE:I feel terrible that I even suspected him.
OTHERMALE:Don't feel bad about it.
LEADMALE:It's easy to misinterpret other people's actions, especially in these days of ambiguous sexual roles.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I guess that's what I did.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it happens to all of us.
LEADMALE:First time a girl kissed me good night I thought she was in love with me.
SUPFEMALE:Now I realize sometimes they kiss me good night to stop me from talking.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, thanks a lot.
OTHERFEMALE:You've really been supportive and understanding.
LEADMALE:It's kind of a nice surprise, since you're usually such a creep.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:It means a lot to me.
LEADFEMALE:"Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Steven Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:"I'm the general manager "of your public television station, wks.
LEADFEMALE:"We desperately need your help.
LEADFEMALE:"If each one of you could just look into your hearts and then reach into your Pocketbook, we may" hold hold it Hold it right there, dad.
LEADFEMALE:That approach is all wrong.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with it? I wrote it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you sound desperate.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody's gonna want to give you money if you sound like you really need it.
SUPMALE:Well, I thought it sounded okay.
SUPMALE:Don't patronize him.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean it.
OTHERFEMALE:Your father is a terrific spokesman for the station.
OTHERMALE:He's warm, he's appealing Arthur, really, it's getting late.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a break.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Quiet, kids.
SUPFEMALE:Your uncle Arthur has the floor.
LEADMALE:Go on, Arthur.
LEADMALE:As I recall, your last words were, uh, "warm and appealing.
LEADFEMALE:" May I be excused? I have a feeling this could get sticky.
SUPFEMALE:You can help me get dessert.
OTHERFEMALE:If you'd like.
SUPFEMALE:Can I help too? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Steven, I'm gonna need your help to get the tray down.
OTHERMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Warm and appealing.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mallory, could you wait a second? Uh, no, I don't think I can.
LEADFEMALE:See, everybody has to carry their own desserts.
SUPFEMALE:House rules.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to talk to you about yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Yesterday? Yes.
LEADMALE:Down at the station? Uh, the station.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that was fun stuffing those envelopes I'm not talking about envelopes.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what else is there? Let's be honest, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:When I gave you that big hug, you thought I was Well, making a pass at you, didn't you? Well, maybe.
SUPFEMALE:I thought so.
SUPMALE:I'm so glad I brought it up.
OTHERMALE:It's just that I was so happy to see you, I gave you a big hug, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I'm sorry if you thought it was too big.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't, really.
LEADMALE:Look, I want you to know that I think of you only in one way, and that's as little Mallory.
SUPMALE:And all I want is for you to think of me as your uncle Arthur.
SUPFEMALE:That's all I want, too.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:So if I did anything to make you think of me in any other way, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Well, I apologize for jumping to any conclusions.
OTHERMALE:Your apology is totally unnecessary.
SUPMALE:So is yours.
OTHERFEMALE:No hard feelings? No hard feelings, no.
LEADMALE:"And, uh, so if you, uh, feel like giving, give.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't, don't.
LEADFEMALE:" I think you've gone too far the other way now.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you're too low-pressure.
OTHERFEMALE:Kids, what do you think? You think it's too long? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Are they gonna validate parking down at the station? Maybe you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll keep working on it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, by the way, I thought I'd throw in a few nice words about Arthur since he is leaving and all.
OTHERFEMALE:Make a speech about Arthur on TV? Uh, sure.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of a going-away present.
LEADFEMALE:He'll get a kick out of it, and I think he deserves a little attention, don't you? I know he wants some.
SUPFEMALE:"Arthur press is a man we can all be proud of.
SUPMALE:A man who works hard and plays hard.
SUPMALE:" Uh, dad, I don't know about that last line.
LEADMALE:Oh, what's wrong with it? Well, I just don't think anybody cares how hard Arthur plays.
SUPMALE:I know I don't.
OTHERMALE:Well, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you're right.
SUPFEMALE:"Arthur's kindness, his warmth, and his sincerity "are an inspiration.
SUPMALE:"He's a man who has helped all of us at the station "feel like we're not just co-workers, "we're one big happy family.
OTHERFEMALE:You can always count on Arthur for a smile or a hug.
LEADMALE:" That's true.
LEADFEMALE:"So, Arthur, it is with sadness that I say adieu.
SUPFEMALE:"But I know that at wggk they'll say howdy-do to you.
LEADFEMALE:" Well? Well, what do you think? It's nice.
LEADMALE:It it's a little long.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, okay, okay.
LEADMALE:This isn't the final draft.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll, uh, make it a little shorter.
OTHERMALE:I've already cut out half the speech.
SUPFEMALE:You did say some very nice things though, Steven.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot.
LEADFEMALE:I'll try to think of some shorter nice things now.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, guys, you got a kitchen to clean.
SUPFEMALE:We've got a lot of dirty dishes.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, you want to wash or dry? I'll dry.
SUPFEMALE:There's more dignity to drying.
OTHERFEMALE:Guys? Uh, mom, Alex and I will be right with you.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to, uh, straighten up in here.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? It's Everything's okay.
SUPFEMALE:It's fine! We're gonna clean up this mess.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, what's going on? It's uncle Arthur.
LEADMALE:He kissed me, Alex, on the lips.
OTHERFEMALE:Hard.
LEADFEMALE:They don't do that when you hit a home run, do they? Not usually, no.
LEADFEMALE:Close game.
SUPMALE:World series.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:I admit there's a problem here.
LEADMALE:Help me, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what to do.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Just don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Let's work this out logically.
SUPFEMALE:Important thing is you're okay, right? I guess so, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do we know? We know you're okay, and uncle Arthur isn't, right? So it's one-one.
LEADMALE:Alex, you're not helping.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying.
LEADMALE:I'm I'm trying.
SUPMALE:Can you try harder? Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I think the thing to do is I-I mean I mean, this is just my opinion, but I think it's the right thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:What? Talk to your mother.
SUPMALE:Alex, no! Mom! Come here, quick! What's wrong? Mallory wants to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:I'd, uh, stay, Mallory, but I think you'd be more comfortable if I left.
LEADMALE:I know I would.
OTHERMALE:What's up? Mom, don't get mad at me for saying this, but uncle Arthur made a pass at me.
LEADFEMALE:Arthur? Are you sure? Mom, I'm positive.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, when you say a "pass" I mean, a pass, with his hands and his lips.
LEADMALE:He did it twice Once down at the station, and then again last night while you were in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Did he hurt you? No, but he scared me.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, I'm so embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, you shouldn't be embarrassed.
LEADMALE:You didn't do anything wrong.
LEADMALE:I just I can't understand why he would do something like this.
LEADFEMALE:No, neither can I.
OTHERMALE:But you can bet we'll find out when we talk to him.
OTHERMALE:Talk to him? Oh, mom, I couldn't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Can't we just pretend this never happened? No, honey, no.
SUPMALE:That's one thing we can't do.
LEADFEMALE:These things happen too often to pretend that they don't exist.
LEADMALE:Did it ever happen to you? Uh, y-yes, it did.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, a friend of the family, well, grabbed me one time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what did you do? Went upstairs, put on "American bandstand," and did the twist.
LEADMALE:I was confused.
LEADMALE:I was embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:I-I thought maybe it was my fault.
SUPMALE:I thought maybe I'd misinterpreted what he did.
LEADFEMALE:And even if he really meant to do it, what good was telling anybody gonna do? That's how I feel.
SUPMALE:How can I accuse him of being so rotten after all the wonderful things he's done for me over the years? Mallory, listen to me.
LEADMALE:You don't want him to do it to you again, and you don't want him to do it to any other girls, do you? Okay, I guess you're right.
SUPMALE:But, I mean, he's such a good friend of dad's.
LEADMALE:I-I'm not saying this is gonna be easy.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, maybe it would be better if it's me that talks to Arthur instead of your dad.
OTHERFEMALE:But one thing I'm sure of, this This thing is gonna be taken care of, okay? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I've come up with a new approach.
SUPMALE:Who wants to hear a few nice words about Arthur? Okay, I'll shorten it some more.
LEADFEMALE:About three minutes to go, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I had more time.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:They're just finishing up on that documentary, "
LEADMALE:Your silent friend in the garden.
LEADMALE:" It should be a big ratings-grabber, that one.
OTHERFEMALE:You never know.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that was Arthur's baby, his last hurrah.
LEADFEMALE:Gives you a good idea why he's moving on.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Richard.
OTHERMALE:I agree that people with, uh, less than 60 acres may find this one a little slow, but there's something to remember about Arthur press He was there at the beginning, when public broadcasting was just a baby.
LEADMALE:And so were you.
SUPFEMALE:He, uh, deserves a little respect.
OTHERFEMALE:Save it for the speech, Steve.
OTHERFEMALE:Two minutes.
LEADMALE:Hey, dad, I just wanted to come and wish you luck.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be up here answering phones if you need me.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I-i can start off in one of two ways, Alex, with a history of the station or, uh, maybe I should start with a direct appeal for money.
LEADMALE:After the show that's on right now? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'd start with an alarm clock.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hi, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Now, remember, dad.
LEADFEMALE:When you're making your speech, be humble, but try to maintain your pride.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do my best.
