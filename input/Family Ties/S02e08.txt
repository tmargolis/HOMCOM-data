SUPFEMALE:hi, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:You're home late.
OTHERMALE:Everything all right? The coach wasn't happy with the way we were playing.
LEADFEMALE:He made us all run extra laps.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that seems a little excessive, doesn't it? Did you have a chance to talk to him about it? We're not allowed to speak during practice.
LEADMALE:Now, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:This has gone too far now.
OTHERFEMALE:Something ought to be done about him.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Keaton.
LEADMALE:I told you to jog all the way home.
OTHERFEMALE:You walked the last half-block.
LEADFEMALE:Drop and give me 20! When you walk in this house, you're not the coach anymore! You're what you've always been An annoying human being! You know, I don't know why I put up with this.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, if being a coach is so painful for you, why don't you just resign? When Alex p.
LEADMALE:Keaton starts something, he finishes it.
SUPFEMALE:I am turning these raw rookies into baseball machines.
LEADMALE:Alex, they're just young girls.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, they they come in as young girls They leave as men.
SUPMALE:Count me out, Alex.
LEADMALE:Wasn't skippy with you? Yeah, he was right behind me.
SUPMALE:Sorry I lagged behind, guys.
LEADFEMALE:This bag weighs a ton.
LEADFEMALE:You all right, skippy? Yeah, I'll be fine, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I didn't realize how strenuous it is being team equipment manager.
OTHERMALE:Mom, do you remember where I put that Sweater That's probably in my room anyways? Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:I'd get up, but I seem to have lost all sense in the lower part of my body.
SUPMALE:Great, now it's a perfect match for the upper part.
SUPMALE:Alex, why don't you get skippy something cold to drink? No, no.
LEADMALE:Don't go to any trouble.
LEADMALE:Maybe if Mallory sat next to me and soothed my weary brow.
SUPMALE:I'll get you a glass of water, skippy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll help you carry it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi, Arlene! Come on in.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's okay.
SUPMALE: Hi, Arlene.
SUPMALE:Skippy, mom says if you're not home in five minutes, she's feeding your dinner to the Guinea pigs.
LEADMALE:That mom, what a card.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What ya doing, Jennifer? Washing your baseball mitten? It's called a "mitt," Arlene.
LEADFEMALE:I was wondering if you wanted to come over and help make dresses for my turtles.
LEADMALE:Can't.
LEADFEMALE:How come? Softball practice.
LEADMALE:Again? You're always practicing.
SUPMALE:Aren't you good yet? You gonna be able to make it home okay, skip? No, I don't think it's safe for me to be moved right now.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, we gotta go.
LEADMALE:Mom's in one of her moods.
LEADMALE:Well, why didn't you say so before, Arlene? Uh, goodbye, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Parting is such Sweet sorrow.
LEADMALE:She's probably too choked up to speak.
LEADMALE: Bye, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Bye, Arlene.
LEADMALE:Take care of yourselves.
SUPFEMALE: Bye, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Jennifer, you were so rude to Arlene.
LEADMALE:And you were rude to skippy.
SUPFEMALE:Arlene's used to it, mom.
LEADMALE:Skippy enjoys it.
SUPMALE:You're never nice to Arlene.
LEADFEMALE:She's such a sweet little girl.
SUPFEMALE:She only wants to be your friend.
LEADMALE:It wouldn't have hurt you to go to her house tonight.
LEADFEMALE:It might've been fun.
SUPFEMALE:We have nothing in common.
LEADMALE:She doesn't know anything about sports.
SUPFEMALE:She thinks a slam dunk's something you do with a doughnut.
LEADMALE:Face it, Jennifer, it's the curse of the handelmans.
LEADFEMALE:The only escape is running or hiding.
LEADMALE:Course, these things should be done in as nice a manner as possible.
SUPMALE:I got it! I got it! I got it! Hello! Yes, he's here.
SUPMALE:It's for you, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Next time, answer your own phone calls, okay? Hello? What?! Hey, you're scheduled to pitch.
LEADMALE:The team needs you, Tammy.
LEADFEMALE:Is it a question of more money? Yeah, yeah, okay.
SUPMALE:All right, goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, what's wrong? My best southpaw is moving.
LEADFEMALE:She's not gonna be here for the playoffs.
OTHERMALE:That's the fourth kid I've lost this week.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, the girls think you're working them too hard.
SUPFEMALE:Too hard? Hey, I cut back on their steroids, didn't I? I'm not complaining.
LEADMALE:It's just that some of the kids joined the team to have fun.
SUPMALE:Fun.
SUPMALE:What does fun have to do with it? Alex, it's only a game.
LEADFEMALE:Only a game.
LEADMALE:"Baseball is only a game.
LEADFEMALE:" You know, that's exactly how the Russians want us to think.
LEADMALE:Alex, why don't you just get yourself another southpaw? Well, what's a southpaw? A southpaw is a left-hander.
LEADFEMALE:So why don't they just call them left-handers? Well, that way the Russians would know what we meant.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, susie.
SUPFEMALE:How you doing? The flu.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy and Becky, too? Hey, I instructed you not to have that pajama party last week.
LEADMALE:So you're not gonna play? None of you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, all right.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Feel better.
SUPMALE:They're not going to play? That leaves us one player short.
LEADFEMALE:How could they do this to us?! Well, I'm sure they didn't get sick to inconvenience you.
OTHERMALE:You know, I'm not so sure.
SUPMALE:They have had an attitude problem from the word go.
LEADFEMALE:If we don't have 10 players, we'll have to forfeit.
LEADMALE:Well, Jennifer, winning isn't everything.
LEADMALE: It's the only thing.
LEADMALE:We'll we'll talk more about this later, huh? I've got to get to work.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm, could I get a lift, dad? I'm wearing these new shoes.
LEADMALE:They're not good for walking.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I always look for that in a shoe myself.
LEADMALE:Aah! Jennifer, want to walk to school together? I guess so.
SUPMALE:I have to go there, anyway.
LEADMALE:Arlene, you don't have a sweater or a jacket.
LEADFEMALE:It's cold outside.
OTHERMALE:Well, I had a sweater, but the obecks' dog took it from me.
LEADMALE:I guess I was too scared to ask for it back.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, I'll get you something of Jennifer's to wear.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer? Don't say no until I finish this thought.
SUPFEMALE:No! Jennifer, we've worked too hard this season to come up short.
SUPMALE:If Arlene plays, we'll have enough players and we won't have to forfeit the game.
LEADFEMALE:She hates sports.
LEADFEMALE:She's not going to play.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, she may hate sports, but, uh, she likes you, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:You can talk her into it.
LEADFEMALE:But, Alex Jennifer, it's for the good of the team.
LEADMALE:Ready, Jennifer? Of course she's ready.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you, Jennifer? You know, Arlene, you and I don't spend enough time together.
LEADMALE:Say, did you ever play any baseball? You make a lot of friends in the dugout.
LEADFEMALE:How's that batter coming, Alex? It's almost ready, dad.
LEADMALE:Is the griddle hot yet? All set.
LEADFEMALE:Okeydokey.
SUPMALE:I tried something different this time.
OTHERMALE:I think you might enjoy it.
LEADMALE:A little too heavy on the buckwheat? Well, don't throw it out.
SUPFEMALE:There's a loose brick in the fireplace.
LEADFEMALE:Why are we doing this, anyway, dad? Cooking is women's work.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, some of the best chefs in the world are men.
OTHERFEMALE:Like who? Chef boyardee.
LEADMALE:Uncle Ben! General mills.
SUPMALE:Where are they when you need 'em? You clean up.
OTHERMALE:I'll go tell your mother we're going out for breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, my knee really hurts.
LEADMALE:You just skinned it.
LEADMALE:It'll be okay.
OTHERFEMALE:How was practice, girls? I think I'm getting better.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you, Jennifer? Not really.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm trying, Jennifer, but I'm just not a jock.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, maybe you could help Arlene with her batting stance.
LEADMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:What's the matter? I keep tipping over.
LEADFEMALE:I'll meet you out there.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I gotta clean up this mess that dad made.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Arlene, I'll help you with your stance myself.
SUPFEMALE:Can't we take a break first? I'm really sleepy.
LEADMALE:There will be time enough for breaks after the big game.
LEADMALE:Wow, baseball's tough.
LEADMALE:Now, don't forget to choke up on that bat, bend those knees, keep those feet apart! And get the cap off your eyes.
LEADMALE:Okay, get ready.
LEADMALE:Here it comes.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you swing? That pitch was perfect! I'm afraid! You're throwing too hard! Don't be a sissy! Jennifer, I can't do this! Yes, you can.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to! But No buts! In a real game, the pitcher's gonna throw a lot harder, like this! Mom! Mom! Mrs.
LEADMALE:Schofield, please, be reasonable.
SUPFEMALE:Look, this is the championship game, and we're gonna forfeit without Charlotte.
LEADFEMALE:We can give her her medication between innings.
SUPMALE:That's the beauty of it.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm not saying that that 101 is normal, but it's 2 degrees lower than anyone else on the team.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal? She usually runs a little hot anyway.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hello? Hey, there.
LEADMALE:How's it going, Alex? Ah, hi, skip.
OTHERFEMALE:How's Arlene? Oh, she came home this morning.
LEADMALE:The doctor only kept her in the hospital overnight as a precaution.
SUPMALE:She's got a black eye, and one of her cheeks looks like she's storing nuts for the winter, but she's fine.
OTHERFEMALE:She's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, skippy.
LEADFEMALE:How's Arlene? It was a long night, Mallory And not a pretty one.
LEADFEMALE:None of us slept much.
SUPFEMALE:I can still hear the echo of my footsteps in the long, empty hallway, as I returned with yet another cup of black coffee to get me through the vigil.
SUPMALE:Must have been very rough on you, skippy.
LEADMALE:Call me "irwin.
SUPMALE:" Irwin.
LEADMALE:You know, she's not out of the woods yet.
LEADMALE:If only I could go back to the hospital and tell Arlene that you agreed to be mine.
LEADMALE:It's been a dream of hers forlong.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, skippy.
OTHERMALE:Elyse just told me that Arlene's home and everything's okay.
LEADMALE:Glad to hear it.
LEADMALE:You disgust me.
SUPFEMALE:That old handelman magic's starting to work.
LEADFEMALE:Skip I'm surprised you didn't think of this earlier.
SUPFEMALE:Having your sister maimed to boost your social life.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mallory.
LEADMALE:How's Jennifer? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I hope she's all right.
LEADMALE:Poor kid.
SUPMALE:She was so upset last night, she wouldn't even come down to dinner.
SUPFEMALE:She must feel terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:Good morning, honey.
LEADFEMALE:What a great day, huh? You're in a much better mood than I expected.
SUPFEMALE:Look, honey, you don't need to hide your feelings.
LEADMALE:We all feel terrible about what happened.
LEADMALE:It was an accident.
LEADMALE:Accidents happen.
LEADFEMALE:Kids get hurt playing softball all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Um, Jennifer, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:handelman said, uh, Arlene might like some visitors today.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's real nice.
LEADFEMALE:Say hi for me.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, what is wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me.
OTHERFEMALE:It wasn't me who walked into a baseball.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, can I talk to you a minute? Can't it wait until later? I really want to see the end of this.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, you're watching midget kickboxing.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but it's the finals.
LEADMALE:I think we should talk about what happened yesterday.
LEADMALE:You know, this whole thing wouldn't have happened if I wouldn't have asked her to join the team.
SUPMALE:Well, Jennifer, putting Arlene on the team was a very nice thing to do.
LEADMALE:You don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:When we were out in the back practicing, she told me all the pitches I was throwing were too hard, but I kept on throwing them hard Even though I knew she couldn't handle it.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to lose the big game because of her, so I had to try to turn her into Johnny bench in two days.
LEADMALE:That's why she got hurt.
LEADMALE:Well, honey, you're only 11 years old.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're not in the major leagues.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Arlene may not be exactly Johnny bench, but then you're not exactly, uh Who? Dave concepcion.
SUPMALE:Dave concepcion.
LEADFEMALE:Who's Dave concepcion? She never really wanted to play softball, mom.
LEADFEMALE:She only did it 'cause she wanted to be my friend.
LEADMALE:Do you think maybe you'd feel better if you, uh if you apologized to Arlene? I can't do that, dad.
SUPMALE:She really likes me.
LEADMALE:How could I look her in the eye and tell her what a rotten thing I did? Look, Arlene.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory's on her way over.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't you just try to look a little less healthy? Sorry.
SUPMALE:Next time I'll try to be more severely injured.
LEADFEMALE:You feel like another story? Not right now.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:Just one.
SUPMALE:Mom says I'm supposed to be resting.
LEADFEMALE:It'll take your mind off your troubles.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:"Brad dooley woke up" Uh, come in! Well, Arlene, how are you? Hi, Arlene.
LEADMALE:How are you feeling? I'm fine, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:The doctor says I can get up today if I want.
SUPMALE:It's just that when I try to, I get a little nauseous.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm afraid I'll upchuck.
OTHERFEMALE:You stay right where you are, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you move a muscle.
OTHERMALE:Here, Arlene.
LEADMALE:This is for you from all of us.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:So, how's it look for today's game, coach? Uh, not so good, Arlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody's got the flu.
LEADMALE:Kind of hoping for a miracle.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, don't you worry, though.
LEADFEMALE:You just relax.
SUPMALE:We'll get 'em next year.
LEADMALE:Is Jennifer gonna come over? Well, Jen Jennifer I mean, I'm sure she Dopey me, I completely forgot! Arlene's not supposed to have more than three visitors at a time.
OTHERMALE:That's the doctor's orders.
OTHERFEMALE:One, two, three, four, five.
LEADMALE:Oops.
LEADFEMALE:We can't have that, now, can we? What do you say you and I find something else to do while your parents and Alex console my poor, injured sister? You want to see my fossil collection? Not now, skippy.
LEADMALE:I'd like to let them age another few thousand years.
LEADFEMALE:It's a date.
SUPMALE:Can I come in? Sure, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Uh, you know I think skippy's right.
LEADFEMALE:Arlene shouldn't have too many visitors at once.
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we clear out and let Jennifer and Arlene talk, okay? We'll see you tomorrow, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you take care of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mallory, no girl has ever seen those fossils.
LEADMALE:You'd be the first! Thanks for coming over, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:You're welcome, Arlene.
LEADMALE:Cute.
LEADFEMALE:Your parents brought it.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.
LEADMALE:You're sorry? Yeah.
SUPMALE:You were trying to teach me how to bat, and I let the ball hit me in the face.
SUPFEMALE:That was my fault, Arlene.
SUPMALE:If I wasn't such a klutz, it never would've happened.
SUPFEMALE:You're not a klutz.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe just a little bit of a klutz.
SUPMALE:My mother says I trip over the lines in our kitchen linoleum.
OTHERMALE:But I kept thinking maybe if I could play sports, I might be a better friend to you.
SUPMALE:I wasn't such a very good friend to you, Arlene.
LEADMALE:I only put you on the team because they wouldn't let us play with only nine girls.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:You knew? I may be a klutz, but I'm not stupid.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really sorry you got hurt.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
SUPMALE:This has been the most fun I've ever had.
OTHERFEMALE:Including the hospital.
LEADMALE:It was exciting.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't even cry once.
LEADFEMALE:You're a lot tougher than I thought.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean you like me? Yeah, I do.
LEADMALE:Maybe you could play on the team next year.
LEADMALE:No, I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just no good at sports.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:We can still be friends.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean it? Give me five.
OTHERMALE:Maybe we could get together later in the week? Sounds good.
LEADMALE:We can make those dresses for your turtles.
LEADMALE:Kathy can't play.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:It's official.
SUPMALE:It's all over, skip.
LEADFEMALE:We lose.
OTHERMALE:Come on, skip.
OTHERMALE:Life's a funny thing.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, the girls from the team are here.
LEADMALE:Oh, great, great.
LEADFEMALE:Now I got eight more little hearts to break.
LEADMALE:Couldn't find another player, huh? You know, it's not fair, dad.
SUPFEMALE:We have worked all season, and for what? The championship game is in half an hour, and we're gonna have to forfeit.
SUPFEMALE:Has that been the only purpose in playing this whole season, to get to the championship? Is that all that counts? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What about the fresh air? The exercise? The thrill of competition? What about the fun? Alex, the team is waiting.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I don't know how to break it to 'em.
SUPFEMALE:Well, just give it to 'em straight, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:That's probably the best way.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, bring in the girls! Come on, let's go! Come on! 
SUPFEMALE:Go! Go, leopards, go! Go, leopards, go! Go, leopards, go! Go, leopards, go! Okay.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Have a have a seat.
LEADMALE:Men I have something important to tell you.
OTHERFEMALE:Arlene handelman hurt herself yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:She hurts herself every day.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, the important thing is that she's all right.
SUPMALE:But she, uh, she doesn't feel up to playing, so we're not gonna have enough players.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna have to forfeit.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, no! 
LEADFEMALE:Forfeit? I knew we never should've let that nerdy Arlene on the team.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah! Wait a minute! She's not a nerd! She's got a lot more guts and courage than Than Dave concepcion! Than any of us! And she happens to be a good friend of mine, so you better not knock her ever again.
SUPMALE:Okay, come on, girls.
SUPMALE:Hold those heads up high.
OTHERFEMALE:W-we've had a great year.
SUPMALE:We've, uh we've been in the fresh air.
LEADMALE:We've, uh, we've exercised.
LEADMALE:We've enjoyed the The thrill of competition.
LEADMALE:This year may be over, but But there's always next year.
LEADMALE:Right? Hey, what are you all sitting around for? We've got a championship game to play! What? Arlene, you don't have to do this for me.
LEADMALE:When I said we were friends, I meant it.
LEADMALE:You don't owe me anything.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not doing it just for you, Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:The team needs me, and I need the team.
LEADFEMALE:That's my sister! Whoa! Whoa, girls.
LEADMALE:Okay, let's go out there, let's play hard, play our best.
