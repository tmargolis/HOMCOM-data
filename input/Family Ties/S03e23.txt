LEADMALE:My dad, the problems, the fights.
LEADMALE:Steven, I think you're making too much out of all this.
LEADMALE:You weren't here.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know what went on.
LEADMALE:My father was a very difficult man.
SUPFEMALE:Talking about Pop? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Good man.

SUPFEMALE:You kids oughta hear.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Come on Oh, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:I was just gonna tell 'em about how your grandpa Jake had to go in to school because your father got in trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do, Dad? It was nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Rob Your father refused to put his name in the upper-right-hand corner of his test papers in school.
SUPFEMALE:Is that true, Dad? It was my paper and I thought I had a right to put my name wherever I wanted to.
LEADMALE:Oh, I remember, Dad got a hold of you.
LEADMALE:You remember, Stevie? He said, "Are you from this planet or what?" I, uh I don't I don't see what's so funny.
LEADFEMALE:Papers need to be graded, Dad.
LEADMALE:All those names have to be in the same place, every time.
LEADMALE:I mean, that was deviant behavior, and I hope Grandpa Jake punished you appropriately.
SUPMALE:I was tarred and feathered.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Thought you could use some refreshment.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's great, Elyse.
SUPMALE:I can definitely use something.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you know? You have been sitting here six hours.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of ghosts here, Elyse.
LEADMALE:A lot of ghosts.
LEADFEMALE:Friendly ones, I hope.
LEADFEMALE:Did I ever tell you about Mr.
SUPMALE:and Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kretzer? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:They were this beautiful older couple from Austria.
LEADMALE:They lost their only son in the war and they kind of adopted me.
LEADMALE:I used to pass their house on my walk home from school, and she always had some cookies, some cakes for me.
SUPFEMALE:"Ve must to fatten you up, Stevie," she would say.
LEADMALE:Guess she'd be disappointed if she saw me now, huh? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think anyone who saw you now would be disappointed.
LEADMALE:I didn't realize how special they were, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Sometimes I'd stop in to see them.
SUPMALE:Sometimes I'd forget.
LEADFEMALE:It took so little for me to make them happy.
SUPFEMALE:I was so thoughtless about it.
SUPMALE:Why didn't I realize? You were 10.
SUPFEMALE:It won't come again, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:The Kretzers, that whole generation.
LEADMALE:What they did.
LEADFEMALE:To come to a new land.
OTHERFEMALE:They didn't speak the language.
LEADMALE:They built a life.
SUPFEMALE:They were heroes, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Every last one of 'em.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't find the time to have a glass of milk with them.
LEADMALE:Steven, stop it.
SUPFEMALE:You were a kid.
LEADFEMALE:Kids don't think about things like that.
LEADMALE:The world will last forever.
LEADFEMALE:It'll never change.
SUPMALE:You'll always be 10.
LEADMALE:They'll always be 75.
LEADMALE:They'd be 109 now, I guess.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I should give them a call.
LEADFEMALE:They're probably not up.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of ghosts here, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Let's go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:You go.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be up in a minute.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Don't forget to eat your cookies, okay? Okay.
SUPMALE:"We must to fatten you up.

OTHERFEMALE:Now, go wash your hands.
LEADMALE:I can't eat, Mom.
LEADMALE:I'm too excited.
SUPMALE:Don't you realize we have television in the house? So now that we have television, you're never gonna eat again? You delivered all your papers? Sure, Pop.
OTHERFEMALE:And you collected all your money too, huh? Well Did you or didn't you? I got most of it, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:It's not important.
LEADMALE:Money's important.
SUPFEMALE:It's very important.
SUPMALE:Why do you think I press clothes 16 hours a day? I like steam? I know money's important, Dad, but other things are important too.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? People should be able to read the paper, especially old people, when it's all they have.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Minelli didn't pay again, huh? No, but she said she'd pay me Next week.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:She showed me pictures of her and Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Minelli back in Italy.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Those are very valuable.
LEADMALE:I understand with ten of those pictures, you can get a car.
OTHERFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna put it right down here and I want you to finish everything.
LEADFEMALE:I can't eat it now, Mom.
LEADMALE:I'll miss Milton Berle.
LEADMALE:Well, you can eat while you watch.
OTHERMALE:I'll laugh too much.
OTHERMALE:I'll choke.
