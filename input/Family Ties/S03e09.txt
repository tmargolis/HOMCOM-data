OTHERMALE:And not babble about some dumb wedding.
LEADMALE:This is ridiculous, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Doug is your best friend.
LEADMALE:I think it's silly for you not to go to his wedding.
LEADFEMALE:We're going.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I don't think this wedding should affect your friendship with Doug.
LEADMALE:It won't affect my friendship with Doug because, uh, my friendship with Doug is over.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:What are you two doing? Mallory's teaching me how to walk in high heels.

OTHERFEMALE:Alex, why won't you come to our wedding? Look, I, uh I just can't, okay? Why not? What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything.
LEADMALE:I've been to a lot of weddings.
LEADMALE:You think Doug's making a mistake by getting married, don't you? B- but Eleanor, it's nothing personal, you know? I mean, you seem real nice.
LEADMALE:It's just that I don't think Doug is ready to get married right now, you know, to anyone.
LEADMALE:Well, why not? Because he's so naive? Well, It's not that he's naive.
SUPFEMALE:It's that he's Innocent.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but But it's more than that.
SUPMALE:It's that he sees the world through the eyes of a child, almost like an infant? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, like an infant.
LEADMALE:Like an infant who was raised in the woods by other infants.
LEADFEMALE:I remember the very beginning.
LEADMALE:I would walk home from school, and he would walk backwards ten paces in front of me, calling to me in Italian, and And tossing flowers at my feet.
LEADFEMALE:And I remember thinking, "Who is this strange boy?" Yeah, well, he's one of a kind.
OTHERFEMALE:One day he said, "I must show you my treasures," and he emptied his knapsack right on my front steps.
SUPFEMALE:I never saw such an odd collection of things.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, all those aluminum cans.
SUPFEMALE:Little wind-up dinosaurs.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Picture of Sergio Frankie.
OTHERMALE:And his favorite page from the phonebook.
SUPMALE:Smith through Smith.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, I love that crazy lug.
LEADFEMALE:I do too, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Won't you reconsider and come to the wedding? Eleanor, I, uh I just can't.
OTHERMALE:Doug is so hurt, Alex.
OTHERMALE:I just can't stand seeing him this way.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, there's nothing I can do.
SUPMALE:Okay? I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry too, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong, Alex? Uh, n-nothing, Dad.

LEADMALE:No, she was great.
SUPMALE:She's one One of the nicest people I ever met in my life.
LEADMALE:Then you're going to the wedding? No.
LEADMALE:No, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I'm opposed to this marriage, now more than ever before.
SUPFEMALE:And you know the thing that really irks me? I have no idea why.
LEADMALE:Maybe you're afraid.
LEADMALE:Of what? Of losing Doug to Eleanor.
OTHERMALE:Losing Doug to Eleanor? Come on, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:You make it sound like Losing Doug to Eleanor.
LEADMALE:That's absurd.
LEADFEMALE:I knew him first.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Eleanor is not taking Doug away.
OTHERFEMALE:The two of you can still be friends.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but Look, who Who's gonna look after him now? You know, who's gonna hold his glasses when he drinks out of the water fountain? Who's gonna help him find his keys? Who's gonna tell him not to walk when the sign says "don't walk"? She will.
LEADMALE:Those are my jobs.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:This is just the tip of the iceberg.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is changing.
SUPFEMALE:Doug is getting married, and the poker game is breaking up.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer is wearing high heels.
SUPMALE:Where does it stop? It never stops, Alex.
LEADMALE:Change is Is just a part of life.
OTHERFEMALE:You have to learn to accept it with grace and dignity.
LEADMALE:Jennifer's wearing high heels? Oh, Steven.
