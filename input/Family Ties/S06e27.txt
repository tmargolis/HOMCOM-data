LEADFEMALE:Come on, Alex, can't you give us a hand? Sorry, Mom, it just seems kind of silly to clean up before company comes.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's just gonna get messy again.
LEADMALE:Come on, your cousin June hasn't been here in three years.
SUPMALE:I don't want her coming into a messy house.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? It was messy when she left.
LEADFEMALE:I just got off the phone with Jennifer.
LEADMALE:She's still at Adam's house doing the science project.
OTHERFEMALE:She said she'll be here soon.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder what's taking them so long.
SUPFEMALE:They should've finished that science project by now.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, they're trying to get fruit flies to mate and it's taking longer than they thought.
SUPMALE:You know, I'm a little offended by that project.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I think Jennifer should learn about fruit flies on the street like I did.
OTHERMALE:I wish she'd hurry because your father and June should be back from the airport any minute now.
OTHERMALE:They probably stopped off for a good ol' American hamburger.
LEADFEMALE:You know, that English food's pretty disgusting.
LEADFEMALE:That's a very narrow view, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Just because English food is different than ours doesn't mean it's terrible.
LEADMALE:Come on, Ma, how would you characterize a place that serves ox tails and kidney pies for breakfast? Disgusting.
SUPFEMALE:I mean "different," hey.
LEADMALE:I'm so excited that June's coming.
LEADFEMALE:I can't imagine what it's like to study in England.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't even know what it's like to study in America.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look who's here.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, hi! - Hi, June, hi! - Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? - Hey.
SUPMALE:There she is.
SUPMALE:Hi, June.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Sorry, we're late we stopped off for hamburgers.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I couldn't wait English food is disgusting.
SUPMALE:Nah, it's just different.
OTHERMALE:June, you look great.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
SUPMALE:All you do, too.
LEADMALE:The baby.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Is that Andrew? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, he's so cute.
LEADMALE:Where's Jennifer? - Oh, she'll be here soon.
LEADMALE:She's at her boyfriend's house studying.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm so excited you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, are you kidding? You think I'd miss a chance to brag all about my trip? Well, sit down and brag.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, what was London like? Yeah, did you take advantage of the strong dollar? Did you meet the queen? Yeah, I love monarchies.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, come on, give her a chance to answer.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Steven.
SUPMALE:Uh, I brought some pictures and I'm anxious to tell you all about my trip.
LEADMALE:Great, we want to hear all about it.
SUPMALE:Well, a lot of things happened in three years.
SUPMALE:Mm, you're telling us.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know where to start.
LEADMALE:Well, how about the boys? Well, I did meet a couple of cute boys.
LEADFEMALE:And I got their pictures right here.
SUPMALE:I knew it.
OTHERMALE:Did you date any princes or dukes or anything? - No, just commoners.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's funny.
SUPMALE:When I got to England, I wasn't that interested in boys, but, uh, now they're not so bad, you know? Thanks, we try.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess we're all changing.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, here we are and Jennifer's out with a boy.
SUPFEMALE:I guess she's really growing up, huh? Well yes and no.
LEADMALE:Jennifer! Good evening, Scott.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I'd join you.
LEADMALE:Mallory! How nice to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Jen.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, why are you dressed this way? I'm a woman of many moods, Scott young and playful one moment, sophisticated and deadly serious the next.
LEADMALE:Hey! Uh Jennifer, this is a table for two.
SUPMALE:I'm sure you can make room for your sister.
LEADMALE:Well, Scott, what do you recommend? The last time I was here, I found the pizza with bologna very much to my liking.
LEADFEMALE:Shall I go for it again? I don't get it is this a joke or something? I'm deadly serious, Scott, pizza with bologna or not? Jen, we already ordered.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, Scott needs his strength.
SUPFEMALE:He has "mormons" coursing through his veins.
SUPFEMALE:What? They'll be no talking about baseball tonight, Scott.
SUPMALE:Know what I mean? Not really.
LEADMALE:You'll find tonight that I can be as soft as the next girl.
LEADFEMALE:Buy you a drink? Uh All right, Jen, uh, come here for a minute.
SUPMALE:Mallory, you're making a spectacle of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, I think we ought to take you home now.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need you to take me home.
LEADMALE:Jennifer - Stop Are you okay, little girl? I'm fine, and I'm not a little girl.
LEADMALE:Waiter, my bike.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, she was really embarrassed.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, poor kid.
OTHERMALE:I had to convince her that making a fool out of yourself is part of life when you're growing up.
LEADMALE:It's even part of life after you've grown up.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I know I matured a lot over the years.
LEADFEMALE:When I think back Uh, June, why don't you just show us the pictures and tell us about your trip? Let's face it, I mean, maturity and I are no strangers.
LEADMALE:Alex, who are you kidding? I'm the mature one.
SUPMALE:You? You don't even know - Oh, come on, guys.
SUPFEMALE:June's trying to tell us about her trip.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, the more I was on my own, I found that I think Mom and Dad know that they don't have to worry about my being responsible even when they're not home.
LEADFEMALE:That's because I'm in charge when they're not home.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, and he always does a great job.
SUPMALE:So, uh, nobody else is home, then? Nope, just you and me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should leave.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I made her do it, Alex I'm an animal.
LEADMALE:I don't deserve to live.
LEADMALE:Where's Jennifer? I thought she was with you.
LEADFEMALE:I got caught up in the moment.
SUPMALE:I-I couldn't control myself.
SUPMALE:Jeff.
LEADMALE:I'm not usually like this but when I'm around Mallory, I go crazy.
SUPMALE:Jeff, calm down, we've got other problems here.
SUPFEMALE:I lost Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you took her to the card game with you! I-I did, but-but while I was playing, she just wandered off.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Mom and Dad came to the card game to get her.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:They're right behind me.
LEADFEMALE:I had to drive on the sidewalk to beat them home.
LEADMALE:Maybe Jennifer came home and she's upstairs sleeping.
OTHERMALE:I hope you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll look.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I kind of told my parents that Jennifer was with you, so I'd appreciate it if-if you'd Lie.
SUPFEMALE:That about says it, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, Alex, if you want me to.
SUPFEMALE:Look, if Jennifer's not home, maybe you and I should go look for her.
OTHERMALE:We both got cars.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeff, thank you for your support.
SUPMALE:I'm glad you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Not at all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're certainly not the two I expected to see on the couch.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that was real responsible, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Losing Jennifer in a card game? I had a straight flush I mean, what would you do? All right, okay, I got a little carried away.
OTHERMALE:I believe June was trying to tell us about her trip.
LEADFEMALE:What trip? Oh, right, right, well.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, the second day I was there, I met this terrific guy.
LEADFEMALE:I've got his picture right here, he's so Okay, all right, I admit I should've been thinking a little more about Jennifer, but it was a momentary lapse.
SUPMALE:I mean, I matured a lot since then.
LEADMALE:In fact, in some ways I'm so mature that I've outgrown a lot of people my own age.
OTHERFEMALE:You've been wondering about my age all evening, haven't you, Alex? Oh, no, your age? No, your age never-never entered my mind.
LEADMALE:How old do you think I am? Oh, I don't know, uh I'd say about years old.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be 40 in July.
SUPMALE:I'll be 29 in March.
LEADFEMALE:My, my and still in high school.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm a veteran, you know.
OTHERMALE:Okay, I'm-I'm 17.
LEADMALE:But they've been 17 very full years.
SUPMALE:Alex, chronological age means nothing to me.
LEADMALE:I like that in a woman.
SUPMALE:Hey, you want to dance? I thought you'd never ask.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you're good.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:No, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:No, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mom, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, uh, where's your, um Uh, uh, I-I mean is Is this your Who's this? Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, Dad, this is, uh, Lorraine Ferrar.
LEADMALE:My date.
LEADMALE:She's his date, Steven.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Yes, it-it certainly is nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'll say.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, you kids want to dance? We'll just roll back the rug.
SUPFEMALE:Nope.
LEADMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Do you think so, Steven? Are you talking to me? Oh, no, uh, no, uh, no, no-no dancing for us.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, um Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's good.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:What ever happened to Lorraine, Alex? Ah, Lorraine and I kind of lost track of each other.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I should give her a call.
LEADMALE:Forget it, Alex.
SUPMALE:Ah, that could be her now.
SUPMALE:Hello? Oh, yes, Jennifer, June's here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh All right, I see.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll tell her.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:That was Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:She sends you her best, June.
LEADMALE:She'll be here just as soon as she can.
LEADMALE:Apparently the female fruit fly is not in the mood.
OTHERMALE:What are they going to do, put on some Johnny Mathis records? Chances are.
OTHERMALE:Look, June, why don't you show us some more pictures? Well, I do have some beautiful shots of Florence.
OTHERFEMALE:Florence who? Mallory, Florence is a city in Italy.
LEADMALE:It's not a person.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, Alex, Florence is a person.
LEADMALE:Florence Weldon.
LEADFEMALE:See, Alex, Florence is not a city in Italy.
OTHERFEMALE:Florence and I went to Paris, and we stayed in this really cute bed-and-breakfast.
SUPMALE:What's a bed-and-breakfast? A bed is something you sleep in.
SUPFEMALE:Breakfast is something you have in the morning.
LEADMALE:It's like a small hotel, Mal.
OTHERMALE:In Europe, a lot of people rent out rooms in their houses.
SUPMALE:Oh, we were there during the tourist season, so, I mean, it got pretty wild.
LEADFEMALE:Some nights, we had 50 people staying in the house.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:I guess that doesn't happen too much here in Ohio.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't know about that.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you don't mind.
SUPFEMALE:I invited a few people.
SUPMALE:Uh, mind? As a matter of fact All right, okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, what are you doing? We did it.
OTHERFEMALE:We captured the other team's mascot.
SUPMALE:We got the Crawford Kangaroo.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Can you believe this? They captured the Crawford Kangaroo.
SUPMALE:This is a day we will never forget.
LEADMALE:I'm home.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:How was your trip? It's so nice to see you.
LEADFEMALE:What is going on here? Now, Dad, uh don't go jumping to any conclusions.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa! Alex, Parents are conditioned to accept a a-a few, uh, minor problems when they leave their children alone at home spilled milk on the rug, a broken dish.
SUPFEMALE:There was a kangaroo in my living room.
LEADMALE:It was just here for the party, Dad.
LEADMALE:Then I guess I'm overreacting.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, if you just give us a chance, we can explain everything.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, can you? Can you explain the valet parking in the driveway? The flashing vacancy sign in front of the house? The billboard on Route 41? Look, Dad, I just, I-I just lost my head, you know? When the when the money started rolling in, I got out of control.
LEADMALE:I-I could smell it.
SUPMALE:I could taste it.
LEADFEMALE:I could hear it, calling me at night, saying, "Alex, at last we'll be together.
OTHERFEMALE:" Dad, I-I guess you could just say that I-I kind of became a a money-holic.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I need help.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, uh, you left me in charge, and I let you down in every possible way.
OTHERFEMALE:I was immature, I was irresponsible, and, uh, and I was greedy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:He's coming around.
SUPFEMALE:For months Steven would wake up in the middle of the night screaming about kangaroos.
OTHERMALE:Well, Pop, I-I bet you look back on that whole incident now and laugh.
LEADMALE:Uh, I think we've all become a lot more responsible since then.
LEADMALE:It's because your father and I have set such a good example.
LEADMALE:Yes, we've taught you to think clearly and rationally before you act.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Ruben Tedesco.
SUPFEMALE:Your children call me Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Tedesco.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should, too.
SUPFEMALE:I teach European literature.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't belong in this classroom, don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:Neither do most of your children.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to make this an open forum.
LEADMALE:I'll answer any intelligent questions you may have.
SUPMALE:Well, I was wondering - Hands please.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, the lady in the front row.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Tedesco - Not you.
LEADFEMALE:The one next to you, the old bag.
LEADMALE:Why do you give out so much homework? I said intelligent questions.
OTHERFEMALE:Next.
SUPMALE:Yes, you.
LEADFEMALE:My son, he says you pick on him.
OTHERFEMALE:You call him names.
OTHERMALE:Who's your son? Larry Morgan.
SUPFEMALE:Larry the Loser? Madame, your son is an insipid pimple-faced liar.
OTHERMALE:Anyone else? Please identify yourself.
OTHERMALE:I'm Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Binney.
SUPFEMALE:My daughter, Mindy, so enjoyed reading The Little Prince.
OTHERMALE:Is there anything else you'd recommend for her? Yes, I'd recommend she lose 40 pounds.
LEADFEMALE:You could lose 30 yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Next? My, my, such an inquisitive bunch.
LEADFEMALE:I have something to say.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Tedesco, I think you owe Mrs.
LEADMALE:Binney and everyone else in here an apology.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:You-you've been terribly rude and insulting to us all.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, it's clear that your son does not get his intelligence from you.
LEADMALE:If you feel I'm being insulting, fine.
LEADFEMALE:I won't insult anyone anymore.
LEADMALE:This little get-together is over.
LEADFEMALE:I'm leaving.
LEADMALE:Sorry, the game is over.
SUPFEMALE:Let me through.
LEADFEMALE:Don't push me.
LEADMALE:Move it, Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:You can't do that.
SUPFEMALE:Who's gonna stop me? I came to apologize for my wife's behavior.
LEADMALE:She feels terrible about the whole thing.
OTHERMALE:She's really sorry.
LEADMALE:We both are.
LEADFEMALE:I could sue, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Look, uh, look, let-let-let-let's try to gain some perspective on the situation here.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, haven't you ever done something without thinking, something you regretted later? Yes, I showed up for parents' night.
LEADFEMALE:Look, look, I know you're upset and you have every right to be.
SUPFEMALE:But you're obviously a very intelligent, civilized person who can recognize this incident for what it is.
SUPMALE:An aberration.
LEADMALE:And I hope you'll forgive and forget.
LEADMALE:Fortunately, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Keaton, your son inherited your rational temperament.
LEADMALE:For his sake, I will allow myself to be appeased by your words.
LEADMALE:I am nothing if not civilized.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I can see that.
LEADFEMALE:Your wife, however, is an Amazon.
SUPMALE:Part Irish, part French, no Amazon.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean, Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:She's primal.
LEADMALE:Not fully evolved.
OTHERMALE:You must have a tough time keeping her in line.
LEADMALE:Tell me, do whips ever enter the picture? I think I'll be going now.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm curious, what's it like to live with that kind of unbridled she-devil? Good-bye, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Tedesco.
SUPFEMALE:No wait, just one more question.
SUPFEMALE:Does she ever, uh Why, you Now, now, June, I don't want you to get the idea that-that we condone violence.
OTHERMALE:No, no, not at all.
LEADMALE:Yeah, just don't make any sudden moves.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be all right.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Andy.
SUPMALE:What's wrong, honey? We've been doing all the talking.
OTHERMALE:I guess he feels left out.
LEADFEMALE:I know how he feels.
SUPMALE:You know, if Andrew could talk, I bet he'd have a story or two to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, your wife's on television.
LEADFEMALE:She sure does.
SUPMALE:This is my favorite part.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait till you hear the way she hits this one note.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh! Wow, she really nailed it that time.
SUPFEMALE:Don't stop, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Why did she stop? I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I think I'm going into labor.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, that-that explains it.
SUPMALE:Labor? Steven, are you watching? Of course I am.
LEADMALE:This is it.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Steven, if you're watching, meet me at the hospital.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'll be there in 15 minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Be there in ten minutes.
SUPMALE:Ten minutes, and I'll get your suitcase.
LEADMALE:And don't forget my suitcase.
LEADMALE:Stop nagging.
LEADMALE:I'm coming.
SUPFEMALE:Steven! - Come on, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Go! - Hurry.
OTHERMALE:Steven! Okay, now, let's give June a chance.
SUPMALE:We've been doing all the talking ourselves.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I really do want to see what London looks like.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, it's pretty much what you would expect, except that people drive on the wrong side of the street.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mal, you'd fit right in.
LEADFEMALE:June, we're all going to be quiet now, so you can tell us about your trip.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay, when I first got to London, - it was really foggy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, June.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, hi.
LEADMALE:It's nice to see you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it's good to see you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you look great.
OTHERMALE:Oh, so do you.
LEADFEMALE:Did I miss much about your trip? Oh, no, not a word.
LEADMALE:Well, I want to hear everything.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, now, no more interruptions.
LEADFEMALE:Well, anyway, as I was saying, when I first got there, I met this really terrific guy.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, you should meet this guy Adam.
LEADMALE:He's really smart and cute and funny.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, Jennifer, we don't want to hear about it, okay? I want to hear about Margaret Thatcher.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, how did how did Adam do with the
LEADMALE:
