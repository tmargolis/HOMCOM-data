LEADMALE:beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that was great, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:You certainly haven't lost your touch.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so rusty.
LEADMALE:I must have plucked 20 bad notes.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, you didn't.
SUPFEMALE:I counted 23.
LEADMALE:I only counted 19.
LEADFEMALE:That's as high as you can count.
LEADMALE:Listening to you reminded me of the old days.
LEADMALE:Makes me want to go out and boycott some lettuce.
LEADMALE:Did you know she was a folk singer? I wasn't really a folk singer.
LEADFEMALE:Occasionally, I picked up a guitar.
LEADMALE:Don't be so modest.
LEADMALE:Your mother used to perform every Thursday night.
SUPMALE:It was in a tiny, jam-packed, smoke-filled coffee house two floors underground.
SUPMALE:The age of darkness cafe.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like a fun place.
OTHERFEMALE:Wednesday was anarchist night.
SUPMALE:People in favor of violent overthrow of the government got a free cocktail.
LEADMALE:Hey, you remember that time we came there after the rally Don't get started.
LEADFEMALE:We've got to go.
LEADMALE:She's got a point.
LEADFEMALE:You could have made a career out of singing.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you pursue it? I had a family to raise, another career to build.
OTHERFEMALE:Singing was never more than a hobby.
SUPMALE:I did have a decent following.
SUPMALE:Everybody thought you'd be the next Judy Collins.
LEADFEMALE:You sing great, mom.
LEADMALE:I bet you could have been the next Joan Collins.
LEADFEMALE:Judy Collins, and your dad's exaggerating.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, he isn't.
LEADMALE:You were really something special.
SUPMALE:The world gained an architect, but lost a great singer.
SUPMALE:Maybe you could have combined them and been the singing architect.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, to watch a great mind at work.
LEADFEMALE:I just got an idea.
LEADMALE:Andy and I went to a nightclub called the top spot.
LEADMALE:It's no age of darkness cafe, but it was fun.
LEADMALE:Maybe we could go sometime.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds good.
LEADMALE:Ahem.
LEADMALE:We've got to go.
LEADMALE:The timekeeper.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Good seeing you.
LEADMALE:Good-bye.
LEADMALE:And you, baby, time for bed.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:You were great.
LEADMALE:Will you tuck me in? I'll tuck you in.
LEADMALE:I'm going to bed early, too.
SUPMALE:Alex is giving me a driving lesson tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to work on opening the car door.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I want to actually drive.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mallory, you may be carrying packages sometime.
LEADMALE:Ever think of that? Opening the car door is not always easy.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:It's a pleasure to be here tonight.
SUPMALE:Ah, you're a beautiful audience.
SUPMALE:hi, mal.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:How did the driving lesson go? Great! I think I'm a natural-born driver.
LEADMALE:Where's Alex? How did the lesson go? I thought I'd never see this house again.
SUPMALE:Oh, Alex, don't be so melodramatic.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:It's not your fault.
LEADFEMALE:I assumed that when you saw a sign marked "stop," you'd take it at face value.
OTHERFEMALE:I told you, I didn't see the sign.
LEADMALE:How could you? You were going in reverse.
LEADMALE:It couldn't have been that bad.
SUPFEMALE:Alex has no Patience.
SUPMALE:He was yelling at me the whole time.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't yelling at you.
SUPMALE:I was yelling at a cop to shoot at our tires.
LEADMALE:You're not being very helpful, Alex.
LEADMALE:Mallory needs a patient, tolerant teacher.
OTHERMALE:Will you take me tomorrow, dad? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be glad to.
SUPMALE:You might need this.
SUPFEMALE:What is that? Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:You're late.
LEADMALE:Where have you been? I'm glad you asked that question.
LEADMALE:You going to answer? You won't believe this, but on the way home, I stopped in at the top spot, and I have an audition tomorrow afternoon! Hold down the enthusiasm a bit.
LEADMALE:Honey, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:How are you going to be a singer? Are you going to quit your job? Nobody's quitting any jobs around here.
OTHERMALE:These people got kids to support.
LEADFEMALE:They got a boy to put through college.
LEADMALE:I'm not quitting my job.
LEADMALE:I had such a good time last night that I was thinking how nice it would be to perform again.
LEADFEMALE:In front of people? That's the basic idea.
OTHERMALE:I think you're a great singer, but you're our mother.
SUPMALE:I try to keep a low profile on that.
LEADFEMALE:I thought, what have I got to lose? Your mother is very brave to try this.
LEADMALE:It's important to pursue your dreams, no matter how great the odds against you.
LEADMALE:Like you trying to get a driver's license.
LEADFEMALE:Corky, why don't you try listening? I'm not listening to a dummy like you.
LEADMALE:Hey, corky, I hear you got a new girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Dennis, she's the greatest.
SUPMALE:Her skin is so soft, when I touched her, I only got three splinters.
LEADMALE:When I touched her, I only got three splinters.
LEADMALE:Ok, Dennis.
SUPMALE:You were great.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what about me? Oh, you were Oh, you were You guys crack me up.

SUPMALE:That was so horrible, so frightening.
SUPFEMALE:I should never have done it in the first place.

SUPMALE:Cheering you on, hoping you'd sing another.
LEADFEMALE:Loving your voice.
OTHERMALE:Loving you.
SUPMALE:I loved you so much then, Steven.
