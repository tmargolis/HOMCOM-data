LEADFEMALE:HEY, HONEY.
LEADFEMALE:BOY, YOU'RE UP EARLY.
SUPMALE:YEAH, I WANTED TO GET A HEAD START.
LEADFEMALE:I'M MAKING BREAKFAST.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, WHAT IS ALL THIS? PANCAKES, BACON, EGGS, TOAST? AND FRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE.
LEADMALE:WELL, NOW, I AM VERY IMPRESSED.
LEADFEMALE:THAT'S HARD TO DO WITHOUT A JUICER.
OTHERMALE:IT'S EVEN HARDER TO DO WITHOUT ORANGES.
SUPMALE: WHAT'S THE OCCASION? YOU KNOW, I GOT UP THIS MORNING AND I REALIZED HOW INCREDIBLE IT IS -- ALEX IS A JUNIOR AT LELAND, MALLORY IS A FRESHMAN AT GRANT COLLEGE, JENNIFER IS IN JUNIOR HIGH, AND ANDY STARTS PRESCHOOL TODAY.
OTHERMALE: IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER, HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS FAMILY, HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU, AND HOW UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE THIS YEAR IS GOING TO BE.
LEADMALE:MAYBE WE SHOULD CANCEL THIS BREAKFAST.
OTHERMALE:AH, LET'S LIVE DANGEROUSLY.
LEADMALE:THESE PEOPLE EVER GONNA GO THROUGH MIDLIFE CRISIS? ALEX, JENNIFER, SIT DOWN.
LEADFEMALE:I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT PANCAKES.
OTHERFEMALE:WE'VE GOT EGGS.
LEADMALE:WE'VE GOT BACON.
SUPFEMALE:LOOKS GREAT, BUT THE JUNIOR CLASS IS HAVING A "WELCOME BACK" BREAKFAST.
SUPFEMALE:HOW ABOUT YOU, JEN? WHAT'S IT GONNA BE? EGGS? PANCAKES? I ATE ALREADY, DAD.
SUPMALE:I'VE BEEN UP FOR 3 HOURS.
LEADMALE:I SEE.
LEADMALE:MALLORY! HOW ABOUT SOME PANCAKES? PLEASE, DAD.
SUPMALE:IF I EVEN LOOK AT FOOD TODAY, I'M GONNA BE SICK.
LEADFEMALE:THIS WORKED OUT NICELY.
LEADFEMALE:JENNIFER, ANDY'S READY FOR YOU.
SUPMALE:HE JUST NEEDS HIS HAIR BRUSHED.
SUPFEMALE:ISN'T THAT CUTE? HIS FIRST DAY OF PRESCHOOL.
LEADMALE:YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:MALLORY, YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT SOME BREAKFAST? NO, DAD.
OTHERMALE:IT'S MY FIRST DAY OF COLLEGE.
LEADMALE:I'M VERY NERVOUS.
LEADMALE:MAL, YOU GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
LEADFEMALE: I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO A REAL COLLEGE.
SUPFEMALE:WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? OH, COME ON.
LEADFEMALE:HOW CAN YOU GET NERVOUS ABOUT GOING TO A COLLEGE THAT ADVERTISES IN HOT RO MAGAZINE? THAT'S NOT TRUE, ALEX.
SUPMALE:OH, COME ON, MAL.
LEADFEMALE:I SAW THE AD.
LEADMALE:"GRANT COLLEGE INTRODUCTORY OFFER -- BUY ONE SEMESTER, GET THE REST FREE.
LEADMALE:" THEN THERE'S THAT RADIO SPOT -- "AT GRANT COLLEGE, WE HAVE A MODERN LIBRARY, "FULLY QUALIFIED PROFESSORS, AND THICK, JUICY STEAKS COOKED JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE THEM.
LEADMALE:" ALEX, GRANT COLLEGE IS A VERY FINE SCHOOL.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S VERY HARD TO GET IN.
SUPFEMALE:HELLO, FELLOW GRANT COLLEGE FRESHMAN! LOOKS LIKE IT'S EVEN HARDER TO STAY OUT.
LEADFEMALE:SKIP, HOW ABOUT SOME BREAKFAST ON YOUR FIRST DAY AT GRANT COLLEGE? NO, NO, NO.
LEADFEMALE:THANK YOU, MR.
LEADMALE:KEATON.
LEADFEMALE:NO, I'M SAVING MY APPETITE FOR THOSE THICK, JUICY STEAKS.
LEADFEMALE: OH! HEY! 
SUPMALE:HI! HEY.
OTHERMALE:DOES THIS TIE GO, ALEX? "DOES THIS TIE GO"? YOU LOOK LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.
LEADFEMALE:TAX-FREE.
LEADFEMALE: IS IS TOO LATE TO TAKE ANDY TO THE WOODS AND HAVE HIM RAISED BY WOLVES? COME ON, DAD.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW HOW LONG I HAD TO WAIT TO HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER? WHAT I HAD TO ENDURE? I'M JUST EXCITED, THAT'S ALL.
LEADFEMALE:COME ON, ANDY.
LEADFEMALE:DO YOU WANT TO WAVE GOODBYE TO YOUR SISTER ON HER FIRST DAY AT COLLEGE? IT'S NOT A REAL COLLEGE.
OTHERFEMALE:WHERE'S ANDY? HE'S UPSTAIRS TAKING A NAP.
SUPFEMALE:AHH.
LEADFEMALE:I WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW HIS FIRST DAY AT PRESCHOOL WAS.
LEADMALE:I CALLED THERE THREE TIMES.
SUPMALE:EVERY TIME I CALLED, THEY SAID IT WAS NAP TIME.
OTHERMALE:WELL, HE'S UPSTAIRS TAKING ANOTHER NAP NOW.
OTHERFEMALE:I GOT TO TALK TO THIS KID.
SUPMALE:HE'S SLEEPING HIS LIFE AWAY.
OTHERMALE: 
OTHERMALE:HI.
OTHERMALE:GUYS, HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY OF COLLEGE? JENNIFER, IT WAS SO EXCITING.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM HIGH SCHOOL.
LEADMALE:I'M TAKING THIS AMAZING PHILOSOPHY COURSE.
OTHERFEMALE:WE TALKED ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH, THE NATURE OF REALITY, AND THE EXISTENCE OF BEING AND NON-BEING.
OTHERMALE:I MEAN, THIS COULD CHANGE THE WHOLE WAY I DRESS.
SUPMALE:HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY, SKIP? NOT QUITE AS GOOD.
SUPMALE:DUE TO A COMPUTER ERROR, I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY AT THE REGISTRAR TRYING TO PROVE THAT I'M NOT A LABORATORY RAT.
LEADMALE:WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL? I HAVE TO GO BACK TOMORROW WITH MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
SUPFEMALE:YOU KNOW, JENNIFER, I THINK PHILOSOPHY MAY BE MY TRUE CALLING.
LEADMALE:THERE ARE JUST SO MANY INTERESTING QUESTIONS.
LEADFEMALE:TODAY, THE PROFESSOR ASKED, "WHAT PROOF DO I HAVE THAT I REALLY EXIST?" SHOW HIM YOUR PHONE BILL.
LEADFEMALE: LAUGH IF YOU WANT, ALEX, BUT I HAVE STARTED MY FIRST PAPER.
LEADMALE:"I SHOP, THEREFORE I AM.
LEADMALE:" IT'S ONLY A FIRST DRAFT, TOO.
LEADMALE:WELL, LET'S GO TO THE MALL AND DO SOME RESEARCH ON THE PAPER.
SUPMALE:THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, JEN.
LEADFEMALE:YOU'RE GONNA DO REALLY WELL IN COLLEGE.
OTHERMALE:OH, HEY.
LEADMALE:IS ANDY ASLEEP YET? 'CAUSE I WANT TO ASK HIM -- OH, HE IS OUT LIKE A LIGHT, HONEY.
SUPMALE:HE'S HAD A VERY FULL DAY.
SUPFEMALE:I'M A LITTLE SLEEPY MYSELF.
SUPFEMALE:I'VE GOT A BIG DAY ON CAMPUS TOMORROW.
LEADMALE:I HAVE TO RUN THROUGH A MAZE AND RING A BELL TO GET A PIECE OF SWISS CHEESE.
OTHERMALE:YOU CRAZY COLLEGE KIDS.
SUPMALE:SO, UH, ANDY LIKED PRESCHOOL, HUH? OH.
OTHERFEMALE:GREAT.
LEADFEMALE:TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.
OTHERFEMALE:WELL, HE, UH, WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS AT FIRST.
SUPMALE:YEAH, WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
LEADMALE:THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.
LEADFEMALE:BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES, HE STARTED TO ENJOY HIMSELF.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, WHAT WERE HIS FAVORITE SUBJECTS -- FINGER PAINTING, BLOCKS, SUPPLY-SIDE ECONOMICS? I THINK HE SAID THAT THE PART HE LIKED BEST WAS SHARING TIME.
SUPMALE: OH.
LEADFEMALE:SHARING TIME? WHAT'S THAT? ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SCHOOL IS TO TEACH KIDS THAT SHARING IS FUN.
SUPFEMALE:SO, EVERYTHING IS SHARED EQUALLY.
LEADMALE:ALL THE TOYS IN THE ROOM BELONG TO THE GROUP, AND THEY'RE CONSIDERED COMMUNAL PROPERTY.
SUPFEMALE:WHAT IS THIS, THE KARL MARX PRESCHOOL? THE HARPER SCHOOL PROGRAM TEACHES KIDS TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER -- TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES.
OTHERMALE:THEY EVEN HAVE THIS METHOD OF ENCOURAGING THE CHILDREN WHO ARE A LITTLE SHY.
LEADFEMALE:THEY GIVE THEM PATCHES TO WEAR THAT SAY, "I KNOW HOW TO SAY GOODBYE" OR "I KNOW HOW TO NAP" OR "I KNOW HOW TO SPEAK IN SENTENCES.
LEADFEMALE:" SOUNDS LIKE AN INSANE ASYLUM.
LEADMALE:PRESCHOOL IS SUPPOSED TO PREPARE ANDY FOR REAL LIFE.
OTHERMALE:IN A COUPLE YEARS, HE'S GONNA BE OUT THERE IN THE DOG-EAT-DOG WORLD OF KINDERGARTEN.
LEADMALE:HE'S GOT TO BE READY.
LEADMALE:HE'S GOT TO BUILD HIS CHARACTER, SHARPEN HIS MENTAL SKILLS, IMPROVE HIS PHYSICAL ENDURANCE.
LEADMALE:SO BASICALLY, YOU'RE SUGGESTING A MILITARY PRESCHOOL.
OTHERMALE:I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE ANDY ON THE STREET WITH A PATCH THAT SAYS, "I KNOW HOW TO SAY GOODBYE.
SUPMALE:" OKAY, ANDY.
SUPFEMALE:HERE'S YOUR LUNCHBOX.
LEADFEMALE:NOW, THESE ARE YOUR COLORING BOOKS AND YOUR CRAYONS.
OTHERFEMALE:REMEMBER.
SUPMALE:HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT SHARING? PBHT! THATABOY.
LEADFEMALE:OKAY, NOW YOU JUST WEAR THIS, AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE ANY PROBLEM.
LEADFEMALE:GOOD MORNING, ANDY.
LEADMALE:GOOD MORNING, MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER.
LEADFEMALE:GOOD MORNING, MRS.
SUPFEMALE:KLUGER.
LEADFEMALE:I'M ALEX KEATON, ANDY'S BROTHER.
LEADMALE:I'M MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER, THE DIRECTOR.
LEADFEMALE:RIGHT.
LEADMALE:OH, LISTEN, ANDY, I GOT TO RUN TO CLASS NOW.
OTHERMALE:BUT REMEMBER -- TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT, WE'RE GONNA GET ICE CREAM, THEN I'M GONNA TAKE YOU AND SHOW YOU HOW THE AUTOMATED-TELLER MACHINES WORK.
LEADMALE:OKAY? REMEMBER -- WHO LOVES YOU? ALEX LOVES ME.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU KNOW IT.
LEADMALE:SO, UH HOW'S HE DOING? OH, HE'S A TERRIFIC CHILD.
SUPMALE:HE'S VERY SENSITIVE AND VERY THOUGHTFUL OF THE OTHER CHILDREN.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, I CAN'T HELP THAT.
LEADMALE:IT'S MY PARENTS' INFLUENCE.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, ANDREW TALKS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME, ALEX.
OTHERFEMALE:OH, REALLY? YEAH.
LEADMALE:HE MENTIONS YOUR NAME SO OFTEN, YOU'D THINK SOMEONE WAS PAYING HIM TO TALK ABOUT YOU.
SUPMALE:MRS.
SUPMALE:KLUGER, DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AROUND HERE? OH, NO.
LEADFEMALE:FEEL FREE.
SUPFEMALE:WE ENCOURAGE VISITORS.
LEADMALE:WE'RE COMPLETELY OPEN AND FREE HERE.
OTHERFEMALE:THAT'S NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT.
SUPFEMALE:SO, THIS IS THE LIBRARY.
OTHERFEMALE:YEAH.
OTHERFEMALE:AND WE TRY TO FILL IT WITH COLORFUL, INTERESTING BOOKS.
SUPFEMALE:WE'VE GOT, UH, OH, "CHARLIE GOES TO SCHOOL," "A SNOWY DAY," "THE CURIOUS COW.
LEADMALE:" YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:WE'VE GOT THAT ONE AT HOME.
LEADFEMALE:MALLORY'S READING IT.
LEADMALE:MY SISTER.
LEADFEMALE:OH.
LEADFEMALE:YOU'VE ALSO GOT A SISTER IN PRESCHOOL? NO, MALLORY COULDN'T GET INTO PRESCHOOL SO SHE'S GOING TO GRANT COLLEGE.
LEADMALE:HI, MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER.
SUPFEMALE:HI, MICHAEL.
LEADMALE:WHAT DOES YOUR PATCH SAY? "I KNOW HOW TO SAY GOODBYE TO MY DADDY.
LEADFEMALE:" VERY GOOD, SWEETIE.
SUPFEMALE:ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL, ALEX? WHAT'S SO WONDERFUL ABOUT THAT? I KNOW HOW TO SAY GOODBYE TO M DADDY.
LEADFEMALE:YOU DON'T SEE ME WEARING A PATCH.
OTHERMALE:WELL, WE TRY TO ENCOURAGE MICHAEL.
SUPFEMALE:HE'S VERY SHY.
LEADFEMALE:THIS GIVES HIM A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT.
SUPMALE:WELL, I'M ALL FOR CREATING A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT, MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER.
LEADFEMALE:I JUST QUESTION YOUR METHODS.
OTHERMALE:OH.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? WELL, HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT DIVIDING THE CHILDREN INTO DIFFERENT PLAY GROUPS, GIVING THEM I.
LEADMALE:Q.
LEADFEMALE:TESTS? WELL, ALEX, WE'RE TRYING TO FOSTER A NONCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.
LEADMALE:OH, COME ON, MRS.
LEADFEMALE:KLUGER.
LEADFEMALE:JOIN US IN THE REAL WORLD HERE.
LEADFEMALE:DO YOU SEE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE NONCOMPETITIVE? PEOPLE SHARING? PEOPLE TAKING NAPS ON MATS? STEVEN AND ELYSE KEATON ARE YOUR PARENTS? OH, MRS.
LEADFEMALE:KLUGER, I GOT TO GO.
SUPMALE:UH, I'M JUST GONNA SAY GOODBYE TO ANDY, AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY.
LEADFEMALE:SURE.
OTHERFEMALE:HE'S OVER THERE, PLAYING HOUSE.
SUPFEMALE:NO, NO.
LEADMALE:THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
OTHERMALE:ANDY DOESN'T PLAY HOUSE.
LEADMALE:WELL, OF COURSE HE DOES.
SUPMALE:SEE HIM DIAPERING THAT DOLL? HE'S DIAPERING A DOLL? ANDY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DIAPERING A DOLL.
SUPMALE:WHERE'S YOUR WIFE? OUT WORKING.
LEADMALE:WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
LEADFEMALE:LET'S GO.
LEADMALE:LET'S GO.
SUPMALE:TODAY WAS THE FIRST DAY I REALLY FELT LIKE A REAL COLLEGE STUDENT.
SUPMALE:OF COURSE, TODAY WAS THE FIRST DAY I WASN'T GETTING SHOCKED FOR RUNNING AGAINST THE TRAFFIC IN OUR MAZE.
SUPMALE:SKIPPY, DO YOU MIND? I'M TRYING TO DO SOME WORK HERE.
SUPFEMALE:I'M SORRY, MAL.
LEADMALE:IT'S JUST SUCH A GREAT FEELING TO BE HUMAN AGAIN.
OTHERMALE:WAIT A MINUTE! YOU JUST GAVE ME A GREAT IDEA.
LEADMALE:I DID? MY NEXT ASSIGNMENT IN PHILOSOPHY IS TO PICK SOMEONE AND TRY TO PROVE THEY EXIST.
OTHERFEMALE:I MEAN, I CAN DO THAT ON YOU.
LEADMALE:WOW! WHAT A CHALLENGE! YEAH, IF I COULD PROVE YOU EXIST, I'D DEFINITELY GET AN "A.
LEADFEMALE:" AND YOU'D BE ABLE TO SETTLE A BET I HAVE WITH MY GRANDFATHER.
LEADMALE:WHOA, WHOA, MALLORY.
SUPFEMALE:DO YOU HAVE TO WORK HERE? WE COULD REALLY USE THIS SPACE.
SUPFEMALE:OH, NO, NO.
LEADMALE:YOU CAN'T STOP US NOW, ALEX.
LEADMALE:SEE, MALLORY IS GOING TO PROVE THAT I EXIST.
LEADFEMALE:THAT COULD GET A LITTLE MESSY.
SUPMALE:WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT IN THE KITCHEN, HUH? ALL RIGHT.
SUPFEMALE:ALL RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:OKAY, A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, SKIPPY.
LEADMALE:FIRST OF ALL, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY DISTINGUISHES YOU FROM AN INANIMATE OBJECT? MY ALLERGIES? ALEX, THIS IS CRAZY.
LEADMALE:DON'T YOU THINK MOM AND DAD ARE GONNA FIND OUT THAT ANDY ISN'T IN PRESCHOOL? YEAH, WELL, I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT NOW.
LEADMALE:THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO DEPROGRAM ANDY BEFORE ANYTHING HE LEARNED IN PRESCHOOL SINKS IN.
OTHERMALE:WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO FIRST? OKAY.
SUPMALE:WE'RE GONNA PLAY HOUSE.
OTHERFEMALE:I'M GONNA BE THE FATHER.
LEADMALE:YOU'RE GONNA BE THE MOTHER.
SUPFEMALE:WE'RE GONNA SHOW ANDY HOW A NORMAL FAMILY FUNCTIONS.
LEADMALE:ARE YOU WATCHING, ANDY? YES, SIR.
OTHERFEMALE:GOOD.
SUPFEMALE:HONEY, I'M HOME! HI, THERE, DEAR.
OTHERFEMALE: WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY WHILE I WAS OUT WORKING HARD TO SUPPORT YOU? I HAD AN AFFAIR WITH THE MILKMAN.
LEADMALE:THAT'S VERY FUNNY, DEAR.
LEADFEMALE:DOES THAT MEAN YOU DIDN'T MAKE ANY DINNER FOR YOUR HUSBAND, EVEN THOUGH I WAS SLAVING AWAY AT THE OFFICE? AT LEAST YOU GET PAID.
LEADFEMALE:HOUSEWORK IS JUST AS TOUGH AS YOUR JOB, AND I DON'T GET A DIME.
LEADFEMALE:I WANT A DIVORCE! ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER.
OTHERMALE:IF YOU CAN'T PLAY NICELY, LET'S NOT PLAY AT ALL, OKAY? THAT'S ALL RIGHT, ANDY.
LEADFEMALE:WE DON'T NEED HER.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, ALEX.
LEADMALE:HEY! THERE'S MY GUY.
SUPMALE:HI, SWEETIE.
SUPFEMALE:HI.
SUPMALE:HEY, WHAT'S, UH -- WHAT'S THIS PATCH? UH, THAT'S NOTHING.
LEADFEMALE:"I KNOW HOW TO ITEMIZE DEDUCTIONS.
LEADMALE:" BOY, THEY'RE REALLY MOVING AHEAD QUICKLY THERE.
OTHERMALE:MOM, DAD, SIT DOWN.
LEADMALE:SOMETHING VERY BAD IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOW.
LEADFEMALE:JUST HEAR ME OUT BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING, OKAY? OH, THIS IS WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.
LEADFEMALE:ANDY WITHDREW FROM PRESCHOOL TODAY.
SUPMALE:WHAT? AND I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
LEADFEMALE:I ADMIRE HIM FOR IT.
LEADFEMALE:OKAY.
SUPFEMALE:ALL RIGHT.
OTHERMALE:ALL RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:ANDY DIDN'T WITHDRAW.
LEADMALE:I WITHDREW HIM.
SUPFEMALE:BUT THAT PRESCHOOL WASN'T FOR HIM.
LEADMALE:HE WAS PICKING UP A LOT OF BAD HABITS THERE.
OTHERMALE:ALEX, THE HARPER PRESCHOOL IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE AREA.
SUPMALE:IT'S A HUMANISTIC APPROACH TO CHILD CARE BASED ON AFFECTION, MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING, AND RESPECT.
LEADMALE:GRANTED, YOU HAVE NO REGARD FOR THESE THINGS, BUT OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR SPECIES CLING BLINDLY TO THEM.
SUPFEMALE:I'M GONNA CALL MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER.
SUPMALE:THERE'S NO WAY SHE COULD'VE TAKEN ANY OF THIS SERIOUSLY.
LEADMALE: ALL RIGHT.
LEADMALE:LOOK, I'M SORRY THINGS TURNED OUT THE WAY THEY DID.
LEADMALE:BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING.
LEADFEMALE:I ONLY DID WHAT I DID 'CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS BEST FOR ANDY.
LEADFEMALE:I LOVE THAT KID.
SUPFEMALE:I'D NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT HIM.
SUPMALE:ALL RIGHT, ALEX.
LEADFEMALE:BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING.
LEADFEMALE:WE'RE HIS PARENTS, AND THIS IS OUR DECISION.
LEADMALE:YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:WAIT A MINUTE.
LEADMALE:YOU GOT MALLORY.
LEADFEMALE:YOU GOT JENNIFER.
SUPMALE:YOU GOT CARTE BLANCHE ON THEM.
LEADFEMALE:DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
LEADMALE:I'LL EVEN THROW IN SKIPPY IF YOU WANT.
LEADMALE:BUT ANDREW ANDREW'S MINE.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, IF HE THROWS IN SKIPPY STEVEN! GOOD MORNING, ANDREW.
SUPFEMALE:GOOD MORNING, ALEX.
SUPFEMALE: GOOD MORNING, MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER.
OTHERFEMALE:IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU BACK AT SCHOOL, ANDY.
SUPMALE:I THINK MRS.
LEADMALE:KAUFMAN'S WAITING FOR YOU.
LEADFEMALE:GO AHEAD, ANDY.
SUPFEMALE:BE STRONG.
SUPMALE:MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER, I'M, UH, SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.
OTHERFEMALE:I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE, AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU HOW TO RUN YOUR SCHOOL.
SUPFEMALE:I GET A LITTLE EMOTIONAL WHEN IT COMES TO ANDY.
SUPMALE:WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY AND WATCH HIM PLAY FOR A WHILE? ACTUALLY, I CAN'T.
LEADFEMALE:I GOT TO GO.
LEADMALE:THANKS, ANYWAY.
LEADFEMALE:ALL RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:HAVE A NICE DAY.
SUPMALE:OKAY.
LEADMALE:THIS MORNING, WE'RE REALLY GONNA HAVE FUN.
SUPFEMALE:LET'S PRETEND THAT WE'RE GOING TO RUN A LITTLE BUSINESS.
LEADMALE:BUSINESS? NOW, WHAT SHOULD WE SELL? TURTLES! TURTLES.
LEADFEMALE:THE TURTLE MARKET'S BEEN DEPRESSED SINCE '81.
LEADFEMALE:NOW, IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A TURTLE STORE, WE HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH TO SELL THE TURTLES FOR.
LEADMALE:NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK, EVERYBODY? FOR FREE.
LEADMALE:WELL, THAT IS VERY NICE OF YOU, RHONDA.
SUPFEMALE:WE WON'T CHARGE ANYTHING FOR THE TURTLES.
LEADMALE:WAIT A MINUTE.
LEADFEMALE:WAIT A MINUTE.
LEADMALE:AT THAT RATE, YOU'RE GONNA BE OUT OF BUSINESS BY NAP TIME.
SUPFEMALE:UH, WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME, PLEASE? SORRY.
LEADMALE:NOW, WHAT'S THE FIRST THING WE NEED FOR OUR STORE? TURTLES.
SUPMALE: TURTLES! THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, ANDY.
OTHERFEMALE:ONCE WE HAVE TURTLES, I GUESS WE'RE READY TO OPEN UP.
SUPMALE:NO, COME ON.
LEADFEMALE:WAIT.
OTHERFEMALE:LOOK.
OTHERMALE:THERE ARE A MILLION DECISIONS TO BE MADE HERE.
OTHERFEMALE: FIRST OF ALL, WHAT KIND OF TURTLES ARE YOU GONNA SELL? MYSELF, I'D SUGGEST DIVIDING THE STOCK UP IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER -- DISPOSABLE TURTLES? YEAH, YOU KNOW, THE KIND THAT DIE AS SOON AS YOU BRING THEM HOME.
SUPFEMALE:AND THEN, THE OTHER 30%, I'D HAVE THOSE, YOU KNOW, THOSE BIG SEA TURTLES.
LEADFEMALE:FOR SOUPS.
SUPMALE:BUT YOU NEED A STORE MANAGER TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS.
LEADMALE:NOW, WHO WANTS TO BE A STORE MANAGER? OH! I SEE ANDREW KEATON HAS HIS HAND UP.
SUPFEMALE:I LIKE A BOY WITH INITIATIVE.
SUPFEMALE:I GOT AN IDEA.
SUPFEMALE:WE NEED CO-MANAGERS.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, MICHAEL, WHY DON'T YOU AND ANDY BOTH MANAGE THE STORE? GOOD.
SUPFEMALE:GREAT.
SUPMALE:OKAY.
LEADMALE:NOW WE NEED AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN.
LEADFEMALE:RHONDA, YOU EVER DO ANY MODELING? YES, AND I HAVE A DOG.
LEADMALE:LET'S STICK TO BUSINESS, RHONDA.
SUPMALE:OKAY, WE'RE GONNA NEED A PICTURE, A PHOTOGRAPH, OF YOU AND A TURTLE AND A SIGN SAYING, UH, WHAT? WHAT? UH, "WELCOME TO OUR GRAND OPENING.
LEADMALE:COME OUT OF YOUR SHELL SALE.
SUPMALE:" RIGHT? OKAY.
LEADMALE:WE'RE GONNA NEED A SIGN.
LEADMALE:WHO WANTS TO PAINT A SIGN? EXCUSE ME, BUT I WORK HERE.
LEADFEMALE:FABULOUS.
SUPFEMALE:GET SOME PAINTS, WILL YOU? AND, UH SOME RED, WHITE, AND BLUE DECORATIONS.
LEADMALE:OKAY, NOW, WE'RE GONNA NEED A BUSINESS MANAGER TO HELP US AVOID PAYING TAXES.
SUPMALE:WHAT'S TAXES? A TAX IS A TERRIBLE HAIRY LIBERAL MONSTER WITH BIG TEETH.
LEADFEMALE:  AND THE ONLY THING -- THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP THE TERRIBLE TAX MONSTER IS A REPUBLICAN.
SUPMALE:WHO WANTS TO BE A REPUBLICAN? WHOA!  OH.
LEADMALE:WHAT'S ALL THIS? OH, IT'S VERY SIMPLE, ELYSE.
SUPMALE:IF THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL BREAKFAST DIDN'T WORK, WE JUST SWITCH GEARS AND TRY THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL DINNER.
LEADFEMALE:BUT THE KIDS HAVE BEEN BACK TO SCHOOL FOR OVER A WEEK NOW.
LEADFEMALE:SO, THEY'VE HAD TIME TO WORK UP AN APPETITE.
SUPFEMALE:SEE YOU LATER.
LEADMALE:OKAY.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M HAVING DINNER AT CHRISSY'S HOUSE.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU SAID I COULD GO LAST WEEK.
LEADFEMALE:THIS IS A SCHOOL NIGHT, JENNIFER.
LEADFEMALE:SHOULDN'T YOU BE STAYING HOME AND STUDYING? I FINISHED STUDYING.
OTHERFEMALE:AND ANYWAY, I GOT A 98 ON MY FIRST TEST.
LEADFEMALE:I WOULD'VE GOTTEN 100, EXCEPT THAT I PUT MANDALAY DOWN AS THE CAPITAL OF BURMA INSTEAD OF RANGOON.
OTHERFEMALE:AND YOU EXPECT US TO JUST OVERLOOK THAT? HI.
OTHERMALE:HI.
LEADFEMALE:HI.
LEADMALE: HEY, MAL, SKIP.
LEADFEMALE:MALLORY, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD.
SUPFEMALE:AH, THANKS, SKIPPY.
LEADFEMALE:AND DON'T WORRY.
SUPMALE:YOU'LL GET OVER IT.
SUPMALE:WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, I GOT AN "F" ON MY PHILOSOPHY PAPER.
OTHERMALE:I COULDN'T PROVE THAT SKIPPY EXISTED.
LEADMALE:WELL, MAYBE I'LL JUST GO BACK TO THE LAB AND THE OTHER RATS.
LEADMALE:AT LEAST I WAS ACCEPTED THERE.
LEADFEMALE:BYE-BYE.
SUPMALE:WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY, MAL.
SUPMALE:WE'RE PLANNING A BIG DINNER.
LEADFEMALE:UM, I CAN'T, DAD.
LEADFEMALE:NICK AND I ARE GOING TO AN ART EXHIBIT.
LEADFEMALE:IT STARTS IN HALF AN HOUR.
LEADMALE:SEE YOU LATER.
LEADMALE:WELL, HERE WE ARE AGAIN, ELYSE YOU, ME, AND HUGE AMOUNTS OF FOOD.
OTHERMALE:HEY.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, ALEX.
SUPFEMALE:HI, SWEETHEART.
LEADFEMALE:ANDY.
SUPFEMALE:HEY.
LEADFEMALE:HOW WERE YOUR CLASSES? I DON'T KNOW.
SUPFEMALE:I DIDN'T MAKE IT.
SUPMALE:I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY AT PRESCHOOL WITH ANDY.
LEADMALE:WHY? WAS THERE A PROBLEM? HE'S STILL ENROLLED, ISN'T HE? YEAH, HE'S STILL ENROLLED.
OTHERMALE:AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE GOT HIS REPORT CARD TODAY.
LEADFEMALE:"DOESN'T GET ALONG WITH OTHER CHILDREN, HAS A TENDENCY TO TRY TO RUN EVERY ACTIVITY HIS OWN WAY.
LEADFEMALE:" WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE.
LEADFEMALE:THAT'S MINE.
LEADMALE:OH.
SUPMALE:NOHERE'S ANDY'S RIGHT HERE.
LEADMALE:OH.
LEADMALE:OH.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:"ANDY IS A DELIGHTFUL BOY "WHO'S VERY POPULAR WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S A PLEASURE HAVING HIM IN THE CLASS.
LEADMALE:" THAT'S WONDERFUL, ANDY.
SUPMALE:MAYBE I WASN'T COMPLETELY IN THE RIGHT ON THIS WHOLE PRESCHOOL THING.
SUPFEMALE:I MEAN, SURE, THEY DO SOME THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN I WOULD, BUT ON THE WHOLE, THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF LOVE AND AFFECTION THERE.
LEADMALE:WITH THE PROPER SUPERVISION AND THE RIGHT GUEST SPEAKERS, THOSE KIDS COULD LEARN A LOT.
LEADFEMALE:"GUEST SPEAKERS"? I'M GOING TO BE LECTURING THERE ONCE A WEEK.
LEADFEMALE:UH, BY THE WAY, YOU'RE PLANNING ON EATING HERE TONIGHT, AREN'T YOU? OH, DAD, UH, LISTEN.
LEADFEMALE:ANDY AND I WERE GONNA HAVE DINNER ALONE TONIGHT, KIND OF A "BROTHERS EVENING.
SUPFEMALE:" THAT'S ALL RIGHT, ISN'T IT?  FINE.
LEADMALE:FINE.
OTHERFEMALE:I'LL JUST PUT THIS IN THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL FREEZER.
LEADFEMALE:I'LL EAT IT.
LEADFEMALE:YOU'RE GONNA EAT LASAGNA, AND A RACK OF LAMB, ELYSE? WELL, NOT ALL AT ONE SITTING.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, ANDY.
SUPFEMALE:SORRY I RUINED YOUR FIRST WEEK AT PRESCHOOL.
SUPMALE:IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE MY ONLY BROTHER.
SUPMALE:I GET A LITTLE CRAZY WHEN IT COMES TO YOU, 'CAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU ARE DESTINED FOR GREATNESS -- THE SAME WAY THAT JENNIFER IS DESTINED FOR GREATNESS, THE WAY I'M DESTINED FOR GREATNESS, AND, UH, MALLORY'S DESTINED TO BE CARED FOR BY THE STATE.
LEADMALE:BUT YOU CAN GO AT YOUR OWN PACE, OKAY? I'M NOT GONNA PUSH YOU TOO HARD.
SUPFEMALE:IF YOU EVER NEED ANY ADVICE, COME TO ME.
LEADFEMALE:IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING, COME TO YOUR BIG BROTHER, ALL RIGHT? JUST DON'T ASK ME TO BEAT UP ANYBODY FOR YOU, ONCE YOU GET PAST FIVE.
LEADMALE:ALEX LOVES ME.
LEADMALE:YOU BET HE DOES.
SUPFEMALE: LET'S GO GET SOME BURGERS, HUH? OH, ANDY YOU DRIVE.
LEADFEMALE:
