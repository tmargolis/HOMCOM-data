LEADMALE:I can't believe you guys can watch this.
SUPFEMALE:You look ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Half a million people trying to stop a senseless war.
SUPMALE:You find that ridiculous? I'm talking about the outfits.
LEADFEMALE:I'm dying.
LEADMALE:I'm dying.
LEADFEMALE:Promise me you'll never show these when my friends are here.
LEADMALE:Promise, or I'm leaving home right now.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, that was history in the making.
SUPMALE:There were people at every state in the union at that protest.
LEADMALE:What were you protesting, good grooming? Ugh.
OTHERFEMALE:Mommy, you look so pretty, like an Indian Princess.
LEADMALE:That's your father, dear.
OTHERFEMALE:There I am.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:You look almost as pretty as daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, how long ago was that? That was very long ago in a galaxy far, far away.
SUPMALE:All right! Who wants to see the peace corps slides? I bet we've been together for a million years and I'll bet we'll be together for a million more oh, it's like I started breathing on the night we kissed when I can't remember what I ever did before what would we do, baby without us? what would we do, baby without us? and there ain't no nothin' we can't love each other through ooh-hoo what would we do, baby without us? sha-la-la-la ah, you're up early.
OTHERMALE:Uh, yeah.
LEADMALE:I thought I'd get a jump on this.
LEADFEMALE:I promised the emersons I'd have it in by Thursday.
SUPMALE:This is their dream-house project, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? Well, uh There's there's no door connecting this side of the house with the other side.
OTHERMALE:Well, the emersons don't like each other all that much.
SUPFEMALE:It's a little extreme, though, isn't it? Are you kidding? I had to talk them out of putting in a moat.
SUPMALE:I don't think the kids were too impressed with our slide show last night, do you? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, I recognized that glazed look in Alex's eyes Same look I used to get when my father talked to me about the depression.
LEADMALE:Well, I enjoyed them anyway.
SUPMALE:I can't believe how young I looked.
LEADMALE:We all looked young.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you still look the same.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, go on.
LEADMALE:Actually, if anything's changed, it's that you look even better now.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, go on! - No, I mean it.
SUPMALE:There's just something wonderful about the way you look.
SUPFEMALE:I said, "go on.
LEADMALE:" Oh, god.
SUPFEMALE:Are you two pawing at each other again? I don't consider a legitimate display of affection pawing.
SUPMALE:Do you know what pawing is? Of course I know what pawing is.
LEADFEMALE:I'm dating Richard defazio, aren't I? Not anymore.
OTHERMALE:You guys have been married a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Haven't you had enough? I haven't, have you? No.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Ugh! Gross.
LEADMALE:Is this my lunch? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:What's in it? - You'll like it.
SUPMALE:Are there sprouts in here? There are no sprouts.
SUPMALE:Nothing alive? Nothing alive, nothing healthy.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, how do I look? Middle-aged.
OTHERFEMALE:No! Dad, recent studies show you can predict success by the way a person dresses.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, you're a young man.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't be worried about success.
LEADMALE:You should be thinking about hopping on a tramp steamer and going around the world, or putting a pack on your back and heading down to Mexico or south America, anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:The '60s are over, dad.
OTHERMALE:Thanks for the tip.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody know the capital of Iowa? - Des moines.
SUPMALE:-Cedar rapids.
LEADFEMALE:Council bluffs.
SUPMALE:That narrows that down a little.
LEADMALE:Actually, Jennifer, Iowa is the one state that has no capital.
SUPFEMALE:And so you see, it's the responsibility of every American to look after Iowa.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:It's for me.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, just a second.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, it's for you.
LEADFEMALE:Don't talk too long, okay? I'm expecting an important call.
LEADMALE:Who are you expecting a call from? Oh, no one.
LEADMALE:Kimberly blanton.
SUPMALE:Who's Kimberly blanton? Nobody.
LEADFEMALE:She's a super-rich chick at school who drives a yellow convertible and looks like a Barbie doll.
LEADMALE:Alex thinks she might be interested in him.
LEADFEMALE:What are you, the town crier? I have no secrets from my father.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:It's for me.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, it's for you.
SUPFEMALE:It's probably Chrissy again.
OTHERMALE:She's going through a personal crisis.
LEADMALE:Come on, Alex.
LEADMALE:She's not gonna call.
LEADFEMALE:Girls like Kimberly blanton just don't call guys like you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You see, he's been chasing her for three months now, and he hasn't even gotten to first base.
LEADMALE:That's not true.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:I've been chasing her for two months, but we're making progress.
SUPFEMALE:You know, we've begun a dialogue.
SUPMALE:The lines of communication are open, which is more than I can say for the phones in this house.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, you're only 9 years old.
SUPMALE:How much can you possibly have to say? Can you hold on a second, Chrissy? Look, Alex, I may be only 9 years old, but I'm a person, too.
LEADFEMALE:I have a right to speak on the telephone without being harassed by you.
LEADMALE:Get off the phone now.
LEADMALE:I'll call you back, okay, Chris? Mom, did you see that? No, what happened? - Alex hit me.
LEADMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, he really didn't hit me.
LEADFEMALE:But he wanted to.
OTHERFEMALE:I could see it in his eyes.
SUPMALE:Just go on.
LEADMALE:Alex, get a grip on yourself.
LEADMALE:If Barbie's gonna call, she'll call.
LEADMALE:Her name is not Barbie, mom.
OTHERMALE:She just looks like Hello.
SUPFEMALE:May I tell him who's calling? - Kimberly blanton.
LEADFEMALE:Kimberly.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Kimberly, I don't think he's Alex p.
LEADMALE:Keaton here.
SUPFEMALE:Smooth, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Kimberly.
LEADMALE:What a pleasant surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight? Just a minute, let me check.
LEADMALE:Kimberly's coming over to study with me tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Is it all right if she has dinner with us first? Sure, if you want her to.
OTHERMALE:Tonight seems to be clear, Kimberly.
LEADFEMALE:All right, very good.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'll see you at school.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Yahoo! I haven't seen him this excited since Reagan was elected.
SUPMALE:Hey, what are you doing? I was listening to that.
LEADMALE:That's depressing, dad.
SUPMALE:This is an up night.
OTHERFEMALE:This guy sounds like he's in pain.
SUPMALE:He's supposed to be in pain.
LEADFEMALE:He's a folk singer.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's depressing.
SUPMALE:You know, the house doesn't look that great.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what time is Kimberly coming? Maybe we can have it painted before she gets here.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight's the night, isn't it? Kimberly blanton here in our very own home.
SUPFEMALE:Like a dream.
LEADFEMALE:Very funny.
LEADMALE:She probably just wants to check out your table manners, see if you know what the small fork is for, that kind of stuff.
SUPMALE:Come here, I'll show you what the small fork is for.
SUPMALE:Alex, maybe you're getting a little carried away here.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, if Kimberly doesn't like you or your family for who they are, then maybe she isn't worth caring about at all, don't you think? Are you gonna wear your hair like that or are you gonna put it up? Alex, I changed my mind.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to wear this.
OTHERMALE:Too late.
LEADFEMALE:Too late, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:A deal's a deal.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give you your dollar back.
SUPMALE:That's her.
LEADMALE:Okay, that's her.
LEADMALE:All right, everybody, just stay calm.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, small fork's for salad, right? Right, and the spoon's for soup.
LEADFEMALE:Soup.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, just, uh, act natural.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry I had to answer the door myself.
SUPMALE:Our Butler's off tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell me, Kimberly, uh, what are you studying in school? Oh You know.
SUPMALE:Sounds exciting.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what Kimberly means is that it's the same stuff I'm studying, so, you know, you're probably familiar with it.
LEADFEMALE:So, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think we may sail around the world this summer? I'll be honest with you, Alex.
LEADMALE:It doesn't look good.
SUPFEMALE:Kimberly sailed to the south of France last summer.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds interesting.
LEADMALE:I've always wanted to go there.
LEADFEMALE:What was that like? Well, it was okay.
SUPFEMALE:It's real different, though.
LEADMALE:But I'll tell you one thing, if you're ever going to the riviera, you're gonna have a really hard time trying to find a decent cheeseburger.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thanks for the warning.
LEADMALE:We'll we'll just take our own.
LEADMALE:We went away last summer, too, to Cleveland.
SUPMALE:It was far away and everything.
OTHERFEMALE:We got to take the bus.
LEADMALE:The bus? What do you mean? What my sister means is that, um, we went to visit our grandmother Grand-mÃ¨re.
LEADMALE:Um We we were gonna fly There was a bum on the bus, remember? Jennifer, eat your potatoes.
SUPFEMALE:So, what exactly do you do, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton? Uh, I, uh, m-manage the public television station here in town.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:What a cute job.
LEADMALE:That's the station with all the English shows, right? Well, I-i wouldn't say they're all English.
OTHERMALE:T-there are some.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know.
OTHERMALE:I've watched it once or twice.
LEADFEMALE:But I really miss the commercials.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot, Kimberly.
SUPFEMALE:What is it did you say you're studying? "You know.
LEADFEMALE:" Just the basic college prep courses.
LEADFEMALE:Have you decided what you're gonna major in in college? Well, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:See, I really want to dedicate my life into helping others, and, well, I really want to be a cheerleader.
LEADMALE:I'll get the tea.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, let me give you a hand with that.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do you think? Is she something else, or what? Gee, Mr.
LEADMALE:Emerson, I'm sorry you're not happy with the placement of your wife's bedroom, but that's as far away as I could get it.
SUPMALE:I mean, I did have to stay on the property.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we could try that, but it it would mean going underground.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Give my best to Mrs.
LEADMALE:Emerson.
LEADMALE:Hello? Trouble in paradise? You know what I can't figure out? - What? - The emersons have eight kids.
LEADFEMALE:Either of you guys know anything about Polo? Polo? Kimberly's picking me up any minute now.
LEADMALE:Today's the big tournament for the gray cup Or the blue cup Some kind of cup.
LEADMALE:I was hoping one of you'd at least know the rules.
LEADMALE:Polo?! Never mind.
LEADMALE:I'll just ride the way everybody else does.
LEADMALE:Think maybe he was switched at birth and the rockefellers have our kid? It could be.
SUPMALE:I wasn't gonna tell you, but this morning, I found a copy of the wall street journal under his bed.
SUPMALE:I just had a thought.
SUPMALE:What? Alex is gonna be gone for the whole day, and Mallory's on her way out, too.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you and I go upstairs, put on some old Johnny Mathis albums What about Jennifer? She's still home.
LEADMALE:Give her your mastercharge and let her check into the holiday inn for the weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Shealmost 10.
LEADFEMALE:You two never stop, do you? Don't you knock before you enter someone's living room? Don't you two have any self-control? I mean, it's not even lunchtime.
SUPMALE:I won't be home for dinner.
SUPMALE:There's gonna be a little party after the Polo game.
LEADFEMALE:It's a Polo match, you clod.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe what I have to put up with! Where is the party gonna be? Oh, it's over at the Carlton country club.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, the Carlton is a restricted club.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be with the blantons.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's really neat over there.
OTHERMALE:They got an indoor pool, you can eat on the terrace, and if you get a phone call, they bring the phone right to your table.
SUPFEMALE:That'll come in handy for you in case eliot janeway calls.
SUPMALE:What your father means is that t-the The Carlton country club doesn't have any members that are black or Jewish or hispanic or any other group that didn't come over on the mayflower.
LEADMALE:I just want to go to a party, mom.
LEADMALE:I don't want to change the world.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, is this the Carlton country club? Uh, listen, my name is Steven Keaton, a Uh, no, I'm not a member.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I can hold.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, I-I'm trying to locate my son, Alex Keaton.
SUPMALE:He's with the blanton party.
LEADMALE:N-no, Alex is not a member, either.
LEADMALE:Yes, I can hold.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, that's what I thought it was, too.
LEADMALE:I'll try it out on the highway and let you know.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, thanks a lot.
OTHERFEMALE:Who was that? Uh, one of the mechanics over at the Volvo place.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, which one? Sven.
LEADFEMALE:You have sven's home number? H-he was at the shop.
SUPMALE:I'm thinking of maybe taking the car in for him to have a look at it.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, it's quarter of 10.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you get a discount if you bring it in at night.
LEADMALE:You know how those swedes are.
LEADMALE:They're used to working late.
LEADMALE:Land of the midnight sun and all that.
LEADMALE:Norway is land of the midnight sun.
LEADMALE:Well, they sure fooled sven.
SUPFEMALE:I'd better get down there and tell him.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:That wasn't really sven.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADMALE:I was trying to reach Alex.
LEADMALE:There was something I wanted to tell him.
LEADMALE:Well, can't this wait until he comes home? That's what I wanted to tell him, to come home now.
SUPFEMALE:It's driving me crazy that he's over there, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Steven, I don't like it any more than you do, but Alex is Alex.
LEADMALE:He sees things differently than we do.
SUPMALE:I know he does.
LEADMALE:And I admit, up to now, some of it's been cute.
LEADMALE:I didn't mind the pop quiz on wines the other night.
LEADMALE:And if he wants to have a poster of William Buckley over his bed, that's his own business.
LEADFEMALE:But we have to draw the line somewhere, and I think a restricted club is a good place to draw it.
LEADMALE:Kimberly tells me you're quite a sailor, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, well, I'm okay.
OTHERMALE:You know, I'm no popeye.
LEADMALE:What's your favorite kind of craft? Woodworking.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, I I'm sorry to disturb you.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'd just like can I speak to you for a second, Alex? Uh, hello, Kimberly.
LEADMALE:Hello, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:May I introduce my parents? Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Steve Keaton.
LEADMALE:Preston blanton.
LEADFEMALE:My wife, Emily.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do? - I'm fine, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:There, uh, isn't any trouble, is there? No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that I forgot to tell Alex something.
OTHERMALE:Won't you sit down for a moment, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton? No, really, I can't stay.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Roger, bring a chair for Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, please.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay, Roger.
LEADFEMALE:Don't bother.
LEADMALE:Just for a moment, uh, go ahead, bring it, Roger.
LEADMALE:R-Roger, don't.
LEADMALE:O-o-okay.
LEADFEMALE:You can bring me a chair.
SUPMALE:Excuse us for a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:What's going on, dad? Alex, I want you to come home with me now.
SUPMALE:Not so loud.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:This place makes me mad.
SUPFEMALE:And when I'm mad, I'm loud.
SUPMALE:Now, come on.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to make a scene.
SUPMALE:I think it's a little too late for that.
LEADMALE:I was hoping that you'd come to it yourself, but obviously you don't understand the moral ramifications of your being here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dad, will you just stop it? Don't you understand what this place stands for? It's it's elitist.
LEADMALE:It's it it's exclusionary.
LEADMALE:It boy, these things are great.
LEADMALE:What are they? Rumaki, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Are there any without liver? The bunny hop! Oh, Alex! Come on! Don't hop away when I'm talking to you.
LEADMALE:I guess the parent of the year award is pretty much out the window.
SUPMALE:Well, I wouldn't say you're the top contender, but who knows? I made a big mistake tonight, didn't I? What are you guys doing down here? It's too hard to eavesdrop from the top of the stairs.
LEADFEMALE:Why is Alex mad at you, dad? Well, dad went a little crazy tonight, and I really hurt your brother's feelings.
OTHERMALE:You mean you had a little attack where you can't control yourself and you say things you didn't want to say? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I get those a lot.
LEADMALE:Stay away from the Carlton country club.
LEADMALE:I will.
LEADMALE:I'd like to talk to you, dad, okay? Okay, girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go up.
LEADMALE:Go ahead, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll meet you up there.
LEADMALE:Nice try, kid.
LEADMALE:It was worth a shot anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Before you say anything, Alex, I just want you to know I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Dad, before you say anything more, I just want you to know that that's not enough.
LEADFEMALE:I'll write notes of apology to the blantons and to Kimberly.
OTHERFEMALE:What'd you tell them, anyway? I told them the truth, that you were my dad's twin brother and you escaped from a home.
LEADMALE:Thanks for covering for me.
OTHERFEMALE:You really humiliated me, dad.
LEADMALE:I mean, how could you do that? Alex, it's hard to know when to interfere and when to let you go on your own.
LEADFEMALE:When you were little, it was easy.
LEADFEMALE:Take the poison and put it on a high shelf, give you a safe place to play, and make sure you don't tumble down the stairs.
SUPFEMALE:A-as you get older, it gets harder.
LEADFEMALE:The line between protecting and interfering can get blurry.
LEADFEMALE:I tripped over it tonight, as you may have noticed.
LEADMALE:Well, you were really something out there.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's funny.
LEADMALE:My father, your grandpa Jake, was a very unemotional man, very distant, very proper.
LEADMALE:He was so proper I didn't know he cared.
LEADMALE:He didn't show it.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I overreact because he didn't react at all.
LEADMALE:You understand? Yeah, I I guess.
LEADMALE:Look, Alex, I was wrong to go over there like that, but I hope you understand why I felt so strongly about your being at a restricted club.
SUPMALE:I do, dad.
LEADMALE:But I'm 17 years old.
LEADFEMALE:And when I see Kimberly blanton in a strapless evening gown, I don't look past her for the bill of rights.
SUPFEMALE:Alex I was 17 myself once.
LEADFEMALE:But I had principles.
LEADFEMALE:I had beliefs.
LEADFEMALE:I Well, now that you mention it I do recall working for Nixon for a couple of weeks in 1960.
SUPFEMALE:Richard Nixon? You see T-there was this young republican, Sandra futterman A real fascist, but she wore it well, you know? I I-I-i-i mean, s-Sandra was W-w-well, s-she had a There there was a way she could I get the point, dad.
SUPMALE:I love you, Alex, very much.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes it overwhelms me and I make mistakes, like tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I know there are other fathers who are more in control, more reserved, more adult, but there are none who love their sons more than I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I know you do, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, that's the crazy part.
SUPFEMALE:Even when we were out there bunny-hopping tonight, mad as I was And I was hopping mad I knew.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:But I'm not you, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, we're two different and separate people.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
SUPMALE:Think this kind of thing is gonna happen again? I don't know.
SUPMALE:We're both getting older.
LEADMALE:One of us is bound to grow up sooner or later.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Okay! This should do it.
SUPFEMALE:Ugh! You guys are only going for the weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Napoleon took fewer bags when he invaded Russia.
LEADMALE:Well, we know what happened to him don't we? Are you meeting the davises up there again? -Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Why is it every time you go up to the lake, it's with them? Well, i-it's tradition.
SUPFEMALE:We met Ron and Suzanne when we were all on our honeymoons, and it's just kind of nice to see them every year.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of like an old-timers' baseball game, you know? You don't really remember how to play, but you go through the motions.
SUPFEMALE:All right, i think we're all set.
LEADFEMALE:Four rackets? Well, i-i don't have any idea what Ron is bringing.
LEADMALE:I have to be ready for him.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not gonna get into that competition thing again.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you promised.
LEADMALE:Of course not.
OTHERFEMALE:We worked that out years ago.
SUPFEMALE:Now it's just friendly Survival of the fittest.
LEADFEMALE:If you guys don't get going, you're gonna get stuck in traffic.
LEADFEMALE:We're going.
SUPFEMALE:We're going.
SUPMALE:You have the hotel phone number? You wrote it down in every room, along with numbers for police, fire, doctor, every neighbor in a six-mile radius, and our congressman.
LEADMALE:Sounds good.
LEADFEMALE:Ready to go, Elyse? Yeah, I guess so.
LEADMALE:As ready as I'm gonna be, anyway.
LEADMALE:Hold down the excitement level, dear.
LEADMALE:You don't want to peak too early.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, i-i got to admit I'm kind of nervous about leaving the kids alone.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? You think we're babies? No, no, it's just we've never left the three of you alone before.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, don't worry about a thing.
LEADMALE:We're gonna be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, I'll be in charge.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we were all in charge.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't each of us responsible for his or her own life? Jennifer, i appreciate existentialism, even in a 9-year-old, but since Alex is the oldest, he's in charge.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we go by height instead? Why don't we go by life expectancy? Al.
LEADMALE:Would you knock it off? Look, maybe it's not fair to leave Alex in charge.
LEADMALE:Maybe we shouldn't go.
LEADFEMALE:No! Of course you should go.
LEADMALE:You two deserve this time together.
LEADMALE:And you know something? The more I think of it, the more I begin to realize that Alex is an excellent choice to be in charge.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you both for suggesting it.
SUPMALE:You don't have to lay it on so thick, Mallory.
LEADMALE:We're going.
LEADMALE:We're going.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Take care.
LEADMALE:Call if you need any help, all right? Hey, don't worry about a thing.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Elyse, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Bye! - I love you.
LEADFEMALE:We'll all turn in early tonight.
SUPMALE:I'll probably read the kids a book first, and maybe make them some hot chocolate if it won't get them too excited.
OTHERMALE:Party time! I bet we've been together for a million years and I'll bet we'll be together for a million more oh, it's like i started breathing on the night we kissed when I can't remember what I ever did before what would we do, baby without us? what would we do, baby without us? and there ain't no nothin' we can't love each other through ooh what would we do, baby without us? sha-la-la-la Jennifer.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, what are you doing? Jennifer, what are you doing? I'll bet mommy and daddy are taking pictures of their trip to show us.
SUPFEMALE:I want to show them how we spent our weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Jennifer, that's not a good idea.
LEADMALE:Uh, you see, uh, these two kids are involved in something very delicate.
LEADFEMALE:She's got something in her eye, and he's trying to take it out.
SUPMALE:Is that what you really think they're doing, Alex? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I think we'd better have a little talk.
OTHERMALE:How you doing, Keaton? Nice party.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Eric.
SUPMALE:Alex.
SUPMALE:Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I've got to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:What? What is it? Don't look over my left shoulder.
LEADFEMALE:I told you not to look! Cut it out.
LEADMALE:You're gonna give me whiplash.
LEADFEMALE:The boy over my left shoulder Is that who I think it is? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm not allowed to look.
SUPMALE:Okay, you can look.
LEADFEMALE:But don't be obvious about it.
SUPMALE:Now, is that or is that not Eric morrison? Yeah, that's him.
LEADMALE:You know Eric morrison, and you didn't even tell me?! Will you cut it out? I'm gonna end up in the hospital.
SUPFEMALE:Introduce me to him.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to bother him.
LEADMALE:Alex, he's captain of eight varsity teams.
LEADMALE:He's really cool.
LEADFEMALE:All the girls' parents hate him.
SUPMALE:That is a good recommendation.
LEADMALE:Yeah, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe later.
OTHERMALE:He's coming over here now.
LEADMALE:Hi, Eric.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing, Keaton? Nice party.
LEADMALE:Well, what have we here? Oh, this is nobody, just my kid sister.
SUPMALE:Uh, Mallory Keaton, I'd like you to meet I know who it is.
LEADFEMALE:You're Eric morrison, aren't you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Kind of lucky for me, isn't it? Hello.
SUPMALE:That goes double for me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I was gonna get myself something cold to drink.
LEADFEMALE:Can I get you something? - I'd like a soda.
SUPFEMALE:Not you.
LEADMALE:This is amazing.
OTHERMALE:I mean, this is really kind of scary.
LEADFEMALE:I was just thinking about a nice, cold drink.
LEADMALE:We must be on the same psychic wavelength.
OTHERMALE:Must be.
SUPMALE:Hello, Eric.
LEADMALE:Hey, kitten.
SUPMALE:Hi, Albert.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever.
SUPMALE:You know, this is really a terrific party, Keaton.
LEADMALE:You're a wonderful host, really.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:The way I see it, my biggest problem right now is trying to decide which one of these girls to take for a ride in my new car.
LEADMALE:Well, anything i can do to help.
SUPFEMALE:If you want me to screen a few of them for you, or I think I can handle it, but just remember, when you hear that horn go "owww!" I'm on the prowl.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here we go.
OTHERMALE:Yours is in the kitchen, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:She knows I like to drink my soda in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:So, come here often? You think the kids miss us as much as we miss them? You want the truth? Not necessarily.
OTHERMALE:Well, then I think they miss us terribly.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:I am so glad that we're up here.
LEADMALE:Me too.
SUPFEMALE:I've got great things planned, Elyse.
LEADMALE:So do I.
LEADMALE:I thought we'd start with a short jog for distance.
SUPFEMALE:Then, uh, swimming, doubles tetherball, and ping-pong.
SUPMALE:That should get us warmed up for the volleyball tournament.
LEADFEMALE:We're on vacation, not training for the Olympics.
SUPMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:We'll skip the javelin.
LEADMALE:I-I'm getting worried.
SUPMALE:Ron isn't even here yet, and already you're competing.
OTHERMALE:I'm not! I'm not.
LEADMALE:Well, you'll see.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not like you're here with a couple of kids.
SUPMALE:We're two mature adults.
LEADFEMALE:Well, forgive me for being concerned, but if I recall, your last words to Ron were, "I'm taller than you are, nyah, nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah!" Well, I am.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just kidding.
SUPFEMALE:We we can have a great time without the competition.
SUPMALE:I love their company.
SUPFEMALE:So do I.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I wish they'd get here.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we really beat them here, didn't we? Steven! I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get this stuff put away.
SUPMALE:Uh, not that way, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I moved our stuff into the other bedroom.
LEADMALE:Why? - Why? Because that room is 18x24 and our room is 18x26.
SUPMALE:Steven, no one in the world could tell the difference between those two rooms.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey! - Hey! - What do you say, bear? - How you doin'? - Lobo.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ron.
SUPFEMALE:How are you? Oh, I'm sorry we're late.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:shortcut thought the paved roads might slow us down.
LEADFEMALE:Just wanted to try out the four-wheel-drive vehicle.
SUPMALE:You don't have a four-wheel-drive vehicle, do you, Steven? I'm sure he will by sundown.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:Make yourselves at home.
LEADMALE:First event! Here we go! Oh, uh, uh, not not Not that that one, r-Ron.
LEADFEMALE:Um You've you've got the other bedroom.
OTHERMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Elyse, i had a long talk with Ron on the way up here.
SUPMALE:Lord knows we had the time for it.
OTHERFEMALE:I think the competition thing will no longer be an issue.
SUPFEMALE:Took the big room, didn't you, Keaton? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPMALE:I like fun as much as the next guy.
LEADMALE:But these lights must remain on house rules.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, there's no reason we all can't have good, clean fun with the lights on, okay? Bet we could have more fun with the lights off, Albert.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:Ah, what the hell? There is an energy crisis.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, it's me, Albert Alex.
LEADMALE:Whatever.
SUPFEMALE:Noise? Um, no, I don't I oh, oh, that's the TV.
LEADMALE:There's a commercial for firecrackers.
LEADFEMALE:You you want to talk to Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:Just a minute.
LEADMALE:Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Jennifer.
LEADMALE:It's mom and dad.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you can talk, but don't let them know what's going on here.
SUPMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm no fink.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine, daddy.
LEADMALE:Hi, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, nothing much.
OTHERMALE:I was just taking pictures with my new camera.
SUPMALE:Nature stuff Birds and the bees.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, well, you two must be in a hurry, so I'll just let you go.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Mallory? J-just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, where's Mallory? - She left.
SUPMALE:She left? She couldn't have left.
SUPMALE:She did with some guy.
SUPFEMALE:What guy? Your friend.
LEADMALE:The guy with the Bedroom eyes.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you stop them? They're too fast for me, pal.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Mallory can't come to the phone right now.
OTHERMALE:No.
SUPMALE:She's, uh Insulating the attic.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:It's a surprise for when you get home.
SUPFEMALE:You'll love it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I will.
LEADMALE:All right, bye-bye.
SUPMALE:Owww! Alex! Will you stop pacing? You're making me nervous! When you have kids, you'll understand.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you so upset? She's with your friend.
SUPMALE:That's why I'm so upset.
LEADMALE:You mean he's not a nice boy? Let's just say He might not be a gentleman with Mallory.
LEADMALE:You mean, if he burps, he won't say "excuse me"? Right.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:That's exactly what I mean.
SUPFEMALE:You really feel like it's your fault, don't you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Alex Don't feel so guilty.
SUPMALE:Guilt is a useless emotion.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, just let me feel guilty, all right? That's the way I'm supposed to feel.
LEADMALE:In that case, you blew it with me, too.
SUPFEMALE:You shouldn't have let me have a third bowl of peanut-butter popcorn.
SUPFEMALE:My stomach is killing me.
LEADFEMALE:Is there anything I can do? You could rub my tummy.
LEADFEMALE:That's what mommy always does.
SUPFEMALE:Lift 'em up.
LEADMALE:Ugh! How's this? Mommy usually rubs in circles.
LEADFEMALE:Counterclockwise.
LEADFEMALE:Not bad.
LEADMALE:But it still hurts.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what I was thinking, having a wild party like that.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I'm supposed to be babysitting for you kids, not throwing orgies for you.
LEADMALE:Alex, what's an or Don't ask.
LEADMALE:I try to be a responsible person, but sometimes the human side of me takes over, you know what I mean? I can't deal with it now, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Could you please sing to me? Mommy always sings when I don't feel well.
LEADFEMALE:The only song i know all the words to is "the star-spangled banner.
LEADMALE:" Don't sing that.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have to stand up.
OTHERMALE:I don't know the words to anything else.
LEADFEMALE:Any torch song will do.
SUPMALE:it's quarter to 3:00 there's no one in the place except for you and me set 'em up, Joe.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory! I'm glad you're up.
LEADFEMALE:You know Up?! Of course I'm up.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think i could sleep with With you god knows where doing god knows what with i-know-who.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe you.
LEADMALE:You don't believe me? - Good night, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:"Good night, Alex"?! Oh, no, my dear, you're gonna sit down right now, and you're gonna tell me exactly what you've been doing for the past two hours.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, I don't have to tell you that.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:"Good night"? "Good night"?! "Good night"?! Kids today.
LEADMALE:Buh! Hey, come on, it's just a trophy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't make such a big deal about it.
LEADFEMALE:It just means that we're the best dancers at the resort, that's all.
LEADMALE:It's just one resort.
LEADFEMALE:And there may be dancers somewhere in the world who are better than we are, but they're obviously not at this resort this weekend.
SUPFEMALE:But it's possible.
OTHERMALE:Personally, I thought the band quit a little early.
OTHERMALE:I was glad they stopped when they did.
SUPFEMALE:My feet were getting sore.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Mine weren't.
OTHERMALE:No one was walking on yours.
SUPMALE:I was just trying to get you to dance a little faster.
LEADMALE:It was an up-tempo number, and I thought we had a really good shot at winning.
LEADFEMALE:You got a point total there, Steve? Yeah, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:The dancing was worth 14.
SUPMALE:And you won the, uh, swimming competition, and, uh, Suzanne, the golf driving for distance.
SUPFEMALE:See, I told you that weight training was gonna pay off for you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, we copped the archery and the spelling bee, so For today, you guys are up by 24.
LEADMALE:Overall, we're still ahead by 134 points.
LEADFEMALE:But the evening is still young.
SUPMALE:So, what's next, guys? Skeet shooting? Tag-team wrestling? Or how about the old "who can hold his breath longer and turn blue first" contest? All right, go over those choices again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Come on! Just making a joke, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Some of us aren't laughing, Ron.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Time for monopoly.
LEADFEMALE:Places, everyone.
SUPMALE:I'm the racing car.
LEADMALE:Unh-unh.
LEADMALE:My set.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the racing car.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'm the thimble, then.
LEADFEMALE:Go get my dice, Suzanne.
LEADMALE:They're in the top drawer.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not getting your dice.
LEADMALE:I'm tired of these games.
LEADMALE:I'm tired of sharpening your spikes.
SUPMALE:I'm tired of oiling your glove.
LEADFEMALE:I'm your wife, not your equipment manager.
LEADFEMALE:Ron, I'm going to bed now.
OTHERMALE:If you care anything at all for me, you'd better be right behind me.
LEADMALE:I think, under the circumstances, Steve, we'd better play the short game.
OTHERMALE:Ron, I think you'd better go talk to her.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're probably right.
SUPFEMALE:I got to get my dice, anyway.
LEADMALE:Ron! - I'll set up the board.
LEADFEMALE:Steven! Bet I can make up with my wife quicker than you can make up - Ron! - All right! I don't know what happens to you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
LEADMALE:I really wanted this weekend to be special for us.
LEADMALE:When you say "us," do you mean you and me or you and Ron? Maybe we should stop coming here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I-i thought we could all come up and have a good time.
LEADMALE:I-i thought Ron and i were past it.
LEADMALE:I guess we're not.
LEADFEMALE:You're a different person when you're around him.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:It started on our honeymoon, when they edged us in the newlywed potato-sack race.
LEADMALE:It's just no fun coming up here anymore, and unless you and Ron can work this out, I think this should be our last vacation with the davises.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:Ron and I have been acting like idiots, and it's gonna stop.
LEADMALE:Well, you've said that before.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but I never realized how childishly we were behaving.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess i can forgive you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, how could I act like that here, of all places? This is our honeymoon spot.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I haven't been acting like it, but, uh, this place means a lot to me.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:It means a lot to me, too.
OTHERMALE:Lots of memories, huh? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna talk to Ron tomorrow.
LEADMALE:You know, i-i think it's too early to give up on him.
SUPMALE:You know, underneath it all, he's a very sensitive guy.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure he's capable of having a good time without competing.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's one.
SUPMALE:Mallory, I'd like to talk to you for a second.
SUPMALE:Can you believe that? I'm half out of my mind with worry, and she's mad at me.
SUPFEMALE:It's because you yelled at her.
SUPMALE:Of course I yelled.
LEADFEMALE:I was concerned about her.
SUPMALE:I know that, and you know that.
LEADMALE:But don't you think you ought to tell her that? Communication is so important in a relationship.
LEADMALE:I heard that on "donahue.
SUPFEMALE:" Kitchen's clean.
LEADMALE:I don't know how the bubble gum got in the oven.
SUPMALE:Mallory, I'd like to talk to you.
SUPMALE:Alex, I have nothing to say to you.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna go up and sort my socks.
OTHERMALE:Remember, communication is a two-way street.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, I'm sorry about the way i acted last night.
LEADFEMALE:I was way out of line.
OTHERMALE:You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to tell me.
SUPMALE:You're entitled to your privacy.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:So, what happened last night? - Alex! - Look, Eric's a smooth guy.
LEADMALE:A young kid like you must have been putty in his hands.
SUPFEMALE:I was not putty in his hands.
SUPFEMALE:Just what were you in his hands? Alex, don't you think i have a mind of my own? I mean, I don't let a boy do anything I don't want him to do.
LEADMALE:Should I take that to mean nothing happened? Oh, you could.
LEADMALE:Or you could take it to mean that nothing happened that I didn't want to happen.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's narrow down those options a little.
LEADMALE:Do you realize how insulting you're being? I mean, if I were your brother and you were my sister, you wouldn't be asking me all these questions.
SUPMALE:If you were my brother, Eric wouldn't have been interested in you.
LEADFEMALE:He would've been interested in me.
OTHERFEMALE:And then you'd be standing here asking the exact same questions I'm asking you, because then i would be the girl.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'll tell you something else.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't even have gone out with him.
LEADMALE:So you believe in the old double standard, then, don't you? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, I believe in a triple standard One for girls, one for boys, and one for sisters.
SUPMALE:Eric, what are you doing here? I came to give Mallory these flowers.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, my sister doesn't want your lousy flowers.
LEADFEMALE:And I don't even want her to talk to you.
SUPMALE:So why don't you just go home? Now, why don't you let Mallory decide if she wants to talk to me or not? That's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:After all, Eric came to see me, not you.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:All right, Mallory, take the flowers.
LEADMALE:Take the flowers.
OTHERFEMALE:I just want you to know one thing.
SUPFEMALE:You're breaking your brother's heart.
OTHERMALE:Thank you for the flowers, Eric.
SUPMALE:Mallory, what are you doing? I don't want your lousy flowers.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here, anyway? Well, actually, I came by to give you another chance.
LEADMALE:I mean, obviously you weren't thinking clearly last night.
SUPMALE:I mean, your biorhythms could have been off.
LEADMALE:I'm just not the kind of guy to hold a grudge.
LEADMALE:What you are is an egotistical, conceited jerk.
SUPMALE:I know you think you're charming, but, personally, i think you're obnoxious.
LEADMALE:I never want to see you again.
LEADMALE:In fact, I don't even want to see you now.
OTHERFEMALE:Out, out, out.
SUPMALE:Okay, well, uh I just want you to know i don't have any hard feelings about this at all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that makes one of us.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Um, Mallory, uh, think you could give me back the flowers? I got two more stops to make.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess you really can take care of yourself.
SUPMALE:It's about time you realized it.
LEADMALE:You must have really had a horrible time last night.
SUPFEMALE:It was unbelievable.
LEADMALE:He kept feeding me these corny lines about how he can make me feel like a woman.
LEADFEMALE:I told him I'd feel a lot more like a woman if I weren't with such a little boy.
LEADMALE:Whoa! I'll bet that made him back off.
LEADFEMALE:Nope.
LEADMALE:Then he drove me up to the point.
OTHERFEMALE:And that's where the wrestling match started.
LEADFEMALE:I'll kill him.
LEADFEMALE:You don't need to.
LEADFEMALE:I say it's about two more weeks before his bruises heal.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway I really am sorry about the way I acted.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:You were just thinking of my welfare.
OTHERFEMALE:You were concerned.
OTHERFEMALE:You were overprotective.
SUPMALE:And you were a yutz.
LEADMALE:But I know what you were thinking, Alex, and I appreciate it I really do.
LEADMALE:Mom and dad are never gonna believe this.
SUPFEMALE:They're in the driveway! T-minus 20 seconds! Um, everyone sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Look wholesome.
OTHERMALE:"'And this porridge is just right, ' said goldilocks.
LEADMALE:" We're here! We're home! Oh, we thought you guys wouldn't get along.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, see if the second floor is still there.
LEADFEMALE:So, everything went okay, huh? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:A little quiet but bearable.
LEADFEMALE:Things were fine.
LEADMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:Never better.
LEADMALE:In fact, probably actually perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Shame you couldn't have been here to see it.
LEADMALE:I have pictures.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what are you doing with my paper? I need it, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:We're going to recycle it.
SUPFEMALE:Wait till it's been cycled first, okay? It's this kind of militant behavior that gives you environmentalists a bad name.
LEADFEMALE:Environmentalists don't have a bad name! They do with Alex.
OTHERMALE:The whole idea of recycling is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:It's a waste of time.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Alex, this planet's in real danger.
SUPMALE:There's a limitation to the earth's resources.
LEADMALE:Unless we all do our share, the entire life-support structure is in danger of collapsing and destroying life on earth as we know it.
LEADFEMALE:Grow up, will you, Jennifer? Bad news, kids No sweets, no treats, no meats.
LEADMALE:Lots of yogurt Some stuff from Bulgaria.
LEADFEMALE:It's not from Bulgaria, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:It is bulgur.
SUPMALE:It's a fine grain, and it's rich in vitamins, minerals, and iron.
SUPMALE:Looks like cattle food.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Justin.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Can you stay for dinner? Gee I wish I could.
SUPMALE:Maybe some other time.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? Mrs.
LEADMALE:Perkins? Justin, your mother's not here Why don't you guys just stop calling, okay? Ha ha ha.
LEADMALE:My side hurts from laughing.
LEADMALE:I am not! Am not! So are you! Wrong number.
LEADFEMALE:I thought so.
OTHERMALE:Actually, it's these kids from school.
SUPMALE:They're making fun of us because Jennifer and I like to play together.
LEADFEMALE:They call me Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Perkins, and they sing, * I know Jennifer's boyfriend stupid-heads.
OTHERMALE:I know that kind of teasing can really hurt.
SUPFEMALE:How are you holding up, Justin? Frankly, I'm above it.
LEADMALE:I know that the other kids find it strange that me and Jennifer are such good friends, but we'd be friends no matter what.
LEADFEMALE:The fact that Jennifer's a girl just makes it more exciting to me.
LEADMALE:You're gonna do real well in high school, you know? Well, this will cheer you up, anyways.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a terrific idea for your birthday party.
SUPMALE:If it's your idea, it's going to involve boys.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course it involves boys.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, a bunch of girls sitting around is not a party.
LEADFEMALE:It's a wake.
SUPFEMALE:Now, where did you get an attitude like that? I have a great time when I'm just with my women friends.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's different, mom.
LEADMALE:You're married.
LEADMALE:It's over for you.
SUPMALE:Do me a favor and don't tell your father.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, my idea is to have a '50s party.
LEADFEMALE:Funny music and funny skirts You put grease in your hair, and you look really silly.
LEADMALE:It's neato.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I never heard of the '50s.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Justin.
SUPMALE:Hi, sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
OTHERFEMALE:You got bulgur.
LEADFEMALE:Ugh.
LEADFEMALE:You guys really stick together, don't you? Hello? Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Perkins? Is your mother here, Justin? Just for your information, we happen to be above this, you baby! Says you! Am not! I have a feeling I missed something.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the other kids have been teasing Jennifer because she plays with Justin.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, they've been calling here all afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but they're just jealous, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you have to admit, though, it I a little bit unusual.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, you know, an intersexual relationship at that age.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds unusual at any age.
LEADMALE:Let me get it.
LEADFEMALE:Now, listen.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to have to stop.
OTHERFEMALE:This is our home, and your calling here is childish, it's annoying, and we really don't appreciate the intrusion in our lives.
LEADFEMALE:It's your mother.
SUPMALE:Well, Jennifer's feeling a little better.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's good.
LEADMALE:At least the phone stopped ringing, anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:I think it's gonna be quite a while before my mother calls again.
LEADFEMALE:Apparently, something good has come out of this.
SUPMALE:It's a little sad, though, isn't it? After all that's happened in the past 15 years or so Eliminating sexual stereotypes, improved communication between men and women And, still, don't get along very well.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you play with girls when you were 10? Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:What do I look like, a sissy? That was different.
LEADMALE:That was before "sesame street," before consciousness-raising, before Ms.
SUPMALE:magazine What we men like to refer to as "the good old days.
SUPMALE:" Is that so? Actually, no.
LEADMALE:These are the good old days.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
OTHERMALE:Would you guys cut it out? There are young children in the house.
LEADMALE:I've seen worse.
LEADMALE:Why does this bother you so much? Well, 'cause you guys are old.
SUPMALE:I mean, it's just not something that parents should be doing.
LEADFEMALE:At least those are normal kisses.
LEADFEMALE:Unlike when your friends are here.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer! You should see it.
LEADMALE:They try to bite each other's tongues off.
SUPMALE:Jennifer! It's called Dutch kissing.
LEADMALE:I thought I'd barf.
LEADMALE:I'm going out to get a hamburger.
LEADMALE:I'll come with you.
SUPFEMALE:Where you going? You just had dinner.
LEADFEMALE:No, I just had bulgur, lentils, mixed Greens.
SUPMALE:That's only dinner if you're a heifer or a gerbil.
LEADMALE:You coming, Jen? No, I got to get these papers wrapped.
OTHERMALE:We're going to recycle them tomorrow.
LEADMALE:What are you gonna do with the money you raise? We're gonna donate them to the wildlife preservation fund.
LEADFEMALE:This is your influence.
OTHERFEMALE:You realize that, I hope.
LEADFEMALE:I gather you're against recycling? It's just interfering with the natural order of things, that's all.
LEADMALE:Look, look, a man goes out and he buys something.
LEADFEMALE:He keeps it for a while, he uses it, he enjoys it, then he gets tired of it, he throws it away, and he buys a new one.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, that's nature.
LEADMALE:Thank you, ranger Rick.
LEADFEMALE:See ya.
LEADMALE:So, you excited about your birthday? I guess.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:I've seen you more excited on the way to the dentist.
LEADFEMALE:Mom When you were in 4th grade, were there boys? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Boys were invented when I was in kindergarten.
LEADMALE:They sure make things complicated.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think we really need them? Come on.
LEADMALE:Boys are okay.
SUPFEMALE:What about your daddy? He was a boy once.
LEADFEMALE:I find that hard to believe.
LEADFEMALE:What about Justin? He's a boy, and he's awfully nice.
OTHERFEMALE:That's two in the whole history of boys.
SUPFEMALE:What about Alex? Give me a break! Chrissy says if I'm gonna play with Justin all the time, she doesn't want to be my friend.
SUPMALE:That's what Dana and Maria say, too.
SUPFEMALE:Wait you can't let other people decide who your friends are gonna be.
SUPFEMALE:I know it, but I don't want to lose them.
OTHERMALE:And I still want to be Justin's friend, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hang in there.
LEADMALE:A good friend's hard to find.
SUPFEMALE:A good man's even harder.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Those all sound like good choices.
SUPFEMALE:Elvis? Right.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Chuck Berry? Good.
LEADMALE:Snooky lanson? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:I-it's nothing against snooky, it's just that I don't think we need any more records.
SUPFEMALE:He'll perform live? Uh, no, let's just go with what we've got.
OTHERFEMALE:A-all right.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:We're all set.
SUPFEMALE:The jukebox will have 50 of the biggest hits of the '50s "Earth angel" by the penguins, "heartbreak hotel," Elvis Presley, "twilight time," the platters, "maybellene" by Chuck Berry, and if you call now, we'll include "Eddie my love" by the fabulous teen queens.
LEADFEMALE:You're two minutes too late, kid.
LEADMALE:Mom and dad were really being silly.
LEADMALE:You missed it.
LEADMALE:I'm sure I'll get another chance.
LEADMALE:How'd it go at the recycling center? We unloaded a whole trunk full of newspapers, and that's what they gave us.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of good 77 cents is going to do the bald eagle.
LEADMALE:It won't even buy him a cheap cap.
SUPMALE:You know, I desperately need some loose change.
LEADFEMALE:If you would let me take those coins and take this dollar bill instead, you'd be doing me a very big favor.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I don't have any ones at all.
LEADMALE:And and if you would give me that $1 for this $5, I'd really appreciate it.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I can get you your 77 cents back.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Just kidding.
LEADMALE:I'll talk to you about it later, all right? Hey, wasn't Justin coming home with you? No, they dropped me off.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't you say he was gonna be here for dinner? No.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:I mean, I said it but I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
SUPMALE:Okay, here's the story.
OTHERMALE:Justin's history Yesterday's news.
LEADMALE:AdiÃ³s, amigo.
LEADFEMALE:"Good night, Irene.
OTHERFEMALE:" What are you talking about? Justin was your best friend this morning.
OTHERFEMALE:That was a long time ago, before I knew he was a boy! Oh, I get it.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, this doesn't seem like look, I think I know who my friends are, and he's a boy! He just won't be around anymore, okay? Leave me alone! Score one for peer pressure.
SUPMALE:I can't believe this newspaper.
LEADMALE:What? This headline is incredibly slanted and misleading.
OTHERMALE:They never give the other side.
LEADMALE:"Widowed mother of 12 denied food stamps.
LEADFEMALE:" There's another side to this story? It's just the way they cover it, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:They make it so cold and impersonal.
LEADMALE:"When questioned, the commissioner replied, 'hey, these things happen.
SUPMALE:That's the breaks.
SUPFEMALE:Next case.
LEADMALE:'" you're right.
SUPMALE:They missed the warmth entirely.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Justin called for you four times.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Aren't you gonna call him back? I'll see him at school.
SUPMALE:And if I miss him there, I'll drop him a card.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Everything's set for the party tomorrow Records, posters, pez.
LEADMALE:I can't think of anything else we need.
LEADFEMALE:I can think of something we don't need.
LEADFEMALE:What? Boys! Now, does this have anything to do with the teasing and the phone calls? No.
LEADMALE:I just think we'd have more fun if there were only girls.
LEADFEMALE:When's that line of thinking gonna change? Even if you wanted to, it's too late.
SUPMALE:All the invitations are out, and some of the boys have accepted.
LEADMALE:We could move.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Hello, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Hi, Justin.
OTHERMALE:Bye, Justin.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute! I'd like to talk to you.
SUPMALE:I-I can't.
OTHERMALE:I can't talk.
SUPMALE:I'll see you later.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:That didn't go as smoothly as I'd hoped.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Justin.
SUPMALE:She doesn't want to see me.
OTHERMALE:I think it's just a phase.
SUPFEMALE:You know? I'm sure it'll change.
SUPMALE:She doesn't want to see me because I'm a boy.
SUPMALE:That's not gonna change.
SUPFEMALE:Sure it will.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not the part about you being a boy, but her attitude will change.
LEADFEMALE:What bothers me the most is that I really miss her.
SUPMALE:She's a very special person, and I really feel the absence of her in my life.
SUPMALE:This guy can't be only 9.
SUPFEMALE:Justin, I am sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I-i apologize for Jennifer's behavior.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton, would you mind walking me home? I-I don't really feel like being alone right now.
SUPMALE:I can come along, too, if you'd like.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't mind, I was hoping Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton and I could have a little guy talk.
SUPMALE:What do you say? Sure.
SUPMALE:That's fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:You want to stop somewhere and have a beer? Well Okay, maybe just one.
LEADFEMALE:But if I start acting silly, take me home.
LEADFEMALE:Can we talk? Sure, but not about how dirty my room is, okay? Can we talk about when you're gonna clean it up? There are so many more interesting things to talk about, don't you think? Shouldn't some of this be put away? Simba and I are of the belief that all animals Even stuffed ones Should be allowed to roam free.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm gonna talk to her when I finish talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you were very nice to Justin this afternoon.
LEADMALE:I think you owe him an apology.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'll apologize because I wasn't very nice.
LEADMALE:But that doesn't mean I have to be his friend.
SUPMALE:I have a right to pick my own friends, don't I? But you did pick Justin as a friend, and for really good reasons He's he's thoughtful, he's sweet, he's Don't get carried away, okay, mom? He's not Alan alda.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like being teased, mom People laughing, pointing fingers, putting signs on my back "if found, return to Justin Perkins.
LEADMALE:" I know that's hard, but y-you got to learn to stand up to stuff like that.
LEADFEMALE:It's particularly important for women to be strong in areas like that.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna put the pressure of the whole women's movement on me, are you? No, dear, but I do think it's important for boys and girls to be friends.
LEADFEMALE:That way, maybe when they grow up, they'll know how to be friends as men and women.
LEADMALE:That doesn't happen now? Not a lot.
SUPMALE:Not enough.
SUPFEMALE:How come? There's a lot of role-playing going on Women playing at being all cute and helpless, men playing at being tough and and always in control.
OTHERFEMALE:That's crazy.
SUPFEMALE:But, see, that's what we were taught.
OTHERFEMALE:I remember when I was 15 my mother telling me the definition of a young lady.
LEADFEMALE:A young lady always says "please" and "thank you," she always laughs at a young man's jokes, and a young lady never beats a boy in sports.
LEADFEMALE:Good thing we don't have any young ladies on our soccer team.
LEADFEMALE:This boy/girl stuff is pretty complicated business, huh? You ain't seen nothin' yet.
LEADMALE:Wait till you get to be a teenager.
SUPFEMALE:Am I gonna be like Mallory and get crazy for clothes and movie stars? I think you're gonna be like Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? Warm, sweet, funny.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't sound like any teenager I know.
SUPFEMALE:See, you and Justin are friends.
LEADFEMALE:You like each other.
SUPMALE:Y-you have fun together.
SUPMALE:That should be what matters.
OTHERMALE:I want to do it, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I do.
LEADMALE:But I don't know if I can.
LEADMALE:Well Sleep on it.
OTHERFEMALE:Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! Hey, fonzie.
LEADMALE:Can you give me a hand here? Uh, I don't know how to break this to you, dad, but the last wave left about an hour ago.
LEADMALE:Just give me a hand, will ya? I can't believe people actually dressed like this.
OTHERFEMALE:In those days, a jacket like that was a symbol of rebellion, an emblem of an entire generation.
LEADMALE:It meant you were tough and that you could hold your own in a rumble.
LEADMALE:You have one like this? No, my mother wouldn't let me.
LEADFEMALE:Am I dreaming, or did Sandra Dee just walk in? Moondoggie, is that you?! Hurry, Gidge! Surf's up! Ooh! I hope you two get this out of your system before the guests arrive.
LEADMALE:Hey, where is the birthday girl? She's upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory's putting the final touches on her.
SUPMALE:She better hurry.
SUPFEMALE:Kids will be here any minute.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's all set.
SUPFEMALE:Ain't this a beauty? This is exactly like the one they had at the paradise hotel in Atlantic city when I worked there in 1959.
OTHERMALE:That was a great summer! Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you in 1959.
OTHERMALE:I-I-it would have been a better summer if I had known you.
LEADFEMALE:Better than great? Jennifer! You can't go out with only one lip done! I don't like it.
LEADMALE:It feels like I have jelly on me.
SUPMALE:Well, you're supposed to look '50s, not punk.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:They're here.
LEADMALE:Can I see your invitations, please? Alex! I don't know these guys.
LEADFEMALE:They could be crashers.
LEADMALE:Come on in, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to the 1950s.
LEADMALE:Hope you have as much fun as I did.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Guys, you look great.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Sam.
LEADMALE:Hey, fantastic.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that outfit.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, ladies.
OTHERMALE:How are you? Oh.
LEADMALE:I think I detect a trend here.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Fellas, I got an idea Why don't we, uh, saunter over to the other side of the room here? Come on, come on, come on.
LEADFEMALE:You all know each other.
LEADMALE:You're in the same class, right? This is fantastic.
SUPFEMALE:Quite a uh It's gonna be a long night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, 8 out of the 10 boys I interviewed will dance with a girl if asked.
LEADFEMALE:reaganomics a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Alex! You know, I was just thinking, it's interesting the way they're more aware politically than socially.
LEADMALE:Can you get them to dance or can't you? Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:But no of them is gonna be the first one out there.
LEADFEMALE:Of the girls I polled, they're willing to dance with boys, if asked, and if the boy is taller.
SUPFEMALE:The s.
SUPFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:L.
LEADMALE:T.
SUPMALE:Talks couldn't have been this complicated.
LEADFEMALE:I bet they were a lot more fun.
SUPMALE:I mean, let's face it This party is dying.
LEADMALE:Well, mommy I hope you're satisfied.
SUPMALE:Don't get sarcastic with me, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I don't like that.
OTHERMALE:Tough! I don't talk that way to you.
SUPFEMALE:If something's bothering you, you just come right out and tell me what it is.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:You ruined my party by inviting the boys here! Oh.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, that's not fair.
LEADMALE:You always take her side, don't you, daddy? It's "gang up on the kid" time again, huh? Now, Jennifer, I know you're upset with me right now, and, to tell you the truth, I'm not all that thrilled with you.
LEADMALE:But if there's gonna be a way out of this tonight, it's gonna come from you.
LEADFEMALE:How? I think you ought to ask Justin to dance.
LEADFEMALE:Be serious! I am.
LEADMALE:And I think there are a lot of kids here who will be very happy if someone else makes the first move.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid to, mom.
LEADMALE:What are you afraid of? People will laugh.
SUPFEMALE:I won't.
SUPFEMALE:I won't.
LEADFEMALE:I won't.
SUPFEMALE:I might.
LEADFEMALE:Just being honest.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's say that that's the worst thing that happens.
LEADMALE:People will laugh.
LEADMALE:The best thing that's gonna happen is that you'll dance with Justin, the other kids will dance, and you'll wind up having a terrific party.
LEADFEMALE:I want to, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I really do.
LEADMALE:But I don't know if I have the guts.
LEADMALE:All right, everybody, this next one is going to be, um, ladies' choice.
LEADMALE:can't you see my head is reeling there's so many things I'm feeling don't know what I'm thinking of I'm so in love pardon me will you dance with me, Justin? I thought you'd never ask.
LEADFEMALE:just blame it on the stars above I'm lucky in love don't think we'll ever see our dreams come true want to dance? It's ladies' choice.
SUPMALE:I'm cool.
LEADFEMALE:Care to dance, sailor? so easy this helpless mooning bound to be oh, what the hell.
OTHERFEMALE:Sentimental fool happy birthday.
SUPFEMALE:like me 
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:okay, kid, you ready? Are you sure this is a good idea, Alex? I don't know anything about delivering groceries.
LEADMALE:It's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:It's about time you get a little experience in the job market.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, you figure people will give you bigger tips if you're with a little girl.
LEADMALE:How can you be so cynical? Maybe it's because I only get Who is it? 
SUPMALE:Adler's grocery! Door's open.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:You ordered some groceries? Yeah, just set them down on the counter and bill my account, okay? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, they're on the counter.
SUPMALE:I say, they're on the counter.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and, uh, we're ready for our tip.
LEADMALE:Jennifer! Uh, you have to excuse my sister.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:She's absolutely right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to be rude.
SUPMALE:It's just that I'm trying to write this paper for school, and I'm pretty caught up in it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I know the feeling.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sort of a workaholic myself.
LEADFEMALE:This is my senior thesis.
SUPFEMALE:It's on Milton Friedman's economic theories.
LEADMALE:Pretty boring, huh? Are you kidding? I-i love Milton Friedman.
LEADMALE:He's my favorite economist.
SUPMALE:You have a favorite economist? He's not a normal boy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know, I hate to play favorites, but, uh, I'm really excited about Friedman's theory that by keeping a tight lid on the money supply, the federal reserve board can control inflation.
SUPFEMALE:I don't agree.
LEADMALE:By following that policy, the fed keeps interest rates artificially high, which stifles the growth of the economy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I-i don't know.
SUPMALE:I think the high interest rates are mostly a psychological phenomenon.
LEADMALE:See, the banks just don't have enough confidence in the economy to take the risk of lowering them.
OTHERFEMALE:Speaking of the economy, Alex, time is money.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna take the groceries next door to 215.
OTHERFEMALE:If you're not in the car in 15 minutes, I'm leaving without you.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Jennifer, don't forget our deal.
LEADFEMALE:I won't.
LEADMALE:Cute kid.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, real cute.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you made an interesting point about Friedman's economic theory.
SUPMALE:I never thought of looking at it that way.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a it's a subtle yet intriguing perspective.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I-i put your soap in freezer bags.
LEADFEMALE:It helps keep the scent from permeating the food.
SUPMALE:Oh, and, uh, I individually wrapped your eggs.
LEADFEMALE:I've never seen that done before.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, most people don't take groceries that seriously.
SUPFEMALE:Most people don't take life that seriously.
LEADFEMALE:It's my first day.
OTHERMALE:You're my first delivery.
LEADMALE:I hope I haven't overdone it.
LEADMALE:Oh, I, uh, pitted those olives for you.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't mind.
SUPFEMALE:Did you leave my tea in the tea bags? Uh, listen, I'm starting to get a little worried about Jennifer.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go see what's taking her so long.
LEADMALE:Hey, uh, by the way, my name's Stephanie Brooks.
LEADFEMALE:Alex p.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
SUPMALE:Where do you go to school, anyway? I go to Harding high school.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADMALE:You don't seem like a high-school student.
LEADMALE:You seem much older.
SUPFEMALE:You know, you look it, too.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:I've always thought immaturity was rather childish.
OTHERMALE:Let's go, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You got 5 bucks from Mrs.
LEADMALE:winchell? What'd you have to do to get that? I didn't have to do anything.
LEADFEMALE:But this afternoon, you have to wash her car.
LEADMALE:Real cute.
LEADMALE:Well, look at you, Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:You're up early.
LEADMALE:You set the table, you're making breakfast, you're putting chocolate chips in the eggs? Mom, somebody had to be the first to try them in cookies.
LEADMALE:That worked out all right, didn't it? Morning.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:I'm making chocolate-chip eggs, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you want some? Not if it were the last remaining food on the planet.
SUPMALE:A simple "no" would have been sufficient.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, everybody.
LEADMALE:Morning.
LEADMALE:Now, there's a likely candidate.
SUPMALE:Dad, do you want some scrambled eggs? I'm making them especially for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Terrific.
OTHERMALE:I'd love some.
LEADMALE:Do I know how to pick them? Has anybody read any good books lately? I have to do a book report for English class.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what kind of book do you want to read, Mallory? Well, I don't actually want to read the book.
LEADFEMALE:I was hoping one of you could tell me about a book you've read.
LEADMALE:Mallory, reading is one of the great joys of life.
LEADFEMALE:When you were young, you used to read all the time.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? I discovered shopping.
LEADFEMALE:I have this great picture of you as a young girl all curled up by the Christmas tree, reading "Lassie come home.
LEADFEMALE:" Why don't you just do your book report on that? That's a good idea.
SUPFEMALE:Refresh my memory.
SUPFEMALE:Does Lassie come home or do they get a new dog or what? Hello? Uh, yes he is.
SUPMALE:Can I tell him who's calling? Just a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, a Stephanie Brooks for you.
LEADMALE:Hello? Yeah, sure I remember you.
SUPMALE:There wasn't any problem with the groceries, was there? Good.
OTHERMALE:Tonight? In person?! Oh, I'd love to go! All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll come by your place at 7:00.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks again.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Front row, center.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Are you going to that Barry manilow concert tonight? Oh, better.
SUPMALE:Better.
SUPMALE:Better than Barry manilow? Who? Milton Friedman.
OTHERFEMALE:He's giving a lecture at the college auditorium tonight.
LEADMALE:Well, he is better than Barry manilow.
LEADFEMALE:You see, a friend of Stephanie's canceled out, so she offered me the extra ticket.
LEADFEMALE:Who is Stephanie? We delivered groceries to her yesterday.
SUPMALE:She's very pretty.
LEADMALE:She goes to college, and she has her own apartment.
LEADFEMALE:You left out the color of her walls.
OTHERMALE:Pink and tan.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, Alex, don't take this the wrong way, but why would a college girl be calling you for a date? Why would any girl be calling him for a date? I mean, I'm not sure if I approve of you going out with a college girl.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Elyse.
SUPMALE:No, Steven, I'm I'm serious.
OTHERMALE:A girl like that is is older.
SUPFEMALE:She's She's more mature.
LEADFEMALE:She's she's older.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Elyse, I don't see anything wrong with it.
LEADFEMALE:What's a few years, anyway? Does, uh, that mean I can go out with college guys? That would be a gross misinterpretation of my remarks.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a double standard to me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ely You're on your own, buddy.
LEADMALE:M-Mallory Alex is two years older than you.
LEADFEMALE:In two years, if you want to go out with a boy who's in college, uh, we'll let you know then if it's okay.
LEADMALE:Look, let's not make such a big deal about this.
SUPMALE:Stephanie and I are not romantically involved.
SUPFEMALE:We do share an interest in economics, but what we have is nothing more than a delivery boy/customer relationship.
SUPFEMALE:That's what I was afraid of.
LEADFEMALE:Your eggs are ready, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm! Steven, don't Heh These aren't bad, but I think they need some more chocolate chips.
OTHERFEMALE:I knew Friedman was brilliant, but I never dreamed he was so Dynamic! You know, I was heartbroken when he finished and walked offstage.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm sure Milton was as surprised as anyone when you stood up and yelled, "more! More!" Uh, do you think my holding up a lit match was a bit too much? Yeah, probably, but, hey, you were excited.
SUPMALE:Well I guess it's pretty late.
OTHERFEMALE:What is it Aha.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to come in for a little while? Uh, sure.
OTHERMALE:Take a step forward.
SUPFEMALE:Forward.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:So, would you like some wine? Thank you.
LEADMALE:Uh, just leave it on the counter.
SUPMALE:I'll remember to take it when I leave.
LEADFEMALE:No, I meant to drink here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh, you mean here.
LEADFEMALE:Now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Sure, wine would be great.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, did you think that it was at all strange that I called you and invited you to the lecture? No, not at all.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you knew I liked Milton Friedman.
LEADMALE:You had an extra ticket.
LEADMALE:It doesn't seem strange.
SUPMALE:That's not why I invited you.
SUPMALE:I didn't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Alex I'm not really in the habit of calling up high-school guys and asking them out on dates, but when you were here yesterday delivering my groceries, I sensed something different, something, uh, special about you.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it was the way I individually wrapped your eggs.
LEADFEMALE:There was more to it than that.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I can't even believe that I'm here with you right now.
SUPMALE:I have to keep reminding myself that you're only 17.
SUPMALE:You seem to have come by so much so early.
LEADMALE:You must sense that about yourself, don't you? Not really.
LEADMALE:I don't think of myself as Oh, Alex, come on.
SUPMALE:Admit it.
OTHERFEMALE:You're really special.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I I don't want to get in an argument about this.
OTHERMALE:I think I know what you mean.
SUPMALE:Has a lot to do with my parents, you know? They've always encouraged me to think for myself, to be aware of things.
LEADFEMALE:We disagree about a lot, but underneath it all, I know they think I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:That's important.
LEADFEMALE:I think a good relationship with your parents helps you to form good relationships with others.
LEADFEMALE:That's true.
LEADFEMALE:I know this guy at school, Louie Hicks.
LEADFEMALE:His dad ran out on his family when he was 10, and I can tell by the way Louie acts that he deeply resents it.
SUPMALE:Either that, or he just enjoys setting things on fire.
LEADMALE:Do you have a lot of close friends at school? More than Louie.
LEADMALE:See, you know, m-my friends at school, they're just kids.
LEADFEMALE:I'd feel real funny having a conversation like this with any of them.
OTHERFEMALE:All they want to talk about are girls and and baseball.
LEADMALE:You know, I know exactly what you mean.
LEADMALE:I couldn't have a conversation like this with most of the people I go to college with.
LEADFEMALE:People who are intelligent and sensitive are a very rare breed.
SUPFEMALE:I think that's why, despite our age difference, I find myself very attracted to you.
OTHERFEMALE:How 'bout those Cleveland Indians? How 'bout those Cleveland Indians? Alex? Yes? Do you want to spend the night here? No, that's okay.
SUPMALE:I-i live real close.
SUPFEMALE:That's not what I meant.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:It's just that You remember yesterday w-when I told you I had never delivered groceries to anybody before? Yeah.
LEADMALE:That's not the only thing I've never done before.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
LEADMALE:Well, you did pretty well with the groceries.
OTHERFEMALE: * birds do it bees do it even educated fleas do it let's do it let's fall in love morning, all.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:You entering a David niven look-alike contest? Honestly, dad, you slay me.
OTHERMALE:You done with the real-estate section? Uh Alex, what time did you get in last night? Oh, I don't know, mother.
LEADFEMALE:What is time, really? Okay, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is going on here? How do you mean that, dad? You seem to have aged 10 years since yesterday, which would put you at about 56.
LEADMALE:Are you in a school play you didn't tell us about, or is this costume related to your date last night? Mom What happened to me last night was more than just a date.
SUPMALE:It was, perhaps, the most pivotal event of my life thus far.
OTHERFEMALE:Should I take that to mean "yes"? You should indeed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, whether it was a date or a pivotal event, I still think you should have called home when you knew you'd be so late.
SUPMALE:What would you have me do? Just after I said, "Stephanie, would you like some more cabernet?" Should I have said, "excuse me, I have to call my mommy"? I don't care what you said, as long as you called your mommy I mean, your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, uh, you sound pretty serious about Stephanie.
LEADMALE:Let me put it this way, dad Remember when I said I wouldn't be getting married till I was 32? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes I remember July 17, 1998.
LEADMALE:You made us put it on our calendar.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it may be sooner.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:You met this girl two days ago, and already you're talking about marriage? They weren't just two ordinary days.
LEADMALE:I mean, in some magical way, time moved quickly and yet stood still.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, brother.
SUPFEMALE:A-Alex, we don't want to interfere.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, maybe we do.
SUPFEMALE:We just don't want things to happen faster than you can handle them.
SUPMALE:You're still young.
OTHERMALE:You've got a lot to learn.
SUPMALE:You have to learn how to dress, for one thing.
SUPFEMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go get changed.
SUPMALE:I'm going rowing in the park.
OTHERMALE:With Stephanie? No, I'm going alone to practice first.
SUPMALE:I want everything to be just perfect when I take her.
SUPMALE:birds do it 
LEADMALE:Who is it? It's Alex.
SUPMALE:Alex.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here? I just thought I'd come by and surprise you.
LEADMALE:Uh, you should have called me first.
OTHERFEMALE:Wouldn't have been as much of a surprise.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, we got a fresh batch of melons in at the market.
LEADMALE:I brought you a couple.
LEADMALE:Oh, here's a tip Keep them at room temperature for 36 hours before serving.
SUPMALE:I thought maybe we could go out, maybe go see a movie, go rowing in the park.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been practicing.
LEADMALE:Who's he? Alex, this is Pete drucker.
LEADMALE:Pete, Alex Keaton.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? Who is this guy? Uh, Pete, do you mind if I talk to Alex for just a minute? No, not at all.
OTHERFEMALE:I meant alone.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I'll wait in the other room.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Stephanie, what's going on? Uh, Pete goes to college with me.
SUPFEMALE:He's a friend.
LEADMALE:What kind of a friend? A very good friend.
LEADMALE:Look, Alex, I'm not gonna lie to you.
LEADMALE:Pete and I have dated.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Are you on an official date right now? Well, we haven't registered or anything, but, yeah, I guess it's a date.
SUPMALE:Stephanie, I don't, uh This just doesn't make sense to me.
LEADFEMALE:How can you be on a date with another guy after what happened between us last night I mean, after everything we said, after everything We did? Alex, Pete being here right now has nothing to do with what happened last night.
LEADMALE:How can you say that? Then w-what What was I to you? Just another body? Just a delivery boy, good for some groceries and a few laughs? I forgot to get myself something to drink.
LEADMALE:Um I'm not that thirsty.
SUPMALE:He's eating the food I delivered.
LEADMALE:Let him go out and eat! Alex, look, I could ask Pete to leave, but that's not gonna solve anything.
LEADMALE:I say we give it a try.
LEADMALE:Look, Alex, I think I'd better explain something to you.
LEADFEMALE:Look, okay.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to draw me a picture.
SUPFEMALE:I think I know what's going on here.
SUPMALE:There's one guy too many! I was here first.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Alex, I'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:If I hurt you in any way Look, last night was wonderful and special to me.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to believe that.
LEADMALE:I want to believe that.
LEADMALE:I would believe that if it weren't for the small problem of that guy in the other room! I feel so cheap.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Everybody set? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Just about.
LEADMALE:Do you think Alex will be mad that we went to the movies without him? Honey, since Stephanie came into his life, I don't think he'd notice if we moved out of town.
LEADMALE:Why don't we try it and see if he does? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, come on.
LEADMALE: Alex.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:How was your date with Stephanie? Fine.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah, dad.
SUPFEMALE:It was fine.
LEADFEMALE:It was a great date.
LEADFEMALE:I had a wonderful time.
SUPMALE:O-okay, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry to bug you.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that, um You've only been gone So, a date can be fine without being long.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you all going? We're going to the movies.
OTHERMALE:What are you seeing? "Endless love.
LEADFEMALE:" Uh I don't really want to see the movie.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, why don't you go? Go on ahead with the girls.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Come on, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Are you kidding?! This could be better than the movie.
LEADMALE:Come on, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:You want to talk about it? I went over to surprise her.
OTHERMALE:I figured it would be sort of a romantic thing to do, you know? I even brought two gift-wrapped melons with me.
LEADMALE:Melons? Well, no one can accuse you of being clichÃ©d.
OTHERMALE:She was with another guy, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERMALE:How could she do that to me after everything that happened between us last night? I-I'm not sure I know what happened.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know what you think might have happened? That's what happened.
SUPFEMALE:It was your first time, wasn't it? Sort of.
SUPFEMALE:"Sort of"? You know that girl I have been dating, Monica Dillon? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:She likes me.
SUPMALE:But she's not ready She's not ready yet.
OTHERMALE:But when she is ready, she wants me to be the guy, so I've been sort of counting that as one.
LEADFEMALE:Interesting way of looking at it.
SUPMALE:Alex Your first time.
OTHERFEMALE:How about those Cleveland Indians? Look, look You've caught me a-a little bit off my guard here.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I've been practicing for this moment for a long time now.
LEADFEMALE:So have I.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I didn't expect you to be giving me this news in the kitchen, though.
LEADMALE:Where'd you expect to hear it? For some reason, I pictured us in a ski lodge.
LEADMALE:Big stone fireplace, snow falling outside, boots warming by the fire.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm glad you told me.
LEADFEMALE:Did you tell your dad about the first time? N-not yet.
LEADMALE:I'm so confused, dad.
SUPFEMALE:There was real communication between Stephanie and me.
LEADMALE:At least I thought there was.
LEADMALE:How could she have misled me like this? Alex, you and Stephanie may have had a beautiful night together, but but it But it was just one night.
LEADMALE:Love and commitment don't materialize because two people spend a night together.
SUPMALE:They did for me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, dad.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I want anything more to do with girls.
LEADMALE:Might as well join a monastery.
OTHERMALE:You have to be catholic to do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, this really isn't my day.
LEADMALE:Alex Alex, you acted on your feelings tonight and got hurt because of it.
SUPMALE:But only by opening yourself up like this can you ever hope to To experience the exhilaration, the joy of loving another person.
LEADMALE:Now, uh, maybe next time, you won't get hurt.
LEADMALE:Maybe you will.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:But, uh, I think it's worth taking that risk.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't realize you knew so much about this relationship stuff.
SUPMALE:I read a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I know what it's like to feel something and want something only to have reality splash cold water in your face.
LEADFEMALE:When your mother and I were in high school, I was crushed because she went to the junior prom with Roger silverman instead of me.
LEADFEMALE:Why'd she do that? Because he asked her and I didn't.
OTHERMALE:I was shy, but But I didn't give up on girls.
OTHERMALE:I hung in there with your mother and, uh Well, I think you know how it turned out.
SUPFEMALE:I could look at this as a learning experience, couldn't I? Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I will give Stephanie a call tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I mean, when you look back on mom and Roger silverman, you probably laugh, right? 
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Steven, what do you think your dad would like with dinner Beer or wine? Oh, definitely beer, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:You know how my father feels about wine.
LEADMALE:It's okay for women and interior decorators.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:What? What's the matter? It's light beer.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's okay.
LEADMALE:It's okay.
OTHERMALE:Don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:Bubba Smith and dick butkus drink light beer, and they're right at his cutoff level for manliness.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I think we're in the clear.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Oh, what time does his plane get in? About an hour ago.
LEADFEMALE:He's taking a cab here from the airport.
LEADMALE:Well, we could have picked him up, Steven.
LEADMALE:Didn't you offer? Well, of course I offered.
LEADMALE:He insisted on taking a cab.
LEADFEMALE:He said he didn't want a repeat of what happened last year when I picked him up.
LEADFEMALE:You mean when you hit the police car? I didn't hit the police car, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:I grazed it.
SUPFEMALE:All they lost was their door handle and one headlight.
LEADMALE:The dog was fine.
LEADMALE:Anyway, it was my father's fault.
LEADFEMALE:The second we got in the car, he started bugging me about my driving.
LEADFEMALE:He had me so worked up, I didn't even see the police car coming.
LEADMALE:Didn't hear the siren either? Drop it, okay? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:This time, it's gonna be different, Elyse.
LEADMALE:I'm determined that this visit with him be a peaceful one.
LEADFEMALE:You will not see us fighting.
SUPMALE:Gonna blindfold me? Better I've come up with a list of safe issues that my father and I can discuss.
OTHERMALE:"The printing press A step forward for mankind?" "Crabgrass friend or foe?" You think it's silly, don't you? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I don't expect to learn anything from these discussions, but I think the fighting's got to stop.
SUPMALE:For one thing, I don't think it's right for the kids to see their father and grandfather locked in combat.
LEADMALE:Oh, the kids don't even notice.
LEADFEMALE:They are totally oblivious to any conflict between you and your dad.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy, when is grandpa getting here? I don't want to miss any of the yelling.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what's the fight gonna be this year, dad? Foreign policy? Offshore oil drilling? Oblivious, hmm? Daddy, why do you and grandpa argue all the time? I mean, you both are grown-ups, right? Well, th-the fact that we're grown-ups has nothing to do with it, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Parents and their children tend to disagree on things all their lives.
SUPFEMALE:Your father's right.
LEADMALE:You know, take, for example, h-how I'm always telling you to clean your room and be careful outside.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Well, I'll still be telling you those things when we're both much older.
SUPMALE:That's really something to look forward to.
LEADMALE:He's here.
SUPMALE:Grandpa's here.
SUPMALE:Hey, Alex! Hey, hey! - Grandpa! Hi, kids! - Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, grandpa.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, pumpkins.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Jake.
OTHERMALE:I'll take the bags upstairs, grandpa.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Well Hi, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello, son.
LEADFEMALE:How was your trip? Great, except for the taxi.
SUPMALE:Cabbie named George.
LEADFEMALE:Long hair, terrible driver.
SUPMALE:Friend of yours? Jake and Steven, why don't you sit down and get comfortable, and the kids and I will bring in the food, okay? Well, no argument here.
SUPMALE:I do you want something to drink? Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like a light beer.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
SUPMALE:So, you like light beer, huh? I guess you drink it because it's less filling.
SUPFEMALE:I drink it because it tastes great.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's less filling, too.
LEADMALE:Tastes great.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, have a seat.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you, Steven.
LEADMALE:So, uh, how have you been? Oh, pretty good.
LEADMALE:Yourself? Oh, not too bad.
SUPFEMALE:You notice Gas stations don't give out free maps anymore? I don't need maps.
SUPFEMALE:I never get lost.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, let me help you with that, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Need anything else from the kitchen, Elyse? Anything from the store? This looks wonderful, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Jake.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, you like those skates I bought you? They're great, grandpa.
LEADMALE:I hope they're the kind that you wanted.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, I wanted red ones, but that's my fault.
OTHERMALE:I didn't specify in my letter.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, you didn't ask grandpa to bring you those skates, did you? No, mom.
LEADMALE:I couldn't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:I told him I was saving up so I could buy them myself Oh.
SUPFEMALE:But I didn't think I could do it without quitting school and working full-time.
SUPFEMALE:Did you go hunting this year, grandpa? Sure did.
SUPMALE:Shot eight beautiful Mallard.
SUPFEMALE:Big day.
OTHERFEMALE:Not for the mallards.
SUPFEMALE:How's that? I said Nice work, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Good shooting.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is a surprise, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:You always used to say you thought hunting was cruel and barbaric.
SUPMALE:Well, dad, I've modified my opinion somewhat.
OTHERFEMALE:I've come to realize that killing does have its merits.
OTHERMALE:What did I just say, Elyse? Hunting sounds exciting, grandpa.
SUPFEMALE:I'd love to go with you next year.
LEADFEMALE:Can I go, too, grandpa? Girls don't shoot ducks, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Men shoot them, dogs retrieve them, women cook them That's the food chain.
OTHERMALE:Then why can't I go if Alex is going? Alex isn't going.
SUPFEMALE:Why not, dad? Because The duck-killing s Hunting season doesn't coincide with your school vacation.
SUPMALE:So, any of you kids studying anything in school you want to tell your grandpa Jake about? Yeah, we just finished reading a book about Richard Nixon in history class.
LEADFEMALE:Nixon.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine man.
OTHERFEMALE:One of the greatest.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, uh So, how's daylight-savings time treating you? Same as usual.
LEADFEMALE:I-it's a clever idea, really.
OTHERMALE:You know, they just seem to get that extra hour of daylight out of nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing when you think about it.
SUPFEMALE:Nixon was framed, you know.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, please.
LEADFEMALE:He was not framed! He was a crook! Uh, pass the potatoes, please.
SUPFEMALE:We can't get along.
LEADFEMALE:That's all there is to it.
LEADFEMALE:I might as well just accept it.
OTHERMALE:Look, you just got off on the wrong foot, that's all.
LEADMALE:These cards weren't any help at all.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how were you supposed to know he had such strong feelings about felt-tip pens? He's wrong, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:They were not invented in Russia.
LEADMALE:Okay, just Just relax, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Ahh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Let me rub your neck.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy.
LEADMALE:Will that help get your mind off your dad? Who? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't you two remember to close the door? What is it, Mallory? Jennifer's wearing her skates to bed, and she keeps rolling into my room.
SUPFEMALE:Whee! See? - I'll get her.
LEADMALE:You get to sleep.
OTHERMALE:Yes, okay.
LEADMALE:Coming to bed, honey? I'd rather not, if it's all the same to you.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to wake you, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Y-you didn't.
LEADMALE:I just got into bed this second.
SUPMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, look, dad, I think we got off on the wrong foot tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, so do I.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I came in to talk to you.
LEADMALE:I appreciate that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, don't bother.
SUPFEMALE:I-it's no bother.
SUPMALE:You made a nice gesture, and I wanted to acknowledge it, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't call for an acknowledgment.
LEADFEMALE:It was nothing.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it was! Night.
LEADFEMALE:Day.
LEADFEMALE:I think we've got some things to work out, dad.
SUPMALE:I guess so.
SUPFEMALE:Listen.
SUPMALE:Since I'm only gonna be here for a week, I'd like to spend some time with Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Alex loves you.
LEADMALE:He loves spending time with you.
LEADMALE:Well, I've decided to take him out of school on Thursday.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Thursday's a school day.
LEADMALE:He can't go.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, he'd just miss one day.
LEADFEMALE:What's the big deal? Look at all the schooling you had.
OTHERFEMALE:A lot of good it did you.
SUPMALE:I apologize for getting my master's degree.
SUPMALE:I was way out of line.
LEADMALE:You could have been working.
SUPFEMALE:That's all.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, you know what I always say.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:"Less learnin', more earnin'," right? You bet.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we, uh, tried to get Alex into construction work as early as we could, but his kindergarten teacher was against it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like your attitude, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm not so crazy about yours, either.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're here in my home.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you should respect my wishes.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm your father, and I think you should respect my wishes.
LEADFEMALE:The answer is no, dad.
LEADMALE:Well, that's just fine, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:It's fine.
LEADFEMALE:I come here to visit you for the last time.
LEADMALE:I don't even get to spend a day with my grandson! I didn't say you cou Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, the last time? Oh, forget it.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? - Nothing! What are you saying, dad that you won't come and visit again unless I let you take Alex out of school? Because if that's what you're saying, then I say fine.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's not what I'm saying, damn it! Steven.
LEADFEMALE:This is gonna be my last visit here because Well, I'm very sick.
OTHERMALE:W-what do you mean? I'm dying.
LEADFEMALE:God, when I think of all the petty, little arguments we've had, I feel so guilty.
LEADFEMALE:I should have just been glad to have him alive.
LEADFEMALE:You can't conduct every moment of a relationship on the premise that the other person's gonna be dead at some point.
LEADFEMALE:Life just isn't like that.
SUPFEMALE:Even so, we've had some pretty avoidable arguments over the years, Elyse.
LEADMALE:We didn't speak for two months after the Cuban missile crisis.
LEADMALE:Well, that was a very emotional issue.
LEADMALE:Khrushchev and Kennedy made up quicker than we did.
SUPMALE:Come on, your dad isn't thinking about Cuba anymore.
LEADFEMALE:He mentioned it at dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, kids.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing up so late? - Hi, Jake.
OTHERMALE:Hi, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, come on, you guys.
LEADFEMALE:Lighten up.
LEADMALE:It's like a morgue in here.
LEADMALE:Jake! Sorry, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I Just a figure of speech.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, do you have a minute? I hope more than that.
LEADMALE:Dad, sit down for a minute, okay? Come on, let's Let's talk about this.
OTHERFEMALE:What's there to talk about? You don't discuss it.
SUPFEMALE:You do it.
LEADMALE:Actually You stop doing it.
LEADFEMALE:Jake, are you absolutely sure you're Going? Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:Yes, I'm sure.
LEADFEMALE:Have you tried everything? No, I never tried white-water rafting.
SUPMALE:I'm going next month.
OTHERMALE:Have you checked all possible treatments? Yeah, I've been through all that.
LEADMALE:Cocoa? No, they tried that.
LEADFEMALE:Look, look, dad, this happens to be very serious to us.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how do you think I feel? I give up.
OTHERFEMALE:Jake, we want to help you.
LEADMALE:I-is there anything that you need from us? Well, I'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell the kids about it.
LEADFEMALE:This is probably my last visit here, and I-i want it to be a happy one.
SUPMALE:Whatever you say, dad, if that's what you want.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? Up, I hope.
SUPFEMALE:I appreciate your concern, kids.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Good night.
OTHERMALE:Uh, h-hold it, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, what is it, Steven? Uh, dad, we're going to have to talk about this eventually, so I might as well bring it up now About the Arrangements.
LEADMALE:I mean What kind of funeral do you want Big? Small? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Surprise me.
LEADMALE:Well, good morning, everyone.
LEADMALE:Hi, grandpa.
LEADMALE:Great day, isn't it? Where you been, grandpa? I been chopping wood since 6:15.
LEADFEMALE:Dad! Yeah, nothing like an early morning.
LEADFEMALE:You know, makes you feel so alive.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think you should be taking it easy? Maybe you should lie down.
SUPFEMALE:Plenty of time for that soon enough.
LEADFEMALE:Can I make you some pancakes, Jake? You bet.
LEADFEMALE:Grandpa, we're having show-and-tell at school.
LEADFEMALE:I'm bringing that stuffed porcupine you gave me.
SUPMALE:Now, Jennifer, I don't know if that's a good I-I mean, uh, I think the other kids will really get a kick out of that.
OTHERMALE:Nothing cheers up a roomful of kids like a Dead animal.
LEADFEMALE:Always worked at my school.
SUPMALE:Uh, here, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Jake, can I get you something to drink Maybe some hot tea? Tea? Do I look like Princess Margaret? Bring me a man's drink.
LEADFEMALE:Coffee black.
SUPMALE:Make that two.
LEADMALE:Attaboy.
LEADFEMALE:Do you two men want your coffee in cups, or you want to drink it right out of the pot? Bearing in mind, Alex, this is your first cup of coffee ever.
SUPFEMALE:Cups, mom.
LEADMALE:And a lot of milk, please.
SUPFEMALE:I got it.
OTHERMALE:Well, you get your homework done last night? Well, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I bet you get your girlfriend to do it for you, don't you? I doubt it.
OTHERFEMALE:She can't read.
LEADMALE:As long as she's cute and can cook, that's all that matters.
OTHERFEMALE:Darn right, dad.
LEADMALE:I-I-it's not the only thing that matters, but, uh, cooking and cuteness are an integral part of a woman's life.
LEADMALE:And reading isn't? All I'm saying is that the time people spend reading might better be spent working.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I always say "less learnin', more earnin'.
SUPFEMALE:" Daddy, you never say that.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, I say it at least once a day.
LEADMALE:She's just never in the room when I say it.
LEADMALE:She's probably too busy reading.
LEADMALE:So, dad, what do you have planned for today? Oh, I was hoping that Alex and I could spend some time together.
LEADMALE:Today? I got school.
LEADFEMALE:So? Skip it.
LEADMALE:How often do you get to spend a day with your grandfather? Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Did I hear you right? You're telling me to skip school? I would take advantage of it, Alex Before he regains his senses! I c I can't today.
OTHERMALE:I've got midterms.
LEADMALE:So you miss a midterm or two.
OTHERMALE:What's the worst thing that could happen? I have to repeat 12th grade.
LEADFEMALE:You'll just be that much ahead next year.
SUPMALE:We'll do it some other time.
OTHERFEMALE:Forget it, Steven.
LEADMALE:Midterms are over at noon, gramp.
LEADFEMALE:If you want, you can pick me up then.
LEADFEMALE:I thought maybe you and I could do some fishing.
OTHERFEMALE:How does that grab you? Okay.
LEADMALE:Should be fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and after, I'll take you downtown.
LEADMALE:I'll get you tattooed.
LEADMALE:Tattoo? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Alex Do what your grandfather says.
LEADFEMALE:A-a-a tattoo is A-a living, breathing monument.
LEADFEMALE:You'd look great with one, Alex.
LEADMALE:But, dad! Ah! I was just kidding about the tattoo.
SUPMALE:Me too.
LEADMALE:Any sign of them yet? They called from the lake an hour ago.
LEADMALE:They should be here any minute.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm starving.
LEADFEMALE:I say we give them 15 minutes And order pizza.
LEADFEMALE:Hang in there, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Your grandfather's really excited about catching dinner for us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's gonna be great.
OTHERMALE:You'll see! See we'll take fresh fish, we'll clean it, and then we'll scale it and we'll cut out the bones and then cut off the Head.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we should just order the pizza now.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:The men are back.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of fish did you catch, grandpa? Well, the fish weren't biting out there today, but look what we caught in the supermarket! Hamburgers! Yeah! They put up quite a fight, too.
LEADFEMALE:You want to tell us about the one that got away? Well, there was a steak about this big.
OTHERMALE:How big? It was about this this big.
OTHERMALE:How big? - About about this big.
LEADMALE:How big? Just got a little, tiny one.
LEADMALE:I got to hand it to you, Steven.
SUPMALE:Well, you raised a fine boy, there.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I, uh, made some calls this morning.
LEADMALE:I even talked to the Mayo clinic.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you're probably not aware of this, but there's a chance they could extend your life for a while.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm aware of that.
SUPFEMALE:You are! Yes, and I'm not interested.
SUPMALE:I'm planning to die on my feet.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, eventually, I'll fall over.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, dad.
OTHERMALE:Don't pull this macho stuff with me now! I'm talking about your life, here.
LEADMALE:So am I.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think I want to spend the days I have left lying in a hospital bed with tubes in me, getting shots and treatments every day, depending on some overworked nurse to tell me if I'm awake or asleep? Not on your life.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, a lot can happen in the time they keep you alive.
SUPFEMALE:They could find a cure.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I hope they do, but I'm not gonna risk wasting my last days in the hospital.
SUPMALE:I got a lot of things to do before I go.
SUPMALE:No, sir.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna die the way I lived.
LEADFEMALE:You'll die the way you've lived, all right pigheaded and stubborn! Now, don't talk to me that way, Steven.
OTHERMALE:It happens to be true.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to save your life, dad, and you won't listen to a word I have to say, and you never have, either! You've never given me one ounce of credit, not for the past 20 years! Credit?! You wanted credit?! What for?! For letting your hair grow long and refusing to hold down a decent job?! For maligning the leaders of the country?! For spitting on every value I ever held?! For purposely trying to antagonize me?! Is that what you think? It just so happens, dad, that I believed in what I was doing and what I stood for.
LEADFEMALE:Then I suppose you wanted me to agree with what you did.
LEADFEMALE:No! I wanted you to respect the fact that I could have my own ideas! I-I wanted you to keep on treating me like a son even though I was different from you! I wanted to Well, maybe just once, I wanted you to put everything aside and spend a day with me like the one you just spent with Alex! Steven, I, uh I suppose It's always difficult for me to show any emotion to you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, the way our relationship was I saw affection as a sign of weakness.
LEADMALE:I hope you didn't take it personally.
LEADMALE:You know what really bothered me? When you took Jeffrey Garrett to the father/son picnic.
LEADFEMALE:I explained that to you, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:I thought he was you.
LEADMALE:Hey, I was in a hurry.
SUPMALE:He was about your size.
LEADMALE:Once he was in the car, it was too late.
SUPMALE:What was I gonna do? I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
SUPMALE:I thought inviting him again the next year was too much.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we had to go back.
LEADFEMALE:We were the defending champs in the father/son ping-pong tournament.
SUPMALE:You know, Jeffrey still writes to me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd write to you, too, if you'd taken me to one of the picnics.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, Steven, I I guess I never gave you much reason to like me.
LEADFEMALE:Like you? Damn it.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, I love you.
SUPFEMALE:I never said I didn't love you.
SUPMALE:You never said you did.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it was implied.
SUPFEMALE:It's not enough.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it's enough.
SUPFEMALE:Unless I specifically Say I don't love you, you have to assume that I do.
LEADMALE:I love you, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:I always have.
LEADMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:You know, I always thought I made a lot of mistakes with you, Steven.
LEADMALE:The biggest mistake I ever made was maybe not telling you that I loved you until it was too late.
LEADMALE:Dad, it's never too late.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, are you scared? Am I scared? Is Jake Keaton scared? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Not so much of dying.
SUPFEMALE:But I'm scared of not living anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Well I'm here.
SUPFEMALE:You got some time off tomorrow? I'll make time.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:You want to go hunting? - Uh - I'm just kidding.
SUPFEMALE:We'll find something we can do together.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, dad? Yeah, Steven? There was a song you used to sing to me when I was a kid and I was having trouble sleeping.
LEADMALE:I've been trying to remember what it was, but I can't.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I remember.
SUPMALE:Would you sing it to me? Oh, sure.
SUPMALE:from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli the marine fight song? You used to sing me the marine fight song as a lullaby? It worked like a charm.
LEADFEMALE:we will fight our country's battles on the land and on the sea first to fight for right and freedom 
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, Steven, I got those lists you wanted.
SUPFEMALE: Thanks.
SUPMALE:This one is private contributors.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:This one here is government grants.
OTHERMALE:If Reagan cuts back any more, the white house won't be eligible to get our magazine.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, this will get us off to a good start.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a check for $500 from Dennis ellway.
OTHERMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Why aren't you excited? He sends us a check for $500 every week.
LEADMALE:They always bounce.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:What do you want me to do with it? Deposit it.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe this time we'll get lucky.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess this is one part of public-broadcasting life you won't miss, huh, Arthur? Oh, I don't know After 14 years, you get used to begging and groveling it becomes a way of life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, kids.
SUPMALE:Where you been? Down the hall.
LEADFEMALE:Alex stopped off to watch "wall street week.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, how was it? Well, I found it a little simplistic, but I guess it's okay for your average broker.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, look at you! You're getting cuter every day.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're just saying that, uncle Arthur.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not.
LEADMALE:Yes, he is.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, congratulate me.
OTHERMALE:I just talked wincott industries into donating $5,000 to the station.
OTHERFEMALE:How did you get that money out of wincott? Arthur's been after him for years.
SUPMALE:I explained the tax and public relations benefits to Mr.
LEADMALE:wincott, and he bought it.
SUPFEMALE:I was beautiful.
OTHERMALE:I was gorgeous.
SUPMALE:I was sensational.
LEADMALE:And modest.
LEADFEMALE:No, I wasn't modest.
SUPMALE:I did have to buy him six Martinis and promised that you'd give his wife some airtime for a Latin club.
SUPMALE:Her Latin club? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:They come out, they conjugate a few verbs.
LEADFEMALE:Veni, vidi, vici, e pluribus unum, and they're gone.
LEADMALE:That's crazy, Richard.
LEADFEMALE:You're always talking about originating local programming.
LEADMALE:Here's your opportunity.
LEADFEMALE:Arthur, talk to him.
OTHERFEMALE:What can I say, Steven? That's not my job anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, Arthur.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, Mr.

SUPFEMALE:Sure, I'll handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Those film cans are very heavy.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, maybe you should do it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we'll all go help.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, you don't all have to go.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll stay here and help with the phone campaign.
LEADMALE:I love to talk on the phone.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, don't forget.
SUPMALE:This is business.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Don't start gossiping with any of the donors.
SUPFEMALE:Well, do you want me to To start organizing some numbers or or call or I'm sorry I'm staring, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't get over how fast time has flown by.
LEADMALE:How old are you now? No.
LEADFEMALE:You can't be.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm pretty sure.
SUPMALE:Oh, you've become a Such a beautiful girl.
LEADFEMALE:Or should I say young woman? Girl.
LEADFEMALE:Girl.
OTHERMALE:Young girl.
OTHERFEMALE:It's wonderful to see you growing up, becoming such a beautiful young lady.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh Thank you.
LEADMALE:Now, do you want me to start calling or should I handle incoming calls? Oh, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:That can wait.
LEADMALE:I haven't seen you in ages.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, before we start working, why don't you give your uncle Arthur a hug? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Arthur.
LEADMALE:How did we do today, honey? Not bad.
SUPFEMALE:We got pledges for $7,500.
LEADMALE:Is that counting the money from Dennis ellway? Uh, no.
LEADMALE:Including his money, we have $87,000.
OTHERMALE:Alex, I want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:I need your advice on something.
LEADFEMALE:It's really serious.
LEADFEMALE:Your hair looks great.
SUPFEMALE:Can I go now? Alex, I mean it.
LEADMALE:It's just I've got a problem.
LEADMALE:We all know that, Mallory, but admitting it is the first step.
LEADMALE:Alex, stop it.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, what is it? Well, this problem Uh, see, it's kind of in the neighborhood of sex.
LEADMALE:"The neighborhood of sex"? What, are we talking central-downtown sex or is this a suburb of sex? I'm not sure.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, didn't they show you that film in hygiene class? You know, the one with the baby chickies? Alex, times have changed.
SUPMALE:They show us one with the baby babies.
SUPFEMALE:You sure that, uh, I'm the one you want to talk to about this? I mean, I'm your brother.
LEADMALE:You don't want to reveal anything too personal to me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'll go outside and get a stranger.
LEADMALE:Alex, cut it out! This is really hard for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong? Well, down at the station after everyone else left, I was alone with Arthur, and Well, I think he made a pass at me.
LEADMALE:Arthur? Uncle Arthur? Come on.
SUPFEMALE:He's known you since you were born.
LEADMALE:He used to bathe you when you were a baby.
SUPFEMALE:I think he wants his old job back.
LEADFEMALE:I can't I can't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:There has to be some reasonable explanation.
SUPMALE:There might be.
SUPFEMALE:Like I said, I'm not sure it was a pass, but What exactly did he do? Well, he held my hands, and, uh He gave me a kiss and then a hug.
LEADFEMALE:He's friendly, Mallory.
SUPMALE:He hugged me real tight.
LEADMALE:He's a warm person.
LEADFEMALE:And then he patted me on the behind.
OTHERMALE:Doesn't mean anything.
LEADFEMALE:Ballplayers do it all the time.
SUPFEMALE:I'd understand if I'd just hit a home run.
SUPFEMALE:He thinks you're cute, that's all.
OTHERMALE:Look, uncle Arthur just wouldn't do something like that.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure? I'm positive.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:I've never been so happy to be wrong about something in my life.
LEADFEMALE:I feel terrible that I even suspected him.
OTHERMALE:Don't feel bad about it.
LEADMALE:It's easy to misinterpret other people's actions, especially in these days of ambiguous sexual roles.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I guess that's what I did.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it happens to all of us.
LEADMALE:First time a girl kissed me good night I thought she was in love with me.
SUPFEMALE:Now I realize sometimes they kiss me good night to stop me from talking.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, thanks a lot.
OTHERFEMALE:You've really been supportive and understanding.
LEADMALE:It's kind of a nice surprise, since you're usually such a creep.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:It means a lot to me.
LEADFEMALE:"Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Steven Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:"I'm the general manager "of your public television station, wks.
LEADFEMALE:"We desperately need your help.
LEADFEMALE:"If each one of you could just look into your hearts and then reach into your Pocketbook, we may" hold hold it Hold it right there, dad.
LEADFEMALE:That approach is all wrong.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with it? I wrote it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you sound desperate.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody's gonna want to give you money if you sound like you really need it.
SUPMALE:Well, I thought it sounded okay.
SUPMALE:Don't patronize him.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean it.
OTHERFEMALE:Your father is a terrific spokesman for the station.
OTHERMALE:He's warm, he's appealing Arthur, really, it's getting late.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a break.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Quiet, kids.
SUPFEMALE:Your uncle Arthur has the floor.
LEADMALE:Go on, Arthur.
LEADMALE:As I recall, your last words were, uh, "warm and appealing.
LEADFEMALE:" May I be excused? I have a feeling this could get sticky.
SUPFEMALE:You can help me get dessert.
OTHERFEMALE:If you'd like.
SUPFEMALE:Can I help too? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Steven, I'm gonna need your help to get the tray down.
OTHERMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Warm and appealing.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mallory, could you wait a second? Uh, no, I don't think I can.
LEADFEMALE:See, everybody has to carry their own desserts.
SUPFEMALE:House rules.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to talk to you about yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Yesterday? Yes.
LEADMALE:Down at the station? Uh, the station.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that was fun stuffing those envelopes I'm not talking about envelopes.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what else is there? Let's be honest, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:When I gave you that big hug, you thought I was Well, making a pass at you, didn't you? Well, maybe.
SUPFEMALE:I thought so.
SUPMALE:I'm so glad I brought it up.
OTHERMALE:It's just that I was so happy to see you, I gave you a big hug, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I'm sorry if you thought it was too big.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't, really.
LEADMALE:Look, I want you to know that I think of you only in one way, and that's as little Mallory.
SUPMALE:And all I want is for you to think of me as your uncle Arthur.
SUPFEMALE:That's all I want, too.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:So if I did anything to make you think of me in any other way, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Well, I apologize for jumping to any conclusions.
OTHERMALE:Your apology is totally unnecessary.
SUPMALE:So is yours.
OTHERFEMALE:No hard feelings? No hard feelings, no.
LEADMALE:"And, uh, so if you, uh, feel like giving, give.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't, don't.
LEADFEMALE:" I think you've gone too far the other way now.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you're too low-pressure.
OTHERFEMALE:Kids, what do you think? You think it's too long? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Are they gonna validate parking down at the station? Maybe you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll keep working on it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, by the way, I thought I'd throw in a few nice words about Arthur since he is leaving and all.
OTHERFEMALE:Make a speech about Arthur on TV? Uh, sure.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of a going-away present.
LEADFEMALE:He'll get a kick out of it, and I think he deserves a little attention, don't you? I know he wants some.
SUPFEMALE:"Arthur press is a man we can all be proud of.
SUPMALE:A man who works hard and plays hard.
SUPMALE:" Uh, dad, I don't know about that last line.
LEADMALE:Oh, what's wrong with it? Well, I just don't think anybody cares how hard Arthur plays.
SUPMALE:I know I don't.
OTHERMALE:Well, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you're right.
SUPFEMALE:"Arthur's kindness, his warmth, and his sincerity "are an inspiration.
SUPMALE:"He's a man who has helped all of us at the station "feel like we're not just co-workers, "we're one big happy family.
OTHERFEMALE:You can always count on Arthur for a smile or a hug.
LEADMALE:" That's true.
LEADFEMALE:"So, Arthur, it is with sadness that I say adieu.
SUPFEMALE:"But I know that at wggk they'll say howdy-do to you.
LEADFEMALE:" Well? Well, what do you think? It's nice.
LEADMALE:It it's a little long.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, okay, okay.
LEADMALE:This isn't the final draft.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll, uh, make it a little shorter.
OTHERMALE:I've already cut out half the speech.
SUPFEMALE:You did say some very nice things though, Steven.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot.
LEADFEMALE:I'll try to think of some shorter nice things now.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, guys, you got a kitchen to clean.
SUPFEMALE:We've got a lot of dirty dishes.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, you want to wash or dry? I'll dry.
SUPFEMALE:There's more dignity to drying.
OTHERFEMALE:Guys? Uh, mom, Alex and I will be right with you.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to, uh, straighten up in here.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? It's Everything's okay.
SUPFEMALE:It's fine! We're gonna clean up this mess.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, what's going on? It's uncle Arthur.
LEADMALE:He kissed me, Alex, on the lips.
OTHERFEMALE:Hard.
LEADFEMALE:They don't do that when you hit a home run, do they? Not usually, no.
LEADFEMALE:Close game.
SUPMALE:World series.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:I admit there's a problem here.
LEADMALE:Help me, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what to do.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Just don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Let's work this out logically.
SUPFEMALE:Important thing is you're okay, right? I guess so, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do we know? We know you're okay, and uncle Arthur isn't, right? So it's one-one.
LEADMALE:Alex, you're not helping.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying.
LEADMALE:I'm I'm trying.
SUPMALE:Can you try harder? Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I think the thing to do is I-I mean I mean, this is just my opinion, but I think it's the right thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:What? Talk to your mother.
SUPMALE:Alex, no! Mom! Come here, quick! What's wrong? Mallory wants to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:I'd, uh, stay, Mallory, but I think you'd be more comfortable if I left.
LEADMALE:I know I would.
OTHERMALE:What's up? Mom, don't get mad at me for saying this, but uncle Arthur made a pass at me.
LEADFEMALE:Arthur? Are you sure? Mom, I'm positive.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, when you say a "pass" I mean, a pass, with his hands and his lips.
LEADMALE:He did it twice Once down at the station, and then again last night while you were in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Did he hurt you? No, but he scared me.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, I'm so embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, you shouldn't be embarrassed.
LEADMALE:You didn't do anything wrong.
LEADMALE:I just I can't understand why he would do something like this.
LEADFEMALE:No, neither can I.
OTHERMALE:But you can bet we'll find out when we talk to him.
OTHERMALE:Talk to him? Oh, mom, I couldn't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Can't we just pretend this never happened? No, honey, no.
SUPMALE:That's one thing we can't do.
LEADFEMALE:These things happen too often to pretend that they don't exist.
LEADMALE:Did it ever happen to you? Uh, y-yes, it did.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, a friend of the family, well, grabbed me one time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what did you do? Went upstairs, put on "American bandstand," and did the twist.
LEADMALE:I was confused.
LEADMALE:I was embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:I-I thought maybe it was my fault.
SUPMALE:I thought maybe I'd misinterpreted what he did.
LEADFEMALE:And even if he really meant to do it, what good was telling anybody gonna do? That's how I feel.
SUPMALE:How can I accuse him of being so rotten after all the wonderful things he's done for me over the years? Mallory, listen to me.
LEADMALE:You don't want him to do it to you again, and you don't want him to do it to any other girls, do you? Okay, I guess you're right.
SUPMALE:But, I mean, he's such a good friend of dad's.
LEADMALE:I-I'm not saying this is gonna be easy.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, maybe it would be better if it's me that talks to Arthur instead of your dad.
OTHERFEMALE:But one thing I'm sure of, this This thing is gonna be taken care of, okay? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I've come up with a new approach.
SUPMALE:Who wants to hear a few nice words about Arthur? Okay, I'll shorten it some more.
LEADFEMALE:About three minutes to go, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I had more time.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:They're just finishing up on that documentary, "
LEADMALE:Your silent friend in the garden.
LEADMALE:" It should be a big ratings-grabber, that one.
OTHERFEMALE:You never know.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that was Arthur's baby, his last hurrah.
LEADFEMALE:Gives you a good idea why he's moving on.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Richard.
OTHERMALE:I agree that people with, uh, less than 60 acres may find this one a little slow, but there's something to remember about Arthur press He was there at the beginning, when public broadcasting was just a baby.
LEADMALE:And so were you.
SUPFEMALE:He, uh, deserves a little respect.
OTHERFEMALE:Save it for the speech, Steve.
OTHERFEMALE:Two minutes.
LEADMALE:Hey, dad, I just wanted to come and wish you luck.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be up here answering phones if you need me.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I-i can start off in one of two ways, Alex, with a history of the station or, uh, maybe I should start with a direct appeal for money.
LEADMALE:After the show that's on right now? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'd start with an alarm clock.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hi, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Now, remember, dad.
LEADFEMALE:When you're making your speech, be humble, but try to maintain your pride.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do my best.
LEADMALE:Here's a kiss for good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you, sweetie.
SUPMALE:Oh, how about you two? A little kiss for luck? I got a warmer greeting at my army physical.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Turn to the left and cough.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:You seen Arthur? No, but he should be out here any minute.
OTHERMALE:Well, when you see him, would tell him I want to talk to him? It's very important.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Anything wrong? No! No.
LEADMALE:About 30 seconds, Steve.
SUPMALE:Okay, thank you.
LEADMALE:You know, Steven, I've seen that fertilizer film a hundred times.

SUPFEMALE:Arthur, I just have one little question.
LEADFEMALE:What, Steve? Can you think of one reason why I shouldn't kill you? Because it didn't happen like that, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Then why don't you tell us exactly what happened? I don't remember exactly, but you know me.

SUPMALE:Other people get divorced.
SUPMALE:Other people get older.
SUPMALE:And they don't do what you did.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what came over me.
OTHERFEMALE:It was an uncontrollable impulse, a one-in-a-million thing.
SUPFEMALE:It happened twice.

SUPMALE:We were like family, Arthur.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want to hurt her.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, but you did.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:I've been screwing up everything in my life these days.
LEADMALE:I had it once, remember, Steve? I was the guy who said, "sesame street Let's go with it.
LEADFEMALE:" First time I saw big bird, I said, "that bird's a star.
SUPFEMALE:" I never liked Mr.

LEADMALE:Why can't he change his shoes before the show? Arthur Why don't you stop thinking about yourself for a minute? Think about what you did to that little girl.

SUPMALE:It's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:You used to tell me everything.
LEADMALE:I'm older now.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not as easy.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, dad.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, too.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this.
SUPMALE:Is that the fastest he can count votes? Alex, will you relax? I can't I can't relax.
OTHERFEMALE:Being editor is important to me.
LEADMALE:You're gonna be the new editor.
LEADMALE:I can feel it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, how can you be so sure? You ran unopposed.
SUPMALE:I didn't vote for him.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you mark your ballot? "Not him.
LEADFEMALE:" Thanks for your confidence.
LEADMALE:All right, everybody.
OTHERMALE:Let me have your attention, please.
LEADMALE:Here are the results of today's election.
OTHERFEMALE:In the balloting for editor, Alex Keaton, 21.
OTHERFEMALE:Not him, 17.
SUPFEMALE:I give you the new editor of the Harding hurrah, Alex Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:winkler.
OTHERMALE:And, uh, thanks to all of you for giving me this opportunity.
LEADFEMALE:"The history of journalism is as old as the history of history itself.
OTHERFEMALE:" "Since the invention of movable type in the middle 15th century" oh, it sounded great, Alex.
LEADMALE:It's too bad that bell cut you off like that.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mr.
SUPMALE:winkler, you want to hear the rest of my speech? Uh, well, it's just a matter of, uh Well, how can I phrase this? No, I don't want to hear it.
LEADMALE:You know, I have got some big plans for this paper.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna put the Harding herald on the map.
SUPMALE:Uh, the name of the paper is the Harding hurrah, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, well, that's the first thing.
LEADMALE:See, we got to change that.
LEADMALE:See, it's not a real dynamic name, you know? None of the big city papers have that name.
LEADFEMALE:There's no New York hurrah, or Detroit free hurrah.
OTHERMALE:Alex, let me give you some advice, will you? We got a good little paper here.
LEADMALE:Don't rock the boat.
SUPFEMALE:Good little pape Mr.
LEADFEMALE:winkler, last year's biggest story was, uh, "math team gets new sweatsuits.
LEADFEMALE:" Yeah! That was an exclusive, Alex.
SUPMALE:I'm still getting letters on that one.
LEADMALE:There's a choice to be made here, Mr.
LEADMALE:winkler.
LEADMALE:We can continue trudging along with feet of Clay, printing unimportant drivel, or we can reach out for immortality.
LEADFEMALE:Which would you rather do? Stick with the drivel.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Alex Did you really mean what you said about printing serious stories? You bet I did.
LEADMALE:Well, what if I told you that I've been assigned to work part time in the principal's office and I have access to everything that comes in there? I'd say the principal is crazy, but I'd tell you to keep talking.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, if I do, you got to promise not to let on how you found out.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, when you drilled that hole in the girls' bathroom, did I tell anyone? You told everybody.
SUPMALE:Okay, but I wasn't editor then.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:How do the words "scandal" and "cover-up" sound to you? Beautiful.
LEADMALE:Then listen to this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure you're aware that our high school has the highest grade point average in the district? Yeah, that comes under the category of unexplained phenomena.
SUPFEMALE:You know how we achieved that honor? By cheating.
SUPFEMALE:Ralph rappaport got ahold of a copy of the algebra final, and 27 students were caught buying it.
LEADFEMALE:The principal is sitting on the story 'cause he doesn't want to lose his number-one rating.
OTHERMALE:This is fantastic! I mean, it's terrible.
OTHERMALE:It's disgraceful.
LEADMALE:Let's just be glad it happened here.
LEADFEMALE:I got a lot of stuff on this in my locker.
LEADFEMALE:I got a memo from the principal.
LEADMALE:I got copies of the test.
SUPMALE:Listen.
LEADMALE:Names, Howie.
SUPMALE:We need names.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you need names, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:No, you could do the story without names.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, of course we could do the story without them, but I think names would really spice it up.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, one of those names is the same as yours.
SUPFEMALE:Alex Friedman is on that list? Not the same first name.
LEADFEMALE:The same last name.
LEADMALE:Mallory? That's the one.
LEADFEMALE:Want to go out and kick around the soccer ball? Jennifer, that would involve three of the things I most despise Dirt, sweat, and the possibility of breaking a nail.
LEADMALE:Guess we won't be seeing you on the cover of sports illustrated.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Alex, do you want to go practice soccer with me? No, last time I practiced with you, I was black and blue the next day.
LEADMALE:I'll take it easy on you this time.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Just go on ahead outside and start without me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be there in a minute.
LEADMALE:You promise? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Just go on outside, okay? Don't humor me, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Mallory, I have to talk to you about something.
LEADMALE:Can't it wait, Alex? I'm really busy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is kind of important.
SUPFEMALE:You see, I found out about the algebra test.
SUPFEMALE:I know you cheated on it.
SUPFEMALE:How'd you find out? Nobody's supposed to know about that.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I happen to be editor of the Harding herald.
LEADMALE:It's my job to know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Alex, you haven't told anyone, have you? No.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Whatever you do, don't tell mom and dad, okay? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, don't tell anyone, 'cause they could tell their parents, and then they could tell mom and dad.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:So you'll keep this absolutely quiet, you won't tell anyone at all? Okay.
OTHERMALE:I can go along with that, except for one minor exception.
SUPFEMALE:What? It may be the lead story in tomorrow's school paper.
SUPFEMALE:What?! Are you crazy?! Mallory, the principal is covering up a scandal here, and I think the people have a right to know about it.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, your can't print that! Can't print what? Oh, it's a story about, uh, the football team.
LEADMALE:The prom! Which is it? The prom.
LEADMALE:The football team.
SUPMALE:It's a prom for the football team.
LEADMALE:Why are they having the prom in November? Beat the June rush.
LEADMALE:It's a practice prom.
LEADMALE:If it works out, then they'll have the real one in June.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:That's not what it's about.
LEADMALE:There's this big story brewing at school, and I don't know whether or not I should print it.
LEADMALE:What's it about? Well, I'm not sure you need to know what it's about.
OTHERFEMALE:You definitely don't need to know what it's about.
SUPMALE:Well, what's the problem, then? The problem is, I have a story that'll shake the entire school district to its very foundations.
LEADMALE:Well, that doesn't seem like a problem necessarily.
LEADMALE:But if I print it, some people might get hurt.
SUPMALE:Some innocent, defenseless people.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh, I see.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, we certainly don't want that to happen, do we? I understand we don't want to hurt people's feelings, but isn't there a greater responsibility to be served here? That's definitely true.
SUPMALE:Whose side are you on, dad? I'm not on anybody's side.
LEADFEMALE:I hardly know what we're talking about.
LEADFEMALE:The details aren't important here.
LEADFEMALE:The issue here is this If there's important information being covered up by people in high places, isn't it the responsibility of a journalist to uncover it? Absolutely.
LEADMALE:It's important for the press to keep an eye on the people in power to make sure they don't abuse it.
SUPMALE:A good example is when, uh, woodward and Bernstein exposed Watergate.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother's right.
LEADFEMALE:There is no higher standard in journalism than truth.
LEADMALE:What if the truth embarrasses people? Well, that's sometimes an unfortunate consequence.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, whether or not you print the story is ultimately your decision.
LEADFEMALE:As I look back over the history of journalism, I could point to countless dilemmas of this nature, but just remember, ever since the invention of movable type in the middle of the 15th century, m Any word from winkler? No, he's still reading it.
LEADMALE:We go to press in 20 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't know I gave you the story, does he? Yeah, he knows.
SUPMALE:The the byline is "by Alex Keaton, as told to him by Howie Samuels.
OTHERMALE:" I got to admit, Alex, I never thought you'd have the guts to write it.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:It's not a compliment.
LEADMALE:But I don't care what you say, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I think winkler's doing a fine job.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:winkler.
LEADFEMALE:Howie, would you excuse us for a minute, please? Certainly.
LEADMALE:Take more than a minute, if you like.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I've read your story on the cheating scandal.
LEADFEMALE:Very well done.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Excellent reporting.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:I think your documentation is flawless, your conclusions are well thought out.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:It's a pity we can't print it.
LEADMALE:Perfect.
SUPMALE:What do you mean, "can't print it"? This is a private matter between the principal and the offending students.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think it's our place to interfere, and I know he doesn't want any publicity on it now.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but this is a major news story.
LEADFEMALE:The the public has a right to know.
LEADFEMALE:Not in this case.
LEADMALE:Alex, let me tell you something.
LEADMALE:The principal of a high school is always right.
LEADMALE:If Dr.
LEADFEMALE:schulte believes that the world is flat Which he does, by the way Then the world is flat.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, but But that's censorship.
SUPMALE:Just what kind of things do you want us to print? Well, that story about the sweatsuits was interesting.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear that? I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:He's scared.
LEADFEMALE:The the principal could get mad and punish him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you don't think he'd fire Mr.
SUPMALE:winkler, do you? He'd do worse.
SUPFEMALE:Last year when he got mad at Mr.
OTHERMALE:peabody, he made him teach sex education to the kids with behavior problems.
LEADFEMALE:It's not easy talking about the birds and the bees when someone's throwing a hubcap at you.
LEADFEMALE:If I sit on this story, I'm gonna be just as guilty as the kids who cheated.
SUPMALE:Well, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna print it.
OTHERFEMALE:Aren't you forgetting that Mallory's on the list? Howie, I'm not forgetting.
SUPMALE:Truth is the highest standard in journalism.
LEADMALE:Like I said, print it.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, everyone.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:What's the story? Maybe I should've phrased that differently.
SUPMALE:I don't think it would've helped.
LEADMALE:What's going on, Howie? Let me put it this way If you were ever thinking of leaving school and joining the circus, now would be a good time.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Why are they mad at me? They think you're a fink.
LEADMALE:But I was exposing a cover-up.
LEADMALE:The cover-up's not the point.
LEADMALE:It's the people who are underneath the covers.
LEADFEMALE:You listed every person's name.
OTHERFEMALE:Now their teachers have to look at them like they're cheaters, and the principal has to suspend them.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I-i never thought of it that way.
LEADFEMALE:I expected Dr.
LEADMALE:schulte to be mad, but He is mad.
LEADFEMALE:He's madder than he was when Ralph rappaport gave that speech to the pta in drag.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid to ask this, but how did winkler take it? I'm not sure.
OTHERMALE:He lost the power of speech after he saw the article.
LEADMALE:I have a feeling he's recovered it.
LEADFEMALE:Alex Alex, I think you owe me an explanation.
SUPMALE:Um, Mr.
LEADMALE:winkler, I'm sorry I had to disobey you.
SUPMALE:I-I really am, but I felt it was my duty as editor to publish the story.
SUPFEMALE:As of this moment, you are relieved of your duties as editor.
SUPFEMALE:You are through, Alex.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to write for this paper anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:Come to think of it, I don't even want you to read it! And I'll tell you something else.
LEADFEMALE:If schulte makes me teach sex education to kids with behavior problems, I'm bringing you along as a model! In answer to your question, Alex, I don't think he took it very well.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to find Mallory.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:You think that's a good idea? Mallory's my sister.
LEADMALE:I think she knows I had a good reason for doing what I did.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory! I was just going to look for you.
LEADFEMALE:I want to talk to you about the story.
LEADMALE:Don't talk to me, Alex Ever again.
OTHERFEMALE:How much does the circus pay? Is this true, Mallory? Did you buy a copy of the test? Actually, I didn't buy it.
SUPMALE:Ralph rappaport gave me one for free.
LEADFEMALE:I think he likes me.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look, Mallory, this is serious.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you realize that? A lot of kids did it.
OTHERMALE:It didn't seem like that big a deal.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it is a big deal, and I think you owe us more of an explanation.
LEADFEMALE:Would you be happier if I failed the test? We'd be happier if you failed on your own, than if you got an "a" by cheating.
OTHERFEMALE:If you hadn't cheated, would you have failed the test? No.
LEADMALE:I probably would've got a "c.
LEADMALE:" So? Listen, a "c" is nothing to be ashamed of.
LEADMALE:Your father got lots of c's when he was in school.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:If you W-wai w-wait I I-I wouldn't say lots of c's.
LEADMALE:Uh, uh, occasionally, a "c" crept in.
LEADMALE:I don't remember exactly, but in college, overall, I think I had a That's exactly what I mean! Grades are important to you.
LEADFEMALE:How would you feel if Alex came home with a "c"? Alex wouldn't come home with a "c.
OTHERFEMALE:" He'd still be there arguing with the teacher.
SUPMALE:Alex wouldn't get a "c" 'cause Alex doesn't get c's.
LEADMALE:Why don't we leave Alex out of this? Well, I can't leave him out of it, 'cause he's part of it! What do you mean? You don't realize it, but it's not easy being Alex's sister.
SUPMALE:I mean, every time I walk into a class, it's the same thing.
LEADMALE:"Mallory Keaton, are you any relation to Alex Keaton?" I say I am.
SUPFEMALE:And then, when I turn in my homework for the first time, there's always this surprised reaction.
LEADMALE:"Are you sure you're Alex Keaton's sister?" Well, for once, just once, I wanted to get a higher grade than him.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't, uh, realize it was that rough for you at school.
SUPMALE:I can't help it that I'm not as smart as Alex is.
LEADMALE:It's not my fault.
LEADMALE:It's not that you're not as smar as Alex.
SUPMALE:You're not as motivated as Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Napoleon wasn't as motivated as Alex.
SUPFEMALE:But that doesn't mean you can't work harder than you do.
SUPMALE:We we've talked about this before.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, it's funny.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I'd be so happy to get an "a" in algebra, but instead, I felt ashamed.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry I did it.
LEADFEMALE:I really am.
SUPMALE:Well We appreciate you realize that what you did was wrong.
LEADMALE:While we have a lot of sympathy for what you said, it really doesn't excuse what you did.
OTHERMALE:Your father and I will talk it over and figure out what to do about it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Mom, do we have another soccer ball? What happened to the one you were playing with? I gave it to Mrs.
LEADMALE:obeck next door.
LEADMALE:It was kind of a surprise.
LEADMALE:It must have been.
LEADFEMALE:She's 61 years old.
LEADFEMALE:I think the surprise was the way it was delivered.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, you didn't break.
OTHERMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:obeck's kitchen window again, did you? No, I broke her bedroom window.
LEADMALE:But I'll pay for it.
LEADFEMALE:How? With the advance on my allowance that I'm about to ask for.
LEADMALE:Uh, we'll talk about this later.
LEADFEMALE:Right now, you'd better go apologize to Mrs.
LEADMALE:obeck.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:But I won't be back for a while.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:obeck always makes me listen to Lawrence Welk records with her.
SUPMALE:Hey, Alex, do you want to go over to Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:obeck's with me? No.
LEADMALE:I'm not really in the mood for Lawrence Welk.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:I guess she told you, huh? She's pretty upset, Alex.
LEADMALE:The whole school is upset.
LEADMALE:The kids hate me.
LEADFEMALE:Winkler fired me.
LEADMALE:The principal yelled at me for two hours.
SUPMALE:A-and when he left the room for 20 minutes, he had the secretary come in and yell.
LEADFEMALE:Was printing the story worth all that, Alex? Dad, don't you remember what you said to me yesterday? You, yourself, said that there's no higher standard in journalism than truth.
SUPMALE:I was speaking in general terms, Alex.
LEADMALE:You're the ones who said that That the press has to keep an eye on the people in power, and Dr.
LEADMALE:schulte abused his when he tried to kill the story.
SUPFEMALE:We're not concerned about Dr.
SUPMALE:schulte.
SUPMALE:We're worried about Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:She's going to be suspended for a few days, and she's been embarrassed in front of the teachers and her friends.
LEADMALE:Wouldn't it be hypocritical of me to have pulled the story because I wanted to protect my sister? Alex, when I s When I spoke to you about the importance of truth, I left out something just as important Compassion.
OTHERFEMALE:Compass how much compassion did you feel when woodward and Bernstein exposed the Watergate cover-up? Wha did you feel sorry for Nixon? Yeah, I felt sorry for him! O-o-okay, I admit, w-w-we had a few people over.
LEADFEMALE:We we may have opened a bottle of champagne.
SUPMALE:Or two.
LEADFEMALE:We sang some songs, but But, uh, in between the dancing and the fireworks we we all felt a twinge of sympathy for the man.
LEADFEMALE:It's hardly a seminar in compassion.
LEADMALE:The situations are not comparable, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Nixon was a public official who betrayed the trust of an entire country.
LEADFEMALE:That's a matter of opinion.
LEADFEMALE:These are kids who cheated on an algebra test.
SUPMALE:Now, I-I'm not saying that's right, but it is not an impeachable offense.
SUPMALE:What is wrong with you guys?! There was a cover-up going on here! Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I think you had another option.
SUPMALE:That's all.
LEADFEMALE:What was that? To print the story on the cover-up without including all the names.
SUPFEMALE:I never wanted to hurt anybody.
SUPMALE:Can I come in? The fink with you? No.
OTHERFEMALE:No finks.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:I've got some news that'll cheer you up.
LEADMALE:Alex moved out? No.
SUPFEMALE:Not quite as good.
LEADFEMALE:My team won the soccer game! Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:I scored a goal with my head.
SUPMALE:Jen, I'm really happy for you.
LEADFEMALE:I also scored a goal with someone else's head.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone, okay? Look, I know you're feeling low right now, but I just want you to know two things.
LEADMALE:What are they? Well, first, I think you're a great sister.
SUPFEMALE:You make me laugh, you make me really feel like you really care about me, and you're fun to be with.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:And the other thing I want you to know is that Alex wants to talk to you, and he's waiting outside.
SUPMALE:You should've stopped after the first one.
SUPMALE:Can I come in? No.
LEADMALE:Go away.
LEADMALE:Thanks for respecting my wishes.
LEADFEMALE:Try to go easy on each other.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to be an only child.
SUPMALE:Are those for me? You trying to make up or antagonize me? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't have time to buy new flowers.
LEADMALE:Besides, it's the thought that counts.
LEADMALE:Couldn't you just have had the thought delivered? Look I know you feel bad about getting caught cheating.
LEADFEMALE:It's embarrassing.
LEADMALE:It's humiliating.
SUPFEMALE:It's shameful.
SUPMALE:So far, this isn't the greatest apology I've ever heard.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I shouldn't have printed your name, or any of the names.
SUPFEMALE:I-I-i was just so excited to be elected editor.
SUPMALE:I guess I just got carried away.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you carried me away with you.
LEADMALE:Why did you do it, Mallory? If you were having trouble, you should have come to see me.
OTHERMALE:I'm great in math.
LEADFEMALE:That's the problem.
SUPMALE:You are, and I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:So? I would've helped you.
SUPMALE:You always laugh at me, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:No, I don't.
LEADFEMALE:I may chuckle.
SUPFEMALE:An occasional guffaw.
OTHERMALE:You don't realize how hard it is to be your sister.
SUPMALE:I mean, a guy who's gotten straight a's since sandbox.
SUPMALE:You could've done better in sandbox, too, if you'd just applied yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Look, maybe there's some kind of therapy group you can join for sisters of geniuses.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Alex.
OTHERMALE:We both made mistakes, and we're both hurting because of them.
LEADMALE:But I don't think it's gonna do either of us any good to hate each other.
SUPMALE:Maybe we should help each other instead.
LEADFEMALE:How? I could help you with your homework.
LEADMALE:Then you then you wouldn't have to cheat again.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to do for you? Clean your room? Dust your calculators? No, all I want you to do is be my friend.
SUPFEMALE:That's all.
LEADFEMALE:I'd rather dust your calculators.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:I made a mistake.
LEADMALE:Don't you think it takes a big man to admit that? Evidently not.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Friends again? Aah! Ow! You dug your nails into my hand.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, did I? So sorry.
SUPMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Let's do your homework.
SUPFEMALE:No, Alex.
LEADMALE:You're just gonna make fun of me.
LEADFEMALE:I am not.
LEADMALE:Now, what are you studying? Math.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? How'd you do on your last test? I got an "a.
LEADMALE:" That's right.
LEADMALE:All right, here's where we are now.
SUPFEMALE:Right here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, this is good.
OTHERMALE:This is good.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:"Two trains leave central station at noon.
SUPFEMALE:"One's heading east, traveling at 82 miles per hour, the other one is traveling west at 67 miles per hour.
SUPFEMALE:" What kind of trains are they? What do you mean, "what kind of trains are they?" That has nothing to do with the problem.
LEADMALE:It's not important.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Um"Eastbound train stops three times "for a total of one hour, "and the westbound is an express and it doesn't stop at all.
LEADMALE:"So after six hours, which train has traveled the furthest distance?" All right.
LEADMALE:You ready? Yeah, how many trains did you say there were? I'm kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:How many? Two.
SUPMALE:Are they going east or west? It doesn't matter.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course it matters.
SUPFEMALE:Say your family lives in California, and you're going south.
OTHERMALE:You don't want them to end up in Maine.
SUPFEMALE:You're absolutely right.
SUPMALE:I don't know why I didn't say it.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Now, the first train's going Right.
OTHERMALE:Eighty Two.
LEADMALE:And the second train's going Right.
LEADFEMALE:Sixty Seven? Seven.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't they just take a plane? 
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:come on, Alex, I need to talk to you about this.
SUPMALE:Forget it, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:I don't want to discuss it with you.
LEADMALE:Alex, you're my older brother.
OTHERFEMALE:I look to you for guidance.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:What do you want to know? Who do you like in today's game, notre dame or usc? Well, I'd have to go with usc.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Usc is favored by 2 1/2.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'd better go with notre dame.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, you always ask me what team I'd pick and then you go and bet the other side.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Works every time.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here, mom? Nothing, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:I knew it.
SUPMALE:I knew it.
SUPMALE:Bean sprouts in the stuffing.
OTHERMALE:What are you guys, the vegetable patrol? Mom, this is Thanksgiving, not Chinese new year.
SUPMALE:I just want to try something a little different this year.
SUPFEMALE:That's all.
SUPFEMALE:This is a traditional American holiday.
SUPFEMALE:How is Jennifer supposed to know what Thanksgiving's all about if you insist on serving foreign food? I know what Thanksgiving's all about, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:It's when the Indians and the pilgrims ate together and the Indians got stuck with the check.
LEADFEMALE:That's not how it happened at all, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:You have to understand that civilization marches forward, and it marches better on paved roads.
OTHERMALE:The Indians had the land first, Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but they weren't using it.
SUPFEMALE:They were just roaming around, cooking outdoors, wearing beads, living in tents Just like mom and dad used to.
LEADMALE:Alex, the fact is, we stole that land from the Indians.
SUPMALE:What do you want us to do now, mom, give it back? Yeah, starting with your room.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, look at these, Elyse! I found them in the attic.
SUPFEMALE:I figure we can use some of them today.
SUPFEMALE:This is so embarrassing.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you two are gonna go out there and make fools of yourselves this afternoon.
LEADMALE:We're going out to demonstrate against nuclear arms.
OTHERMALE:There's nothing foolish about that.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think this is very useful now.
LEADMALE:It wasn't that useful then.
LEADMALE:Mcgovern, muskie, McCarthy.
LEADMALE:You guys really knew how to pick the winners, didn't you? Maybe that's where you get it from, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Aren't you going to feel ridiculous? You're going to be the oldest ones by 50 years.
OTHERFEMALE:That's okay, Mallory.
SUPMALE:They can take our pulse every half hour.
LEADFEMALE:It's a shame you kids don't realize the importance of this issue.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we're not talking about repainting the fire hydrants.
OTHERFEMALE:We're talking about the future of mankind.
SUPMALE:The question you kids should be asking is, why we continue to make hydrogen bombs when we already have enough to kill the Russians Don't be so melodramatic, mom.
SUPMALE:From the beginning of time there's been weapons, and there's always been a fringe element who've overreacted.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'm sure that even in the early days there were bleeding-heart cavemen running around with signs that said, "make love not clubs.
SUPFEMALE:" Alex, are you actually in favor of nuclear weapons? I'm in favor of us having them, not using them.
SUPMALE:Why do we have them if we're not gonna use them? That's a dumb question, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:It's called a deterrent force.
OTHERFEMALE:Do both sides have a "detergent" force? "Deterrent" force, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:It means that the more weapons both sides have, the less chance that either side will have to use them.
SUPMALE:Why can't both sides just have no bombs? It's too late.
LEADMALE:We already paid for 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Well, your father and I don't think it's too late.
LEADFEMALE:Neither do a lot of other people.
LEADMALE:They expect a very big crowd out there today.
SUPMALE:Come on, admit it You two are just going out there because it makes you feel young and alive again.
LEADMALE:Uh, no, uh, we're going out there so that someday you can feel old and alive.
LEADMALE:Daddy I want you to know that I'm behind what you and mommy are doing 100%.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:I'm very happy to hear that.
LEADMALE:If I didn't have to supervise the cooking, I'd go with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Grandma and grandpa will be here, and grandma will do all the cooking.
LEADMALE:That's what I'm talking about.
LEADMALE:Grandma is an excellent cook.
LEADMALE:An excellent cook? Mom, I'm using one of last year's biscuits as a doorstop.
SUPFEMALE:What does "flower power" mean? Oh, it was a symbol of that twisted era.
LEADMALE:You know, love, flowers, peace.
SUPMALE:Gives me the creeps.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, don't listen to him! Flower power was another way of telling people to put down their weapons and to give each other flowers and love instead.
LEADFEMALE:For a while, all the girls were wearing flowers in their hair.
LEADMALE:Did you, mommy? Mm-hmm, until your dad made me stop.
LEADMALE:Didn't he like flower power? Well, yes, but he had hay fever.
SUPMALE:It was a very difficult period for him.
SUPFEMALE: Oh, they're here! Happy Thanksgiving! Oh, let me take it.
LEADMALE:Why don't you guys sit down? I'll put some water on for tea.
LEADFEMALE:Kate, you didn't have to bring your own dishes.
LEADMALE:Those are biscuits.
LEADMALE:I think they came out a little lighter this year.
LEADFEMALE:She baked them last night so, uh, she could have more time for the pies today.
LEADMALE:Uh, grandma, you're baking pies? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I don't know if our oven's working.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, the oven's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, we're really pleased to see you, but we didn't expect you here so soon.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we wanted to spend as much time with you as possible.
OTHERFEMALE:Also, our TV's broken, and grandpa wants to see the game.
LEADMALE:Who do you pick this game, gramp? Aw, are you kidding? Uh, notre dame.
LEADMALE:Uh, 2 1/2 points It's a steal.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:See, Alex? We would have been here earlier, but we got held up in traffic.
LEADMALE:There's some kind of dumb demonstration starting up downtown.
LEADMALE:What kind of idiots would demonstrate on Thanksgiving? Just your everyday run-of-the-mill ones.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, dad, Steven and I are planning on going to that demonstration.
LEADFEMALE:Ohhhh You almost had me going, there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, for a minute I believed you.
LEADMALE:Well, it's true, dad, we're going.
OTHERFEMALE:Aah.
SUPFEMALE:What's the issue this week? Uh, the, the Chad-Sudan border dispute? Uh, more fluoride in the water.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, more fluoride in the toothpaste.
SUPMALE:Nuclear disarmament.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, here we go again.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, Kate, they've even got the old signs out.
SUPMALE:Charlie, don't get yourself all worked up.
SUPFEMALE:You know, by going out there, you two are giving aid and comfort to the enemy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, the, uh, kremlin called us this morning, and they specifically asked us to be there on time, so if you don't mind Wait, aren't you two ever gonna learn? Uh, we're not the ones who are escalating the arms race.
LEADMALE:It's the Soviets.
SUPFEMALE:We're just trying to keep up.
SUPMALE:What it all boils down to, Charlie, is that the innocent people of the world are being held hostage by the political disputes between the superpowers.
LEADMALE:Well, it's always been that way, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, but we haven't always had weapons capable of wiping out civilization in one fell swoop.
LEADMALE:Charlie, one of these governments has got to be the first to start acting rationally.
SUPMALE:Well, it's not gonna be us.
SUPMALE:Now, listen, Charlie Steven, dad, dad, look, look, this this is Thanksgiving day.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not argue.
LEADMALE:Look, Steven and I will be gone for a couple of hours.
LEADMALE:Then we'll be back, and we'll have a nice meal together.
SUPMALE:This is a happy occasion, right? You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Ahh.
LEADFEMALE:That's more like it.
LEADMALE:You two want to go off and demonstrate, I guess that's your business.
LEADFEMALE:Kate, we'll see you later.
LEADFEMALE:Kids, I want some of that cranberry sauce.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, do you want to take any of grandma's biscuits with you? No, thank you.
LEADMALE:We've already got some sandwiches.
LEADFEMALE:Not to eat To play frisbee with.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the score of the football game, grandpa? He fell asleep a few minutes ago.
LEADMALE:So what's the score of the game? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:As soon as he dozed off, I switched the channel.
LEADFEMALE:A soap opera? How can you watch that junk? It's demented.
LEADFEMALE:It's depraved.
LEADMALE:Who's she? That's belinda.
LEADMALE:Is that guy her husband? Which guy? The guy in the strapless gown.
SUPMALE:No, that's the plumber.
LEADFEMALE:Her husband hasn't been around since he lost his job.
SUPMALE:He had a nervous breakdown, moved to union city, and now he gives sewing lessons.
SUPMALE:Everything's under control in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:I'm keeping grandma away from the stove.
LEADFEMALE:Good going.
LEADFEMALE:I've got her doing some busywork.
LEADMALE:You know, organizing the potholders and folding and unfolding the paper bags.
OTHERMALE:That's nice.
SUPFEMALE:Wha Alex, I'm surprised at you! How could you watch this stuff? I'm simply monitoring what you kids are watching, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I have no interest in this trash.
LEADMALE:Me neither.
SUPFEMALE:Is that plumber back again? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's him over there next to belinda.
LEADMALE:Nice gown.
SUPMALE:You know, we'd better put the game back on.
OTHERMALE:I mean, if grandpa wakes up and sees us watching this, we're gonna be in trouble.
OTHERMALE:Don't be silly.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't get in trouble with grandparents.
OTHERMALE:All you have to do is kiss them when they come in the door, tell 'em you miss 'em, let 'em buy you stuff You're okay.
SUPMALE:You're a sentimental guy, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:You know, sometimes I wonder what it would be like to have parents like them instead of mom and dad.
LEADMALE:You know, you can bet they wouldn't be out at that demonstration today.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, they wouldn't kiss in front of us all the time like a couple of adolescents.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, and mom would give up her career and all those silly women's groups.
LEADFEMALE:You're losing me fast, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I made some sandwiches to tide you over till dinner.
SUPMALE:Who wants one? Grandma, thank you.
LEADMALE:Uh, but, uh, we don't want to spoil our appetites.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't be silly.
LEADMALE:We won't be eating for hours.
LEADMALE:We know that, but your food is so, so special, we don't want to rush into it.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're just saying that.
SUPMALE:No, I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:Well, didn't take him long to conk out.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you kids watching? Oh, it's a A documentary.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that plumber back again? He just never gives up.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, did I miss anything? What's the, uh, score of the game? Uh, Charlie, can I fix you something to eat? No! Uh, I mean, uh, no, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I-I don't want to spoil my appetite.
LEADMALE:Come on, ref! That's clipping! Give me a break, here! 
LEADMALE:And here's a news update on a fast-breaking story.
LEADFEMALE:Trouble broke out this afternoon at the blackstone nuclear research laboratory That's mom and dad! Clashed with the police.
SUPMALE:Nobody knows exactly who started it, but it looks like a lot of people are gonna spend this Thanksgiving in jail.
LEADMALE:Uh, y-you're not actually gonna lock the door on us, are you? Well, I was seriously considering it.
LEADFEMALE:L-look, technically, I know we are prisoners, and you are the guard, but is this really necessary? I mean, it seems a little excessive.
LEADMALE:Humor me.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, when can we get out on bail? The judge has to set bail.
LEADFEMALE:And if he has to come in on Thanksgiving to do it, he ain't gonna be in a real generous mood.
SUPFEMALE:You mean we might have to spend the night in jail? Unless the judge goes out of town.
LEADMALE:Then you'll have to spend the weekend in jail.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for being so sensitive.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:I-I've never been arrested before.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what to do, what to say.
LEADMALE:Am I dressed all right? Perfectly.
LEADFEMALE:It's as if when you put on those clothes, you knew you'd end up in jail.
SUPFEMALE:Look, look I think we should get organized here, huh? You're right.
LEADFEMALE:We need a spokesperson.
OTHERFEMALE:Has anyone here ever been arrested before? I have.
LEADFEMALE:I have.
LEADMALE:We're together.
SUPMALE:Did you meet in jail? 
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, we were arrested in Washington, D.
OTHERFEMALE:C.
LEADFEMALE:, at the big peace rally.
OTHERMALE:I was arrested in Washington, too.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, for protesting the war? No, for armed robbery.
SUPMALE:Hey, come on now, give me a break.
LEADFEMALE:I did my time.
LEADMALE:I'm over with that now Sort of.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, "sort of"? Well, I got arrested at the demonstration today.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we all did.
LEADMALE:I got arrested for pickpocketing.
LEADMALE:Now, all all right, all right, right, look.
LEADFEMALE:No matter what our, uh, different backgrounds may be, uh, we are in this together.
LEADFEMALE:Now, um II think what's obviously on everybody's mind is, how do we get out of here? Uh, anyone have any ideas? Oh Yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I say we tie all the sheets together, hang them out the window, and go over the wall.
LEADMALE:We don't have any sheets.
LEADFEMALE:We don't have any windows.
LEADFEMALE:Other than that, it was a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, dad, are you okay?! Alex! Alex! Alex, how are you? I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Hi, dad.
LEADMALE:Hello, Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this sure brings back memories.
LEADMALE:I thought I was through bailing you guys out.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody here wants to be bailed out by you, Charlie.
LEADFEMALE:I got a party of two over here.
LEADFEMALE:How are Jennifer and Mallory? Everybody's okay, mom.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:How'd you know we were here? You were on the news.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, listen, we have good news.
SUPMALE:They're handing these out to everyone who was arrested at the demonstration.
LEADMALE:The judge drew it up.
LEADFEMALE:All you have to do is sign it and you can come home.
SUPFEMALE:"As a condition of bail, I, the undersigned, "do hereby pledge never again to take part "in any form of protest against nuclear arms.
SUPMALE:Furthermore, I will sign a public statement" That's blackmail! Uh, could you pass one of those over here, please? What do you think? I don't think we should sign it, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a principle at stake here.
LEADMALE:Hey, but wait a minute.
LEADMALE:We're not talking about a weekend in Hawaii, here.
OTHERMALE:This is jail! You're surrounded by hardened criminals, societal misfits, vermin! Uh, no offense.
LEADFEMALE:None taken.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, this is illegal.
LEADFEMALE:They're asking us to sign away a basic constitutional right The right to dissent.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, it's just a piece of paper.
LEADMALE:They can't change how you feel.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:They can change how I feel about myself.
LEADFEMALE:And if I sign this paper, I have a hunch I won't feel very good.
LEADMALE:Ah, now, look, you've got other people to think about besides yourselves.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and in case you've forgotten their names, they're Alex, Mallory, and Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I am thinking of you.
LEADMALE:I want you to know your father is a man who stands up for what he believes.
SUPMALE:Dad, I'll take your word for it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm easy.
LEADMALE:Just come home.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do you think Should we sign it or shouldn't we? Well, I think it's pretty obvious, don't you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:All right! Good! Goodbye.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm with her! Nice try.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry Alex.
LEADMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:Mom Alex, I want to come home more than anything in the world, but I won't sign this.
SUPFEMALE:Please try to understand.
LEADMALE:If you'd rather stay here, fine.
LEADMALE:Come on, Alex.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Dad, Alex Alex, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Try to understand our point here, Alex.
OTHERMALE:You know what's wrong with parents today? They still think they can change the world.
SUPFEMALE:They're back! Where's mom and dad? Why didn't you bring them home? Let me tell you two something about your parents.
LEADFEMALE:They're stubborn, they're childish They're making me old before my time.
SUPMALE:They must be okay if they had time to fight with Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:You couldn't bail them out? Of course we could bail them out.
SUPFEMALE:They wouldn't let us.
LEADFEMALE:So they're staying in jail.
LEADMALE:I don't understand this.
LEADFEMALE:Why would they choose to stay in jail? Well, they wouldn't sign the paper.
LEADFEMALE:What paper? It was nothing Just an apology, that's all.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all? Oh, and something about never demonstrating again Routine stuff.
LEADMALE:Routine stuff? Sounds more like blackmail.
LEADMALE:Grandpa, I'm surprised at you.
LEADMALE:Can't you control your own daughter? Nope.
OTHERFEMALE:Never could, either.
SUPFEMALE:Our parents can't control their daughters, either.
LEADMALE:I guess you have a lot in common.
OTHERMALE:I thought it's supposed to get easier as your kids get older.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it was supposed to get easier as your parents got older.
LEADFEMALE:Why were they out there demonstrating in the first place? Today's Thanksgiving! It's a day for tranquility, for for Harmony, for peace! Isn't that what they were demonstrating for? What about peace and Harmony in the home? Don't you think they'd rather be here with us than in jail? Then why aren't they here? Because they very firmly believe that nuclear arms are threatening the world's future.
LEADMALE:Why don't they let other people worry about that stuff? Because they care.
LEADMALE:They have to care in public? They do everything else in public.
LEADMALE:Why go to jail over something like this? Nobody is insane enough to use nuclear weapons, not when they know the enemy has them, too.
SUPFEMALE:What if the people in charge of the bomb aren't as smart as you, Alex? I still can't believe they could do this to us.
SUPMALE:I mean, how could they be so selfish? Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What are they doing to us? They're not the ones who are being selfish.
LEADFEMALE:We're here in a nice house, surrounded by people we love.
LEADFEMALE:They're in a jail cell because of something they believe in.
SUPFEMALE:I think it takes a lot of guts to do what they're doing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so do I.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll tell you something else.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish I'd had the guts to go out there and demonstrate with them today, instead of staying here and cooking.
LEADMALE:We all do, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I am going to have Thanksgiving dinner with my daughter and my son-in-law.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm having dinner with her daughter and her son-in-law, too.
SUPMALE:Anybody else? You know, this place could use some redecorating.
LEADMALE:First thing I'd do is take out those bars.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it wouldn't take much Just a few green plants.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe a throw rug right there.
LEADFEMALE:Some end tables.
LEADFEMALE:Fall in for grub! Why do I suspect we'll be disappointed with this meal? Come on, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Uh, don't we get something special for Thanksgiving? Yeah.
SUPMALE:This is it.
SUPFEMALE:Yellow water, with green stuff floating in it? You're lucky.
LEADFEMALE:Most days you don't get the green stuff.
SUPMALE:Well, have a happy, safe Thanksgiving.
SUPMALE:That man needs to get outdoors more often.
LEADMALE:Steven, do you think we did the right thing? I did until they brought us this.
LEADMALE:The kids are mad at us, and dad's mad at us.
LEADMALE:I'm not mad at you.
LEADMALE:That's quite a consolation.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody here interested in a home-cooked meal? You don't know how wonderful it is to see you guys! What a great surprise! Without you two at home, it just didn't seem like a holiday.
SUPMALE:Well, we haven't been exactly whooping it up in here, either.
LEADFEMALE:I brought you this flower for your hair, mommy.
OTHERMALE:Happy Thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:I missed you.
OTHERFEMALE:Not half as much as we missed you.
SUPMALE:Uh, where are the others? Oh, well, uh, uh, oh, um, well, it was hard to get everyone in the car, what with all the food and all.
SUPFEMALE:They didn't want to come, huh? If you're still here at Christmas, maybe Alex will drop in.
SUPMALE:Well, I've got a lot of food I cooked up here, so let's get to it.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, there's plenty for everyone if you'd like a little taste! Are you Kate? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we can't wait.
SUPMALE:I think it's so sweet that you thought to bring food down to us.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I want to give you a hug! Yeah, come on, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh Hey, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Let's do this right.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it! You two can't even control yourself in prison! Hey, you guys! Alex! Grandpa! I thought you weren't coming until the Cow jumped over the moon.
LEADMALE:Aw, that's just a figure of speech, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:It just didn't seem right, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, a family's supposed to be together for Thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know.
SUPFEMALE:We're sorry if we spoiled your Thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:No, no, I think we're the ones who should do the apologizing.
SUPMALE:There's something grandma said that made us realize this is something you both care very deeply about.
LEADFEMALE:What did she say? This is something you both feel very deeply about.
LEADMALE:You really have a way with words, grandma.
LEADMALE:I just want you to know that I respect the fact that you're standing up for your beliefs, even if I don't agree with them.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I think that goes for all of us.
OTHERMALE:Yeah yeah, a-all of us.
SUPMALE:I mean, I, uh, I might not, uh, agree with everything you have to say, but what kind of an American would I be if I didn't support your right to say it? Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:It means a lot to us.
LEADMALE:One of the happiest days of my life.
LEADMALE:Hey, that's my handkerchief.
LEADMALE:Well, come on, let's eat.
LEADFEMALE:Good idea! Mom, how did you get all that food in here? Well, let's just say, there isn't a guard in the joint who doesn't have one of my dumplings.
SUPMALE:It's a plot.
LEADFEMALE:They'll all get sick, and you can escape.
LEADFEMALE:Let's save the sweet talk for later and eat.
LEADMALE:I'm starving.
LEADMALE:Hey, do you want me to, uh, file the bars or carve the Turkey? Or I could file the bars with the Turkey.
SUPFEMALE:This is turning out to be a great Thanksgiving! Oh, we've got our health, we've got each other, we've got Turkey What else do we need? Mommy, can I say a Thanksgiving grace this year? Of course, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Thank you, god, for all the good things that you've done this year, and for keeping us well and happy.
SUPMALE:I'm really sorry about that incident with Ron dorffman's lunchbox and the turtle, but we can discuss that later.
LEADMALE:Most of all, I want to thank you for watching over mommy and daddy today and not letting them be hurt.
OTHERMALE:They're the best parents in the whole world Even if they are a couple of jailbirds.
LEADMALE:Amen.
SUPFEMALE:Amen.
LEADFEMALE:Amen.
LEADMALE:Amen.
LEADFEMALE:Amen.
LEADMALE:Well 
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPMALE:hi, Mr.
LEADMALE:adler.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello, Alex.
LEADMALE:How are you? I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I'm late.
SUPFEMALE:You're not late.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
SUPFEMALE:I'm eight minutes late.
LEADMALE:Eight minutes is not late.
LEADFEMALE:A week is late.
SUPMALE:If you put in a time clock like I suggested, you can keep track of the comings and goings of your employees.
LEADMALE:You're my only employee, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's the principle, Mr.
SUPMALE:adler.
LEADFEMALE:You should be angry at me for being late.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Where were you for eight minutes? I had a meeting of the young entrepreneurs' club.
SUPMALE:Is that what you do with your time after school? You should be in little league.
LEADMALE:I'm 17 years old, Mr.
SUPMALE:adler.
OTHERMALE:Little league only goes up to 12.
LEADFEMALE:So? You'd be the best one.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Where are the olives? What do you want olives for? Is it required that I tell you? Nah, I'm just curious.
OTHERMALE:I can't eat them myself.
SUPMALE:Heartburn.
OTHERMALE:Well, thank you for sharing that with me.
SUPMALE:So, where are they? Oh, usually I get the pains right here.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:The olives.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, if we have any, they'll be on the other side of the store somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:Olives are at the end of aisle 2, second shelf from the bottom.
SUPFEMALE:We got a few of the regular ones left, and we also have the pimiento-stuffed ones.
LEADFEMALE:$1.
SUPMALE:39 a small jar, $2.
LEADFEMALE:14 for the large.
LEADFEMALE:He's good, isn't he? So, how's business today, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:adler? Business? Why do you bring up business, Alex? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Seemed like the appropriate place.
SUPMALE:Today business stunk.
LEADMALE:It stunk yesterday, too.
OTHERMALE:In fact, business has stunk since 1957.
SUPFEMALE:It was right after that sputnik thing.
SUPFEMALE:Sputnik goes up, business goes down.
LEADFEMALE:Go figure.
LEADFEMALE:I keep telling you, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:adler, you could have a real moneymaker here.
OTHERFEMALE:You just got to be more aggressive.
LEADMALE:You know, the building next door's for lease.
LEADMALE:You could rent it out, knock out the wall in between, and double the size of your store.
LEADMALE:Alex, if I knocked down that wall, where would I hang up my coat? You got to think big, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:adler.
LEADFEMALE:You got to be more competitive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that reminds me.
LEADMALE:There's gonna be a beautiful sunset today.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to take off early to watch it.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:adler, do you ever hear a word I say? No.
SUPFEMALE:But I like the sound of your voice.
SUPMALE:All set, Mrs.
LEADMALE:crenshaw? Well, yes.
SUPMALE:Except for one thing.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean to complain, but is the milk supposed to be frozen? Alex, the cooler broke.
LEADMALE:All the milk froze.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, okay.
SUPMALE:I'll take care of it.
OTHERMALE:Watch what I do this time, Mr.
LEADMALE:adler, so you can fix it if it happens when I'm not here.
LEADMALE:Okay, first, turn the thermostat to low.
SUPMALE:Then shut this valve on the side all the way off.
LEADFEMALE:Then open it up again real quick, and then turn it once.
OTHERMALE:Wait for four seconds.
LEADMALE:Open the valve back up again.
OTHERFEMALE:Turn the thermostat back up again.
LEADMALE:And if that doesn't work Do that.
SUPMALE:I'm surprised I didn't think to do that myself.
LEADMALE:He's a good boy.
SUPMALE:Oh, he's the best.
LEADMALE:You know, he's the president of the young entrepreneurs' club.
LEADMALE:I'm not the president.
SUPMALE:I'm the vice president.
SUPFEMALE:A heartbeat away.
LEADMALE:Hello, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:How you doing, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:adler? Hello, skippy.
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:adler, is it okay if I open up this box of ice-cream sandwiches? I just want one.
SUPMALE:You can't do that, skippy.
SUPFEMALE:No one is gonna want to buy an open box of ice-cream sandwiches.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, let him have his ice cream.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Mr.
LEADMALE:adler.
SUPMALE:You're screwing up our inventory, you know.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have that on your conscience.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I happen to be your neighbor.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you could be just a little bit more polite to me.
LEADMALE:The fact that we're neighbors, skippy, is nothing more than an unfortunate geographical accident.
OTHERMALE:And I don't think I should be punished further by having to talk to you.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, how's Mallory? She's fine.
LEADFEMALE:You know, uh, she's really pretty.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, skippy.
OTHERMALE:Doe she talk about me much? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Sometimes late at night, she cries out your name.
SUPFEMALE:You mean it? Look, I'm working here, skippy.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you mind? Okay, okay.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going.
SUPMALE:Oh, Alex, they're advertising for a new stock boy down the street at the big shop-a-lot supermarket.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why don't you go and apply for it? Why should I do that? Because it's a big place and they pay more and they give promotions.
LEADMALE:And if you get it, then I could have your job here.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it, skippy.
OTHERFEMALE:I like it here.
LEADMALE:Alex I always thought you wanted to be a big success in life.
LEADMALE:Were those just idle words, or do you practice what you preach? Skippy, remember when we were little kids and I accidentally ran over you with my bicycle? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I drive a car now.
SUPMALE:Mom, I'm absolutely positive that Brad hunter wants to ask me out.
LEADMALE:How are you so sure, Mallory? Well, he came up to me today after homeroom, and he asked me if I had a nice weekend.
LEADMALE:That's it? That's it.
LEADFEMALE:I think we missed something.
LEADFEMALE:And what did you say to him? Well I told him I had a terrible, boring weekend.
SUPFEMALE:What else? You had a wonderful weekend, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, mom, but if Brad knew that, he'd think I had an active, fulfilling social life, and he wouldn't ask me out 'cause he'd think I already had plans.
LEADFEMALE:How did we overlook the obvious? Hi, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Hi, kids.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:How was work? Oh, crazy.
LEADFEMALE:We were swamped with phone calls over that installment of "madame bovary" we showed last night.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of people took offense at the bedroom scene.
SUPFEMALE:Can you believe how prudish some people are? They objected to the bedroom scene? Yep.
SUPFEMALE:That scene was so mild, dad.
LEADMALE:Well, I know.
LEADMALE:That Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What were you doing watching that? Uh I wanted to see if it was as good as the book.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, you're an hour late.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm sorry, mom.
LEADFEMALE:But it was worth it.
OTHERMALE:As of today, I have taken the first step on the path to riches.
LEADFEMALE:My foot is poised on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder.
SUPMALE:I've set the ball rolling.
LEADFEMALE:I've put the wheels in motion towards my future wealth and prosperity.
LEADMALE:My shoulder is firmly against the grindstone of economic success.
LEADMALE:Try it with a few more metaphors this time, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I stopped by that new shop-a-lot on the way home from work.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:See, skippy handelman told me that they had an opening for a new stock boy.
SUPFEMALE:So I gave them my rÃ©sumÃ©, I had a brief interview, and I think they're impressed by me.
LEADFEMALE:Remind me never to shop there.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:What about your job at adler's? Well, I'd, uh I'd have to give that up.
OTHERMALE:I thought you loved working for Mr.
SUPFEMALE:adler.
LEADMALE:Well, I do.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:adler's a great guy.
OTHERFEMALE:But I'm stagnating there.
LEADFEMALE:Let's face it, dad.
LEADFEMALE:My work at adler's is done.
SUPFEMALE:It's time for me to move on.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you The lone ranger? Wait a minute, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Shouldn't you give this a little more thought? I mean, to just leave like that after the way Mr.
SUPFEMALE:adler's treated you? Well, don't worry, mom.
SUPMALE:I've thought it through.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:adler will understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not being impetuous.
OTHERFEMALE:What's "impetuous"? It's when you do something without thinking it through.
LEADMALE:Like when you decided to have Alex? The opening is for a junior-stock-boy trainee.
SUPMALE:It's in the pet supplies department.
LEADMALE:I would be in charge of cat toys.
LEADMALE:Cat toys.
SUPMALE:See, you're in over your head, Alex.
LEADMALE:You mean your entire job would revolve around cat toys? Mom, you make it sound so unimportant.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize how many different kinds of cat toys there are? There are the little plastic balls with the bells inside and the little furry birds and the chew toys that remove tartar and plaque from the teeth.
SUPMALE:I could go on forever.
OTHERMALE:Please don't.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, there's just a lot of factors involved here, a lot of things to consider.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, he is.
SUPMALE:Who's calling? Alex, it's for you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a Bobby Cahill from the shop-a-lot.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Cahill.
LEADMALE:Yeah, okay.
SUPMALE:Bobby.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow.
OTHERFEMALE:That's great.
OTHERFEMALE:That's very flattering.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot.
SUPMALE:Well, I got the job.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:And Bobby says it's conceivable that within a year, I could be assistant manager of pet supplies.
LEADMALE:Dare to dream, Alex.
SUPFEMALE: Okay, Mr.
LEADMALE:adler.
SUPMALE:Try and remember this time, okay? Thermostat, valve, wait Valve.
LEADFEMALE:Kick.
SUPMALE:Got it? Maybe it would help if you set it to music.
LEADMALE:thermostat, valve, wait, valve, kick I give up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You want a nectarine? Uh, no, thanks.
LEADMALE:Listen, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:adler, I have something I have to tell you.
LEADMALE:You're sure you don't want a nectarine? They're in season now.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'm sure.
LEADMALE:Listen Well, take a plum, then.
LEADMALE:No, I don't want any produce, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't the rain remarkable, Alex? What do you mean? Well, it's the completion of a cycle.
SUPFEMALE:Everything is in motion, and yet all things return to their original source.
LEADFEMALE:Very poetic.
LEADFEMALE:It's also wet.
OTHERFEMALE:That's true.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:adler.
OTHERFEMALE:What is it? There was an opening for a stock boy at shop-a-lot supermarket.
LEADMALE:I took the job.
OTHERFEMALE:I start next week.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think you can handle both jobs? No, I don't.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you burden yourself, Alex? Did this come out of that entrepreneurs' club stuff? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:adler, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:See, I'm not gonna be working here anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:You're going to work there instead of working here? Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna leave you shorthanded.
LEADFEMALE:I've been breaking in skippy handelman.
OTHERMALE:He's gonna take over for me.
LEADMALE:Alex, if you need more money, I could probably No, no, it's not the money, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:adler.
LEADMALE:I mean, sure, they pay a little bit more, but that's not why I took the job.
LEADFEMALE:Then why? Because it's a great opportunity.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be in charge of the entire cat-toy operation.
SUPFEMALE:They make toys for cats? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Why do cats need toys? They're pets.
LEADMALE:They're not under any pressure.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:adler, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:See, this shop-a-lot is a terrific place.
LEADMALE:It's virtually on the cutting edge of creative supermarketing.
LEADFEMALE:They got 21 aisles.
LEADFEMALE:They're open 24 hours.
SUPMALE:They've got camping, sporting goods, shoe trees.
OTHERFEMALE:They've even got an automatic sprinkler system for the vegetables.
LEADFEMALE:If I was a younger man I'd take the job myself.
SUPMALE:You're not upset with me, are you? It's nothing personal.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll see you.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
OTHERFEMALE:And, uh, thanks for everything.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Alex, if cat toys mean so much to you, we could sell them here.
LEADFEMALE:I took the job, Mr.
OTHERMALE:adler.
LEADMALE:I see.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, just a minute, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want you to catch a cold.
LEADMALE:Well, mom, I was right.
LEADMALE:About what? About Brad hunter.
LEADFEMALE:He asked me out today for Friday night.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADMALE:You know, to be honest, I thought you should have been more straightforward with him, but I guess you knew what you were doing.
LEADFEMALE:So, where is he taking you Friday night? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I told him I was busy.
LEADFEMALE:You're not busy Friday night.
LEADFEMALE:Of course not, mom.
LEADFEMALE:But I can't let Brad think I was just waiting for him to ask me out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just deal honestly with Brad and let fate take its course? There's no talking to you sometimes, dad.
LEADMALE:Alex, put away your homework at the dinner table.
SUPMALE:I got an oral report for history class tomorrow, dad.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care if you're testifying before a congressional committee.
LEADMALE:Study after dinner.
SUPFEMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:I've got to go to the shop-a-lot tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting picked up in a few minutes.
OTHERMALE:Now, just a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:You've worked every afternoon and evening for the past two weeks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know, mom, but this isn't work.
LEADMALE:Well, not technically.
SUPFEMALE:It's a special evening training program for the new stock boys.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight we have a meeting on the creative monitoring of canned-goods inventory.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you don't want to miss that, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I can't miss it.
SUPMALE:I got to attend all the evening meetings to be eligible for my first promotion.
SUPMALE:Ah, it's probably skippy.
LEADFEMALE:He's having some problems at Mr.
LEADMALE:adler's.
LEADFEMALE:He wants to talk to me.
LEADMALE:Alex, this time you really got to help me out.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:and Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Hi, skippy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Hello, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Those are lovely sneakers you're wearing.
LEADMALE:They sure do flatter your feet.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, try to keep your hormones under control for about five minutes, okay? I'm doing the best I can, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:She's really pretty.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:What do you need to know? I got to get going in a few minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, uh, first of all, we're all out of disposable diapers.
OTHERMALE:I looked all over.
LEADMALE:I couldn't find them.
OTHERMALE:Look again.
LEADFEMALE:They're in the storeroom behind the cling peaches in heavy syrup.
SUPMALE:Don't toy with me, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:They're not there! They're in the storeroom, skippy.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Not the storeroom.
LEADMALE:Don't make me go in there, Alex.
LEADMALE:The place is a jungle.
OTHERMALE:I can't find anything in there.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I can't handle this job.
LEADMALE:Get a grip on yourself, skippy.
SUPMALE:Look, I'll draw you a map of the storeroom, and I'll show you where everything is, all right? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Maps are good.
LEADMALE:Just draw neat.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, mom, I'm sure Brad will ask me out again.
OTHERMALE:Next time he does, I'll just say yes.
LEADFEMALE:But now you don't have a date for Friday night.
OTHERMALE:So I don't have a date for this Friday.
SUPFEMALE:It's not the end of the world.
SUPMALE:I'll find something to do, no matter how stupid.
LEADMALE:I'm free on Friday night.
LEADFEMALE:Not that stupid.
SUPMALE:I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Bobby.
SUPMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:How you doing, 28? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Bobby, these are my sisters.
SUPMALE:These are my parents.
OTHERMALE:Uh, this is skippy handelman.
SUPFEMALE:How does skippy fit in? He doesn't.
SUPMALE:Everybody, this is Bobby Cahill.
LEADMALE:He's the senior stock boy in charge of my training.
LEADMALE:Bobby, nice to meet you.
SUPMALE:So, uh, well, how's he working out down there? Are you kidding? Number 28 here is really coming along.
OTHERMALE:We have high hopes for him down at the market.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm junior stock boy number 28 down at the store.
LEADFEMALE:You must be very proud of him.
LEADMALE:Yes, I am.
LEADFEMALE:And I know that my wife here, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:28, feels the same way.
LEADMALE:Well, you should.
LEADMALE:He's got a real knack for cat toys.
LEADMALE:Really really taken the place by storm.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, the cat toys are calling.
LEADMALE:See you later.
SUPFEMALE:Nice meeting you.
LEADMALE:Pleasure, Bobby.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, Mallory, can I wash your dishes for you? You can wash mine.
LEADMALE:Wouldn't you be more comfortable in your own bed? Oh, hi, mom.
OTHERMALE:I was just studying.
LEADMALE:Interesting method.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I guess I'm pretty tired.
SUPMALE:Why don't you go upstairs and go to sleep? Can't.
OTHERMALE:Got to prepare this oral report for history class tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I just got back from the store.
SUPFEMALE:How was work? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Did you know that ongoing computerized inventory control is 71% more efficient than weekly checks? I've always suspected it.
LEADMALE:You want some warm milk? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:How are you enjoying it Your new job? Well, it's fine, I guess.
LEADMALE:Most of the people seem pretty nice.
LEADMALE:Except for 17 and 24 They're a little standoffish.
SUPFEMALE:Higher numbers are usually easier to get along with.
SUPMALE:The truth is I don't talk to anybody when I'm working.
LEADMALE:But they look like nice people.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, I'm going on the assumption that they're nice.
LEADFEMALE:That's strange.
LEADMALE:What? The milk from adler's is frozen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I told skippy about that.
SUPFEMALE:The cooler breaks down, and the milk freezes.
LEADFEMALE:Remind me to yell at him tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Alex, you are so tense.
LEADMALE:I'm not tense.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, mom, I told you.
SUPMALE:I have to work these hours at shop-a-lot.
OTHERFEMALE:If I don't, I'm gonna stay junior stock boy number 28 forever.
LEADMALE:No advancement, no promotions.
LEADFEMALE:But is it worth it, making yourself miserable? Of course it's worth it.
SUPMALE:Every time I take a package of furry mice out of the carton or or stamp the price on a box of buzzy balls or put a catnip punching bag up on the shelf, I know I'm one step closer to the executive suite.
LEADFEMALE:I guess the road to success is paved with kitty litter.
LEADMALE:Don't misunderstand what I'm gonna say, Alex.
LEADMALE:I mean, I don't want to tell you how to live your life or what kind of person you should be.
LEADMALE:Just just think of this as food for thought.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I shouldn't say it.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Say what? Your father and I have made specific career choices over the years.
LEADFEMALE:Your dad could be managing a network affiliate station instead of a pbs station and earning a lot more money.
LEADFEMALE:I could be working at a big architectural firm instead of working independently.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you understand why we made the choices that we've made? No, but it's your life.
LEADMALE:Okay, let's say that all your hard work pays off and you get your promotion and you're made assistant manager of cat supplies.
OTHERMALE:What then? Well, then I work towards becoming manager of pet supplies.
LEADFEMALE:But where does it end, Alex? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Chairman of the cat toys? I guess what I'm trying to say is this.
LEADFEMALE:Do you ever envision yourself reaching a point where you're intrinsically satisfied with the work that you're doing? Where you're no longer working to get ahead but simply because you enjoy it? I don't know, mom.
OTHERMALE:I just can't make that a priority right now.
SUPMALE:I mean, if I wanted to be enjoying what I was doing, I might as well still be working at Mr.
SUPFEMALE:adler's.
LEADFEMALE:That didn't come out right.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mr.
SUPMALE:adler.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex? How are you? I'm fine.
LEADMALE:How are you? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen, I accidentally wore my apron home the last time I worked.
LEADMALE:My mom washed it.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, there it is.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought I'd bring it by in case you might need it.
LEADFEMALE:I realize you have two other ones, but, um, one of them has a big stain in the front, and the other one's missing the "g" in "grocery.
OTHERMALE:" It just says "adler's rocery.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, good, good.
LEADMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we wouldn't want to throw people off.
LEADFEMALE:This definitely is the best apron out of the three.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:So, how's your new job, Alex? Oh, it's great.
SUPFEMALE:It's, uh, really great.
SUPMALE:I like it a lot.
OTHERMALE:I'm glad to hear that.
LEADFEMALE:So, anyway, I brought that apron back for you.
LEADFEMALE:My best one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd better get going.
LEADFEMALE:Take care of yourself, Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you too.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Do you carry any non-dairy creamer? Non-dairy creamer? Yeah.
LEADMALE:All your milk is frozen.
LEADMALE:Well, do you have any, huh? About the non-dairy creamer.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:adler, you know what I do all day at the shop-a-lot? I unload boxes of cat toys.
SUPMALE:And then after I unload them, I stamp the prices on them.
LEADMALE:And then after I stamp the prices on them, I put them on the shelf.
SUPMALE:I hate cat toys.
LEADFEMALE:So don't play with them.
LEADFEMALE:And it's not just the cat toys, either.
SUPMALE:I hate working in a place where I'm known only as 28, and nobody talks to anybody else, and where the human factor is filtered out of almost every aspect of the business.
LEADFEMALE:They call you 28? Even cats have names.
LEADFEMALE:I don't suppose you'd consider giving me my old job back, would you? Give him his old job back, please.
LEADMALE:I got to get home.
LEADFEMALE:What about skippy? I think this job has skippy on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
LEADMALE:You know, Alex, this place is no shop-a-lot.
LEADFEMALE:You're not kidding.
SUPFEMALE:I can't shop at all.
OTHERFEMALE:You weren't happy here before.
LEADMALE:What makes you think you're gonna be happy here now? No, see, I was happy here.
SUPMALE:I just didn't know it.
OTHERMALE:I guess I just got carried away.
OTHERFEMALE:When they opened those big, automatic doors for me over there, well, I guess, for one brief, shining moment it was shop-a-lot.
OTHERMALE:I missed you, Alex.
LEADMALE:Skippy's okay, but we're running out of ice cream.
SUPMALE:So, when can you start? Don't hug, okay? I'm a sensitive man.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like not to get emotionally involved here.
LEADMALE:That's $4.
OTHERMALE:64.
SUPMALE:I want you two to know I'm canceling my other errands.
LEADFEMALE:They'd be anticlimactic.
LEADMALE:You know, I think I'm going to close up a few minutes early and watch the sunset.
LEADMALE:Are you interested? The sunset? Do you realize how much work I have to do? I'll bet skippy set this place back 30 years.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Business was good 30 years ago.
LEADMALE:I'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
SUPFEMALE:I am gonna watch the sunset.
LEADMALE:Are you coming? Yeah, I'm coming.
LEADMALE:Will you at least consider getting a new cooler? Don't start.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Well, that was a waste of two hours.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe that your mother and I are the only ones who enjoyed "a hard day's night.
LEADMALE:" No, now, I think there were some other old people in the audience who enjoyed it, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I hear Beatles are big in nursing homes.
LEADMALE:Next time, let me pick the movie, okay? Uh, no, we let you pick the movie last time, and it was terrible.
LEADMALE:I can't help it At least that movie was quiet.
OTHERFEMALE:You could sleep.
LEADMALE:These guys kept breaking into song every five minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse, I'm crushed.
LEADMALE:How did we raise three children who don't care that Eleanor rigby keeps her face in a jar by the door? The same way our parents raised kids who don't care how Stella looked by starlight.
SUPMALE:I can't believe you guys used to listen to that music.
LEADMALE:It was so boring.
LEADMALE:They didn't even break any guitars.
LEADMALE:Hey, is that how you judge music today By how many guitars get broken? No, that's how you know when the song is over.
OTHERMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Steven! Come in here quickly! - Honey, what? - What's going on? My god.
LEADFEMALE:We've been robbed.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it! People we don't even know came in here.
LEADFEMALE:They tracked mud all over the floor.
SUPFEMALE:They took things that belong to us! Why would they do that? They're burglars, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:That's their job.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna check my room.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:Steven, check the dining room.
LEADFEMALE:See if the silverware's still there.
SUPFEMALE:It's in the top drawer of the breakfront.
LEADMALE:Wow, wait until my class hears about this during show-and-tell.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Would you mind me tying you to this chair for a picture? The kids at school are hard to impress.
LEADMALE:I think the silver's gone, Elyse.
LEADMALE:It's not in the breakfront? Hard to tell.
SUPMALE:They took the breakfront.
OTHERFEMALE:They cleaned me out.
LEADFEMALE:T-they took everything.
LEADFEMALE:They took my calculator collection.
LEADFEMALE:They took my golf clubs.
LEADFEMALE:At least they didn't touch my mantovani albums.
LEADFEMALE:That's a relief.
LEADMALE:But they really made a mess up there.
LEADFEMALE:They went through everything, even the linen closet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great! Now the entire underworld knows that my sheets and pillowcases don't match.
LEADFEMALE:It's gone! I can't believe it! They took my most prized possession! So we'll get you another mirror.
SUPFEMALE:No, they took my diary! I'm freaking out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna have to leave town.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, Mallory.
LEADMALE:I had it xeroxed last week.
LEADFEMALE:You xeroxed my diary? Yeah, and I have a lot of questions.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna kill you! I'm calling the police.
SUPFEMALE:Ma, it's just a figure of speech.
OTHERMALE:Now, everybody, stay calm.
LEADMALE:The important thing is that nobody was hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing else matters.
LEADFEMALE:That's easy for you to say.
LEADMALE:You didn't read her diary.
LEADFEMALE:I bet we've been together for a million years and I'll bet we'll be together for a million more oh, it's like I started breathing on the night we kissed when I can't remember what I ever did before what would we do, baby without us? what would we do, baby without us? and there ain't no nothin' we can't love each other through ooh what would we do, baby without us? sha-la-la-la ah! Oh.
SUPMALE:I'm all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm all right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm all right.
OTHERMALE:I think the broom's dead, though.
LEADMALE:Just relax, dad, okay? I'll check the living room.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! It's all clear.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody there.
OTHERMALE:Did you look upstairs? - Upstairs? Yeah, you know, where we keep the bedrooms.
LEADFEMALE:Um, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I-i didn't make it up there.
LEADFEMALE:Coward.
SUPFEMALE:Look who's talking The brave soul who offered me $5 to check behind the shower curtain last night.
SUPMALE:I did not.
SUPMALE:I offered you $3.
SUPFEMALE:You said you'd do it for $5.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, if you're scared, come to me or daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't charge.
LEADMALE:I would have, but you were downstairs frisking the paperboy.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't frisking him.
LEADFEMALE:I was checking his I.
LEADFEMALE:D.
LEADFEMALE:He's new on the route.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look This is going to have to stop.
SUPMALE:I will not have my family afraid in our own home.
LEADMALE:Can we go to a motel? No.
SUPFEMALE:I-i think it's time for a family meeting about this.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Not another family meeting.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Look, can't we just talk about this without having a formal meeting? Just because you two want to keep up this charade of a '60s participatory democracy, why do we have to be subjected to it? - Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Because we say so.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Assigned seats? - Assigned seats.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:This meeting will now come to order.
LEADMALE:Uh, w-we'll dispense with the minutes.
LEADMALE:Any old business? At the last meeting, we decided to boycott the following products Persian rugs, whale blubber Hey, can't we just skip the old business and get on to the problem at hand? It's highly irregular.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, look.
LEADMALE:I know the burglary's been hard on everyone, but we've got to put it past us.
LEADFEMALE:We can't let fear take over and destroy our lives.
LEADMALE:Does that mean I have to stop sleeping with my light on? No, no, you keep your light on as long as you need to if it makes you feel more comfortable.
SUPFEMALE:Can Alex keep his on, too? Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:You told me to ask.
LEADMALE:I explained that to you.
LEADMALE:I-I need the light to read by.
SUPFEMALE:You read by a Donald duck nightlight? Ah! All all All I'm saying All I'm saying is, we're going to take some steps to try and help us feel safe again.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I think we should keep the house locked at all times.
SUPFEMALE:And don't let any strangers in.
OTHERMALE:And if you see anybody acting suspicious, call the police.
LEADFEMALE:We want to know where you are and who you're with at all times.
SUPFEMALE:A-at all times? All times.
LEADFEMALE:Well, as a member of this Democratic household, I move we hold a vote on the last issue.
SUPFEMALE:Motion denied.
OTHERMALE:Do you remember last winter when we all came down with the colds at the same time? Yeah, dad tried to ration tissues to save trees.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, I think getting robbed is a lot like having a cold.
LEADMALE:You don't get over it all at once.
LEADMALE:It takes a while.
SUPMALE:Well, we've all been through this together.
LEADMALE:I-I think that we can help each other out.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, ever since the robbery, I can't help feeling real weird.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:That's because you are real weird.
LEADFEMALE:No, now, every time I go into my bedroom, I feel like there's a stranger watching me.
LEADFEMALE:That's probably Marty obeck across the street.
LEADMALE:Look, Alex, just because - All right, look.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're on edge, but let's try and stick together here.
LEADMALE:What do you think about organizing a neighborhood-watch meeting, Elyse? Boy, dad, you'll do anything to hold a meeting.
SUPMALE:The police said they would send someone to speak if we did.
SUPMALE:I think it's a real good idea.
LEADMALE:Should we hold it here? Or maybe we should call Phyllis and have it over Chrissy's parents had a neighborhood-watch meeting, and every house on the block got robbed that night except theirs.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have it here.
LEADMALE:Just remember, nothing's foolproof.
LEADFEMALE:If burglars want to get in badly enough, they will.
SUPFEMALE:The most you can do is make it hard for them.
LEADMALE:And then maybe they'll go down the block instead, to your neighbor's house.
SUPMALE:Officer.
LEADFEMALE:Officer.
LEADMALE:Now that you've lost control of this meeting, do you mind if I say something? I have a feeling you're going to.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:My name is Earl quigley.
LEADFEMALE:I sell insurance.
LEADFEMALE:This should be real subtle and sensitive.
OTHERFEMALE:If anybody knows how vulnerable a house can be, it's yours truly.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, there isn't an alarm system on this earth that can't be suckered.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want statistics? I got statistics.
SUPFEMALE:Pick a crime, any crime.
LEADMALE:Okay, um, assault and battery.
LEADFEMALE:One of my favorites.
SUPMALE:Up 20% in this neighborhood over the last year.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you folks.
LEADMALE:We live in a jungle.
OTHERMALE:At this very moment, there's a crime being committed somewhere in this neighborhood within a five-mile radius.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't happen to know where, would you? Let's face it The only way to really protect ourselves is to get a G-u-n.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, I wouldn't recommend that for most people.
SUPFEMALE:Accidents happen.
OTHERMALE:If you've got a gun, you'd better be careful.
OTHERFEMALE:I am.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I got to be moving on.
LEADFEMALE:I hope I haven't made you people any more frightened than you already were.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we appreciate your honesty.
LEADMALE:Burglars are a peculiar breed.
OTHERMALE:They're not usually satisfied to hit one house on the block and then move on.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:They'll keep coming back again and again, picking on a neighborhood Pick, pick, pick Till there's nothing left to pick on Leeches sapping our strength, our blood.
SUPMALE:Did I say the wrong thing? Which time? Let's remember to keep him out of the locker room at halftime.
SUPMALE:Can I help you clean up here a little bit, Elyse? Thanks, Phyllis.
LEADMALE:I think I'll just leave it all out for the burglars.
LEADMALE:Well, I can't say this meeting did a whole lot for my sense of security.
LEADMALE:You want security, Keaton? Get yourself a g-u-n.
SUPFEMALE:You don't understand.
OTHERMALE:We don't believe in guns.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's fine and dandy until you come up against somebody who does.
LEADFEMALE:I got to be going.
OTHERMALE:Oh, do you have to? Is that the lock you're going with, Keaton? Why can't he understand that we can't have a gun in the house? We've got three children.
SUPMALE:I've got four, and I've got a gun.
SUPFEMALE:You, Phyllis? Yes, me.
SUPMALE:Hey, you'd be surprised how many people like you and me have guns these days.
SUPMALE:I'd think about it if I were you.
SUPMALE:I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Steven.
LEADMALE:Uh, g-good night, Phyllis.
SUPFEMALE:Geez.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Phyllis Evans has got a gun.
LEADFEMALE:What is going on in this world, Steven?! Steven? Hmm? Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Look i-i didn't like the way they put it, but, uh, well, I hate to admit it, but maybe some of what Earl and Phyllis had to say made some sense.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should at least consider buying a A g-u You know.
SUPMALE:You can't even say it.
LEADFEMALE:My vocal cords can be very stubborn.
LEADFEMALE:It took them six months to say "president n-Nixon.
LEADMALE:" Us? A gun? That seems so terribly wrong.
SUPMALE:I-I know.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:I also know the world is changing and we've got to adjust to it.
SUPFEMALE:Last time you said that, you signed us up for disco lessons.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since Ever since the burglary, I can't stop myself from thinking about what might have happened if we'd been home when they broke in.
LEADMALE:I know that thought crossed my mind, too, three or four hundred times, but I-is a gun the answer? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Will you sleep down here with us? What's the matter? We're scared.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, um, they're scared.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to be supportive.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't we all sleep down here? It'll be fun Just like camping.
LEADFEMALE:Am I gonna have to go to the bathroom outside? Not this trip.
LEADMALE:You kids wait down here.
SUPFEMALE:Your mother and I will change into our pajamas and be right back.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We will be right back down.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, come on.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I think this is a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:Now, we're we're just here to look at guns, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't have to buy one.
LEADFEMALE:And if it feels like a mistake, we won't.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:There's the gun department over here.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, there's a sale on long underwear.
OTHERMALE:Maybe we should stock up for the kids.
LEADMALE:Elyse, we are quite possibly about to take a major step in our lives that involves the security, the safety, and the well-being of our family.
LEADMALE:So does underwear.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:It's 25% off.
LEADFEMALE:I'm coming.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what can I do for you folks today? W-w-w-well well, let's see.
LEADMALE:Um Oh, we, uh Uh, we need some camping items Some, uh, insect repellant, a compass, a collapsible drinking cup, a gun, a canteen, electric socks Okay, suppose we cut the song and dance.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of gun do you want? Uh Well, uh What are the different kinds? Depends.
LEADFEMALE:You just want to put a Nick in him, or do you want to blow him away? Well, uh, a Nick, I think.
SUPMALE:What do you think, honey? A Nick sounds fine.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, a Nick, then.
SUPMALE:You want that to be a small Nick, middle-sized, or the Grand Canyon? Uh, to tell you the truth, we're not all that sure that we want to buy a gun.
LEADFEMALE:You see, actually, we're pacifists.
SUPMALE:We've marched for peace seven Oh, no, eight times, if you count that rally in Paris that we thought was for peace but really it turned out to be to legalize prostitution.
LEADMALE:Our French wasn't very good at the time.
LEADMALE:When were you robbed? How did you know we were robbed? Well, that's what usually gets folks like you in here.
SUPFEMALE:Now, don't be ashamed.
LEADMALE:It's no crime to want to protect yourselves.
LEADMALE:We just never thought we'd buy a gun.
LEADMALE:Well, I think this might be your style.
SUPFEMALE:Most of the pacifists who come in here seem to like it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I-i-i never I never h-held a gun before.
LEADMALE:This is, uh, uh, going to take a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! It's you! They are intimidating, aren't they? That's what makes them so popular.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Part of me wants to, and part of me doesn't.
SUPFEMALE:Which part has the wallet? Steven, do you realize I hold in my hand the power to take a human life? What you're holding is the power to save a life.
LEADMALE:Put it down, anyway.
LEADMALE:Honey, I-if somebody broke into the house right now, we wouldn't be helpless.
LEADMALE:That's important.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know that, but it's It's like the time your father sent us that moose head for our anniversary.
LEADMALE:It's just not us.
SUPFEMALE:We're not going to hang the gun over the fireplace.
LEADMALE:We're not hanging the moose head there, either.
LEADMALE:Let's not get into that argument again.
LEADMALE:I was wrong about the moose head.
SUPFEMALE:Let it stay in Alex's room.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:All I'm saying is that we're going to put the gun in a drawer and forget about it.
SUPFEMALE:Are you with me on this? - I'm willing to try.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll keep the gun in my drawer.
LEADFEMALE:We'll keep the bullets in yours.
LEADMALE:Well, here I go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm picking up the gun now.
LEADMALE:I've got the gun, and I'm taking it to the dresser Opening the drawer, and I'm putting the gun inside Closing the drawer.
OTHERMALE:Put the bullets away for me.
LEADMALE:My god, Elyse! You could have killed me! Bullets are only dangerous when they come directly out of a gun.
OTHERMALE:Okay, now I'll tell the kids.
SUPMALE:You don't have to tiptoe, Steven.
SUPMALE:Guns don't go off by themselves.
LEADMALE:You'd make a lousy defense lawyer.
SUPMALE:Alex, Mallory, Jen - Hi, dad.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Um, we were just coming up to kiss you both good night.
SUPMALE:We haven't even had dinner yet.
LEADFEMALE:We might forget.
SUPMALE:We didn't want to take any chances.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come on in? We wanted to talk to you anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we thought something was up when you two snuck up here with that package and shut the door.
SUPMALE:Kids, what you are about to see is strictly off-limits to all of you.
SUPMALE:And if you weren't mature enough, I wouldn't let you see it at all.
LEADFEMALE:When did you start wearing colored underwear, dad? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong drawer.
LEADFEMALE:But, uh, don't touch that stuff, either.
LEADMALE:Wow, a gun! Can I take that to school for show-and-tell? Absolutely not! You're never to touch it.
SUPMALE:We only showed it to you because we don't want you to stumble upon it by accident.
LEADMALE:But we trust you enough to know that you'll leave it alone.
OTHERMALE:I don't get it.
LEADMALE:I thought you two were against guns.
LEADMALE:Come over here and sit down.
LEADFEMALE:We'll try and explain it to you.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, this isn't gonna require another family meeting, is it? No, no, no.
LEADMALE:Look, mommy and I love you very much.
SUPMALE:And we'll do whatever we have to to make sure you're safe.
LEADMALE:We'd be a lot happier if there were no such things as guns in the world, but we can't ignore them.
LEADMALE:If a gun will keep someone from hurting us, then, uh, we'll have to make that concession.
LEADFEMALE:We still believe in everything we've always believed in.
SUPFEMALE:We haven't changed.
SUPFEMALE:It's just the world has changed.
LEADFEMALE:Do you understand? Is that the biggest gun they had? Would you prefer a flamethrower and some grenades? Okay, now, look, I think we should just try and put the guns out of our minds.
LEADMALE:Hopefully, we'll never have to take it out of the drawer, so let's just forget it's there, okay? - Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:What do you say we go downstairs and eat? - Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:What are we having? Hamburgers on sesame-seed guns.
LEADFEMALE:Buns.
SUPMALE:Going hunting? Thought you were asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, you've been up four times to check the gun.
LEADMALE:I don't think it's going anywhere.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
LEADMALE:It's just making me a little nervous.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think mothballs are bad for the gun? If they are, then we'll just shoot the moths.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since the robbery, I've been a little extra cautious.
LEADMALE:It's affected us all.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't just been worrying about the gun, either.
SUPMALE:I checked the kids six times tonight.
OTHERMALE:Checked the car.
LEADFEMALE:One of the tires is low.
LEADFEMALE:The plants are holding.
LEADMALE:I'm worried about Alex, too, sleeping all the way over at Jimmy barkham's house.
OTHERMALE:The barkhams live next door.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not split hairs, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:He's not in his bed.
LEADFEMALE:Get some rest, sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:Know what I admire most about you, Elyse? My incomparable charm and beauty? Your ability to fall asleep in any situation.
OTHERFEMALE:That was my next guess.
LEADMALE:What was that? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Somebody's downstairs! Stay here.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going down.
LEADMALE:Stop where you are! - Aah! Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Get the light.
LEADFEMALE:Dad! Dad, open up.
LEADMALE:It's me, Alex, your firstborn.
SUPMALE:Alex, what are you doing here?! I live here, remember? And you're supposed to be at Jimmy's! We had a big fight over social security.
LEADMALE:He was for it.
SUPMALE:Oh! I-I-i felt I couldn't compromise my principles and stay there.
LEADFEMALE:I dropped some things in the closet.
SUPMALE:I hope I didn't wake you.
SUPFEMALE:Wake us? Yeah, Alex, you scared us to death.
LEADMALE:We thought you were a prowler.
SUPMALE:If you hadn't spoken up, I might have Challenged me to a game of tennis? Where is the gun, Steven? I-I-i went to get it.
SUPMALE:I opened the drawer.
SUPFEMALE:I even picked it up.
OTHERMALE:I just couldn't do it.
LEADMALE:I guess I was just afraid somebody would get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:I know, and I love you for it.
SUPFEMALE:Well So do I.
SUPFEMALE:Listen.
SUPFEMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:T-this whole thing has shaken me up a little bit, so, uh, if you don't mind, I-i need a drink.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I think the scotch is Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Thought I could slip that one by you.
LEADFEMALE:Is it safe to come down now? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:It's safe.
LEADFEMALE:It was just Alex.
LEADMALE:Did you shoot him, dad? - No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:There's going to be no shooting in this house.
LEADMALE:No guns.
LEADFEMALE:We're taking it back in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Right, Elyse? Right when you believed in something as long as we have, you can't change overnight.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I realized that the minute I picked up the gun.
LEADMALE:Guns have no place in our lives.
LEADMALE:We've worn out too many pairs of sneakers trying to get people to put guns down.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:I have to admit I haven't felt real comfortable since we've had it in the house.
SUPFEMALE:Guns aren't the right image for you guys, anyway.
SUPMALE:Don't you guys still believe that all you need is love? Careful, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Don't get them started.
OTHERMALE:Do you remember when we staged that anti-war sit-in on the steps of the justice department? Too late.
LEADFEMALE:They're back in the '60s.
LEADMALE:Of course I remember.
SUPFEMALE:That was a great day.
LEADMALE:We beat the national guard 6-1 in the frisbee tournament.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you're satisfied, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look on the bright side.
LEADFEMALE:At least it's not that story of how they danced naked in the rain at Woodstock.
SUPMALE:Do you remember what you said to me just before they took us all away? You said, "the day I pick up a weapon against another man" is the day I admit defeat as a human being.
LEADMALE:" I said that? I think it was you.
SUPFEMALE:Were you wearing a plaid shirt? Oh, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm teasing.
LEADFEMALE:I know it was you.
LEADMALE:But, you know, I remember thinking, when you said that, "this guy is really deep.
LEADMALE:" Okay, so maybe a gun isn't the answer for us.
LEADMALE:We'll probably still be scared for a while, but I'd rather live with that fear than to live with a gun.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:We'll just have to keep searching for the right thing for us.
SUPMALE:Would you consider land mines in the front lawn? No.
OTHERMALE:We'll have maps.
OTHERMALE:How about bodyguards? The captain of the football team looks real strong.
LEADMALE:Nice try.
SUPFEMALE:I've got it! Killer bees! 
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, I can't believe all this luggage.
OTHERFEMALE:There shouldn't be more suitcases than members of the family.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know how to break this to you, Steven, but these are Mallory's.
LEADMALE:Ours are still upstairs.
LEADMALE:Okay, ready to go.
LEADMALE:Let's hit those slopes.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, where are your skis? Skis? Why would I bring skis? It's a ski trip.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's the outdoor part, mom.
LEADMALE:Let's not forget the great indoors.
LEADMALE:Parties, boys Games, boys.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get your skis.
SUPMALE:Are you gonna ski with me this year, Alex? No way, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I tried skiing with you last year, and it didn't work out.
SUPFEMALE:I'll stay on the bunny slope with you this time.
LEADFEMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:That's what you said last year, a-and then as soon as we got up there, you dragged me off to deadman's gulch.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you always have to ski the top? Because it's there.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, this should do it! Everybody grab a bag or two, and let's go for it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Honey.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh! It's coming down pretty hard.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do you want to do? I say we all make a run for it.
LEADMALE:Ready? Okay! Come on, bundle up.
SUPMALE:Okay, let's go! Yay! Here we go! Here we come! Aaah! Maybe we could go away for the fourth of July instead.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe the storm will pass in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Meanwhile, we'll have to stay here.
SUPMALE:Stay here? For Christmas? Oh, it'll be nice.
LEADMALE:Just the family at home in front of the fire.
OTHERMALE:What are we, a hallmark card? Sounds good to me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could open up a few Christmas presents early.
SUPMALE:Now you're talking my kind of Christmas.
LEADMALE:I don't I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm against this.
SUPFEMALE:Tradition says you don't open presents till Christmas morning.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, is that big blue one for me? Keep your tiny little hands off that.
LEADMALE:That's my present to mom.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, I want you to open this one first.
LEADMALE:It's from me to you.
SUPFEMALE:Well well, really, it's for the whole family.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Another "whole family" gift? Not another trash compactor.
LEADFEMALE:A photo album.
SUPFEMALE:And unless I missed my guess, there's a brand-new camera to go along with it.
OTHERMALE:No, no camera.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, just an album, huh? No camera? Yeah, just the album.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you remember? We said we were gonna be creative this year and make gifts, instead of spending a lot of money Christmas shopping? Well, I-i know we said it.
LEADMALE:I-I just didn't know we meant it.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just open the album? Hey, peace corps pictures! I'd rather have a trash compactor.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you dig these up? Well, that's the surprise.
SUPFEMALE:See, the whole album is filled with pictures from the time that we met until the present.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, honey.
LEADMALE:That's very sweet.
LEADMALE:Oh! Hey, look, there's one of Alex as a baby.
SUPFEMALE:Why is he wearing a tie? Those are beads.
LEADFEMALE:Alex wearing beads? I want this one enlarged.
OTHERMALE:Hey, look.
SUPFEMALE:It wasn't my choice to be born in Africa.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I got to sit down.
SUPMALE:Me too.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Are you okay? Yeah, is it hot, or is it just me? Oh.
LEADMALE:It's 109.
SUPFEMALE:It's just you.
LEADMALE:Did you happen to hear the weather forecast for tomorrow? I did, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:It's gonna cool off a little tomorrow.
SUPMALE:They say the old Mercury will be dipping down to about 105.
LEADFEMALE:The humidity should be about minus 14.
LEADFEMALE:Is this at least a record-breaking drought we're living through? No, no.
SUPMALE:There was a longer one last year.
LEADMALE:In fact, this is still last year's drought.
OTHERMALE:Sorry I brought it up.
LEADMALE:I shouldn't talk about it.
SUPFEMALE:The more I talk about it, the more it bothers us.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's not bring up the drought again.
SUPFEMALE:Dry enough for you? Max.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:The drought is really starting to get to me.
LEADMALE:And it's not just me, either.
LEADFEMALE:I saw a camel buying an airline ticket.
SUPMALE:Look.
SUPMALE:Look, Max.
SUPFEMALE:It's not that bad, and don't forget, tomorrow the villagers are doing that big rain dance.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you told me.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna wash my car.
LEADMALE:Look, we can't let them go through with this rain ceremony, can we? Why not? It sounds fascinating.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:It's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Look, I want to see the end to this drought as much as the next man, but, uh, we can't have the people going off and performing some crazy ritual that perpetuates superstition and fear.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? It gives me the willies.
LEADFEMALE:There's something to be said for their way of life as it is now.
LEADFEMALE:You know, they They live in Harmony with nature.
LEADMALE:They they have a close, intimate connection to the land.
LEADFEMALE:You can't take that away.
LEADFEMALE:And and just give them a-a toaster oven and And an alarm clock in return.
SUPMALE:How 'bout we throw in some flashlights? Some of those guys get a big kick out of that stuff.
SUPMALE:Can I ask you a personal question, Max? Yeah, sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Why did you choose Africa as a place to do your peace corps service? I didn't.
SUPFEMALE:My first choice was Miami beach.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, why did you join at all? Oh, um It was Kennedy's speech, I guess.
SUPFEMALE:It really inspired me.
LEADMALE:It made me ask not what my country could do for me, but, rather, ask not what my country had done.
SUPMALE:Could do.
OTHERMALE:O-or I could do.
SUPMALE:You know what I mean.
SUPMALE:Hey, it's a tough speech to remember.
LEADMALE:Was that a "here comes the baby" scream? I'm gonna take that as a "yes.
OTHERFEMALE:" Max, can you go get Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Ellis, please? Sure.
LEADMALE:Okay, honey, hold on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm comin'.
LEADMALE:You know, I think I remember it now.
LEADMALE:It's, "ask not what your country " Max! Oh, oh! Are you feeling okay? Fine.
SUPMALE:I'm just a little nervous.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:Just relax.
LEADMALE:Uh, try to take your mind off this.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, read any good books lately? Forget books.
LEADFEMALE:What what about movies? We haven't seen a movie in 10 months, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse Do you realize what's gonna happen? We're going to have a baby.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:It doesn't feel real.
LEADFEMALE:It does from here.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse! It's raining! Come on out here! I'm busy, Steven! Oh, it's a miracle! Oh, let me have a sip of your sleeve.
OTHERMALE:We're gonna be a mother, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we're not both gonna be a mother.
LEADFEMALE:One of us will be the mother.
OTHERFEMALE:The other one will be the father.
LEADMALE:I'll be the mother, okay? Okay.
SUPMALE:And I won't be the kind of father who says, "do this.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:"Eat all your peas.
SUPFEMALE:Eat all my peas.
SUPFEMALE:" I-I think we should treat him or or her as an autonomous individual, a unique personality, a one in a million Steven! What? Please shut up.
LEADFEMALE:You look beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:So do you.
SUPMALE:What a day.
SUPFEMALE:Let's try to remember every detail.
LEADMALE:I don't think it'll be easy to forget.
SUPFEMALE:So, what happened next? I don't remember.
SUPMALE:Do you, Elyse? No.
SUPMALE:Well, of course I remember.
OTHERMALE:Dr.
SUPMALE:Ellis came, and and pretty soon Alex was born.
LEADMALE:Made a pretty big hit over there, too.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone thought he was so cute.
SUPMALE:Must have been the heat.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever happened to Max? He lives in Miami beach, runs Max's kosher African deli.
LEADFEMALE:Closed on Saturdays and Nigerian bank holidays.
LEADMALE:Boy, am I glad I was born right here in the usa.
LEADMALE:I'd hate to think I started life someplace where they'd never heard of a clearance sale.
LEADFEMALE:Ha.
SUPMALE:No, when you were born, there were other problems.
SUPMALE:There's one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Keaton, you are definitely in labor.
SUPFEMALE:Lucky for you, I majored in labor relations.
LEADFEMALE:See, that's a play on the word "labor.
SUPFEMALE:" It's a joke.
SUPMALE:Y-yeah, I know it's a joke.
SUPMALE:I didn't think it was funny.
OTHERFEMALE:I won't belabor it.
SUPMALE:That's one, too.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPMALE:Nurse, could you ask Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton to come in, please? You're in the very earliest stages of labor.
LEADMALE:I I think it's gonna be a while.
LEADFEMALE:How long do you think? Your guess is as good as mine.
LEADMALE:Yours is supposed to be better.
OTHERMALE:Is everything okay, doctor? Well, I've got this pulled muscle in my leg, but other than that, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Now I see why you two get along.
LEADFEMALE:What do you two do for laughs? Oh, I see what you do for laughs.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't I start all over? Um I'm Dr.

OTHERMALE:We're having a baby here, remember? I'm sorry, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.

OTHERMALE:You can sing anything you want tomorrow.
LEADMALE:You can record it tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Do you No.

LEADFEMALE:You're pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure of it.
SUPFEMALE:Steven has a poli-sci final in about 20 minutes.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I can skip it.
LEADMALE:You can't skip it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't leave here.
OTHERFEMALE:Steve, it's gonna be a while.
LEADFEMALE:It could be hours.

LEADFEMALE:I-I think you should go.
LEADMALE:I'd feel better if you did.
SUPMALE:I'll be fine.
SUPFEMALE:You sure? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Steve, you go take that final.

LEADFEMALE:I'll be back just as soon as I can.

OTHERMALE: * we'll be roastin' those marshmallows * oh! Ohh! S-s-Steven! Nurse! Crazy Larry! I was delivered by a guy named crazy Larry? That explains a lot.
LEADMALE:Did Dr.
LEADFEMALE:crazy hear you call for him, mommy? Yeah, and the funny thing was, he turned out to be a terrific doctor.
LEADFEMALE:How did you do on the poli-sci test, dad? Uh, not too well.
LEADFEMALE:For "name the bolshevik leaders," I put, "Mallory if it's a girl, Lenin if it's a boy.
SUPFEMALE:" I got partial credit.
LEADMALE:Boy, it's coming down worse than ever.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, great.
LEADFEMALE:Now we're gonna be stuck here together.
LEADMALE:I don't think "stuck" is the appropriate word, Alex.
SUPMALE:Okay, trapped.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, it's light flurries, that's all.
LEADMALE:We can make it.
LEADMALE:I can't even see the car from here.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:Donny Hayes is up there waiting for me.
LEADMALE:His family went last night.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, you don't want your whole family to risk their lives just so you can meet Donny Hayes, do you? No.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe Alex could drive me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can open up a few more presents if we're going to be in all night.
LEADMALE:Good idea.
LEADFEMALE: Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here.
OTHERFEMALE:Merry Christmas, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:What do we get? Oh, that's Great.
LEADMALE:It's It's a very nice Woolen All-purpose, practical gift.
OTHERMALE:It's a hat.
LEADMALE:I made it myself.
LEADFEMALE:Shhh.
LEADMALE:No kidding.
SUPMALE:That's great.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I had a hat like that.
LEADFEMALE:You do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I changed my mind.
SUPFEMALE:I love it.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I think it's beautiful, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Well, I've got something that I'd like to give now.
LEADFEMALE:It's for you, Elyse.
LEADMALE:For me? You shouldn't have.
OTHERMALE:Should I take it back? Don't you dare.
OTHERMALE:A flute! Oh, Steven! I made it myself.
LEADFEMALE:It's beautiful! Mommy, I didn't know you could play the flute.
LEADMALE:I've always wanted to learn.
SUPMALE:Aren't there supposed to be holes in this? I, uh, got a late start.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you the holes next year.
SUPMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy, here they go.
SUPFEMALE:They're not even under the mistletoe.
LEADMALE:In a couple of minutes, they're gonna be under the table.
LEADMALE:Look, maybe you'd better tell us the story of when Jennifer was born.
SUPFEMALE:Do you really want to hear it? No, but it's probably the only way to stop the kissing.
OTHERFEMALE:Woman on P.
OTHERMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE: Dr.
LEADMALE:caro, surgery please.
LEADFEMALE:Aha.
SUPMALE:T-this is interesting.
LEADMALE:"Childbirth can be described as four stages "effacement, dilation, transition, and expulsion.
LEADMALE:"These stages are accomplished by the muscular action of the uterus, called contractions.
LEADMALE:" Which stage are you in, Elyse? I'm in pain, Steven.
LEADMALE:We're only on page 114.
OTHERMALE:You shouldn't be in pain until page 156.
LEADFEMALE:Turn to page 156.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Pain Pa They have "discomfort," they don't have "pain.
LEADFEMALE:" Write it in.
LEADMALE:You know, most people don't cram for childbirth.
SUPMALE:You see, she's way ahead of schedule.
LEADMALE:The baby wasn't due until next month.
LEADMALE:In fact, we were on our way to vote when the contractions started.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I really think we should've voted first.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you mean.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's going to be a very close election, and our votes could have put mcgovern over the top.
OTHERMALE:Have you heard anything about the early returns? Well, I just came from a Nixon victory party.
SUPFEMALE:Does that give you any clue? It's a little early to tell, isn't it? Well, there's 1% of the vote in, and mcgovern's losing by a 6-1 margin.
LEADFEMALE:It's mcgovern's hometown.
SUPFEMALE:Ohh! Shouldn't we get her into the delivery room? A delivery room's bound to open up in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:We're very busy today.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Should we come back next week? Sarcasm is not called for.
LEADFEMALE:Now I need some information.
LEADMALE:Name? Oh.
LEADMALE:Jennifer if it's a girl.
OTHERFEMALE:David if it's a boy.
OTHERMALE:Not the baby's name, sir.
LEADMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Steven Keaton.
OTHERMALE:Not your name.
LEADFEMALE:The patient's name.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Believe it? Four more years with that guy? I know.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, dad, did you hear the good news? Yeah, Alex.
LEADMALE:We heard.
LEADMALE:We're very happy for you.
LEADMALE:Guess all my hard work paid off.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I think that last-minute mailing you sent out had some effect.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, if those are your children, they must wait in the waiting room.

SUPFEMALE:Why don't you go on back now? How are you feeling, mommy? Oh, just great, honey.
LEADMALE:How come when cousin Sandy's German Shepherd had puppies, she had eight, and you're only gonna have one? It's not the same as a dog having puppies.

OTHERMALE: Okay, you're doing great, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Now, during your next contraction, I want you to resist the urge to push.
SUPFEMALE:It says here that to avoid pushing, you should relax and blow out as hard as you can.
LEADMALE:That doesn't sound too tough.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you try it sometime? Oh! Good.
SUPFEMALE:Two.
LEADMALE:Slow it down.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Easy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that was perfect! I can't believe how well you're doing! You don't look so bad, yourself.

LEADMALE:But there's nothing to it.
LEADFEMALE:How about a kiss? Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Mmm.
SUPMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Ohh! Whoa, that must have been some kiss! Okay, Elyse, start pushing.
SUPFEMALE:Aah! Good, good.

OTHERFEMALE:I don't see any ponytails or anything.
SUPMALE:Push.
LEADFEMALE:Push.
LEADMALE:There you are! You have a baby Girl.
LEADMALE:Oh, all right! And then you opened your mouth and let out a big scream! And we haven't been able to shut you up since.
LEADFEMALE: It was really terrific having your daddy in the room with me, too.
SUPFEMALE:He was such a big help.
SUPMALE:So, Alex wanted Nixon.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory wanted a puppy.
LEADFEMALE:What did you want, daddy? Me? I just wanted one thing A healthy, beautiful child.
SUPMALE:And that's what I got.
OTHERFEMALE:Three times.
OTHERMALE:I'm a very lucky man.
SUPMALE:Well, hey.
LEADFEMALE:As parents go, you two aren't so bad.
SUPMALE:Thank you! Dad, here's a present from us kids.
OTHERFEMALE:We didn't exactly make it, but But we all worked hard to earn some extra cash.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, now that Ron's got inflation under control and our dollars are worth more, we thought we'd stimulate the economy by buying an expensive, American product.
LEADMALE:However, we ran, uh, a little short in the liquid-assets department.
LEADMALE:What he means is mommy put up the rest of the money.
LEADMALE:Well, that's another way of saying it.
LEADMALE:Merry Christmas, dad.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey! Oh, this is great! It's that new camera! Oh, this is really fantastic! Oh, ho, thanks everybody! It's all loaded and ready to go, too.
SUPMALE:Yeah! I am so glad it snowed so hard.
SUPFEMALE:I've I've had such a good time looking at these old photographs.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, remembering all the glory years when I was still an only child.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you still see crazy Larry? Yeah, we visit him on weekends.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this could turn out to be the best Christmas ever.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, dad.
LEADMALE:And it's a really special night.
LEADFEMALE:Christmas is a time for sharing those moments that are more precious than any material gift.
SUPMALE:It's a time which renews our spirits and makes us aware of the beauty that surrounds us and of the beauty within us.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, that's really lovely.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but it's more effective with the wings.
OTHERMALE:Wings? It's from a part in my school play.
SUPFEMALE:Remember? I was a Christmas angel.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! You played an angel? It was either that or stick a tree branch on my head and be a reindeer.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Everybody in front of the tree.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna take a Christmas portrait.
LEADMALE:Oh, good idea! Oh! I got a timer on this thing.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, get down.
LEADFEMALE:Get in place.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, everybody looks great.
OTHERFEMALE:You all set? Get down.
LEADFEMALE:All right, now, leave room for me right there.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Come on, dad.
LEADMALE:All right, I'm here.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Smile.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:What's happening? Be just a second.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Can't win! One more chance.
SUPMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, dad.
SUPFEMALE:I can get it.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:One more time.
LEADFEMALE:Let's give it a little more time okay.
SUPMALE:Okay? All right.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody say, "merry Christmas.
LEADMALE:Merry Christmas! 
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna need the car tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:I got a meeting of youth for a sane economy.
LEADMALE:Still working on that "miss a payment, go to prison" legislation? Debt happens to be a serious problem in this country, dad.
LEADMALE:It's a serious problem in this home, by the looks of this bank statement.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'm not sure about something here.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? Unless I'm mistaken, you gave $50 to the mafia last month.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh! Oh, no, that's mothers against fluorocarbons in the atmosphere.
SUPFEMALE:I think.
LEADFEMALE:You think? I'm sure, but just to be safe, if a guy named fast eddy calls, hang up.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I don't want to tell you guys how to spend your money, but I feel this whole fluorocarbon issue has been exaggerated.
SUPFEMALE:Exaggerated? Fluorocarbons are ruining our atmosphere.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:I admit air is kind of important.
SUPMALE:But we're talking about the convenience of the American consumer here.
LEADMALE:What would life be like without hairspray, without deodorant, without bug repellant? Maybe he has a point.
LEADFEMALE:If we didn't have spray paint, everyone would be forced to do graffiti by hand.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Get what? Wasn't that the doorbell? I didn't hear anything.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, I'm expecting Cindy to come over, and I have to know the minute she gets here because we're going to study and we don't want to be disturbed.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll try and resist.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, don't read while you're walking.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's nice to see someone reading a good, old-fashioned book around here.
LEADFEMALE:What have you got there "Charlotte's web," "winnie-the-pooh," "treasure island"? "Our bodies, ourselves.
OTHERMALE:" What's a book like that doing in this house? There's nothing wrong with this, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a health and sex manual for women.
LEADFEMALE:It just doesn't seem right A bunch of women writing about stuff that should only be discussed in a men's locker room.
SUPFEMALE:Lighten up, Alex.
SUPMALE:Mom, did I really look like that when I was born Red, wrinkled, and bald? Kind of.
LEADMALE:Boy, I really improved with age.
OTHERFEMALE:If I keep it up, I might be gorgeous.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing with that book? I don't see a book.
LEADFEMALE:You came in my room when I wasn't there, didn't you? You started snooping around.
LEADFEMALE:You took it off my desk.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't take that off your desk.
LEADFEMALE:I got it from your top drawer, under your diary.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, you know better than to go in your sister's desk.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:But I needed the book.
LEADFEMALE:I had a question about jogging bras.
LEADFEMALE:"Our bodies, ourselves.
LEADMALE:" Why are you reading that, mal? Oh, that? Uh, Cindy and I are studying it tonight for health class.
SUPFEMALE:But pregnancy and childbirth? Just last week, you were studying dental care.
SUPFEMALE:It's an honors class.
SUPFEMALE:We move fast.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Cindy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:We have to talk.
SUPMALE:Maybe Cindy has dental problems.
SUPFEMALE:So, what are the test results? I'm pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wow.
LEADFEMALE:Pregnant.
SUPMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:It just doesn't seem possible.
LEADFEMALE:The woman at the clinic said she wished she had a nickel every time she heard that.
SUPMALE:I don't know what to do, mal.
SUPMALE:I'm scared.
LEADMALE:Well, what did the doctor say? "You have blue cross?" I'm not sure I'm ready to be a mother.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, you have to change diapers.
LEADFEMALE:You have to pretend to be the tooth fairy and Santa claus.
SUPFEMALE:You have to teach them how to drive.
SUPMALE:You have to plan their weddings.
LEADMALE:Uh, Cindy, I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you imagine Fred Burrows as somebody's father? I mean, this is the same guy who took the "wet paint" signs off the bleachers and hid the hamster in Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:keefer's desk.
OTHERMALE:Maybe he's matured since then.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:The hamster thing was last week.
LEADMALE:I know how hard homework can be.
SUPFEMALE:Thought we could use a snack.
LEADFEMALE:No, thanks.
OTHERMALE:So, what are we having? Girl talk? More like woman talk.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're not.
OTHERMALE:Jen, this is really - Never mind.
OTHERMALE:Don't say it.
SUPMALE:I know when I'm not wanted.
SUPFEMALE:Guess you guys won't be needing these, then.
SUPFEMALE:They're not for women.
LEADMALE:They're for girls.
LEADFEMALE:So, what are you gonna tell your mother? Nothing.
LEADMALE:I've just decided I'm gonna keep a low profile for the next nine months.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
LEADMALE:Come on, I can't talk to her.
SUPMALE:You know how my mother is.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I wish she were more like your mom.
SUPMALE:Well, do you want to talk to my mom about it? Maybe.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you think she'd help? - Can't hurt to try.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay? - Okay.
SUPMALE:Uh, mom, could you come up here for a sec, please?! Could you help Cindy and me Move some furniture?! You want me to help?! No.
LEADMALE:This is Pretty heavy stuff.
LEADMALE:I just can't go home.
LEADFEMALE:If my mom finds out about this, she's gonna kill me.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERFEMALE:You can stay here if you have to.
OTHERMALE:What's going on? Oh, mom, Cindy needs to talk to you.
LEADMALE:What is it, Cindy? Well, I-i don't know how to say this.
OTHERFEMALE:She's pregnant.
LEADMALE:That says it.
SUPFEMALE:Preg oh, Cindy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:Are you sure? I'm positive, and so was the test.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Keaton, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, you must be so terrified.
LEADMALE:Can I help? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I'm so confused.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know whether to have an abortion or put the baby up for adoption or keep it.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should just dye my hair, change my name, move to Kansas, and bring it up as my kid sister.
SUPMALE:What do your parents say? Well, there's really just my mom, and I haven't told her yet.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't face her right now.
OTHERMALE:Well, you're welcome to stay here tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if I could face her tomorrow.
LEADMALE:You can stay here as long as you want.
LEADMALE:My mom and I would love to help you, right, mom? Well, we would love to help you, honey, but I don't think staying here will solve your problem.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should talk to your mother.
SUPFEMALE:Are you kidding? You don't know my mother.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, she doesn't even let me read Cosmopolitan.
LEADMALE:Yeah, she can't talk to her.
LEADMALE:You know what mothers are like.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I've heard.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, look, this problem is too big for you to tackle by yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I really think you should go home.
LEADMALE:I'd still rather stay here For eight or nine years.
OTHERMALE:Mom, she can't go home.
SUPMALE:Look, I know it's not gonna be easy, but she's got to do it.
SUPMALE:Honey, if it were you, I'd want to know about it.
OTHERMALE:But, mom Okay, okay, I'll I'll try it your way, but But, I mean, my mom's unreasonable.
OTHERMALE:I mean, she got upset when she found out the prom was co-ed.
LEADMALE:I thought I heard someone down here.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing up, Mallory? Oh, I can't sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm too worried about Cindy.
LEADFEMALE:I just came down for a little snack.
SUPFEMALE:A little snack? A Turkey sandwich, ice cream, chocolate cake.
LEADFEMALE:Some countries don't eat that much.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I overdid it.
SUPMALE:But I'm worried about Cindy.
LEADMALE:And when I'm worried, I eat.
SUPMALE:Well, of course you're worried about her.
LEADFEMALE:Cindy and her mom are going through a tough time.
LEADFEMALE:But they'll work it out.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you go upstairs and get some sleep? I'm sure you'll hear all about it from Cindy in the morning.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:It's for energy.
LEADFEMALE:It's a long walk upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this thing with Cindy.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I still think of her as a little girl who used to play with Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:She's not a little girl anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:And neither is Mallory.
LEADMALE:She's the same age as Cindy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Well, they're in the same class.
LEADFEMALE:They're in the same crowd.
SUPMALE:I'm worried about her.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Cindy and Mallory are two different people.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'm overreacting, but I don't think Mallory should be allowed out of the house until she's 35.
LEADMALE:Steven.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Kids are growing up too fast.
LEADFEMALE:Half the teenagers in America are sexually active today.
SUPMALE:I mean, what's going on with these kids today? Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Do I sound like Alex? Yes, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Look, in the '60s, when all these changes were coming about, the new honesty between men and women, a healthy, open attitude toward sex I thought they were positive.
LEADFEMALE:I still believe that.
LEADFEMALE:But now that I have a 15-year-old daughter, some of those beliefs are - Out the window? - On the ledge.
LEADMALE:But you wouldn't want things to go back to the way they were when we were kids, would you? It was terrible Boys trying to get reputations, girls trying not to get reputations.
OTHERMALE:Just who were the boys getting reputations with? At my school, it was Betsy hogan.
SUPMALE:I heard of her.
LEADMALE:Okay, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Things weren't fair back then, but at least there were guidelines.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we were ignorant and scared.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think it's a good thing that kids know more about sex today? Well, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I want Mallory to know more.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't want her to do more.
SUPFEMALE:Look, we have a great relationship with Mallory.
LEADMALE:All we have to do is keep the lines of communication open.
SUPFEMALE:I still can't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You've been gone a minute.
LEADMALE:Did you try? I didn't actually get into bed.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sometimes that can help.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just too worried about Cindy.
LEADMALE:You sure you're not just hungry? Positive.
SUPMALE:You know, I think I'll call her.
LEADMALE:Mallory, it's pretty late to call.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, I'm pretty sure they're not getting much sleep over at their house, either.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go ahead, mal? Hello, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Sullivan? Hi, this is Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I'm sorry to call you so late, but could I please talk to Cindy? What? No, I don't.
LEADMALE:Yes, of course I will.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong? Everything.
LEADMALE:Cindy and her mom got in a fight, and she ran out of the house.
LEADFEMALE:She's been gone for hours, and her mom doesn't know where she is.
SUPFEMALE:That's terrible.
SUPMALE:For Pete's sake.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it's terrible, and it's your fault.
SUPMALE:My fault? - Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Don't blame your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? She's the one that suggested Cindy go talk to her mom.
SUPMALE:We told you her mother wouldn't understand.
OTHERMALE:And if you hadn't butted in like that, we might know where Cindy is right now.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I didn't butt in.
SUPMALE:Cindy asked me to help.
LEADMALE:And I only did what I knew to be right.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you did, huh? Did you listen when we said she couldn't talk to her mother? No.
LEADMALE:Did you let her stay here? No.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll tell you one thing When I grow up and have kids, I'm not gonna act like a mother.
LEADMALE:She's got blond hair.
OTHERFEMALE:She's about 5'3".
LEADMALE:Yeah, that could be her.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I don't think she'd be wearing a mask and flippers.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, thanks anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye.
SUPMALE:Well, she's not at the library.
LEADMALE:Let's see, we've tried the ywca.
SUPMALE:We've tried the airport.
OTHERMALE:We've tried the bus depot.
LEADMALE:I guess there's nothing left but the old run-down bars and nightclubs.
SUPMALE:Well, that's where girls like Cindy wind up, don't they? Smiling their painted smiles, swaying to the sound of a honky-tonk piano while some Joe pours out his life story over a cup of cheap whiskey.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:No more late movies for you.
LEADMALE:Now, just a minute, Alex.
SUPMALE:What do you mean, "girls like Cindy"? She happens to be a very nice girl.
SUPMALE:She comes over here for a little advice and support, and now she's missing, through no fault of her own.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mallory, I know you blame me for this, but can't you see that she had to tell her mother? Well, fine.
LEADMALE:Couldn't she have told her gradually? Gradually? Yeah, like started out with something like, "mom, I met a boy.
SUPMALE:" Daddy, can I go to the movies with Chrissy? They're showing an old movie at the village.
LEADMALE:I think it's called "bye bye birdie.
LEADFEMALE:" But you went to the movies the other night.
LEADMALE:Please, daddy, I love little birdies.
LEADMALE:I don't think you should go.
LEADMALE:I just don't think that a girl should try and hide her pregnancy from her mother.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Can we not discuss this in the kitchen? I mean, sex is not something you should talk about in front of A wholesome breakfast.
SUPMALE:Alex, I find your attitude a little disturbing.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, your father and I don't want you or your sisters to feel that you can't talk honestly and openly about sex with us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:So, Jennifer, you don't want to miss that movie.
LEADMALE:Uh, you need some popcorn money? I'd rather stay here and talk openly and honestly about sex.
LEADFEMALE:Popcorn, bonbons, chocolate bars? Throw in the jujubes and I'm out the door.
OTHERFEMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't know what you're making such a big deal about.
LEADFEMALE:Sex is a biological process brought on by emotional urges.
OTHERMALE:Sex is nothing to get excited about.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, I mean, sex is nothing special.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, Alex, if it's nothing special, why do you keep hiding playboy behind your copies of businessweek? I don't I don't hide them.
LEADFEMALE:I keep them alphabetically, and businessweek comes before playboy.
LEADMALE:I can't just sit around here and worry about Cindy anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go look for her.
SUPFEMALE:You know, maybe she's at the park.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she's at the playground.
LEADMALE:Let's get our coats and go.
SUPMALE:Alex, stay here in case she calls.
SUPFEMALE:You got it.
SUPMALE:Hello, sergeant Samuels? Yeah, this is Alex p.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:You probably remember me.
SUPFEMALE:I was junior mayor for a week.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:I thought meter maids on horseback was a good idea.
LEADMALE:Well, get taller meters.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, I'm looking for a 15-year-old girl.
LEADFEMALE:That's very funny.
LEADFEMALE:She's pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Marry her? I hardly even know her.
LEADMALE:Never mind.
SUPMALE:I think I know where to find her.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Cindy.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Excuse me for a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, she's here! So, uh W-what's new? Should I boil some water? Cindy, are you okay?! Yeah, I'm okay.
LEADMALE:Still pregnant, but other than that, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:We have called all over town looking for you.
SUPMALE:Well, where have you been, anyway? I walked around the mall.
SUPFEMALE:I sat through Annie two and a half times.
LEADFEMALE:Then I ended up in the pinball arcade.
LEADMALE:Your mother's very worried, Cindy.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you should call her.
LEADMALE:Why should I call her? She'll just yell.
SUPMALE:You don't know that.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, you can't blame her for being angry and upset when you told her, but she's had time to think about it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, time to get even madder.
SUPMALE:And time to calm down, too.
OTHERMALE:Look, I think the two of you need another chance, don't you? I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:But I know I can't face her alone.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if it'll help, I mean, if it'll make it any easier, maybe you can ask her to come over here.
SUPFEMALE:Will you and Mallory be here with me? Sure.
LEADMALE:Dad and I will be here, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course, we're flexible on this point.
OTHERMALE:Cindy, does your mom drink coffee? Yeah, I guess.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe that'll make her too nervous.
SUPMALE:Does she drink tea? I think she likes herb tea.
LEADFEMALE:Do you guys have any? Are you kidding? What's her favorite herb? Better wait and ask her when she gets here.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, just sit down and relax.
SUPFEMALE:I can't! I just know the minute that she walks in here, she's gonna go, "Cindy, how could you do this to me?" Give her a chance, okay? Don't answer that! Okay, go ahead.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I'm Elyse Keaton.
SUPMALE:Lynn Sullivan.
SUPMALE:Please come in.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry we couldn't meet under better circumstances.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Cindy, I'm so glad you're all right.
LEADMALE:How could you do this to me? Cindy, we're going home.
SUPFEMALE:No, mom You said on the phone that you were gonna come over here and we were gonna talk.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit down, sit down.
LEADMALE:Make yourself comfortable.
SUPFEMALE:Um, so, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Sullivan, what's your favorite herb? Would you like some herbal tea? No, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:We won't be staying long.
LEADFEMALE:I've already said all that I have to say to my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:She's already said she was pregnant, and now it's my problem, right? Well, actually, I think it's both of yours.
SUPMALE:How long has she been going out with this boy, anyway? I-I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, why don't you ask me how long I've been going out with him? Apparently, one night too long.
SUPMALE:Do you see what I mean, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton? We're not getting anywhere here.
SUPMALE:She's not listening to me.
LEADFEMALE:Can you talk to your daughter? Well, we try.
LEADFEMALE:We have our occasional differences.
LEADFEMALE:But we talk, you know.
LEADMALE:We try to get things out in the open.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Cindy's problem is out in the open, that's for sure, but that doesn't solve anything.
SUPFEMALE:It doesn't change the fact that she's pregnant, that she's made a mess out of her life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks a lot, mom.
LEADMALE:So, what you're saying is because I've made this mistake, I've ruined everything? I have no hope, no future? My life is over? gray skies are gonna clear up put on a happy face is that the best you guys can do? Look, Jen, I don't think this is the time for show tunes.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me go out on a limb.
LEADFEMALE:You don't want me here, right? Well Well, I'm going to my room.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be down when I'm 18.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go back.
LEADMALE:Where were we? Um, my mother just said I had no future and my life was over.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe we can go back to before you were yelling at each other.
LEADMALE:We'd have to go back to when I was in 3rd grade.
LEADMALE:Oh, I wish we could.
LEADMALE:At least then, things were under control.
SUPMALE:I knew what you were doing, where you were, and who you were with.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm not a little girl anymore, mom.
LEADMALE:I have to have my own life.
LEADFEMALE:I can't deal with you hanging over my shoulder every second, trying to control everything that I do.
SUPMALE:Well, look what happens when I don't.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe I made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:But maybe if you had just a little more faith in me and stopped treating me like such a little girl, I wouldn't have been in such a big hurry to grow up.
LEADMALE:Cindy, I I just wanted to make things better for you.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about, mom? Well, when I was a kid, I made all the wrong decisions.
SUPMALE:Really? Yeah, I don't think I spent more than two nights in a row at home.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't talk to my parents.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I knew everything.
LEADFEMALE:I got into a lot of trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:My life was a mess.
LEADMALE:That's what I was trying to protect you from.
LEADMALE:I just didn't want you to go through what I went through.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm going through it now, mom.
LEADFEMALE:And I need you.
SUPMALE:I need you to listen to me, and I need you to help me.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Cindy.
LEADMALE:Let's go home.
LEADFEMALE:We've got a lot of talking to do and decisions to make.
SUPMALE:Thank you for everything.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Cindy.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think Cindy's gonna do? I don't know.
LEADMALE:At least she won't be spending any more nights playing pinball.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Mom? Yeah? I'm really sorry about the way I blew up at you last night.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:You were upset.
OTHERMALE:You had to let it out at someone, and I think I was just in the direct line of fire.
SUPMALE:That's what moms are for, right? Only sometimes.
LEADMALE:You know, this whole thing with Cindy has been so So painful and difficult.
SUPMALE:I so much don't want what happened to Cindy and her mother to happen to us.
SUPMALE:So I want you to know that you can always come to me and that I'll try to be flexible and understand your point of view.
LEADFEMALE:Can I have my own apartment? Not on your life.
OTHERMALE:And then what happens? Well, you get taller and your hips get bigger, and you suddenly become much more interested in boys.
SUPFEMALE:Anything else? Well, you can wear a halter top and have it mean something.
LEADMALE:So, that's all there is to puberty, huh? Well, I condensed the chapter a bit for you, but that's basically the way it goes.
LEADMALE:Don't you two have anything better to do than read that stuff? You know, Alex, I think you could learn a lot from this book.
LEADMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, could you show me some of your halter tops? I don't want to be caught unprepared.
LEADMALE:So, that's how that works.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:I don't mean to be rude, but do you guys mind if I use this room for a while? Oh, no, go right ahead.
LEADMALE:Well, what I mean is What I'm trying to say Want us to leave? Well, not right away.
OTHERMALE:I was hoping you could help me clean up before you left.
LEADFEMALE:Do we have to leave the grounds altogether? Can we find a room somewhere to hide? Oh, you don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:Sherry Marshall's gonna be here any minute, and I'm anxious to make a good impression on her.
SUPFEMALE:Who is Sherry Marshall? She happens to be a pi nu, the best sorority in the whole world.
SUPMALE:She's the president! Is she coming alone or with some secret service agents? Yesterday, out of all the kids in Mrs.
SUPMALE:pober's class, Sherry picked me to do her science project with her.
SUPFEMALE:I think she may ask me to pledge the sorority, so I want everything to be perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, can you give me a hand with skippy? Oh, no! Why are you bringing him in here? Is that the voice of my beloved? Is that you, Mallory?! I'm not your beloved, skippy.
LEADFEMALE:We've been through this before.
LEADMALE:I am your neighbor and ex-babysitter.
OTHERMALE:What happened?! Oh, he was going out for a pass, and he ran into the pole.
LEADMALE:I told you to run a down-and-in, skippy.
OTHERMALE:You were supposed to go to the pole and stop.
SUPFEMALE:I did I stopped when I hit the pole! Get a cold rag, honey.
SUPMALE:Come sit down, skippy.
LEADMALE:Oh, mom! Don't let him sit down! Sherry's gonna be here any minute.
SUPFEMALE:He's hurt.
SUPFEMALE:He's got to sit down.
OTHERMALE:Well, then, at least cover him up with something.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you talk nicely to skippy? Sorry, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, skip, uh It's vital that you leave now.
LEADMALE:Someone very important is on her way over to see me.
LEADFEMALE:Obviously, I don't want her to think I know you.
OTHERFEMALE:I understand.
OTHERMALE:Much better.
LEADMALE:Come on, skippy, let's take a look at that scratch.
SUPFEMALE: Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's her! Quick get him out of here! Oh, Mallory! Hurry! Hurry! Before she sees me! Hi, Sherry.
SUPMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I am really glad we're partners.
LEADMALE:It's gonna be a lot of fun, and it's a great chance for us to get to know one another.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, great.
LEADMALE:Where's Alex? Huh? Alex Keaton.
LEADMALE:Isn't he your brother? I suppose technically he is, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, I was thinking about something along the lines of ecology.
SUPMALE:Maybe a chart showing the breeding cycles Yeah.
LEADMALE:So, uh, is he here? Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:We're really not that close.
LEADFEMALE:I run into him now and again down at the market.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I hope you don't mind.
LEADFEMALE:It's time for the commerce and shipping news.
OTHERMALE:Alex, we do mind.
LEADFEMALE:We're doing a project for school here.
LEADMALE:All right, all right.
OTHERMALE:I'll listen to it upstairs.
OTHERMALE:It's a lot more exciting in stereo, anyway.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:You know what? I'll go with you.
OTHERMALE:I just love the commerce and shopping news.
OTHERFEMALE:"Shipping.
SUPMALE:" Ah.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I don't think we've met.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Sherry Marshall.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Take care of yourself.
LEADMALE:So, anyways, what do you think about the ecology thing? Or maybe you have something else in mind.
LEADMALE:Does Alex ever go out with any of your friends? No, never.
LEADFEMALE:He says he has some kind of reputation to uphold.
OTHERFEMALE:That's too bad.
SUPFEMALE:He's really cute.
LEADFEMALE:I was hoping, um, we could double-date sometime.
LEADFEMALE:Double-date? Me and you? But if Alex never goes out with your friends Uh, did I say "never"? I don't know what I was thinking.
SUPFEMALE:You know, come to think of it, there's still some openings on our sorority list.
SUPFEMALE:We're voting on them next week at our big dance.
SUPMALE:That'd be a great place for a double date.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot my globe.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, how's your project coming? It's starting to shape up.
SUPFEMALE:Ah! I've come up with a terrific idea for Mallory's science project.
LEADMALE:Isn't Mallory supposed to come up with an idea? Her idea was for dad to come up with it.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, I think she should try making a scale model of a molecule.
LEADMALE:Mallory can't even make a salad.
SUPMALE:Steven, I can see it coming You're gonna do the whole project for her.
LEADMALE:Unh-unh.
OTHERFEMALE:I learned my lesson on that relief map of south America I did for Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I had to take an incomplete on that one.
OTHERMALE:I explained that to you, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I ran out of paste.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, I still think you should have handed it in.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:dannon's pretty sharp.
LEADFEMALE:I think she would have noticed if Brazil was missing.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Jennifer, don't sit there.
LEADFEMALE:That's Alex's chair.
LEADFEMALE:Since when? Well, he prefers to sit there.
LEADMALE:I think we should let Alex have his way on that.
LEADMALE:He asks so little of us.
LEADFEMALE:Have you been under your hair dryer too long? Morning.
SUPMALE: Hey, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:Your favorite chair is ready.
SUPFEMALE:I've been holding it for you.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of cereal will you be having this morning? This kind.
LEADFEMALE:Let me get that for you.
LEADMALE:Uh, would you like some toast to go with that? No, I'm, uh I'm going in early this morning.
OTHERFEMALE:I haven't got time to wait for toast.
LEADMALE:Well, have dad's.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, dad.
SUPFEMALE:I-i didn't know you wanted that.
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:T-there was no way you could tell.
OTHERMALE:Alex, what would you say if I told you I could get you a date with one of the most popular girls in school? I'd say that I don't need your help to do that.
LEADMALE:Like who? She is a wonderful girl with a great personality.
LEADFEMALE:No, sounds bad already.
LEADMALE:Look, Mallory, this wouldn't be your friend Sherry, would it? Right.
OTHERFEMALE:No way.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Well, just the fact that you want me to go out with her is enough reason not to.
LEADMALE:That's sweet.
LEADMALE:Look, Alex, for some strange reason, Sherry Marshall thinks you're cute.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I want you to go out with her, say great things about me, and help me get into pi nu.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you sound a little desperate about the sorority.
LEADMALE:I'm not desperate, but I want to get in.
LEADMALE:Is it worth joining the sorority, though, if you have to be manipulative and deceitful to get in? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Aw, mom, you know what these things are like.
SUPMALE:The hard part is getting in.
LEADFEMALE:And then once you're in, then you can be yourself.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's my ride.
SUPFEMALE:I got to be in early today.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what do you say, Alex? She really thinks you're cute.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Mallory, I don't go out with girls who have I.
LEADFEMALE:Q.
SUPMALE:S lower than room temperature, who have contagious diseases, or who are friends of yours.
LEADFEMALE:And there's certainly some overlap in those three categories.
SUPMALE:How's your science project going, dad? Well, it's not my science project, Jennifer.
OTHERMALE:It's Mallory's.
LEADFEMALE:Having some trouble with it.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Uh, ice.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let it melt.
OTHERMALE:No It's not really ice.
LEADFEMALE:This is a perfect representation of a group of crystallized water molecules.
SUPFEMALE:Your father's very proud of it.
SUPFEMALE:He's hoping for an "a.
LEADMALE:" Alex, why won't you help me out on this? It's just one date.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all.
OTHERMALE:It's the principle, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:I am not some cheap floozy available for one-night stands with people you want to impress.
SUPMALE:Next thing, you'll be asking me to jump out of a cake.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, no.
OTHERFEMALE:We're just going in to dinner.
LEADMALE:As luck would have it, I'm free for dinner tonight! That is lucky.
LEADMALE:Forget it, skippy.
SUPMALE:She's kidding.
SUPMALE:You're welcome to stay for dinner.
LEADMALE:But call your mother.
SUPMALE:She sent me over.
SUPMALE:So, skippy, what do you think of my I mean, uh, Mallory's, uh, science project? Well, my dad I mean, mine came out better.
LEADMALE:Mallory's not finished yet.
SUPMALE:Alex, I'm not just here for dinner tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here for a victory celebration.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulate me and pay me.
SUPMALE:What are you babbling about? Well, remember that bet we made about six years ago that I would never get any grade higher than a "c" in school? Well, read this and weep.
SUPMALE:This is a hygiene test.
OTHERMALE:This doesn't count.
SUPFEMALE:Look at these questions.
SUPMALE:"When do you use soap?" How could you miss that? A test is a test, Alex! You owe me 50 bucks! I haven't got 50 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:It's dinnertime For one of you.
SUPFEMALE:Your mother said I could stay, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:She's had a high fever, skippy.
LEADMALE:She hasn't been herself.
LEADMALE:Skip.
SUPFEMALE:If I can get Mallory to let you stay for dinner, will you knock 5 bucks off? I'll take off $10.
OTHERMALE:You drive a hard bargain, skippy.
LEADMALE:You know, I could be persuaded to, uh, forget the entire $50 if you could get Mallory to Go out with me.
SUPFEMALE:I'd love to go along with you on that one, skip, but let's try and stay in the real world here.
LEADMALE:Well, it's just a chance for us to help each other out, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Dinner is on the table! Mallory, uh, can I talk to you for a second? What is it? I was thinking, Mallory Yesterday, you came to me in your hour of need to ask of me a favor.
LEADFEMALE:I think that my rejection might have been a little hasty.
LEADMALE:You mean you'll go out with Sherry? Yeah, I-i think so.
LEADFEMALE:Great! That is wonderful! Uh, there is, however, one small favor that I'd like to ask of you.
LEADFEMALE:Name it.
SUPFEMALE:Anything.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like you to go out on a date with, uh Young irwin, here.
LEADMALE:I'd rather enter a convent.
LEADMALE:I'm flattered by the competition.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Mallory, we can make this palatable.
SUPFEMALE:It doesn't have to be a long date.
SUPFEMALE:You don't even have to be civil.
SUPMALE:Do I have to talk to him? Skip? Well, a couple of words would be nice.
SUPFEMALE:Of course you'll have to talk to him.
OTHERMALE:Then it's off.
SUPMALE:Conversation's overrated, skippy.
LEADMALE:The important thing is you'll be together.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, forget the talking.
LEADFEMALE:I'm flexible on that one.
LEADMALE:Do I have to go out in public with him? That's up to Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I'm afraid so.
LEADFEMALE:See, we'll double-date.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go together to the pi nu dance.
LEADMALE:I'm not dancing with him.
LEADMALE:There's not gonna be any dancing, skippy.
SUPFEMALE:There's got to be dancing.
LEADMALE:This point is non-negotiable.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think he's bluffing, Mallory.
SUPMALE:All right, one dance.
SUPFEMALE:Two dances one slow.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory? I'd almost rather die than do this.
OTHERMALE:Sounds like a "yes" to me, skip.
SUPMALE:Now, don't lay it on too thick, okay? I mean, tell Sherry how wonderful I am and all that, but don't get too gushy about it.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try and control myself.
LEADMALE:Hey, you two guys look great.
LEADMALE:Oh, you really think so? I'm so nervous.
SUPFEMALE:What's the big deal? The big deal is that my life, my reputation, my entire social status is in Alex's hands.
SUPFEMALE:Then you shouldn't be nervous.
LEADMALE:Oh? You should panic.
LEADFEMALE:Well, everybody all ready to go? 
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I guess.
OTHERFEMALE:You look terrific, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, uh, this is for you from mom and me.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you! Now, I was under the impression that you two weren't too crazy about the idea of my joining.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we're not happy about the way you're getting in, but we know it's important to you.
LEADMALE:Alex, what made you change your mind about going out with Sherry? Well, I, uh, I thought it over, and I realized that if it meant that much to Mallory, it means that much to me.
LEADMALE:Okay, you don't have to tell us if you don't want to.
LEADMALE: Skip! Skippy, what are you doing here? I told you I'd meet you there.
OTHERMALE:I know, but you didn't tell me where it was.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, m-Mallory, I don't mean to pry, but I'm kind of surprised that, uh, you and skip Well, I mean, that the two of you That we're going out on a "date"? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I had to do it.
SUPFEMALE:It's the only way I could get Alex to go out with Sherry.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, you see, uh, I'm going out with Sherry so Mallory will go out with skippy so I don't have to pay skippy the money I owe him on a stupid bet.
LEADMALE:Ah, to be young and in love.
LEADFEMALE:So, this is a great sorority.
LEADFEMALE:All girls, right? Right.
LEADMALE:Well, I think you're making a great move asking my sister to join.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she is a girl and everything.
LEADFEMALE:Alex Did anyone ever tell you that you have a really cute nose? This one? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I like the way it just sits right there, just right in the middle of your face.
LEADMALE:Well, I've tried other locations, but I've always found that this one works best.
SUPFEMALE:You're funny, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You know I find a sense of humor in a man to be incredibly Sexually exciting.
SUPFEMALE:A priest and a rabbi are in a rowboat Hi, you two.
LEADFEMALE:Having fun? We were.
LEADFEMALE:Now, don't believe everything Alex tells you.
LEADFEMALE:I do have some flaws.
LEADMALE:Here's one now.
LEADMALE:So, Alex, how you doing with your woman? Come on, skippy, I'm gonna have to dance with you sooner or later.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get it over with.
LEADFEMALE:They make a cute couple, don't you think? Now, where were we? Oh, I can't remember exactly.
OTHERMALE:Something about you finding me incredibly exciting.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Alex, I've admired you from afar for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now you can admire me from a-close.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:This is the moment we've all been waiting for.
SUPFEMALE:It's time to announce the lucky new members of pi nu! Congratulations, Karen Sheldon donna Baldwin annette marilla and Katie Brewster! Welcome to our little family.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure you didn't miss any names on that list? No, that's all.
LEADMALE:Um, my name's Mallory Keaton.
LEADMALE:Can you check one more time? I don't see your name on here anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think it was submitted.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADMALE:Come on, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go home.
OTHERMALE:Alex, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, do you mind? Alex, my name was not on the list to pledge the sorority.
LEADMALE:Oh, what are you talking about? Sherry, wasn't Mallory's name on the list? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not on the membership committee.
LEADMALE:W-well, I thought you said you were gonna Well, mal, these things happen.
SUPMALE:I mean, obviously, Sherry did all she could.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I want to go home now.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I-i know how you feel.
SUPMALE:I'll see you there.
SUPFEMALE:You're not coming with me? I have responsibilities, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I'm needed here.
LEADMALE:Mallory I'll take you home.
LEADMALE:Mallory! Hi, dad.
LEADMALE:Why are you sitting here in the dark? I was just thinking.
SUPFEMALE:What's that? Oh, this is your, uh, science project.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd work on it a little.
SUPMALE:How am I doing on it? I'll be honest, mal You're having trouble.
LEADFEMALE:At this point, it's a "b" or a b-plus, at best.
LEADMALE:Well, dad, what's important is not the grade but what you learn from it.
LEADMALE:How was the dance? It's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't even invited into the sorority.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, w-w-what happened? Do you want to talk about it? What happened is that Sherry never even put my name on the list.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she got what she wanted, then forgot all about me.
SUPMALE:Oh, mal, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:How could I be so stupid? Sherry was just using me.
SUPMALE:Look, this may be hard to face, but, uh, weren't you using her, too? That's different.
LEADFEMALE:How? It worked for her.
SUPFEMALE:Thought I heard voices.
LEADMALE:How was the party? Jennifer, your brother is a jerk.
OTHERFEMALE:I know that.
LEADMALE:How was the party? You didn't get in, did you? Nope.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
SUPMALE:Forget them, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:We don't need those stinky p.
LEADMALE:U.
LEADFEMALE:S, anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Pi nus.
SUPMALE:Same thing.
LEADMALE:How could Sherry use me like that? And Alex knew she used me, and he still stayed there with her.
SUPMALE:Well, we haven't heard Alex's side of the story.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what could he say? "I'm sorry Sherry ruined your life, but I think she's cute"? Yeah, he could say that.
LEADFEMALE:I can definitely picture Alex saying that.
SUPMALE:I never got my slow dance! The party's over, skippy! Aren't you afraid you're spoiling him? It's just skippy.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Mallory, for someone who was treated rudely tonight, you haven't learned any lessons from it.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? It's a little difficult for us to have any sympathy for the way Sherry treated you with skippy out there in the shrubbery.
LEADFEMALE:Alex! Thought I saw a light on.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, you have a lot of nerve coming back home.
SUPMALE:Mallory, just hear me out.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'll bet Alex told that Sherry off.
SUPMALE:You probably just didn't want to walk out on her.
OTHERFEMALE:You were just being polite, right, Alex? Right, Alex? Talk to me, Alex! Can I speak to Mallory alone, please? Well, you guys do have some things to work out.
OTHERMALE:Let's go on up to bed.
LEADMALE:Skippy, why don't you go into the kitchen and make yourself a few dozen sandwiches? Okay, but don't go to bed without telling me.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you're proud of yourself, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of brother are you?! Wait a minute, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go back a few steps here.
LEADFEMALE:You're the one who started this whole thing.
LEADFEMALE:You wanted me to go out with Sherry.
LEADMALE:You wanted me to like her.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you were supposed to stop liking her once I didn't get into pi nu.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I should have read my rule book on trickery and manipulation in teenage dating.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Don't play martyr with me, Alex.
LEADMALE:You used me to get out of your bet with skippy.
LEADMALE:I used you? You used me first to go out with Sherry to get you into pi nu.
LEADMALE:That's only because Sherry was using me to get to you.
SUPMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Sherry used me.
LEADFEMALE:You used me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the only one who got used twice.
OTHERMALE:And I wasn't even trying to get into anything! Well you know what I mean.
LEADMALE:Listen to us.
LEADMALE:We're arguing over which one of us was more sleazy.
LEADMALE:I think you won.
LEADFEMALE:Let's face it.
LEADMALE:This has been quite an unsavory chapter in our young lives.
SUPMALE:I guess.
SUPMALE:You know, when you think of it, the only one of us who was pure of motive and noble of heart is that young man in there.
OTHERMALE: I'm sorry! I-I'll clean that up! I don't know, Alex.
LEADMALE:It's like I had temporary insanity or something.
SUPMALE:I wanted to get into that sorority so bad that nothing else mattered.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody goes through a moment or two like that in their lives, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Where was my pride, my self-respect? They didn't want me.
LEADFEMALE:Why did I want them? They do have great sweaters.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Alex.
LEADMALE:I really owe you an apology.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's possible that my behavior has not exactly been above reproach.
LEADFEMALE:I owe you an apology, too.
LEADMALE:Accepted.
SUPFEMALE:You know, if it makes you feel any better, I told Sherry that if you weren't good enough for her, she wasn't good enough for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna be seeing her anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:That's for me.
LEADMALE:But you just said Yeah, well, that's not Sherry.
LEADFEMALE:That's Lisa.
SUPMALE:She's the sergeant at arms.
LEADFEMALE:She's not like those other girls.
SUPMALE:You'd really like her.
LEADMALE:I'll bet.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you go on up and go to bed? I will.
SUPFEMALE:I got something to take care of first, though.
OTHERFEMALE:What? I owe somebody something.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you come in here, please? Irwin, they're playing our song.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:chips.
OTHERFEMALE:" Isn't there anything more interesting on? A test pattern, maybe? It happens to be a quality show, Alex.
SUPMALE:Erik's really cute.
SUPMALE:Hey, mal, do you mind giving me a hand here? I'm trying to work out this hitch in my swing.
SUPFEMALE:I hate baseball.
LEADMALE:It's noisy, it's crowded, and everybody wears those tacky double knits.
SUPMALE:Oh, Jennifer, you should know better than to practice baseball in the house.
LEADMALE:Sorry, dad.
LEADMALE:Mallory, turn off the TV.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, help me clean up here.
OTHERMALE:Your uncle ned's gonna be here any minute.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe he'll practice with me.
SUPFEMALE:Knowing uncle ned, I'm sure he will, but I'm counting on you to keep him under control this time.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you like it when uncle ned comes? I love it, but I just wish one time when your brother comes to town he'd give us more than two hours' notice.
LEADMALE:Uncle ned may be impulsive, but you got to remember one thing.
SUPMALE:He's the junior vice president of the syntram corporation, which happens to be the 12th largest multinational corporation in the world.
SUPFEMALE:In the fast-paced world of big business, decisions have to be made like that.
SUPFEMALE:There's no time to think.
LEADFEMALE:You'll fit right in someday, Alex.
SUPMALE:Ned! Hey! Oh-ho! Oh! 
SUPFEMALE:You're looking great.
LEADMALE:Oh, my.
LEADFEMALE:Who's the little monkey face? Hey, Alex.
OTHERMALE:she's a woman now hey, how you doing? Welcome.
SUPFEMALE:Good, good, good.
LEADMALE:It's so good to see you! Come on and sit down! Oh, it's good to see all of you guys! Oh, the bag! Here you go, ned.
SUPFEMALE:I have presents for each and every one of you.
LEADMALE:Oh, you shouldn't have.
LEADFEMALE:Starting with Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:It's a little New York City skyline inside a dome.
LEADFEMALE:Shake it up, snow's inside.
LEADMALE:Careful with that.
LEADFEMALE:It's one of a kind.
SUPFEMALE:I also have one for each of the rest of you! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Alex! Mallory! Elyse! Steven! Ohh, Steven, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You know, one day I'm gonna work inside of one of those buildings.
LEADMALE:Should be a perfect fit.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi, mom! Yeah, I'm fine.
SUPMALE:Hey, have I got a surprise for you.
SUPMALE:You will never guess who just came for a visit.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, who is it? Uh The gas man.
LEADMALE:He just came to read the meter.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he prefers reading at night.
SUPMALE:He sleeps better if he reads first.
LEADMALE:Can I call you back later, mom? Good, okay, thanks.
SUPMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you do that? No reason.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Elyse, I-I'm on vacation.
SUPMALE:I just want to relax.
SUPFEMALE:If it's all the same, I'd like to take a couple of days, get settled before I talk to mom and dad.
LEADMALE:Uh, parents can be tough to deal with sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I know what you mean.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, ned, it's great that you could get this time off, considering that you took a vacation a couple of months ago.
OTHERMALE:Uh Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Y-yeah, well, uh, this isn't a vacation, per se.
LEADMALE:It's more of a-a leave of absence.
LEADFEMALE:I was feeling a little burned out.
SUPMALE:I needed some time off, you know? You're not sick, now, are you? No.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing like that.
LEADMALE:Just a little tired.
SUPFEMALE:I was hoping I could stay here for a while, if it's okay? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that'd be terrific.
LEADMALE:Sure, make yourself at home.
LEADFEMALE:We won't bother you.
LEADMALE:You can even go take a nap if you want.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh, great.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey! What do you say we blow this couch out of here and play a couple of innings, guys? Uh Oh, you don't know how I appreciate a home-cooked meal, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I don't cook much in my apartment anymore, not since the fire.
SUPMALE:It's a mystery to me how you live in that apartment.
LEADFEMALE:It was such a mess last time we visited.
SUPMALE:Come on, Elyse, you just caught me at a bad time.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't have time to tidy up before you arrived.
SUPFEMALE:It looked like strip mining had been going on.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No strip mining.
OTHERMALE:The geological surveys we did were inconclusive.
SUPMALE:Don't make fun of me, ned.
LEADFEMALE:I-i worry about you.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:And it's so cute.
SUPMALE:You're such a big sister.
LEADFEMALE:So, ned, uh, how's work? What's going on at syntram? Come on, dad.
LEADMALE:I showed you that clipping.
LEADFEMALE:They've moved up seven notches on the fortune 500.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got a copy of the fortune 500 in your wallet? No, I wish.
LEADFEMALE:I only have the top 25 in my wallet.
SUPFEMALE:I keep the complete list under my pillow.
SUPMALE:I also have The clipping from two years ago when you were promoted to junior vice president And your speech before the world bank And your award for best young executive of 1981.
SUPMALE:You got any pictures of me in a swimsuit in there? Come on, uncle ned, there's no need for false modesty.
LEADFEMALE:We all know you're a genius.
LEADFEMALE:Your command of computer technology, your business acumen, your math abilities are well-documented.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:You're looking at a man who's memorized every number between one and 100.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? What comes after 63? Oh, come on, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Not when everybody's watching.
OTHERMALE:Hello? Allied international airlines? Wha No, I-I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You must have the wrong number.
LEADFEMALE:There's no one named stanislaw demkowski here.
LEADMALE:This is stanislaw.
LEADMALE:Nyet, nyet.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I-I do not know when I will be leaving yet.
LEADFEMALE:Can I keep my return ticket open? Oh, danke, danke.
SUPMALE:Bei mir bist du schoen.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, since I'm up, anybody need anything from the fridge? Some butter, some baking soda, some chopped chives? Ned, that call was for someone named stanislaw.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that struck me as strange, also.
LEADMALE:Ned.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, there's a very simple explanation.
SUPMALE:I booked my airline ticket through the company's computers, and I used an assumed name so they wouldn't know I was here.
SUPFEMALE:Otherwise, they'd be calling every five minutes with some problem at work.
LEADMALE:May I use your phone for a second? Quick business call? Certainly, stanislaw.
OTHERMALE:After all, you are a guest in our country.
SUPFEMALE:The falcon has landed.
OTHERFEMALE:The fat man walks alone.
LEADMALE:I repeat The falcon has landed, and the fat man walks alone.
OTHERFEMALE:So, you're sure about those chopped chives? Good morning.
LEADMALE:Good morning, uncle ned.
LEADMALE:You sleep well? Like a baby.
LEADMALE:Didn't you hear me crying? What you working on? Algebra.
OTHERMALE:Mm, what's the problem? Algebra.
OTHERMALE:Need some help? Well, I did this problem with that formula you showed me last night, and I got "x" equals 7.
SUPMALE:But the book says "x" equals 9.
LEADMALE:Compromise.
SUPMALE:Make "x" equal 8.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I want all the dirt.
OTHERMALE:Tell me everything.
LEADFEMALE:The inner workings of the corporate world.
SUPFEMALE:Bold, daring decisions made in the face of an ever-changing and uncertain world economy.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, survival of the fittest elevated to the highest levels of corporate technology.
LEADMALE:Come on, uncle ned, tell me, is that what it's like? Kind of.
LEADMALE:Really.
OTHERFEMALE:God, I love getting the inside story! Don't encourage him, uncle ned.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle ned, what is really the most exciting part of it all? I have two secretaries.
SUPMALE:You've just destroyed all his fantasies.
LEADFEMALE:Hopefully, I've created new ones.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, kids.
LEADMALE:Get a move on! Your car pool's gonna be here any minute.
LEADMALE:Uncle ned, can you give me a few pointers? We have a big game after school today, and I've been in a batting slump lately.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's because you swing at too many bad pitches, Jennifer, and I told you that last time I was here.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, come on.
OTHERMALE:Let's go outside, and I'll toss you a couple.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh, our car pool is here.
LEADMALE:See you later! That's okay, that's okay.
LEADMALE:We can get in a couple swings on the way to the car.
SUPFEMALE:Hey Alex, Mallory, shag some flies for us, would you? Okay, bye.
LEADMALE:Oh, Steve, come on out! We need a catcher! Don't say it, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even know what I was going to say.
LEADFEMALE:You were going to say that ned is childish and irresponsible.
OTHERMALE:I wasn't going to say that.
LEADFEMALE:That's a given.
LEADFEMALE:What I was going to say is, uh, I think something's going on that ned's not telling us.
SUPFEMALE:He's been so evasive about why he's in town now.
LEADMALE:I know what you mean, but that's ned.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, he told us last night he's feeling burned out, and he just wants to take a leave of absence.
LEADMALE:Well, then, what's all this stuff, uh The fat man has landed and Actually, it was the the falcon that landed.
SUPMALE:The fat man walked alone.
LEADMALE: Aw, give the kid a break, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Anderson! She's got a big game today! Well, what's a couple of minutes?! That woman should not be driving a car pool.
LEADFEMALE:She's far too irritable.
LEADMALE:Oop, I'll get that.
LEADMALE:Hello? Just a minute.
LEADMALE:I'll see.
LEADMALE:Elyse, do you have any friends named bernice? Uh, bernice Wilkins.
OTHERFEMALE:Bernice, what's your last name? Okay, she's got that right.
LEADFEMALE:How tall is she? She's about ned! What Bernice.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Who answered the phone? The gas man.
LEADMALE:Yeah, can I call you back? Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Don't ever call here again.
LEADMALE:Ned, what is going on? I just don't want the people from work to know I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Because I've been having some problems at work lately.
LEADFEMALE:Some big problems.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the truth of the matter is, I quit.
SUPFEMALE:Or if you want to get all technical about it, I was fired.
LEADMALE:Oh, ned.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, the thing is, I didn't leave on exactly the best of terms with the company brass.
LEADMALE:Uh, there may be some things they might want to say to me that I don't really want to hear, and some things they might want to do to me that I don't want to have done.
LEADMALE:What are you saying? Are you in some physical danger? Only if they catch me.
LEADMALE:Now, I-i don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are they after you? Well, I had a little disagreement with the president of the company.
OTHERFEMALE:All of this is over a little disagreement? Well, at first it was a little disagreement.
LEADFEMALE:Then I poured a cup of coffee on his head.
LEADMALE:On your boss? He said he wanted a second cup.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, look, um, why don't I just explain this from the very beginning? About two years ago, the syntram corporation bought a small company called hemsdale machine parts, and, as it turns out, syntram bought that company for only one reason.
SUPFEMALE:To make money.
LEADFEMALE:To lose money.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:I was never very good at business.
OTHERMALE:You see, once the merger went through, syntram could claim that hemsdale was an unprofitable business and shut it down, and they would use the loss as a huge tax write-off, and the whole transaction would actually make millions of dollars for the company.
LEADMALE:And I was the man in charge of making all of that happen.
SUPFEMALE:That was your big promotion, right? I remember that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Alex took the day off from school.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, uh, a couple of months ago, I visited hemsdale for the first time and saw the people we were about to put out of work All 1,800 of them And it just really got to me.
LEADFEMALE:But you must have known that they existed before that.
SUPFEMALE:Until then, they were just numbers on a computer printout, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:But when I saw them, they were real people.
SUPFEMALE:They had overalls and lunch buckets and hats, umbrellas.
SUPFEMALE:The forecast called for rain.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what happened? A light shower.
SUPMALE:Sun came out about What did you do? Oh, well I went to the president of our company, and I explained how I felt.
SUPMALE:I suggested that he call the merger off and keep hemsdale open.
LEADFEMALE:And he said to me "Ned, let's keep this in perspective.
LEADFEMALE:"Those 1,800 people have their financial concerns, and we have ours.
LEADFEMALE:" Moments later, the man had coffee in his hair.
LEADFEMALE:Pouring coffee on his head was pretty dumb, but it Do you really think they'll send someone after you? Big business can be dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:I've heard of people who have disappeared after mixing up a lunch order.
LEADFEMALE:Must be very difficult for you.
SUPMALE:I mean, after all you've worked for for the past 10 years.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I guess I had no other choice.
LEADMALE:But, um, what was all this business about the, uh, falcon and the fat man? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, that was nothing.
SUPFEMALE:I was canceling a racquetball date I had with Billy whitsett.
LEADMALE:We call him "the fat man.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm glad you told us, ned.
OTHERMALE:At least it'll This'll put an end to all this cloak-and-dagger business.
SUPFEMALE:Of course.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:"Pussycat, pussycat, w-where have you been"? Just tell 'em I've been to London to visit the Forget it.
LEADMALE: Oh, you quitter.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal? I-I mean, we had time for one more inning.
SUPMALE:It was getting dark, uncle ned.
OTHERFEMALE:So what? It was a tie game! I was getting tired.
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:You play tired.
SUPFEMALE:That's part of the game.
OTHERMALE:Their pitcher was even losing her good stuff.
SUPFEMALE:All the kids had to go home for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:What a gyp.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, champ.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, uncle ned.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, uh, my dad told me the whole thing.
LEADFEMALE:I think what you did was great.
SUPFEMALE:You do? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, y-you did what you had to do.
SUPMALE:Now they know you're not just another yes man.
SUPFEMALE:You're a freethinker, a-a rebel.
OTHERMALE:The president will probably come running back to you and offer you a big raise and a promotion.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm not going back to syntram.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're right.
SUPFEMALE:To hell with 'em.
LEADFEMALE:The other big multinationals will probably be banging down your door pretty soon.
OTHERMALE:You could just take your pick, right? No.
OTHERMALE:I'm through with the business world.
SUPMALE:Finished.
LEADFEMALE:Never again.
LEADFEMALE:The ballgame's over.
SUPMALE:You can't do that, uncle ned! You've got one of the best young business minds since Henry Ford.
LEADMALE:Since Since Howard Hughes! Since Since a lot of guys! You're part of a new breed.
LEADMALE:You're brass.
LEADFEMALE:You're sassy.
LEADFEMALE:You're now! Let's face it, you owe it to humanity to make money.
LEADMALE:Alex, there's a lot of information about this that has yet to surface.
SUPMALE:And when it does, you may not be that thrilled with me.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? Alex, I'm about to tell you something that I couldn't tell your parents.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, ned.
LEADMALE:How did Jennifer's softball game go? Well, it was a tie game, and Jennifer wanted to come home 'cause it was getting dark, and she was getting hungry and tired, and I really think you ought to have a talk with that kid, Steve.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, mom and dad, a car just pulled up in the driveway.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it's got U.
LEADFEMALE:S.
SUPFEMALE:government license plates.
LEADMALE:Are you sure? Positive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, son of a gun, Mallory, you're right! Government plates.
SUPFEMALE:Ned, do you know anything about this? Me? No, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Never seen the guy before.
LEADFEMALE:But whoever he is, he's about to ring your front doorbell.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I got to go get some ice cream.
SUPFEMALE:Ned! Yes? Is this the Keaton residence? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Great! That would make you Steven Keaton, right? Uh, right.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! Two out of two! Uh, what can I do for you? May may I come in? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:My name's Bert Carlyle.
LEADFEMALE:I'm with your local office of the federal bureau of investigation.
LEADMALE:What's going on? Don't tell me! Don't tell me! You you you You must be Elyse, right? That's right.
LEADMALE:I'm pretty good at this, aren't I? And, uh, you must be Alex and, uh, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, who's the little girl? Friend of the family? She's our daughter Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Are you sure? I'm quite certain.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:First mistake.
SUPFEMALE:Heads will roll! "Jennifer Daughter.
LEADFEMALE:" Got it.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you know so much about us? Well, I pulled your file from the computer this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Say, you know, you folks have been the talk of the office all day long.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, excuse me, dear.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, dear.
LEADMALE:Ah, here we are.
SUPFEMALE:"Steven and Elyse Keaton.
SUPMALE:Married may 1964.
SUPFEMALE:"Participated in no fewer than 15 "subversive political demonstrations "between 1966 and 1973.
SUPFEMALE:Arrested three times.
LEADMALE:" See here, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Carlyle, I don't know what you want with us, but I do know my rights.
SUPMALE:According to the privacy act of 1974, I have the right to examine the FBI's file on us.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, here.
LEADMALE:Can I have that back before I go? It's my only copy.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Carlyle, will you please tell us why you're here? Oh, right.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm sorry to bother you folks.
LEADFEMALE:We got a call from the New York office this morning.
LEADFEMALE:Now, it seems they're looking for a A ned Donnelly.
LEADFEMALE:He's my brother.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:He's, uh, your brother.
LEADFEMALE:That's correct.
LEADMALE:Anyway, we're just making a routine check of his relatives to see if they know where he is.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, has ned done something illegal? Ma'am, the FBI doesn't go looking for people unless they've done something illegal.
LEADFEMALE:It's a new policy.
LEADMALE:Well, just what did uncle ned do? Let's see, what did uncle ned do? What did uncle ned do? Uncle ned stole $4.
SUPFEMALE:5 million.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! The syntram corporation has filed charges against him for, and I quote, "embezzlement" "and tampering with corporate records and corporate funds involving interstate transactions.
LEADFEMALE:" Is that good or bad? It's bad, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:So, um, do you folks know where we might find him? Uh No, we don't.
LEADMALE:She's right.
SUPFEMALE:We haven't heard from him.
SUPFEMALE:Not in months.
SUPMALE:And we definitely didn't play baseball together today.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Carlyle, do do you really believe my brother stole that money? I mean he's not the type.
LEADMALE:I'll mention that to the guys in New York, but to be honest with you, I think they'll want to push ahead with the case, anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Can I have my file back? I got to go.
LEADFEMALE:M-Mr.
LEADMALE:Carlyle It says here that we participated in left-wing conspiracies to overthrow the government.
SUPMALE:We we never did that.
LEADMALE:Well, don't take it so literally.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a bookkeeping thing.
LEADMALE:L-let's just say, entirely for the sake of argument, that we know where ned is.
LEADMALE:We we don't, of course.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:But But let's say we do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just curious what would happen to us if, uh, we didn't tell you Hypothetically speaking, of course.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Interesting.
SUPFEMALE:I guess Uh, hypothetically speaking, that you would be hypothetically arrested for harboring a known criminal and hypothetically be sent to a very real jail.
SUPFEMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:Fascinating stuff, isn't it, eh? Well, listen I have to go.
SUPFEMALE:If, uh, you hear from your brother, ma'am, please, uh Give me a call.
SUPFEMALE:Keep in mind, withholding information is a federal offense.
OTHERFEMALE:Have a nice night.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:I can't believe I lied to the FBI.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid we can all say the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Not me.
LEADFEMALE:I had my fingers crossed.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure the court will take that into consideration.
LEADMALE:Look, let's try and examine this logically.
LEADMALE:If uncle ned is innocent, then we really didn't do anything wrong by lying to the FBI.
LEADMALE:If he's guilty, then we're harboring a criminal, and we'll all go to jail.
SUPMALE:Let me start again.
LEADMALE:Probably should have told the FBI the truth.
LEADMALE:No, mom, you did the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle ned's your brother.
LEADFEMALE:You had to protect him.
SUPMALE:I mean, if the FBI were looking for Alex, I'm sure I would Sorry, bad example.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
OTHERMALE:Sorry I missed dinner.
LEADFEMALE:How'd it go? Did Jennifer eat all her vegetables? Ned, the man who was here before was an FBI agent.
LEADFEMALE:Darn it! And I missed him? I'm always out of the house when exciting things happen.
LEADMALE:He said you embezzled $4.
LEADMALE:5 million from the syntram corporation.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:That's a lot of money.
LEADFEMALE:Ned, I think maybe we should talk.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I-i think so, too.
LEADMALE:Uh, kids, why don't you go on up to bed now? I just got my second wind.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I don't want to be in trouble with the FBI and mom and dad.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to stay, if it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:I think Alex should hear this, too.
LEADMALE:So, what did you say to the FBI guy? We told him we hadn't seen you, we didn't know where you were.
SUPMALE:I appreciate that you gave me the benefit of the doubt.
LEADMALE:But we only lied 'cause we knew you wouldn't do something like that.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Did you steal the money, ned? Yes.
LEADMALE:Are you crazy? H-have you absolutely gone out of your mind? You have to understand, I-I didn't steal that money for myself.
LEADMALE:I stole it for those 1,800 people who are going to lose their jobs.
SUPMALE:What were you gonna do, send them each 100,000 bucks for Christmas? I felt as though I had to do something to try to stop this merger.
SUPMALE:So before I left, I, uh I took the hemsdale portfolio, all the corporate records and $4.
LEADMALE:5 million in assets, and I hid it.
OTHERMALE:You hid it? Where? In the computer.
LEADMALE:Nowadays the records, all the money, everything is stored on computer disks.
SUPFEMALE:I simply opened up an account in my own name, with an access code that only I know, and I transferred the hemsdale portfolio into it.
LEADFEMALE:This way that merger cannot go through.
LEADFEMALE:Ned, I respect you quitting the job, but stealing the money and the records is downright stupid.
LEADMALE:And whether that money is stuffed in a computer or in a suitcase, it's still stealing.
LEADFEMALE:I was under the impression that you guys once took a stand against things like injustice and blind corporate greed.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't break the law, ned.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no? Why were you in jail during the Democratic convention of '68? You couldn't get a hotel room? It's not the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it's the same thing.
OTHERMALE:It was just fashionable when you did it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you guys took your stand in the '60s, and I respect you for it.
OTHERMALE:And two days ago, I was on the verge of seeing my work, my education, my entire life up to this point come to harvest in the senseless firing of 1,800 people.
LEADMALE:And I took my stand, damn it! You don't have to worry.
LEADFEMALE:I won't involve you in this anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be gone in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:I stopped by your room to talk.
SUPFEMALE:You weren't there.
LEADMALE:I was here.
LEADFEMALE:So I see.
LEADMALE:You were pretty quiet earlier.
LEADMALE:How could you do it, uncle ned? There was no other way to save those jobs.
LEADFEMALE:There had to be another way.
SUPMALE:Maybe you could have done something to create new jobs for those people.
LEADMALE:Like what? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe you could have hired them to help out around your apartment, clean up, stuff like that.
SUPFEMALE:They could take shifts.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I think you're missing the point here.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't understand, uncle ned.
LEADMALE:I thought you loved the business world.
LEADFEMALE:It's exciting, right? Isn't it exciting? Knowing when to buy short and when to sell long.
LEADMALE:When to play hardball and when to use soft soap.
SUPFEMALE:When to lick your wounds and when to bite your bullet.
LEADMALE:Usually you lick your wounds after you bite your bullet.
LEADMALE:See? You know all this stuff.
LEADMALE:Alex, I admit, it was very exciting.
SUPMALE:But in the final analysis, I just didn't have the stomach for it.
LEADMALE:I began to realize there is something very wrong built into the whole corporate structure.
LEADFEMALE:Bite your tongue.
SUPMALE:The survival of a corporation hinges on one thing Its ability to increase profits.
OTHERMALE:You know that.
LEADFEMALE:If little trivial things like ethics and concern for the public good get in the way, they get pushed aside.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle ned, I agree that the hemsdale merger was a pretty sleazy deal.
SUPFEMALE:But you've got to weigh the good with the bad on the scales of injustice.
LEADFEMALE:Let's say this bowl is the 1,800 workers and, uh, this banana represents syntram's corporate health.
LEADMALE:So they're equally important.
OTHERMALE:But, Alex, those people are going to be collecting unemployment, which is a drain on the federal reserve.
LEADFEMALE:In addition, there's the lost revenue to all the smaller businesses that dealt with hemsdale.
SUPFEMALE:Finally, and most important of all, there's the human factor, the intangibles.
LEADFEMALE:Syntram's corporate health is an illusion that is easily stripped away.
OTHERMALE:So you see, when you take all of these factors into consideration, the implementation of this merger is not congruent with the public good.
OTHERMALE:I rest my case.
OTHERMALE:What are you gonna do, uncle ned? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Look for something simple Cottage in the country, swing on the old oak tree, white picket fence.
LEADMALE:Will you marry me, Alex? I don't know what I'm gonna do.
LEADFEMALE:Steven! Aah! Get the kids! Did I wake you? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Am I awake? I've been up all night worrying.
SUPFEMALE:About the FBI? No, about Joey la grande's baseball mitt.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, honey, I can underst Who the hell is Joey la grande? He was a bully who used to push ned around when we were kids.
LEADMALE:Well, one day, ned got fed up, and he stole Joey la grande's baseball mitt.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:The FBI will probably come looking for that, too.
OTHERFEMALE:I told ned that no matter what Joey had done, stealing the mitt was wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Well, ned said he knew that, but he was scared to give it back.
SUPFEMALE:So I took ned to Joey's house, and I stood beside him while he gave the mitt back to Joey.
LEADMALE:That's fascinating, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see? I helped ned.
LEADMALE:I protected him 'cause he was my little brother and he needed me.
LEADFEMALE:He's still my little brother.
LEADMALE:I think we ought to let him stay here, and I'm gonna go tell him that, okay? No, I don't think it's okay.
SUPMALE:Now, look, I love your brother, and I'm worried about him, too, but he can't stay here.
LEADMALE:Why not? Elyse, he didn't just steal a baseball mitt this time.
LEADMALE:He's scared, Steven.
LEADMALE:That's why he came here.
LEADMALE:We can't turn him away now.
LEADMALE:The stakes are too high.
LEADMALE:Ned is not a child, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, he is.
SUPFEMALE:In many ways, he's still a child.
LEADMALE:That's because you treat him like one! You can't keep bailing him out every time he gets into trouble.
LEADMALE:H-he's committed a crime, and we can't be a party to that.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I think maybe ned was right.
LEADMALE:Maybe we are hypocrites.
SUPMALE:What? When ned told us what he'd done, we immediately condemned him for it.
LEADMALE:There was a point in our lives where we would've applauded what he did.
LEADMALE:What ned did was not simply a protest.
LEADFEMALE:It was one man taking the law into his own hands because he thinks he's right.
LEADMALE:That's nothing I can applaud! Hello? It's Mrs.
LEADMALE:obeck next door.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mrs.
LEADMALE:obeck.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:obeck, I'm sorry if we were making too much noise.
OTHERFEMALE:W-what's that? Ned is Elyse's brother.
LEADMALE:No, he is not going to stay here.
SUPMALE:Yes, I know Elyse made a good point.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:obeck, if you don't mind, this is a private matter.
LEADMALE:Good good night.
LEADFEMALE:She always takes your side.
OTHERMALE:Elyse, we shouldn't be fighting.
LEADFEMALE:I know how you feel about ned, but this is his battle.
LEADMALE:You can't protect him forever.
LEADFEMALE:Did you guys hear that? I think somebody's stealing the car.
LEADMALE:I heard it, too.
OTHERFEMALE:See if ned's in his room.
SUPMALE:What do you think the odds are that ned is in his room, Elyse? Uncle ned's gone.
LEADFEMALE:Alex is gone, too.
SUPFEMALE:Alex? Just a minute.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE: Attention, please.
LEADMALE:Flight 437 to Miami beach will be delayed for 30 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You got me here safely.
SUPMALE:Now I want you to go home.
SUPMALE:In case anything goes wrong, I don't want you involved.
LEADMALE:Uncle ned, I may not agree with what you did.
SUPMALE:I may not even understand it.
OTHERFEMALE:But you're my uncle, and I care about you, and I want to help.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I will be fine by myself.
LEADMALE:No, you won't.
SUPMALE:It's not even safe for you to talk to anyone.
SUPMALE:This place could be crawling with FBI agents.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Do you know where gate 27 is? Uh, he doesn't speak English.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, then maybe you know where it is.
LEADFEMALE:I don't speak English, either.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Smooth, Alex.
SUPMALE:The trick is to be inconspicuous.
LEADFEMALE:Just act natural.
OTHERFEMALE:Be cool, collected.
LEADFEMALE:Under no circumstances panic.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Ned! Uncle ned, why don't you just sit over here and I'll go and buy your ticket? Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:How's it going? Pretty good.
SUPMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Do you want something? Nah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, there is one thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I need an airline ticket.
SUPMALE:What a break.
LEADMALE:I happen to sell airline tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you want to go? What do you mean? I think the question is self-explanatory.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I haven't really decided yet.
LEADFEMALE:Let me just step back and look at the big board and see what strikes my fancy.
LEADMALE:Where do you want to go? Seattle.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:The next flight leaves in one hour.
LEADMALE:Name, please.

LEADMALE:Not Alex Keaton? No.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Ned Donnelly.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:Uh, not Not ned Donnelly.
OTHERMALE:My name is definitely not ned Donnelly.
SUPFEMALE:You had less trouble picking a city.
SUPFEMALE:Look, kid, relatively speaking, this is one of life's easier questions.
OTHERMALE:What's your name? Alfredo Gomez.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you sure? Hey, I ought to know my own name.
LEADMALE:I should have guessed it.
LEADMALE:It's written all over your face.
LEADMALE:SeÃ±or.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Gomez.
LEADMALE:Cash or charge? Cash or charge? Cash or charge? Let me think.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be glad to wait while you go ask.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Carlyle! Hello, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Small world, isn't it? Round, too.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? Where? Here.
LEADMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, here.
OTHERFEMALE:What am I doing here? I, uh I come here a lot.
LEADMALE:Oh, you do? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I like airports.
SUPMALE:I like to pretend that I'm going somewhere.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Gomez, do you want smoking or nonsmoking? Are you talk Are you talking to me? SÃ­.
LEADFEMALE:My name is not Gomez.
SUPFEMALE:Do you want to go back to one of your old names? Or do you have a new one for me? This guy's crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Cut the charade, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I followed you here from your house.
OTHERMALE:Boy, that traffic was something, wasn't it? Look, Alex, you're Look, al Look, Alex, you're a good kid.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm going to have to arrest uncle ned.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want you to be involved.
SUPFEMALE:Go home, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Carlyle.
SUPMALE:Please, don't arrest uncle ned.
SUPMALE:He had a good reason.
OTHERFEMALE:Just let him explain.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Aah! Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, what were you thinking? I wasn't thinking.
LEADMALE:I was trying to help uncle ned.
SUPMALE:I feel so bad for uncle ned.
LEADFEMALE: All right.
LEADMALE:All right, come on.
LEADMALE:We're not gonna solve anything by standing around and worrying.
SUPFEMALE:You've got to get to school.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to get to work.
SUPMALE:We're all gonna look pretty silly unless we get dressed first.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Ned! Your tea's ready.
LEADMALE:Are you all right? Why are you here? Fine, and I don't know.
LEADMALE:I was worried about Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Did he make it back okay? Yeah, Alex is fine.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:They're looking for me at the airport now.
LEADMALE:If it's okay, I'd like to hide out here until I can think of something else.
LEADMALE:Just a night or two, all right? No.
SUPFEMALE:That's not all right.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? I think you should turn yourself in.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, ned, but I-i can't bail you out this time.
LEADMALE:Are you implying that there have been other times when you've had to "bail me out"? Do you want a list? Name one, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:The time you took dad's car without permission.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Kids do that kind of stuff all the time.
LEADFEMALE:You left him in Cleveland.
LEADMALE:He had bus fare.
SUPMALE:Maybe this isn't all your fault.
LEADFEMALE:I know I coddled you and I always tried to make things right for you.
SUPMALE:But I've got to say no to you sometime.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Elyse, come on, I mean, what's a couple of days? You won't even know I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't understand this, do you? You don't need a big sister anymore.
SUPMALE:You need a lawyer.
SUPFEMALE:I begged you to go to law school.
LEADFEMALE:This is not a game.
SUPFEMALE:You are not a kid anymore.
SUPMALE:For god's sakes, will you please grow up? 
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:Uncle ned.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, Gomez.
OTHERFEMALE:Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡? Listen, Carlyle is back, and there's another guy with him.
LEADFEMALE:Just give me 10 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Ned! That's all the head start I need.
LEADMALE:No, I'm sorry, but you're going to have to take my word for it.
LEADFEMALE:He's not up there.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Then where is he? Who are you? Elyse, this is Mr.
LEADMALE:Peterson.
LEADFEMALE:He is the president of the syntram corporation.
LEADMALE:And, uh You know Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Carlyle.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to see you all again.
LEADMALE:All right, enough chatting.
LEADFEMALE:Where is he? I presume you're referring to my brother.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I'm looking for the pope.
LEADMALE:Did you try Rome? Or maybe he's touring somewhere.
LEADMALE:That wasn't funny, kid.
LEADMALE:You watch how you speak to my daughter, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Peterson.
OTHERMALE:That's telling him, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:Carlyle, this is supposed to be an arrest! That doesn't mean it can't be pleasant.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we know ned's here.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I had Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Peterson fly in.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Carlyle, I'm sorry we lied to you yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:To be honest, we were very scared.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm telling you the truth when I say now that ned is not here.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Look who's here.
SUPFEMALE:What a pleasant surprise.
LEADFEMALE:It's, uh, ned.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, rob.
LEADFEMALE:Just passing through? No, I came to have you arrested, ned.
LEADMALE:That was my next guess.
SUPFEMALE:All right, look, ned, here's the deal.
LEADFEMALE:If you issue a formal apology and give us that computer access number, we may be willing to reduce some of the charges against you.
OTHERFEMALE:Rob, I'm turning myself in, but I don't plan to reveal that code.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, don't be a fool.
LEADMALE:You know as well as I do that computer can be programmed to crack that code all by itself.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's true.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you probably also know that it'll take about 8.
SUPFEMALE:7 years.
OTHERMALE:But, uh, I'm willing to wait if you are.
LEADMALE:I'll see you in the car, ned.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you really blew it.
LEADFEMALE:You had such a big future at syntram.
LEADMALE:Why, in 15 years, you could've been running the whole place.
LEADMALE:How long you figure it'll take me now? Okay, ned.
OTHERMALE:Get your things.
LEADMALE:We're going downtown.
LEADFEMALE:I've always wanted to say that.
OTHERFEMALE:What made you stop and come back? I tripped over Jennifer's baseball mitt.
LEADFEMALE:I think I tore some ligaments.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, uncle ned.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I'm glad it happened.
SUPFEMALE:As I was lying there on the edge of the front lawn, writhing in pain, desperately trying to flag down a ride, uh, I thought about something.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, I thought about Cleveland and dad and about that time, Elyse, when I stole Joey la grande's baseball mitt.
SUPFEMALE:And you took me back to his house and made me give it back to him.
SUPMALE:And then you beat the hell out of him.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't tell me that part.
LEADFEMALE:It was a long time ago.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse, I didn't want to give Joey his baseball mitt back then, and I certainly don't want to go back to New York now.
LEADMALE:But, uh, if I'm gonna be fighting these battles, I should at least do it in person.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, monkey-face.
LEADMALE:I want you to remember one thing.
LEADFEMALE:What? Never swing at curve balls on the outside corner.
LEADMALE:I won't.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, uncle ned.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, remember, when all else fails, "x" equals 8.
LEADFEMALE:I'll try not to forget.
LEADMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Big business can be exciting and challenging.
SUPFEMALE:But don't put blinders on.
LEADFEMALE:Always remember the things that are really important.
SUPMALE:Two secretaries, huh? Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks for putting up with me, Steve.
LEADMALE:I know it's been rough.
LEADMALE:Well, hey, sometimes it's rough, but it's never dull.
OTHERMALE:Who knows, Elyse? I may just grow up yet.
SUPMALE:I think maybe you already have.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, ned.
SUPMALE:I love you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Take care of yourself, Mr.
SUPMALE:Carlyle.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, ned.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute! I'm just testing.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:you know, we beat windsor elementary today in field hockey.
LEADMALE:That's terrific, Jennifer! How'd you do? Hey, dad, have you been following what's been happening in the stock market lately? I mean, they say that 1,000 is gonna be the base for the future.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, can you picture it? A market with a dow base of 1,000? I grow lightheaded at the very thought.
SUPFEMALE:I was talking, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you mind? Aw, sorry, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:Windsor hasn't lost a game since 1911, and they still have the same coach.
SUPMALE:Look, dad, I've been making a killing on paper every day.
LEADMALE:I mean, I have a knack for picking what's gonna go up and when to get out at a good profit.
SUPMALE:Alex, charting those stocks is just a school project.
LEADFEMALE:They're thinking of firing the coach now.
SUPFEMALE:I know it's just a school project.
LEADMALE:That's what's killing me.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Matthews down at the brokerage house, he keeps recommending my tips to his clients.
LEADMALE:Could we talk about something else here? Alex has monopolized the conversation all night.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want to talk about, Mallory? You have some keen insight for us about lipstick? Alex, your sister has a point.
LEADFEMALE:Enough with the stock market.
LEADFEMALE:Let's hear about some other things that are going on in the world.
SUPMALE:Mal? Well, they have come up with this new lipstick you can just pencil on.
LEADFEMALE:Want to go back to the stocks, dad? Alex, I'm not investing one cent.
SUPFEMALE:It's out of the question.
LEADMALE:Dad, you're missing a golden opportunity here.
LEADFEMALE:It's like taking candy from a baby.
SUPFEMALE:Brings back memories.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse, are you finished? I'm I'm sorry, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:This project isn't working, and it's making me crazy.
SUPFEMALE:I think I have the first recorded case of architect's block.
SUPFEMALE:What's the problem, mom? Well, I'm designing a chapel for the university, and the problem is that people from many different religions are gonna use it.
LEADFEMALE:Why is that a problem? Well, I'm not sure how to allot the space.
SUPMALE:I mean, like, if I have four separate altar areas, then half the time, only 1/4 of the people will be facing the minister of their choice.
LEADMALE:What about revolving pews? I-I'll work on it some more.
LEADFEMALE:I've been following this one stock here sykundo tin.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:It's gonna triple at least.
LEADFEMALE:But we have to get in on it now.
SUPMALE:I told the broker we'd call him at home.
LEADMALE:No way! Alex, you've got to understand, the stock market is a-a very complex, unpredictable thing.
SUPMALE:My own experience with it has been rather, uh We lost a bundle.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be different this time.
LEADFEMALE:All you have to do is reopen the account.
LEADFEMALE:I'll handle it from there.
SUPFEMALE:All the account consists of are the 50 shares of at&t my father gave us for a wedding present.
LEADMALE:And we're not gonna risk that.
LEADMALE:Mnh-mnh.
SUPFEMALE:The phone company.
LEADFEMALE:Where is the challenge? Mallory alone keeps the phone company in business.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, Alex, no! Mom, it's now or never.
SUPMALE:Sykundo tin is gonna be the next McDonald's.
LEADFEMALE:I'm with your dad on this.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry if you think we're being unreasonable.
SUPFEMALE:But Nah.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, I'd like to speak to Mr.
LEADMALE:Matthews, please.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Matthews? Yes, this is Steven Keaton.
LEADMALE:Yes, Alex Keaton's father.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'd like to reopen my account and purchase at the opening bell.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, pardon me for a moment.
SUPMALE:Alex, you're not dad! That's plagiarism! Just be quiet for a minute, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I-I can explain all this.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I could be quiet, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Chew on this, then.
LEADMALE:Uh, sorry to keep you waiting, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Just some, uh, prowlers at the back door.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's right.
LEADMALE:Reopen my account and purchase Just use that at&t stock as collateral.
LEADFEMALE:All right, thank you.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, this isn't as bad as it seems.
LEADMALE:I'll be the judge of that.
LEADFEMALE:What you've just witnessed was done for mom and dad's own good.
SUPMALE:I mean Their anniversary is coming up.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you think they'll be surprised when I give them a nice, big, sentimental check? I mean, everybody's gonna come out of this a winner! I know I will.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Turn over those 500 shares of overdyne we bought.
LEADFEMALE:Right, and all of the genetic stock.
SUPFEMALE:Put everything we have into v.
LEADMALE:I.
SUPMALE:P.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you.
SUPMALE:Actually, it was the wife's idea.
OTHERMALE:Uh, that'll be it for today.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:I suppose you're wondering what that phone call was all about.
LEADFEMALE:Not at all.
OTHERMALE:How's the little woman? Um, mom, I-i was just working on my school project.
SUPMALE:See, I was pretending to buy and sell some stocks there.
LEADFEMALE:Pretending to be grown up, with a family and a dog, will lend some authenticity to the project.
LEADFEMALE:That's all.
OTHERFEMALE:Humor me.
LEADMALE:I've been doing that for 17 years, Alex.
LEADMALE:Did you have a nice run? Oh, it was okay.
LEADFEMALE:Thought I'd clear my mind, but I still haven't come up with any ideas for the chapel.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, don't let it get to you.
LEADMALE:Well, it's hard not to.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I know I'm a good architect, but, suddenly, I cannot come up with a simple solution to an easy problem.
SUPMALE:It just shakes my confidence.
LEADMALE:It makes me feel like I don't know what I'm doing.
LEADFEMALE:You ever felt like that? No.
SUPMALE:Mom We're really gonna have to talk about this exercise kick you've been on lately.
SUPFEMALE:It's killing me.
OTHERFEMALE:It's good for you.
SUPMALE:Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Look at you back already.
OTHERFEMALE:You made good time.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I sort of took a shortcut.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean, you didn't go all the way around the park? She didn't even go all the way around the house.
LEADMALE:Hey, everybody.
LEADMALE:Oh, how's the market doing, Alex? Well, starting with 100 shares of sykundo tin, I parlayed $500 into $3,000.
LEADMALE:Then I opened a margin account, and I made 20% return in three days.
SUPMALE:Then I bought options on a south American oil well, made more than triple value in three weeks, and put everything I have $10,800 Into v.
SUPFEMALE:I.
LEADMALE:P.
LEADMALE:I'm heavily margined, but there's double the chance for profit.
LEADMALE:That's very nice.
LEADMALE:I forgot what I asked you.
LEADFEMALE:What is v.
LEADFEMALE:I.
LEADMALE:P.
LEADFEMALE:? Video industries of the Philippines.
SUPMALE:Maybe you should go there and check out your investment.
OTHERMALE:Go with it, Alex.
LEADMALE:I've got to say, I admire your spirit.
SUPMALE:It's great to see you so excited about a school project.
LEADFEMALE:I'm excited about his project, too.
LEADMALE:Well, I've got an early meeting down at the station.
LEADMALE:I'll grab a bite there.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good day, baby.
OTHERMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Here they go.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:We'll say goodbye at the car.
LEADMALE:I'm in no hurry.
LEADMALE:You guys make breakfast? Now that my workout's over, I think I'll go change.
LEADMALE:Hope I don't stiffen up.
LEADMALE:Sounds like we're doing okay, partner.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, I've turned $500 into $10,000.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe how hot I am! How much is my cut so far? $1,000 for your college fund and $50 for a new bike.
LEADMALE:Not bad just for keeping quiet.
SUPFEMALE:Mom and dad will see things differently when I give them that check for their anniversary.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna take them down to the brokerage house tomorrow and surprise them.
LEADMALE:Alex, mom and dad can't be bought off.
LEADMALE:They're not like you and me.
LEADMALE:We're talking about thousands of dollars here, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Of course, a little cash always puts a new perspective on life.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:How are you? Hi, Mr.
SUPMALE:Matthews.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:I'll be with you in just a second.
LEADMALE:I'm having some trouble with the computer here.
LEADMALE:Keeps jamming.
SUPFEMALE:Circuits must be down.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Oh, have you tried this? See, sometimes you have to clear it during this phase, or it's a real pain.
LEADMALE:I knew that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look at that Trans alloid up a point.
OTHERFEMALE:And petramco up 2 1/2! That's terrific! Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's terrific.
SUPMALE:Well, you're as hot as a pistol, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You got the midas touch, buddy boy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm glad I talked my dad into investing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and that setback with v.
LEADMALE:I.
SUPFEMALE:P.
SUPMALE:, while regrettable, is certainly understandable.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:What setback with v.
SUPFEMALE:I.
LEADFEMALE:P.
LEADMALE:? Uh, Mr.
SUPMALE:Matthews, w-what was that you just said about v.
LEADFEMALE:I.
LEADFEMALE:P.
LEADFEMALE:? Well, there was a typhoon in Manila last night.
OTHERFEMALE:Millions in damage.
SUPFEMALE:The stock dropped 28 points.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, are you sure? About what? About the typhoon! The stocks! Are you sure? Of course I'm sure.
LEADMALE:I'm surprised you didn't know about it.
OTHERFEMALE:What am I, a weatherman?! I've been in school all day! I'm a kid! That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I forget sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, take it easy.
LEADMALE:So it's dropped 28 points.
LEADFEMALE:He bought it at 29.
SUPFEMALE:Look, all he has to do is meet the margin call by closing tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:How much how much How much is the margin call? $2,700.
LEADMALE:That's no big deal.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE: Uh, excuse me, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I've got some customers to take care of.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE: Aah! That's not good for business, Alex.
LEADMALE:Look, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Matthews, those, uh, people out there are my parents.
SUPMALE:M-my dad doesn't know about the typhoon or the margin call.
LEADMALE:Look, Alex, the way your dad plays the market, he understands that a $2,700 margin call isn't the end of the world.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, uh, l-l-let me just tell them in my own way, okay? You don't understand He takes these things very hard! When he was a boy A typhoon wiped out his village.
SUPMALE:Okay, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:If he's gonna take the news anywhere close to the way you're taking it, maybe you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:You found it.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
SUPMALE:Alex, what's going on here? Uh, here? Here, this This is a brokerage house.
LEADFEMALE:They buy.
LEADMALE:They sell.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, you just slammed the door on us.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I didn't want you to come in until everything was just right.
SUPMALE:Clean up that desk, will you? W-why did you want us to come down here? What was all this talk about an anniversary present? Yeah, well, I just thought this would be the best place to give it to you.
SUPMALE:Happy anniversary, mom, dad.
SUPMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:I don't know why you're making such a big deal about this.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, this was not an ordinary afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:You tell us to meet you at a brokerage house to give us an anniversary present.
LEADFEMALE:When we get there, you slam the door in our faces, give us some guy's rolodex, and send us on our way.
LEADFEMALE:I admit, we're not the busiest people in the world, but, um, there are better ways to spend a day.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I might as well tell you the truth.
LEADFEMALE:You've tried everything else, Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, I'm I'm sorry to have gotten you down there under false pretenses, but, uh, I've been trying to, uh Get you to invest for a couple of weeks now.
LEADFEMALE:And I-i figured, once you got down there You know, the excitement of the place, the the roar of the ticker tape, the smell of the crowd You'd catch the fever.
OTHERMALE:I mean, obviously, it didn't work.
SUPMALE:I didn't want it to be a total loss, so I gave you the rolodex.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't want to hear anything else about investing, okay? We're not interested.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, that's final.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you, uh, can't blame me for trying.
SUPFEMALE:Ohhhhhhh! Ohh! Hey, Alex, how did mom and dad like their present? There was no present, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:There was a typhoon in Manila Millions in damage.
LEADFEMALE:The stock went way down.
LEADFEMALE:If I don't come up with $2,700 by tomorrow, they're gonna sell mom and dad's stock.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow.
OTHERMALE:So much for my life.
LEADFEMALE:So much for my bike.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, I need help.
SUPMALE:I'm desperate.
LEADMALE:And please Don't say "I told you so.
LEADFEMALE:" I won't.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, red cross? Yeah, um, what would I get if I donated a pint of blood? No, in addition to the lollipop.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:How about a gallon? Alex, I can let you have $18.
LEADMALE:11.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Now all I need is another$2,600.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think dad would be suspicious if I asked for a $2,600 advance on my allowance? Jennifer, let's try to be discreet about this.
OTHERFEMALE:We're trying to keep this from mom and dad, remember? Right.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, this is just between you and me, right? Right.
LEADMALE:So, Alex, what are you gonna do? Sell your soul to the devil or your body to someone who's nearsighted? Jennifer! Sometimes when you keep a secret all to yourself, you get a real bad headache.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I'm the one who's got the headache.
SUPMALE:Look, Alex, as painful as it may seem, I think the only thing to do here is tell the truth.
LEADMALE:To mom and dad? What, are you crazy? I meant to the broker.
LEADMALE:Maybe the two of you could work something out.
SUPMALE:I still don't see why I have to be here, Alex.
LEADMALE:For sympathy, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:It's hard to say no to someone when they're holding hands with their 10-year-old sister.
LEADMALE:Want me to limp? No, just, uh, look cute and, uh, be bubbly.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Matthews.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Alex.
SUPMALE:How are you? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Matthews, this is my little sister, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Isn't she sweet? Yeah, I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not really good with little kids.
SUPFEMALE:Nice call, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:But look what's going on, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, digifax up a point.
LEADMALE:Brickhouser up 2 1/2.
LEADFEMALE:That's terrific.
SUPFEMALE:Everything you've recommended Incredible, as always.
LEADFEMALE:My clients have been making a killing.
LEADFEMALE:So, I guess you owe a lot to Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You could look at it that way.
LEADMALE:We are.
LEADMALE:Listen, uh, did you bring the check from your dad? Uh, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Matthews, I need a favor.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll be glad to help if I can.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you know, I never should've bought that v.
OTHERFEMALE:I.
SUPMALE:P.
LEADFEMALE:Stock.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I get it You're feeling guilty because you advised your father to buy a stock and it went down.
LEADMALE:Well, well, that's part of it.
SUPFEMALE:You can't feel that way, Alex.
LEADMALE:Sometimes even I recommend stocks that go down.
LEADMALE:Sometimes people get burned.
LEADFEMALE:But I can't allow myself to become emotionally involved, and neither can you.
SUPFEMALE:We're kind of old-fashioned.
LEADFEMALE:We are emotionally involved with our father.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Matthews, let's say Just for fun, that, uh, my dad ran a little short of cash.
OTHERFEMALE:L-let's even go so far as to say that, uh That he can't come up with the money to cover the stock.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you know me.
LEADMALE:We have a relationship, right? Very good relationship.
SUPMALE:Since we have such a good relationship, and you know my dad and I wouldn't let you get stuck I-I mean, uh W-we'd come up with that money just as soon as I As we could.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, now, considering our friendship a-and all that I've done for you This isn't very good news, is it? No, it's not.
SUPFEMALE:But we invested everything we had with you Our our life savings.
LEADFEMALE:We knew there would be risks going in.
SUPMALE:We discussed that.
SUPMALE:But we're retired people.
SUPMALE:There's no way that we can re-earn what we've lost.
OTHERMALE:We'll lose our house, our car.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't there anything you can do? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Say hi to dad.
OTHERMALE:Now, then, Alex what was it you wanted? I did it.
LEADFEMALE:I never thought I'd finish this chapel.
SUPMALE:You've got to have faith, Elyse.
SUPMALE:See, all the different religions have been satisfied.
LEADFEMALE:I just have that one little blank space down there.
SUPMALE:That could be the agnostics' lounge.
LEADMALE:Yes! Mom, this drawing is so complicated.
LEADFEMALE:Why are there three levels? Well, conceptually, it's similar to the citadel of David in Jerusalem.
OTHERFEMALE:That doesn't help me, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, let me tell you about this in terms you'd understand.
LEADMALE:Uh, have you ever seen "Hollywood squares"? Okay, see, now, the basic design of the chapel is going to be multilayered.
SUPMALE:Now, each faith will have its own room on one of three levels, much like the celebrities on "Hollywood squares.
SUPFEMALE:" Okay, now, uh, now, down here, where Charley Weaver usually sat, we'll have the unitarians, and, uh, over here in, uh, jan Murray's spot, the Jews.
SUPFEMALE:Right up here in the center, the catholics.
LEADMALE:Where rose Marie used to sit! This is wonderful, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Why do all the rooms have these connecting doors? In case anyone wants to convert.
SUPMALE:Hey, kids.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen I've, uh, got to talk to you guys.
SUPMALE:I did it, Alex.
SUPMALE:I finished the chapel! All my problems are over! Not so fast, mom.
LEADMALE:Uh, mal, why don't we go upstairs? Now would be a good time to Um, yeah, you don't have to convince me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm with you.
SUPMALE:Well, Alex, what's wrong? Uh, remember that philippine video stock I was so high on? I'm not so high on it anymore.
LEADMALE:A typhoon wiped out the company.
SUPMALE:Well, it looks like it wiped you out, too.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, that's true.
SUPMALE:I-I had all my money on that stock.
SUPMALE:Well, it can't affect your grade that much.
LEADFEMALE:It was such a little stock.
OTHERFEMALE:So now you'll get a b-plus instead of an "a.
LEADMALE:" I sense that there's more to this story, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, there is.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh I kind of called the broker, and I kind of told him that I was You.
LEADMALE:And I kind of bought some stock with my money.
SUPFEMALE:I was going great, so I bought some more stock And some more And I was heavily margined.
SUPFEMALE:Well, there's a margin call, and if I don't have $2,700 by 4:00, they're gonna sell your at&t stock.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, let me get this straight! You lied to us! You went behind our backs! You pretended you were me, and you spent money that wasn't yours! You make it sound so bad.
SUPMALE:Alex, I can't even believe you had the nerve to do this! Well, I-i guess I just got carried away.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the buying and the selling and the action, I The excitement! We've heard enough about your thirst for excitement! You're a high-school student, Alex, not a flying wallenda! What a jerk I was.
SUPFEMALE:Here I was, acting like I had all the answers, like I was perfect, like I was infallible.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm not, and I know that now.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that realization is punishment enough, huh? Not even close.
LEADMALE:I don't blame you.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I really am.
SUPMALE:Steven, what are we gonna do? I mean, are we gonna let them sell the stock, or are we gonna come up with the money to cover it? Well, as someone who knows the market, it's my opinion Alex! We're gonna give the broker the money and hold on to the stock.
LEADFEMALE:That's just what I was gonna suggest.
LEADMALE:Elyse, uh, why don't you get a check over to the broker? I'll go down to the bank and cover it with savings.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want me to go with you? I want you to stay right where you are! And you might as well get real comfortable, because you are not leaving that spot for the next six months.
LEADMALE:And this is just the beginning.
SUPMALE:No movies, no dates.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds fair.
LEADFEMALE:And no TV! Not even "wall street week"? Especially not "wall street week.
SUPFEMALE:" Come on, dad! I didn't kill a guy! Alex, I'm out $2,700.
LEADFEMALE:I am the major investor in an underwater video company in the Philippines.
LEADFEMALE:They probably have a picture of me in one of their huts with the caption "our founder.
LEADFEMALE:" You're lucky to be getting off this easy.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen, just just in case, I mean, if the stock does go up, we're in this 50/50, right?
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:uh, I-i don't really think I want to play, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Oh? Well, no offense, but it's just not much of a challenge for me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it doesn't matter who wins.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought it would be nice to spend a little time together.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna beat you this time.
SUPMALE:Dad, I'm 138 and 0 against you.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, 138, 0, and 1.
SUPMALE:You're forgetting that time we played to a draw.
SUPMALE:Dad, I had my appendix out that day.
SUPMALE:The anesthetic had worn off.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, dad.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Where do you want to play? Anywhere, Alex.
SUPMALE:You pick.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Let's play in my room, then.
LEADMALE:That way, I can nap while you're thinking of your moves.
SUPFEMALE:Well, see? It's bringing us closer together already! Does anybody need anything else from the kitchen? It's closing.
LEADFEMALE:I thought the kitchen stayed open till 10:00.
SUPMALE:Jeff's coming over to tutor me, and we're gonna be studying in there.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:How is the French coming, mal? Oh, all right, I guess.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:You don't sound very enthusiastic.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's just that I'm not getting anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? You've gone from a c-minus to a "b" in French since Jeff's been tutoring you.
OTHERFEMALE:She meant she's not getting anywhere with Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer! Come on, mal.
SUPFEMALE:It's no secret how you feel about Jeff.
LEADMALE:Not anymore.
SUPMALE:Mallory, where are your priorities? Now, we hired Jeff to help raise your grade in French, remember? We've accomplished that, mom.
LEADFEMALE:It's time to move on.
LEADMALE:You can't force it, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Either the chemistry's there or it's not.
OTHERMALE:It's just a certain Je ne sais quoi.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you learn that? Last week, when you were doing your idioms.
LEADFEMALE:Were you eavesdropping? I always do when you have a boy over.
LEADMALE:I can't figure it out.
LEADMALE:I think he likes me.
SUPFEMALE:We laugh.
SUPFEMALE:We have a good time together.
LEADFEMALE:But whenever we talk too long about anything other than French, he freezes up.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Jeff's a little shy, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, I think it's cute.
SUPFEMALE:Shouldn't he be here by now? I'm usually eavesdropping by this time.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
OTHERMALE:It's not like him to be so late.
SUPFEMALE:Jeff! Uh, why are you standing there? Didn't the doorbell work? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I didn't try it yet.
SUPFEMALE:I heard voices inside, and I didn't want to interrupt.
LEADFEMALE:You have your work cut out for you, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Uh Je suis Tu es, il est, nous Ãªtes I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I'm always having trouble with these irregular verbs.
OTHERMALE:You just have to memorize them, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:It's just like in English.
LEADMALE:I am, you are, he or she is.
OTHERMALE:Well, I know it in English.
LEADFEMALE:See? You've got a knack for languages.
LEADMALE:You've got a really good sense of humor.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Getting back to conjugation So, how'd you get to be so good in French? I lived in Paris for five years as a kid.
LEADFEMALE:My parents were really mad.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, my dad was in the foreign service.
SUPMALE:Oh, why didn't you ever tell me that? You never asked me.
SUPMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:When we first met, I should have said, "nice to meet you.
SUPMALE:" Was your dad ever in the foreign service? Yes, he was.
LEADFEMALE:What do you do when you're not tutoring me? I go to school.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:We go to the same school.
SUPMALE:I meant personally.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any sports you like, any hobbies Any girlfriends? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:What's her name? No.
LEADMALE:I-i meant sports.
OTHERFEMALE:I play hockey.
LEADMALE:Oh, I love hockey.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could play doubles sometime.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that'd be great.
LEADFEMALE:How about you? Any hobbies? Any other sports you like? Any girlfriends I mean, boyfriends? No.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'm surprised.
OTHERFEMALE:A girl like you No hobbies, no boyfriend? So neither of us has any sports or hobbies or boyfriend girlfriend.
LEADMALE:Except for hockey.
OTHERMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess that's about enough for today.
SUPMALE:Oh, it is? I was hoping we could go further.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just go out the back.
SUPMALE:That way, I won't bother anybody.
SUPFEMALE:So, I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you will.
LEADFEMALE:Au revoir.
LEADMALE:Au revoir.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Jeff's gone already? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:So, Mallory, what happened? There was some stuff I couldn't hear.
SUPMALE:Nothing happened.
LEADMALE:Just when he starts to let down his guard and break the ice, he freezes up again.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just throw yourself at him and get it over with? Jennifer! Would you stay out of my personal life? I'm trying to make sure you ha one.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, girls don't have to be afraid of letting boys know how they feel now.
LEADFEMALE:These are the 1980s.
LEADMALE:What did girls do back then when you were a kid? Back in the 1880s? Actually, it wasn't all that easy for us when I was a girl.
LEADMALE:I mean, if you were interested in a boy, sometimes you just had to wait until they asked you out.
SUPMALE:What if he never asked? Then you called your girlfriend and you set each other's hair.
LEADMALE:You mean, if you liked the boy and he never asked you out, there was nothing you could do about it, right? Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:There were some silly, scheming things that some other girls used to do to attract guys' attention.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? Oh, you know, stupid things like, uh, you could ask a friend to call his friend or you could write your name in his notebook or maybe put your picture in his locker.
SUPMALE:Or if you really liked the guy, you'd try to get your parents to buy the house next door to his.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, mom, did you write your name on the inside of the notebook or on the cover? Well, you know what I used to do Yeah? Mallory, you you are You're missing the point.
LEADFEMALE:Things are much simpler now.
LEADFEMALE:And if you're really interested in Jeff, then you should just ask him out.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you're right.
LEADMALE:Sorry to bother you.
LEADMALE:I forgot my book.
SUPFEMALE:I could come back for it another time if it's more convenient.
SUPMALE:Jeff, come on in.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory has something to ask you.
SUPMALE:Uh Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know if the house next to yours is up for sale? Are you gonna make a move here, dad, or what? Don't rush me, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:These things take time.
SUPMALE:It's been a day and a half, dad.
LEADFEMALE:I think you could at least make your opening move.
OTHERMALE:The opening move is perhaps the most important of the game, Alex.
LEADMALE:It it sets the tone for the entire contest.
SUPMALE:Well, whenever you're ready.
LEADMALE:But, uh, remember, I leave for college in September.
LEADMALE:Okay! Okay.
LEADMALE:I'll wait here while you're mulling the Bonjour, Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:Bonjour, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Hi, Jeff.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I guess we'd better leave you two alone to study and whatever else comes to your mind.
LEADMALE:Jennifer! Well, I hate to kick you out of your own living room.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
OTHERMALE:We could use it anytime.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Alex and dad.
SUPMALE:Huh? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:So, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Uh Can I get you anything? Something cold to drink? That'd be nice, if it's not too much trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no trouble at all.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, make yourself at home.
LEADFEMALE:My dad forgot his book.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Alex, c-can I ask you something? I was wondering if your sister Mallory She likes you, Jeff.
OTHERFEMALE:S-she does? That's great! So, what are you waiting for? Why don't you ask her out? I'm afraid.
LEADMALE:What if she says no? She won't.
LEADFEMALE:What if she says yes? T-then you go out with her.
LEADMALE:That's even scarier.
LEADMALE:What if she doesn't like me? Jeff, I already told you She likes you.
SUPMALE:She likes me as a tutor, but what if she doesn't like me as a date? How are you gonna know unless you go out? Here's some juice, Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:I squeezed the oranges myself.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what? That is a very nice thing to do for someone, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure he appreciates it.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I really do.
LEADFEMALE:May I squeeze something for you? I mean Thank you very much.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, uh My work here is done.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, before I drink this, I have to ask you something.
LEADMALE:There are no pits in it.
SUPMALE:That's great, but that's not what I wanted to ask.
LEADMALE:Wait, there's something I have to ask you first.
LEADFEMALE:Will you go out with me? No.
SUPFEMALE:Will you go out with me? Yes.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:There's something else I have to ask you.
LEADMALE:What? Why did you just say no when I asked you to go out with me? Did I say no? I meant yes.
SUPMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Mallory, when you said yes I meant yes.
LEADMALE: It's about time! Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind? Sorry, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't realize.
SUPMALE:I was kind of caught up in this article.
LEADFEMALE:That's another thing.
SUPMALE:I may not be Boris spassky, but I think you owe me the courtesy of at least looking at the board from time to time, even though it is my move.
OTHERMALE:Dad, it's been your move for an hour and a half.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm ready now.
SUPMALE:Well, good.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa! Alex.
LEADMALE:Oh, sorry, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Alex, let's see you worm your way out of that one.
LEADFEMALE:Ahhhhhh.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't see that.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh Uh Well, uh Listen, I'm, uh I'll go study this someplace where it's a little more quiet! I don't know how anybody's supposed to play chess with all that racket going on! Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Jeff.
SUPFEMALE:You're a little early for your date, aren't you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I am early.
LEADFEMALE:I was hoping to find you here alone.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got to talk to Mallory for me, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I can't go through with it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't go on the date.
OTHERMALE:Jeff, you'll be fine.
SUPFEMALE:I won't be fine! I'm too nervous.
SUPMALE:I've gone over this date in my mind a hundred times.
LEADFEMALE:There were only four times when I didn't spill something.
LEADMALE:You'll be all right.
LEADMALE:Just, uh, don't order anything to drink.
SUPMALE:Alex, the problem is more pervasive than that.
LEADMALE:I should not be going out with Mallory Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:She's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:She's graceful.
SUPMALE:She looks gorgeous in a dress.
LEADMALE:All the things I'm not.
SUPMALE:Let's be thankful for some of that, Jeff.
SUPFEMALE:I can't go through with it, Alex.
SUPMALE:Just tell her I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not telling her that.
SUPMALE:I mean, she's getting ready.
SUPFEMALE:You're here.
LEADFEMALE:You should go out on the date.
LEADMALE:How? Haven't you even been on a date before? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:I went out with Betty Bronson last week.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds good.
LEADMALE:Betty's my cousin.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, it's not ideal, but, uh, the same basic rules apply.
OTHERFEMALE:Just follow this advice, you're guaranteed success on a date.
LEADMALE:Really? Really.
LEADFEMALE:You see, luckily, all women are exactly the same.
LEADMALE:They are? Sure.
LEADMALE:See, I-i know you read a lot today in magazines and newspapers about, uh, "the new woman" and independence, assertiveness.
SUPFEMALE:Why, I-it's simply not true.
LEADMALE:It's not? No.
LEADFEMALE:Surprised, huh? A little.
SUPFEMALE:See, all you have to do to ensure success on a date is to assume total command from the minute the female appears.
LEADFEMALE:See, you are the man.
LEADMALE:You're in control.
LEADMALE:You make that moment.
LEADMALE:Okay, Alex, I'll do it.
LEADMALE:On one condition.
LEADFEMALE:What? You've got to come, too.
LEADFEMALE:A guy, a girl, and her brother are not what we're shooting for here, Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:I need you there, Alex.
LEADMALE:You don't have to sit with us.
LEADFEMALE:Just be somewhere in the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:That way, if I run into trouble, I can come to you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:It's gonna look pretty silly, isn't it? I mean, me sitting at a table by myself? Bring a date.
LEADFEMALE:You can get a date on short notice, can't you? Me? Of course.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, okay, then.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Regina? Yeah, it's me, your cousin Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Will you hurry up, please? I'm here, I'm here.
SUPFEMALE:Where are we gonna sit? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:The, uh, maÃ®tre d' will seat us.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, but don't let him put us near the kitchen, like last time.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, that wasn't my fault.
SUPFEMALE:Why do we have to fight every time we go out?! Good evening, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Table for two? Something romantic.
LEADMALE:She's my sister.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Hey, what are they doing here? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Small world.
LEADMALE:Excuse me for a second.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, what took you so long? I've been trying to stall till you got here.
LEADMALE:Well, it took me a while to, uh, convince Jennifer to come.
LEADMALE:I'm here for the pizza, not the company.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going so far? Terrible.
SUPMALE:Well, what's wrong? Well, we've been talking about the weather for the last 20 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:And that's been the highlight.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is under control.
LEADMALE:Uh, have you ordered yet? Not yet.
SUPMALE:This is good.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:First thing you do Order for both of you.
LEADMALE:Don't even ask her what she wants.
LEADFEMALE:Just order.
LEADMALE:And, uh, when the waiter comes, insult him.
LEADMALE:It'll impress her.
OTHERMALE:Are you sure? I'm sure.
LEADMALE:That's them, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:What are they doing here? Oh, just out for a good time, I guess.
LEADMALE:Are you ready to order? Yes, I think I'll have Uh, she'll have the veal parmigiana.
SUPMALE:In fact, we'll both have the veal.
LEADMALE:Veal for two.
LEADFEMALE:And step on it! Not the veal.
LEADMALE:Something to drink? Um, a root beer, please.
LEADMALE:Ginger ale two.
SUPMALE:Jeff, that was incredibly rude, not to mention the fact I wanted a root beer.
LEADMALE:You didn't like it? No.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Alex! We're getting the pizza with bologna, and that's final! Okay, okay, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Don't make a scene.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, it's not working out.
LEADFEMALE:Why? What's wrong? I insulted the waiter.
LEADFEMALE:I ordered for the two of us, just like you said.
LEADFEMALE:And? She didn't like it.
OTHERMALE:She liked it.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff, believe me Underneath, she liked it.
LEADMALE:Alex, I can't be like you Suave and cool.
LEADFEMALE:That's not me.
SUPFEMALE:That's not Alex either.
OTHERMALE:Just go back to the table and start flattering.
LEADMALE:Tell her that, uh, her hair is like fine-spun silk corn, that, uh, her eyes are are like shimmering pools of beauty.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be sick.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try that.
SUPFEMALE:Jeff, why do you keep going over to Alex? Mallory, your eyes are like shimmering pools of corn.
SUPMALE:What? I wanted a root beer, not a ginger ale.
SUPMALE:Just trust me.
LEADFEMALE:I know what's good And I don't want this.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeff, I don't want the veal.
LEADFEMALE:You'll like it.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Let me get that.
SUPMALE:It's still edible.
OTHERFEMALE:It didn't hit the floor Jeff.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Now I see what he's been doing.
LEADMALE:Very clever, really.
LEADMALE:You see, Alex has been using the nimzowitsch defence, Elyse.
LEADMALE:But it's easily countered with the sicilian variation of the king's gambit declined.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think Alex knows that? Knows what? Well, I-i mean, isn't it possible that the king's gambit declined is exactly what Alex expects you to do? I mean, after all, it's his book.
SUPFEMALE:The fiend.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:How was your date? It's fine.
LEADFEMALE:You're home early, aren't you? Something tells me she and Jeff didn't get engaged.
OTHERMALE:Jeff.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Can I come in? Of course.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in.
SUPMALE:What happened? I'm not sure, exactly.
OTHERMALE:When Mallory left, she was really upset.
LEADMALE:I was hoping she was feeling better now.
SUPMALE:What went wrong? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:We were at the restaurant.
SUPFEMALE:We couldn't think of anything to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:I ordered something for her that she didn't want.
LEADFEMALE:I insulted the waiter.
LEADFEMALE:I spilled drinks, food.
LEADMALE:I ruined her dress.
LEADFEMALE:The next thing I know, she was gone.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like you did all the right things.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted so badly for this to be a special night.
OTHERMALE:I even got Alex to come to the restaurant to help me.
OTHERFEMALE:Aha.
SUPFEMALE:Now we're getting somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:Why did you ask Alex to help? Well, you know, I'm not real good with women, and Alex is.
SUPMALE:Who told you that? Alex.
SUPMALE:He said that Mallory would like me if I were more like him.
LEADFEMALE:Now I know why she ran out.
OTHERMALE:Alex, it didn't work.
LEADFEMALE:Everything you told me was wrong.
LEADMALE:Always assume that's the case with Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, maybe I was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I gave you some advice, and it didn't work out.
LEADMALE:I didn't charge you for it, did I? I-it's not like you're out any money.
LEADFEMALE:That's the important thing.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:IDon't suppose you want to talk, do you? I want you to explain to me why you acted like Alex instead of you.
LEADMALE:Why don't we leave these two alone to talk? Good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff, if you want my advice Whatever you do, don't apologize! You're the man! Mallory, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:For the rudeness or for the spilling or for the general boorish manner? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:What offended you the most? Why were you acting like that, Jeff? That's not like you at all.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you wanted me to be tough and in control and in command.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you'd like that in a guy.
LEADMALE:I like that in an airline pilot, not a date.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to be like that.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be however you want me to be.
LEADFEMALE:You don't like tough and boorish, I can be something else.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeff, don't you realize? I went out with you because I like you.
LEADMALE:You're the guy I wanted to be with.
LEADMALE:Really? Yes.
SUPMALE:But, Mallory, I I'm clumsy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm awkward.
LEADFEMALE:I can't help it.
SUPFEMALE:I like you.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think you still might be able to like me after tonight? Je ne sais.
OTHERFEMALE:But I'm willing to give it a try.
SUPMALE:Je ne sais pas.
OTHERFEMALE:You forgot the "pas.
OTHERMALE:" You see, with the negative, you have to put Jeff? What? Shut up.
LEADMALE:Want to give up, dad? Give up? Are you kidding? Dad, can't we go to bed? I'm tired.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to put a damper on this, honey, but the kids do have to go to school tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Or is that today? Come on, dad.
LEADMALE:I'm tired of this game.
SUPFEMALE:You're just prolonging your own agony, not to mention the agony of your family.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Knight to queen, knight 6.
LEADMALE:Checkmate.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Look for yourself! I won!
OTHERMALE:
OTHERFEMALE: hello.
LEADMALE:Hello, yeah, hello.
LEADMALE:My name is Elyse Keaton, and I'm regional chairperson for the vietnamese relocation services.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, oh, great.
OTHERMALE:You've heard of us.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, what we need is for you to donate some of your time, help with employment opportunities, maybe even send a small check.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you would.

SUPFEMALE:Who would have thought that someone would want Alex? Not me.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.

OTHERFEMALE:So, what did you guys do today? Well, I picked up ming after school, and we went to the library.
LEADMALE:They were showing a film, "the Dewey decimal system and you.
LEADFEMALE:" Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Did you have trouble handling the excitement, ming? Actually, it was very interesting.
LEADMALE:And the librarian's a knockout.
SUPFEMALE:That's true.
SUPMALE:I meant that in a bibliographical sort of way.
LEADFEMALE:After Alex woke me, we went out and got an ice cream soda.
LEADFEMALE:And then Alex asked this girl Uh, ming, that's, uh, guy talk, remember? Gotcha.
OTHERFEMALE:Gotcha.
SUPFEMALE:That's the best thing about having a big brother Guy talk.
LEADMALE:Hey, ming, do you think you'll have time to go upstairs and play with my slot cars? You're on.
LEADFEMALE:I get to use the blue one.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, ming, I-i don't think you do have time for that.
SUPMALE:I was kind of hoping you'd be able to read this before your mom got here.
SUPMALE:That way we'd have something to talk about tomorrow.
LEADMALE:What is it? Oh, it's, uh, just a little something I threw together.
LEADMALE:It's kind of a "weekly reader" version of the "U.
LEADFEMALE:S.
LEADFEMALE:news and world report.
LEADFEMALE:" Just think of it as a companion piece to my "wall street journal" summaries.
LEADFEMALE:Can't I take it home with me, Alex? Ming, it's my only copy.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure you don't want to chain it to his wrist? No, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Alex is right.
OTHERFEMALE:This will be more fun.
LEADMALE:I can play anytime.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to the dining room to study this.
LEADFEMALE:What a kid.
SUPMALE:You know, this really excites me Shaping his ideas, molding his mind.
LEADMALE:Now I know how you guys must have felt when I was growing up.
LEADMALE:No, you don't.
SUPMALE:Alex, you know there's more to being a big brother than just trying to mold him in your image.
SUPMALE:I know that.
OTHERFEMALE:And I and I love that.
OTHERFEMALE:It's great to have a little guy to take places, a little guy to ask me questions, a-a little guy It's great to have a guy who's littler than me.

OTHERMALE:I've heard such nice things about you from ming and Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Alex.
LEADMALE:Actually, most of it was from ming.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know, it wouldn't look right for me to brag about my own family.
LEADFEMALE:You must be so happy to have Alex as a big brother.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know if "happy" is the word I would have chosen.
LEADMALE:Girls, why don't you go let ming know his mom is here? I gave him some pretty interesting stuff.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be hard to tear him away from his reading.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's going to be.
LEADMALE:He looks so cute when he's asleep.
LEADMALE:How you doing, Jennifer? Okay, but my tongue's getting yucky.
SUPMALE:Why don't you guys switch jobs? You can stuff the envelopes, and Mallory can lick them.
LEADMALE:I don't want to mess up my lip gloss, mom.
OTHERMALE:That's okay, mom.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think we have time to retrain her.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, gang.
LEADMALE:Hi, dad.
SUPMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:How was it down at the station? Oh, a little disappointing.
OTHERFEMALE:The ratings for "oh, my Ohio" keep slipping.

OTHERMALE:It's informative, it's entertaining, it's educational.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what was it about last night? Uh, last night? I didn't actually see it last night.
LEADFEMALE:Dad? Uh, I-i meant to see it.
LEADFEMALE:I saw it.
LEADFEMALE:It was about highway repair.
OTHERMALE:If any potholes spring up in the living room, call me.
LEADMALE:How's it going here? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:We're getting out the announcements for the circus benefit.
LEADFEMALE:I have a lot of big surprises there, too.
SUPFEMALE:As long as there's nothing that involves me and a tiger.
LEADMALE:Alex home? No, he's out with ming.
LEADMALE:Uh, they went to a lecture on money management for success-oriented adolescents.
SUPFEMALE:Same kind of thing we did when we were kids.
SUPMALE:Huh? Alex, you're supposed to be his big brother, not his twin brother.
LEADFEMALE:No, he picked it out all by himself.
SUPMALE:I said he could buy any outfit in the store he wanted, or I'd buy him this one.
LEADMALE:Guess you were short of cash, huh, ming? We also got these.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna hang them up in our rooms.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna take these upstairs.
OTHERMALE:I want to hang up mine now.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll bet nobody else has a great big picture of Alex in his room.
LEADFEMALE:Alex does.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:He's hard to keep up with.
LEADMALE:You having a good time with him, ming? Well, the time of my life.
LEADMALE:Alex is the greatest.
LEADMALE:He's brainwashed him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know Alex can be a little intense at times.
LEADMALE:He's probably just going through a phase.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's what we thought at first.
SUPFEMALE:Now we think it's nutritional deficiency.
SUPMALE:All right, what do you want to do now? Let's look at the chart.
SUPMALE:What kind of chart is that? Oh, well, when I took on the responsibility of being ming's big brother, I had to reorganize my time.
SUPFEMALE:It wasn't easy, but I think I've got it worked out.
SUPFEMALE:See, I mapped out all my activities School, chess club, girls, special girls, susie farkas.
LEADFEMALE:Well, commerce department hearings start in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:What say we go upstairs and get our notebooks ready? But, Alex, what about free play? Well, we had free play yesterday.
LEADMALE:I'm a kid, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I need to play every day.
SUPFEMALE:All right, you've got, uh, four minutes.
SUPMALE:What do you want to do? I guess the mile run is out.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever you want to do, Alex, is fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't we go outside and toss the football around, then? We've got time for, uh, 23 throws each, allowing for miscellaneous flubs.
OTHERFEMALE:I say we go for it.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go for it.
SUPMALE:You're gonna go for the whole four minutes, huh, Alex? Why not? Life is short.

OTHERFEMALE:Come on down, ming.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:Oh! You look terrific.
LEADMALE:What a wonderful costume.
LEADMALE:Are you a happy clown or a sad clown? I'm happy.

LEADMALE:You see, uh, I really did forget about the circus.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
OTHERMALE:You've got a lot on your mind.
LEADMALE:No, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:See, I forgot.
LEADMALE:I-I made other plans.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we got a meeting of the young entrepreneurs' club today.
SUPFEMALE:I'm taking pictures for the yearbook.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, but I won't be able to go to the circus with you.
LEADMALE:That's okay.
SUPMALE:Do I look like someone who'd want to go to the circus? Maybe a little.
SUPMALE:I got a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't I go to the meeting with you? That way we can still be together this afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be silly, ming.
LEADMALE:You're gonna have a lot more fun at the circus.
OTHERMALE:Fun's not that important, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You taught me that.
SUPMALE:Look, ming, you're going to the circus.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have a great time with my family.
LEADMALE:What about the big brother/little brother parade? I'll take you next week.
LEADFEMALE:We'll walk around together.

LEADMALE:They're very nice.
OTHERFEMALE:They helped me put together this outfit, with makeup and everything.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and you look great.
OTHERMALE:They drew a big mouth on you and a big nose.
OTHERMALE:They even drew a little tear.
LEADFEMALE:Every time we go to the circus, it's always the same thing.
LEADMALE:You know you guys shouldn't eat all that stuff, but you go right ahead and do it.
SUPMALE:Once in a while, we just can't resist.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'd better go upstairs and change.
SUPMALE:Thanks for taking me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ah, honey, it was our pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry you didn't have such a good time.
OTHERMALE:I had a really good time, a great time.
LEADFEMALE:What made you think I didn't have a really good time? Well, most kids don't cry during the high-wire act.
SUPFEMALE:I was worried about them.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:How you doing? Hey, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex.
OTHERMALE:So, how was the circus? It was great.
LEADMALE:A man put his head inside a lion's mouth.
LEADMALE:I hope he worked there.
LEADMALE:Uh, girls Why don't you take ming for a walk? Are you kidding? It's freezing outside.
LEADFEMALE:Then walk him around the dining room.

LEADMALE:I shouldn't have let ming down like that.
SUPFEMALE:I took on a responsibility, and I didn't handle it at all.
LEADMALE:I let him down.
LEADFEMALE:I let myself down.
LEADFEMALE:I let everybody down.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess we told him.
OTHERFEMALE:Hope we weren't too rough on you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Alex, "oh, my Ohio" is on.

SUPMALE:You don't seem very happy lately.
LEADFEMALE:You've been moping around for days.

LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, Alex, Alex.

LEADMALE:And I love him very much.
LEADMALE:I couldn't be happier.
LEADMALE:You know, I'll never forget the first day I met him.
LEADFEMALE:I wore plaid, he wore stripes.
LEADMALE:I was afraid we'd clash.
LEADMALE:But we looked great together.
LEADMALE:It's nice that you remember that, Alex.
LEADMALE:It's not an easy day to forget.
LEADFEMALE:He had such a cute walk, one foot in front of the other.
SUPFEMALE:And then when he ran, it was the same thing, only faster.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't plan on becoming emotionally involved.
LEADMALE:But this crazy thing just happened.
LEADMALE:You don't plan those things, Alex.
LEADMALE:You don't control them.

LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:In the bed.
LEADMALE:That's the place for it.
LEADFEMALE:Were you always this boring, Alex? I'm nervous.
LEADFEMALE:I always talk like this when I'm when I'm nervous.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes I just ramble on with no idea what I'm saying.
LEADMALE:I think this is one of those times.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I-i just wanted to come by and say hi and, uh, give you this.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:But I don't know when I'll be dressing up like a clown again.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, always makes a great paper weight.
SUPMALE:My mom's getting me a new big brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Bigger than you.
SUPFEMALE:I guess there's no chance you'd take me back, huh? Why should I? Because I miss you, ming.
LEADFEMALE:You've got a lot of nerve, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You dump me, and then because you miss me, you expect me to take you back? I'm not saying I deserve you.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying I want you.
SUPMALE:You don't want me.
LEADFEMALE:You want a little you.
LEADFEMALE:You want someone that looks like you, acts like you, and thinks like you.
LEADFEMALE:Is that how I acted? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I can't be Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got to be ming.
LEADMALE:We had a lot of good times, ming.
SUPMALE:Going to the movies, tossing the ball around, guy talk.
SUPMALE:If you don't want to read "the wall street journal," y-you don't have to.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't want to be a young republican, it won't bother me.
LEADFEMALE:What if I want to be a liberal democrat? Why would you possibly Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be with you.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't like it, but I'd be with you.
LEADMALE:Well I already got your picture up.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome back.
LEADMALE:It's great to be back.

LEADMALE:We'll have to see how you do.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna be okay.
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:now, remember, girls, concentration is the single-most important factor in an athlete's performance.
LEADMALE:Index finger of the left hand interlocking with pinkie of the right.
LEADFEMALE:And in your mind's eye, you should be able to see the ball going into the cup.
SUPMALE:I think your mind's eye needs glasses, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, kids.
LEADFEMALE:How was the wedding? Oh, the wedding was fine.
SUPFEMALE:I think the marriage is in trouble, though.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hon, you got to give them a chance.
OTHERMALE:They've only been married for a couple of hours.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse, only one of them's going on the honeymoon.
LEADMALE:Okay, I admit that's a bad sign.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll keep the mystery alive, anyway.
LEADMALE:It was a beautiful ceremony.
OTHERMALE:Ron caught the bouquet.
OTHERFEMALE:Wasn't just a catch, Suzanne.
LEADMALE:I had to elbow out two cousins and a flower girl to make that catch.
OTHERFEMALE:We're all very proud of you, Ron.
OTHERMALE:So, Alex, how's the golf? You ready to, uh, enter any tournaments yet? I think the only way Alex will get into a tournament is inside someone's golf bag.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:Put your head down on this little tee.
LEADMALE:Alex, the most important thing is never take a sport too seriously.
SUPFEMALE:Have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:That's the only way to approach it.
SUPMALE:Am I right? Right, Ron.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Steve, best 6 shots out of 10.
SUPMALE:Loser pays the other guy's mortgage for a year.
LEADFEMALE:You're on.
LEADMALE:Hey, uh, Suzanne, you want to keep score? No, I don't think so, Ron.
OTHERFEMALE:The excitement might be too much for me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, can we come and watch? Well, it's hard to concentrate with a lot of noise.
LEADMALE:We'll root for you this time, daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You can come.
SUPMALE:Suzanne, do you want some coffee? Oh, no, thank you, Elyse.
LEADMALE:It'd just keep me awake tonight.
SUPMALE:I'm having enough trouble falling asleep as it is.
SUPFEMALE:Something bothering you? Oh, no, not really.
LEADFEMALE:You know.
LEADFEMALE:This and that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's so clichÃ©, Elyse, I'm embarrassed.

SUPFEMALE:She's left with a big void in her life.
LEADFEMALE:What about Ron? He's the big void.
SUPFEMALE:Is this Is this something recent? Well, things haven't been quite right for the last 13 years or so.

LEADMALE:Need any beer, Elyse? Do you want a job? I mean, you could work for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Work for you? All I know about architecture is that the ceiling should be above the floor.
LEADMALE:Well, you'd do office work.
OTHERMALE:You know, make phone calls and type.
SUPMALE:It would take a lot of pressure off me to have someone take care of those things.
LEADFEMALE:You sure you're not offering me this job just to make me feel better? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, not at all.
LEADFEMALE:I've been thinking of hiring someone for a long time.
OTHERMALE:I was going to hire someone qualified, but I'm sure that I don't mean that you're not qualified.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean Well, you know what I mean.
SUPFEMALE:What do you say? What time do I report for work, boss? Tomorrow morning at 9:00.
SUPMALE:Oh oh.
LEADFEMALE:9:00 is tough.

SUPMALE:It rolled under the car.
SUPMALE:So could you crawl under there and get it for us? I'll be here at 8:30.

LEADFEMALE:Let me check this with you, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Under your ambition, I've got, "to always be in fashion"? Right.
LEADMALE:Aim high, I always say.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Jennifer, you're not making me out to look frivolous in this thing, are you? It has to be factual.
LEADFEMALE:It is a biographical sketch.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:If you were to describe yourself with one word, the essence of your personality, what would it be? Perky! I'll think of something, and I'll put it down.
LEADFEMALE:Are you ready, Alex? Uh, I don't think I can follow that, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I can't top "perky.
OTHERFEMALE:" You guys should hurry up and finish.
LEADFEMALE:Suzanne will be here any minute.
SUPMALE:I can't believe it's my turn to carpool again.
LEADMALE:It seems like only yesterday I did it.
OTHERMALE:It was only yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:That explains it.
OTHERMALE:You're filling in for Sandy whistleman.
SUPMALE:The kids don't like driving with him anymore.
LEADMALE:Yeah, he's always in such a hurry.
LEADFEMALE:Last time, he didn't even stop to let us out.

SUPFEMALE:I brought these two backups just in case.
LEADMALE:It really wasn't necessary.
SUPMALE:Come, kids, you don't want to be late for school, do you? 
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Suzanne, good luck in your new job.
SUPMALE: Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Hope your boss treats you okay.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye.
OTHERMALE:Uh Yeah.
LEADMALE:Welcome to your new job.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:How am I doing so far? Oh! Okay, now the first thing I need you to do for me Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Is to type this letter.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Okay? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Now, do you want this double-spaced or single-spaced? Uh, single spaced, I think.
OTHERMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Double-spaced would be easier to read.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Double-spaced.
LEADMALE:Hi, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Hi, don.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Don Bradford.
LEADMALE:My new assistant, Suzanne Davis.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do? How long have you been working here? Oh, almost 3 minutes.
LEADMALE:Huh.
LEADMALE:About ready to retire, huh? Don.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:The wife and I had a chance to look over the plans for the summer home, and, uh, we've got a few questions.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:First question.
LEADFEMALE:I think we were wrong about the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:We'd like to have it moved.
SUPMALE:You want it indoors, then? Mm.
LEADMALE:It's not me.
LEADFEMALE:It's Shirley.
SUPFEMALE:Well, okay.
SUPMALE:That's no problem.
SUPFEMALE:We can bring that indoors, and you can still have that rustic feeling you want.
SUPFEMALE:What else? Oh, you know that fireplace we talked about? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:That's the focal point.
LEADFEMALE:The emotional centerpiece.
OTHERMALE:I designed the whole room around it.
LEADFEMALE:Lose it.
LEADMALE:We're gonna put a giant TV screen there.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea.
SUPMALE:A fireplace is more trouble than it's worth.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's gonna change the whole concept of the home, though, isn't it? Oh, look, I don't know anything about architecture.
LEADFEMALE:That's your job.
LEADFEMALE:I just know what I like.
LEADFEMALE:Do we really need this utility room here? I think it'd work much better on the other side.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know, you may have something there.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:That would enable us to lose this wall here, which is serving no purpose that I can see.
LEADFEMALE:It's holding up the house, Suzanne.
SUPFEMALE:We're not architects, Elyse.
LEADMALE:We're just telling you what we want.
SUPFEMALE:Look here.
LEADFEMALE:You see this deck? Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:This is redwood.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think that's all right? You know what would be good out here? What? Rubber.
SUPMALE:Rubber.
SUPMALE:Rubber?! Hey, we're just bouncing a few ideas around.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Elyse, be a dear and put some tea up for us, please.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see why not.
LEADMALE:Don, let's talk closets.
LEADMALE:Elyse, aren't you ready yet? Do I look ready? No, not really.
LEADMALE:That's why the question came to mind.
LEADFEMALE:And if you had any consideration at all, you would not be taking me out to a nice dinner tonight.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'm just a heel.
OTHERFEMALE:And you certainly wouldn't have asked Suzanne and Ron to join us.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you invited them, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sure, throw that up at me now.
LEADMALE:Okay, uh, Mallory, I'm going to go back upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:When my wife comes in, would you ask her to call me? Steven, I'm I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to snap at you.
LEADMALE:Mommy, are you going through a midlife crisis? No.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that thanks to Suzanne's interference, I've had to totally redesign the Bradford house.
LEADFEMALE:I thought the bradfords loved that design.
LEADMALE:The bradfords loved it.
SUPMALE:Suzanne didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Well, try to make the best of it, Elyse.
SUPMALE:She's a good friend, and it's only one house.
SUPMALE:Not anymore.
SUPFEMALE:It's a duplex.
LEADMALE:And it's not just the bradfords' house.
OTHERMALE:It these past two weeks with Suzanne have just been torture.
OTHERMALE:If it's made me awfully cranky, guys, I apologize.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna have to fire her, mom? I can't fire Suzanne.
LEADMALE:She's my friend.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if I can hurt her like that.
LEADMALE:Mom, this is business.
LEADMALE:Y-you can't let feelings enter into it.
LEADMALE:This body comes with feelings.
OTHERMALE:It's a package deal.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's exactly why women will always be second rate in the business world.
LEADMALE:Alex, your credibility has just sunk to a new low with this crowd.
OTHERMALE:N-now now, maybe he's right.
LEADFEMALE:Mom! No, not about women being second-rate, but about feelings not entering into business.
LEADMALE:I mean, the fact is, that ever since Suzanne's been with me, I have fallen further and further behind.
SUPFEMALE:I can't do my best work when she's taking up my time.
SUPMALE:So as a professional, I should fire her tonight before I change my mind.
LEADMALE:I just changed my mind.
LEADMALE:You want me to do it for you, mom? I'll do it.
OTHERMALE:I won't like it, but I'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Suzanne, Ron.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry we're late.
LEADFEMALE:We, uh, had some car trouble.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't have any car trouble, Suzanne.
SUPFEMALE:Don't lie to these people.
OTHERFEMALE:The truth is, we had a fight A screaming, yelling, clawing fight.
OTHERFEMALE:A fight, car trouble What's the difference? Kids, why don't you go upstairs? I'll bring the ice cream later.
LEADFEMALE:What ice cream? The ice cream I'll bring you if you go upstairs right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:This is bribery But it'll work.
SUPMALE:Ron, take me home now, okay? I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.
LEADMALE:Suzanne, sweetie pie, why are you taking this so personally? The fact that I want to move out of the house has nothing to do with you.
LEADFEMALE:So, what will it be tonight Chinese or Italian? Really doesn't matter to me.
LEADMALE:Our treat if we leave right now.
SUPMALE:Look, I-i-i need to spread my wings, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:Look for new horizons.
OTHERMALE:Italian's good.
OTHERFEMALE:Little wine, relax.
LEADMALE:Vino, huh? After all I put up with all these years, now he wants to leave me.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that fair? Look, Suzanne, you're not acting very maturely about this.
SUPMALE:I'm willing to go out and have a good time.
LEADMALE:I want us to stay friends.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think I could stay friends with a snake? An insect? A a diseased crawling maggot? I guess that's a "no.
SUPMALE:" Okay.
LEADMALE:I have tried to be nice.
LEADMALE:See you around, Suzanne.
LEADMALE:Hey, you're beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Ciao.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Suzanne, I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:A-are you all right, Suzanne? Well, 20 years.
LEADMALE:Over.
SUPMALE:Gone pfft.
LEADMALE:Oh! Well, I-i almost feel like I have nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll tell you one thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I just thank god I've got my job with you.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Mr.
SUPMALE:Bradford.
SUPFEMALE:I'm working as quickly as I can.
LEADMALE:Those are major changes you suggested.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not the elevator that's hard.
OTHERMALE:It's the second floor that goes with it.
LEADMALE:I don't care what Suzanne said.
OTHERFEMALE:Second floors are hard.
SUPMALE:Lo i-I'll talk to you later at the meeting.
SUPMALE:Yes, Suzanne will be there.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Suzanne strikes again, huh? You've got it.
LEADFEMALE:Is it as bad as when she ordered the bumper stickers that said, "architects have flying buttresses"? I don't know what I'm gonna do with her.
LEADMALE:You were ready to fire her two weeks ago, mom.
LEADFEMALE:What's holding you up? Her husband left her.
LEADMALE:That's what's holding me up.
SUPFEMALE:Her whole world fell apart.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to come in and deliver the final blow.
LEADFEMALE:Business can't come to a grinding halt just because of a broken marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Marriages are falling apart all the time these days.
LEADMALE:Alyson gerber's mother brought home a new father, two brothers from a club med vacation.
LEADMALE:All she wanted was a grass skirt.
OTHERMALE:What ever happened to the good old days when a husband and wife stuck together even if they hated each other's guts? Yeah, those were the days.
LEADMALE:It sure is hard to be a kid today.
LEADMALE:You never know when your family unit's gonna fall apart.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, you don't have to worry about that.
SUPFEMALE:This family unit isn't going to fall apart.
LEADMALE:You promise? We can't promise, because nobody knows what the future is going to bring.
SUPFEMALE:But I can tell you we'll do our best to keep that from happening.
SUPFEMALE:I'd rather have a promise.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you need to worry, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:People who kiss as much as they do are bound to stay together.
LEADMALE:You know, I think she's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Aw, you had to remind them, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:We're just doing this for you three, so you'll know our marriage is okay.
LEADMALE:It's not like we enjoy it or anything.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that's enough.
LEADMALE:We get the point.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:I remember kissing.
SUPFEMALE:Rub it in.
LEADFEMALE:Can we get going, dad? What? We It's my turn to drive again? What about Pete dillman's father? Isn't it his turn to drive? Well, he and Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:dillman split up.
LEADMALE:Well, what about Mrs.
LEADMALE:dillman's new boyfriend? He's too young to drive.
SUPFEMALE:See ya.
OTHERMALE:Are you all right, Suzanne? Oh, it's nothing.
OTHERMALE:Just seeing you and your kids and your husband so happy kind of got me depressed, that's all.
LEADMALE:Do you want to talk about it? No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, now is not the time or the place to discuss my personal problems.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Now, let's just get down to work, please.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Did you happen to see the drawings for the Edwards' house here? I thought I left them on your table.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, desk, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:You said you'd call it a desk.
OTHERMALE:The important thing is, did you see them? Yes, I saw them, and I mailed them.
SUPMALE:Suzanne, they weren't finished yet.
SUPMALE:Oh, finished them.
SUPFEMALE:I put a little window in here and a little door in there.
SUPMALE:I think you'll like them.
LEADFEMALE:Suzanne, you shouldn't have done that without asking me first.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:My enthusiasm just got the best of me.
LEADFEMALE:It won't happen again.
LEADMALE:It just comes from having so much time at home alone with nothing to do, no one to talk to.
LEADMALE:Do you want to talk about it? No.
LEADMALE:No, no, I came here to work, not to discuss my personal problems.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe Ron.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know what he wants to do now? Take skydiving lessons.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you're gonna sky-dive, I think lessons are important.
LEADFEMALE:He's acting like such an adolescent, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I oh, I-I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I know I shouldn't be rambling on like this.
OTHERFEMALE:Suzanne, maybe you'd like to take some time off to collect your thoughts.
OTHERFEMALE:Like a year or two.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna sit at home and feel sorry for myself.
LEADMALE:Everybody's treating me like I'm some kind of war casualty.
OTHERMALE:Like I might fall to pieces at any minute.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:That's not gonna happen.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna make a life for myself whether Ron's in it or not.
SUPFEMALE:That's the spirit, Suzanne.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'll tell you another thing.
LEADFEMALE:If one more person pussyfoots around me and offers me comfort instead of respect, I'll scream.
SUPMALE:I just want to be treated like anybody else.
LEADMALE:You're absolutely right.
SUPFEMALE:Now, let's get down to work.
OTHERMALE:I have a great idea for reorganizing the office.
OTHERMALE:Suzanne, you're fired.
LEADMALE:That wasn't it.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, you can't let this thing with Suzanne upset you so much.
SUPMALE:She was driving you crazy.
LEADMALE:You had to let her go.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but if you'd seen her face, you'd know why I was so upset.
LEADMALE:You want to come up to my room and listen to some blues records, mom? They always help me when I'm feeling down.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, the only records you have are the muppets.
LEADFEMALE:They don't sing the blues.
OTHERFEMALE:They do if you play them in the wrong speed.
OTHERMALE:Mom, you did Suzanne a favor.
SUPFEMALE:Now that she's had a little fling in the business world, she can go back to the kitchen, where she belongs.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you're gonna make some woman a wonderful master someday.
LEADFEMALE:I hope so.
SUPMALE:Good night, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Sleep well.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Suzanne, uh H-hello.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to talk to Elyse.
LEADMALE:Hello, Suzanne.
LEADMALE:Hello, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I've got something to say to you.
SUPFEMALE:Where would you like me, Suzanne? Upstairs or in the kitchen? It's up to you.
LEADMALE:It's your house.
LEADFEMALE:The kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:It's quieter in there.
LEADMALE:Well, Suzanne, you look good.
LEADMALE:It's a beautiful sweater.
LEADFEMALE:When did you get it? Let's stop beating around the bush, Elyse.
LEADMALE:You know why I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Suzanne, maybe I was a little hasty this afternoon.
LEADMALE:Maybe we could work things out.
LEADMALE:Oh, Elyse, I came here to apologize to you.
OTHERFEMALE:You were the first person who respected me enough to hold me responsible for my actions.
SUPFEMALE:You dealt with me as Suzanne, not the poor deserted wife.
SUPMALE:Only a friend would do that.
SUPMALE:We are still friends? Oh, of course.
SUPMALE:But if you had been nicer to me, I bet we would have wound up enemies.
OTHERMALE:But because you kicked me out into the cold, brutal world, because you had no regard for my personal feelings or well-being, you made me see that I better stand up on my own.
LEADMALE:What are friends for? Because you rubbed salt into my festering wounds Suzanne, please, you've thanked me enough.
SUPMALE:I've done a lot of thinking today.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a lot more thinking to do.
SUPMALE:But you've put me on the right track.
LEADMALE:I've got to decide what to do with my life, what to do about Ron, about a career.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Elyse.
LEADMALE:My wife here? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:That's her right over there.
SUPFEMALE:Good memory.
LEADFEMALE:Suzanne, got some good news for you.
SUPFEMALE:I've decided to come back home.
LEADFEMALE:Whoopee.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, I missed you.
LEADMALE:I really did, okay? All better now? Hey, Steve, get out here! It's gonna be like old times, you'll see.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
LEADFEMALE:Suzanne, this is no time to play hard to get.
LEADMALE:I'm back, and you've got me.
LEADMALE:Oh, Steve.
SUPFEMALE:Ready for another putting match? I got my clubs out in the car.
LEADMALE:Ron, I'm not sure this is the right time for it.
LEADFEMALE:Why? You tired? Ron, you're incredible.
OTHERMALE:And if you think I want you back, you're not only incredible, you're stupid.
SUPFEMALE:Suzanne, I had a little lapse.
SUPFEMALE:I'm over it.
SUPFEMALE:It's time for you to forgive me, like you always do.
LEADFEMALE:Not this time, Ron.
LEADFEMALE:You can't just walk all over me.
LEADMALE:I'm not a doormat.
SUPMALE:I'm a person.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got feelings.
OTHERMALE:I've got my own identity.
LEADMALE:I've got a b.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:In medieval folk dancing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready to face the world.
LEADMALE:Not true.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have a b.
SUPFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:In folk dancing.
LEADMALE:You're two credits short.
LEADMALE:That's another thing I'm thinking about Changing my major.
LEADFEMALE:Guess there's no point in my trying to talk you out of this.
LEADMALE:None whatsoever.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I might as well leave, then.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Steve, you want to, uh Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Suzanne, I don't understand what you're doing, but, um But I'll respect your wishes.
SUPFEMALE:It's kind of nice to see you so strong, so independent.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you've really changed.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Ron.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I can, too.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe.
OTHERMALE:I'll bring my laundry by on Friday.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, there's a card here from Suzanne.
LEADMALE:It's addressed to both of us.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:How's she doing? Uh, "having a wonderful time here.
LEADMALE:" Greek is very hard to pick up, but I'm not.
OTHERFEMALE:" "I communicate with the natives "through the universal language of dance.
LEADFEMALE:"This works out well, although it is difficult "to order in a restaurant.
LEADMALE:"Have to run now.
OTHERMALE:"Nik Nikolas and I "are going off to stomp some grapes.
LEADMALE:Love, Suzanne.
SUPFEMALE:" Let me see the postcard.
LEADMALE:It's a picture of the acropolis.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, she penciled in the second story.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, it isn't like you to have such a closed mind.
SUPMALE:I think Dale Lewis would make a good state senator.
SUPMALE:He has some very interesting ideas.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:It's just hard to get excited about someone whose entire campaign revolves around changing the state bird.
LEADFEMALE:What have you got against chickens? I don't think chickens would look good on the state flag.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:But changing the bird is just part of his campaign.
OTHERFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:He also wants a new Ohio state song.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with that? He wants "Oklahoma.
OTHERMALE:" Okay.
SUPMALE:It's not a big issue.
SUPMALE:It just shows he's willing to address himself to even the smallest details.
LEADMALE:I think that's an admirable quality.
LEADFEMALE:It's an admirable quality in a tailor.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like my representatives to address themselves to more important issues.
LEADMALE:Look, if you're so dead set against Lewis, there's no point in your hearing him speak tonight.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just stay home? Maybe I will.
LEADFEMALE:Good for you, mom.
LEADMALE:This Lewis guy is a real clown.
SUPMALE:He wants to cut defense spending.
SUPMALE:He wants to increase welfare spending.
LEADMALE:He supports the era.
SUPFEMALE:The man is an admitted liberal.
LEADMALE:I think you're right not to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Steven, we're gonna be late.
SUPMALE:Uh, Jennifer says I have to babysit tonight.
SUPMALE:Uh, that's right, Mallory, it's your turn.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff asked me to go to the movies with him.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you knew we were going to go out, and you knew it was your turn.
LEADFEMALE:But I couldn't say no.
LEADMALE:You know how insecure Jeff is.
SUPMALE:As it was, he called three times in a phony voice.
SUPMALE:It could be weeks before he asks again.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you let her go? To be honest, I enjoy the solitude.
LEADMALE:I might even write a poem.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, honey, you're still too young to stay alone.
LEADMALE:We'd better get going, or we're gonna be late for the meeting.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:We don't want to miss the opening chorus of "Oklahoma.
LEADMALE:" Bye.
LEADFEMALE: Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
SUPMALE:The answer is no.
SUPMALE:Oh, why can't you stay with her? You're not doing anything tonight.
LEADMALE:That's not the point.
SUPMALE:Mallory, she's your responsibility tonight.
LEADMALE:You got to learn to carry your share of the burden around here.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you what, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You stay with her this time.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll do it the next three.
SUPFEMALE:Make it five, you've got a deal.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
SUPMALE:This is doing great things to my self-esteem.
OTHERMALE:I just hope you realize, Mallory, you are shirking your responsibility tonight, not to mention disappointing your little sister.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:My heart goes out to her.
LEADFEMALE:I'd better find something decent to wear.
LEADMALE:Well, kid.
LEADFEMALE:You lucked out.
OTHERFEMALE:You get to spend an evening with me.
SUPMALE:What do you want to do? I think I'll go to bed early.
LEADMALE:Hey, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want to play all star baseball? Nah.
OTHERMALE:Clue? Nah.
SUPMALE:Want me to shave your head? Nah.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you're babysitting me tonight.
LEADMALE:You're responsible for my entertainment.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADMALE:I was saving it for later, but here you go.
LEADFEMALE:"Your personal guide to tax-free municipal bonds"? Enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:So, how are you two getting along? Fine.
LEADMALE:Crummy.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:excitement over here doesn't want to do anything with me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, he'll come around, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you were supposed to sit for me tonight.
LEADFEMALE:It's not gonna be fun with him.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Jen, you can do the same things with Alex that you and I would have done.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? We were supposed to put makeup on each other tonight, remember? No way.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Neil.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on? Oh, tonight? Oh, no, I can't tonight.
OTHERMALE:I'm babysitting my little Really? Uh No, tonight's not good for me.
LEADMALE:Whoa, that's tempting.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, maybe I could Alex.
LEADMALE:Alex.
SUPFEMALE:At the moment, I'd say it's about 50-50.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get back to you.
OTHERMALE:What was it? Another party? No.
LEADMALE:No, not at all.
LEADMALE:It was just a group of fellow young men getting together to chat about world events.
LEADFEMALE:A poker game.
SUPFEMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:And Chuck the fish is gonna be there.
OTHERMALE:He never wins.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mallory, what do you say? How can I get you to stay home tonight? You couldn't.
LEADMALE:We switched tonight, and a deal's a deal.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Alex.
OTHERMALE:So, Jeff.
SUPMALE:You're really going out with Mallory tonight, huh? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Boy, I admire your courage.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? Well, I just wouldn't drive on a night like tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Well, you really want to drive in this weather, Jeff? It's a beautiful night.
LEADMALE:Those are the most dangerous times to drive.
OTHERMALE:All of the people who are afraid to drive in the rain are out there.
LEADMALE:Forget it, Alex.
LEADMALE:We're going.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Maybe he's right.
LEADMALE:I mean Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jen.
SUPFEMALE:I'm real sorry I switched with Alex tonight, but you understand, don't you? Not exactly.
SUPMALE:But I'm sure I will right after puberty.
OTHERMALE:Well, see you later.
LEADFEMALE:You guys have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:So What do you want to do? You want to play cinderella? I seriously doubt it.
SUPFEMALE:Hear me out.
SUPFEMALE:One of us gets dressed up like cinderella, and one of us gets dressed up like the prince.
OTHERMALE:And then we go and see if mom's slippers fit me.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds exciting, but I think I'll pass.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer Let me explain to you the importance of poker in a man's life.
SUPMALE:Alex, you're not going to the game.
SUPMALE:In this industrialized society of ours, there aren't many battles for a man to fight.
LEADFEMALE:There aren't many opportunities to go one-on-one with another man.
SUPMALE:There aren't many tests of one's courage and stamina.
SUPMALE:You know what I mean? Do you want to get mom's slippers, or should I? I've got a better idea.
SUPMALE:Get your coat.
LEADMALE:Alex, you're not throwing me out in the street, are you? I saw "Nicholas nickleby.
LEADMALE:" I know what can happen to kids out there.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jennifer, relax.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to the poker game with me.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be fun.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm not going.
SUPFEMALE:You have no choice.
LEADMALE:Then I'm going.
SUPMALE:I'm just gonna write a note to mom and dad in case they come home early.
LEADMALE:I don't want them to worry about you.
LEADFEMALE:Why would they worry? I'm obviously in good hands.
LEADFEMALE:Kings bet 20 cents.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm in.
LEADMALE:I'm in.
SUPMALE:What are you nuts? Hey.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, knock it off.
SUPMALE:Then let me play.
LEADMALE:I'm bored.
OTHERFEMALE:And you promised I could.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, listen up, guys.
OTHERMALE:Uh, is it all right if my sister plays one hand with us? I dragged her here.
OTHERFEMALE:She's tired.
LEADFEMALE:She's cranky.
LEADMALE:And I think playing just the one hand will mean a lot to her.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I tried, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Doug, it's 45 to you.
LEADFEMALE:I fold.
OTHERMALE:Alex! Jennifer, the guys don't want you to play.
SUPMALE:There's nothing I can do about it.
SUPFEMALE:Neil, do you have any toys she could play with? Toys? Yeah, you know, uh Model cars, a doll, some silly putty.
LEADMALE:I got a toaster.
SUPMALE:Jennifer Neil says you can play with his toaster.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:If he had some bread, it'd be really fun.
LEADMALE:Don't stick a fork in there, kid.
SUPFEMALE:You don't own any forks.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:This isn't a restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't an apartment, either.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, call.
LEADMALE:Your bet, Arnie.
LEADMALE:I call.
SUPFEMALE:I think he's got another king under there.
LEADMALE:He's bluffing.
LEADMALE:Jennifer! Sorry.
SUPMALE:Why don't you, uh, go lie down somewhere? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Toledo.
OTHERFEMALE:You sure know how to make a person feel at home.

LEADMALE:We went to Neil's house.
LEADFEMALE:" So, uh, nobody else is home, then.
OTHERFEMALE:Nope, just you and me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should leave.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
SUPMALE:Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I made her do it, Alex! I'm an animal! I don't deserve to live! Where's Jennifer? I thought she was with you.
LEADMALE:I got caught up in the moment! I couldn't control myself! Jeff I'm not usually like this, but when I'm around Mallory, I go crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Jeff, calm down! We've got other problems here.
LEADFEMALE:I lost Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you took her to the card game with you.
SUPMALE:I-I did, but while I was playing, she just Wandered off.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Mom and dad came to the card game to get her.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:They're right behind me.
LEADMALE:I had to drive on the sidewalk to beat them home.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe Jennifer came home, and she's upstairs sleeping.
LEADMALE:I hope you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll look.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I kind of told my parents that, uh, Jennifer was with you.
LEADMALE:So I'd appreciate it, if you'd Lie.
LEADMALE:That about says it, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, Alex, if you want me to.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, if Jennifer's not home, maybe you and I should go look for her.
LEADMALE:We've both got cars.
LEADMALE:Good idea.
LEADMALE:Jeff, thank you for your support.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad you're here.
OTHERFEMALE:Not at all.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you're certainly not the two I expected to see on the couch.
LEADMALE:Where's Mallory? She went upstairs to check on Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Everything okay with Jen? Yeah, everything's just fine.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, I think I'll go, uh, tuck her in.

LEADFEMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:He is great! Wait a minute I thought when you left, that dad was for him and you were against him.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? We heard him speak.
LEADFEMALE:We heard him speak.

OTHERMALE:Well, his battery is a little low.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna follow behind in case he gets into trouble.

OTHERMALE:Oh, no, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I'm pretty tired.

LEADFEMALE:I think I'll go up to bed.
LEADMALE:Oh, me too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wait.
LEADMALE:What is it? Uh, nothing.
LEADMALE:I-I was just hoping we we could talk before you went upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:I'm awfully tired, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Can it wait till tomorrow? I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted to talk about boys and sex.
LEADFEMALE:And then, the young kangaroo suckling lives lives in its mother's pouch for many months, until it's able to venture out on its own.
LEADMALE:Uh, I think Mallory knows all that, Steven, and she wants to talk about men and women.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, mom.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPMALE:I think I'd understand it better if we start from the beginning.
LEADFEMALE:So daddy kangaroos don't have pouches? Mm-hmm.
OTHERMALE:Alex, where have you been? You've been gone almost an hour.
SUPMALE:Did Jeff have car trouble? Uh, yes.
LEADMALE:Yes, he did, as a matter of fact.
LEADMALE:Um, has Jennifer woken up yet? Not yet.
LEADFEMALE:Why should Jennifer wake up? Alex, is anything wrong? Uh, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, it's kind of a long story.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I didn't want to play cinderella all night, and dress up in your clothes, mom.
LEADFEMALE:And you know how shy Jeff is.
LEADFEMALE:I got the call about the card game.
SUPFEMALE:Chuck has not won a pot in three years.
SUPMALE:They offered her the toaster.

OTHERMALE:Just a little tired.
LEADFEMALE:Where have you been? I was worried sick about you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, I'll bet.
LEADMALE:Where were you? I took the bus.
OTHERMALE:I was with someone lonelier than me the bus driver.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, he's coming over next Thursday night for dinner.
SUPFEMALE:That's okay, Sam.
SUPMALE:You can go now.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, you cannot just walk away like that.
SUPFEMALE:We were scared to death.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I just got sick of being in the way.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, honey, you've never been in the way.
OTHERMALE:Alex and Mallory won't get off so easy.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be too hard on them, dad.
LEADMALE:I'm just a little sister.
LEADMALE:Why should I expect anybody to want to spend time with me? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Mom said you'd see us now.
SUPMALE:Can we come in? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Guess you want me to leave, then.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Why would we want you to leave? Well, you never seem to want me around, lately.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:That's not true.
SUPFEMALE:It isn't, huh? Is that why you dumped me for Jeff? Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mallory didn't At least she dumped me for a nice guy, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You dumped me for a group of winos.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Alex.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Whose side are you on? On the other hand, Mallory, you hurt me even more.
SUPMALE:I don't expect anything from Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mallory Wait wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean you don't expect anything of me? Are you saying that I neglected you? Alex, the only time you talk to me is when you want me to leave the room, or you need some money.
LEADMALE:Hey, how can you say that? Remember, this morning, I talked to you.
SUPMALE:I talked to you.
SUPFEMALE:I passed you in the hall.
LEADMALE:I said, uh, "hey, how you doing?" I'm touched.
LEADMALE:Look, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if it'll make you feel any better, but we're grounded.
LEADMALE:For how long? Let's put it this way.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll be driving before we will.
LEADMALE:Look, I don't know why you guys are here.
LEADMALE:You don't care about me.
SUPMALE:It's always, "you're too young for this, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:" Or, "we can't go because of you, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:" I'm not a person.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a little sister.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, we don't really treat you like that.
SUPMALE:Yes, you do.
SUPFEMALE:You guys are always so busy.
SUPFEMALE:You never have time for me.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you're busy with your work, your clubs, your school.
OTHERMALE:Mallory, you're busy with your boys and What else do you do? It's just because we're older, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:When you get to be our age, you'll be busy, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never be your age.
SUPMALE:I'll always be younger.
LEADMALE:No matter what I do, you guys will always get to do it first.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's true, Jennifer, but there are a lot of advantages to being the youngest.
SUPFEMALE:Like what? Well, for one thing, Mallory and I have worn mom and dad down.
SUPFEMALE:We've broken them in.
OTHERMALE:We've trained them.
SUPFEMALE:By the time you get to be our age, you'll be running this place.
SUPMALE:That is something to look forward to, but what am I supposed to do between now and then? We'll try and make it more fun for you, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Will you guys let me get in trouble with you more often? Sure we will.
LEADMALE:Will you take all the blame when we do? We always do.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:That's my favorite part of being a little sister.
SUPMALE:You know, Jennifer, uh, when we didn't know where you were, we were really worried about you.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean it? There was a moment there when I realized what it would be like, uh, if you weren't around, and I didn't like the idea.
OTHERFEMALE:For one thing, I'd be stuck here alone with Mallory.
LEADMALE:We love you, Jennifer.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes we forget to say it, but we do.
LEADFEMALE:You too, Alex? Me too.
OTHERFEMALE:Just want to count heads.
SUPMALE:One, two, three.
SUPMALE:All present and accounted for.
LEADFEMALE:Next count will be at 0100 hours.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to do that anymore, dad.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna run away again.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We'll keep her happy.
LEADMALE:We'll make sure she gets out every now and then.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll feed her, keep her clean.
SUPMALE:No child could ask for more.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, at least now we're aware of how Jennifer feels.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe something good has come out of tonight, after all.
LEADFEMALE:That's true.
LEADMALE:Today has been a very positive experience.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, things we've learned Can it, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:You're still in big trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, I know you feel that sometimes you get lost in the shuffle.
LEADMALE:And that's wrong.
LEADMALE:We should watch out for that.
SUPMALE:But even if that happens, please remember that we love you.
SUPMALE:We don't mean to take you for granted.
LEADMALE:If I've taken anyone here for granted in the past six months, I apologize.
OTHERMALE: I accept.
LEADMALE:And and, hey, I'm not totally blameless here.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be so rough on yourself, Alex.
OTHERMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I-i mean it.
LEADMALE:I mean, sometimes I'm not as sensitive to all of you as I could be.
LEADFEMALE:No! No! No! And and sometimes I'm a little too self-centered.
SUPMALE:No! No! No! Well, I'm glad I got that off my chest.
LEADFEMALE:It was a real catharsis, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I'm drained.
OTHERMALE:Well, come on, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:What do you want to do tonight? You name it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm your guy.
OTHERMALE:Do you want to play all star baseball? Nope.
SUPMALE:Clue? Nope.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want to do? You know what I want to play.
OTHERMALE:I'll go get mommy's slippers.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:okay, Jennifer, ask me one from the geometry category.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm tired of doing this.
LEADFEMALE:I need a break.
LEADMALE:Aw, come on, Jennifer! You can't let me down now.
OTHERFEMALE:You've helped me through the first four rounds of the high school quiz-off.
LEADFEMALE:The championships are only three days away.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be on television.
SUPFEMALE:I've got to be prepared.
LEADMALE:Now, come on, just one more.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you're violating child-labor laws.
SUPFEMALE:Please! I love it when you beg.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, clear those books off the table.
LEADMALE:We've got to get dinner going.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, mom, I really don't want to break my concentration.
LEADMALE:Why don't you guys go out for dinner? Here's a couple of bucks.
SUPMALE:Alex! Sorry, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just excited about the quiz-off, that's all.
SUPMALE:Oh, me too.
LEADMALE:In fact, this morning, I dropped off my plans for the set at the station.
LEADFEMALE:How did daddy like them? Well, he didn't have a chance to see them yet, but I know he's gonna love my ideas.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, Jennifer, hit me with a literature question, please.
LEADMALE:Okay, but this is the last one.
SUPFEMALE:In act five, scene five, of "MacBeth," MacBeth reflects on the nature of life.
LEADFEMALE:Quote the passage exactly.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:That's a tough one.
SUPFEMALE:G-give me a second.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi, gang.
LEADMALE:Hi, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dad.
LEADMALE:Hey, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:How you doing today? "Life's but a walking shadow.
SUPMALE:"A poor player that struts "and frets his hour upon the stage, "and then is heard no more.
SUPFEMALE:"It is a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
LEADMALE:" He seems a little depressed.
OTHERMALE:He's practicing for the tournament finals.
OTHERMALE:So, what did you think of my set designs? Well, um I-it's a little elaborate, isn't it? I was thinking more along the lines of the kind of set we used last year.
LEADFEMALE:Well, last year's set was so dull.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe.
LEADFEMALE:I it I-I-it's hard for me to talk about the plans without having them in front of me.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad I left them at the office.
OTHERMALE:Good luck.
LEADMALE:I happen to have an extra copy right here.
LEADMALE:What a break.
LEADMALE:Uh, I'll I'll get that.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Uh, just a second.
SUPMALE:Alex, it's for you.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Ted.
LEADMALE:What? What do you mean you can't make it Sunday? So what?! I-it's not even life-threatening until it gets up to 105.
LEADFEMALE:You can make it, Ted.
LEADFEMALE:Come on! Ted! Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.
SUPMALE:No, I didn't mean to excite him.
SUPMALE:Listen, if Ted regains consciousness, could you have him Hello? Great! Just great! Ted Quinn can't make the finals on Sunday.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Some gibberish about infectious pneumonia.
SUPFEMALE:And now our team is a man short.
SUPMALE:What about your friend, Susan aronson? She's very bright.
LEADMALE:No good, dad.
LEADFEMALE:She's in the 11th grade.
OTHERFEMALE:Each team must consist of one player from the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades.
LEADFEMALE:Where am I gonna find an incredibly bright, informed, quick-thinking 10th grader by Sunday? Alex? I know we don't usually get along, but it hurts me to see you in a desperate situation like this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in 10th grade.
LEADFEMALE:I'm willing to be on your team.
LEADMALE:Maybe if we set Ted up in a glass booth, he wouldn't infect anyone.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Alex, I'd be good! You? Yes, her! Alex, what is this? Do you think you're the only one in this house who's interested in academic challenge? Yeah, I love academic challenges.
OTHERMALE:Besides, it's gonna be on television! There's an exchange student from Brazil who's pretty bright.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, by any chance, could you ask some of the questions in Portuguese? I'll adapt.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Petey, one more question.
OTHERFEMALE:Grover Cleveland was elected to the presidency twice, in 1884 and again in 1892.
SUPFEMALE:Who was Cleveland's secretary of the treasury, during his second term? Uh, petey, I don't I don't think this is gonna work out.
LEADMALE:I mean, let's face it, most of the questions are gonna be in English.
LEADMALE:Nice try, pal.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, quÃ© serÃ¡, serÃ¡.
OTHERMALE:Ciao.
SUPMALE:Ciao.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer! Yes? Bring in the next guy, please.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, he was the last one, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, he can't be.
LEADMALE:There's got to be at least one qualified kid in the 10th grade.
LEADMALE:There are plenty of smart kids, but none of them wanted to be on the team with you.
SUPMALE:I can't understand that.
LEADFEMALE:I merely asked them to comply with a few simple rules.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you wanted them to salute you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the captain of the team, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:These kids have got to learn to respect authority.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what are you gonna do now? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I got to think.
SUPMALE:Hey, I'm sorry, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, I've been revising these plans all day.
LEADFEMALE:Now, why are you so resistant to my ideas? I'm not resistant to your ideas, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:But I just don't think theater in the round is what we want to do here.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying you don't like it? I-I'm not saying that.
LEADMALE:You do like it? I'm not saying that.
SUPFEMALE:I'm saying this is a high-school quiz show, not "my fair lady.
OTHERMALE:" "My fair lady"! That's it! The quiz will be like "my fair lady"! Well, we've got the set for it.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:What I've got to do is find my Eliza Doolittle.
LEADMALE:A 10th grader who knows virtually nothing about anything.
OTHERFEMALE:An empty vessel that I can fill with my knowledge, my insight, my wisdom.
LEADFEMALE:Someone whose mind is a total blank.
SUPMALE:A clean slate.
OTHERMALE:Mom! Could you help me in the kitchen? I'm trying to make a snack.
SUPMALE:I forgot how the blender works.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Let's turn to the next question.
LEADMALE:Alex, we've been doing this for hours.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting tired! She needs her rest.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, I don't think you fully appreciate what an enormous task I've undertaken here.
OTHERMALE:I'm taking a simple peasant girl whose greatest prior achievement was coordinating her eye shadow with her sweater, and I'm turning her into someone Someone who could have a conversation with me.
SUPMALE:You're gonna have to give her more incentive than that, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, let's just get this over with.
LEADMALE:You're getting a little too pompous, even for you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, we went over this one yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:It's a geography question.
LEADFEMALE:At the Southern tip of Chile lies a body of water named for a famous explorer.
LEADFEMALE:Name this body of water.
SUPMALE:Uh, a body of water, right? Named for the famous explorer.
LEADMALE:Come on, now.
LEADFEMALE:Southern tip of Chile? The Hudson river.
OTHERMALE:Aw! That's not right? No, it's the straits of Magellan! Oh! You guys are still at it? It's so late.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm glad you're here.
SUPFEMALE:We need your help with another dry run.
LEADFEMALE:We've had five dry runs in the last two days, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Just one more.
SUPMALE:We're at a turning point here.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory actually named all the cabinet members.
OTHERFEMALE:That was me, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
SUPFEMALE:We need to work.
LEADFEMALE:Please, mom, dad, do it for Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe for a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Okay, Elyse, and uh, Jennifer, sit over there, representing one team.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory and Alex sit here.
SUPMALE:And I'll stand here.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, maybe you should stand on the chair, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because according to my revised, revised plan, the moderator's podium is elevated.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, look, I'm not quite sure we're going to be doing it that way, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Well, there are a variety of factors involved.
LEADFEMALE:Could you guys discuss this later, please? I mean, it's getting late.
LEADFEMALE:It's very important that Mallory get some sense of what the actual tournament will be like.
LEADMALE:Okay? Dad, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:First question, in the area of mythology.
OTHERFEMALE: Mythology.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:You're good at this.
OTHERMALE:Remember, I showed you the pictures? The guy with the wings on his feet? I remember.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Who was romulus' twin brother? I don't know that one, mom.
SUPMALE:Do you? Yes.
SUPMALE:Would you like to share it with us? I'm not answering.
SUPMALE:I have designed six perfectly good sets for this show, and I don't understand why your father refuses to use any of them.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I thought you were going to design a very simple set.
LEADMALE:Most of our viewers will not have 3-d glasses.
OTHERMALE:Mom, mom.
SUPMALE:Dad! Please.
OTHERMALE:We're on television here.
SUPFEMALE:The question now goes over to Harding high.
SUPMALE:Who was romulus' twin brother? Uh, uncle Remus.
SUPFEMALE:Not uncle Remus.
SUPFEMALE:Just Remus.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'll bet he was somebody's uncle.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, if romulus had kids, then Remus would be an uncle, wouldn't he? I suppose he would have, yes.
LEADFEMALE:All right, then he was uncle Remus.
SUPMALE:Maybe we practiced enough for one day.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I have some other plans we can look over, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, actually, you can never practice too much.
LEADFEMALE:Steven! Uh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Now, how about interlocking plexiglas platforms? They can be powered hydraulically.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we'll talk plexiglas.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mallory, let's drill a little more.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm tired.
OTHERFEMALE:Just a couple more questions.
LEADMALE:Now What do the letters in the acronym "scuba" stand for? Well, it's kind of like skin-diving, isn't it? Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what do the letters stand for? We've gone over this before.
LEADFEMALE:Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus.
OTHERMALE:What did you say? Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus.
SUPFEMALE:Again? Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus! By George, she's got it! 
SUPMALE:Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus! And who invented it? Magellan! 
LEADFEMALE:Five minutes to air, everybody! Hi! Hi! You're on one of the teams, aren't you? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:The Harding team.
OTHERMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
OTHERMALE:Ha ha.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Uh, we're the guys who won the tournament last year.
SUPFEMALE:Really? How exciting.
SUPFEMALE:This year, we're the judges.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.

LEADFEMALE:Spanish inquisition.
SUPFEMALE:Pope sixtus iv Alex, see what you're doing? I'm sorry, mom.

OTHERFEMALE:You've got to slow down.
LEADMALE:Mom! Dad needs your help.
LEADFEMALE:Those St.
LEADMALE:Mary's girls really have him on the ropes.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I will deal with this mother to mother.
LEADMALE:You don't look so good, Alex.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I've been comatose for the past two hours.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't have a chance to freshen up.
LEADMALE:C-can I talk to you for a second? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:O-on a scale of 1 to 10, how obnoxious have I been to you? Alex, I'm tired of quizzes.
LEADFEMALE:Just talk to me in normal sentences for a change, okay? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I guess this has been a pretty rough week for you, huh? Uh, it's good training.
SUPFEMALE:If I ever have to stand up for questioning by the secret police, I'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:I-I was only doing it because I wanted our team to win the contest.
SUPMALE:You know, Alex, sometimes I worry about you.
LEADFEMALE:You take everything so seriously.
LEADFEMALE:You got to learn to relax more.
LEADMALE:Have you ever thought of spending a few weeks at a dude ranch? Not really.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't you just kick me or something, every time I get out of hand? Every time? There wouldn't be enough places to kick.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Eh.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go home.
SUPMALE:Oh, this has been one of the worst days of my life.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Why are you smiling? I knew the answers, Alex.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'm smarter than I thought.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe so.
SUPMALE:What was the fifth amendment to the U.
SUPMALE:S.
LEADFEMALE:constitution? I'd answer that, but I have the right to remain silent.
SUPMALE:Not bad.
LEADMALE:Not bad.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:now, bernice, you have a list of all the councilmen who are in our corner and have come out against the construction of the high-rise, right? Right.
SUPFEMALE:And, Phyllis, you have a list of all those who are on the fence? - Right.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I have a list of all the pizza parlors in the neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:I say we eat.
LEADFEMALE:I'm starving.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, this re-zoning bill's got to be stopped.
LEADMALE:If it passes, all the recreational land in town will be turned into condominiums.
LEADMALE:Do you have a copy of the bill? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Right here.
LEADMALE:You know, one thing in our favor is the opposition is incredibly disorganized.
LEADFEMALE:They're sloppy, unprepared, confused Can't seem to find it.
LEADFEMALE:I know, it's in my brown purse.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:I'll look upstairs.
LEADMALE:Just a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know why you're fighting me on this, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:It just doesn't sound right.
SUPFEMALE:That's all.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, let me try and explain it to you again.
LEADFEMALE:You're what's called a consumer.
SUPFEMALE:You buy gum, candy, a pair of wax lips every now and then.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, you need money for all this, right? But I get an allowance.
SUPFEMALE:That's true, but don't you remember? Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been hard hit by inflationary pressures.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:Now, I am willing to supplement your income by 25 cents a week, in exchange for a service.
LEADMALE:I mean, what could be more reasonable? Alex, I don't want to clean your room.
LEADMALE:Why don't you clean your own room? I could do that, Mallory, but that'd be the easy way out.
OTHERFEMALE:By paying Jennifer to do it, I'm allowing her to participate in the American free-enterprise system.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do it for me, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Do it for America.
LEADMALE:You have no shame at all.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, kids.
OTHERMALE:Where's your mother? Uh, in the living room.
SUPFEMALE:What's the occasion? Kids, your father just won the midwest regional Murray award for outstanding pbs documentary.
LEADMALE:Yay! - Yay! Which documentary was this for, dad? Uh, the last one in our wildlife series, "the egret's regret.
LEADFEMALE:" I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:That documentary was so obviously biased, so slanted.
LEADMALE:You did the whole thing from the egret's point of view.
SUPMALE:Alex, your views on this subject are well-known.
LEADMALE:We got your letter down at the station.
LEADMALE:Personally, I thought "bleeding-heart bird-lovers" was a bit strong.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, be real quiet.
LEADMALE:I want to surprise her.
LEADMALE:But, dad - Shh! And now, the winner of the Murray award for outstanding locally produced public-television documentary.
OTHERFEMALE:May I have the envelope, please? The winner is Steven Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Is, um Elyse Keaton here? Steven! Elyse.
OTHERMALE:I won the Murray award for "the egret's regret"! Oh, Steven, that's wonderful! I know how hard you worked to get that on! Oh, I am so proud of you! I'm happy! I'm excited! - Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I'm coming! I was hoping we could celebrate tonight.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:I can't.
OTHERMALE:Any chance you'll be done soon? Well, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:We have to write up the petition and coordinate the canvassing teams, uh, name the group leaders, and then make about 20 phone calls.
LEADMALE:I think soon's a little optimistic.
LEADFEMALE:I think June's a little optimistic.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we can celebrate tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:It's no big deal.
SUPMALE:I just wanted some of your time.
LEADMALE:We got the show on the air.
LEADFEMALE:That's what counts.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:We can celebrate any time.
SUPMALE:Oh, we will, too.
LEADFEMALE:What's an award, really? Silly way to encourage competition.
LEADMALE:I'd like to thank my parents, of course, and my first scout leader.
LEADMALE:That's right, guido.
SUPMALE:The table by the picture window, tonight at 6:30.
SUPMALE:Oh, and guido, it's a special occasion, so a bottle of your best champagne.
LEADFEMALE:I won the Murray award.
LEADMALE:"The egret's regret.
SUPMALE:" I don't know.
LEADMALE:I thought we showed both sides.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:See you tonight.
SUPMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry you weren't awake when I came up last night.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:What would you say if I told you that I was able to wangle us the table by the window at guido's tonight at 6:30 for our Murray award celebration? Oh! I only have one problem with that.
LEADMALE:I can't make it.
LEADFEMALE:That's a tough thing to overlook.
LEADMALE:Well, I have a late meeting at work tonight.
SUPFEMALE:I have to do some drawings for a new building, and we're bidding on the project tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Let me call guido right back, see if he can take us any later.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Mallory says I can't go with you and her tonight.
LEADMALE:Tonight? Where are we going? It's our first mother/daughter yoga class tonight, and she can't come.
LEADMALE:Why not? She's a mother.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a daughter.
SUPFEMALE:I say we're in business.
SUPFEMALE:You don't even know what yoga is.
LEADFEMALE:So what? I didn't know what sex was, and I went to sex-education class, didn't I? Well, this is different.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I hope so.
SUPMALE:That was really boring.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Your dad and I have plans.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, you promised.
OTHERMALE:Let me talk to him.
SUPMALE:Well, i-it took some doing, but we're in at 7:30.
LEADFEMALE:We don't have the window table Is there a chance we can do it any later? Elyse, you kill me sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:I-i completely forgot about this yoga class the girls and i signed up for.
LEADFEMALE:It's at 7:00 tonight.
SUPFEMALE:And we can't miss the first class.
LEADFEMALE:They teach you how to breathe.
LEADFEMALE:You already know how to breathe.
LEADFEMALE:Inhale, exhale, keep alternating.
LEADFEMALE:You won't have any problem.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, please, daddy, can we go? Please, can we? Can we? Please? Oh, okay.
SUPMALE:They love it when you beg.
OTHERMALE:I'll call guido and try to change the reservation.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, there's a call for you on the other line.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you, honey.
OTHERMALE:Okay, Jennifer, I'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:I've been thinking it over, and I'm willing to raise the base pay for cleaning my room to 75 cents a week.
SUPMALE:A quarter you see up front, the rest I put in a trust fund for you.
SUPFEMALE:When do I get the money? When you're 18.
OTHERFEMALE:Forget it.
SUPMALE:By then, I'll be too old to enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:Guido Take it easy.
SUPFEMALE:I think we can discuss this as two intelligent adults.
LEADMALE:What I'm trying to tell you is that any table will do.
LEADFEMALE:N-now, come on, i don't mean any table.
LEADFEMALE:Won't the cash register get in the way? Oh, n-never mind, I'll take it.
SUPFEMALE:See you at 9:15.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Just got a call from Cathy speering.
LEADFEMALE:She needs to see me tonight.
LEADMALE:Tonight our tonight? She's a member of my women's support group, and we made a commitment to be available to one another.
LEADFEMALE:We made a commitment, too, Elyse, remember? People threw rice.
LEADFEMALE:You wore a white dress.
LEADMALE:Do the words "for better or for worse" ring a bell? They're about to have a fight.
LEADMALE:Is it over daddy's Murphy award? It's not a Murphy award.
LEADMALE:It's a Murray.
SUPFEMALE:And we are not about to have a fight.
SUPMALE:I simply want to take your mother out to dinner to celebrate, and some conflicts have arisen due to your mother being somewhat overcommitted lately, and we're trying to resolve them.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all.
SUPMALE:Isn't that right Dear? That's right Sweetheart Although your father has neglected to mention that all of this has happened at an unusually hectic period for me.
LEADMALE:But I am sure he's mature enough to realize that although I'm doing everything humanly possible to be flexible, outside commitments must be fulfilled.
LEADMALE:It's a fight.
SUPMALE:We got to get to school.
LEADMALE:Tell us who wins.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, sweetheart, but Cathy sounded really upset.
SUPFEMALE:She's afraid her husband's gonna leave her for another woman.
OTHERFEMALE:What gives her that idea? He hasn't been home for dinner in eight months.
LEADFEMALE:So maybe he's on a diet.
OTHERFEMALE:Couldn't you tell her you were busy tonight, that we had special plans? That you wanted to spend the evening with your husband? Look, I don't think she should be alone tonight.
LEADFEMALE:She's called me in her hour of need, and I just don't feel like I can turn my back on her.
LEADMALE:Well, when you put it like that, it's pretty tough to say no.
LEADMALE:Okay, look.
LEADFEMALE:You do what you have to do.
LEADMALE:Go over there tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make a special dinner here, and we'll celebrate the minute you get home.
LEADMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:You're terrific.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:He-e-e-y, guido.
OTHERFEMALE:Good evening.
LEADFEMALE:Or should I say good morning? I didn't realize it was so late.
LEADFEMALE:Things got kind of heavy with Cathy.
SUPMALE:Hope I didn't cause any problems.
LEADFEMALE:Nah.
LEADFEMALE:The recipe specifically says "allow veal to sit six hours before serving.
SUPMALE:" Should be just about ready.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I just couldn't leave Cathy.
LEADMALE:Well, are you home to stay now, or is this just a pit stop? Of course.
OTHERMALE:Where would I be going now? - I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm sure there's someone in trouble somewhere in the world.
SUPFEMALE:It's 8:00 A.
LEADMALE:M.
SUPFEMALE:in London.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps some English woman is completely out of tea.
SUPMALE:Look, I know i said I'd be home early, but tonight was an emergency.
LEADMALE:It's always an emergency, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:It's not just tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't spent 20 consecutive minutes with you all week.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I know I've been spreading myself a little thin lately, but you know how I am once I make a commitment.
SUPMALE:And I think you could be a little more flexible! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, ah, I see.
LEADMALE:Yeah, my fault.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not flexible enough.
SUPMALE:Maybe if I were an undocumented alien with an overbite, or if they were planning to re-zone our bedroom, I would be able to get a little of your time.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:I'm not in the mood for a fight tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Not in the mood to fight? Not in the mood? Wait, I'll put on the theme from "rocky.
OTHERMALE:" Why do we have to fight now?! Because the odds are, when you are in the mood, you won't be here! Steven, it just so happens there have been a lot of demands put on me lately.
LEADMALE:I've got this big presentation at work I've got to prepare, and it's put me under a lot of pressure.
LEADFEMALE:Then this re-zoning thing came to a head, and then Cathy called, and i felt a little obligation to her.
SUPMALE:But, hey, if I've been neglecting my better half, well, excuse me! I'm sorry I wasn't here to celebrate with you, but if you want to celebrate right now, hey, I'm all for it! Get out the hats! Get out the streamers! Get out your Murray! Let's celebrate! Just the two of us? Won't that be a little lonely for you? What would you suggest? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Let's call amnesty international.
LEADMALE:They've got a lot of guys with time on their hands.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure they can round up a fun crowd for us.
LEADMALE:Steven, that's it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go sleep in the other room.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, you don't.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of things may have changed, but it's always been the man's prerogative to sleep in the other room! Be my guest! I will! Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Steven? You know that pact we have Always resolve all our differences before we go to sleep, never go to bed angry? Oh, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's off.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys better get going.
SUPFEMALE:Dad's gonna be here any minute.
SUPMALE:I don't get it, mom.
SUPMALE:Why do we have to leave because you and daddy had a fight? You don't have to leave because we had a fight.
LEADMALE:You have to leave because we want to make up.
OTHERMALE:Daddy's gonna be really upset when he finds out it's just you and him tonight.
LEADMALE:You want to bet? - Table's all set, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you, love.
LEADMALE:This is a funny way of being mad at someone, isn't it? Making him a special dinner? Well, you see, your dad and I had a little misunderstanding last night, and we both said some things that I hope he's sorry for.
LEADMALE:And tonight, we're just gonna celebrate his award with a nice, quiet evening at home.
LEADMALE:Nice, quiet evening at home, huh? Is that why you're wearing "ravage me" perfume? I said quiet, not boring.
SUPMALE:Ahh.
LEADMALE:Hello, Steven.
LEADMALE:Welcome home.
LEADMALE:Hi, mal.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:Hi, Jenny.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's time we made up.
SUPFEMALE:I may not be ready.
SUPFEMALE:But after our, uh, discussion last night, i-i was thinking, and I was very tired and on edge, and I'm sorry that some things were said.
LEADFEMALE:And I'd like to make it up to you with a special dinner, just the two of us.
SUPFEMALE:Just the two of us? Yes.
LEADMALE:I told mom you would be mad.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know, you weren't the only one who said some things.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, too.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean you're ready to make up? Sure, what the hell.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm easy.
SUPMALE:He doesn't look mad.
LEADFEMALE:He's covering.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm going to go up and slip into something irresistible.
LEADFEMALE:Stay out of my closet! Okay, now, Alex, you're gonna take Jennifer to Chrissy's and Mallory to Susan's and you're going to Peter's, and you'll be back here at 9:30, right? - Right, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good time.
LEADMALE:You have a good time too, mom, uh, within bounds.
LEADFEMALE:What are bounds? Phyllis! Hi, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Sorry to barge in like this, -but we just found out from ed Phillips - Why are you here? That the opposition is gonna try to sneak through the zoning bill tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Our only chance to save it is to call all the councilmen tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight? Why does it have to be tonight? Well, we haven't much time.
SUPMALE:They've scheduled the session for 9:00 tomorrow morning.
LEADMALE:Oh, you've got plans.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't even notice.
SUPMALE:Look at you.
SUPFEMALE:You're all dressed, and That's "ravage me," isn't it? Yes, well, actually, Steven and I had a special dinner planned.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, that is powerful stuff, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think you'll make it to dessert.
OTHERMALE:W-well, hey, I'm really sorry that I can't help you, but this has been put off, and Let me help you with this stuff.
SUPMALE:Elyse, which goes better with this jacket, the dark brown or the gray? Is Elyse Keaton here? Hi, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on? They moved up the re-zoning vote on us.
LEADMALE:It's tomorrow.
LEADMALE:So? So, it's important we take action tonight.
OTHERMALE:Elyse, it's important we take action tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, i-i know.
LEADFEMALE:You see, it's okay.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's gonna be moved over to bernice's house, and they're gonna work there.
SUPMALE:We'll be out of here in a second.
LEADMALE:If we can carry all this stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:I have complete confidence in you.
LEADFEMALE:It's really raining out there.
LEADFEMALE:Come on! Don't be such a marshmallow! A little rain never hurt anyone.
LEADMALE:It's good for the crops.
SUPMALE:We're not carrying crops.
LEADMALE:Ahh, it's just a sun shower.
LEADMALE:Steven, we can't send them out in rain like that.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Uh, ladies, there's an inflatable raft in the garage.
SUPMALE:Steven! All right, all right, all right, all right! Ladies, ladies, stop.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Stop.
LEADFEMALE:All right, uh, look, ladies.

LEADMALE:Uh, we can't find the coffee, either.
OTHERMALE:Second cupboard to the right, red bag.
OTHERMALE:Isn't this romantic? It could be.
LEADMALE:Elyse Let's face it.
SUPMALE:This isn't working.
SUPMALE:Of course it's working, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Just relax.
LEADMALE:Let's talk about your award.
SUPFEMALE:I really don't want to talk about the Murray.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to have a nice, romantic dinner with you.
LEADFEMALE:Coming through! I forgot to ask who wanted decaf, who wanted regular.
SUPFEMALE:Still think it's working, Elyse? I'm not saying there are no bugs in the system, but let's make the best of it.
LEADMALE:Two decaf, four regular.
OTHERFEMALE:That is a surprise, huh? I mean, you would think that more people would want decaf.
SUPFEMALE:It just goes to show you.
LEADMALE:You never know.
SUPFEMALE:Go on with what you were saying.
LEADMALE:Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Not being able to spend time with you these past few days No! No trouble at all! Don't be silly.
LEADMALE:None.
LEADMALE:Go.
OTHERFEMALE:Look.
OTHERFEMALE:The fight we had last night reminded me how much you mean to me.
OTHERFEMALE:It's made me understand that we have to take better care of us, of our relationship.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes the world is too much with us, and we forget the really essential things.
LEADFEMALE:But But some things never change.
LEADMALE:And no matter how much time goes by.
LEADMALE:we must remember this a kiss is just a ki Excuse me.
LEADMALE:I-i didn't mean to interrupt.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that we are two votes short of defeating the bill.
SUPFEMALE:Can you think of any other councilmen that might be swayed? Uh, m-Max Try Max blumenthal.
SUPFEMALE:Blumenthal.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:a sigh is still a sigh I'm sorry, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:All I'm trying to say is that you're very important to me.
SUPMALE:Last night, alone in the guest room, i-it felt so strange not having you next to me.
LEADMALE:And I realized that There would be a terrible void if I suddenly found myself without Ralph jetland.
LEADFEMALE:No, not him.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I think Ralph jetland could be talked into voting with us.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse! Well, I'm sorry, Steven.
LEADMALE:I've got to tell bernice.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:Just a second.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Steven.
SUPMALE:Now we're alone.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, bernice.
SUPMALE:Hello, Phyllis.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, stop it, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:They're gone.
LEADMALE:How'd the vote count go? We think we have enough to win.
LEADFEMALE:We'll know for sure tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:Steven! You're soaking wet! I've been walking around since I left.
OTHERFEMALE:For three hours, in the rain? My goodness! I didn't say I enjoyed it.
SUPMALE:Well, come on upstairs and change.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Steven, you're going to catch cold.
OTHERMALE:Elyse, I have some things to say to you, and I'm not changing my clothes until I say them.
OTHERMALE:You have every right to be angry.
SUPFEMALE:I am angry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just not sure if I'm angry at you or at me or at condominiums.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm confused.
OTHERFEMALE:Part of me feels selfish, and part of me feels neglected.
SUPMALE:All of you looks wet and soggy.
SUPFEMALE:Won't you come up and change? I'm trying to explain something to you a-and to myself.
SUPMALE:Look all of the things which have been taking up your time this past few days have been wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Your career, spending time with the kids, helping distraught women.
LEADMALE:Even though part of me wants you around the house all the time, I love the fact that you're never here.
LEADFEMALE:That didn't come out right.
LEADFEMALE:I think I know what you mean.
SUPMALE:It's just that i can't help feeling that at some point during the past few days, you could have said no to someone besides me.
LEADFEMALE:It seems like you're just taking me for granted.
LEADMALE:It's because I'm taking you for granted.
SUPMALE:So I was on the right track.
LEADFEMALE:But don't think I'm taking for granted the fact that you let me take you for granted.
LEADFEMALE:If I understood that, would I be happy? Oh, I meant it as a compliment.
SUPFEMALE:You see, i-i was brought up to think of a husband as the be-all and end-all of my existence, that a man should be the center of my life and that I should learn to live in his shadow and sublimate my ambitions to his and wait on him hand and foot and satisfy his every need, answer his every desire.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can see how ridiculous that is, can't you? Can't you, Steven? Oh, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:A momentary lapse.
SUPFEMALE:But of course i don't want that.
SUPMALE:No, you'd hate it.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe "hate" is too strong a word.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, it's been your support and encouragement that's allowed me to grow and become the woman I am.
LEADMALE:I don't know another man that I could be fighting with right now.
SUPFEMALE:I'm flattered.
LEADMALE:But when things get hectic and I'm being pulled in all directions, I find that I'm shortchanging you because I know that you'll always be there for me.
SUPMALE:I want to be there for you.
LEADFEMALE:But I know I haven't been there for you, that I wasn't there to share your award because I was doing things.
LEADFEMALE:I know I've got to learn to say no to other things so that there'll be time for us.
OTHERMALE:So from now on, if it's between clean air and you, clean air's got to go.
SUPMALE:Don't do that, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Clean air is important.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Clean air stays.
LEADMALE:Let's see.
OTHERMALE:What about I know Planned parenthood.
SUPMALE:You can't give that up.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I know Pets without partners.
SUPFEMALE:There's one.
SUPFEMALE:That can go.
LEADFEMALE:Though I hate to think of all those lonely pets.
LEADMALE:

SUPMALE:YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE THING IS MY FAULT.
LEADFEMALE:I MEAN, IF I HAD GONE OUT WITH CARRIE, LIKE SHE ASKED ME TO, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO OUT WITH SOCIETAL DREGS.
SUPFEMALE: ALEX IS JEALOUS.
LEADMALE:YOU'RE DYING TO GO OUT WITH HER, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO DO IT.
LEADMALE:NO, NO, NO.
LEADFEMALE:THAT -- THAT -- THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.
SUPFEMALE:I'M GONNA ASK HER OUT.
LEADFEMALE:BUT NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO.
SUPMALE:I'LL DO IT BECAUSE DUTY CALLS ME.
LEADFEMALE:I OWE IT TO CARRIE TO SAVE HER FROM HERSELF.
OTHERFEMALE:I'VE GOT TO BE STRONG FOR BOTH OF US.
SUPFEMALE:SHE IS -- IS A SHIP T-THAT HAS LOST HER WAY IN THE NIGHT AND I'M HER LIGHTHOUSE.

OTHERMALE: ALEX.
LEADFEMALE:I THOUGHT YOU WENT TO BED HOURS AGO.

OTHERMALE:DON'T YOU WANT TO GET CRAZY WITH ME? YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:I-I MEAN, NO.
SUPFEMALE:NO! NO.
LEADFEMALE:WE CAN'T.
OTHERMALE:WHY NOT? BECAUSE IT DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS NIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:WE CAN HAVE FUN WITHOUT HAVING FUN.
OTHERFEMALE:ALEX, YOU CAN'T TELL ME THIS IS A NORMAL DATE FOR YOU.
LEADFEMALE:THE PURPOSE OF TONIGHT WAS NOT TO HAVE A NORMAL DATE.
LEADMALE:WELL, YOU'VE SUCCEEDED THERE.
OTHERMALE:THIS IS NOT THE ALEX THAT I WANTED TO GO OUT WITH.
LEADFEMALE:MY ALEX MADE ME LAUGH.
LEADMALE:HE MADE ME FEEL SPECIAL.
OTHERFEMALE:AND I COULD MAKE HIM LAUGH AND FEEL SPECIAL.
LEADFEMALE:WHERE IS HE TONIGHT? THAT -- THAT ALEX HAS NO PLACE HERE.
LEADMALE:I'M HERE INSTEAD.
SUPMALE:CARRIE, I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
SUPFEMALE:WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
LEADMALE:I'M TALKING ABOUT THE -- THE WAY YOU ACT, THE -- THE WAY YOU DRESS, THE WAY YOU TALK.
LEADMALE:YOU DON'T ACT LIKE A GIRL SHOULD ACT.
LEADMALE:Y-YOU SHOULD BE MORE LIKE SHERRY? WHAT IS WRONG WITH SHERRY? YOU PUT A BRAIN IN THAT HEAD, YOU GOT A REAL SPECIAL GIRL.
LEADFEMALE:SO THAT'S WHAT TONIGHT WAS ALL ABOUT? YOU WERE TRYING TO SHOW ME HOW TO BE A GOOD LITTLE GIRL? CARRIE, YOU'VE GOT TO SETTLE DOWN BEFORE YOU DO SOME DAMAGE.
LEADMALE:I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE SOME PRIDE, SOME SELF-RESPECT.
LEADMALE:I JUST WANT YOU TO SEE THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.
SUPMALE:YOU'RE RIGHT.
SUPFEMALE:THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.
LEADMALE:AND I'M GOING TO EXERCISE ONE OF THEM RIGHT NOW.
SUPMALE:SEE YOU 'ROUND, ALEX.
SUPMALE:OH, HI, ALEX.
LEADMALE:HI, DAD.
LEADFEMALE:UP KIND OF LATE, AREN'T YOU?  TO BE HONEST, UH, I'M WAITING UP FOR MALLORY.
SUPMALE:I KNOW IT'S OLD-FASHIONED, BUT, UH, EVERY TIME SHE GOES OUT WITH A NEW BOY, I CAN'T HELP WORRYING A LITTLE.
LEADFEMALE:I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
LEADMALE:THAT'S BECAUSE I USUALLY WORRY UPSTAIRS.
LEADMALE:THERE'S A LOT MORE TO WORRY ABOUT WITH GIRLS THAN WITH BOYS, ISN'T THERE? NOT MORE WORRIES -- JUST, UH, DIFFERENT ONES.
SUPMALE:BUT YOU WOULD SAY THAT A GIRL HAS TO BE MORE CAREFUL THAN A GUY? YOU KNOW, WORRY MORE ABOUT HER REPUTATION, HER DEMEANOR, THE WAY SHE ACTS IN PUBLIC.
LEADFEMALE:WHERE'S CARRIE? SHE WALKED OUT ON ME.
LEADMALE:ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS HELP HER, AND THAT'S THE THANKS I GET.
LEADFEMALE:MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE HELPED.
LEADFEMALE:MAYBE SHE'S, UH, HAPPY THE WAY SHE IS.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, MAYBE SHE'S HAPPY WITH IT, BUT I'M NOT.
LEADMALE: I GUESS THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM, ISN'T IT? MM-HMM.
OTHERMALE:WHY AM I DRIVING MYSELF CRAZY? I MEAN, SHE'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.
SUPFEMALE:NOT LIKELY.
LEADFEMALE:I-I GUESS I BETTER JUST FORGET ABOUT HER, HUH? THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
SUPMALE:YEAH.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:IT WOULD.
LEADMALE:THANKS, DAD.
LEADFEMALE:GOOD NIGHT.
LEADMALE:GOOD NIGHT, ALEX.
SUPFEMALE:WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO CHANGE? BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE WITH HER.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL LIKE WHEN CARRIE AND I ARE TOGETHER? I-I FEEL LIKE AN ASTRONAUT WHO NEVER WENT THROUGH THE TRAINING PROGRAM.
SUPFEMALE:I'M OUT THERE IN SOME OTHER WORLD, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FLY THE SHIP.
OTHERFEMALE:WELL, THEN, UH YOU WERE LUCKY TO BE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOES.
LEADMALE:YEAH.
SUPMALE:GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
OTHERFEMALE:I AM LUCKY.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S PRETTY AMAZING OUT THERE.
LEADFEMALE:I KNOW.
LEADFEMALE:I MARRIED AN ASTRONAUT MYSELF.
SUPFEMALE:UH, DAD IF, UH, BOYS AND GIRLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED THE SAME, HOW COME YOU'RE WAITING UP FOR MALLORY? 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY HOME.
LEADMALE:UH, WELL, UH  THINK I'LL FINISH MY WAITING UPSTAIRS.
LEADFEMALE:I JUST WANT TO SAY RIGHT OFF, I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAME BACK.
LEADMALE:I THINK I DO.
LEADFEMALE:YOU WANTED TO TELL ME WHAT A JERK I WAS, H-HOW RUDE I WAS, HOW OBNOXIOUS, PRESUMPTUOUS, MANIPULATIVE.
SUPFEMALE:KEEP GOING.
SUPFEMALE:I THINK YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.
LEADFEMALE:CARRIE, I-I AM SORRY.
LEADMALE:BOY, THIS EVENING REALLY BACKFIRED.
LEADMALE:I WANTED TO REFORM YOU, TO TURN YOU INTO A REAL LADY, AND INSTEAD INSTEAD WHAT? I THINK MAYBE YOU ALREADY ARE A LADY.
LEADMALE:IT'S JUST THAT Y-YOU'RE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LADY FROM THE KIND OF LADY THAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE WORD "LADY.
OTHERMALE:" ALEX, WHAT IF I DECIDED TO BECOME THE GOOD LITTLE GIRL YOU WANT ME TO BE? DO YOU REALLY THINK EITHER OF US WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT? I DON'T KNOW.
LEADFEMALE:CARRIE, WE'RE SO DIFFERENT.
LEADMALE:WHY DO WE LIKE EACH OTHER SO MUCH? BECAUSE WE ARE SO DIFFERENT.
OTHERFEMALE:BECAUSE WE SEE IN EACH OTHER SOMETHING WE DON'T SEE IN OURSELVES.
LEADMALE:AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT, ALEX.
SUPMALE:WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WHAT WE WANT TO DO.
LEADFEMALE: I'M GLAD I ASKED.
LEADFEMALE:WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME TONIGHT? I ALREADY DID.
LEADFEMALE:NO, NO, NO.
SUPFEMALE:I MEAN, AGAIN.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S STILL EARLY.
SUPMALE:I KNOW A REAL ROMANTIC PLACE.
LEADFEMALE:GREAT AMBIENCE.
SUPMALE:SOUNDS NICE.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:where's Mallory? Ah, she's still getting dressed.
SUPMALE:What's taking her so long? Jeff is gonna be here any minute.
SUPFEMALE:That's what's taking her so long.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jennifer, let me explain to you a few things about the female of the species.
LEADFEMALE:This ought to be good for a laugh.
OTHERMALE:You see, the most important weapon that that any female possesses is her ability to attract the male.
LEADMALE:For example, the, uh, the female blue Jay has her decorative plumage.
SUPFEMALE:Thus, right now Mallory is upstairs putting on her feathers and snapping on her beak.
LEADMALE:Alex, it is the male blue Jay that has the pretty feathers.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Occasionally, you'll find a deviant Jay or two, but As a rule, most birds play it straight.
SUPMALE:Give it up, Alex.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think? Did Jennifer say you could borrow that? This happens to be what all the college girls are wearing this year.
LEADMALE:You like it, don't you, Jen? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You look Cute.
LEADMALE:Cute! I don't want to look cute.
SUPMALE:I want to look sophisticated.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should put on a false mustache.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, why are you so nervous? Jeff is crazy about you.
LEADFEMALE:He was crazy about me before he went off to college.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just nervous that he's changed.
SUPMALE:Alex, you got to help me out.
SUPMALE:What do you think i could do to be more interesting to a college man? Buy a car.
SUPMALE:Look, let's face it, Mallory.
LEADMALE:You have always been Borderline interesting at best.
SUPMALE:Jeff has been away at Princeton.
SUPMALE:He he's mingling with people of the world, with jet setters and cover girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice of you to cheer her up, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, okay, Mallory, I'll help you out.
OTHERFEMALE:A few pointers to get you in tune with the way a college man thinks.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, let me see.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, books.
OTHERFEMALE:Just discuss books.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, have you read, uh, "the Scarlet pimpernel"? "Wuthering heights"? Uh, "the sound and the fury"? I saw "the sound of music.
LEADMALE:" Now, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What am I worried about? I know Jeff still likes me.
LEADMALE:I'm sure of it.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to these letters.
LEADFEMALE:"Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:" That's me.
OTHERFEMALE:"The cafeteria food is worse than I imagined, "and as I sit here "looking at the corn in cream sauce, I think of you.
LEADFEMALE:" "Your pal, Jeff.
LEADMALE:" Can you believe how romantic he is? I don't know, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, I may be a little jaded, but, uh, that doesn't sound all that romantic to me.
LEADMALE:That's because you don't know how to read a love letter.
SUPMALE:You got to read between the lines.
LEADFEMALE:Like when he says the food stinks, he means, "i miss you.
SUPMALE:" So if he really meant the food stinks, w-what would he say? "Be my love"? 
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Dinner is set.
LEADMALE:I hope Jeff likes lasagna.
LEADFEMALE:I hope he likes me.
LEADMALE:Mallory, stop worrying.
SUPMALE:Jeff is crazy about you.
OTHERMALE:What if he's all different now? What if he's not shy? What if he's not sweet? What if he just doesn't like me anymore? Of course he still likes you.
OTHERFEMALE:Why else do you think he's coming for dinner tonight? You think it's just for the lasagna? Well, he did write me how awful the food was at college.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, honey, that was just his way of telling you he missed you.
LEADFEMALE:See, Alex? Oh, I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Don't answer it! It could be Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should change.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:You look cute in Jennifer's outfit.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, you look fine.
LEADMALE:Really.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Jeff, welcome home.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? Hi, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hey, Alex.
SUPMALE:And who's this? Jeff, it's me, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I know it's you.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to your sense of humor? Oh, that's clever.
LEADFEMALE:Very clever.
LEADMALE:"Boola boola.
SUPFEMALE:" Mallory, did you make these cookies? They're great.
LEADMALE:Well, i-i kind of helped.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory's the one that set the oven on 375.
LEADMALE:We're all pretty darn proud of her.
OTHERMALE:So, Jeff, tell me, have you read "the withering pimpernel"? You know, Jeff, everyone was very impressed when you got that scholarship.
LEADMALE:Whole town's very proud.
SUPFEMALE:I am, too.
SUPMALE:I'm truly delighted that things are going so well for you there at the, uh, league of Ivy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I think I'll go change for our date.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with what you're wearing? Don't be silly, papa.
LEADFEMALE:This outfit is simply for dining, not for an evening on the town.
LEADMALE:My apologies, ma petite.
LEADMALE:He's so amusing, isn't he, Jeff? Oh, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, could Alex and I do that? Huh? Being at college, I never get to clear the table anymore.
OTHERMALE:I kind of miss it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think I want to go to college.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Have fun.
LEADMALE:If you really want to have a good time, mop the floor.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I have a confession to make.
SUPFEMALE:I really didn't want to clear the table.
LEADFEMALE:Well, neither do I.
LEADMALE:There's the back door.
LEADFEMALE:Let's make a run for it.
SUPMALE:I'm serious.
LEADMALE:I have to talk to you.
LEADMALE:All right, Jeff, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Alex, college is terrible.
OTHERMALE:I'm homesick.
SUPFEMALE:I'm confused.
LEADMALE:I don't want to be at Princeton.
LEADMALE:I hate it there.
LEADMALE:Ah, you had me going for a minute, you kidder, you.
SUPFEMALE:I know what this is.
LEADMALE:This is a fraternity prank, right? No.
SUPMALE:I-I'm not kidding.
OTHERMALE:You know how in high school, you're one of the smartest kids? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:It's one of my favorite things.
LEADMALE:Well, at college, all the kids were the smartest kids in their high schools.
LEADMALE:I'm just average there.
LEADMALE:Just average? I don't think i could tolerate that.
SUPFEMALE:I'm disoriented.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm nervous.
LEADMALE:There's too much pressure.
LEADMALE:I'm not happy.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what are you two chaps talking about? Jeff was just telling me About the great college days I'm having.
LEADMALE:Did did I tell you, in a few weeks, we go against Yale in Polo? No.
LEADFEMALE:What will they be wearing? Did you like the movie? Yeah, I did.
SUPFEMALE:It was great.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Didn't I act like I liked it? You did.
LEADMALE:You did.
LEADMALE:This is nice, too.
OTHERMALE:Just relaxing.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory I don't know how to say this.
LEADMALE:I knew it! You don't want to see me anymore.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not it.
SUPFEMALE:Will you go steady with me? You don't have to answer right away.
LEADMALE:Yes! You hesitated.
OTHERMALE:Does that mean you're not sure? No! I'm sure! I'm thrilled! You don't like it.
SUPMALE:I love it! It's your French club pin! Oh, I want you to pin it on me! Where? On my sweater.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff, it's traditional to pin it closer to the heart.
LEADFEMALE:There.
LEADMALE:How does that look? Great.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I just have one question.
SUPFEMALE:How can we go steady if you're at Princeton? You mean, how can i go to Princeton if we're going steady? Either way.
LEADMALE:I've given this a lot of thought, and the best thing would be for me to transfer to school here in town.
SUPMALE:Are you serious? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? I didn't know how much you meant to me until I went away.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you could tell that from my letters.
SUPMALE:Any fool could tell from those letters.
OTHERMALE:Sure, if I graduated from Princeton, I could probably do anything i want with my life.
SUPMALE:But right now, you're what I want.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know how I could be somewhere where you're Not.
SUPFEMALE:Jeff, I didn't know you felt this way.
SUPFEMALE:You probably haven't noticed this, but I'm a "keep it inside" kind of guy.
OTHERFEMALE:It's great that nothing's changed between us, isn't it? Nothing's changed, and nothing's going to change.
SUPMALE:Ow! Nothing like unwinding on a Saturday morning, huh, Alex? I like to stay wound, dad.
SUPMALE:It's what gives me my edge.
OTHERMALE:I-I'll relax tonight at the homecoming dance.
SUPMALE:Who are you going with? Oh, you don't know her.
SUPMALE:I don't know her, either.
SUPFEMALE:You're too selective, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to lower your standards a little.
LEADMALE:I thought you had a strict policy against blind dates.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I do.
SUPFEMALE:I do.
LEADMALE:This isn't a blind date.
SUPFEMALE:I've seen her yearbook picture.
LEADMALE:She's on page 157.
SUPMALE:So all you know about this girl is what she looks like and what page she's on? I know her name, i mean Couldn't forget that.
LEADFEMALE:It's inga Something.
SUPFEMALE:And I know she She's chock-full of pep, she speaks fluent Latvian, and best of all, she's a member of the future farmers of America.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let her get away, Alex.
SUPMALE:Morning, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, hi.
LEADFEMALE:I've got an announcement to make.
OTHERMALE:It's really important.
LEADFEMALE:You found a new eye shadow.
LEADMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff and i are going steady.
LEADMALE:I was stunned, too.
LEADFEMALE:You're what? Oh, he just asked me last night.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know if I like the idea of you going steady.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? I thought you liked Jeff.
SUPMALE:Well, I do, uh, but as terrific as Jeff is, I think you're too young to restrict yourself to one person.
LEADMALE: You don't want to miss out on your youth.
LEADMALE:If going steady at 15 is okay, when is it okay to get engaged 18? Then what Married at 20? Isn't that the way you and mommy did it? We're not gonna forbid you to go steady, but we don't think it's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's a wonderful idea.
LEADMALE:He gave me this.
SUPMALE:It's his French club pin.
LEADFEMALE:It means l'amour.
LEADFEMALE:Sure it doesn't Sure it doesn't mean he didn't want to spring for real jewelry? You have to make fun of everything, don't you, Alex? I feel sorry for you.
LEADMALE:You feel sorry for me? That's right.
SUPMALE:It's too bad you've never felt the love for another person that I feel for Jeff.
OTHERMALE:I've felt love, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Love is a sacred thing.
SUPMALE:I just like to keep it in perspective.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, this doesn't make sense.
LEADFEMALE:How can you go steady with someone who's going to school so far away? That's the best part, mom.
SUPFEMALE:He's coming home.
SUPFEMALE:He's gonna go to Grant college.
OTHERMALE:Grant college? That's not a real school.
LEADFEMALE:You could get into Grant college.
SUPMALE:That is enough out of you, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, could you help me pick out an outfit for the dance tonight? But we only have 10 hours.
LEADFEMALE:That's cutting it close, but I'm game.
SUPFEMALE:Some people search their whole lives for the right person.
LEADMALE:I'm so lucky i didn't have to wait.
LEADMALE:I can be happy from now on.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I knew Jeff was unhappy at Princeton, but, uh, not this unhappy.
SUPMALE:What makes you think Jeff was unhappy at Princeton? Oh, he told me last night.
SUPFEMALE:He he went on and on about how he couldn't handle it there, how he didn't fit in.
LEADFEMALE:I thought that I'd convinced him to stay, give it a chance, but then he goes and he pulls a stunt like this.
LEADMALE:I don't like it, Steven.
OTHERMALE:I don't either, Elyse, but let's, uh, give it some time and see how serious they get.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Yeah, uh, just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, it's for you.
LEADMALE:Inga.
OTHERMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:The future farmer.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:How you doing? Hey-hey, congratulations! Her pig had a baby.
LEADFEMALE:What? Uh, well Well, i-i don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, if you want me to.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, put her on.
SUPFEMALE:Sooey! Sooey! It's a pig.
OTHERMALE:No, no, inga I got to take a break.
LEADFEMALE:My legs are buckling.
SUPMALE:I don't do the plowing that you do.
OTHERFEMALE:Inga likes to dance, huh? Well, she threatened to hog-tie the band if they took a break.
SUPMALE: And one more time, boys.
SUPFEMALE:And a one and a two Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Got out of there just in time.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad someone's dancing, anyway.
SUPMALE:Mallory, what's the matter? Where's Jeff? Alex, we haven't danced once.
SUPFEMALE:This whole evening has been Has been a stroll down memory Lane.
LEADFEMALE:We visited the cafeteria.
LEADMALE:We we looked up his favorite books in the card catalog.
LEADFEMALE:We went to the chem lab and took pictures of his old bunsen burner.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's, uh That's natural.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I mean, after all, it is his first time home.
LEADFEMALE:He probably just wants to see some of the things he missed while he was away, that's all.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that I thought that I was one of 'em.
SUPFEMALE: Sooey! Sooey! Uh, that's for me.
LEADFEMALE:Inga, wait Mallory, you should have gone with me.
LEADFEMALE:That window in my homeroom is still broken.
LEADFEMALE:It was great.
SUPFEMALE:Jeff, when are we gonna dance? Soon.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to see my old locker.
SUPMALE:What a locker.
SUPFEMALE:This will be one for the album.
LEADFEMALE:It's just like the old days.
SUPFEMALE:Same girl, same locker.
SUPMALE:Jeff, i don't understand why you even brought me here tonight.
LEADFEMALE:You might as well be here by yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, I haven't been in this school for four months.
SUPFEMALE:It's not the same for you.
LEADMALE:You're here every day.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about? I-it's hard to be away from home.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I'm scared.
SUPFEMALE:I'm confused.
OTHERFEMALE:I-i get homesick.
SUPMALE:You don't know what I'm going through right now.
SUPMALE:What you're going through? What about me? I'm out with someone I was supposed to be going steady with.
LEADMALE:You know, "going steady.
OTHERFEMALE:" That means two people A girl and a boy, not a girl and a boy and his locker.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:needham! Remember me? Oh, well, how could I forget? Roger.
LEADMALE:Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:Mendoza.
SUPMALE:Wakefield.
SUPFEMALE:Right, right.
LEADMALE:You still working at the firestone plant? Uh, no, i went to Princeton.
LEADFEMALE:How is it? I'm dropping out.
LEADFEMALE:Good for you.
LEADFEMALE:I love that man.
SUPMALE:Jeff, this has been a ridiculous evening.
LEADMALE:Take me home.
LEADFEMALE:Why? I thought everything was going so well.
SUPFEMALE:Say, uh, don, could you give me a hand here? Uh, someone spilled some punch.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:The school needs me.
LEADFEMALE:Just like the old days.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going, Alex? Great.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, can that girl bale hay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad someone's having a good time, anyway.
SUPMALE:Didn't Jeff come back? Yeah, he came back.
SUPMALE:Took a few snapshots of his favorite locker.
LEADFEMALE:And now he's off mopping up punch with his favorite teacher.
OTHERMALE:We haven't danced once all night.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:That's my favorite song.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you want to da You want to dance? I'd love to.
LEADMALE:Really? You're a hard guy to figure, Alex.
LEADMALE:I never thought you'd go for a farm girl.
LEADMALE:Call it Animal magnetism.
LEADFEMALE:What do you possibly have in common with this girl? Oh, the land, dad.
LEADFEMALE:The land.
LEADFEMALE:She's special.
LEADMALE:She's contributing to the breadbasket of America.
LEADMALE:She's got dirt under her fingernails.
LEADFEMALE:That's a nice quality in a date.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hi, mal.
LEADFEMALE:How was the dance? Mom, I'd like to speak to you alone.
LEADMALE:Come on, Alex.
SUPMALE:Let's continue this up in the bunkhouse.
LEADFEMALE:She was at one with nature, dad.
LEADFEMALE:It was thrilling.
LEADMALE:Stray ducks followed us home.
LEADMALE:Aw, Mallory, what happened tonight? Nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:That's the problem.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff hardly knew i was there.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, have you asked yourself why Jeff wants to come back home? I know why he wants to come back home.
LEADFEMALE:He wants to be with me.
OTHERMALE:Well, I know I know that's part of it, but but Jeff's been very unhappy at school.
LEADMALE:You know, the first year of college can be a very frustrating experience.
SUPMALE:Okay, I admit Jeff is homesick.
LEADMALE:He's confused and scared.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't mean he doesn't care about me, does it? Of course he cares about you, mal, but that's not the point.
SUPMALE:You see, i-i think it's hard for him to admit that he's scared, that he might not be good enough, and it's nicer to think that there's this this wonderful girl back home that he just can't live without.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, Jeff is the sweetest guy I know.
LEADFEMALE:He makes me feel like I'm the most special person in the world.
LEADFEMALE:No one else does that.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to lose him.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, sometimes when you love someone, the best way to hold on to him is just to let him go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like Jeff.
SUPFEMALE:Probably wants to look at our door once more, for old time's sake.
SUPFEMALE:Oh Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I hope i didn't wake anybody.
SUPMALE:No, Jeff.
LEADMALE:Normally we don't sleep this close to the door.
LEADFEMALE:Good point.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
OTHERMALE:There she is.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's crazy.
LEADFEMALE:These past two months, all I've wanted to do is be with you.
OTHERMALE:Tonight I could have been, and I was, but I wasn't.
LEADFEMALE:Is this what you looked like tonight? Pretty much.
SUPFEMALE:And I didn't notice you? Well, it's kind of tough to compete against a great-looking locker like old 235.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeff, we need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:You want to go first? No, you go ahead.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, you know, the first year of college can be a Jeff, I thought i was gonna go first.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Jeff, you know, the first year at college can be a very frustrating Experience.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:And it might seem like the easiest thing to do would be to just Come home.
LEADMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:This is good.
OTHERMALE:Jeff, you know you mean a lot to me.
LEADMALE:And you mean a lot to me.
SUPFEMALE:And sometimes when you care about someone, the best way to hold on to them is to let them go.
SUPFEMALE:I think I should go back to Princeton, Mallory.
LEADMALE:You do? So do I.
OTHERFEMALE:You do? I was hoping for a little, "Jeff, please don't go.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, I was kind of hoping for a little, "but, Mallory, i can't leave you.
LEADMALE:" It is gonna be hard to leave you.
LEADMALE:It's gonna be hard to see you go.
LEADFEMALE:What's gonna happen to us? No girl's ever liked me like you before.
OTHERMALE:I'm afraid of losing you.
LEADMALE:I am, too, but I'm glad we're afraid.
LEADMALE:That must mean we really care.
SUPMALE:Do you think we can still go steady on weekends and holidays? Weekends are tough.
LEADMALE:Princeton's so far away.
LEADMALE:Okay, just holidays, then.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing on Lincoln's birthday? Jeff, let's just play it by ear.
LEADMALE:It's worked out pretty well for us so far.
LEADMALE:I guess it'd be wrong for you to keep the pin.
LEADFEMALE:We don't need a pin to say how much we care for each other.
LEADFEMALE:No, we don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you busy groundhog day? 
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, that is two! Break another, and we're down to service for one.
LEADMALE:I don't know what's wrong with me tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I seem so nervous.
SUPMALE:Would the fact that it's parents night at school have anything to do with it? It's parents night? At school? Already? Yes, yes, it is, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Your night of nights.
LEADMALE:A chance for your parents and your teachers to get together, review your grades, and have a good laugh.
LEADMALE:You're so smug, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You just love parents night, don't you? Oh, you bet.
LEADFEMALE:I put it right up there with Christmas Eve.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you coming with the dishes? Um, there's one or two left.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:We should be back by 9:30.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I know it's gonna be very hectic there tonight, so if you have to skip seeing my algebra teacher, I'll understand.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, as of yesterday, Mrs.
SUPMALE:stigney She took a vow of silence.
LEADFEMALE:We'll pass notes to each other.
LEADFEMALE:What about you, Alex? Anyone you want us to avoid? Au contraire! You go anywhere you want to go.
LEADFEMALE:I just hope you can contain your joy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, remember, make sure and see Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco.
LEADFEMALE:You've reminded us every hour.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean to be a pest about this, but it's really important.
SUPMALE:His cousin is on the faculty at dartmouth.
LEADFEMALE:If he writes me a letter of recommendation, I'm in.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Alex.
LEADMALE:Uh, s-so you'll see him? You'll, uh, butter him up? Consider him buttered.
LEADMALE:Okay, Elyse, you go to Alex's classes, and I'll go to Mallory's.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco.
LEADMALE:Good guess.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? Elyse Keaton, Alex's mother.
LEADMALE:Alex Keaton Good man.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:You must be very proud.
SUPMALE:Alex is the best student in this class.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, that's not saying much.
SUPFEMALE:Half of them think "the hunchback of notre dame" was a football player.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, this is one of his favorite classes.
LEADFEMALE:He talks about you all the time.
LEADFEMALE:No need to butter me up.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't buttering you up.
LEADFEMALE:That was the truth.
LEADFEMALE:My husband and I were very anxious to meet you, but he had to go to my daughter Mallory's algebra class.
LEADMALE:Mallory? I had a student named Mallory Keaton last year.
LEADFEMALE:She's the one.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Which one of your children is adopted? All right, everybody.

LEADFEMALE:I have something to say.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco, I-i think you owe Mrs.
SUPMALE:binney and everyone else in here an apology.
SUPFEMALE: Yes! Y-you've been terribly rude and insulting to us all.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton, it's clear that your son does not get his intelligence from you.
SUPMALE:If you feel I'm being insulting, fine.
LEADMALE:I won't insult anyone anymore.
LEADMALE:This little get-together is over.
SUPMALE:I'm leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:The game is over.
LEADMALE:Let me through.
LEADMALE:Don't push me! Move it, grandma.
SUPFEMALE:You can't do that! Who's gonna stop me? All right.
LEADMALE:Mallory, you hold the plate, Jennifer, you hold that piece, and I'll fit them together.
LEADMALE:Okay, great, great.
LEADMALE:We've just got to hold it like this for two minutes, and it'll last for 2,000 years.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, it says so right on the bottle.
SUPMALE:What should we do? All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Don't panic.
LEADMALE:Don't panic.
LEADMALE:Hello? Yeah, just a second.
OTHERFEMALE:It's for you Linda.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:Uh, Linda? I'm gonna take it in the other room.
LEADMALE:Sorry about that.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, dad.
OTHERMALE:You're home early.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? I-it's a long story.
LEADMALE:You talked to Mrs.
LEADMALE:stigney, didn't you?! Y-yes, but that's not Oh, I knew it.
LEADMALE:Listen, I promise I'll work harder from now on.
LEADMALE:Mallory, it's I'll do my homework every night, I swear.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe not every night, but every other night Mallory! We have other, more serious problems right now.
SUPFEMALE:Thank god.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Mom and dad.
LEADMALE:How'd it go? Alex, maybe you'd better sit down.
LEADMALE:I can't sit down.
SUPMALE:I'm too excited.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, did you see Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco? Did you, uh, make an impression on him? Very definitely.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Tell me every detail.

LEADMALE:I punched Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco in the mouth.
LEADFEMALE:What did you say? I punched him.
LEADMALE:Um W-when you say "punched," d-do you mean an affectionate little tap, like, uh, "way to go, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco"? I decked him.
LEADMALE:Wow! Wow! Any particular reason? He shoved an elderly lady! That's it?! How old? Alex, your Mr.
SUPMALE:tedesco is a rude, crass, vile human being! I could have told you that! What did you have to hit him for?! He was being so rude and insulting that That hitting him was an automatic reflexive response! I was seized by an uncontrollable impulse! Can't you understand?! No! It was just one of those things.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I-i-I'm sure we can all understand it.
SUPFEMALE:Could you explain it to me one more time, Elyse? Maybe if you showed us how it happened, mom.
OTHERMALE:Alex, you be Mr.
OTHERMALE:tedes Steven, I'm so ashamed of myself Striking another human being.
SUPMALE:Well, look, Elyse, I'm sure that this can all be cleared up cleared up very easily.
LEADMALE:Now, why don't you just call him up and apologize? Good idea, good idea.
LEADMALE:I'll get the number.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is going to be fine.
SUPFEMALE:You just had a bad night, that's all.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Champ.
LEADMALE:That's right, mom.
LEADMALE:And anyways, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco's been asking for it for a long time now.
LEADFEMALE:It's time somebody put him in his place.
SUPMALE:Mallory, I don't want you to interpret this in any way as meaning that I condone violence.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't.
LEADFEMALE:It was a freak occurrence.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Okay, mom.
SUPMALE:Here you go.
SUPFEMALE:Say anything you have to say.
OTHERMALE:But get me that recommendation.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I think I know how to handle this.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco? Hi.
SUPFEMALE:This is Elyse Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Please, please! Hear me out! Mr.
SUPFEMALE:tedesco, I-i feel terribly about what happened, and and I want to apologize.

LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco, I came to apologize for my wife's behavior.
OTHERFEMALE:She feels terrible about the whole thing.
LEADFEMALE:She's really sorry.
SUPMALE:We both are.
LEADMALE:I could sue, you know.
SUPMALE:Look, uh, look, l-l-let's let's try to gain some perspective on the situation here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, haven't you ever done something without thinking Something you regretted later? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:I showed up for parents night.
OTHERMALE:Look, look, I know you're upset, and you have every right to be, but you're obviously a very intelligent, civilized person who can recognize this incident for what it is.
LEADFEMALE:An aberration.
LEADMALE:And, uh, I hope you'll forgive and forget.
SUPMALE:Fortunately, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, your son inherited your rational temperament.
OTHERFEMALE:For his sake, I will allow myself to be appeased by your words.
LEADMALE:I am nothing if not civilized.
LEADMALE:Well I can see that.
SUPMALE:Your wife, however, is an Amazon.
LEADFEMALE:Part Irish, part French.
OTHERMALE:No Amazon.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what I mean, Keaton.
LEADMALE:She's primal! Not fully evolved.
LEADMALE:You must have a tough time keeping her in line.
LEADMALE:Tell me Do whips ever enter the picture? I think I'll be going now.
LEADMALE:No, I'm curious What's it like to live with that kind of unbridled she-devil? Goodbye, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:tedesco.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Just one more question.
OTHERMALE:Does she ever, uh? Why, you You're in a good mood, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, why shouldn't I be in a good mood? Right now, dad and Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco are probably shaking hands.
OTHERMALE:They're probably deciding whether or not to go out for a beer.
LEADFEMALE:My problems are over.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, mom, want to go for a few rounds, just for old times' sake? Alex! Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee? Alex, I'm getting angry! Whoa! Kids, she's mad! Hit the deck! Aah! Will you stop it?! Just get the table set for dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, come on, mom.
LEADMALE:It's over now.
LEADMALE:We can laugh about it.
LEADMALE:Can't we? She's not laughing, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
OTHERMALE:What's this? It's a plate.
SUPMALE:It use to be a plate.
OTHERMALE:Now it's art.
SUPFEMALE:There's lots more art in the cupboard, mom.
OTHERMALE:Well, dad, how'd it go? Will he write me the recommendation? Well, we didn't exactly discuss the recommendation.
SUPMALE:Well, what did you talk about? Well, um First, I introduced myself.
SUPMALE:Then, I-i told him how sorry we were.
LEADMALE:I convinced him to forgive and forget.
SUPMALE:Then we made a little bit of small talk, idle chatter.
LEADFEMALE:Then I punched him in the face.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Alex.
SUPMALE:The man is slime.
LEADMALE:Elyse, if you'd heard the things he'd said I can't believe this! I can't let you two out of the house! Alex, that man would have made a killer out of Gandhi.
LEADFEMALE:That man held the key to my future in his hands.
LEADMALE:That that letter of recommendation w-was my passport to the Ivy league, t-to penny loafers, raccoon coats Girls named muffy.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, there's always trade school.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh! How did all this happen, Elyse? For all these years, we've lived by the doctrine of non-violence, of sympathy and love towards our fellow man, peace and Harmony.
LEADMALE:The man is a rodent.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, my geography teacher has been wising off lately.
LEADMALE:Could one of you rough her up a bit? We've got to put a stop to this.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, I know this may sound crazy, but I think we ought to invite Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco to dinner tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:What for? To finish him off? I don't want that man in my home, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Neither do I, Steven, but until we can sit down in peace with him, we'll never be able to sit down in peace with ourselves.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:And I think we owe it to Alex to smooth this thing over.
SUPMALE:Well Now you're talking some sense.
SUPFEMALE:It's settled.
LEADMALE:We'll invite him for dinner tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, you got to help me out tonight.
LEADMALE:We got to keep things in an up mood when Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco comes Happiness, gaiety.
LEADFEMALE:Laugh and giggle as much as possible.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, let's practice, okay? Go ahead laugh.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
OTHERMALE:That's not bad, not bad, but try it with a little more enthusiasm.
OTHERFEMALE:Hee hee hee hee hee.
LEADMALE:Hee hee hee hee hee.
OTHERMALE:Better.
SUPMALE:Okay, look, uh If he starts getting into it with mom and dad, talk about something else, okay? Like Like the weather.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Alex, now, the chicken's in the oven, and the table is set.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, chicken? Chicken? Is that the best you could do, mom? What's wrong with chicken? You do not appease a man with poultry.
OTHERMALE:Beef! We need beef! We're having chicken, Alex.
SUPMALE:Okay, look, I've given some thought a-as to what you might say to Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco.
SUPMALE:"Never has so cruel an attack been perpetrated on so innocent a victim.
LEADFEMALE:" "Would that I could reverse the hands of time, I would.
SUPMALE:I beg your forgiveness with all my heart and soul"? Alex, we're not gonna say these things.
LEADMALE:We had no right to hit him.
LEADFEMALE:We know that.
LEADMALE:But we're not going to beg his forgiveness.
LEADMALE:Begging's out? Afraid so.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not gonna grovel, either.
LEADMALE:No groveling, either? Why are we having the guy over? I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:Please sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Hee hee hee hee hee! Hee hee hee hee hee! I'm glad you could accept our invitation, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course he accepted, mom.
LEADFEMALE:He's a very forgiving man.
LEADFEMALE:Before you sits a human being who thinks and acts on the highest plane imaginable.
SUPMALE:I came for the free dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Hee hee.
LEADMALE:Hee hee.
SUPMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:tedesco, why don't we start with a clean slate here? Now, we're all reasonable, intelligent human beings who have just behaved poorly over the past few days.
LEADMALE:Now, I know my husband and I are sorry for hitting you, and I'm sure that you're sorry for saying the things you said.
SUPMALE:What's for dinner? Chicken.
LEADFEMALE:But before we eat, I was hoping that I had chicken for lunch.
SUPMALE:Mom, there's got to be something else in the fridge.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can go out and eat.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, no, Alex.
LEADMALE:We are staying here.
LEADFEMALE:And we're eating chicken.
LEADFEMALE:I said I had chicken for lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Um They say it might rain.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Rain's good.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's the Mallory I remember.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco Steven! I-I think I need some help in the kitchen With the chicken.
LEADMALE:We'll help too, mom.
LEADMALE:Good! It's a big chicken.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry about that, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:tedesco.
SUPMALE:It's about what I expected.
LEADMALE:Look, uh There's no point in going on with this charade any longer.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna write that letter of recommendation for me, are you? Uh Are you? You know, Keaton This is one of those moments when I prize being a teacher When I can watch a student squirm because I hold his fate in my hands.
LEADFEMALE:You like that, huh? I do.
LEADMALE:I do.
SUPFEMALE:There's something very appealing about Playing god.
OTHERFEMALE:That's how we think of you.
LEADMALE:I love having power.
LEADFEMALE:And it's inspiring to see that you don't abuse it.
SUPMALE:Uh, look I really need that recommendation.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, okay! You've suffered long enough.
LEADMALE:You got the recommendation.
LEADMALE:Uh I-i do? Yeah wrote it the day you asked me for it.
SUPMALE:It's right here.
SUPFEMALE:I don't usually show letters of recommendation to students, but this one's exceptionally well-written, and Well Here you go.
LEADMALE:Ohh! Oh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is beautiful.
LEADMALE:This is beautiful.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:I admit that I thought about not giving you a recommendation.
SUPMALE:Then I realized that wouldn't be fair.
OTHERMALE:It wasn't you that hit me.
OTHERMALE:Uh, no, no, no, it wasn't.
LEADFEMALE:It's not your fault your parents are the way they are.
LEADFEMALE:You know, in fact, considering what your parents are like, you're a remarkable fellow.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Now, when they came into the classroom, I realized that evolution sometimes takes a detour.
OTHERFEMALE:We're all descended from apes, but not quite as directly as you.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco Sorry about flying off the handle earlier.
SUPMALE:My, uh, my wife and I were talking out there, and we reminded each other what this evening is all about and how much it means to this family.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:We're defrosting some steaks.
LEADMALE:Should be ready in about 20 minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Yummy.
LEADMALE:No, mom.
SUPMALE:No steaks tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight We're having chicken.
OTHERMALE:No, Alex, remember? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco had chicken for lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I don't care what Mr.
LEADMALE:tedesco had for lunch, and, uh, this is what I think of his recommendation.
OTHERMALE:Alex, what are you doing?! I'm keeping my self-respect.
SUPMALE:I overrated you, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you were better than your parents.
SUPFEMALE:I was wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:tedesco, I-I don't feel like I'm better than my parents.
SUPMALE:As a matter of fact, if I grow up to be as good as they are, I'll be very proud.
LEADFEMALE:How conventionally sweet.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:I think we'd all appreciate it if you left our house now, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:tedesco.
LEADMALE:My pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Nice going, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You should've punched him.
SUPFEMALE:No, he shouldn't have.
LEADMALE:I think you handled the situation just right.
LEADMALE:Look, I know it wasn't easy for you guys to invite him over here for dinner tonight, and I know you did it for me.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:The evening didn't end up the way we thought it would, but at least nobody got hit.
SUPMALE:Alex, you're hard to figure.
LEADFEMALE:Right when I think I know you, you go and do something nice.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have the chicken.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:what is that? It's my geography project.
LEADFEMALE:It's a relief map of Sweden.
SUPFEMALE:That is Sweden? No.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a map.
LEADFEMALE:The actual country is much larger.
SUPMALE:That is a terrible map of Sweden.
LEADFEMALE:Where are your saunas? Where are your volvos? Why didn't I do this in my room? You're a Keaton, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:What does it mean to be a Keaton? You go the extra mile.
LEADFEMALE:What else? Perfection is my copilot.
SUPMALE:That's right.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:We got a lot of work to do here.
LEADMALE:This thing is totally unusable.
LEADMALE:Okay, we're gonna need eight strips of number two balsa wood.
OTHERFEMALE:We're gonna need 100 yards of corrugated paper.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna need 4 pounds of plaster of Paris and a herring.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Get that all together, give me a shout.
OTHERMALE:I'll have a look at it.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to help me? No, you have to take it from here, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just the idea man.
LEADFEMALE:It's here.
SUPMALE:My letter's here.
LEADFEMALE:I can't deal with it.
LEADMALE:Mallory, opening mail is a skill we all have to learn.
SUPFEMALE:"The Columbus express and the ed hanson agency "are pleased to announce that you've been selected "to be photographed in our annual mother/daughter modeling event.
LEADMALE:" I won.
LEADMALE:I won! Oh! I'm gonna be in the Sunday supplement! Look, there's a chance for a professional modeling contract, a $250 prize! This could be my big break.
SUPFEMALE:How did you win a mother/daughter modeling contest by yourself? Ever hear of mom? I sent in that great picture that dad took of us at the beach last summer.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a wait wait Wait a minute, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I was in that picture.
LEADFEMALE:I won! I won! I won the mother/daughter modeling contest! Whoa! Is that, like, $250 each? Do we split that or what? No.
LEADMALE:Relax, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I cut you out of the picture.
LEADFEMALE:I drew a a volleyball where your head was.
LEADFEMALE:Mom hasn't said anything about this.
SUPFEMALE:That's because she doesn't know.
OTHERMALE:It's a surprise.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, mom! Guess what? I won a mother/daughter modeling contest! I didn't know you'd entered.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we did.
SUPFEMALE:And we won.
LEADMALE:Isn't it great?! Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:A-are you saying you entered me in a contest without asking me? I didn't want to get your hopes up.
SUPFEMALE:This is the best thing that ever happened to me.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it great, mom? Aren't you excited? She looks thrilled.
LEADMALE:Alex A good model doesn't show her true feelings.
LEADMALE:She just smiles As if she doesn't have a thought in the world.
LEADMALE:Then, uh, you should make a great model.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:Yo, "yennifer.
LEADMALE:" Did you get that stuff I told you to get? Uh Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Except they didn't have that number two balsa wood you asked for.
LEADFEMALE:But the guy told me this stuff would work just as well.
LEADMALE:This? What is wrong with you, Jennifer? We can't use this.
LEADMALE:That is the last time I send you to the lumberyard alone.
OTHERMALE:Don't deny her her childhood, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, that's a good idea, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe some of it will leak into your brain.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, I've been reading these modeling instructions.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got it all planned out.
LEADFEMALE:I'll wear my white dress, and you can wear the black dress with the full sleeves.
OTHERMALE:Now, hold on, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I told you I didn't like it when you entered me in the contest without my permission.
SUPMALE:I don't want to do this.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? It's not something she wants to do.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that's funny, 'cause it says here mom's been working towards a modeling career her whole life.
LEADMALE:Alex, give me that.
LEADFEMALE:No! Mallory, I think it's important that mom read her own autobiography.
LEADFEMALE:Wait what autobiography?! "After a hard day of shopping for sweaters "with my gorgeous daughter, Mallory, "I hurry home to make sure "my husband's happy in his favorite chair with his robe, his slippers and his pipe"? Mallory, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:I don't smoke a pipe.
SUPMALE:Get a load of Mallory's biography.
SUPMALE:"I've always liked the simpler things in life Children, rain, cashmere.
LEADMALE:" Jennifer! Mallory, it is unbelievable that you would do this.
SUPMALE:You're right, mom.
SUPMALE:I shouldn't have done it.
LEADMALE:It's just that I really wanted to win, and you were so busy, I didn't think it would hurt.
LEADMALE:I'm really sorry, mom.
LEADMALE:I was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:I'm I'm glad you can see that.
LEADMALE:I do.
OTHERFEMALE:So will you do it? No! Why not? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I I'd feel silly.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying I'm silly for wanting to do it? All of you think I'm silly, don't you? I do.
SUPMALE:Thanks a lot, mom.
SUPMALE:Oh, honey, don't Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:She, uh, she seems upset.
OTHERMALE:I better go talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes only a brother knows what needs to be said.
LEADMALE:Modeling.
SUPMALE:Pfft.
LEADMALE:I better go, too.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes only a sister knows what needs to be said.
SUPFEMALE:Modeling.
LEADMALE:I'll have to fake it.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse Maybe you should think about giving in on this one.
OTHERFEMALE:Steven, she entered me in a contest without asking me.
LEADFEMALE:Then then she wrote these phony biographies.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Obviously, Mallory's gotten carried away.
LEADMALE:But at least she she She's taking some initiative, showing some enthusiasm.
LEADFEMALE:I've always wanted her to care about something.
LEADMALE:I always hoped it'd be physics instead of fashion.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, they both start with a "fff" sound.
SUPMALE:I'm not a model, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Models get so carried away with their outfits and and tossing their hair.
LEADMALE:It's just not me.
SUPMALE:It's just one day.
SUPFEMALE:It would mean so much to her.
OTHERMALE:I guess it couldn't hurt.
LEADMALE:Oh! 
SUPMALE:Beautiful, beautiful.
OTHERMALE:I love it.
LEADMALE:Who's the mother? Who's the daughter? I can't tell the difference.
LEADFEMALE:This is great, mom.
LEADMALE:Isn't this your idea of heaven? Yeah, well, I always pictured a larger room.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, mom, Mallory.
LEADMALE:I'll be back in a couple of hours to pick you up.
LEADMALE:Got to get dad from the dentist.
LEADMALE:Or I could wait around.
SUPMALE:Dad can hitch.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton girls, am I right? That's us.
LEADFEMALE:What did I tell you? Ed hanson.
LEADMALE:I recognize you from your pictures.
OTHERMALE:Ed hanson.
LEADFEMALE:What did I tell you? Here.
OTHERMALE:My agency is cosponsoring this event.
SUPMALE:Wow, you own your own agency.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:I think we're almost ready for you.
OTHERMALE:Come on, follow me.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't this great, mom? I already have an agent.
LEADFEMALE:Remember no frowning, grimacing, pouting.
SUPMALE:And above all, don't smile.
SUPMALE:That causes more wrinkles than anything.
SUPFEMALE:But, mom, what if they want me to smile for the camera? A high-fashion model never smiles.
LEADFEMALE:She holds her head steady and looks straight at the horizon.
OTHERMALE:You know you have beautiful eyes? Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Your nose and mouth are no slouches, either.
SUPFEMALE:Not that I've ever seen that mouth smile.
SUPMALE:Was that a smile? I think it was.
LEADFEMALE:Heather.
LEADMALE:What did I just tell you? No laughing, no smiling.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:This must be your sister.

OTHERFEMALE:Sounds like good exposure.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, bundle up.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm on my way.
SUPMALE:Quiet night by the hearth? I tried to call you for hours.
LEADMALE:Was the phone off the hook? Mnh-mnh.

SUPFEMALE:What? Is that what you think I was doing in there? I just happened to be in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:I was minding my own business.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and in the middle of shooting, you just happened to yell, "run for your life! The house is on fire!" Slipped out.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you're acting like a 9-year-old.
SUPFEMALE:Obviously, something is bothering you.
OTHERMALE:Please tell me what it is.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, I'll tell you what's bothering me.
OTHERMALE:I'm the one who wanted to be a model, and you stole that away from me.
SUPFEMALE:Now I'll never be one.
LEADMALE:I didn't steal anything from you.
LEADFEMALE:If you hadn't been there, they would have chosen me to be the proper penguin lady.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe not the proper penguin lady, but at least the proper penguin daughter.
SUPMALE:I didn't want to get into this to begin with.
LEADMALE:You dragged me into it.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe so.
OTHERFEMALE:But once you were there, you certainly enjoyed it.
LEADMALE:Why does it matter so much to you that I enjoyed it? Because you forgot about me.
LEADFEMALE:It's supposed to be my big, shining moment And everyone was shoving me aside.
LEADMALE:You didn't even care.
LEADFEMALE:It's like I didn't exist.
LEADMALE:Honey, I-i didn't realize I hurt you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you were too busy with your makeup and your lines and your penguin friends.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't have time for me.
SUPMALE:I always have time for you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a mother first and a penguin lady second.
LEADMALE:Don't tell your father.
LEADFEMALE:Why did you do it, mom? You knew how important it was to me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I guess I got carried away.
OTHERMALE:All that fuss, all that a-attention.
LEADMALE:It was flattering.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I just didn't stop to consider your feelings.
LEADMALE:Everyone else has something they're good at.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted to be good at something, too.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you're good at lots of things! Oh.
LEADMALE:They're not the things that anyone thinks are important.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes I feel like such an outsider.
LEADMALE:Honey, it's true, maybe, that that different things are important to you, but it shouldn't make them any less valuable.
OTHERMALE:Then why does everyone always make fun of the things that I like? If that's what's happening, I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:We should be much more aware of your feelings.
LEADFEMALE:Especially me.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey.
SUPFEMALE:I should apologize, too.
OTHERMALE:It was pretty childish of me to ruin your commercial.
LEADMALE:You were good, too.
LEADFEMALE:I would have been good, too, though.
LEADMALE:I mean, I have everyone's lines memorized.
OTHERFEMALE:Even sir penguin's.
LEADMALE:You did? I was tied up at work.
SUPFEMALE:Traffic was awful.
LEADFEMALE:How am I supposed to cook an impressive meal for 8 important friends in 20 minutes? What about the proper penguin? Well, thank you, sir penguin.
SUPMALE:Well, hey.
LEADMALE:How'd the filming go? Okay.
SUPMALE:Just okay, and you're hugging like that? Dad bowled a 200 game.
LEADMALE:You don't see me slobbering all over him.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:But you did spike the bowling ball.
SUPFEMALE:So, mom when's the next assignment? Uh I'm not gonna do any more modeling.
LEADMALE:What? I thought you said it went okay.
LEADMALE:Did they make you eat that penguin food? Mom, get get ahold of yourself.
LEADMALE:We're talking about a lot of money here.
LEADMALE:Some things are more important than money.
LEADFEMALE:Name one.
LEADMALE:Hello? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, ed.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, yes well Well, thank you, but I'm really not interested in doing any more modeling.
LEADMALE:But maybe my daughter is.
SUPMALE:She happens to be right here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Just be relaxed.
SUPMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:Calm down.
SUPMALE:Be yourself.
SUPMALE:Bonjour
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:I don't know, Gus.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should have started the "giants of the white house" series with a more colorful person.
SUPMALE:I told you that before we started, Steve.
LEADMALE:I know, but I've always liked Calvin coolidge.
SUPFEMALE:But the way you've cut it together here, you make him seem so unexciting.
OTHERMALE:God did that, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:Just who do you think's gonna watch a show like this, anyway? I don't know, uh, relatives, shut-ins, people who are heavily sedated.
LEADFEMALE:Program notes are on your desk, Steven.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks, stace.
LEADMALE:Listen, I just thought it might be interesting to learn more about coolidge the man.
OTHERMALE:It's the 50th anniversary of his death this year, I wanted to do something special.
SUPMALE:That's all.
SUPFEMALE:Send a card.
LEADFEMALE: Come on.
LEADMALE:I think your idea's great, Steven.
LEADMALE:And ideally it could be the best of all possible worlds, entertaining, educational, controversial.
SUPMALE:And a winner in the ratings.
LEADMALE:Remind me to give you a raise.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll take it out of Gus' salary.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you know me I think all your ideas are brilliant.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, take it easy, Stacey.
SUPFEMALE:I have a wife and kids to support.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to get carried away.
LEADMALE:It's just, well, I think Steven is great.
SUPFEMALE:That's all.
LEADFEMALE:Kid's got a head on her shoulders.
LEADFEMALE:What she's got is a big crush on you.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't be ridiculous.
OTHERMALE:She was in here a minute and a half, and she touched you seven times.
LEADMALE:I counted.
SUPMALE:That's the way young people are today, Gus.
SUPFEMALE:They're demonstrative.
LEADMALE:They touch.
LEADMALE:That's a touch every 13 seconds.
SUPFEMALE:Whoo! That's tough even for an octopus.
OTHERMALE:It was nothing more than a show of respect.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, no, no, no, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:This is respect "good job, Steve.
LEADMALE:" Way to go on that coolidge idea.
SUPFEMALE:"Hang in there, pal.
OTHERMALE:" Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Now, this is what she did.
SUPFEMALE:Gus, please! This is, uh, a place of business.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you, Steve, I recognize that look in her eye.
LEADFEMALE:Enough, okay? Okay, okay.
SUPFEMALE:One.
OTHERMALE:Am I interrupting anything? Uh, no, no, not at all.
LEADMALE:Don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, we were just talking about men, women Sex.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Let me pull up a chair.
OTHERFEMALE:Two, three, four and a half.
SUPFEMALE:What? Uh, nothing, nothing.
LEADMALE:Just, uh, practicing counting.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:So, what'd I miss? Well, we were discussing the kind of men that women find attractive.
LEADMALE:Oh, good subject.
LEADMALE:Um, I don't think a man can be really, really attractive until he's, oh, about, uh, 40.
LEADMALE:How old are you, Steve? I'll be, uh, 40 this year.
LEADMALE:Well, there's a perfect example.
SUPFEMALE:Steven is probably the most appealing guy I know.
SUPMALE:Man over P.
SUPFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE: Stacey Hughes.
SUPFEMALE:Got to go.
SUPFEMALE:Mwah.
LEADMALE:Gus? Six touches, one minute flat.
SUPMALE:Could be a new world record.

LEADFEMALE:Aah! It was Alex's fault.
LEADFEMALE: It was Mallory's fault.
LEADFEMALE:Look, all right, it doesn't matter whose fault it is.
LEADFEMALE:Just clean it up! And send out for pizza.
SUPFEMALE:Tough day at the office, mom? It's a little frustrating, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:Want to talk about it? Well, it's just a matter of getting used to things, I guess.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, being back in an office situation, there's bound to be some pressures, some adjustments.
SUPMALE:How does that make you feel? A little depressed.
OTHERMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
SUPFEMALE:Go with that thought.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when I was a teenager, about 14, 15 years old Why am I telling you this? Alex, will you stop faking interest in mom's feelings and help us clean up here? Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, I'm her eldest child.
LEADMALE:I'm her first-born.
LEADFEMALE:I'm her son.
OTHERMALE:There is a bond between us That the two of you could never break.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, help your sisters clean up or you're grounded for a week.

LEADFEMALE:I think I've had enough.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Want to talk about it? Steve.

OTHERFEMALE:On behalf of Alexander Graham bell and the entire bell family, I am personally offended by the level of your conversation.

SUPFEMALE:Sorry, Steven, didn't realize it was so important for you to go out tonight.
LEADFEMALE:It's not.

SUPMALE:Was dad just drafted? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:It was getting late.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know if you were coming.
SUPMALE:I wasn't sure either, but I figured, you know, the documentary and everything, so I Got in my car Drove around the neighborhood for two hours, and here I am.
LEADMALE:Well, Steven, we can go through the charade of working on the film, or we could just stand around here awkwardly some more, or We could go right back to my place and make love.
LEADFEMALE:C-could you run down those options one Steven, are you attracted to me? Very much.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then come home with me.
LEADMALE:We'll forget about everything and everybody else in the world, just for a few hours.
SUPMALE:You and I will be the only two people.
LEADMALE:Nobody ever has to know.
LEADFEMALE:Come home with me, Steven.
LEADMALE:I have a home, Stacey.
OTHERFEMALE:It means a lot to me.
LEADMALE:I don't want to risk losing it.
LEADFEMALE:I promise you we won't get caught.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not worried I'm not worried about getting caught.
SUPFEMALE:I'm worried about violating the core of love and trust I've built my life around.
LEADFEMALE:G-getting caught's not good, either.
LEADMALE:Steven, all I want to do is share a moment with you.
LEADMALE:A beautiful moment, one that we can both file away and keep forever.
OTHERMALE:It's got a nice ring to it.
LEADMALE:Just think of it this way We work together, laugh together, share a lot.
LEADFEMALE:If we share our bed, too, why is that so different? For one thing, we'll be lying down.
LEADMALE:Well, not necessarily.
SUPMALE:Is it getting hot in here? We could open a window or knock down a wall.
LEADFEMALE:Steven.
SUPMALE:Stacey, I'll be honest with you.
OTHERFEMALE:The idea of going back to your apartment with you right now is very, very Uh, thought-provoking to say the least.
SUPMALE:You're a wonderful person.
LEADFEMALE:I'm very attracted to you.
LEADMALE:But but Steven, I understand your feelings, and I respect them.
LEADMALE:But if your feelings for your wife and your family are as strong as you say they are, then how can anything we do threaten them? Because I can't view my life as a series of unrelated episodes.
LEADFEMALE:Everything I do affects every part of me.
LEADFEMALE:We would be so good together, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:It can't happen, Stacey.
OTHERMALE:Well, the apartment's a mess, anyway.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:It's all right.
OTHERMALE:The maid comes tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:That's that's not what I meant.
LEADFEMALE:I Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well What do we do now? How 'bout a hug? Hmm? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:The irony is beautiful, isn't it? The thing that I love most about you is the thing that's keeping us apart.
LEADMALE:You are so damn honorable.
SUPMALE:I'll walk you to your car.
SUPFEMALE:You're not gonna try anything, are you? Stace, I Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now, it's very simple.
LEADFEMALE:See, each of us has a 60-minute period in which he or she can use the telephone.
LEADMALE:That way no one can monopolize it for the whole evening.
LEADFEMALE:All right, now, this chart maps out everyone's time period.
OTHERMALE:I just have one small problem with this.
SUPMALE:What is it? My phone time is an hour past my bedtime.
LEADFEMALE:This chart is business, Jennifer, your bedtime is a personal matter.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, I'm tired of your charts.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tired of you bossing me around.
SUPMALE:I'm tired of you telling me when I can and can't use the phone.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm tired of you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Just what are you trying to say, Mallory? Oh, hi, kids.
SUPMALE:Where's your mother? Oh, she went to bed early.
LEADFEMALE:Speaking of bed, Jennifer, shouldn't you be in one? It's 10:00.
OTHERMALE:I, uh, um, didn't want to go to bed without saying good night to you, dad.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Mwah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you're home.
LEADMALE:So am I.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you can settle a little dispute for us, dad.
OTHERMALE:I will not have my communication governed by one of your silly charts.
SUPMALE:A 45-minute discussion about somebody's leg warmers.
LEADFEMALE:You call that communication? Who asked you to listen to my phone conversations, anyway? Mallory, the human eardrum is designed to pick up any sound within a certain radius, no matter how inane that sound may be.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, Alex! Yeah, dad? I love you both very much.
LEADMALE:You feeling okay, dad? I feel great.
LEADFEMALE:Just great.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good night.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, good night.
LEADMALE:Sleep well.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, Mallory I love this house.
SUPMALE:What a great kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:Love these plates.
LEADFEMALE:You really can see your face in here.
LEADFEMALE:So this is what you do after I go to sleep at night.
SUPFEMALE:Oh Elyse! I thought I heard voices.
LEADFEMALE:I-I didn't realize it was just you and a plate.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I'm glad you're awake.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:What about? You know what I was doing while I drove home from the station? Watching the road, I hope.
LEADFEMALE:Counting Counting all the times you and I have stayed up all night nursing one of the kid's fevers.
LEADMALE:Guess how many.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't begin to.
LEADMALE:Well, go ahead, try.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:How'd you know? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I guess after all our years together, I-I can read your mind.
SUPMALE:Guess you can.
LEADFEMALE:What am I thinking now? You're thinking there's no place like home? You're very good at this, you know? Set up a booth on the boardwalk.
LEADMALE:And you're thinking about our life together and and everything we've been through.
SUPMALE:And how hard it would be to turn your back on that, however tempting it might be.
LEADFEMALE:Has it been that obvious? The words "open book" mean anything to you? Sorry, Elyse, I've been acting like a real child.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, you haven't.
LEADMALE:You you've been acting like a grown man facing midlife.
SUPMALE:I-I'll probably act the same way when I get to be your age.
OTHERFEMALE:Why didn't you stop me, Elyse? What would I have gained by that? I I mean, our Our entire relationship is based on trust.

LEADFEMALE:This week, every minute, every second is precious.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be so melodramatic, Alex.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal about studying for midterms? Why don't you try it sometime and find out, Mallory? Alex, Mallory's been making great strides this year in her schoolwork.
OTHERMALE:Didn't you say you thought you'd get a 'b' in biology this term? I did say that.

SUPMALE:It's illegal for anyone else to take them.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:You took one yourself, a couple of months ago, when you were on that diet.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:And it was you that talked me out of taking any more.
LEADFEMALE:You said they were dangerous and that drugs weren't the solution to anything.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Throw that up in my face.
SUPMALE:Look, Mallory, you know me well enough to know I am not gonna abuse the pills.
SUPFEMALE:I probably won't even use 'em.
LEADFEMALE:They will sit on my shelf, and I won't touch 'em.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'll talk to effie tomorrow.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Not tomorrow, tonight.

LEADFEMALE:Uh, I-i thought you had a lot of work to do? Well, dad, I was thinking.
LEADMALE:You know, term papers and exams come and go, but the family unit is the one true constant in life.
LEADMALE:The precious hours spent in the familiar abode, with loved ones, playing a heartwarming game such as this, are what make memories that one can treasure for all eternity.

LEADFEMALE:She's his date, Steven.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:Yes, it it c-certainly is nice to meet you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:I'll say.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, you kids want to dance? - We'll just roll back the rug.
LEADMALE:Nope.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:You think so, Steven? Are you talking to me? Oh, no, no Uh, no no dancing for us.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, uh Good night.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:You say people do that for fun, huh? Oh, Alex, don't be so hard on yourself.
LEADMALE:I think you did very well For a first-time skater.
OTHERFEMALE:Lorraine, I told you, that's not my first time.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been taking lessons for years.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just the first time they let me out on the ice, that's all.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, how about a movie tonight? "Wild strawberries" is playing at the fjord theatre.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No, Lorraine.
SUPFEMALE:No more Swedish movies.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody's always depressed, and it's always dark out and snowing.
LEADMALE:And nobody ever says what they mean.
LEADMALE:Well, what kind of movie do you like? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Take, uh, take "conan the barbarian.
SUPMALE:" Oh, come on, Lorraine.
SUPFEMALE:That was a great movie.
LEADFEMALE:Look, at least you knew who conan was.
LEADMALE:You know, you knew he was a barbarian.
SUPFEMALE:You knew his friends were barbarians.
LEADMALE:And you knew he wasn't gonna walk into a dark restaurant and order fish.
LEADMALE:Alex, Swedish films are meant to be symbolic.
LEADFEMALE:When the priest ordered fish, it meant that he still had faith, that his life still had meaning.
LEADMALE:You see, the sea is the origin of life.
SUPMALE:I'm not that good at symbolic thought.
OTHERMALE:You know, I need facts.
LEADMALE:I need figures.
LEADFEMALE:I need to see the bottom line.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex, there's more to life than just the bottom line.
SUPFEMALE:There's beauty for its own sake.
SUPFEMALE:There's there's poetry.
LEADMALE:There's literature.
LEADMALE:There's dance.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Remember that play we saw That guy in tights? I-I learned a lot from him.
LEADMALE:Well, for one thing, I learned never to wear tights.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you, Alex, for putting up with my taste.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, put up? Lorraine I've I've had a great time the past two weeks.
LEADFEMALE:I have, too, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Really? I-I mean, y-you haven't minded that Well, that I'm not that much a man of the world? No, I've kind of liked it.
OTHERMALE:It's refreshing.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! Oh! Oh, my foot.
LEADMALE:Ah! Ah! It's starting to thaw out.
LEADMALE:Oh, here.
LEADFEMALE:Let me rub it for you.
LEADMALE:Ah.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Is that better? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Um, better.
LEADFEMALE:No, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's not the time.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have any idea when it'll be? I-I mean, my schedule's clear for six to eight months.
OTHERMALE:Alex, let's not complicate this.
LEADMALE:It's so nice the way it is With us just friends.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We're making a big thing out of nothing, right? Right.
LEADMALE:He's at her house again.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Does that bother you? - No.
SUPMALE:Does it bother you? - No, not at all.
SUPFEMALE:She's a friend of our son's.
SUPMALE:She's Alex's, uh Girlfriend.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:She's Alex's Full-grown, frenchwoman girlfriend.
LEADMALE:French As in I'amour.
SUPFEMALE:He has got to stop seeing her! That's what we'll tell him the minute he comes in! Hey, mom, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, what a day.
SUPMALE:Ice skating, Chinese food, sparkling conversation.
LEADMALE:She's the greatest.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm telling you, mom, I feel young again.
LEADMALE:M-maybe this wasn't the right time to tell him.
LEADMALE:Steven, this has definitely gone too far! They've had Chinese food together! We didn't have Chinese food together till we'd been married for two years! Let's just be thankful they haven't had Moroccan food together.
SUPMALE:Remember what happened the first time we had that? Hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:It's got to stop, mom.
LEADFEMALE:All we did was ask him how his old lady was.
SUPMALE:Girls, we'd like to talk to Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea let's get this thing out in the open.
SUPMALE:Alone? Well, we've never been so insulted in our lives.
LEADMALE:But hey.
LEADMALE:Shall we, Jen? They're such children.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, your mother and I have been talking.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, good for you.
OTHERMALE:Lorraine says talking is good for a relationship.
SUPMALE:Well, it's funny you should mention Lorraine.
SUPMALE:She's what we were talking about.
OTHERMALE:Oh? We think you should stop seeing her.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? - Alex You're 17 and she's 40.
LEADFEMALE:She is not 40.
LEADFEMALE:She'll be 40 in July.
LEADMALE:You don't see any of your old friends.
OTHERFEMALE:You're never home.
LEADMALE:You lapse into French for no apparent reason! Au contraire, mom.
LEADMALE:Alex, we we just don't want to see you get hurt.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, I'm not gonna get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:And there is nothing lurid about this relationship.
LEADFEMALE:She's my friend.
LEADMALE:I feel comfortable with her.
OTHERFEMALE:It's like being with you, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then spend more time with me.
LEADMALE:Don't judge Lorraine without knowing her.
LEADMALE:Let let me invite her over for an evening, okay? For dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Please? Okay.
SUPMALE:How's Saturday? Swell.
SUPMALE:Hi, Melissa.
LEADFEMALE:How's my little girl? Believe me, Alex, staring out the window won't get her here any faster.
LEADFEMALE:Ah! There she is.
SUPMALE:What'd I tell you? Uh, mom, Lorraine's here! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Dad, sit up.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Don't slouch.
OTHERMALE:Try and look like you've been to Europe.
LEADMALE:I'll go put on my lederhosen.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I can't believe you're gonna wear that.
LEADMALE:Why? Were you planning on wearing it? Good evening, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, Lorraine.
OTHERFEMALE:Welcome to chateau Keaton.
LEADMALE:Uh, you remember my mom and dad.

OTHERFEMALE:Home.
LEADFEMALE:O-our sunny home.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:It's a pleasure to be here.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, uh, tells us you're French.
SUPFEMALE:He's right.
LEADMALE:Alex, maybe Lorraine would like something to drink.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, would you care for an apÃ©ritif? Well, thank you, monsieur.
LEADMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:"Monsieur.
SUPMALE:" I love that.
OTHERMALE:Well, you take good care of her.
LEADFEMALE:I shall return.
LEADMALE:You are to be commended.
SUPFEMALE:He's been so beautifully brought up.
OTHERFEMALE:It's almost as if he's a throwback to another era.
LEADFEMALE:Turn of the century.
LEADMALE:There's something I must ask.
LEADFEMALE:I think I know what it is.
LEADMALE:Elyse, nobody is more surprised about Alex and me than I am.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm not too sure about that.
SUPFEMALE:My husband is gone, and Alex has turned out to be a great companion for me.
OTHERMALE:He's brought a certain joie de vivre that I don't think I've ever felt before.
LEADMALE:It's thrilling.
LEADFEMALE:That's the way joie de vivre is.
LEADFEMALE:Lorraine I'm happy that you've had a-a good experience You're a mother.
LEADMALE:You must know how I feel.
LEADMALE:Let me assure you that I have no designs upon Alex beyond friendship.
SUPMALE:Lorraine, you've been frank with us, so we'll return the favor.
SUPFEMALE:We feel that you're simply too old for Alex.
LEADMALE:Well, I-I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:It's nothing personal.
LEADMALE:He's letting his schoolwork slide.
LEADMALE:He doesn't see any of his old friends.
LEADFEMALE:We feel he should spend more time with someone his own age.
OTHERMALE:Well, you are his parents.
LEADMALE:And if you don't want me to see him, I will abide by your wishes.
LEADMALE:T-that doesn't mean you have to leave.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid it does.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:Steven, did we do the right thing? We had to do something.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Lorraine? She's gone.
LEADFEMALE:What do you What do you mean, she's gone? We told her how we felt.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid we hurt her feelings.
LEADFEMALE:Oh We didn't mean for her to leave, Alex.
LEADMALE:You know You didn't even give her a chance.
SUPMALE:You had no right to treat her that way! Alex, we apologize.
SUPMALE:I'm very sorry.
LEADFEMALE:"Sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:" What good is sorry?! You know, I'm I'm a man.
SUPMALE:You have to treat me like a man! Do you understand? You're gonna have to learn to let go.
OTHERMALE:Dinner is served.
LEADMALE:Of course, we can keep it warm.
LEADFEMALE:Be my Lorraine hello? Hi.
OTHERMALE:Do you have Glen gray's casa loma orchestra playing "tuxedo junction"? I'm only playing "sweet Lorraine" tonight, sir.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we're into the second hour of the first annual sweet Lorraine-athon.
LEADMALE:And here's the big band all-stars of 1944, with their very special interpretation of "sweet Lorraine.
LEADMALE:" I just found joy I'm as happy as a baby boy with another brand-new catchy tune.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:when I met w-where have you been? I've been calling you for four days.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I, uh, I guess you're angry about the other night.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm not angry.
OTHERFEMALE:I just needed some time to sort things out.
SUPMALE:What things? Alex, you're 17 years old.
LEADFEMALE:And I am almost 40.
LEADMALE:Does it make any sense at all for us to spend so much time together? Chronological age means nothing, Lorraine.
SUPMALE:Uh, a good friend of mine told me that once.
SUPMALE:I believed her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex, you mean so much to me.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't felt so alive in 20 years.
SUPMALE:Me either.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, 17.
SUPFEMALE:I know how you feel.
OTHERMALE:Your parents feel so strongly about this.
OTHERMALE:I feel uncomfortable going against their wishes.
LEADMALE:How do your parents feel about it? Who am I gonna go to Swedish movies with? And my ice skating was really coming along If I could just learn to stop.
LEADMALE:Well, we can still see each other from time to time.
OTHERMALE:But don't stop doing the things you used to do.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, you you mean I-i should date girls my own age? Yes, amongst other things.
LEADMALE:I just don't want you to stop leading the life of a 17-year-old.
SUPFEMALE:I've never led the life of a 17-year-old.
LEADMALE:Give it a try.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:everything that's beautiful everything that's good and true 
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:hi, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:You're home late.
OTHERMALE:Everything all right? The coach wasn't happy with the way we were playing.
LEADFEMALE:He made us all run extra laps.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that seems a little excessive, doesn't it? Did you have a chance to talk to him about it? We're not allowed to speak during practice.
LEADMALE:Now, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:This has gone too far now.
OTHERFEMALE:Something ought to be done about him.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Keaton.
LEADMALE:I told you to jog all the way home.
OTHERFEMALE:You walked the last half-block.
LEADFEMALE:Drop and give me 20! When you walk in this house, you're not the coach anymore! You're what you've always been An annoying human being! You know, I don't know why I put up with this.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, if being a coach is so painful for you, why don't you just resign? When Alex p.
LEADMALE:Keaton starts something, he finishes it.
SUPFEMALE:I am turning these raw rookies into baseball machines.
LEADMALE:Alex, they're just young girls.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, they they come in as young girls They leave as men.
SUPMALE:Count me out, Alex.
LEADMALE:Wasn't skippy with you? Yeah, he was right behind me.
SUPMALE:Sorry I lagged behind, guys.
LEADFEMALE:This bag weighs a ton.
LEADFEMALE:You all right, skippy? Yeah, I'll be fine, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I didn't realize how strenuous it is being team equipment manager.
OTHERMALE:Mom, do you remember where I put that Sweater That's probably in my room anyways? Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:I'd get up, but I seem to have lost all sense in the lower part of my body.
SUPMALE:Great, now it's a perfect match for the upper part.
SUPMALE:Alex, why don't you get skippy something cold to drink? No, no.
LEADMALE:Don't go to any trouble.
LEADMALE:Maybe if Mallory sat next to me and soothed my weary brow.
SUPMALE:I'll get you a glass of water, skippy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll help you carry it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Oh, hi, Arlene! Come on in.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's okay.
SUPMALE: Hi, Arlene.
SUPMALE:Skippy, mom says if you're not home in five minutes, she's feeding your dinner to the Guinea pigs.
LEADMALE:That mom, what a card.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What ya doing, Jennifer? Washing your baseball mitten? It's called a "mitt," Arlene.
LEADFEMALE:I was wondering if you wanted to come over and help make dresses for my turtles.
LEADMALE:Can't.
LEADFEMALE:How come? Softball practice.
LEADMALE:Again? You're always practicing.
SUPMALE:Aren't you good yet? You gonna be able to make it home okay, skip? No, I don't think it's safe for me to be moved right now.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, we gotta go.
LEADMALE:Mom's in one of her moods.
LEADMALE:Well, why didn't you say so before, Arlene? Uh, goodbye, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Parting is such Sweet sorrow.
LEADMALE:She's probably too choked up to speak.
LEADMALE: Bye, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Bye, Arlene.
LEADMALE:Take care of yourselves.
SUPFEMALE: Bye, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Jennifer, you were so rude to Arlene.
LEADMALE:And you were rude to skippy.
SUPFEMALE:Arlene's used to it, mom.
LEADMALE:Skippy enjoys it.
SUPMALE:You're never nice to Arlene.
LEADFEMALE:She's such a sweet little girl.
SUPFEMALE:She only wants to be your friend.
LEADMALE:It wouldn't have hurt you to go to her house tonight.
LEADFEMALE:It might've been fun.
SUPFEMALE:We have nothing in common.
LEADMALE:She doesn't know anything about sports.
SUPFEMALE:She thinks a slam dunk's something you do with a doughnut.
LEADMALE:Face it, Jennifer, it's the curse of the handelmans.
LEADFEMALE:The only escape is running or hiding.
LEADMALE:Course, these things should be done in as nice a manner as possible.
SUPMALE:I got it! I got it! I got it! Hello! Yes, he's here.
SUPMALE:It's for you, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Next time, answer your own phone calls, okay? Hello? What?! Hey, you're scheduled to pitch.
LEADMALE:The team needs you, Tammy.
LEADFEMALE:Is it a question of more money? Yeah, yeah, okay.
SUPMALE:All right, goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, what's wrong? My best southpaw is moving.
LEADFEMALE:She's not gonna be here for the playoffs.
OTHERMALE:That's the fourth kid I've lost this week.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, the girls think you're working them too hard.
SUPFEMALE:Too hard? Hey, I cut back on their steroids, didn't I? I'm not complaining.
LEADMALE:It's just that some of the kids joined the team to have fun.
SUPMALE:Fun.
SUPMALE:What does fun have to do with it? Alex, it's only a game.
LEADFEMALE:Only a game.
LEADMALE:"Baseball is only a game.
LEADFEMALE:" You know, that's exactly how the Russians want us to think.
LEADMALE:Alex, why don't you just get yourself another southpaw? Well, what's a southpaw? A southpaw is a left-hander.
LEADFEMALE:So why don't they just call them left-handers? Well, that way the Russians would know what we meant.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, susie.
SUPFEMALE:How you doing? The flu.
LEADFEMALE:Nancy and Becky, too? Hey, I instructed you not to have that pajama party last week.
LEADMALE:So you're not gonna play? None of you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, all right.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Feel better.
SUPMALE:They're not going to play? That leaves us one player short.
LEADFEMALE:How could they do this to us?! Well, I'm sure they didn't get sick to inconvenience you.
OTHERMALE:You know, I'm not so sure.
SUPMALE:They have had an attitude problem from the word go.
LEADFEMALE:If we don't have 10 players, we'll have to forfeit.
LEADMALE:Well, Jennifer, winning isn't everything.
LEADMALE: It's the only thing.
LEADMALE:We'll we'll talk more about this later, huh? I've got to get to work.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm, could I get a lift, dad? I'm wearing these new shoes.
LEADMALE:They're not good for walking.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I always look for that in a shoe myself.
LEADMALE:Aah! Jennifer, want to walk to school together? I guess so.
SUPMALE:I have to go there, anyway.
LEADMALE:Arlene, you don't have a sweater or a jacket.
LEADFEMALE:It's cold outside.
OTHERMALE:Well, I had a sweater, but the obecks' dog took it from me.
LEADMALE:I guess I was too scared to ask for it back.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, I'll get you something of Jennifer's to wear.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer? Don't say no until I finish this thought.
SUPFEMALE:No! Jennifer, we've worked too hard this season to come up short.
SUPMALE:If Arlene plays, we'll have enough players and we won't have to forfeit the game.
LEADFEMALE:She hates sports.
LEADFEMALE:She's not going to play.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, she may hate sports, but, uh, she likes you, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:You can talk her into it.
LEADFEMALE:But, Alex Jennifer, it's for the good of the team.
LEADMALE:Ready, Jennifer? Of course she's ready.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you, Jennifer? You know, Arlene, you and I don't spend enough time together.
LEADMALE:Say, did you ever play any baseball? You make a lot of friends in the dugout.
LEADFEMALE:How's that batter coming, Alex? It's almost ready, dad.
LEADMALE:Is the griddle hot yet? All set.
LEADFEMALE:Okeydokey.
SUPMALE:I tried something different this time.
OTHERMALE:I think you might enjoy it.
LEADMALE:A little too heavy on the buckwheat? Well, don't throw it out.
SUPFEMALE:There's a loose brick in the fireplace.
LEADFEMALE:Why are we doing this, anyway, dad? Cooking is women's work.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, some of the best chefs in the world are men.
OTHERFEMALE:Like who? Chef boyardee.
LEADMALE:Uncle Ben! General mills.
SUPMALE:Where are they when you need 'em? You clean up.
OTHERMALE:I'll go tell your mother we're going out for breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, my knee really hurts.
LEADMALE:You just skinned it.
LEADMALE:It'll be okay.
OTHERFEMALE:How was practice, girls? I think I'm getting better.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you, Jennifer? Not really.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm trying, Jennifer, but I'm just not a jock.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, maybe you could help Arlene with her batting stance.
LEADMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:What's the matter? I keep tipping over.
LEADFEMALE:I'll meet you out there.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I gotta clean up this mess that dad made.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Arlene, I'll help you with your stance myself.
SUPFEMALE:Can't we take a break first? I'm really sleepy.
LEADMALE:There will be time enough for breaks after the big game.
LEADMALE:Wow, baseball's tough.
LEADMALE:Now, don't forget to choke up on that bat, bend those knees, keep those feet apart! And get the cap off your eyes.
LEADMALE:Okay, get ready.
LEADMALE:Here it comes.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you swing? That pitch was perfect! I'm afraid! You're throwing too hard! Don't be a sissy! Jennifer, I can't do this! Yes, you can.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to! But No buts! In a real game, the pitcher's gonna throw a lot harder, like this! Mom! Mom! Mrs.
LEADMALE:Schofield, please, be reasonable.
SUPFEMALE:Look, this is the championship game, and we're gonna forfeit without Charlotte.
LEADFEMALE:We can give her her medication between innings.
SUPMALE:That's the beauty of it.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm not saying that that 101 is normal, but it's 2 degrees lower than anyone else on the team.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal? She usually runs a little hot anyway.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hello? Hey, there.
LEADMALE:How's it going, Alex? Ah, hi, skip.
OTHERFEMALE:How's Arlene? Oh, she came home this morning.
LEADMALE:The doctor only kept her in the hospital overnight as a precaution.
SUPMALE:She's got a black eye, and one of her cheeks looks like she's storing nuts for the winter, but she's fine.
OTHERFEMALE:She's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, skippy.
LEADFEMALE:How's Arlene? It was a long night, Mallory And not a pretty one.
LEADFEMALE:None of us slept much.
SUPFEMALE:I can still hear the echo of my footsteps in the long, empty hallway, as I returned with yet another cup of black coffee to get me through the vigil.
SUPMALE:Must have been very rough on you, skippy.
LEADMALE:Call me "irwin.
SUPMALE:" Irwin.
LEADMALE:You know, she's not out of the woods yet.
LEADMALE:If only I could go back to the hospital and tell Arlene that you agreed to be mine.
LEADMALE:It's been a dream of hers forlong.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, skippy.
OTHERMALE:Elyse just told me that Arlene's home and everything's okay.
LEADMALE:Glad to hear it.
LEADMALE:You disgust me.
SUPFEMALE:That old handelman magic's starting to work.
LEADFEMALE:Skip I'm surprised you didn't think of this earlier.
SUPFEMALE:Having your sister maimed to boost your social life.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mallory.
LEADMALE:How's Jennifer? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I hope she's all right.
LEADMALE:Poor kid.
SUPMALE:She was so upset last night, she wouldn't even come down to dinner.
SUPFEMALE:She must feel terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:Good morning, honey.
LEADFEMALE:What a great day, huh? You're in a much better mood than I expected.
SUPFEMALE:Look, honey, you don't need to hide your feelings.
LEADMALE:We all feel terrible about what happened.
LEADMALE:It was an accident.
LEADMALE:Accidents happen.
LEADFEMALE:Kids get hurt playing softball all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Um, Jennifer, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:handelman said, uh, Arlene might like some visitors today.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's real nice.
LEADFEMALE:Say hi for me.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, what is wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me.
OTHERFEMALE:It wasn't me who walked into a baseball.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, can I talk to you a minute? Can't it wait until later? I really want to see the end of this.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, you're watching midget kickboxing.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but it's the finals.
LEADMALE:I think we should talk about what happened yesterday.
LEADMALE:You know, this whole thing wouldn't have happened if I wouldn't have asked her to join the team.
SUPMALE:Well, Jennifer, putting Arlene on the team was a very nice thing to do.
LEADMALE:You don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:When we were out in the back practicing, she told me all the pitches I was throwing were too hard, but I kept on throwing them hard Even though I knew she couldn't handle it.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to lose the big game because of her, so I had to try to turn her into Johnny bench in two days.
LEADMALE:That's why she got hurt.
LEADMALE:Well, honey, you're only 11 years old.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're not in the major leagues.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Arlene may not be exactly Johnny bench, but then you're not exactly, uh Who? Dave concepcion.
SUPMALE:Dave concepcion.
LEADFEMALE:Who's Dave concepcion? She never really wanted to play softball, mom.
LEADFEMALE:She only did it 'cause she wanted to be my friend.
LEADMALE:Do you think maybe you'd feel better if you, uh if you apologized to Arlene? I can't do that, dad.
SUPMALE:She really likes me.
LEADMALE:How could I look her in the eye and tell her what a rotten thing I did? Look, Arlene.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory's on her way over.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't you just try to look a little less healthy? Sorry.
SUPMALE:Next time I'll try to be more severely injured.
LEADFEMALE:You feel like another story? Not right now.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:Just one.
SUPMALE:Mom says I'm supposed to be resting.
LEADFEMALE:It'll take your mind off your troubles.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:"Brad dooley woke up" Uh, come in! Well, Arlene, how are you? Hi, Arlene.
LEADMALE:How are you feeling? I'm fine, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:The doctor says I can get up today if I want.
SUPMALE:It's just that when I try to, I get a little nauseous.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm afraid I'll upchuck.
OTHERFEMALE:You stay right where you are, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you move a muscle.
OTHERMALE:Here, Arlene.
LEADMALE:This is for you from all of us.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:So, how's it look for today's game, coach? Uh, not so good, Arlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody's got the flu.
LEADMALE:Kind of hoping for a miracle.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, don't you worry, though.
LEADFEMALE:You just relax.
SUPMALE:We'll get 'em next year.
LEADMALE:Is Jennifer gonna come over? Well, Jen Jennifer I mean, I'm sure she Dopey me, I completely forgot! Arlene's not supposed to have more than three visitors at a time.
OTHERMALE:That's the doctor's orders.
OTHERFEMALE:One, two, three, four, five.
LEADMALE:Oops.
LEADFEMALE:We can't have that, now, can we? What do you say you and I find something else to do while your parents and Alex console my poor, injured sister? You want to see my fossil collection? Not now, skippy.
LEADMALE:I'd like to let them age another few thousand years.
LEADFEMALE:It's a date.
SUPMALE:Can I come in? Sure, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Uh, you know I think skippy's right.
LEADFEMALE:Arlene shouldn't have too many visitors at once.
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we clear out and let Jennifer and Arlene talk, okay? We'll see you tomorrow, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you take care of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mallory, no girl has ever seen those fossils.
LEADMALE:You'd be the first! Thanks for coming over, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:You're welcome, Arlene.
LEADMALE:Cute.
LEADFEMALE:Your parents brought it.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.
LEADMALE:You're sorry? Yeah.
SUPMALE:You were trying to teach me how to bat, and I let the ball hit me in the face.
SUPFEMALE:That was my fault, Arlene.
SUPMALE:If I wasn't such a klutz, it never would've happened.
SUPFEMALE:You're not a klutz.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe just a little bit of a klutz.
SUPMALE:My mother says I trip over the lines in our kitchen linoleum.
OTHERMALE:But I kept thinking maybe if I could play sports, I might be a better friend to you.
SUPMALE:I wasn't such a very good friend to you, Arlene.
LEADMALE:I only put you on the team because they wouldn't let us play with only nine girls.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:You knew? I may be a klutz, but I'm not stupid.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really sorry you got hurt.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
SUPMALE:This has been the most fun I've ever had.
OTHERFEMALE:Including the hospital.
LEADMALE:It was exciting.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't even cry once.
LEADFEMALE:You're a lot tougher than I thought.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean you like me? Yeah, I do.
LEADMALE:Maybe you could play on the team next year.
LEADMALE:No, I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just no good at sports.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:We can still be friends.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean it? Give me five.
OTHERMALE:Maybe we could get together later in the week? Sounds good.
LEADMALE:We can make those dresses for your turtles.
LEADMALE:Kathy can't play.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:It's official.
SUPMALE:It's all over, skip.
LEADFEMALE:We lose.

OTHERMALE:Life's a funny thing.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, the girls from the team are here.
LEADMALE:Oh, great, great.
LEADFEMALE:Now I got eight more little hearts to break.
LEADMALE:Couldn't find another player, huh? You know, it's not fair, dad.
SUPFEMALE:We have worked all season, and for what? The championship game is in half an hour, and we're gonna have to forfeit.
SUPFEMALE:Has that been the only purpose in playing this whole season, to get to the championship? Is that all that counts? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What about the fresh air? The exercise? The thrill of competition? What about the fun? Alex, the team is waiting.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I don't know how to break it to 'em.
SUPFEMALE:Well, just give it to 'em straight, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:That's probably the best way.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, bring in the girls! Come on, let's go! Come on!

OTHERFEMALE:Arlene handelman hurt herself yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:She hurts herself every day.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, the important thing is that she's all right.
SUPMALE:But she, uh, she doesn't feel up to playing, so we're not gonna have enough players.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna have to forfeit.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, no! 
LEADFEMALE:Forfeit? I knew we never should've let that nerdy Arlene on the team.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah! Wait a minute! She's not a nerd! She's got a lot more guts and courage than Than Dave concepcion! Than any of us! And she happens to be a good friend of mine, so you better not knock her ever again.
SUPMALE:Okay, come on, girls.
SUPMALE:Hold those heads up high.
OTHERFEMALE:W-we've had a great year.
SUPMALE:We've, uh we've been in the fresh air.

LEADMALE:This year may be over, but But there's always next year.
LEADMALE:Right? Hey, what are you all sitting around for? We've got a championship game to play! What? Arlene, you don't have to do this for me.
LEADMALE:When I said we were friends, I meant it.
LEADMALE:You don't owe me anything.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not doing it just for you, Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:The team needs me, and I need the team.
LEADFEMALE:That's my sister! Whoa! Whoa, girls.

LEADMALE:You sure know how to pick them, dad.
LEADMALE:Thank you, thank you.
SUPMALE:Oh, this is the best ever.
OTHERFEMALE:It must have taken you a long time to pick this one out.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I knew this was the one for us the moment I backed into it with the car.
OTHERFEMALE:We get more things that way.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look, it's starting to snow! Oh, that's perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Snow on Christmas Eve.
LEADMALE:Mwah! What could be better? They can put a man on the moon, but they can't stop this white slop from falling out of the sky.
LEADMALE:Merry Christmas to you, too, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Take it easy with the merry christmases, will ya, ma? This holiday is a silly, sentimental farce.
SUPFEMALE:It's phony.
SUPMALE:People just pretend to have this so-called Christmas spirit.
LEADMALE:We can't all have this natural yuletide verve that you possess.
LEADMALE:Did you remember to get the cough syrup for Jennifer? No, I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:I'll, uh I'll get it tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow's Christmas, Alex.

LEADFEMALE:Look, sorry I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
SUPMALE:If this thing gets any worse, I'll, uh I'll take you to the emergency room myself.
LEADMALE:All right, but don't try to count that as my present.
LEADFEMALE:Can't beat the present he gave me last year.
OTHERMALE:I gave you a present last year? Yeah, you took the garbage out for me.
SUPFEMALE:Right, right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh Don't expect any of that sloppy sentiment this year.
SUPMALE:Oh, that reminds me.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I know it's kind of late, but can we make an arrangement here? Uh, I say we don't exchange gifts this year, huh? How about it? That's a heartwarming thought, Alex, but, uh, we've already got our gifts for you.
OTHERMALE:Ah! You know, Alex, just because you're an old scrooge, why do the rest of us have to suffer? Because we're family, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:We do things together.

SUPFEMALE:What about me? All I ever hear about is how "daddy took me to the pony rides" and "daddy took me to the movies" and and "daddy" this, and "daddy" that.
LEADFEMALE:And what do I do? I'm the one who makes him do his homework and brush his teeth and eat asparagus.

OTHERMALE:Just think what their honeymoon was like.
LEADMALE:I'd rather not.
SUPFEMALE:Just say they did get divorced.
SUPFEMALE:Who'd you want to go with? I'd get my own apartment and let them visit me.
LEADFEMALE:What about you? I'd get my own apartment building, let 'em rent from me.
LEADFEMALE:I never dreamed that it would come to this, that he would dare.
SUPFEMALE:He was upset, angry.

SUPMALE:See how easy that was? You've always been on Richard's side, haven't you, Steven? I'm not taking Richard's side.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not taking sides at all.
LEADMALE:A-although when I when I spoke to Richard earlier, I You spoke to him? What did you say? Mm, nothing, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:All I said was that he shouldn't sit still and let you take Keith to San Diego.
LEADMALE:That's all you said? Why didn't you write a ransom note for him? We had a conversation, Elyse.
SUPMALE:He's my friend.
SUPMALE:Did you think you had any right to get involved in this? I think I had more than a right.
SUPFEMALE:I had an obligation.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, as a man? No.
SUPMALE:As a woman? No.
LEADFEMALE:As a friend.
LEADMALE:I felt sorry for him.
LEADFEMALE:He's been through a horrible divorce.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't exactly a fun divorce for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't even get an award out of it.
LEADMALE:Look, he needed to talk.
LEADMALE:He was lonely.
LEADFEMALE:He was depressed.
LEADMALE:He was broke.
LEADMALE:He didn't even have money for gas.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Then they can't get very far.
LEADMALE:I gave him money.
OTHERFEMALE:Steven, how could you give him money? I-I hope you realize that could make you an accessory.
SUPFEMALE:An accessory? Point of order, counselor Weren't you in the room when I gave him the money? That makes you an accessory once removed.
SUPMALE:You have no right to call me that, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Cynthia, I was only trying to console Richard.
OTHERMALE:I had no idea that he'd try to take Keith.
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Richard! Just a second.
SUPFEMALE:I-I'll get Cynthia.
LEADMALE:Oh wha Come on, Richard.

OTHERFEMALE:I'm confused as hell.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why I wanted to talk to you.
SUPMALE:What you're doing is crazy.
LEADMALE:Maybe.
LEADMALE:But there's no way I was gonna let her take him to San Diego.
SUPMALE:You're breaking the law.
LEADMALE:It's not about the law, Steve.
SUPFEMALE:It's about my feelings.
LEADFEMALE:It's about my life.
SUPMALE:What about Keith's feelings? What about Keith's life? What are you talking about? Look, I am doing this for Keith.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing for him, rich? Making him a fugitive? You have no money.
SUPMALE:You don't know where you're going.
LEADMALE:Leaving your job.
OTHERMALE:You're not doing this to help Keith.
LEADFEMALE:You're doing it to hurt Cynthia.
LEADMALE:Come on, Richard.
LEADMALE:Let's go home.
LEADFEMALE:You ever been to the, uh, pony rides, Steve? I think we should stop at home first.
OTHERMALE:I go every Sunday.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a regular.
SUPFEMALE:That's what divorced fathers do on Sunday.
OTHERMALE:You should see us there.
LEADMALE:Bunch of lonely guys dressed like our kids, trying to do the impossible.
SUPMALE:Trying to love against the clock.
LEADMALE:Waving as they come trotting toward us, and Drying our eyes when they make their turn.
OTHERMALE:We're a club.
LEADMALE:We ought to get jackets.
LEADMALE:We're Sundays fathers.
SUPFEMALE:Sundays fools.
LEADMALE:Coffee? Uh, oh, no.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:I-i came here to talk.
SUPMALE:What do you want to talk about? I can talk about anything.
SUPFEMALE:You name the subject, and I'll talk.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'll have that coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Works every time.
SUPFEMALE:Do you want some pie with that coffee? You tell me.
LEADMALE:A little piece.
LEADMALE:Richard, why did you ask me to come here? You want you want me to say you're doing the right thing? That Cynthia drove you to this? That you have no choice? That I'd do the same thing in your shoes? Yes, that's pretty much what I want you to say.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I can't say that! Well, you just said it! I can't say it and mean it! You and Cynthia have got to talk this out.
LEADMALE:We're through talking, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:Now I'm doing this my way.
SUPMALE:Your way is not going to work.
LEADMALE:How the hell do you know so much about this, Keaton? I know you're making a big mistake, buster.
LEADMALE:And don't call me "buster," Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't call you "buster Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:" Well, I didn't say you called me "buster Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:" Can we stop this "buster Keaton" business?! I don't agree with what you're doing.
SUPMALE:I will not support it.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Thanks a lot, Steve.
LEADMALE:I'm glad I can come to you in my time of need.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go, Keith.
SUPMALE:Richard, you're doing something wrong.
SUPMALE:It's not wrong, Steven! You haven't lived this! You can't know how I feel.
LEADFEMALE:But I know what you're doing.
LEADMALE:You and Cynthia are at war, and you're taking prisoners.
SUPMALE:Bye, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:What's taking him so long? He's been gone for over two hours now.
SUPMALE:Try to calm down, Cynthia.
SUPFEMALE:You're not making it any easier on yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I know Keith isn't wearing a sweater.
SUPFEMALE:Richard never makes him wear a sweater.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Keith? What happened? The only thing I can tell you is that he's okay.
LEADFEMALE:He's not coming back? I tried.
LEADFEMALE:Richard wasn't listening.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:No luck, huh, dad? I tried, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I really tried.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I know you did.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what I was just thinking about? What? Lake hiawatha.
SUPMALE:I'm glad I didn't hazard a guess.
SUPMALE:Christmas, '79.
LEADMALE:Remember? We shared a cabin up there with the baileys.
LEADFEMALE:How can two people who loved each other so much They really did love each other.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I had the room next to them.
LEADMALE:They really did love each other.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, dad, I'm gonna be really sure when I get married.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll be rooting for you, son.
LEADMALE:I hope you'll be one of the lucky ones.
LEADMALE:You know, you are.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Sure, your mom and I fight once in a while, but, uh You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I am one of the lucky ones.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:No, I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:But I'm closer.
LEADMALE:No, I think I'm closer.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, I think it's my turn.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Just a second.
OTHERMALE:Alex, it's for you.
LEADMALE:Who is it? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Some girl.
OTHERMALE:I'll take it upstairs.
LEADMALE:You know, I could have gotten the phone.
OTHERMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:It was the stupidest fight.
LEADFEMALE:One of the all-time stupidest.
LEADFEMALE:You ready to make up? Real ready.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like it when we fight.
LEADMALE:Neither do I, but I love making up.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Oh, for crying out loud! Will you hang up the phone?! Steven, d-do you notice how we always seem to fight just before Richard and Cynthia come over? I guess we see a little of ourselves in them, and it scares us.
SUPFEMALE:They once had a wonderful marriage, and it's over.
OTHERFEMALE:We just got to keep working at it.
SUPMALE:You're a very persuasive guy, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Keith! Mom! 
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE: all packed up.
OTHERMALE:Everything going according to plan here? Yep.
LEADMALE:Pretty much under control.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I think it's a shame that you're gonna be in Washington on Alex's birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least I was with Alex on Washington's birthday.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, now, I'm not one to pat myself on the back, but I think it's a pretty good idea having a pre-birthday party for Alex.
LEADMALE:Too bad it couldn't be for someone else.
OTHERMALE:He's here! Oh! Okay, okay, uh, everybody hide! Come on, right there.
OTHERMALE:Shh.
LEADMALE:Here he comes.
SUPFEMALE:Shh.
SUPFEMALE:Shh.

SUPMALE: Oh! What's going on? Surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Surprise.
SUPMALE:Surprise.
LEADMALE:Surprise.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:A surprise party for me? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but I But I don't get it.
LEADMALE:This went off without a hitch.
LEADFEMALE:Your mom thought it'd be a good idea to have a little birthday party for you now, since I won't be back from the pbs conference until Saturday night.
SUPFEMALE:Here, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:We got you a cake.
LEADFEMALE:"Happy bar mitzvah, Martin.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, the bakery made a mistake.
SUPMALE:It was the thought that counts.
SUPFEMALE:This is really nice.

LEADFEMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:Hi, mom.
SUPMALE:Hi, mom.
LEADMALE:Hello, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Well I-I-i figured that since I am virtually an adult now, I-I could call you Elyse Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get dinner started.
SUPMALE:Alex, I asked you this morning to take the garbage out before you went to school.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, listen.
SUPMALE:Mom, uh, I've been thinking.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I have been taking out the garbage for many years now, and, uh, I think I've gotten all I can out of the experience.
LEADMALE:I've been grooming the minors to take over for me.
LEADFEMALE:So, now is the time da da da-da for the ceremonial handing down of the trash.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory? Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Nice try, Alex.
SUPMALE:Yeah, okay.
SUPMALE:Uh, I'll do it later, mom.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to put this stuff away.
LEADFEMALE:So, what did you do today? Ah, school, some other stuff.
SUPFEMALE:What other stuff? This, that.
LEADMALE:How does it feel, day before your 18th birthday? Fine.
SUPMALE:It was it was fine.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing special.
LEADFEMALE:Pleasant chatting with you.
LEADMALE:I'll get that.
LEADMALE:Mom! Mom, I'll get that.
LEADMALE:I'll get that.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hey, Ted.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing, pal? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, 18 tomorrow.
SUPMALE:How does it feel? Come on, Ted.
SUPMALE:It feels great.
LEADFEMALE:I have had the most incredible day.
SUPMALE:I can't even begin to tell you about it.
SUPMALE:Well, all right.
LEADMALE:Why don't I just come over now? Yeah, okay.
SUPMALE:I'll tell you all about it.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:See you later.
LEADMALE:Uh, see you later, mom.
LEADFEMALE:But, Alex, where are you going? I'm going over to Ted's.
SUPMALE:But we're It's almost time for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'm excited.
LEADMALE:What? It's the day before my 18th birthday.
LEADMALE:I-I feel like talking to someone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, before you go, I want to ask you about your birthday dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I made reservations at facudo's.
LEADFEMALE:Is that okay? Mom, ah I can't make it.
LEADMALE:Uh, Neil and Doug are gonna take me out for my birthday.
OTHERMALE:But the girls and I already planned this.
OTHERFEMALE:We're really looking forward to it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, come on, mom.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I can go out with you and the girls anytime.
LEADMALE:Well, where are they gonna take you? It's gonna be a big night, mom.
SUPFEMALE:We're going down to wheeling, West Virginia.
LEADMALE:Neil Neil knows this bar down there, the Camelot inn.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa! We're gonna go there, then afterwards we're gonna stay at Neil's brother's apartment down in West Virginia.
LEADMALE:Well, I-i don't know if I like this idea.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why not? Well, for one thing, wheeling is 100 miles away.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what does that have to do with anything? You let dad go to Washington.
LEADMALE:That's 431 miles away.
SUPMALE:Alex I don't like the idea of you going to a bar.
LEADMALE:I mean, I don't think it's appropriate for someone your age.
OTHERMALE:Mom, I'm gonna be 18.
LEADMALE:Look, the the West Virginia state legislature spent a lot of time and effort deciding that 18 is the appropriate age for this sort of thing.
SUPMALE:I don't think you should be second-guessing them.
LEADMALE:I don't care about the West Virginia state legislature.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, Alex, I'm your mother, and I have veto power over them.
SUPFEMALE:It's part of our system of checks and balances.
LEADFEMALE:My answer's no.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you know as well as I do, if dad were here, he'd let me go.
LEADMALE:I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:I have made my decision.
SUPFEMALE:What your father would or wouldn't do is irrelevant.
SUPMALE:I'll tell you what's irrelevant This whole discussion is irrelevant! Look, 18 is the legal age of adulthood, which means I now have the right to live my own life without having to clear it with you! No, sir! Not while you're living under this roof! Now, birthday or no birthday, you are not leaving this house tomorrow night, and that is final! Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Well, uh, let me tell you something.
LEADMALE:I am not Taking that trash out until I am good and ready.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh! How you doing, Alex? Great.
LEADFEMALE:Just, uh, just great.
LEADFEMALE:Happy birthday.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, some birthday.
LEADFEMALE:I'm stuck in the house because of some arbitrary edict handed down by a ruthless dictator who has no appreciation for the concept of adulthood.
LEADMALE:Many happy returns.
SUPMALE:Why is she doing this, Mallory? I don't know all the facts, Alex, but she must have good reason.
SUPMALE:I never heard you say that when you were grounded.
SUPFEMALE:Well, since it's you, I can be more objective.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, girls, could I have a few minutes alone with Alex, please? Sure, mom.
SUPMALE:Uh, were you able to get in touch with Neil? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, he was out all day.
LEADFEMALE:On top of everything else now, I have to face the guys in person and tell them I can't go to the bar because my mommy won't let me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if if you'd like, you can ask the boys if they would like to stay and celebrate your birthday with you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I made this cake, and I have ice cream.
LEADMALE:Are there gonna be pony rides, too? I'll let you handle this.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hey! Happy birthday, Keaton! Well, welcome to the big leagues, guy.
SUPMALE:Well, let's get a move on, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:The Camelot inn beckons us.
SUPMALE:Jousting, wenches.
LEADMALE:I called this girl I met last time I went down there Roxanne.
LEADMALE:She's meeting us and bringing a couple of friends.
OTHERMALE:I can't go.
OTHERMALE:What? I had a big fight with my mom, and she's making me stay home.
LEADFEMALE:On your birthday? Unbelievable, isn't it? Alex, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Do something.
LEADFEMALE:There's a beautiful girl in wheeling with your name on her.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Forget it, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:She's not gonna change her mind.
OTHERMALE:Just, uh Just go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good time.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to go without you But okay.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of ironic, isn't it? What? Well, I mean, your not being able to go with us tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, after all, this was supposed to be your big night.
SUPMALE:Your 18th birthday, your coming of age.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, guys.
LEADMALE:Not so fast.
LEADMALE:I'm coming with you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm 18.
SUPMALE:I can do what I want.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what about your mommy, Alex? Let me deal with her.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, unfair rules are made to be broken.
SUPFEMALE:That's the American way.
LEADMALE:Now you're talking.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:So is this a classy place or what? It's really elegant.
LEADMALE:Those are our dates.
LEADFEMALE:This is the greatest place I have ever been.
SUPMALE:Hey, Roxanne! I'm glad you remembered me when I called.
LEADFEMALE:How could I forget? It's not every day I meet someone in your line of work.
LEADMALE:Uh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I guess that's true.
LEADFEMALE:So, how did your space shuttle flight go? It was very enjoyable.
SUPFEMALE:These are my friends, Buffy and Christy.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Uh, please, sit down.
LEADMALE:Sit down.
SUPMALE:Two more excaliburs and a dragon's breath.
SUPMALE:I'd like you girls to meet a couple of young air force cadets under my charge.
LEADMALE:This is lieutenant lippman.
LEADMALE:Ladies.
LEADMALE:And this is colonel Keaton.
LEADMALE:Uh, how you doing? This is a big night for colonel Keaton, girls.
SUPFEMALE:Tomorrow morning at 0500 hours, he flies his first mission into hostile enemy territory.
SUPMALE:Really? Come on, Neil.
LEADMALE:Well, he's exaggerating.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:A little.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what do you mean? Well, I-it's it's It's not my first mission.
LEADMALE:It's It's my first solo mission.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and I'm going with him.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:What country are you attacking? Oh, uh Canada.
LEADFEMALE:We're not at war with Canada.
LEADMALE:Wait, are we? Are you scared? Tell me, Buffy, what place is there for fear in a struggle whose ultimate goal is nothing less than the survival of Liberty? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:So, are you scared? Let me tell you a little story about fear, buff.
OTHERMALE:Uh, about a year ago, I'm I'm up in my f-14 doing a test flight.
SUPFEMALE:I'm about 70,000 feet up.
LEADFEMALE:I had that puppy going mach 2.
SUPMALE:All of a sudden, the fan belt goes out on me.
LEADMALE:And you know something? Any other pilot in that situation might have felt fear.
LEADMALE:But, uh, not this guy.
OTHERFEMALE:No, sir.
SUPFEMALE: Uh, Alex.
LEADMALE:That's colonel Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I'm I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Colonel Keaton, I mean.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Your mother's here.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to come home with me.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me but the colonel happens to be my date.
OTHERFEMALE:The colonel? Uh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Maybe some other time.
LEADMALE:Tonight is a big night for him.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow morning, he's invading Canada.
SUPMALE:Oh, I see! May I have a word with you, please, colonel Keaton? Your orders have been radically changed.
SUPMALE:Um, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton? Would you please not tell my mom that you saw me here? Why is his mother here? Uh, she probably came down to wish him luck on his mission tomorrow.
SUPMALE:You had no right to defy me, Alex! I want you to leave with me right now! No.
LEADMALE:Mom, this is crazy.
OTHERMALE:Look, we can talk about this later.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow morning.
OTHERFEMALE:You're invading Canada tomorrow morning.
SUPMALE:Mom, I'm not leaving with you.
LEADFEMALE:No way.
OTHERMALE:You are coming home with me right now, young man, and that is final! Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Neil, Doug, ladies, I got to go.
LEADMALE:Have a safe mission.
LEADMALE:Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:He's still out there, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Is he gonna stay in the car all night? Well, he'll have to come in for breakfast.
OTHERMALE:Can't we just put a bowl out by the back door? You know, this is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:He didn't talk to me the whole way home, and now he won't even get out of the car.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna lower the resale value.
SUPFEMALE:M Jen, why don't we I'm with you.
LEADMALE:I'm with you.
LEADMALE:Mom I made a pact with myself never to speak to you again.
SUPMALE:But I've given myself permission to suspend it.
SUPFEMALE:Briefly.
LEADFEMALE:Because frankly, mom, the curiosity is killing me.
LEADMALE:How on earth can you possibly justify doing what you did to me tonight? Go ahead.
SUPMALE:I'm listening.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know! I know.
OTHERFEMALE:You're mad because I disobeyed you.
SUPMALE:Well, let me tell you something, mom I only disobeyed you because you were wrong.
SUPMALE:Without just cause or provocation, you denied me permission to do something I have every right in the world to do.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure, this is your house.
LEADMALE:And as long as it's your house, I got to live by your rules.
SUPMALE:Well, that used to be true.
LEADFEMALE:Not anymore, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'm an adult now.
LEADFEMALE:I got 18 years under this belt And my life is in my own hands.
LEADMALE:Have you anything else to say? I thought not.
LEADFEMALE:All right, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I think I've refuted all your arguments.
LEADMALE:Until you are ready to apologize to me, I am done speaking with you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I didn't realize you'd started speaking with me.
SUPMALE:What is that supposed to mean? For the past two days, Alex, you have complained to me, grunted at me, lectured to me, and presented me with ultimatums, but not once not not once have you even come close to talking with me.
LEADFEMALE:Semantics.
SUPMALE:Okay, mom.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:I haven't been very "chatty" lately.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't been a million laughs.
LEADFEMALE:That is not the issue here.
SUPMALE:The issue here is my right to live my own life without having you try and control it! You have every right to live your own life.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not trying to deny you that.
SUPMALE:Oh, no?! Oh, no?! Okay, then why did you drive in front of half the state of West Virginia? You had a few hours to kill? No, Alex.
LEADMALE:I did it because you defied me.
LEADFEMALE:And even more important than that, I did it because I was hurt and angry and fed up! About what? I've tried starting conversations with you, only to be politely dismissed.
LEADFEMALE:I've asked for you to help around the house and been ignored.
LEADMALE:You canceled out dinner plans that I had made without a moment's thought to m concern in the matter.
LEADFEMALE:I do not enjoy being made to feel like an intrusion and an annoyance in my own son's life! Okay.
SUPMALE:Look, mom.
LEADMALE:I'm I'm sorry that I wasn't more sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I guess I should have been.
SUPMALE:But I'm not used to thinking that way when it pertains to you.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I-i-i think of you as my mother, not not as a person.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I mean.
SUPMALE:Surprise, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I am a real person.
LEADMALE:Flesh and blood, real feelings! And maybe in In one sense, I was wrong not to let you go out with your friends.
SUPMALE:But if you want me to respect your rights as an adult, then you better start respecting mine! Okay, I didn't respect your rights, and you didn't respect mine.
LEADMALE:So, uh How do we figure out who's right and who's wrong here? There is no absolute right or wrong.
LEADMALE:It's my job as a parent to to set boundaries, and it's your job to negotiate to change them.
LEADMALE:When you were 7 years old, we got in an argument because you wanted to walk to school by yourself.
LEADMALE:I remember.
SUPFEMALE:I remember, and, uh I was right.
LEADMALE:And you let me go.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:But I followed you.
LEADMALE:And I hid behind trees and mailboxes to make sure you looked both ways and you crossed on the green.
OTHERFEMALE:Did I? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:In fact, when another kid tried to cross in the middle of the block, you made a citizen's arrest.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that was little Timmy dugan.
LEADMALE:I let him off with a warning.
LEADMALE:It's unbelievable to me, Alex That 18 years ago tonight, I had a baby boy.
LEADMALE:Me, right? Ever since that night, you've been trying so hard to grow up, and I've been trying so hard not to let it happen.
LEADFEMALE:Well, considering, uh We have been at cross purposes, uh I think we're doing all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, um I'm sorry that I've been treating you so rotten lately.
LEADFEMALE:Accepted.
LEADMALE:Sorry I ruined your dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, don't worry about it.
LEADFEMALE:I had to go to bed early anyway.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm attacking Canada in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:And happy birthday.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I-i Aw, mom.
SUPFEMALE:Don't start that stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I love you too, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Ah, it's getting pretty late.
LEADMALE:You coming up? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:In a second.
LEADMALE:Uh, there's something I got to do first.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to take this garbage out.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:don't be silly, Barbara.
SUPFEMALE:I told you yesterday he'll be no trouble at all.
LEADMALE:Ok, I'll see you Saturday.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPMALE:Who was that? That's my cousin Barbara.
OTHERMALE:She and dick are going out of town on Saturday.
LEADMALE:They wanted to know if we could baby-sit for little Kenneth.
LEADFEMALE:Why, are all the reform schools closed for the weekend? Steven, he's a perfectly well-behaved little boy.
LEADMALE:Elyse, we're talking about a kid who needed a police escort to nursery school.
SUPMALE:Come on, Steven, it will be fun.
SUPFEMALE:Alex and Mallory will be out of town.
SUPFEMALE:We'll have plenty of room.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, I have some very important work to get done on Saturday, plus I'm planning on watching the big Ohio state-Iowa game.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer and I will keep him out of your way.
OTHERFEMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:I just wish you'd consult me on these things first.
SUPMALE:I will from now on.
SUPMALE:I promise.
SUPMALE:It's not fair to impose on me.
LEADMALE:I mean, it is the weekend.
LEADMALE:You're absolutely right.
LEADMALE:I'm wrong.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, ok? Ok.
LEADFEMALE:I hope I wasn't too rough on you.
OTHERMALE:I hope Kenneth finds something in here he likes.
LEADFEMALE:This is all I could find out of Alex's old toys.
LEADFEMALE:He used to have a whole closet full.
SUPFEMALE:I think he sold the rest to an orphanage.
SUPMALE:Mom, will you talk to Alex, please? He says I can't go to Princeton with him this weekend.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I did not say that.
LEADFEMALE:All I said was that if she insists on tagging along to visit Jeff, she's going to have to abide by my rules.
LEADFEMALE:What rules? He told me I had to ride in the freight car.
LEADFEMALE:It is not a freight car.
SUPFEMALE:It's a baggage car.
LEADFEMALE:Alex! Look, I went to a lot of trouble to set up this interview with the Dean of admissions.
SUPMALE:This interview is pivotal to my future as a collegian.
LEADFEMALE:It is not a vacation junket for your personal amusement.
LEADMALE:Alex, we understand how important this interview is to you, but I think you ought to ease up on your restrictions a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I promise I will not annoy you for the entire weekend.
LEADMALE:How can I be so sure of that? You've never gone that long without annoying me before.
SUPMALE:I've never tried before.
LEADMALE:Look, Alex, I won't bother you.
SUPMALE:You won't even know I'm there.
OTHERMALE:Ok.
LEADMALE:What should we wear on the train? Something collegiate! Yo, Jeff! Wow, 305 This is the place.
OTHERMALE:Wow! This is great! I love college.
LEADMALE:"Alex, I'll be back about 2:00.
LEADMALE:Make yourself comfortable.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff.
SUPMALE:" Alex, Jeff is going to be so surprised to see me.
LEADFEMALE:Are we going to wait here for him? No, are not going to do anything, Mallory.
SUPMALE:I am going to get settled here, walk around the campus, then go to my interview.
OTHERMALE:I got to get mentally prepared.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even want to see you until after the interview is over.
SUPFEMALE:Is that clear? I saw a poster for a dance tonight.
SUPMALE:I wonder if Jeff will take me to that.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think he will? You're really starting to get on my nerves, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:I brought a nice dress with me just in case.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex! This is so exciting! Mallory Listen, Mallory.
LEADMALE:I would very much like to be alone right now, ok? Why don't you go downstairs? Find what room you're going to be in.
LEADFEMALE:Get yourself settled.
SUPFEMALE:I should be gone by the time you get back.
LEADMALE:Mallory Please, I beg of you.
LEADMALE:Go away.
LEADMALE:Ok, I'll go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, listen, if Jeff comes back, don't tell him I'm here.
OTHERMALE:I want to surprise him.
OTHERFEMALE:How's it going? Uh Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Where's, uh You know The little prince? Kenneth is outside playing quietly with Jennifer, just where he's been since he first got here.
SUPFEMALE:Ok, don't rub it in.
SUPFEMALE:He's behaving very well.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I overreacted the other day.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess the memory of Kenneth's last visit was still fresh in my mind.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, Kenneth's last visit was uneventful.
LEADMALE:The fire department didn't think so.
SUPMALE:Relax, get your work done.
SUPMALE:Pretty soon you'll just forget he's even around.
LEADMALE:Ah! Gotcha! What happened? Kenneth shot me.
OTHERFEMALE:What? He was playing, and he snuck up on me, and he zapped me with a toy space gun! Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Should I take you to the pretend hospital? Mom, can we go now? Go where? Don't you remember? Today's mother's day at my ballet school.
LEADFEMALE:All the mothers will be there.
LEADMALE:Don't go! I mean, uh Can't you go some other time? Tomorrow? I forgot all about it, but I promised her, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I have to go.
SUPMALE:I'll go get my stuff.
SUPMALE:Well, if you must go, would you please take Kenneth with you? What would Kenneth do at a ballet class? The same thing he does here Cause misery and human suffering.
LEADMALE:That's enough, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:You are overreacting to the whole situation.
OTHERMALE:Ok, you're right.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go, mom.
LEADFEMALE:Ok, I'll see you in a little while, honey.
LEADMALE:Let's hope.
SUPMALE:Bye, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, honey.
LEADMALE:Kenneth! Hi, cousin Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Kenneth, I have to take Jennifer to ballet class.
SUPMALE:You play nicely while I'm gone? Don't worry about me.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be fine here with good old cousin Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Good-bye.
SUPMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Cousin Steven? Yes, Kenneth? I'm sorry for scaring you with the space gun.
OTHERMALE:I accept your apology, Kenneth.
SUPMALE:I know you have a lot of work to do, so I won't bother you anymore, ok? Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:I appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go outside and play with some of those toys.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe when I'm done here, I'll come out, and we can toss the softball around.
SUPFEMALE:How does that sound? Great! I'll go warm up! See you later! I swear Yum dum dum bum bum bum bum take me out to the crowd buy me some peanuts And cracker Jacks Alex! Hey, Jeff! How you doing, buddy? Good to see you! Great to see you! Try to stay off my roommate's side.

LEADMALE:When's Jennifer getting back? Very soon.

LEADFEMALE:The buckeyes are down 16 to 12.
LEADMALE:Oh, can I watch dippy dog? Kenneth, no.
SUPMALE:Kenneth Please.
LEADMALE:This is the last play of the game.

LEADFEMALE:Kenneth, it's fine! Fine, really.
LEADMALE:The buckeyes line up in the power I formation.
LEADMALE:Stopwood calls the signals.
LEADMALE:Kenneth! Stopwood fades to pass.
SUPFEMALE:He's in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:He laterals to sobrenko.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna be over here! Sobrenko's at the 40! He breaks a tackle! At the 30! The 20! He's got one more man to beat! Go, go, go! Not you, Kenneth! Oops.

OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.
LEADFEMALE:How are you feeling? I want to die.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess you're not up for a game of gin rummy then, huh? What a weekend.
OTHERFEMALE:I ruined your interview, I lost my boyfriend, I made a complete fool of myself in the process.
LEADFEMALE:Never before have I acted so stupidly and so selfishly.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Sure you have.
LEADMALE:I'm kidding.
SUPMALE:I'm just kidding.
LEADMALE:Come on, cheer up, will you? So, uh How did you and Jeff leave things? Well, there wasn't a whole lot we could say to each other.
LEADMALE:I mean, we did agree to see other people.
LEADMALE:It was stupid of me to go up there this weekend.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you try to stop me? What? Kidding.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just kidding.
LEADMALE:It's good that you can laugh about it.
SUPMALE:Despair does funny things to a woman.
OTHERMALE:Listen, uh Mallory You lost a boyfriend today, a good one, and I know you're upset, but let me tell you something.
LEADMALE:You're a very special person.
SUPFEMALE:You got a good heart, you got a good sense of humor, you're attractive, and, uh You're a lot smarter than I usually give you credit for.
LEADMALE:So, uh Don't you worry, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:There are a lot of guys out there who'd consider themselves lucky to even meet someone like you.
LEADMALE:It's true, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what in the world just possessed me to say all that, but, uh It is true.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I don't understand it.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'm surprised you're not angry with me after what I did to you today.
LEADMALE:Mallory, what would be the point in getting angry at you now? You were broken-hearted.
SUPFEMALE:You were in a weakened state.

LEADMALE:I really learned a lot about myself today.
LEADFEMALE:What? I always thought that I knew myself, you know, what I wanted, how I wanted to get it, but apparently, I was wrong.

LEADMALE:I do not want to talk about her.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot believe she is out on a date.
SUPFEMALE:Phillip looked like a perfect gentleman.

SUPFEMALE:I have read articles about sex and older people.
SUPMALE:They retire to these little communities of condominiums.
LEADFEMALE:They They take folk dancing.

SUPFEMALE:Then they all go home to their hot tubs.
LEADMALE:There are a lot of grandmas and grandpas in hot water right now! Elyse, your mother is a grown woman.
LEADMALE:I'm sure she can take care of herself.
LEADMALE:She may be a grown woman, Steven, but she cannot take care of herself.
OTHERFEMALE:My father's always protected her! She's been married for 40 years.
SUPMALE:What could she know about sex? You know what I mean.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I-I-i am sure she is fine.
SUPFEMALE:It's after midnight.
SUPFEMALE:Why hasn't she come home? I think we should go to bed.
LEADMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too keyed up to sleep.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe, just maybe, we could think of something else to, uh Pass the time up there.
LEADMALE:Hmm? What, you mean now?! With my mother out?! We'll tell her about it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm I'm sorry, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:This whole business with my mother is really getting to me.
LEADMALE:Now, look, Elyse, she is practically a divorced woman.
LEADFEMALE:You have got to accept it.
LEADMALE:I could accept it a lot easier if I didn't have to watch mom go gallivanting off with the man who told her to rinse and spit for 20 years.
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, a-all right.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, oh, I will.
LEADFEMALE:Y-you too.

LEADMALE:I thought you were the milkman.
LEADMALE:You gave the milkman the key? Mom Just where have you been? What? I said, "where have you been?" That's what I thought you said.
LEADMALE:And the answer is, "what business is it of yours?" Well, we've got a big day ahead of us.
LEADFEMALE:Gotta get our sleep.

LEADMALE:You're only gonna have Well, that sounds like more than enough.
LEADFEMALE:Are you coming up? No, mom and I have some things to talk about.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be up.
OTHERMALE:All right, but all I'll wait is half an hour, then I've got to get to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get my 15 minutes a day, I'm worthless.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, do you mind telling me what this is all about? I've had a very busy evening, and I'd like to get some rest.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you would come home at a decent hour, you wouldn't be so tired now.
OTHERMALE:If I'd come home at a decent hour, I would have had to spend the evening arguing with you about the divorce.
LEADMALE:Oh, so rather than talk with your only daughter, you'd rather soak in some man's hot tub?! We did not soak in any hot tub.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I shouldn't have said that.
LEADFEMALE:The hot tub was too crowded.
LEADMALE:We went in the sauna.
LEADMALE:Maybe we'll use the hot tub next time.
OTHERFEMALE:Just what did you and this tooth-jockey do tonight? I am not going to subject myself to these questions.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a mature adult capable of taking care of my own life, and I'm going to do so whether you like it or not.
SUPMALE:Come to think of it, I remember you saying the exact same thing to me about 20 years ago.
LEADFEMALE:Wait just tell me, after all these years, how can you just go out on dates and be with men? Well, to tell you the truth, it isn't easy But it's all coming back to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Steven, we have a very serious problem on our hands here with my mother.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to figure a few things out.
SUPMALE:If you don't mind, I'd rather not be diverted by your idle chatter.
LEADMALE:Sorry I rambled on like that.
SUPMALE:It's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Did you and your mother talk? You you always take her side, don't you? What? Well, admit it, y-you've always liked my mother, haven't you? All right, I confess.
LEADFEMALE:I do.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Alex, it's just not going to work! Aw, come on, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:How do you know until you try? Some things you just know.
LEADFEMALE:What's the problem? Alex wants me to sell his class of '84 moustache wax to the 5th grade.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Jennifer, Jennifer! Jennifer, look.
LEADFEMALE:I told you, I'm willing to give you half the profits.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I was getting half the profits.
LEADMALE:Um The dream is dead, pop.
SUPFEMALE:Sales haven't been good? Sales haven't been.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing? Well, yeah, I sold a bottle of class of '84 suntan lotion to Mallory's friend Carla.
LEADFEMALE:It was, uh $1.
OTHERMALE:30 total profit.
SUPFEMALE:Here's your 65 cents.
LEADFEMALE:This was once $100, Alex.
LEADMALE:Alex, Carla wants her money back from that suntan lotion you sold her! It turned her skin green! No way, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:She knew the risks.
SUPFEMALE:I told her there was a possibility of that happening.
SUPMALE:Dad? Well, just how green did she turn? Dad! Good morning, mom.
LEADMALE:Morning, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:Kate.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, grandma.
OTHERMALE:Sleep well? Not really, Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:Not at all.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Don't do that, Elyse.
LEADMALE:You're being very childish.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm being childish.
LEADFEMALE:That's funny.
LEADMALE:Ha ha ha.
LEADMALE:So, grandma, how was your date? Oh, very nice, thank you.
LEADMALE:How'd the necklace go over? Did Phillip like it? Yes, thank you, he did.
LEADMALE:Oh, I must have left the necklace at his house.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I tend to get a little butterfingered while I'm morally outraged.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Kate.
SUPMALE:Don't Goodbye, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:Kate, what are you doing? I'm not going to stay here and be insulted by that woman you married.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Kate, pl Sit sit down.
LEADMALE:Please.
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:Sit.
LEADMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
OTHERMALE:Uh, I know Elyse has been, uh A little irrational lately.
OTHERMALE:A little irrational? All right, in some states she'd be put away, but You've got to understand, divorce is always tough on the children.
LEADFEMALE:Uh So, here we are Mother, daughter Husband, son-in-law Just the four of us.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe, uh Maybe I'll be off to work now.
SUPMALE:I-I-if it's okay with the two of you Go.
LEADMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'm furious with you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're mad at me? I'm not the one who stayed out all night.
LEADMALE:Why are you having a harder time accepting this divorce than I am? It's not right! It's unnatural! There are some things in this world that you can count on.
LEADMALE:The sun comes up in the morning, it's hard to whistle with crackers in your mouth, and my mom and dad do not get divorced! Elyse, you're going to have to get used to it.
LEADFEMALE:You had a great marriage.
LEADMALE:We had a great family.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody said so.
LEADFEMALE:Was it all a lie? Look, we did have a good marriage.
SUPFEMALE:We grew apart.
LEADFEMALE:It happens.
LEADMALE:But it doesn't erase the wonderful years we had together.
OTHERFEMALE:I want my family back.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE:It's so scary.
LEADFEMALE:If if you and dad can break up, that can happen to anybody.
LEADFEMALE:It could happen to me.
OTHERMALE:No, I don't think it'll ever happen to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Charlie and I were husband and wife for 40 years, but somehow we never became real friends.
LEADMALE:You and Steven are friends.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you miss dad A little? Of course I do.
SUPMALE:There are a lot of things about your father that I miss.
LEADMALE:Like what? Oh, little things.
SUPFEMALE:Like the way he used to wake me up in the morning.
SUPMALE:How? He used to lean over and yell, "swimmers, take your marks!" And then he'd shoot off a little toy cap pistol.
LEADFEMALE:You miss that? I never overslept.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Elyse I've always belonged to someone else.
OTHERMALE:Charlie Donnelly's wife.
LEADMALE:Elyse's mother.
LEADFEMALE:Ned's mother.
LEADFEMALE:Never just me, Kate.
SUPMALE:This is a very difficult time for me.
OTHERMALE:I guess I haven't made it any easier for you, have I? I really need your support, honey.
LEADMALE:I need to feel you're behind me.
LEADMALE:Oh, I am, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Will you stay? Of course I'll stay.
LEADMALE:You're gonna continue dating, though, huh? Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:No slow-dancing on the first date.
SUPFEMALE:No coming in after 10:00 on school nights.
LEADMALE:"School nights.
LEADFEMALE:" Two feet on the ground at all times.
SUPMALE:If you're out with someone who's drunk too much, you call me.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I think Jennifer's improving, don't you, mal? Yes, definitely.
OTHERFEMALE:Couldn't she learn to play something quieter Like checkers? Alex, we all put up with you when you were learning how to play the accordion.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mallory, that was different.
LEADFEMALE:I had a rare gift for that instrument.
OTHERFEMALE:Your teacher wound up in an institution! Hey! Hey, Mrs.
LEADMALE:billington had serious personal problems way before I played "lady of Spain"! Isn't uncle ned here yet? Can't wait to play for him.
SUPMALE:He should be here any minute.
OTHERMALE:I think you should keep practicing.
SUPMALE:Uh, outside.
LEADMALE:Well, come on.
SUPMALE:The acoustics are better outside.
LEADMALE:It's dark out, Alex.
SUPMALE:It'll get you in the mood, Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:You can play the blues.
LEADMALE:All right, but just call me when uncle ned gets here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? So, ma, think uncle ned's gonna stay for a while this time? Well, it's hard to predict anything about my brother.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing you can predict is he'll be unpredictable.
LEADFEMALE:And even that we're not too sure about.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, if dad gets him this job at the station, he'll be able to settle down.
SUPMALE:Now, don't get your hopes up about this.
OTHERMALE:Your dad's trying to set up an interview, but I think you should stop bugging him about it.
SUPFEMALE:What, me? I haven't been bugging him.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, you wallpapered our bedroom with ned's rÃ©sumÃ©.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! What's Jennifer doing outside? She's practicing her clarinet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that explains all the cats.
LEADFEMALE:So, dad, you think you're gonna be able to get uncle ned that interview? Alex, try and be a little more sensitive! Did you have a good day, honey? Well, actually Great.
LEADFEMALE:Did you get ned the interview? Yes, I talked with Mr.
LEADMALE:wertz.
LEADFEMALE:He says, if ned's interested, he'll see him.
LEADFEMALE:Did the question of ned's past come up? Of course it came up, Elyse.
LEADMALE:I couldn't tell wertz that ned just arrived from the planet xenon.
LEADMALE:Sure beats telling him he embezzled $4.
LEADMALE:5 million from his last job.
LEADMALE:Come on, mom.
OTHERMALE:He did not embezzle anything.
SUPFEMALE:He didn't make a penny from that.
LEADMALE:He simply hid that money in the computer to prevent a merger that would put a lot of people out of work.
SUPFEMALE:It it was an act of conscience.
LEADFEMALE:One man's act of conscience is another man's felony, Alex.
LEADMALE:He made a great sacrifice, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:He was vice president of a major corporation.
SUPFEMALE:He gave that up for something he believed in.
LEADMALE:Why are all those cats out in the yard rolling on their backs? Maybe Jennifer's practiced enough tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Look who's here! Hey! Hey, listen! These were out on a curb, and it's a good thing I happened by, 'cause two guys in a truck were trying to make off with them.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! she's an uptown girl how you been? Alex, hey, you've grown a hair.
SUPMALE:Hey, how are you? Steven, hey.
LEADMALE:You've grown many hairs.
LEADFEMALE:And my favorite sister.
LEADMALE:Oh! How are you? Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Well, here I am, huh? Let's celebrate, huh? Alex, you got any beers? Yeah, I think so.
LEADMALE:Great, great.

OTHERFEMALE:Ta-da! Beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Here, put this back for me, would you? So how was the train ride? Good.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Next time, I think I'm gonna ride inside.

LEADMALE:This is one of my six best categories.
SUPFEMALE:How are you in geography, Mallory? Well, let's put it this way, uncle ned We're happy when she finds her way home.
SUPFEMALE:He's trying to break our concentration, uncle ned.
LEADFEMALE:Just ignore him.
SUPFEMALE:Ignore whom? Don't worry about it, mal.

LEADMALE:I, uh, think you might be good at it.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be great at it! Does that mean you're interested? No, it means I find you irresistible.
LEADMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, I am.

LEADFEMALE:You know, he's been drinking a lot, mom.
LEADMALE:Look, this is a very difficult time for him, Alex.

LEADFEMALE:No, you gotta listen to me.
OTHERMALE:If you had seen him last night 
SUPMALE:Now, the main thing is, just relax.

SUPFEMALE:Ned seems fine to me.
SUPMALE:Trust me, mom.
SUPMALE:Uncle ned has a drinking problem, and you gotta do something about it.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, don't you think you're overdramatizing this? Why, in the name of all that is pure and sacred in this great planet of ours, do you always accuse me of overdramatizing things? All right, all right, but, uh This time I'm not exaggerating.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Alex, I've known ned a lot longer than you have.
LEADFEMALE:He was always a drinker in school, but he's been able to handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Mom He drank a whole bottle of vanilla extract last night.
LEADMALE:He was rummaging through the pantry looking for anything with alcohol in it.
OTHERFEMALE:There's my ride.
OTHERFEMALE:I gotta go.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, uh Talk to him, will you, please, mom? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, hey, this place cleared out fast.

LEADFEMALE:Steven told me about Your difficulties there.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps you'd like to expand upon that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, Mr.

LEADFEMALE:Well, then whose feet are these? Ned, please, get up now.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Donnelly, I think this interview is over.
SUPFEMALE:Well, wertz, I think you did a fine job, and I will let you know in a few days.
SUPFEMALE:Boys.
LEADMALE:Where's ned? What's the matter? What happened at the interview? Elyse, he showed up drunk Without socks! He made a fool of himself, of me, and of Mr.
LEADMALE:wertz.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:He promised me he wouldn't drink.
LEADFEMALE:How much more evidence do you need, mom? And let me tell you something What I saw today was much more than a man who had a few too many drinks.
LEADMALE:What I saw was a-a sick, self-destructive individual.
LEADMALE:What are we gonna do? Well, he obviously needs help.
SUPMALE:I don't know Maybe he should call alcoholics anonymous.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hi-ho, stev-a-rino.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'm starting on Monday, huh? You want to car-pool? Hey, Alex! Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Open that up and get some glasses, 'cause we're gonna have ourselves a little celebration, huh? That was quite an exhibition you put on today.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, I aim to please.
OTHERMALE:Ned, you said you wouldn't drink.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I haven't been drinking, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:I just had a couple of beers, that's all.
LEADMALE:I ran into an old friend of mine, Mike Uh, Mike Griffin, and he insisted I have a drink with him.
LEADMALE:Now, I couldn't turn him down, could I? Ned! All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't meet Mike Griffin.
LEADFEMALE:I met merv Griffin, and he insisted that I had a drink with him.
LEADMALE:Now, what could I do? You don't say no to merv.
OTHERMALE:Would you stop lying, ned? Not now! I'm on a roll! Listen to yourself.
LEADMALE:Let me try that.
SUPFEMALE:"Not now! I'm on a roll!" I sound fine to me.
LEADMALE:This interview could have been a new start for you, uncle ned.
LEADMALE:Dad went out of his way to set it up.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't even give it a chance.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, what difference does it make? Wertz was never gonna give me that job.
OTHERFEMALE:I never had a chance.
LEADMALE:That is not true.
OTHERMALE:You had a very good chance.
LEADMALE:But you were afraid to face it head-on.
LEADFEMALE:You made damn sure you turned wertz down before he could turn you down.
LEADMALE:Well, what difference does it make, huh? You keatons are always gonna be around to hold the family banner high.
LEADFEMALE:Alex here will probably be running the country before he's even 35 years old.
OTHERMALE:Now, what difference does it make if old ned falls by the wayside, huh? That's the most pathetic speech I've ever heard.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:The most pathetic one is coming up now.
LEADFEMALE:You guys have any idea what it's like to be washed up before you're even 30 years old? Huh? Olga korbut, the mouseketeers, ned Donnelly We're all has-beens.
SUPMALE:Okay, you can go ahead and you can act like a kid, but you have an adult's problem and it's not gonna go away by itself.
LEADMALE:You have a drinking problem, ned.
LEADMALE:You need help.
LEADMALE:I do not have a drinking problem, and I do not need any help.
LEADMALE:Yes, you do! Admit it! I-I think you should call alcoholics anonymous.
LEADMALE: You gotta be kidding, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:You actually think that I'm an alcoholic? Ned You're sick.
LEADFEMALE:You have a disease.
SUPMALE:If you don't do something about it, it's going to kill you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:It's over for me.
OTHERFEMALE:It is not over for you, uncle ned.
SUPMALE:You were at the top once.
SUPFEMALE:You you can make it back up there again.
LEADMALE:Do you, uh, remember these clippings? Young executive of the year, 1980.
LEADMALE:Uh, your speech before the world bank.
LEADMALE:When you made junior vice president at 28.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, what are you doing with this stuff? Whenever I think I can't achieve something, I look at those.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, Alex These are ancient history.
SUPFEMALE:They're garbage! Hey, uncle ned, don't do that.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, give me those.
LEADFEMALE:Leave me alone! Give me those.
LEADFEMALE:Leave me alone!! What the hell are you doing?! Steven.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Sorry, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, ned.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:It's over.
LEADMALE:Right now, either you get some help, or you get the hell out of my house.
LEADMALE:How could I do that? I hit Alex.
LEADMALE:How could I do that? Now would you call a.
OTHERMALE:A.
SUPFEMALE:? I guess I could look upon this as a way of meeting women that share a common interest with me.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Um Would you be interested in subscribing to the Columbus express? No, no, uh Uh, my name is ned Donnelly, and I have a drinking problem.

SUPMALE:I love you when you're strict.
LEADMALE:Kiss me, you hunk! I'll get it! Hi, folks.
OTHERMALE:Enjoying the show? An unforgettable evening in the theater.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? Yes, this is the keatons'.
LEADMALE:Oh, just one moment, please.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, it's deena Marx! 
LEADFEMALE:I got it! Thank you! Hang up.
LEADMALE:It's deena Marx.
SUPFEMALE:I don't care if it's Karl Marx.
LEADMALE:Hang up.
OTHERMALE:No, w-wait a minute, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:If it's Karl Marx, I'd like a word with him.
SUPMALE:Hang up.
LEADMALE:Who's deena Marx? She's one of the most popular girls in school.
LEADFEMALE:She's smart.
LEADFEMALE:She's pretty.
LEADFEMALE:A lot more important than Karl Marx, whoever he is.
LEADFEMALE:If she has all that going for her, what could she possibly want with Alex? And she was just named leader for the senior caucus for passage of the equal rights amendment.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she wants him for target practice.
SUPMALE:Alex, what'd deena Marx want? Whoa, wait a minute, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, the telephone is an instrument of private communication.
LEADFEMALE:See, that's why the receiver's only big enough for one ear.
SUPMALE:Then why'd they make extensions? As usual, you're too sharp for me.
LEADMALE:Well, if you must know, Mallory, she's co-editor of the school yearbook with me.
SUPFEMALE:She's coming over in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:You happy? I know you're not telling me everything, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, mom, do you know where your "e.
LEADMALE:R.
LEADMALE:A.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes" button is? I'd like to borrow it.
SUPMALE:Sure, it's upstairs in my Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Since when did you support the e.
LEADMALE:R.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADMALE:? Since he got interested in deena Marx.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:That is not true.
LEADMALE:Look, I have always been a supporter of the e.
LEADMALE:R.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:Equal rights are as important for men as they are for women.
LEADMALE:We men will not be free until women are equal.
LEADMALE:Ah, I had you going for a minute, didn't I? No, seriously, mom, come on.
SUPMALE:Can I have the button? No! I'm not gonna give it to you so you can deceive some girl.
LEADMALE:Oh, why not? We're family.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:Dad, can I, uh, borrow yours? Forget it, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What you're doing is unprincipled.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, your mother would kill me.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, fine, fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just I'll just make do with these pamphlets.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see here.
LEADFEMALE:"Sexual discrimination will not be tolerated.
SUPFEMALE:" No.

OTHERMALE:" Sexual discrimination will not be tolerated.
SUPMALE:Doesn't just roll off your tongue, does it, Alex? "Bring women into the mainstream of American society in a truly equal Partnership with men.
LEADFEMALE:" This isn't gonna be easy.
LEADMALE:Okay, how 'bout this? For the dedication in the front of the book, a full-page photo of Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Buchanan, and in the lower corner, "in dedication Emma Buchanan.
OTHERFEMALE:What a teacher.
LEADFEMALE:What a woman.
LEADMALE:" What a body.
SUPFEMALE:Alex.
SUPMALE:W-what I mean is, what a body of knowledge This woman has imparted to us over the years.
SUPFEMALE:That's not what you meant.
LEADMALE:She does have a great body, but I don't think we should put that under her picture in the yearbook.
LEADFEMALE:For one thing, it has a slightly sexist ring.
LEADMALE:Well, hey, no ring intended.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sexism Sexual discrimination of any kind Is entirely intolerable to me.
OTHERFEMALE:The mere thought of it makes me wince.
LEADMALE:Really? Well, yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you feel that way? Well, yeah, I do.
SUPMALE:I just didn't think you did That's all.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm I'm glad you feel the same way I do because, frankly, it would be very hard to work with someone who didn't.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but I've always thought of you as kind of well, conservative and preppy.
LEADFEMALE:Preppy? Me? I no, no.
SUPFEMALE:I just came in from a wedding.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, let me get this straight.
LEADFEMALE:You are pro-e.
OTHERMALE:R.

LEADMALE:Uh, listen, just, uh Just sit yourself down.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you know, you're gonna love this tea.
SUPMALE:I-it was grown, picked, and brewed entirely by women.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Alex, everything we talk about does not have to involve women.
LEADFEMALE:I-I do have other interests.
LEADFEMALE:I don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, but I'm, uh I'm willing to learn.
LEADMALE:Hey, you know, this is really fun.
LEADFEMALE:Working with you isn't nearly as dull as I thought it would be.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I think.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and it's really surprising.
LEADMALE:What? What is? Well, all these years in school, I've never had the least bit of interest in you.
LEADMALE:That doesn't seem possible.
LEADMALE:Why? Oh, little things, I guess Like the young Republicans club.
LEADFEMALE:Pfft, that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, deena, deena, deena, deena, deena.
SUPFEMALE:See, I-i am something of a dabbler.
LEADMALE:I'm I'm a seeker of new experiences.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm like a young sapling whose roots are young and thirsty.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, see, this is what I thought it would be like.
SUPFEMALE:You know, deena, it it's good that we can laugh in these troubled times When when women are so ruthlessly oppressed by this sexist society.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Like some tea? No, thank y Nice, uh Apron, son.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow, thanks, dad.
LEADMALE:I hope you don't mind me borrowing it.

LEADMALE:Uh, when you're done, uh Hang it next to my jello molds.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I will, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm just wearing it to, uh, make some tea, and then I'm gonna clean up.
LEADFEMALE:A woman's work is never done.
LEADFEMALE:A person's work, mom.
OTHERMALE:Thank you for raising my consciousness, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:How's the yearbook coming along? At the rate we're going, we should have it out by the time we're sophomores in college.
SUPMALE:Elyse and I were co-editors of the yearbook in high school.
LEADMALE:It was really terrific.
OTHERFEMALE:We had some great times together.
OTHERMALE:That's how we met.
LEADFEMALE:No, it wasn't.
LEADMALE:I-I wasn't on the yearbook staff in high school.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh t-that No, that that's right.
SUPFEMALE:I was thinking of, uh Right, it I-it's not important.
LEADFEMALE:Steven? Mr.
SUPFEMALE:editor? They're a fun couple, aren't they? Equally fun.
LEADMALE:You know, deena, I-i was wondering, uh W-would you like to go out with me Saturday night? I can't.
LEADMALE:I'm hosting an e.
LEADFEMALE:R.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:Debate at the community center.
SUPFEMALE:Oh What a coincidence! You know, that is where I was gonna take you.
LEADMALE:Hey, great.
SUPMALE:We can go together.
SUPFEMALE:Great! Uh.
LEADFEMALE:I'll pick you up at 7:00.
OTHERFEMALE:Or you could pick me up at 7:00.
OTHERMALE:Or we could meet halfway At, uh, 3:30.
OTHERMALE: This evening we are pleased to present a dialogue between two women, both presidents of women's groups who often approach the same problem, shall we say, from different directions.
OTHERMALE:Will you help me welcome Sharon Fletcher and Dorothy canell? Now, let's get right to it, shall we? Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Fletcher, tell us, if you would, what bothers you most about passage of the e.
OTHERMALE:R.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:Well, simply stated, I believe that passage of the e.
LEADFEMALE:R.
OTHERMALE:A.
SUPMALE:Would take away rights that American women already have under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.
LEADMALE: Ms.
OTHERFEMALE:canell, how do you respond? Ladies and gentlemen, if the equal rights amendment is not ratified, a whole generation of American girls will grow up unequal, limited in their options, penalized for being born female.
SUPMALE:Yeah! Yeah.
LEADMALE: The e.
OTHERMALE:R.
OTHERFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:Is many things, but basically it's a bread-and-butter issue.
LEADFEMALE:Women with college degrees are paid less than men who haven't finished high school.
LEADFEMALE:Let's keep it that way! This this must stop.
LEADMALE:Your behavior is unacceptable, sir.
OTHERMALE:Homemakers' labor is not recognized as having economic value.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, get back in the kitchen, lady That's where you belong.
SUPFEMALE: Hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Let this woman speak.
LEADFEMALE:Show some common What are you doing? Look, let her speak.
LEADMALE:The first amendment of the constitution clearly states, and I quote You swine.
LEADMALE:Stop the e.
LEADMALE:R.
OTHERFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:! Stop the e.
LEADMALE:R.
LEADFEMALE:A.
OTHERFEMALE:! 
OTHERFEMALE:* oh, deep in our hearts we do believe we shall not be moved today that's right sing it.
SUPMALE:It's important.
SUPMALE:Are you okay? No, not really.
SUPMALE:Look, deena, I-i cannot go on with this any longer.
LEADMALE:I-I-I'm not really Alex, that was a very courageous thing you did Coming to Dorothy's defense like that.
LEADMALE:Well, th-thanks, but, uh, listen, a-about this whole e.
SUPFEMALE:R.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:Business, this this this button, this this shirt.
LEADFEMALE:It's not is that a scratch on your ear? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's nothing.
OTHERMALE:Oh, those animals! Alex, I don't think I've ever been as attracted to anybody as I am to you right now.
SUPFEMALE:So, what is it you wanted to tell me? Don't remember.
LEADMALE:I think it was a trivia question.
LEADMALE:Isn't this romantic? The two of us in prison together.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I want to thank you for coming to my defense.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm very impressed with your passion for the movement.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, Dorothy, it was a privilege to come to your aid.
SUPMALE:I-I regret I have but one ear to give to the cause.
LEADMALE:Alex, when you talk like that, I can barely keep my hands off you.
LEADMALE:But, uh but those are just idle words.
LEADMALE:There is a job to be done here.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, there is! Right on! You know, and not only by us but by women everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! How long must we wait? How long are we expected to accept these indignities? How long, lord? You know, I-i feel the way president Kennedy must have felt that day at the Berlin wall, when he said, "today I am a berliner.
SUPMALE:" Well, today, in this hour, I say to you, "I am a woman!" I'd hate to be taken out of context, though.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Is that better? Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:That's, uh That's much better.
LEADMALE:Alex?! Alex! Are you all right? Life's been rough, mom.
LEADMALE:Come on, a-Alex.
SUPFEMALE:We've We've paid your bail.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, uh, dad, uh I will not leave here Until the last of my sisters passes through these bars.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, women, my parents, Steven and Elyse Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:All right! Whoo! Bravo! Good for you! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! 
LEADFEMALE:So, tell me, Alex, how long have you been a supporter of women's rights? 
SUPFEMALE:Virtually since birth.
SUPFEMALE:Now, how is that possible? Good question Coming from a girl.
LEADMALE:Alex, leave them alone.
OTHERFEMALE:They're just playing.
SUPMALE:Dad, I will not be ridiculed in my own home By puppets.
LEADMALE:That's what's wrong with you feminists.
LEADFEMALE:You have no sense of humor.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I am not a feminist.
LEADMALE:I am simply posing as a feminist out of respect for the girl I care about.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I-i hope she appreciates it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, why is everybody picking on me? Look, last night I defended a woman's right to speak.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, I-is that bad? Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:We're very proud of you for that.
SUPMALE:And I spent a night in jail for a cause I don't even believe in.
LEADFEMALE:Does that make me a bad person? Alex, that's not what we're talking about.
OTHERMALE:You're misleading deena.
LEADMALE:You have a relationship based on lies.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, that's not true.
SUPFEMALE:We're past the lies.
SUPFEMALE:We're into the good stuff now.
LEADMALE:Look, uh, do you think I'm happy doing this? I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I-it started out as a few innocent little lies.
OTHERFEMALE:I wouldn't even call them "lies.
SUPFEMALE:" They were They were lie-ettes.
LEADFEMALE:And it just snowballed.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, what can I do now? Deena believes very deeply in this cause, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Your attitude towards it is, uh Well, it's really insulting to her.
LEADMALE:Now, if you care at all about deena, you should tell her the truth now.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, deena.
LEADMALE:Yeah, listen, I-I'm glad you called because I-i have something to tell you.
LEADMALE:What's that? Really? No kidding.
LEADMALE:That that is really flattering, but Wow.
SUPMALE:Oh, wow! Oh, that is great.
LEADFEMALE:Oh all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, deena.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Okay, bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Huh! So, did you tell her? Congratulate me.
SUPFEMALE:I am now the leader of the Ohio youth movement for passage of the e.
LEADMALE:R.
OTHERMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:We got a rally this Saturday.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not gonna go, are you? Well, mom, I have to go.
LEADMALE:I'm the keynote speaker.
LEADFEMALE:This is indeed a very special evening for me.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I've always said that the equal rights amendment is not a women's issue, it's a people's issue.
OTHERFEMALE:And that thought was strongly reinforced for me the other night in of all places, our city jail.
SUPMALE:During our e.
SUPFEMALE:R.
OTHERFEMALE:A.
SUPMALE:Debate here last Saturday night, I was shouted down.
SUPMALE:But during the ruckus, a young man leapt to my defense and demanded that I be heard.
SUPFEMALE:Only later, in jail, did I get a full sense of his commitment to e.
SUPMALE:R.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:He so fully shares our frustrations and our concerns that he was able to say, in the most heartfelt manner, "today, in this cell, I am a woman.
SUPMALE:" Alex Keaton said he was a woman And my spirit soared.
LEADFEMALE:His courage, his valor, his integrity, his truthfulness Are beyond measure.
LEADFEMALE:He boycotted, or, as he put it Are you all right? Person-cotted No.
OTHERMALE:I have to talk to you.
LEADMALE:So girls could play, too.
OTHERMALE:Women's rights I lied to you.
LEADMALE:What? I lied.
SUPFEMALE:I lied.
LEADFEMALE:It's all lies.
SUPMALE:I'm not I'm not pro-e.
OTHERFEMALE:R.
OTHERFEMALE:A.
SUPFEMALE:See, I-i just made-believe I-i was so you'd be interested in me.
OTHERFEMALE:A man for all seasons May I introduce the next Ohio youth leader of the e.
LEADFEMALE:R.
LEADMALE:A.
SUPMALE:, Alex Keaton? I'm, uh I'm not, uh Worthy of your applause.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, look, uh It's it's time that you heard the truth.
LEADMALE:See, I defended Dorothy canell's right to be heard, and and I believe in that.
LEADMALE:Yes! Yes! Yes! No, please.
LEADMALE:See, um My my reasons for doing it a-are not what you think.
OTHERMALE:I did it for a girl.
OTHERFEMALE:All right! Cut it out.
LEADMALE:Cut it out.
OTHERMALE:See, um I'm I'm trying to apologize here.
SUPMALE:See, I, uh I-I made-believe I was something I'm not so, uh so this girl would be interested in me.
LEADMALE:It seemed harmless enough at the time But, uh The truth is, I-i-I'm not in favor of the e.
LEADFEMALE:R.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm sorry, deena.
OTHERMALE:Uh, and I apologize to you, Dorothy to my family And to all of you.
SUPFEMALE:See, I can't accept this honor because I-i believe that the leader of a movement Has to, uh, believe in the movement, and I honestly don't.
LEADMALE:I-I have managed to gain some new understanding of the need for e.
LEADFEMALE:R.
LEADMALE:A.
OTHERMALE:A-and it comes from seeing intelligent, courageous people who want it as badly as you do.
SUPMALE:I'm not voting for it But, uh, I am closer to it than ever before.
LEADMALE:So, you see, I am not the Alex Keaton that you thought I was.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not a woman.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Could we take a 10-minute break? This is a mess.
SUPFEMALE:I uh, uh, deena? Yeah, what is it, Alex? Well, I-i-i was just wondering if, uh This Was gonna affect our relationship.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, Alex.
SUPMALE:Uh, deena, wait.
LEADMALE:Look, I-i am sorry.
LEADFEMALE:What I did was Was an insult to you.
LEADFEMALE:I-it was childish.
LEADMALE:It was it was unforgivable.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, at least we found something we really agree on.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, it was.
SUPMALE:I mean It was unforgivable.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you forgive me? You made a mockery of something that I believe deeply in.
LEADMALE:You made a fool of me.
LEADMALE:You lied to me.
LEADMALE:I can't forgive that.
SUPMALE:So, Alex, how are things working out with deena? You did the right thing, Alex.
OTHERMALE:A wonderful girl Just walked out of my life.
LEADMALE:All I'm left with is a prison record.
LEADFEMALE:How can that be the right thing? I know it doesn't feel like it now, but you did.
SUPMALE:Let's go home, son.
LEADMALE:Alex What did you mean when you said you're not a woman? I'm not.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry to have to break it to you this way, mom.
SUPMALE:You're weird, Alex.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE: is it midnight yet? Eight more minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory's never violated her curfew before.
OTHERFEMALE:She still has eight minutes, Elyse.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Seven minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:This is silly.
LEADMALE:We should be happy that she's going out with someone as nice as Rick.
LEADMALE:He's a terrific kid.
SUPMALE:He's a terrific college man, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:He's 18.
SUPFEMALE:She's 16.
LEADFEMALE:That's only two years' difference in their age.
SUPFEMALE:That is a very big difference at this age, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Let him come back when he's 35 and she's 33.
OTHERMALE:We know Rick.
LEADMALE:We like Rick.
OTHERMALE:He's never been anything but a perfect gentleman with me.
LEADMALE:It's not you I'm worried about, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Mallory's here.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Why? We don't want her to know we've been waiting up for her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:The bedroom.
SUPMALE:Bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! The kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:The kitchen.
LEADMALE:We made it.
LEADMALE:With five minutes to spare.
OTHERMALE:I had so much fun at that party, Rick.
LEADMALE:I like your friends a lot.
SUPMALE:They liked you, too.
LEADMALE:Three different guys asked me if you had any sisters.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, by the way, tell Jennifer that Biff, rocky, and Howard will be calling her tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Well, here we are again Our couch.
SUPMALE:I'm beginning to feel like I should pay rent on it.
LEADMALE:You don't need to.
SUPMALE:The landlady likes you.
LEADMALE:That was really nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, let's do it again sometime.
LEADMALE:I'm free now.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:I think you better go now, Rick.
SUPFEMALE:I'm expected to walk to my car after this? Rick.
SUPMALE:Sorry, but it's hard for me to get worked up like this every time I go out with you and then just drive home alone.
OTHERFEMALE:It isn't easy for me, either.
LEADMALE:Mallory We've been seeing each other for four months now, and they've been four of the best months of my life.
LEADMALE:I feel the same way.
SUPMALE:But for us to keep going together, I think we need to explore new territory expand the horizons of our relationship, and And discover the wonders of nature.
LEADMALE:Are you trying to say we should go camping? This this is tough for me to to ask you this, 'cause I hear myself and I sound like a Like another guy coming on to a girl when When you know that's not what's going on here.
SUPMALE:Don't you? I do.
LEADMALE:But it's a big step for me, Rick.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:But look at it this way You won't have to go through it alone.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be with you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, is that how it works? Pretty much.
LEADMALE:Think about it? I will.
LEADMALE:So, Mallory, what are you gonna do about Rick? Are you gonna sleep with him? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I haven't decided yet.
SUPFEMALE:The way I see it, you got two choices You do it or you lose him.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, margo.
LEADFEMALE:Rick's in college.
LEADMALE:If Mallory won't sleep with him, he can find plenty of girls who will.
SUPMALE:Sex is practically on the curriculum.
LEADFEMALE:That's no reason to do it.
SUPMALE:Are you in love with Rick, Mallory? I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:I might be.
SUPFEMALE:I know I've never felt this way about any other guy.
LEADFEMALE:Bill and I have been going together for two years.
SUPFEMALE:We're in love, and we haven't slept together.
LEADMALE:What do you want, a medal? No.
SUPFEMALE:I just want Mallory to know she doesn't have to rush into anything.
LEADMALE:I'm not so sure about that.
LEADFEMALE:Guys like Rick don't walk into your life every day.
LEADMALE:At least your first time will be something worth remembering, not like mine and Danny frankl You and Danny Franklin? Kathy, you didn't tell us.
LEADFEMALE:This is major information here.
LEADMALE:It was a mistake.
SUPMALE:I got carried away.
OTHERMALE:I mean, he didn't love me.
OTHERMALE:He just wanted to go to bed with me Like any man in his right mind.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Just wanted to make myself a sandwich.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do you have to do it in here? This is where we keep the food.
SUPMALE:Dad.
SUPMALE:Never mind.
SUPMALE:I'll just go gnaw on the woodwork.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory if you decide to do this, be sure to get some birth control.
LEADMALE:Well, Rick said he'd take care of that.
LEADMALE:You can't rely on the guy, Mallory.
LEADMALE:He's not the one who's gonna get pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Isn't it kind of unromantic to plan the whole thing? It's also unromantic to be 16 and pregnant.
OTHERMALE:Okay, on that happy note um, we got to go.
SUPFEMALE:I was supposed to pick up my mom a half-hour ago.
LEADFEMALE:Call me if you want to talk about it, okay? Okay.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:See you, mal.
LEADMALE:Bye, mal.
SUPMALE:Did I just hear your friends leave? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Kathy had to pick her mom up.
SUPMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:You need any help cleaning up? No, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Can we have a talk, Mallory? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I-i don't know exactly how to put this, so I'll just I'll just come right out and say it.
LEADFEMALE:Are you and Rick You know? You know? Not exactly how I meant to phrase it.
SUPFEMALE:It shouldn't be so hard for me to talk to you about sex.
LEADMALE:I'm your mother.
LEADMALE:I knew you before you were born.
OTHERMALE:Do we have to talk about this, mom? Well, yeah, we do.
SUPFEMALE:See, Mallory, I-i know how you feel about Rick, and I-i thought maybe you'd be confused and you could use a talk.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what you mean, mom.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not confused at all.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I've got a lot of homework to get done, so, um, I better get started.
SUPMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Have a cookie.
LEADFEMALE:I got to go.
LEADMALE:I-I don't want a cookie.
LEADMALE:I-i want to talk.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, is this absolutely necessary? I told you I have a school assignment to record family conversations.
LEADMALE:What are you studying to be, an FBI agent? Alex, this is Jennifer's school project.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be glad to help.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, if you don't mind.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, why don't we take a break, get a snack? Funny how you always want to take a break when I'm winning, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Checkmate, dad.
LEADFEMALE:You happy? How'd he do that? Louder, dad.
OTHERFEMALE:How did he do oh.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess this is good night.
LEADMALE:It has the usual elements.
SUPFEMALE:It's dark out, and you're shutting the door in my face.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I think there's a chance I might get to like you.
LEADMALE:You think so, huh? Just a hunch.
LEADFEMALE:And you? Uh, I'm not sure.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe.
SUPMALE:Um, Mallory have you given any thought to what we talked about the other night? It did cross my mind a few thousand times.
SUPFEMALE:Well, look, I-i know that That you have some doubts about this, that it's a big step for you, but I've been thinking about it, too, and I have a few things to say on the subject Rick My answer is yes.
LEADFEMALE:I-I got so nervous, I forgot the rest of my My my speech.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Oh, al Alex, you busy? Uh, yeah, kind of, dad.
SUPMALE:Look, look, Jennifer's getting frustrated about this project of hers.
OTHERMALE:She hasn't gotten a usable conversation on tape yet.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm trying to figure out a calculus problem, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:It'll just take a second.
LEADFEMALE:Look, when I press "record," let's have a spontaneous conversation.
LEADMALE:So Alex, my son I see you're doing some math homework.
LEADMALE:Yes, dad.
OTHERMALE:My father.
LEADFEMALE:I sure am.
LEADMALE:How goes it? All goes well, dad.
OTHERMALE:Great thing about numbers You can always count on 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh, my.
OTHERFEMALE:That is very funny.
SUPFEMALE:Dad? Yes? This is the most boring conversation I have ever had.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Me me too.
SUPMALE:We're putting too much pressure on ourselves to be spontaneous.
LEADFEMALE:See you later, son.
LEADMALE:Alex, do you have a minute? I want to ask you a question.
SUPMALE:I'm all ears.
LEADMALE:Well, you're a guy.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, uh I'm not just a guy.
LEADFEMALE:I like to think of myself as a guy and a half.
LEADFEMALE:What's up? Okay, I was wondering How important is sex to a guy? Well, I'd say it has a certain importance.
LEADFEMALE:Well, on a scale of 1 to 10.
SUPMALE:That's what I thought.
SUPMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Why are you asking me this? I'm just making conversation.
SUPMALE:No, no, no, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:This is not conversation.
LEADFEMALE:Conversation is, uh, "how you doing?" Uh, "looks like rain.
LEADMALE:" "Care for a waffle?" There's something going on here you're not telling me.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, has Rick Asked you to visit his tepee? You mean sleep with him? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, has he? Well, yeah, he has.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when you said you wouldn't sleep with him I mean, you were nice to him.
LEADMALE:I mean, you let him down easy, I hope.
SUPMALE:I said yes.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, just a moment.
SUPMALE:Are you crazy? Is this the way I brought you up? Cut it out, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Mallory, you're making a big mistake here.
LEADMALE:You are 16 years old.
LEADFEMALE:That is too young.
LEADFEMALE:Well, have you ever? Have I ever what? Had someone visit your tepee.
LEADFEMALE:Me? Of course I have.
LEADMALE:But I was much older than you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're 16.
SUPMALE:I was 17.
SUPMALE:And a half.
LEADFEMALE:I was 17, 8 months, and 3 days, and it was leap year.
SUPFEMALE:You're babbling, Alex.
LEADMALE:Look, Mallory, y-you just can't do this.
OTHERMALE:It's wrong.
OTHERMALE:You're not ready yet.
LEADMALE:Why wasn't it wrong when you did it? Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:That's different.
SUPMALE:I'm a guy.
SUPMALE:That is such a double standard, Alex.
SUPMALE:If a guy loses his virginity, he's some kind of hero, but if a girl does, she's ruined her life? That's stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it may be stupid, but it's the law of nature.
SUPFEMALE:You can't fight that.
SUPFEMALE:Look, it's your duty as a woman to say no.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if women shirk that responsibility, men, uh, men would never get any work done.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Alex, it's obvious that you can't be objective about this.
SUPMALE:Why do you want to do this, Mallory? Well, I care very much about Rick.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm attracted to him.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm curious.
SUPFEMALE:I'm curious about astronomy.
SUPMALE:You don't see me riding the space shuttle.
LEADFEMALE:Look, uh, Mallory Why don't you, uh Why don't you talk to mom about this? She lives for this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do that, Alex.
SUPMALE:You know how hard it is to talk to parents about this.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Well, whatever you decide to do, don't do it.
OTHERMALE:Alex, I know, in your own warped way, you've tried to help.
OTHERFEMALE:I appreciate it.
SUPFEMALE:Why are these kids in such a hurry to grow up? Well, this is it.
OTHERMALE:The folks from architectural digest will be here next week, so try not to mess up.
LEADMALE:I'll do my best.
LEADFEMALE:Allow me to take care of a few details.
SUPMALE:First Mood lighting.
LEADFEMALE:Second, soft music.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:The stereo's broken.
LEADFEMALE:I forgot.
LEADMALE:Uh mm-mmm it's the best I can do.
SUPMALE:And finally some flowers.
LEADFEMALE:They have to be back by midnight.
SUPMALE:So do I.
SUPFEMALE:Mm, Rick, did you get what we talked about? Birth control? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Um I stopped by the drugstore on the way to pick you up.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I also got some, uh, dental floss and baseball cards, too.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, no problem.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I got doubles of Reggie Jackson if you want one.
SUPFEMALE:Rick, how do you feel right now? I mean, are you happy we're gonna do this? You can't begin to imagine how happy.
LEADMALE:What's the problem? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just a little nervous about this, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:That's only natural.
SUPFEMALE:Could we talk for a little while first? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:What do you wanna talk about? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:We never had trouble making conversation other times.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, other times haven't been right before we're about to make love.
LEADFEMALE:That is just the point, Rick.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, things shouldn't change because of sex.
LEADMALE:If if we can make conversation other times, we should be able to make conversation now.
SUPMALE:Let's talk.
SUPFEMALE:Um Did you enjoy dinner tonight? Very much.
OTHERMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'm ready.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, look The last thing I want to do is to put any pressure on you.
LEADMALE:If you don't want to do this, if you don't want to make love tonight, then just say so.
LEADMALE:I don't want to make love tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Why not?! We talked about it.
LEADMALE:We we planned on it.
SUPFEMALE:I got the flowers.
LEADMALE:I thought I wanted to sleep with you, and now all of a sudden I'm scared.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know if I'm ready for this.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, I care about you.
LEADMALE:I really do.
LEADMALE:But I'm not in high school anymore.
LEADMALE:And if we're gonna have a relationship, it's got to keep moving forward.
SUPFEMALE:And is sex the only way that's gonna happen? No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:It's not the only way.
LEADMALE:But it's definitely my favorite.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should go home now.
SUPFEMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADMALE:Why don't you? Are we gonna see each other again? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:You're home early.
LEADFEMALE:How was your date with Rick? Fine.
SUPMALE:What did you do? Oh, uh, gosh.
SUPMALE:We saw a movie.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:What did you see? Uh I forget exactly.
SUPMALE:Something part two.
SUPFEMALE:Well, where's Rick? Why didn't he come in with you? He didn't bring me home.
OTHERFEMALE:We had a fight.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Uh, do you want to talk about it? Mom, if I ask you something, do you promise not to ask why I'm asking? All right.
LEADMALE:Is there any way to know when is the right time in your life for sex? Oh, why do you ask? Don't worry.
LEADMALE:Nothing's happened.
SUPMALE:It's just sort of been on my mind lately, that's all.
LEADMALE:I mean, whether you can ever be sure of the right time.
SUPMALE:Can you? I-I don't think there is any positive way to know when is the right time.
OTHERMALE:In fact, I'm not even sure there's such a thing as the absolute right time.
LEADMALE:It's so hard for me to sort out my feelings from what my friends say or what the guy says or what I read in magazines.
LEADMALE:Mom, I want to do what is best for me, but right now I'm too confused to know what that is.
LEADMALE:Well, if you're confused then then I think you should wait.
SUPMALE:You'll you'll be able to handle it much better when you're older.
LEADMALE:I know I will.
SUPFEMALE:And what if waiting means losing a boyfriend I like a lot? Any boyfriend worth keeping will understand.
SUPFEMALE:He should know that sex should never be used as a test of love.
SUPMALE:Thanks, mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad we had this talk.
SUPFEMALE:So am I.
LEADMALE:Mallory.
SUPMALE:I won't stay long.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to talk about what happened tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, there, Rick.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton, what a A pleasant surprise.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:Mom, can I talk to Rick for a minute? Hmm? Oh, uh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I was just going up.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Rick.
SUPFEMALE:What did you want to say? Mallory, I'm I'm disappointed at the way things went tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'd I'd be lying if I said otherwise.
LEADMALE:But I took a shower, and I feel a little better now.
LEADFEMALE:Is that what you came over to tell me? No.
LEADMALE:No, that's not all.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh i-i know that I'm I'm not the most sensitive guy in the world, especially when my hormones take over.
SUPMALE:And if you don't want to go out with me anymore, I understand.
LEADFEMALE:But I-i hope that's not how you feel, because I'd really like to keep seeing you, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:How'd that sound? Fine.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:I practiced it the whole ride over.
LEADFEMALE:I do want to keep seeing you, Rick, but I'm not ready to sleep with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, that's okay.
LEADMALE:If you're not comfortable with it, then neither am I.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Maybe we could set Thanksgiving as the target date.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:okay, skip - take a look around.
OTHERMALE:What do you see? I see the gym A place where I routinely hurt myself.
LEADMALE:The gym? Skip, the gym? That's all you see? See, that's why I'm chairman of the prom committee and you're prom garbage captain this isn't the gym? Well, yeah, today it's the gym.
SUPMALE:But in one week it's gonna be transformed in-into a magnificent civil war plantation it'll just, smell like a gym.
SUPMALE:Sounds great.
LEADMALE:Oh - it's gonna be great.
LEADFEMALE:Skip, we're gonna have a magnolia grove back here.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, this-this is gonna be the Mason Dixon line! And, uh, back here the girls' locker room you know what that's gonna be? Heaven? No, skip, that's where we're gonna put the mansion.
SUPMALE:Come on - we've got a lot of work to do.
LEADMALE:Can you, uh, start by getting the trees? Right away, boss.
LEADMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:How's it going? Oh, Rachel, it's going great.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is gonna be the best prom in the school's history? Oh, great idea you had for the theme "gone with the wind.
SUPFEMALE:" Oh, well thank you! But, I liked your idea, "sunset on wall street.
LEADFEMALE:" Yeah, I guess it was just too romantic for this crowd.
LEADMALE:Everything's under control.
SUPFEMALE:So, Alex, do you have a d-a tuxedo for the prom yet? Yeah sure.
LEADMALE:How about a date? Huh? Who I mean, uh - do you have a date yet? Well, uh, no.
LEADMALE:No, not yet.
OTHERFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I was planning to ask, uh, Jocelyn Clark.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Jocelyn Jocelyn - she's nice.
OTHERMALE:That-that's nice.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I know, but uh - have to admit I'm a little nervous about it.
LEADFEMALE:Why, Alex - I think any girl would be thrilled to go with you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I know that.
SUPMALE:I know, but, Jocelyn's - Jocelyn is just so - special - you know.
LEADMALE:I'm - uh, I'm merely extraordinary.
LEADMALE:I don't know, sometimes ex-extraordinary's enough.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, rach.

LEADFEMALE:Whoa - rach - there she is.
SUPFEMALE:Jocelyn Clark.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me for a minute.
LEADMALE:Wish me luck, rach.
OTHERMALE:Good luck, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Jocelyn.
SUPMALE:So, you're really gonna go with this dumb "gone with the wind" theme, huh? Well, it uh, wasn't my idea, but, uh, I'm just one guy, you know? Uh, Jocelyn, you know, speaking of the prom, I w-I was wondering - uh - well since - since I'm gonna be there and I assume that you're gonna be there - uh - why don't we be there together? What a cute idea! Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:But I can't.
LEADMALE:Brad Hamilton asked me yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I guess, uh guess I just, asked you too late, huh? No, I would have waited for Brad.
SUPMALE:Alex, I just want you to know that I saw the entire thing, and if I were her I would have said "yes.
LEADFEMALE:" Let's hope it doesn't come to that, skip.
LEADMALE:Guess what, mom.
SUPMALE:Today, mrs.
SUPMALE:Anderson read my poem in front of the whole class.
LEADMALE:Well, that's wonderful, honey.
LEADMALE:We'd love to hear it.
LEADMALE:Uh, speak for yourself, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jennifer - let's hear it.
LEADFEMALE:"A poem" by Jennifer Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:"We live in a shadow of nuclear bomb.
SUPMALE:One day we're here - the next we're gone.
OTHERFEMALE:" Uh, so how was your day, Alex? I think the poem pretty well sums it up.
LEADMALE:I know why Alex is depressed.
LEADMALE:He asked Jocelyn Clark to the prom today And she said "no.
SUPMALE:" It's all over school.
SUPFEMALE:Who would believe it? President of the prom committee and I can't get a date! I'd go with you, Alex, but I already have a date.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Just kidding.
LEADMALE:Even the chaperones have dates.
SUPMALE:Don't look at me.
OTHERFEMALE:To make matters worse, Rachel Miller's on her way over here right now to work on prom plans.
OTHERMALE:How am I supposed to get my heart into this now? Don't feel so bad, Alex.
LEADMALE:I'll bet a lot of unpopular guys don't have dates.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, there she is now.
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Yo - rach.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi Rachel, good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Hi honey, how are ya.
SUPMALE:Hi, Rachel.
SUPMALE:We don't have much left to do.
SUPMALE:But we have to pick the music.
LEADMALE:Now I brought some tapes here of a few bands.
LEADMALE:We have "bloody awful", "return of the dead" and "liver damage.
LEADMALE:" Why don't we go upstairs and let Rachel and Alex get some work done? Wow, this is great.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I had liver damage.
SUPFEMALE:It can be arranged.
SUPMALE:Come on, Alex, let's listen to the tapes.
LEADMALE:Terrific, just what I'm in the mood for.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? Jocelyn turned me down.
LEADMALE:I'm depressed.
LEADMALE:I'm saddened.
SUPFEMALE:I'm crushed.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I heard.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:How could that happen? You know, we were so sure she was gonna say "yes.
SUPMALE:" You know, it's torture when you when you want something so bad and you just can't have it.
SUPMALE:You know what I mean? Yes, I do.
OTHERMALE:Ah, there I go, crying on your shoulder again.
SUPFEMALE:Why do I always do that? No, it's okay, I don't - I don't mind.
LEADMALE:Oh-h-h enough of this blubbering.
LEADFEMALE:Let's listen to these tapes.
SUPMALE:The prom must go on.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we have some good stuff here.
LEADMALE:Hey, that's not bad.
LEADMALE:That's "bloody awful.
LEADFEMALE:" Uh-h I kind of like it.
SUPFEMALE:That's the name of the group.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:It was a joke.
LEADFEMALE:I was joking.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh-oh-h - that's - that's funny! Hey, do you want to see if this stuff's danceable? Oh, no, I'm -I'm a really bad dancer.
SUPFEMALE:Rach, trust me, so am I.
LEADFEMALE:Boy you weren't kidding.
LEADFEMALE:But that's okay, we dance badly well together.
SUPMALE:Uh - you know, rach, this is kind of nice.
LEADFEMALE:I never thought of you as someone that I could dance with.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! Ow! Sorry.
LEADMALE:Sorr .
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
OTHERMALE:You know, I just had a crazy thought.
LEADMALE:Why don't why don't we go to the prom together? You mean, you and me? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I-i would love to go! Great.
SUPMALE:Yo, this is wonderful! Not only do I get to go to the prom, now, but with you.
OTHERFEMALE:The nicest guy I know! Ow! Uh, maybe, uh maybe we could stop dancing, now.
LEADFEMALE:This could get painful.
LEADFEMALE:I can stand it if you can.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Ow! You asked Rachel to the prom? That's a brilliant idea! Why didn't we think of it sooner? I don't know, skip.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes in life, there are things that should be so clear to us, yet, uh we're oblivious.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? Never mind, listen we've got a lot of work to do.
LEADMALE:I need you to climb up here and hang this half moon.
SUPMALE:You've got it.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Jocelyn.
OTHERMALE:How're you doing? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Just fine.
SUPFEMALE:Everything is going great here.
OTHERMALE:You know we're going to run another magnolia grove right along there by the bleachers.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex! Okay, we're not locked into it.
LEADFEMALE:Jocelyn, what's wrong? Well, brad and I, we had a fight.
LEADFEMALE:He broke our date for the prom.
SUPFEMALE:What am I going to do, Alex? I don't know, Jocelyn.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex! I'm so sorry that I said no to you yesterday.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you're much sweeter and nicer than Brad is.
SUPFEMALE:I am? I mean, I do my best.
SUPFEMALE:I don't suppose You don't suppose what? That you would still want to take me? I think that we would have a fabulous time together You, me us.
LEADMALE:What do you think? I I-i think, I think you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I - I'd love to go with you.
OTHERMALE:But, Alex! You can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, excuse me.
SUPMALE:W-wait a minute - what are you doing? Do you - do you mean it, Alex? I do Of course I'd love to go with you.
OTHERMALE:Forget about Oh thank you so much, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I hope Alex - you're not rem You're not doing this just because you're sorry for me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm not! I'm not! Jocelyn - What about the othe.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, I'm not! - I think we're gonna have a really good time.
SUPFEMALE:-Alex this is incredible! I can not believe this! I have waited for years to go out with her! Alex! Can you believe this? Aren't you forgetting about something? What? Rachel! The girl you asked out yesterday? Rachel! I forgot about Rachel! How do I get myself into these things, skip? Just lucky, I guess.
SUPFEMALE:Here she comes now, boss.
SUPFEMALE:This isn't going to be easy, skippy.
LEADMALE:Hi, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, skippy.
SUPFEMALE:Is he always this emotional? Listen, uh Rachel, I have to talk to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I have something you can keep that.
OTHERMALE:Uh, what is it? It's a swatch of my prom dress.
SUPMALE:I'm making it myself.
LEADMALE:I was so excited, I stayed up all night sewing.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I thought you'd want to know what color it is to match the corsage.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes-yes indeed I do.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I've been waiting for the senior prom my whole life.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know - I - I didn't think I was going to get to go, but, when you asked me, I'm just so glad we're going together.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
LEADMALE:anyway, I have to run.
LEADMALE:I have a lot of sewing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, bye.
SUPMALE:Alex I hate to be the one to point this out to you, but, uh, you've got two dates to the prom.
OTHERMALE:I'm aware of that, skip.
LEADFEMALE:And if I calculate correctly - that's one date too many.
OTHERMALE:No, skip, that's one me too few.
LEADFEMALE:One man.
LEADMALE:One prom.
SUPMALE:Two dates.
LEADFEMALE:Each date ignorant of the other's existence.
LEADMALE:You know, we're gonna make history, skip.
LEADMALE:We have an appointment with destiny.
LEADFEMALE:Well, cancel it, Alex.
LEADMALE:I'm scared.
LEADFEMALE:Relax, skip.
SUPMALE:Okay, let's go over the plan once more.
LEADMALE:Now, the north end of the gym is now called.
OTHERFEMALE:.
OTHERMALE:Area a.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:At no point is Rachel to enter area a - prior to 8:57.
SUPMALE:.
LEADMALE:Got it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, now - areas b and d are free zones which means Either girl may enter provided the band provided the band is not on a break at the time.
LEADMALE:Very good.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, now remember when I'm with Rachel, I'm gonna be wearing the blue boutonniere.
OTHERMALE:When I'm with Jocelyn - the red one.
LEADMALE:Uh-h, rachel, jocelyn, red, blue.
LEADFEMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, there are emergency exits at either end of the gymnasium.
OTHERMALE:The master switch box is behind the blue wrestling mat.
LEADFEMALE:This will allow you to switch off the lights, lower the backboards, and in case of an emergency, open the floor over the swimming pool.
SUPMALE:Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
LEADMALE:If I'm ever in this situation with uh two dates for a prom, will you do the same thing for me? Skipper, let's cross that bridge when we come to it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh-oh.
SUPMALE:Mallory! You'll never guess what Alex did! Uh skip, that's a secret.
LEADMALE:What's a secret? I'm sorry, but I swore to Alex I wouldn't tell and I'm not going to violate that sacred oath.
SUPFEMALE:Tell me, skippy.
SUPFEMALE:Alex has two dates for the prom.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy! I'm sorry, Alex, but she broke me down! I'm only human! What's going on here? Alex asked out both Rachel and Jocelyn.
LEADMALE:How could you have two dates? Well, come on, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Mom and dad have always encouraged us to go out with more than one person.
LEADMALE:Alex, you crazy? You're not going to pull this off! Sure we will.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight, Alex and I have an appointment with dentistry! Destiny, skip, destiny.
LEADFEMALE:Having fun? Wonderful, I'm so glad you asked me.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you said yes.
LEADMALE:Remember our prom? Oh, like it was yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:Oh I remember the band played uh, "our day will come" and uh wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You know the way kids dance today they never stay with their partners well, I guess I'm glad he's not a shy boy.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I'm exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:Let's sit the rest of this dance out.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm sorry I tired you out.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, Rachel, it wasn't you.
LEADFEMALE:It was me, uh over danced.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is wonderful.
LEADMALE:It's so romantic.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I feel like I'm in the old south all this old glory.
OTHERMALE:Looks great.
LEADMALE:We did a great job! I can practically smell the magnolias blossoming.
LEADFEMALE:And the mints juliping.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, uh Rachel, have I told you how good you look tonight? No.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back and I'll tell you.
LEADMALE:So Rachel, are you having a good time? Great time! Yup, he's quite a guy.
OTHERMALE:You don't know the half of it.
OTHERMALE:Well, I still think it's a dumb theme for a prom.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Jocelyn you just-you have to use your imagination.
LEADMALE:You know, picture -picture the south in all it's glory uh, magnolias blossoming, mints juliping.
OTHERMALE:Mints juliping? Hi, having fun? Uh, yeah mom and dad.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, this is Jocelyn, my uh Date.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Prom chairman! Attention! Prom chairman, please report to area a, uh the bandstand.
LEADFEMALE:Please report to the bandstand excuse me.
LEADMALE:Skippy, that was a serious breach of protocol.
OTHERMALE:Alex, I'm sorry, but Rachel started asking questions.
SUPFEMALE:She wanted to know why you were spending so much time with Jocelyn.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, what did you tell her? That you were tutoring her in math.
OTHERMALE:Good thinking, skip.
LEADMALE:Look out, rachel at 4 o'clock.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:I requested our song.
SUPMALE:Aw, that's "bloody awful.
LEADMALE:" No, I like it! That was a joke.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I'm glad all our hard work paid off.
LEADFEMALE:This is gonna be an evening I'll never forget.
SUPMALE:Me neither.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I've got to talk to you.
LEADMALE:Not now, skippy.
LEADMALE:It's important.
LEADFEMALE:Look, can't it wait? No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, Rachel.
LEADFEMALE:Official prom business.
LEADFEMALE:You-you're really jeopardizing the plan here.
LEADMALE:You're supposed to be with Jocelyn.
LEADMALE:I'm having a good time with Rachel, over here.
LEADFEMALE:Alex! This is the prom! It's no time to enjoy yourself! Go over to Jocelyn, stall her.
LEADMALE:She has been giving me the eye.
LEADMALE:Maybe she's taken with me.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me Jocelyn, would you like to dance? With you? Don't be silly.
SUPMALE:We'll find you somebody else.
SUPFEMALE:You having a good time, Rachel? Yeah, a great time.
LEADFEMALE:Alex is quite a date.
SUPFEMALE:Th-that seems to be the consensus.
LEADFEMALE:May I have your attention please? I'd like to thank all of you for coming tonight.
LEADFEMALE:You've been a great class, and it's-it's going to be sad to see you go.
SUPMALE:And if you believe that, I've got some old textbooks I'd like to sell you.
LEADFEMALE:But seriously, aside from thanking all of you, I think we should all thank one of you The chairman of the prom committee.
OTHERMALE:The man who made, uh "sunset at Tara" a reality Alex p.
LEADMALE:Keaton uh, thank-thank you, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:And now, Alex, I think it's only appropriate that you and your date begin what will be the last dance of the 1984 prom.
LEADMALE:Care to dance? See, it began simply enough.
LEADFEMALE:I asked you, jocelyn, to the prom, because, uh, well, I've always adored you from afar and you've always ignored me.
LEADFEMALE:I knew what I was doing.
OTHERMALE:Then, I asked Rachel.
LEADFEMALE:And she said "yes.
LEADFEMALE:" And then you asked me and - and I said "yes.
SUPMALE:" Look, we're all familiar with the classic one boy, one girl date.
LEADFEMALE:This is a-this is just a simple variation.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to sit here and listen to any more of this.
LEADFEMALE:You did a horrible thing, Alex, and that's all there is to it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Jocelyn.
LEADMALE:Guess you feel the same way, huh? Alex, I wish you'd never invited me to this prom.
SUPFEMALE:If you preferred Jocelyn to me you should have just told me.
OTHERMALE:I don't prefer her to you, Rachel.
LEADMALE:Then why did you take her to the prom when we already had a date? I thought that I preferred her to you.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I-i thought she was everything that I ever wanted in a prom date.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that makes me feel great.
LEADMALE:But, I've got to tell you, Rachel, it didn't turn out that way.
LEADMALE:You know, through-through all the madness and the-and the deception and the running around from girl to girl, one thought kept recurring in my mind.
OTHERFEMALE:You wished you'd worn roller skates? That too.
SUPMALE:No, it became more and more clear to me that, uh, it was you, not Jocelyn that I wanted to be with.
SUPFEMALE:And why should I believe that? You're right.
LEADFEMALE:There is absolutely no good reason for you to believe that.
LEADMALE:I admit, my uh, my credibility is a bit suspect right now.
LEADFEMALE:Take off one of the carnations, and maybe I'll listen.
OTHERMALE:Uh - which one was yours? Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Look Rachel, uh what's important here is not the flowers it-it's that we like each other a lot.
OTHERMALE:And we shouldn't let that slip away just because I did one stupid thing.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I do like you, but I'm mad at you and I'm more mad at myself for not being more mad at you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but not as mad as I am at myself for doing what I did to make you mad at me! And you.
SUPMALE:Alex! This is my senior prom! I wanted this to be really special! It's just not the way I envisioned it.
SUPMALE:Rachel, uh look on the bright side, you're never gonna forget it.
LEADFEMALE:The blue one's mine.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I did this to you tonight Rachel.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if I had only realized sooner how m-how much I like you, this never would have happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you forgive me? Well, it-it's gonna take some time.
SUPMALE:I can wait.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, let's go home.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that was great, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:You certainly haven't lost your touch.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so rusty.
LEADMALE:I must have plucked 20 bad notes.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, you didn't.
SUPFEMALE:I counted 23.
LEADMALE:I only counted 19.
LEADFEMALE:That's as high as you can count.
LEADMALE:Listening to you reminded me of the old days.
LEADMALE:Makes me want to go out and boycott some lettuce.
LEADMALE:Did you know she was a folk singer? I wasn't really a folk singer.
LEADFEMALE:Occasionally, I picked up a guitar.
LEADMALE:Don't be so modest.
LEADMALE:Your mother used to perform every Thursday night.
SUPMALE:It was in a tiny, jam-packed, smoke-filled coffee house two floors underground.
SUPMALE:The age of darkness cafe.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like a fun place.
OTHERFEMALE:Wednesday was anarchist night.
SUPMALE:People in favor of violent overthrow of the government got a free cocktail.
LEADMALE:Hey, you remember that time we came there after the rally Don't get started.
LEADFEMALE:We've got to go.
LEADMALE:She's got a point.
LEADFEMALE:You could have made a career out of singing.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you pursue it? I had a family to raise, another career to build.
OTHERFEMALE:Singing was never more than a hobby.
SUPMALE:I did have a decent following.
SUPMALE:Everybody thought you'd be the next Judy Collins.
LEADFEMALE:You sing great, mom.
LEADMALE:I bet you could have been the next Joan Collins.
LEADFEMALE:Judy Collins, and your dad's exaggerating.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, he isn't.
LEADMALE:You were really something special.
SUPMALE:The world gained an architect, but lost a great singer.
SUPMALE:Maybe you could have combined them and been the singing architect.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, to watch a great mind at work.
LEADFEMALE:I just got an idea.
LEADMALE:Andy and I went to a nightclub called the top spot.
LEADMALE:It's no age of darkness cafe, but it was fun.
LEADMALE:Maybe we could go sometime.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds good.
LEADMALE:Ahem.
LEADMALE:We've got to go.
LEADMALE:The timekeeper.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Good seeing you.
LEADMALE:Good-bye.
LEADMALE:And you, baby, time for bed.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:You were great.
LEADMALE:Will you tuck me in? I'll tuck you in.
LEADMALE:I'm going to bed early, too.
SUPMALE:Alex is giving me a driving lesson tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to work on opening the car door.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I want to actually drive.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mallory, you may be carrying packages sometime.
LEADMALE:Ever think of that? Opening the car door is not always easy.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:It's a pleasure to be here tonight.
SUPMALE:Ah, you're a beautiful audience.
SUPMALE:hi, mal.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:How did the driving lesson go? Great! I think I'm a natural-born driver.
LEADMALE:Where's Alex? How did the lesson go? I thought I'd never see this house again.
SUPMALE:Oh, Alex, don't be so melodramatic.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:It's not your fault.
LEADFEMALE:I assumed that when you saw a sign marked "stop," you'd take it at face value.
OTHERFEMALE:I told you, I didn't see the sign.
LEADMALE:How could you? You were going in reverse.
LEADMALE:It couldn't have been that bad.
SUPFEMALE:Alex has no Patience.
SUPMALE:He was yelling at me the whole time.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't yelling at you.
SUPMALE:I was yelling at a cop to shoot at our tires.
LEADMALE:You're not being very helpful, Alex.
LEADMALE:Mallory needs a patient, tolerant teacher.
OTHERMALE:Will you take me tomorrow, dad? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be glad to.
SUPMALE:You might need this.
SUPFEMALE:What is that? Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:You're late.
LEADMALE:Where have you been? I'm glad you asked that question.
LEADMALE:You going to answer? You won't believe this, but on the way home, I stopped in at the top spot, and I have an audition tomorrow afternoon! Hold down the enthusiasm a bit.
LEADMALE:Honey, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:How are you going to be a singer? Are you going to quit your job? Nobody's quitting any jobs around here.
OTHERMALE:These people got kids to support.
LEADFEMALE:They got a boy to put through college.
LEADMALE:I'm not quitting my job.
LEADMALE:I had such a good time last night that I was thinking how nice it would be to perform again.
LEADFEMALE:In front of people? That's the basic idea.
OTHERMALE:I think you're a great singer, but you're our mother.
SUPMALE:I try to keep a low profile on that.
LEADFEMALE:I thought, what have I got to lose? Your mother is very brave to try this.
LEADMALE:It's important to pursue your dreams, no matter how great the odds against you.
LEADMALE:Like you trying to get a driver's license.
LEADFEMALE:Corky, why don't you try listening? I'm not listening to a dummy like you.
LEADMALE:Hey, corky, I hear you got a new girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Dennis, she's the greatest.
SUPMALE:Her skin is so soft, when I touched her, I only got three splinters.
LEADMALE:When I touched her, I only got three splinters.
LEADMALE:Ok, Dennis.
SUPMALE:You were great.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what about me? Oh, you were Oh, you were You guys crack me up.

LEADFEMALE:We take things for granted.

LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you telling me these things? If I want to feel guilty, I'll call my mother.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.

LEADFEMALE:She got the two pedals confused.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't get the pedals confused.
LEADMALE:I got my feet confused.

LEADFEMALE:She violated almost every traffic ordinance known to man.
SUPMALE:She made a few little mistakes.
OTHERMALE:Nothing out of the ordinary.

LEADFEMALE:Ah, Mallory's driving lesson.

LEADFEMALE:But, please, keep her off the streets.
LEADFEMALE:She has a lot of potential.
LEADFEMALE:What time tomorrow will we go driving? Mallory You're my daughter, and I love you very much, but I'm never getting into an automobile with you again.
LEADMALE:Dad! Guys, I need your help.
LEADMALE:Which one of these should I wear tonight? I told you, you got to go casual.
SUPFEMALE:Couldn't you wear something with a veil? Mallory, why are you so embarrassed about this? Your mother's always loved to sing, and it's important for her now.
LEADMALE:When Mrs.

SUPMALE:That was so horrible, so frightening.
SUPFEMALE:I should never have done it in the first place.
LEADFEMALE:It all came back with a rush, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:What did? Sitting in clubs like this, watching you up there, listening to you sing.
SUPMALE:Cheering you on, hoping you'd sing another.
LEADFEMALE:Loving your voice.
OTHERMALE:Loving you.
SUPMALE:I loved you so much then, Steven.
OTHERMALE:I love you even more now, but that that's separate from this.
LEADMALE:I made a mistake.
SUPMALE:You can't go home again.
LEADFEMALE:I was such a jerk.
LEADMALE:I was out there trying to recapture something that's over.
OTHERMALE:I'm too old for this, you know? It had its time, and so did I.
LEADMALE:I made such a fool out of myself.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:There's another audience at 10:00.
LEADFEMALE:They don't know what a fool you made of yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:I promise not to tell them.

OTHERMALE:Hello, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Alex, I got to talk to you.
LEADMALE:It's an emergency.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong, skip? That's just how I get people's attention.
LEADFEMALE:Usually when skippy handelman walks into a room, people tend to Walk away.
OTHERMALE:Skippy, you're exaggerating.
LEADMALE:That's not true.
LEADMALE:Come on, Jennifer, let's go in the other room and study this camp list of yours.
OTHERFEMALE:Color TV? You're going to camp.
LEADMALE:You're supposed to be roughing it.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'll just bring the black-and-white.
SUPFEMALE: Alex I need to talk to you.
LEADMALE:What's wrong, skip? I found out something unbelievable about my parents.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, skip.
LEADMALE:All adults do that.
LEADFEMALE:It means they love each other.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:That's not what I mean.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? I can't live with the handelmans anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, what are you talking about? You a a handelman.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's what I thought, too, until 3:00 this afternoon.
LEADMALE:Alex, here.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at this.
SUPFEMALE:Skip, these are adoption papers.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:My real name isn't irwin handelman.
LEADMALE:It's baby boy Doe.
SUPMALE:Where did you find these? In my mom's dre I mean, in, uh Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:handelman's dresser drawer.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Um What were you doing going through your mother's drawers? Oh, Alex, what difference does it make?! She's not my real mom anyway! Adopted? Skip Listen Uh, here.
SUPMALE:You want to sit down? Here, get off your feet.
LEADMALE:C-can I get you something? Alex, I'm adopted! I'm not pregnant! This is big news.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You're telling me.
SUPMALE:My whole life has been a lie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not who I thought I was.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing about me is what I thought it was.
LEADMALE:I might not even need these glasses.
LEADMALE:Alex I'm Where are you? Uh, skip, you need 'em.
LEADFEMALE:You need 'em.
LEADMALE:Alex, I don't even know who I am.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know who my family is.
SUPFEMALE:I want to find my real parents, Alex.
LEADMALE:I want to find my roots.
SUPFEMALE:I'm leaving for Africa in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:I told you, when we watched that on TV, those are his roots.
LEADMALE:That doesn't apply to everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Where are my roots, Alex? I don't know, skip.
OTHERFEMALE:We should've told him a long time ago, rose.
LEADFEMALE:We don't we admit it? We made a mistake.
LEADMALE:Harry, I'm too upset to admit anything.
LEADFEMALE:We should've told skippy he was adopted long ago.
SUPMALE:Let's admit it, Harry.
LEADMALE:We made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I just said.
LEADMALE:Well, I agree with it, anyway.
LEADFEMALE:You know, rose, n-now that skippy is aware of the situation, you should feel relieved I mean, that the pretending's over.
OTHERMALE:Well, how can we feel relieved? We're so scared about what might happen if he meets Elizabeth Uh, his natural mother.
SUPFEMALE:Exactly what are you afraid of? What do you think might happen if they meet? Well, anything could happen anything could happen, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Skippy might like her better than he likes us, or she might try to get him to move in with her.
SUPMALE:You know, once somebody's met skippy, it's very hard for them to imagine living without him.
LEADMALE:You know, once, when he was 12, I was gonna tell him.
LEADMALE:I was all poised to say, "skippy, you're adopted.
LEADMALE:" But I lost my nerve.
SUPFEMALE:It came out, "skippy, you're a doctor.
LEADFEMALE:" I had to let him take my temperature.
LEADMALE:And now he wants to meet that other woman.
LEADFEMALE:Why is it so important to him? What kind of a son wants to meet his mother? 
LEADFEMALE:So, what should we do? I mean, are we crazy to be so upset? Should we let him meet her? Should we tell him where she lives? It's difficult to know what to do in these it's a very personal We're asking you for help.
LEADMALE:I mean, if you two had some personal problems, what two people would you call upon? Us, right? Huh.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what should we do? Uh, maybe we should tell him where she lives.
LEADMALE:I think it would mean a lot to skippy if you, uh, helped him find her.
SUPMALE: Well, look, rose.
LEADMALE:If if skippy doesn't meet his natural mother now, he's always gonna wonder about her.
SUPMALE:And I think it might be good for him if he thought that you weren't afraid for him to meet her.
LEADFEMALE:But we are.
OTHERFEMALE:We're supposed to be washing dishes, Mallory.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? I was just thinking.
SUPMALE:No, seriously.
LEADFEMALE:Alex! All right, all right.
LEADMALE:What are you thinking about? I was thinking about skippy.
SUPFEMALE:I know what you mean.
LEADMALE:I've been thinking about him, too.
LEADMALE:He's really upset about this adoption thing, isn't he? I think it's the way he found out, you know? He's innocently going through his mother's drawers, looking for money And he finds adoption papers.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when I was little, I used to think I was from another planet.
LEADFEMALE:Don't give up that thought, mal.
SUPFEMALE:And one day, my space mom would come down and find me and take me back there with her.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go up on the roof and wait for her? I just got off the phone with Mrs.
LEADMALE:handelman.
OTHERFEMALE:She's still really upset.
SUPMALE:Do you, uh Do you think they're gonna tell skippy where his mom is? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:That's a hard thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you're a mother.
SUPMALE:How could a mother just give away her own baby? I can't answer that.
SUPFEMALE:I-I don't know what the circumstances were.
LEADFEMALE:You just know that has to have been a very difficult thing to do.
SUPMALE:I guess she just did what she thought was best.
LEADMALE:When I have a baby, I'm gonna keep it.
LEADFEMALE:Even if it turns out to be an Alex.
SUPMALE:I kept him.
OTHERMALE:Well, it wasn't easy, Jennifer, but you are all packed.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Just think Tomorrow at this time, I'll be a full-fledged camper.
LEADMALE:Now, here are a few postcards.
OTHERFEMALE:They're all stamped and dated.
SUPMALE:All you have to do is send one to us every day.
SUPMALE:I can't write you a postcard every day.
LEADMALE:Well, I-i know that.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I pre-wrote a few for you.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear mom and dad, camp is fun, but I miss you terribly.
SUPFEMALE:" Now, all you have to do is sign one every day.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, why don't I just sign them all now? That way I won't have to take 'em to camp.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Can I come in? You're always welcome in this house.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Why is everybody being so nice to skippy? Well, haven't you heard? I'm adopted.
OTHERMALE:Have a seat, skip.
SUPFEMALE:I have the address of my real mother.
LEADMALE:No kidding.
LEADMALE:Where did you get it? From my fake mom.
LEADMALE:Skippy! I'm sorry, uh From Mrs.
SUPMALE:handelman.
LEADFEMALE:She kept in touch with my real mom's family over the years.
OTHERMALE:Are you gonna make contact with her? I'm gonna see her tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:She lives in Dayton.
SUPMALE:Are your parents driving you over? No.
LEADMALE:No, I-i couldn't ask 'em to do that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna take a bus first thing in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, skip, listen.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to do that.
OTHERMALE:I'll, uh, I'll drive you.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:You're a real friend.
SUPFEMALE:If you ever get adopted, I'll drive you to Dayton.
LEADMALE:Come on, Jennifer, let's go.
LEADMALE:We don't want to miss that bus! Hey, hey, dad, dad, dad.
OTHERMALE:Let me help you with that.

LEADFEMALE:Basically, you ate and slept and went through a lot of diapers.
LEADMALE:Those were good times, weren't they? Well Not completely good.
SUPFEMALE:No, I wouldn't say they were good times.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? That was a difficult period of my life.

LEADMALE:Why not? Irwin, you have parents.
LEADMALE:I'm sure you're very important to them.
SUPMALE:I have m-my own life, too.
SUPMALE:I can't become a mother, just like that.

LEADFEMALE:It would be very disruptive for both of us.
LEADFEMALE:You understand what I'm saying? Yeah, I understand.
LEADMALE:You don't want me.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have any idea how painful it is seeing you again? It took me 15 years to get my life together again, and you just want to rip it apart again.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want from me? I want to know how you could do it.
OTHERFEMALE:How could you? How could you just give me away? It was the hardest thing I ever had to do.
SUPFEMALE:But you still did it! I wanted you to have a good life! I couldn't give it to you.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted you to have a real family, nice house, and a dog.
SUPMALE:You have a dog, erwin? No.
LEADMALE:But I have a sister.
OTHERMALE:Even better.
LEADMALE:I'd rather have a dog.
LEADFEMALE:Well I'll be getting out of your way now.
LEADMALE:Irwin You may find this hard to believe, but I gave you away because I loved you.
SUPMALE:You were my baby boy.
LEADMALE:You remembered my name.
LEADFEMALE:So, skippy, uh You want something to drink? Uh, pretzels? No.
LEADMALE:No, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too depressed to eat.
SUPMALE:Hey, uh, why don't we toss a softball around, huh? How does that sound? Dangerous.
SUPFEMALE:In the state I'm in, I'd probably miss the ball, and it would hit me in the face.
OTHERMALE:Usually happens anyway, skip.
OTHERMALE:Alex, I'm in a daze.
SUPMALE:I'm stunned.
LEADFEMALE:My mother rejected me Again.
OTHERFEMALE:My mother never would've acted that way.
LEADFEMALE:That's just the point, skip.
LEADFEMALE:See, she wouldn't have done that Because she is your mother.
SUPMALE:She loves you.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Which mother are you talking about? I'm talking about your mother N-not Not the one from today, but your other mother Your real mother.
SUPMALE:The one from today is my real mother.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's true, but I was referring to the mother that you thought was your real mother until a few days ago.
LEADMALE:You mean my mother.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what I said, skip, your mother.
LEADMALE:When you said my mother, I thought you meant my mother, as in, the one who was my mother first.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about your other mother, not the mother who who knew you first.
LEADMALE:The mother that you knew first.
LEADMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:What about her? Look, skip.
LEADFEMALE:All all I'm trying to say to you is this.
SUPMALE:Y-your mother Didn't reject you.
LEADFEMALE:The woman who gave birth to you rejected you.
LEADMALE:You mean my mother? Let's not start this again, skip.
LEADMALE:Look When you were 7 years old, and you got your head caught in the banister, who got you loose? My mom.
OTHERMALE:Which mom? The one that raised me Mrs.
LEADMALE:handelman.
LEADMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:And when you were 13 years old, and you got your head caught in the banister who got you loose? That time it was my dad Mr.
SUPMALE:handelman.
LEADMALE:Skip If it wasn't for those two people Your head would be stuck in that banister right now.
LEADFEMALE:That's true.
LEADFEMALE:See The woman you met today is your natural mother.
LEADFEMALE:And and there's a guy out there who is your natural father.
OTHERMALE:But they haven't been a part of your life for 16 years.
LEADMALE:They they've had no role in in nurturing you, in molding you, in in caring for you.
SUPMALE:They, uh They created a baby But they had no part in creating the human being that's irwin n.
OTHERMALE:Handelman.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, even so, Alex How would you feel if you found out that your mom and dad aren't your natural parents? It would explain a lot of inconsistencies in my family.
LEADMALE:Look, what it gets right down to, skip, is The people who are most important in your life are the people who love you and the people who care about you.
LEADFEMALE:And you got those people, just as much as I do.

OTHERFEMALE:Alex, that was the answer.
LEADMALE:Excuse us, excuse us! Yes, just passing through! You can keep kissing.
SUPMALE:We're not looking.
LEADMALE:Look, this is the fifth time you've passed through here in the last hour.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind? How else are we supposed to get to the kitchen? I can get you to the kitchen real quick.
OTHERFEMALE:Ohh! Alex, come on.
SUPFEMALE:We have to concentrate.
SUPFEMALE:This is our last final.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right, rache.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:One more test, we leave Harding high in our dust.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you so anxious to leave? We had some great times there.
LEADMALE:You're right, rache We had some great times.
LEADFEMALE:And although it's with eager anticipation that we cast our lines of hope into the unchartered waters of the future, it is with a heavy heart that we bid adieu to the hallowed halls of Harding high.
LEADMALE:You've been working on your valedictory speech, haven't you, Alex? I admit, I have worked on it a little.
SUPMALE:It sounds great.
LEADFEMALE:You are gonna make a great valedictorian.
LEADMALE:Uh, come on, rache, it's not official yet.
LEADMALE:I mean, there are a lot of guys up for it.
LEADFEMALE:You're up for it.
LEADMALE:Uh, mark blittman, the the kowalik sisters.
LEADMALE:Face it, it's anybody's ballgame.
LEADMALE:It'll be you.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I am a shoo-in.
OTHERMALE:You know, I fed my stats into the school computer, and it printed out, "write that speech, Keaton.
OTHERFEMALE:" Oh, Alex, these last four weeks have been the most exciting in my whole life.
SUPMALE:Me too.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute, we've been seeing each other for six weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, but the first two were not that great.
SUPMALE:Ah, so how's the studying going? We are but sponges in a sea of chemical knowledge.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you'll clean up after yourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so how do you guys feel? Soon you'll be high school graduates.
LEADFEMALE:Feels great, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:And I know Alex is excited, too.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:And although it's with eager anticipation that we 
LEADMALE:Cast our lines of hope into the unchartered waters of our future, it is with a heavy heart that we bid adieu to the hallowed halls of Harding high.
LEADMALE:Seniors whose last names begin with the letters "a" through "j," please step forward.
SUPFEMALE:You know, rache, it's too bad our last names don't begin with the same letter.
LEADFEMALE:Then we could march down the aisle together.
OTHERMALE:That's got a nice ring to it.
LEADMALE:How is it possible that I never even asked you out until a couple weeks ago? What could I have been thinking about? Jocelyn Clark.
LEADMALE:And deena Marx and Carrie Newman and Diane Edwards and Okay, okay, okay, okay, rache.
SUPMALE:I don't know if I should admit this, Alex, but you're my first real boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Rache, I only hope I can live up to it.
SUPFEMALE:I only hope that I am deserving of such a great honor, that the flame of our spirit shall burn eternally.
SUPFEMALE:Is that from your speech, too? Seniors whose last names begin with the letters "k" through "t," please step forward.
SUPMALE:That's us.
LEADMALE:Before we proceed any further with the graduation rehearsal, I'd like to make an announcement.
SUPMALE:The faculty has just chosen the valedictorian.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm so proud of you! I couldn't have done it without you, rache.
SUPMALE:As you know, the faculty makes its selection on the basis of academic standing, extracurricular activities, and outstanding contributions to the school community.
LEADFEMALE:So won't you join me in congratulating the brightest and best among us, our most deserving new valedictorian Rachel Miller? Alex, are you all right? Me? I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:Are you sure you're okay? Oh, don't worry about me, rache.
SUPMALE:This is your big moment.
LEADMALE:I-I'm really happy for you.
LEADMALE:Come on up here and take a bow, Rachel.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Rachel.
SUPMALE:I never even thought I was in the running.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Rachel, all right! No more pencils, no more Books.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Last day of school.
LEADMALE:Look, I got my final grades.
LEADMALE:Oh, mal.
LEADMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, "a" in French, "b" in English, and some other stuff.
LEADMALE:We'll talk about that other stuff later.
LEADMALE:No rush! How'd you do, Alex? Four a's.
LEADMALE:An a-minus.
SUPMALE:Honey, that is terrific.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, mom.
LEADMALE:What does it mean really? I am not valedictorian.
LEADFEMALE:It's a hollow victory at best.
OTHERMALE:It's an anticlimax.
LEADMALE:Let's face it My life has no meaning.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I'm ready to face it.
LEADFEMALE:How about you guys? Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Okay, okay, I'm going.
LEADMALE:Alex, now, I know you're disappointed about this valedictorian thing, but you have got to accept the fact that you're not gonna get everything you want in life.
LEADMALE:Being valedictorian was my destiny.
SUPFEMALE:And it was ruthlessly yanked from my grasp by the cruelest of fates.
SUPMALE:That's the spirit.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Alex? Hi.
SUPMALE:Rachel.
SUPFEMALE:So how you doing, Alex? Oh, fine.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Never better.
SUPMALE:Did you get your final grades? Yeah.
LEADMALE:How were they? Oh, let's not talk about it.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:Come on, come on, come on.
SUPFEMALE:How were they? Five a's.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Rub my nose in it.
LEADMALE:So, what's up? Alex, I hope my being chosen valedictorian isn't gonna affect our relationship.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be silly.
LEADFEMALE:Smarty-pants.
OTHERMALE:Alex! I'm kidding.
LEADFEMALE:I'm kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, give me credit for for a little maturity here, okay? What's that? Well, I finished my, uh, my rough draft of my speech, and I was wondering if maybe you would take a look at it and give me your opinion.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Why not? Just remember, it's only a rough draft.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha ha! What? Is something funny? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You split your infinitive.
LEADMALE:Where? Several places here.
LEADMALE:You know, you do that when you speak.
LEADMALE:I noticed that about you.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, what about the speech? I mean overall.
LEADFEMALE:It's not bad.
LEADMALE:It won't offend anybody.
LEADMALE:I want to do more than not offend.
LEADMALE:I want to be inspiring.
SUPMALE:Did you think it was inspiring? I'd hate to be sending people off to war with that.
OTHERMALE:Well, how do I make it more inspiring? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right, rache.
LEADMALE:Uh, something Something like this As we, the graduating seniors here at Harding high, attempt to go Uh, aren't you gonna write this down? Well, I don't want you to dictate a speech to me.
LEADMALE:I mean, I want your general suggestions, but I want the heart of it to be my own.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:Just, uh, go with what you have there, then.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Is, um, something wrong? Look, rache, what do you want from me? You're the valedictorian.
SUPMALE:You obviously have your own ideas about what you want to say.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you even involving me in this? Well, I was foolish enough to think that maybe you'd want to help me.
LEADFEMALE:If it were me, I would help you.
OTHERMALE:If it were me, I wouldn't need your help.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe I don't need your help, either.
SUPMALE:You do if you're gonna go with that speech.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, there is nothing wrong with this speech! Okay, you're right, rache.
LEADMALE:There's nothing wrong with that speech.
SUPMALE:Why don't you go with that speech? I'll just walk through the audience and wake people up.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Oh, just looking at some old baby pictures of Alex.
OTHERMALE:Oh! There he is with his combination slide rule/teething ring.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:He was a beautiful baby.
SUPMALE:And tomorrow he's graduating.
LEADFEMALE:It all went so fast.
SUPMALE:Now, Elyse, don't go misting up on me.
LEADMALE:We've still got two in the nest.
LEADMALE:I guess I should face up to the fact that he's grown up, but did it have to happen so quickly? I mean, after high-school graduation, can marriage be far off? And then children and and grandchildren.
OTHERMALE:Don't put me in a home.
SUPFEMALE:Don't say anything until you see the place.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on, Elyse.
LEADMALE:You're getting a little carried away with this.
OTHERMALE:I guess you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, look.
SUPFEMALE:I got the watch back from the jeweler.
LEADFEMALE:It's working perfectly now.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be a wonderful gift for Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
OTHERMALE:I'll never forget the day my father gave this to me.
LEADMALE:He he he came home from that little dry-cleaning shop where he worked.
LEADFEMALE:He put this in my hand, and he said to me, "son, I want you to have this for your graduation.
SUPFEMALE:One of my customers left it in his pants.
LEADFEMALE:" He was all heart, my old man.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Ooh! Ah.
SUPFEMALE:What are you guys doing? Uh Listening to music.
LEADFEMALE:I don't hear anything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, the music's in our heads.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, mom, can I talk to dad, uh, alone for a minute? Sure, it's okay.
SUPMALE:I'll leave you two alone.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:When you were a little boy, you used to come to both of us for help.
OTHERMALE:Uh, what is it, Alex? Dad, I, uh I-I don't know how to say this, but, uh Well, this isn't easy for me.
LEADMALE:But, uh I think the Cleveland browns are really gonna miss Brian sipe next year, don't you? Uh Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:It was very sensitive of you to keep that from your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I figured she's a big browns fan and everything.
SUPMALE:Dad, I really blew it with Rachel yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:You mentioned this Brian sipe thing to her, too? No.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:We had a big fight.
LEADFEMALE:This valedictorian thing really threw me off.
LEADMALE:I was a real jerk.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you apologize to her? Dad, don't you see? That's not gonna solve the problem.
LEADMALE:This is going to change our relationship forever.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why, Alex? Don't you see? It'll always be with us.
SUPFEMALE:E-every time I kiss her, she'll be thinking, "why am I kissing this nonvaledictorian?" It's just not fair.
LEADMALE:It's not right.
LEADMALE:It's a gyp.
LEADFEMALE:A gyp? That's right.
LEADMALE:You know, Alex, uh, when you were little boy and things didn't go your way, you used to lie on the floor and scream, hold your breath and pout.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, now you're an adult, and you've got to accept some things that you don't like.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if it If it had been anyone else, I could have handled it.
LEADMALE:Mark blittman.
LEADMALE:The kowalik sisters.
LEADMALE:But not Rachel.
LEADFEMALE:My girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't feel comfortable in a relationship unless I'm number one.
SUPFEMALE:It is not a competition, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It is a relationship.
LEADFEMALE:Both partners are equal.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, uh I know you have to use that feminist rhetoric in front of mom But, uh, just between you and me, why don't you admit that you are still the man, that you're number one? I am the man, but I'm not number one, and neither is your mother.
LEADFEMALE:You can be the man without feeling you're superior to the woman.
LEADMALE:I'd think you'd feel, uh, happy for Rachel.
LEADFEMALE:Why should I feel happy to be in her shadow when she makes that speech tomorrow? Because it's her shadow.
OTHERMALE:You know, every year when another class graduates, I feel like I lose a little part of myself.
SUPMALE:And I'm not referring to my hair.
OTHERFEMALE:Commencement, as you know, means Alex! Alex! Alex! Beginning Quiet down.
LEADMALE:You're disrupting the ceremony.
SUPFEMALE:Alex! Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Harding high.
LEADFEMALE:And so often graduates return to tell me how valuable they've found their years at Harding.
LEADMALE:Mallory, I don't know if the caps and gowns were a tip-off, but there is a graduation ceremony going on here.
LEADMALE:Alex, I just saw Rachel in the ladies' room.
LEADMALE:She's really upset.
SUPMALE:You should talk to her.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute, he can't go in the ladies' room.
LEADMALE:She's not there anymore.
LEADMALE:I think she went backstage.
SUPFEMALE:She looked terrible.
LEADMALE:She's probably nervous about her speech, and that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Would you sit down? I don't think "nervous" quite describes it, mom.
SUPFEMALE:She couldn't remember the name of the school.
LEADMALE:She kept saying, "I'm very proud" to be valedictorian of this here place.
SUPFEMALE:" Look, I tried to talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:She wouldn't see me.
SUPMALE:Maybe you should try again.
LEADFEMALE:Shh! Sir? Me? Yes, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, is there something you'd care to share with the rest of us? Uh, no.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:T-that's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, thank Thank you for asking.
LEADFEMALE:Well, in that case, we'll proceed with the, uh, awarding of diplomas, followed by the valedictory address by Rachel Miller.
OTHERMALE:Alex, talk to her! Shh! Betsy afferton.
LEADMALE:Amanda agretti.
SUPMALE:"And I think Franklin Roosevelt expressed it best when he said" Oh, I wish I'd worn my other earrings.
LEADFEMALE:I think it was Eleanor Roosevelt who said that.
SUPFEMALE:Alex I told you I didn't want to see you anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but I want to see you.
SUPFEMALE:Look, we got to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I-I feel terrible about what happened the other day.
LEADMALE:Alex, in five minutes I have to do my speech, and I don't have time to listen to your rationalizations.
SUPMALE:If you really felt this bad, you would have called me before this.
OTHERMALE:Well, I've been busy.
SUPFEMALE:Doing what? Moping.
LEADFEMALE:And whining.
LEADFEMALE:And generally being a real idiot.
SUPFEMALE:You know, you'd be surprised how much time that takes if you want to do it right.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you hurt me.
SUPMALE:When I needed you, you really let me down.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, rache.
LEADFEMALE:When you were selected valedictorian, I-I lost sight of the things that were most important.
OTHERMALE:Why does it bother you so much that I'm valedictorian? I would have thought that you'd be happy for me.
SUPMALE:I mean, if we're gonna be a couple, we should build each other up and not compete at everything.
SUPMALE:I would have been happy for you.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Ruth drescher.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you always have to win at everything? I have a little problem in this area.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I don't want to compete with you at everything.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, rache, we're not always competing.
LEADFEMALE:We are.
LEADMALE:Give me an example of one other situation where I have been overly competitive with you.
OTHERFEMALE:When we went and played miniature golf and I beat you.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I handled that very well.
LEADMALE:Alex, you filed a formal protest with the manager.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't a formal protest.
LEADMALE:I simply asked him to examine your clubs to make sure they were regulation.
LEADMALE:Alex, I don't want to have to feel guilty for being chosen valedictorian over you or being a better golfer than you.
SUPMALE:You're absolutely right.
LEADMALE:Cheryl Juliet.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't say you're a better golfer than me.
OTHERMALE:You had one good game.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna work on this problem.
SUPFEMALE:It's gonna get better.
SUPFEMALE:I promise.
SUPFEMALE:Warren Kane.
SUPMALE:You'd better go out.
LEADMALE:They're gonna call your name soon.
LEADMALE:No, rache.
OTHERMALE:Uh, I refuse to graduate high school until we have this matter settled.
OTHERMALE:Alex p.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
OTHERMALE:Keaton, Alex p.
LEADFEMALE:Although I really would like to graduate.
SUPMALE:Go ahead, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You're not the dropout type.
LEADFEMALE:Last call for Alex p.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Marvin Kennedy.
SUPMALE:Got it.
LEADMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex, I don't want to lose you because I'm smarter than you.
OTHERMALE:You know, I wouldn't say you're sm You're not gonna lose me.
LEADMALE:You go out there and you give the best valedictory speech this school has ever heard.
LEADMALE:And I think Franklin Roosevelt expressed it best when he said, "this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.
OTHERMALE:" Once again, I thank the faculty for this honor.
LEADMALE:This will be a day that I will remember always.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Rachel, thank you very much.
LEADMALE:And now I'd like to extend a hearty congratulations to the graduating class of 1984.
LEADFEMALE:It's over, kids.
LEADMALE:Finally over with.

OTHERFEMALE:Oh, mom, look, you promised me you wouldn't go getting emotional on me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not emotional.
LEADMALE:My little baby boy! We're, uh, we're proud of you for holding it in.
SUPMALE:Well, we did it, Alex.
LEADMALE:We graduated.
LEADFEMALE:We did.
LEADMALE:You were great up there, Rachel.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you can give me some pointers for my vale Dic.
SUPMALE:.
LEADMALE:Tory speech when I graduate.
LEADMALE:Just graduate, mal.
LEADFEMALE:That's all we ask.
SUPMALE:Congratulations to both of you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, now let's get a picture of the two graduates.
LEADMALE:Hell of a speech, rache.
OTHERMALE:Very inspiring.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE: well, Jen, you're all set.
OTHERMALE:You've got your stuffed animals, your clock radio, and your baseball cards.
OTHERMALE:Is there anything else we can get you before we go? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Get me out of here! I don't want to have my tonsils out.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, we've been through this.
SUPFEMALE:Having your tonsils out is a very simple procedure.
SUPMALE:There's nothing to worry about.
OTHERFEMALE:Have you had yours out, mom? Wha no.
LEADFEMALE:Dad? Uh, let's see Uh.
LEADFEMALE:No, I-I've still got mine.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory? I wanted to.
LEADMALE:Nice chatting with you Uh, no, you don't.
OTHERMALE:No, come on.
SUPMALE:Come on, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:I apologize if he isn't, but is this person related to you? Why does everybody always ask us that? This is our son, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:See? Will you let go of me now, please? With pleasure.
LEADMALE:Alex, why are you in a white coat? He's been making rounds.
LEADMALE:I was making an informal survey of the quality of care in this institution.
LEADMALE:My sister is gonna be up there on that table tomorrow, and I want to make sure everything is okay.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, I think Mrs.
LEADMALE:ferguson in 104 could use another Alex! You're going to have to leave now.
LEADFEMALE:Visiting hours are just about over.
SUPFEMALE:Please don't tell anyone he's my brother.
SUPFEMALE:They might take it out on me when I'm unconscious.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, young lady.
LEADFEMALE:We are professionals.
LEADFEMALE:We don't let our personal feelings interfere with our work.
LEADMALE:A pox on you! Don't worry, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Everything's gonna be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, just relax and try and get some rest.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay? I'll try.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be back in your own bed tomorrow night.
SUPMALE:Sleep well.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Jen, if I were you, I would stretch this thing out, you know? I mean, have one tonsil out tomorrow, have another one out in a month or so.
LEADFEMALE:You double your sympathy.
LEADMALE:Come on, Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I promised Mrs.
LEADMALE:ferguson I'd check on her.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE: Dear diary Well, here I am in the hospital.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not scared.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe a little.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'm petrified.
LEADMALE:What if something happens to me? What if I never see my family again? I know I complain a lot to you about them, but I love 'em.
LEADMALE:What if I never get to say I'm sorry for all those bad things I've done? I don't know why I've been acting so childish lately.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's because I'm a child.
SUPMALE:Mallory and I used to have so much fun together when we were younger.
LEADMALE:Now she's a lot more interested in boys and clothes than she is in me.
LEADMALE:I guess I'm jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:I could understand being interested in clothes, but the part about boys, I just don't get it.
OTHERMALE:Mallory, do you want to play checkers tonight? Do I look like I'm dressing for checkers, Jennifer? No, I'd say that's more of a parcheesi outfit.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, you promised you'd play with me.
LEADFEMALE:I got everything all ready.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, I don't have time for childish games.
SUPFEMALE:I have a date tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Do I look all right? Your cheeks are uneven.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? I mean there's more red stuff on one side than the other.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have any red stuff on.
LEADMALE:Wow, then you're really in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, you're making me nervous.
SUPFEMALE:You're always nervous before a date.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm not.
OTHERFEMALE:Then why'd you brush your teeth seven times in the last hour? Maybe she's going out with a dentist.
LEADFEMALE:I happen to be going out with Kevin Jenkins.
LEADMALE:I've had a crush on him since the beginning of the year.
OTHERMALE:Do you mind, Alex? No, I don't mind.
SUPFEMALE:How does Kevin feel about it? He doesn't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:That's Kevin.
LEADMALE:I'm not ready.
LEADFEMALE:What should I do? We'll, uh We'll entertain him while you're making yourself presentable.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:We'll, uh We'll set him up in the guest room.
LEADFEMALE:Yo.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
SUPFEMALE:You must be Kevin.
LEADMALE:You must be Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Guess, uh Guess Mallory's told you a lot about me, huh? Yeah.
SUPMALE:How'd your shock treatments work out? Fine.
SUPMALE:Uh, just Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm Jennifer.
LEADMALE:You're Jennifer? You know, from the way Mallory described you, I thought you were just a baby.
LEADMALE:Ha ha Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, that that's funny, isn't it? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Goo-goo.
LEADMALE:Tell me, Kevin, how is it that you, uh That you know our dear sister? I sit in front of her in biology.
LEADMALE:Mallory's had a crush on you for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Jennifer I didn't know that.
OTHERMALE:I don't think you were supposed to.
LEADFEMALE:Oops.
LEADMALE:Silly me.
LEADMALE:You know how us babies are.
LEADMALE:So Uh, where are you two young people off to tonight? Well I thought we'd go see the, um The nuclear-disarmament film.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory said she loves documentaries.
SUPMALE:Did she? She's also said that she's interested in a lot of the same causes that I am Disarmament, protecting our natural resources, improving diplomatic relations with third-world nations.
SUPFEMALE:That's our Mallory.
SUPMALE:So, Kevin, can I interest you in some swampland in Florida? Kidding.
SUPMALE:Joking.
SUPMALE:Well, I got another shock treatment.
LEADMALE:I gotta go.
SUPMALE:They, uh, double the voltage if you're late.
SUPMALE:Are you saying that Mallory just pretended to be interested in those things because I am? You got it.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, she wouldn't be interested in a documentary on nuclear disarmament, then? She might be interested in what the protesters are wearing.
OTHERMALE:I think I get the picture.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Kevin.
LEADFEMALE:Love your sweater.
OTHERFEMALE:See what I mean? Well, uh, Mallory, suppose you tell me where you want to go since you don't like documentaries.
SUPMALE:But I love documentaries.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what I hear.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, what have you been telling Kevin? Just making small talk.
OTHERFEMALE:And what kind of movies does Mallory really like, Jennifer, huh? Why are you asking her what I like? Because maybe she'll tell me the truth.
LEADFEMALE:What is that supposed to mean? Well, Jennifer's been telling me quite a lot.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Well, maybe you'd like to bring her along with us on the date.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe I would.
LEADMALE:I'll get my coat.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you'd rather not go out at all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you'd rather not go.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Let's not go.
SUPFEMALE:I have to wash my hair tonight anyway.
LEADMALE:Me too.
LEADMALE:I mean, I have to shave Again.
SUPFEMALE:Well See you around.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We'll see you.
LEADMALE:Ready for checkers? That was really horrible, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE: I knew I was being horrible.
SUPMALE:But I just couldn't stop myself.
LEADMALE:I wanted Mallory to stay home and play with me like she used to.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I'd grow up already.
SUPFEMALE:Then maybe I wouldn't do so many stupid things, like the way I blew up at dad when he wouldn't let me have my way.
LEADMALE:It started like any other day.
LEADFEMALE:Mom was late, Mallory was looking in the mirror Alex was being pompous.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, kids.
LEADMALE:Bye, kids.
LEADFEMALE:I will see you tonight.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, Alex? Ma, don't you know that the key to a successful day is a good breakfast? Girls, make your mother some breakfast.
OTHERMALE:Frankly, I just don't have time today.
LEADMALE:Mom, can I go to the movies with Chrissy tonight? Now, honey, you went to the movies with Chrissy last night.
LEADMALE:That was Chrissy's birthday.
LEADMALE:It was an exception.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like you going out on a school night two nights in a row.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if dad says yes, can I go? No.
LEADFEMALE:And I don't want you to ask him.
LEADMALE:I don't like it when you do that.
SUPMALE:Now I got to run, honey.
LEADMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I worry about you.
SUPFEMALE:I know the feeling.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Morning, dad.
OTHERFEMALE: Hi, dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Hi, daddy! Oh, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, don't you look very handsome today.
LEADMALE:Well Thank you, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:No, I mean it.
LEADMALE:You know, the way a man dresses tells us a lot about him.
LEADMALE:That tie, for example, says that you're an open-minded individual.
LEADFEMALE:That's what they say.
LEADFEMALE:One tie is worth a thousand words.
OTHERMALE:That's very funny, dad! Did you guys hear that? Say it again, dad, please.
LEADMALE:One tie is worth Dad We heard it.
SUPMALE:Hey, take it easy, dad.
SUPFEMALE:My side hurts from laughing.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, I was thinking of going to the movies with Chrissy tonight.
SUPFEMALE:You know Chrissy The one who thinks you're such a wonderful man.
LEADMALE:I got to get out of here.
LEADMALE:Uh What did your mother say? Mom? I know she was talking about how happy she is being married to a man like you.
SUPMALE:I can't take it, either.
SUPMALE:Jennifer You went to the movies last night.
SUPFEMALE:It was Chrissy's birthday.
SUPFEMALE:It was an exception.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want you going out two school nights in a row.
OTHERMALE:Do you and mom rehearse? Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Okay, we'll compromise.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't want me going to the movies on a school night I won't go to school tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds reasonable Wait a minute! No way, j Cut it out! I thought you guys were supposed to be so Liberal, so open-minded.
SUPFEMALE:Sure had me fooled.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, I thought I made myself clear.
SUPFEMALE:This discussion is over.
LEADMALE:You can't go.
LEADMALE:Come on, dad.
OTHERMALE:Chrissy's father said she could go.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm not Chrissy's father, I'm your father.
LEADFEMALE:Too bad for me, isn't it? Hol a minute ago, I was father of the year.
SUPMALE:Yeah?! Well, things change fast around here, buster! And I'll tell you another thing That tie Is right-wing! 
SUPMALE:Dear diary Guess who.
LEADMALE:Good guess.
LEADFEMALE:I keep waking up.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it doesn't matter if I'm tired in the morning 'cause they're just gonna put me to sleep again.
OTHERMALE:I sure hope my surgeon's getting a good night's sleep, though.
SUPMALE:I just dreamt that I went home after the operation, and nobody recognized me without my tonsils.
LEADMALE:There was another girl living in my room who looked just like me, but she was a lot nicer than I am.
LEADMALE:She didn't argue with anyone, not even Alex.
LEADMALE:You remember Alex, don't you, diary? Sure, you do.
SUPMALE:How could you forget him? Girls, girls.
SUPMALE:I need your help.
LEADMALE:I need you to rehearse with me.
LEADMALE:I'm trying out for a part in the school play.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, what I'd like you to do Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Yo, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Uh, where you going? Aren't you gonna help me? No, Alex.
LEADMALE:I have too much respect for the theater.
LEADMALE:Besides, "gilligan's island's" on now.
LEADMALE:Alex, why the sudden interest in the theater? I have always been interested in the theater.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, the theater happens to be a link to the past.
LEADFEMALE:It's an art form as old as man himself A continuum of judeo-Christian amusement as we know it.
LEADMALE:Besides, Melanie Parker's playing the female lead.
OTHERFEMALE:Say no more.
LEADMALE:Uh, look, the, uh The play we're doing is called "a streetcar named desire.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm trying out for the role of Stanley Kowalski.
LEADFEMALE:It's a part that calls for raw, unbridled manly passion.
LEADMALE:Maybe they'll let you work the lights.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, can you put down the apple, please? Why? Well, because you can't read lines and chew at the same time.
SUPFEMALE:Brando could do it.
SUPMALE:You're not Brando.
LEADFEMALE:That makes two of us.
LEADFEMALE:All right? Hey, there, Stella, baby.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Okay, all right.
SUPMALE:Why you laughing? Your accent.
LEADMALE:You sound like deputy dawg.
SUPFEMALE:I happen to have a perfectly acceptable Southern accent.
LEADFEMALE:Susie sperber's from Virginia, and she doesn't talk like that.
SUPMALE:I'm not doing susie sperber.
LEADMALE:I'm doing Stanley Kowalski.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jennifer, this is very important to me.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Listen I'm gonna go outside and pretend I'm calling you from the street.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to stand right here and pretend you're answering me from the balcony.
SUPMALE:Gotcha, Stanley.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, there, Stella, baby.
SUPMALE:Stella-a? Hey, Stella! Jennifer! Hey, Jennifer! 
SUPFEMALE:Alex didn't get the part Or Melanie Parker.
LEADMALE:Why did I give him such a hard time? Sure, he's not a normal person, but he's a good brother.
SUPFEMALE:Stella! 
OTHERMALE:He always helps me when I need it.
SUPMALE:Mom says I should be nicer.
LEADFEMALE:She's right.
LEADMALE:I think I feel worst of all about the way I treated her.
SUPFEMALE:It's not easy for her going back to work after all these years.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't made it any easier.
OTHERMALE:I hope you like this.
LEADMALE:I've never made soufflÃ© before.
LEADFEMALE:No kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Is there a power saw in the garage? I'm i-I'm sure we'll love it, uh Won't we, kids? Well, I suppose it's within the realm of possibility.
SUPFEMALE:Ahh.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think? Uh, Jennifer, can you pass me the water, please? Sure.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I think you went a little overboard on the pepper, Mallory.
LEADMALE:I only put in a cup.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, if mom keeps working through dinner, we're all gonna lose a lot of weight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna get some leftovers from the fridge.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, your mom's working very hard now.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure she'd rather be home for dinner.
SUPMALE:But it's a new job, and there's a lot for her to learn.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Once she knows her job is secure, she can slack off.
OTHERMALE:You know, Mallory, in your own unwitting fashion, you just explained why socialism can never work.
LEADMALE:I wish mom were home more often.
LEADMALE:I keep forgetting what she looks like.
LEADFEMALE:That's her, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What a day! The computer kept printing out football standings instead of floor plans.
LEADMALE:And then on the way home, Steven, the car started acting up.
SUPFEMALE:Will you take a look at it, please? It's in the engine But it's spreading.
OTHERFEMALE:We're having leftovers tonight, mom.
LEADMALE:I kind of ruined dinner.
SUPMALE:But I'll make it up to you when I cook breakfast tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Did I mention I'm having breakfast in Europe tomorrow? Looks like somebody forgot to do the breakfast dishes.
LEADMALE:Whose turn was it? Mine.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you do them? Guess I forgot.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's your responsibility to remember.
SUPMALE:What's the difference? You're gone all day.
LEADFEMALE:Who's gonna notice? Well, just because I'm working doesn't mean you can shirk your responsibilities here at home.
SUPMALE:Why not? You do.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mallory? I think this would be a good time for you and me to be anywhere but here.
LEADMALE:Alex, for once in our lives, I agree with you.
OTHERMALE:I think I'll go with them.
SUPMALE:Not until you tell me what's going on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just tired of doing so many chores all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Well, nobody likes chores, but everybody has to do them.
SUPMALE:Alex and Mallory didn't have to do so many when they were my age.
SUPMALE:We're not talking about Alex and Mallory.
LEADMALE:We're talking about Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Since when did you care about Jennifer? What do you mean? Mom, if you cared about me, you wouldn't have had me last! Jennifer! Well, it's true.
LEADMALE:When Alex and Mallory were young, you were always home for them.
LEADFEMALE:I hardly ever see you.
OTHERMALE:W-why didn't you tell me you felt like this before? Because you were too busy.
SUPMALE:Oh, it looks like we have a real problem.
SUPFEMALE:Look, why why don't you sit down sit down, and we'll talk? Oh, I don't have time.
SUPFEMALE:I have to do my chores.
LEADMALE:You know, mom, ever since you started working, it's been no fun around here.
SUPFEMALE:Hope you're happy.
LEADMALE:Oh! 
LEADMALE:Poor mom.
LEADFEMALE:She got stuck with a spoiled soufflÃ© and a spoiled brat.
LEADFEMALE:How could I be so selfish? I'm so proud of her for going back to work, and being so good at it.
SUPMALE:I want to be just like her when I grow up, except for one thing.
OTHERMALE:I want a nicer daughter than me.
SUPMALE:Well, diary, I know one thing If I make it through this operation okay Which I probably won't, the first thing I'm gonna do is tell everyone in my family how sorry I am for all those selfish things I did to them.
SUPMALE:Oh, sure, Mallory, go ahead and laugh.
OTHERFEMALE:I am never gonna be able to show my face in this hospital again, and you think it's funny.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Alex.
SUPMALE:It's just I've never seen a man faint before.
SUPFEMALE:Well, keep it down.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing to be ashamed of, Alex.
LEADMALE:It happens to a lot of people when they give blood.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, those two old ladies in front of me looked really woozy.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:The next time the family gives blood, just drop me off at the nearest quilting bee.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's waking up.
SUPFEMALE:Jen, you okay? No Shh.
SUPMALE:Don't try and talk.
SUPMALE:The doctors want you to save your throat.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry, your voice will be back in a day or two.
SUPMALE:The operation went just fine, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:The doctor said it was so easy, he could have done it blindfolded.
OTHERMALE:In fact, he wore Steven! I'm just What a trouper! I think she wants to play charades.
LEADMALE:Uh, writing, writing a book.
SUPMALE:A book, a book title "from here to eternity.
LEADMALE:" 
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Uh, no.
SUPMALE:Uh, no "no, no, nanette"! You know, I think maybe she wants a pencil and paper.
LEADFEMALE:Honey.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know you kept a diary, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I thought I was the only one who did.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Yours is the only one we read.
OTHERFEMALE:"You would have been a great Stanley.
SUPMALE:" Uh, thanks, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:I think I make a pretty good Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What is she talking about, Alex? I don't know, dad.
SUPFEMALE:Is she still under sedation? "You look very pretty when you go out on dates.
OTHERFEMALE:" Yeah.
SUPMALE:Definitely still under sedation.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Jennifer I'm afraid you'll have to leave now.
LEADMALE:Our patient needs her rest.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:See you later, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh I heard about your little mishap at the blood bank.
LEADMALE:I hear you dropped like a stone.
OTHERMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:No, honey.
SUPMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:No more games.
SUPMALE:Just listen to the nurse and try and get some rest, honey.
LEADMALE:We'll be back later, okay? 
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Hon, time for a nap.
LEADMALE:You trying to tell me something, dear? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:You want to play charades.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You want me to read this.
SUPMALE:"I love you.
LEADMALE:" Well, isn't that sweet, dear? I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPMALE:This is for them.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm sure they know you love them.
LEADMALE:Now you try to get some sleep.
LEADMALE:We love you, too, darling.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my girl.
SUPFEMALE:She's right.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:mom, can I talk to you? - In a minute, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta finish my rÃ©sumÃ©, and then I'm off to the interview.
OTHERMALE:Uh, why don't you talk to your father? He can't help me.
SUPMALE:It's about boys.
SUPMALE:Yeah, how would I know about them? You know my philosophy, Mallory.
LEADMALE:If a boy makes you start asking questions, cut him loose.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how's the resume coming, mom? Finished.
SUPFEMALE:I fudged a little bit, but basically it's me.
LEADFEMALE:Did you, uh, - put in those things I told you? - Some.
LEADFEMALE:I left out the part about me designing the Eiffel Tower.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, ma, they never check that stuff.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, I hope not.
SUPFEMALE:I did take some of your advice, and I put all my attributes on page one, right at the top and the center.
LEADMALE:And then I hid the fact that I haven't worked in an office for 12 years on page two, under the staple.
SUPFEMALE:I also changed 12 years to 144 months.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know why I'm going on this interview anyway.
LEADMALE:They probably don't want me.
LEADFEMALE:They probably want someone more up to date, someone younger.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, grandma Moses didn't start painting until she was 80.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:That still gives you a couple years.
SUPMALE:Just trying to relax you.
SUPMALE:Mom, all you've been talking about the past two weeks is how much you want this job.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I thought you wanted to expand your horizons.
LEADMALE:I thought you wanted more challenging work.
SUPMALE:I thought you wanted to make more money.
SUPMALE:I do want all those things, but I'm scared.
LEADMALE:You've got first-day jitters, mom.
SUPMALE:I get the same thing every fall when I go back to school.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I worry about my new teacher, my new classroom, new kids everything.
LEADMALE:But the first day always works out for me.
LEADMALE:And it will for you, too.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, sometimes I throw up around lunchtime.
SUPFEMALE:Wha what are you worrying about? You're a terrific catch for any architectural firm.
LEADMALE:You know what you're doing, you're experienced, you're reliable.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, mom, let's go over your assets and your liabilities.
SUPMALE:Can't we just go over my assets? May I? Okay.
LEADMALE:Elyse Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's a nice name.
LEADFEMALE:That should count as an asset.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's a fine name, mom, but, uh, let's face it.
SUPMALE:It's not gonna get you the job.
OTHERMALE:Your, uh, references seem to be in order.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, enough.
SUPFEMALE:We don't have to add up your assets and liabilities.
SUPMALE:When they meet you and read this rÃ©sumÃ©, they're gonna be very impressed.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:You've all been very supportive.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to be late.
LEADMALE:Any last-minute advice? Ask about vacation.
LEADMALE:Find out if there's a gum ball machine.
LEADFEMALE:Be yourself.
LEADMALE:Don't tell 'em you're a woman.
SUPMALE:sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm I'm waiting here for Karen banks.
SUPFEMALE:You're lookin' at her.
OTHERFEMALE:Just kidding.
LEADMALE:Actually, I'm Karen dugan.
LEADFEMALE:Kidding again.
OTHERMALE:Bill Channing.
SUPMALE:Really? Would I kid you? Elyse Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:So you're here for the new job, huh? Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:I'm an architect myself.
LEADFEMALE:You are? You are.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'm Karen banks.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:No kidding.
LEADMALE:She is.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry we have to meet here in bill's office.
OTHERFEMALE:The conference room is tied up.
LEADFEMALE:Bill, I would like to conduct an interview in here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I got a couple extra minutes.
SUPFEMALE:What would you like to know? I would like to know when you're leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:He is actually a very fine architect.
LEADFEMALE:I could tell.
OTHERMALE:May I see your rÃ©sumÃ©, please? Ah, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I have nothing to hide.
SUPMALE:Well, I see you haven't worked in an office for 12 years.
LEADFEMALE:Has it been that long? It didn't seem more than 144 months.
LEADMALE:A-anything else that needs clarification? Everything seems to be in order.
LEADMALE:Ah, no one really checks up on those rÃ©sumÃ©s anyway, huh? We do.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell me why you would like to take a full-time job again.
SUPMALE:Well, uh, I, um I am an architect.
LEADMALE:And now that my, uh, kids can take care of themselves, I-I thought I'd go back to, uh, to work, uh, for what I'm trained to do, in a - In a more meaningful way.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, but more than anything, I'm tired of working out of my kitchen.
LEADMALE:Do you know how hard it is working when When you know that you're just inches away from fudge brownies? Well, you won't have that problem here.
SUPMALE:There's one question I've been asking all the applicants.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:What do you feel should be the role of the architect in the 1980s? And what did they say? I think, uh I-I think we should take advantage of the new technology, but, uh, to build and not destroy.
SUPMALE:Uh, take for example the old Morgan house.
LEADMALE:It was beautiful.
SUPMALE:and they tore it down and put up a parking lot.
LEADMALE:Now, that's the kind of thing that makes me crazy.
SUPFEMALE:That was one of our jobs.
LEADMALE:Are you sure this dress is gonna be ready - for Chrissy's party? - Positive.
LEADFEMALE:It's a very simple pattern.
LEADMALE:You'll see, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna pick up this sewing stuff really quickly.
LEADMALE:Uh, remember, Mallory, the thread goes through the needle.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be surprised, Alex.
SUPMALE:I know how important it is for a woman to learn how to sew.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you're a real woman of the '80s.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:So how did the interview go? Hi.
SUPMALE:Not very well.
SUPMALE:She didn't like me.
SUPFEMALE:She was very, very cold.
LEADMALE:Now, it's not that I expected a big banner saying, "welcome back to architecture, Elyse Keaton.
OTHERMALE:" But I thought, well, at least, you know, a cake.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you made a good first impression, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:You always do.
LEADMALE:From the moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were the only architect for me.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I'm better off if I don't get the job.
LEADMALE:I mean, what do I need a job for? T-the commuting, having a boss.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I-I'm doing okay working here at home.
LEADFEMALE:I know exactly what you mean, mom.
LEADMALE:I mean, I could take geometry next semester.
SUPFEMALE:There's a chance I could handle it, but then there's a chance I couldn't handle it.
LEADFEMALE:So why bother, right? I-I don't think it's the same thing, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Elyse, it's okay to admit you're scared about a new job.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not scared.
LEADFEMALE:Don't answer that! M-maybe I'm a little scared.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, she is.
SUPMALE:One moment, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Speaking.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Karen.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Well, thanks for letting me know.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I got the job! Oh! They liked the fact that That I was older.
LEADMALE:And that I-i had more experience, and they appreciated my honesty at the interview.
SUPMALE:Go figure.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, bill.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, roomie.
LEADMALE:Hey, congratulations on getting the job.

LEADMALE:That's my table.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, where's mine? Right here.
LEADMALE:Just breaking it in for you.
LEADMALE:Well, nice to see you.
SUPMALE:How's everything? Actually, I'm having kind of a rough week.
LEADMALE:I can't get my girlfriend to give me her new phone number.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, why don't you just look it up in the book? You know her last name? Enough about me.
LEADMALE:You know, I think you're really gonna like it here.
LEADMALE:Why don't you let me introduce you to the machines.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, machines, come on over here and meet Elyse.
LEADMALE:All right, have it your own way.
SUPFEMALE:We've got the runnymede 1800k word processor, the merriwell c.

SUPMALE:System.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, these machines are unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, they are.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Elyse, I see you're making yourself at home.
LEADMALE:-Yes.
LEADMALE:We were just talking about the machines.
LEADFEMALE:-Ah.
LEADFEMALE:I assume you're familiar with the merriwell computer-aided design and drafting system.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I-I've never actually used the merriwell, but, uh, how different can it be from any other appliance? Right.
LEADMALE:Well, it could be helpful with the Manhattan corporation project.
LEADMALE:We're bidding on a combination office building/health club.
LEADMALE:Bill is designing the office building part of the project.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be working on the health club.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sounds exciting.
SUPMALE:We have tentatively scheduled a presentation with Mr.
LEADMALE:halifax He's head of Manhattan For two weeks from tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:Two weeks? Isn't that enough time? I-it's more than enough.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADMALE:Site plan.
LEADMALE:Budget.
SUPMALE:Specifications.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for everything.
LEADFEMALE:So let's get to know each other.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me a little bit about yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Family? Kids? - I but i - I don't have any myself.
LEADMALE:Though I was married once.
LEADMALE:Well, twice if you count my cousin.
LEADFEMALE:So, what kind of stuff you been working on lately? Oh, well, the last thing You know, for my senior project, I worked on an entire city of the future.
LEADMALE:Large enough for a half a million people.
SUPFEMALE:It was quite a challenge.
LEADFEMALE:Maximizing geometric aesthetics while maintaining a restrained functionalism.
OTHERMALE:What did you say you did last? I-I just finished a remodel on the Wilsons' ranch house.
SUPFEMALE:We we totally redid the kitchen, which involved putting up a new beam to support the roof.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:A beam.
SUPFEMALE:So, guess you're pretty anxious to get your hands on those little babies, huh? No, I-i can wait my turn.
LEADMALE:Bill, I need to go over these design plans with you.
LEADMALE:There is nothing here that I wanted.
LEADMALE:It's the opposite of what we discussed.
LEADFEMALE:She wants me.
LEADMALE:Can't be much different than a typewriter.
SUPMALE:"The quick brown fox.
SUPFEMALE:" Oh.
LEADMALE:Bing.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, stop.
LEADFEMALE:Stop! Stop! Stop! Elyse, I can't believe you're still working.
SUPMALE:Why don't you take a break? The presentation is tomorrow.
LEADMALE:I'll take a break the day after.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? It's very flattering.
SUPMALE:Have you alerted women's wear daily? Mom, you've got to show Mallory how to do the other sleeve.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I forgot we were sewing tonight.
LEADMALE:I think I did a pretty good job.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you? She'll grow into it.
LEADFEMALE:I won't grow into it by Saturday.
LEADMALE:Mom, I need to wear it for Chrissy's party.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I can't help you tonight.
LEADMALE:That's what you've said for the past five nights.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, look, I'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:A-after you kids go to bed, I'll finish it.
LEADFEMALE:But the whole idea was for me to learn how to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, honey, you can't have everything.
LEADMALE:I am doing the best I can! Girls, girls, your mother's really busy.
LEADFEMALE:I think we should let her work, huh? Well, if you're too busy for us Mom, I sympathize with what you're going through.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, today's woman is in a very difficult position.
LEADMALE:Tradition and certainly biology have put her in the home.
LEADFEMALE:Now there are these ridiculous new feminist pressures for her to do things outside the home, like developing a career.
LEADFEMALE:Your anxiety is natural, mom.
LEADFEMALE:You can't fool with mother nature.
LEADFEMALE:Say good night, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, um I've done a lot of presentations.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes a little joke can get you off on the right foot.
SUPMALE:Maybe, uh Maybe something like this Um A guy and his, uh, dog go into a bar.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm just trying to help.
LEADMALE:A-aren't you supposed to come up with just one design, just one health club? Thank you, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I know what I'm doing.
LEADMALE:Look, once I've laid out all the options, I-I'm going to synthesize them into a single, coherent proposal.
SUPMALE:Elyse I can handle it! I can handle it! Look, Elyse, it's after 10:00.
LEADFEMALE:You promised to sew Jennifer's dress.
LEADMALE:You're gonna be up all night.
LEADFEMALE:You're obviously overworked.
SUPMALE:Now, why don't you talk to Karen about that? I can't! I can't I can't let her know I'm having problems already.
LEADMALE:But you are.
LEADFEMALE:You're pretending you know how to use the computer.
SUPMALE:You're working at a pace that's much faster than what you're used to.
SUPMALE:You're not used to their system there, and you're afraid to ask questions.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just say I'm failing on the job? All all I'm saying is that maybe you should ask for a little help at work.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, I could use a little help around here, too.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll be glad to help.
LEADMALE:That is exactly what I don't want! What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about.
LEADMALE:For the past two weeks, you've been doing more cooking than usual.
LEADMALE:You've been spending more time with the kids.
SUPMALE:You have been sweeter, kinder, more understanding than you have ever been in your life, and I am sick of it! I am trying to be supportive.
SUPFEMALE:I'm trying to help.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Steven, all sorts of women have families and full-time jobs without your help.
LEADFEMALE:That's because I'm not married to them.
LEADFEMALE:But you're telling me you'd like it if you were? Look, Elyse I know you're under a lot of pressure right now.
LEADFEMALE:Evidently you've got to let off a little steam, so go ahead.
SUPMALE:Nothing you can say will make me mad.
SUPMALE:And you call yourself supportive! So in conclusion, Mr.
SUPMALE:halifax, my goal here was to design an office that was more impressive than the offices of the heads of general motors, IBM, at&t, for, in my opinion, you are a more impressive executive than any of those men.
SUPFEMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's the, uh, that's the office in a nutshell.
LEADMALE:Uh, it was a pleasure to design.
LEADFEMALE:And if I may be so bold as to say, you were an inspiration.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you, bill.
LEADFEMALE:That was very good.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what do you think, Mr.
LEADMALE:halifax? It's not what I had in mind at all.
OTHERMALE:I didn't think so, and that's why I'd be more than willing to work on this until I get it exactly right.
LEADMALE:It's not what I had in mind, but I thought it was brilliant.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you have a keen eye.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure you never studied architecture yourself? Positive.
LEADFEMALE:Never been to college.
SUPFEMALE:Self-made man.
LEADMALE:I didn't want to go to college either.
SUPFEMALE:My parents made me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:halifax, I'm glad you're so pleased with the office building.
LEADFEMALE:Now Elyse will show us what the health club's going to be like.
LEADMALE:Warmed him up for you, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Go get him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm real excited about this project, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:halifax, as I'm sure you are, too.
LEADMALE:Before I start the presentation, I'm reminded of a little story.
SUPMALE:This man and his dog go into a bar Elyse.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't stop her.
OTHERFEMALE:This sounds good.
LEADMALE:What kind of a dog was it? Bill.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, please continue.
LEADMALE:And the bartender says, "hey" Elyse.
OTHERMALE:The presentation.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Um, here is the one-story plan.
LEADFEMALE:Here is the multi-story plan.
SUPFEMALE:And here we have a special one The underground gymnasium plan.
SUPFEMALE:Now, uh, within each plan there are several subplans, and we can go over the aspects of each, and you can decide which you like best.
OTHERFEMALE:You're being cute, right? You really just have one proposal.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you did design a health club, didn't you? I really didn't get a chance to narrow it down to just one.
SUPFEMALE:Believe me I wanted to, but I ran out of time last night.
SUPFEMALE:Had to make all those lunches before I went to bed, then I lost the sleeve on Jennifer's dress.
OTHERMALE:Let's start with the underground gymnasium plan.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, that will give you the best of all possible worlds.
SUPFEMALE:And who deserves that more than you, huh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:h? Karen, I'm a busy man.
LEADMALE:I don't have time to look through all these things.
SUPMALE:Now, I'm paying this architectural firm to design my building.
LEADMALE:If I wanted to design it myself, I would have done so.
SUPFEMALE:And I bet you'd have done a heck of a job, Mr.
SUPMALE:h.
SUPFEMALE:I have an idea.
LEADMALE:Why don't you put some of these plans on the computer, and we can see which you like best.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:The computer.
OTHERMALE:Well, why don't I just draw it up on pencil and paper.
LEADMALE:The computer's so impersonal.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I like it.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Uh, well Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I-i can't use the computer.
LEADMALE:Why not? I-I simply don't know how to use the machine.
LEADFEMALE:I've been faking it.
OTHERMALE:Karen, what's going on here? Is this some kind of affirmative-action thing? Did you have to hire that person? Now, see here, Mr.
OTHERMALE:halifax What is it? See here I didn't hear you that well.
SUPFEMALE:See? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:halifax, I-i apologize for wasting your time.
OTHERFEMALE:Karen, I'm I'm I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tired of pretending.
OTHERMALE:Pretending that I know everything about architecture today.
LEADFEMALE:Pretending that That having a job and And three kids is a piece of cake.
OTHERMALE:The the truth of the matter is it's It's hard to design a building under this kind of pressure.
OTHERMALE:It's it's hard using machines you've never even heard of before! And it is damn hard coming back to work after all these years.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that seemed to go pretty well.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven, I made such a fool out of myself.
OTHERMALE:What ever made me think I could handle a job like that? Elyse, just because this one presentation didn't work out doesn't mean you're not qualified for the job.
SUPMALE:How did the joke go over? Did you go Like I told you? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, Steven, I-it's Karen and bill - from the office.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, of course.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Steven.
LEADMALE:Boy, I've heard a lot about you, big guy.
OTHERMALE:I think you'll beat that morals charge.
LEADMALE:Elyse, Â¿quÃ© pasa? Oh, left your purse at the office.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:You got a lot of interesting things in there.
LEADMALE:Uh, I'm sure the three of you have a lot to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:You're out of here.
SUPMALE:You have a way with words, bill.
SUPMALE:Come and sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, why didn't you just tell me you were having problems? We all have problems at work, and we all ask each other for help.
SUPMALE:I-I guess I wanted you to think I could do the job.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's exactly what I do think.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, you have years of experience.
SUPFEMALE:You're practical, and yet you're one of the most creative people I've ever met.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I-I am really embarrassed.
LEADFEMALE:I-I've been trying to do everything, and, uh, I can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I t-thought that was what you expected of me, and all the anger and frustration built up and just, well, came out.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it was something to see.
LEADFEMALE:You're quite beautiful when you're angry.
SUPFEMALE:We sifted through your ideas at the office.
LEADFEMALE:You came up with some good things.
LEADMALE:What I think we should do is talk about them together.
LEADFEMALE:You you still want me to work on the project? Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk about it in the morning.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you for the second chance.
LEADFEMALE:I-I was ready to come over tomorrow and clean out my desk.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, great! I think I owe everyone an apology.
LEADMALE:I think that's a very noble gesture.
SUPMALE:What did you do? Ever since I started working, I was taking all my irritability and nervousness out on you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I was trying to be the perfect working woman, the perfect mother, the perfect wife, and, uh, that's crazy, 'cause I'm not perfect.
OTHERMALE:Ah, mom, perfection's overrated.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I've been there.
SUPMALE:It hasn't been all your fault, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:If you're going to work, we've got to make some adjustments, too.
LEADFEMALE:As a future working woman, I'm with you 100%.
LEADMALE:That goes double for me.
SUPMALE:Not the bit about working.
LEADMALE:I think what we're trying to say, mom, is we're willing to help out more.

LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom went nuts.
OTHERMALE:Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I-I didn't expect you'd all be up.

LEADMALE:It's okay, honey.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Mom what you did was terrible.
LEADFEMALE:We're rich! We're rich! It was so scary, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing I lived for was my next blackjack hand.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just call it temporary insanity.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm glad it's all over.
LEADMALE:Mom, you look awful.
LEADMALE:Let's get some room service up here, And then we'll all feel a lot better.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Jen.
LEADMALE:Do you want to call or should I? No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No room service.
SUPMALE:Why not, Mom? We're rich.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah No, see, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:We are not rich.
LEADMALE:We are not even well-to-do.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, We are not high rollers like you are.
OTHERFEMALE:To us, 2000 bucks is rich.
LEADMALE:No, but you see, this money isn't ours anymore.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? Well, after I left the blackjack table, I- I put the money in the hotel safe and I went for a stroll on the boardwalk.
SUPFEMALE:And about a mile away I found a Midnight Mission, and I went in, and I pledged $2000 to them.
LEADFEMALE:All of this? No.
LEADFEMALE:This is 1800.
OTHERFEMALE:We owe the other 200.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see if I hear you correctly, Elyse.
LEADMALE:You won $1800 playing blackjack, and we are in debt for $200 to the Midnight Mission.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:We're poor.
OTHERMALE:We're poor.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, Let's not panic here.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think any pledge made at 3:30 in the morning is legally binding in the state of New Jersey.
LEADMALE:It is binding, Alex, because I pledged it.
LEADMALE:They don't know you here, Mom.
SUPMALE:We can put a fake mustache on ya and sneak you across the state line.
LEADMALE:You make a father proud, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see? I- I had to do this.
SUPFEMALE:I- I had to do something to get rid of that terrible feeling that I had.
LEADMALE:If If I kept this money, I'd have never felt good about myself again.
SUPFEMALE:This is tainted money! There is no such thing as tainted money, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, that's enough.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you all understand.
SUPFEMALE:We do, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:If you felt that strongly about it, then giving away that money was absolutely the right You gave it all away? You did the right thing.
LEADMALE:You did the right thing.
OTHERMALE:Right, kids? We're with you, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Is the mission still open? 'Cause I could go over there and talk to the guy.
LEADFEMALE:You did the right thing, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I love you all so much.
SUPMALE:I'm still hungry.
LEADMALE:Do you still have those coupons, Dad? 
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Okay, Dad, I'm ready.
LEADMALE:I got the ground cloth, tent, and canteen.
LEADFEMALE:I've got the tackle box, the lantern, the stove.
OTHERFEMALE:The stove? I thought we were really gonna rough it, live off the land, cook on an open fire.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if it were up to me, Jennifer, we would, but let's face it, I don't think your brother or your sister share our enthusiasm for the great outdoors.
SUPFEMALE:All right, let's get this over with.
LEADMALE:We're going to be camping, Alex, not gathering honey.
LEADMALE:Why limit ourselves, Dad? Can one of you fit this in your backpack for me? I don't have any more room in here.
LEADMALE:What are you going to do with the hair dryer, Mallory? We're going to be out in the middle of nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you gonna plug it in? Aren't we bringing any outlets? Uh, why don't you kids start getting the car packed? Hey, why don't you bring every article of clothing you own? You know, we can move out of the tent.
SUPMALE:You can use it as a closet.
SUPMALE:You'd do that for me? You're sure to don't want to come with us? Oh, honey, I can't.
LEADMALE:I got to get this project finished by Monday.
SUPFEMALE:I've been so tired lately, I wouldn't be much fun anyway.
SUPMALE:I don't know what's wrong.
SUPMALE:I just haven't had my normal energy for weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe the kids and I should stay home this weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:I I'm fine.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys have been looking forward to this for a long time.
LEADMALE:Well, I would hate to break Alex's heart.
LEADMALE:He does so love the woods.
LEADFEMALE:You go have a good time.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:I saw Dr.
SUPMALE:Carlson yesterday, and she gave me every test there is.
SUPFEMALE:She said I'm a perfectly healthy human specimen at the peak of my womanhood.
SUPMALE:My sentiments precisely.
OTHERMALE:I feel like a piece of day-old liver.
LEADMALE:Don't go getting me all excited, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got to take the kids camping.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Dad, let's go.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not getting any younger.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm ready.
LEADMALE:We'll grab some breakfast on the road.
SUPMALE:You sure you can't come with us, Mom? Oh, I've got too much work to do.
SUPFEMALE:All right, well, it's not going to be the same without you.
LEADMALE:Who's gonna chop the firewood? I will, as usual.
SUPFEMALE:I just want everyone to see that in the spirit of getting back to nature, I've decided to go with a clear nail polish.
SUPMALE:Hello, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:I hope I'm not too late.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? Mallory invited me to lunch today.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mallory's not here.
LEADFEMALE:She's gone camping.
LEADMALE:Camping? I see.
LEADMALE:This is this Saturday, isn't it? Well, Mallory's been planning on going camping for weeks.
LEADMALE:That explains why she invited me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's all right.
LEADMALE:I don't need lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, I didn't have any breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:You know, breakfast, the most important meal of the day, which, of course, lunch becomes if you haven't eaten any breakfast, which I haven't.
OTHERMALE:How does peanut butter and jelly sound? Well, my mother always says I should have a hot lunch.
SUPMALE:I'll heat it for you.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:It's really lonely at my house.
OTHERMALE:My parents went to Dayton for a symposium on 
SUPMALE:"Making the most of your twilight years.
LEADMALE:" I can see why you choose not to join them.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I think I got all I could out of the first two in the series.
LEADFEMALE:Make yourself at home, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, actually, I'm kind of glad you dropped by.
LEADMALE:It was getting a little lonely here for me with everybody gone.
LEADMALE:Well, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Keaton, don't you worry, I'll make you an excellent companion.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you care for a game of jacks? No.
LEADMALE:Or perhaps some yo-yo tricks? Hello? Oh, hi, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Carlson.
LEADMALE:How are you? Oh, you do.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, yeah, go ahead.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:What? No.
LEADMALE:No, I-I don't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:No! Doctor, wait a minute, you I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:Y- y-you said it was virtually impossible We did.
LEADMALE:I am.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Okay, okay.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:What is it, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Keaton? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Why do you ask? No reason.
LEADMALE:Steve.
LEADFEMALE:Steven.
LEADMALE:I've got to call Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:He's in a tent.
LEADFEMALE:He's in the woods.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't take a phone in the tent.
LEADMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:This is incredible.
SUPFEMALE:There must be some mistake.
SUPMALE:She's a doctor.
LEADMALE:She knows what she's talking about.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Keaton, are you sick? No.
LEADMALE:I feel fine.
LEADFEMALE:That's great.
SUPFEMALE:Skippy, you're not gonna believe this.
LEADFEMALE:What? We're going to have a baby.
OTHERFEMALE:We are? Gitchee, gitchee, gitchee, gitchee, gitchee.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down for a second.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you something.
LEADMALE:Uh, do you remember that weekend we spent at that bed and breakfast place and skipped breakfast? No.
SUPMALE:Steven, how many people do you think are in this room? No.
OTHERMALE:Steven, Steven, do you remember how you always said that we have the three most wonderful, thoughtful, considerate children in the whole world? Those are the three most selfish, spoiled, inconsiderate children in the world.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? How come you're home a day early? Elyse, this is not my idea of a relaxing drive up into the 
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, it's an honest mistake.
LEADFEMALE:It could have happened to anybody.
LEADMALE:Not anybody who walks erect.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened? Well, thanks to Mallory, we went camping without a tent.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:I saw your dad put the tent in the trunk himself.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Mom, what you didn't see was Mallory taking the tent out of the trunk to make room for her makeup table.
OTHERMALE:I didn't think it was anything important.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it was just Alex's sleeping bag.
LEADMALE:Where was I supposed to sleep, Mallory, in a tree? Where's Jennifer? Well, I told her to take our gear down off the luggage rack.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, leave the gear! Just come inside! Why did you tell her to do that? Dad, I knew she was disappointed about the camping trip, so I thought this was a good way for her to get some fresh air.
LEADFEMALE:Look at those rosy cheeks.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't get the sleeping bag untied.
SUPFEMALE:They were up too high.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, the ladder is in the garage, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:Alex, you think you're the boss over me.
LEADMALE:He thinks he's the boss over everybody, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Now what's the matter? Hold it! Hold it! Up to your rooms, now.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Dad, I think I'm a little old to be sent to my room.
LEADFEMALE:You're also too old to be whining in the car the whole way back.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't whining.
SUPFEMALE:Get up there.
LEADMALE:Honey.
LEADMALE:Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember how these camping trips used to be? Just the two of us up there in the woods, with the stars, the moon, a little fire going.
LEADMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:I miss those days.
SUPMALE:I mean, I love the kids, Elyse, you know that, but I'll tell you, part of me is really looking forward to the day when the kids are grown and it'll be just the two of us again.
SUPFEMALE:Are you really? I am tired, I am cranky, I am fed up.
LEADMALE:Just do not mention the word "kid" to me, we'll be okay.
LEADFEMALE:God.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'll try.
LEADMALE:Did you? Did you get the test results from your physical? You're not making it easy on me.
SUPMALE:What did Dr.
OTHERMALE:Carlson have to say? Well, my blood pressure's a little low.
SUPMALE:Nothing to worry about.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, triglycerides, never better.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the perfect height for someone my age.
SUPMALE:Oh, I almost forgot, I'm pregnant.
LEADMALE:Well, anything else happen while I was gone? Your suit came back from the cleaners.
SUPFEMALE:This is a big day.
SUPMALE:Um, who else knows about this? Only you and Skippy.
SUPMALE:Oh, of course.
LEADMALE:I- I thought you'd be happy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm happy.
OTHERMALE:I'm happy.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't I look happy? You look shocked.
SUPMALE:Uh, I am.
SUPMALE:I'm shocked and happy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm shappy.
LEADMALE:You're babbling.
SUPMALE:I am.
SUPMALE:I'm babbling and I'm shocked and I'm happy.
OTHERMALE:I'm bashappy.
LEADFEMALE:We always said we'd welcome a new baby.
LEADMALE:Well, I-I-I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I- I just didn't think we'd get the chance to.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, after Jennifer was born, the doctor said, uh, that was it.
LEADMALE:I mean, the chances The chances of your getting pregnant again were very slim.
SUPMALE:But you do welcome this baby, don't you? I do.
SUPFEMALE:I do.
SUPMALE:Of course I do.
SUPFEMALE:It's just I'm, uh Bashappy.
SUPFEMALE:It's just beginning to dawn on me.
SUPFEMALE:A baby.
SUPFEMALE:This is incredible.
SUPMALE:This is This is fantastic.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Dad, listen, the three of us were talking about all that car stuff, and, well, we're sorry, you know? Did you hear that, Elyse? You're the three most wonderful children in the world.
LEADMALE:Told you I didn't have to cry, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Kids, come on over here.
OTHERFEMALE:We got to tell you something real important.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, kids.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:Is something wrong, Mom? Oh, no, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's fine.
SUPMALE:It's just that, uh, Well, I'm pregnant.
LEADMALE:Pregnant? You mean You mean, like, with a baby? I know, it's a shock.
SUPFEMALE:Believe me, no one was more surprised than I was.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Skippy was.
LEADMALE:Skippy knows? You mean, people outside the house are gonna know about this? I'll have to drop out of school.
LEADMALE:All right, uh, let me get this straight.
SUPMALE:You and Mom are gonna have a baby? Heh.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:And you're pregnant? You picked the right one.
SUPMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:Uh.
OTHERMALE:Girls, Mom's pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Please leave the room.
SUPFEMALE:This is not a topic for females.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:Are you sure, Mom? Well, that's what the doctor said.
SUPFEMALE:Well, aren't you kids excited? Well, it's embarrassing.
LEADMALE:You're parents.
SUPMALE:You shouldn't be having children.
LEADMALE:Come on, you guys, Mallory is right.
SUPFEMALE:You're too old.
LEADFEMALE:You're too kind.
LEADMALE:I'm just being realistic, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to be able to do the things that That younger parents do.
LEADFEMALE:Who is, uh? Who is going to toss a football with this kid? Old Gramps here? Alex, it might not be someone who likes football, it might even be a girl.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody said anything about having a girl.
OTHERMALE:No, sir, that is where I draw the line.
LEADFEMALE:I am definitely against you having a girl.
LEADMALE:This baby is gonna change all our lives.
LEADMALE:Just think they should have asked us how we felt about it.
SUPMALE:You know, we should try and look at this thing from their point of view.
LEADFEMALE:They're not exactly a couple of spring chickens, you know.
LEADMALE:This is, uh This is their last grasp at youth.
LEADMALE:It's their last chance to feel like a functioning part of nature's fertility cycle before they shrivel up, join bowling leagues.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't help thinking another brother or sister's gonna upset the delicate balance of give and take, the balance of space we've established in this family.
LEADFEMALE:That's quite an advanced thought, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:I, uh I didn't know you had such an understanding of group dynamics.
LEADMALE:I was talking about closet space.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what you guys are complaining about.
OTHERMALE:I'm the youngest.
LEADFEMALE:I should feel the most threatened.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Jennifer is right.
LEADFEMALE:Look, this thing is gonna be hardest on her.
SUPMALE:She's used to being the baby of the family, getting all the attention.
LEADMALE:Mwah.
SUPMALE:Now she's going to be ignored.
LEADFEMALE:A virtual nobody.
SUPMALE:One of the crowd.
LEADFEMALE:A piece of driftwood.
SUPFEMALE:Mere flotsam washed up on the shores of life.
SUPFEMALE:I get the point, Alex.
LEADMALE:Okay, girls, you're just gonna have to be mature about this.
OTHERMALE:Now, there is going to be another member of this family, and you're both going to have to make sacrifices.
OTHERFEMALE:What about you? I'm the oldest son.
OTHERFEMALE:There are certain inalienable rights to that position.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't pull rank on this one, Alex.
LEADMALE:When the baby cries at 3:00 in the morning, it's gonna wake everyone up.
SUPMALE:Even the first-born son.
LEADFEMALE:Can you imagine Alex changing a diaper? Or Alex going gitchee, gitchee, goo? I can go "gitchee, gitchee, goo," Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't think infants should be spoken to in that manner.
LEADFEMALE:What would you say to the baby if it were crying, Alex? I would, uh I would walk over to the edge of the crib, and I would explain to the infant that crying is merely an instinctive reaction to transitory, albeit unpleasant, environmental stimuli.
SUPMALE:Why does that sound so familiar? To which I would add, parenthetically, uh, "gitchee, uh, gitchee, goo.
SUPMALE:" I just had a scary thought.
LEADFEMALE:We could have another little Alex on our hands.
SUPMALE:You're making me very nervous, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you should be nervous.
SUPFEMALE:Think about all the negatives to the situation.
LEADMALE:Babies cry at night when you're trying to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:They have bad table manners.
LEADFEMALE:They're bald.
LEADFEMALE:They never pick up after themselves.
LEADFEMALE:They have runny noses.
SUPFEMALE:When you stand them up, they fall right over.
SUPMALE:They can't hold their liquor.
LEADMALE:Then again, they cuddle up in your arms.
SUPFEMALE:They smell good.
LEADFEMALE:They gurgle and coo.
SUPFEMALE:They idolize their older brother.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, who could blame them? You know, I can't recall which of you girls looked up to me more when you were babies.
SUPMALE:Or should I say worshipped? Ow! Are you okay? Hm? Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I just couldn't sleep.
SUPMALE:I was so excited.
LEADMALE:How you two feeling? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, how are you? I had a little trouble sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh I can't stop thinking.
SUPMALE:About what? I mean, about what specifically? Elyse, I'm 40 years old.
SUPMALE:I'm about to become a father again.
LEADMALE:Last time I changed a diaper, Richard Nixon was president.
OTHERMALE:Thought I'd seen the last of both of them.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what I keep realizing? What? We have to start watching Sesame Streetagain.
SUPMALE:Romper Room.
LEADMALE:Mister Rogers'.
LEADFEMALE:I likeMister Rogers'.
LEADMALE:Have to start going to the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:Pony rides.
LEADMALE:Birthday parties.
SUPFEMALE:Sterilizing baby bottles.
LEADMALE:Tripping over toys.
LEADMALE:Before you know it, the terrible twos will be upon us.
LEADMALE:Remember when Alex used to run around the house all the time going, "Mine! Mine!"? He never really outgrew that, did he? Seems like such a long time ago.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I've been doing some calculations.
LEADFEMALE:When the baby's 10, I'll be 50.
LEADFEMALE:When the baby's 20, I'll be 60.
LEADMALE:When the baby's 30, I'll be 70.
SUPMALE:a baby, isn't it? It won't be a baby when it's 30.
LEADMALE:I guess you're right.
SUPMALE:When the baby's 40, Jennifer will be 51.
LEADMALE:Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Cut it out.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm just not used to the idea.
SUPFEMALE:Neither am I.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a nice idea to get used to, isn't it? I wish the kids were more excited.
LEADMALE:Oh, they'll come around.
LEADMALE:Who could not love a beautiful newborn baby? Besides, it gives us someone else to pick on.
LEADMALE:You know, uh, there's one other thing about this we haven't mentioned.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be real expensive.
LEADFEMALE:I find this absolutely the sexiest thing in the world.
LEADMALE:Aw, hey, hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Cut it out.
OTHERMALE:Don't you know that's how you got into trouble in the first place? Alex, what are you doing up? How am I supposed to sleep, Mom? I'm about to become a brother for the third time.
SUPMALE:It's not gonna happen tonight, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's not, is it, Elyse? I can almost guarantee it.
LEADFEMALE:What's in the package? Oh, uh, it's something I picked up for the little guy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's so cute.
LEADMALE:Yeah, uh, pull the string.
SUPFEMALE:I love Alex.
LEADMALE:Aw.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that sweet? Oh, my Yeah, you know, I think I need to get one of these for myself.
OTHERMALE:This is going to be a long nine months.
LEADMALE:We thought about having a little brother or sister, and we decided that it could be a lot of fun.
LEADMALE:Yeah, the family needs a little shaking up anyway.
LEADMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADMALE:This is beautiful.
OTHERMALE:Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's getting pretty late.
LEADFEMALE:I think we'd better call it a night, huh? Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:You mind? I can't find any of my new school supplies, Alex.
LEADMALE:Did you take my scissors? Your scissors? Jennifer, as of today I am a freshman in college.
LEADMALE:In college, we deal in the realm of ideas, of theories.
SUPMALE:Of Of Of abstract concepts.
LEADMALE:We work not with our hands but with our minds.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, I can assure 
SUPFEMALE:I have absolutely no use for your scissors.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, then give me back my paste.
LEADMALE:I need that.
SUPMALE:Mallory, please! I've got to be at work in a half an hour.
SUPMALE:It's enough.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mom.
LEADMALE:This is very important.
LEADMALE:It's my first day of school.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna get it off to a good start.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in my junior year now.
LEADMALE:A lot more is expected of me.
SUPFEMALE:The one I have on now, okay? Or one of the first six I tried on? Do not change clothes.
LEADFEMALE:The outfit you have on right now is clearly the best one.
LEADMALE:Are you sure, Mom? I promise you.
LEADMALE:Morning, kids.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Say, Mallory, what happened to that red outfit you had on before? That looked great.
SUPFEMALE:Mom! Steven, what a terrible thing to say! I Tell Mallory you didn't mean it.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mallory, I didn't mean it.
OTHERFEMALE:I must have lost my head.
LEADMALE:Isn't that sweet? All three of our children getting ready for another first day at school.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mom, I wish you would respect the fact that I am in college now.
SUPMALE:I mean, I-I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't lump me together with these two bambinos.
LEADMALE:You think you're so hot just because you're in college.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:I am not just "in college.
LEADFEMALE:" I am at Leland University.
SUPMALE:One of the finest institutions of higher learning in this country.
LEADMALE:And I'm not just "at Leland," either.
LEADMALE:I am the winner of the McKinley Scholarship at Leland.
SUPMALE:And I'm not just Alex, will you? Whoa, whoa.
LEADMALE:That's Doug.
LEADFEMALE:That's my ride.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm off to college.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, good luck, son.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:I'm so proud of you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Mom.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, you take care of yourselves while I'm gone.
LEADMALE:We'll, uh, try to manage without you till supper.
SUPMALE:You know, while it's true that Leland is only a mere 30 miles away, as I leave here today I feel as though I'm pulling up anchor.
LEADMALE:You know, casting off.
LEADFEMALE:Setting sail into a vast sea of knowledge and wisdom.
LEADFEMALE:One man.
LEADFEMALE:The captain of his own ship.
OTHERMALE:Don't forget your lunch.
LEADMALE:Extra cookies? Aye-aye, captain.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome to Leland College.
OTHERFEMALE:I am Efrem Bronski.
LEADFEMALE:This is a freshman seminar in American government.
SUPMALE:If you are not enrolled in this course, and here by mistake, well, then, I suggest you leave now before you become too engrossed.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to begin our studies with an examination of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.
LEADMALE:It reads, and I 
LEADMALE:"Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.
LEADFEMALE:" No law.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear that, Doug? No law.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't look at me.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna make one.
SUPFEMALE:The wording is quite unambiguous.
SUPFEMALE:And yet Congress has passed many laws over the years which restrict the individual's right to express himself.
LEADMALE:Is there an inconsistency here? Yes? Uh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It would, uh It would appear that there is an inconsistency here, sir.
SUPMALE:What is your name, young man? Uh, Alex P.
LEADMALE:Keaton, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, I was merely posing a rhetorical question.
LEADMALE:I did not expect a response.
LEADMALE:Nor did I want one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm Uh, I didn't mean to respond.
SUPMALE:I w I was just up.
SUPFEMALE:And as long as I'm up, can I get you something? Uh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm fine, But let's pursue this.
SUPMALE:You said you felt there was an inconsistency between what's written in the Constitution and the fact that Congress has passed laws limiting free speech.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, why do you feel that way? Is this a rhetorical question? No, this is a regular question.
SUPMALE:Well, uh, if If If the constitution states that That freedom of speech is an absolute right, then, uh Then congress shouldn't be allowed to To restrict it at all.
LEADFEMALE:It's as simple as that.
SUPFEMALE:You would, uh, legalize libel, slander? Well, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, certainly not.
SUPFEMALE:But you just said that you felt that free speech was an absolute right.
OTHERMALE:Is it or isn't it? Uh, well, y Uh, yeah, it is.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, except for those things.
LEADMALE:What about incitement to riot? Uh, that too.
LEADFEMALE:What about censorship of newspapers, book banning, treason? Uh, those are good.
OTHERFEMALE:So there is no free speech, is there, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Keaton? No, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Not as far as I can tell.
LEADMALE:Do you feel you've wasted enough of the class's time yet? Yep, I think so.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope you were all paying, uh, close attention to the comments of Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton because they represent exactly the kind of narrow-minded, unsophisticated and simplistic approach to American government that, with any luck, this class will help you to overcome.
LEADFEMALE:Nice work.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mom? Mom? Oh.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
SUPMALE:Knitting a sweater for the baby.
LEADMALE:I know it's a little clichÃ©, but not as much as knitting booties.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'm I'm sorry, honey.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
OTHERFEMALE:Get your work done.
LEADMALE:No, I'm sorry, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't mean to cut you off like that.
OTHERMALE:It's just that, uh, I really got a lot of work to do, you know? Your first day? Yeah, well I'm a little overanxious.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, I really got off on the wrong foot with Professor Bronski today.
LEADFEMALE:I ju I spoke too quickly, you know? Without thinking.
SUPFEMALE:I came on too strong.
LEADMALE:I seemed too pushy.
LEADMALE:You? Anyway, that's why I wanna do a great job on this paper he assigned.
LEADMALE:You know, really show him what I can do.
LEADFEMALE:No, after this he'll know that I am not the babbling idiot he saw in his class today.
LEADFEMALE:I think, uh, he's gonna wanna take me under his wing.
LEADMALE:You know, become my mentor.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe ask me to collaborate on a book with him.
SUPMALE:Maybe ask me to the prom.
LEADMALE:Alex, get back to work.
LEADMALE:Right, right, right.
SUPFEMALE:Can I help you? No, I'm just bored.
SUPMALE:What are you working on? A paper.
SUPFEMALE:You happy? What's it about? Eugene V.
SUPFEMALE:Debs.
LEADFEMALE:You happy now? Who's Eugene V.
SUPMALE:Debs? Well, Jennifer, if you must know, Eugene V.
LEADFEMALE:Debs was a socialist who was arrested in 1917 for making a speech opposing American involvement in World War I.
LEADFEMALE:See, he claimed he was just exercising his right to free speech.
SUPMALE:But the Supreme Court, in a decision by Oliver Wendell Holmes, disagreed.
SUPFEMALE:They said that his speech was a clear and present danger to the country.
LEADMALE:Are you happy now? Now I'm happy.
SUPMALE:I was generally pleased with the quality of these first essays.
LEADMALE:Most of them were quite satisfactory.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't give As very often but, uh But there was one very exceptional paper in the bunch.
SUPMALE:To that individual, I say, "A job well done.
LEADMALE:" Class dismissed.
LEADFEMALE:Excellent paper, young man.
LEADMALE:A splendid piece of work.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you sir.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:It was an honor to write it for you.
LEADFEMALE:I found the experience both educational and rewarding.
LEADMALE:I was talking to him.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, thank you, sir.
SUPMALE:It was an honor to write it for you.
LEADMALE:I found the experience both educational and rewarding.
SUPMALE:I got an A, Alex.
SUPMALE:What? W- What did you get, a A B? A C? A D? Well, there's only one grade I haven't mentioned yet.
LEADMALE:That's the one.
LEADMALE:Mallory, I am surprised at you.
LEADFEMALE:After that big talk we had about how hard you were gonna work in school, you got two C minuses on your first three tests.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I've just had a lot of things on my mind lately.
OTHERMALE:I mean, what, with the baby coming and everything.
LEADMALE:How long do you plan on using that as an excuse? Just till it's through its teething stage.
OTHERMALE:After the dishes, I want you both to go upstairs and get busy on your homework.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have any homework, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:We had a substitute today and we convinced her that Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Dovler doesn't give homework on Thursdays.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not real happy with either of your attitudes here.
OTHERMALE:Now, I'm I'm not trying to compare you to Alex, but I think you can both learn a lesson from him in attitude toward school.
SUPMALE:I have an announcement to 
LEADFEMALE:I'm dropping out of school.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? What do you mean, you're dropping out of school? Dad, today was the worst day of my life.
LEADMALE:Mom, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Alex seems pretty upset, so maybe Jen and I should leave so you can talk to him.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:That's very thoughtful.
SUPMALE:But it's our turn to wash the dishes.
SUPMALE:Shh! Right.
LEADMALE:What happened? Well, uh, Professor Bronski handed back our papers today.
LEADMALE:And, uh, I got an An An F.
LEADFEMALE:An F? An F? How is that possible? I mean, you worked so hard on this paper.
LEADMALE:"While abundant " "In data and facts, this essay is long-winded and totally lacking in any meaningful insight.
LEADFEMALE:" I was a star in high school, but I just don't have what it takes to make it in college.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a failure.
LEADFEMALE:I'm I'm like Orlando Del Rio.
OTHERFEMALE:You are nothing like Orlando Del Rio.
SUPMALE:Uh, who's, uh, Orlando Del Rio? Come on, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Orlando Del Rio.
LEADFEMALE:He led the minor leagues in hitting for three years.
LEADFEMALE:Then when he joins the Cincinnati Reds, he goes 0 for 167.
LEADMALE:I think he runs a shoe store in Dayton.
LEADMALE:Maybe I could call him for a job.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you got one F.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you said so yourself.
LEADFEMALE:You're not in high school anymore, you're in college.
LEADFEMALE:And it's a very difficult college.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Mom, Just forget it, okay? Forget it.
SUPMALE:It's over.
LEADMALE:It is not over.
SUPFEMALE:You're still learning what's expected of you.
SUPMALE:You're bound to do better next time.
LEADMALE:Take Willie Mays.
SUPMALE:He He started out badly in the majors, and look what happened to him.
SUPFEMALE:What does this have to do with baseball, Dad? Honey, you suffered a setback.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I know how badly you feel.
LEADFEMALE:But try and keep it in perspective.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, Mom.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna keep it in perspective.
LEADMALE:I'm, uh I'm not gonna drop out of college.
LEADMALE:But I am gonna drop that course.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Efrem Bronski is a genius and he deserves better than to have his class cluttered up by By a dolt like me.
LEADMALE:Alex, this one grade has really changed you.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to that That grandiose, self-important, pompous kid we knew and loved? That happy-go-lucky guy is gone, Dad.
SUPMALE:Uh, uh, I'm studying! But, uh, you can come on in.
OTHERFEMALE:I t I thought it was Mom or Dad.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:It's just me.
OTHERMALE:You can go back to doing whatever you were doing.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, it's just as well.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I should be studying.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing here? What do you mean, what am I doing here? Mallory, I'm, uh I'm your brother.
LEADMALE:You're my sister.
OTHERMALE:I just came up to see how you're doing.
LEADMALE:Well, I spent all my allowance money and you're not pawning any of my jewelry.
LEADMALE:No, really, I just came up here to, uh To visit you.
LEADFEMALE:What, uh What do you got there? Uh, chemistry.
LEADFEMALE:Chemistry.
LEADFEMALE:I remember chemistry.
LEADFEMALE:Got an A in it.
LEADMALE:I remember As.
OTHERMALE:You don't look so good, Alex.
LEADMALE:I don't feel so good, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:You know, I got my, uh, first college paper back today.
SUPMALE:The, uh The professor said it was long-winded and totally lacking in any meaningful insight.
LEADMALE:He, uh, gave me an, uh An An An F.
SUPFEMALE:Really? An F? That's right.
LEADMALE:An F! That's great, Alex! Mallory, take it easy, will you? This is supposed to be bad news, not good news.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it is bad news, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I'm I'm really sorry about it.
SUPMALE:Do you mind if I make a few phone calls? You know, uh, I've never gotten an F.
LEADFEMALE:F before.
OTHERMALE:You know, for that matter, I've never even gotten a C or Or a D.
LEADMALE:I got a B once in health.
SUPMALE:Because I, uh, boycotted the sex-education films.
OTHERFEMALE:You missed some great stuff.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mallory, my days as an academic star are, uh Are over.
SUPFEMALE:From now on at school, I'm just gonna be one of the pack.
LEADMALE:A nobody.
LEADMALE:Just another slug fighting to keep my head above water.
LEADFEMALE:How do you handle it? Thanks a lot, Alex.
SUPMALE:No, no, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Come on, I I didn't mean it like that.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just Well, you've got You've got to admit, you have a little more experience in this area than I do.
LEADMALE:I gotta know, h- how does it feel to? To not do well in school? Well, it's kind of hard to describe.
LEADMALE:Well, for instance, when, uh When you're taking a test, do you, uh? Do you just not know the answer, or? Or is it that you knew the answer once and just have difficulty in retrieving it? Or do you just not understand the questions? No, see, when I'm taking the test, I really do try to understand the question.
LEADMALE:But then I get this strange feeling.
LEADFEMALE:What, like a headache? No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Not a headache exactly.
SUPFEMALE:Everything just goes kind of gray, you know? And then my mind starts wandering.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh, what do you think about? Boys.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's hope it's different for me.
LEADMALE:Hey, you're really gonna drop the course, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You want me to wait in the car? No, uh, go home, Doug.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Uh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bronski? Yes, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Uh, I just wanted to say how much I've enjoyed your course.
LEADMALE:Uh, but I'm dropping it.
SUPMALE:Scheduling conflict? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, I, uh I just don't think I'm capable of handling it.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I got an F on my paper and all.
OTHERFEMALE:I just think that I should stick to subjects where I'm on surer ground, you know? Where I know what I'm I'm doing.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, it It, uh It has been an honor to meet you, sir.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir? I'm just curious, um, do you think he should have gone to prison? Who? Eugene Debs, for making that anti-war speech in 1917.
OTHERMALE:Uh, well, Oliver Wendell Holmes thought so.
LEADMALE:He said that, uh, Debs' speech posed a clear and present danger to the country.
SUPMALE:Um, goodbye.
OTHERFEMALE:But do you think so? Me? Yes, you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh, it's just my opinion.
LEADFEMALE:But from what I read, it didn't seem that one anti-war speech could have hurt the country.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:This is not an easy room to leave.
SUPMALE:What if word of that speech had spread and, uh, draftees by the millions, swayed by Debs' words had decided to resist the draft? What if Debs had aroused the entire nation against the war? Yeah, but that didn't happen.
LEADMALE:I'm asking you to suppose it had.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Uh, suppose it had.
LEADMALE:If the majority of the people hold a certain opinion, then Then the government has an obligation to listen to them, right? Am I to believe that you feel Debs had a right to make that anti-war speech? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I do.
LEADMALE:I mean, the guy was not blowing up factories.
LEADFEMALE:He He made a speech.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he He was presenting ideas.
LEADMALE:Ideas incite people.
LEADFEMALE:Of course ideas incite people.
LEADMALE:Ideas are supposed to incite people.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that the whole reason we have the First Amendment? So that people can be exposed to different ideas and then act on the ones they agree with? In other words, you feel that Debs' case was decided wrongly.
OTHERMALE:You disagree with Oliver Wendell Holmes, one of the most brilliant legal minds in history.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Yes, you do! You just said so! You disagree with him! All right! I disagree with him.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want from me? What I want from you, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, is for you to put some of that kind of analysis, some of that kind of meaningful insight into your essays.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to stand up for what you believe to be true, even if it conflicts with Oliver Wendell Holmes or with the Framers of the Constitution, or even with me.
LEADMALE:You have every right to drop this class, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton, stick to those subjects where you're more comfortable and on surer ground.
SUPFEMALE:Although, I must say, that's a rather dull way for such an intelligent young man to live his life.
SUPMALE:He called me an intelligent young man.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, he also called me dull.
LEADFEMALE:But he did call me intelligent.
LEADFEMALE:Efrem Bronski called me an intelligent young man.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, uh, professor.
SUPFEMALE:Professor Bronski.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, it's, uh It's It's me, uh, Alex Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:The intelligent young man.
LEADMALE:Listen, professor Uh, prof Professor, could you stop for a minute, please? Uh Uh, profes Listen, I- I-I never got an F before and And And it kind of threw me.
SUPMALE:But I am not a quitter and And I think I understand now what you want from me.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Uh, ma'am? Uh, ma'am, could you go around the corner there and And tell that guy that I am staying in his class? No, no.
SUPMALE:Not him.
OTHERFEMALE:Not him, the other guy.
OTHERFEMALE:The other guy.
SUPMALE:Forget it.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I think he heard me.
LEADFEMALE:I love college.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:What do you got there, Dad? Well, I've got a teddy bear, two rattles, a cuddle bunny, and a little ducky.
LEADMALE:Well, you can play for five minutes, and then you got to go night-night.
SUPMALE:Alex, we're just trying to get an inventory of the baby toys we have so, uh, we'll know what we need to buy.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, what's that, Dad? This is the mobile that used to hang over your crib.
LEADMALE:I remember we experimented with a lot of different things until we found the one symbol that would calm you down.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, t-turn it on, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Turn it on.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:MAN Continental Telegraph up three points.
LEADMALE:It's up to 25 cents.
SUPFEMALE:Cintram Corporation, down 14.
LEADFEMALE:Still works.
LEADMALE:Oh, and when you've finished your nap, uh, take a look through that catalog there.
LEADFEMALE:We're trying to pick out a new crib.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Dad.
LEADMALE:What do I know about cribs? A crib is a crib.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with this one here, The Inky-Binky-Beddy-Bye? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:That one, uh, scares me a little.
SUPFEMALE:The Inky-Bink looks like a bear to put together.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:More food for Mom? I know.
LEADMALE:It's getting ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:This is the fourth meal Mom's eaten in two hours.
SUPFEMALE:Try to be a little more understanding, Mal.
SUPMALE:She's an energetic person.
LEADFEMALE:Now that the doctor wants her to stay off her feet, she's channeling all her energies, uh, into eating.
SUPFEMALE:Is Scott here yet? No, Jen.
SUPMALE:We told you we'd call you when he gets here.
LEADMALE:Uh, coming! That's Mom again.
LEADMALE:She's getting a little demanding now.
SUPFEMALE:You better hurry up and take that to her.
LEADMALE:You don't want to miss Scott when he gets here.
SUPFEMALE:What's the big deal? He was your goofy friend, not mine.
SUPFEMALE:He wasn't goofy, Mallory.
LEADMALE:He just had glasses and braces and big ears.
LEADMALE:Well, then, I'll hurry back down.
SUPMALE:What's all this? This is equipment from all the different sports Scott and I used to play together.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd let him pick which one he wants to start with.
LEADFEMALE:Scott is in town for a college interview, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I don't think he'll have time for the decathlon.
LEADMALE:I know he'll want to play, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Before he moved away the two of us were the first two kids outside every morning and the last two kids in every night.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but that was five years ago, Jen.
OTHERFEMALE:Scott is 17 years old now, you know.
SUPMALE:People slow down as they get older.
LEADMALE:Their bones start to deteriorate with each passing year.
SUPFEMALE:Look at Dad.
LEADMALE:Thanks, coach.
SUPFEMALE:He's here.
SUPFEMALE:Scott, it's good to see you! Jennifer! How are you? Great.
LEADFEMALE:Look at you.

SUPMALE:What'll it be, Scott? Baseball, soccer, tennis.
LEADMALE:Greco-Roman wrestling? What do you mean? I thought we'd play some sports just like we did when we were kids.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sure.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like fun.
SUPMALE:You two have a good time.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Scott? Hi, Mallory.
SUPMALE:Boy, have you changed.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you changed too.
LEADMALE:I mean, you grew into your ears, and You look good too.
LEADMALE:Scott, what are you waiting for? Uh, Let's hold off on the soccer for a while, okay, Jennifer? Good idea.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, do you want to go down to your old house? Or maybe we could just sit on the lawn and talk about old times.
LEADMALE:Uh, yeah, sure.
SUPMALE:Go ahead and start without me and I'll be right there.
OTHERMALE:Okay.

LEADMALE:He didn't have a chance to look at them yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:There she is.
LEADMALE:You want me to take this up to Mom, Dad? Oh, no, no, I'll do it.
LEADMALE:She denies it, but I think she kind of enjoys, being waited on by her husband.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, they all do, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:You know, they may say things have changed, but basically, they're happiest when they're barefoot and pregnant.
OTHERMALE:Oh, coming, Elyse! Sounds serious.
SUPMALE:This won't be enough.
SUPFEMALE:Girls, give me a hand.
SUPMALE:Uh, Mallory, get the peanut butter.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Jennifer, the garlic bread and the antipasto.

SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:She's upstairs or something.
LEADFEMALE:So hey, Scott.
SUPMALE:Are you up for your interview tomorrow? Uh, yeah.
SUPMALE:I'm pretty excited.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Let me give you a couple of tips, okay? I am, uh Well, hey, I'm kind of a legend at that college, and so I think you should slip my name into the conversation as much as you can.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, why don't you, uh, take this with you? This is a picture of you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:You know, you can keep that.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, uh, Mallory must be about, what, 17 years old now, huh? I don't know.

OTHERFEMALE:She's in her teens.
LEADMALE:I know that.

LEADFEMALE:Another thing.

SUPMALE:Hi, Jennifer, Mallory, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:I was giving Scott a couple of tips for his interview.
LEADMALE:Ooh, let me give you the opposite advice I gave Alex before his 
LEADMALE:Just be yourself.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Dinner, she's served.
LEADMALE:Ah.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:I can't tell you how hungry I am.
OTHERFEMALE:I love a man with a healthy appetite.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Well, I-I guess she's still hungry.
LEADMALE:I'll take her some more the Pasta Alex, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's all this stuff? Just a few pictures of us when we were kids and stuff like that.
OTHERMALE:Are there any pictures of you in here, Mallory? I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:There's Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:That's us when we dressed up for Halloween as Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:In the back.
LEADMALE:Look.
SUPMALE:That's Mallory's foot.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Scott, I was just thinking.
LEADMALE:The Indians are playing a twinight double-header this Saturday.
OTHERMALE:Do you want to go? Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:Anyway, Mallory, we have a lot of catching up to do.
LEADMALE:This picture of your foot really sparks the memories.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I was wondering if you have two tickets left for tonight's Indians game? You have 35,000? Well, I only need two.
LEADMALE:Can you hold them for me, please? My name is Jennifer Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Any sign of Scott yet, Alex? Ah, no, Jen.
LEADMALE:I haven't seen him.
LEADMALE:Tonight's the night we're going to see the Indians play a twinight double-header against the Seattle Mariners.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:The clash of the Titans.
SUPMALE:You want to come? There are 35,000 extra tickets.
OTHERMALE:Uh, no.
SUPMALE:Just, uh, give them to somebody else.
LEADFEMALE:Scott and I are gonna have a great time, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:He loves baseball, remember? You used to come sometimes when we were kids.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Remember that time I got that foul ball? You know, I made that great diving catch, you know, leaning over the railing.
LEADMALE:You didn't make a diving catch.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:It was a one-bouncer.
LEADMALE:It bounced once, I jumped up and I caught it.
LEADFEMALE:No, you didn't.
OTHERMALE:Ah, rolled down the steps to me.
SUPMALE:It rolled down the steps right to me.
SUPMALE:Alex, you bought that ball.
SUPFEMALE:I remember the store was really crowded.
SUPMALE:I had to leap over this lady Alex, give it up.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to go in the garage and see if I can find some old pennants.
LEADFEMALE:Call me when Scott comes.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Coming.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Let me give you a hand with this.
OTHERMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:What have you got in here, a new tie? It's the crib.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, roll up your sleeves, Alex.
SUPMALE:We've got some work to do.
LEADMALE:We? Yeah, it's been a while since you and I built anything together.
LEADMALE:You can assemble some furniture, can't you, Alex? Of course I can.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:It's just that you'd be surprised how many guys can't put together a simple kit.
LEADFEMALE:Well you're, uh You're looking at a guy who can, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see what we got here.
LEADMALE:Okey-doke.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Elyse! Mom! Mom! Honey! Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Scott.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:How did your interview go? Oh, pretty well, I think.
OTHERFEMALE:I tried to mention Alex's name a few times.
OTHERMALE:I hope they don't hold it against you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, have you eaten yet? No.
OTHERFEMALE:How about dinner at Guido's? Sure.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, champ.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened to your baseball game? Rained out.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:It's not raining.
LEADMALE:I have a problem, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, you're 11 years old.
OTHERFEMALE:You got a roof over your head.
OTHERFEMALE:You're fed every day.
SUPFEMALE:You don't pay taxes.
OTHERFEMALE:What kind of problem could you possibly have? The baseball game wasn't rained out.
LEADMALE:Scott took Mallory out to dinner instead.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe he forgot.
SUPMALE:How could you forget about something like that? Scott and I used to be best friends.
OTHERFEMALE:He never used to like Mallory at all.
LEADFEMALE:Now it's the opposite.
SUPMALE:What has Mallory got that I don't? Ah, let's put it this way, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:A 17-year-old guy will tend to have different tastes in girls than an 11-year-old guy.
OTHERFEMALE:It's only natural.
OTHERFEMALE:At this point in his life, Scott is interested in girls who are more soft.
LEADMALE:When did this happen to Scott? Why did he have to change? Well, it's nature, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Through, uh Through none of our her doing, Mallory just happens to have that certain intangible quality that attracts boys.
OTHERMALE:Boys who are helpless victims to the hormones coursing through their veins.
SUPFEMALE:You know, boys like Scott.
LEADFEMALE:Can we put a stop to this? It's too late, Jen.
SUPMALE:It's all over for Scott and his kind.
LEADFEMALE:It's not fair, Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:There's nothing you can do about it, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:My advice to you is that you just enjoy being a child for as long as you can.
OTHERFEMALE:I know I did.
OTHERMALE:It was the best two weeks of my life.
SUPMALE:You know, Mallory, it's really nice being here with you tonight.
LEADMALE:Heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Grazie, grazie.
SUPMALE:That's terrific.
LEADMALE:When did you learn to speak Italian? Grazie, grazie.
LEADMALE:Uh, Scott Handley's table, please.
LEADFEMALE:If you will follow me, signora.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Good evening, Scott.
LEADMALE:I thought I'd join you.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory! How nice to see you! Hi, Jen.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, why are you dressed this way? I'm a woman of many moods, Scott.
OTHERFEMALE:Young and playful one moment, sophisticated and deadly serious the next.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Jennifer, this is a table for two.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you can make room for your sister.
LEADMALE:Well, Scott, what do you recommend? The last time I was here I found the pizza with the bologna very much to my liking.
LEADFEMALE:Shall I go for it again? I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:This a joke or something? I'm deadly serious, Scott.
LEADFEMALE:Pizza with bologna or not? Jen, we already ordered.
LEADMALE:Mallory, Scott needs his strength.
LEADFEMALE:He has Mormons coursing through his veins.
LEADMALE:What? There will be no talking about baseball tonight, Scott.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean? Not really.
SUPMALE:You'll find tonight that I can be as soft as the next girl.
LEADFEMALE:Buy you a drink? Uh, all right, Jen.
SUPMALE:Uh, come here a minute No! You're making a spectacle of yourself.
OTHERMALE:Hey, listen.
SUPFEMALE:I think we ought to take you home now.
SUPMALE:I don't need you to take me home.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer Stop Are you okay, little girl? I'm fine.
SUPMALE:And I'm not a little girl.
LEADMALE:Waiter, my bike.
LEADFEMALE:Jen.
SUPMALE:Well, Alex, what do you think? She a beauty? She is a beauty, Dad, although I'd, uh, feel a little better about her if we'd, uh, used all the parts she came with.
LEADFEMALE:How many are left over? Well, uh, she came with 22 nuts, We used six nuts and seven bolts.
SUPMALE:That's not good.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, where have you been? I- I was upstairs playing dress-up in my room, and I heard Mrs.
LEADMALE:Alpeck pulling up next door, so I wanted to say hi to her.
OTHERMALE:Because I haven't seen her for such a long time.
SUPMALE:So I leaned out my window and I called to her, but she didn't hear me.
SUPMALE:So I leaned out some more and I fell out my window.
SUPMALE:And I'm coming back in now.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:Jennifer Jennifer, your window is 20 feet off the ground.
SUPMALE:You don't believe me, do you? If you'll excuse me, I'd like to go talk to Mom.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm sorry, honey.
LEADMALE:Your mom's asleep.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure you can talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:It's not the same.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, if you'll excuse us, I think she needs me right now.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Try and be a good brother, and they spit on you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh, what's What's going on? I made a mistake tonight, Dad.
LEADMALE:What did you do? I walked in on Mallory and Scott's date at Guido's.
LEADFEMALE:I made such a fool out of myself.
LEADMALE:It happens sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:It just happens.
LEADMALE:I wanted Scott to like me so much.
OTHERMALE:I thought if he got a good look at me in this dress, he'd leave Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:He doesn't know what he's missing, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, come on.
OTHERMALE:You cry.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
LEADMALE:You cry.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:What does Scott know? He knows that he doesn't want to be with me.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe you're too young to have a romance with someone like Scott.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want a romance.
LEADFEMALE:All I want is for things to go back the way they used to be.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm afraid that can't happen, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You and Scott had a very special relationship when you were younger.
LEADFEMALE:Things change.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so confused, Dad.
SUPMALE:I don't know the way I'm supposed to act.
SUPMALE:Sometimes I feel really grown up, and sometimes I feel like a little baby.
LEADFEMALE:That's one of the great things about being 11.
LEADMALE:You get to act any way you want.
LEADFEMALE:You do that at my age, they put you away.
SUPFEMALE:How did this happen to Scott? He grew up and I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:You grew up too, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:You're growing up right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, hi.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Um, can I be alone with Jen, Dad? We have some things to talk about.

SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Love that trail mix.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I made a big fool out of myself, huh? Ah.
LEADMALE:No, you didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I didn't notice anything.
LEADMALE:You must think I'm the biggest jerk in the world.
LEADFEMALE:As long as Alex is around, you aren't even the biggest jerk in this house.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I shouldn't have barged in on your date.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I should've been more sensitive to the way you feel.
LEADMALE:You know, I-I knew you were excited about Scott coming and everything.
LEADFEMALE:I should've invited you to come along with us.
SUPFEMALE:I may only be 11, but I know how many people it takes to make a good date.
SUPMALE:Mallory? Huh? What does it feel like to go out with boys? Is it as much fun as playing soccer with them? Um Well, it's a different kind of fun.
LEADMALE:Just give yourself a little time, Jen.
LEADMALE:You're getting there.
LEADFEMALE:I guess so.
SUPFEMALE:You know, lately I've been feeling like we weren't friends anymore.
SUPFEMALE:We don't spend time together like we used to.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on.
LEADFEMALE:We'll always be friends.
LEADMALE:It's just that we're growing up, and our interests are changing.
LEADFEMALE:You know? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm not so crazy about it, though.
LEADMALE:Do you want to go to the Cleveland Indians game with me tomorrow? Oh, wow.
OTHERMALE:I'd love to.

LEADFEMALE:I'll give up "Mallory" and take "Charo.

LEADFEMALE:You got turned down again? Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Harding National Bank turned me down today.
LEADFEMALE:Kinda hurt too.
LEADFEMALE:It's hard to be rejected by someone you love.

SUPMALE:You know, Dad is a thoughtful, sensitive, caring man.
SUPFEMALE:I could pick up some bad habits from him.
LEADMALE:I don't think you have to worry about becoming too sensitive, Alex.
SUPMALE:Can't help it.
OTHERMALE:I worry about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, I just don't think it would look good, me working for a nonprofit organization, you know? The, uh The whole concept of Of nonprofit is Ew.

LEADMALE:I don't mind.
LEADFEMALE:I love observing you in your work environment.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, I thought you promised to stop coming to the store to bother me.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't come here to bother you.
LEADMALE:I came here to, uh, buy something for my mother.
OTHERMALE:That's for your mother? Yeah, well, I thought I'd get a hat to go with it.
OTHERFEMALE:It's for my mother.
LEADMALE:Yeah, keep sticking to that story, Skip.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, Barbara Alexander just told me that you are her favorite salesperson.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's great.
SUPMALE:I am very pleased with the work you've been doing.

OTHERMALE:All right, Mallory, I realize you're a little cramped for space up there, but try and fit this thought in, okay? Mom and Dad are not gonna let you keep this job if you let your grades slide.
LEADMALE:Alex, her grades are fine.
LEADMALE:She got a 62 on today's geometry test.
SUPMALE:Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with that? It's 27 better than I got.
LEADFEMALE:"Even before birth, "your baby is sensitive to sound vibrations and will respond to some voices by moving and kicking.

OTHERFEMALE:Hi, I'm your sister Jennifer.
SUPMALE:As soon as you're born, look me up, okay? Kicking.
LEADMALE:I feel kicking.
SUPFEMALE:It's responding to your voice.
LEADFEMALE:I like her already.

LEADFEMALE:Well, that's terrific.
OTHERMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you do on your geometry test? Uh, you say you may get a promotion, hm? Sixty-two, a D.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you got a D in geometry? I think this is going to turn into something I'd rather not witness.
LEADFEMALE:Psst.
SUPMALE:Cover your ears.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I gotta go.
LEADFEMALE:You know how it pains me to see Mallory in trouble.
LEADMALE:I wish I could film this.
LEADFEMALE:I have to say, we're disappointed, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me too, but I'll make it up in the final, you'll see.
OTHERFEMALE:Can I go now? Mallory, please.
LEADMALE:The, uh The three of us agreed that if you couldn't keep your grades up, you'd have to quit the job.
OTHERMALE:I know, but this job's really important to me.
SUPMALE:It It's just a job, Mallory.
LEADMALE:It's not as important as school.
SUPMALE:Maybe not to you, but to me it is.
LEADMALE:Honey, school is the most School, school, school.
SUPMALE:You know, I'm tired of hearing about school.
LEADFEMALE:It's not the only worthwhile thing in life.
LEADFEMALE:W I'm I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to quit the job.
LEADMALE:I can't believe they're making me quit.
LEADFEMALE:That job is the best thing in my life.
LEADFEMALE:When I'm working I feel good about myself, you know? I feel needed there.
LEADMALE:I feel respected.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:You know, you're actually competent there.
LEADFEMALE:You're like a different person.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, could you talk to them for me? See if you can convince them to let me keep the job? Uh, you mean, do you a favor? Well, yeah, but I'd be doing you a favor too.
SUPFEMALE:I won't be home as much.
SUPFEMALE:That's good, but I need more.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Alex, you owe me a favor.
LEADMALE:Oh, how do you figure? Didn't I fix you up last month with the Fergus twins? The Fergus twins? Mallory, one of them was a guy.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know that.
OTHERFEMALE:And he was the cute one.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, why don't you just help her? You could talk Mom and Dad into anything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's true.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Alex, Jen's right.
OTHERFEMALE:You can be really cunning, devious, and manipulative when you want to be.
SUPFEMALE:Stop trying to butter me up.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, ahem, it has been a while since I've had to talk them into anything.
LEADFEMALE:I could probably use the practice.
LEADMALE:Please, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:This job is really important to me.
LEADMALE:It's my whole life.
SUPFEMALE:Please help me.
OTHERFEMALE:And so I I I said to the waitress, "No, not mustard.
LEADFEMALE:I said custard.
SUPMALE:" I'm sorry, honey, it's just not responding to your voice.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mom, Dad, uh, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mallory told me about what happened, and, uh, well, I just wanted to say that I think you handled that situation impeccably.
LEADFEMALE:I fully agree with your decision and with your execution thereof.
LEADMALE:I can't tell you how happy we are to have your blessing.
LEADFEMALE:But, uh, I I have a little proposal that I'd like to present.
SUPMALE:Hold on to your wallet, Steven.
LEADMALE:Mallory has three midterms left.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if she really applies herself and And gets Bs or above on all of the tests, she keeps her job.
LEADMALE:Alex, it's already been settled.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory's done poorly on her last few tests.
LEADMALE:and she's gotta quit.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but those tests are history.
LEADMALE:They're over with.
OTHERMALE:Let's face it, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Nothing we do can bring back those tests.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, brother.
SUPMALE:The thing to do is to look forward to the future.
OTHERFEMALE:Start off with a clean slate.
LEADMALE:Let's learn from our mistakes.
SUPMALE:If we learned from our mistakes, we wouldn't be here listening to you.
OTHERMALE:You see, Dad, your agreement before was too vague for Mallory.
SUPMALE:You see, the child needs more specific guidelines.
SUPFEMALE:All you said was "to do well.
LEADMALE:" What is "doing well"? Mallory, had you any idea that you were expected to get Bs? I had no such knowledge.
SUPMALE:There you have it.
SUPFEMALE:Let us start anew, shall we? Three Bs.
OTHERMALE:Three Bs and she keeps the job.
LEADFEMALE:That is the most reasonable thing I've ever heard in my life.
LEADMALE:Uh, listen, Alex, uh, just out of curiosity, why are you doing this for Mallory? Can't you just accept the fact that a guy like me would, uh, help his sister in her time of need? Absolutely not.
SUPFEMALE:Alex's motive aside, uh, it does sound pretty fair to me.
SUPMALE:Steven? It's all right with me.
LEADMALE:Well, there you have it.
SUPMALE:Well, okay.
LEADFEMALE:I I have to admit, I felt bad about you having to quit the job.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so did I.
SUPFEMALE:This gives you another chance, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Mom.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, we'll be back from our walk about half an hour.
LEADMALE:Okay, bye.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Whoo! Well, did I come through? Boy, was I great.
SUPMALE:I haven't lost the old touch, you know.
LEADMALE:They were putty in my hands.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
SUPMALE:Alex, three Bs? I'm never gonna get three Bs.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not smart enough.
LEADMALE:Not smart enough? Mallory, could someone who's not smart handle that store? Well, it's true you You may not have book smarts, but you got something else.
LEADFEMALE:You got something that might even be more important.
LEADFEMALE:What? You've got fabric smarts.
LEADMALE:Fabric smarts? Yeah, yeah, you You know which stripes go with which checks.
SUPFEMALE:You know whether the socks are supposed to match the shoes or the pants.
LEADFEMALE:You know when to machine-wash, and when to tumble-dry.
SUPMALE:Alex, washing and drying are separate events.
LEADMALE:Separate events.
LEADMALE:Whoa! I wouldn't have known that in a million years.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, though.
SUPMALE:Three Bs? Do you really think I can do it? Oh, Mallory, I know you can do it, because I am going to help you do it.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna be with you every step of the way, Mal, tutoring you, coaching you, guiding you.
LEADMALE:But why? Why, Mal? Because I am the architect of this deal.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, how would it look if you were to lose the job I fought so hard for you to keep? I'd be a laughingstock.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna see you through this, because my credibility is on the line.
LEADMALE:Three Bs? You can do it.
SUPMALE:You're sure you're not just saying this to cheer me up? Mallory, think about it.
LEADMALE:Have I ever said anything just to cheer you up? And so, my child to be, it is with great eagerness and anticipation that I await your birth.
SUPMALE:Many, um Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Just Uh, many years of blissful father/child interaction await us.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you are as enthusiastic as I am.
OTHERMALE:Not a nudge, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't understand it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it doesn't feel like kicking.
OTHERMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, kid.
LEADMALE:It kicked! It kicked! Sorry, Dad, I guess you just don't have the right touch.

SUPMALE:Alex, you're worrying too much about your sister.
LEADMALE:I never thought I'd hear myself say that.
LEADMALE:I just think it would be a shame if she had to give up that job, that's all.
SUPMALE:She She was really something at that sale last night.
OTHERMALE:You know, I have never seen Mallory handle so many things so well.
LEADFEMALE:She was in total control.
SUPFEMALE:A human dynamo.
LEADFEMALE:Reminded me of me when I was her age.
OTHERMALE:Don't say it, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Don't say what? You don't know what I was going to say.
LEADMALE:I've been married to you for 20 years.
SUPFEMALE:I know exactly what you were gonna say.
SUPFEMALE:All I was going to say was Mallory's been working very hard and I think we ought to let her keep the job no matter how she does on the test.
LEADMALE:Come on, Steven.
OTHERMALE:We've been through this so many times.
SUPFEMALE:Whenever we try to lay down the law, set some limits, instill some discipline, you You just can't stick with it.
LEADFEMALE:You fold like a house of cards.
SUPMALE:I'm flexible, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:I happen to be very proud of that.
SUPMALE:Well, this is not the time for your fabled flexibility.
LEADMALE:It's important that we stick together on this.
SUPFEMALE:You know, join forces, present a united front.
LEADMALE:Elyse, we're parents.
OTHERFEMALE:We're not NATO.
SUPMALE:Whoa, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:How did we do? How did we do? How did we do? C- minus.
SUPMALE:C- minus? That's lower than a C.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I tried my hardest, but that's the best I could do.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Mal.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry too.
LEADFEMALE:I let you down, Alex.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:I'm the one who should be apologizing to you.

LEADFEMALE:I have a Social Studies test coming up.
LEADMALE:You could help me.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I am never helping anybody again.
LEADFEMALE:What's the point? You just get burned.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks anyway, Jen.
SUPMALE:Mallory, wait.
SUPMALE:Let's talk about this.
SUPFEMALE:Look, even though this didn't turn out the way you wanted, I'm proud of how hard you worked at school and at the store.
LEADMALE:Well, that's all real nice, but we had a deal.
SUPMALE:I didn't get the grades, and now I have to quit.
LEADMALE:You really liked the job, didn't you? I loved it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when I'm working there, I feel like a real person, you know? I practically run the store.
LEADMALE:And people come to me for advice, and I give it to them.
SUPMALE:Me.
LEADMALE:Dumb little Mallory.
SUPMALE:They don't think of me as dumb little Mallory at the store.
SUPFEMALE:They think of me as an intelligent, creative young woman.
LEADFEMALE:I like being thought of that way.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I might as well get it over with.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call Mrs.
LEADMALE:Willis.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Why do you want me to wait? Well, uh, maybe you should call her later, when the rates go down.
LEADMALE:Mom, the store's a half a mile away.
LEADMALE:So wait 10 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:This is hard enough as it is.
LEADFEMALE:Let me get this over with.
SUPMALE:Let me quit.
LEADFEMALE:Look, see, I I think maybe you're being a little hasty.
SUPMALE:We should talk about this some more.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe quitting isn't the right thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:I have to quit.
LEADFEMALE:We made a deal.
LEADFEMALE:Look, the job is too important for you.
SUPMALE:Not as important as your respect.
LEADMALE:Hey You're not quitting the job.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am.
LEADMALE:You're not quitting the job.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am.
SUPMALE:You're not quitting, and that's final.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you can stop me from calling now, but I'll just stop by the store on my way home from school tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Well, then maybe you won't go to school tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, what's going on? What's happening to Mom? I I think she's having some, uh Some second thoughts about that deal we made.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it.
SUPMALE:Well, your father and I have been talking, and maybe we have been overemphasizing school.
LEADMALE:Maybe having a C average and doing real well at a job is the same as having a B average and no job.
LEADMALE:You mean you want me to keep the job? And break the deal we made? Well, if it were up to me, yes.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you know how flexible I am.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, but I don't know about your dad.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you know how set in his ways he is.
LEADMALE:Dad? Well, your mother's convinced me.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:We have to be flexible.
LEADFEMALE:What a fool I've been.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:If you want me to keep the job.
LEADFEMALE:We do.
LEADFEMALE:Hm? You know, kid, your parents aren't so bad after all.

LEADMALE:Okay, I've got it.
LEADMALE:One test, winner take all.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory gets 100 or she moves out of the house.
OTHERMALE:
LEADMALE:This is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Where do they come up with this stuff? What's the matter, Alex? All freshmen are required to take a Humanities course.
LEADMALE:What's so bad about that? Well, the The choices are absurd.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, listen to this one.
OTHERFEMALE:Humanities 1
LEADFEMALE:Man, Society, Civilization, the Universe.
LEADFEMALE:How am I supposed to relate to this stuff? Just don't talk in class and they'll think you're one of them.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, I'm in college to learn about money, not people.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, there's more to life than getting rich.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, people who have money don't need people.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mallory, uh, could you possibly turn that up a little? I can still hear planes passing overhead.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mallory, look, help me out, will you? Hey.

LEADMALE:I'm a little tense this morning.
LEADMALE:Alex is just in a bad mood 'cause they want him to be a human at college.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, they don't want me to be a human.
OTHERFEMALE:They want me to take a Humanities course.
SUPMALE:Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Dad, maybe you can help me out with this.
LEADMALE:You, uh, have a commitment to social change, a love for the humanities.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:Some of these courses look pretty interesting, Alex.

LEADMALE:You're more sensitive than I thought.

SUPFEMALE:Hey, uh, I gotta speak to Mallory before I go.
LEADFEMALE:I I got us a couple of tickets to the NCAA chess semifinals.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I I want to invite her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Skip, she just left.
OTHERFEMALE:Although if you hurry, you may be able to catch her.
SUPFEMALE:You know, usually it takes her to back out of the driveway.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, hey, Mallory! It's me! It's Skippy! Uh, do you want to go out with me Friday night? She She stopped.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's considering it.
LEADFEMALE:Um, you know that telephone pole out there? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It smashed into our car.
LEADMALE:I I'll check for damage.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, the car! Oh, the car.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad's car.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, how could you do that? You know you're not supposed to be driving.
LEADFEMALE:You're You're being punished.
LEADFEMALE:What am I gonna do, Alex? We have to get that fixed before Dad gets back.
SUPFEMALE:How are we gonna pay for that? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:There's gotta be three hundred dollars damage to that car.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know where we're gonna come up with that kind of money.
SUPMALE:Uh, good news.
LEADFEMALE:The telephone pole's okay.
OTHERMALE:Look, Skippy, uh, we've got a little problem here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, maybe you could come back another time.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't know where I'm gonna go.
SUPMALE:I can't go home.
LEADMALE:Why not? It's jammed with people.
SUPFEMALE:My whole family's here for the big Leland homecoming game.
LEADFEMALE:They're making me sleep in the garage.
LEADMALE:Unless you guys don't want to rent me a room, huh? Not while I'm alive.
LEADMALE:Skippy, why, uh? Why aren't your relatives staying in a hotel? Because there isn't one available room between here and the state line.
LEADFEMALE:Hm.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, there is.
LEADMALE:Alex, no.
LEADFEMALE:If there really is a shortage of rooms, it seems to me that somebody who had a room to rent out this weekend could really make a killing.
LEADMALE:Or at least enough to buy a new fender, if you get my drift.
OTHERMALE:Alex, no.
LEADMALE:Well, Alex has a point.
SUPMALE:There's a lot of money to be made.
LEADMALE:My dad's charging his cousins $45 a night.
SUPMALE:But Alex, it's wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course it's wrong, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Seventy-five a night is right.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:It's wrong, and I'm telling you you can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what if Mom and Dad find out? What if Mom and Dad see the piece of modern art you turned their car into? Do it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, the, uh, ad is in the paper.
SUPFEMALE:What's our state of readiness, Skipper? All systems are go, chief.
LEADFEMALE:The baby's room is in a state of rental preparedness.
LEADMALE:It still feels weird to me, renting out a room in our own house.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Jen, don't Don't think of it as renting.
SUPFEMALE:All we're doing is letting strangers use a room in our home for money.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I think? Don't ask the impossible, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I think that Mom and Dad would not approve of this.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Mallory.
LEADMALE:You underestimate our parents.
SUPMALE:Now, they are thoughtful, generous people, and I think they'd be thrilled to know we were using their home to To shelter weary travelers.
SUPFEMALE:You mean we're gonna tell them? What are you, crazy? Uh, hi.
SUPFEMALE:We've come about the room.
LEADFEMALE:Come right in.

LEADMALE:Make it 90.
LEADMALE:I'm not as offended anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Do something, Jack.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna sleep in the car again.

LEADMALE:I've been to a lot of weddings.
LEADMALE:You think Doug's making a mistake by getting married, don't you? B- but Eleanor, it's nothing personal, you know? I mean, you seem real nice.
LEADMALE:It's just that I don't think Doug is ready to get married right now, you know, to anyone.
LEADMALE:Well, why not? Because he's so naive? Well, It's not that he's naive.
SUPFEMALE:It's that he's Innocent.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but But it's more than that.
SUPMALE:It's that he sees the world through the eyes of a child, almost like an infant? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, like an infant.
LEADMALE:Like an infant who was raised in the woods by other infants.
LEADFEMALE:I remember the very beginning.
LEADMALE:I would walk home from school, and he would walk backwards ten paces in front of me, calling to me in Italian, and And tossing flowers at my feet.
LEADFEMALE:And I remember thinking, "Who is this strange boy?" Yeah, well, he's one of a kind.
OTHERFEMALE:One day he said, "I must show you my treasures," and he emptied his knapsack right on my front steps.
SUPFEMALE:I never saw such an odd collection of things.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, all those aluminum cans.
SUPFEMALE:Little wind-up dinosaurs.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Picture of Sergio Frankie.

LEADMALE:Maybe you're afraid.
LEADMALE:Of what? Of losing Doug to Eleanor.
OTHERMALE:Losing Doug to Eleanor? Come on, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:You make it sound like Losing Doug to Eleanor.
LEADMALE:That's absurd.
LEADFEMALE:I knew him first.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Eleanor is not taking Doug away.
OTHERFEMALE:The two of you can still be friends.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but Look, who Who's gonna look after him now? You know, who's gonna hold his glasses when he drinks out of the water fountain? Who's gonna help him find his keys? Who's gonna tell him not to walk when the sign says "don't walk"? She will.
LEADMALE:Those are my jobs.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:This is just the tip of the iceberg.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is changing.

LEADMALE:I should have dove for it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, uh, that's not just any ball, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I know, Dad.

LEADFEMALE:You always got extra sprinkles.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.

LEADMALE:I'll take your word for it.
LEADMALE:Those were good times, weren't they? The best.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, anyway, what do you say we, uh, go down there and toss the ol' pigskin around? Dad, I'd have to change and everything.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well Well, this is it.
SUPFEMALE:This is it? This is it.

LEADFEMALE:We're gonna have a great time.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, where's our room? This is it.
LEADMALE:Where's your room? This is it.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the bathroom? If you say this is it, I'm leaving.

LEADMALE:We can make the best of it.
OTHERMALE:Well, we might as well unpack.
LEADMALE:No, no.

SUPFEMALE:What do you wanna wrap? Uh, no.
LEADMALE:Not Not wrap with a W.
LEADFEMALE:This is rap with an R.
LEADFEMALE:Um, it's It's a term we used in the '60s.
LEADFEMALE:It means talk, but "talk session" didn't sound right, so we used to say Well, never mind.
OTHERMALE:Let's just sit down and talk.
LEADFEMALE:What do you wanna talk about? Uh, well, um, I w-wanna talk about the change that's gonna happen in our lives when the baby comes home.

LEADFEMALE:What else is on your mind, Mal? Nothing.
LEADMALE:Uh, Jennifer, w- w-what about you? I mean, you've always been the youngest, the baby.
LEADMALE:This is all gonna change.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any special feelings that you want to discuss? I'm still feeling a little carsick.
SUPMALE:I'm afraid I might throw up.
SUPMALE:Thanks for sharing that with us, Jen.
OTHERFEMALE:She asked for my feelings.
SUPMALE:That's not what she meant.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have to be so gross.
SUPMALE:Girls.
LEADMALE:Girls.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe this isn't the right time for a rap session.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe Maybe we can ease into that one later.
LEADFEMALE:Um Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've got an idea.
LEADFEMALE:I was gonna save this for tomorrow, but we're in the mood now, so why not? Heh.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:You brought a photo album with you? Oh, this is not just any photo album.
SUPFEMALE:This is an album that I made up of our history together as mother and daughters.
LEADMALE:Keaton 
LEADMALE:Oh, How We've Grown.
LEADFEMALE:These are old pictures, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I know they're old pictures.
LEADMALE:That's the point.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's none in here of Alex or Dad.
SUPMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:That's the point.
LEADMALE:It's It's just us.
LEADMALE:But we've seen these pictures before, haven't we? No, not like this.
SUPFEMALE:Not all together.
LEADFEMALE:See? Not Not in this format.
SUPMALE:They're still the same old pictures.
SUPMALE:They are not the same old pictures.
SUPMALE:When you put 'em all together in one book, they take on a totally different meaning.
LEADFEMALE:Now, they show the joy and the closeness that we've shared down through the years.
LEADMALE:Now, sit down and share the joy.
LEADFEMALE:Say, I I got it.
LEADMALE:How about a game of chess, huh? Yeah, okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Dad, uh, if you really want to.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, all right.
LEADFEMALE:This is great.
LEADFEMALE:All right, so, uh, play a few games of chess, and we'll go out for a real man's night on the town, huh? Get a couple of big steaks, very rare, then, uh, back here for brandy and cigars.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Susie.

LEADMALE:I got some new strategy lined up.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
SUPFEMALE:You move first, lad.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:That, uh That was Susie Farkas.
LEADFEMALE:Susie Farkas? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You remember her.
SUPFEMALE:I had this big crush on her all the way through high school.
LEADFEMALE:She wouldn't even talk to me then.
SUPFEMALE:So anyway, she just, uh She came into town to surprise her folks, but, uh, they weren't home.
LEADFEMALE:So she called me and invited me over to her, um, empty house now.
LEADMALE:Oh.

LEADMALE:No.

LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:I'm over that.
LEADMALE:No, I'd much rather just hang around here with you.
SUPMALE:Play chess.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we're, uh We're in the middle of a game here, you know? It wouldn't be right for me to just pick up and leave in the middle of a game.
LEADFEMALE:If the game were over, you know, then that would be a different matter entirely.
SUPMALE:Bad move, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Bad move.
LEADFEMALE:Checkmate.

LEADMALE:I- in fact, Alex is on his way home from the market right now with his own frozen dinner.
LEADMALE:We're having a race.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:All right, we're not having a race.
LEADFEMALE:Alex hasn't been here all day.
SUPMALE:He went over to Susie Farkas' house.
LEADMALE:The girls aren't out making copies.
LEADMALE:They're at the movies.
OTHERMALE:We came home early 'cause they were bored out of their minds.
OTHERMALE:I guess this didn't turn out the way we planned, huh? I tried, Steven.
SUPMALE:I really tried.
LEADMALE:I mean, I-I steered the conversation towards all the old things we used to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:I had the photo album, but they weren't interested.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, we shouldn't feel too bad about this.
LEADFEMALE:It was bound to happen.
OTHERFEMALE:The kids are older now.
LEADMALE:Their lives are expanding to include more and more things all the time.
OTHERMALE:Well, I say we put a stop to it.
LEADMALE:Elyse.
LEADMALE:Well, the depressing thing is it doesn't look like it's gonna get any better.
SUPMALE:Aren't you forgetting something, Elyse? We're gonna have a baby in the house pretty soon.
LEADMALE:So what? The baby's not gonna wanna look at the photo album.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is nice.
OTHERFEMALE:We should be happy to have a little quiet time to spend like this before the baby's born.
LEADMALE:I am happy.
LEADFEMALE:The best part is, we have each other to spend it with.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, great.
LEADMALE:Glad to see somebody's having a good time tonight.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Alex, what are you doing home so early? I thought you had a date with the legendary Susie Farkas.
SUPFEMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, so did three other guys.
OTHERFEMALE:We all sat around her house and watched professional bowling on TV.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the only one who paid any attention to me was her dog, Pierre? I told him to get off my leg, and he barked.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry it went so badly for you.
LEADMALE:Ah, don't worry about it, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Tell you what.
LEADMALE:It's kind of reassuring to come home after a night like tonight, and find you the two of you on the couch carrying on like a couple of crazy teenagers.
SUPFEMALE:Makes me feel like everything's all right, you know? Oh, great.
LEADMALE:They're here.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Ho-ho.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I really missed you.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:W- what are you guys doing home now? Is the movie out already? No, Mallory saw some boy she knew, then we had to leave.
SUPMALE:She didn't wanna be seen with me.
LEADMALE:It's nothing personal, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't want him to think I've got nothing better to do on a Saturday night but to hang around with you.
SUPMALE:Now, who could take that personally? Mom, we really need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I need to reevaluate my whole life.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you have a minute? I think you're underestimating your problem, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it would take a team of mothers working around the clock.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Come up to my room.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mallory, you don't mind if we wait until tomorrow to talk, do you? I'm really pretty tired.
LEADMALE:I thought I'd finish this chapter and go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll join you, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy, please don't go to bed yet.
OTHERFEMALE:I haven't see you all day.
LEADMALE:We have a lot of catching up to do.
SUPMALE:Come on, you guys, if I'd have known I was gonna spend the evening with Mallory and Jennifer I would've stayed with Susie Farkas and Pierre.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, Alex.
LEADMALE:We're pretty tired.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you guys.
SUPMALE:It's not the same without you two.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, come on, stay.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, come on.
LEADMALE:Look, you can sleep any time.
LEADFEMALE:We're all together now.
LEADMALE:Let's do something.
SUPMALE:You know, we don't do enough family stuff anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I got a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:I could make some popcorn, and we can all watch old movies on TV.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
SUPMALE:Great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you kids do that, and we'll just toodle upstairs here.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Okay, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:You win.
SUPFEMALE:Get your old Peace Corps films.
SUPFEMALE:We'll watch those.
LEADFEMALE:Both reels? Yeah, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Both reels.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, great.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jen.
OTHERFEMALE:You can help me make popcorn.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure you wanna be seen with me? You never know who you might run into in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:What do you make of this, Steven? This morning we were the two most boring people in the world.
SUPMALE:And now they can't get enough of us.
SUPMALE:Um, maybe with kids, you just have to take it when you can get it.
LEADMALE:We've got everybody together, and we're gonna have a nice, quiet family evening.
SUPMALE:And if anybody tries to run out, I say we smack 'em.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Mom, I still don't think that a woman in your condition should be traveling alone.
SUPMALE:Alex, you know, if you had it your way, Mom would be locked in her room for nine months wearing a veil.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:That is not true.
LEADMALE:I see no need for a veil.
LEADMALE:Mom, what if you have the baby on the plane? Well, then we name her Amelia Earhart Keaton.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, honey, I'm not gonna have the baby on the plane.
SUPMALE:Elyse, are you sure you don't want me to come with you? Oh, no, honey.
LEADMALE:The kids need you here.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, what would you do at a convention with 200 women architects? Arm wrestle for money? Hi, there, folks.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:It's time.
OTHERFEMALE:You're going to the hospital, right? You're gonna have I I had a feeling it was gonna be today.
SUPMALE:I'm going to Michigan.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:You want the baby to have dual citizenship.
LEADMALE:No, Skippy, I'm Never mind, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Mallory, try and explain it to him.
SUPMALE:Elyse, come on.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna miss your plane.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, yes, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, walk me to the car.
OTHERFEMALE:Be good.
LEADMALE:Don't forget this.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, love.

LEADMALE:Look, Skippy, we all know how you feel about Mallory.

LEADMALE:The one with the funny name.
LEADMALE:Jane? I better write it down.
SUPFEMALE:Jane.
SUPMALE:Jane.
SUPFEMALE:J- A-N-E.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't this a little sudden, Skip? I mean, you just met this girl.
LEADMALE:Alex, it was love at first sight.
LEADFEMALE:I will not rest until I have made that girl mine.
LEADFEMALE:How are you planning to do that? Well, I was kinda hoping you'd talk to her for me.
LEADMALE:No way, Skip.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Just keep me out of this, all right? Alex, please? You've gotta help me.
OTHERFEMALE:You know I can't talk to girls.
SUPMALE:I- I I get too nervous.
LEADMALE:I I get all tongue-tied.
LEADFEMALE:I try to speak, but I I I just freeze up.
SUPMALE:I I don't know what to say.
SUPMALE:Well, uh, tell her about yourself, you know? Discuss your good qualities.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:What are they? Well, uh, you have never been convicted of a federal offense.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:You, uh You buy your clothes right off the rack.
LEADFEMALE:And you don't spit when you talk.

OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Alex, did you get a chance to talk to Jane yet? Uh, no.

LEADMALE:Oh, really? This is kinda sudden, Skippy.
LEADMALE:I mean, you never even talked to the girl.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know anything about her.

SUPMALE:You worship me, and I reject you.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, those were wonderful years.
LEADMALE:But it's over.
LEADMALE:Try to be strong.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, does Jane talk about me much? She doesn't even know you exist.
LEADMALE:That's good.

LEADFEMALE:If she means that much to you, I'll talk to her.
LEADMALE:I don't know how that mouse got away.
SUPFEMALE:I was sure I had him cornered.
LEADMALE:Face it, 
LEADFEMALE:he was toying with you.
LEADMALE:I'll get him, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:He's in this house somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll find him.

LEADMALE:How are they getting along? Dad, this has gotten completely out of hand.
LEADMALE:You see, Skippy saw Jane, and he fell instantly in love with her.
LEADFEMALE:And he tried to talk to her, but all he could get out was mlaaaah.
LEADMALE:So he asked me to try and talk to her, which I did.
LEADFEMALE:Only to find out that she's been in love with me since the first grade.
LEADMALE:So Skippy thinks I've been telling her about him for three days, but every time I- I bring up his name, she cuts me off with a kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Whew.
SUPFEMALE:How much of this does Skippy know? Uh, everything up to the mlaaaah.
SUPFEMALE:I see.

SUPMALE:And she's attracted to me.
LEADFEMALE:We're beginning to develop a very significant, very meaningful lust for each other.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look.
LEADMALE:Alex, obviously this girl is a lot more important to Skippy than she is to you.
SUPMALE:I think you know what you should do.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right, Dad.

SUPMALE:I'm very nervous.
LEADFEMALE:I'm more than nervous.
LEADMALE:I'm petrified.
LEADMALE:What if I? If I say the wrong thing? What if I do the wrong thing? Look, Skippy, just trust your instincts, okay? You can't go wrong.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh I brought along $10.
SUPMALE:I thought I might give it to Jane as a gift.
LEADFEMALE:On second thought, ignore your instincts.
LEADMALE:Okay? I can do that.
LEADMALE:Do that.
OTHERMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, guys.
SUPMALE:Oh, Jane, uh Won't you join us? Uhhh You'll have to excuse Skippy.

LEADMALE:That is not the point, Alex.
LEADMALE:You had no right to hire anyone without consulting me first.
LEADMALE:Well, Dad, I knew you were working, and I didn't see any point in bothering you.
LEADMALE:Besides, Dad, in my wildest imaginations, I couldn't dream of a better woman for the job.
LEADMALE:Is that Miss Nicholson here yet? Nope, nope, not yet.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you didn't hire some dumpy-looking old lady, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, you shouldn't be so concerned with the way a person looks.

LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, I just want to thank you so much for this job.
SUPMALE:You have no idea how much it means to me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, Alex told me how well the interview went and, uh, based on that, I have complete confidence in you.
LEADFEMALE:I am so relieved to hear you say that.
LEADMALE:You know, in your ad, you said you were looking for someone with experience as a housekeeper.
LEADFEMALE:When I read that I didn't figure I had a shot.
SUPMALE:Uh, you, uh You have no experience? Well, Dad, she means she has no experience in the literal sense.
LEADMALE:But as Jean-Paul Sartre said, isn't the act of simply being alive, you know, suffering through the existential angst that is life, isn't that? Isn't that the best kind of experience for being a housekeeper? You ever see Sartre's house? I'm a quick learner, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton, you'll see, and I'm very eager to get started.
SUPFEMALE:Well, there is something to be said for enthusiasm.
SUPMALE:Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:It's the most important trait in a housekeeper.

LEADFEMALE:I do have something you can do, uh, Karen.
SUPMALE:My wife should be getting up soon and she's going to want some breakfast.
SUPFEMALE:I've got to get going here, so would you mind? What does she like to eat? Well, a couple of eggs, usually.

LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:That's not right, is it? No, no, no, that's That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, some people boil eggs one way, and some people boil them another.
LEADFEMALE:That's what makes America great.
LEADFEMALE:I could tape it up.
LEADMALE:Uh, n Uh, no, no, um, she doesn't like them taped.
SUPFEMALE:Well, here, I'd better start over again.
OTHERMALE:Oh! I'll get that tape.
LEADMALE:I'm having so much fun.
SUPFEMALE:This is the first load of laundry I've ever done here.
OTHERMALE:Come to think of it, it's the first load of laundry I've ever done.

LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Think Dad will notice? Only if he keeps his eyes open.
SUPFEMALE:Karen is so nice.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want her to get into trouble.
LEADMALE:Now, now, she doesn't have to.
SUPFEMALE:Not Not if the three of us stick together and help her through this little crisis.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's great.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, then it's settled.

LEADFEMALE:It doesn't seem like work to us, either.
LEADMALE:Good evening.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey.
SUPFEMALE:It's the Keatons.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, it's him.
SUPMALE:It's the Convict, huh? Is that what you were gonna say? No.
LEADMALE:I was gonna say, "Dad, it's him, the nanny.
LEADFEMALE:" You know each other? Yeah, I applied for a job as their housekeeper, but they turned me down.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? I feel so guilty.
LEADFEMALE:They hired me.
OTHERFEMALE:I wonder why they took you instead of me.
LEADMALE:What did you wear to the interview? I wore my blue dress with black heels.
SUPFEMALE:Heels! I knew it, I knew it.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you got a lot of experience as a housekeeper.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I've had no experience.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we all know what Sartre says about experience.
SUPMALE:Karen, uh, we need to talk.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:We do.
LEADMALE:You're a very nice person.
LEADMALE:Nice? Come on, Dad.
LEADMALE:You're more than nice.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me, I have to interrupt you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really starting to feel guilty, here.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? Well, you take me out to dinner at a wonderful medium-priced restaurant.
LEADMALE:You treat me like one of your family and now you're saying all these nice things about me, but I've let you down.
LEADMALE:You have? I know I've probably kept it hidden from you, but I'm not a good housekeeper.
LEADFEMALE:Really? It's been bothering me ever since I started.
LEADFEMALE:I never should have taken this job.
OTHERFEMALE:I came into your house and ruined everything.
LEADMALE:Well, not everything.
SUPFEMALE:Look, let's face it, okay? I'm a failure.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not good at anything, and I never will be.
LEADFEMALE:Karen, stop putting yourself down like this.
SUPFEMALE:This isn't the first job that hasn't worked out for me.
SUPFEMALE:Don't feel bad.
LEADMALE:I I'll just move on to something else.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no, no, Karen, please stay.
OTHERFEMALE:It's been wonderful, but I can't do this any longer.
LEADFEMALE:Karen Boy, having a housekeeper is hard work.
LEADMALE:I know, but it's worth it to keep Karen around though.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Uh, where's Karen? Uh, girls, sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, look, um, Karen, uh Karen won't be working for us anymore.
SUPFEMALE:You fired her? No.
SUPFEMALE:Certainly not.
SUPMALE:Pfft.
OTHERFEMALE:They think that we would fire Karen.
OTHERMALE:We We tried to fire her.
SUPMALE:She quit before we got around to it.
LEADMALE:And you let her quit? She knew that she wasn't doing a good job.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what does that have to do with anything? She was my friend.
LEADMALE:She was all of our friends.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, I know, but we set out to find a housekeeper, not a friend.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm really gonna miss seeing her.
LEADMALE:That goes triple for me.
SUPFEMALE:Everything in this kitchen reminds me of her.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:This is the stove, she didn't know how to use.
LEADFEMALE:And the sink where she used to always break our dishes.
OTHERMALE:And the toaster where she started a fire.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm gonna cry.
LEADMALE:Well, it's gonna be tough breaking this to your mom.
LEADMALE:She was in the middle of teaching Karen how to roll socks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look who's here.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you, Karen.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton, I've been doing a lot of thinking.
LEADMALE:Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and Well, see, I've spent my whole life running away from things, and I've decided it's time for me to stop running.
LEADMALE:I really want to make a success of this job, and you want me to stay, so I think it would be wrong for me to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing could be wronger, right, Dad? Let's give it another try.
OTHERMALE:Yay! Hey, Karen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to know I'm really gonna try to improve.

SUPMALE:Yeah, that was exciting.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, morning.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, get off the phone.
OTHERMALE:I'm not on the phone.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, it was just reflex.
LEADMALE:Will you get off the pho? I can't stop doing that.
SUPMALE:What's your obsession with the phone this morning? I'm waiting for an important phone call from Susie Farkas.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, uh, yesterday I invited her to the big Alpha Phi Epsilon dance, So will you get off the phone? I can't stop doing that.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, you're not in a fraternity.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you going to the dance? Because they invited me, Jen, along with a few other select freshmen, so they can evaluate us an decide if they like us.
SUPMALE:I don't see what you're so excited about, Alex.
SUPMALE:I heard the Alpha guys are just a bunch of rich, snobby kids.
LEADFEMALE:All they care about is status, success and money.
LEADMALE:That's exactly why I'm excited.
SUPMALE:Alex, can I make you some breakfast? Karen, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I I was so caught up in myself this morning that I didn't even notice how great you look today.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you.

SUPFEMALE:When the guys at Alpha house see her as my date, I'm as good as in.
SUPMALE:Is that how they judge you, by how good your date looks? Actually, Dad, the way I see it, it's just one factor among many.
LEADMALE:You know, they're also interested in, uh, how I dress and what kind of car I drive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's a different story.

LEADMALE:Uh You, uh You could have dressed more casually.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, this is very difficult for me to say.
LEADMALE:I'm having trouble coming up with the exact words, so I-I hope you'll forgive me if I kind of stammer and beat around the bush.
OTHERMALE:Uh, no No problem.
LEADFEMALE:Take your time.
SUPFEMALE:I quit.
LEADFEMALE:Quit? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, I know you've been wondering why a person like me applied for a housekeeping job in the first place.
SUPMALE:Well, it has crossed my mind.
LEADMALE:You see, I'm from a rich family, and we always had servants to take care of us and clean up.
LEADMALE:I never learned how to do anything like that.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I'm such a terrible cook.
LEADMALE:So you became a A housekeeper to learn to do those things.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:There's more.
SUPMALE:You see, I never had to do anything for myself, and so, in some ways, I never really grew up.
SUPFEMALE:After I got out of college, I had no interest in a In a career of any kind.
SUPMALE:I was bored.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, you became a housekeeper.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:There's still more.
SUPMALE:You see, I felt like I needed to cling on to somebody or something, so I met this man, an older man, recently separated from his wife, and we fell in love.
OTHERMALE:Are we up to the hou Housekeeping part yet? No.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, my parents didn't approve of him, but I didn't really mind because this man had asked me to marry him.
SUPMALE:Except he didn't.
SUPFEMALE:And I found out I wasn't the only girl he was dating and then he went back to his wife.
LEADMALE:So, all of a sudden, I found myself very alone and very scared.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, you became a housekeeper to earn a living.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I lived off my trust fund for a year, but then it ran out, so then Then what? Then I became your housekeeper.
LEADMALE:But not just for the money.
LEADMALE:Also for the companionship.
LEADFEMALE:See, I was hoping I'd find a really nice family that I could become close to since I was never really close to my own, and I did.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, uh can you excuse us for a minute? No, Alex, it's all right.
SUPMALE:Your father knows everything.
LEADFEMALE:Karen, I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I I feel terrible.
LEADMALE:I- I was so caught up in my In my own problems that I didn't pay any attention to your feelings.
LEADMALE:You said you didn't want to go.
LEADFEMALE:I should have respected that.
LEADMALE:Go? Go where? You know, it's ironic.
LEADFEMALE:One of the main reasons I came to work here was to avoid seeing him, and then tonight I had to see him.
LEADMALE:Um, see who? Dean McCall and And the rest of those guys are jerks.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, what would you have done in this situation? Uh, what situation is that? What's going on? It's very complicated.
OTHERFEMALE:I was just explaining why I'm quitting.
OTHERMALE:You're quitting? I knew that.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have to quit, Karen? Yeah, I do.
LEADFEMALE:For the first time tonight, I really felt in control of my life.
SUPFEMALE:It's It's time for me to move on now.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm really gonna miss you, Karen.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so am I.
SUPFEMALE:We were gonna cut your hair next.
SUPFEMALE:You're leaving at just the right time, Karen.
SUPMALE:I want to thank you for, uh For helping me out tonight.
OTHERMALE:I'm just sorry for what happened.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, forget about it.
LEADMALE:Man, I don't belong in that fraternity any more than, uh Than you belong in this kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:You're right, but I'm here and I'm kinda hungry.
SUPMALE:Would you like me to boil some waffles to go with the ice cream? No! 
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Alex, will you give us a hand? The Lamaze class is gonna start any minute.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, I can't believe you guys are actually going through with this craziness.
LEADMALE:Nothing crazy about Lamaze, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's a method of natural childbirth.
LEADMALE:The husband assists the wife in the delivery room, and no anesthetic is used.
LEADMALE:See, now, that's crazy.
OTHERMALE:Look, the natural way to have a child, Mom, is for the man to be in the waiting room, smoking, pacing.
SUPMALE:And And the woman to be in the delivery room drugged out of her mind.
SUPFEMALE:You make it sound so attractive.
SUPMALE:I think when I have a baby, I wanna be unconscious.
LEADFEMALE:You're off to a good start.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Whoa, that must be the pregnant women, Dad.
LEADMALE:I can feel the house tilting a little.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
SUPMALE:I'm Steven Keaton.

OTHERMALE:They're all so young.
SUPMALE:That's true.
LEADFEMALE:Babies are young.
LEADMALE:No, I-I mean the people in the class.
LEADFEMALE:We're so much older than they are.
LEADFEMALE:So what? So maybe we're too old.
SUPMALE:Too old for what? To have a baby.
SUPMALE:Obviously not.
SUPFEMALE:You don't feel that way? No.
LEADMALE:So you have no sympathy and understanding for the way I feel about this? Not really, no.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, I know what you're going through.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going through the same thing myself.
LEADFEMALE:We're geezers.
LEADMALE:Well, what if we're geezers that are too old for natural childbirth? What if I can't manage this? Well, look, this isn't a contest.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, Elyse, you're the healthiest, strongest woman I know.
LEADMALE:And you're just as young and as beautiful as the day we met.
OTHERFEMALE:You're saying that to make me feel good.
OTHERFEMALE:It's working.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Elyse, we're training for this.

LEADMALE:Ah, you guys wouldn't understand.

OTHERFEMALE:How are ya, Steve? I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Okay, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:I think we should get started.
OTHERMALE:Now, if you remember, last week, we talked about the importance of a comfortable birthing position, remember? I call it nesting.
OTHERMALE:Now, what I'd like to do is have the birthing partners arrange the pillows on the mats for the mothers.
LEADFEMALE:Here, Donna.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Let me, uh Let me show you to your nest.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Whoa, this looks like a good area to build.
OTHERMALE:Uh, pardon me, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Is this area zoned for nests? Thank you, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:That's very sweet.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, not Not at all.
SUPFEMALE:Not at all.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:Elyse.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:What's going on? Why is he building nests? He's just being helpful, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:It's his first nest.
SUPFEMALE:Don't make him self-conscious.
LEADFEMALE:Extend your left hand.
OTHERMALE:Make a fist.
LEADMALE:Contract the muscles as you inhale.
SUPMALE:Hold it.
LEADFEMALE:Exhale and release.
SUPFEMALE:Now, partners, check the arms for relaxation.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm, uh I'm checking your arm for relaxation.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, do you mind? No.
LEADMALE:During this exercise, you should be giving your partner warm, supportive messages.
SUPFEMALE:I'm, uh very proud of you, Donna.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Dad.
LEADMALE:I love you too, Alex.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? Uh, Donna, listen, I've been thinking, uh, about what we were talking about the other day.
SUPFEMALE:You know, about, uh About you being, uh, alone and, uh, kinda scared.
LEADFEMALE:You have? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, uh I wanna be your birthing partner.
SUPMALE:What? We hardly know each other.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, what better way to get acquainted? We'll have a baby together.
LEADMALE:I don't understand how you're handling it well as you are.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not a problem.
SUPMALE:Alex is just experiencing the joy and exhilaration of fatherhood for the first time.
LEADMALE:It's a life experience we shouldn't deny him.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna deny him the experience of fatherhood.
LEADFEMALE:I just think he should actually be a father first.
SUPFEMALE:I think he's doing a wonderful thing for this girl.
SUPFEMALE:Now, haven't we always encouraged him to be helpful and supportive? He could send her a card.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Elyse, I just think this has gone too far.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't.
LEADMALE:Your 18-year-old son is touring Saint Vincent's Hospital with a pregnant woman at this very moment.
SUPMALE:You don't think it's gone too far? No.
SUPFEMALE:What's all that lumber doing in the garage? Oh, it's Alex's.
OTHERFEMALE:He's building a crib.
SUPFEMALE:A crib? Mom, if Alex is gonna be a father, does that mean I'm going to be an aunt? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, sort of.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:No, it doesn't.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Alex may not be much of a brother, but something tells me he's gonna make a pretty good father.
LEADMALE:He's not going to be a father.
LEADFEMALE:And you know, Jen, the The best part is that Alex will have someone around who's shorter than he is.
LEADMALE:For the first few years, anyway.
SUPMALE:Enough! Enough.
SUPMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:Go get Get ready for dinner.
LEADMALE:Steven, relax.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex will calm down once the initial thrill wears off.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, hello, hello.

LEADFEMALE:Hey, nice cow.
OTHERMALE:Come on, you guys.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna miss the beginning of the movie.
LEADFEMALE:I can't enjoy a movie unless I know who the director is.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, so, what are we gonna see? La guerre est finie.
OTHERMALE:I hate reading a movie.
LEADFEMALE:Moo! Dum, dum, dum, dum.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder who's at the door.
LEADMALE:I'll find out.
LEADMALE:Hi, Donna.
LEADMALE:Hi, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Uh, how you feeling? You, uh You gain any weight? Let's get the scale, check the charts.

OTHERFEMALE:I don't wanna weigh in today.
LEADMALE:Well, all right.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:See the cow I got? Oh, it's nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:But what if it's a girl? Well, if it's a girl, we'll, uh, go with the ducky.
SUPFEMALE:Hm.
LEADFEMALE:Ready to practice? Oh, yeah, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Donna, do you realize that sometime in the next six weeks, we are about to become parents? Well, that's not exactly true.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Okay, five weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Um, I was thinking about nursery schools.
SUPMALE:Now, I don't think we should send him to one that pushes academics, you know? Alex And A-and also, I was thinking that I'd really like him to grow up in this neighborhood, you know? I mean, come on, good enough for the old man, it's good enough for him.
SUPMALE:And And And I wanna take him to all the places that my folks took me when I was a kid.
LEADMALE:I can hardly wait to take him to the bank.
SUPMALE:Alex, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:You're talking about us like we're a family.
OTHERMALE:You're not about to become a father.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I know it's not my baby, okay? But that doesn't bother me.
SUPMALE:It really doesn't.
OTHERMALE:A- and I know it's not gonna be easy, but the three of us will make it through.
LEADMALE:Alex, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You're talking about us like we're a real couple, like we're gonna live together, like we're gonna get married or something.
SUPFEMALE:I hadn't thought about it that way, but, uh what the heck? Let's get married.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, we're not in love with each other.
OTHERMALE:We're in love with the idea of being a family.
LEADFEMALE:There's a big difference.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not for me, Donna.
LEADMALE:We've been playing house like a couple of kids.
LEADMALE:I'm the mommy, and you're the daddy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I got caught up in it too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look, can't you just get caught up in it again? No, I can't.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, you're very sweet, and I think it's so nice that you wanna help me, but our relationship's not based on anything real.
LEADFEMALE:So what? Alex, I think you're a wonderful person, and I care for you a lot.
SUPMALE:But we can't keep going on as if we're really gonna share our lives.
LEADMALE:Donna.
SUPFEMALE:This just can't work.
LEADMALE:Donna.
SUPMALE:Yes, Alex? That's my cow.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, Dad.
OTHERMALE:You see, the war was symbolic of Hi, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Where's Donna? She, uh She left.
SUPFEMALE:Symbolic of what, Jennifer? Don't leave me hanging.
LEADMALE:Of man's alienation from his own emotions.
SUPFEMALE:Can I play with your cow, Alex? Did you practice your Lamaze with Donna? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, uh Donna and I had a slight falling out.
LEADMALE:We're never seeing each other again.
LEADMALE:What happened? I'd rather not talk about it, okay? Come on, Alex.
SUPMALE:What happened? Mallory, it's personal, all right? Do you mind? Well, I tell you personal things all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? I told you I love Boy George.
SUPFEMALE:That's not personal.
LEADMALE:That's scary.
LEADFEMALE:That's the last time I open up to you, Alex.
LEADMALE:What happened, Alex? Well, Donna just said she doesn't feel the same way about me that I feel about her.
SUPFEMALE:She never has.
LEADFEMALE:How do you feel about her? Mom, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:She changed my life.
LEADFEMALE:She was almost the mother of my child.
LEADFEMALE:But how do you feel about her? I just told you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it It was so perfect.
LEADMALE:I mean I mean, it was a complete package.
LEADMALE:A great-looking girl, a baby Boom! Instant family.
LEADMALE:You know, it would have been all settled for me.
LEADMALE:I would have skipped all that stuff like, uh, meeting girls and dating.
LEADFEMALE:Falling in love.
LEADFEMALE:Most people look forward to the falling in love part.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, I'm not like most people, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:No argument there.
LEADMALE:No argument there.
LEADMALE:You know, Dad, this whole thing is your fault.
LEADMALE:If you, uh If you weren't such a great father, I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to become one.
LEADFEMALE:I meant well.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, and, uh And you make mothering look real good too, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Alex.
LEADMALE:I guess I just got carried away, huh? No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:It could've happen to no one else in the world.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, got some great stuff for the garage sale, Dad.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's terrific, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Nice to see you pitching in like this.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Dad, it's the least I could do.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, we gotta get this junk out of the house.
LEADFEMALE:We all have to make sacrifices.
SUPMALE:And I'm willing to do my part.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do you have there? Everything in Mallory's closet.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Jen, give me a hand with Mallory's bed.
SUPFEMALE:I hope Aunt Trudy and Mallory hurry up and get home.
SUPFEMALE:They've been gone for over three hours.
SUPMALE:That's no surprise.
LEADMALE:They have a great relationship.
SUPFEMALE:They always have.
SUPFEMALE:You know, in some ways, Mallory and Aunt Trudy are very much alike.
OTHERMALE:In that case, there's no chance they'll find their way home.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry we're late.
SUPFEMALE:We got lost.
OTHERMALE:We had the most wonderful time.
LEADMALE:What'd you do? We went to seeSwan Lake.
SUPMALE:Oh, Swan Lake.
LEADMALE:Dad, remember we used to go fishing I remember.
LEADMALE:I'm still picking the feathers out of my teeth.
LEADFEMALE:It's a ballet, you fools.
LEADMALE:It's a ballet.
LEADMALE:Oh! They're hopeless.
OTHERMALE:I've known that for a long time.
OTHERFEMALE:They pretend to be ignorant and they make the most smashing success of it.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's great to see you, Aunt Trudy.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, we wanna thank you for getting Mallory out of the house for a few hours every week.
SUPMALE:Hey, uh, how do you feel about her moving in with you? Be my pleasure, Alex.
LEADMALE:In fact, all three of you kids can move in.
SUPMALE:No, you see, that would be defeating the purpose.
LEADMALE:I want to get as much distance as I can between me and her.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Aunt Trudy.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, Skippy, you bring that over for the garage sale? Bring what over? The moose head.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Ssss.
LEADFEMALE:The ties are for the garage sale.
LEADMALE:The moose head was just to help me carry them over.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, Aunt Trudy.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to do better in school, but I can't ever seem to.
LEADFEMALE:How much did you study last night? Not at all.
LEADMALE:Why don't you try doubling that.
LEADFEMALE:There.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Whee.
SUPMALE:You know, I see a lot of myself in you, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:I have ever since you were a little girl.
LEADMALE:Really? Mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:And don't you worry about this school stuff.
LEADMALE:You're a very bright girl.
LEADFEMALE:And you're gonna be a late bloomer just like I was.
LEADMALE:I hope so.
LEADMALE:You know, whenever I try to concentrate on school, my mind drifts to other things.
LEADFEMALE:What other things? Boys.
SUPMALE:Oh, that'll change.
LEADMALE:Soon you'll drift to men.
SUPFEMALE:Did, uh? Did you used to date a lot, Aunt Trudy? I mean, before you were married.
LEADMALE:I had a date or two.
LEADFEMALE:What was it like? I mean, dating when you were a girl? Well, it wasn't all that different than it is today.
LEADMALE:He picked you up in his Packard, took you to see Tyrone Power at the movies, then out to the corner soda fountain, then you fought him off in the rumble seat.
SUPMALE:I guess some things never change.
SUPMALE:What else have you been doing with your life, besides boys? Um, well, I learnt a new dance step in my ballet class.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you show me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Aunt Trudy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Skippy.
LEADMALE:Where's Mallory? She just stepped out.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Trudy and I were just talking about you.
LEADMALE:Skippy, what are you doing here? I was showing Aunt Trudy some dance steps.
LEADMALE:Why were you doing them outside? Skippy, how can you be so stupid? Well Skippy isn't stupid, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not? No, of course not.
SUPFEMALE:You remind me of a dance student I had many years ago.
SUPFEMALE:He also used to march to his own drummer.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean? No.
SUPMALE:I don't have my own drummer.
LEADMALE:See what I mean? That dance student I just mentioned? Yeah? He turned out to be my husband.
LEADMALE:Don't even joke about that, Aunt Trudy.
LEADMALE:Aunt Trudy, how was Mallory as a dancer when she was a kid? Tell me everything.
LEADMALE:Well, Mallory was a great tap dancer, much better than Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dear.
OTHERMALE:Alex took tap dancing? He made me promise never to tell.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
LEADMALE:Well, what was he like? He was the worst dancer in the history of the human foot.
SUPMALE:Wow, this is the greatest news.
LEADMALE:I can't wait to use this.
SUPMALE:Mallory, you mustn't.
OTHERMALE:I gave my word.
LEADMALE:Oh, was he bad.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I won't say anything, but it's breaking my heart.
OTHERMALE:Skippy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, uh, I won't say anything either, Aunt Trudy.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:This is great.
LEADMALE:You and I are sharing a secret.
SUPFEMALE:Think of the knowing looks we can exchange.
LEADMALE:The whispers, the winks.
SUPMALE:Skippy, if I ever wink at you, it's only because I got a bug in my eye.
LEADFEMALE:Oh What's the matter, Aunt Trudy? Oh, I I'm all right.
OTHERFEMALE:I, uh Well, you don't look all right.
LEADMALE:Um, why don't I get you a drink of water or something.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just sit down here for a few minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh! Oh, as a matter of fact, I think I better sit down in a hospital.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:What's taking 'em so long? She's been in there over an hour.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'll find out.
LEADMALE:Uh, miss? I didn't find out everything, but I think I established a relationship that'll be useful to us later.
LEADMALE:Skippy, I'm scared.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's gonna be okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm scared about Aunt Trudy.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:She's a very special person.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Remember when I was a little kid and I used to come over to the house when she was visiting, and we'd play hide-and-seek? No one else would look for me.
SUPMALE:I remember what she used to say about you.
OTHERMALE:"That Skippy is one of a kind.
SUPMALE:" I hear that a lot.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but she meant it as a compliment.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, miss.
OTHERMALE:My aunt went in there about an hour ago, and I wanna know what's taking so long, okay? I wanna see a doctor.
SUPFEMALE:Miss, we've got two gunshot victims, three pregnant women, and a guy who swallowed a can of paint.

LEADMALE:Oh, I'll see what I can find out.
SUPMALE:Oh Oh, miss? We had the same conversation.
LEADMALE:Oh, how is she? Is she okay? I'm sorry, miss.
SUPFEMALE:We couldn't save her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I hope I bought enough food.
LEADMALE:It's hard to know how many people are going to pay condolence calls.
LEADFEMALE:Trudy had so many friends.
LEADFEMALE:There's plenty of food, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Someone else could die, we'd still have enough food.
SUPFEMALE:I love this kind with the pimento in it.
LEADMALE:Well, I wish your mother was in town.
LEADFEMALE:She knows more about entertaining than I do.
LEADMALE:Will you two stop talking about the food, please.
LEADMALE:Whoa.

LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Um, just nervous, and it just came out.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes, uh Sometimes a joke, even, uh, an inadvertent joke, can help ease the tension at a time like this.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear the one about the nun and the priest? Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton? I'm Reverend Wilson.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Reverend.
SUPMALE:Nice to meet you.
OTHERMALE:Please, let me offer my condolences to all of you.
LEADMALE:I'll be conducting the funeral services for the dearly departed.
LEADMALE:Reverend Wilson, Aunt Trudy was a very special person to all of us.
LEADMALE:Who? Aunt Trudy, the dearly departed.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:Please go on.
LEADMALE:What I was gonna say is that Aunt Trudy always loved singing and dancing.
SUPFEMALE:Um, music was everything to her.
LEADFEMALE:She even tried to teach me how to play the piano once, but I was so tone-deaf Tone-deaf.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
SUPMALE:I remember one day, I Uh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:I think we'll have to begin the service shortly.
SUPFEMALE:But I've hardly told you anything about Aunt Trudy.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll do the best I can.
SUPMALE:Mallory, we better sit down now.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, it's not fair.
SUPMALE:He never even met Aunt Trudy.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, I'm sure he'll handle it tactfully.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he seems like a decent guy, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Bit of a devil-may-care attitude about him, but I'm sure he'll come through.
LEADMALE:We should invite him to the garage sale.
OTHERMALE:We are gathered here today to say farewell to Gertrude Harris.
OTHERMALE:While I did not have the honor to know Gertrude, it's easy to see that she made many friends in this world.
SUPMALE:She was also dearly loved by her family, who referred to her affectionately as Aunt Gerty.
SUPFEMALE:Did you hear that, Dad? He called her Gerty.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody called her Gerty.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Gerty brought joy to many of us in this room.
LEADFEMALE:She was a very musical person, despite the handicap of being tone-deaf.
LEADFEMALE:She wasn't tone-deaf.
LEADMALE:I was.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:But as it happens to all of us, Aunt Gerty has passed on to a better world.
LEADMALE:No! Her name wasn't Aunt Gerty.
LEADMALE:It was Aunt Trudy.
LEADMALE:Mallory, sit down, please.
LEADMALE:And she wasn't just like everyone else, 'cause she was different.
LEADFEMALE:How can you talk about a woman you never even met? Mallory, come on, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:No, Dad! Nobody cares that Aunt Trudy's gone.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Alex is thinking about his garage sale, and the reverend can't remember her name.
LEADMALE:Uh, excuse us, Reverend.
LEADMALE:Mallory, I'm sure we all share your sense of grief at this moment.
SUPMALE:No, you don't! I was the closest with her.
LEADFEMALE:I shared secrets with Aunt Trudy that no one else even knew.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, how many of you knew she was a dancer? I knew that.
SUPFEMALE:And that she loved to teach and spend time with young people? I knew that.
SUPMALE:And how many of you knew that she used to fight off dates in a rumble seat? That I didn't know.
LEADFEMALE:All of you are just looking at your watches, trying to figure out what time you're gonnabe home, but I loved Trudy.
SUPFEMALE:She was the nicest person I'd ever known, and now she's gone, and I feel alone.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, don't you understand? My Aunt Trudy's dead.
SUPMALE:Honey, come on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I knew that.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:The funeral over? Yeah.
SUPMALE:You know, after, uh, you ran out, the minister invited other people to come up and say nice things about Trudy.
SUPMALE:The dentist talked about her teeth for half an hour.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna miss her, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:We're all gonna miss her.
OTHERMALE:She was really something, you know.
SUPMALE:I mean, she could make you say things a-and do things you never thought you would.
SUPMALE:You know, nobody in the world knows this, but, uh she once taught me how to tap-dance.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And I don't want to brag, but she said I showed a lot of potential.
SUPFEMALE:It's not gonna be the same.
LEADMALE:No, it's not.
SUPMALE:You'll be okay.
LEADMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I'll leave you alone.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Just, um Hi, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, if it makes you feel any better, after you left, the minister started calling her Aunt Trudy.
OTHERFEMALE:He started calling everyone Aunt Trudy.
SUPFEMALE:How are you? Um I'm okay.
LEADMALE:Dad, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:What happened back there? Okay, I was angry.
SUPFEMALE:I was angry at you for letting it go on like that and for not getting a better minister and for lettin' everyone tell jokes and stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, it didn't seem like anybody cared.
LEADFEMALE:People mourn in very different ways.
LEADMALE:Some people have to distance themselves.
SUPFEMALE:That's how they deal with it.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't mistake that for lack of love.
SUPMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I should have tried to distance myself a little, huh? Well, you were upset, you were angry, and you were sad.
LEADFEMALE:It's important to get those feelings out, rather than keep them inside.
LEADFEMALE:I sure got 'em out.
LEADFEMALE:You sure did.
LEADMALE:I I don't know anybody who's good at handling these things.
SUPFEMALE:I don't I don't deal that well with death myself.
LEADFEMALE:Funerals are usually your mother's area.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? Well, when you've been together as long as your mom and I have, you tend to divide the big emotional responsibilities.
LEADMALE:Your mother handles, uh, funerals, first dates and plumbing.
LEADMALE:I handle, uh, colds and flus, open school nights, and, uh, office supplies.
SUPMALE:Dad, where do you think Aunt Trudy is right now? She's probably still at the funeral home.
SUPFEMALE:You see, they No No, I I mean, where do you think she is right now? Someplace nice, someplace green.
SUPFEMALE:Someplace with a lot of music.
OTHERMALE:Do you believe in God, Dad? I do.
LEADFEMALE:I know I I don't talk about it very much, but I believe in God.
LEADMALE:Not in a fire and brimstone, hell and heaven God, but I believe in a higher spirit, something controlling the universe.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think God looks like? I always pictured him as looking like Cary Grant.
LEADMALE:And And he'd He'd see me and 
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Stevie, how are you? Tell me something about yourself.
LEADMALE:But of course, I know everything about you, don't I? I hope Aunt Trudy's with Cary Grant.
LEADMALE:She'd like that.
LEADMALE:I miss Aunt Trudy, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:We all do.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hm.
OTHERMALE:Um, I don't know how to let go of her.
LEADMALE:You don't You don't have to let go.
LEADMALE:Hold on to those memories.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead and cry.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
SUPMALE:But when you finish crying, I want you to do something.
LEADFEMALE:Um, what? Look, remember all the fun things about Aunt Trudy.
SUPMALE:Remember the happy times.
LEADMALE:And then, when you think of her, maybe you'll be able to smile.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE: Hi, how you doing, Alex? Ooh! That's gross.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Next time I'll go in the garage, okay? Mom, what's for dinner? Soy meal and hearts-of-palm casserole.
LEADMALE:Again? I'm glad we only have three meals a day.
OTHERMALE:Alex, you promised to go in the garage.
LEADMALE:Honey, you've got a fever.
SUPFEMALE:You should take some aspirin and go right to bed after dinner.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:It's just a cold, Mom.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I can't go to bed early.
LEADFEMALE:Gotta hand in my term paper on the Declaration of Independence tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna be up all night working on this.
LEADMALE:Alex, you're sick.
LEADMALE:I'm sure your professor will understand if you turn it in late.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mom can write your teacher a note like she does for me.
LEADMALE:A note.
LEADMALE:This is not a book report onOur Friend the Policeman.
OTHERFEMALE:It wasOur Friend the Fireman, and I got an A on it.
LEADMALE:I can't believe Skippy.
SUPMALE:He just called me up and asked me if I wanted to go to the Van Halen concert with him on Sunday.
LEADMALE:What'd you say? I asked him if he'd sell me the tickets so I could go with a normal guy.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
SUPMALE:Alex, what's all that stuff? This "stuff," Mallory, as you so eloquently refer to these items, are two great treasures of American history.
SUPMALE:This is the famous John Trumbull painting of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and this, Mallory This is the Declaration of Independence.
LEADFEMALE:How'dyouget it? This is not the original, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hon! Hi! I'm glad you're home.
OTHERMALE:Mmm.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse, Alex, you remember Ed Nelson, PBS in Washington.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Good to see you.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Alex, talk to your dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you'll have more luck than I did in convincing him to come to Washington tomorrow morning.
LEADMALE:Ed, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:We've been over this.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? There's some important congressional hearings tomorrow involving funding for public broadcasting, and, uh, we need your husband to testify.
LEADMALE:In front of Congress? Dad, theCongress? Ed, I am flattered by the offer, but I told you, there are a lot of important things going on here tomorrow, and I just can't get away.
OTHERMALE:Right, Elyse? What's going on tomorrow that's so important? Heh.
LEADFEMALE:That haircut appointment.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Dad, you can't pass this up.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, this is big.
LEADFEMALE:Destiny is calling you.
OTHERMALE:See? Oh, hey, Alex.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Dad.
OTHERMALE:I just came to get some juice for your mother.
LEADMALE:She couldn't sleep.
LEADFEMALE:How come? The baby kicking? No, I was.
LEADFEMALE:I've been tossing and turning.
LEADMALE:This Washington thing, it's really been on my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Dad, come on.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be great.
LEADFEMALE:All right, okay, picture it.
SUPFEMALE:You're in the conference room.
LEADFEMALE:It's jammed with reporters, okay? Hanging on your every word.
SUPFEMALE:Flashbulbs popping all over.
LEADMALE:The, uh, chairman bangs his gavel.
LEADFEMALE:"Ha, ha!" you laugh defiantly, refusing to be silenced.
LEADFEMALE:Slow down! Alex, there are other station managers who are experienced at this sort of thing.
LEADMALE:I'm just not in their league.
LEADMALE:Dad, look.
LEADFEMALE:A- at the Continental Congress in 1776, Thomas Jefferson was a young guy.
OTHERFEMALE:An unknown face in the crowd, a complete nobody, just like you.
SUPMALE:And, uh, when John Adams asked him to write the Declaration of Independence, he must've been a little overwhelmed, just like you are.
OTHERFEMALE:But he said yes.
LEADMALE:Thomas Jefferson was a great man, Alex.
LEADMALE:I'm not a great man, I'm Steven Keaton.
LEADMALE:Dad, Thomas Jefferson wasn't Thomas Jefferson until he was Thomas Jefferson.
OTHERMALE:You know? He didn't know he was gonna be Thomas Jefferson.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, one day he was Thomas Jefferson, and the next day, he was I know.
LEADFEMALE:Thomas Jefferson.
LEADMALE:Yeah! Look.
SUPMALE:Great events make great men.
LEADFEMALE:Thomas Jefferson say that? Uh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Idid.
SUPMALE:Heh.
SUPFEMALE:See, Dad, if If Thomas Jefferson had given in to his fears, if he hadn't written the Declaration of Independence, they would've got somebody else.
OTHERMALE:Somebody less brilliant.
LEADMALE:Somebody less eloquent.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and without this masterpiece, Dad, the revolution might never have succeeded.
LEADMALE:Hediddo a nice job on it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, it was Jefferson's destiny to write the Declaration of Independence.
LEADMALE:Just like it's your destiny to go to Washington and testify.
LEADMALE:How do you know so much about people's destiny? That'smydestiny.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I appreciate what you're saying.
LEADFEMALE:I I really do.
SUPMALE:But I'm just gonna have to go with my instincts on this one.
LEADMALE:I'm not going to testify.
LEADFEMALE:Dad No.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you in the morning, son.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Try to get some sleep.
LEADMALE:Alex.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Alex, wake up.
SUPMALE:We got a lot of work to do.
LEADMALE:What? What? We gotta clean up in here, and then we gotta go clean the stable.
SUPMALE:Stable? Stable? What are you talking about? Skippy? Skippy, what's going on? Aah! Why? Why am I wearing these clothes? If you weren't, you'd be naked.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Uh, Skippy, w- what date is it? It's July 3rd.
SUPMALE:July 3rd, what? It's July 3rd, sir.
LEADMALE:No, Skippy, wha? What year is it? Skip Oh.
LEADMALE:It's 1776.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
OTHERMALE:I'm not used to it, either.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm still writing 1775 on my checks.
OTHERFEMALE:Good day, Mr.
SUPMALE:Jefferson, sir.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Skipford.
LEADMALE:Oh, young boy Stable boy.
LEADMALE:Uh, me? I just saw my horse tied to the post outside.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I've asked you numerous times to please put him inside the stable when it rains.
SUPFEMALE:The rain can damage his coat.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Thomas, I'm glad you're still here.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hello, John.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Adams, sir.
LEADMALE:Thomas, I just did some informal polling of the other delegates, and I think the vote tomorrow is going to go our way.
LEADMALE:Independence from England! It'll be quite a day, John.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, it will.
SUPMALE:And the delegates also agree that you're the man to write the document which officially declares our independence from the king.
OTHERMALE:Will you do it? Skippy, pay attention.
LEADFEMALE:You are about to witness one of the greatest moments in the history of mankind.
LEADFEMALE:Never mind that.
LEADFEMALE:Betsy Ross' window shade is up.
LEADFEMALE:I am very honored to be asked to write this declaration, John, but my answer is no.
SUPMALE:Oh, come now, Thomas.
OTHERMALE:You're the finest writer amongst us and the most eloquent of thought, I daresay.
SUPFEMALE:Why, just the other day, you impressed us all so much with your talk about the natural rights of man, about liberty and self-government.
SUPFEMALE:That? That was nothing, John.
LEADMALE:I'd had a few glasses of ale, that's all.
LEADMALE:Come now, Thomas.
SUPFEMALE:This is no time for false modesty.
LEADMALE:I'm not being modest.
LEADMALE:I just have a lot to do tonight.
SUPMALE:I'm having my wig fluffed.
SUPFEMALE:What about John Hancock? He's very good.
SUPMALE:He writes in those nice big letters.
SUPMALE:Very easy to read.
SUPMALE:If you don't change your mind by morning, I'll ask him.
SUPMALE:Well, I think he's your man.
SUPMALE:Come on, John.
LEADFEMALE:I'll walk you to your horse.
LEADMALE:Wait Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Thomas Jefferson isn't gonna write the Declaration of Independence.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get busy.
OTHERMALE:Skippy, lookit, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:Without Jefferson's brilliance in that document, the revolution against England will fail.
LEADMALE:So what? I like England.
OTHERMALE:No, look.
SUPMALE:Skippy, uh I gotta do something.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, do you know where Jefferson lives? I live next door to the Jeffersons.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Take me there.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Uh-uh, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get me involved in this.
LEADMALE:I'm in enough trouble already for cracking that stupid bell.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Skippy the history of the nation, perhaps of mankind, depends on what we do in the next couple of hours.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hello there, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Jefferson.
LEADMALE:Skipford.
SUPFEMALE:Wipe your feet.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Uh This This is my friend Alex.

SUPFEMALE:He'd like to talk to Mr.
LEADMALE:Jefferson.
OTHERMALE:Alex.

OTHERMALE:Well, my husband's upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:Won't you come in and wait? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ooh.

LEADMALE:I happen to have a couple of tickets to the turkey shoot this Sunday.
LEADMALE:Are you interested? This very cute minuteman asked me today.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, this guy may be a minuteman, Mallory, but But someday you'll see.

LEADMALE:It's very important.
SUPMALE:Can't it wait until tomorrow? Dinner's ready, and I hate cold turtle and flummery pie.
OTHERMALE:Uh, no.
OTHERMALE:No, sir, it can't.
LEADFEMALE:Uh listen, you have to write the Declaration of Independence.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, only you can make it bold enough and And thought-provoking enough to convince the nation that the revolution is a just cause.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:And how does a stable boy such as yourself come to know so much of these matters? I'm a history buff.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, sir, look.
LEADFEMALE:I I know what you're thinking.
SUPFEMALE:Uh it's only natural that you'd be overwhelmed by this.
LEADMALE:I am not overwhelmed! I just have a lot to do.
LEADFEMALE:A good wig-fluffing takes time.
OTHERFEMALE:Destiny is calling you.
LEADMALE:Answer the call.
OTHERFEMALE:You are a great man.
LEADFEMALE:I am not a great man.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just a farmer from Virginia.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just Thomas Jefferson.
LEADMALE:What have I ever done that was great? Well, for one thing, you, uh You got your picture on the $2 bill.
SUPMALE:Uh, you see this will be the first thing.

LEADFEMALE:Well, I haven't yet, but I I will.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Mr.

SUPFEMALE:This is a big career move for you.
LEADFEMALE:Tom! Your dinner is on the table.

OTHERFEMALE:We hold these truths to be Self-evident.
LEADFEMALE:Self-evident.
OTHERFEMALE:We hold these truths to be Self-evident.
LEADFEMALE:Self-evident.
LEADFEMALE:Damn! What? Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the matter? I am stuck on this one phrase.
LEADMALE:We have the right to govern ourselves in order to protect our most fundamental human rights.
LEADMALE:The existence of these rights is so obvious as to not require any further justification.

LEADFEMALE:He looks forward to this every year.
SUPFEMALE:He sees that working together down at the station is one of the few family things we still do together.
LEADMALE:What do you want to talk to him about? I don't want to do it anymore.
LEADMALE:Alex.
SUPMALE:I mean, we do it every year, and it's so boring.
OTHERFEMALE:Stuffing envelopes, answering phone calls, running all those errands.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey, Mallory, let's not forget end of the 
LEADMALE:family portrait time.

LEADMALE:And we're happy to be part of WKS family.
LEADFEMALE:## WKS, you're the one ## I- I don't believe you kids.
OTHERMALE:Now, that is one of the nicest parts of the program.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mom, it's not fair, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he always assumes we're gonna do it every year, and never asks if we want to.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mom, we've cooperated with him on this thing for ten years.
LEADFEMALE:All we want is a year off.
SUPFEMALE:I'm with them, Mom.
LEADMALE:Would you talk to Dad for us? No, I won't.
LEADFEMALE:I think your attitudes are terrible.
LEADMALE:And if you don't want to do it, then you have to tell him.
SUPMALE:## WKS, you're the one ## Hey! Good morning, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Heh-hey.
LEADMALE:Well, today's the big day.
LEADFEMALE:Pledge week begins.
LEADFEMALE:Could it have been just a year ago that we had one? It's not possible.
LEADMALE:To me, of course, the most thrilling part of pledge week is that final day, when we have family-portrait time.
SUPMALE:There I'll be surrounded by the ones I love, heh, all there to support me in front of thousands of people.
LEADMALE:Oh, it sends a chill up my neck just thinking about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Say, Dad? Yeah, Alex.
LEADMALE:Uh a- about pledge week.
LEADFEMALE:You're excited, huh? Oh, excited doesn't cover it, Dad.
LEADMALE:Uh, listen, we We were thinking that Well, that is Um Mallory has something she wants to talk to you about.

LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:And the kids probably feel a little funny about your doing it.
LEADMALE:Don't lay it on us, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Mom, I can't think of anything a teenaged girl would like more than for her mother to sing in public.
OTHERMALE:Well, if your father thinks I shouldn't do it, well then I won't do it.
SUPMALE:Elyse, I wouldloveto have to you sing.
LEADMALE:Do you mean that? Do I mean it? Heh.

LEADMALE:That's their way of saying, "Call a plumber, call a plumber.
SUPMALE:" You really think I need a plumber? Dad, it's the plumber.
SUPMALE:It's ringing.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:It goes against my principles of self-reliance, but obviously, you all want me to hire a plumber, and this is pledge week.
LEADMALE:This week we're pulling together as a family, right? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, Gus, have you seen my kids? They should be here by now.
LEADFEMALE:No, I haven't seen 'em.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, the audiences all like Jackie.
LEADMALE:They feel comfortable with him.
OTHERFEMALE:They know all his jokes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, at least Jackie Jackerman's a professional.
LEADMALE:You know? You know, some of those other PBS stations, all they do is put on friends and relatives.
OTHERFEMALE:That's That's true.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, Elyse.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here, Elyse? You gonna help us answer the phones? I've come to rehearse my number.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:Uh, just treat me like any other singer.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, absolutely.
LEADMALE:Hey, Larry.
SUPMALE:We want to do a sound check on the boss' wife.
OTHERMALE:I'll be very professional, Steven.
OTHERMALE:## Hmmm ## Oh, oh, Steven, I forgot to say, I got in touch with that plumber, and he's coming to the house later today.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
OTHERMALE:That's a nice intro.
SUPFEMALE:## Believe me ## ## If all those Endearing young charms ## ## That I gaze on So fondly today ## ## Were to fade by tomorrow ## ## And fleet in my arms ## Okay, that's great.
SUPFEMALE:That is great.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's just beautiful, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Just beautiful.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I'll work on that note, Steven.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:Everything is going to be fine.
LEADFEMALE:You're here, I'm here.
OTHERMALE:The kids are here, working hard.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Ha, ha, okay.
SUPMALE:Well, I feel terrible, Judy.
LEADMALE:Lost all your money on the first hand.
LEADFEMALE:But, uh, that's all right, you can forget about that IOU.
LEADMALE:That's a nice watch, Judy.
SUPFEMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand it, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:The kids used to love pledge week so much.
LEADMALE:Today they were bored out of their minds.
OTHERMALE:Why would you say that? They were busy working on the phones.
SUPMALE:They were calling each other.
LEADFEMALE:Look, they really don't want to participate in pledge week, do they? I wouldn't say that.
SUPMALE:You know, Steven maybe it's not a question of whether they want to participate or not.
SUPMALE:May Oh, never mind.
OTHERMALE:No, no, w-what is it? No, I shouldn't say anything, in case I'm wrong.
LEADFEMALE:You're not wrong.
OTHERMALE:How do you know? You're never wrong about this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if I am wrong, it's better left unsaid.
LEADFEMALE:But if you're right, I'll never know if you don't tell me.
OTHERMALE:That's true.
LEADMALE:So tell me.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'm wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Now Now, this is just my opinion, but maybe the kids simply resent the fact that you never ask them if they wanted to help during pledge week.
SUPMALE:You just assumed.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure if you presented them with a choice, that they would say yes.
SUPMALE:Elyse, you're right.
LEADMALE:I was unfair.
OTHERMALE:Oh, this is great.
LEADMALE:It is? Of course.
SUPMALE:Now I know what the problem was.
OTHERMALE:I was insensitive, I was a fool.
LEADMALE:I was a jerk.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Bud.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Haven't seen you folks for a while.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh, I've been, uh, doing a lot of the plumbing repairs myself, Bud.
LEADFEMALE:Great! Maybe I'll get that new van I've been looking for.
LEADMALE:Uh, listen, Bud, you're not gonna charge extra because it's nighttime, are you? Well, let me put it to you this way.
SUPFEMALE:The time it took you to ask me that question just cost you $8.
LEADMALE:40.
SUPMALE:Hi, Bud.
SUPMALE:Oh, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:My little helper.
SUPFEMALE:How have you been? Great.
LEADFEMALE:My, how you've grown.

LEADFEMALE:I'm not a wealthy man.
SUPMALE:Uh.
SUPMALE:Bud, uh, the problem is in the upstairs bathroom.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Oh, kids.
SUPMALE:Uh, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I made a mistake the other night, and I want to apologize for it.
LEADMALE:I was wrong to just assume you wanted to participate in pledge week.
SUPFEMALE:You have your own lives.
SUPMALE:Just because something's important to me doesn't mean it has to be important to you.
SUPFEMALE:So let me say right now, if you want to participate, that is great.
OTHERFEMALE:But if you don't, that's fine too.
LEADFEMALE:So what do you say? Uh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Dad you're unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I mean, that is very sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what other father would approach it that way? Probably lots of fathers.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, come on, Dad, I'm not so sure now.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Francine Wilcox wanted me to study with her this Saturday, and, uh, now I can.

LEADMALE:Maybe I was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is it.
LEADMALE:The big night.
LEADFEMALE:Finish your speech? Uh, yeah.

OTHERMALE:"Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Steven Keaton, manager of WKS.
LEADMALE:"You've already met my wife, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess you can tell we have no children.
LEADFEMALE:" I have to get something out of the truck, but I think I'm zeroing in on our problem upstairs.
LEADMALE:Bud, you keep saying that.
OTHERFEMALE:Every day you fix something, the next day you're back.
SUPMALE:Why, you getting tired of seeing me? I'm tired of paying to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton, if I worked for free, you wouldn't respect me.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Getting ready to go down to the station? Yup, we're all set.
LEADMALE:We haven't seen much of you guys this week.

SUPFEMALE:Listen, Jennifer and Mallory and I have something we want to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we've been thinking about it, uh, all week and we decided that, uh Hey, this is a big day for you.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Alex.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I had a feeling you'd come around.
SUPFEMALE:After all, if something is important to one member of the family, it should be important to all of us.
OTHERMALE:Absolutely.
SUPMALE:Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, that's why we wanted to give you that.
LEADMALE:"Good luck.
LEADMALE:" Yeah.

SUPFEMALE:It's a thrill for us to honor our Dad since this is such a special night for him.
LEADMALE:Now, that's sweet.
SUPMALE:Those kids must really love their dad.
SUPFEMALE:I sure loved my dad.
LEADMALE:Beautiful man.
SUPFEMALE:I sure miss him.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, my dad was a plumber.
LEADMALE:Taught me all I know.
LEADFEMALE:I used to go watch my dad work when I was so small I could hardly carry a plunger.
LEADFEMALE:If it wasn't for my dad, I don't know who I'd be today.
LEADFEMALE:But that's what dads are for.
LEADMALE:So tell me how come you kids aren't down there? Uh We're kind of busy, Bud.
SUPFEMALE:But I've worked in all kinds of places.
LEADFEMALE:I worked in one club that was so tough, they had a sign that said, "Thank you for spitting.
LEADFEMALE:" Is this thing on? Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Testing, one, two, three.
LEADFEMALE:Testing.
LEADFEMALE:Woo.
OTHERMALE:Bad news, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:We've only got about $10,000 in pledges.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, that's down $40,000 from last year.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand it.
SUPFEMALE:Why aren't people giving this year? But you know, eh-heh, PBS is very educational.
LEADMALE:In fact, from watching it, I learned how to spell PBS.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe he's almost finished.
LEADMALE:And if I was anywhere else in the world, people would try to stop me from talking.
LEADMALE:Of course, they do that here too.
LEADMALE:Huh.
LEADFEMALE:God bless you all.
LEADMALE:I love you.
SUPFEMALE:Stay real.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:That was Jackie Jackerman.
LEADMALE:Well, you've already met, uh, several of the WKS families.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce my wife, Elyse Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse? Thank you, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, I'm Elyse Keaton.
SUPMALE:I- I'd like to reassure the audience that the fact that I'm married to this man here has nothing to do with the fact that I'm singing later on.
OTHERMALE:I I'd like to reassure them, but, uh it's not true.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Elyse these times when we meet the WKS families are always my favorite moments.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, uh, my kids can't be here tonight, but just a few hours ago, before we left the house, those beautiful kids gave me this.
OTHERFEMALE:Paul, can you zoom in on this? It says "good luck.
LEADFEMALE:" And then on the inside they wrote, "Have a great time!" Can you believe that? "Jennifer," she's my youngest.
SUPFEMALE:"Mallory," she's my 16-year-old.
LEADMALE:And "APK," that stands for Alex P.
OTHERMALE:Keaton, my son.
OTHERMALE:Well, uh I don't have to tell you how proud I am of this card.

SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:That ceiling has to be opened up.
SUPFEMALE:The pressure's gonna keep on building, and the whole ceiling's gonna fall down.
SUPMALE:Bud, you have already bled me dry.
SUPMALE:I'm not paying you one more cent.

SUPMALE:Time for an empirical demonstration of sensory influences on infants.
LEADMALE:See what I mean? What are you doing with that stuff, Alex? Well, Mom, I just wanna make sure that Andrew has all the proper influences.
SUPFEMALE:The earlier he gets started, the better athlete he's gonna be.
LEADMALE:Yo, Andy, listen up.
LEADFEMALE:This big guy is a football.
SUPFEMALE:This is what America is all about.
OTHERMALE:Teamwork, competition, shaving points, bone-crushing tackles, playing in pain, spitting blood.
SUPMALE:That's enough baby talk, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Dad? He promised to take me to Chrissie's today.
LEADMALE:He'll be back in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:He went to get the baby pictures developed.

LEADFEMALE:Steven, that'll be the fifth time you've picked him up since midnight.
LEADMALE:Elyse, he's crying.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, we've been through this before.
SUPMALE:If you pick Andrew up every time he cries, he's never gonna stop crying.
LEADMALE:Does that mean when he's 30, he'll still cry in his crib? Not if we bring him up right.
LEADMALE:Elyse, how can you be so cruel? He's only been alone for four minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Four minutes is a big chunk of his life, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:We're not gonna spoil this baby, Steven.
SUPMALE:Come on, let's go back to bed.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, has this kid got lungs.
LEADFEMALE:Andrew, Andrew.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse! Oh! Where you going? I was gonna straighten this picture.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse.
LEADMALE:Well, he's still crying, honey.
LEADMALE:I thought you didn't want to spoil him.
LEADMALE:I don't, but I can't bear to hear him cry.
LEADFEMALE:He stopped crying.
LEADMALE:Hm.
LEADMALE:Is Andrew up again? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:We can't get him to go to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, maybe we should sing to him.
LEADMALE:Dad, we want him to sleep, not try and escape.
LEADFEMALE:We should try singing.
LEADFEMALE:We should try anything.
LEADMALE:I've got to get to sleep.
LEADMALE:We'll sing, we'll sing.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:What are we gonna sing? Something for a baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, do you know "Let's Get Crazy" by Prince? It was our wedding song.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:No, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not singing anything by Prince.
SUPFEMALE:Come on! I'm tired, let's just! ## Down by the old millstream ## ## Where I first met you ## ## You were 16 ## ## You were 16 ## ## My village queen ## ## My village queen ## ## Down by the old ## ## Millstream ## Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Look, we can work this out.
SUPMALE:We can work it out.
SUPFEMALE:I know we can.
LEADMALE:Now, what has stopped him from crying so far? When we went in there to sing, he stopped crying.
LEADMALE:Go in there to sing, stopped crying.
SUPMALE:When I brought him out here before, he stopped crying.
SUPMALE:Bring him out here, stopped cry Okay, I've got it.

LEADMALE:What are we gonna do? Shh, shh.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Okay.
OTHERMALE:Take it easy.

SUPMALE:Don't you wake up, boy.
SUPMALE:Little baby.
LEADFEMALE:## Down by the old mill ## ## stream ## Nice try, Dad.
LEADMALE:What's going on out here? Andrew's having trouble sleeping.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, so am I, and I have to get up early to finish the homework that he ruined.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, we're doing the best we can.
LEADMALE:I have to get to sleep! But Andrew's just a baby.
LEADMALE:He's not keeping you up on purpose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm not so sure.
SUPMALE:You know, I live here too! Why can't you understand that? All you ever think about is yourself! I hate you! I wish Mom and Dad never had you! Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, the French toast is up.
LEADFEMALE:Come and get it.
LEADMALE:Uh maybe you could, uh, bring it over here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sure thing, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Elyse.
LEADMALE:Elyse? Hmm.
LEADMALE:Elyse Huh? French toast.
SUPFEMALE:Vive la France! No, Elyse, not a French toast.
OTHERMALE:French toast.
LEADMALE:You might as well You might as well eat it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't reach it.
LEADMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey, honey, maybe you should take a sip of this coffee.
SUPFEMALE:Um, Mallory made it.
OTHERMALE:I think it'll perk you up.
SUPMALE:Whoa! I used five times the regular amount of beans.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Jennifer? Oh, I saw her upstairs before.
LEADFEMALE:She looked pretty upset.
LEADMALE:She thinks we've forgotten about her.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:We haven't forgotten about her.
LEADMALE:As soon as, uh mmm Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Jennifer gets down here, we're going to have a talk with her.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you ask me, I think she's showing all the classic symptoms of regression syndrome.
LEADFEMALE:You know, in order to compete with Andy, she's acting much younger than she really is.
LEADMALE:Did Alex regress when I was born? Well, let's see, he was 2 Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:For a couple of weeks, he refused to tie his own tie.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder if I'll regress at all now that Andrew's born.
LEADMALE:You're at ground zero now, Mallory.
LEADMALE:You regress any more, you're gonna disappear.
OTHERFEMALE:We have a problem and we're gonna have to deal with it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, face the facts, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:When one has a baby late in life, there's a tendency to become obsessed with said infant.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, I don't think we're obsessed with said infant.
LEADMALE:What do you think, Steven? Steven? Good morning, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi, Jenny.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you feeling? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Um, Jennifer, I- let's discuss what happened last night.
LEADFEMALE:What happened last night? When you got mad and yelled at the baby.
SUPMALE:Oh, that.
OTHERMALE:I was just tired, that's all.
OTHERMALE:I'll see you guys later.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go eat breakfast over at Chrissie's house.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Very interesting.
LEADFEMALE:She's a fascinating subject, isn't she? She's not a subject.
LEADMALE:She's your sister.
SUPMALE:Look, I'm just trying to keep a detached professionalism about this, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Hate to admit it, but maybe Alex has a point.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she didn't even peek at Andrew when she came in here.
LEADFEMALE:All right, well, when she comes home today, then we'll just sit her down and have a talk.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't know, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:This whole thing could blow over.
LEADFEMALE:We could do more harm than good by having a whole big discussion about it.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely.
LEADMALE:All that's required here is a gesture of love.
SUPMALE:Slip her 100 bucks.
LEADMALE:You can't show love by giving someone money.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, give her leg warmers.
SUPMALE:Yeah, maybe we should pay more attention to her.
LEADMALE:You Make her feel more special.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Remember how she felt when we threw her that big birthday party? Maybe we could do something like that.
LEADMALE:Make her feel good again.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:We can.
SUPFEMALE:Let's give her a special night tonight.
LEADMALE:She can plan the whole evening.
LEADMALE:We'll have whatever she wants for dinner, we'll play games, it'll be fun for all of us.
LEADMALE:Keep 100 bucks handy, though, just in case.
LEADMALE:Mom, this cake is great.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I know you always like triple- layered chocolate-chip cake with double-fudge frosting.
LEADMALE:You know, I feel kind of funny about everybody making such a fuss over me tonight.
SUPMALE:Want us to stop? Nope.
LEADMALE:I'm loving it.
LEADMALE:It's our pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:Is there anything special you want to do after dessert? Let's play charades.

LEADMALE:Of course it didn't.
LEADFEMALE:The baby started smiling, then laughing.

SUPMALE:You were? Sure.
LEADMALE:You know, I got tired of hearing about how cute you were and how much fun you were to play with.
LEADMALE:How'd you get over it? Well, pretty soon I realized that you were cute and that you were fun to play with.

OTHERFEMALE:The car dealers close in an hour.
LEADMALE:What kind of car you thinking of buying? A sports car.
SUPFEMALE:A station wagon.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, the whole reason for buying a new car is to have more room for the baby.
LEADMALE:What would be the point of buying a sports car? I'd look great in one.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mallory, they'd be crazy to let you drive the new car, anyway.
LEADMALE:I happen to be a good driver, Alex.

LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jarrett, I saw a shortcut.
SUPMALE:We were on a tandem bike.
LEADFEMALE:And so basically, what we offer is a biweekly tutorial on those subjects you're not performing up to your top standards in.

SUPMALE:It does zero to 100 in two seconds.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, I don't like buying a car that requires a parachute to slow down.
LEADMALE:I heard the Wagonmaster's a real nice car, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it is a beauty, James.
LEADFEMALE:The salesman says it seats eight comfortably and, uh, ten uncomfortably.

LEADFEMALE:Robin.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.

LEADFEMALE:Right! Robin! Alex, let's be honest with each other.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's safe to say that Robin is a girl that one might consider to be attractive.
OTHERMALE:Really? Yeah, okay, now that you mention it, I I can see how one might find her attractive Sensuous Incredibly erotic.
LEADFEMALE:Though, personally, I hadn't noticed.
SUPMALE:I hadn't either, but, you know, if two guys are trying to run a business and they were to compete over something like, say, a girl Oh, pfft! It could destroy the whole foundation of their partnership.
LEADMALE:Of course it could, so, uh So they shouldn't compete.

OTHERMALE:Well, I brought my economics and my poetry books.
LEADFEMALE:Who's gonna tutor me first? I am.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it doesn't matter to me.
LEADFEMALE:All I know is that when I study, whatever I do last stays with me best.
LEADFEMALE:Then, uh Then do poetry first.
SUPFEMALE:Do poetry, take your time.
LEADMALE:I'll be, uh, back in, what, roughly 40 minutes.
LEADMALE:James, that is really funny.
OTHERMALE:See, I bet you never thought that Aleksandr Pushkin was such an amusing poet.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, but I always suspected it.
LEADFEMALE:Forty minutes.
SUPMALE:Time's up.
LEADMALE:Alex, that could not have been 40 minutes.
SUPMALE:You guys run a tight ship here.
OTHERFEMALE:Evidently, though we seem to be a little lacking in professional courtesy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm professional, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:I don't giggle when I tutor.
LEADFEMALE:You know, James is really wonderful.
SUPMALE:He is? He is one of the brightest and most interesting people I've met since I've been at Leland.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, uh Yeah.
SUPMALE:He does make a good first impression, in a superficial sort of way.
OTHERFEMALE:Although I-I think you'll find that I'm pretty bright and amusing in my own right, only with more depth.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure I will.
LEADMALE:Uh, uh, Robin, uh would you like to go out with me tomorrow night? That's really nice of you to ask, Alex, but James already invited me to a poetry reading tomorrow night.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe him! Great! Great.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Alex, can I use the phone in the other room? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Go Go ahead.
LEADMALE:Forgot a book.
OTHERMALE:How could you? I just forgot it, that's all.
LEADMALE:Nah, nah, nah.
LEADMALE:You forgot more than a book.
LEADMALE:You forgot our agreement.
LEADMALE:You asked her out! And so did you! How did you know? I was listening at the door.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:How dare you.
LEADMALE:That's it, Jarrett.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Our partnership is over.
OTHERFEMALE:Suits me just fine.

LEADMALE:" Dad, how much longer do we have to do this? There's only one more section to go.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:"Your trunk and welcome to it.
OTHERMALE:" Oh, Steven! Dad! Dad! That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:I cannot handle it anymore.
LEADMALE:Now, where are you going? Thought I'd drive the new car over to Chrissie's house.
SUPMALE:Oh, she's kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Ohlbeck! She got the new Panther Turbo.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:I specifically set aside this time to play with the baby, and he's asleep.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mom, I love that kid, but he's inconsiderate.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you've been in a bad mood all day.
SUPMALE:What's your problem? It's you, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Nah, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It's not you.
OTHERFEMALE:It was just a reflex.
LEADMALE:It's James.
SUPMALE:What happened? Oh, Dad, you're not gonna believe this when you hear it.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, are you ready for this? He invited Robin Green to a poetry reading.
SUPFEMALE:And he always seemed so nice.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, Dad, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:You see, she's one of our tutees.
SUPMALE:Who's your other T? Ah Anyway You see, James and I are both attracted to this girl.
LEADMALE:So we made a gentleman's agreement not to ask her out.
SUPFEMALE:Why? It's obvious, Elyse, without such a contract, they might compete for her and destroy their friendship in the process.
SUPFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:They should be stronger than that.
SUPMALE:Well, Elyse, the male ego is a very fragile thing.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's stupid.
LEADMALE:I'm hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm surprised that James would do such a thing.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, me too, but he did.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now, how did you find out about this? Well, because, uh, she told me when I asked her out for tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if you asked her out, then you are just as guilty as James.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not true, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I only asked her out because I suspected that James had asked her out, which he had.
LEADFEMALE:I- it was entirely a defensive move on my part.
SUPFEMALE:And had we gone out, it It would have been purely a A preemptive tactical date.
SUPMALE:How romantic.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, no way! I'm tired.
OTHERMALE:I don't wanna play now.
LEADMALE:Coming, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, uh, Mallory, listen.
LEADMALE:You gotta help me out with something.
LEADFEMALE:You're, uh, sort of a girl.
SUPFEMALE:James and I are both attracted to the same girl.
LEADMALE:Now, what would you do if you had two good-looking, intelligent guys interested in you? What's that got to do with you and James? Come on, Mallory.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Look, if a guy was interested in me, I'd wanna know about it.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Look, all you can do is express how you feel.
LEADMALE:And if you and Robin are meant to be together, it'll happen naturally.
OTHERFEMALE:Just be yourself.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:See, that's a That's a very sensitive, perceptive point, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:I read it inCosmopolitan.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, well! Robin, James.
LEADFEMALE:What a surprise.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I never miss a poetry reading.
LEADFEMALE:I have season tickets.
LEADMALE:May I have your attention, please.
OTHERMALE:This evening, the poetry club is pleased to have with us the Horace Newton award-winner for poetry, Zane Axelrod.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Axelrod is one of the best, the most incomprehensible poets of his generation.
SUPMALE:Where are the chairs? Just sit on the floor, Alex.
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:The floor.
LEADMALE:Bohemians.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Axelrod.
OTHERMALE:"The Nuclear Holocaust and You," a Christmas poem.
SUPMALE:Intercontinental ballistic missiles, assembled in the silos of our soul, multiple warheads.
LEADMALE:The fragments of our unfulfillment.
SUPMALE:Boom! Boom! Boom! Bomb shelters Whatever happened to "Hickory Dickory Dock"? Shh! This is art, Alex, something you obviously know nothing about.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Don't, uh Don't Don't pretend to be Mr.
SUPMALE:Culture.
LEADFEMALE:You're only here for one reason, and you know it.
SUPMALE:Born pure and tarnished by distrust, or born tarnished, searching for a shine? Boom.
OTHERMALE:Boom.
SUPMALE:Sha-boom.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you'd be so low as to just barge in on my date.
OTHERMALE:Ah! A date! A date.
LEADFEMALE:So you admit it's a date.
LEADMALE:I admit nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you get lost, Keaton.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? Who's gonna make me? I am! No, I am.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, this is a private discussion, so, uh, you want to just stick to your stupid poetry? Oh, yeah? Well, I'm rubber and you're glue.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.
LEADFEMALE:This guy's good.
LEADFEMALE:What is it with you two? A few weeks ago, you seemed so mature.
OTHERFEMALE:And now you've turned into a couple of third graders.
LEADMALE:He did first! Oh, did not! Look, Robin, we both obviously like you a lot, and I think the ball is in your court now.
LEADMALE:Look, Robin, you can settle this whole thing right now by just saying which one of us you like better.
SUPFEMALE:I never had the chance to find out! I hardly know either of you, and And all of a sudden I'm in the middle of some kind of tug of war.
LEADMALE:I don't enjoy being the object of some adolescent competition, and until the two of you grow up, I don't want to spend any more time with either of you.
LEADFEMALE:I still haven't got the baby seat in.
LEADMALE:I wanna swing by the hardware store and get an acetylene torch and a power wrench.
LEADMALE:I have to take out the back seat.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, that's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Bet we wouldn't have this problem with the Maserati.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Alex, I'm glad you're here.
LEADFEMALE:We need the Volvo to go shopping.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dad, uh, still hasn't figured out the new car yet, huh? You got it.
LEADMALE:All set, let's go.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex, he, uh Andrew needs to be changed.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Wa No! Mom, Mom, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Don't do this to me, Mom! I've only had one lesson, Mom All right.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Andy, it's just you and me.
OTHERFEMALE:Bear with me.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:I know this seems like a great deal to you, but, uh you know, you're gonna have to give it up sooner or later.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Just try and stay in that position.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's you.
LEADMALE:What do you want? I just came by to pick up some of my books.
LEADFEMALE:Well, come in and get 'em.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm gardening.
SUPFEMALE:What does it look like I'm doing? I'm changing Andrew.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Need any help? No, I don't need any help.
LEADMALE:I am perfectly capable Could you, uh, hold this leg and, uh, grab a diaper? How could you bust up my date like that? Aw, hey! You shouldn't have been on that date in the first place.
LEADMALE:Gimme the powder.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's the powder, and you shouldn't have asked her out either.
LEADMALE:Hey, I only asked her out because I knew you were gonna ask her out, which you did.
LEADMALE:Pins.
SUPFEMALE:And I only asked her out because I knew you were going to.
LEADMALE:And you did.
LEADMALE:Here are the pins.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, uh, thanks to you, I made a fool of myself.
SUPFEMALE:I made a fool out of myself too.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, uh all done here.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't look right.
LEADMALE:No, let's try again.
SUPMALE:You know, Alex, when I left the poetry reading, I took a walk down Foxwood Road past the Little League field.
LEADFEMALE:Remember that team we used to play on? Wilson's House of Fine Lingerie? We had the nicest uniforms in the league.
SUPFEMALE:Lace cuffs.
LEADFEMALE:See-through jerseys.
LEADMALE:When I was standing there, I thought of all the stuff we've been through 
LEADFEMALE:all the Cub Scout meetings, the camping trips, the low-interest loans you've given me.
OTHERMALE:We're supposed to be friends, Alex.
LEADMALE:Why are we always competing? Competition is the backbone of our relationship, James.
LEADMALE:I mean, we just push each other to do better.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, okay.
LEADMALE:Moment of truth.
SUPMALE:You want to put your finger right there? Here? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:And got it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Okay.

LEADMALE:"We'll keep your grades high " "And your babies dry.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I know, he's so cute.
OTHERMALE:Do you really think he likes me? Look, Jennifer, please, get off the phone, okay? I was staring at him all through lunch.
LEADFEMALE:He caught me looking at him through a piece of Swiss cheese.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, that's adorable.
LEADFEMALE:Get off the phone, or I'll force-feed you the receiver.
SUPMALE:Don't force-feed her the receiver, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Just kidding, Dad.
LEADMALE:Where's your mother? She's upstairs with the baby.
SUPFEMALE:I'm home, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:Ready to go? I'm coming.
SUPFEMALE:Do you really think he's too shy to ask me? Or maybe I should ask him? I'm askin' you.
SUPFEMALE:Please get off the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:Jen Almost finished, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:So, anyway, let me tell you everything that happened.
LEADMALE:Sounds like she's wrapping it up.

OTHERMALE:We're taking Andy to see his first sunset.

OTHERFEMALE:He's been talkin' about it all day.
LEADFEMALE:Do you wanna come with us to see the sunset? No, thanks.
OTHERMALE:I don't know, I've gone this long without seein' one.
LEADMALE:Aw, listen to him.
LEADFEMALE:What does he know? Hi.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mallory, I got to admit, Jennifer has gotten even more aggravating than you are.
LEADMALE:I know, but he's got a great personality.
SUPMALE:Got a nice style, still not perfect though.
SUPFEMALE:Now, see how she's cradling the receiver? Her hand will cramp any minute now.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mallory, you're wearin' my shirt.
LEADMALE:I am? Yeah, you are.

LEADMALE:Hey, morning, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Guess you didn't get much sleep, huh? Thought I heard Andrew cryin' all night.
LEADMALE:Alex, I slept fine from 3 to 3:15.
LEADMALE:Otherwise, I'd be grumpy.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm sorry for having worn your shirt and in order to make it up to you I'm gonna wash it, okay? No, no! Mallory, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, look, you don't even know how to use the washing machine.
LEADMALE:I do so.
SUPMALE:Look, "Before using this machine, "make sure it's been grounded to avoid possible electric shock.
LEADMALE:" Show me how to do that, Alex.
LEADMALE:Don't tempt me, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you goin', Mom? Well, Andrew hasn't been outside for a week because of his cold, so I thought I'd take him on a walk before dark.
LEADMALE:But it's 8 in the morning.
SUPMALE:Well, then I have no problem.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I want to ask Adam to the dance, Chrissie, but what if he says no? Well, then what if he says yes? All right, Jennifer, your time's up.

LEADMALE:If you hurry, you can catch 'em.
LEADMALE:Well, I can certainly catch him.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Where's the baby? Oh, I put him down for a nap.
LEADMALE:I thought you went out for a walk.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Andrew and I got as far as the front sidewalk and decided we weren't alert enough to be out on the streets.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but Dad just went out to find you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he'll be back.
LEADMALE:Uh look after Andrew for me, will you, honey? Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see her out there anywhere.

LEADFEMALE:He just went upstairs to look for you.
SUPFEMALE:I'll meet him up there, then.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse! I'm getting too old to play these games, Elyse.
LEADMALE:I guess I was just in a playful mood.
OTHERMALE:Surprise.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm off till 3:00.
LEADMALE:Today? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I thought we could spend a few hours getting reacquainted.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, yeah, as long as you don't mind getting reacquainted in front of Paul and Barbara Esposito.
LEADMALE:Well, that'll be fine.
LEADMALE:Who are they? Well, I-I'm designing a guesthouse for them.
LEADMALE:I promised I'd bring by their plans this afternoon.
LEADMALE:Well How about now? We could just sit around and talk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sweetheart, I have got to go back to sleep.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll come with you.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you'll talk in your sleep.
LEADFEMALE:How about tonight? I'm not doing anything.
LEADMALE:We could get together and go over old times.
SUPMALE:I can't think of any flaws in that plan.
SUPMALE:I'll see you tonight.

LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:So how was your day? Well, let's see.
LEADMALE:First, the Espositos decided they don't want a guesthouse, they want a greenhouse.
OTHERMALE:Seems they have more plants than friends.
OTHERMALE:Then Then I came home, and Alex and Mallory were still arguing about some shirt, and And Jennifer was on this six-hour phone-athon with Chrissie.
SUPFEMALE:I think the high point of my day was when Andrew spit up on me.
LEADMALE:Well, at least we're alone now.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, it's just so nice to have a quiet moment with you.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, yes, she is.

OTHERMALE:I just have to find that out.
LEADMALE:Is there some reason why you can't find that out downstairs? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Chrissie, call me right back, okay? I'm getting a lot of static on this end.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.

OTHERMALE:See, we each have careers which take up a lot of our time and energy, and we have three children who are very wonderful, but, uh, who are also very loud and demanding.
SUPFEMALE:And on top of that, we have a baby who is, uh, very beautiful, but also very loud and demanding and who occupies every last moment of our remaining time and energy.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight we tried to escape all that.
LEADFEMALE:And? It's impossible.
SUPFEMALE:That's encouraging.
SUPMALE:But it's true, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Uh, we can, uh, remove ourselves physically from all this, but, uh But not emotionally.
LEADFEMALE:This is our life.
SUPFEMALE:We're trapped in it.
OTHERMALE:You make it sound like a science-fiction film.
LEADFEMALE:It's not such a bad life, is it? No, it's not.
SUPFEMALE:It's a great life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:I-I think we just have to accept the fact that our life has changed, that we're parents.
OTHERMALE:We have fo Four children, and we enjoy it.
SUPFEMALE:And we're not gonna have any fun till Andrew goes to college.
LEADFEMALE:I accept that.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I just wanted to apologize for talking on the phone so much lately.
SUPMALE:It's okay, honey.
OTHERMALE:For some reason, I find myself talking about boys a lot more than I used to.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I find myself talking to boys a lot more than I used to.
LEADMALE:We've noticed.
SUPMALE:I'm sure it's just a phase.
SUPFEMALE:It'll pass.
SUPMALE:I'm not getting that.
LEADMALE:Uh, if it's for me, tell whoever it is that I'll see him at school tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Well, no.
LEADMALE:No, I'm sorry, Adam Dad, no! Hi, uh, Adam? Uh, can I call you right back? Okay.
SUPMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:This is the last phone call I will ever make in my whole life.
LEADMALE:Please? Thanks.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:How you doin'? Oh, not bad.
LEADMALE:Not bad.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we know you guys haven't been able to spend a lot of time together and that we're probably part of the reason why not.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:So, uh, we just wanted to say we're sorry, and, you know, all that stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Apology accepted, and all that stuff.
SUPFEMALE:And if Andrew cries tonight, we'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:If, uh If Andrew cries tonight, Mallory will take care of it.
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:It's too quiet, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Let's enjoy this.
OTHERMALE:This is what we wanted, isn't it? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want to do? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What do you want to do? Well, I have a vague recollection of you and me being in bed together.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, that.
SUPFEMALE:I think I remember.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we're falling asleep, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:We're definitely falling asleep.
LEADFEMALE:I knew there had to be a catch.
LEADMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:I love you too, honey.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I got a problem.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, you've narrowed it down to one? Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:You know I have to do that paper on the Louisiana Purchase.
SUPMALE:I thought it was about shopping in Louisiana.
SUPFEMALE:Can you help me out? Mallory, you know that I'm I'm willing to help those less fortunate than myself, and you certainly fall into that category.
LEADMALE:But, uh, we gotta go to Grandma's in a few minutes.
SUPFEMALE:So catch me when I got a spare decade.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I wish we could just go straight to Grandma's.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish we could talk Mom and Dad out of going to their Lamaze reunion.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think so, Jen.
LEADMALE:But they said we're just gonna stay for a few minutes.
SUPMALE:I am as anxious as you are to get to Grandma's.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I-I love that woman.
LEADMALE:We got a very special relationship.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't wait to go to her house.
LEADMALE:That's only because Lisa Tobin lives next door to Grandma.
LEADMALE:I have no interest Anyway, Jen, you're only anxious to get to Grandma's 'cause she's got cable TV.
SUPMALE:That's not true.
SUPFEMALE:I love Grandma.
LEADMALE:If she happens to have 136 channels, so be it.
LEADMALE:Okay, everyone, we're ready to go.
SUPFEMALE:We have everything! Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Pictures of the baby, the baby's diapers, the baby's seat, the baby's food.
LEADMALE:Where's the baby? Well, he should be along any moment.
LEADMALE:I better go hurry him up.
LEADMALE:Mom, you'll be sure to tell Grandma why I can't come? Now, you sure you don't wanna come with us? No, I'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Mom, we better get going, huh? I don't want to disappoint Lisa Grandma.
LEADMALE:Can't we just go straight to Grandma's? Do we have to go to this reunion? We don't have to go, we want to.
SUPFEMALE:We have a lot in common with these people.
SUPMALE:We went through natural childbirth classes with them.
SUPMALE:Your father and I are really looking forward to it.
OTHERMALE:Elyse, do we really have to go to this reunion? Why don't we just go to your mother's? We'll have a great time, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, let's go.
OTHERMALE:Uh, Mal, you're sure you'll be okay? I'll be fine.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we're very proud of you for putting your schoolwork first.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Your pursuit of passing grades, no matter how futile, is entirely commendable.
LEADFEMALE:And to reward you, I'm gonna let you use the Alex P.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton archives, located in the Alex P.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton trunk in the, uh, Alex P.
LEADMALE:Keaton basement.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Let's go! Have a great time.

LEADFEMALE:Lisa? Who's Lisa? "Contrary to popular belief, the Louisiana Purchase is not about shopping in Louisiana.
LEADFEMALE:" Hi.
LEADMALE:I, uh, came in the back door.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd surprise you.
LEADMALE:Are you surprised? Skippy, what do you want? Someone to talk to.
OTHERMALE:A friendly face.

OTHERMALE:And as soon as you bring it up here, you got to leave.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Mal.
LEADMALE:I knew you'd come around.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, is it yucky in here.
SUPMALE:Look at all these cobwebs.
LEADMALE:These, uh, webs, they remind me of the web that you've spun around my heart, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Uh, let's get the trunk.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:What's in here? Uh, it's just Alex's old papers.
LEADFEMALE:He must have used heavy ink.
SUPMALE:What's going on? Open the door.
SUPFEMALE:I'm trying, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Well, just reach around and flip the latch.
LEADFEMALE:What latch? You mean, you shut the door all the way? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Is that bad? Oh, Skippy, we're locked down here now.
LEADFEMALE:And my family's out all day, and then they're staying overnight at my grandmother's! You mean, we're gonna be locked down here all night? Yes! Darn the luck.

SUPFEMALE:Hi, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's good to see you again, Alex, I'm glad you could come.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no problem.

SUPMALE:We have cable TV too.
SUPMALE:Really? Len, Leonard, Len, do you, uh Do you by any chance get, uh, Channel 31? ThePlayboychannel! Ah Yes, we do! Aha.
SUPMALE:Is that what that is? I thought it was religious programming.

LEADFEMALE:We could be back in two hours.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't be ridiculous, Suzie.
SUPFEMALE:We're already here, without Larry Jr.

SUPFEMALE:Don't worry about that, Skippy.
SUPFEMALE:Just keep going.
SUPFEMALE:Ugh! No, Mallory, it's no use.
LEADFEMALE:Do you happen to have any explosives on you? I can't believe that we're locked in the basement.
LEADFEMALE:We could run out of air.
LEADMALE:Well try not to think of it as a basement.
LEADMALE:Think of this as a dungeon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay, I feel better now.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I have been sent by the noble house of Handleman to rescue you.
LEADFEMALE:See, you're the beautiful damsel in distress.
LEADFEMALE:And I am a knight.
OTHERFEMALE:You are an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what about that window? It leads to the backyard, doesn't it? Yeah, it's nailed shut.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least no one can break in.
OTHERFEMALE:We're stranded here and no one's gonna be here till the morning.
LEADFEMALE:We don't even have anything to eat! Oh, but that's where you're wrong, Mallory.
SUPMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:What is that? It's a package of Cup-a-Soup.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, you're a real dope.
OTHERMALE:Where's the cup? Right here.
SUPMALE:Where's the hot water? I never tried it that way.
SUPFEMALE:Well, well, well.
SUPFEMALE:What do we have here, huh? A hot-water heater.

LEADMALE:All right, uh Stand back.
LEADMALE:This is my first wet cup of Cup-a-Soup.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see here.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, if you want my professional opinion, I busted it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great, now we have no heat! Well, uh, don't worry now.
LEADMALE:It's, uh It's probably just a fuse.
SUPMALE:Fuse? Do you know anything about fuses? Are you kidding? Mallory, they don't call me Handy Handleman for nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, stand back.
LEADMALE:Let's see here.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh, ah, here's the culprit.
SUPFEMALE:Here's the culprit.
LEADFEMALE:Ah! Uh-oh.
LEADMALE:Nice going, Handy.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we've got no heat and no light.
LEADFEMALE:But we've got each other, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Help! I- I've almost got this figured out.
SUPMALE:All I need is one more thing.
SUPMALE:What? An electrician.
LEADMALE:Here, let me Let me take a look at it.
LEADMALE:See, if this were my hair dryer, what would I do? You'd be drying your hair with a fuse box.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, what if I took this one out of here Uh, Mallory, I I wouldn't do that! Don't.
LEADFEMALE:and put it into here.
LEADMALE:That's very nice.
LEADFEMALE:We can see each other again.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so grateful.
OTHERMALE:Skippy, look, the only way we're gonna get out of here is the window.
LEADMALE:There must be some way to open it.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, let me, uh, have a look at it now.
LEADFEMALE:Move this.
LEADMALE:Stand back.
SUPMALE:Mallory, this may be the last time we ever see each other.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Here I go.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, okay.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I got it open.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, there's plenty of snow here if we need it.
LEADMALE:There.
SUPMALE:Can you get out, Skippy? No, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:There's no way I can fit through the bars.
LEADMALE:Maybe if I buttered myself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Oh, great! Now the window's stuck open.
LEADMALE:We're gonna freeze to death! What are we doing? Jumping jacks.
LEADMALE:Oh, good idea.
LEADFEMALE:It's very important that we be in top physical condition when we die.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, I'm just trying to keep warm.
SUPFEMALE:Where you going? What are you doing? Why Ow! Ah! Ooh! What's wrong? Ooh! It's my ankle.
SUPMALE:It's It's an old Cub Scout injury.

LEADFEMALE:Right when you need me the most.
OTHERFEMALE:Skippy, just relax.
LEADFEMALE:I can't relax, Mallory.
SUPMALE:I'm supposed to be your knight.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I've got to find something to keep my damsel warm.
LEADMALE:There's gotta be something What? What did you say was in this trunk? Uh, it's just Alex's old junk.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, there are clothes in here.
LEADMALE:We can put them on and be warm.
LEADMALE:Oh, great, Skippy.
LEADMALE:Nice going.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't thank me.
SUPFEMALE:That's what us knights are for.
LEADFEMALE:It's too bad the babies are still asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder if Larry Jr.
SUPFEMALE:is asleep.
LEADFEMALE:He looks so cute when he's sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, Suzie? Well, you know, it It is great getting together like this.
OTHERFEMALE:I I was just, uh, saying to Elyse on the drive over here that we really don't know each other that well.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mean that she and I don't know each other that well.
LEADFEMALE:I I, uh, meant all of us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:That's true, you know, during the Lamaze classes, we didn't have much of a chance to socialize, but But now we can just sit back and relax and talk.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Hey, and talk about something other than babies.
OTHERFEMALE:What a relief.
OTHERMALE:Finally.
LEADMALE:So, what'd you guys think of that election? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy, we're pretty upset, let me tell you.
SUPFEMALE:Who wants another four years with that guy? We think he's doing a fine job.
SUPMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:I, uh Well, I don't follow politics.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Then why did you bring it up, Larry? Oh, I was just trying to make conversation.
LEADMALE:I mean, let's face it, this party's dying.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure this goes on this way? I'm positive.
SUPFEMALE:Well I certainly am warm now, huh? We're lucky that your parents like to get dressed up like chipmunks.
LEADMALE:Skippy, I told you it was for a Halloween party.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a good thing they didn't go as nudists.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe this.
SUPMALE:I don't mind freezing to death half as much as the thought of being found looking like this.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm looking for something to eat.
LEADFEMALE:I have a sudden craving for chestnuts.
LEADMALE:"My Summer Vacation by Alex P.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, "age 6.
LEADFEMALE:"This summer, I went to the zoo.
LEADMALE:"It only cost 50 cents because I am a minor.
SUPMALE:"It cost my parents $1 because they are majors.
SUPFEMALE:"One day, I'd like to run the zoo and charge $2 to get in with no discounts for anybody.
LEADMALE:" Maybe we could warm up by setting this on fire.
SUPMALE:Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:That Alex! I Ouch! Ah! What is it? It's my ankle again.
LEADMALE:It really hurts.
SUPMALE:Mallory, I think I'm gonna need an ankle transplant.
SUPMALE:Why don't you sit down or something.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I, uh, didn't know you were so highly-trained for medical emergencies.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you put some ice on it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Um which paw is it? This one.
SUPMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:How's that? Much better.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mallory, you'd make a good veterinarian.
LEADFEMALE:Fat chance of me ever being anything important.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're not exactly dressed for success.
SUPMALE:What's that? I- I found it in Alex's trunk.
SUPFEMALE:It's a picture of your 7th birthday party.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Here, take a look at this.
SUPMALE:There's your parents, and there's Alex, and there's Jennifer, and there's me.
LEADMALE:Where am I? You're the one in the corner sticking your tongue out at me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I remember that party.
SUPMALE:You had to leave early 'cause you swallowed a party favor.
LEADMALE:Oh, we've had a lot of good times, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, a lot of water under the bridge.
LEADMALE:I- I know what you mean.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I guess we all consider you kind of an honorary Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:You mean it? Yeah, I'm used to you, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Even though you're very annoying, when you're not around, I kind of miss you.
OTHERFEMALE:You do? I didn't know that.
SUPFEMALE:I- I I always feel like an outsider, wherever I am.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't know what I'm talking about, would you? Well, don't be so sure.
LEADFEMALE:See, sometimes I don't feel like I belong anywhere.
LEADMALE:You know, Alex is real smart, and Jennifer is great at sports.
LEADFEMALE:Andrew's cute, and I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm nothing special.
LEADMALE:I'm I'm just me.
LEADMALE:Mallory, you got to be kidding.
LEADMALE:I mean, you are the most special person in the whole world.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Skippy.
OTHERFEMALE:You're kind of special in your own way.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, because of this kiss, I shall never wash my face again.
LEADMALE:Then you'll never be kissed again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Steven, come on.
LEADFEMALE:They're down here in the basement.
LEADFEMALE:Let's try to imagine what series of events led to this point.
OTHERMALE:I'd rather not, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank God you're home! Honey.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? W Oh, we came down here to get Alex's trunk, and Skippy shut the door and locked us in.
SUPMALE:And then the heater broke, we almost froze to death.
LEADMALE:Aren't you gonna ask us how our day was? Skippy, wake up.
LEADMALE:Oh Oh, you should have let me sleep.
SUPFEMALE:I was having the nicest dream.
SUPFEMALE:I dreamt that I was in this big barrel of macadamia nuts.
SUPFEMALE:Let Let me a-ask you kids something.
LEADFEMALE:Were you in chipmunk costumes when you came down here, or No, no, Dad, we found them down here.
SUPFEMALE:We put them on to keep warm.
SUPMALE:We almost froze to death.
LEADMALE:Mallory, you'll do anything to get out of writing a paper.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! You shut the door! Yeah, why? Well, that's how we got stuck in here.
LEADMALE:It locks automatically.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no, it doesn't.
OTHERMALE:All you do is this, and you're out.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Before hunting season starts.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know.
SUPFEMALE:I know this was a terrible night for you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it wasn't so bad.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:You're one of the few artists working today who does justice to "Snugly, Buggly Baby.
LEADFEMALE:" Why, thank you.
OTHERMALE:You and Mick Jagger.
LEADFEMALE:Anything in the mail? Yeah, a letter from my mom.
SUPMALE:How's she doing? A little better.
LEADMALE:She's thinking about putting the house up for sale.
SUPFEMALE:Well, she's lived there alone for six months now, and that neighborhood's getting worse.
OTHERFEMALE:She wants me to come out and help her with it.
SUPMALE:You know, uh, help settle Dad's affairs, the house, investments.
LEADFEMALE:I still can't get used to it, you know? I don't have a dad anymore.
LEADMALE:You have his memories.
LEADFEMALE:He was a wonderful man, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:Come with me to Buffalo, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Do you really have to go? I thought Robert would take care of that.
LEADMALE:You know my brother.
SUPMALE:I'm afraid to leave anything to him.
LEADFEMALE:How can you say that? He's your brother.
LEADFEMALE:I know he's my brother, but he's not to be trusted.
LEADMALE:I'm sure I told you about the incident.
LEADMALE:What incident? The incident with the baseball cards.
LEADMALE:He took my Joe DiMaggio.
LEADMALE:That was 30 years ago.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be 34 years in April.
SUPMALE:When do you think you'll go? I don't know if I can handle all these memories without you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess I'd better go.
LEADMALE:I think the kids should come.
SUPFEMALE:You know, we've all been affected by his death.
SUPMALE:The The kids lost a grandfather.
LEADFEMALE:I- I really think it's changed them.
LEADFEMALE:It's brought them closer together.
LEADFEMALE:You did too! I think your mind has finally snapped, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Alex took my record.
SUPFEMALE:Alex took Mallory's record.
LEADFEMALE:They They couldn't be closer.

SUPMALE:Andrew too.
LEADFEMALE:He's an adorable baby.
LEADFEMALE:He looks just like your father.
LEADFEMALE:Does he, Ma? Exactly like Jake.
LEADFEMALE:Of course his name isn't exactly like Jake.
OTHERMALE:Have you noticed? I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Mom, there's something I wanna ask you.
SUPFEMALE:Ask.
LEADFEMALE:It's about me and Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Did he ever talk to you about things I said? What kind of things? Well, let's face it, Dad and I had our differences and I was wondering if, after I moved out of the house, if he ever said anything.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I remember he said "Let's make Stevie's room into a den.
LEADMALE:" I'm talking about May, it's Josephine Farmer for you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Keep that thought.
SUPMALE:I'll be right back.

LEADFEMALE:" So how are you feeling? You okay? I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Then eat your oatmeal.
LEADFEMALE:Too hot.
LEADFEMALE:Want me to blow on it? Nah, I'm not hungry.
SUPMALE:Being here just brought it all back.
LEADMALE:My dad, the problems, the fights.
LEADMALE:Steven, I think you're making too much out of all this.
LEADMALE:You weren't here.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know what went on.
LEADMALE:My father was a very difficult man.
SUPFEMALE:Talking about Pop? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Good man.
SUPFEMALE:Hard-working.
LEADMALE:Dependable.
LEADMALE:Salt of the earth.
LEADMALE:Like me.
LEADFEMALE:Dad always liked you, Rob.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? Me and 
SUPFEMALE:"Woosh.
SUPFEMALE:" You and 
OTHERMALE:"Woosh.
LEADMALE:" Oh, come on, Rob.
LEADFEMALE:He drove Dad crazy.
SUPMALE:Dad could not believe Stevie.
LEADMALE:Oh, you remember the time he got that letter asking him to come in to school because you refused? Oh, hey, come on here.
SUPFEMALE:You kids oughta hear.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Come on Oh, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:I was just gonna tell 'em about how your grandpa Jake had to go in to school because your father got in trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do, Dad? It was nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Rob Your father refused to put his name in the upper-right-hand corner of his test papers in school.
SUPFEMALE:Is that true, Dad? It was my paper and I thought I had a right to put my name wherever I wanted to.
LEADMALE:Oh, I remember, Dad got a hold of you.
LEADMALE:You remember, Stevie? He said, "Are you from this planet or what?" I, uh I don't I don't see what's so funny.
LEADFEMALE:Papers need to be graded, Dad.
LEADMALE:All those names have to be in the same place, every time.
LEADMALE:I mean, that was deviant behavior, and I hope Grandpa Jake punished you appropriately.
SUPMALE:I was tarred and feathered.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Thought you could use some refreshment.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's great, Elyse.
SUPMALE:I can definitely use something.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you know? You have been sitting here six hours.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of ghosts here, Elyse.
LEADMALE:A lot of ghosts.
LEADFEMALE:Friendly ones, I hope.
LEADFEMALE:Did I ever tell you about Mr.
SUPMALE:and Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kretzer? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:They were this beautiful older couple from Austria.
LEADMALE:They lost their only son in the war and they kind of adopted me.
LEADMALE:I used to pass their house on my walk home from school, and she always had some cookies, some cakes for me.
SUPFEMALE:"Ve must to fatten you up, Stevie," she would say.
LEADMALE:Guess she'd be disappointed if she saw me now, huh? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think anyone who saw you now would be disappointed.
LEADMALE:I didn't realize how special they were, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Sometimes I'd stop in to see them.
SUPMALE:Sometimes I'd forget.
LEADFEMALE:It took so little for me to make them happy.
SUPFEMALE:I was so thoughtless about it.
SUPMALE:Why didn't I realize? You were 10.
SUPFEMALE:It won't come again, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:The Kretzers, that whole generation.
LEADMALE:What they did.
LEADFEMALE:To come to a new land.
OTHERFEMALE:They didn't speak the language.
LEADMALE:They built a life.
SUPFEMALE:They were heroes, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Every last one of 'em.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't find the time to have a glass of milk with them.
LEADMALE:Steven, stop it.
SUPFEMALE:You were a kid.
LEADFEMALE:Kids don't think about things like that.
LEADMALE:The world will last forever.
LEADFEMALE:It'll never change.
SUPMALE:You'll always be 10.
LEADMALE:They'll always be 75.
LEADMALE:They'd be 109 now, I guess.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I should give them a call.
LEADFEMALE:They're probably not up.
LEADFEMALE:A lot of ghosts here, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Let's go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:You go.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be up in a minute.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Don't forget to eat your cookies, okay? Okay.
SUPMALE:"We must to fatten you up.
LEADFEMALE:" Tsk.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Robert.
LEADFEMALE:They're going to be here soon.
SUPMALE:I hope I made enough food.
LEADMALE:You made enough.
OTHERMALE:Did it start yet? Not yet.
LEADMALE:I saved you some supper.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, go wash your hands.
LEADMALE:I can't eat, Mom.
LEADMALE:I'm too excited.
SUPMALE:Don't you realize we have television in the house? So now that we have television, you're never gonna eat again? You delivered all your papers? Sure, Pop.
OTHERFEMALE:And you collected all your money too, huh? Well Did you or didn't you? I got most of it, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:It's not important.
LEADMALE:Money's important.
SUPFEMALE:It's very important.
SUPMALE:Why do you think I press clothes 16 hours a day? I like steam? I know money's important, Dad, but other things are important too.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? People should be able to read the paper, especially old people, when it's all they have.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Minelli didn't pay again, huh? No, but she said she'd pay me Next week.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:She showed me pictures of her and Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Minelli back in Italy.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Those are very valuable.
LEADMALE:I understand with ten of those pictures, you can get a car.
OTHERFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna put it right down here and I want you to finish everything.
LEADFEMALE:I can't eat it now, Mom.
LEADMALE:I'll miss Milton Berle.
LEADMALE:Well, you can eat while you watch.
OTHERMALE:I'll laugh too much.
OTHERMALE:I'll choke.
SUPFEMALE:Let's live dangerously.
OTHERMALE:Mm.
OTHERMALE:This is too hot.
OTHERMALE:I'll cool it off for you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it's gotta be time now.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome.
LEADMALE:Welcome.
SUPMALE:Is it time yet, Jake? Two minutes, Kretzer.
LEADFEMALE:Here, Stevie.
SUPFEMALE:I brought you some sugar cookies.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Kretzer.
LEADMALE:You don't come to see us anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know, I'm kind of busy with school and my paper route and everything.
LEADMALE:Well, how long does it take, hm? You come in, you have a glass of milk and a piece of cake, hm? Believe him, Esther.
LEADFEMALE:He's busy.
LEADFEMALE:Next time, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kretzer.
LEADFEMALE:I promise.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're such a sweet boy, Stevie.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello, Esther, Rudolf.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hello, there.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, May.
SUPMALE:Now, here, Steven.
LEADMALE:I cooled it off for you.
SUPFEMALE:It's too cold now, Mom.
LEADMALE:Do you believe this boy? Eat something, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Ve must to fatten you up.
LEADFEMALE:Is this Milton Berle? Uh, not yet, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Kretzer.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Sarah.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Sarah.
LEADMALE:How are you doing? Find your seat.
OTHERFEMALE:Find a good chair.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Find a good spot.
SUPFEMALE:Couch is spoken for.
OTHERMALE:Hup.
OTHERMALE:It's starting.

OTHERFEMALE:Milton Berle.
LEADFEMALE:That's him.
LEADFEMALE:That's Uncle Miltie.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening Good evening.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure it's "Uncle" Miltie? We had an uncle like this.
SUPFEMALE:We don't talk about him.
LEADFEMALE:I lost my sheep.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like you lost your shape.
LEADMALE:This is Monty Woolley and Joseph Cotten.
OTHERFEMALE:Say hi to the audience.
OTHERMALE:No ad-libbing, or you'll be in Lana Turner's sweater in a few weeks.
LEADMALE:These were up awful late last night.
SUPMALE:They were counting people.
SUPMALE:It, uh They were counting people.
SUPMALE:Is there any out here? I knew it.
SUPMALE:Aren't they adorable? Would you do me a favor? Have somebody come out and take these two talent scouts back to Arthur Godfrey, please.
LEADFEMALE:Little Boy Blue, thank you very much.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't I see you flying over New York with "Goodyear" printed over you? Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to welcome you.
LEADMALE:And kiddies, this is your Uncle Miltie again.
OTHERFEMALE:We have a surprise, ladies and gentlemen Steven.
LEADFEMALE:You're still up.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:It's late.
OTHERMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:I love you very much.
SUPFEMALE:You know that.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I know.
SUPFEMALE:But it's good to hear.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it took an hour of singing and rocking, but I finally got Andrew to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Let him cry, Elyse.
SUPMALE:You don't wanna spoil him.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, he's in a new place.
LEADMALE:I think he's a little nervous.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't believe in over-coddling our children.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Well, that's funny because Mom said that you spoiled Dad so much that by the time she got him, he was I'll go check on Andrew.
SUPMALE:Anyway, uh, you want me to put these boxes in the hallway? I don't think I spoiled Steven.
LEADFEMALE:I- I don't think I actually used the word "spoiled," May.
SUPMALE:Uh, anyway, it was mostly in the area of food.
OTHERFEMALE:What kind of food? I- It was nothing.
OTHERMALE:You know, we can organize these boxes by size How did I spoil him with food? Okay, come on, break it up, you two.
LEADMALE:Break it up.
LEADFEMALE:Look, it's all right for Grandma to spoil one of her children.
OTHERMALE:Mom spoiled me.
LEADFEMALE:It's only natural.
LEADMALE:I'm her I'm her favorite.
LEADMALE:That's not true, Alex.
SUPMALE:Don't Don't try to hide it, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:It's It's only natural.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh, Darwin.
OTHERFEMALE:Survival of the cutest.
LEADFEMALE:Who's this Darwin guy, a friend of yours? I don't have any favorites, Alex.
LEADMALE:That's okay, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all right.
LEADMALE:You don't wanna talk in front of the M-A-L.
SUPFEMALE:That's okay.
SUPFEMALE:This guy, number one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we have an offer.
SUPMALE:You have an offer on the house? Yeah, have it here, Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Looks real good.
OTHERMALE:I don't know how good it looks.
SUPFEMALE:Take it easy, Steve.
SUPMALE:Well, did you get the price you asked for? Very close.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what's the problem, then? Well, I'm thinking maybe we can get more.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Robert.
LEADMALE:We've been through this.
SUPFEMALE:That's a fair price.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not so sure it's a fair price.
LEADFEMALE:I happen to have some expertise in the real estate area, don't forget.
LEADFEMALE:What expertise? Maureen.
LEADFEMALE:My wife.
LEADFEMALE:Her father was a realtor.
LEADMALE:So, what does that make you, a realtor-in-law? Go ahead, make fun.
LEADFEMALE:But if Dad were here, he would agree with me.
LEADFEMALE:He would say, "Let's get our price.
SUPFEMALE:" He would, and you know it.
LEADMALE:And he'd be wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Dad was always wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I was always wrong.
SUPMALE:Everyone was always wrong, Steve, except you.
LEADFEMALE:You're wrong, Rob.
SUPFEMALE:That's not what I said.
LEADMALE:Now, boys, stop it.
LEADMALE:What is wrong with holding out for a few more dollars? I mean, why is getting more money a sin? It's just not the right time, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:This is not an easy time for Ma.
LEADFEMALE:The faster we get it over with, the better.
OTHERMALE:It's worth a few dollars to save her that aggravation.
LEADFEMALE:All I know is Dad sweated for 40 years to pay off this house.
LEADMALE:I am not letting it go without fighting for every penny.
LEADMALE:Robert.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Rob, this isn't gonna be one of your special deals, you hear me? What's wrong with you? Can't you see you're upsetting Ma? Mom's all right.
LEADFEMALE:You're the problem.
LEADMALE:You haven't changed, Steven.
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Emotional.
LEADMALE:Mom's upset, so let's get her out of here today.
LEADMALE:This minute.
LEADMALE:Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:Never mind we're getting taken in the deal.
LEADMALE:Why don't we just give the house away? Hey! Who wants a free house? What I said makes sense.
OTHERFEMALE:This is a painful time for Ma.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get it over with.
LEADFEMALE:She belongs at the Oaks.
OTHERFEMALE:All her friends are there.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get her there.
LEADMALE:She'll get there.
LEADMALE:There's no big rush.
OTHERMALE:It's simple math, something you were never too terrific at.
SUPFEMALE:If we keep the house on the market, we get a lot more.
SUPMALE:What does "more" mean? She doesn't need more, she needs out.
LEADMALE:You're wrong.
LEADMALE:If we take this price, Mom goes to the Oaks, we're going to run out of money that much sooner.
LEADFEMALE:Then how are we going to support her? We'll worry about that when the time comes.
OTHERMALE:Oh, heh, they don't make 'em like you anymore, Steve.
LEADMALE:All heart, no brains.
LEADMALE:Boy, Dad needed to watch you.
SUPFEMALE:Now I've gotta look out for you.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're still the same kid who gave away a brand-new bike to the orphanage.
OTHERFEMALE:What was wrong with that? It was my bike.
SUPMALE:You never rode it.
LEADMALE:I never got a chance.
LEADFEMALE:I turned around, Sister Mary Francis was pedaling it away.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you bringing this up now, Rob? That was 30 years ago.
LEADMALE:It'll be 32 years in May.
LEADMALE:The point is you don't think like a normal person.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you never did.
LEADMALE:You don't think like Dad, you don't think like me.
OTHERFEMALE:You think like you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, and that's very dangerous in the real world, Steve.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't talk to me this way, Rob.
SUPFEMALE:Not anymore.
OTHERMALE:I've come here to make sure Mom gets the very best.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want her hurt now.
LEADFEMALE:Who the hell are you, coming here telling me what's best for Mom? I'm here every day.
SUPFEMALE:I do her shopping.
SUPMALE:When she gets sick, she calls me up.
LEADFEMALE:When she has troubles in the middle of the night, I'm the one who comes over.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you, Steve? Where are you when your mother needs you? I'm asking you.
LEADMALE:Where the hell are you? Because you're sure as hell not here.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, get out here this minute.
LEADMALE:What's with him? We're late already.
SUPMALE:What's this? Why aren't you dressed? I'm not going.
OTHERMALE:What do you mean, you're not going? I'm not going.
OTHERMALE:I'm staying home.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter, Steven? Why don't you wanna come? I just don't want to.
LEADFEMALE:That's all.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma knows.
LEADMALE:It's okay with her.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not okay with me.
SUPFEMALE:When I say the family goes, the family goes.
LEADMALE:Now, you get upstairs and get dressed this minute.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:You say no to your father? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, no.
LEADMALE:Both.
LEADMALE:Maybe Dad needs to talk to Steven alone.
LEADMALE:Come on, Robbie.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna get killed.
LEADMALE:I love Grandma.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish we could go there twice a week.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna say this quietly and only once.
SUPFEMALE:You are gonna go up the stairs, you're gonna get dressed, you're gonna get out in the car, and you're gonna go to Grandma's like a normal human being.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I go to school five days a week.
LEADMALE:I work every day after school and Saturday.
LEADFEMALE:So? So does every kid in America.
LEADFEMALE:So it's Sunday.
OTHERFEMALE:It's my day off.
LEADMALE:I should be able to do what I want to on my day off.
SUPFEMALE:You know what my father would do if I talked to him like that? He'd take out the strap? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm not afraid.
LEADMALE:You're not afraid? Actually, I'm petrified, but I decided that I was gonna make a stand today.
LEADMALE:This is your stand? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I should be able to visit Grandma when I want to, not when everybody else does.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, I'm going over there tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Who are you? Are you from this planet or what? Dad.
LEADMALE:It's me, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:This figures to be a pretty one-sided conversation, Dad, but there are some things I have to say to you.
OTHERFEMALE:I can just hear you 
SUPFEMALE:"Why do you have to bother me when I'm lying down?" I wanna tell you I'm sorry, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry for making it so hard for you.
SUPMALE:There's so much I wanna take back, make right.
SUPFEMALE:God.
LEADMALE:It all went by so fast.
LEADMALE:I wish I could do it all over again, but Then again, I don't think I could stand it.
LEADFEMALE:I just couldn't take Geometry again, Dad.
LEADMALE:Three times should be enough for anybody, you gotta understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a father of four kids now.
LEADMALE:Two sons, just like you had.
OTHERMALE:I hear you in me, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:I hear you when I tell Alex not to dribble the ball in the house, or tell Mallory not to come home too late, or Jennifer to finish her milk.
LEADMALE:I hear you, and I have a much better understanding of what you went through with me.
SUPFEMALE:I've learned from you, Dad.
LEADMALE:And I promise you now to use what I've learned to make the best life I can for my family.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'll say goodbye now, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:But we'll talk again.
SUPMALE:I just want you to know I love you so much.
LEADMALE:I always did.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear any of this, Dad? Do you hear me? It's me, Steven.
LEADMALE:Your son.
OTHERMALE:Hey, morning, Dad.
LEADMALE:Morning, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What you got there? Some of Grandpa's old papers.
LEADFEMALE:Anything interesting? Yeah, here's something you might enjoy.
OTHERMALE:Prospectus for a brand-new company called IBM.
LEADMALE:Huh.
LEADFEMALE:See what Grandpa wrote in the margin.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:"This company will be successful on a scale we can only begin to imagine.
LEADMALE:" Knew I got it from somewhere.
LEADFEMALE:My dad was very shrewd financially.
LEADMALE:Of course he was shrewd financially, Dad.
SUPMALE:You don't just get someone like me by accident.
OTHERMALE:It takes, uh It takes generations of breeding.
SUPFEMALE:Of nurturing that one special gene.
LEADMALE:The finance gene.
LEADMALE:Well, I didn't get any of it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it skips a generation, Dad.
SUPMALE:That means your kids won't get it.
SUPFEMALE:Don't even joke about that.
SUPMALE:So how much did grandpa invest in IBM? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:Nothing? No.
LEADMALE:Wh? I don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:See, your grandpa was great at pickin' 'em.
SUPMALE:But he was just too nervous to really risk his own family's money, not in a big way.
LEADFEMALE:He must have known he was right.
LEADFEMALE:I always do.
LEADMALE:A lot of these men who went through the Depression, it colored everything they did.
LEADFEMALE:They'd seen it all collapse, and they never really believed it wouldn't happen again.
OTHERFEMALE:Life insurance.
LEADFEMALE:They believed in that.
LEADMALE:Savings banks.
LEADFEMALE:Five percent, compounded quarterly.
LEADMALE:Small dreams, but safe.
LEADMALE:You know, I remember the, uh, first day I figured out what savings banks were really all about.
LEADMALE:You know, if they were able to pay you five percent to use your money, you could bet they were making a lot more than five percent on it themselves.
LEADFEMALE:I remember I came running home to tell you about it.
LEADMALE:I remember.
OTHERFEMALE:Your kindergarten teacher was furious.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, Miss McCullough.
LEADFEMALE:No head for business, that woman.
SUPFEMALE:It's funny, isn't it? You live a lifetime, this is what's left.
LEADMALE:My dad reduced to a stack of papers and files.
SUPMALE:Such a complex man.
SUPFEMALE:I really loved him, Dad.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:He loved you.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, we were a lot alike.
OTHERMALE:You know, sometimes, uh, after you and I have a big talk or a political discussion, and I'd be sitting there 
OTHERFEMALE:"How did I get into this family?" I'd comfort myself by thinking of him.
LEADMALE:You know, I could see the connection.
LEADMALE:Sometimes late at night, I'd give him a call.
SUPMALE:I didn't know that.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:He'd get on, I'd 
SUPFEMALE:"Grandpa, quick.
OTHERFEMALE:Three reasons why liberalism can never work.
LEADMALE:" I don't imagine he had any trouble giving them to you.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:I feel close to Uncle Rob too.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's nice.
SUPMALE:I wish I felt closer to him sometimes.
LEADMALE:He's a good man, Dad.
LEADMALE:He, uh He's a lot more like you than you think.
LEADMALE:He just shows it differently.
SUPFEMALE:When did you become so wise about people, Alex? Well, Dad, I know a lot about conservative, financial-type older brothers.
LEADMALE:It's my specialty.
SUPFEMALE:Rob and I had some good times as kids.
OTHERFEMALE:It's funny how the years color your memories.
SUPFEMALE:I know you're going to find this hard to believe, but when you're older, some of your fondest memories in the world will be of Jennifer and Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:That is hard to believe.
LEADMALE:Morning, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, morning Uncle Rob.
LEADMALE:Hey, did you see the paper today? Bromwell Electronics? Up three and three eights.
LEADMALE:Yeah, ha-ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a good boy.
LEADMALE:He's a terrific kid, Steve.
SUPMALE:You should be proud of him.
LEADMALE:I am.
SUPFEMALE:He likes you too, Rob.
LEADFEMALE:And he respects you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if not the father, at least the son, huh? Robbie, we have to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I realize, uh, you and I have been at odds for a long time now, and, uh, there's a lot of unfinished business between us.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to bring up the baseball card thing again, are you, Steve? I didn't take your Joe DiMaggio.
LEADMALE:How'd we grow so far apart, Rob? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:One day, you were my little brother, tagging after me with a bat and a ball, shouting, "pitch 'em in.
LEADMALE:Pitch 'em in.
LEADFEMALE:" Next year, this snot-nosed, know-it-all teenager telling me what a terrible human being I was and how my values were all wrong.
LEADMALE:You always pitched 'em in to me, didn't you, Rob? Even when you were with your friends, the big guys, you always found a minute to come over and pitch in a few.
SUPFEMALE:I suppose I got a little annoying with that, huh? Ah, I'll be honest with you, Steve.
SUPMALE:You were a real pain.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to be.
LEADMALE:I idolized you, Rob.
LEADFEMALE:You were my big brother.
LEADMALE:I wanted to be like you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you remember when you were in the fourth grade, I got you on the baseball team with all the ninth grade guys? We used to sit around the locker room and talk about sex.
LEADMALE:I was always trying to be so grown up.
OTHERFEMALE:I was the only guy in fourth grade pretending he had kids.
LEADMALE:When did I become such a bad guy, Steve? When did that happen? You were never a bad guy, Rob.
SUPFEMALE:I think it was me.
SUPMALE:Maybe it didn't feel like Dad loved me, I don't know.
LEADMALE:You guys were always close.
SUPMALE:I was I was the outsider.
LEADFEMALE:Dad loved ya, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:He thought you were unbelievably weird, but he loved you.
LEADFEMALE:And he knew you loved him.
LEADMALE:I love you too, Rob.
LEADFEMALE:You're my big brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, look, uh, you know, I was just talking to Mom, and, uh Well, she really wants to move.
LEADMALE:Well, the sooner she does it, the easier it'll be for her, so maybe you're right.
LEADFEMALE:What's another $5000 against the time she has left? Oh, I don't know, Rob.
SUPFEMALE:You know a lot more about this stuff.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're here.
LEADFEMALE:You know best.
LEADMALE:Steven.
SUPFEMALE:I'm taking your financial advice.
LEADFEMALE:This is a big day for us.
LEADFEMALE:Don't blow it.
LEADMALE:Well, this is the last of it, Dad.
SUPMALE:Mom went upstairs to change Andrew.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:What about Jennifer and Mallory? Who? Your sisters.
LEADFEMALE:You sat next to them on the plane for three hours.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Those two.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, yeah, well, they're helping Mom with Andrew.

LEADFEMALE:I was worried for a while.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, thanks, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Can't tell you what it means to a guy my age to know his dad thinks he's good-looking.
LEADMALE:I was afraid you had too much Uncle Harold in you.
OTHERMALE:He, um He had a little weight problem.
SUPMALE:That's only one guy, Dad? He was a nice man.
LEADMALE:Big booming laugh.
SUPMALE:Gosh, he's been dead for Oh, Uncle Wally.

LEADMALE:It's amazing, Alex, isn't it? There's a little piece of all these people in you.
LEADMALE:Little movements, a smile, the way you tilt your head.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes when you walk a certain way, you're the spitting image of your Aunt Ethel.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, that's a real confidence builder before a date, Dad.
LEADMALE:It's family, Alex.
LEADMALE:You can't escape it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.

LEADFEMALE:BUT YOU WOULD SAY THAT A GIRL HAS TO BE MORE CAREFUL THAN A GUY? YOU KNOW, WORRY MORE ABOUT HER REPUTATION, HER DEMEANOR, THE WAY SHE ACTS IN PUBLIC.

SUPMALE:NOT LIKELY.
LEADMALE:I-I GUESS I BETTER JUST FORGET ABOUT HER, HUH? THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
LEADMALE:YEAH.
SUPMALE:YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADMALE:IT WOULD.
LEADFEMALE:THANKS, DAD.
SUPMALE:GOOD NIGHT.
LEADMALE:GOOD NIGHT, ALEX.
SUPFEMALE:WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO CHANGE? BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE WITH HER.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL LIKE WHEN CARRIE AND I ARE TOGETHER? I-I FEEL LIKE AN ASTRONAUT WHO NEVER WENT THROUGH THE TRAINING PROGRAM.
LEADFEMALE:I'M OUT THERE IN SOME OTHER WORLD, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FLY THE SHIP.
LEADMALE:WELL, THEN, UH YOU WERE LUCKY TO BE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOES.
OTHERFEMALE:YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADMALE:I AM LUCKY.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S PRETTY AMAZING OUT THERE.
OTHERFEMALE:I KNOW.
LEADMALE:I MARRIED AN ASTRONAUT MYSELF.
SUPFEMALE:UH, DAD IF, UH, BOYS AND GIRLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED THE SAME, HOW COME YOU'RE WAITING UP FOR MALLORY? 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY HOME.
SUPMALE:UH, WELL, UH  THINK I'LL FINISH MY WAITING UPSTAIRS.
LEADFEMALE:I JUST WANT TO SAY RIGHT OFF, I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAME BACK.
LEADMALE:I THINK I DO.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU WANTED TO TELL ME WHAT A JERK I WAS, H-HOW RUDE I WAS, HOW OBNOXIOUS, PRESUMPTUOUS, MANIPULATIVE.
LEADMALE:KEEP GOING.
LEADFEMALE:I THINK YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.
OTHERMALE:CARRIE, I-I AM SORRY.
LEADFEMALE:BOY, THIS EVENING REALLY BACKFIRED.
SUPFEMALE:I WANTED TO REFORM YOU, TO TURN YOU INTO A REAL LADY, AND INSTEAD INSTEAD WHAT? I THINK MAYBE YOU ALREADY ARE A LADY.
LEADMALE:IT'S JUST THAT Y-YOU'RE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LADY FROM THE KIND OF LADY THAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE WORD "LADY.
LEADMALE:" ALEX, WHAT IF I DECIDED TO BECOME THE GOOD LITTLE GIRL YOU WANT ME TO BE? DO YOU REALLY THINK EITHER OF US WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THAT? I DON'T KNOW.
LEADFEMALE:CARRIE, WE'RE SO DIFFERENT.
LEADFEMALE:WHY DO WE LIKE EACH OTHER SO MUCH? BECAUSE WE ARE SO DIFFERENT.
LEADMALE:BECAUSE WE SEE IN EACH OTHER SOMETHING WE DON'T SEE IN OURSELVES.
LEADFEMALE:AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT, ALEX.
LEADFEMALE:WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WHAT WE WANT TO DO.
LEADFEMALE: I'M GLAD I ASKED.
LEADFEMALE:WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME TONIGHT? I ALREADY DID.
SUPMALE:NO, NO, NO.
LEADMALE:I MEAN, AGAIN.
OTHERMALE:IT'S STILL EARLY.
LEADFEMALE:I KNOW A REAL ROMANTIC PLACE.
SUPFEMALE:GREAT AMBIENCE.
LEADFEMALE:SOUNDS NICE.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:HEY, HONEY.
LEADFEMALE:BOY, YOU'RE UP EARLY.
SUPMALE:YEAH, I WANTED TO GET A HEAD START.
LEADFEMALE:I'M MAKING BREAKFAST.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, WHAT IS ALL THIS? PANCAKES, BACON, EGGS, TOAST? AND FRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE.
LEADMALE:WELL, NOW, I AM VERY IMPRESSED.
LEADFEMALE:THAT'S HARD TO DO WITHOUT A JUICER.
OTHERMALE:IT'S EVEN HARDER TO DO WITHOUT ORANGES.
SUPMALE: WHAT'S THE OCCASION? YOU KNOW, I GOT UP THIS MORNING AND I REALIZED HOW INCREDIBLE IT IS -- ALEX IS A JUNIOR AT LELAND, MALLORY IS A FRESHMAN AT GRANT COLLEGE, JENNIFER IS IN JUNIOR HIGH, AND ANDY STARTS PRESCHOOL TODAY.
OTHERMALE: IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER, HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS FAMILY, HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU, AND HOW UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE THIS YEAR IS GOING TO BE.
LEADMALE:MAYBE WE SHOULD CANCEL THIS BREAKFAST.
OTHERMALE:AH, LET'S LIVE DANGEROUSLY.
LEADMALE:THESE PEOPLE EVER GONNA GO THROUGH MIDLIFE CRISIS? ALEX, JENNIFER, SIT DOWN.
LEADFEMALE:I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT PANCAKES.
OTHERFEMALE:WE'VE GOT EGGS.
LEADMALE:WE'VE GOT BACON.
SUPFEMALE:LOOKS GREAT, BUT THE JUNIOR CLASS IS HAVING A "WELCOME BACK" BREAKFAST.
SUPFEMALE:HOW ABOUT YOU, JEN? WHAT'S IT GONNA BE? EGGS? PANCAKES? I ATE ALREADY, DAD.
SUPMALE:I'VE BEEN UP FOR 3 HOURS.
LEADMALE:I SEE.
LEADMALE:MALLORY! HOW ABOUT SOME PANCAKES? PLEASE, DAD.
SUPMALE:IF I EVEN LOOK AT FOOD TODAY, I'M GONNA BE SICK.
LEADFEMALE:THIS WORKED OUT NICELY.
LEADFEMALE:JENNIFER, ANDY'S READY FOR YOU.
SUPMALE:HE JUST NEEDS HIS HAIR BRUSHED.
SUPFEMALE:ISN'T THAT CUTE? HIS FIRST DAY OF PRESCHOOL.
LEADMALE:YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:MALLORY, YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT SOME BREAKFAST? NO, DAD.
OTHERMALE:IT'S MY FIRST DAY OF COLLEGE.
LEADMALE:I'M VERY NERVOUS.
LEADMALE:MAL, YOU GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
LEADFEMALE: I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO A REAL COLLEGE.
SUPFEMALE:WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? OH, COME ON.
LEADFEMALE:HOW CAN YOU GET NERVOUS ABOUT GOING TO A COLLEGE THAT ADVERTISES IN HOT RO MAGAZINE? THAT'S NOT TRUE, ALEX.
SUPMALE:OH, COME ON, MAL.
LEADFEMALE:I SAW THE AD.
LEADMALE:"GRANT COLLEGE INTRODUCTORY OFFER -- BUY ONE SEMESTER, GET THE REST FREE.
LEADMALE:" THEN THERE'S THAT RADIO SPOT -- "AT GRANT COLLEGE, WE HAVE A MODERN LIBRARY, "FULLY QUALIFIED PROFESSORS, AND THICK, JUICY STEAKS COOKED JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE THEM.
LEADMALE:" ALEX, GRANT COLLEGE IS A VERY FINE SCHOOL.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S VERY HARD TO GET IN.
SUPFEMALE:HELLO, FELLOW GRANT COLLEGE FRESHMAN! LOOKS LIKE IT'S EVEN HARDER TO STAY OUT.
LEADFEMALE:SKIP, HOW ABOUT SOME BREAKFAST ON YOUR FIRST DAY AT GRANT COLLEGE? NO, NO, NO.
LEADFEMALE:THANK YOU, MR.
LEADMALE:KEATON.
LEADFEMALE:NO, I'M SAVING MY APPETITE FOR THOSE THICK, JUICY STEAKS.
LEADFEMALE: OH! HEY! 
SUPMALE:HI! HEY.
OTHERMALE:DOES THIS TIE GO, ALEX? "DOES THIS TIE GO"? YOU LOOK LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.
LEADFEMALE:TAX-FREE.
LEADFEMALE: IS IS TOO LATE TO TAKE ANDY TO THE WOODS AND HAVE HIM RAISED BY WOLVES? COME ON, DAD.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW HOW LONG I HAD TO WAIT TO HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER? WHAT I HAD TO ENDURE? I'M JUST EXCITED, THAT'S ALL.
LEADFEMALE:COME ON, ANDY.
LEADFEMALE:DO YOU WANT TO WAVE GOODBYE TO YOUR SISTER ON HER FIRST DAY AT COLLEGE? IT'S NOT A REAL COLLEGE.
OTHERFEMALE:WHERE'S ANDY? HE'S UPSTAIRS TAKING A NAP.
SUPFEMALE:AHH.
LEADFEMALE:I WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW HIS FIRST DAY AT PRESCHOOL WAS.
LEADMALE:I CALLED THERE THREE TIMES.
SUPMALE:EVERY TIME I CALLED, THEY SAID IT WAS NAP TIME.
OTHERMALE:WELL, HE'S UPSTAIRS TAKING ANOTHER NAP NOW.
OTHERFEMALE:I GOT TO TALK TO THIS KID.
SUPMALE:HE'S SLEEPING HIS LIFE AWAY.
OTHERMALE: 
OTHERMALE:HI.
OTHERMALE:GUYS, HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY OF COLLEGE? JENNIFER, IT WAS SO EXCITING.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM HIGH SCHOOL.
LEADMALE:I'M TAKING THIS AMAZING PHILOSOPHY COURSE.
OTHERFEMALE:WE TALKED ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH, THE NATURE OF REALITY, AND THE EXISTENCE OF BEING AND NON-BEING.
OTHERMALE:I MEAN, THIS COULD CHANGE THE WHOLE WAY I DRESS.
SUPMALE:HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY, SKIP? NOT QUITE AS GOOD.
SUPMALE:DUE TO A COMPUTER ERROR, I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY AT THE REGISTRAR TRYING TO PROVE THAT I'M NOT A LABORATORY RAT.
LEADMALE:WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL? I HAVE TO GO BACK TOMORROW WITH MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
SUPFEMALE:YOU KNOW, JENNIFER, I THINK PHILOSOPHY MAY BE MY TRUE CALLING.
LEADMALE:THERE ARE JUST SO MANY INTERESTING QUESTIONS.
LEADFEMALE:TODAY, THE PROFESSOR ASKED, "WHAT PROOF DO I HAVE THAT I REALLY EXIST?" SHOW HIM YOUR PHONE BILL.
LEADFEMALE: LAUGH IF YOU WANT, ALEX, BUT I HAVE STARTED MY FIRST PAPER.
LEADMALE:"I SHOP, THEREFORE I AM.
LEADMALE:" IT'S ONLY A FIRST DRAFT, TOO.
LEADMALE:WELL, LET'S GO TO THE MALL AND DO SOME RESEARCH ON THE PAPER.
SUPMALE:THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, JEN.
LEADFEMALE:YOU'RE GONNA DO REALLY WELL IN COLLEGE.
OTHERMALE:OH, HEY.
LEADMALE:IS ANDY ASLEEP YET? 'CAUSE I WANT TO ASK HIM -- OH, HE IS OUT LIKE A LIGHT, HONEY.
SUPMALE:HE'S HAD A VERY FULL DAY.
SUPFEMALE:I'M A LITTLE SLEEPY MYSELF.
SUPFEMALE:I'VE GOT A BIG DAY ON CAMPUS TOMORROW.
LEADMALE:I HAVE TO RUN THROUGH A MAZE AND RING A BELL TO GET A PIECE OF SWISS CHEESE.
OTHERMALE:YOU CRAZY COLLEGE KIDS.
SUPMALE:SO, UH, ANDY LIKED PRESCHOOL, HUH? OH.
OTHERFEMALE:GREAT.
LEADFEMALE:TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.
OTHERFEMALE:WELL, HE, UH, WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS AT FIRST.
SUPMALE:YEAH, WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
LEADMALE:THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.
LEADFEMALE:BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES, HE STARTED TO ENJOY HIMSELF.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, WHAT WERE HIS FAVORITE SUBJECTS -- FINGER PAINTING, BLOCKS, SUPPLY-SIDE ECONOMICS? I THINK HE SAID THAT THE PART HE LIKED BEST WAS SHARING TIME.
SUPMALE: OH.
LEADFEMALE:SHARING TIME? WHAT'S THAT? ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SCHOOL IS TO TEACH KIDS THAT SHARING IS FUN.
SUPFEMALE:SO, EVERYTHING IS SHARED EQUALLY.
LEADMALE:ALL THE TOYS IN THE ROOM BELONG TO THE GROUP, AND THEY'RE CONSIDERED COMMUNAL PROPERTY.
SUPFEMALE:WHAT IS THIS, THE KARL MARX PRESCHOOL? THE HARPER SCHOOL PROGRAM TEACHES KIDS TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER -- TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES.
OTHERMALE:THEY EVEN HAVE THIS METHOD OF ENCOURAGING THE CHILDREN WHO ARE A LITTLE SHY.
LEADFEMALE:THEY GIVE THEM PATCHES TO WEAR THAT SAY, "I KNOW HOW TO SAY GOODBYE" OR "I KNOW HOW TO NAP" OR "I KNOW HOW TO SPEAK IN SENTENCES.
LEADFEMALE:" SOUNDS LIKE AN INSANE ASYLUM.
LEADMALE:PRESCHOOL IS SUPPOSED TO PREPARE ANDY FOR REAL LIFE.
OTHERMALE:IN A COUPLE YEARS, HE'S GONNA BE OUT THERE IN THE DOG-EAT-DOG WORLD OF KINDERGARTEN.
LEADMALE:HE'S GOT TO BE READY.
LEADMALE:HE'S GOT TO BUILD HIS CHARACTER, SHARPEN HIS MENTAL SKILLS, IMPROVE HIS PHYSICAL ENDURANCE.
LEADMALE:SO BASICALLY, YOU'RE SUGGESTING A MILITARY PRESCHOOL.
OTHERMALE:I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE ANDY ON THE STREET WITH A PATCH THAT SAYS, "I KNOW HOW TO SAY GOODBYE.
SUPMALE:" OKAY, ANDY.
SUPFEMALE:HERE'S YOUR LUNCHBOX.
LEADFEMALE:NOW, THESE ARE YOUR COLORING BOOKS AND YOUR CRAYONS.
OTHERFEMALE:REMEMBER.
SUPMALE:HOW DO WE FEEL ABOUT SHARING? PBHT! THATABOY.
LEADFEMALE:OKAY, NOW YOU JUST WEAR THIS, AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE ANY PROBLEM.
LEADFEMALE:GOOD MORNING, ANDY.
LEADMALE:GOOD MORNING, MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER.
LEADFEMALE:GOOD MORNING, MRS.
SUPFEMALE:KLUGER.
LEADFEMALE:I'M ALEX KEATON, ANDY'S BROTHER.
LEADMALE:I'M MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER, THE DIRECTOR.
LEADFEMALE:RIGHT.
LEADMALE:OH, LISTEN, ANDY, I GOT TO RUN TO CLASS NOW.
OTHERMALE:BUT REMEMBER -- TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT, WE'RE GONNA GET ICE CREAM, THEN I'M GONNA TAKE YOU AND SHOW YOU HOW THE AUTOMATED-TELLER MACHINES WORK.
LEADMALE:OKAY? REMEMBER -- WHO LOVES YOU? ALEX LOVES ME.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU KNOW IT.
LEADMALE:SO, UH HOW'S HE DOING? OH, HE'S A TERRIFIC CHILD.
SUPMALE:HE'S VERY SENSITIVE AND VERY THOUGHTFUL OF THE OTHER CHILDREN.
LEADFEMALE:WELL, I CAN'T HELP THAT.
LEADMALE:IT'S MY PARENTS' INFLUENCE.
LEADFEMALE:YOU KNOW, ANDREW TALKS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME, ALEX.
OTHERFEMALE:OH, REALLY? YEAH.
LEADMALE:HE MENTIONS YOUR NAME SO OFTEN, YOU'D THINK SOMEONE WAS PAYING HIM TO TALK ABOUT YOU.
SUPMALE:MRS.
SUPMALE:KLUGER, DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AROUND HERE? OH, NO.
LEADFEMALE:FEEL FREE.
SUPFEMALE:WE ENCOURAGE VISITORS.
LEADMALE:WE'RE COMPLETELY OPEN AND FREE HERE.
OTHERFEMALE:THAT'S NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT.
SUPFEMALE:SO, THIS IS THE LIBRARY.
OTHERFEMALE:YEAH.
OTHERFEMALE:AND WE TRY TO FILL IT WITH COLORFUL, INTERESTING BOOKS.
SUPFEMALE:WE'VE GOT, UH, OH, "CHARLIE GOES TO SCHOOL," "A SNOWY DAY," "THE CURIOUS COW.
LEADMALE:" YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:WE'VE GOT THAT ONE AT HOME.
LEADFEMALE:MALLORY'S READING IT.
LEADMALE:MY SISTER.
LEADFEMALE:OH.
LEADFEMALE:YOU'VE ALSO GOT A SISTER IN PRESCHOOL? NO, MALLORY COULDN'T GET INTO PRESCHOOL SO SHE'S GOING TO GRANT COLLEGE.
LEADMALE:HI, MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER.
SUPFEMALE:HI, MICHAEL.
LEADMALE:WHAT DOES YOUR PATCH SAY? "I KNOW HOW TO SAY GOODBYE TO MY DADDY.
LEADFEMALE:" VERY GOOD, SWEETIE.
SUPFEMALE:ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL, ALEX? WHAT'S SO WONDERFUL ABOUT THAT? I KNOW HOW TO SAY GOODBYE TO M DADDY.
LEADFEMALE:YOU DON'T SEE ME WEARING A PATCH.
OTHERMALE:WELL, WE TRY TO ENCOURAGE MICHAEL.
SUPFEMALE:HE'S VERY SHY.
LEADFEMALE:THIS GIVES HIM A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT.
SUPMALE:WELL, I'M ALL FOR CREATING A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT, MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER.
LEADFEMALE:I JUST QUESTION YOUR METHODS.
OTHERMALE:OH.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? WELL, HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT DIVIDING THE CHILDREN INTO DIFFERENT PLAY GROUPS, GIVING THEM I.
LEADMALE:Q.
LEADFEMALE:TESTS? WELL, ALEX, WE'RE TRYING TO FOSTER A NONCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.
LEADMALE:OH, COME ON, MRS.
LEADFEMALE:KLUGER.
LEADFEMALE:JOIN US IN THE REAL WORLD HERE.
LEADFEMALE:DO YOU SEE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE NONCOMPETITIVE? PEOPLE SHARING? PEOPLE TAKING NAPS ON MATS? STEVEN AND ELYSE KEATON ARE YOUR PARENTS? OH, MRS.
LEADFEMALE:KLUGER, I GOT TO GO.
SUPMALE:UH, I'M JUST GONNA SAY GOODBYE TO ANDY, AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY.
LEADFEMALE:SURE.
OTHERFEMALE:HE'S OVER THERE, PLAYING HOUSE.
SUPFEMALE:NO, NO.
LEADMALE:THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
OTHERMALE:ANDY DOESN'T PLAY HOUSE.
LEADMALE:WELL, OF COURSE HE DOES.
SUPMALE:SEE HIM DIAPERING THAT DOLL? HE'S DIAPERING A DOLL? ANDY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DIAPERING A DOLL.
SUPMALE:WHERE'S YOUR WIFE? OUT WORKING.
LEADMALE:WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
LEADFEMALE:LET'S GO.
LEADMALE:LET'S GO.
SUPMALE:TODAY WAS THE FIRST DAY I REALLY FELT LIKE A REAL COLLEGE STUDENT.
SUPMALE:OF COURSE, TODAY WAS THE FIRST DAY I WASN'T GETTING SHOCKED FOR RUNNING AGAINST THE TRAFFIC IN OUR MAZE.
SUPMALE:SKIPPY, DO YOU MIND? I'M TRYING TO DO SOME WORK HERE.
SUPFEMALE:I'M SORRY, MAL.
LEADMALE:IT'S JUST SUCH A GREAT FEELING TO BE HUMAN AGAIN.
OTHERMALE:WAIT A MINUTE! YOU JUST GAVE ME A GREAT IDEA.
LEADMALE:I DID? MY NEXT ASSIGNMENT IN PHILOSOPHY IS TO PICK SOMEONE AND TRY TO PROVE THEY EXIST.
OTHERFEMALE:I MEAN, I CAN DO THAT ON YOU.
LEADMALE:WOW! WHAT A CHALLENGE! YEAH, IF I COULD PROVE YOU EXIST, I'D DEFINITELY GET AN "A.
LEADFEMALE:" AND YOU'D BE ABLE TO SETTLE A BET I HAVE WITH MY GRANDFATHER.
LEADMALE:WHOA, WHOA, MALLORY.
SUPFEMALE:DO YOU HAVE TO WORK HERE? WE COULD REALLY USE THIS SPACE.
SUPFEMALE:OH, NO, NO.
LEADMALE:YOU CAN'T STOP US NOW, ALEX.
LEADMALE:SEE, MALLORY IS GOING TO PROVE THAT I EXIST.
LEADFEMALE:THAT COULD GET A LITTLE MESSY.
SUPMALE:WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT IN THE KITCHEN, HUH? ALL RIGHT.
SUPFEMALE:ALL RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:OKAY, A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, SKIPPY.
LEADMALE:FIRST OF ALL, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY DISTINGUISHES YOU FROM AN INANIMATE OBJECT? MY ALLERGIES? ALEX, THIS IS CRAZY.
LEADMALE:DON'T YOU THINK MOM AND DAD ARE GONNA FIND OUT THAT ANDY ISN'T IN PRESCHOOL? YEAH, WELL, I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT NOW.
LEADMALE:THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO DEPROGRAM ANDY BEFORE ANYTHING HE LEARNED IN PRESCHOOL SINKS IN.
OTHERMALE:WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO FIRST? OKAY.
SUPMALE:WE'RE GONNA PLAY HOUSE.
OTHERFEMALE:I'M GONNA BE THE FATHER.
LEADMALE:YOU'RE GONNA BE THE MOTHER.
SUPFEMALE:WE'RE GONNA SHOW ANDY HOW A NORMAL FAMILY FUNCTIONS.
LEADMALE:ARE YOU WATCHING, ANDY? YES, SIR.
OTHERFEMALE:GOOD.
SUPFEMALE:HONEY, I'M HOME! HI, THERE, DEAR.
OTHERFEMALE: WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY WHILE I WAS OUT WORKING HARD TO SUPPORT YOU? I HAD AN AFFAIR WITH THE MILKMAN.
LEADMALE:THAT'S VERY FUNNY, DEAR.
LEADFEMALE:DOES THAT MEAN YOU DIDN'T MAKE ANY DINNER FOR YOUR HUSBAND, EVEN THOUGH I WAS SLAVING AWAY AT THE OFFICE? AT LEAST YOU GET PAID.
LEADFEMALE:HOUSEWORK IS JUST AS TOUGH AS YOUR JOB, AND I DON'T GET A DIME.
LEADFEMALE:I WANT A DIVORCE! ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER.
OTHERMALE:IF YOU CAN'T PLAY NICELY, LET'S NOT PLAY AT ALL, OKAY? THAT'S ALL RIGHT, ANDY.
LEADFEMALE:WE DON'T NEED HER.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, ALEX.
LEADMALE:HEY! THERE'S MY GUY.
SUPMALE:HI, SWEETIE.
SUPFEMALE:HI.
SUPMALE:HEY, WHAT'S, UH -- WHAT'S THIS PATCH? UH, THAT'S NOTHING.
LEADFEMALE:"I KNOW HOW TO ITEMIZE DEDUCTIONS.
LEADMALE:" BOY, THEY'RE REALLY MOVING AHEAD QUICKLY THERE.
OTHERMALE:MOM, DAD, SIT DOWN.
LEADMALE:SOMETHING VERY BAD IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOW.
LEADFEMALE:JUST HEAR ME OUT BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING, OKAY? OH, THIS IS WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.
LEADFEMALE:ANDY WITHDREW FROM PRESCHOOL TODAY.
SUPMALE:WHAT? AND I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
LEADFEMALE:I ADMIRE HIM FOR IT.
LEADFEMALE:OKAY.
SUPFEMALE:ALL RIGHT.
OTHERMALE:ALL RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:ANDY DIDN'T WITHDRAW.
LEADMALE:I WITHDREW HIM.
SUPFEMALE:BUT THAT PRESCHOOL WASN'T FOR HIM.
LEADMALE:HE WAS PICKING UP A LOT OF BAD HABITS THERE.
OTHERMALE:ALEX, THE HARPER PRESCHOOL IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE AREA.
SUPMALE:IT'S A HUMANISTIC APPROACH TO CHILD CARE BASED ON AFFECTION, MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING, AND RESPECT.
LEADMALE:GRANTED, YOU HAVE NO REGARD FOR THESE THINGS, BUT OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR SPECIES CLING BLINDLY TO THEM.
SUPFEMALE:I'M GONNA CALL MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER.
SUPMALE:THERE'S NO WAY SHE COULD'VE TAKEN ANY OF THIS SERIOUSLY.
LEADMALE: ALL RIGHT.
LEADMALE:LOOK, I'M SORRY THINGS TURNED OUT THE WAY THEY DID.
LEADMALE:BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING.
LEADFEMALE:I ONLY DID WHAT I DID 'CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS BEST FOR ANDY.
LEADFEMALE:I LOVE THAT KID.
SUPFEMALE:I'D NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT HIM.
SUPMALE:ALL RIGHT, ALEX.
LEADFEMALE:BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING.
LEADFEMALE:WE'RE HIS PARENTS, AND THIS IS OUR DECISION.
LEADMALE:YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:WAIT A MINUTE.
LEADMALE:YOU GOT MALLORY.
LEADFEMALE:YOU GOT JENNIFER.
SUPMALE:YOU GOT CARTE BLANCHE ON THEM.
LEADFEMALE:DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
LEADMALE:I'LL EVEN THROW IN SKIPPY IF YOU WANT.
LEADMALE:BUT ANDREW ANDREW'S MINE.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, IF HE THROWS IN SKIPPY STEVEN! GOOD MORNING, ANDREW.
SUPFEMALE:GOOD MORNING, ALEX.
SUPFEMALE: GOOD MORNING, MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER.
OTHERFEMALE:IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU BACK AT SCHOOL, ANDY.
SUPMALE:I THINK MRS.
LEADMALE:KAUFMAN'S WAITING FOR YOU.
LEADFEMALE:GO AHEAD, ANDY.
SUPFEMALE:BE STRONG.
SUPMALE:MRS.
LEADMALE:KLUGER, I'M, UH, SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.
OTHERFEMALE:I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE, AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU HOW TO RUN YOUR SCHOOL.
SUPFEMALE:I GET A LITTLE EMOTIONAL WHEN IT COMES TO ANDY.
SUPMALE:WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY AND WATCH HIM PLAY FOR A WHILE? ACTUALLY, I CAN'T.
LEADFEMALE:I GOT TO GO.
LEADMALE:THANKS, ANYWAY.
LEADFEMALE:ALL RIGHT.
LEADFEMALE:HAVE A NICE DAY.
SUPMALE:OKAY.
LEADMALE:THIS MORNING, WE'RE REALLY GONNA HAVE FUN.
SUPFEMALE:LET'S PRETEND THAT WE'RE GOING TO RUN A LITTLE BUSINESS.
LEADMALE:BUSINESS? NOW, WHAT SHOULD WE SELL? TURTLES! TURTLES.
LEADFEMALE:THE TURTLE MARKET'S BEEN DEPRESSED SINCE '81.
LEADFEMALE:NOW, IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A TURTLE STORE, WE HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH TO SELL THE TURTLES FOR.
LEADMALE:NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK, EVERYBODY? FOR FREE.
LEADMALE:WELL, THAT IS VERY NICE OF YOU, RHONDA.
SUPFEMALE:WE WON'T CHARGE ANYTHING FOR THE TURTLES.
LEADMALE:WAIT A MINUTE.
LEADFEMALE:WAIT A MINUTE.
LEADMALE:AT THAT RATE, YOU'RE GONNA BE OUT OF BUSINESS BY NAP TIME.
SUPFEMALE:UH, WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME, PLEASE? SORRY.
LEADMALE:NOW, WHAT'S THE FIRST THING WE NEED FOR OUR STORE? TURTLES.
SUPMALE: TURTLES! THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, ANDY.
OTHERFEMALE:ONCE WE HAVE TURTLES, I GUESS WE'RE READY TO OPEN UP.
SUPMALE:NO, COME ON.
LEADFEMALE:WAIT.
OTHERFEMALE:LOOK.
OTHERMALE:THERE ARE A MILLION DECISIONS TO BE MADE HERE.
OTHERFEMALE: FIRST OF ALL, WHAT KIND OF TURTLES ARE YOU GONNA SELL? MYSELF, I'D SUGGEST DIVIDING THE STOCK UP IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER -- DISPOSABLE TURTLES? YEAH, YOU KNOW, THE KIND THAT DIE AS SOON AS YOU BRING THEM HOME.
SUPFEMALE:AND THEN, THE OTHER 30%, I'D HAVE THOSE, YOU KNOW, THOSE BIG SEA TURTLES.
LEADFEMALE:FOR SOUPS.
SUPMALE:BUT YOU NEED A STORE MANAGER TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS.
LEADMALE:NOW, WHO WANTS TO BE A STORE MANAGER? OH! I SEE ANDREW KEATON HAS HIS HAND UP.
SUPFEMALE:I LIKE A BOY WITH INITIATIVE.
SUPFEMALE:I GOT AN IDEA.
SUPFEMALE:WE NEED CO-MANAGERS.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, MICHAEL, WHY DON'T YOU AND ANDY BOTH MANAGE THE STORE? GOOD.
SUPFEMALE:GREAT.
SUPMALE:OKAY.
LEADMALE:NOW WE NEED AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN.
LEADFEMALE:RHONDA, YOU EVER DO ANY MODELING? YES, AND I HAVE A DOG.
LEADMALE:LET'S STICK TO BUSINESS, RHONDA.
SUPMALE:OKAY, WE'RE GONNA NEED A PICTURE, A PHOTOGRAPH, OF YOU AND A TURTLE AND A SIGN SAYING, UH, WHAT? WHAT? UH, "WELCOME TO OUR GRAND OPENING.
LEADMALE:COME OUT OF YOUR SHELL SALE.
SUPMALE:" RIGHT? OKAY.
LEADMALE:WE'RE GONNA NEED A SIGN.
LEADMALE:WHO WANTS TO PAINT A SIGN? EXCUSE ME, BUT I WORK HERE.
LEADFEMALE:FABULOUS.
SUPFEMALE:GET SOME PAINTS, WILL YOU? AND, UH SOME RED, WHITE, AND BLUE DECORATIONS.
LEADMALE:OKAY, NOW, WE'RE GONNA NEED A BUSINESS MANAGER TO HELP US AVOID PAYING TAXES.
SUPMALE:WHAT'S TAXES? A TAX IS A TERRIBLE HAIRY LIBERAL MONSTER WITH BIG TEETH.
LEADFEMALE:  AND THE ONLY THING -- THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP THE TERRIBLE TAX MONSTER IS A REPUBLICAN.
SUPMALE:WHO WANTS TO BE A REPUBLICAN? WHOA!  OH.
LEADMALE:WHAT'S ALL THIS? OH, IT'S VERY SIMPLE, ELYSE.
SUPMALE:IF THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL BREAKFAST DIDN'T WORK, WE JUST SWITCH GEARS AND TRY THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL DINNER.
LEADFEMALE:BUT THE KIDS HAVE BEEN BACK TO SCHOOL FOR OVER A WEEK NOW.
LEADFEMALE:SO, THEY'VE HAD TIME TO WORK UP AN APPETITE.
SUPFEMALE:SEE YOU LATER.
LEADMALE:OKAY.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M HAVING DINNER AT CHRISSY'S HOUSE.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU SAID I COULD GO LAST WEEK.
LEADFEMALE:THIS IS A SCHOOL NIGHT, JENNIFER.
LEADFEMALE:SHOULDN'T YOU BE STAYING HOME AND STUDYING? I FINISHED STUDYING.
OTHERFEMALE:AND ANYWAY, I GOT A 98 ON MY FIRST TEST.
LEADFEMALE:I WOULD'VE GOTTEN 100, EXCEPT THAT I PUT MANDALAY DOWN AS THE CAPITAL OF BURMA INSTEAD OF RANGOON.
OTHERFEMALE:AND YOU EXPECT US TO JUST OVERLOOK THAT? HI.
OTHERMALE:HI.
LEADFEMALE:HI.
LEADMALE: HEY, MAL, SKIP.
LEADFEMALE:MALLORY, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
OTHERFEMALE:YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD.
SUPFEMALE:AH, THANKS, SKIPPY.
LEADFEMALE:AND DON'T WORRY.
SUPMALE:YOU'LL GET OVER IT.
SUPMALE:WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, I GOT AN "F" ON MY PHILOSOPHY PAPER.
OTHERMALE:I COULDN'T PROVE THAT SKIPPY EXISTED.
LEADMALE:WELL, MAYBE I'LL JUST GO BACK TO THE LAB AND THE OTHER RATS.
LEADMALE:AT LEAST I WAS ACCEPTED THERE.
LEADFEMALE:BYE-BYE.
SUPMALE:WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY, MAL.
SUPMALE:WE'RE PLANNING A BIG DINNER.
LEADFEMALE:UM, I CAN'T, DAD.
LEADFEMALE:NICK AND I ARE GOING TO AN ART EXHIBIT.
LEADFEMALE:IT STARTS IN HALF AN HOUR.
LEADMALE:SEE YOU LATER.
LEADMALE:WELL, HERE WE ARE AGAIN, ELYSE YOU, ME, AND HUGE AMOUNTS OF FOOD.
OTHERMALE:HEY.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, ALEX.
SUPFEMALE:HI, SWEETHEART.
LEADFEMALE:ANDY.
SUPFEMALE:HEY.
LEADFEMALE:HOW WERE YOUR CLASSES? I DON'T KNOW.
SUPFEMALE:I DIDN'T MAKE IT.
SUPMALE:I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY AT PRESCHOOL WITH ANDY.
LEADMALE:WHY? WAS THERE A PROBLEM? HE'S STILL ENROLLED, ISN'T HE? YEAH, HE'S STILL ENROLLED.
OTHERMALE:AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE GOT HIS REPORT CARD TODAY.
LEADFEMALE:"DOESN'T GET ALONG WITH OTHER CHILDREN, HAS A TENDENCY TO TRY TO RUN EVERY ACTIVITY HIS OWN WAY.
LEADFEMALE:" WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE.
LEADFEMALE:THAT'S MINE.
LEADMALE:OH.
SUPMALE:NOHERE'S ANDY'S RIGHT HERE.
LEADMALE:OH.
LEADMALE:OH.
SUPFEMALE:WELL, YEAH.
LEADFEMALE:"ANDY IS A DELIGHTFUL BOY "WHO'S VERY POPULAR WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN.
LEADFEMALE:IT'S A PLEASURE HAVING HIM IN THE CLASS.
LEADMALE:" THAT'S WONDERFUL, ANDY.
SUPMALE:MAYBE I WASN'T COMPLETELY IN THE RIGHT ON THIS WHOLE PRESCHOOL THING.
SUPFEMALE:I MEAN, SURE, THEY DO SOME THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN I WOULD, BUT ON THE WHOLE, THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF LOVE AND AFFECTION THERE.
LEADMALE:WITH THE PROPER SUPERVISION AND THE RIGHT GUEST SPEAKERS, THOSE KIDS COULD LEARN A LOT.
LEADFEMALE:"GUEST SPEAKERS"? I'M GOING TO BE LECTURING THERE ONCE A WEEK.
LEADFEMALE:UH, BY THE WAY, YOU'RE PLANNING ON EATING HERE TONIGHT, AREN'T YOU? OH, DAD, UH, LISTEN.
LEADFEMALE:ANDY AND I WERE GONNA HAVE DINNER ALONE TONIGHT, KIND OF A "BROTHERS EVENING.
SUPFEMALE:" THAT'S ALL RIGHT, ISN'T IT?  FINE.
LEADMALE:FINE.
OTHERFEMALE:I'LL JUST PUT THIS IN THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL FREEZER.
LEADFEMALE:I'LL EAT IT.
LEADFEMALE:YOU'RE GONNA EAT LASAGNA, AND A RACK OF LAMB, ELYSE? WELL, NOT ALL AT ONE SITTING.
LEADFEMALE:HEY, ANDY.
SUPFEMALE:SORRY I RUINED YOUR FIRST WEEK AT PRESCHOOL.
SUPMALE:IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE MY ONLY BROTHER.
SUPMALE:I GET A LITTLE CRAZY WHEN IT COMES TO YOU, 'CAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU ARE DESTINED FOR GREATNESS -- THE SAME WAY THAT JENNIFER IS DESTINED FOR GREATNESS, THE WAY I'M DESTINED FOR GREATNESS, AND, UH, MALLORY'S DESTINED TO BE CARED FOR BY THE STATE.
LEADMALE:BUT YOU CAN GO AT YOUR OWN PACE, OKAY? I'M NOT GONNA PUSH YOU TOO HARD.
SUPFEMALE:IF YOU EVER NEED ANY ADVICE, COME TO ME.
LEADFEMALE:IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING, COME TO YOUR BIG BROTHER, ALL RIGHT? JUST DON'T ASK ME TO BEAT UP ANYBODY FOR YOU, ONCE YOU GET PAST FIVE.
LEADMALE:ALEX LOVES ME.
LEADMALE:YOU BET HE DOES.
SUPFEMALE: LET'S GO GET SOME BURGERS, HUH? OH, ANDY YOU DRIVE.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's Andy? He was supposed to be down 15 minutes ago.
SUPFEMALE:He's upstairs getting dressed.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, it's his first day of kindergarten, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't want to be late.
LEADMALE:Most of the kids I knew who were late for kindergarten never bounced back.
LEADFEMALE:Some are unemployed, some are in jail, the rest are at Grant College.
LEADFEMALE:Seems like yesterday we were taking you to your first day of kindergarten.
LEADFEMALE:What a nightmare that was.
SUPFEMALE:I thought it went rather smoothly.
OTHERMALE:No, as soon as you found out that your kindergarten teacher's name was Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:McGovern, you became hysterical.
LEADMALE:We could not convince you that she wasn't related to George McGovern.
SUPFEMALE:You kept screaming, "Nixon's the one.
OTHERFEMALE:Four more years.
SUPMALE:" Jennifer, I'm telling you, you look great! I just want a second opinion.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, what do you think of this blouse? Well, the blouse is fine.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you get the pants? Mallory and I went shopping yesterday.
SUPMALE:Well, how'd they get so ripped? We had them done at the store.
LEADFEMALE:Costs a little extra, but it's worth it to get them ripped professionally, huh? Well, Jen, you're not wearing those pants to school.
LEADFEMALE:Why? When you and Dad were in school, all your clothes were ripped I've seen pictures.
LEADFEMALE:That's different.
LEADFEMALE:Why? I'll go ask your father.
OTHERMALE:Jen, I'm telling you, you are gonna do great in high school.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, Jen, what are you worried about? This is Harding High.
SUPFEMALE:This is my alma mater.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a legend there.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see your schedule.
LEADMALE:Okay, let's take Okay, first period, you got Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Gibson for English.
LEADMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:He loved me, wrote me a recommendation for college.
OTHERMALE:Second period, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Hentaugh for math.
SUPMALE:She wrote me two recommendations for college.
OTHERMALE:Third period, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Kaufman for science.
LEADMALE:He drove me to college.
LEADFEMALE:Andy, Andy, let's get to work, buddy.
SUPMALE:Got a lot of ground to cover here.
SUPFEMALE:First day of kindergarten, you want to get off to a good start, right? I'm ready, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, the first thing your teacher's gonna ask is what you did over the summer.
SUPMALE:Now, a lot of kids are gonna say, "I went to the zoo" or "I went to the beach" or "I went to a baseball game.
LEADFEMALE:" What are you gonna say? I watched the Iran-Contra hearings.
SUPFEMALE:And? President Reagan doesn't know anything.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't know anything about the scandal.
LEADMALE:Okay, you don't want to be quoted out of context.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, we've been over this a thousand times.
OTHERMALE:Well, just humor me, okay? Because our ripped pants were a political statement.
LEADFEMALE:What? That's why we could wear ripped pants to school and you can't.
LEADFEMALE:Forget about the pants for a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think of the blouse? The blouse I like.
SUPFEMALE:It's hip, it's rad, it's gnarly.
OTHERMALE:You'll have to change it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Keaton school bus leaving in 15 minutes.
SUPMALE:Kindergarten.
SUPFEMALE:Coming, Alex? Mm, I don't have to be on campus till 11:00, Dad.
LEADMALE:Tough schedule at Leland, huh? Well, considering you go to a college that offers a graduate program in Trivial Pursuit, I wouldn't start with the college jokes.
LEADFEMALE:And for your information, it's not a class, it's a psychology experiment.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know you had an interest in psychology.
OTHERMALE:I don't.
SUPFEMALE:I have an interest in money.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you've mentioned that.
OTHERFEMALE:Some, uh, psych major's doing a paper on overachievers put an ad in the Leland Gazette looking for participants, so I thought I'd apply.
LEADFEMALE:It's 100 bucks just to see what makes a guy like me tick.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, when they find out, please let us know.
SUPMALE:Chester, please.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to work here.
LEADMALE:Are you hungry? What are you in the mood for? Where did you learn the sign for McNuggets? Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I know it's the door.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Can I help you? Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex P.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, overachiever.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I'm Lauren Miller.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Come on, Chester, lunchtime! He wants McNuggets.
LEADMALE:Again? I'm not gonna look like that when you're done with me, am I? No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Chester's here learning sign language.
SUPFEMALE:He has over a 300-word vocabulary.
SUPFEMALE:That's incredible! I have a sister who gets by on half that.
LEADMALE:Have a seat, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks very much.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:So, have you ever been the subject of a psychological profile before? Uh, well, not officially, Lauren.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, although, when my younger sister Jennifer was in the fifth grade, she had to do a paper on a member of the family and chose me.
LEADMALE:That's sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I still remember the title.
OTHERMALE:It was, uh, "He Ain't Heavy "But He's Annoying He's My Brother.
LEADMALE:" Well, this study will probably be a little different.
LEADMALE:Although I do like that title.
OTHERFEMALE:Now let me see your resume, please.
SUPMALE:Uh, sure.
SUPMALE:Just got to one sec.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you sure have been a busy little beaver, haven't you? Lord knows I try.
LEADFEMALE:"Member of Phi Beta Kappa.
OTHERFEMALE:"President of the Young Entrepreneurs Club.
LEADMALE:"President of the Young Businessmen's Club.
OTHERMALE:"President of the Alliance of Young Entrepreneurs and Young Businessmen.
SUPFEMALE:" Thank God someone finally got them together.
LEADMALE:Well, it wasn't really that hard.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm the only member of both clubs.
LEADMALE:"Winner of the McKinley Fellowship, the Rotary Scholarship, the Wilson Scholarship.
LEADFEMALE:" Alex, this is really impressive.
SUPFEMALE:Seems like the only thing you haven't won yet is the Miss America contest.
LEADMALE:Well, you know that's all political.
LEADMALE:I'm really glad that you'll be a part of this study.
LEADMALE:You mean I'm accepted? Accepted? Alex, you are the classic overachiever.
SUPMALE:You're the Babe Ruth of overachievers.
LEADMALE:Well, we can start on Tuesday.
LEADMALE:The sessions will run about an hour.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, you'll be paid for your participation.
SUPMALE:Paid? Paid? Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Forget about it.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's really not necessary.
LEADFEMALE:It's reward enough for me to be able to help a fellow student in pursuit of academic knowledge.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's $50 a session.
LEADFEMALE:The ad said a hundred.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, it's a hundred for schizophrenics and 50 for overachievers.
LEADMALE:Uh, why? Uh, what, are you getting a two-for-one deal on schizophrenics? No, we just have variable rates depending on the particular study.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, we can begin The ad said a hundred.
OTHERMALE:No, I've got it right here.
LEADFEMALE:Then uh-huh You see, 100 for schizophrenics, and 50 for overachievers.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
OTHERMALE:I'm-I'm being penalized for being normal.
OTHERMALE:Anyone who merged the Young Businessmen and the Young Entrepreneurs is not normal.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:What is that supposed to mean? It means that all of you overachievers are exactly the same.
OTHERMALE:You know, all you care about is how much money you're getting paid.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what happened to the idea of helping a fellow student in the pursuit of academic knowledge? I wouldn't exactly call a psychology experiment academic knowledge.
OTHERMALE:What's wrong with psychology? Nothing, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Has its place, right up there with all the other make-believe disciplines.
SUPFEMALE:Like anthropology, sociology my personal favorite, women's studies.
SUPMALE:Well, for your information, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, psychology is a very real discipline.
OTHERFEMALE:But of course, I know it's not as exciting as sitting in a business class, learning how to take over the world in one huge multinational merger.
SUPFEMALE:All right, okay, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't start knocking business majors just 'cause we don't have time to sit around and get in touch with our feelings.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know you don't.
LEADMALE:That's 'cause you're too busy getting in touch with your brokers.
SUPMALE:You leave my broker out of this.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know if you business, economic, yuppie, Republican overachievers have any feelings to get in touch with.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh, really? Oh, really? Well, I've got a feeling.
OTHERMALE:I got a feeling that this whole thing is a mistake! See, I know where this study is going.
SUPMALE:You're trying to show that just because I am an overachiever, that I have no soul.
SUPMALE:That all I care about is money.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me tell you something, missy, you are wrong.
SUPMALE:And I'm not doing this for a penny less than 75.
LEADMALE:Hey, sorry I'm so late.
LEADFEMALE:How'd the psychology session go? Oh, Ma, if you don't mind, I'd rather not talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I had a great first day.
SUPFEMALE:I'm taking this biology course, and I thought it'd be really boring, but I found a way to relate it to my major.
SUPFEMALE:Found a way to relate biology and fashion design? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:My first my first research paper is gonna be called "Darwin and the Survival of the Best Fitted.
LEADFEMALE:" That's real interesting, honey.
LEADMALE:My basic premise is that certain animal species became extinct for the same reason certain types of clothes disappear they simply go out of style.
OTHERFEMALE:In other words, the dinosaur and the leisure suit suffered the same fate.
SUPMALE:I-I think it's a little more complex than-than that, Mallory.
LEADMALE:See, the dinosaurs became extinct because of some very severe, uh, climatic changes in the Earth's temperature.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:They didn't have a good winter wardrobe.
SUPMALE:Meanwhile, the mammals are running around in stylish fur coats, so they survived.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's great, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
LEADMALE:There's no way that happened.
SUPFEMALE:How do you know? Were you there? I've taken enough history to know that the dinosaurs' problem was not a lack of earmuffs.
LEADMALE:What's your problem tonight? Yeah, what's bothering you, honey? Did something go wrong at the psychology session? I go to see this girl, this Lauren Miller girl, right? The one, the one that's conducting the experiment on overachievers.
LEADMALE:Anyway, things started out fine.
LEADMALE:Said hello, you know, exchanged a few pleasantries.
LEADMALE:The next thing I know, we get into this huge argument about money.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
OTHERMALE:In other words, the same thing that happens when you meet anybody.
LEADMALE:Even though the ad clearly stated $100 per session, she tells me that's just for schizophrenics.
LEADFEMALE:That's so typical of 
SUPFEMALE:I'm being paid less money 'cause I only have one personality.
OTHERFEMALE:If that.
OTHERFEMALE:Then she starts accusing me of being just like all the other overachievers.
SUPMALE:Um, only being interested in money, and, uh and status, you know? Not having time for the more emotional areas in my life.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you, nobody's irritated me this much, this fast, since the first time I met Ellen.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, come on I know what you're thinking.
SUPFEMALE:You're thinking I'm falling for this girl.
OTHERMALE:There's no way, that's not true.
LEADFEMALE:Alex and Lauren, sittin' in a tree Why don't you go put some earmuffs on a dinosaur, Mal? Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Oh, um ye-yes, uh-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Just-Just a second.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, it's Lauren Miller.
LEADFEMALE:It is? What does she what what does she want? She agrees to $75, and she wants to know if you'll start Tuesday.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, uh, just, uh tell-tell-tell her I'm eating.
LEADMALE:All right? No! Um Uh, tell her, uh tell her I'm in the shower.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, um Uh, tell-tell her I'm eating in the shower.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I think he might be able to get that schizophrenic rate after all.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Alex is coming back.
OTHERFEMALE:I know how you feel about him.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex P.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, overachiever.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Chester.
LEADMALE:How you doing, buddy? What-What does it mean when he holds up his middle finger like that? Exactly what you think it means.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Alex, before we get started, I'd like to officially apologize for my behavior the other day.
LEADMALE:It was it was very unprofessional.
SUPMALE:Well, I'd like to apologize also.
OTHERMALE:I-I didn't mean to slander psychology.
LEADMALE:It's definitely better than women's studies.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm sorry I criticized your incredible, all-consuming money obsession.
LEADFEMALE:Not your normal exchange of apologies but, uh it's all we got.
LEADFEMALE:Shall we get to work, then? - Sure.
LEADMALE:Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait I I don't want to harp on this money issue, but if you're going to electrocute me, I'd like another $75 for my family.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, this is just a polygraph machine.
LEADFEMALE:If someone displays undue tension or an increase in pulse when answering a question, the machine buzzes, and I know they're not telling the truth.
SUPFEMALE:Does it really bother you? No, no, absolutely not.
LEADMALE:Absolutely not.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh I got nothing to hide.
LEADMALE:Oh, good.
SUPMALE:It's working.
SUPFEMALE:Now, first I'd like to ask you a few questions to see how well you'll fit in with the rest of the subject group.
SUPFEMALE:Now, politically, would you describe yourself as liberal, middle of the road, or conservative? Uh, well, I-I I don't really like political labels.
LEADFEMALE:Conservative.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, overachievers they tend to meticulously plan out every aspect of their lives, from graduation to retirement.
OTHERMALE:Do you see yourself as an obsessive planner? What, me? No.
LEADMALE:Well, I-I wouldn't say "obsessive.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm a planning maniac.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the typical overachiever is so focused on classes and career that there's not much time left for dating.
LEADMALE:Would you say you have a very active social life? An active active social life.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Are you actively dating? Well I go out on a couple of dates a week.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe more.
LEADFEMALE:This particular week was a little slow.
SUPMALE:This particular year was a little slow.
SUPFEMALE:You're lucky you don't have one of these strapped to you in real life.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm just I just I'm not very good at sitting here and answering these personal questions, you know? Uh, maybe if it was a little more of a give and take.
SUPFEMALE:You know, maybe if I asked you some questions? Okay, but Alex, I'm not the one that's being studied here.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not the overachiever.
LEADMALE:Hey, come on, you can't be doing too bad.
LEADMALE:I mean, not everybody gets to do an honors thesis in psychology.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's different.
LEADMALE:Psychology's always come very naturally for me.
LEADFEMALE:Even when I was a kid, I was You really don't want to hear about this.
LEADMALE:No, no! I do, I do! I really.
LEADFEMALE:It'll-It'll-It'll make us more comfortable with each other.
LEADMALE:I'll be able to lie in a much more relaxed fashion.
LEADMALE:I remember when I was a kid, my mother came into my room and she was screaming at me, 'cause I'd made this huge mess in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:She must have yelled at me for about an hour, and when she finished, I just I looked at her very calmly and said, "So how does that make you feel, Mom?" That must have driven her crazy.
LEADFEMALE:And the crazier she got, the more interested I became in psychology.
OTHERFEMALE:All my girlfriends had pictures of David Cassidy and John Travolta in their in their lockers at school.
LEADFEMALE:I had this big picture of Freud.
LEADMALE:All my friends had pictures of Jaclyn Smith, Farrah Fawcett and, uh, I had this big picture of Pat Nixon.
LEADMALE:Um, now that we're more relaxed with each other, let's get back to work, okay? Yeah, how about how about you, uh, Lauren? Are you actively dating? That's an area of my life that's in a holding pattern.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I could be as analytical about love as you overachievers, but I guess you could say that I'm in the "hopeless romantic" category.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I don't think that we're gonna get a lot done today.
LEADMALE:Why don't we just wrap it up? Or we could just continue talking about this informally.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, maybe over a cup of coffee? Coffee? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Is this a beverage problem? No, I just we've just got such a great psychologist-overachiever relationship, and I'd - I'd hate to see that change.
LEADMALE:Right, I understand.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, I've got a class in a couple of minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Oh, by the way, Alex I'd like to come by your house sometime this week and talk to your family.
OTHERMALE:I like to get a firsthand look at each overachiever's home environment.
SUPMALE:I'll see you.
LEADMALE:Just what I need.
LEADFEMALE:A psychologist who makes house calls.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great, good, everybody's here.
LEADFEMALE:Now is a good time for us to go over what we're going to say when Lauren gets here.
LEADFEMALE:No, Alex, I know exactly what I'm gonna say.
LEADFEMALE:I've been waiting 18 years to discuss you with someone in the mental health field.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Mal, you got to be very careful what you say to a psychologist.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I've, uh, drawn up some appropriate comments for all of you.
SUPMALE:"Alex is more than a son.
LEADFEMALE:"He's a friend.
LEADMALE:"A companion.
LEADFEMALE:"Someone with whom I can spend many happy hours discussing politics, world affairs and current events.
SUPMALE:" Alex, I'm afraid if I read this aloud I'll be struck by lightning.
SUPMALE:Mom "Mom, please read the 'Alex is more than a son' speech if Dad refuses to.
LEADFEMALE:" "When I think of Alex, three words come to 
LEADMALE:Integrity, intelligence, intellect.
LEADFEMALE:" And, of course, the soon-to-be-added "institutionalized.
SUPMALE:" No improvising.
LEADMALE:"The thing I love best about Alex is that whenever I have a problem, he's around.
LEADMALE:" You are never interested in my problems.
LEADFEMALE:Where does it say I'm interested? It says I'm around.
LEADMALE:There's a psychologist out there.
SUPFEMALE:Good, there's a crazy person in here.
OTHERMALE:Lauren.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh uh, um Everybody, this is Lauren Miller.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren, this is my father Steven Keaton, - My mother Elyse Keaton - Hi, Lauren.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Uh, my sisters Jennifer, Mallory and I guess you met Andy.
LEADMALE:I really want to thank you all for taking the time to talk with me.
LEADMALE:I always find that visiting the home of an overachiever gives me a special perspective.
LEADFEMALE:You should see what living with one does.
SUPMALE:Well, uh why don't we go into the living room? You know, uh, Lauren, Alex is more than a son, he I can't do it.
LEADMALE:Andy! Andy, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going in there, buddy? I'm not sure.
SUPMALE:What does "straight jacket" mean? So I said, I don't care how much interest a money market is making, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think it's a very nice gift for Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:Lauren! Lauren! Uh, Lauren Uh, can I speak to you for a minute? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:What's up? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:Uh, we just we never really had a chance to say hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Uh, so how's it going in there? Well, the only thing I can tell you for sure is that you're not normal.
LEADMALE:But other than that, there's no sign of a severely maladjusted id, or a wildly fluctuating ego.
LEADFEMALE:Which in Freudian terms means They're the two elements balanced by the superego.
SUPFEMALE:How did you know that? Uh, well, I-I, uh I took some Freud out of the library the other day.
LEADFEMALE:I just figured since you were you were spending so much time uh, trying to figure me out, I'd, um, I'd see what made you tick.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, actually, the interesting thing is this Freud's a pretty amazing guy.
OTHERMALE:Although I do think he's a little too sexually oriented.
LEADMALE:Really? That's kind of what I liked about him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really surprised you did that, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's a very non-overachiever-ish thing to do.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, I felt pretty non-overachiever-ish when I did it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna get back inside.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Lauren? What? You be careful on your way into that living room.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:I will.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you could say I've always wanted to excel.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, even as a young boy.
SUPMALE:But it wasn't so much the winning that mattered to me it was the pure enjoyment of the competition.
OTHERFEMALE:And I've always felt, in my heart You know, the amazing thing is it's not even on.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I think I've had enough abuse for one day.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, that was a great session.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I had a terrific time talking to your family the other day.
LEADMALE:They really seem to love you a lot.
LEADFEMALE:You sure it was my family you were talking to? They gave me a lot of great information.
OTHERMALE:And they told me about Ellen.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Do you mind discussing her? Because if you'd rather not Oh, no, no, no no problem.
LEADFEMALE:No, I I love to talk about Ellen.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want to know? Well, psychologically speaking, it's interesting that you should be in a relationship with a girl like Ellen.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, considering that most overachievers look for other overachievers to go out with.
LEADMALE:I mean, she was an artist, wasn't she? Uh, yeah, an artist dancer, a poet yeah, we were complete opposites.
LEADMALE:Why did you break up? Oh, she got a dance scholarship in Paris.
LEADFEMALE:I got one, too, but Do you miss her? Sure yeah.
LEADMALE:I-I miss her in the way that you miss a close friend, you know? I mean, Ellen Ellen taught me a lot.
LEADFEMALE:She taught me how to appreciate art.
OTHERFEMALE:Or at least not to laugh at it so much.
LEADFEMALE:She taught me She taught me how to come out of my emotional shell.
LEADFEMALE:You know? Be more more giving.
OTHERMALE:More open.
LEADFEMALE:More caring.
LEADMALE:Made me a better person.
LEADMALE:Alex, what you just said was really beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it was almost poetic.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that hardly seems possible.
LEADMALE:Nothing rhymed.
LEADMALE:It just doesn't add up.
LEADMALE:I mean, on the surface, you're this business-oriented, money-minded, conservative guy, yet you fell for a girl like Ellen, and expressed those kind of feelings.
LEADFEMALE:You're definitely the most complex overachiever I know.
LEADMALE:How many of us do you know? Well, I've interviewed And I was going out with this guy who definitely qualified as an overachiever.
LEADFEMALE:You-you and an overachiever? That seems biologically impossible.
LEADMALE:He was a graduate student in business management.
LEADMALE:And you let him go? Well, we went out for almost a year.
LEADFEMALE:It was sort of like your relationship with Ellen.
LEADMALE:We were also complete opposites.
SUPMALE:But we did have some good times.
LEADMALE:What happened? Got a job offer from a big investment firm on Wall Street, his own office and $50,000 a year to start.
SUPFEMALE:So he left.
SUPMALE:Well, you can't really blame the guy.
LEADFEMALE:I don't blame him.
SUPFEMALE:It was mutual I mean, I-I I got tired of interpreting his dreams.
SUPFEMALE:They were always about BMWs.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, so, you, uh, you haven't seen anybody since then? Alex, how come you're the one that always ends up asking me the questions? I'll share my hundred bucks with you.
LEADMALE:Seventy-five.
LEADMALE:Don't be so hung up on money.
LEADMALE:No, I haven't seen anybody since then.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you can say I've been kind of wary - about getting involved.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Have you seen anybody since Ellen? No.
SUPMALE:I guess you could say I've been pretty wary myself.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it's best that way.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I mean that way nobody gets hurt.
LEADMALE:Exactly.
LEADMALE:Although, um although, sometimes if you take the chance of getting hurt you could be surprised.
OTHERFEMALE:That's true.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Alex, I got some research I want you to comment on.
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I had some research I wanted you to comment on.
OTHERMALE:I got it, here.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I got it.
OTHERFEMALE:No, let me get it Got it; I got it.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Lauren, look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I-I didn't, I didn't mean to kiss you.
OTHERFEMALE:I was, I was helping you with the papers and your lips got in the way.
LEADMALE:It's okay; this is really interesting stuff here.
LEADFEMALE:It's you'll hardly be able to put it down.
LEADMALE:Alex, I got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren, uh Lauren, wait a minute, um Look, uh, we were just getting good at that.
LEADMALE:Is Alex home yet? - Not yet, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:He still must be at school.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:High school's gonna be a lot rougher than I thought.
LEADMALE:This algebra course is a killer.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe we can help you, Jen.
SUPFEMALE:I think I better wait for Alex.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a min You're sitting here, uh, with two college graduates.
LEADMALE:I'm sure we can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Elyse? I think we should wait for Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Give me a shot.
LEADMALE:I'm not optimistic about this, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Go ahead; I'm listening.
SUPFEMALE:"There are two trains.
LEADFEMALE:"If the first train's destination is "a thousand miles away, and it travels at a speed "of 120 miles an hour for two hours, "making three stops of ten minutes each, "at what point will it pass a train coming from 700 miles away "in the opposite direction, traveling 90 miles an hour, making stops of 18, There-there are two trains, right? I'll send Alex up when he gets home.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Alex, when you have a chance, Jen could use some help on an algebra problem? Yeah, I'll go up in a minute can I talk to you guys? - Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, what's up? I did something incredible today.
LEADFEMALE:Something I told myself I'd never do.
SUPMALE:You helped a Democrat cross the street? Worse.
OTHERMALE:You see, it happened during one of my research sessions with Lauren.
LEADFEMALE:Um we were talking, you know, this, that, you know, and, uh, um Anyway, one thing and another, you know Well, what happened after you kissed her? I-I, I, I fumbled out a little apology.
SUPMALE:I mean, it was a little kiss.
OTHERFEMALE:It was a little nothing.
LEADFEMALE:And then-then, then she kissed me.
LEADMALE:A big one.
SUPMALE:Nearly tore the ligaments in my neck.
LEADMALE:And, uh, and then-then-then she just ran out of the room.
LEADMALE:And you haven't seen her since? Well, judging by my romantic history, she's probably on a plane for Paris right now.
OTHERFEMALE:They have that regularly scheduled "Au revoir, Alex" flight.
LEADMALE:Alex, does Lauren know how you feel about her? I don't know how I feel about her.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, on one hand, I can't stop thinking about her.
LEADMALE:And on the other hand, I'm just not ready for this kind of relationship right now.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's going on? Oh, we're, uh, having a private discussion, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:What's it about? Private meaning I'd rather not discuss it with you.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, why won't you share some of your emotional life with me? After all, there's so little of it to go around.
LEADFEMALE:Because, Mal, whenever I tell you something personal, it's instantly transmitted up to some big gossip satellite in the sky, and then beamed back down into the otherwise empty heads of your rumor-mongering friends.
OTHERMALE:Alex, I won't tell a soul; I promise.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's-there's an outside possibility that I may have developed something other than a professional relationship with Lauren.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've already spread that gossip.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know? Because you always wear that-that blue sweater when you want to impress a girl.
LEADMALE:The one with the monogrammed "APK" on it.
SUPFEMALE:It's totally wrong for you, by the way.
SUPMALE:Makes you look like a big, blue bath towel.
LEADFEMALE:That's the look I was going for, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Well, congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, this whole thing is complicated by the fact that Lauren has already been through a bad experience with another guy.
SUPMALE:Well, then that's perfectly understandable behavior coming off a breakup.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom's right.
SUPMALE:I know if Nick was suddenly out of my life, I'd have a hard time starting a relationship with somebody new.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never know until you try.
SUPMALE:No, I think what I should do here is continue with the sessions, you know? Pretend that nothing happened.
LEADMALE:Feel her out, and don't commit until she commits.
SUPMALE:Alex, I think you should tell her how you feel.
LEADMALE:Be as open and honest as you can.
SUPMALE:I can't be open and honest with her.
LEADMALE:She's a psychology major.
LEADFEMALE:She'll see right through that.
LEADMALE:We-we were just talking.
SUPFEMALE:One thing lead to another and then he kissed me.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not gonna tell him how I feel about him.
LEADMALE:I don't even know how I feel about him.
LEADFEMALE:All right, here he is.
LEADFEMALE:I want everything to be completely business-like.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you should go.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Got a lot of ground to cover today.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we get started? - Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, I'm ready to work.
OTHERMALE:That's why I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, last time we discussed your childhood and your scholastic career.
LEADFEMALE:Today I'd like to discuss your future.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:How do you picture your life ten years from now? Ten years from now? Uh, let me see.
LEADMALE:Um, well I'd probably be a partner in a major New York banking firm, making a quarter of a million dollars a year.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, I'll have a condo in Manhattan, beach house in Long Island, house in-between.
LEADFEMALE:For storage.
SUPMALE:Uh Couple of cars, a boat helicopter.
SUPMALE:And a huge electrical fence to keep poor relatives out.
OTHERFEMALE:How about you how do you see yourself ten years from now? Alex, this is how we get into trouble.
SUPFEMALE:You start asking questions, you throw me off track, the next thing you know, we're on the floor and you're kissing me.
LEADFEMALE:While we're on this topic, let me just say that while I was kissing you, you were kissing me.
LEADFEMALE:What happened at our last session was a very natural thing.
LEADFEMALE:We were opening up emotionally to each other, things got a little out of hand.
LEADMALE:It happens all the time.
OTHERMALE:Lauren, if that happens all the time you're gonna be the most popular psychologist in Ohio.
LEADMALE:It's a very simple psychological phenomenon known as "emotional transference.
LEADMALE:" It's well-documented in the literature.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I'll show you.
LEADFEMALE:Try looking under "kiss.
SUPMALE:" "Transference the psychological carryover "of learned emotional responses "from one behavioral situation to another.
LEADMALE:See 'Kiss.
OTHERFEMALE:"' I was just like it noted, for the record, that we were kissing each other.
OTHERMALE:It's duly noted.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Miss Miller.
LEADMALE:You're welcome, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Kiss.
SUPMALE:Well, now that we've gotten that cleared up, may we please continue? Yes, ma'am.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:So far, you've got a quarter of a million dollars and a huge fence.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a very full life.
LEADMALE:Are you married? Definitely, definitely.
LEADFEMALE:And what's your wife like? She's a, she's a warm wonderful caring woman.
LEADFEMALE:Who looks great in an evening gown.
LEADFEMALE:Understands my needs.
SUPFEMALE:You know, my priorities are her priorities.
LEADMALE:You know, she's always there for me, willing to listen.
LEADFEMALE:You know, to stand behind me, to support me, comfort me.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Where are you planning to meet her, at dog obedience school? All right, what is that supposed to mean? Nothing, nothing at all.
LEADMALE:It's just that she sounds a tad subservient.
SUPFEMALE:Subservient? How is that subservient? She'll have a key to the fence.
LEADMALE:And I can just imagine what your husband is gonna be like.
SUPFEMALE:And what's that supposed to mean? Well, you'll probably have him strapped to a polygraph machine.
LEADMALE:Make sure all his feelings, all his emotions are real.
SUPMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to be with a man who's not afraid to express his feelings.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with that? Absolutely nothing.
SUPMALE:Why don't we give Phil Donahue a call? Well, let's just hope, for your sake, that in ten years, Pat Nixon is available.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, now you're making fun of Pat Nixon.
LEADFEMALE:Is nothing sacred to you? You know, I hope you can make that fence of yours real tall, Alex, 'cause I wouldn't want you to see any part of the real world by mistake.
OTHERMALE:You're telling me about the real world? A girl who holes up in a psych lab behind all her books and her reports, judging other people.
LEADMALE:Oh, good! Things are finally getting out in the open here! Yeah, one more 
LEADFEMALE:You know, I came here today thinking that maybe, by some incredible chance, we might have something together.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, was I wrong.
LEADMALE:You know, for your information, I was wondering the same thing.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I thought you were different.
LEADFEMALE:I must have been crazy.
LEADFEMALE:You're just like all the others.
LEADMALE:All right, okay, here we are, back to the first day the big generalizations.
SUPMALE:All of us overachievers are the same.
LEADMALE:All right, look, every response is identical.
SUPFEMALE:"I want a quarter of a million dollars.
OTHERFEMALE:"I want a beach house.
LEADFEMALE:I want a fence to keep my relatives out.
SUPFEMALE:" You know, the biggest distinction is whether to get the Jaguar in black, red or racing green.
SUPMALE:They come in racing green? You know, I'll tell you this much.
LEADFEMALE:The guy I fell for isn't gonna plan his life out according to some graph.
SUPMALE:And his wife isn't going to be a walking Barbie doll.
OTHERFEMALE:He's gonna be overwhelmed with passion and devastated by emotion and exhausted by the intensity of his love.
LEADMALE:And I was overwhelmed and devastated and exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:I just freshened up before I came over here.
SUPMALE:I don't know why I bothered.
LEADMALE:You know, I really don't see any point with going on with these sessions.
LEADMALE:No, that's great why don't you just send the check to my house, all right? Of course.
LEADMALE:You'll get your precious check.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Chester, don't ever evolve.
LEADFEMALE:It's not worth it.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, where's everybody going? We're taking Andy to see Snow White.
OTHERMALE:Snow White.
OTHERMALE:There was a gal.
LEADFEMALE:Not too many like her anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Sweet, pretty Whistled while she worked.
SUPFEMALE:Easy, son, the woman's animated.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, at this point, Dad, I'd be willing to settle.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with you, Alex? You don't look too great.
OTHERMALE:Things, things didn't work out between me and Lauren.
SUPMALE:Alex, I'm so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:You must have worn the blue sweater.
LEADMALE:I appreciate your concern, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:This just isn't a fashion issue.
SUPFEMALE:You want to go to the movie with us, Alex? The popcorn's on me.
SUPFEMALE:Come on along, Alex.
SUPMALE:Indulge your Snow White fantasies.
SUPMALE:Yeah, Alex, you could pretend to be the eighth dwarf Greedy.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, anyway, guys.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not really in the mood for a fairy tale right now.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, they're replaying President Reagan's news conference from this afternoon.
SUPMALE:I thought you said you weren't in the mood for a fairy tale.
SUPMALE:Ah Ah, ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Just kidding.
LEADMALE:Okay, we'll see you later.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wait Mom, I thought you were going.
OTHERMALE:Well, to tell you the truth, I'm a little fed up with Snow White.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she's just so passive.
LEADFEMALE:You know, lying around waiting for some prince to come and give her a kiss.
SUPMALE:What kind of role model is that for women today? I think she should go to school, get a degree, start a business and hire a prince.
OTHERMALE:Then she could kiss him whenever she wants.
LEADFEMALE:Settle down.
LEADMALE:Oh I can't imagine what's gonna happen when they rerelease Bambi.
SUPFEMALE:I'm all right.
SUPMALE:I'm fine.
SUPMALE:How are you doing? - You mean about Lauren? - Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, I, I figure if it was meant to be, it would have happened by now.
LEADFEMALE:I've known you a long time now that doesn't mean I fully understand you; doesn't mean I even have a clue but I-I-I do know one 
OTHERFEMALE:You are not the kind of person who sits around and mopes and casually takes defeat.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just, I'm trying to look at it philosophically, you know? I mean, it's just part of part of growing up.
LEADMALE:It's part of the maturing process.
LEADMALE:Why doesn't she love me?! I'm not the one to ask, honey.
SUPMALE:I love you very much.
LEADFEMALE:It's not the same.
LEADMALE:I'm well aware of that.
LEADMALE:But I have been thinking, you know? You really seem to have a passion for this girl Lauren.
OTHERMALE:If I were you, I'd-I'd get the hell over there.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Mom.
SUPMALE:Tell Lauren your mommy sent you.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:You busy? No.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:This is a surprise.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, my mommy sent Uh, so, this is your place, huh? Yeah.
LEADMALE:It's nice.
OTHERMALE:It's, uh, it's very nice.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:This your family? Alex, those are the Beatles.
OTHERFEMALE:You have heard of the Beatles, haven't you? Oh, hey, come on.
SUPMALE:Just 'cause I'm an overachiever doesn't mean I'm not hip.
LEADFEMALE:No, I've heard of the Beatles.
OTHERMALE:We should go and see them play sometime.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea.
LEADMALE:Look, Lauren, I don't want to take up too much of your time, okay? I-I just came over to say something, and I'm gonna say it.
SUPFEMALE:What is it, Alex? Lauren Yes, Alex? Do you have the correct address to send my check to? Yeah, I've got your check.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Well, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Just, uh I guess that's, that's it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I guess so.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I got what I came for, so Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, see ya.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah Yeah, I'll see ya.
LEADMALE:Look, Lauren, this check is not what I came here for.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? You wanted cash? No, look, I was just thinking about what you said to me about, about how I plot out every aspect of my life, and all I think about is money.
LEADMALE:Alex, I was upset when I said that.
SUPMALE:No, no, you were right.
LEADFEMALE:See, after, after Ellen and I broke up, I ju I just told myself I wasn't gonna get involved in any other relationships, and, um, I'd just concentrate on school and on career and on making money, and I thought I'd be happy.
SUPMALE:And then I met you and those things just don't seem like enough anymore.
SUPMALE:They don't? I mean, don't get me wrong; I mean, I love money.
LEADMALE:But you can't come home at night and cuddle up with money.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you can't sit down and pour your feelings out to money.
SUPFEMALE:You can't take a romantic moonlight walk on the beach with money.
SUPFEMALE:God knows I've tried.
LEADMALE:There's just got to be more.
LEADFEMALE:I just got to have someone to care about.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, what are you saying? Lauren, uh you know how you have an image of yourself in your mind, you know? And that, and that image is of-of being, being the best, you know? Being the cleverest, the happiest person that you can be.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:I just feel like when I'm with you, I can be that person.
LEADFEMALE:I make you feel that way? Lauren, I can't stop thinking about you.
OTHERMALE:I, I want to be with you.
LEADMALE:I want to hold you.
SUPMALE:I want to open a joint bank account with you.
LEADMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:It's true.
OTHERMALE:Lauren, I think I'm falling in love with you.
LEADFEMALE:That I can believe.
SUPMALE:It's the part about the joint bank account.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you know when you said that I was hiding in my psych lab, just making judgments on people? You were right.
LEADMALE:I have been hiding because I was scared of getting hurt.
LEADMALE:But since you started coming in, I felt incredibly alive.
LEADMALE:Also annoyed, bothered and frustrated, but mostly alive.
LEADFEMALE:Alive is good! Those are good signs.
LEADMALE:But, Alex, you know, maybe we shouldn't go so fast, though.
SUPMALE:We should probably discuss and try to place in some perspective our What bank do you want to start the account in? I've always been partial to First Federal.
SUPMALE:Alex, you make me laugh.
LEADMALE:No one's ever made me laugh like you before.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, if you've read Freud's jokes on the relation of the unconscious, - you'll find that humor is really - Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:You know, if you want to make a million dollars and have a car and a boat and a plane, I can live with that.
SUPMALE:Don't forget about the beach house.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, a beach house would be very nice.
SUPMALE:I was hoping you didn't come by here just to pick up your check.
LEADMALE:Check? I couldn't care less about that check.
LEADFEMALE:Sit, Ubu, sit.
OTHERFEMALE:Good dog.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Uh-uh, Andy, that is the last piece of cake.
LEADFEMALE:I get half of that.
LEADMALE:Have an apple, it's better for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for caring, Andrew, but I think I'll cut it in half.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's not half.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADMALE:You think that 'cause I'm small, I can't see straight.
SUPMALE:Andy, we can share.
LEADFEMALE:No! - I'll cut it in half - I'm telling Mom! Oh, hey, wait, wait, wait.
SUPFEMALE:This is embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE:You guys fighting over a piece of cake? What difference does it make if one piece is slightly bigger than the other? None so long as I get it.
LEADMALE:Mom, Dad, I got it.
SUPFEMALE:I got it! I've been chosen to take over the personal advice column for the Columbus Shopper"s Guide.
SUPMALE:I'm going to be "Dear Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:" - Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE: That's great! - They picked me over a hundred other applicants.
LEADFEMALE:They said my sample answers were warm, compelling, yet practical.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Great, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe you can help us over here.
LEADFEMALE:We're trying to decide on how to share this cake.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I get a piece of that - Mom!  Oh, wait! Wait, wait! You've come to me with a problem.
OTHERFEMALE:You've come to "Dear Mallory," and I won't let you down.
SUPFEMALE:Sit, sit.
SUPMALE:Okay, okay, how's this? Jen, you cut the cake.
LEADMALE:Andy, you get to pick which piece you want.
SUPFEMALE:That way, Jen will cut it fair.
OTHERFEMALE:That's absolutely brilliant.
LEADFEMALE:Warm, compelling, yet practical? You know, Steven, maybe we could use that approach ourselves.
LEADMALE:I could cut and you could pick? Well, dear, we've done so well for the last 20 years with me cutting and picking.
LEADMALE:Although it's a great idea, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:I am a natural at this.
LEADMALE:I better get started.
OTHERMALE:Look at all these letters I have already.
SUPMALE:Oh - Oh, you can't actually look, Dad, they're confidential.
SUPMALE:Oh, let me look.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess you're family and all, so "Dear Mallory, I need your advice.
LEADMALE:"My partner doesn't satisfy me sexually, - and I was wondering" - Oh, Dad My advice is that you don't read that.
LEADFEMALE:Very wise, "Dear Mallory.
SUPMALE:" Alex, Alex, guess what? I'm "Dear Mallory"! Yeah, and I'm "Adorable Alex.
LEADFEMALE:" So what? Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:No, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm taking over the personal advice column for the Columbus Shopper"s Guide.
SUPMALE:The column is called "Dear Mallory.
LEADMALE:" Now, wait, wait, wait.
LEADMALE:Columbus Shopper"s Guide Isn't that that freebie giveaway thing they have at the checkout counter at the supermarkets? Uh, the one with all the coupons in it? That's right.
SUPMALE:What are you so excited about, Mal? You're gonna be you're gonna be giving advice to lowlife bargain hunters who can't afford to buy a real paper.
SUPMALE:Alex! They're not lowlife bargain hunters.
LEADFEMALE:They're people, real people coming to me for advice.
SUPMALE:Mal, if these people were willing to shell out a quarter, they could turn to "Dear Abby.
LEADFEMALE:" I can help him.
SUPFEMALE:And if either one of you need help, come to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to be very busy but I'll always have time for you.
LEADMALE:You're family.
SUPFEMALE:Cut the cake.
SUPMALE:Got a problem, Mal? I don't have problems, I solve problems.
LEADMALE:I'm "Dear Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:" Is there anything bothering you, Alex? Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:"Dear Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:" Come on, Alex, talk to me.
SUPFEMALE:Open up.
LEADMALE:I sense that beneath that preppy little exterior, there's a mass of insecurities and frustration waiting to pour out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Mal, that's why I have this exterior.
OTHERMALE:To protect the rug.
LEADMALE:Come on, Alex, I need practice and everyone else in the house is so sane.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be your best friend.
LEADMALE:Oh, that always works with me, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:That's because you don't have any friends, right? Mallory, why don't you read me one of your letters? - Okay.
LEADMALE:  "Dear Mallory" I love the way that sounds.
LEADMALE:"I am an extremely pretty with a knockout body" Go on.
SUPFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:"I have a real interest in money, "and I'm searching for a smart, cute, who likes money, too.
LEADFEMALE:" We've got to help these people, Mal.
OTHERMALE:And in order to help them, we need an address.
SUPFEMALE:Hasn't anybody started dinner? Oh, yeah, Ma, I started it.
LEADMALE:And then I decided against it.
OTHERMALE:Alex, it is your turn to start dinner tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, how can you think of eating, when there when there's a young woman in peril at 3214 Douglas Drive? Apartment 3C.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom Mom, maybe you can help me out.
OTHERFEMALE:I need practice solving people's problems before I publish my first column.
SUPFEMALE:And? - Well, is there anything you'd like to talk about? Anything bothering you? Well, I'm hungry.
SUPFEMALE:Besides that, anything else? I'm thirsty, too.
LEADMALE:Dad, help me out.
LEADMALE:Any major problems in your life you'd like to discuss? Um no, I got in the door just fine.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Dad, think hard.
LEADMALE:Anything at work? - No.
LEADFEMALE:Physical problems? - Nope.
SUPMALE:Marital problems? - Well, sometimes your mother - Steven! Mallory, I've been going through some of these letters, and most of them seem pretty ordinary, but I think I found one you can use in your column.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great, great.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, it's really very touching.
SUPMALE:"Dear Mallory"  "I'm 181/2 years old, and for the first time "in my life, I have a boyfriend.
SUPMALE:"But last night, a friend told me "that he's seeing another girl, too.
LEADMALE:"I can't stop crying.
LEADFEMALE:What do I do?" Signed, First Love.
OTHERMALE: Dad, it's just a letter.
SUPFEMALE:I'm, uh I'm fine.
SUPMALE:I'm-I'm, I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:Great choice, Jen.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna use this in my first column.
SUPMALE:Her first love.
LEADMALE:Dad, be strong.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look, uh, why don't we go in the kitchen and get dinner started, and leave the problem solving to them? I'm too upset to eat.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm not! Move it.
SUPFEMALE: What are you gonna tell her, Mal? I mean, I feel kind of responsible.
LEADFEMALE:I found the letter and all.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Sit down.
OTHERMALE:Something like 
SUPFEMALE:"Dear First Love, "There are plenty of fish in the sea.
LEADMALE:Looks like you may have caught yourself a shark.
LEADFEMALE:" Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:"So stop crying.
LEADFEMALE:"First thing you've got to do is find out if it's true.
LEADMALE:"If he is seeing the other woman, you've got no choice.
LEADFEMALE:Cut him loose.
SUPFEMALE:" - That's good, Mally.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? That's good, that's good.
LEADMALE:I would add, um, uh, "And let him sink into the slime.
SUPFEMALE:" But that's just me.
LEADFEMALE: That's a nice touch, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think of my response? I liked it, but don't you think it's a little rough? Now, see, Jen, rough but fair.
LEADMALE:You've got to give it to these people straight, or nobody feels like they're getting helped.
LEADMALE:I mean, how would you feel? I don't know, I haven't had my first love yet.
LEADMALE:But when you do, you'll come to me for advice, right? For sure.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going, Mom? Well, I'm working on the McPhillips house.
LEADFEMALE:Still? I thought you finished that.
LEADFEMALE:What's the problem? Well, it's really a problem of balancing the spatial and the structural logistics.
LEADFEMALE:I mean Can we do we just sheer-wall the existing elements, or can we support the weight of a cantilevered terrace with with just poured concrete grade beams? I don't know.
LEADMALE: Architecture got you down, Mom? Here's a suggestion for a quick pick-me-up.
LEADFEMALE:Go buy yourself a new dress.
LEADFEMALE:Something splashy; something pink.
SUPFEMALE:Buy me one too.
LEADMALE:Make you feel better.
LEADMALE:Always worked for Frank Lloyd Wright.
LEADFEMALE:You see? - Mm.
LEADFEMALE:How's "Dear Mallory" coming along? Great.
LEADFEMALE:I've got Andy helping out now.
LEADMALE: Oh, that's cute.
LEADFEMALE:How do you spell "grow up"? Uh, G-R-O-W U-P.
LEADFEMALE:How about "sink back into the slime"?  Ask Alex.
LEADMALE:I brought you a 
LEADFEMALE:The new issue of the Shopper"s Guide, Mal! Yay! It's my first "Dear Mallory!" Where is it? Where is it? It's, uh, it's right here, Mal, it's right here, right between "The Weekend Grease Monkey" and "Cora's Cut-Rate Corner.
LEADFEMALE:" Eh, uh, you know, that "Weekend Grease Monkey" is a hell of a column.
LEADMALE:No need to tell us, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:It's our favorite, too.
OTHERMALE: Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, there's my picture! Yeah, right between Cora and the Monkey.
LEADMALE:Let me read it.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:"Dear First Love, there are plenty of fish in the sea, and it looks like that you may have caught a a shark.
OTHERMALE:" -  - Whew.
LEADFEMALE:Or what's this here? Oh, uh, eh, uh, that's your address and, uh, that's your phone number, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
OTHERMALE:You know, you should really know that.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, in case you get lost or something.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I put it in there.
OTHERFEMALE:If any of my readers had questions you know, if anything seemed unclear they could call or write me directly here.
OTHERMALE:Well, that's something Dear Abby's never done.
LEADFEMALE:I am simply not into a cold, aloof approach to advice-giving.
OTHERFEMALE:I am warm and accessible.
OTHERFEMALE:People need me, and I'm here for them.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:I can vouch for that.
LEADFEMALE:She's warm and accessible Nick! Please! Please, Nick, it's bad enough our phone number's in the paper.
LEADMALE: Look, what is to stop people from coming up to our house - and knocking on the door? -  Very little, it seems.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Are you "Dear Mallory"? Well, I know what your problem is, pal.
LEADMALE:Slight gender confusion.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that is on the list.
LEADFEMALE:That's "Dear Mallory" right there.
SUPFEMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:I'm "Buffaloed Bill.
SUPFEMALE:" - Buffalo Bill.
LEADMALE:"Buff Buffaloed Bill.
LEADMALE:" - Oh, okay.
OTHERMALE:My wife, she orders me around all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, these are my parents, Steven and Elyse Keaton.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
OTHERFEMALE:Buffaloed.
LEADFEMALE: Hello.
SUPFEMALE:"Dear Mallory," it's for you.
LEADMALE: - 
LEADFEMALE:I got it.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:"Dear Mallory"? -  Oh, Mallory, am I glad to see you.
LEADMALE:You've got to help me.
LEADMALE:You look tired.
LEADFEMALE: I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:How many letters have you answered tonight, hmm? How many phone calls? Oh, I stopped counting after a hundred.
LEADMALE:You're doing way too much.
SUPMALE:I can't believe how many hours you're putting in on this.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, I've been working hard.
LEADFEMALE:But it's worth it.
LEADMALE:When you're in the public eye, as I am, your time just isn't your own.
SUPFEMALE:You're so lucky to be a complete unknown, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I don't I don't like to brag about it.
LEADFEMALE:Â¡Hola! Hey! - Hi, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, how people can say economics majors are dull is beyond me.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight, we watched reruns of The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.
LEADMALE:Then we started quoting from Adam Smith.
SUPFEMALE:At random.
OTHERMALE:And we finished up the night by dancing on the table and shouting out commodities prices.
LEADFEMALE:I'm surprised the cops didn't bust in on you.
SUPFEMALE:How many times do I have to throw this thing out?  Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, this is she.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:No, talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, she's your mother and she deserves that respect.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Remember, we're always here for you.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:That's very good advice, by the way.
LEADMALE: It's instinctive, Mom.
SUPMALE:Flows right out of me.
OTHERFEMALE:It's like there's this little voice inside my brain saying "Boy, you can see for miles in here!"  
LEADMALE:I got it! Hey, Mal, Mal, this is getting a little out of hand.
OTHERMALE:You're giving marital advice now? Oh, Mom, the column's been expanded.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm giving marriage advice, legal advice.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doing surgery through the mail.
SUPMALE:Mal, telephone for you.
LEADFEMALE:It's someone calling himself "Fed Up Freddie.
SUPFEMALE:" I told him it's a little late to be calling, but he says he really needs to speak to you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, is he annoying.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, tell him it is too late to call, but he can come to the open house tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:What what open house? Well, I figured it would be a good idea to have a, um an open house one night a week.
SUPFEMALE:That way I can deal with them one-on-one.
LEADFEMALE: Uh, listen, Freddie? She, uh she can't come to the phone right now.
OTHERFEMALE:But there's an open house tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Don't start with me, Freddie.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, I'm fed up with you, too! Mallory, I I honestly don't know how you handle these people! I-I find it completely exasperating! Dear "Disturbed Dad," if you let the little things in life bother you, you lose sight of what you really have how much you mean to your family.
LEADFEMALE:She's good.
LEADMALE:She's very good.
OTHERMALE:I feel better.
SUPFEMALE: It's really going well, Alex.
OTHERMALE:So many people showed up, and I think we really helped a lot of them.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, uh, I've kept my area tidy.
LEADFEMALE:Look, there are only about 15 more minutes.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should start moving people towards the door? All right, Mom, I'll, uh I'll get out the big net.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, enjoy yourself tonight, Skipper? - Uh, actually, I'm a little overwhelmed, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:You see Well, I-I couldn't really decide what problem of mine to focus on.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, well, I've been kind of hanging around the "Generally Nuts" area most of the night.
LEADMALE:You can't go wrong there, Skip.
SUPMALE: - Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, hello.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Andrea Neff.
LEADMALE:Are you "Dear Mallory"? Yes, but our open house is almost over.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:I can't even time my problems right.
LEADMALE:I was hoping to have my crisis earlier, like usual, but wouldn't you know it, tonight I got off to a late start.
LEADFEMALE:My kitchen blew up.
LEADFEMALE:Let me help.
LEADFEMALE: Uh, excuse me, uh, Miss.
LEADMALE:Why don't you, uh, just have a seat right by this sign.
SUPMALE:Someone will be around to help you soon.
LEADMALE:Um, what seems to be your problem, Andrea? Well, you-you don't know me as Andrea.
LEADMALE:You know me as "First Love.
LEADFEMALE:" "Fi" Yes! Hi! I-I've been waiting to hear from you! How did it go? Did you talk to your boyfriend? Yes, um, I You know, could you move this? Oh, God I-I talked to him.
SUPFEMALE:And? Did you confront him like I said? Were you firm with him? Tell me everything.
LEADMALE:Well, I-I did just what you said.
SUPMALE:I-I looked him right in the eye and I said, "Billy, are you seeing another woman?" And he said, "No, I'm not.
LEADMALE:"But I hate being accused by you and I never want to see you again.
OTHERMALE:" Oh, that's not good.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't think so either, but I-I wanted a professional opinion.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you gonna fix it? Um I don't think I can.
SUPMALE:If I'd have come earlier, could you have fixed it?  Look, maybe you're better off this way.
OTHERMALE:I mean, maybe he wasn't the right guy for you.
SUPMALE:If he's so willing to leave you - just because you asked him a question.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't mind questions.
LEADFEMALE:It was just that one that really bugged him.
LEADFEMALE:Um, maybe you need to find another guy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, there are plenty of them out there.
LEADMALE: Oh, for you.
LEADMALE:Look at you, you're gorgeous it's easy for you to say, "Cut him loose," but not for me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean Look at you and look at me! I-I'm not in a position to make a stand like that.
LEADMALE:How could you give me that advice? It was the best advice I had to give.
LEADMALE:I-I just tried - I'm Mallory's mother, and she was trying to help you, believe me.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you know? You're gorgeous, too.
LEADFEMALE:You're all gorgeous! I mean Do you have any idea what it's like being me? Well, I might.
SUPFEMALE:D-Do you know what it's like sitting by the phone - praying for it to ring? - Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you know how it feels to have a blind date show up at your door and say, "I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:There must be some mistake.
LEADFEMALE:" And he runs off? Yes.
LEADMALE:Do you know what it's like to go to the prom as a as a hatcheck girl? Yes.

LEADMALE:I'm sorry to bother you.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Andrea! Wait up! You've been telling us about your academic and, uh, social problems for let's see two and a half hours now.
LEADFEMALE:And you know what's amazing? I haven't really scratched the surface.
LEADMALE:That's our sense of it, too.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not like you guys have said anything.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean Can you give me some advice? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Go home.
SUPMALE:It's good advice, Skip.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Hey, boy, these lovelorn people sure eat a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Finished all the dip.
SUPMALE:Gouged the bowl a little, too.
OTHERMALE:What a night! I never heard so many problems, saw so many tears.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe how many times I said, "Would you like a Kleenex?" - Hi.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Would you like a Kleenex? Did you catch up with her? Finally.
LEADMALE:I tell you, this girl had some problems.
SUPMALE:Speed was not one of 'em.
SUPMALE:Well, what did you say to her? - Mom, I mean, there was there was really nothing to say, you know? I apologized.
SUPFEMALE:But what could I do? I-I can't believe the way this turned out.
LEADMALE:All I wanted was for her to be happy, for them all to be happy.
LEADMALE:That's so much like you, honey; it really is.
LEADMALE:I was really foolish, Mom.
LEADMALE:I was really in love with the idea that I could help these people, that that they'd turn to me for help, you know? I got carried away.
LEADMALE:Well, you did get carried away, but you don't want to stifle that noble impulse.
LEADFEMALE:It's such a beautiful quality, honey.
SUPMALE:Mom, I mean, look at these letters.
OTHERMALE:I mean, can you believe the subjects I was trying to give advice on? Marriage, aging agriculture.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, even as a very little girl you were always like that, Mal.
LEADMALE:So sweet and caring, always so so sensitive to other people's feelings.
LEADFEMALE:I remember one time you came home all upset and teary-eyed.
OTHERMALE:You couldn't have been more than five, five and a half.
SUPMALE:You said, "Dad, Skippy's hamsters are biting each other.
OTHERMALE:" Oh, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:"And the lady hamster's biting the man more than the man's biting the lady.
SUPFEMALE:" And I said, "Well, uh, maybe that's what hamsters do.
LEADFEMALE:" You said, "How could that be? "They're supposed to love each other.
LEADMALE:I have to have a talk with that lady hamster.
LEADMALE:" And the next day you went and talked to the lady hamster and you came back home and said, uh, "Dad, they stopped biting each other!" I said, "Good for you, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:" You said, "Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Now they're biting Skippy.
LEADMALE:" I love a happy ending.
LEADMALE:I wish I'd remembered that story.
LEADMALE:I might have stayed out of the lovelorn business.
OTHERMALE:Now, don't be so hard on yourself.
SUPFEMALE:You made some mistakes, but, hey, you gave some good advice.
LEADMALE:Look, here "Dear Mallory, my friends have moved, "my relatives don't talk to me, my husband left me.
LEADFEMALE:What should I do? Signed, 'Desperately Lonely.
SUPFEMALE:"' Now, what did "Dear Mallory" reply? Here, uh, "Dear Lonely, do yourself a favor.

OTHERMALE:Sounds more like a practical joke than a job.
LEADMALE:Come on, Nick.
LEADMALE:Show 'em how you do it.
LEADMALE:Uh, uh, uh, uh, all right, but I have to follow this standard procedure here.

OTHERMALE:Wall Street Week is starting.
LEADFEMALE:He's gonna miss it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERFEMALE:They wouldn't start without him.
SUPMALE:It's a special show about coin collecting.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe he forgot it was on.
SUPMALE:What am I saying? He has to see it.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to the coin fair on Saturday.
LEADMALE:Why don't you go in and start watching, and when Alex gets here, he'll join you.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no! That's not how it works.
OTHERMALE:We always watch it from the beginning.
SUPFEMALE:We like to sing the theme song.
LEADMALE:Um, well, here, I'll-I'll watch it with you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Lauren.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Alex, you're late for Wall Street Week.
LEADMALE:Andy's in there waiting for you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Couldn't be helped, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Couldn't be helped.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a big psychology lecture.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't want to miss it.
LEADFEMALE:You know me.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:What was it about? A favorite professor of mine was lecturing on the cognitive powers of African baboons.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, it sounds interesting.
LEADFEMALE:Why was Alex there? Because I'm a very supportive boyfriend, Mom.
SUPMALE:Lauren's interests are my interests.
SUPFEMALE:She wanted me to be there, so I went.
LEADMALE:Means a lot to her.
SUPMALE:I'm impressed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm kidding.
SUPMALE:I'm kidding.
SUPFEMALE:I'm kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, hurry! Wall Street Week is starting! Ooh, listen, uh, I'm going to skip it today, okay, pal? But I already made the popcorn, and the cash register's all heated up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, uh, you know, Lauren's here, so But we always watch it together.
LEADMALE:Well, I know we do, but, uh, Lauren's not always here.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, she is.
SUPMALE:So, Lauren, how-how's your psychology study coming? Oh, I think it's going very Oh, very, very well.
SUPMALE:Very well.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, she's doing a fantastic job.
LEADFEMALE:Have you decided to have Alex committed yet? Want to go in the other room and play, Alex? No, not-not not right now, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:But we always play before dinner.
SUPMALE:I know, I know, Andy, but we don't always have company.
SUPMALE:You know, Lauren, I was reading a little Jung yesterday, and I was really fascinated by his use of dreams in psychoanalysis.
SUPMALE:Can you analyze dreams? Can she analyze dreams? She she's like Carnac.
LEADMALE:Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, show 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:Analyze something.
LEADFEMALE:You know, um I had a dream last night.
LEADMALE:I I, uh I-I did, I did.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh I I was walking down the street, and suddenly, I noticed, um, I didn't have any clothes on.
LEADFEMALE:That's gross, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:S-So, I just, uh I just ran around, hiding behind cars, trying to find my clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Was I in this dream? Um, well, yes you were.
LEADMALE:You were playing racquetball with Dwight Eisenhower.
LEADMALE:But, but, oh let's-let's stick to my part.
SUPFEMALE:Uh What do you make of this, Lauren? Is there any hope for my dad? Well, dream analysis is very complex.
LEADMALE:Um but if I had to take an educated guess, I would say that this dream shows that your Dad's trying to hide something.
SUPFEMALE:And there's a part of him he doesn't want anyone to see, which is probably why he has that beard.
LEADMALE:Or maybe not.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no - I'm just a student! - No, no, that's fine.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I can be completely wrong.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I know I am.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're No, you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Obviously.
LEADMALE:How about this, Lauren? Is she my little Miss Freud or what? And she can take a perfectly innocent-looking dream about a man running around naked while his wife plays racquetball with a former president, and use it to prove that that same man has deep-seated abnormalities.
LEADFEMALE:Abnormali? What's abnormal? - All I did was look for my clothes! - 
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Steven, uh, Steven, can-can we talk about this in private? Of course! Of cour Why? Are you worried? Well, I It's I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I-I I just want you to tell me what / was wearing.
SUPFEMALE:A lovely sunflowered tennis dress.
LEADMALE:Uh, ruffles; very pretty.
LEADFEMALE:And-and President Eisenhower? The same dress.
SUPFEMALE:And were you furious! Time to play yet? Uh, uh, no, no, not yet, Andy.
LEADMALE:I had a dream.
LEADFEMALE:It was really weird.
LEADFEMALE:I I was in the mall, and, uh, and I went into my favorite store, and I bought this I bought this really beautiful red leather jacket that I've wanted for the last two months.
LEADMALE:What do you think that could mean? I think it means you really wanted to buy the jacket.
OTHERMALE:Wow! I Uh, hello.

SUPMALE:Bowman.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Nick Moore, and I really want to sell you Ah! Thought I had him there for a minute.

LEADMALE:Yeah, we'll see you.
LEADMALE:We'll see you.
OTHERFEMALE:Have a good time.

SUPFEMALE:Now I'm really depressed.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, how are you feeling, Andy? Hi, Andy.
SUPMALE:Andy don't worry about Alex.

LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry things didn't work out at Playland.
OTHERFEMALE:Me, too.

LEADMALE:What does she have that I don't have? I'm gonna be honest with you, Andy.
LEADMALE:A lot.

LEADMALE:We do that, too.
LEADMALE:She eats all her vegetables and she goes to bed on time.
LEADFEMALE:She wins.
LEADMALE:Look, Andy it's not a matter of winning or losing in this case but only in this case.
SUPFEMALE:You just have to understand that I can care about about you and Lauren at the same time, it doesn't make me love you any less.
SUPMALE:It doesn't? - Look we're still gonna spend time together.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, we're still gonna have fun.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just that now, you know, you're gonna have to share me with Lauren.
LEADFEMALE:Share?! I know, normally I'm against it but you're just gonna have to trust me on this one, all right? All right.
SUPMALE:Look, Andy, I'm sorry that I haven't paid much attention to you lately.
LEADMALE:And I know you want me to know I know you must've been pretty upset to do what you did.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, Alex, I just miss you.
LEADFEMALE:I miss the old days.
LEADFEMALE:Hey I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Mm! Listen do me one favor? I want you to try and be friends with Lauren.
OTHERMALE:Okay? 'Cause she really wants to be friends with you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Now, she's outside and she told me that she really wants to see your room.
LEADMALE:All right? Okay, now, remember, you're the host here.
SUPFEMALE:You got to try to make her feel comfortable.
LEADFEMALE:Got it? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to my room.
SUPFEMALE:How am I doing, Alex? Keep it coming, keep it coming.
SUPMALE:I brought you something.
OTHERMALE:What? - Thought you might be thirsty.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:So this is your room, huh? I like it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, teddy bears.
SUPFEMALE:Do you like teddy bears? I don't know, do you? Yes, I like them very much.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this is my story time.
LEADMALE:Alex reads me stories.
SUPFEMALE:All right, well, I'll leave you two guys alone.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, wait, maybe he can read to both of us.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, sure.
SUPMALE:Okay, climb up, climb up.
LEADMALE:All right, this is a good story.
SUPFEMALE:This is a good story.
LEADFEMALE:Chapter one.
SUPMALE:"Deferring Income to the Next Tax Year"
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:"And then Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Reagan said "Oh, look, Mommy, "it's Secretary of State it's Secretary of State George Schultz.
SUPFEMALE:" Boy, Andrew, this Love Republicans pop-up book was the best purchase I ever made.
OTHERMALE:Make Nancy wave again.
SUPMALE: "Hi.
LEADMALE:" Thanks for carrying my books home, Simon.
LEADFEMALE:I'd carry these books to the ends of the earth for you, my dearest.
LEADMALE:The counter will be fine.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, I've been Who's the guy? That's my brother.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE: Don't encourage him, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, it was really nice of you to carry my books home and all, but I really think you should be going now.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, I've been in love with you ever since I spotted you across the crowded auditorium during that school bus safety assembly.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, that was a powerful moment.
SUPMALE:Tell me you love me.
OTHERFEMALE:Yuck! I can't take this.
LEADFEMALE:We can't keep going on like this.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're just not my type.
SUPFEMALE:It's because I'm a nerd, isn't it? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe this would change your mind.
LEADFEMALE:Diamonds.
LEADFEMALE: Go for it.
LEADMALE:Go for it.
SUPFEMALE:Simon, you shouldn't have done that.
LEADMALE:No, no, it's okay, my mother won't miss them.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, I'm not going to accept your mother's earrings! How about her brooch.
SUPFEMALE:Simon, forget it! Will you go with me to the sophomore dance? Simon, I said no, all right? 
LEADMALE:I-I'm not leaving until you - give me at least a maybe.
LEADMALE:Okay, maybe.
LEADFEMALE:Really? - No! Please, please, please? Don't make me beg.
LEADMALE:All right maybe.
SUPMALE:Boy, Simon, this is about as much fun as a bloodletting.
LEADFEMALE:I am one step closer to paradise.
LEADFEMALE:Until later, my love.
OTHERMALE:Geez, Jen, you know, you really shouldn't lead the guy on like that.
OTHERMALE:Come on, give him a break, will you? Go to the dance with him.
SUPMALE:Alex, he's a nerd.
SUPMALE:It's true but he's a nerd bearing gifts.
SUPMALE:Who's that guy I saw skipping across the front lawn? Oh, that was Simon.
LEADMALE:A young gentleman suitor that I think Jennifer should consider going out with.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, he's a nerd.
LEADFEMALE:He gave her diamond earrings.
OTHERFEMALE:He did have a certain charm.
LEADMALE:I don't need this kind of pressure.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, being in high school by itself is hard enough.
LEADMALE:Oh, stop! What is so hard about high school? High school wasn't that hard for me.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but she actually goes into the classroom.
SUPMALE:I can't believe the social pressures in high school.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it's not enough just to be smart anymore.
SUPMALE:Now you have to worry about what you wear, who you hang out with, who you date.
SUPFEMALE:That's what I loved about high school your outward appearance is everything.
LEADMALE:Boy, oh, boy, the streets are getting dangerous.
LEADMALE:We almost got plowed down by this kid skipping down the middle of the street.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's Simon.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, it's Jennifer's new boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE: Oh! - He is not my boyfriend.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even like him.
LEADMALE:He likes Jen.
LEADMALE:He offered her diamond earrings.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, things have sure changed since I was in high school.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, there is this boy I kind of like in high school.
LEADMALE:His name is Roger, he's a sophomore, and a total, unmitigated hunk.
LEADFEMALE: Really? Have you talked with him? - Actually, he talked to me.
LEADMALE: He's gonna be at the sophomore dance on Friday night.
LEADFEMALE:Are you gonna go? I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not a sophomore.
OTHERMALE:I'll probably have to go to the dumb freshman dance.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong with that? You are a freshman, aren't you? Dad, you can't go to your own class dance.
OTHERMALE:That's so embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, of course, I forgot.
LEADMALE:Why not? Because it's just not done, that's all.
LEADMALE:I mean, girls have to aspire to something bigger than their own class dance.
LEADMALE:The freshman girls go to the sophomore dance, the sophomores go to the junior dance, the juniors go to the senior dance, and the seniors, well, they hang out at the Jack in the Box.
LEADFEMALE: Hi, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the matter? You look kind of down.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, the sophomore dance is only two days away, and no one's asked me to go yet.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to go.
LEADFEMALE:I just have to.
SUPMALE:Roger's gonna be there.
SUPFEMALE:He smiled near me today.
OTHERFEMALE:How close? Eight lockers away.
LEADMALE:That's meaningful.
LEADMALE:There's nothing like a smile from a hunk.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:It's even better than when you walk into your classroom and you see a movie projector set up.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to go, Mal.
OTHERMALE:Well, look, you could crash it.
SUPMALE:I'd be too scared to.
OTHERFEMALE:You could go with Simon.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, but then I'd have to ditch him right when I got there.
SUPMALE:I just couldn't do that.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I guess not.
OTHERFEMALE:What? What? Couldn't do what? This is not your area, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Hey, how do you know? Because it involves feelings, thought and emotions of a nonmonetary nature.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Jen, I know how important this is to you, right? So I'm gonna go upstairs, put my mind to it, and I won't come back until I have an answer.
OTHERFEMALE:We're never gonna see her again.
SUPMALE:What's the problem? Don't tell me teen problems, right? You need braces.
SUPFEMALE:Not exactly.
OTHERFEMALE:You, uh want a phone in your room.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Need your ears pierced? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you haven't got any teen problems.
SUPMALE:Alex, there's this guy at school Roger.
OTHERFEMALE:Whenever I see him in the hallway, I get this kind of light feeling in my stomach.
LEADFEMALE:Do you ever get that way? It's kind of an excitement bordering on nausea? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Whenever I hear the words "tax-free.
LEADFEMALE:" I don't know what happens to me.
LEADMALE:I-I get so I get nervous, I freeze up.
LEADFEMALE:I can't even speak.
SUPFEMALE:I know the feeling, I'm telling you.
LEADMALE:If Roger were tax-free, we'd both be deeply in love.
LEADFEMALE:But Roger doesn't even know I'm alive.
SUPFEMALE:Meanwhile, Simon won't stop bugging me to go to the dance with him.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, I like that Simon.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you, he compensates for his complete lack of coordination, poise and social grace with expensive gifts.
LEADFEMALE:Got to love the guy.
LEADMALE:Alex, do you think it's okay to manipulate Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't finish my question yet.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, it doesn't matter.
LEADMALE:As a general rule, manipulation is a great way to go.
OTHERMALE:But what if it might hurt a person? If you do it right, nobody gets hurt.
LEADMALE:All right, I'll give you an example, okay? Santa Claus.
LEADFEMALE:Right? Nice guy, right? He's cute, yeah.
SUPMALE:Now, there he is every Christmas, whipping toys down chimneys every kid's dream.
LEADMALE:Now, he thinks he's doing it to make all the little boys and girls happy.
SUPMALE:What he doesn't realize is that he's just a sales rep for Mattel.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about, Alex? He's a pawn! He's a pawn for the big toy conglomerates.
OTHERMALE:He's a big, chubby, ruddy-faced pawn.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it.
LEADMALE:Jen, Santa is being completely manipulated by the toy companies.
SUPMALE:But-but-but he's, you know, flying around with his reindeer, he's chuggin' eggnog, he's having the yuletide time of his life.
LEADMALE:There's only one small flaw in your theory, Alex.
SUPFEMALE: Yeah? What's that, Jen? Santa Claus doesn't exist.
SUPMALE:  
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? Santa Claus he doesn't exist.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I hate when people say that.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you knew.
LEADFEMALE:That's all right, that's all right.
LEADMALE:I try to give a little pep talk in favor of manipulation, and I get my feelings crushed.
LEADMALE:It'll work, Jen, okay? Just trust me.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Simon.
LEADFEMALE:This is Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'll go to the dance with you.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Simon? Are you okay? Hey, honey, what do you have? Oh, nothing much.
OTHERFEMALE:Just a dress.
SUPMALE:I borrowed it from my friend Jane.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, let me see this.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, this is not just a dress, this is a Jocometti original in an iridescent emerald green cloquÃ© from the Rive Gauche Resort Collection, circa 1984.
SUPFEMALE:Mal, how is it humanly possible for you to have all that in your head and nothing else? Jennifer, what is this for? Nothing much this, that; I'll wear it around the house, maybe to the sophomore dance.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're going! That's great.
LEADFEMALE:Who's the lucky boy? Oh, um no one you know.
OTHERMALE: Uh, what's his name? Anthony Quinn.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Zorba? Isn't he a little old for you? All right, it's Simon.
LEADMALE:Si well, I-I thought you didn't like Simon.
OTHERFEMALE:I kind of don't.
SUPFEMALE:Then why are you going with him? Because Alex told me to.
LEADMALE: Oh Now, wait a minute Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Don't blame me.
LEADFEMALE:I'd rather you'd go for Zorba.
LEADFEMALE:All right! I'm going with Simon because I want to go to the sophomore dance, and that's the only way I can get in.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, once I'm there, anything can happen.
LEADMALE:I might bump into Roger.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Jen, I'm-I'm really surprised at you! I mean, you-you must realize what you're doing.
SUPMALE:You're just using Simon to get to Roger.
SUPMALE:Look, this isn't as one-sided as it seems.
LEADFEMALE:If I go out with Simon, he'll be happy.
LEADMALE:He'll stop bugging me, calling me all the time, coming over.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, it's not that big of a deal.
OTHERMALE:Simon doesn't care about me that much anyway.
LEADFEMALE: It's just Oh, no? Simon! What are you doing? Oh, I just wanted to say that Who's the guy? That's my father.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton? - Fine.
LEADFEMALE:It is such a thrill.
SUPMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:What, um? Oh don't worry about that, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It's not what it looks like.
LEADMALE:I mean, it is a cake.
SUPMALE:It's all they had left at the bakery.
SUPFEMALE:That's a relief.
LEADMALE:I always believed that I would meet a girl like you one day.
LEADFEMALE:A girl who saw past what everyone else saw and really liked me.
LEADMALE:Really liked the me in me.
OTHERMALE:Congratulations on being that girl, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:But Simon, I - Shh.
OTHERFEMALE:Not another word, my sweet.
SUPMALE:I just want you to know that if I die at this very moment, I will die happy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! You still happy?  A little dizzy, but still happy.
SUPMALE:All right, Andrew, you're really coming along with your reading.
OTHERFEMALE:Very proud of you.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:I owe it all to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, let's not get mushy.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:What is this word right here? - "Impeach.
SUPFEMALE:" - 
OTHERFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Isn't that sweet? It really is.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, sometimes I think we're too harsh on Alex.
LEADFEMALE:He-he's not just a callous, arch-conservative Republican.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes, he can be a-a warm, loving son and brother.
LEADMALE:Okay, now read this one with me, okay? 
LEADMALE:"I am not a crook.
LEADMALE:" Hey! Hey! Hey! What? Whatever happened to books like, uh, The Little Engine that Could, or The Cat in the Hat, or The Grinch that Stole Christmas? This Come on, Dad, this is real reading! Besides, those other books they scare kids.
LEADMALE:Give 'em nightmares.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, what's scarier the Grinch, or, uh, or-or a little pop-up Richard Nixon? It's hard to say.
LEADFEMALE:They look so much alike.
LEADMALE: I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Simon.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Oh, my, my! Aren't you aren't you dapper? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's a rental.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Ajax Rent-A-Tux.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you know? Well, you've got the bill pinned to your back.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:So-so, you you've also rented shoes, socks and glasses.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nothing's too good for your little girl, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, follow me.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE: What? I want everyone to see my latest gift to my beloved Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:Look up there.
OTHERMALE:What? - What is it? It's a love message in skywriting.
LEADMALE:"Happy birthday Juanita.
LEADFEMALE:" - I got a deal.
LEADFEMALE:That's nice.
SUPFEMALE: It's lovely.
SUPFEMALE:It's muy bueno.
LEADMALE:Muy bueno.
LEADMALE:You know, Simon, I like your style.
LEADFEMALE:You're really starting to grow on me.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm really worried about it.
OTHERMALE: Ah.
LEADMALE:Jennifer's wearing a Jocometti original in an iridescent emerald green cloquÃ© from the Rive Gauche Resort Collection, circa 1984, borrowed from Jane.
SUPMALE: Yeah Well, Simon, what do you think? There.
LEADMALE:That's better.
SUPMALE: Whoa! Look out! I'll catch - Simon.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, buddy.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE: Do you want to dance? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Why would I want to dance? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I mean, it is called the sophomore dance, not the sophomore stand-around.
OTHERFEMALE: - Oh, hi, Jen.
LEADMALE:Hi, Nancy.
OTHERFEMALE:Jen, this is Brad Hallahan, my date.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Brad.
SUPMALE:Nice to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:This is Simon.
SUPMALE:What's your last name? Wickerson.
LEADFEMALE:Simon Wickerson.
SUPFEMALE:Simon Wickerson? Don't I know you? Didn't I beat you up last week? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:But I could pencil you in for next Wednesday, if you like.
SUPFEMALE:Now, are you sure? I'd never forget a face like that.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry to disappoint you.
SUPFEMALE:It's all right.
LEADFEMALE:If you're sure.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, see you later, Jen, Simon.
LEADMALE: Bye.
SUPMALE:So, then, we're on for next Wednesday, right?  It's him! It's him! Who him? - Let's dance.
SUPFEMALE:But you just said  Hey! Hey! Yeah! Hi! Hi.
LEADMALE:Do I know you? I've seen you around.
SUPMALE:Hey, who's your date? No one.
LEADMALE:Uh, he must have stepped out for a minute.
LEADFEMALE: - I I'll introduce you when he comes back.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer.
LEADMALE:This is your date? Hey, didn't I beat you up last week? Yeah, you did, as a matter of fact.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yeah, I really enjoyed it.
LEADFEMALE:Are you free on Wednesday? No, no, I'm all booked up on Wednesday.
SUPMALE:Oh, but perhaps I could fit you in after the holidays.
OTHERFEMALE:He's not really my date.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I'm available, if you'd like to dance or something.
SUPMALE:What makes you think I'd want to dance with you? Come on, Roger.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing hanging around these dorks? Dorks? Hey, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:There's only one dork here.
SUPFEMALE:That's me.
LEADFEMALE:This is Jennifer Keaton.
SUPMALE:She is once, twice, three times a lady.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute didn't I beat you up last week? You did, as a matter of fact.
LEADMALE:You know, you two could get the group rate if you wanted.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Roger, let's dance.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:Why did you say that? Why did you say I wasn't your date? Simon, I only came here with you so I could get into the sophomore dance.
LEADFEMALE: You mean, you-you just used me for my s-sophomoreness? I thought you were different than all the others, Jennifer.
OTHERMALE:I thought you were smarter.
LEADMALE:Well, you're not.
OTHERMALE:Boy, will you be sorry when I grow into my looks.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, big fella, time to go to sleep.
LEADMALE:I don't want to go to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Well, everybody in the White House is going to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, they're not.
LEADMALE:Oh, no? Listen to this.
SUPMALE: Well, Nancy I'm really sleepy after a long day of punishing naughty Democrats.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, Nancy.
SUPMALE:Good night, Admiral Poindexter.
LEADMALE:Good night, Ollie.
LEADFEMALE:And so ends another night of Toddler Republican Theater.
LEADFEMALE:It's way past your bedtime, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:It's awfully late.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I stayed awake longer than President Reagan.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's no great feat, uh, Andy.
LEADMALE:Come on, Andy.
LEADMALE:I'll take you upstairs and read you something normal.
OTHERMALE:I've got just the thing.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, no, no, no, no you're not reading to him from the Bloomingdale's catalog again.
LEADFEMALE:If anybody wants me, I'll be upstairs trying to piece together the shattered fragments of my tragic high school existence.
OTHERMALE:What happened? It was a complete disaster, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Simon found out that I only went with him to the sophomore dance to meet up with Roger.
LEADMALE:And to top that off, Roger was horrible to me.
OTHERMALE:He was mean.
LEADFEMALE:He was rude.
OTHERMALE:He treated me like Like, uh like you treated Simon.
SUPMALE:I hate to say this when you're when you're already hurting, honey, but what you did wasn't right.
SUPFEMALE:I-I I think you know that.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what happened.
LEADMALE:Somehow, Simon's feelings didn't seem important.
LEADFEMALE:It was almost like I didn't think he had feelings.
LEADFEMALE:He really cares about you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know how I didn't see that.
SUPFEMALE:It was hard to miss.
LEADFEMALE:The skywriting was a sure tip-off.
LEADMALE:I feel so terrible.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, even after I was mean to Simon, he stood up for me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I can ever look him in the eye again.
LEADFEMALE:Did you at least have a chance to apologize to him? I tried, but he ran off so fast, I couldn't catch him.
SUPMALE: Oh, well, honey, now is your chance.
LEADFEMALE:If you want to talk later, we'll be upstairs, huh? ELYSE 
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hi, Jen.
LEADMALE:Hi, Simon.
LEADMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:I don't have long.
OTHERFEMALE:The tux has to be back by midnight.
LEADMALE:It's only rented for three hours.
SUPFEMALE:I looked all over for you.
SUPFEMALE:Where'd you go? I went across to the freshman dance.
OTHERMALE:There was no one there.
OTHERMALE:So I danced with Miss Polniki, the school nutritionist.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Simon, I'm really sorry what happened tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I shouldn't have done what I did.
LEADFEMALE:It was mean.
LEADMALE:But believe me, I got a big dose of mean right back.
LEADFEMALE:Could you ever forgive me? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Yes.
SUPMALE:I forgive you.
LEADMALE:I see you for what you are.
LEADMALE:Not what you were at the dance, but what you are right now.
LEADMALE:Know why? Because I am highly evolved.
LEADFEMALE:So, then, we can start over, right? I mean, just as friends.
LEADMALE:It would be a lot cheaper.
SUPFEMALE:See, I had a great time tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to be seen at the dance with you.
LEADMALE:It did a world of good for my prestige.
SUPFEMALE:And it was a real honor for me.
SUPFEMALE:Believe me, Simon, the honor was all mine.
OTHERMALE:You are one of the sweetest, nicest guys I'll ever go out with.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how'd you like an ankle bracelet? It's my Mom's, but I think I can get it off her leg.
SUPMALE:She's a heavy sleeper.
OTHERMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hon.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Did you, uh, creep out of bed at 3:00 this morning or was I dreaming? Oh, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I didn't mean to waken you.
LEADFEMALE:I had a good idea for the Hammond Building, and I wanted to go down and work on it.
OTHERMALE:Elyse, that's the fourth night in a row you've gone down to work on that.
LEADMALE:Wouldn't it be easier to bring the Hammond Building into bed with us? I went down to add glass panels to the lobby.
SUPMALE:It's done, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:I have finished it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, am I glad to hear that! - Congratulations! - Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I've missed you.
LEADMALE:I've missed you, too.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if you keep that up, you're gonna become fused at the lips.
OTHERFEMALE:You're gonna have to be separated surgically, and I don't think Blue Cross covers that.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Great news, Alex.
LEADMALE:Good morning, honey.
LEADMALE:Your mother's finished the Hammond Building.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great, Mom, just minutes before it finished us.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know it's been a struggle for everybody lately, but I want you to know everything's gonna lighten up from now on.
LEADMALE:Ah, yeah, well, we've heard that before, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Somehow I-I feel there are bigger and more time-consuming Hammond Buildings lurking out there in our future.
OTHERMALE:I feel other buildings lurking out there, too.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, now, take a look.
SUPFEMALE:See? According to my daily planner Huh? Week at a Glance Month at a Glance.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Alex, you might enjoy one of these.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Mommy, that's not for me.
LEADMALE:No, I need Decade at a Glance.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, gang.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Good for you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, with my toothbrush.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least he brushed.
LEADMALE:Next time use Mallory's brush, okay? No, I used hers to clean my ant farm.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, can you pick up Andy after school today? Oh, I can't today, hon.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, it's your turn, isn't it? Well, yeah, but I have that A.
OTHERFEMALE:S.
OTHERFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:Luncheon, and I really don't want to miss it.
LEADMALE:I've got a big budget meeting today down at the station.
SUPMALE:PBS budget meeting? Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:What do they do there? They just, like, throw loose change on the floor? Everybody dives for it? I could cancel it, Elyse.
LEADMALE:No, no, it's-it's my responsibility.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, could you pick him up? I have midterms, Mom.
LEADMALE:And, uh although it boggles the mind, I actually have to study.
SUPMALE:Well, I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:My Advanced Fashion class is going on a Comparative Fabrics field trip.
LEADMALE:A Comparative Fabrics field trip? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:We're going shopping.
SUPMALE:I got it.
LEADFEMALE:At lunchtime, I'll buy a car.
OTHERMALE:I know how to drive.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex taught me.
OTHERFEMALE:Shh Have you been letting him drive? Once.
SUPFEMALE:In an open field on a farm.
OTHERMALE:Left turn, right turn.
LEADFEMALE:Watch out for the cow! Oh, I got it.
OTHERFEMALE:I got it.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi, Lauren.
LEADMALE:Lauren, can I ask you a question? - It's kind of personal.
SUPMALE:Sure, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Do you actually like him or is this relationship part of a bizarre psychology study? Well, it's a little of both.
SUPMALE:Lauren, I know I have no right to ask you this, but could you pick up Andy after school today? Oh, you have every right to ask, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton, but I have appointments scheduled all afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Join the club.
LEADFEMALE:I just feel so guilty.
LEADFEMALE:There's so much to do, and there's not enough time to do it in.
LEADFEMALE:You really shouldn't feel guilty.
SUPFEMALE:You know, a confident, loving mother like you is gonna - bring up a happy, well-adjusted Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Worked for me.
LEADMALE:Well, it's just a theory.
SUPFEMALE:There he is, the sweetest little boy in the world and no one can pick him up from school, so he says, "That's okay, everybody's done enough I'll just stay at school.

OTHERMALE:I-I don't really mean that.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes things get so out of hand, I want to scream.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead and scream.

OTHERFEMALE:And for all the right reasons.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? Well, you're rude, you're just a little bit pushy Slow down.

LEADMALE:Now, I was so worried I just came home.
SUPMALE:And here we are.
SUPMALE:Well, Steven, I thought you were planning on picking him up today.
SUPFEMALE:I-I thought you were.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADFEMALE:It's fine.

LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.

LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, who said they were picking up Andy today, me or your dad? It's not important, Elyse.

OTHERMALE:Oh, really? Well, we're all here.
OTHERMALE:That's what counts.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:And we'll never have another mix-up - like that again, Andy.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You see, your mom and I have both been pretty busy lately, but that's gonna lighten up a little.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, first of all, I had a big budget meeting today and it went great.
LEADMALE:You guys were able to make change for that dollar? Secondly, your mother has finished the Hammond Building, and things are gonna lighten up a little for her, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Mom, how did Norback like the Hammond Building? - He loved it.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, great.
SUPMALE:That's great, honey.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, actually, as a kind of reward, uh, he offered me the Diamond Resorts International account.
LEADFEMALE:Three high-rises.
LEADMALE:I said yes.
LEADMALE:Really? That's that's great, Mom.
SUPMALE:And, uh, here I thought things were going to, uh, lighten up for you, but, uh, that's how it goes.
SUPFEMALE:Andy, why don't you go on upstairs and play for a little bit, huh? Okay, but let me know how this turns out.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we know we've got a problem here.
LEADMALE:Let's just try and deal with it in a reasonable manner.
LEADFEMALE:I'm nothing if not reasonable.
OTHERMALE:So what do you want me to do, quit?! That's reasonable.
OTHERMALE:No, I don't want you to quit.
LEADMALE:You want someone to quit? You quit.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to quit! Wait, wait, wait.
SUPFEMALE:Which one of you makes more money? What difference does that make? Well, because the other one should quit.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, please.
SUPMALE:Nobody's quitting.
SUPFEMALE:Let me look at your tax returns.
SUPFEMALE:I mean it.
LEADMALE:I can help, and it'll bring us closer together.
LEADMALE:Look, Elyse, I-I'm very happy for you.
LEADMALE:I truly am.
SUPMALE:I-It's a marvelous opportunity.
SUPFEMALE:But, uh I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed.
SUPMALE:Why, fine.
SUPFEMALE:Then-then I'll quit.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give it all up.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, that's what you're saying, is that that's really what you want, isn't it? Elyse, please, you're overtired.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't mean what you're saying.
SUPMALE:No, no, it's-it's fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll quit.
LEADFEMALE:If that's what you want, you got it.
SUPFEMALE:We will turn the clock back.
LEADMALE:We'll go back to the '50s.
LEADMALE:I - Don't say a word, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:This is a magical moment.
SUPMALE:Let's savor it.
SUPFEMALE:Let's hold hands.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not asking that of you, Elyse.
SUPMALE:That's not an answer for us.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't mind.
SUPFEMALE:Let's-let's go back to the fabulous '50s.
LEADFEMALE:I'll put my hair in a beehive, and I'll wear a little string of pearls and a little poodle skirt and I'll cook and I'll clean and when you come home from work, I'll just step out of my hula hoop and I'll serve you up a spectacular dinner, and you can tell me everything that happened in the real world! I'd love that.
SUPMALE:I'd do that for you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:It's settled.
SUPMALE:Did you guys hear Mom and Dad arguing last night? Oh, I wouldn't say they were arguing.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? What are they fighting about? Well, Andy, what we're dealing with here is a very complex male-female issue.
LEADMALE:I know that much, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:See, in the beginning all was well.
LEADMALE:There was harmony, there was balance.
LEADFEMALE:You know, man was the hunter, the provider, the protector.
SUPFEMALE:And woman stayed home, you know, took care of the babies, cooked and cleaned.
LEADMALE:Got an occasional facial.
LEADFEMALE:The latest installment of "The World According to Alex P.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton.
OTHERFEMALE:" I thought we cancelled our subscription.
LEADMALE:It just keeps coming anyway.
LEADFEMALE:All I'm doing here is presenting the facts and that sexual lines have become blurred.
SUPMALE:People are confused, and and if you ask me, it all started with the first woman who went out and got a job Joan of Arc.
OTHERMALE:Alex, really, these revisionist history lessons should be against the law.
LEADFEMALE:Look, if Joan had just stayed home with her hubby, Mr.
LEADMALE:Arc you know, baked him a couple of quiches, maybe she wouldn't have been baked herself.
SUPMALE:You know, Alex, when we were smaller, we had to listen to this.
LEADMALE:But we don't have to listen anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Mal, we can take him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, try it.
LEADFEMALE:Put him in that headlock.
OTHERFEMALE:Put him in that headlock! Oh, great, Alex, hide behind your girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look at you, you-you big brave girls.
LEADMALE:Two against one.
LEADMALE:What's going on? Alex was just explaining to us how the first woman to get a job brought down the world.
SUPMALE:The Joan of Arc story.
SUPMALE:I'm just trying to make a point.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:What point is that? My, you all look lovely today.
LEADFEMALE:Hi there, hi.
LEADMALE:Hi! You guys have a good night's fight uh, sleep? I-I just want you to know that I'm aware of what you guys have been going through.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel a little guilty about this.
OTHERMALE:I realize the past few months I haven't been the greatest mom in the world.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mom, don't say that.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing could be further from the truth.
LEADFEMALE:You're a great mom.
LEADMALE:You've been a wonderful mom Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Keaton.
OTHERFEMALE:And-and if working makes you happy, well, it makes us happy, too.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for your support, it really means a lot to me.
LEADMALE:Oh, by the way, I'm free this afternoon, so I can pick up Andy if it's a problem.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, Lauren, that's really sweet of you, but Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton and I worked out a very interesting plan.
SUPMALE:Andy, uh, your dad's gonna pick you up from school today, and then guess what he's gonna do with you? Lose me? No! No, no, I'm going to bring you to Mommy's office, and then you can help Mommy with her architecture - all afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't it enough that she works? I want you to know that I'm really gonna work hard to make this situation work out.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's-it's gonna be tough, and there'll be a lot of demands on me, on my time and my energy, but I can handle it.
OTHERMALE:I know I can.
LEADFEMALE:It will be tough, but I'm still your mother.
LEADMALE:And I still love you very much.
LEADMALE:And I'll always be there for you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've got to go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really excited that Andy's coming.
LEADMALE:He should be here any minute.
OTHERMALE:You know, Elyse, um, I'm glad your kid's coming and all that, but, um, I have to admit something to you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not that crazy about kids.
SUPMALE:I want kids but I'm not that crazy about them.
SUPFEMALE:Don't have any.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, I want a big family.
SUPFEMALE:Jerry? - What? You ought to lie down on a couch and have someone drill directly into your skull.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? What good would that do? It would kill you.
LEADMALE:Hey, gang, how you doing? - Oh, there they are.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we stopped for ice cream.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, did you really? It was chocolate.
LEADMALE:I've got to go.
OTHERMALE:Um, he's a little tired.
LEADMALE:I think he needs a nap.
LEADMALE:Hey, he can sleep on my desk.
SUPMALE:I'm not using it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm off.
LEADFEMALE:I'd love to hang around and design a bridge with you, but, uh, I don't know how to.
LEADFEMALE:See you later.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:So, how's my boy? I want to go home.
SUPMALE:Well, I did know that a sweet little boy was coming to play here, so I got you some clay.
OTHERFEMALE:You want to make something out of clay? - Yeah! - Great.
SUPFEMALE:Finished.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what is it? It's a pelican.
LEADMALE:Let's go home.
OTHERMALE:Oh, honey we can't go home now.
SUPFEMALE:May-Maybe I can play a little something with you.
LEADFEMALE:What would you like to play? Follow the leader.
LEADFEMALE:That-that's a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Can Uncle Jerry play? Everybody can play, but I go first.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Yay! Oh, Andy Hi, Carl.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, this is Roger Diamond, Diamond International Resorts.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse Keaton, the architect I was telling you about.
SUPFEMALE:How do you do? Quite well, thank you.
LEADMALE:You play an excellent follow the leader.
LEADFEMALE:That's, uh, my secretary, Doris Cameron.
LEADFEMALE:Hi there.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh Jerry, sir! Jerry Donello.
LEADFEMALE:And this is my son, Andrew.
OTHERMALE:This is Mr.
LEADMALE:Diamond and Mr.
LEADMALE:Norback, my boss.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Could you please fire Mom? We need her at home.
LEADFEMALE:"So, Butchie and Tom climbed over the fence "and started down the road to the lake.
SUPFEMALE:"They knew that Mr.
SUPMALE:Peabody would be there "and he'd let them use his boat.
SUPFEMALE:"They walked along kicking at the pebbles "and breathing the soft summer air, knowing for certain that they'd always be friends.
LEADMALE:" The end.
LEADFEMALE:How was that? The best story I ever heard.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Any questions? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Who's picking me up at school? Your dad and I will figure that one out.
SUPFEMALE:No mix-ups? No mix-ups.
LEADMALE:Give me big kiss.
LEADMALE:Daddy and I'll be up to tuck you in in a bit, okay? Put on your pajamas! No sleeping in your baseball uniform again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how's it going? Hi, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Every time I look at the drawings, all I see is Andy's face, and all I hear is Andy's voice, saying, "Please fire my mommy.
LEADMALE:We need her at home.
LEADMALE:" I can't help it, I just feel guilty.
SUPMALE:Hey, I do, too.
OTHERFEMALE:But it's not the same for you, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:It's not.
LEADFEMALE:I gave birth to those kids.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I did, too.
LEADMALE:That's not the way I remember it.
LEADMALE:Okay, I didn't actually give birth to them.
LEADMALE:But, uh if I could have, I would have.
LEADFEMALE:I believe you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's not fair, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:We're-we're both parents, and we're both working but no one ever asks you, "Steven, how do you handle a-a-a family and a career?" I mean, it's not a question anyone ever asks a man.
LEADFEMALE:That's one of the great things about being a man.
LEADMALE:But-but that's the kind of question a woman is supposed to have to answer.
SUPMALE:And the crazy thing is, I-I agree with it.
SUPFEMALE:You can't escape this, Elyse.
LEADMALE:We're-we're still partly a product of our own childhood, when men worked and women stayed home.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, Mallory and Alex are really the first generation to grow up without any preconceived sexual stereotypes.
SUPMALE:Well, maybe it will be the next generation.
LEADMALE:I-I don't know what to do, Steven.
LEADMALE:There is just too much going on, you know? I I-I can't handle it.
LEADFEMALE:How many places can I be at one time? How many things can I do? How many hands do I have? I mean, I'm not an octopus.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I am an oct I don't even know if I'm an octopus or not! Mom's flipping out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not flipping out.
LEADMALE:Let me tell you something else, Mom.
LEADMALE:You're not an octopus.
LEADFEMALE:You're a woman, and you're a darn fine one.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Alex.
LEADMALE:It's all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just a little overwrought.
LEADFEMALE:Overloaded.
LEADMALE:Mom, then why don't you do what the phone company does? When you've had enough, make this 
LEADFEMALE:"I'm sorry, but all my circuits are overloaded at this time.
SUPMALE:"Please call back after 6:00 p.
LEADMALE:m.
SUPFEMALE:, or when all the kids have moved out of the house.
LEADMALE:" Does anybody want to kiss me good night? All right, buddy.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna kiss you - Here we are! Something I really do worry about, Steven.
OTHERMALE:What's that? How's Andy gonna look back on these years? I mean, when I think back on my childhood, the the memories that mean the most to me, the ones that are most comforting, are of my mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, like the summer when I was seven, I had the chicken pox.
LEADFEMALE:I I was miserable.
LEADMALE:I I was itchy and scratchy, and I was watching all these other kids go to the lake to swim.
LEADFEMALE:But my mother stayed home with me, and she made a a magical place just for the two of us.
OTHERMALE:Oh, she made a cave with blankets and pillows, and she brought in lemonade and sandwiches, and we pretended that we were castaways stranded on some island in the South Pacific.
LEADMALE:We called it Donnelly Island.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to visit it sometime.
SUPFEMALE:Am I making any memories like that for Andrew? I mean years from now, what is he going to remember? His mommy's office? His mommy's blueprints? Where's Andy's Donnelly Island? He has one, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Uh, I like to think of it as Keaton Island.
OTHERFEMALE:But he does have one.
LEADMALE:You see It's his childhood, Elyse, not yours.
LEADFEMALE:Andy will have his own memories, and they'll be beautiful ones.
LEADMALE:Of, uh, a brother and sisters and friends, of his dad, and of his very loving mother.
LEADFEMALE:A woman who is happy, and satisfied at work, and who brought that happiness home to her children.
LEADFEMALE:I hope so.
LEADFEMALE:We've been lucky with our children, haven't we? Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:They brought us so much.
OTHERFEMALE:They have.
SUPFEMALE:Want to have another one? Not just yet.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like to just practice some time? Well, gee, I think I could probably fit you in right here between 11:00 and 11:05 tomorrow I think maybe
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:I got it! - Quick, open it up before Mom gets in here! Hey, hey, what's going on? Jennifer opened the cereal.
LEADMALE:I couldn't stop her.
LEADFEMALE:Now, look, there's a perfectly good box of cereal in there.
SUPMALE:Why do you have to open a new one? To find the clue.
SUPMALE:What clue? The clue to the "Find the Colonel Crackle" contest.
SUPFEMALE:I don't care about that; this is food.
LEADMALE:You just don't waste it.
SUPFEMALE:What contest? Mom, Colonel Crackle is lost somewhere in Ohio, and in every box, there's a different clue to his whereabouts.
OTHERMALE:If you find him, you call the Crackle Hotline and win $5,000.
SUPMALE:Let me see that.
SUPFEMALE:So, the clue is somewhere inside the box? Hey, hey, Mom! Mom! Mom! Don't you think you're a little old to be fighting over a prize in a cereal box? See, Colonel Crackle cereal's having a contest.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of fun.
LEADMALE:Mom, remember who you're talking to.
LEADMALE:I'm 21 years old.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a senior in college.
SUPMALE:I couldn't care less about some cereal contest.
SUPMALE:You can win $5,000.
LEADMALE:Stop! Now, how about this for a solution? We can all help find Colonel Crackle, and then when we do find him, we will share the prize.
LEADMALE:What, you mean we got to split it four ways? Look, pal, we only had to split it three ways till you came through the door.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right, okay, we'll split it four ways, but that's it, all right? - We don't tell anybody else No.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's going on? Oh, nothing, Mal, nothing at all, nothing at all.
SUPMALE:Hey, what's new in the world of knitwear? - Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dad, have you heard that Colonel Crackle is missing? And I never really got a chance to say good-bye.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dad, have you no respect for Colonel Crackle lore? A colonel that meets 100%/ of the minimum daily requirements of vitamins A through E? A colonel that remains crunchy even in milk? Exciting as that may be, I have some news from the non-cereal world that may interest you.
OTHERMALE:There's a job opening up at the station.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Dad.
LEADMALE:I'm so happy.
LEADMALE:You're leaving public television! Oh, it is a wise, wise decision.
LEADMALE:Alex, it's not my job that's open.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you tease me like that? It's an intern position.
SUPMALE:An opportunity for the right young person to work at the station and really learn the ropes.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds great, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have anyone in mind for the job? Well, as a matter of fact, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:What?! What did what did I do? Well, I think it's a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:Alex worked at the station.
SUPFEMALE:He loved it.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you? Absolutely.
LEADMALE:The finest experience I've ever had.
SUPMALE:I highly recommend it.
SUPMALE:See? All right.
LEADMALE:We know Crackle is out there.
LEADFEMALE:We know he's somewhere in the downtown Cleveland area.
OTHERFEMALE:The question is where.
LEADFEMALE:Damn! All right, Jen, read that read that last clue again.
LEADMALE:"At 2:00 p.
LEADFEMALE:m.
OTHERFEMALE:Last Saturday, Colonel Crackle was seen "at a Cleveland cafe with his cereal sister, "Molly Oats and Fiber.
LEADMALE:"Molly ate four containers of strawberry yogurt "and handed Colonel Crackle a key.
SUPFEMALE:He fled.
OTHERFEMALE:" This tells us nothing.
LEADFEMALE:No, Jen.
SUPMALE:No, no, this tells us a lot.
SUPMALE:This tells us that Crackle has a sister and that she's health-conscious.
LEADFEMALE:Is Colonel Crackle a real person? Well, uh, not exactly, Andy.
SUPMALE:Then how are we supposed to find him if he doesn't exist? Let's not get philosophical here, all right? - Dad's not in here, is he? - No, he's upstairs.
LEADMALE:I can go and get him for you.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:If I see him, he's gonna try and bring up that PBS thing again.
LEADFEMALE:He won't take no for an answer.
LEADFEMALE:He's been going at it for hours.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't even had a chance to eat.
SUPMALE:I'm starving.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, this is a chance Mallory shouldn't miss.
LEADMALE:Every time an opportunity like this comes up, she qui Oh, come on, you guys are really making a mess with this Crackle business.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, guys, let's go upstairs and check out the Crackle map.
SUPMALE:It's in my room.
OTHERMALE:All right, let's call Skippy.
LEADMALE:We'll find out how he's doing with Crackle's dental records and his hair analysis.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I really think Mallory could benefit by working down at the station with me.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Steven.
SUPMALE:I was surprised you even offered her the job.
SUPMALE:I would think it's the last place she'd want to work.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'm not blind.
OTHERMALE:I realize there could be some problems with having Mallory work at the station, but I think it's worth the risk.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, where's the mayonnaise? It's in there.
LEADMALE:Now, I realize this job doesn't fall into what we'd normally call her area, but how do we really know what her area is? She's at an age where she could go in a lot of different directions.
LEADMALE:Uh, I just think this could be an opportunity to grow.
LEADMALE:Where is the mayonnaise? Well, I think we have to look at it from her point of view.
LEADMALE:You know, we've had this discussion before.
LEADMALE:Fashion is what she loves.
SUPFEMALE:She may be unsure now, but I think she'll learn a lot from this experience.
SUPMALE:Maybe-maybe I'm wrong, but I think I have a very good sense of where Mallory is at.
SUPFEMALE:What I don't know is where the mayonnaise is.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'll get another one.
SUPMALE:Mom, look.
LEADFEMALE:We both have mayonnaise.
SUPMALE:Dad, where's your jar? Mallory, where did you come from? I came from outside.
OTHERFEMALE:Somebody must have left this in the driveway.
SUPMALE:Well, there it is.
LEADMALE:Enjoy it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be in my room.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:We never finished our conversation.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I thought we had.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I'll leave you two alone.
SUPMALE:So, um Mal, have you given any more thought to, uh, working at the station? I have, Dad.
LEADMALE:And? I just don't know, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to pressure you at all.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever you decide will be fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:I-I just don't know, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come down to the station for a day, just give it a try? I don't know, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a wonderful opportunity, Mal.
LEADMALE:This thing could open up a whole new world for you.
SUPMALE:I don't know, Dad.
LEADMALE:And I'd be so proud to have you there with me.
LEADMALE:I just think you'd be terrific at this.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, Dad.
LEADMALE:Great! Oh, Mal, this is going to be fabulous! I don't know, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Well, madam, according to our records, you pledged $150 during the last pledge drive, and we haven't received it yet.
SUPMALE:Well, could you tell us when it might be coming? Well, then you're not gonna get your tote bag.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry about it, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, over the years, we've found that, uh, just plain liars.
SUPMALE:And we're running out of tote bags anyhow.
LEADMALE:So, how's it going? I don't know, Gus.
SUPMALE:I mean, to tell you the truth, part of me is really bored being here and part of me thinks it's a mistake and and part of me is determined to do the best job I can do and well, part of me just wants to go shopping.
LEADFEMALE:Now, there's a beautiful sight.
LEADFEMALE:My oldest daughter with her shoes on my lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, Dad.
LEADMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't mind a bit.
SUPMALE:It's great to walk into my office and see your smiling face.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, what about my smiling face, Steve? Don't you start competing with Mallory, now, Gus.
SUPMALE:You're beautiful in your own way.
LEADMALE:Aw Keep up the good work, now, Mallory.
LEADMALE:"Good work"? I like the sound of that.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he doesn't say that to everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Good work, Steve.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank So, how's it going? Are you enjoying yourself? Is it everything you hoped it would be? Well, I got to talk on the phone a little.
LEADMALE:I like that.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Mal, my two greatest loves are my family and my work here at the station.
LEADFEMALE:Having you here brings those two worlds together.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't be happier.
LEADMALE:I'm glad.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come here.
LEADFEMALE:I got a surprise for you.
LEADMALE:Something that will make you happy and very excited.
LEADMALE:I don't have to work here anymore? Come on! Oh, Mal! Look, look, I know you're not completely sold on this yet, but I also know that when you're faced with a challenge, you accept it, you can do it.
LEADMALE:You rise to the occasion! Not always.
SUPFEMALE:Most of the time.
SUPMALE:Not now.
SUPMALE:I've come up with a special assignment for you.
LEADMALE:I think you're really gonna like it.
LEADFEMALE:Is it about fashion? Because I can do a great job - if it's about fashion.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, you already know everything about fashion.
LEADMALE:I think it's time for you to, uh, branch out and really try something different.
LEADFEMALE:Beauty tips? - No.
OTHERMALE:You're going to work with me.
LEADFEMALE:Wha? - Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I want you to write some copy for a short segment of Ohio in Review.
LEADMALE:It's a show about what's going on in Ohio from, uh, political news to human interest stories.
LEADFEMALE:I'm flattered, Dad, but I've never even seen the show.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? We watch it all the time.
SUPMALE:It's on Sundays at 4:00 after Animals, Animals, Everywhere Animals.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ohio in Review.
LEADMALE:I love that show.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to work on it together! You behind the scenes, me on camera.
OTHERMALE:Keatons, Keatons, Everywhere Keatons.
SUPMALE:All right, now these dots trace the colonel's path since he was discovered missing.
LEADFEMALE:Can we end this soon, Alex? I have a life to lead.
SUPFEMALE:This is a little more important than you might think.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the colonel is out here somewhere in the middle of nowhere, and he's cold and he is hungry.
SUPFEMALE:How can he be hungry? He's made of cereal.
SUPMALE:Now, we know he is definitely in the Columbus area.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mom, Mom, you you able to help us out on this? Look, I have more important things to do, if you don't mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to work in peace.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, sorry.
OTHERMALE:All right, Jen read me the next clue.
LEADMALE:"On the corner with the tree that cries, "the sweetest birthday wins the prize.
SUPFEMALE:Sincerely, the Colonel.
SUPFEMALE:" A tree that cries.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
OTHERMALE:When would a tree cry? If he saw E.
LEADMALE:T.
SUPFEMALE:A tree that cries.
LEADFEMALE:A tree that cries.
SUPFEMALE:Weeping willow.
LEADMALE:Jen, quick! Look up weeping willow on the map.
SUPMALE:I found it, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:There's a Willow Street.
LEADMALE:You're a genius, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right, I gave you a clue.
LEADFEMALE:Do me a favor take this in the other room.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't bail out on us now.
SUPFEMALE:Forget about this architecture stuff, okay? You got a chance to win five grand here.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now, the next part of the clue is, "Sweetest birthday wins the prize.
LEADMALE:" Sweetest birthday wins the prize.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, please, will you? Come on.
SUPMALE:Sweetest birthday, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Ma, Mommy! - I Come on, sweetest birthday, Mom.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Sweet sweet 16! Jen, quick, uh, uh, Willow and 16th! That's it! We found it! Oh, quick! Call the Crackle Hotline! Oh, what's the number? What's the number? Uh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It's on the cereal box! - Where's the cereal box? - Uh, it's in the kitchen! - Where's the kitchen? - Over there! Go! Go! Go! Mal? Yeah, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? Nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:I was I was stretching.
LEADFEMALE:We've still got a lot of work to do.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, good.
LEADMALE:I-I was afraid we were just going to do those nine hours.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:We've just scratched the surface.
SUPMALE:Now, here, uh, take this, uh take this folder.
LEADFEMALE:Now, uh, let's, uh let's look over, uh, the areas we want to cover.
SUPMALE:Now, I-I know I definitely want to touch on, uh, uh, Congressman Willeck's trip to the Persian Gulf.
LEADMALE:What approach do you think we should take? A fashion approach.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, fashion does have its place, but there are some things more important than color coordination.
LEADFEMALE:After all, there's a war going on.
LEADMALE:Dad, do you ever stop to think that maybe if the world were color-coordinated there'd be no more wars? After all, when colors clash, men are soon to follow.
LEADMALE:Well, okay, you write a little, um, uh, fashion prospective, and I'll see if I can fit it in the report.
LEADMALE:Um, okay.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:How can that be a Crackle Hotline if the line is always busy? I mean, what would happen if someone had an actual Crackle crisis? Alex, I'm so glad you're here.
OTHERMALE:I'm going completely nuts working with Dad at the station.
SUPFEMALE:It is a disaster.
LEADMALE:"I told you so" is such an ugly phrase.
LEADMALE:All right, give me the details.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I am so bored down there.
LEADMALE:I feel like I've entered one of Dad's documentaries.
LEADMALE:Like like, at any moment, I'm going to be shot with a tranquilizer gun, tagged, weighed and shipped to a wildlife preserve.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you'll turn up on Anima/s, Anima/s, Everywhere Anima/s.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, look, uh, Mal, why don't you just quit? Oh, I can't do that.
SUPMALE:It means the world to Dad that I'm working there.
LEADFEMALE:He's so proud of me.
LEADFEMALE:He keeps calling staff meetings to introduce me.
SUPMALE:I've met Gus 80 times.
SUPMALE:All right, well, then, look at it this way, okay? I had to go through it, now you have to go through it.
SUPMALE:I mean, it's a fact of life, growing up in the Keaton household.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, right now, Jen is working on her segment of Ohio in Review.
LEADMALE:So, just hang with it, and-and sooner or later, your basic incompetence will shine through.
SUPFEMALE:I sure hope so.
LEADFEMALE:Gus, have you seen Mallory? Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She's in the control room.
LEADMALE:She should be down here in a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:I tell you, Elyse, I'm getting a little worried.
SUPMALE:About Mallory? - No.
LEADFEMALE:About me.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if you and Steven keep shipping your offspring down here to the station, I got the feeling I'm going to find myself out of a job.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you know, Elyse, one day this little girl is going to work at this station, too.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:I'm packing my bags.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Hello, operator.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'm-I'm trying to get through to the Crackle Hotline.
LEADFEMALE:B-But the line is always busy.
SUPMALE:Oh, I oh, you're trying to call, too? Oh, really? Well, where do you think he is? The telephone operator thinks that Colonel Crackle is under a bus in Dayton.
LEADMALE:We're going to be rich! Uh, you better hurry, Mallory.
SUPMALE:We're going to go in about two minutes.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I'm ready.
SUPMALE:I just got to set this stuff up.
SUPMALE:Hey, how's my partner? - Fine.
SUPMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:I did everything you said.
LEADMALE:I've got all the copy right here, and I put all the cassettes in the control room.
LEADMALE:Great, great.
LEADFEMALE:Way to go, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Steven, I need you onstage now.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Crackle.
LEADMALE:C-R-A-C-K-L-E.
LEADFEMALE:Crackle.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Crackle.
OTHERMALE:Alex, come over here.
SUPMALE:Alex.
SUPMALE:WKS proudly presents Ohio in Review.
LEADFEMALE:Colonel Crackle! C-R-A - Come on.
SUPMALE:C-K-L Hello and welcome.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm the general manager of WKS, Steven Crackle.
LEADFEMALE:I That's, um, Steven "Crackle" Keaton.
LEADMALE:Welcome to Ohio in Review.
LEADMALE:At the top of Ohio happenings tonight, the Dayton Drive-Through Lion Safari celebrated its fifth anniversary this week, and a huge crowd was on hand to see monkeys, baboons and the like strut their stuff for children of all ages.
SUPMALE:And Congressman Jim Willeck returned from his recent fact-finding mission to the war-torn region of the Persian Gulf.
LEADFEMALE:The four-term congressman was dressed in a lovely chiffon gown with diamantÃ© shoulder straps by Galanos.
LEADMALE:He was? I'm sorry, Dad.
SUPMALE:It must have gotten mixed up with that - with that fashion report - Yeah, that's all right.
LEADMALE:I was I was working on.
LEADMALE:Yeah, here.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:Okay, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mom.
LEADMALE:I'm over here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:Willeck reported that the Iranian leadership repeated their demands for a cease-fire with Iraq.
OTHERFEMALE:These included free passage through the Straits of Hormuz, an embargo on Iraqi oil products and a pair of sling-back, open-toed shoes for tomorrow night's dance.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's okay.
LEADMALE:Let's-let's roll the videotape.
LEADFEMALE:In national news, the president, at a press conference today, stated that he and other government officials were hard at work trying to cut down on defense spending.
LEADMALE:He also said - Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Not-not now.
LEADMALE:Not now, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:The president emphasized that the huge federal deficit, while troublesome, was something we can't run away from.
OTHERMALE:The key, he said, was to try to ride it out.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, I made a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I think they're showing the wrong videotape.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:What? This just in.
LEADMALE:Monkeys, monkeys, everywhere monkeys.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, just go to a commercial.
LEADFEMALE:We don't have a commercial.
OTHERMALE:We Can I just use this phone? Alex, please.
SUPMALE:Crackle! C-R-A-C-K-L-E! I'm going to go up to put, uh put Andy to bed.
SUPMALE:I'll check on Mallory, too.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea.
OTHERMALE:I'm just going to use the phone.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, don't you think you're being a little insensitive? Jennifer, we're talking about $5,000 here.
SUPMALE:Make the call.
LEADMALE:Yeah, at last! It's ringing! It's ringing! Hello! Hello.
SUPMALE:I would like your complete and undivided attention.
SUPMALE:My name is Alex P.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Colonel Crackle is in downtown Columbus on the corner of Willow and What? I beg your pardon? That's impossible.
LEADMALE:Really? I see.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, what's the matter? Colonel Crackle was found under a bus in Dayton.
LEADMALE:By a telephone operator.
SUPFEMALE:My God, is he all right? Mallory's door is locked.
SUPFEMALE:She won't come down.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:You seem to be taking it awfully hard, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:The job just just wasn't right for her.
LEADMALE:A telephone operator.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, maybe she could do that.
LEADMALE:Mom, what should we tell Mallory about the show? I mean, should we tell her we liked it? We should just tell her the truth, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mom, come on.
LEADFEMALE:It was embarrassing.
SUPMALE:It was humiliating.
OTHERMALE:And it-it was it was the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
SUPFEMALE:That is true.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I believe that, I do.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, loved it, Mal.
LEADMALE:That was the finest piece of tele-journalism - I have ever seen.
SUPFEMALE:It's certainly - new ground down at - Thought that, too.
LEADMALE:I'm sending out for Stunning.
OTHERFEMALE:You're all very nice, but I know what it was a complete disaster.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm afraid you're right on the money there, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Telephone operator.
LEADMALE:I'm so sorry, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I-I swear I tried my best, but I was just in way over my head, and I apologize.
LEADMALE:I thought you were doing great! If it was too much for you, why didn't you come to me? Why didn't you say so? Oh, I'd go to work every day, and you were so happy I was there and so proud of every little thing I did.
LEADFEMALE:And there I was going through the motions, and not really knowing what I was doing.
OTHERMALE:Except that I was doing it for you.
SUPMALE:And I didn't want to let you down.
SUPMALE:I think I'm the one who let you down.
SUPFEMALE:I pushed you into areas you didn't want to go.
LEADFEMALE:Areas you shouldn't go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I really ruined your show.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I hope your ratings don't drop.
SUPMALE:Fortunately, Mal, that's completely impossible.
LEADMALE:I love you so much, honey.
SUPMALE:I just want the whole world to open up for you, to see you go and do things that I didn't have a chance to do.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Maybe every father feels that way.
OTHERFEMALE:But I am doing things I want, Dad, and I'm doing things I never thought I'd do.
LEADMALE:I'm going to college.
SUPFEMALE:You and Mom gave me that.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:And even though I'll never, never, ever work at your station again, I've learned from you the value of work, but it has to be my kind of work.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:It was really nice having you down there.
LEADFEMALE:I loved seeing you so much.
LEADFEMALE:It was nice for me, too.
LEADMALE:So, it wasn't all bad, huh? Some parts you liked? Sure.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe, uh, you know, under under better circumstances, it, uh You know, maybe if, uh, Jennifer were down there helping you and Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, too, Andy.
LEADMALE:You know, maybe if you all worked there at the same time I don't know, Dad.
OTHERMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Andy and I are going out for a walk.
LEADMALE:You want to come, Jen? Oh, no, thanks, Dad.
LEADMALE:I've got this paper to write, and it's going kind of slow.
LEADMALE:Oh, maybe I could help.
LEADMALE:I don't think so, Dad.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:You think that now you're in high school your homework's getting a little too complex for your old, intellectually washed-up dad.
LEADFEMALE: Well, it's just that you go completely overboard in these situations.
LEADMALE:It's like the time when you tried to help me with that book report on Huck Finn, and we had to write it on a raft floating down the Mississippi.
SUPMALE:Well, what's so terrible about a parent trying to get involved with his children's education? After all, I help Andy with his homework.
LEADMALE:I always redo it after you leave.
SUPFEMALE:Jen, I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:I'll only help you if your paper's in an area of my expertise.
LEADMALE:All right, Dad.
LEADMALE:I'm writing a paper for my introduction to philosophy class on the existentialist perspective of SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard.
SUPFEMALE:SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard? SÃ¸rie? Who's Kierkegaard? He was a Swedish philosopher, Andy.
SUPMALE:He was a Danish philosopher, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:T-Technically he was Danish.
SUPFEMALE:But he had an apartment in Sweden.
LEADMALE:Lauren, Lauren, come on, come on, let me take that.
LEADMALE:Alex, it's one bag.
LEADFEMALE:I can carry it.
SUPMALE:Hey, listen, the woman I love is not gonna be lugging around a heavy grocery bag.
LEADMALE:Yo, Alex! Sorry, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Forgot you were out there.
LEADFEMALE: It's all right.
LEADMALE:I'm used to it.
SUPFEMALE:The minute we walked into the market, I knew you two were in your own world.
SUPMALE:Lauren, I still can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:After three months of going out, you still seem to like Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever taken a really good look at him? Oh, my God! You're right.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Of course she likes me.
LEADMALE:I'm cute, I'm intelligent, and I have unlimited earning potential.
LEADMALE:I know that's what attracted me to you.
LEADFEMALE:I think you guys make a cute couple.
OTHERFEMALE:I just never want to go shopping with you again.
LEADFEMALE: - Oh, I've got it! Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Um, yeah.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on a second.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Lauren, it's for you.
LEADMALE:For me? I thought from the ring it would be for me, but Hello.
OTHERMALE:Eric, what a surprise! How'd you get the number here? Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm fine, fine.
SUPFEMALE:How are you doing? Oh, that's great! Yeah, well, I don't know.
LEADMALE:Um Yeah, I'll have to think about it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I will.
OTHERMALE: Good hearing from you, too.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:That was Eric Matthews.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Eric Matthews.
LEADFEMALE:Why does that name sound familiar? He's the guy that I went out with before I met you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's it.
LEADMALE:Well, he's coming in from New York tomorrow night, and he wants to know about dinner.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, geez, uh, I'm busy tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:I think he meant me.
LEADMALE:Oh, of course.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you! Oh, you-you should go.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure it wouldn't bother you? No! No, absolu Look, he's come all this way.
LEADFEMALE:You know, uh, I think it would be a nice gesture.
SUPMALE:Alex, that's so sensitive of you.
LEADFEMALE:I-I thought you'd be threatened by something like this.
LEADMALE:Hey What, are you kidding? Come on, you should know me better than that.
LEADMALE:Now, let's just put the rest of this stuff away, okay? We'll go in, we'll have a nice dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Afterwards, we'll get married.
SUPMALE:Alex, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make you some tea.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, no, listen.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, uh, I'm going to get going 'cause I don't want to be here when, uh when Eric gets here.
LEADMALE:Alex, you don't have to leave just 'cause Eric's showing up.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but, uh, you two probably have a lot of catching up to do.
LEADMALE:You know, I'd just be in the way.
LEADMALE:So you go out and have a nice dinner.
SUPMALE:You're n-not going to go out like that, are you? You know, dressed up.
LEADMALE:Alex, this is just a sweater.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:It's just it's just such a fancy one.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I mean, you're just going out for dinner, right? You're not going to meet the queen afterwards.
OTHERMALE:Alex, if you're nervous about this, I'll call it off.
OTHERMALE:No, I-I'm kidding.
LEADMALE:I'm kidding.
SUPMALE:Okay, you sure? - Positive.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE: - Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Eric.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you look terrific.
LEADMALE:Your hair's a little shorter.
SUPMALE:I like it.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPMALE:You look terrific, too.
SUPMALE:Your hair's a little longer.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Nice of you to notice.
LEADMALE:Mine's exactly the same.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Eric, I'd like you to meet Alex Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:It's a pleasure meeting you, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, pleasure meeting you, too, Eric.
SUPMALE: You're a little early.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't expecting you for another hour.
LEADMALE:Oh, you know me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm always a little early.
LEADFEMALE:Can't help it.
LEADMALE:I think it's important to be punctual.
OTHERMALE:Don't have to tell me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm, uh I'm I'm here for a date next week.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't I call the restaurant and see if they can take us earlier? - Good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE: So you and Lauren met over at Leland.
LEADMALE:Uh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's right.
SUPMALE:She was, uh she was doing a psychology experiment on, uh, overachievers, so I applied.
LEADMALE:I'm in the economics department myself.
LEADFEMALE:My old stomping grounds.
LEADMALE:How's Professor Carpenter doing? Great.
LEADMALE:I had him for micro this past semester.
OTHERMALE:He's a tough old guy, isn't he? Ooh, you bet.
LEADMALE:I was, uh I was lucky to squeeze a B-plus out of him.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I deserved more, but-but-but he's got this crazy rule against giving A's.
SUPMALE:Really? He must have started that rule after I left.
SUPFEMALE:He, uh he-he gave you an A? A-plus.
SUPFEMALE:Well, well, he ma he made up for the low grade, actually.
LEADMALE:He, uh he recommended me for the Wilson scholarship.
SUPMALE:Oh, congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:I won that, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I-I, uh I also won the Burke scholarship and the Harrison scholarship, the Matthews scholarship.
SUPFEMALE:I received all those except the Matthews.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, can't win them all.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially not that one.
SUPFEMALE:It's named after me.
LEADMALE:Did I mention my miniature golf trophy? Look, uh, Alex It's sort of pointless for us to sit here comparing grades and awards.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, we might as well just exchange rÃ©sumÃ©s.
LEADFEMALE: Right, right.
LEADMALE: This is amazing.
LEADMALE:This is incredible.
SUPMALE:I-I mean, Lauren-Lauren told me you worked on Wall Street.
LEADMALE:I had no idea it was at Dunn and Bradley.
LEADMALE:Dunn and Bradley.
SUPMALE:That-that's the most prestigious banking investment firm in the world.
SUPMALE:Isn't it? What is it like to work there? Oh, it's so magical.
LEADFEMALE:It's hard to describe.
LEADMALE:You know that feeling you had when you were a kid and your parents would take you to the bank? You'd dream about getting naked and leaping into the vault? Know it? I actually did it.
LEADFEMALE:The only downside is that there's not much time for a personal life.
LEADFEMALE:And even with all the success and all the money, when I get home to my empty apartment, I feel like there's something missing from my life.
LEADMALE:Maybe you need a dog.
LEADMALE:Okay, ready to go? - Yeah, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE: Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You meant you two.
LEADMALE:Okay, well, uh, I'll meet you outside when you're ready.
OTHERMALE:I'm across the street in the black Porsche.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice meeting you.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice meeting you, Eric.
SUPMALE: He's got a Porsche.
LEADMALE:Hey, do you guys have a minute? I need your help on something.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:What's up? - Well, I-I've been up in my room trying to figure out what is attractive about me.
LEADFEMALE:So far, a normal evening.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, I've-I've come up with a with a partial list of-of some of my good points, and, uh Now, here's where I need your help.
LEADFEMALE:Carrying the list? No, no, no, no, I mean, uh, filling it in.
LEADMALE:Rounding it out.
LEADMALE:You know, making sure I haven't haven't forgotten anything.
LEADMALE:I, uh I think it's fun for the whole family.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Alex, you you have a list here of your good points and Eric's good points.
SUPFEMALE:Who's Eric? Uh, my imaginary friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, your imaginary friend has a Porsche? It's an imaginary Porsche.
LEADMALE:He also has a job on Wall Street, an apartment in Manhattan, and he went out with Lauren for a year.
LEADMALE:Well, that's how we met.
LEADMALE:Uh uh, Lauren introduced us at a at a an imaginary, uh, real person, uh, get-together.
LEADMALE:Which group were you with? All right, Eric is, uh Eric's Lauren's old boyfriend.
SUPMALE:He's back in town, and they went out for dinner tonight.
OTHERMALE: You let them go?  I let them go.
LEADMALE:What's so amazing about that? Well, I just know that I'd be very nervous if one of Nick's old girlfriends came to visit him.
LEADFEMALE:We'd all be nervous, Mal.
SUPMALE:It would mean there had been a break-out at the women's detention center.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, did you meet, uh, Eric? Uh, briefly, briefly.
LEADFEMALE:We, uh we exchanged rÃ©sumÃ©s.
SUPMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:I guess a handshake seemed too obvious.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you, Dad, this guy is impressive.
LEADMALE:It's the first time I've ever been in a room with someone that I didn't feel complete intellectual superiority over.
SUPMALE:Thanks very much.
LEADMALE:Mom, you know what I mean.
SUPMALE:I mean, this guy, when you compare our rÃ©sumÃ©s, he tops me in every category.
OTHERMALE:Alex, you have something that Eric doesn't have.
SUPMALE:Lauren's love.
SUPFEMALE:That's not something that can be put on a rÃ©sumÃ©.
SUPFEMALE:No, Dad, he's got that down here.
LEADMALE:I-I must be missing something.
SUPFEMALE:There-there must be some good points that I have that Eric doesn't have.
LEADMALE:So that's why I need your help, okay? I-I-I want to know what you like about Alex Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? Who want who wants to get the ball rolling? - Uh - I Well - Mal? Mally? Huh? - Huh? I-I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It's so hard, Alex.
LEADMALE:Can I get back to you? Come on, you know? This is real important to me now.
SUPMALE:My-my whole relationship with Lauren could be at stake here.
SUPFEMALE: All right, just give me a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Uh you  Um uh Forget it, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want you to hurt yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:I have to disagree with you.
LEADFEMALE:Kierkegaard felt that all knowledge must be self-knowledge.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're wrong, Jen.
SUPMALE:He was also concerned with the larger societal problems.
LEADMALE:Dad, you're missing the point completely.
LEADMALE:Oh, am I? Kierkegaard believed that examining man's existence within a larger framework of a societal historical dialectic was an avoidance of subjective knowledge so essential to comprehending any type of spiritual truth.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, go to your room.
LEADMALE:That's a great argument, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think Kierkegaard would have said to that? Who cares? He didn't have any kids.
SUPMALE: Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I thought you said you were gonna turn in early tonight.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, I was, I was.
SUPFEMALE:Just, uh just came down to get a snack.
OTHERMALE:You seem a little distracted.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:No, no, I'm fine, fine.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Enjoy your Brillo pad.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Stacey.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Is Lauren back yet? No.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yes, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I know she went out with Eric.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I know he has a Porsche.
LEADFEMALE:No message.
OTHERMALE:No no message.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Columbus Columbus Grill? Um, yeah, is the Matthews party still there? I see.
LEADFEMALE:They left two hours ago? Yes, I know he drives a Porsche.
SUPMALE: 
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Lauren.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:Lauren.
SUPMALE:Hey, honey bear.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Hey, Lauren.
SUPFEMALE: Alex, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? What am I doing here? I live here, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't.
SUPMALE:No, I don't.
SUPMALE:But I live very nearby.
LEADMALE:What the hell are you doing here? Look, Alex I think I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, really, Eric? Well, let me tell you something.
SUPMALE:I may not be one of your slick, fast-talking, money-mongering, underhanded Dunn and Bradley friends although I hope to be one one day but I am not that gullible.
LEADMALE:Alex, listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:On the way home from dinner tonight, my car broke down in the middle of nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:We had to walk two miles to a gas station, get a tow truck, and then get a cab back here.
SUPFEMALE:By that time, it was after 1:00, I didn't have a place to stay, so Lauren told me I could sleep in her room.
LEADFEMALE:She's down the hall in Michelle's room.
SUPMALE:You expect me to believe that your brand-new $40,000 Porsche just conveniently broke down tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, it was closer to $50,000.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's a very tough story to swallow, Eric.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that includes dealer shipping and handling charges.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I'm talking about what happened with you and Lauren tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Now, believe it or not, some things in life are more important than money and finance charges.
SUPFEMALE: You don't believe that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, normally, I don't, normally, I don't.
LEADMALE:But but in this case, Eric, there definitely is something that's more important to me than money.
SUPMALE:Come on, Alex, nothing matters more than money.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, let's be honest.
SUPMALE:That's what separates guys like us from everybody else.
LEADFEMALE:Look, that's not the point.
SUPMALE:Come on, Alex, we've known it since we were kids.
SUPMALE:Remember the first time you saw a dollar sign? April 22, 1971.
LEADMALE:My first time, I was coming home from kindergarten.
LEADFEMALE:I was with a couple of my other friends.
LEADMALE:We passed a bank, and there it was in the window.
LEADFEMALE:The other guys know what it was? - No.
SUPFEMALE:They just thought it was a big "S" with two vertical lines through it.
LEADFEMALE:To me, it was a symbol of life.
LEADFEMALE:The other kids just went home for milk and cookies.
OTHERFEMALE:I knelt.
SUPMALE:I don't deny it, okay? I love money.
SUPMALE:But there is definitely something in my life that I love more Lauren.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Alex, I'll be honest with you.
LEADMALE:I did come back here wondering if Lauren and I could start seeing each other again.
LEADMALE:But from the minute I picked her up, all she did was talk about you.
LEADFEMALE:I could see she was really in love.
LEADMALE:So I decided just to have a good dinner, enjoy driving my new car, get a good night's sleep.
OTHERMALE:Instead, dinner was lousy and overpriced, my car's in the shop, it's 2:07 in the morning, and I'm wide awake.
SUPMALE:What a bust this trip was.
SUPFEMALE:I just hope I can write it off.
SUPFEMALE:You'll be able to write it off.
LEADMALE:After all, we talked about business, right? You could tell them it was, uh it was a recruiting session for Dunn and Bradley.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:What is this? Some overachiever pajama party? I'm sorry, honey.
LEADMALE:Did we wake you? Alex, what are you doing here? Oh, listen, uh, I talked to Eric.
LEADFEMALE:He explained everything.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:What is there to explain? Why don't I just, uh, step out for a minute? Hey, hey, Lauren, listen, I-I wasn't gonna come over here.
LEADMALE:It's just that I kept calling, and you weren't home.
LEADMALE:And-and the restaurant said you left.
SUPFEMALE:What? You called the restaurant? Alex, why? Don't you trust me? Of course I trust you.
LEADMALE:You got a funny way of showing it.
SUPMALE:Hey, come on, Lauren! Any other guy Alex, I don't care about any other guy.
OTHERFEMALE:I care about you.
SUPMALE:And our relationship.
LEADMALE:And trust! You know, I can't believe you did this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really mad at you.
LEADFEMALE: - Lauren.
LEADMALE:Lauren.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dad.
LEADMALE:Where were you, Alex? It's 3:00.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, just, I was over at Lauren's.
LEADMALE:What are you doing up? Oh, just a little reading.
LEADMALE:Existentialism for Dads.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:There's one thing I can say for Kierkegaard no matter how depressed you are, he's more depressed.
SUPFEMALE:In a strange way, it's sort of a pick-me-up.
LEADMALE:Mind if I borrow this book, Dad? - Sure, sure.
SUPMALE:I recommend chapter 
LEADFEMALE:"Existence is meaningless and life is absurd, so wipe that smile off your face.
OTHERFEMALE:" What a rotten night, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I was I was going crazy worrying about Lauren and Eric, so I went over there to see what was happening.
LEADFEMALE:What was happening? Nothing until I got there.
LEADFEMALE:And-and, uh, now Lauren thinks I don't trust her.
SUPFEMALE:I doubt she'll ever talk to me again.
SUPMALE:Look, Alex, there are a lot of  Let me just leave you with a thought from the immortal 
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:"Women can't live with them, can't live without them.
LEADFEMALE:" - Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Lauren, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm really sorry.
LEADMALE:Look, it's not all your fault.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I should have been more aware.
SUPFEMALE:I knew that even though you were trying to act gracefully, deep down it really bothered you.
LEADMALE:That's the thing.
OTHERMALE:I knew that you would think that deep down it it would bother me, so so I wanted to go even deeper and prove that you were wrong.
LEADMALE:It just so happens that, uh, I don't go that deep.
LEADMALE:You go plenty deep, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Too deep sometimes you overanalyze everything.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you to have the best of everything, you know? And then, when I met Eric, I just couldn't help but think that maybe he was the best.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, I don't love Eric.
OTHERMALE:Why not? I do.
OTHERFEMALE:The point I'm trying to make is that I love you, and you're just gonna have to learn to accept that.
LEADMALE:Maybe it might be a little easier for me to accept that if-if I knew why you love me.
SUPMALE:What do you mean, why do I love you? Well, in order for a guy like me to feel secure, I-I have to know what it is that you love about Alex Keaton.
SUPMALE:It's a lot of things.
LEADFEMALE:I can't just sit here and name them.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Because it just doesn't work that way.
OTHERMALE:Can you tell me why you love me? You're smart, you're beautiful, you're warm, you're wise, you're witty, you're sensitive, you're kind to children and old people, you care about what's going on in the world.
SUPMALE:Boy, you're really good at this.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, better than you.
LEADMALE:I'm At least you could give me a token "you're a nice guy" or something.
LEADMALE:All right, Alex, you want to know why I love you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Because of "The Banana Boat Song.
LEADFEMALE:" "The Banana Boat Song"?  Yes.
LEADFEMALE:We were at one of those economic department symposiums you drag me to, and some guy was droning on for hours and hours about the deficit or the surplus or something.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It was excruciatingly boring.
LEADFEMALE:Then, suddenly, when I thought I just couldn't take it for another minute, you you sang to me "The Banana Boat Song.
OTHERMALE:"  Day-o, Day-ay-ay-o Daylight come and me want to go home.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I love you.
SUPFEMALE:You ever heard me do "Misty"? Alex, it was the fact that in the middle of this stuffy affair with all your professors around, you sang me "The Banana Boat Song.
SUPMALE:" It didn't make any sense.
LEADFEMALE:It was a complete contradiction.
LEADFEMALE:It's what makes you uniquely you.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You can't come up with anything concrete that'll have to do.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, this isn't something you have to define.
LEADMALE:You don't have to clarify.
SUPFEMALE:It just is.
SUPFEMALE:And it's wonderful!  Sure, I could sit around here all night and rattle off great things about you.
LEADMALE: I got nowhere to go
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Shh! They need their rest.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey They're adorable when they're asleep, aren't they? They're like little angels.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's all this? We're playing garage.
LEADFEMALE:You want to play? Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:What's she doing here? That's Barbie.
SUPMALE:She owns the garage.
SUPFEMALE:Barbie owns the garage.
LEADFEMALE:Really, she's in Congress.
SUPMALE:But on weekends she's a mechanic.
LEADMALE:I think I see Mom's influence here.
LEADMALE:She also won the Nobel Prize in physics.
LEADMALE:You've come a long way, haven't you, honey? Well, let's get back to the real world, huh? Where's Barbie's apron? Alex, stop.
LEADMALE:Oh Mom, a garage-owning, female Senator with a Nobel Prize in physics? It could happen.
LEADMALE:With a body like that? Alex! What? What? What's the matter? I don't want Alex playing with Barbie anymore.
LEADMALE:Mom! You heard your mother, Alex.
LEADMALE:Stay away from Barbie! - What? - Look, Mom, - it's just not realistic.
LEADMALE:Kids reflect the real social If you can't play nicely, you shouldn't play at all.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey! - Hey! Where have you guys been? At the library.
LEADFEMALE:No, seriously.
LEADMALE:For your information, Alex, I'm reading Wuthering Heights.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's your mother's favorite book! I love Wuthering Heights.
LEADFEMALE:It's so romantic.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, you remember when we were in college, we used to act out the scenes? Aw, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Please don't.
SUPMALE:I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh hi.
LEADMALE:Aunt Rosemary! Hello.
SUPMALE:Hello, you darling people! I'm sorry I'm late.
LEADMALE:I hope I didn't keep you waiting.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you weren't worried.
LEADMALE:Airplane travel today is not to be believed.
OTHERFEMALE:I had to wait four hours for my airplane, and What's the matter? Why is nobody moving or speaking? It's-it's-it's such a surprise! - We weren't expecting you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, nonsense! I wrote you a letter about two months ago and told you I was coming.
LEADMALE:And then I telephoned Mallory and had a long conversation with her about it.
OTHERMALE:Well, that explains it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, Aunt Rosemary, but I don't remember that conversation.
LEADMALE:Oh, what-what-what's the difference? You're here.
OTHERMALE:We're here.
OTHERFEMALE:Welcome.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you! Oh, Elyse, you're still beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you're more beautiful than ever.
OTHERFEMALE:And Steven, you have a lovely personality.
LEADFEMALE:How about me? - Oh - Huh? Am I still beautiful? Aunt Rosemary? Oh, and you must be Nick.
LEADMALE:Uh, you must be? You are definitely Nick.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm not saying that your great-grandma Brenda didn't like your father; she did.
SUPFEMALE:It was just that she had difficulty remembering his name.
LEADFEMALE:She used to call me Phil.
SUPMALE:I remember, uh, even on her deathbed, she wanted me to know how happy she was for me that-that your dad and I were together.
SUPMALE:And she leaned in and she took my hand and she looked me in the eye and said, "I like that Phil.
LEADMALE:" We were very close.
SUPFEMALE:She was a great lady, my mom.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Held that family together five kids, no husband.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I think it was your mom, more than anyone, who pushed me to break free.
LEADMALE:Well, you and her together.
SUPMALE:You were always telling me, "Go for it, Elyse.
LEADMALE:You can do it.
OTHERMALE:Girls can do anything.
OTHERMALE:" Andy.
SUPMALE:You haven't changed a bit, have you? Andy and I have a different opinion when it comes to this area, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:Andy, a woman's place is? In the house.
LEADMALE:And? In the Senate.
LEADMALE:Et tu, Andrew? There's more of them, Alex.
SUPMALE:You know, it really was my mother's idea that you become an architect.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I think I remember that day, too.
SUPMALE:Oh, goodness, I think I was nine years old, and I-I was at Rosemary's house.
LEADMALE:I always wanted to be a dancer.
OTHERFEMALE:And I was there and I put on my ballet shoes, and I'd dance and I'd dance and I'd dance and when I was through, Grandma Brenda said, "Why don't you become an architect?" And the ballet world has never fully recovered.
SUPMALE:It's great having Aunt Rosemary here.
LEADMALE:I love when she comes to visit.
SUPFEMALE:She always has the greatest stories.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I like hearing about when you and Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton were kids.
SUPFEMALE:You know, stories about the old days.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't call them "the old days," Nick.
SUPMALE:Uh, you know what I mean, the stories from a long, long time ago.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you mean.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I mean stories from way, way back.
LEADFEMALE:Nick! Gotcha.
LEADFEMALE:But it is nice, Mom, that Aunt Rosemary has those stories from the the very recent past, when you were a teenager.
LEADFEMALE:Rosemary was always a great storyteller.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the keeper of the family history, sort of.
SUPFEMALE:She'd write letters to everybody, keeping everyone in touch and up to date.
SUPFEMALE:It's nice, you know? Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's a terrific gang you have, Elyse Alex, the girls, Andrew Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Well, listen, I think I'm going to go back in.
LEADFEMALE:I brought an old scrapbook especially for the girls to see.
OTHERMALE:Oh, good.
SUPFEMALE:And there's a-a story I'm just dying to tell the kids, about my mom and how it was her idea that you become an architect.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, don't you remember? You were about nine, and you were at our house, and you put on your ballet shoes, and you danced and you danced and you danced and you danced.
LEADMALE:And then my mother just looked at you and said, "Why don't you become an architect?" I-I-I guess I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:Shame on you.
LEADFEMALE:I want to hear more about Great-Grandma Brenda.
LEADMALE:She sounds like a terrific lady.
OTHERFEMALE:She was.
LEADFEMALE:Is that her, there? - Yes! She looked a lot like you, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Long dark hair and hazel eyes very, very pretty.
SUPFEMALE:Well, of course the Donnelly women have always been known for their beauty.
LEADMALE:They kept it no matter whom they married.
SUPMALE:Yeah, Phil.
OTHERMALE:Uh, go-go on, Rosemary.
LEADFEMALE:The legend of the Donnelly women goes back well into the 18th century, starting with the days of the handsome Nora Corrigan.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh Who was Nora Corrigan? She was your great-great- great-great grandmother.
SUPFEMALE:I love this story.
SUPFEMALE:It was the year 1741.
SUPMALE:A black cloud hung over Ireland in the form of brutal English rule.
SUPFEMALE:It was written that, from this day forward, no Irish man or woman could own land worth more than five pounds sterling.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the pound closed at $1.
LEADFEMALE:69 today, so depending on when you tell this story, - that-that could be - Alex! Sorry.
OTHERMALE:Go on.
SUPMALE:Well, the handsome Nora Corrigan for that's how she was known had recently been widowed.
LEADFEMALE:She had a boy ten years of age, and the wicked Lord Calvert had just given her 24 hours to get off her land.
SUPMALE:This was a Dynasty episode.
LEADMALE:There was but one way 
LEADMALE:Marry an English officer Right! and give the title to him, with the hope that one day he would pass the title back to her.
LEADFEMALE:With no time for courting, and the sun sinking slowly in the west, she made up her handsome mind.
SUPFEMALE:Dressed in her most beautiful of gowns, her long hair flowing in the breeze, her boot steps echoing on the cobblestones, she strode toward the tavern where the English soldiers were known to congregate.
LEADMALE:I'm scared.
LEADMALE:"Who among you here," she said, "Who among you here" Uh "Who among, who among you here," uh "Who among you here is man enough to marry" I know the damn story! Don't you think I know it? I told it to you for 40 years! Sorry.
LEADMALE:So she-she went into the town, and she s said to the men, uh, "Who-who among" I forget things very easily, these days.
LEADMALE:I don't remember well at all, and-and I have no idea at all how I got here to your house.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Beverly said no one knew her mom was coming here.
LEADFEMALE:Rosemary apparently missed a lunch date with her and then never showed up for work.
SUPMALE:Well, that explains why Mallory didn't remember the phone call.
LEADFEMALE:There obviously wasn't any phone call.
OTHERFEMALE:Evidently, this isn't the first incident of erratic behavior, either.
LEADFEMALE:There've been others.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Keaton, but isn't this type of forgetfulness a common sign of old age? Why are you asking me? Uh, well, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:You were the last one to talk, so I asked you.
LEADMALE:I mean, I don't think you're an expert on aging or even aging yourself, in any way, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:In fact in fact, I find you younger today than yesterday.
LEADMALE:But not as young as tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:There can be a certain amount of forgetfulness associated with aging.
LEADMALE:I'm told.
LEADFEMALE:But but this seems so much more serious, you know? More peculiar I Something happening to my mind.
SUPFEMALE:Something that would cause this fine machine to slow down.
SUPMALE:That's that's my greatest fear.
LEADMALE:Mine, too.
SUPMALE:Worried about your mind slowing down, Mal? Yes.
OTHERMALE:How would you know? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm-I'm sorry for the way I acted for that outburst.
OTHERMALE:I really don't know what came over me.
LEADFEMALE:Please, please, don't apologize.
SUPMALE:That's the last thing that should be on your mind.
OTHERFEMALE:When I say "on your mind," I mean, uh Would you like anything, Aunt Rosemary? Something to drink? Maybe some wa-ter? Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:What is going on? Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It started about six months ago, seven months ago.
LEADFEMALE:Things would happen, odd things.
LEADMALE:I would forget to pay the bills and the phone would be turned off.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry just the thought of that.
LEADMALE:Then I would look in the refrigerator, there'd be no food.
LEADFEMALE:I was sure I'd gone shopping and I hadn't.
LEADMALE:And then I'd I'd start to blank out on things.
LEADMALE:Places, dates, names Uh, for instance, right now, I'm looking at you and-and I can't recall your name.
SUPFEMALE:All I see is this huge dollar sign.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay with me.
LEADMALE:And then things I'd used all my life, little things, I-I-I suddenly couldn't remember what they were called.
LEADMALE:Uh, like, um - Uh, that's a fork.
LEADMALE:Knife.
SUPFEMALE:Napkin.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:And then, the other day, I drove to the library.
SUPFEMALE:Books.
LEADMALE:Now, it's two miles from my house to the library.
LEADMALE:I've driven it for 20 years.
LEADMALE:And on the way back, I-I couldn't find my way home.
LEADFEMALE:I need help.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Williamson.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, sorry to keep you waiting.
LEADMALE:Let's see, you must be Elyse, right? Yes, I'm Rosemary's niece.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:And you're Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh, actually, um - Phil Keaton.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, there are some things we really should discuss now.
SUPFEMALE:If you'd like us to go, we Oh, no, I'd like you to stay, really.
SUPMALE:So, um, what is it? What's going on? What's happening to me? I'm afraid what's happening isn't very encouraging.
LEADMALE:Uh the tests aren't all in yet.
LEADFEMALE:It-it could be a number of things.
SUPFEMALE:But based on your symptoms, and the information we already do have from your hometown doctor, there's a very real possibility that it's Alzheimer's disease.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, I Alzheimer's? A little forgetfulness does not have to be Alzheimer's.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I'm perfectly fine, most of the time.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Well, early stages can be characterized by periods of apparent stability.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, if it follows the normal path of Alzheimer's I-I don't mean to be cruel here.
LEADFEMALE:What are we talking about here, Doctor? How how long, how fast? It's difficult to say exactly.
LEADFEMALE:We've already experienced some disorientation.
LEADMALE:Rosemary, you didn't remember who the President of the United States was.
LEADFEMALE:I know Ronald Reagan is President.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't accept it.
LEADMALE:Look, if-if this is Alzheimer's, then then what do we do? How do we fight it how do we stop it? I'm afraid there's very little that we can do.
LEADMALE:Uh, some patients respond to some medication.
SUPMALE:We will be able to alleviate your anxiety a little.
LEADFEMALE:Work is being done, research, but right now, there's no known cure.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Aunt Rosemary's bags are all packed.
LEADMALE:Dad's up there with her now.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, Mom, this it's it just doesn't feel right to just let her go like this.
LEADFEMALE:We have no choice.
SUPMALE:We-we have to respect her wishes.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I'm worried about her traveling by herself.
OTHERMALE:Maybe Nick and I should go with her.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that'll be good.
LEADMALE:The three of you will wind up in China.
SUPMALE:Just about time.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, Dad, let me take these here.
SUPMALE:Oh, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:You gonna be all right? I've been reading about this disease.
LEADFEMALE:This Alzheimer's.
LEADFEMALE:It is cruel, honey.
LEADMALE:It-it is so bitter.
SUPMALE:It just robs you of your dignity, your humanity, your-your personality Elyse you have to find a way to deal with this.
SUPFEMALE:A way to get through it.
LEADFEMALE:Not just for yourself, but for Rosemary.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:We're out here.
LEADMALE:Um, before I forget I'm thirsty.
SUPMALE:Alex said your travel plans are confirmed.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, he took care of it.
LEADFEMALE:He's quite an organized little guy, isn't he? It's an area of interest.
LEADFEMALE:He also saved me money.
LEADMALE:That's one of his special areas of interest saving money.
OTHERMALE:He's a good boy, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:You should be proud.
SUPMALE:I am.
OTHERMALE:They're all good.
OTHERMALE:And they all have a lot of you in them; maybe that's why.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, now.
LEADMALE:Don't do that; it won't make things any easier.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, it's too early.
SUPMALE:There's time enough for that, from what I hear.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, I-I really just can't can't accept it.
LEADMALE:Well, I've thought of some good things about it, anyway.
SUPFEMALE:What? Well, from now on, I'll be able to do or say anything I damn please.
OTHERFEMALE:People won't know whether it's me or the Alzheimer's.
OTHERFEMALE:You always said anything you wanted to, anyway.
LEADMALE:And I won't have to worry about who my real friends are.
LEADMALE:This will be a time of weeding out those who love me just for my looks.
LEADMALE:I love these pictures.
LEADMALE:There's your mom, you, me.
OTHERMALE:There's Alex as a baby, hugging his first savings bond.
OTHERMALE:There's you and me.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's my favorite picture.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:This is my whole life right here.
LEADFEMALE:My mother, my father my grandparents, my children all of you all the people I've known and loved.
OTHERMALE:It's hard to believe that one day they'll just be pictures of people I don't recognize anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't I can't help feeling that I-I should do something.
OTHERFEMALE:That-that we should keep you here, that if I just held you tight enough, I could stop this thing from happening.
OTHERMALE:Want to try it? Can't hurt.
LEADMALE:I want you to take over.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you to keep the family members intact.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to keep the old stories alive.
LEADFEMALE:I really don't think I'm the right one for that.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:I want you to tell your grandchildren about us.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to tell them about my mom.
LEADMALE:It's important they should know where they come from.
SUPFEMALE:Rosemary, I Keep the old stories going.
LEADFEMALE:Tell them about Nora Corrigan.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember? Oh, I remember.
OTHERFEMALE:Then tell them about her.
LEADMALE:Tell me about her right now.
LEADFEMALE:The year was 1741.
LEADMALE:A black cloud hung over Ireland in the form of a brutal English rule.
SUPMALE:It was written that no Irish man or woman could own property worth more than five pounds sterling.
SUPMALE:Now, the handsome Nora Corrigan For that's how she was known had-had a boy ten years of age and she's recently been widowed, and the wicked Lord Calvert.
LEADFEMALE:Calvert had given her 24 hours to get off of her land.
LEADFEMALE:There was but one way out.
LEADMALE:Marry a British officer and pass the title over to him, in hopes that he would, one day, pass the title back to her.
LEADMALE:With no time for courting, and the sun sinking in the west, she made up her handsome mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Dressed in her most beautiful of gowns, her long hair flowing in the breeze, her boot steps echoing on the cobblestones, she strolled towards the tavern where the English officers were known to congregate.
SUPMALE:"Who among you," she cried out, "is man enough to marry me tonight?" Silence filled the smoky room.
LEADMALE:No one moved.
OTHERFEMALE:And then, a young officer, at least ten years her junior, stood up on the other corner of the hall and said, "I will marry you.
LEADMALE:" And she stretched out her handsome arm to the younger man, and he took it in his own.
LEADFEMALE:And they walked out together into the night.
LEADFEMALE:Into the village.
LEADFEMALE:Into history.
LEADFEMALE:And that, of course, was your great-great-great-great grandfather Devon.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now don't roll the dough too thin.
LEADMALE:The cookies will burn in the oven.
SUPFEMALE:Why can't we get them at the store like everybody else does? It's more fun this way.
LEADMALE:This is a special time between a mommy and her little boy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, just the two of us here together, kind of working, sharing, creating.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, they're just cookies.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! Okay, guy, we'll try it again tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hot cookies.
LEADMALE:Spud Webb.
LEADMALE:Hey, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:Andy, what are you wearing? An apron.
OTHERFEMALE:Take that off this minute.
SUPFEMALE:Guys don't wear aprons.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, that's my apron.
OTHERMALE:This is a totally inappropriate activity for Andy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh, making cookies? It's one step away from having his nails done.
LEADMALE:That's tomorrow.
LEADMALE:All right, it's time for the guys to take over, teach him a little grit.
SUPFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
OTHERMALE:We've-we've been raising him in a sensitive, nonsexist atmosphere for almost six years now.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything's worked out fine, right, Steven? Well, um, you know, uh sure, sure.
LEADMALE:But there's, uh, there's nothing wrong with a little balance.
SUPMALE:Little yin, a little, uh Yang.
LEADMALE:yang.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's, uh, maybe it's time to try something different, something guy-ish.
SUPFEMALE:Want to go shave? Hey, how about basketball, huh? Basketball.
LEADFEMALE:It'll teach you the thrill of competition, the exhilaration of exercise, the reward of team spirit.
OTHERMALE:You just want someone you can beat, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I beat you, blondie.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't have beaten me, Alex, if you'd have let me use both hands.
SUPMALE:Oh, I thought I heard Nick down here.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What's going on? - Thanks.
LEADMALE:Um, Nick had a job interview.
SUPFEMALE:He's supposed to come over here afterwards.
LEADMALE:What kind of job is Nick trying to get now? It's a grant.
LEADMALE:I saw the job listing on campus, and I knew Nick would be perfect for it.
LEADMALE:What is it? Dean of Admissions.
LEADFEMALE:I'll keep my fingers crossed, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Jen.
LEADMALE:Hey, what happened? Did you get it? When do you start? Aw, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't get the job.
SUPMALE:You know, I don't think I'm going to be Dean of Admissions.
LEADMALE:I am shocked.
LEADFEMALE:I, for one, am flabbergasted.
LEADFEMALE:Stunned.
SUPMALE:That's an outrage.
LEADMALE:Why not? You know, for one thing, the job starts at 9:00 in the morning, and I like to do my art then.
LEADMALE:Either that or lie there and stare at the ceiling.
SUPMALE:You don't want to give that up.
LEADMALE:What about being Dean of Admissions for night school? Nah, Mal, you know, I think this whole dean area is a dead issue.
LEADFEMALE:You can head up the English Department.
OTHERFEMALE:There was this other job that they thought I might be right for.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, janitor.
SUPMALE:Nick, I think you're on to something.
SUPFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, this is the janitor job at my sorority.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm the one who wrote the ad.
LEADMALE:"Janitor needed.
LEADMALE:Must have previous trash experience.
OTHERFEMALE:" How romantic.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you have previous trash experience, don't you, Nick? Well, I don't want to toot my own horn, you know.
OTHERMALE:This is exciting.
OTHERFEMALE:You, my sorority, trash.
LEADMALE:It's all coming together.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, there's just two more applicants for the janitor job.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Larry Briganti and Nick Moore.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, maybe you should sit out those interviews.
LEADMALE:I mean, with your boyfriend being one of the applicants and all.
LEADMALE:Karen, I'm going to be completely and totally impartial here.
OTHERFEMALE:I want what's best for the sorority.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Briganti, can you tell us something about your qualifications? I was chairman of the Custodial Institute of America from 1945 through 1980, Ohio Janitor of the Year 1983, and inventor of the world famous Johnny Mop.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's all fine and good, but, uh, have you ever worked at a sorority before? Can't say that I have.
LEADMALE:Well, do you think you could handle a place of this size? Well, I mean, if the White House wasn't a problem, I can't imagine this place would be.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:We'll-we'll have to get back to you.
LEADFEMALE:W-Well, let me know as soon as you can.
OTHERMALE:It's either this or the Taj Mahal.
LEADMALE:Nick Moore, please.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:That's janitor for "hello.
LEADMALE:" Sisters, this is Nick Moore.
LEADFEMALE:Let's give him a nice Gamma Delta Gamma "hi.
LEADMALE:" Hi.
LEADFEMALE:So, Nick, um, can you tell us something about yourself? Well, you know, I-I got to tell youse all right off, I have no janitorial experience.
LEADFEMALE:I like that.
LEADFEMALE:He's honest.
LEADMALE:That's the most important thing in a janitor.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you know, uh, I know if it wasn't for Mal here, I wouldn't even be considered for this job, and, uh, I got to tell youse, I feel a little bit nervous being around all you smart girls.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Nick, no, don't be, please.
LEADFEMALE:No one's ever been nervous around us.
OTHERFEMALE:No one's ever called us smart, either.
LEADMALE:Uh, you know, I can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:You see, uh, college is not a place that I'm all that familiar with.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, actually, uh, high school is not a place I'm all that familiar with, either.
SUPFEMALE:But, uh, reform school, ha! Now, there's something we could talk about.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, Nick, a formal education is not a requirement for this job.
LEADMALE:Hey, then I'm your guy.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, some-some interpersonal, uh, qualities you-you have that we might not know about could be helpful.
LEADFEMALE:Um, for instance, um, just a Are you an artist? Why, yes, I am.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! It might be great having an artist in residence.
OTHERMALE:He can help us with floats, banners, posters.
LEADMALE:Maybe he could help us come up with decorations - for the winter dance.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Well, uh, what seems to be the problem? We've tried paper snowflakes, paper snowmen.
SUPMALE:It's just, it's all been done before.
LEADFEMALE:We've got a wastebasket full of bad ideas.
SUPFEMALE:Well, wait a minute, here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, uh, what you see as, uh, bad ideas, I see as snowballs.
LEADMALE:What? Uh, you see, you could, uh, you could take a whole bunch of these and, uh, crumple them all up and cut them into snowballs and have a winter wonderland of snowballs for your sorority dance.
LEADFEMALE:I like that.
SUPMALE:I like that.
LEADFEMALE:Go with it.
OTHERMALE:Uh, see, you can, uh, throw them at each other and have a fight, or, uh, you can glue them together and make a fort, or you could just pour water on them and turn them into slush.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:All those in favor of Nick? Aye.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's settled.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome, Nick.
LEADMALE:Let's all give him a nice Gamma Delta Gamma "You're hired.
OTHERMALE:" You're hired! Okay, now, the object of the game is simply to toss this ball into the basket.
OTHERFEMALE:Humor him.
SUPMALE:All right, now try it.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Well, that's pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:That's pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:Now let me, uh, let me show you how it's done.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Oops.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, Dad, let me have a shot.
LEADFEMALE:I think Andy should have the pleasure of seeing the ball actually go through the hoop once.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the ball.
OTHERMALE:Forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, give me the ball.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm teaching him.
SUPMALE:Give me the ball! - I'm teaching him! Andy, let's get out of here before it gets ugly.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Two points! Oh! What is going on? We're-we're teaching Andy how to, how to play basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Andy - Andy? I don't want any more basketball in the house, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:You know, he really is a discipline problem, Mom.
LEADMALE:Cheater.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hey, you going out? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Nick's coming over to pick me up.
LEADMALE:We're going to go to his place and watch TV.
LEADFEMALE:How's Nick doing down at the sorority? Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Um, he gets along really well with all the girls, and they all think he's lots of fun.
LEADFEMALE:So he's always hanging out there and learning songs and stuff.
OTHERMALE:I-I really admire what Nick's doing.
SUPMALE:It must be awfully hard to be a janitor.
SUPMALE:Especially at your sorority.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he's really gotten into it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he's always there.
OTHERFEMALE:But today he's coming over, and it's just going to be the two of us together.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to make popcorn and watch cartoons.
OTHERFEMALE:The old think tank in action, huh? - Have a wonderful time.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Um, Nick, what's going on? Uh, Mal, little change of plans.
OTHERMALE:We're all going to go over the football game.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I-I thought we were going to spend the afternoon together.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, just the two of us.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know, you know, but that was before the girls asked me to go to the game.
OTHERMALE:You never liked football before, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:I never knew the cheers before.
SUPMALE:But now Hear us rave.
SUPFEMALE:Hear us rant.
SUPMALE:Win team, win.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go, Grant.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey! Hey! Hey.
SUPFEMALE:This is really scary.
LEADMALE:Come on, uh, you know, it's Sorority Day.
LEADMALE:All us girls get in for half price.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:I have a lot of homework to do.
SUPMALE:So you all go ahead and have fun.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:All right, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, we'll see you later, huh? And, uh, don't work too hard, huh? Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Hear us rave! Hear us rant! Win team, win! Let's go, Grant! Hey! - Okay.
LEADMALE:Where's Mallory? She's upstairs getting ready for her sorority dance.
SUPMALE:I want to give her this truck for her to bring with her tonight.
SUPMALE:That's a great idea, Andy.
LEADMALE:That'll make Mallory the only girl at the dance with a truck.
SUPMALE:Everybody will be really jealous.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's give Mallory that truck.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure she doesn't have anything like it in her closet.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's great.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on! - I'm telling.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, oh! Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, this is the one that counts.
SUPMALE:Hey, short stuff! Steven, we need a lightbulb up here! All right, you're both grounded.
LEADMALE:I told you this would happen.
LEADMALE:You told me? I told you.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I've been telling him for days.
SUPMALE:He started it.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Jen.
SUPFEMALE:That's a fabulous dress, Mallory.
SUPMALE:It really goes with the truck.
LEADMALE:Boy, you sure look great, honey.
LEADMALE:Really.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just not up for it tonight.
SUPMALE:I mean, ever since they made Nick an honorary member of the sorority, I never get to see him alone anymore.
LEADFEMALE:And when I do, it's always Gamma Delta Gamma this, Gamma Delta Gamma that.
SUPMALE:It's making me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:I never thought I-I'd have to call my boyfriend "Sister.
OTHERMALE:" Oh, I don't know, Mal, I think it's kind of cute.
OTHERMALE:I mean, picture him right now.
LEADFEMALE:He's at home, choosing an outfit, primping, putting on Dippity-do.
LEADMALE:I can't believe the way Nick has changed.
SUPMALE:Now he's hopping around all the time, perky, singing.
LEADFEMALE:It's like going out with Annette Funicello.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, did you tell him how you feel? No, not yet.
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Mal.
LEADFEMALE:It's Sister.
SUPMALE:Say, uh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton? - Mm-hmm? Would you be interested in buying some raffle tickets? - No, I - You see, we're trying to bring some members of our sorority over from China.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, th-that's great, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:We're just leaving, too.
SUPFEMALE:Ah-ah-ah, but-but-but let me share with you, uh, a little secret that I learned from the girls.
LEADFEMALE:Hairspray helps remove ink spots.
SUPFEMALE:Got it.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, Mal, you look great.
LEADMALE:Nick, I think you've been taking the sorority stuff a little too seriously.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Well, uh, you know, Mal, I was hoping maybe some of it would rub off on you.
SUPFEMALE:And if something does rub off on you, may I suggest rinsing it briskly with some Epsom salt.
LEADMALE:Nick, I think you're missing my point.
SUPMALE:I think you've become a little too involved with Gamma Delta Gamma.
OTHERMALE:Well, Mal, you know, I think you take Gamma Delta Gamma a little for granted.
OTHERMALE:You see, I don't think you show it enough respect.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, you know, I have been reviewing the, uh, Gamma Delta Gamma rule book, and, uh, I have found out that you break almost every rule in it.
LEADMALE:For instance, you should only entertain male visitors on the porch or in the parlor.
SUPMALE:You should never cross your legs while wearing a skirt.
LEADFEMALE:And at all sorority functions after 6:00 p.
LEADFEMALE:m.
OTHERMALE:, you should always wear gloves.
OTHERFEMALE:Nick, those rules are from 1937.
SUPMALE:Hey, so what? You know, you still got to follow them.
LEADMALE:Listen, Mal, I would really hate to bring you up on charges.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, you're a Gamma Delta Gamma girl, huh? Act like one.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, babe, great party, huh? Oh, yeah, it's great.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't mind me doing a little cleaning up now and then.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, go right ahead; it's your job.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, you know, say, you really should put that drink on a coaster, not on the table.
OTHERMALE:You're going to ruin the finish there.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Nick, congratulations.
OTHERMALE:Everyone just loves all the decorations.
LEADFEMALE:You really did a great job.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, thanks.
LEADMALE:My favorite is definitely the mothball igloo.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:You know, it's, uh, attractive and snow-like, yet it keeps pests away from our fine woolens.
LEADFEMALE:You're incredible.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, everyone! It's time to sing the Gamma Delta Gamma sisterhood song! Where did you get that verse? Ah-ah-ah, read your rule book.
SUPFEMALE:Nick, you really didn't have to sing that song.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, I did, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:If you read the rule book No, I don't want to read my rule book.
LEADFEMALE:And now, the moment that we've all been waiting for, the crowning of the 1987 Gamma Delta Gamma Winter Dance Snow Queen.
LEADMALE:I am so excited.
LEADMALE:You know, I've been pushing for you for Snow Queen all week.
LEADMALE:That's sweet, Nick.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:The new Snow Queen is Nick Moore! Whoa! I can't believe that my boyfriend's a Snow Queen.
LEADMALE:Uh, ladies, gentlemen, sisters this is a most momentous occasion.
LEADMALE:Nick, God, stop it! What do you think you're doing? Uh, Mal, I'm just saying my acceptance speech here.
SUPMALE:I Nick, Nick, take a look at yourself.
LEADMALE:You're not a sorority sister.
LEADMALE:I mean, what are you doing in a crown, a cape and a dozen roses? I won.
LEADMALE:Nick, you have a job here, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't you just show up, punch in your time card and go home? Okay, uh I'll leave.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:She moves! She fakes! She pumps to the left! She pumps to the right! She's all over the court! She sets her shot! - Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:How many times do I have to throw this thing away?! You're grounded.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:How was, uh, how was the dance? Aw, I had a terrible time.
LEADFEMALE:Nick spent half the evening cleaning up, and then he sang the Gamma Delta Gamma song solo, and then he was crowned Snow Queen.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like a full evening.
OTHERFEMALE:I yelled at him in front of everyone.
OTHERMALE:I mean, there he was, the Snow Queen, surrounded by his ladies-in-waiting and I just flipped out.
LEADMALE:Well, don't worry about it, Mal.
SUPMALE:Uh now that Nick is Queen I'm sure he'll calm down.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, didn't you talk to him? I mean, didn't you tell him you thought he was getting carried away? I tried; he wouldn't listen to me.
SUPMALE:He-he kept giving me etiquette lessons and household tips.
SUPMALE:Well, you know, I tried that hairspray trick.
LEADMALE:Really works.
LEADMALE:Oh, Nick! - Hey, Nick! Well, we've-we've heard the news.
LEADMALE:Congratulations! - Yeah.
SUPMALE:Nick, Nick, just tell me.
SUPFEMALE:Tell me, what-what do you think put you over the top? Was it talent? Swimsuit? Uh, just lucky, I guess.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's an honor to have the Snow Queen in our house.
LEADMALE:Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, good evening, Your Majesty.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Evening.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:So, uh, how'd the rest of the dance go? All right, I guess.
LEADFEMALE:Um, we had to elect a new Snow Queen.
SUPMALE:But, uh, you're still the runner-up.
LEADMALE:It's an important job.
OTHERFEMALE:Case the new Snow Queen can't fulfill all her responsibilities, you'd have to step in.
SUPMALE:Look, um, Mal, I've been thinking about what you said and, uh, how I've been acting lately, and I kind of realized that I went over the edge with this sorority stuff and Oh, no, no, I'm-I'm the one who I totally overreacted.
LEADMALE:I mean, you have a right to have fun.
LEADFEMALE:Not every guy gets to be Snow Queen.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you know, I just had no idea that it would bother you so much.
SUPMALE:You know, it's just, I got so caught up with being part of a group, a member of a club.
LEADFEMALE:I never had that.
SUPFEMALE:I It just felt good to belong.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I didn't know you needed that.
LEADMALE:I always thought you were a loner.
SUPMALE:You know, I never really did good in group situations.
LEADMALE:I never really fit in.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, the sorority was the first group that really accepted me as me.
LEADMALE:I finally fit in.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I felt like you fit in too well.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you were always at the sorority, and you were always with the girls.
LEADFEMALE:I never got to see you alone.
LEADFEMALE:And, um, I guess I felt a little threatened.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because I didn't feel special anymore.
LEADMALE:Because all of a sudden, you're-you're spending time with all these girls and you're having all this fun with them the kind of fun I thought you could only have with me.
OTHERFEMALE:And I I felt like you didn't need me anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'll always need you.
OTHERFEMALE:You are my girlfriend, they are just my sisters.
LEADMALE:Well, you're my sister, too Look, Mal, you are very, very special to me.
SUPMALE:I am? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Because you're the only girl that I'll ever love.
SUPMALE:I love you, Nick.
LEADMALE:I propose a toast.
LEADMALE:To the best janitor and Snow Queen in the history of Gamma Delta Gamma.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you got a coaster for that?
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Okay, now, here's what we do.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone take his own fortune cookie.
LEADMALE:And then we'll break our cookies and we'll read our fortunes aloud.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Andy, be very careful how you open that cookie.
OTHERMALE:There's an old Oriental proverb that says, "If you tear your fortune, you'll have bad luck.
LEADFEMALE:" Here, now, watch.
SUPFEMALE:Watch this.
OTHERMALE:This is That's real good, Dad.
LEADMALE:What's it say? "Stop telling people how to open fortune cookies.
LEADMALE:" Well, I got my usual one.
LEADMALE:"Fame, fortune and riches are yours for the asking Alex.
SUPMALE:" Here goes mine.
LEADMALE:"Alex, no more personalized fortunes until you pay up.
OTHERFEMALE:Signed Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Wong.
LEADFEMALE:" Uh, what does what does yours say, Andy? I ate mine.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, come on, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go find you another fortune.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE: Well, hi! Hello, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I hope you haven't come for dinner, Skip.
OTHERFEMALE:We're finished.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight's meat loaf surprise night at my house.
LEADMALE:Old Handelman tradition.
OTHERFEMALE:Just a regular meat loaf with many different foreign coins hidden in it.
LEADMALE:Sounds delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, can I please tell them my news now? Of course.
LEADMALE:I was just getting them warmed up.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I Everybody, I did something today that I never thought I'd do before.
SUPMALE:You wore plaids with checks? No.
SUPFEMALE:Something at school.
LEADFEMALE:You wrote in pen.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! 
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I have decided to run for school president.
SUPFEMALE:Great idea! - 
LEADMALE:Oh, that's terrific! - Good, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Wow! Tell me, Mal, how do they decide who's going to run for president of Grant? I mean, I mean, what do you what do you need to qualify for that, a "D" average and a pulse? They're not really strict about the "D" average.
LEADMALE:Honey, this is wonderful, but I got to admit I'm a little surprised.
LEADMALE:You've never shown any interest in politics before.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know I don't know.
LEADMALE:It just came to me out of nowhere.
OTHERMALE:I was sitting with a bunch of my friends, and they said, "Why don't you run?" And I said, "Are you kidding?" And then I thought, "Huh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It could be fun.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a neat job.
OTHERMALE:" So I said, "What the heck," you know?  That's pretty much the way Reagan decided to run.
OTHERMALE:Let me tell you one thing, 
LEADFEMALE:Don't take any, uh, political wisdom from Mom and Dad.
LEADMALE:What is that supposed to mean? Let's face it politically speaking, you two are the kiss of death.
OTHERMALE:I mean, just look at the candidates you supported.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, McGovern, Humphrey uh, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Excitement himself, Walter Mondale.
SUPFEMALE:Those names sound so familiar.
LEADMALE:Do they go to Grant? Look, Alex, we don't get involved in the campaigns just to win.
LEADFEMALE:We do it because we feel deeply about certain political or or moral issues.
LEADMALE:It would be nice to win occasionally.
LEADMALE:Well, then, you should work on Mallory's campaign, 'cause she's going to win.
LEADMALE:Everybody at school loves her.
LEADFEMALE:She's really popular.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy's my campaign manager.
LEADFEMALE: Well well, uh, no, you're you're well on your way.
SUPMALE:I just thought Skippy could, uh, help me keep in touch with all the people at Grant that nobody talks to.
LEADFEMALE:I'm close with them.
SUPFEMALE: Wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Listen listen to my fortune.
LEADMALE:"Good fortune will soon smile on you.
OTHERFEMALE:" It's good luck for the campaign.
SUPMALE:What does yours say, Skippy? "You have 15 minutes to live.
LEADFEMALE:" How does this sound for a campaign slogan? - "Vote for Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:" - Um We need something more direct, livelier.
LEADMALE:How about just, "Vote"? That's-that's good, Skippy, but it doesn't say for who.
SUPMALE:Well, you could stand next to the sign.
LEADFEMALE:But I can't be everywhere at once.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's it.
LEADFEMALE:"Vote for Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:She can't be everywhere at once.
LEADFEMALE:" - Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Mallory, congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:I heard you're running for president of Grant.
LEADFEMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Too bad I can't vote for you.
SUPMALE:Aw.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? Skippy, only students at Grant can vote in this election.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Well, there goes my grandma's vote.
SUPMALE:What's this, Mal, material for your campaign? Yes, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Don't look at it.
LEADMALE:You'll just make fun of it.
LEADMALE: No! No, not at all.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm glad you're getting involved.
LEADFEMALE:I'm interested.
LEADFEMALE:What, uh what's your campaign platform? What's my platform, Skippy? We're trying to run a campaign here.
OTHERMALE:We don't have time to build a platform.
LEADFEMALE: I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Hi, Amy.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Uh, this is Amy Sussman, Skippy's girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Amy, this is Lauren.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:How you doing? - 
SUPFEMALE:Sorry I'm late, guys.
SUPMALE:Amy is my campaign treasurer.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, gang! - Well, well, it looks like we walked in on this big, executive campaign meeting.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, you know, Mal, uh, maybe I can help you.
LEADMALE:Uh, I don't want to brag, but I-I was president in college.
LEADFEMALE:Really, Dad? You were president of your school? Well, not exactly the entire school.
LEADMALE:I was, uh, president of the South Campus Aluminum Can Recycling Club.
LEADMALE: And a damn fine one, too.
SUPMALE:Well, uh Excuse me, but if but if Mallory's going to win, she's going to need something more than a "give a hoot, don't pollute" platform.
LEADMALE:Oh, I like that.
LEADFEMALE:Can we use it, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton? - Be my guest, Skip.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good-bye.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to go pick Andy up at school.
LEADFEMALE:Would you mind dropping me off at campus? - Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, not at all, Lauren.
LEADMALE:It'll give me time to, uh, tell you a little bit about the work I did as president of the recycling club.
LEADMALE:Steven, I've heard that story a million times.
LEADFEMALE:Sit in the back, Elyse.
LEADMALE:You know, I had a little slogan, and I had a little magnet I think the first thing we need is a, uh a good campaign strategy.
LEADFEMALE:Any ideas? I have a few ideas.
OTHERMALE:But first, I have a question.
LEADMALE:What exactly is a campaign strategy? Well, a campaign strategy is a 
OTHERMALE:Alex I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:It's your campaign.
LEADMALE:You guys run with it.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead, Mal.
OTHERMALE:Uh a campaign strategy, huh? What's something that you really believe in? Like, uh, more study hours, hard work, good grades.
LEADFEMALE:No, not those.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what, then? Well, I guess I feel that the students should have more of a say in what goes on at Grant.
SUPFEMALE:Like, remember last year, out of the blue, all of a sudden, they took out the diet soda machine? And-and I said, "This is wrong.
LEADMALE:" A lot of people a lot of people agreed.
LEADFEMALE:There you go, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:That's good.
SUPMALE:That's good.
LEADMALE:That's something the students can get behind.
LEADFEMALE:Diet soda? Well, it's not just diet soda, Mal.
LEADMALE:It's-it's a vision that you stand for, uh, to make life easier and more pleasurable for weight-conscious students.
LEADFEMALE:"Vote for Mal, go low-cal.
LEADMALE:" Look, Alex, I don't know if I can get the soda machine put back in.
LEADMALE:And I don't want to make promises I can't keep.
SUPMALE:Well, you have no place in politics.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll tell you I'd vote for someone who could get that soda machine back.
LEADFEMALE:There you go, Mal.
SUPMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:I can feel the groundswell starting.
LEADMALE: I'll tell you something else.
LEADFEMALE:I miss the low-fat chocolate milk with the twisty straws.
LEADFEMALE:Who doesn't? Who doesn't? I can feel it, Mal.
OTHERFEMALE:You're going to win this thing.
SUPFEMALE:I do have another idea about changing the color of the drapes in the student center.
LEADMALE:I like it.
SUPFEMALE:It's hip.
LEADMALE:It's fresh.
LEADMALE:It's contemporary.
SUPFEMALE:It's what the people want.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, Mal, there's only one ingredient missing here for a winning campaign.
LEADMALE:Let's see, we've got diet soda, chocolate milk and drapes.
LEADFEMALE:What's she missing? Oh, Alex, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm nervous about this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:You've got nothing to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:It's the first day on the campaign trail.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go out there and let's get 'em, huh? Remember our platform? "Confidence, diet soda and new drapes.
OTHERMALE:" All right, let's go.
LEADFEMALE: Hi there.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Uh, I'd like you to meet Mallory Keaton, uh, candidate for student government president.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How-how how's your sandwich? Not bad.
SUPFEMALE: Oh.
LEADMALE:It looks a little dry.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you could use a diet soda to go with that.
LEADMALE:I hate diet soda.
SUPFEMALE:MALLORY 
LEADMALE:What do I do? - Try the drapes, try the drapes.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Don't you think we could use some new drapes in here? I mean, these are so ugly.
SUPMALE:My mother made those drapes.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, why does it have to be so complicated? Why can't I just put up posters, pass out buttons and take my chances? Because you want to win, okay? And you're going to win.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
SUPFEMALE:Trust me.
LEADFEMALE:I've got every detail worked out.
LEADMALE: Look, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Mallory Keaton, our choice for student government president.
OTHERMALE:She looks just like she does on these buttons.
LEADMALE:And these posters.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, is it true that you're planning on getting a new soda machine for the snack bar? And low-fat chocolate milk with twisty straws? Well, I was thinking about it.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, what's going on? 
OTHERMALE:Mallory, it's me, Skippy.
LEADMALE: Hey! Where is a guy supposed to get a diet soda around this place? And a room with some decent drapes? Well you raise a fine point, young man.
OTHERMALE:You know you know, Grant College is in desperate need of new, fresh leadership.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you are damn right, you know, and I don't even go to school here.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, what's going on? Hey, Mal, it's me, Nick.
OTHERMALE: Excuse me, did you say something about a soda machine? Yes, she did.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, she did.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, have you seen Mallory's position paper? Alex, I haven't seen my position paper.
SUPMALE:Look at 
LEADFEMALE:"If elected, Mallory Keaton promises to put an end to pop quizzes.
LEADMALE:"  - What? - If you like that if you like that, try number three.
SUPFEMALE:"Frequent flyer bonus miles for commuting students.
SUPFEMALE:"  We can't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, look at these people.
OTHERMALE:They're delirious.
SUPMALE:They'll do anything for you.
LEADMALE:Just go with it.
LEADMALE:Go with it.
LEADFEMALE:"Free trips to Hawaii for all students with passing grades in two or more subjects!"  - Alex! - Yeah! Don't worry about it! The plane will be empty.
LEADFEMALE:STUDENTS 
SUPMALE:Mallory! Mallory! Mallory! Mallory! Mallory! Mallory Hey! What have you got there, Andy? A poster for Mallory's campaign.
SUPFEMALE:Alex asked me to hang it up in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh, well, what is it, uh Well it's good to see the campaign has brought out Alex's sense of fairness.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory wasn't even on the first poster.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE: Hi, honey.
OTHERMALE:Oh, did you, uh? - I'm so t Oh, great! He finally put my picture on it.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Where have you been, honey? Oh, all over.
SUPFEMALE:Alex has the Keaton campaign trail fully booked.
LEADMALE:I was over on campus this morning passing out campaign buttons to people in the infirmary.
SUPFEMALE:Alex said I should get them in a weakened state.
LEADFEMALE:And then I was over at the snack bar passing out little mustard packets with "Let Mallory spice up your life" printed on 'em.
SUPMALE:Oh, here are some extras.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:And then, uh, we finished it off with a lengthy stint on the Keaton campaign truck.
LEADFEMALE:The Keaton campaign truck? - Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:MAN 
SUPMALE:Mallory Keaton for Grant College student presidency.
LEADMALE:Mallory's campaign manager, Alex P.
OTHERMALE:Keaton!  I want to see it! I want to talk through the microphone! Come on, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:We'll go take a look.
LEADFEMALE: Are you enjoying the campaign? It's tiring, but it's fun.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I've been speaking in public.
LEADMALE:I've met everyone on campus.
LEADMALE:And I've I've had a chance to really listen to people and find out what they're thinking.
LEADFEMALE:What are they thinking? Well, some are thinking about their future, and some are concerned about academics, and some are just sort of staring straight ahead.
SUPMALE:Well, that sounds great.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It's a good experience for you.
LEADMALE:Well, I-I think it's nice.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's a chance for you and Alex - to get to work together again.
SUPMALE:Mm-hmm.

SUPFEMALE:It's been great.
LEADFEMALE:We're getting along really well.
OTHERFEMALE:We haven't been fighting at all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think it's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, particularly knowing Alex, you'd think that he'd be, you know M-A-double L-O-R-Y.
LEADMALE:That spells "Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:" going overboard.
LEADMALE:Well, Mal, we've got that new campaign poster.
SUPMALE:I think it's going to add a new dimension to the campaign.
OTHERMALE:MAN 
LEADFEMALE:Mallory Keaton for Grant College student presidency.
LEADFEMALE:ANDREW

SUPMALE:Absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you go over your acceptance speech? Oh.
LEADMALE:"This is truly a glorious day for freedom-loving people everywhere.
SUPFEMALE:" Alex, I only promised them a soda machine, not a revolution.
LEADFEMALE:Could we tone it down? Yeah, absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mom, um "This is truly a glorious day for carbonated beverage-loving people everywhere.
OTHERMALE:" Alex, if I'm elected president, I'm going to have to start making some of my own decisions.
LEADMALE:Uh, what what do you mean, Mal? I'm saying things that would not normally come out of my mouth.
SUPFEMALE:That's because they're coming out of my mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I don't know if I just want to be a puppet.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, suddenly puppet's not good enough for you.
LEADFEMALE:It just doesn't feel like me.
LEADMALE:Look, Mal, we've come this far together.
LEADMALE:Once you're president, you can do whatever you want.
LEADFEMALE:But for now, please, trust me, okay? - 
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, where were you guys? - We went to vote.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, what took so long? I got stuck in the voting booth.
SUPMALE:I couldn't get those little curtains to open up.
LEADMALE:I tried to help him out, and I got stuck in there myself.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:How are you? - Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Nick.
SUPMALE:Hey! I, uh, got you these for good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:That's sweet.
SUPFEMALE:It was no big deal, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, if you get elected president, then I'll be the first lady of Grant College.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure they'll use that in all the brochures.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, nothing for the campaign manager? Just this.
LEADMALE:No flowers? Nothing? If you win.
LEADFEMALE: Alex, quick, turn on the radio! They're announcing the election results! 
SUPMALE:Oh! - 
LEADMALE:Come on, Andy.
LEADMALE: Hey! - Nervous, Mal? - Oh, a little bit, but I'm excited, too.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:RADIO 
SUPMALE:This is WGRW, the voice of Grant College.
SUPMALE:Grant College conveniently located near all major highways.
LEADFEMALE:Just get to the results.
OTHERMALE:We don't have the final totals just yet in today's student government presidential election.
LEADMALE:Ah, what what, are you having trouble counting the votes? 
OTHERMALE:We're having a little trouble counting the votes.
SUPFEMALE:It's not that the votes aren't in; it's just that we're having trouble counting them.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we finally got this sorted out! The new president of Grant College is Marsha Elkins.
SUPFEMALE: What?! 
LEADMALE:Marsha Elkins.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:Mal, you were great, really.
LEADFEMALE:You tried  Speech! Speech! Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks, everybody, for your support.
LEADMALE:You know, you really worked hard, and it means a lot.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks to everyone who voted for me, and thanks to my family and and my brother and campaign manager, Alex P.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton.
OTHERMALE: Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE: He taught me to strive hard and do my best, and who, I'm sure, would want me to be gracious in defeat.
LEADFEMALE:Marsha Elkins that idiot! I demand a recount.
SUPMALE:I demand a recount.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry you didn't win, Mal.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm fine, though.
LEADFEMALE:It's really no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's easy for you to say.
LEADMALE:Your mother and I thought we were finally going to win an election.
SUPFEMALE:Alex says, "If you want to win, you have to vote Republican.
OTHERMALE:" Go back to sleep.
SUPFEMALE: Alex, where were you? Oh, I was over at the math department trying to get the final tally on the vote.
OTHERFEMALE:Took a while because they were counting on their fingers.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, uh, they were right.
LEADFEMALE:You lost by 103 votes.
SUPMALE:We're proud of you, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Takes a lot of courage just to run.
LEADFEMALE:And I know how hard you tried, Mal.
LEADMALE:I, uh I've never mentioned this before, but the first time I ran for president of the South Campus Aluminum Can Recycling Club I lost.
LEADFEMALE:It was to Warren McCracken.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, the-the interesting thing about Warren, he he had a nose for aluminum.
SUPMALE:He he could spot an aluminum can at Give it up, Dad.
SUPMALE:You know, Mal, this election is not over by a long shot.
SUPFEMALE:First thing in the morning, I'm going back to that campus and I'm going to demand another recount.
OTHERFEMALE:Another recount? Why? Because, Mal, there were numerous voting irregularities there.
LEADMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:I committed them.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Alex, it's over.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I-I-I ran, I tried hard, and-and I lost, and that's it.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you do it? I mean, why did you suddenly get so involved with my life? I don't know, Mal.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:I guess, um I guess I-I I just finally saw something we could do together.
LEADMALE:I mean, something we had in common.
LEADMALE:I just I just wanted to jump at the chance to do it.
LEADMALE:Pretty soon, we're not going to be living under the same roof together anymore.
SUPMALE:Are you trying to tell me that you're moving out? Don't get too excited, Mal.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to be sensitive here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Anyway, the fact is, um, pretty soon, we we may not be seeing each other that much.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh, I'm going to graduate, marry Lauren, get a job on Wall Street, move to New York.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm going to graduate, marry Nick and get a job in the fashion industry and move to New York.
LEADFEMALE:You aren't going to live uptown, are you? Downtown.
LEADMALE:Well, there you go.
SUPMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:We won't be seeing Anyway, I just wanted to make the most of the last times we have together.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know, it's funny, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Any any time we try to do something together, it turns out to be a disaster.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, that's not true.
SUPFEMALE:That's not true.
LEADMALE:We've had some very good times together.
SUPFEMALE:You remember when we were kids? Saturday mornings, okay? Mom and Dad would sleep late.
SUPMALE:And we'd come down at 6:30 in the morning in our pajamas.
SUPFEMALE:Right, exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I was five, and you were about seven.
LEADMALE:Um, I'd start breakfast, and you'd go down in the driveway and get the Wa// Street Journa/.
LEADMALE:Mom and Dad would always leave out that box of granola, - 'cause they didn't want us to eat sugared cereals.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:We used to go over to Skippy's and get Fruit Loops.
LEADMALE:You'd think they'd notice we had the same box of granola for 12 years.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know when else we had fun? Uh, remember when Mom and Dad finally decided we could stay home without a babysitter? And we'd make popcorn and watch TV? And we were supposed to be in bed, asleep by 11:00, and we were too scared to turn out the lights? No, I I wasn't scared.
LEADMALE:Alex, you used to cry until Mom and Dad came home.
SUPMALE:I missed them.
LEADMALE:So we'd we'd go up to my room and talk, and and I'd tell you which boys I liked in school, and you'd tell me which ones had the best earning potential.
LEADFEMALE:And look who you wound up with.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:We don't talk like that anymore.
LEADFEMALE:It's too bad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's an interesting thing, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I mean, I can argue politics with Dad or, uh, discuss family stuff with Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Or discuss economics with Jennifer.
OTHERMALE:But you you understand my emotional side better than anybody.
OTHERMALE:Really? I didn't think you even had one.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Remember the night after Ellen left for Paris? You stayed up all night, you know, talking to me and listening to me.
LEADMALE:You understood.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll never forget those nights you stayed up trying to teach me long division.
LEADFEMALE:You got a concussion from banging your head against the wall.
SUPFEMALE:I still don't understand it.
SUPMALE:You know, I'm going to look back on life in this house, and I'm going to remember those mornings.
SUPMALE:And I'm going to remember the nights babysitting.
LEADMALE:And I'm going to remember tonight.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE: Sorry about the election, huh? We'll get 'em next year.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, not a chance.
SUPFEMALE:I got an idea.
LEADMALE:What? I have an idea.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow morning, we'll wake up just like we used to.
OTHERMALE:We come down in our pajamas, and we make breakfast.
SUPMALE:Granola is still here.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Andy, it's way past your bedtime.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mom, you said I can stay up till Uncle Rob gets here! Well, I didn't realize they'd be here so late.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:You can see Uncle Rob and your cousins in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mom, come on.
LEADMALE:It's-it's a pivotal point in the game.
SUPMALE:Okay, Dad, go fish.
LEADMALE:You sly dog.
OTHERMALE:So how come Uncle Rob's coming so late anyway? Oh, he got one of those cheapo flights very inexpensive, but not too convenient.
LEADFEMALE:It stops twice in St.
SUPMALE:Louis.
LEADMALE:Why does it stop twice in St.
SUPMALE:Louis? They're practicing takeoffs and landings.
LEADFEMALE:It's not like Uncle Rob to fly cheapo.
LEADMALE:He usually goes first class.
LEADMALE:Well, that's all changed.
LEADMALE:Rob doesn't have much money since the divorce.
SUPMALE:Huh.
SUPFEMALE:Show me the man who does.
OTHERMALE:Maureen said it was a very fair settlement.
LEADFEMALE:Pshaw.
LEADFEMALE:Rob said so, too.
SUPFEMALE:The reason there's not much money is that, uh, Rob switched careers.
SUPFEMALE:He's, uh, given up accounting.
SUPMALE:Oh, what's he doing now? I'm not sure what he's doing now.
SUPMALE:Maybe he's an astronaut.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my guess.
SUPMALE:I wish he'd get here.
SUPFEMALE:I'm getting sleepy.
OTHERMALE:I almost forgot.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Andy, let's go to bed.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Mal.
OTHERMALE:Oh, give him a minute, Elyse! - Come on, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Well The game's not over! You lose, Dad.
LEADMALE:Good night, Andrew.
SUPMALE:Okay, that's them.
SUPMALE:Now, let's not forget that Rob and the kids have really gone through a tough time lately.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's try and remember to be sensitive to that.
LEADMALE:You know, when I talked to Rob, he didn't sound like a guy who'd been through a tough time.
SUPMALE:He didn't sound down at all! He sounded happy! Dad, will you stop bugging me?! Listen, Marilyn, if you're going to talk to me that way, let's get back on the plane and go home, that's all! Sounds happy as a clam.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Rob! - Hey! - Hi! How are you? - Hi, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Hey, Stevie! - How you doing, bro? Hey! Who's this? Alex! Andy! Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look at you, Jonathan! You really shot up! How you been? I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:And how you been, Marilyn? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Well, everyone's fine.
LEADFEMALE:That's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Marilyn, I think you could fill them in a little more, don't you, honey? No, Dad, I don't.
SUPMALE:I really have nothing else to say.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want to come here, the flight was miserable, and I'm counting the hours till we go home.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, can I talk to you upstairs? Well, I find her candor refreshing.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I would really appreciate if you didn't read the newspaper at the table.
SUPMALE:Why is that, dear? Don't call me "dear.
SUPFEMALE:" And don't read the paper while we're at the table together.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mal we're not married.
OTHERMALE:And isn't it wonderful? Look, if I want to read at the table, I'm going to read at the table.
SUPMALE:Okay? There are no rules.
LEADFEMALE:It is considered proper etiquette among civilized people to engage in conversation at the table.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Engage me.
LEADFEMALE:No, you start.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do I have to start? It's the gentlemanly thing to do.
LEADMALE:You're really getting on my nerves, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:All right, fine.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'll start.
SUPFEMALE:I'll start.
LEADMALE:What the hell were you and Marilyn talking about in the bathroom last night? You-you had the door locked, you had the water running, and-and I couldn't hear a thing.
LEADFEMALE:None of your business.
LEADFEMALE:Nice chatting with you.
LEADMALE:Uh, what were you and Marilyn talking about in the bathroom last night? Steven, really! That's none of our business.
LEADFEMALE:Unless Mallory wants to tell us.
LEADFEMALE:I am shocked.
LEADFEMALE:I am scandalized.
OTHERFEMALE:When someone needs to talk to someone, and they invite that someone into the bathroom, that means complete secrecy.
OTHERMALE:That's true.
LEADMALE:It's true.
LEADFEMALE:It's the international room of secrecy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm surprised governments don't meet in the bathroom.
SUPMALE:Marilyn just had some things on her mind.
LEADFEMALE:Some pretty heavy stuff.
LEADMALE:Reaction to the divorce and all.
LEADMALE:But it's between Marilyn and me Good morning! Good morning, Uncle Rob.
LEADMALE:Hi, Rob.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Rob.
OTHERFEMALE:Could I get you some breakfast? We got muffins Oh, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:I've gotten to be quite a good hand at breakfast lately.
SUPFEMALE:I swear, I'm eating like I'm 16.
LEADFEMALE:It's working outdoors; that's what does it.
LEADMALE:Outdoors? Well, what are you doing now, Rob? I'm working for the phone company.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Uncle Rob! Mallory, take it easy.
SUPMALE:You're all flushed.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of work are you doing? I'm a lineman.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the guy you see up on the poles.
LEADMALE:Up on the poles! Get her some water.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:I just think, well, it must be pretty exciting being up there with all those conversations whizzing by.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you found something that makes you happy, Rob.
OTHERFEMALE:Although, I never thought you'd be working outdoors.
OTHERFEMALE:Quite a switch from being a CPA.
SUPMALE:Ah, that's just it, Stevie.
LEADFEMALE:I'm 45 and I'm the new guy on the job.
LEADFEMALE:I'm learning, I'm working with my hands, I'm fixing things.
SUPFEMALE:I'm outside in Buffalo, the wind's whipping off the lake, uh, my hands are so cold, I-I can't even hold my coffee.
LEADMALE:I got icicles hanging off my nose and I've got a pole to climb.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, could you ask for more? No.
SUPFEMALE:It sounds great.
OTHERMALE:Look at this.
SUPFEMALE:I got calluses.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, boy! Well, are they great? I love 'em.
SUPFEMALE:It means I'm a lineman, you know, a working stiff.
SUPMALE:We got to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I got to admit, you never looked better.
LEADMALE:Ah, thanks, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like a kid, you know? I'm working hard, I'm playing hard Oh! Did I tell you? I'm on a bowling team.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, no.
LEADMALE:Mommy! Mommy! The park was great! Marilyn swung me all the way up to the sky.
LEADMALE:Andy, you weren't supposed to tell anyone about that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I meant we were in the sandbox the whole time.
LEADFEMALE:We have witnesses! And we didn't have ice cream for breakfast, either.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that covers what we didn't do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's great.
SUPMALE:I'm glad to see you cousins are getting to know each other.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, can I get you some breakfast? Oh, no, thanks, Aunt Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get something at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:You ready? You're asking Mal if she's ready to go to the mall? I don't go to the mall that much, Alex.
LEADMALE:Mallory, the mannequins wave to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Marilyn? Mare? I, uh, I didn't know you were going to be running off so early, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I-I thought maybe we could spend some time together today.
LEADMALE:No, I'm going to the mall with Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so, Dad.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't want to get in your way.
OTHERFEMALE:Case you want to pick up any girls.
LEADMALE:Marilyn knows that I was seeing Kathy when I was here last, that, uh, we were having an affair.
LEADFEMALE:She won't forgive me for it.
SUPFEMALE:You know, she and Mallory were locked in the bathroom talking with the water running for more than an hour last night.
LEADMALE:It's none of our business.
LEADMALE:I'll be darned.
LEADMALE:I only see her one weekend a month.
SUPMALE:It's supposed to be more, but, uh, she doesn't want to come, so I don't push it.
LEADMALE:I'm out there in space with her somewhere.
SUPFEMALE:Some kind of mutant father who doesn't live in the same house with his children, doesn't have a wife, doesn't even have a key to his own front door.
OTHERMALE:Doesn't know what the hell he's doing.
SUPFEMALE:When he walked up to me, I swear I could feel my knees turn to lasagna.
OTHERMALE:Could you tell? Well, I wouldn't say lasagna specifically, but I did see you sway.
SUPFEMALE:And then you stabilized.
SUPFEMALE:And I said to myself, "She is a Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:" I'm not imagining how cute he is, am I? He is "to die for" cute.
LEADMALE:How old do you think he is? Well, at least 18.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you have to be to be a Marine.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh, did I interrupt something? Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:If I interrupted something and you'd like to continue your little chat, may I direct you to our bathroom facilities.
LEADMALE:Which, I believe, are available at this time.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Alex.
SUPMALE:That's very thoughtful.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey, think nothing of it.
OTHERMALE:Think nothing of it.
LEADMALE:Just go on up there, lock the door, turn on the water and do that yakety yak.
LEADFEMALE:Yakety yak.
LEADMALE:Don't talk back.
SUPFEMALE:All right, how is this for a great idea? Dinner, movie And after, if everyone's good Ice cream.
LEADMALE:Whoa! Come on, Mare, you coming? Um, I-I can't, Dad.
OTHERMALE:I'm going out.
SUPFEMALE:I have a date.
SUPFEMALE:No, you don't have a date.
SUPMALE:Oh, I do.
SUPFEMALE:Who's this date with? A guy I met at the mall with Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:No, you can't run around a strange city with a guy you met at a mall.
LEADMALE:We're not going to be running around.
LEADMALE:We're going dancing at the Hot House.
LEADFEMALE:You remember the Hot House, don't you, Dad? That where you went dancing with, uh, what's her name? What was her name? Kathy? Kathy.
LEADFEMALE:That's not necessary, Marilyn.
SUPFEMALE:And neither is this little scene.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:I want you back by 11:00.
LEADFEMALE:You hear me? No, 10:30! Do you hear that? 10:30! Hey, Uncle Rob, what you doing? I'm fixing this lamp for your mother.
SUPMALE:You know, Dad's been working on that lamp for almost a year now.
LEADMALE:He's almost got it completely broken.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, he's not too happy that I'm doing this.
LEADMALE:Hurts his pride, you know? He fancies himself a real handy guy.
SUPFEMALE:Dad handy? He's one of the only living Americans to lock himself in the trunk of his own car.
SUPMALE:What time do you have, Alex? It's almost midnight.
SUPMALE:I told Marilyn 10:30.
LEADFEMALE:You heard me, right? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't worry about that, Uncle Rob.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she'll be back any minute.
LEADFEMALE:You just, you got to go with the flow in these things.
LEADMALE:Go with the flow, huh? Oh, Alex, I can't wait till you're a father.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, when I have a daughter, it's not going to be a problem.
LEADFEMALE:She's not going to be able to get across the moat.
SUPMALE:Uncle Rob, um, you and I, we're similar kind of guys, right? I mean, we're both conservative.
LEADFEMALE:We're both Republican.
LEADMALE:We're both heady guys.
SUPMALE:Granted, uh, you've you've been through a lot of change.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, what with the divorce and all.
SUPMALE:And maybe you know, maybe you're not as conservative as you once were.
OTHERMALE:I mean maybe not even a Republican anymore.
OTHERMALE:Although that would rip my heart clean out.
SUPMALE:But-but-but let's let's just say you're not.
LEADMALE:I could understand that.
LEADMALE:I mean, I could.
OTHERFEMALE:Hell, I've done it for my parents.
SUPFEMALE:But what but what I can't understand is why anyone with your earning potential would want to sit at a table all night and fix a lamp.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's very satisfying, Alex.
LEADMALE:This great feeling that comes from working with your hands.
LEADFEMALE:Are you still a Republican? How's she coming, Robbo? Ah, getting there, Stevo.
SUPMALE:Need a hand? - No, Stevo.
LEADMALE:Robbo doesn't need a hand.
SUPFEMALE:Do you, Robbo? No, Mommo.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Robbo's doing bueno.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, if Pop could only see us now, huh? His two sons vying for the chance to fix a lamp.
SUPFEMALE:Would he laugh.
LEADMALE:He always said, "You boys are not going to use your hands.
OTHERMALE:"You're going to college no tools, you hear me? "I don't want to see either of you with even a hammer in your hand unless you're opening a coconut.
SUPMALE:" And yet, we both ended up with tremendous ability in this area.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to sleep.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good night, hon.
OTHERMALE:Sleep well.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Mal? - Huh? Marilyn, uh, she didn't come back yet.
SUPFEMALE:Did you meet the guy she went out with tonight? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, uh, who is he? I mean, what's he like? Um, well, I don't know his name, Uncle Rob.
LEADFEMALE:But don't worry, she's in good hands.
LEADFEMALE:He's a Marine.
LEADFEMALE:Well, on that note, I'm going to head up.
LEADFEMALE:Night.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Alex.
LEADMALE:Uncle Rob, I got to know.
SUPFEMALE:Are you? Am I what? Still a Republican.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I am.
LEADMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
SUPMALE:I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:You-you-you may fix lamps and you may climb poles, but you're not washed up yet.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, I I'm going to sleep like a baby.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's after midnight and my daughter's out with the Marines.
SUPMALE:Look, uh, Rob, I don't begin to understand how hard this must be for you and Marilyn, but you can't just abdicate.
OTHERMALE:You can't give way like this.
LEADFEMALE:I can't afford to waste the few hours a month I do get to spend with her arguing about these things, Stevie.
LEADMALE:I want to be a good guy.
SUPMALE:But you're her father, Rob.
SUPMALE:By a thread, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to lose her.
LEADMALE:So I'm letting her go.
LEADFEMALE:That's no attitude, Rob.
LEADMALE:You got to let her know where the line is.
SUPFEMALE:The line she can't cross.
SUPMALE:You got to be strong.
OTHERFEMALE:Loving but strong and decisive.
LEADFEMALE:Like you? Like me.
OTHERFEMALE:Like him.
LEADMALE:Damn right.
LEADFEMALE:I've had two 17-year-olds.
OTHERMALE:And I know give them an inch, they'll wipe you out.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I've been there.
LEADMALE:So has she.
SUPMALE:I was there with him.
LEADMALE:It was hell.
LEADMALE:I have daughters, Rob.
SUPFEMALE:I know what you're going through.
OTHERFEMALE:When Mallory turned 17, I made it very clear.
LEADMALE:I wanted to take an active part in deciding what type of young man she would be dating.
SUPMALE:How'd she wind up with Nick? She didn't listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Andy, it's after midnight.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think it's time for bed? - Shh.
OTHERFEMALE:Jonathan's telling a story.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's your manners? Go on, Jonathan.
SUPMALE:Well, now my mom's going out with this guy named Eddy Wheaton.
LEADMALE:He's a real nice guy, and she says maybe someday they'll get married.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not so happy about that because then my name becomes Jonathan Keaton Wheaton.
SUPFEMALE:So, how does it work, Jonathan? I mean, when do you see your mom and when do you see your dad? I spend one week with each.
LEADFEMALE:I go back and forth.
LEADMALE:It's not bad.
SUPFEMALE:So, your mommy and daddy can't tuck you in on the same night? I'm too old to get tucked in.
LEADMALE:Let's say you weren't.
SUPMALE:Then no, they can't tuck me in on the same night.
SUPFEMALE:That's wild.
OTHERMALE:Room for one more, you wacky night owls? Andy, it is nine hours past your bedtime.
LEADFEMALE:Is, uh, Marilyn back yet? No, no, she's not.
LEADMALE:Uncle Rob's getting a little worried about it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Dad gets worried a lot lately.
SUPMALE:What were you guys talking about? - We were talk - Nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:What were you talking about, Andy? Divorce.
LEADMALE:It's not bad, but you can't get tucked in.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hey, hey, you guys can talk about divorce all you want.
OTHERMALE:I won't say a word.
LEADMALE:Oh, great, here it comes.
OTHERMALE:Divorce does not affect me in any way.
LEADMALE:All right, well, first of all, Mom and Dad aren't going to get divorced in the first place, but even if they were I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you know, in a year or two, I'm out of here.
OTHERMALE:A year or two? Well, is there anything we can do to speed that up? My only concern is that I'm going to have to support Mom and Dad in their old age.
SUPMALE:I mean, that's the question.
SUPMALE:How much, and when does it start? Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, we were just talking about you.
OTHERFEMALE:Andy, what in the world are you doing up at this hour? Waiting for you to tuck me in.
OTHERMALE:It's your fault.
LEADFEMALE:We tucked you in.
OTHERMALE:Oh, then it must be my fault.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Alex doesn't care if you get divorced.
SUPMALE:What? - What? No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, what I what I said was I didn't think you would ever get divorced.
LEADFEMALE:But if you did, I said "I don't care.
LEADMALE:" What are you doing up? Well, I could say I was hungry, but, uh, I'm not.
LEADMALE:Worried about Marilyn.
LEADFEMALE:And you.
LEADMALE:She's doing this to hurt me.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't take a major mind to figure that out.
SUPMALE:She had a nice life going, and to her way of thinking, I'm the one who screwed it all up for her, so she doesn't want me to forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I get the message.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how about you? How are you holding up? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:As lousy as this is, okay.
LEADFEMALE:I did the right thing, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Maureen and I just ground to a halt.
LEADMALE:We lost it.
LEADFEMALE:That thing we had that was so wonderful, it just went good-bye.
LEADMALE:You know, it's funny I-I just flashed to the night that Steven brought me to meet you.
LEADMALE:His married brother and his wife in this this apartment on-on Bank Street over the bakery.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that was a great bakery.
SUPFEMALE:Gianfranco's.
SUPMALE:The two of you were were unbelievably cute.
OTHERFEMALE:You're playing house, but for real.
LEADMALE:You know, it was so appealing.
OTHERFEMALE:So grown-up.
SUPMALE:Something that I wanted so much.
SUPFEMALE:Some of the greatest cannolis I ever ate came out of that bakery.
LEADFEMALE:I remember how great Maureen looked that night.
SUPFEMALE:Her hair was all the way down past her waist then, and I remember all through dinner, I I was watching her, and she was just looking at you.
LEADFEMALE:Just laughing, you know, just just wild about you.
LEADMALE:I used to get three of those cannolis and go up on the roof.
LEADMALE:I'd have a quart of milk and the cannolis.
LEADMALE:And I'd sing "That's Amore.
OTHERMALE:" And I'd lie there, looking up at the sky in some kind of Italian pastry coma.
LEADMALE:That was quite a night.
LEADFEMALE:Maureen made lamb stew.
SUPMALE:We had some wine.
LEADMALE:We had some more wine.
SUPMALE:I remember we got to talking about whether Steven and I should quit school and go to Newfoundland.
LEADMALE:And run a lighthouse.
LEADMALE:You said, "He can't fix a lamp.
SUPFEMALE:" "How is he going to run a lighthouse?" So Steven asked Maureen, "What do you think?" And and she said, "You know, if if you really love each other, you can be happy anywhere.
SUPMALE:" Like Rob and me.
LEADMALE:I remember after you left, I said to Maureen, "You know, that Elyse, she isn't bad-looking.
SUPFEMALE:" Maureen said, "No, she isn't.
LEADMALE:Uh, she's bright and charming, and Steven should be very proud.
SUPMALE:" I said, "Yeah, boy, did that doofus get lucky.
LEADFEMALE:" Where the hell is Marilyn? Should I be getting crazy here, Elyse? Because I am I'm getting crazy.
SUPFEMALE:It's ten of 2:00.
LEADMALE:Well, just-just wait it out, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Just wait a little while longer, and then maybe she'll You're not just saying that, are you, Uncle Rob? Saying what, Alex? About being a Republican.
LEADFEMALE:No, Alex, I am a Republican.
OTHERFEMALE:You're certain? I'm certain.
LEADMALE:Well, then, good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:'Cause if you're not I am, Alex.
LEADMALE:I-I have an elephant on my key ring.
LEADMALE:Well, then, good night.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? That's okay, honey.
LEADFEMALE:We're still up.
OTHERFEMALE:He's right here.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you? All right, I'll come get you.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's out of the question.
LEADMALE:Just give me the address.
SUPMALE:Tell me where you are, Marilyn.
SUPMALE:Marilyn, you don't even know him.
SUPMALE:Don't you dare hang up on me.
LEADMALE:She's going to spend the night at his place.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE: Now, let's not forget that Rob and the kids have really gone through a tough time lately.
LEADMALE:Let's try and remember to be sensitive to that.
OTHERMALE:I didn't want to come here.
LEADFEMALE:The flight was miserable, and I'm counting the hours till we go home.
SUPFEMALE:Did you meet the guy she went out with tonight? Um, well, I don't know his name, Uncle Rob.
LEADMALE:But don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:She's in good hands.
OTHERFEMALE:He's a Marine.
SUPFEMALE:You got to let her know where the line is, the line she can't cross.
LEADMALE:She's going to spend the night at his place.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God, Jen.
SUPMALE:I'm glad it's you.
LEADMALE:I thought it was Alex.
SUPMALE:I know the feeling.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? Jen, you're not going to believe this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so upset.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? Did you dent the car again? Yeah, I did, but that's not what I'm upset about.
SUPMALE:Jennifer Marilyn did not come home last night.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Really? - Really.
LEADFEMALE:She didn't come home.
OTHERMALE:Her bed wasn't slept in.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what to do about it.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Rob is going to be so You were saying? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Don't look at me.
LEADMALE:I was with you.
SUPMALE:All right, look, this has got to stop.
LEADMALE:I mean, every time I walk into a room and you two are talking, you stop talking, you pretend you haven't been talking.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, don't shut me out! Come on.
LEADFEMALE:This is your brother, okay? This is Alex Keaton, the first name in trust.
SUPMALE:I-I want to be part of your little group, okay? Please let me.
LEADMALE:I-I want to share fully and joyfully in your rich, low-level gossip.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:You were saying something about Uncle Rob.
SUPMALE:What was it? Huh? Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:Tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me.
SUPMALE:I beseech you.
SUPFEMALE:Okay? I won't breathe a word of it to anybody.
LEADFEMALE:Marilyn didn't come home last night.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm telling.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you dare! We got to call the police.
LEADFEMALE:We got to call the police! - She could be anywhere.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:I think I know where she is, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's with the Marine.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't have to call the police.
LEADMALE:She's with the Marines.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, if you ever want me to tell you anything else for the rest of my life, you're going to have to swear not to breathe a word of this.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right, okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right, you have my word.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that puts my mind at ease.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Marilyn didn't come home last night.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't say a word.
LEADFEMALE:She called late last night and said she was, uh, spending the night at her date's house.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Andy.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go see what the Three Bears are up to.
LEADMALE:No, this is better.
LEADMALE:No, it's not.
SUPMALE:I can't believe that Marilyn.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, she she has absolutely no regard for Uncle Rob's feelings.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I don't think you know the whole story.
LEADFEMALE:What's to know? If you're 18 years old, you should be sleeping at home with your parents.
LEADMALE:I mean, the only time you should be in someone else's bed is when you're checked into a hotel.
LEADFEMALE:Or at a registered campsite.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, uh, Uncle Rob, uh, can I get you some coffee? Oh, no, thanks, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:You, uh you sleep okay, Rob? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I dropped off from 3:00 to 3:15.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you don't want any more than that, you know.
LEADMALE:I get more than 20 minutes sleep, I get groggy.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, at least sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Let me make you some breakfast.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, thanks, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I'm-I'm going to go take a run, just kind of clear my head, you know? I'll, uh I'll be back in about 15 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Call me crazy, but I'm going to side with Uncle Rob in this thing.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I had a long talk with Marilyn last night, and let me just say there's a lot more going on here than you might think.
SUPMALE:Mallory, if there's any information you think we should have, you should tell us.
LEADMALE:Not in front of Alex.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, this is a very complex situation.
LEADFEMALE:I-I talked for a long time with Rob last night.
LEADFEMALE:I was surprised at what's all going on.
LEADMALE:Elyse, if you have something we should know, now is the time to tell us.
LEADMALE:Not in front of Alex.
SUPMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm just going to leave home, all right? I am leaving home.
LEADMALE:This is me leaving home.
LEADFEMALE:It was a threat, okay? You're supposed to stop me! Please, tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I-I don't think it's any secret that Marilyn blames Rob for the divorce, and this is just her way of getting back at him.
LEADMALE:I didn't know that.
SUPMALE:They've almost completely stopped communicating.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Marilyn obviously does everything she can to avoid spending time together with him.
SUPMALE:And when they are together, they barely speak.
LEADFEMALE:I had no idea.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, Rob isn't sure how to handle her.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't know what to do.
LEADMALE:He's afraid of losing her altogether, so he's, uh, tentative and passive and unsure.
SUPMALE:Who else knows about this? I feel bad for Rob.
SUPFEMALE:He's in a lot of pain.
LEADFEMALE:I feel bad for me.
LEADMALE:Nobody tells me anything.
SUPMALE:Look, Rob and the kids are our guests.
OTHERMALE:They're going to be staying here for the weekend, and I I don't think we should bring this up in front of them unless they mention it first.
LEADMALE:I think we should just pretend that nothing is happening.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you, Marilyn.
LEADMALE:Uh, can I get you some breakfast? Oh, no, thanks, Aunt Elyse.
SUPMALE:I don't want to put you to any trouble.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, oh, it's no trouble.
OTHERMALE:I'll-I'll just take a couple seconds, and I'll scramble you up a couple Marines.
LEADFEMALE:What what she means are, uh Little marine animals.
LEADFEMALE:Shrimp omelet, perhaps? - Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Well, do you want to be alone or or do you want to talk? Let's talk.
SUPFEMALE:I almost died when I woke up and I saw you weren't here this morning.
OTHERMALE:I wish it would have been you that answered the phone when I called last night.
SUPMALE:Well, my parents won't let me have a phone in here.
LEADFEMALE:They're afraid, if I had one, I'd never leave my room.
SUPFEMALE:And they're right, actually.
LEADMALE:You don't realize how lucky you are, Mal, how much you have here.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have a phone.
SUPMALE:You have everyone here under one roof.
SUPFEMALE:Your mom, your dad, Jen, Andy, Alex.
LEADMALE:Uh All right, so it's not perfect.
OTHERMALE:You know, your dad was real worried last night.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Who is it? It's Alex! I'd like to talk to you! I don't want to talk to you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's impossible! You-you have no idea what I want to say to you.
LEADMALE:Alex, she doesn't want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:She wants to be alone.
SUPMALE:How come she let you in? It's my room.
SUPFEMALE:That's no reason.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:And not to me? This is a new personal all-time low.
LEADMALE:We said we don't want to talk to you! Go away! Mallory, it's me.
LEADMALE:Come in, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hold that door! Close it, Mom! How could you do that, Mom? Shut the door in your own son's face? Oh, honey, come on.
LEADMALE:It's not the first time.
LEADMALE:I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:We were just, uh, sort of Mom, why don't I have a phone in here? We were, uh we were talking about me and my dad.
SUPFEMALE:I-I guess you've noticed a little tension between us since we got here.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I know you've been hurting, and I've been trying not to intrude.
LEADMALE:But I-I'm the oldest female here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I don't want to brag about that.
LEADFEMALE:But if you need someone to talk to, I am here for you.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Aunt Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:But there's really not much to talk about.
LEADMALE:Well, there is one thing to talk about.
LEADMALE:And if your mother were here, she-she would say exactly the same thing.
LEADMALE:What you did last night was frightening.
LEADFEMALE:You know, spending the night with a stranger, it's-it's never a smart thing to do, but these days, honey, it it's crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Honey Who is it? It's me Dad.
SUPMALE:Right, Alex.
SUPMALE:It's a really bad imitation of Dad.
LEADMALE:I thought it was pretty good.
SUPMALE:Nice.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I'm really starting to think you don't want me in there.
LEADMALE:Well, what's up, Dad? Nothing.
SUPMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:Just a real woman shortage downstairs.
LEADMALE:All right, I can't take this anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Every adult in this house is in this room.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh So This is what it's like in here.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:I-I just got here! Well, I guess I've gotten everything I can out of this.
LEADFEMALE:What happened last night is never going to happen again.
SUPFEMALE:You understand? It was dangerous, it was inconsiderate, and it was insulting.
LEADMALE:Not only to me, but to my brother and his entire family.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you finished? Now, you listen to me, Marilyn.
LEADFEMALE:I have had it.
LEADMALE:I am through! You wanted to hurt me? Well, congratulations.
LEADMALE:You've done a terrific job.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me tell you something.
SUPMALE:No matter what you're thinking, no matter what you you think has happened between us, I am still your father.
LEADMALE:A father doesn't walk out on his family.
SUPFEMALE:A father doesn't run around with women half his age.
OTHERMALE:A father doesn't embarrass You don't know what a father does, and you don't know what pain I was going through.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what about the pain I'm going through right now? What about Mom? What about the pain she's going through? I couldn't help that, Marilyn.
SUPFEMALE:I had to get out.
LEADMALE:I only stayed as long as I did because of you and Jonathan.
SUPMALE:I don't want to listen to this.
OTHERMALE:I'm getting out of here.
LEADMALE:What do you think you're doing? Can I have my plane ticket? I'm going home to Mom.
LEADMALE:Your mother's not there.
LEADFEMALE:She went away for the weekend.
LEADMALE:I guess I'll be there by myself, then.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, you're not going to be alone.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then I will call Hank; I will spend the night with him.
LEADMALE:What the hell do you think you are doing? Now, you listen to me, young lady.
SUPFEMALE:You're only 18 years old.
LEADFEMALE:You're not spending another night at some guy's house.
LEADFEMALE:You're acting like a little tramp.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm my father's daughter.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADMALE:Elyse, that was delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I've never had sprouts served quite that way before.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Mom wrote the book on that.
LEADFEMALE:A Mi//ion Strange Ways to Serve Sprouts.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADMALE:Think I should bring something up to Marilyn? No, if she wants to eat, she can come down like anybody else.
LEADMALE:Well, if anything will lure her out, it will be those sprouts.
SUPMALE:Very tasty indeed, Mom, although my hopes for a national sprouts crop failure are still high.
LEADMALE:Game's all set up, Jonathan.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Andy, I'm ready.
LEADMALE:What are you guys playing? Chess.
SUPFEMALE:Andy, you don't know how to play chess.
LEADMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:I beat him last game.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:You know something that we haven't done in a long time? Oh, no, Mom, please don't say it.
LEADMALE:Please, Mom, no.
OTHERFEMALE:How about a good, long walk? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, not the good, long walk.
LEADFEMALE:I've outgrown the good, long walk.
LEADMALE:Rob and I will stay and do the dishes.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'll do the dishes.
SUPMALE:I love dishes.
LEADFEMALE:Let me uh, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Dish.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, come on, come on.
LEADFEMALE:It'll do you all some good.
LEADMALE:That's what all mothers always say just before they make you do something you really hate.
LEADMALE:Well, this is my kind of night.
LEADMALE:A bowl of sprouts and a forced march.
LEADMALE:Let's do the dishes.
LEADMALE:Let's have a beer.
LEADFEMALE:Better idea.
LEADMALE:Remember the first time we had a beer together? Sure.
LEADMALE:In the basement of the house on Carroll Street.
SUPMALE:We were so cool.
LEADMALE:Dad didn't suspect a thing.
OTHERMALE:Well, there was no reason for him to suspect anything.
LEADMALE:I was six.
LEADMALE:You were three.
LEADMALE:How much did we drink anyway? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:How big were those Mickey Mouse cups? I'm so embarrassed about this, Steven.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about, Rob? We were just kids.
LEADFEMALE:Not about that.
OTHERMALE:About this whole thing.
LEADFEMALE:About the divorce, Marilyn.
LEADFEMALE:Rob, stop.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is the only time I've been glad Dad isn't alive, that he didn't live to see this.
SUPFEMALE:He, uh he wouldn't have understood, you know.
SUPMALE:I'm not so sure.
LEADFEMALE:You think he would have understood a guy my age leaving his family because he needed to be happy? A guy like Dad? He never had less than four jobs at once.
SUPFEMALE:The man didn't have a chance to sit down for 15 minutes, let alone figure out if he was happy.
OTHERMALE:That was a different generation.
LEADFEMALE:They didn't know about divorce.
LEADMALE:They were too busy arguing with each other to get divorced.
LEADMALE:You remember the lady who lived on 17th Street on the corner? The one who did get divorced? Mm-hmm, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Bloom.
LEADFEMALE:Remember all the fuss, all the whispering? Her full name became "Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Bloom She's Divorced.
SUPFEMALE:" We'd see her and point, "There goes Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Bloom She's Divorced.
SUPFEMALE:" Even Mr.
LEADMALE:Bloom called her that.
SUPFEMALE:Did I ever dream in my wildest nightmare that it would happen to me? That I'd become "Robert Keaton He's Divorced"? You were very unhappy in your marriage, Rob.
LEADMALE:So was Maureen.
LEADMALE:That was no way for you to live, for your kids to live.
LEADFEMALE:I-I think you're much better off this way, Rob.
LEADMALE:I honestly do.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, times like this, I wonder, Stevie.
LEADMALE:At least before, I knew what I was.
LEADMALE:I was a father.
SUPFEMALE:I was a husband.
LEADMALE:All right, I was an unhappy husband, but I was a husband.
LEADMALE:See, people could relate to that.
LEADFEMALE:They'd come up, ask me what I was.
LEADMALE:I'd say, "I'm an unhappy husband.
LEADMALE:" They'd say, "You, too?" You know, I made a lot of friends like that.
SUPMALE:Well, at least it looked like a family.
LEADMALE:But that was just a picture, Rob.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't real.
LEADFEMALE:It had nowhere to go.
LEADMALE:What do I do with Marilyn? She loved that picture, whether it was real or not.
SUPMALE:Now she doesn't even want to talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks I'm the lowest form of life on the planet.
SUPFEMALE:For God's sake, Rob, it's not right to let her brand you like that forever.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to keep going.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got a whole new life to build for yourself.
LEADMALE:So does Marilyn.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, maybe, uh Maybe that's something you're both going to have to do separately.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you have to let her go.
LEADMALE:That's easy for you to say, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:She's not your daughter.
LEADMALE:No, but you're my brother, and it's killing you.
OTHERMALE:Can I talk to you? I'm going to talk anyway.
LEADFEMALE:If that's a mistake, then it's one of a group of mistakes I've made since, uh, your mother and I decided to get divorced.
LEADFEMALE:That was not a mistake, by the way.
SUPMALE:It's a terrible thing to have happen to a family, but it wasn't a mistake.
LEADFEMALE:What was a mistake was having an affair.
SUPMALE:I did; you know I did.
LEADFEMALE:It was after your mother and I knew that we couldn't be together anymore, but we were still living together.
LEADFEMALE:We weren't divorced, and I had an affair.
LEADFEMALE:It didn't seem wrong at the time, but it was.
OTHERFEMALE:It was wrong, and I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't think I should have to pay for it for the rest of my life.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to do? I mean, wh-what do you want from me? Go back to Mom.
OTHERMALE:I can't do that.
SUPMALE:You loved her.
SUPMALE:You still love her.
LEADFEMALE:That's over, honey.
LEADMALE:It can't be over.
SUPFEMALE:It's just too mean.
LEADFEMALE:It's too impossible.
LEADMALE:I know, it seems that way.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:What could I do? You could have thought about somebody besides yourself.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm thinking about somebody beside myself right now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm thinking about you, 'cause we have to go on from here.
LEADFEMALE:Not the way we were.
LEADFEMALE:We can't ever be that way again.
OTHERFEMALE:We can never be that family again.
LEADFEMALE:We have some decisions to make here.
LEADFEMALE:We have to decide how we are going to be in each other's life.
SUPFEMALE:What-what do you want me to do? Do do you want me to just just go back at playing father and daughter? After all that's happened, do you want me to keep on pretending? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm through pretending.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can never be father and daughter again like that.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can never be that way again.
LEADMALE:But we have to find out what we're going to be to each other.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to be something to you.
LEADFEMALE:Just don't hang me out to dry, Marilyn.
LEADMALE:Please just let me in.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want it to be like this.
LEADMALE:It doesn't have to be like this, honey, because I just want to help you.
LEADFEMALE:Just let me be your father.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to be your father, Marilyn.
LEADFEMALE:Just let me be your father.
LEADFEMALE:I love you so much.
LEADMALE:I love you, too, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Dad and Uncle Rob are brothers.
LEADMALE:You know, just like you and me.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:And Uncle Rob is-is having a hard time right now, you know, what with the divorce and everything.
LEADFEMALE:But-but-but Dad is hurting, too, you know, 'cause they're brothers.
LEADFEMALE:Get to the point.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Well, see, Andy, I've been thinking.
SUPMALE:Who you marry is very important to me.
OTHERFEMALE:To me, too.
OTHERMALE:To you, too.
SUPFEMALE:To you, too.
OTHERFEMALE:But-but it's very important to me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I mean, what happens if you marry somebody I don't like? That wouldn't be good.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, it wouldn't.
LEADFEMALE:So I've figured out a way to make sure that doesn't happen, okay? Andy, I'm going to have to pick your wife.
LEADMALE:Okay, but do a good job.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Andy, you and I I hope we're not interrupting anything.
SUPMALE:Some low-level gossip, perhaps? We have no secrets.
SUPFEMALE:We were talking about Nothing, nothing.
SUPMALE:Yeah, nothing at all.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, honey.
LEADMALE:It's time for bed.
SUPMALE:Yep.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I want to stay up and say good night to Uncle Rob and the cousins.
SUPMALE:I think they're busy, honey.
LEADMALE:Uh, you can say good night in the morning.
LEADMALE:Yeah, come on.
SUPMALE:Alex is going to pick out my wife.
LEADFEMALE:Well, one less thing for you to worry about as you grow up.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Who knows where we can get a good pizza this time of night, huh? Well, if you're really hungry, th-there's more sprouts Wellington in the fridge.
LEADMALE:Uh, no, thanks, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, we just want to spend some time alone together.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of a father-daughter night out.
LEADMALE:We've got a lot to talk about.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, want me to come along? See, you know, kind of a father-daughter, um uh, cousin night out.
LEADFEMALE:No, thanks, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Eh.
LEADMALE:Well, looking good.
LEADFEMALE:It's a start.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever, it's just good to see you guys talking again.
SUPMALE:Hey, look.
LEADFEMALE:We've got to find these people some pizza.
OTHERMALE:Look, there's only one place to go.
LEADFEMALE:Alberto's on Euclid Avenue.
SUPMALE:Dad.
SUPMALE:Alberto's? They're the worst.
LEADFEMALE:Go to Dominick's.
SUPMALE:What, Dominick's House of Inedible Pizza? No, go to Caruso's.
SUPFEMALE:Caruso's? They-they got pizza like cardboard.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, the best place to go Hey, I happen to love cardboard, okay? The best place to go for pizza is Guido's.
LEADMALE:Guido's.
SUPFEMALE:Guido's? This coming from the woman who served us algae for dinner tonight.
OTHERMALE:Okay, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.
LEADMALE:I know just the place the best pizza in town.
SUPFEMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:As you all know, Lauren is doing a paper on the American family.
LEADFEMALE:And as you also may know, she's chosen us to be her case study.
LEADFEMALE:So, I want you all to answer the questions to the best of your ability, all right? Um, Mom and Dad, uh, feel free to refer to any old photo albums.
LEADMALE:Mallory may need the aid of a thesaurus.
LEADFEMALE:Or, if Nick comes by, he may wish to express himself through cave paintings.
OTHERMALE:Any questions? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Who said you can do all the talking? All right, all right.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
OTHERMALE:All right, go ahead, honey.
LEADMALE:Okay, are there any questions before I get started with my questions? Ooh! Ooh! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Uh, Miss Miller, uh, you've picked us - as the typical American family.
SUPMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, does this mean you-you you find me to be typical? Because, uh because I've always kind of prided myself on not being typical.
LEADMALE:You know, not normal.
LEADFEMALE:You've succeeded at that.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Mr.
SUPMALE:And Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton, I'll start with you, because, after all, if it wasn't for the two of you, this family wouldn't even be here.
SUPFEMALE:What does she mean by that? Because they're the mommy and daddy.
LEADFEMALE:How did they get to be the mommy and daddy? They won a raffle.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, when you first met, uh, did it ever occur to you that your life would turn out this way? I mean, was having a family always the main goal? Well, uh, when I met Elyse, it was truly magical.
LEADFEMALE:The first time I laid eyes on her, I knew we'd be together forever.
OTHERMALE:I swear, at that moment, time and space did not exist.
LEADFEMALE:Just us.
LEADMALE:Is it any wonder I find him so attractive?  How come you didn't inherit any of your father's romantic side? Hey, come Me? You're kidding.
LEADMALE:I'm-I'm-I'm on the FBI's ten most romantic list.
SUPMALE:Violins play wherever I go.
LEADMALE:Try leaving the room.
LEADMALE:See if the music starts up.
LEADMALE:Okay, so then, after the two of you met and you fell in love, did, uh, things go as you hoped they would? Would you say that your life is the fulfillment of a dream that the two of you set out for yourselves? But there were a lot of surprises along the way.
LEADMALE:Can you give me an example? Well, when I found out that I was pregnant with Andy, that was a surprise.
LEADFEMALE:A delightful surprise.
LEADMALE:Hey, you okay? Hmm? Oh, sure.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:I just couldn't sleep, I was so excited.
LEADMALE:How are you two feeling? Fine.
LEADMALE: Fine.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? I had a little trouble sleeping.
SUPFEMALE:I, uh I can't stop thinking.
SUPFEMALE:About what? I mean, about what specifically? Elyse, I'm 40 years old.
SUPMALE:I'm, uh, about to become a father again.
SUPFEMALE:Last time I changed a diaper, Richard Nixon was president.
LEADMALE:I thought I'd seen the last of both of them.
LEADMALE:You know what I keep realizing? - What? We're going to have to start watching Sesame Street again, Romper Room, Mr.
LEADMALE:Rogers.
SUPMALE:I like Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Rogers.
SUPFEMALE:Have to start going to the zoo.
SUPFEMALE:Pony rides, birthday parties.
SUPMALE:Sterilizing baby bottles.
LEADFEMALE:Tripping over toys.
SUPFEMALE:Before you know it, the terrible twos will be upon us.
LEADFEMALE:Remember when Alex used to run around the house all the time going, "Mine! Mine!"? He never really outgrew that, did he? Seems like such a long time ago.
LEADMALE:You know, I've been doing some calculations.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? When the baby's ten, I'll be 50.
LEADMALE:When the baby's 20, I'll be 60.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
SUPMALE:When the baby's 30, I'll be 70.
SUPFEMALE:to have a baby, isn't it? It won't be a baby when it's 30.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess you're right.
OTHERMALE:When the baby's 40, Jennifer will be 51.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, cut it out! I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm just not used to the idea.
OTHERMALE:Neither am I.
OTHERMALE:It's a nice idea to get used to, isn't it? I wish the kids were more excited.
SUPMALE:Oh, they'll come around.
LEADMALE:Who could not love a beautiful newborn baby? Besides, it gives us someone else to pick on.
LEADFEMALE:You know, uh, there's one other thing about this we haven't mentioned.
LEADMALE:It's going to be real expensive, huh? I find this absolutely the sexiest thing in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Cut it out.
LEADMALE:Don't you know that's how you got into trouble in the first place? Alex, what are you doing up? How am I supposed to sleep, Mom? I'm about to become a brother for the third time.
SUPFEMALE:It's not going to happen tonight, Alex.
OTHERMALE:It's not, is it, Elyse? I can almost guarantee it.
LEADMALE:What's in the package? Oh, uh, it's, uh, something I picked up for the little guy.
SUPMALE: Oh, it's so cute! Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, pull the string.
LEADFEMALE: I love Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Isn't that sweet? I love it! Yeah.
SUPMALE:You know, I think I need to get one of these for myself.
OTHERMALE:This little toy reminds me of when you were a baby.
LEADMALE:Alex, do you remember that song we used to sing to you when you were little? It was your favorite one, and it always made you smile.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Uh We're in the money.
OTHERFEMALE: No.
OTHERMALE:Don't you remember? It was, um I'm a little teapot, short and stout Mom, get a hold of yourself.
LEADMALE:Here is the handle, here is the spout When I get all steamed up, hear me shout Tip me over and pour me out.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to be a long nine months.
OTHERFEMALE:We thought about having a little brother or sister.
LEADMALE:We decided that it could be a lot of fun.
SUPMALE:Yeah, the family needs a little shaking up anyway.
LEADFEMALE: Thank you, honey.
LEADMALE:This is beautiful.
OTHERMALE:Look at it! Well, it's getting pretty late.
SUPMALE:I think we'd better call it a night, huh? - Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE: It did seem like a long nine months, but when Andy was born, it was an incredible thrill for us all.
LEADFEMALE:Especially Alex, it seemed.
LEADMALE:Oh, you know, Steven, he has your eyes.
SUPMALE: Maybe those are my eyes, but that is your nose.
LEADMALE:I'd know it anywhere.
LEADMALE: You're great, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you, love.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so are you.
SUPMALE: Can we come in? We heard a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we thought it might be yours.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
SUPMALE:Oh, wow.
OTHERMALE:It's a boy.
LEADMALE:Thank you! Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Ah! Ah, yes, that was a magical moment.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it was fun for me, too.
OTHERMALE:What was it like to all of a sudden have a brand-new baby in the house? How were your daily patterns affected? Well, all of a sudden, there were diapers to change, formula to make.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and rattles, first words and the constant squeak from that Jolly Jumper till I thought it was going to break off its hinges.
LEADFEMALE:Babies have tons of energy.
LEADFEMALE:No, that was Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I was I was just checking out the shocks on the thing, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Making sure it was safe.
LEADFEMALE:What was the thing that changed most for the rest of the family? Was-was there anything that you felt missing in your life? 
LEADFEMALE:Sleep.
LEADMALE: What are you doing? I'm going in to get Andrew.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, that will be the fifth time you've picked him up since midnight.
OTHERMALE:Elyse, he's crying.
SUPMALE:Honey, we've been through this before.
LEADMALE:If you pick Andrew up every time he cries, he's never going to stop crying.
SUPMALE:Does that mean, when he's 30, he'll still cry in his crib? Not if we bring him up right.
LEADMALE: Elyse, how can you be so cruel? He's only been alone for four minutes.
LEADMALE:Four minutes is a big chunk of his life, Elyse.
LEADMALE:We are not going to spoil this baby, Steven.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go back to bed.
LEADMALE: Boy, has this kid got lungs.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my heaven.
LEADFEMALE: - Elyse.
SUPMALE: Where are you going? I was going to straighten this picture.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse! -  Oh, he's still crying, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you didn't want to spoil him.
LEADFEMALE:I don't, but I can't bear to hear him cry.
SUPFEMALE: He stopped crying.
LEADMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:  - Is Andrew up again? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We can't get him to go to sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, maybe we should sing to him.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, we want him to sleep, not try and escape.
LEADFEMALE:We should try singing.
OTHERFEMALE:We should try anything.
LEADMALE:I've got to get some sleep.
LEADFEMALE: We'll sing, we'll sing.
OTHERMALE:Well, wait.
LEADMALE:What are we going to sing? Something for a baby.
LEADMALE:Hey, do you know "Let's Get Crazy" by Prince? It was our wedding song.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, come on.
LEADMALE:I'm not singing anything by Prince.
SUPFEMALE:Come on! He's tired! 
LEADMALE:Down by the old mill stream Where I first met you You were 16 
LEADMALE:You were 16 My village queen, my village queen Down by the old mill stream.
LEADFEMALE: Good night.
LEADMALE:  Look, we can work this out.
SUPMALE:We can work it out.
OTHERFEMALE:I know we can.
LEADMALE:Now, what has stopped him from crying so far? When we went in there to sing, he stopped crying.
SUPMALE:Go in there to sing stop crying.
OTHERMALE:When I brought him out here before, he stopped crying.
LEADFEMALE:Bring him out here stop cry okay.
LEADMALE:I've got it.

LEADFEMALE:Down by the old - Mill stream -  Nice try, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, the song stylings of the Keaton family.
SUPFEMALE:That that was quite a night.
LEADFEMALE:It's getting late, Andy.
SUPMALE:I think it's time for bed.
LEADFEMALE:But, Dad, I'm the center of attention.
SUPMALE:Well, why don't you go on up, and I'll be the center of attention.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Andy, I'll take you up.
SUPMALE:Good night, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, honey is it time for my personal history yet? No, not just yet.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, well, you give me lots of warning, okay? Because I got to set up that whole slide show and We're onto an interesting area here.
LEADFEMALE:The-the most recent addition to this typical American family.
LEADMALE:Okay, as Andy grew, would you say the style in which you raised him was any different from the rest of the children? Well, actually, it was very much the same.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but-but as time went on, we started getting little hints that-that Alex intended to be more involved in Andy's upbringing than we had hoped.
LEADFEMALE:This started very early on.
LEADMALE:Okay, Andy, you ready?  Okay.
SUPMALE:This is him.
LEADFEMALE:This is the guy I've been telling you about.
OTHERMALE:This is everything you'd want in a president.
SUPMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:Put this away you'll frighten him.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, there you go again, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Republican.
LEADMALE: And then there were other hints.
SUPMALE:Things that were tough to ignore.
OTHERMALE:Who's that? - You.
LEADFEMALE:Who am I? - My mommy.
LEADMALE:That's right.
OTHERMALE:And who's that pretty girl? - Jennifer.
SUPMALE:Who's Jennifer? - My sister.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Who's that? - Alex.
SUPMALE:Who is Alex? Alex is king.
LEADMALE: And after a while, we had to face the fact that we had another Alex on our hands.
LEADMALE:Mommy, come quick gold closed at $4.
LEADMALE:15.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for having him.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, got to love that kid.
LEADMALE:I got to admit their relationship is cute in its own weird way.
SUPMALE:What's wrong with a little brother following in his older brother's footsteps? What's wrong with our footsteps? Well, hey, Dad, you know, he would've followed in your footsteps I just got to him first.
SUPFEMALE:Why couldn't he follow in my footsteps? Oh, great, he'd be on a on a circular track to and from the mall.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong with that? His first words would be, "Attention, shoppers.
OTHERFEMALE:" Alex has, on occasion, uh, taken this "follow in his footsteps" business a little too far.
SUPMALE:Moi? Oui.
LEADFEMALE:I seem to remember Andy's first day of preschool.
LEADMALE:You went a little overboard there.
LEADFEMALE:Moi? MALLORY, ELYSE and 
OTHERFEMALE:Oui.
OTHERFEMALE:Andy, here's your lunch box.
LEADFEMALE:Now, these are your coloring books and your crayons.
LEADMALE:Remember, how do we feel about sharing?  Attaboy.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, now, you just wear this, and I don't think we'll have any problem.
LEADMALE:Good morning, Andy.
SUPMALE:Good morning, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Kluger.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Kluger.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Alex Keaton, Andy's brother.
LEADMALE:I'm Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kluger, the director.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Oh, listen, Andy, I got to run to class now, but remember, tonight, we're going to go out, we're going to get ice cream, then I'm going to take you and show you how the automated teller machines work.
LEADMALE:Okay? Remember who loves you? Alex loves me.
LEADFEMALE:You know it.
SUPFEMALE:So, uh how's he doing? Oh, he's a terrific child.
LEADFEMALE:He's very sensitive and very thoughtful of the other children.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I can't help that; it's my parents' influence.
SUPMALE:You know, Andrew talks about you all the time, Alex.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? Yeah, he mentions your name so often, you'd think someone was paying him to talk about you.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kluger, do you mind if I take a little look around here? Oh, no, feel free we encourage visitors.
LEADMALE:We're completely open and free here.
LEADFEMALE:That's nothing to brag about.
SUPFEMALE:So, this is the library? Yeah, and we try to fill it with colorful, interesting books.
SUPMALE:We've got, uh, Old Charlie Goes to School, A Snowy Day, The Curious Cow.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, we've got that one at home.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory's reading it.
LEADMALE:My sister.
LEADMALE:Oh, you've also got a sister in preschool.
SUPFEMALE:No, Mallory couldn't get into preschool.
OTHERMALE:So she's going to Grant College.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kluger.
LEADMALE:Hi, Michael.
SUPFEMALE:What does your patch say? I know how to say good-bye to my daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Very good, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that wonderful, Alex? What's so wonderful about that? I know how to say good-bye to my daddy.
LEADMALE:You don't see me wearing a patch.
SUPMALE:Well, we try to encourage Michael he's very shy.
LEADFEMALE:This gives him a sense of accomplishment.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm all for creating a sense of accomplishment, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Kluger.
SUPFEMALE:I just question your methods.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, what do you suggest? Well, have you thought about dividing the children into different play groups? Giving them IQ tests? Well, Alex, we're trying to foster a noncompetitive environment.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Kluger.
OTHERFEMALE:Join us in the real world here.
LEADFEMALE:Do you see people out there who are noncompetitive? People sharing? People taking naps on mats? Steven and Elyse Keaton are your parents? Oh, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Kluger, I got to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, I'm just going to say good-bye to Andy, - and I'll be on my way.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:He's over there playing house.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:That's impossible Andy doesn't play house.
SUPMALE:Well, of course he does.
LEADMALE:See him diapering that doll? He's diapering a doll? Andy, what are you doing? Diapering a doll.
SUPFEMALE:Where's your wife? Out working.
LEADFEMALE:We're out of here.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:You took Andy out of preschool? I brought him back.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, after the deprogramming didn't work.
SUPFEMALE:So, Alex seems to be a little overzealous when it comes to Andy.
LEADMALE:Well well, yes, I am, sugarplum.
SUPFEMALE:Could you explain further this obsessive involvement? Well, frankly, it has to do with the way I was raised.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? One thing you have to know about Mom and Dad is that they're not your normal parents.
LEADFEMALE:He says the sweetest things.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what I mean is they really got involved in everything we did.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes a little over-involved.
SUPFEMALE:Can anyone cite an example? - More popcorn? - Uh There was this time that Dad felt he wasn't spending enough time with me, so he decided to become my buddy.
LEADMALE: Oh, right.
SUPMALE:Everybody down, low bridge For we're coming to a town And you'll always know your neighbor You'll always know your pal if you've ever navigated On the Erie Canal.
SUPFEMALE: All right!  Well, what do you say, Dad? Do you want to go now? We've been here three minutes, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:All right, that was very nice singing, girls.

SUPFEMALE:I'm your guy.
SUPMALE:Did you say "sex"? Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, maybe you should go, really.
LEADMALE:Nonsense, Jennifer.
SUPMALE:I'm a Sunflower Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I think I can handle a a mature discussion about, uh, what she said.
OTHERFEMALE: Now, we're going to discuss our bodies as they blossom into womanhood.
LEADMALE:And about boys and their bodies as they burst into manhood.
OTHERFEMALE:I know that some of you have already gone out on dates with boys, and I want to talk about first experiences.
SUPFEMALE:And I want the younger girls to benefit from you older girls.
LEADFEMALE:So we're going to go around the room starting with you, Shelly.
LEADMALE:Well, on my first date, I went out with a guy in my class.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not going to name names, but Was it Larry Barker? That's right.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I went out with Larry, and all he wanted to do was fool around.
LEADMALE:What do you mean by "fool around"? I mean he wanted to touch my body as it blossomed into womanhood.
LEADFEMALE:Boys are only interested in one 
LEADMALE:Sex.

SUPMALE:Was sex one of them? Well, I was interested in, uh, baseball, basketball, football.
SUPMALE:You're not answering the question.
LEADMALE:Get off my back, will you? I don't want to lie to you, uh, Alice.
LEADMALE:Uh  I admit, there there were some, uh, girls, uh, that, uh I remember Marjorie McCracken.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, she had a body on her.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, I can't believe you're talking about this stuff.
LEADMALE:What can I do? She was hounding me.
OTHERMALE:Dad, you're really embarrassing me.
LEADFEMALE:This is not the place for you to be.
SUPMALE:Why do you say that? Look around you, Dad.
LEADMALE:Do you see anyone else here who shaves? Jennifer, I just want to spend some time with you.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Dad, but this isn't the right place.
LEADMALE:If you don't leave, I will.
OTHERMALE:I have to say I learned a lot from that meeting.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:Like don't ever be seen with your father in public.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's a lovely thing your father did.
LEADFEMALE:It shows what kind of dad he is.
LEADMALE:He's not a stay-at-home dad.
SUPMALE:Dad, in the future, do us a favor stay at home.
LEADFEMALE:Can you think of other ways that your father embarrassed I-I mean got involved in what you kids were doing? Nothing specific, but he was always involved.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, too.
SUPFEMALE:What would you say is the key to the closeness that you have with your parents? Honesty.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Talking out problems.
OTHERFEMALE:Financial dependence.
LEADMALE:And honesty and talking out problems.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we made a decision a long time ago that if anyone had a problem, they would come to us and we would talk about it.
LEADMALE:And that works for you? - Definitely.
SUPFEMALE:Um, well, sometimes it's a hard thing to do.
LEADMALE:Like the time I had to tell Mom and Dad that I might not graduate from high school.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:I had the dress altered for you.
SUPMALE:I'm so excited you're going to be wearing it to your graduation.
SUPFEMALE:This really means a lot to me.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what do you think of this frame, Mal? I think your diploma will look great in here.
SUPMALE:Oh, it looks nice the way it is, Dad.
SUPMALE:Do you want to try this on now? Uh, no, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:There's plenty of time for that.
SUPMALE:No, there isn't.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, there's time.
LEADFEMALE:Trust her.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jen.
LEADMALE: Mom, Dad, there's something I have to tell you.
LEADMALE:This isn't easy for me, and it's not going to make you happy.
LEADMALE:I don't like it any more than you will.
OTHERMALE:You know, I don't know why we're going to put ourselves through this.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, I don't know why we're having this conversation.
OTHERMALE:I'm a little fuzzy on it myself.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'm failing history.
LEADMALE:Unless I get a "B" on my final, which is not likely, I'm not going to graduate.
SUPFEMALE:Not graduate? Why is this the first we're hearing of this? I didn't mention it before? No.
SUPMALE:I guess I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, that I'd get that diploma somehow.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, how did you plan on getting this diploma, Mal, by going to the mall four nights a week? By spending all that time with Nick? By talking on the phone all hours? Okay, that didn't work.
LEADFEMALE:I'm real glad you can see the humor in this, Mallory, because I can't.
OTHERMALE:What do you want me to do? I want you to start taking things seriously.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to grow up! - Mom, don't yell at me.
LEADFEMALE:I feel bad enough already.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sometimes I have to yell at you; it's the only way I can get through to you these days.
SUPMALE:All right, come on, come on, getting all upset isn't going to help, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:How could you do this, Mallory?! I didn't want to.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you bring the grade up at all? I don't know.
LEADMALE:My teacher is so unfair to me.
LEADFEMALE:I asked her if I could do extra credit.
LEADMALE:She said, "No, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:You have to get a 'B' on the final or else.
LEADMALE:" There's no way I'm going to be able to do that.
LEADMALE:There's still time.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mom, I can't learn a year's worth of work in four weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't you guys talk to Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Hillman for me? Well, fine, what are we going to say? That she should let you graduate even though you haven't done the work and you don't deserve it? Okay, but put it in your own words.
SUPMALE:If that's your attitude, just fine.
SUPMALE:Don't graduate.
SUPMALE:What do you want me to do? Look, I think your only choice now is to sit down and study as hard as you can.
SUPMALE:Dad, what would be the point? I'd still flunk.
SUPMALE:I'm not smart.
SUPMALE:There's no way I can do this.
OTHERFEMALE:You are smart, Mallory.
SUPMALE:You just don't apply yourself.
OTHERMALE:Your teachers have always said that.
SUPMALE:Look, if you give up on this, you're not even giving yourself a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Now, this time, it's too important.
LEADMALE: I'm scared.
OTHERFEMALE:You have no choice.
SUPFEMALE: Well, I hit the books like I never did before, and by the time the big exam came, I thought I was ready.
LEADMALE:So, have you been studying? Yes, a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good luck.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'm going to ask you six questions.
LEADMALE:I want you to think about what you're going to say and be brief and to the point.
LEADFEMALE:You ready? Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:What was the Louisiana Purchase, and how did it affect Thomas Jefferson's presidency? Well, Thomas Jefferson wanted some land, and, uh, Napoleon had some.
LEADMALE:Uh, so he finally bought it for $15 million, which wasn't a bad price, considering it was from France.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you said you studied.
SUPMALE:I did.
SUPMALE:That answer was gibberish.
LEADMALE:Now tell me the answer in clear and coherent English.
OTHERMALE:I don't know what you mean.
LEADMALE:Well, then you're going to flunk, - and you won't graduate.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hillman When are you going to drop this charade and start acting like an intelligent young woman? I'm doing the best I can.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mallory, if this is the best you can do, then obviously I've overestimated you.
SUPMALE:How can you say that? I've been studying my head off for four weeks.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want from me? An intelligent answer.
LEADMALE:Now, come on.
LEADFEMALE:How did the Louisiana Purchase affect Thomas Jefferson's presidency? Tell me what you think, intelligently.
LEADFEMALE:Can you do that? Or would you rather The Louisiana Purchase was difficult for Jefferson because he supported states' rights, and when he made the purchase, he was doing more for federal powers so he lost political backing for the people involved in states' right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't mean that.
LEADMALE:Mallory, that's what I want from you.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that was an intelligent answer.
LEADMALE:It was? Yes, it was.
LEADMALE:And that is the story of how I got to Grant College.
SUPFEMALE:Grant College, where the school motto is, "Get left back, win a free pie.
LEADMALE:" Hello, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hello, hello.
LEADFEMALE:Look, another Grant College, dare we say, student.
LEADMALE:What brings you by, Skip? Nothing, just a slow night at my house.
SUPMALE:My mother's playing mah-jongg, and my dad's cleaning the furnace with an electric toothbrush.
LEADMALE:Same old stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on here? I'm interviewing the Keatons on what it's like to be a typical American family in 1987.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, then, Lauren, you might want to interview me, too.
SUPMALE:I mean, having lived next door to the Keatons for so many years, I've felt just like part of the family.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Alex and Jen and Mallory have always treated me like a brother.
OTHERMALE:And Mr.
LEADFEMALE:And Mrs.
SUPMALE:Keaton have always treated me like the son they never had.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Skip.
LEADMALE:This isn't cutting into my time at all, is it? No, it's fine.
SUPMALE:Everyone's going to have their chance to speak.
LEADMALE:All right, go ahead, Skippy.
LEADMALE:Um, can you remember a specific time when the when the family embraced you and included you as one of its members? Did we do that? Now that you mention it, I-I can.
SUPFEMALE:It was when I-I first found out that 
SUPMALE:I was adopted.
OTHERFEMALE:You're adopted? Yes.
LEADMALE: Skippy we all know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, anyway, the news was rather shocking, but with the encouragement of the Keatons, I decided to go see my natural mother.
LEADMALE:But it didn't turn out as great as I'd hoped.
LEADFEMALE:She didn't want me back in her life.
LEADFEMALE:When we got back here, I was crushed.
SUPMALE:Alex, I'm in a daze.
LEADMALE:I'm stunned.
OTHERFEMALE:My mother rejected me again.
LEADFEMALE:My mother never would have acted that way.
LEADMALE:That's just the point, Skip.
LEADFEMALE:See, she wouldn't have done that because she is your mother.
LEADMALE:She loves you.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, which mother are you talking about? I'm talking about your mother.
SUPMALE:N-Not not the one from today, but your other mother, your real mother.
LEADMALE:The one from today is my real mother.
LEADMALE:Well, that's true, but I was referring to the mother that you thought was your real mother until a few days ago.
LEADMALE:You mean my mother.
SUPFEMALE:That's what I said, Skip your mother.
SUPFEMALE:When you said my mother, I thought you meant my mother, as in the one who was my mother first.
OTHERMALE:No, no, I'm talking about your other mother.
LEADFEMALE:Not the mother who who knew you first; the mother that you knew first.
LEADFEMALE:Got it.
SUPMALE:What about her? Look, Skip, all all I'm trying to say to you is this.
OTHERFEMALE:Your mother didn't reject you.
LEADFEMALE:The woman who gave birth to you rejected you.
LEADFEMALE:You mean my mother? Let's not start this again, Skip.
LEADMALE:Look, when you were seven years old and you got your head caught in the banister, who got you loose? My mom.
SUPFEMALE:Which mom? The one that raised me.
OTHERMALE:Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Handelman.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:And when you were 13 years old and you got your head caught in the banister who got you loose? That time, it was my dad.
LEADMALE:Um, Mr.
LEADMALE:Handelman.
SUPMALE:Skip, if it wasn't for those two people, your head would be stuck in that banister right now.
LEADMALE:It's true.
LEADFEMALE:See, the woman you met today is your natural mother, and-and there's a guy out there who is your natural father, but they haven't been a part of your life for 16 years.
LEADFEMALE:They-they've had no role in-in nurturing you, in molding you, in-in caring for you.
SUPMALE:They, uh they created a baby, but they had no part in creating the human being that's Irwin N.
LEADMALE:Handelman.
LEADMALE:Oh, even so, Alex, how would you feel if you found out that your mom and dad aren't your natural parents? It would explain a lot of inconsistencies in my family.
SUPMALE:Look, what it gets right down to, Skip, 
SUPMALE:The people who are most important in your life are the people who love you and the people who care about you, and you've got those people just as much as I do.
LEADMALE:  You're home.
SUPMALE:Yeah, just got back.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, we would have been here sooner, but we got stuck at the Wilson Interchange.
LEADMALE:I was worried you might.
LEADFEMALE:They ought to put better signs up there.
SUPFEMALE:So, how'd it go, baby boy? You don't have to call me that anymore.
LEADMALE:Did you meet her? Yeah, I met her.
LEADFEMALE:She was pretty nice.
OTHERFEMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:Alex met her, too.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yeah, she was, uh she was nice.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm glad your real mother's nice.
LEADFEMALE:You're my real mother.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what about me? You're my real dad, Dad.
SUPMALE: Let's go home and have real dinner.
SUPMALE:Let's go home.
LEADFEMALE:I just said that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Honey, tell me and you can be completely honest with me, okay? Are we ever going to get to my personal history? I'm afraid not.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:That's fine.
LEADMALE:Don't pout.
OTHERMALE:I'm not.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:I have the slide projector set up, everything.
SUPFEMALE:I just think that we've discovered a very interesting area here.
SUPMALE:More interesting than me? Have you seen my baby pictures? You know, what I think is interesting is that in all this, there seems to be a sense of responsibility that that bonds this family together.
LEADMALE:I mean, whoever's in need, they-they always have someone to go to.
OTHERMALE:We try to be there for them to, uh to guide them, to nurture, to support them.
LEADFEMALE:Children need their parents.
SUPMALE:Well, Dad, I mean, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not just a one-way street here.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, there have been times that you've come to me for help.
SUPFEMALE:Real? Oh, I don't remember that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, can anyone cite an example of when one or or both of your parents came to you for help? - Ooh, ooh.
LEADMALE:I've got a great one.
LEADMALE:Alex? Okay, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Dad, remember that time that-that-that-that old flame of Mom's came into town? They went out for dinner, and-and you got so jealous you made a fool of yourself? I don't So, what are you doing here? I thought you and Mom were going out with Richie tonight.
SUPFEMALE:We did.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Well, I embarrassed your mother, I embarrassed myself, I embarrassed an old friend, and as far as I can tell now, I'm probably completely wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:So it's nothing new, then.
OTHERMALE:Well, I mean, you know, it's nothing you haven't been through before.
LEADFEMALE:I guess not.
LEADMALE:Listen, Dad, you know, you always told me that it takes a big man to admit when he's wrong.
SUPMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:And to always try and keep a perspective on things.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:To always respect the other person's point of view.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:To understand your own motivations - Right.
SUPFEMALE:control your own worst instincts.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:To always rise Enough! I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Dad.
SUPMALE:You're going to pull through this.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, when you talk to Mom cry if you have to.
LEADMALE:You know, women like that.
LEADFEMALE:It's no skin off your back, and they think it's sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:How did my little prank go over? How could you do this, Steven? I thought we had a bond of love and respect between us, an understanding that would preclude anything like this from ever happening.
OTHERMALE:I'm insulted that you obviously don't feel the same way.
OTHERMALE:I do feel the same way.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? Well, you have an interesting way of showing it.
LEADMALE:Embarrassing and insulting me and a dear old friend in a public place.
LEADMALE:Steven I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement.
SUPMALE:Steven, stop it! What you did tonight was absolutely indefensible! I'm so sick and tired of it.
LEADMALE:I-I don't want to hear another word about it.
SUPMALE:Elyse, I'm sorry, but I only did this because you're the most beautiful, exciting woman I've ever met.
LEADMALE:And sometimes the passion I feel for you is so great, it, it makes me crazy.
SUPMALE:I'm listening.
SUPFEMALE:Do you remember, the first day we met, freshman year, you were lost, you couldn't find your class? I had a map.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, it was a map of Spain.
LEADFEMALE:So, so we spent the day wandering around the town, getting ice cream, uh, browsing through bookstores falling in love.
LEADMALE:Oh, you were so beautiful.
OTHERMALE:You still are.
LEADFEMALE:And even after all these years, after all we've been through, after everything that's happened, I still can't believe you picked me! Go on.
SUPMALE:Don't you see what I'm saying, Elyse? When, when Richie came here and and I found out about the two of you, it just went right to the heart of all the insecurities I've ever had about myself.
OTHERFEMALE:And about whether I'm, uh, good enough for you.
SUPMALE:Steven, what do you think I've been doing all these years? Biding my time till I found someone I really liked? I don't want to become one of those couples, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:The ones that have settled, grown tired, bored, where everyone else is more exciting than the person they're married to.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want that either, Steven! I want there to be romance, bells going off, quickened pulses when I walk through that door.
LEADFEMALE:I want that look, that look is mine.
LEADFEMALE:What look?! My look.
LEADMALE:The one that's supposed to be only for me.
LEADFEMALE:The look that tells me that we're really meant to be together; that I'm the one.
LEADMALE:I have a look that says all that? Yeah, I showed it to you yesterday! I can't do it.
SUPFEMALE:You do it! Now you look like Daffy Duck.
SUPMALE:Steven, forget the look.
OTHERFEMALE:The look isn't important.
LEADFEMALE:What's important is is that we trust each other.
LEADMALE:You're my best friend, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:I rely on you.
LEADMALE:I want you to rely on me.
LEADMALE:I love you, Steven.
SUPMALE:Let's go upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Why go upstairs Captain Romance? That's the look.
SUPMALE:Get a camera.
LEADMALE:You really do love me, huh? - Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Quick, somebody stop them before they start kissing.
SUPFEMALE:Get a bucket of water or bang on some cymbals or something.
LEADFEMALE:My parents never kiss in front of me.
SUPFEMALE:At their most romantic, they might rub noses or pull each other's hair.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think that's all the time that we have for tonight.
LEADMALE: Alex, I'm going to take your baby pictures home.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to look at them later.
LEADFEMALE:It's not the same.
LEADFEMALE:Who's going to be there to-to "Ooh"? Who's going to be there to "Ah"? I really want to thank you all for taking the time to share your views and experiences with me.
LEADFEMALE:It's been very enlightening.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think the pleasure's been ours.
LEADFEMALE:I really enjoyed this little trip down memory lane.
LEADFEMALE:All right, in closing, if you had to pick one word that means family to you, what would it be? Love.
LEADMALE:Love.
OTHERFEMALE:Love.
LEADFEMALE:Love.
LEADFEMALE:Money.
LEADMALE:Love of money.
LEADMALE:Love.
LEADMALE:Love.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think you can sum up family.
SUPMALE:It's a web of interchanging and always-changing relations and emotions.
LEADMALE:Come on, Alex.
SUPMALE:You're his big brother.
SUPMALE:You set a good example for him.
OTHERMALE:Mom, no, this is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:Show him! Okay, watch Alex, Andrew.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Now the mama bird flies back to her nest.
LEADMALE:And the baby bird opens up his mouth so big Come on, Alex, open your mouth, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Open.
SUPFEMALE:Would you open your mouth, Alex! Hi, guys.
SUPMALE:I can't get either one of them to eat! Dad, we need a new mom.
OTHERMALE:This one's had it.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know what it means that we're brothers? It means that I have to do everything that you say.
LEADMALE:That's a big part of it, yep.
LEADFEMALE:If you want to fit in around here, Nick, you got to look like me, you got to act like me, you got to talk like me, you got to be another me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll do it.
LEADMALE:I'll do it because I love Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you do it? All right, all right, okay, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I've tried to appeal to your sense of compassion.
LEADFEMALE:I have no other option.
LEADMALE:Ten dollars.
SUPMALE:$20.
SUPMALE:$12.
LEADMALE:$17.
LEADFEMALE:$14.
LEADFEMALE:50.
OTHERMALE:$15.
LEADMALE:75.
LEADMALE:$15.
LEADFEMALE:25.
LEADMALE:$15.
LEADFEMALE:50.
LEADMALE:Done.
OTHERMALE:You guys are really something, you know that? You're a very special couple.
LEADFEMALE:You do things together.
LEADFEMALE:You, you learn from each other, you share things.
OTHERFEMALE:Common interests.
SUPFEMALE:You like being with each other.
LEADFEMALE:What's your secret? I never get my way.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know that I used to sit around just thinking about what it would be like if we got married?  Married? Yeah! Yeah, I had the whole thing planned out.
OTHERMALE:A-A big ceremony at night under a big tent.
SUPMALE:Like a circus? Exactly.
LEADMALE:But instead of walking down the aisle, I'd get shot out of a cannon toward the altar.
LEADMALE:And then, uh, we'd go on our honeymoon.
LEADMALE:We'd go to Paris, where we'd spend our evenings dining alone on the banks of the Nile.
LEADMALE:Skippy the Nile's in London.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, if we've given Alex more freedom in his personal life, it's only because he's a boy and you're a girl! Go ahead.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to hear the rest of that.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you just said that, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Mal - Hang tough, hang tough.
SUPFEMALE:Looking good.
LEADMALE:This is really nice.
LEADMALE:Uh, you guys eat like this all the time? You mean with utensils? Ow! What is this?! I found it in the shower! That's generic-brand shampoo.
OTHERFEMALE: It's family, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You can't escape it.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'm hip.
LEADFEMALE:I'm cool.
SUPMALE:I'm a happening fool.
LEADMALE:I want to slow this thing down, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Going too fast.
LEADFEMALE:Yesterday Jennifer was two.
OTHERFEMALE:Today she's 11.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex is 18.
LEADMALE:What the hell's going on here? It's life.
OTHERMALE:That's what's going on here.
LEADFEMALE:I love you all so much.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you, honey.
OTHERMALE:Alex loves me.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Dad.
LEADMALE:I love you more every day.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, too, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Everything I care about, really, really, care about is in this house.
LEADFEMALE: Just think about how we just love each other.
LEADMALE:Just remember those things.
SUPFEMALE:We do
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:As you all know, Lauren is doing a paper on the American family.
LEADFEMALE:And as you also may know, she's chosen us to be her case study.
LEADFEMALE:So, I want you all to answer the questions to the best of your ability, all right? Um, Mom and Dad, uh, feel free to refer to any old photo albums.
LEADMALE:Mallory may need the aid of a thesaurus.
OTHERMALE:Or, if Nick comes by, he may wish to express himself through cave paintings.
SUPMALE:Any questions? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Who said you can do all the talking? All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:All right, go ahead, honey.
SUPMALE:Okay, are there any questions before I get started with my questions? Ooh! Ooh! Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Miss Miller, uh, you've picked us - as the typical American family.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, does this mean you-you you find me to be typical? Because, uh because I've always kind of prided myself on not being typical.
LEADFEMALE:You know, not normal.
LEADMALE:You've succeeded at that.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Mr.
LEADMALE:And Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton, I'll start with you, because, after all, if it wasn't for the two of you, this family wouldn't even be here.
LEADMALE:What does she mean by that? Because they're the mommy and daddy.
LEADMALE:How did they get to be the mommy and daddy? They won a raffle.
LEADMALE:Okay, when you first met, uh, did it ever occur to you that your life would turn out this way? I mean, was having a family always the main goal? Well, uh, when I met Elyse, it was truly magical.
SUPMALE:The first time I laid eyes on her, I knew we'd be together forever.
LEADFEMALE:I swear, at that moment, time and space did not exist.
LEADFEMALE:Just us.
LEADMALE:Is it any wonder I find him so attractive? How come you didn't inherit any of your father's romantic side? Hey, come Me? You're kidding.
OTHERMALE:I'm-I'm-I'm on the FBI's ten most romantic list.
SUPMALE:Violins play wherever I go.
LEADMALE:Try leaving the room.
LEADFEMALE:See if the music starts up.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, so then, after the two of you met and you fell in love, did, uh, things go as you hoped they would? Would you say that your life is the fulfillment of a dream that the two of you set out for yourselves? But there were a lot of surprises along the way.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you give me an example? Well, when I found out that I was pregnant with Andy, that was a surprise.
OTHERMALE:A delightful surprise.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you okay? Hmm? Oh, sure.
SUPMALE:I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:I just couldn't sleep, I was so excited.
SUPMALE:How are you two feeling? Fine.
SUPMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:How are you? I had a little trouble sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh I can't stop thinking.
OTHERMALE:About what? I mean, about what specifically? Elyse, I'm 40 years old.
LEADFEMALE:I'm, uh, about to become a father again.
LEADMALE:Last time I changed a diaper, Richard Nixon was president.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I'd seen the last of both of them.
OTHERMALE:You know what I keep realizing? - What? We're going to have to start watching Sesame Street again, Romper Room, Mr.
LEADMALE:Rogers.
LEADMALE:I like Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Rogers.
LEADFEMALE:Have to start going to the zoo.
SUPMALE:Pony rides, birthday parties.
LEADMALE:Sterilizing baby bottles.
LEADMALE:Tripping over toys.
OTHERFEMALE:Before you know it, the terrible twos will be upon us.
LEADFEMALE:Remember when Alex used to run around the house all the time going, "Mine! Mine!"? He never really outgrew that, did he? Seems like such a long time ago.
SUPMALE:You know, I've been doing some calculations.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm? When the baby's ten, I'll be 50.
LEADMALE:When the baby's 20, I'll be 60.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
OTHERFEMALE:When the baby's 30, I'll be 70.
LEADMALE:to have a baby, isn't it? It won't be a baby when it's 30.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess you're right.
LEADFEMALE:When the baby's 40, Jennifer will be 51.
LEADMALE:Steven, cut it out! I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm just not used to the idea.
LEADFEMALE:Neither am I.
LEADFEMALE:It's a nice idea to get used to, isn't it? I wish the kids were more excited.
SUPMALE:Oh, they'll come around.
SUPMALE:Who could not love a beautiful newborn baby? Besides, it gives us someone else to pick on.
SUPFEMALE:You know, uh, there's one other thing about this we haven't mentioned.
SUPMALE:It's going to be real expensive, huh? I find this absolutely the sexiest thing in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Cut it out.
LEADMALE:Don't you know that's how you got into trouble in the first place? Alex, what are you doing up? How am I supposed to sleep, Mom? I'm about to become a brother for the third time.
LEADMALE:It's not going to happen tonight, Alex.
LEADMALE:It's not, is it, Elyse? I can almost guarantee it.
OTHERMALE:What's in the package? Oh, uh, it's, uh, something I picked up for the little guy.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's so cute! Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, pull the string.
SUPMALE:I love Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Isn't that sweet? I love it! Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, I think I need to get one of these for myself.
OTHERMALE:This little toy reminds me of when you were a baby.
SUPMALE:Alex, do you remember that song we used to sing to you when you were little? It was your favorite one, and it always made you smile.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Don't you remember? It was, um Mom, get a hold of yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:This is going to be a long nine months.
SUPFEMALE:We thought about having a little brother or sister.
SUPMALE:We decided that it could be a lot of fun.
SUPMALE:Yeah, the family needs a little shaking up anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:This is beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Look at it! Well, it's getting pretty late.
LEADFEMALE:I think we'd better call it a night, huh? - Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:It did seem like a long nine months, but when Andy was born, it was an incredible thrill for us all.
SUPFEMALE:Especially Alex, it seemed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know, Steven, he has your eyes.
OTHERMALE:Maybe those are my eyes, but that is your nose.
LEADMALE:I'd know it anywhere.
LEADMALE:You're great, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you, love.
SUPMALE:Oh, so are you.
SUPFEMALE:Can we come in? We heard a baby.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we thought it might be yours.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow.
LEADMALE:It's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you! Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Ah! Ah, yes, that was a magical moment.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it was fun for me, too.
OTHERMALE:What was it like to all of a sudden have a brand-new baby in the house? How were your daily patterns affected? Well, all of a sudden, there were diapers to change, formula to make.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and rattles, first words and the constant squeak from that Jolly Jumper till I thought it was going to break off its hinges.
SUPMALE:Babies have tons of energy.
OTHERMALE:No, that was Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I was I was just checking out the shocks on the thing, you know.
OTHERMALE:Making sure it was safe.
LEADMALE:What was the thing that changed most for the rest of the family? Was-was there anything that you felt missing in your life? Sleep.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? I'm going in to get Andrew.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, that will be the fifth time you've picked him up since midnight.
LEADMALE:Elyse, he's crying.
SUPMALE:Honey, we've been through this before.
SUPFEMALE:If you pick Andrew up every time he cries, he's never going to stop crying.
LEADFEMALE:Does that mean, when he's 30, he'll still cry in his crib? Not if we bring him up right.
LEADMALE:Elyse, how can you be so cruel? He's only been alone for four minutes.
LEADMALE:Four minutes is a big chunk of his life, Elyse.
SUPMALE:We are not going to spoil this baby, Steven.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Let's go back to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, has this kid got lungs.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my heaven.
LEADMALE:Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? I was going to straighten this picture.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse! Oh, he's still crying, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought you didn't want to spoil him.
SUPFEMALE:I don't, but I can't bear to hear him cry.
LEADMALE:He stopped crying.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
SUPMALE:Is Andrew up again? - Yeah.
SUPMALE:We can't get him to go to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, maybe we should sing to him.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, we want him to sleep, not try and escape.
SUPFEMALE:We should try singing.
SUPMALE:We should try anything.
LEADMALE:I've got to get some sleep.
LEADFEMALE:We'll sing, we'll sing.
SUPMALE:Well, wait.
LEADMALE:What are we going to sing? Something for a baby.
LEADMALE:Hey, do you know "Let's Get Crazy" by Prince? It was our wedding song.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:No, no, come on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not singing anything by Prince.
SUPFEMALE:Come on! He's tired! Good night.
LEADMALE:Look, we can work this out.
OTHERFEMALE:We can work it out.
LEADMALE:I know we can.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what has stopped him from crying so far? When we went in there to sing, he stopped crying.
LEADFEMALE:Go in there to sing stop crying.
SUPMALE:When I brought him out here before, he stopped crying.
OTHERFEMALE:Bring him out here stop cry okay.
LEADFEMALE:I've got it.
SUPMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:What are you going to do? Shh, shh.
SUPFEMALE:Wow, what are you doing? Okay, take it easy.
SUPFEMALE:That's my good boy.
LEADFEMALE:That's my good boy.
LEADFEMALE:Nice try, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yes, the song stylings of the Keaton family.
LEADMALE:That that was quite a night.
LEADFEMALE:It's getting late, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's time for bed.
LEADMALE:But, Dad, I'm the center of attention.
SUPMALE:Well, why don't you go on up, and I'll be the center of attention.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Andy, I'll take you up.
SUPMALE:Good night, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Andy.
LEADMALE:Well, honey is it time for my personal history yet? No, not just yet.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, you give me lots of warning, okay? Because I got to set up that whole slide show and We're onto an interesting area here.
LEADMALE:The-the most recent addition to this typical American family.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, as Andy grew, would you say the style in which you raised him was any different from the rest of the children? Well, actually, it was very much the same.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but-but as time went on, we started getting little hints that-that Alex intended to be more involved in Andy's upbringing than we had hoped.
LEADMALE:This started very early on.
LEADMALE:Okay, Andy, you ready? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:This is him.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the guy I've been telling you about.
OTHERMALE:This is everything you'd want in a president.
LEADMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:Put this away you'll frighten him.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, there you go again, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Republican.
LEADMALE:And then there were other hints.
LEADMALE:Things that were tough to ignore.
LEADMALE:Who's that? - You.
LEADMALE:Who am I? - My mommy.
SUPMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:And who's that pretty girl? - Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Who's Jennifer? - My sister.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Who's that? - Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Who is Alex? Alex is king.
SUPFEMALE:And after a while, we had to face the fact that we had another Alex on our hands.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy, come quick gold closed at $4.
SUPFEMALE:15.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you for having him.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, got to love that kid.
LEADMALE:I got to admit their relationship is cute in its own weird way.
OTHERMALE:What's wrong with a little brother following in his older brother's footsteps? What's wrong with our footsteps? Well, hey, Dad, you know, he would've followed in your footsteps I just got to him first.
LEADMALE:Why couldn't he follow in my footsteps? Oh, great, he'd be on a on a circular track to and from the mall.
SUPMALE:What's wrong with that? His first words would be, "Attention, shoppers.
LEADMALE:" Alex has, on occasion, uh, taken this "follow in his footsteps" business a little too far.
LEADFEMALE:Moi? Oui.
LEADFEMALE:I seem to remember Andy's first day of preschool.
SUPMALE:You went a little overboard there.
LEADFEMALE:Moi? MALLORY, ELYSE and 
LEADFEMALE:Oui.
LEADMALE:Andy, here's your lunch box.
SUPMALE:Now, these are your coloring books and your crayons.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, how do we feel about sharing? Attaboy.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Okay, now, you just wear this, and I don't think we'll have any problem.
SUPMALE:Good morning, Andy.
LEADMALE:Good morning, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kluger.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kluger.
LEADMALE:I'm Alex Keaton, Andy's brother.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Mrs.
LEADMALE:Kluger, the director.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, listen, Andy, I got to run to class now, but remember, tonight, we're going to go out, we're going to get ice cream, then I'm going to take you and show you how the automated teller machines work.
LEADMALE:Okay? Remember who loves you? Alex loves me.
LEADFEMALE:You know it.
OTHERMALE:So, uh how's he doing? Oh, he's a terrific child.
LEADFEMALE:He's very sensitive and very thoughtful of the other children.
SUPMALE:Well, I can't help that; it's my parents' influence.
LEADMALE:You know, Andrew talks about you all the time, Alex.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? Yeah, he mentions your name so often, you'd think someone was paying him to talk about you.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kluger, do you mind if I take a little look around here? Oh, no, feel free we encourage visitors.
OTHERMALE:We're completely open and free here.
SUPFEMALE:That's nothing to brag about.
SUPMALE:So, this is the library? Yeah, and we try to fill it with colorful, interesting books.
LEADFEMALE:We've got, uh, Old Charlie Goes to School, A Snowy Day, The Curious Cow.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we've got that one at home.
SUPMALE:Mallory's reading it.
LEADFEMALE:My sister.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you've also got a sister in preschool.
SUPMALE:No, Mallory couldn't get into preschool.
LEADMALE:So she's going to Grant College.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Kluger.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Michael.
LEADMALE:What does your patch say? I know how to say good-bye to my daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Very good, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that wonderful, Alex? What's so wonderful about that? I know how to say good-bye to my daddy.
OTHERMALE:You don't see me wearing a patch.
LEADMALE:Well, we try to encourage Michael he's very shy.
OTHERFEMALE:This gives him a sense of accomplishment.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm all for creating a sense of accomplishment, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kluger.
SUPMALE:I just question your methods.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, what do you suggest? Well, have you thought about dividing the children into different play groups? Giving them IQ tests? Well, Alex, we're trying to foster a noncompetitive environment.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Kluger.
SUPMALE:Join us in the real world here.
SUPMALE:Do you see people out there who are noncompetitive? People sharing? People taking naps on mats? Steven and Elyse Keaton are your parents? Oh, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Kluger, I got to go.
LEADMALE:Um, I'm just going to say good-bye to Andy, - and I'll be on my way.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:He's over there playing house.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:That's impossible Andy doesn't play house.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course he does.
SUPMALE:See him diapering that doll? He's diapering a doll? Andy, what are you doing? Diapering a doll.
LEADFEMALE:Where's your wife? Out working.
LEADMALE:We're out of here.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:You took Andy out of preschool? I brought him back.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, after the deprogramming didn't work.
LEADMALE:So, Alex seems to be a little overzealous when it comes to Andy.
OTHERMALE:Well well, yes, I am, sugarplum.
LEADMALE:Could you explain further this obsessive involvement? Well, frankly, it has to do with the way I was raised.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? One thing you have to know about Mom and Dad is that they're not your normal parents.
LEADMALE:He says the sweetest things.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what I mean is they really got involved in everything we did.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes a little over-involved.
SUPFEMALE:Can anyone cite an example? - More popcorn? - Uh There was this time that Dad felt he wasn't spending enough time with me, so he decided to become my buddy.
LEADMALE:Oh, right.
SUPFEMALE:All right! Well, what do you say, Dad? Do you want to go now? We've been here three minutes, Jennifer.
OTHERMALE:All right, that was very nice singing, girls.
LEADMALE:And now onto the new business.
OTHERFEMALE:I would like to welcome all the moms and the dad.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, nice that you could come, sir.
LEADMALE:Uh, thank you, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Carpenter.
LEADMALE:I feel very much at home.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I'd like to give you all a warm Sunflower Dad! Well.
LEADFEMALE:Now it's time for the round table.
SUPMALE:Oh, what's that? - Well, once a month, we discuss some topic of interest to the Sunflower Girls.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great, I'm-I'm all ready camping, boating, hiking? Today we're going to talk about sex.
LEADMALE:I'm your guy.
LEADMALE:Did you say "sex"? Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, maybe you should go, really.
LEADMALE:Nonsense, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a Sunflower Dad.
LEADMALE:I think I can handle a a mature discussion about, uh, what she said.
SUPMALE:Now, we're going to discuss our bodies as they blossom into womanhood.
SUPFEMALE:And about boys and their bodies as they burst into manhood.
LEADMALE:I know that some of you have already gone out on dates with boys, and I want to talk about first experiences.
LEADMALE:And I want the younger girls to benefit from you older girls.
LEADFEMALE:So we're going to go around the room starting with you, Shelly.
SUPFEMALE:Well, on my first date, I went out with a guy in my class.
LEADMALE:I'm not going to name names, but Was it Larry Barker? That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, I went out with Larry, and all he wanted to do was fool around.
LEADMALE:What do you mean by "fool around"? I mean he wanted to touch my body as it blossomed into womanhood.
SUPMALE:Boys are only interested Sex.
SUPMALE:Right, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton? Well well, uh - Wh-What's your name? - Alice.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Alice, some boys are very interested in sex.
SUPFEMALE:Were you? Well, um, when I was a boy, I was interested in a lot of things.
LEADMALE:Was sex one of them? Well, I was interested in, uh, baseball, basketball, football.
LEADFEMALE:You're not answering the question.
SUPFEMALE:Get off my back, will you? I don't want to lie to you, uh, Alice.
LEADFEMALE:Uh I admit, there there were some, uh, girls, uh, that, uh I remember Marjorie McCracken.
LEADMALE:Boy, she had a body on her.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I can't believe you're talking about this stuff.
LEADMALE:What can I do? She was hounding me.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, you're really embarrassing me.
OTHERMALE:This is not the place for you to be.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you say that? Look around you, Dad.
LEADMALE:Do you see anyone else here who shaves? Jennifer, I just want to spend some time with you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, Dad, but this isn't the right place.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't leave, I will.
SUPFEMALE:I have to say I learned a lot from that meeting.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:Like don't ever be seen with your father in public.
SUPMALE:I think it's a lovely thing your father did.
SUPMALE:It shows what kind of dad he is.
LEADMALE:He's not a stay-at-home dad.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, in the future, do us a favor stay at home.
LEADFEMALE:Can you think of other ways that your father embarrassed I-I mean got involved in what you kids were doing? Nothing specific, but he was always involved.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, too.
LEADFEMALE:What would you say is the key to the closeness that you have with your parents? Honesty.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Talking out problems.
SUPFEMALE:Financial dependence.
SUPMALE:And honesty and talking out problems.
LEADMALE:Well, we made a decision a long time ago that if anyone had a problem, they would come to us and we would talk about it.
SUPMALE:And that works for you? - Definitely.
SUPFEMALE:Um, well, sometimes it's a hard thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Like the time I had to tell Mom and Dad that I might not graduate from high school.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I had the dress altered for you.
SUPMALE:I'm so excited you're going to be wearing it to your graduation.
LEADMALE:This really means a lot to me.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, what do you think of this frame, Mal? I think your diploma will look great in here.
SUPMALE:Oh, it looks nice the way it is, Dad.
LEADMALE:Do you want to try this on now? Uh, no, Mom.
LEADMALE:There's plenty of time for that.
SUPFEMALE:No, there isn't.
LEADMALE:Mom, there's time.
SUPMALE:Trust her.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Dad, there's something I have to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't easy for me, and it's not going to make you happy.
SUPMALE:I don't like it any more than you will.
SUPMALE:You know, I don't know why we're going to put ourselves through this.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, I don't know why we're having this conversation.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a little fuzzy on it myself.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'm failing history.
LEADMALE:Unless I get a "B" on my final, which is not likely, I'm not going to graduate.
SUPMALE:Not graduate? Why is this the first we're hearing of this? I didn't mention it before? No.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, that I'd get that diploma somehow.
LEADMALE:Well, how did you plan on getting this diploma, Mal, by going to the mall four nights a week? By spending all that time with Nick? By talking on the phone all hours? Okay, that didn't work.
LEADMALE:I'm real glad you can see the humor in this, Mallory, because I can't.
LEADMALE:What do you want me to do? I want you to start taking things seriously.
SUPMALE:I want you to grow up! - Mom, don't yell at me.
LEADFEMALE:I feel bad enough already.
LEADMALE:Well, sometimes I have to yell at you; it's the only way I can get through to you these days.
SUPMALE:All right, come on, come on, getting all upset isn't going to help, Elyse.
LEADMALE:How could you do this, Mallory?! I didn't want to.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you bring the grade up at all? I don't know.
LEADMALE:My teacher is so unfair to me.
LEADFEMALE:I asked her if I could do extra credit.
LEADFEMALE:She said, "No, Mallory.
LEADMALE:You have to get a 'B' on the final or else.
SUPFEMALE:" There's no way I'm going to be able to do that.
LEADMALE:There's still time.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mom, I can't learn a year's worth of work in four weeks.
SUPMALE:Can't you guys talk to Mrs.
LEADMALE:Hillman for me? Well, fine, what are we going to say? That she should let you graduate even though you haven't done the work and you don't deserve it? Okay, but put it in your own words.
LEADMALE:If that's your attitude, just fine.
LEADMALE:Don't graduate.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want me to do? Look, I think your only choice now is to sit down and study as hard as you can.
OTHERMALE:Dad, what would be the point? I'd still flunk.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not smart.
SUPMALE:There's no way I can do this.
OTHERFEMALE:You are smart, Mallory.
LEADMALE:You just don't apply yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Your teachers have always said that.
LEADMALE:Look, if you give up on this, you're not even giving yourself a chance.
SUPMALE:Now, this time, it's too important.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm scared.
OTHERMALE:You have no choice.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I hit the books like I never did before, and by the time the big exam came, I thought I was ready.
LEADFEMALE:So, have you been studying? Yes, a lot.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Well, good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, I'm going to ask you six questions.
LEADMALE:I want you to think about what you're going to say and be brief and to the point.
SUPMALE:You ready? Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:What was the Louisiana Purchase, and how did it affect Thomas Jefferson's presidency? Well, Thomas Jefferson wanted some land, and, uh, Napoleon had some.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, so he finally bought it for $15 million, which wasn't a bad price, considering it was from France.
LEADMALE:I thought you said you studied.
OTHERMALE:I did.
LEADMALE:That answer was gibberish.
LEADFEMALE:Now tell me the answer in clear and coherent English.
SUPMALE:I don't know what you mean.
SUPMALE:Well, then you're going to flunk, - and you won't graduate.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hillman When are you going to drop this charade and start acting like an intelligent young woman? I'm doing the best I can.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mallory, if this is the best you can do, then obviously I've overestimated you.
LEADMALE:How can you say that? I've been studying my head off for four weeks.
SUPMALE:What do you want from me? An intelligent answer.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, come on.
LEADMALE:How did the Louisiana Purchase affect Thomas Jefferson's presidency? Tell me what you think, intelligently.
LEADMALE:Can you do that? Or would you rather The Louisiana Purchase was difficult for Jefferson because he supported states' rights, and when he made the purchase, he was doing more for federal powers so he lost political backing for the people involved in states' right.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean that.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, that's what I want from you.
OTHERMALE:Now, that was an intelligent answer.
LEADFEMALE:It was? Yes, it was.
LEADFEMALE:And that is the story of how I got to Grant College.
SUPMALE:Grant College, where the school motto is, "Get left back, win a free pie.
SUPFEMALE:" Hello, everybody.
SUPMALE:Hey, hello, hello.
SUPFEMALE:Look, another Grant College, dare we say, student.
SUPMALE:What brings you by, Skip? Nothing, just a slow night at my house.
SUPFEMALE:My mother's playing mah-jongg, and my dad's cleaning the furnace with an electric toothbrush.
SUPMALE:Same old stuff.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on here? I'm interviewing the Keatons on what it's like to be a typical American family in 1987.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, then, Lauren, you might want to interview me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, having lived next door to the Keatons for so many years, I've felt just like part of the family.
LEADMALE:Really? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Alex and Jen and Mallory have always treated me like a brother.
OTHERFEMALE:And Mr.
LEADFEMALE:And Mrs.
SUPMALE:Keaton have always treated me like the son they never had.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Skip.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't cutting into my time at all, is it? No, it's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone's going to have their chance to speak.
SUPFEMALE:All right, go ahead, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Um, can you remember a specific time when the when the family embraced you and included you as one of its members? Did we do that? Now that you mention it, I-I can.
LEADFEMALE:It was when I-I first found out that I was adopted.
SUPFEMALE:You're adopted? Yes.
LEADMALE:Skippy we all know.
SUPMALE:Well, anyway, the news was rather shocking, but with the encouragement of the Keatons, I decided to go see my natural mother.
LEADMALE:But it didn't turn out as great as I'd hoped.
SUPFEMALE:She didn't want me back in her life.
LEADFEMALE:When we got back here, I was crushed.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, I'm in a daze.
SUPMALE:I'm stunned.
LEADFEMALE:My mother rejected me again.
SUPMALE:My mother never would have acted that way.
LEADFEMALE:That's just the point, Skip.
OTHERMALE:See, she wouldn't have done that because she is your mother.
LEADFEMALE:She loves you.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, which mother are you talking about? I'm talking about your mother.
LEADMALE:N-Not not the one from today, but your other mother, your real mother.
LEADFEMALE:The one from today is my real mother.
LEADMALE:Well, that's true, but I was referring to the mother that you thought was your real mother until a few days ago.
LEADFEMALE:You mean my mother.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I said, Skip your mother.
SUPMALE:When you said my mother, I thought you meant my mother, as in the one who was my mother first.
SUPMALE:No, no, I'm talking about your other mother.
LEADMALE:Not the mother who who knew you first; the mother that you knew first.
OTHERFEMALE:Got it.
LEADFEMALE:What about her? Look, Skip, all all I'm trying to say to you is this.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother didn't reject you.
SUPFEMALE:The woman who gave birth to you rejected you.
LEADFEMALE:You mean my mother? Let's not start this again, Skip.
SUPMALE:Look, when you were seven years old and you got your head caught in the banister, who got you loose? My mom.
SUPFEMALE:Which mom? The one that raised me.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Handelman.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:And when you were 13 years old and you got your head caught in the banister who got you loose? That time, it was my dad.
SUPMALE:Um, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Handelman.
SUPFEMALE:Skip, if it wasn't for those two people, your head would be stuck in that banister right now.
LEADFEMALE:It's true.
LEADFEMALE:See, the woman you met today is your natural mother, and-and there's a guy out there who is your natural father, but they haven't been a part of your life for 16 years.
SUPMALE:They-they've had no role in-in nurturing you, in molding you, in-in caring for you.
LEADFEMALE:They, uh they created a baby, but they had no part in creating the human being that's Irwin N.
SUPFEMALE:Handelman.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, even so, Alex, how would you feel if you found out that your mom and dad aren't your natural parents? It would explain a lot of inconsistencies in my family.
SUPMALE:Look, what it gets right down to, Skip, 
OTHERFEMALE:The people who are most important in your life are the people who love you and the people who care about you, and you've got those people just as much as I do.
LEADFEMALE:You're home.
SUPMALE:Yeah, just got back.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, we would have been here sooner, but we got stuck at the Wilson Interchange.
OTHERMALE:I was worried you might.
LEADMALE:They ought to put better signs up there.
LEADMALE:So, how'd it go, baby boy? You don't have to call me that anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Did you meet her? Yeah, I met her.
LEADFEMALE:She was pretty nice.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:Alex met her, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, she was, uh she was nice.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm glad your real mother's nice.
SUPMALE:You're my real mother.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what about me? You're my real dad, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Let's go home and have real dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go home.
LEADMALE:I just said that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Honey, tell me and you can be completely honest with me, okay? Are we ever going to get to my personal history? I'm afraid not.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, okay.
SUPMALE:That's fine.
LEADMALE:Don't pout.
LEADMALE:I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:I have the slide projector set up, everything.
SUPFEMALE:I just think that we've discovered a very interesting area here.
SUPMALE:More interesting than me? Have you seen my baby pictures? You know, what I think is interesting is that in all this, there seems to be a sense of responsibility that that bonds this family together.
LEADMALE:I mean, whoever's in need, they-they always have someone to go to.
LEADFEMALE:We try to be there for them to, uh to guide them, to nurture, to support them.
LEADFEMALE:Children need their parents.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Dad, I mean, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:It's not just a one-way street here.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there have been times that you've come to me for help.
LEADMALE:Real? Oh, I don't remember that.
OTHERMALE:Well, I do.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, can anyone cite an example of when one or or both of your parents came to you for help? - Ooh, ooh.
LEADMALE:I've got a great one.
LEADFEMALE:Alex? Okay, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Dad, remember that time that-that-that-that old flame of Mom's came into town? They went out for dinner, and-and you got so jealous you made a fool of yourself? I don't So, what are you doing here? I thought you and Mom were going out with Richie tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:We did.
OTHERMALE:What happened? Well, I embarrassed your mother, I embarrassed myself, I embarrassed an old friend, and as far as I can tell now, I'm probably completely wrong.
LEADMALE:So it's nothing new, then.
LEADMALE:Well, I mean, you know, it's nothing you haven't been through before.
SUPFEMALE:I guess not.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Dad, you know, you always told me that it takes a big man to admit when he's wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:And to always try and keep a perspective on things.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:To always respect the other person's point of view.
LEADMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:To understand your own motivations - Right.
SUPFEMALE:control your own worst instincts.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:To always rise Enough! I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry, Dad.
SUPMALE:You're going to pull through this.
LEADMALE:And, uh, when you talk to Mom cry if you have to.
OTHERMALE:You know, women like that.
SUPMALE:It's no skin off your back, and they think it's sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:How did my little prank go over? How could you do this, Steven? I thought we had a bond of love and respect between us, an understanding that would preclude anything like this from ever happening.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm insulted that you obviously don't feel the same way.
SUPFEMALE:I do feel the same way.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Well, you have an interesting way of showing it.
LEADMALE:Embarrassing and insulting me and a dear old friend in a public place.
SUPFEMALE:Steven I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement.
LEADMALE:Steven, stop it! What you did tonight was absolutely indefensible! I'm so sick and tired of it.
LEADFEMALE:I-I don't want to hear another word about it.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'm sorry, but I only did this because you're the most beautiful, exciting woman I've ever met.
LEADFEMALE:And sometimes the passion I feel for you is so great, it, it makes me crazy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm listening.
SUPFEMALE:Do you remember, the first day we met, freshman year, you were lost, you couldn't find your class? I had a map.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, it was a map of Spain.
LEADMALE:So, so we spent the day wandering around the town, getting ice cream, uh, browsing through bookstores falling in love.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you were so beautiful.
LEADMALE:You still are.
LEADMALE:And even after all these years, after all we've been through, after everything that's happened, I still can't believe you picked me! Go on.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you see what I'm saying, Elyse? When, when Richie came here and and I found out about the two of you, it just went right to the heart of all the insecurities I've ever had about myself.
SUPFEMALE:And about whether I'm, uh, good enough for you.
LEADMALE:Steven, what do you think I've been doing all these years? Biding my time till I found someone I really liked? I don't want to become one of those couples, Elyse.
LEADMALE:The ones that have settled, grown tired, bored, where everyone else is more exciting than the person they're married to.
OTHERMALE:I don't want that either, Steven! I want there to be romance, bells going off, quickened pulses when I walk through that door.
SUPMALE:I want that look, that look is mine.
LEADMALE:What look?! My look.
LEADMALE:The one that's supposed to be only for me.
LEADFEMALE:The look that tells me that we're really meant to be together; that I'm the one.
LEADFEMALE:I have a look that says all that? Yeah, I showed it to you yesterday! I can't do it.
SUPFEMALE:You do it! Now you look like Daffy Duck.
OTHERMALE:Steven, forget the look.
SUPFEMALE:The look isn't important.
SUPFEMALE:What's important is is that we trust each other.
LEADMALE:You're my best friend, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:I rely on you.
SUPMALE:I want you to rely on me.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go upstairs.
LEADMALE:Why go upstairs Captain Romance? That's the look.
LEADMALE:Get a camera.
SUPFEMALE:You really do love me, huh? - Mm.
LEADMALE:Quick, somebody stop them before they start kissing.
SUPFEMALE:Get a bucket of water or bang on some cymbals or something.
SUPMALE:My parents never kiss in front of me.
OTHERFEMALE:At their most romantic, they might rub noses or pull each other's hair.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I think that's all the time that we have for tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'm going to take your baby pictures home.
LEADMALE:I'm going to look at them later.
LEADMALE:It's not the same.
LEADMALE:Who's going to be there to-to "Ooh"? Who's going to be there to "Ah"? I really want to thank you all for taking the time to share your views and experiences with me.
OTHERFEMALE:It's been very enlightening.
LEADMALE:Well, I think the pleasure's been ours.
OTHERFEMALE:I really enjoyed this little trip down memory lane.
LEADMALE:All right, in closing, if you had to pick one word that means family to you, what would it be? Love.
SUPMALE:Love.
LEADMALE:Love.
OTHERFEMALE:Love.
SUPMALE:Money.
LEADFEMALE:Love of money.
SUPMALE:Love.
SUPFEMALE:Love.
SUPMALE:I don't think you can sum up family.
SUPMALE:It's a web of interchanging and always-changing relations and emotions.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Alex.
OTHERMALE:You're his big brother.
SUPMALE:You set a good example for him.
OTHERMALE:Mom, no, this is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:Show him! Okay, watch Alex, Andrew.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now the mama bird flies back to her nest.
SUPMALE:And the baby bird opens up his mouth so big Come on, Alex, open your mouth, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Open.
SUPMALE:Would you open your mouth, Alex! Hi, guys.
SUPMALE:I can't get either one of them to eat! Dad, we need a new mom.
OTHERMALE:This one's had it.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know what it means that we're brothers? It means that I have to do everything that you say.
LEADFEMALE:That's a big part of it, yep.
SUPFEMALE:If you want to fit in around here, Nick, you got to look like me, you got to act like me, you got to talk like me, you got to be another me.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'll do it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do it because I love Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you do it? All right, all right, okay, Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:I've tried to appeal to your sense of compassion.
SUPMALE:I have no other option.
LEADFEMALE:Ten dollars.
LEADMALE:$20.
LEADMALE:$12.
LEADFEMALE:$17.
LEADMALE:$14.
LEADFEMALE:50.
LEADFEMALE:$15.
LEADFEMALE:75.
SUPMALE:$15.
SUPFEMALE:25.
LEADFEMALE:$15.
OTHERMALE:50.
SUPFEMALE:Done.
SUPFEMALE:You guys are really something, you know that? You're a very special couple.
OTHERFEMALE:You do things together.
LEADFEMALE:You, you learn from each other, you share things.
LEADMALE:Common interests.
LEADMALE:You like being with each other.
LEADFEMALE:What's your secret? I never get my way.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know that I used to sit around just thinking about what it would be like if we got married? Married? Yeah! Yeah, I had the whole thing planned out.
LEADMALE:A-A big ceremony at night under a big tent.
LEADFEMALE:Like a circus? Exactly.
SUPMALE:But instead of walking down the aisle, I'd get shot out of a cannon toward the altar.
SUPMALE:And then, uh, we'd go on our honeymoon.
OTHERFEMALE:We'd go to Paris, where we'd spend our evenings dining alone on the banks of the Nile.
SUPMALE:Skippy the Nile's in London.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, if we've given Alex more freedom in his personal life, it's only because he's a boy and you're a girl! Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to hear the rest of that.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you just said that, Dad.
SUPMALE:Mal - Hang tough, hang tough.
OTHERFEMALE:Looking good.
SUPMALE:This is really nice.
OTHERMALE:Uh, you guys eat like this all the time? You mean with utensils? Ow! What is this?! I found it in the shower! That's generic-brand shampoo.
LEADMALE:It's family, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You can't escape it.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm hip.
SUPMALE:I'm cool.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a happening fool.
LEADFEMALE:I want to slow this thing down, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Going too fast.
LEADMALE:Yesterday Jennifer was two.
SUPFEMALE:Today she's 11.
SUPFEMALE:Alex is 18.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell's going on here? It's life.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what's going on here.
SUPMALE:I love you all so much.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
OTHERMALE:I love you.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:I love you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Alex loves me.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Dad.
LEADMALE:I love you more every day.
LEADMALE:I love you, too, Steven.
LEADMALE:Everything I care about, really, really, care about is in this house.
LEADMALE:Just think about how we just love each other.
LEADFEMALE:Just remember those things.
LEADFEMALE:We do.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Who's that? Uh, that's Dad's mother's mother, our great-grandmother.
OTHERFEMALE:She had real flabby arms.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, they're a nice match with the legs.
OTHERMALE:There's a nice-looking guy.
LEADFEMALE:Who's that? That's Vic Damone.
LEADMALE:His picture came with the album.
LEADMALE: Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look.
LEADMALE:"Mr.
LEADMALE:And Mrs.
LEADMALE:Charles Donnelly announce the wedding "of their daughter Elyse Katherine to Steven Richard Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:" Hey, Mom, look at your old wedding invitation.
SUPMALE:Steven, can you believe it?  I guess he can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Are you guys gonna have a party? Well, I'm working on it, but your father doesn't like to celebrate these things.
LEADFEMALE:Of course I do.
SUPFEMALE:I love to celebrate these things.
OTHERFEMALE:I just don't like big parties.
OTHERMALE:I happen to believe it's possible to have a celebration with, uh, fewer than a thousand people.
LEADMALE:You used to like big gatherings.
LEADMALE:Elyse, this is our anniversary, not the march on Washington.
SUPMALE: You know, actually, you already agreed to have a party.
SUPFEMALE:When did I agree? Last year.
LEADMALE:Don't you remember? Just the two of us had dinner together.
SUPFEMALE:Course I remember.
SUPFEMALE:It was very romantic.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this year, instead of romance, let's have fun.
OTHERMALE:You know what I mean.
LEADFEMALE:Let's face it, Dad, she wants a big party.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's our 20th; it's a big day.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I just feel there are a lot of people that I would like to share that with.
LEADMALE:Okay, Elyse, if you insist on having a party, I won't stand in your way.
LEADMALE:Sounds like a go to me.
OTHERFEMALE:This is so exciting.
OTHERFEMALE:You're going to love it, Steven.
SUPMALE:Where-where will we have the party? Anyplace you want is okay with me.
LEADFEMALE:You decide.
LEADMALE:I am thoroughly amenable.
LEADMALE:Uh, maybe we could get the banquet room at Guido's.
LEADMALE:Not Guido's.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with Guido's? N-nothing, no Guido's-Guido's is fine.
OTHERMALE:Okay, I'll keep it small and intimate, Steven, I promise.
LEADMALE:What, just a few other couples? Well, now, if we're going to rent a room and hire a band, I think, I think A band?! Okay, okay, a band is fine.
SUPFEMALE:I'll stay out of this.
LEADMALE:It sounds like fun, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Do you want me to call Guido's and reserve the room? No, that's okay.
LEADMALE:I already called them.
LEADFEMALE: - Hi, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:What's for dinner? You know, I thought we'd start out with some hors d'oeuvres rumaki, pigs in blankets, things like that and then chicken Florentine, zucchini, pastry, and coffee.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll have everything except the coffee.
LEADMALE:Let's eat.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I was talking about the party.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:And what are we having tonight? Tonight we're having Captain Barnacle's take-out fish balls.
LEADMALE:Again? Well, I hope they defrosted them this time.
LEADMALE: - Oh, hello, everybody.
SUPFEMALE: You did! - I did not.
LEADFEMALE:I know you did, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:You think you know I did, but I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, where are the fish balls? I couldn't start the car.
OTHERFEMALE:I had to leave it at work.
LEADFEMALE:I took the bus home.
LEADFEMALE:I'm soaked to the skin.
SUPMALE:I couldn't get the fish balls.
LEADMALE:Oh, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:You couldn't get the fish balls?! Let me run this by you again, Elyse.
SUPMALE:I couldn't start the car.
SUPMALE:Had to leave it at work.
LEADMALE:Took the bus home.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't get the fish balls.
LEADFEMALE:Say it with me, "I couldn't" - "I couldn't start" - 
LEADMALE:Dad! Dad, Alex has been reading my diary.
SUPFEMALE:I know because he's been using words and phrases that I use in it.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, that is not true.
LEADMALE:Her-her accusations are totally bogus and grody to the max.
LEADMALE:You see? He doesn't talk like that.
SUPMALE:Look, I didn't read her diary, okay? I went into her room to look for a book.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha! What would a book be doing in my room? She's got me there for sure.
SUPMALE:I really had my heart set on those fish balls.
SUPMALE:So, Mom, what is for dinner? Well, we've got some frozen waffles.
SUPMALE:Throw 'em in the toaster.
LEADFEMALE:I'd love to throw 'em in the toaster, but the toaster is broken.
SUPFEMALE:I have some gum in my room.
LEADMALE:That should hold me over till breakfast.
LEADMALE:Look, Steven, I-I've got to talk to you about the arrangements.
LEADMALE:Now, now, Guido's is all set for the party.
SUPFEMALE:Guido's? H Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Guido's, uh Guido's is fine.
SUPMALE:Whatever you do will be fine.
SUPFEMALE:Is it raining in here? Yes, it is! I thought we had that fixed.
LEADMALE:I did! I'll call the roofer.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Dad, you've got to talk to Alex.
OTHERMALE:About what? About reading my diary.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, read your sister's diary.
OTHERFEMALE: Dad! Look, I didn't read her stupid diary.
LEADMALE:How would you know my diary's stupid if you hadn't read it? Mallory, I don't have to stick my hand in water to know it's wet.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now, guys, the roofer can be here Wednesday after 3:00.
LEADFEMALE:Can anybody be here? - 
LEADMALE:I'm busy.
LEADMALE: Not me.
LEADMALE: I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I'll try to be here.
OTHERMALE:Steven, I-I've got to talk to you about these arrangements.
LEADMALE:Now, I've got the guest list here, and-and I That is the guest list? Why don't we use this guest list? Fewer people.
LEADMALE:I'll look through it.
SUPFEMALE:I bet you will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is gonna be a fun party.
LEADMALE:I'm really looking forward to it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, can you put something under this drip? You're a drip, Alex.
LEADMALE:Why don't you sit in it?! All right, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Bag your face.
LEADMALE:20 years, huh? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:It seems just like, uh 
OTHERFEMALE:Fifty.
LEADFEMALE: Yes Y-Yes I see.
LEADMALE:I understand you're very busy now, but uh, now is when our roof is leaking.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry we never call you when it's sunny.
SUPMALE: Wh-When can you come? A month from Thursday.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I-I appreciate your squeezing us in.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You're a saint.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Sorry I'm late.
SUPMALE:I stayed at the office to put the guest list through the computer.
LEADMALE:You forgot the roofer, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, I didn't.
SUPMALE:He's invited.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you weren't home when he got here.
LEADMALE:So what? So I forgot the roofer.
LEADFEMALE:So what?! So what? Have you been in the kitchen lately? - No.
SUPMALE:No? Take a dinghy.
LEADMALE:Steven, I had a hard day at work.
LEADFEMALE:Please, let's not get into a fight.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Sorry you had such a bad day.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it really wasn't such a bad day.
LEADFEMALE:I had lunch with Suzanne, and she and Ron are coming.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
SUPFEMALE:At least some of my friends will be there.
LEADMALE:Well, they can't get here till midnight, and they won't be able to stay very long.
LEADMALE:I also ran into, uh, Bernie Packer.
LEADMALE:Glad he's not invited.
LEADFEMALE:Well - Elyse! - Well, Suzanne assumed he was invited and mentioned it, so I had to invite him.
LEADMALE:He's a very sweet man.
LEADFEMALE:He was very helpful to my mother a couple years ago.
SUPMALE:In that case, why don't we take him in as a boarder? Elyse, the man is a buffoon.
LEADFEMALE:He's not a buffoon.
LEADMALE:He happens to have a very good sense of humor.
LEADMALE:Oh, is he? He's really funny.
LEADMALE:I especially like that noise he always makes.
LEADMALE:What noise?  That noise.
SUPFEMALE:I never noticed that noise.
OTHERMALE:How could you not notice ? I am aware of the positive things about Bernie.
LEADFEMALE: is the most positive thing about Bernie.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I feel like we're having some problems here.
LEADMALE:If you don't want Bernie to come to the party, he doesn't have to come to the party.
LEADMALE:We don't even have to have a party! We are having the party.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna miss my 20th anniversary because of you.
LEADFEMALE:You are having your 20th anniversary because of me! I-I'm having our 20th anniversary because of us.
LEADMALE:There wouldn't be any us if it weren't for me.
LEADMALE:Or me, so there.
LEADMALE: 
SUPMALE:Hello! 
SUPFEMALE:Bernie! Bernie Packer.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Say  for me.
SUPMALE:You're coming? Fabulous! Steven will be so happy.
LEADMALE:Till then, Bern.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Okay, Elyse, now all your friends are coming, including Bernie.
LEADFEMALE:Happy? Never happier.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've never been happier either.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm delirious with glee.
LEADFEMALE:Bernie Packer is coming to our party.
SUPMALE:How much delight could one man possibly stand? Will you stop putting down Bernie? - I am crazy about Bernie! - Well, you can just spend the whole evening with Bernie.
LEADFEMALE:You can just dance with Bernie and  Your brains out.
OTHERMALE: Mallory! - What are you doing in my room? - 
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing - in my room? Reading my diary? - 
OTHERMALE:No, I was - 
SUPFEMALE:Would you - 
LEADMALE:Will you shut up?! I don't want any more yelling in this house! Happy anniversary! Many happy returns! Alex, will you get over here, please? We've got to talk about Mom and Dad's present.
LEADMALE:Speaking of talking, Jennifer, did you know that Mallory is afraid to talk to Curt McMillan? Alex, the only way you would know that is if you read my diary.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
LEADMALE:He could've eavesdropped like I did ah Maybe this whole discussion is academic.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, the way they've been fighting, they're probably gonna call the party off.
LEADMALE:It is getting pretty rough.
LEADFEMALE:Now they're fighting about anything.
LEADFEMALE: This is my umbrella.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what you did with your stupid umbrella.
SUPMALE: You're right! It is a stupid umbrella! - You bought it for me! -  Sounds like it's tapering off.
LEADMALE: Better than that ridiculous rain hat - you bought me! -  Look, just on the off chance that they do make up, we have to get them a present.
OTHERMALE:Now, what do they need? They need a lawyer.
SUPMALE:I hope they make up.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to end up at some home for waifs.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, come on, what should we get them? Let's get 'em a new set of tires.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I've got a much better idea.
LEADFEMALE:We'll get them, uh, matching sweater and slacks outfits.
OTHERMALE:It'll be great.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mallory, we-we're shopping for our parents here, not Ken and Barbie.
LEADMALE:Alex, do you have to shoot down every good idea I have? Mallory, the day you get a good idea, let me know.
LEADMALE:I will! 
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Will you two stop fighting? We've got to work this out.
LEADFEMALE: - No, I disagree.
SUPFEMALE:I think we have a lot to learn from Einstein.
OTHERFEMALE:Talking about the anniversary, hmm? Is there still gonna be one? Why wouldn't there be one? Been looking all over the house for this.
LEADFEMALE:Look, there's no doubt in my mind they'll make up before the party tomorrow night.
SUPMALE:But if they don't, I'm calling a family meeting.
LEADMALE:This family meeting is hereby called to order.
LEADMALE:Will the secretary please read the minutes of the last meeting? You are the secretary, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:You're out of order.
LEADFEMALE:I know, I'm the secretary, Mallory.
SUPMALE:I'm just trying to be official here.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, you were about to read the minutes of the last meeting will you get to it, please? I, for one, want to hear them.
SUPMALE:You can't hear them.
LEADFEMALE:I was going to get to that.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I was reading them in the bathtub last night and well, the rest is history.
LEADFEMALE:The Chair recognizes Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:I would just like to point out that we're supposed to be at Guido's in 20 minutes.
OTHERMALE:If we do not proceed with this meeting, we'll all miss the party.
LEADFEMALE:Suits me fine.
LEADFEMALE:I have the floor you're out of order.
OTHERMALE:She's right, Dad, technically, you are out of order.
LEADMALE:Now you're out of order, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:How can I be out of order telling him he's out of order? You're out of order again.
LEADMALE:Listen, the whole purpose of this meeting is for us to discuss all the fighting that's been going on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tired of it.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
OTHERFEMALE:Me, too Alex, I don't see why you and your sister can't get along better.
SUPMALE:Pardon me for pointing it out, Mom, but you and Dad haven't exactly been Ozzie and Harriet.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look, uh, kids, we don't need a meeting like this.
LEADMALE:Your mother and I can settle our little differences ourselves.
LEADMALE:Really? The two of you haven't slept in the same room for the past three nights.
OTHERFEMALE:I haven't been tired.
LEADMALE:I don't like it when you guys fight.
LEADFEMALE:It's scary.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like you don't like each other.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, we don't mean to scare you.
LEADMALE:So, now, you're ready to make up? Uh, well, um, I-I I think the first thing that needs to happen here, um, procedurally speaking, is for Alex and Mallory to end their fight.
OTHERMALE:How about it? I will make up with Alex if he promises never to read my diary again.
SUPMALE:I didn't read it in the first place.
OTHERFEMALE:Prove it.
SUPMALE:For one thing, Mallory, it has a lock on it.
LEADMALE:How would you know? I, uh I've admired it from a distance.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bet! Okay, look, I promise, all right? You have to promise to stay away from my records.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry for all the names I called you.
LEADFEMALE:Likewise.
LEADFEMALE:Say, "I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:" 
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Louder.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Louder.
LEADMALE:Mallory! All right.
LEADMALE:Very, very nice.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, now, uh why don't the two of you shake hands and make up? That was very nice.
LEADFEMALE:Well, guess that takes care of everything.
SUPFEMALE:Not so fast! What about you and Dad making up? I'm willing, if he is.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:I consider us made up.
OTHERFEMALE:How about a hug? A handshake? It was a stupid fight.
SUPMALE:Very.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADMALE: We really should hurry.
SUPFEMALE:I told Bernie Packer we'd give him a ride to the party.
LEADFEMALE:Get him a mule.
LEADFEMALE:Steven! Elyse, you know I don't like the man! But it's raining! What was I going to do, tell him to take a bus? No, no, he can ride in our car.
LEADMALE:I'll take the bus! - Fine! - Okay! - Ooh! -  -  This meeting is called because of rain! 
SUPMALE:Aah!  You dance divinely, my dear.
SUPFEMALE:Likewise, I'm sure.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you wish there were some boys here? No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm very happy with you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Truly, we're blessed.
OTHERMALE:Whoa! Mom! Dad!  Perfect! That's a keeper.
SUPMALE:Congratulations! - Oh! - Oh! And my love to both of you on this day of days.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you, Chaim.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Chaim.
LEADFEMALE:I often say to Chaim, "Steven and Elyse due cuori che battono come uno.
LEADMALE:" "They have two hearts that beat as one.
LEADMALE:" Thank you, Akila.
LEADFEMALE: I never heard you say that, Akila.
LEADMALE: Whoa! Guys!  Perfect.
LEADMALE:That's a keeper.
SUPMALE: Brrr!  Guess who! That's a tough one.
OTHERMALE:Bernie Packer.
OTHERFEMALE: How'd you know? Golly, Steven, how many years has it been now eight, nine? Hey, Guido's, huh? Nice place.
LEADFEMALE:It's a lot like you, Steve luxury on a budget.
LEADFEMALE: So, what's for supper? Or, gee, was I supposed to bring a bag lunch? Brrr! Oh, there she is! There's the little bride! -  - Bernie, nice to see you! Aw, golly, golly, golly, this is just great, isn't it, guys? Tell you what.
LEADMALE:You two lucky kids you're going to spend a week that's seven days and five nights  at my condo on Lake Erie!  - Uh, Bernie - Oh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! It's just 'cause I love you, guy! Brrr! You know, Bernie, Steven doesn't like to let on, but he feels just the same way about you.
LEADFEMALE:Once in a while, he gets this faraway look in his eye, and and I say, "Sweetie, what is it?" And he said, "Elyse, I miss Bernie Packer.
OTHERMALE:"  Okay, uh, got to be out there somewhere.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are they? Yes, there they are.
LEADMALE:The anniversary couple and our hosts for the evening come on to the dance floor, Steve and Elyse the Keatons! Yay!  I'm surprised you wanted to dance with me.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't going to make a scene.
SUPMALE:That's sweet.
SUPFEMALE: "That's sweet.
SUPMALE:" Do you know this last week, living with you has not exactly been a trip to the beach! Speaking of the beach, we now have one in our kitchen, thanks to you-know-who.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh! Now I'm responsible for the rain?! Well, you're certainly not responsible for the sunshine.
SUPMALE:That's it, Steven! This dance is over! Good! Then get off my feet! Uh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate to break up the festivities, but, uh, if I could have your attention, my, uh my sisters and I would like to make a toast.
SUPMALE:they couldn't live without each other, and we're so glad they felt like that.
SUPMALE:When Shari Scharfer dumped me for the captain of the football team Dad taught me how to throw a spiral, and, uh, Mom taught me how to tackle.
LEADMALE:They took me ice skating and held me up when my ankles turned, and, uh Mom was seven months pregnant with Jennifer.
LEADMALE:When nobody would buy my Girl Scout cookies, Mom and Dad bought them all.
SUPFEMALE:They allowed the Young Republicans to meet at our house.
LEADFEMALE:Though they probably wanted to, they didn't say anything when, uh, Johnny Holmstead took me out.
LEADFEMALE:He has blue hair and an earring.
LEADFEMALE:But, uh, most important of all, the way they respect each other, the way they're open to each other's feelings and needs has, uh has taught us the values by which we live our lives.
OTHERMALE:And we love them.
LEADFEMALE: Mom, Dad ALL 
SUPMALE:Happy anniversary! - Speech! Speech, Steven! - Speech! Speech! Come on, Steven, say something.
OTHERMALE: Speech! Speech, Elyse! - Speech! Speech!  I'm embarrassed and proud at the same time.
OTHERMALE:Me, too.
OTHERFEMALE: Uh - I - You I-I think we should tell you that Steven and I have been fighting all week.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, we, uh we have been fighting about, uh, all kinds of things.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:About, uh, uh, the roof leaking, uh Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:The About, uh, this party.
LEADFEMALE: About, uh Brrr! Brrr! About everything.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Alex, Mallory and Jennifer for, uh for showing your mother and I how foolish we've been.
LEADMALE:I think we just forgot how much we care about each other.
SUPMALE:How much we need each other.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, too, Steven.
OTHERMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE: I love you, too.
LEADMALE:Happy anniversary.
LEADFEMALE:Happy anniversary! -  - Happy anniversary.
LEADMALE:Wait! Wait! No, it's not over.
LEADMALE:Hit it, boys!  Oh, how we danced On the night 
LEADMALE:We were wed We vowed our true love Though a word wasn't said.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:First batch is done.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy, these look great! This is the best batch of Christmas cookies to come out of the Keaton kitchen.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What's this one? Well, where did that come from? Alex made me do it.
LEADFEMALE:I think Alex gets a little too caught up in the Christmas spirit, don't you? Well, I don't know about him, but I sure do.
SUPFEMALE:Smell of cookies and hot cider and warm dollar signs.
LEADFEMALE:And Christmas carols! Hey.
SUPMALE:Uh I like the ha-ha-ha part.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.
OTHERFEMALE:The traditional end of fun has arrived.
LEADMALE:No, no, I mean, I love Christmas as much as the next guy.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't know how you can celebrate joyously when holiday retail sales are down by four percent.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, you got your annual card from the Reagans.
SUPMALE:"Dear Alex, how are we doing?" A card? That's it? I sent them jams and jellies.
LEADMALE:I got a Christmas card the other day from the Psychology Club of America.
LEADFEMALE:It said, "Have a well-adjusted Christmas, and a normal New Year.
LEADMALE:" Oh, listen, I'm gonna go over to Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Krewson's and place our order for a Christmas tree.
LEADMALE:Anybody want to come? Oh, Steven, I thought we agreed to go somewhere else for our tree this year.
OTHERMALE:Why? - Because, Dad, Mr.
SUPMALE:Krewson's trees are terrible.
SUPFEMALE:They look like hat racks.
LEADMALE:Look, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Krewson is one of the last remaining independent Christmas tree distributors in Ohio.
SUPFEMALE:It's our duty to keep guys like him in business.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I like Krewson's.
SUPFEMALE:Is-Isn't he the guy with the shack and those scrawny little dried-out dwarf trees? Well right, right.
LEADMALE:I always wondered who bought trees there.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you know.
LEADMALE:Look, I talked to Krewson, he said he'd get us a great tree this year.
LEADFEMALE:I want to give him a chance to come through.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, who's coming with me? I'll go, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:I would like to see trees that I'm taller than.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'll go with you too, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Well, that's very nice of you, Nick.
SUPMALE:Right in the tradition of brotherhood and good will towards men.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, I figured it was the least I could do, I mean, since I'm spending Christmas with you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah! What? - Happy, happy, everybody! - Hey, Skip.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I need a Christmas favor from you.
SUPFEMALE:You know how I usually play Santa Claus down at the mall? - Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Well, I got to get out of it.
LEADMALE:Why, you going out of town this year? No, I'm going to be the Abominable Snowman over at the Pearl Ridge Shopping Center.
OTHERFEMALE:It pays less, but it's a real career move for me.
LEADMALE:It helps round out my resume, and it gives me that in for that big Easter Bunny job I've been looking for.
LEADMALE:You want Alex to play Santa Claus? He'll traumatize an entire generation of young children.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:I got better things to do than say "Ho, ho, ho!" To a bunch of spoiled, greedy little kids.
LEADMALE:Pays $10 an hour.
OTHERFEMALE:Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now, we're forgetting about the finger paints.
SUPFEMALE:We're forgetting about the Lego set.
OTHERFEMALE:Instead Santa is gonna bring you Now, Santa invests heavily in this, and, uh ho, ho, ho! Santa has done very well.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Santa.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're welcome, honey.
SUPMALE:There you go.
SUPFEMALE:Merry Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:Bush in '88.
OTHERMALE:Okay, who's next? How are you this Christmas? I'm not talking to any elf.
LEADMALE:I want the big guy.
SUPMALE:Now, Eddie be nice.
SUPMALE:I'm always nice! Hey, Kringle, let's get this show on the road.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Eddie.
SUPMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
OTHERMALE:Okay, just sit right here and tell me what you want for Christmas.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, Santa, here we go.
SUPFEMALE:I want Whoa, whoa, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it Uh Okay, shoot.
SUPMALE:Okay, Santa, I want a fire truck, a baseball mitt, a train set, a robot, a bicycle, a record player no, make that a CD a personal computer, a basketball, an apartment in Manhattan Hey, wait a minute! I'm not done yet! Listen, kid, you don't need a Santa Claus, you need a business manager.
SUPMALE:Okay, Merry Christmas and good luck in the fiscal new year.
SUPMALE:I found that entire exchange heartwarming.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, Santa, are you still open? Ho, ho, ho! I hope your daughter's interested in the commodities market.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, honey, Santa wants to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERMALE:What's your name? Michelle Davies.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, what do you want for Christmas? - Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, honey.
LEADMALE:You can tell Santa what you want.
LEADFEMALE:But, Mommy, I told you I don't believe in Santa Claus.
SUPFEMALE:What?! What?! You don't believe in Santa Claus? Come here, come here.
LEADMALE:Let me tell you something, Michelle.
LEADFEMALE:I am definitely Santa Claus.
SUPMALE:If you're Santa Claus, why are there so many Santa Clauses at other malls? Well, uh, that's that's because, uh well, you see Elves, help me out on this.
OTHERMALE:Well, you well, you see, Santa is very busy Yeah, exactly! Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
SUPMALE:So, uh, uh, uh, I have some of my elves, uh, dress up like me to, uh, pick up the slack.
LEADFEMALE:It's-It's the same way that President Reagan can't be everywhere, so, uh, so he sends his assistants in his place.
LEADMALE:I don't believe in him, either.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, honey, you can tell Santa.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want for Christmas? - My daddy.
LEADMALE:I want my daddy home for Christmas.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, you know daddy can't come home this year for Christmas.
LEADMALE:Can you get me my daddy home for Christmas? Um Uh, look, uh, Michelle I'm-I'm sorry, but there are some things that even Santa Claus can't do.
LEADMALE:You're not Santa Claus.
LEADFEMALE:Can we go now, Mommy? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You want to take a look at this pretty tree first, huh? Look, look, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm, uh uh, usually the kids love me.
LEADMALE:No, that's okay, it's not your fault.
LEADMALE:You're not the first Santa she's done this to.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, what is it? It's the beard, right? The-the the suit? My "Ho, ho, ho's" getting on her nerves? I know they're getting on mine.
SUPMALE:Um, no, you see, Michelle's dad has to travel for business, and, uh, this year hasn't been so great.
LEADMALE:So he's had to take whatever he could get.
SUPFEMALE:Unfortunately, that means he has to be away for Christmas this year.
SUPFEMALE:That's too bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, um thanks, anyway, for trying.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hon, you ready? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:That was heartbreaking.
LEADFEMALE:The way she looked at me and said, "You're not Santa.
LEADMALE:" Alex, you're not Santa.
SUPMALE:You don't have to rub my nose in it.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not an elf, either, you know.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Look, the point is I mean, I got the suit, I've got the beard, I mean, I-I-I-I look like Santa.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like it's my responsibility to do something.
LEADMALE:Well, why don't you get on a sleigh and go to the North Pole? Well, you know, Alex, it's really great that you have such noble impulses.
SUPMALE:It'd be nice to see it more than once a year.
SUPFEMALE:Please, Jennifer, let's take all we can get.
LEADMALE:I don't know what you're making such a big deal about, Elyse! A tree is a tree.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, a tree that fits in your pocket is not a tree.
OTHERMALE:I don't think it's so bad.
LEADFEMALE:I can imagine the cry of "Timber" when that baby came down.
SUPMALE:Look, I know it's not perfect.
OTHERMALE:Not perfect? Dad, this is the first Christmas in history where the tree can go under the presents.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, can't you go to a regular Christmas tree lot this year, just this once? Oh, sure! Let's just patronize one of those faceless, impersonal, conformist lots.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Where all the trees - are tall and healthy.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I suppose you'd like one green and leafy, too.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes! We're ready to hang our stockings.
LEADMALE:Oh, great! Let's go.
SUPMALE:Hey, buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's mine.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, baby.
LEADMALE:While you guys were out, we made milk and cookies for Santa.
LEADFEMALE:Terrific.
LEADMALE:Where are they? In the stocking.
LEADMALE:What about yours, Alex? Oh, I don't know, Mom.
LEADMALE:I, uh I don't feel much like it this year.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Alex, it wouldn't be Christmas without your stocking.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:How was your first day at the mall? Will Christmas still be celebrated this year? Yeah, it was fine.
SUPFEMALE:It was it was fine.
LEADMALE:It was just this, um, this little girl.
LEADFEMALE:Michelle.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She's really cute, but really sad.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what's the problem with this little girl? Well, her father works, and can't be home for Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:She's seven years old and she doesn't even believe in Santa Claus.
SUPMALE:It just seemed so wrong to see someone unhappy at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:I feel completely helpless and I wish there was something I could do.
SUPFEMALE:Hiya.
LEADMALE:Ho, ho, ho, ho! Oh, great, a Method Santa.
LEADFEMALE:How's Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Claus? Thank you for asking.
SUPFEMALE:Ho, ho, ho! Well, she has a few sniffles, but then, she's at home and the elves are taking good care of her.
LEADFEMALE:Let's try and keep our sled in the real world here, pal, all right? Actually, I don't use a sled.
LEADMALE:I use a sleigh.
SUPMALE:And, uh, something else I would never use buttons like that.
LEADFEMALE:And that belt completely wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Where's your beard? It's in my locker.
OTHERFEMALE:Where'd you get yours, a garage sale? - Ow! - Ooh! - Whoa! Hey.
LEADMALE:How come you got a good beard? Where do you work, lawn furniture? No, I-I'm based up at the North Pole.
LEADMALE:I-I'm down here to do a little survey to see what the children would like.
SUPMALE:Beam me up, Scotty.
LEADFEMALE:Well! That briefcase is holding up rather well, isn't it? - What? - The briefcase.
SUPMALE:Uh, that was the Christmas of '73.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, it's holding up f - H-How do you know that? - I remember that year quite well.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see, you asked for that briefcase, a pocket calculator, and a pardon for Richard Nixon.
SUPMALE:You're good.
LEADMALE:That is good! Alex, uh, I know that up to this point, our relationship has been mostly financial.
OTHERMALE:But this year you've changed.
LEADMALE:Michelle has really touched you.
SUPFEMALE:And that's why I'm here.
LEADMALE:I'm on Candid Camera, right? I am.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come Hey, Allen Funt! I'm on to you! Come on, buddy! - Wh-Where It's in the pads, right? - Oh, ho, ho! Don't do that.
SUPFEMALE:It tickles, Alex! Ho, ho! And you know it's like a bowl of jelly ho, ho, ho! Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Look, this has got to stop, all right? Uh, what are you what are you trying to tell me, that you are Santa Claus? I'm-I'm really very happy that you decided to play me this year.
SUPMALE:I-I know that you're a little depressed because you haven't been able to help Michelle.
LEADFEMALE:But you're doing the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Don't underestimate the power of Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:It can work miracles.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I-I I don't know what to do.
LEADMALE:I mean, I-I don't know how to help Michelle.
SUPFEMALE:Trust your heart, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:My heart.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't used it in so long.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't say that.
LEADMALE:You're using it right now.
SUPMALE:Just keep at it.
SUPMALE:And don't forget good thoughts and good deeds don't go unrewarded.
SUPMALE:Alex, uh I really would like to help.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't see any chance of bringing you that Porsche this year.
LEADMALE:But I've been so good! Santa! Santa, where you been? All the kids are waiting.
LEADMALE:I just met the most incredible guy.
LEADMALE:What? - I ju I just I just met Santa Claus.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, Alex, this-this trying to show good will towards men has put you under quite a strain, hasn't it? Maybe you want to lie down, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer and I can take care of this.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, I can't lie down.
SUPMALE:I can't lie down.
SUPMALE:I'm too excited.
SUPMALE:Do you realize that it is Christmas? No, we're dressed like this all the time.
LEADMALE:Hey! Let's go, pal.
OTHERMALE:Let's get a move on.
LEADMALE:Easter's almost here! Come here, Eddie.
SUPMALE:Don't lay a hand on me.
LEADFEMALE:Jacoby & Meyers is right across the mall.
SUPFEMALE:Eddie, come here.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:Eddie what does Christmas mean to you? It means getting presents! All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:What if you had all the presents in the world and nobody to share them with? That would be great! I mean I mean, if your mom wasn't there t-to watch you open those presents and you didn't have any friends to show those presents to, and people weren't around caroling and spreading good cheer, would you really enjoy those presents? I guess I wouldn't be so happy without all those people.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:'Cause the important thing about Christmas isn't the presents, Eddie.
LEADMALE:It's being with the people that you love.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Santa.
SUPMALE:Mom, let's find another Santa.
LEADMALE:This guy's bringing me down.
LEADMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:Alex, that that was very sensitive, Alex.
LEADMALE:Are you feeling feverish? I I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't know, I just I feel very Christmasy.
SUPMALE:I j I feel like - Shh.
LEADMALE:I-I can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:I just I don't know what it is.
LEADFEMALE:I can't stop singing! Michelle! Michelle! Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi, remember me? With that suit, it's hard to forget.
LEADMALE:Listen, Michelle, I've got to own up.
SUPFEMALE:I'm-I'm not Santa Claus.
SUPMALE:I'm-I'm Alex Keaton.
LEADMALE:But I want you to know that there is a Santa Claus.
LEADMALE:And-and he really cares about you.
LEADMALE:Um, Michelle, you didn't get a candy cane last time you were here.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come over here and pick one out? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good idea, huh? - Listen, um, I, uh I hope I'm not out of line here, but, um I've I-I've been really concerned about your daughter.
LEADFEMALE:I don't hey, I don't know, it comes with the suit but, um, I was just wondering, have you heard anything from your husband? Uh, yeah, I talked to him yesterday, and he's, uh, definitely not gonna be able to make it home for Christmas tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:But, um if-if you and Michelle aren't doing anything tonight, I was wondering if you'd like to come over to our house.
LEADMALE:I mean, our family usually has a a party every Christmas Eve, and I know they'd love to meet you.
OTHERFEMALE:And I I have a feeling that this is gonna be a very special Christmas.
LEADMALE:Hey So! Another carol, anyone? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:We should sing a hymn to this beautiful tree Mr.
LEADMALE:Krewson brought us.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:All right, come on, let's look on the bright side.
LEADMALE:Which is? Nick? Well, uh, it's Christmas with kind of a Wild West theme, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think it's appropriate.
LEADFEMALE:I-I mean, you probably don't get much rain in here.
LEADMALE:Look I spoke to Mr.
OTHERMALE:Krewson.
SUPMALE:He promised we'd have a great tree here by tonight.
LEADMALE:I trust him.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:Y It's-it's Christmas.
LEADMALE:The tree isn't important, it What is, is that we're all together for the holiday.
LEADFEMALE:We can have a great Christmas with the worst tree in the world! We've done it for the last three years.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Skippy.
SUPFEMALE:How'd you know it was me? Most Abominable Snowmen wear contact lenses.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be scared, Andy.
LEADMALE:It's just me, Skippy.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I was terrified.
SUPFEMALE:It's almost time for bed, honey.
SUPFEMALE:I want to stay up and wait for Santa Claus.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey.

SUPMALE:Hi, I'm Alex.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:My name is Ray Davies.
SUPMALE:Daddy! Michelle! Ray? Wha - Wha Honey! I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? Uh, well, we met Alex, and Never mind that; what are you doing here? Well, I was in Fargo.
SUPMALE:It was a horrible night.
SUPMALE:I didn't make a single sale.
SUPMALE:I was on my way back to the motel so I could give you guys a call.
LEADMALE:When I got there, standing at my door was this great big barrel of a man with a white beard.
LEADFEMALE:And the most amazing thing happened he said he wanted to buy absolutely everything I had to sell.
SUPFEMALE:That's incredible, honey! I'm so proud of you! He handed me the money, and the only thing he asked me to do was deliver this package to Alex P.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:This is the best Christmas present in the world.
LEADMALE:What do you make of this? - Oh, uh, uh, I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I'm still in shock from having a decent tree.
LEADFEMALE:Who's that from, Alex? A friend.
LEADMALE:A friend.
LEADMALE:"Alex, if you're pure of heart, this should be as good as the real thing.
LEADFEMALE:" Hey, it's him! - It's him! - It really is! It's Santa Claus! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:No, no, see, this color's all wrong for you, Andy.
SUPMALE:You must stay away from green.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not promising anything.
SUPFEMALE:You are a winter person.
LEADMALE:Your colors are gray, blue, navy, azure.
LEADFEMALE:And you must stay away from plaids and avoid large prints whenever possible.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I came in here to eat.
OTHERMALE:Andy, I'm giving you a free color analysis.
LEADMALE:So? I don't even pick out my own clothes.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Is your dad home yet? - Hi, Mom.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Has he called? No, not yet.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Well, your father is down at the Columbus Community Playhouse.
LEADFEMALE:They are considering putting on a play he wrote, and I'm just kind of anxious to see what the decision is.
OTHERMALE:Really? What's it about? Well, it's a very autobiographical story about how we met and fell in love.
SUPFEMALE:There's some very nice moments from the '60s.
LEADMALE:A Draft Card for the Burning by Steven Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:"Oh my diamond in the rough from Buffalo, come let me love you.
LEADMALE:" Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I've-I've heard that before.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Oh! It's an old memory.
SUPFEMALE:It's an old, old memory.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm-I'm in my crib I'm-I'm tossing, I'm turning It's a nightmare.
LEADFEMALE:It's Dad's play.
OTHERFEMALE:It's alive! There's a chance that the Columbus Community Playhouse is gonna do it.
SUPMALE:They must be stopped.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it's nice that it might be produced again.
SUPFEMALE:You mean it's been produced before? Oh, yeah, when we were in college.
OTHERFEMALE:Your father directed and I had the lead the activist-anthropology student Sequoia Free.
LEADMALE: I'm telling you, the '60s were a joke.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, everyone was running around with these cartoon names.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't laugh if I were you.
LEADFEMALE:When you were a little baby, we called you "Moon Muffin.
OTHERFEMALE:" He looks like a little moon muffin, doesn't he? Yeah, well, it could have been worse.
SUPFEMALE:I could have been "Moon Muffin Free.
LEADFEMALE:" I remember you telling us about this play.
LEADMALE:Isn't it the one that almost broke you and Dad up? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It-it did almost break us up.
SUPMALE:Your father's whole personality just changed completely.
SUPMALE:He became insanely jealous about whoever played opposite me.
SUPFEMALE:He became extremely pompous and terribly theatrical.
SUPFEMALE: Yum-da-da, da-da-da, dum! "The Columbus Community Theatre is proud to announce "the Ohio debut of Steven Keaton's A Draft Card for the Burning.
LEADMALE:" Oh! Congratulations.
LEADMALE: Well, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's going to be the first in their "Undiscovered Playwrights of Ohio" series.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to direct it, and, Elyse, I want you to star in it.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's so sweet of you to think of me I can't.
SUPMALE:Why not? It'll be just like the old days.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I'm afraid of.
LEADMALE:I-I know there was a little tension the last time we worked together, but it's all in the past.
OTHERFEMALE:We're so much more mature now.
LEADMALE:Anyway, it's only going to play two days.
LEADMALE:Well, what two days do you have in mind? - Sunday and Monday.
LEADMALE:Oh, heartbreak! I'm not available.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even know which Sunday and Monday.
LEADMALE:Well, it-it doesn't really matter because I've just joined this group "Sundays and Mondays in Ohio.
LEADMALE:" 
LEADFEMALE:Well, um maybe we could move the play nights - to Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Don't do that, because "Sundays and Mondays" might be changing to "Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
LEADMALE:" Well, I'm certainly not going to beg you.
SUPMALE: I'm sure Shakespeare had his rejections.
SUPMALE: Probably not from his wife, but I'll find another leading actress.
OTHERFEMALE:This town must be full of Sequoia Frees.
SUPMALE:"We must turn back the tide of war.
SUPMALE:"Lay bare the kelp of poverty and greed.

LEADMALE:" 
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Very good.
LEADMALE:Very, very good! - Carol, we'll let you know.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Uh, Steven, I just want you to know that I've done a lot of classic theater from Ibsen to Shaw and back again.
LEADFEMALE:And the role of Sequoia Free in A Draft Card for the Burning is perhaps the most significant role written for a woman since Joan of Arc in Joan of Arc.
SUPMALE:I loved it too, Steve.
SUPMALE:The moment I read it.
SUPMALE:I was in my office, just kicking back, after finishing a root canal.
LEADMALE:I picked it up I picked it up and couldn't put it down.
OTHERFEMALE:It had fire! - It had a - Jeff! Jeff, please! You've already got the part.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I mean it.
LEADFEMALE:It just rolls off the tongue.
LEADMALE:"Kelp of poverty.
LEADMALE:" "Seashells of experience.
LEADFEMALE:" Do you like fish, Steve?  Hey, how's it going? It's tough, Alex.
LEADMALE:Why, Dad having trouble finding any actors for his play? No, it's been tough on me sitting here listening to all this.
LEADMALE:I'm starting to see past lives and envying them.
SUPFEMALE:That tough, huh? Have you read the whole play yet, Alex? No, nobody's read the whole play.
LEADMALE:Not even Dad.
SUPMALE:Why? Have you? I tried, but I, I kept blacking out.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, fine.
LEADMALE:If you just 
LEADMALE:Hey, Pop.
LEADFEMALE:Pop! Nice.
LEADFEMALE:I hear it's going like gangbusters.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, the material's certainly holding up.
LEADFEMALE:The trick is to find actors of the same caliber.
LEADFEMALE:That's gonna be tough, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:All right! Let's, uh, let's get on with it.
SUPMALE:Ready, Alice? - Okey dokey.
LEADFEMALE:Okay - 
LEADFEMALE:Exactly what he did.
LEADFEMALE:I told you he did - Shh.
OTHERMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh! I'm sorry, Steven, I didn't realize your auditions were still going on.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get out of your way.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Stay, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Stay and watch her butcher the dialogue meant to come only from your lips.
LEADFEMALE:Anytime, mon capitan.
LEADMALE:Okay, uh, Jeff, Alice, uh, let's-let's read a little.
LEADFEMALE:Have fun with it, and, um begin.
LEADFEMALE:"We must turn back the tide of war! "Uncover the kelp "of poverty and greed.
LEADFEMALE:"Lay bare "the seashells of human experience "of man's more peaceful nature "as the waves wash onto the shore of

LEADFEMALE:I have a full sense of your gift.
LEADMALE: Thank you.
LEADMALE:Yes, all right.
SUPFEMALE: Come again.
LEADFEMALE: Anyone else back there, Jen? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Let me go see.
LEADFEMALE:All right, let's knock it off, then, Jeff.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you know how much I love this? Jeff, you've got the job, I swear! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh!  -  - How'd it go, Dad? Any luck? Rough afternoon, Mal.
SUPMALE:Rough.
LEADMALE:Very discouraging.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:It's still early.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, we're kidding ourselves.
SUPFEMALE:Your mother's the only one who can play Sequoia Free! We might as well not do it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Dad.
OTHERMALE:There's got to be someone else.
SUPMALE:No, no! There's no one! I wrote it for you, only for you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's our it's our life, Elyse, our passion.
LEADMALE:And if you can't find it in your heart to be my Sequoia Free, well, I say forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:Let A Draft Card for the Burning die a proper death.
LEADMALE:Oh, my diamond in the rough from Buffalo come let me love you.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, two performances starting Saturday night.
LEADMALE:You want six tickets? May I ask why? I mean, where? Okay, they'll be held at the door for you.
LEADFEMALE:Six tickets, front row, center.
OTHERFEMALE:That'll be, uh $1.
LEADFEMALE:50.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, six more reservations, Andy.
OTHERMALE:How many does that give us? Eleven.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going, fellow siblings? Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are the Lunts? They're in there rehearsing.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think, Alex? It's Mom's dress for the play.
LEADFEMALE:That's not her dress.
LEADMALE:That's her handkerchief.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, Sequoia Free is a high-spirited, unconventional woman of the '60s.
LEADMALE:This is an extension of her fantasy life.
LEADMALE:Sequoia Free is your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? She does not have a fantasy life.
LEADFEMALE:And she's not going to be wearing this as long as "Alex Free" is alive.
SUPMALE:Elyse! How can you make such a big deal about this? Because already it's getting out of control.
OTHERFEMALE:How can you say that? Steven, maybe you aren't even aware of it, but every time Jeff comes near me, you start acting more like a jealous husband than a director.
SUPMALE:Jeff? You call him Jeff?  Isn't that a little familiar? His name is Dr.
LEADMALE:Cooper.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mom, I'm done.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? - Oh, that's wonderful.
LEADMALE:What's that? Oh, this is for me in the sit-in scene in the second act.
LEADMALE:Why do you need a handkerchief? This isn't a handkerchief, Steven, this is a dress.
SUPMALE:And it reflects the era.
LEADMALE:Elyse, the-the '60s was a time of decorum.
LEADMALE:Of-Of prim and proper behavior, as I remember.
SUPMALE:People wore these, kind of, high-necked dresses.
LEADFEMALE:You know, right up right up to the eyes.
LEADMALE:We're ready in there, Admiral.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Elyse! You gonna wear that? It's no bigger than a handkerchief! Fabulous! Your job's hanging by a thread, Jeff.
LEADFEMALE:I love your dialogue, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:All right! This is the big sit-in scene in the dean's office.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll take it from your speech, Elyse, at the top of page, uh, 311.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Randolph your courage is courageous, outrageous and contagious.
SUPFEMALE:I'm all three of those, Sequoia.
LEADMALE:Let them come.
LEADFEMALE:Let them take us away! At least we'll be together.
LEADMALE: Okay, hold it! What is it, Steve? The kiss was too much! Don't-Don't dwell on it.
SUPMALE:Uh, make it incidental a throwaway.
LEADMALE:What what the well, look at this stage direction, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:"With the heat of love burning in his heart, Randolph sweeps Sequoia into a passionate embrace.
LEADFEMALE:" That's a throwaway? It's a matter of interpretation.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? Hm I think Randolph's worn out.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Too-too tired and emotionally drained to do much more than shake hands with Sequoia.
SUPMALE:I-I-I wouldn't even go that far.
OTHERMALE:Make it a high five.
LEADFEMALE:A high five? That doesn't seem right.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeff, you're a dentist.
LEADMALE:What do you know about art? Your area is pain.
LEADFEMALE:I-I have to agree with Jeff, honey.
LEADMALE:Oh, do you, Sequoia? Well, when-when a man says, uh, "Sequoia, darling, I love you with all my heart.
SUPFEMALE:Come to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm on fire" Well, people expect them to kiss, you know, not-not just give a high five.
SUPMALE:Oh, fine.
SUPFEMALE:Let's just give the people what they expect.
SUPMALE:Let's just give them what they're used to.
LEADMALE:"I love you.
LEADFEMALE:" Kiss.
LEADFEMALE:"I love you.
LEADMALE:" Kiss.
LEADMALE:You've seen it a million times.
LEADFEMALE:"I love you.
LEADFEMALE:" High five.
LEADMALE:Now that's something new something different.
SUPMALE:Look, I'm the director.
LEADFEMALE:I say the kiss does not work.
LEADMALE:Now, let's please get on with it.
LEADMALE:Let's take it from here.
LEADMALE:And, Jeff, please, keep your lips to yourself.
LEADFEMALE: Five minutes, everybody! Five minutes! Four minutes, 55 seconds.
SUPFEMALE:Four, 50.
OTHERMALE:Four, 49.
LEADFEMALE:Ah! Whoa.
LEADMALE:Ah, it's just a play.
SUPMALE:It's just I keep telling myself.
LEADMALE:It's just a play.
SUPFEMALE:Dad? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, well, what do you think of the outfit? Oh, it's a gas! The amazing thing is, this is my own.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you wore that stuff in the '60s? No, this is what I wear now.
LEADMALE:I was really straight in the '60s.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Je - You nervous? - Oh! It's in your hands now, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Yours and and Oscar's and Jeff's.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am I nervous.
LEADMALE:Brings back a lot of memories, doesn't it? - Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:So long ago.
LEADMALE:Our opening night.
LEADFEMALE:Also our closing night.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so glad you decided to do this play.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, you are Sequoia Free.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Now and forever.
SUPMALE:Break a leg, honey.
LEADMALE:Thanks, baby.
OTHERMALE: The Columbus Community Playhouse proudly presents the Midwest premiere of A Draft Card for the Burning by Stephan Micel Keaton.
LEADMALE:Who is Stephan Micel Keaton? Who do you think? I'm afraid those are the final demands, Dean Hutchinson.
OTHERMALE:We are not going to budge until you agree to meet us here, in person.
LEADMALE:Oh, Randolph, how can one man be so wonderful and so perfect? It's a question I often ask myself.

LEADFEMALE:I didn't see you trying to fight her off.
LEADFEMALE:When a beautiful woman kisses Randolph, he kisses back.
LEADFEMALE:Randolph is a man of passion.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me who Randolph is! He's me! He is you, Steven! So why don't you play him? Now, I've got an office full of patients waiting.
SUPFEMALE:Fine! I will! Fine! And when I run out of anesthesia, I'll just read them your play.
LEADMALE:I have to side with Jeff on this, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:He's my dentist.
LEADMALE:Fine! Why don't you go with him? You can help him do some fillings! Steve, this is uncalled for.
SUPFEMALE:My parents are in the audience.
LEADFEMALE:I-I don't want to have to wake them up and tell them I'm not in the show.
SUPMALE:You're out, Good-Vibes.
SUPMALE:If-if they go, I'm-I'm going.

OTHERFEMALE:I'm stepping in.
LEADMALE:Just improvise.
LEADFEMALE:So, Sequoia enjoying the '60s? The chief of police couldn't come, so he told me to tell you that you're all under arrest.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, thank you friend of the chief.
OTHERMALE:Um but we're not afraid.
LEADMALE:Because any moment now, Peter Good-Vibes will be coming through that door with word from the administration.
SUPFEMALE:Yes! Where could Peter be? Well, you know Good-Vibes.
SUPMALE:He works in strange ways.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, but you can't question his vibes.

LEADMALE:And I, Peter Good-Vibes, am going to apply to business school.

SUPMALE:Can I join you? I guess, every 25 years, I have to make a fool of myself.
LEADFEMALE:That's not so.
OTHERFEMALE:It's only been 23 years.
LEADMALE:Well, this is it, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Draft Card goes back into the drawer.
SUPFEMALE:Alex will be so happy.
SUPFEMALE:It's not a good play, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I have to face that.
LEADFEMALE:It's a lovely play in spots.
SUPFEMALE:But you-you cut 100, 150 pages out of that sucker, and it will fly.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I put you through this, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Can you forgive me? Just promise me I won't have to do it again when I'm 70.
LEADFEMALE:You know, uh I really didn't need 350 pages to say what I needed to say.
SUPMALE:All I needed was one

LEADFEMALE:The art show starts today, and I'm exhibiting.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What do you got for the lucky art lovers today? No, show them, honey.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:So, what is it, Nick self-portrait? It's called The Spirit of Columbus.
LEADMALE:You see, it symbolizes the classic beauty of the city.
LEADMALE:The, uh, the steel and iron here stand for the river, and the aluminum here stands for the hope and yearning for hope and yearning.
LEADMALE:I don't get it, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:That's what separates us.
LEADFEMALE:You know, that's the difference between us.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:That and about four truckloads of functioning brain matter.
SUPMALE:Well, I think it's sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, thanks.
LEADMALE:And, uh, you know, the money I get from it will, uh, help build up our nest egg.
SUPFEMALE:N-Nick-Nick, what? What do you need a nest egg for? You're young! You should be footloose and fancy-free, visiting foreign ports Mexico, China other planets.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, Ms.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, Mal and I are starting to get kind of serious, and, you know, we've even been thinking about maybe getting Nick! Please! Andy we love you very much, but I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:We've decided to raise our children as human beings.
LEADFEMALE:Now, when you're older, you can make your own choice.
LEADMALE:But right now, you're only six.
LEADFEMALE:In dog years, I'm 42.
OTHERMALE:In dog years, I'm 287.
LEADFEMALE:And your mother here is 304 Although she doesn't look a day over 150.
SUPMALE:It's something different with every kid, isn't it? I don't know, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Maybe we shouldn't fight it.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should just teach him some tricks and show him off to guests.
OTHERMALE:Ta-da! We did it! W-Where's the sculpture? I sold it for $200.
SUPFEMALE:The nest egg lives.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:So, uh, Nick, that, uh, money must be burning quite a hole in your pocket, huh? No, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:It's going to go into the bank, into our account.
SUPFEMALE:It's the beginning of our nest egg.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Time for his walk.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hey! - Hi.
SUPMALE:How come you guys are so happy? Cartoon festival on TV tonight? No, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:We sold Nick's sculpture.
OTHERFEMALE:You what?! Fact is, I could have sold five of 'em.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Yep, look at this.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and the, uh, parts cost me 20.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, you know, I think I probably made a profit.
LEADFEMALE:I think you probably did.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:If you borrow one from the nine Nick, Nick, that is a profit margin of 900%.
LEADMALE:I-I've got a whole new appreciation for art.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, wait, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:Nick, did you say you had five other customers? And you didn't take any orders? Well, I don't see how I could.
LEADMALE:There was only one statue, Alex.
OTHERMALE:I mean, what are they teaching at that college? Nick, you've got four other people who are willing to pay you for The Spirit of Columbus, right? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well I think your next step is obvious.
LEADFEMALE:What is that? You make four other statues, and you sell them to those people.
LEADMALE:Aw, no, I wouldn't want to do that.
LEADMALE:You know, I don't work that way.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I like to look at each piece as a, uh, separate, uh, artistic expression, you know? Oh, grow up! Come on, you think Michelangelo was alive today, he wouldn't be on his back cranking out Sistine Chapel ceilings by the dozens? Well, Alex, I think Nick has a point.
SUPFEMALE:It's-it's a question of artistic conscience.
SUPMALE:The Spirit of Columbus is a one-of-a-kind.
SUPFEMALE:I-I know.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what I love about it! It's one-of-a-kind.
SUPFEMALE:We can sell millions of 'em! - Eh, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Nick.
LEADFEMALE:Nick.
LEADMALE:Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, listen.
LEADFEMALE:You really care about Mal, right? Sure.
SUPMALE:Now, as far as economics goes, Mal may not know much about supply, but she is definitely an expert on demand.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Alex.
LEADMALE:Mallory is the ideal consumer.
SUPFEMALE:Well So you have to be the ideal provider just to keep up with her.
LEADMALE:Fortunately, I am the ideal manager.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I know what you're trying to do.
SUPMALE:You want to take Nick's artistic gift and-and commercialize it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes! This is a big step for me.
LEADMALE:Listen, guys, I I really want you to get your nest egg going.
LEADMALE:Now, Nick, I only want what's best for you.
OTHERMALE:Mal, I only want what's best for you.
LEADFEMALE:And, guys, I only want 25% for me.
OTHERMALE:Okay, Nick, here you go.
LEADFEMALE:I think we got everything you need.
LEADFEMALE:We got light, we got tools.
LEADFEMALE:You're in a garage.
LEADMALE:You're as happy as you can get.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, pal, create.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you at 5:00.
LEADMALE:Nick, you're not creating.
SUPFEMALE:What's the problem? It's not how it works, Alex.
LEADMALE:You know, uh, I got to get the right feeling going, I got to be in the right mood.
LEADMALE:Nick, you got to make it takes me a month to do one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then, uh, you better pick up the pace.
LEADMALE:Why do I have to do 35? Well, because, Nick, uh, we're having a sale.
LEADFEMALE:See? "Nick Moore, renowned local artist, "offers a limited issue of his famous sculpture, The Spirit of Blank.
LEADMALE:" Alex, it's not called The Spirit of Blank.
OTHERMALE:It's called The Spirit of Columbus.
LEADMALE:Well, y-yeah, sure it is, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:Sure it is, sure it is.
OTHERFEMALE:And-and when someone from Columbus wants to buy it, well, gosh darn it, that's what we're going to call it.
SUPMALE:But if someone from Philadelphia wants to buy it, we're going to call it The Spirit of Philadelphia.
LEADFEMALE:Someone from Hong Kong, we'll call it The Spirit of Hong Kong.
LEADMALE:Someone from Toledo, The Spirit of Toledo.
SUPFEMALE:Stop me when you understand this, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, keep going.
OTHERMALE:Wherever there are people with spirit, and $200 in their wallet, we got something for their mantle.
SUPMALE:What? The Spirit of Blank.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Alex.
LEADMALE:You know, I can't work that way.
LEADMALE:Um, I-I can't make 'em that fast.
LEADMALE:All right, we'll slow down.
LEADMALE:We'll slow down.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, it's the first day.
LEADMALE:Take it easy.
LEADMALE:Only do 30.
OTHERMALE:That's not how an artist works.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, Nick, have a seat.
SUPMALE:Do you think Do you think Leonardo da Vinci only did one painting a day? Uh-uh.
LEADMALE:On the day he did the Mona Lisa, he did three other paintings.
LEADFEMALE:Mona Beth.
SUPFEMALE:Mona Cathy.
LEADMALE:And my personal favorite, Mona Mona.
LEADMALE:Bad news, Alex.
LEADMALE:We've been to every junkyard in town, and these are the last of the parts.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's not going to be a problem.
LEADFEMALE:See, I got a deal in a place with this guy up in Akron.
SUPFEMALE:He's just going to fabricate the parts and ship 'em down to us.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, h-hey, then they, uh, won't be the real thing.
LEADMALE:You know, I kind of like to work with the original parts.
LEADMALE:Nick, you're already Let's not get caught up in technicalities.
LEADFEMALE:It's not a technicality, Alex.
SUPMALE:The material an artist uses are-are the very essence of his craft.
SUPFEMALE:They influence the way he works, the way he sees the world, and finally, the way his vision fulfills itself.
LEADFEMALE:Mal, the man glues together hubcaps.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:If you think it's that easy, Alex, then why don't you do it? Yeah, all right, Nick, all right, I'll get you started.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Jen, give me a hand with this, okay? We're going to do six bottoms.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you mean the base.
LEADMALE:Base, bottom.
SUPFEMALE:Tomato, "tom-ah-to.
LEADFEMALE:" It's junk.
LEADFEMALE:Who cares? Uh, no, Alex, Alex, that's not the way it goes.
LEADMALE:What? All right.
SUPFEMALE:Geez.
LEADMALE:Jen.
SUPFEMALE:Ms.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Nick.
LEADMALE:You haven't seen Alex around, have you? No.
LEADMALE:Why are you whispering? He is watching me, every minute.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm supposed to be working right now.
SUPMALE:I need a rest.
LEADFEMALE:And my next break is not coming up till February.
LEADMALE:You really been working hard, haven't you? Ms.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, um you're an artistic type and everything.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you, uh, design houses, you draw blueprints, you're an architect.
SUPFEMALE:I know what I do.
LEADMALE:I guess what I am getting at here is, in a lot of ways, you and I are the same.
SUPMALE:I mean, I'm a guy and I got a different name, but otherwise we got a lot of things in common.
OTHERMALE:And, I mean, in a lot of ways, I think you're the only one that can really understand what I'm going through.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even understand what you're talking about.
SUPFEMALE:I am making all these Spirits of Blank, and for some reason they feel impersonal.
OTHERMALE:I am not enjoying it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why are you sticking with it then? Nick? Nick.
LEADMALE:Eight more orders came in today.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great.
OTHERFEMALE:Spirit of New York, Spirit of Miami.
LEADMALE:The nest egg's looking awfully good.
OTHERMALE:I'm so excited.
LEADFEMALE:You're asking me why I'm doing it, and that's why.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's because of Mal.
LEADFEMALE:It's for the nest egg.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Nick! Nick! What are you doing out of the garage, Nick? Is it February already? Alex, I-I just wanted to take a little break.
SUPFEMALE:Nick, how many Spirits of Blank have you done today? Oh, about 15.
LEADMALE:Look, you see, I-I got a little held up.
SUPMALE:There was this little twist I - No.
SUPMALE:Nick, Nick, when I want a twist, I'll call Chubby Checker.
SUPMALE:What I want from you is art, okay? Over and over again.
OTHERMALE:Art, art and more art.
LEADFEMALE:All right? Th-That's what makes a great 
SUPMALE:Volume.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I, uh, I forgot.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, uh, I'll see you in February.
OTHERFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:So, things are going pretty well, huh? Oh, Mom, it's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, people are snapping these things up by the bushel.
OTHERMALE:I mean, suddenly, art has meaning.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I can't believe the way people are gobbling up these sculptures, Mom.
SUPMALE:And they can make their own, you know, just by driving their car into a wall.
OTHERMALE:Probably half the price I'm charging 'em.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I-I think you have to go carefully here.
SUPMALE:I mean, to you, money is all that's important, that's all that matters.
LEADFEMALE:But-but I'm not so sure about Nick.
LEADMALE:Mom, I'm not totally blind.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I-I see what's going on here.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Nick is working very hard, and he feels that his artistic integrity is being violated.
SUPMALE:I am just looking out for his future and, in turn, your daughter's future.
LEADMALE:I just don't see how a married couple can live on-on the $76 a year he's averaged up to this point.
LEADMALE:That's before taxes, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:But-but Nick is an artist.
LEADMALE:He's a very sensitive young man.
OTHERMALE:Mom, they may get married.
SUPFEMALE:We have to face that.
SUPFEMALE:And if Nick doesn't make any money, they're going to be living in this house with you.
OTHERMALE:You get out there and you get him working.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to see Nick until February.
LEADMALE:Nick! Pretty remarkable, isn't it, sir? I'll say.
LEADFEMALE:What do you call this one? Where are you from, sir? Seattle.
LEADFEMALE:Incredible! Yeah, I mean, that's what this piece is called, uh, The Spirit of Seattle.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll take it.
SUPMALE:Congratulations, sir, congratulations.
LEADMALE:And, uh, sir, just between you and me, I think you're getting the pick of the litter.
OTHERFEMALE:Nick.
SUPFEMALE:Nick, isn't that great? Alex just made another sale.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:That makes almost $800 just from tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:He may be annoying, but he sure can sell.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations.
SUPMALE:Seems you've got a smash.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Mom.
OTHERMALE:I guess this is, uh, really adding to the old nest eh nest eh nest eh egg.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mom, what do you think? One left.
LEADMALE:Spirit of Elyse? I'll give you that special one percent family discount.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think so, Alex.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Hey, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? - Picture of Jacques Cousteau on the top? - We'll call it The Spirit of PBS.
LEADMALE:Hey, partner! Hey! - Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think? I don't know, Alex.
LEADMALE:You know, The Spirit of Columbus used to mean something special to me, but for now, for some reason, it's, uh, lost all its beauty somehow.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, hey.
LEADMALE:I never liked it.
OTHERMALE:You don't, you don't see me bailing out, do you? We got customers here, Nick.
SUPMALE:Uh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:If you have any questions, may I direct you to the artist, Mr.
LEADMALE:Nick Moore.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, Bill, wouldn't this be wonderful in the living room? Don't you think it would clash with the drapes? Oh, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Could we get this in blue? Blue? Uh, you know, I never really thought of it in blue.
SUPMALE:Yeah, see, madam, changing the color Would-would make it absolutely beautiful! Uh, how many of these would you like, ma'am? Alex, what are you doing? You can't, you can't change this; this is Nick's art.
LEADFEMALE:Mal - It's exactly the way Nick envisioned it.
LEADFEMALE:Mal, the customer is always right, okay? Especially when the customer is willing to shell out $250.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, Alex, uh Nick, what are you doing? It's your work! Either they take it the way it is - or they don't take it at all.
LEADMALE:Look, Mal, if we don't sell these things, we don't get money, and then we won't have our nest egg.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, this is your art.
LEADFEMALE:It's more important than a few dollars.
SUPMALE:This is not making you happy.
LEADFEMALE:And if you're not happy, then I'm not going to be happy.
LEADMALE:Do you have this in a medium? I suppose we could take it in for you, sir.
OTHERMALE:No, no, wait! Alex! No.
OTHERMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:You know, uh, this is the way it is, period.
LEADFEMALE:The way I made it.
SUPMALE:You know, it doesn't come in medium, it doesn't come in extra large, and it doesn't come in blue.
OTHERFEMALE:Does it come in beige? - Ooh! Uh I Hey, Nick It's over, Alex.
LEADMALE:Don't say anything.
SUPFEMALE:Nick, how can it be over? We are making a lot of money here.
LEADFEMALE:So what? You know, money is not everything.
OTHERMALE:Shh, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:You don't know what you're saying, now.
LEADFEMALE:You're a little tired, okay? Maybe you've been working too hard.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:That is not it.
LEADMALE:Nick, I'll tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:You know, y-you know that time off I was promising you in February? Well, Nick, take it now.
SUPMALE:It's over, Alex.
LEADMALE:It's over, it's over, it's over.
LEADMALE:What-what are you trying to tell me, Nick? It's no use.
LEADFEMALE:You don't understand a word I'm saying.
SUPFEMALE:I can be understanding, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:I can.
LEADMALE:I can be understanding.
LEADFEMALE:Try me, okay? Try me.
SUPFEMALE:I will understand.
SUPMALE:Okay, it's like this.
SUPMALE:All this, uh, mass production stuff that you want to do, that's not art.
OTHERFEMALE:Every time I do a new sculpture, I want to feel like it's something new, like I'm exploring a new world.
SUPFEMALE:And your way doesn't let me explore.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't let me be me.
LEADMALE:I don't understand, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it.
LEADMALE:I-I'm trying to.
SUPFEMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:I real I want to.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I can see that you mean it.
OTHERMALE:You're speaking in complete sentences.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I grew up in a very tough neighborhood.
OTHERFEMALE:Most of the guys I hung out with, they're still just hanging out.
OTHERMALE:And the only time you hear about 'em is when they done something bad.
OTHERFEMALE:So how come I didn't wind up like them, huh? How come I feel like getting up every morning? How come such a wonderful girl like Mal sees something special in me? That's a question we've all asked ourselves.
SUPMALE:It is because of the art, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Every time I create a new sculpture, I get this thrill that I am creating something that nobody ever thought of before.
OTHERMALE:Me, Nick Moore, from the bad part of town.
LEADMALE:When you start turning my sculptures out by the hundreds, you take that away.
OTHERFEMALE:When you start changing my-my sculptures around to match some lady's drapes, you take that away.
LEADFEMALE:You take away everything I live for.
LEADFEMALE:If you if you get one thrill from one Spirit of Columbus, why not turn out a hundred identical thrills a week? They are not identical.
LEADFEMALE:They're not the same.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:All right, listen.
SUPFEMALE:Let me try to make this simple for you.
SUPFEMALE:Would you, Nick? Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:It's like, um no two fingerprints are the same.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And? It's like, uh, no two snowflakes are alike.
OTHERFEMALE:So, no two snowflakes are alike.
LEADMALE:So what? That's what makes 'em special that they're unique.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, it's just like no two dollar bills are alike.
SUPFEMALE:Ah! Ah.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:That's-that's, uh See, they got different serial numbers, they come from a different mint.
LEADFEMALE:Well.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, you see, just as the See? The way you feel about money, that's the same way I feel about a new sculpture.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is amazing.
LEADMALE:Uh you and I are a lot alike.
LEADFEMALE:I bet in your mind that's a compliment, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, we both have commitment, you know? We both, we both have to do what it is that we do best.
LEADMALE:Y-You're not going to believe this, Nick, but we're both artists.
SUPMALE:I mean, uh, uh, you're an artist with your hands, and I'm an artist with my mind, but we both create.
LEADFEMALE:And-and and we're both tremendously passionate.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're a passionate guy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm-I'm a passionate guy.
LEADMALE:Stay where you are, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Y-You know what I mean.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, your-your palette is-is metal and wire and-and paint.
LEADFEMALE:Mine is dollar signs and decimal points and deals.
LEADFEMALE:But it's the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:We-we both create our own kind of magic.
SUPMALE:Alex, is this what, uh, Phil Donahue would call "a bonding moment"? I don't, I don't know, Nick.
OTHERMALE:Uh, how do you feel about that? Uh, yeah, I guess it is.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it is.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:But if I can have that beautiful statue in beige, I'll take seven.
OTHERMALE:Uh, ma'am, um, let me, let me, uh, let me tell you a little something about art.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You know how each dollar bill is unique? In fact, do you have a-a couple of bucks? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:What would we do, baby, without us? And there ain't no nothing we can't love each other through What would we do, baby, without us? This is WLEL, voice of Leland University, and you're listening to Syncopated Money.

SUPMALE:Alex, having you as a brother is all I need to know about the blues.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Alex.
LEADMALE:Here's all our old college stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever old blues albums we have would be in here.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:This is great.
SUPMALE:Oh, look at this old term paper.
LEADMALE:"Flower 
OTHERFEMALE:An Alternative to Hydro-Electric Power.
SUPFEMALE:" Oh, yeah, I remember that.
LEADFEMALE:That was the project to see if we could light the city of Berkeley exclusively through geranium friction.
OTHERFEMALE:How'd that turn out? At best, it's a backup.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, here's an old Eddie Dupre album.
SUPMALE:Eddie Dupre at the Monterey Blues Festival.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:"Perhaps the highlight of the festival was Dupre's classic "rendition of 'Keys to the Highway', in which he showed why many consider him to be the King of the Delta Blues.
LEADFEMALE:" It's hard to believe that such a great musician could just disappear from the music scene.
LEADMALE:None of these guys owned the publishing rights to their song.
SUPFEMALE:They'd come in, make-make a record, uh, get some lunch if they were lucky.
OTHERMALE:Maybe 50 bucks for the day somebody else got rich.
OTHERFEMALE:What about the videos? Didn't they own the rights to those? Mal, Mal, this is before videos.
LEADFEMALE:Before videos? Then what did they show on MTV? The same thing that's in your head, Mal.

SUPMALE:My sisters, Mallory and Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Dupre, there's something I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:That's the standard opening to any remark she's likely to make.
LEADMALE:No, it's about these "blues" you keep referring to.
LEADFEMALE:What exactly are you blue about? Little lady, personally, I'm not blue about anything.
LEADFEMALE:These blues are like a pain.
LEADFEMALE:Pain that a man has when his woman leaves him.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's the blues, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, "Lead Belly" Keaton.
LEADMALE:Uh, Mr.
SUPMALE:Dupre, listen.
LEADMALE:I-I thought maybe when you came on the show, what I'd like to do is-is talk a little bit about your roots.

I was 12 years old down in Statesboro, Georgia, where I was living at when McPhail's Medicine Show come through the town, selling some medicine out of a bottle they said that was good for rheumatic pain, pneumonia and anything that ails you.
LEADMALE:They had a little show that drawed the crowd around and they hired me for five cents a day.
SUPFEMALE:And all the medicine I could use.
LEADMALE:I'll sing a little song.
SUPMALE:Give me the guitar.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Show you how I did it.
SUPMALE:It was something like this.
LEADFEMALE:Did you ever hear the blues On a battered old guitar? Did you ever hear the blues Over yonder, Lord, so far? Did you ever hear the blues On a Saturday night? Worrying about some chick Didn't treat you right People Did you ever Hear the blues? - Oh, whoa.

LEADMALE:You are a natural-born bluesman, Andy.
SUPMALE:You are, too, bro.
LEADFEMALE: Very good! Very good indeed.
SUPMALE:I had no idea we had two such down-home funky hepcats in the Keaton family.
SUPFEMALE:You're right, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:We're cool.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely.
OTHERMALE:Andy has even decided what he's going to be when he grows up.
LEADMALE:Oh, what is that? A bluesman? No, a music publisher.
LEADMALE:Bluesmen don't make money.
LEADMALE:You must understand, Professor Webster See, in my view, your "Pawn Shop Blues" has overtones of the Aeolian cadences in Mahler's "Das Lied von der Erde.
LEADFEMALE:" That's the way I think, too.
SUPFEMALE:You see, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Dupre, you are the absolute epitome of the American spirit.
LEADFEMALE:Professor Webster, you're going to get on my nerves.
OTHERFEMALE:"Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Dupre, you're a living legend.
LEADMALE:"Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Dupre, you're indebted to the blues.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Dupre, you're a national treasure.
LEADMALE:" You caused all this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'm proud of it.
LEADMALE:I just happen to believe that the blues of Eddie Dupre are every bit as important a contribution to American culture as Huckleberry Finn.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go find Huckleberry Finn and hassle him, too? - Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE: Hi, girls.
LEADFEMALE: Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mr.
LEADMALE:Dupre.
SUPMALE:We just wanted to let you know that over the past few days, well, we've really become big blues fans.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:So we made this for you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? Oh, it's a scarf with all the shades of blue in it.
SUPFEMALE:Like the blues.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know you girls are becoming - sweethearts of the blues? - 
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Have a good show.
SUPMALE:Come on, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good one.
OTHERMALE:Oh All right, so you nervous? I got the two coldest feet in history.
OTHERMALE:The last time I played before an audience was 1965.
LEADMALE:You wasn't born then.
LEADMALE:And I don't know what Xerox was selling at.
LEADMALE:I've got a good notion to just jump right out that door.
LEADMALE:No, Eddie, listen to me.
SUPMALE:If you don't sing tonight, I will.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton, you fight dirty.
OTHERFEMALE: Evening.
LEADMALE:We, uh we have a very special treat for you tonight.
SUPFEMALE:A legendary blues artist we haven't heard nearly enough of in a in a long, long time.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, he's come a long way to be here tonight.
OTHERMALE:Listen, there's nothing I can say about this guy that he can't say himself with his music.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Eddie Dupre!  Guess I'm supposed to play you some blues.
SUPMALE:So here I go.
LEADMALE:I'm tired Of runnin' around Think I'll get married And settle down This old sportin' life It is a mean life And it's killin' me Yes, it is I got a letter from my home All my schoolmates They are dead and gone It'll make you worry It'll make you wonder My days are gone.

LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, I love it.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to be great.
OTHERMALE:Okay, you can let it down now.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure every brother does this for his sister? Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:Did Alex do it for you? He wanted to, but he just wasn't right for it.
LEADFEMALE:How come? Well Alex has a weird body.
OTHERMALE:It's like his head is too big for the rest of him.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe the rest of him is just too small.
LEADFEMALE:That's probably it.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, what the heck is this? Calm down, Alex.
LEADMALE:Andy's just helping me hem a skirt.
LEADFEMALE:It's no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:No big deal? Mal, he is a healthy, happy six-year-old boy.
LEADFEMALE:He should not be standing on a counter in-in a dress.
SUPMALE:Especially not this dress.
LEADFEMALE:The color's all wrong for him.
LEADFEMALE:You wish you could be standing up here, Alex, but you can't because your body's weird.
LEADFEMALE:What? Andy, honey, why don't you go outside and play? Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:What-what do what do you mean, my body is weird? You got a big head ask Mallory.
SUPMALE:Did you tell him that? Alex, leave me alone.
SUPMALE:She said that the rest of your body is too small.
LEADFEMALE:You said that.
OTHERFEMALE:I have got a perfect body, okay? And you cannot beat my head.
LEADMALE:They make a phenomenal set.
LEADMALE:Fine, Alex, whatever you say.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait Is there something wrong with my head? I mean, tell me, because I would like to know.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, it's no big deal.
LEADMALE:You've just got the little Elmer Fudd thing working for you, that's all.
LEADMALE:Elmer Fudd? I'm getting out of here.
SUPMALE:Wait, Elmer Fudd what does Elmer Fudd He asked me whether or not you had done this Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, what's the matter with you? You look miserable.
LEADMALE:You really do.
SUPMALE:Jen, you look awful.
SUPMALE:But before we discuss that, let me ask you something.
LEADMALE:Is there something wrong with my head? Does Easter Island mean anything to you? What's the matter, Jen? What's wrong? This might be the worst day of my school career.
SUPMALE:Why? What happened? I had to do a book report for my English class.
LEADMALE:Jen, I'm so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:No, the problem is I wanted to do my report on Huckleberry Finn.
LEADMALE:You're in luck, Jen.
LEADMALE:I did a paper on that.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mal, that was Huckleberry Hound.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's right, right.
SUPFEMALE:See? I found out in school today that Huckleberry Finn is not on the school's accepted reading list.
LEADFEMALE:It's banned.
OTHERMALE:Banned? What come on, that's absurd.
SUPFEMALE:Wh-When did this happen? Well, it's a new policy it just went into effect.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I wish they banned books when I was in high school.
LEADMALE:They start everything good after I leave.
SUPMALE:How how can they ban Huckleberry Finn? I mean, every kid reads Huck Finn.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the great American novel.
LEADMALE:It symbolizes the unrest and ferment of the country as the as the Western Frontier was coming to a close and we as a nation were forced to confront the issues of of racism, slavery and industrialism.
OTHERMALE:Oh, maybe I didn't read it.
SUPFEMALE:Who decided this? The Leland Heights School Board.
LEADFEMALE:They gave me this letter to take home and a packet of information about it.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jen, if you're lucky, they'll ban this packet, too.
SUPMALE:Looks pretty deadly.
OTHERMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:Hey! Mom, Dad, I'm glad you're here.
LEADMALE:I've got something to tell you, and I don't think you're going to like it.
SUPFEMALE:The greeting all parents yearn for.
LEADMALE:Should we sit down? It's something that happened at school today.
LEADMALE:Jen, listen, break it to them easy, okay? Just remember, they're liberals.
SUPFEMALE:They could spontaneously combust.
LEADMALE:Alex is right.
LEADFEMALE:I know how upset you guys get about these things.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what is it, honey? I wanted to do a book report on Huckleberry Finn.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:But don't let it happen again.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:Huckleberry Finn is banned.
LEADMALE:Banned? That's ridic what are you talking about? Okay, okay, just take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't stage a sit-in or anything.
SUPFEMALE:I knew the school board's been talking about this, but I never dreamed they'd dare to do it.
LEADMALE:This is amazing.
OTHERFEMALE:If we lived two miles down the road in the Columbus School District, this wouldn't be a problem.
LEADFEMALE:We'd be closer to the mall, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Was there any discussion about this at school? Or is everyone just going to stand there and allow this to happen? Wh-What about your English teacher? Well, Mr.
LEADMALE:Flaherty is just as upset about this as I am, but he said there's nothing that can be done about it.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, no, there's no way we are going to let this happen.
SUPFEMALE:This is completely wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I totally agree with you, Dad we've got to fight this.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, absolutely, this is a disgrace to the community, to the state, to the country.
OTHERFEMALE:Do I have a big head? "I hadn't had a bite to eat since yesterday, "so Jim, he got out some corn dodgers and buttermilk, "and pork and cabbage and greens.
LEADFEMALE:"There ain't nothing in the world so good "when it's cooked right.
LEADFEMALE:"And whilst I eat my supper, we talked and had a good time.
LEADMALE:"I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, "and so was Jim to get away from the swamp.
OTHERFEMALE:We said, 'There warn't no home like a raft, after all.
OTHERMALE:" Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:With those stockings? I'm going to die.
LEADMALE:Mallory, please, your dad's reading from a great piece of American literature.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I know, I know.
LEADMALE:I-I'm listening.
LEADMALE:Um they're on a cruise, right? Not exactly a cruise.
LEADMALE:They're on a raft, floating down the Mississippi.
LEADFEMALE:It's a yeah, it's a great story.
OTHERMALE:I'll be right with you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, my family keeps interrupting.
SUPFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I used to love that book when I was a kid.
LEADMALE:I, uh I'd always imagine myself in Huck's place, you know? Lying out there in the river at night, free as can be.
LEADFEMALE:Only, uh, well, mine mine wasn't a raft.
LEADMALE:It was a cabin cruiser.
LEADMALE:Complete wet bar, satellite dish.
LEADMALE:Hot tub.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know I still like Twain's version.
LEADMALE:To each his own, Pop.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I'm off the phone.
LEADMALE:I'm ready to talk about the book.
LEADFEMALE:That's probably for me.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe the Leland Heights Board of Education finds all these books unacceptable.
LEADMALE:Here, uh Catcher in the Rye, Grapes of Wrath, Slaughterhouse-Five? That's preposterous.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, what books can you read? Well, we're down to Babar Goes to Holland and The Yogi Berra Story.
SUPMALE:Well, this is infuriating.
LEADFEMALE:Every one of these books is a classic.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, how can they justify that? Well, the argument is that the books contain explicit language or, uh or offensive imagery that's unacceptable for pre-college students.
LEADFEMALE:The irony is that in Isl and Tree School District v.
OTHERFEMALE:Pico, Justice Brennan said, "No local school board shall remove books "from school library shelves simply because "they dislike the ideas contained in those books, "nor by their removal seek to prescribe what shall be orthodox "in politics, nationalism, religion and other matters of opinion.
LEADFEMALE:" How did you know that? I know everything.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I've got to admit, I'm surprised you're on our side in this issue.
SUPFEMALE:To think that book banning is actually bringing us closer together.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Dad, I-I I do enjoy keeping you on your toes.
SUPMALE:But, uh, basically, I agree with John Stuart Mill's philosophy that a free flow of ideas and-and information is essential to keeping alive the spirit of a of a libertarian and utilitarian vision flourishing against the oppressive weight of ignorance and totalitarianism.
LEADFEMALE:Did you swallow a dictionary recently? I'm just saying that regardless of the contents of a book, I believe that we have to preserve the rights of freedom of thought and freedom of speech for every American citizen.
SUPFEMALE:A straight lettuce diet? That's wild.
LEADMALE:With certain obvious exceptions.
SUPMALE:I think the books on this list are just the kind of things high school students should be reading.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, they're provocative, they're insightful, they make you think.
SUPMALE:I mean, what's wrong with that? The problem the school board has with the book is that Huck's best friend is sometimes referred to as N***** Jim.
LEADMALE:Now, look, that's definitely offensive, but it shouldn't be taken out of context.
LEADFEMALE:At the time Twain wrote the book, it was, uh, common usage in Missouri.
SUPFEMALE:The whole point of the story is how Huck learns that a man's color is not important and that everyone deserved to be free.
SUPFEMALE:Jim is the most noble character in the book.
LEADFEMALE:There are also objections on religious grounds.
SUPMALE:Apparently the school board dislikes the fact that Huck says he would rather go to hell than turn Jim back into slavery.
SUPMALE:That he, in fact, rejects God.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'm off the phone.
LEADFEMALE:I'm all yours.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Now we get to the bottom of this.
LEADMALE:Well, what about the other kids, Jen? Or are you the only one who wants to read a book that's on this list? Well, I don't want to do my report on this book because the book is banned.
LEADFEMALE:I happen to love that book.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, this book is over 300 pages long, not including pictures.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's a blessing in disguise.
LEADMALE:Jen, look, if you want to do your book report on Huck Finn, then you should do it on Huck Finn, and the rest of us will support you on that, right? - Yeah, absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:Definitely.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:But it's got to be your decision.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I never thought reading a book would be something I'd have to fight for.
SUPMALE:You know, uh, Jen, I once had a brush with censorship myself.
SUPMALE:Remember, uh, Elyse, back in Berkeley? Huh, 1963? I wrote an article for the Berkeley Gazette.
SUPFEMALE:"Fluctuating Electoral Demographics in the 1962 Congressional Race.
LEADMALE:" It was censored? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:On what basis? Oh, well, it was incredibly boring.
OTHERMALE:Well, I mean, "boring" in the best, most interesting sense of the word.
SUPMALE:Thank you, dear that's exactly what you said on your review at the time.
SUPFEMALE:This is a book report I want to do, and it doesn't seem right that I should be stopped from doing it.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it doesn't.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I don't want to read The Yogi Berra Story.
LEADMALE:And you shouldn't have to.
SUPFEMALE:Freedom of speech is guaranteed in the Constitution, and-and basically, they're throwing out the Bill of Rights.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:If we don't take a stand, who will? I mean, where will this all end? All right.
SUPMALE:So, basically, you're going to read the book, do the book report, risk possible failure in English, jeopardize your chances of getting into any college other than Grant, and, uh, become a social outcast in your own community.
LEADFEMALE:I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:That's our girl! When he was 19, Yogi batted.
LEADFEMALE:315, had 103 RBls and was elected to the all-star team.
SUPFEMALE:It was also during this season that Yogi told his teammates that he would one day become spokesman for a wonderfully thirst-quenching chocolate-flavored drink called Yoo-hoo.
SUPFEMALE:The rest is beverage history.
SUPMALE:Well, very nice, Jill.
SUPFEMALE:I think we all feel a little closer to Yogi.
SUPMALE:But I think I'd like you to try something a little more challenging next time.
LEADMALE:Like what? Well, it's just that your past reports seem to indicate a certain pattern.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, we've had The Joe Namath Story, The Johnny Bench Story, The Magic Johnson Story.
OTHERMALE:You should branch out a little.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I haven't done anything on hockey.
SUPMALE:Sit down, Jill.
LEADMALE:Jennifer.
OTHERMALE:You ready? I think so.
SUPMALE:"You don't know about me without you have read the book "by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but that ain't no matter.
LEADMALE:" So began Twain's American classic, Huckleberry Finn.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, can I speak to you for a minute? Uh, Martin, perhaps you could begin your paper.
SUPMALE:Athlete broadcaster soft drink spokesman.
LEADFEMALE:Who is this great American? Yogi Berra.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, I thought I made myself clear on this.
OTHERFEMALE:You know Huckleberry Finn isn't on the approved reading list.
LEADFEMALE:I know, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Flaherty, and I've given it a lot of thought.
LEADMALE:And I don't approve of the approved reading list.
SUPMALE:Well, neither do I! But I am a teacher in this school system, and I have to abide by those rules.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mr.
SUPMALE:Flaherty, but I really feel strongly about this.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, if that's the case, I have no choice but to call Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Hewitt.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, not Hewitt the Hun.
SUPMALE:She's going to find out eventually.
LEADFEMALE:Billy Yogi lived his life by his immortal words ever since he was born Go to the principal's office.
SUPFEMALE:What'd I do? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Just go tell Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Hewitt I need to see her.
LEADFEMALE:Hewitt the Hun? Uh, look, I'm sorry, Jen, but I got to do what be says.
LEADMALE:I'm failing.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer I hate to have to do this.
OTHERMALE:Uh, you understand the position I'm in.
LEADMALE:You always told us to think for ourselves and to have the courage of our convictions, and if and if we really believe in something, then to act on it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure, throw that one up at me.
LEADMALE:Have you discussed this with your parents? Yes, I have, and they support me completely.
LEADMALE:Boy, you Keatons are never far from controversy, are you? I remember when Alex tried to get the school to close on Ron and Nancy's anniversary.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, he-he did stay home that day.
LEADFEMALE:And-and he sent them those beautiful matching jumpsuits.
OTHERMALE:I hope you know what you're doing, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:This is serious business.
LEADMALE:Good afternoon, Mr.
LEADMALE:Flaherty.
OTHERFEMALE:Is there a problem? I'm afraid there is.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Hewitt, you know Jennifer Keaton.
SUPMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:She's about to do her book report on Huckleberry Finn.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, are you aware that district policy does not allow us to discuss that book in the classroom? Yes, I am, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Hun.
SUPMALE:Dr.
SUPMALE:Hewitt.
LEADMALE:Um But I don't think it's right.
SUPMALE:Well, you are certainly entitled to your opinion, but as long as you're a student in this school, you have to abide by school regulations.
LEADMALE:If you have a problem with a particular policy, I suggest you take it up with the Board of Education.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Flaherty, why don't we give Jennifer time to find another suitable book and give her report in the near future? No! This is the book report I'm going to give.
LEADMALE:As Dante once said, "The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in times of moral crisis, remain neutral.
LEADFEMALE:" What does that mean? I think she's just making conversation.
OTHERMALE:So, in conclusion, this is one of the best books I've ever read.
LEADMALE:I recommend it to everyone in this class.
LEADFEMALE:And I leave you with this question to ponder.
LEADMALE:Is Yogi Berra related to Yogi Bear? And if so, how? My-my book report is about Huckleberry Finn.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer! Written in 1884, about 20 years after the Civil War ended, this book is not only the story of a young man's journey down the Mississippi, but it's also the story of America's journey from innocence to maturity.
LEADMALE:All right, Andy, we're almost finished.
SUPMALE:You know, I asked around.
OTHERFEMALE:Other brothers don't do this.
OTHERMALE:Um, well, you're special.
SUPMALE:I know, but the thrill is starting to wear off.
LEADMALE:Oh, a little tailoring going on, huh? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:We're almost finished.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Need any help? You can't help.
LEADMALE:Remember? Your head's too big.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Just give me this tape measure.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex - Just-just a minute.
OTHERMALE:Just put your finger right there, all right? - You know what - Will you? Come on! Swelled head check, Alex? All right.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Listen, you guys are my parents.
LEADMALE:Help me out on this one.
OTHERMALE:Is my head too big for my body? A little.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Okay, let me tell you something.
LEADMALE:Maybe all of your heads are just a little too small for your bodies.
OTHERFEMALE:Huh? You ever think of that? - Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What? What-what happened? Did-did you read from your Huck Finn report? I did it.
LEADFEMALE:We are so proud of you, Jen.
LEADMALE:That took a great deal of courage.
LEADMALE:And now my only hope is that you have the tuition money to pay for private school 'cause that's definitely where I'm headed.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what happened? Come on, hey don't kid around, now.
LEADMALE:Private school is expensive.
LEADMALE:Well, when Mr.
LEADMALE:Flaherty found out that I was doing my report on Huck Finn, he had to call down to the principal, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Hewitt.
SUPMALE:She warned me not to do it.
SUPFEMALE:When I did it anyway, she took my pages away.
LEADMALE:She what? - What? She confiscated your book report? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I'm not even going to have a chance to be graded.
SUPFEMALE:Not graded? Jen, you get all the breaks.
LEADFEMALE:Mal, uh, I-I don't I don't think you understand the implications of this.
LEADFEMALE:No one should have the right to tell you what you should or should not read.
SUPMALE:Yeah, Mal, come on.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like it if someone came into the Grant College Library and took the book out? Well, I'm sure they had very good reasons for what they were doing.
SUPMALE:Well, Mal, I don't think any of these are good reasons.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, banning The Diary of Anne Frank because it treated all religions equally? Banning Mice and Men because of vulgarity? - Banning Cosmopolitan - What? Why? Cosmopolitan because it deals explicitly with sexual issues.
LEADFEMALE:The swine! Why aren't we doing something about this? We're going to, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to call other parents, organize.
LEADMALE:We're not going to back down from this.
SUPFEMALE:This is a question of free speech.
SUPMALE:The Supreme Court said that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, actually, what the court said was that the defendant school board had violated students' rights in in censoring books from the school library.
LEADFEMALE:Thus the question becomes whether the, uh the discretion of the school board to make curricular decisions is impeded in any way by First Amendment considerations.
LEADMALE:I told you, I know everything.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's why your head's so big.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hi.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, yes, yes, we're we're very proud of her ourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Uh well, I'll let her know.
LEADFEMALE:That was, uh, Tricia Willis's father, just saying he heard what you did in class, and the Willises are behind it 100%.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, you are a regular celebrity.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so proud of you.
OTHERMALE:Hey, maybe Dad can do one of his boring documentaries on you.
LEADFEMALE:I-I mean "boring" in the in the best, most interesting sense of the word.
LEADMALE:Hello, Alex.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Flaherty.
LEADMALE:How are you? I haven't seen you in a long time.
SUPMALE:Has your head gotten bigger? Good to see you, Mr.
LEADMALE:Flaherty.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Flaherty.
SUPMALE:We heard what happened this afternoon.
OTHERMALE:I-I can't begin to tell you how aggravated and upset we are.
LEADMALE:I'm not thrilled with the way things went, either.
SUPFEMALE:But I just wanted to tell you how proud you should be of your daughter.
SUPMALE:She really handled herself beautifully in a very difficult, sensitive situation.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Flaherty.
SUPFEMALE:That's good to hear anyway.
LEADFEMALE:I also wanted to tell you I got your book report back from Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Hewitt.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's the finest report on Huckleberry Finn I've ever read.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, Alex.
SUPMALE:This was better.
LEADMALE:Well, at least it stays in the family.
SUPFEMALE:That's why it really hurts to tell you that I have to fail you on the report, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Why? Because, as far as the school board is concerned, Huckleberry Finn doesn't exist.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I'm sure Mark Twain would be thrilled to hear that.
LEADFEMALE:Technically, if the book isn't officially recognized, there's no book report.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:I'm going to fail.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, listen.
SUPFEMALE:No Keaton has ever failed English.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I No more Keatons are going to fail English.
SUPMALE:Well, unfortunately, the failing isn't the worst of it.
OTHERFEMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Hewitt has said that unless Jennifer chooses to do another book report and stops defying the rules of the school, she's going to be suspended.
SUPMALE:Uh Well, I'm not backing down.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:What are you reading, Andy? The Little Engine that Could.
LEADMALE:Do you think it'll be banned? I don't know, but if I were you, I'd read fast.
OTHERMALE:What does "banned" mean? It means that a certain authority decides that a certain piece of material can't be used at a certain place or time.
LEADMALE:What does "banned" mean? Hey! How you doing, Andy? What's all that? This, Jen, is your defense.
LEADMALE:Now, when you and Mom and Dad walk into Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Hewitt's office tomorrow, I want you to have every legal fact, argument and precedent at your disposal.
LEADMALE:Now, you can either use these books to brilliantly articulate your position or, failing that, you can simply drop them on Dr.
SUPMALE:Hewitt's head.
OTHERMALE:What does "banned" mean? He keeps saying that.
SUPFEMALE:Can you please explain it to him? Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, Andy, "banned," or "banning," or "to ban," comes from the Germanic root "bannan" meaning to command.
OTHERFEMALE:But you can simply think of it as a as a as a legal prohibition, a censure, a condemnation.
SUPFEMALE:Now I don't know what "banned" means.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you think I feel? I'll never know! You know, Jen, I got to tell you, I really admire the way you've handled yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, your-your sensitivity, your intelligence, your strength of character over the last few days.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, when I look at you, I see someone who has got a great future.
LEADMALE:Someone who could do anything they set out to do.
LEADMALE:Jen, I guess what I'm trying to say is 
LEADFEMALE:Someday, you could even work for me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, joy.
LEADMALE:Of course, you'd have to start in the mailroom, you know, minimum wage, but, uh, you'd have Sundays and-and-and legal holidays off.
SUPMALE:And, uh, Christmastime, you come to my house for eggnog.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:It makes it all worthwhile.
LEADMALE:But I've got to admit I'm still a little nervous about going to see Dr.
LEADMALE:Hewitt tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:What if she suspends me? Suspend her right back.
LEADMALE:I'm serious, Alex.
LEADMALE:I know, I know, I know.
SUPMALE:Look, hey, you know, even if you get suspended, you've still got the job with me, right? Of course, with the suspension, you're going to have to start on the loading dock.
SUPMALE:I understand.
OTHERMALE:"But I reckon I got to light out "for the territory ahead of the rest, "because Aunt Sally, she's gonna adopt me and civilize me, "and I can't stand it.
SUPFEMALE:I've been there before.
SUPFEMALE:" Mal, is that you? What are you doing? I'm reading.
OTHERMALE:When did you learn how? When I found out that Cosmopolitan magazine was banned in certain places, I became enraged.
LEADFEMALE:Then I saw Huckleberry Finn sitting on the coffee table, and I said to myself, "What better way to show Jennifer my support?" So I picked it up, and I started reading.
LEADMALE:And you know what? I love it.
LEADMALE:I love reading.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to teach Nick how to read.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Jen, I'm really looking forward to that meeting with your principal.
LEADFEMALE:We've got some very persuasive arguments we want her to hear.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really glad you guys are coming with me tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we wouldn't have it any other way.
LEADFEMALE:We're all in this together.
SUPFEMALE:You know, maybe you should get to bed early tonight, honey.
SUPFEMALE:You got a big day tomorrow.
SUPMALE:I'm too nervous to sleep.
LEADMALE:Want me to read to you? Principal's office.
SUPMALE:What a scary place this used to be.
SUPMALE:It still is for me, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:When did you ever get in trouble, Steven? Elyse, I spent a lot of time on a bench outside the principal's office.
LEADMALE:You were hall monitor.
LEADMALE:And I had to keep my eye on a lot of really bad kids.
OTHERMALE:Sometimes they'd try to make a break for it, and, uh, if I couldn't catch them, it was, uh, back to milk monitor for little Stevie Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:You're a real bad seed, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I really was big trouble in high school.
OTHERFEMALE:You, Mom? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, I used to question everything.
SUPFEMALE:I remember when the administration said that girls couldn't take woodworking shop.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I organized a protest.
OTHERFEMALE:And all the freshman girls took over the shop and started sawing chairs apart until the administration gave in.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, I'm-I'm afraid, as your hall monitor, I would have had to apprehend you and escort you directly to Miss Dougherty's office.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, I'm really scared.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't know what your principal was like, but I hope you're ready for Hewitt the Hun.
SUPMALE:She takes no prisoners.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry, Jen.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not afraid.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, Mr.
SUPMALE:And Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPMALE:Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mr.
LEADMALE:Carter, the superintendent of schools.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello there.
OTHERFEMALE:I believe you know Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Flaherty.
OTHERMALE:Yes, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Flaherty.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Hewitt, good to see you.
LEADMALE:Morning.
OTHERMALE:Would anyone like anything to drink? 
OTHERMALE:No, thank you.
SUPMALE:Jennifer? Whiskey, please.
SUPMALE:Jen, please, let let me handle this, huh? Uh, Dr.
LEADMALE:Hewitt Sit down, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Yes, right away.
SUPFEMALE:Now, this is the situation as I see it.
LEADFEMALE:There is a policy in this district, passed by our board of education, which states that certain books are unacceptable for our children of high school age.
SUPFEMALE:Huckleberry Finn is among them.
LEADFEMALE:Therefore, Jennifer's book report is unacceptable.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Hewitt, have you ever read the book? Whether I've read Huckleberry Finn is not the issue.
OTHERMALE:The question is whether it's appropriate for Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:What right do you have to decide what's appropriate reading material for our daughter? I mean, personally, I find that tremendously offensive.
SUPFEMALE:It's not Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Hewitt's decision, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:It's a decision of the school board.
LEADFEMALE:Then I am offended by the school board.
LEADFEMALE:Where's that whiskey? Uh, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, uh, the state requires us to teach certain specifics in the basic curriculum.
LEADMALE:But how those subjects are taught and what textbooks are used are all left up to the individual school boards, and with good reason.
LEADMALE:Because the school boards represent the values of the people in the community.
LEADFEMALE:What you have to understand is that it is our job to nurture, guide and protect these children.
LEADMALE:But just what is it that you're protecting them from? I mean, it seems to me that the best thing that a school can do is is teach children that that moral questions are complex, that in a democratic society, different people have different views.
LEADFEMALE:As a teacher, I've always felt that freedom of speech, free expression, is an essential part of a good education.
LEADMALE:Of course, that's just my opinion.
LEADFEMALE:I could be wrong.
LEADFEMALE:But that goes against everything you've ever taught me.
SUPFEMALE:You're not wrong.
LEADFEMALE:But he is a teacher in this school district.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Flaherty I'm sorry, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we're certainly not going to let this go unchallenged.
LEADMALE:We're talking about the First Amendment here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, then I suggest you contact a lawyer, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Believe me, we intend to.
SUPMALE:We intend to, as well.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, uh, we intend to more than you intend to.
LEADFEMALE:"Well, I got a good going-over in the morning "from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes; "but the widow, she didn't scold, "but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave a while if I could.
LEADFEMALE:" Your turn, Nick.
SUPMALE: "Then Miss Watson, "she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it.
LEADFEMALE:" Hey, I'm lucky.
LEADMALE:I got a short one.
LEADMALE: Back to you, Mal.
LEADMALE:"She told me to pray every day "and whatever I asked for, I would get.
SUPMALE:But it warn't so.
OTHERFEMALE:" Hey, uh, that's, uh, my sentence.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
SUPMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:"But it warn't so.
LEADFEMALE:"  Just back from Evelyn Wood? Oh, hey, hey, hey, come on, Alex.
SUPMALE:Want to help us out? We got plenty of sentences in this book.
SUPMALE:No, Nick, no.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Thanks anyway.
LEADMALE:No, no, I'm funny that way.
LEADFEMALE:I like to read two, sometimes three sentences in a row.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, give us a break.
SUPMALE:You're always criticizing me and Nick for not being cultured.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, hey, can't do that anymore, huh? No, you can't, 'cause we're reading the classics.
LEADMALE:You guys should read War and Peace next.
SUPFEMALE:I'll never see either of you again.
LEADFEMALE:  Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:Yeah, just a minute, please.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jen! Jen, it's, uh it's Bill Godfried from the Lei and Herald.
OTHERFEMALE: Tell him I'm not in.
SUPMALE:You got it.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:She says she's not in.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Jen.
SUPFEMALE:He sounded real anxious to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:No, thanks, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:In the past week, I've done interviews with every newspaper in Ohio.
LEADFEMALE:They don't know when to stop.
LEADMALE:I didn't realize book banning was everybody's favorite subject.
LEADMALE: There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm-I'm kind of tired of talking about this, okay? Can't you understand that? We've been over this a thousand times.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, we'll see you Saturday, Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:Well, she won't be bothering us anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what's going on.
LEADMALE:Suddenly my life has turned upside down.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Flaherty didn't turn out to be who I believed he was.
SUPMALE:I thought he was on my side, but the minute we stepped into Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Hewitt's office, he just wimped out.
SUPMALE:That's too bad.
LEADMALE:All my friends want to talk to me about is failing in English, book banning and what I'm going to do when I'm suspended.
SUPMALE:Well, I've always found that a picnic lunch followed by an afternoon of bowling an excellent way to spend the first day of suspension.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Jen! Jen! I'd like you to meet your lawyer, Susan White.
LEADMALE:Susan, our daughter, Jennifer Keaton.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Susan's mother was at Berkeley with your father and me.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, she was born in the commune that we all lived on together.
LEADMALE:We used to call her Raindrop.
LEADMALE: Now she's at the law firm of Hughes, Frank and MacGregor, and she's offered to give us some advice on how to deal with the school board.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, I am so pleased to meet you.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I'm truly impressed by the stand you've taken.
SUPMALE:It's a real thrill to meet someone of your generation who's interested in something other than just maintaining the status quo so they can make a fast buck.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't even know me.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a sixth sense about these things.
LEADMALE:I guess you're working for free at Hughes, Frank and McGregor.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Raindrop? Susan White, our son, Alex Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
SUPMALE:Aren't genetics wild? And this is our daughter Mallory and her, uh, well, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, have a seat, uh, Susan.
LEADFEMALE:You, too, uh, Jen.
LEADMALE:Now, basically, what Susan is planning to do is, uh, let us know what our rights are, tell us how to handle ourselves at the school board meeting tomorrow and, if necessary, help us out if this comes to a court challenge.
SUPMALE:Now, the way I see it, Jennifer, we have a couple of court cases working for us.
LEADMALE:Of course, there's the Supreme Court's Island Trees decision from 1982.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah, I briefed her on that already.
OTHERFEMALE:And, uh, before that, Tinker v.
LEADFEMALE:Des Moines School District from 1968.
SUPMALE:Tinker was was '69.
LEADMALE:I could sue the pants off you.
LEADMALE:Let's go, come on.
LEADMALE:Pull out your briefs, R.
SUPMALE:D.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Order in the living room, for goodness.
LEADFEMALE:This is very, very exciting.
SUPMALE:It's just like People's Court.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Jennifer, I know you've been through a lot, but it would really help to go over what your role is going to be at the meeting.
OTHERMALE:You've become the symbol for this fight, and there are going to be a lot of people there looking for you and waiting to hear what you have to say.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I was hoping my part was over.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, I'm afraid it's just beginning.
SUPFEMALE: - 
SUPFEMALE:May I remind you to try to keep your remarks short and to the point? Uh, Mrs.
LEADMALE:, uh, Hummler, I believe you're next.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:My son is a student in Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Mitchell's English class, and I personally read the textbook they use.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I couldn't believe some of the language.
LEADMALE:It-it's-it's gutter language.
LEADMALE:And no one can tell me that our children can't get a good education without reading words like Well, I can't even say those words.
LEADFEMALE:But my son sure can now that he's read that book.
LEADMALE:Now, that's not the point.
LEADFEMALE:Your son probably knew those words before he read the book.
SUPMALE:Now, listen, mister, I don't know what goes on in your house, but no son of mine uses language 
LEADMALE:Don't you tell me what goes on in my house!  Order! Everybody will get a chance, but we need order.
LEADFEMALE:We won't tolerate this cross talk.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to be a long night.
OTHERMALE: I'd like to think that we were sending our daughter to a school that would allow her to read any book that's in the public library.
LEADMALE:I mean, otherwise, what kind of message are we sending to our kids? Are we saying that they can't be as open-minded in the school as they can outside the schoolhouse doors? Elyse, I-I was going to make that point.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Steven, come on.
SUPMALE:N-Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:Never mind.
SUPMALE:The point is, I have personally reviewed all of the books in question.
LEADMALE:Obviously, many of them have passed muster with the board.
SUPFEMALE:Where do you come off deciding what passes muster? Well, excuse me, but I have a PhD in education; and furthermore, the people of this community voted for me because they thought I was qualified to make these decisions.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:I voted for you.
OTHERFEMALE:But I also voted for Richard Nixon.
SUPMALE: Is Uh, wait, is that funny? I-I don't think that's funny.
SUPFEMALE:When a certain girl in my class, who shall remain nameless Jennifer Keaton did her book report on Huckleberry Finn, I was really behind her.
SUPMALE:I mean, I want to be a writer one day, and I may not be the best writer in the world, but I try.
LEADFEMALE:And I'd like to think that people in my own high school could read what I write.
LEADMALE:The book I'm writing now is called Smart Women, Foolish Outfits.
LEADMALE:Um, uh, I'd like to read that after Huckleberry Finn.
SUPMALE: There are so many communities across this country that have been torn asunder by this issue.
OTHERMALE:And as a lawyer, I've seen friends and neighbors get involved in legal mudslinging that completely obliterates the real issues at hand, which are freedom of thought and freedom of speech.
LEADFEMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:Everyone's saying what I was going to say.
SUPMALE:Let's take a look at one of the seminal cases in this area, Tarrington v.
LEADFEMALE:Thomas Jefferson High School.
SUPFEMALE:Now, in this case, Justice Turner wrote that if the 
LEADMALE:No, wait, hey, hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Justice MacNamara wrote the majority opinion in that case.
LEADFEMALE:Justice Turner merely concurring.
OTHERFEMALE:Um  Excuse me just for a second.
LEADMALE:I have a big bug crawling on me.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you want to take over?  And so, in Harrison v.
LEADFEMALE:The Lake Erie School District, the court affirmed, albeit with serious reservations, the doctrine stated in the Kramer case.
LEADMALE:So, any questions? Is your head getting bigger? 
LEADFEMALE:"Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, "but a raft don't.
LEADMALE:You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.
SUPFEMALE:" This book is just too beautiful to ban.
OTHERMALE:My own daughter.
LEADFEMALE:At least I've got, "Hello, I'm Steven Keaton" left.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:I'm Steven Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps a a recap of this evening's better points would be in order now.
OTHERFEMALE: A school has rules and regulations which might not stand up elsewhere but are necessary to education as in the recent Hazelwood decision where the, uh, Supreme Court held up that a school administration has the right to censor student newspapers.
SUPMALE:If we can require our children to do homework, to dress in a certain manner, to be in class for a certain period of time, then we can certainly advise them on what to read.
LEADFEMALE:We always hear in school that we young people are the future of America.
SUPMALE:Well, if we're going to be the future of America, we're going to have to know about our past.
SUPFEMALE:And not just the glory stuff we see in movies or read in some history books, but the true story.
LEADMALE:What people thought, what they felt, why they liked each other and even why they hated each other.
LEADMALE:And there's no better way to learn that than through great literature.
LEADMALE:If you take that away, what are we left with? - Hear, hear.
LEADMALE: Well, uh, I'd like to thank you all for coming.
LEADFEMALE:Be assured that all opinions will be taken into consideration.
SUPFEMALE:If there are no further comments, uh Mr.
SUPMALE:Carter, I have something to say.
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Flaherty.
LEADFEMALE:I've been a teacher now for six years at Harding High School.
LEADMALE:When this book banning rule went into effect, I upheld it because it was in my job contract to do so, although philosophically, it goes against everything I stand for.
SUPFEMALE:But when I saw one of my students stand up for what she believed was right I thought to myself, "What the hell is wrong with you, Flaherty? "You're an English teacher.
SUPFEMALE:You love books.
LEADMALE:And you are not just going to let this happen!" I want the board to know I want Dr.
OTHERMALE:Hewitt to know that I am willing to risk my job to fight for what I believe is right.
SUPMALE:And I have to thank one of my students, who shall remain nameless Jennifer Keaton for giving me the courage to stand up and do what I should have done as soon as this whole thing started.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I'm a teacher, and that should mean something.
SUPMALE: 
LEADFEMALE:"And the little engine looked at the hill and said, 'I think I can.
LEADMALE:" "I think I can.
LEADMALE:" "I think I can.
OTHERFEMALE:" This is getting pretty exciting.
SUPMALE:Uh, I wonder what happens next.
LEADMALE:He gets up the hill, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:You ruined it for me.
LEADMALE: Hi! So, how did it go, Andy? Did you have a good time with Nick? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Nick's reading much better, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:When he gets to a word he doesn't know, he sounds it out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:That was a good tip.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, why don't you go on up and get ready for bed? We'll be up to tuck you in in a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay? - Here, Uncle Nick.
LEADMALE:Hey, thanks.
SUPMALE:Night, buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:So, uh, how was your meeting? Oh, great.
LEADMALE:You should have heard Jennifer! She was eloquent and inspiring.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, Jen, I didn't know you were such a rebel, huh? You're just like James Dean but a girl.
OTHERMALE: Oh, God!  I haven't read Huckleberry Finn in two hours.
LEADFEMALE:Shame on me.
LEADMALE:Come on, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:Do you remember where we left off? Oh, I-I don't know, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Now I'm reading two books at once.
OTHERMALE:Well, Jen, you're off to a great start as an activist, huh? No, I think I'm going to retire, Dad.
SUPMALE:I can't do this again.
SUPMALE:I can't believe I even did what I did.
LEADFEMALE:I had no idea it would be so hard.
LEADFEMALE:That's what making a commitment's all about.
LEADFEMALE:No matter how difficult it is or how tough it gets, you got to stand there and stand up for what you believe in.
LEADFEMALE:You know that.
LEADMALE: Good news! The school board decided there was enough opposition to further scrutinize the banning issue and put it to a referendum! That's great news, Susan.
SUPFEMALE:Good news! The school board decided there's enough opposition to further scrutinize the banning issue and put put it to a referendum.
SUPFEMALE: I told them first.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:You ran two red lights to get here.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I scare you, Alex? You don't scare me, Raindrop.
LEADFEMALE:I have had it.
LEADFEMALE: All right You get over here.
OTHERMALE: Alex! Raindrop! - 
LEADMALE:She started it! - 
OTHERFEMALE:Raindrop! - She started it! Please! Good news! 
LEADFEMALE:We heard! What did you hear? The school board's reconsidering, and there's going to be a referendum.
SUPFEMALE:Really? I didn't hear that.
LEADMALE:That is good news.
LEADMALE:What I came to say is that a good number of my colleagues on the faculty at Harding have decided to band together and buck the administration.
SUPMALE:We're walking out until your suspension is revoked.
LEADMALE: Oh, Flaherty, all right! That's great.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Flaherty.
LEADMALE:You've always been my favorite teacher.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:We're a good team.
SUPFEMALE:We made a great first step, - but there's a long fight ahead of us.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:So we have to make sure we stick together.
SUPMALE:"And we could hear them yelling and barking "at each other all up and down the bank till we were so far away the sounds got dim and died out.
LEADMALE:" "And when we stepped onto the raft, I says, "Now, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a slave no more.
LEADFEMALE:" "Chug, chug, chug.
LEADMALE:"Puff, puff, puff.
LEADMALE:"Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong.
LEADMALE:"The little train rumbled over the tracks.
LEADFEMALE:She was a happy train.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer? Jen, you're not gonna believe this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so excited.
LEADFEMALE:I was up in the attic, and I found this shoe box.
LEADMALE:Congratulations, Mal.
LEADMALE:It's a real nice one.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:It's full of Mom and Dad's old love letters.
SUPFEMALE:What's a love letter? It's a really mushy letter you send someone to tell them how much you love them.
SUPMALE:I want to write one to Rachel Feltman.
LEADMALE:I love her.
LEADFEMALE:Who's she? She's a girl in my class.
LEADFEMALE:She's only five, but I don't care I like 'em young.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, listen, listen, listen.
LEADFEMALE:"My dearest, sweetest lambikens "you were so beautiful last night "when we took over the administration building.
LEADFEMALE:"Your lustrous skin was made even more luminous - Oh.
SUPMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:By the rosy" Oh! - Nothing! Um, it's n - Yeah, nothing, Mom.
LEADMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing, lambikens.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, listen Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Lauren's car just pulled up, and I want to talk to you guys about something before she comes in.
LEADMALE:Wow, I haven't seen Lauren around here lately.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, see, that's what I want to talk to you about.
LEADMALE:She's been having a lot of trouble with her senior thesis, and-and she's feeling kind of down about it.
LEADFEMALE:So whatever you do, don't mention the word "psychology" or "thesis.
LEADMALE:" - Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Lauren.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Lauren! How's that senior psychology thesis? Dad, Dad Alex asked us not to mention anything about her senior thesis.
SUPMALE:Why can't we say anything about your senior thesis? Because she's having trouble with it.
LEADMALE:Well, trouble with what? Her senior thesis! I want to thank you all very much.
SUPFEMALE:You pulled that off beautifully.
LEADMALE:I appreciate your concern, but actually, this thesis thing, it's no big deal.
LEADMALE:Really? I hear you're having trouble with it.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, come on.
SUPMALE:Let's not think about that nasty thesis, okay? Bad thesis! Let's let's talk about us, okay? How long it's been since we've seen each other, what a great time we're gonna have tonight, nice movie, fancy dinner I'll even lend you the money.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, Lauren, if you don't like your topic, I've got one for you.
LEADMALE:A friend of mine last year at Grant did her psychology thesis on "Intimacy Problems Between Capricorns and Pisces During the Holidays.
LEADFEMALE:" She got an "A.
LEADFEMALE:" I don't know if I can change my topic now.
LEADFEMALE:I've been researching this one for over two years.
LEADMALE:Well, how much have you written so far? A page and a half.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:If you've written that much, you can't turn back now.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, surprise.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex, I'm so glad you're here! Mm! - Whoa.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Oh! I'm sorry I had to cancel - that date last night.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's all right, that's okay I went to the movies with Skippy.
SUPMALE:You know Fatal Attraction with Skippy takes on a whole new meaning.
SUPFEMALE:Mmm! - I probably should have gone.
SUPFEMALE:As it is, I got nothing done.
LEADMALE:Ah, really? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I look at these mice, running like crazy on that wheel and getting nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:I think, how different am I from a mouse? You don't sit in your food.
SUPMALE:I had a meeting with Professor Lombard this morning.
LEADFEMALE:I showed her what I had on my thesis so far, - and she was disappointed.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:"This thesis will explore the following areas of behavior.
OTHERFEMALE:"One spend more time with Alex.
LEADMALE:"Two go out more with Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Three talk more with Alex.
SUPMALE:" Honey, this is brilliant.
SUPFEMALE:That's not it.
SUPFEMALE:That's the chapter I'm writing now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm thinking of calling it "Things I Can Do With Alex If I Quit My Thesis.
LEADMALE:" That's a snappy title.
LEADMALE:You're not really thinking of quitting your thesis, are you? What would be so wrong with that? I-I could go back to my old life, a life that I liked very much.
LEADFEMALE:I could spend more time with you.
LEADFEMALE:I could care for you and-and nurture you and watch over you.
LEADFEMALE:I could devote myself to you, and make sure that you're as happy and as contented as a human being could possibly be.
SUPMALE:If that would make you happy.
SUPMALE:It would.
LEADMALE:I really want to quit.
LEADFEMALE:D-Don't you think it's a good idea? I can't say.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, that's your decision.
LEADMALE:All right, then fine I'm quitting! Oh, Alex, I-I feel like an enormous weight's been lifted from me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm free! Does that mean you can go out with me tonight? Are you kidding? We're gonna celebrate.
SUPFEMALE:Mm! Come on.
LEADMALE:Mm! I quit! Do you hear that, Sigmund? I quit! Now I'm gonna devote all my time and energy to making you happy.
LEADFEMALE:Mm! Glad I stopped by.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what are you two doing? We're writing another love letter to Rachel Feltman.
LEADFEMALE:Another one? What'd she think of the first one? She hit me.
LEADMALE:It's a start.
LEADFEMALE:The letter made Margie Phillips cry.
LEADMALE:Why? Because Margie loves me, but I don't love Margie.
LEADMALE:I love Rachel.
LEADMALE:Rachel loves Clint Eastwood.
OTHERMALE:She claims they've dated.
LEADMALE:Well, Andy, maybe I can help you win the heart of your fair Rachel.
LEADFEMALE:You probably don't know this, but in my day I was quite the love letter writer myself.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that true my lovely my golden-haired, gossamer angel? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Write this down! It's working! My sweet each breath seems a lifetime when I'm away from you.
LEADFEMALE:I'd walk miles across desert sands for one glimpse - of your rare beauty.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, we were just, uh - Mom, hey, no need to explain, okay? I understand.
LEADMALE:It's tough to keep the excitement alive.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, now, Alex, I've seen you and Lauren get pretty mushy together.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, it's different, Mom we're young.
SUPFEMALE:Mush looks good on us.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you've enjoyed being together - with Lauren again, though, haven't you? - I can't lie to you, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Lauren quitting this thesis is the best thing that ever happened to me.
LEADFEMALE:Better than Nixon's pardon? That was more emotional, of course.
SUPFEMALE:But this is beyond my wildest dreams.
LEADMALE:And-and Lauren is doing all this great stuff for me.
SUPMALE:She even baked me a cake and decorated it.
LEADMALE:It was a scale model of the floor of the stock exchange.
LEADFEMALE:Done entirely in frosting.
LEADMALE:Tiny edible dollars.
SUPFEMALE:Little angry traders.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, as long as she's using her time wisely.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
OTHERFEMALE:Do I detect a note of condescension in your voice? Ooh.
LEADMALE:Certainly not.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mom, when I met Lauren, I was willing to put up with the professional career woman syndrome.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you suffer from that yourself, don't you, Mom? Yes, and I'm getting help.
LEADFEMALE:I lucked out, that's all.
SUPMALE:I mean, you know, Lauren decided she doesn't want a career, so I get the best of both worlds I get a smart girl who doesn't show it.
OTHERFEMALE:Face powder directly on the lips? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Then apply the lipstick, okay? And blot it a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:Then put your lip gloss on, and you're practically smudge-proof.
OTHERMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Alex, you wouldn't believe the things Mallory knows.
LEADMALE:No argument there.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mom, come on up I want to show you these new red sneakers I just bought.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you just bought some red sneakers last week.
LEADMALE:No, these are high-tops; they're for evening.
SUPMALE:So, did you have a good day today, honey? Oh, yeah, not bad, not bad.
SUPMALE:I finally finished that economics paper.
LEADMALE:Um what'd you do? Oh, not much.
LEADMALE:I rested.
LEADFEMALE:Saw a really good Wheel of Fortune on TV.
OTHERFEMALE:Great, great.
SUPFEMALE:So, oh, did you interview for that teaching job you were talking about? Well, not really.
OTHERMALE:There were about a hundred other people applying I can't compete with that.
LEADMALE:Why not? Because I don't want to.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, I've been thinking, if the purpose in life is to be happy, why should I do anything that doesn't make me happy? Right, right.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I can't argue with that.
SUPMALE:I want to learn gourmet cooking.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to learn bonsai gardening.
LEADMALE:I want to learn pebble art.
LEADMALE:Aha! But you're not ruling out this teaching job entirely, are you? It won't make me happy.
LEADMALE:I'm happy doing this.
SUPMALE:And if I need money, I'll just go on Wheel of Fortune.
LEADMALE:Aha.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, if I get a job, I may not be here for you when you need me.
LEADMALE:Don't you understand? I want to spend every second with you starting now.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:This is working out fine.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, will you check this letter for spelling? Yeah.
SUPMALE:"Dear Rachel, you have nice logs.
OTHERMALE:" I meant legs.
SUPMALE:Well, you should change that.
SUPFEMALE:No, she has nice logs, too.
LEADMALE:Sounds like the basis of a good relationship.
LEADMALE:Come on, Andy, let's go deliver your letter to Rachel.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, thanks for letting me go through your recipe file.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, well, since you're making this big dinner for Alex, I thought it might help if you knew some of his favorite dishes.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight I'm making Nancy Reagan's Hearty Beef Stew, for conservative cowboys and ravenous Republicans.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
OTHERMALE:Lauren, I am really impressed.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I could never make a beef stew.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't know the first thing to go into it.
LEADMALE:Well, beef.
SUPMALE:Oh, right! I'm so excited.
SUPFEMALE:I-I just love to cook, but I haven't had time until now.
LEADMALE:So you're really glad you dropped your thesis, right? Oh, yes.
OTHERFEMALE:What a relief! You know, all that time I spent studying, I felt like I was banging my head against the wall.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you do that, too? It just wasn't right for me.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes people make the wrong choices.
LEADMALE:Like in the Days of Our Children.
LEADFEMALE:Do you watch? Oh, the soap opera.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:It's like how Zander keeps trying to please Reef, but she'd be better off with Skyler.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think she should be with Brick.
SUPFEMALE:No, he's got a new girlfriend Cashmere.
SUPMALE:Oh, I love her! Well, I'd better get the groceries for tonight.
OTHERMALE:Tell Alex I'll see him at dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, and I'll see you Friday for that makeover lesson.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:-Oh, Alex, you can go grocery shopping with me.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, listen, I'm-I'm getting a little tired of grocery shopping.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:It's fun.
SUPFEMALE:You like it when I wheel you around in that cart.
SUPMALE:You know, Alex, you really should go.
SUPFEMALE:Nick and I always have a lot of fun grocery shopping.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we well, we go up to the deli counter, and we each take a number, and we run! Well can you imagine the looks on their faces when they call our numbers, and we're not there?! You two have such a full life.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Alex, let's do that.
SUPFEMALE:Honey! I'm, uh I'm not in the mood for deli pranks.
SUPMALE:Okay, if you don't want to go, but I'm gonna miss you every minute.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe what's happening.
LEADFEMALE:I now have a woman who runs errands for me and-and cooks for me and takes care of me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's everything I ever wanted, and I and I can't stand it.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think there's something wrong with me? Um generally speaking? Mallory tell me something.
SUPFEMALE:Do you notice anything different about Lauren? Well, she's definitely dressing better.
LEADFEMALE:And she seems to know a lot more.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, about important things.
LEADMALE:So you two are having a lot of fun together? Oh, I've never gotten along with her better.
LEADFEMALE:We're like one and the same now.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I was afraid of.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, this is your night, so I just want you to sit down and relax.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and I have the evening edition of the paper for you to read while I'm busy with dinner.
LEADMALE:Mmm.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Uh, honey? Honey? Honey, um, I would really rather just chat.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not just dinner, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm also doing some laundry for you, arranging some flowers and putting the final touches on dessert.
LEADMALE:What is this, the Betty Crockerathon? Lauren, sit down, talk to me.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want to talk about? How about, uh how about those election primaries, huh? Oh, Alex, I don't read the paper anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:There's so much sad news in it.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to be happy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, honey, it's important to keep up with what's going on in the world.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, for example for For example, uh do you see about this development in-in the Persian Gulf? Yes, I did, and I'm really mad about it.
SUPMALE:You are? Fabulous.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:What are you mad about? Um, U.
LEADFEMALE:S.
OTHERMALE:Involvement? Iranian aggression? What? Tell me.
LEADMALE:Tell me.
LEADMALE:I'm mad that that stupid news report broke in the middle of Days of Our Children.
LEADFEMALE:Right there when Zander was about to tell Reef that Brick and Cashmere were trying to frame Skyler for Nicole's murder.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex, what's wrong? Honey, don't-don't you miss your old life? Your thesis, the lab, the work? The-the-the the feeling that you got when you learned something new, something real? Look, I thought you wanted me to drop my thesis.
SUPFEMALE:I I know.
LEADFEMALE:I did.
SUPFEMALE:I Maybe I was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:You have so much to offer.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you should be doing more than watching soap operas and clipping recipes.
LEADFEMALE:But they're good recipes, Alex.
LEADMALE:Lauren, look at yourself.
LEADMALE:You are frittering your life away on these things.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you get tired of doing the same thing day after day and not accomplishing anything? Don't you appreciate all that I've done? The errand running? The cooking? - It's all for you.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Is-is it so bad that I want to spend my time with you and make you happy? What about you? What about making yourself happy? I mean you're using me as an excuse.
SUPMALE:I am not.
OTHERFEMALE:Admit it! You spend all your time watching TV! Playing along with Wheel of Fortune! All right, may-maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:Maybe I have been watching too much TV.
LEADFEMALE:I'll stop and I'll spend more time with you, okay? Okay, look, just stop trying to please me by satisfying my every whim! I can't believe I just said that.
OTHERMALE:Alex, this isn't that big of a problem.
LEADMALE:It is.
LEADFEMALE:It is.
LEADMALE:You don't see it.
LEADMALE:Lauren, you're hiding.
LEADFEMALE:You're hiding from the real world.
LEADFEMALE:You quit more than your thesis, Lauren.
LEADMALE:You quit life.
LEADMALE:I love you, but not like this, not the way you are right now.
SUPMALE:Lauren? Lauren? Leave me alone.
LEADMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hi, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:So, Mom tells me you're writing a new love letter to Rachel.
OTHERFEMALE:How did that go? She pushed me into a hedge.
SUPFEMALE:She's quite a charmer.
OTHERFEMALE:But Margie Phillips was there, and she helped me up.
LEADMALE:Ah, that's good.
OTHERFEMALE:She loves me.
LEADMALE:Now I love Margie, not Rachel.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, so let me guess.
SUPMALE:So now you're writing a love letter to Margie.
SUPMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Could you help me? Absolutely.
OTHERMALE:Absolutely.
LEADMALE:What have you got so far? "Dear Margie.
LEADFEMALE:" That's good.
SUPFEMALE:That's good.
OTHERMALE:That's good.
SUPMALE:I mean, it's a start.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't want to come on too strong.
OTHERFEMALE:But there's a lot more to say, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Like, um "Thanks for helping me out of the hedge.
LEADMALE:" And, also, "My dear Margie, "I'm sorry that I didn't pay more attention to you.
LEADFEMALE:"Sorry for a lot of things.
LEADMALE:"When you ran out of the room tonight, I my heart sank.
SUPMALE:"I love you.
SUPMALE:I want to be with you.
LEADFEMALE:But your thesis is important.
SUPFEMALE:" Yeah, that's good.
SUPMALE:Margie will like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, any word from Lauren? Uh no.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't think I'll be hearing from Lauren too soon.
LEADMALE:Well, honey, I know it was tough, but but what you did tonight you know, trying to wake Lauren up was a was a very brave and selfless thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it was a very feminist thing to do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, kick me while I'm down.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you actually learned something from this.
LEADMALE:What, Mom? What did I learn? That maybe you don't want to settle for a-a an empty-headed, ditsy little cream puff who's at your beck and call.
OTHERMALE:Maybe just on weekends? No, Alex.
LEADMALE:You know, I-I Under this buttoned-up, macho exterior, you don't really believe that.
SUPMALE:You're not going to be happy unless you're with a woman who is who is strong and vibrant.
LEADFEMALE:Someone who's an equal partner, someone you can talk to.
LEADMALE:You're right, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:And I blame you.
OTHERFEMALE:Then my work here is done.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I forgot to put the fabric softener in the laundry.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to have some wicked static cling in your socks.
LEADFEMALE:Alex what you said tonight cut awfully deep.
LEADMALE:It really hurt.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't easy to say.
LEADMALE:But I had to because I care about you, and I couldn't stand to see what was happening with you.
LEADFEMALE:Alex I feel like I'm alone out here on this one.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm the first woman in my family ever to go to college.
SUPFEMALE:Be a lot easier if I just had a role model.
LEADMALE:Sometimes I-I feel like I'm flapping my wings furiously, not knowing if I'm doing it right, because no one ever taught me how to fly.
OTHERMALE:Role models are important.
LEADMALE:I know, when I'm in a situation, I always think, "I wonder what my parents would do?" Then I do the opposite.
SUPMALE:Alex, it's different with you.
LEADMALE:You've always been confident.
LEADMALE:I remember our first date.
LEADMALE:You looked at me tenderly and said, "Do you know what's great about me?" You talked for six hours non-stop.
SUPMALE:You didn't even notice me leave.
SUPFEMALE:Then you still don't know what's great about me.
SUPMALE:I know what's great about you.
SUPFEMALE:You're smart, you're understanding.
SUPMALE:Ruggedly handsome.
OTHERFEMALE:It's funny.
SUPFEMALE:When-when I was little, I always pictured my future as living in a nice house and a garden and a couple of kids.
LEADFEMALE:And even though I knew I wanted a career, it was really never a part of my life vision.
LEADMALE:When I was a little kid, I always wanted to be supreme ruler of the universe.
SUPMALE:Alex, that's still your dream, isn't it? Yeah, but it doesn't seem like enough now.
SUPMALE:You know what my problem is? I've got a father complex.
LEADFEMALE:I-I was always daddy's little girl, and he always overprotected me.
OTHERMALE:And now, I'm trying to continue that personality dynamic with you.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, but did I just hear you say something psychoanalytical? I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:It just kind of came out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's great! Oh, it's great.
SUPMALE:Alex, I know I have to continue on with my thesis, but what I'm scared.
LEADFEMALE:What if I fail? Hey, hey, you got to take that risk.
SUPFEMALE:Will you help me? No.
LEADMALE:But but I'll be there to support you.
LEADMALE:I get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, this doesn't mean that you still can't dote on me, you know?
OTHERMALE:
SUPMALE:Here you are, Andy your very own magic set.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I don't know if I told you, but, uh, I was quite a magician in my day.
SUPMALE:In fact, I can do any trick there is.
SUPMALE:Can you disappear? We'll work up to that.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, the, uh, first trick I want to show you is called the magic rings.
SUPFEMALE:As you can see, these three rings are all attached.
SUPFEMALE:All I do is say the magic words abracadabra and presto! I can't believe my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Dad, how you doing? Hey, Andy.
LEADFEMALE: Hi.
OTHERMALE:What's going on, Dad, Dracula tryouts? 
SUPMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Dad's in his magic phase again.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:We've all been through it before.
SUPMALE:Are you saying that you doubt my magical powers? I have here a dollar bill.
SUPFEMALE: Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:I will rip this dollar bill into little pieces.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! Aah! - Ah Aah! Never fear, Alex.
LEADMALE:Never fear.
SUPFEMALE:Just say the magic words.
LEADMALE:Ah, hummuna, hummuna.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:And presto.
LEADMALE:Oops.
LEADFEMALE:You killed it! All right, uh, class is dismissed for today.
LEADMALE:Yay! He masks his enthusiasm well.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Carnac.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, do you want to give us a hand cleaning up? Uh, company is coming.
LEADFEMALE:Who's the company? Oh, Evelyn Mitchum.
SUPMALE:Evelyn Mitchum? Yeah, you remember my friend, Rosalie Mitchum.
LEADMALE:She used to live around the corner.
LEADMALE:Well, this is her mom.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I remember.
LEADFEMALE:They must have moved away about three years now.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, two and a half.
SUPMALE:Yeah, remember during the '76 election they had that, uh that Carter-Mondale sign in the front yard? God, what an eyesore that was.
LEADMALE:Funny funny how it kept disappearing.
LEADFEMALE:And kept showing up in our basement.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this is the first time since Rosalie died that Evelyn's come back here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, sometimes it's still hard for me to believe.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, 18 years old, and she took her own life.
SUPFEMALE:God, it's so sad.
LEADMALE:I don't know if I can handle this.
LEADMALE:I mean, how are we supposed to act in front of Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Mitchum? Just act normal.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, just act close to normal.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, there she is.
LEADMALE:Oh! - So good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you! - You look great.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Hi, Evelyn.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, gosh.
LEADMALE:Everyone, you remember Evelyn Mitchum.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Mallory look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're just you're a beautiful young woman.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hi, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Mitchum.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please, please, call me Evelyn.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, you look terrific.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:All grown-up now, huh? Nice to see you, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Mitchum.
LEADMALE:Please call me Evelyn.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, uh hope you're not still angry about that that, uh, Carter-Mondale incident, Evelyn.
LEADFEMALE:Please, call me Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Mitchum.
SUPMALE:So, you really like living in New York, huh? Yeah, it's-it's great.
OTHERMALE:It took a little getting used to, but it's very exciting.
LEADMALE:Do you live near Bloomingdale's? I live in Bloomingdale's, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Oh, I want to go to New York so bad, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, Evelyn, you don't have to do the dishes.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be silly.
LEADMALE:I don't mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Mmm.
SUPMALE:All right, everyone into the living room for levitation.
LEADFEMALE:So, Mallory, how's everything going with you? Oh, great.
SUPMALE:Um, I'm a-a sophomore at Grant College.
LEADFEMALE:I'm majoring in-in fashion design.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's great.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad to hear you kept up with that.
SUPFEMALE:You always had a great eye for fashion.
LEADMALE:I remember Rosalie would come home from school saying, "Mallory's wearing a paisley skirt.
SUPFEMALE:I want a paisley skirt.
SUPMALE:" Or, "Mallory's wearing a checked blouse.
LEADFEMALE:I want a checked blouse.
SUPFEMALE:" Well, I hope I wasn't wearing them together.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I have I have very warm memories of you and Rosalie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Those letters you wrote her really meant a lot to her.
SUPMALE:I think she was very lonely in New York.
LEADMALE:She never quite seemed to get the rhythm of the city.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh I got a sense of that in the letters she wrote me.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Well, what exactly did she say? Did-did she say anything specific? Oh well, you know Rosalie.
LEADMALE:She'd write four pages on the color of the trees in Central Park.
LEADFEMALE:And I'd reply with four pages on the, uh, color of the blouse I was wearing.
SUPMALE:You could always make her laugh, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:You were one of the few people who could.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, I really miss her.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:This is this is hard for you to talk about.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, I want to talk about this.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, there are a lot of questions I don't have any answers to, and and you're one of the few people that really knew her.
OTHERMALE: Elyse, you're breaking the mood! I just thought I'd levitate in here for a while.
OTHERFEMALE:How's the magic going, Mom? Not so well I had to get in here before your father tried to saw me in half.
LEADMALE:Well, it's getting a little late.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, thanks for dinner, Elyse.
LEADMALE:I'm going to head back to the hotel.
LEADMALE:Mallory would you like to get together tomorrow? Maybe, uh, go to a museum, do some shopping? Great, yeah.
LEADMALE:I'd love for you to meet Nick.
LEADFEMALE:All right, then it's a date.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Well, are you all right? Yeah, it's just  It's so weird.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, you know, standing here in-in my kitchen, talking to Rosalie's mom about Rosalie, and Rosalie is dead.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It just doesn't seem real.
LEADMALE:It takes a brave woman to come back and face all those memories.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I get the feeling she really needs to talk about it.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's a good thing that you're here for her.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE: 
SUPMALE:Sorry! Wrong chant.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Dad's going completely overboard with this magic business.
LEADMALE:He's all tied up in a chair, and he's bet Alex ten dollars that he can get out by dinnertime.
SUPFEMALE:This Houdini stuff has got to stop.
LEADMALE:Hey, h-h-hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, did you guys have a good time? - Oh - Oh, we had a great time.
SUPMALE:We went to the museum, we went shopping.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't mind, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh, bought a few presents for Mallory.
SUPMALE:I mean, she would look at these clothes like she was in love.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't resist.
LEADMALE:Boy, she knows her way around a mall - like no one I've ever seen.
LEADMALE:Oh That's my girl.
LEADMALE:You know that waterfront area? Boy, that's really built up a lot.
LEADMALE:Yeah, 400 stores under one roof.
SUPFEMALE:You can get almost all your shopping done there.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mom! Evelyn invited us to stay with her in New York next month.
SUPMALE:She said the best museums are in New York.
SUPMALE:Uh, did you know they call New York the Big Apple? Anybody know why? No.
SUPFEMALE:Why, Nick? Well, I-I don't know.
LEADMALE:I was hoping one of you would know.
LEADMALE: No fair, Dad! You cannot chew your way through the rope! Uh-uh.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:I escaped! Not only that, but I won't have to floss for a week.
LEADMALE:I know these are words you don't enjoy hearing, but pay up, son.
LEADMALE: - Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:This is way too easy.
LEADMALE: What I really need is a straight jacket.
OTHERMALE:You read my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm going to go put these things upstairs.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll give you a hand.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I really like that Nick.
LEADMALE:What's not to like? Rosalie seems very happy with him.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? I said she and Nick seem very happy together.
LEADFEMALE:You know, we stopped at the playground on the way home.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, boy, did that bring back a lot of memories.
LEADFEMALE:Seems like everything's memories now.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, are you okay? You know, I remember when Rosalie was a little girl.
SUPMALE:She ran inside to tell me about a a bird's nest that she'd found in the yard, and I don't know, I just I I'd had a hard day at work, and I remember I just I didn't hear what she said.
LEADMALE:So I got angry at her for tracking mud into the house.
LEADMALE:And she looked at me with her eyes so full of love.
LEADMALE:How could I yell at her? Um can you hand me that? Hmm? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You know, it just, uh it just gets to me sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it would.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? You know, something like that happens, and you, uh you don't think it's forever.
LEADMALE:You think that somehow they're going to come back.
SUPFEMALE:But they don't, you know? They don't.
SUPMALE:Okay, Alex.
LEADMALE:Pick a card any card.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Jennifer, Jennifer, just the person I want to see.
SUPFEMALE:Get in this box.
LEADMALE:What is this, Daddy Dearest? Come on.
SUPMALE:Steven, we're not gonna put our daughter in a magic box.
LEADMALE:Well, okay, Elyse, then you-you help me.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jen, get in.
LEADMALE:That's All right, then When I next open this box, my daughter Jennifer will be gone! Come one, come all, from far and near.
SUPFEMALE:You have seen my daughter dear.
OTHERFEMALE:I will make her disappear!  Well, that's-that's very good.
LEADFEMALE:Now-now bring her back.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:She's gone, she's gone, alack, alack! I will bring my daughter back.
LEADFEMALE: Yeah, okay.
LEADMALE: Okay.
LEADMALE:Jennifer? Jennifer, the trick worked.
LEADFEMALE:The, uh come out, now.
LEADFEMALE: She's really gone.
LEADFEMALE:Can you do that with Mallory? Uh, wh-wh-what's going on here? Where is Jennifer? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean you don't know? You have one child under a spell and the other one's vanished? I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I didn't know I was this good.
SUPMALE:Well, could you get him to walk? I think so.
OTHERFEMALE:Andrew, I command you to  Arise and walk.
LEADMALE:Levitatos, el niÃ±o.
LEADMALE:Come come 
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE: Hi, Mom.
OTHERMALE:Huh? - Nick's not here yet, is he? - Uh, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, gosh, I don't want to be late.
SUPFEMALE:Evelyn's taking us to the ballet tonight.
OTHERMALE:Oh, really? Well, that's six nights in a row - you've all been out together.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm really having a great time.
LEADMALE:I think it's good for her to be with someone my age.
SUPMALE:You know, we talk about Rosalie a lot, and I think it's really helping her.
SUPFEMALE:That's nice.
LEADMALE:Just try not to get too deeply involved here.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I can handle this.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to help her.
SUPMALE:Honey we cannot begin to imagine the kind of pain that Evelyn is going through.
SUPFEMALE:But I don't think it's your responsibility to take that pain away.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Rosalie and I were best friends I owe it to her.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you don't.
LEADFEMALE: Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:I can't just walk away from this 'cause I might be afraid.
LEADMALE:That's not right, either.
LEADFEMALE:Oh -  - Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hey, babe! - Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:You ready? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm kind of excited about this.
SUPFEMALE:I ain't never been to the ballet before.
LEADMALE:No kidding.
LEADMALE:We'll see you, Mom.
OTHERMALE:Good-bye, darling.
OTHERMALE:Have a good time.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE: You think I scared him enough to make him quit? I hate to say this, but I am really bored.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know if we should stay for the second half.
SUPMALE:Hey, I was enjoying it; I was sleeping good.
LEADFEMALE: What are we gonna say to Evelyn? Maybe we shouldn't say anything; maybe we should just go.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, we can't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, right, right, right, right.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADMALE: Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, could I get anybody something to drink? - I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Um, I'd love some orange juice.
OTHERMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:You know, and by the way, I love this ballet; very restful.
OTHERFEMALE: I'm sorry, it's not very good.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Do you see much ballet, Mallory? Oh, me? Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure.
SUPMALE:What was the last one you saw? Uh  Annie.
LEADFEMALE:It was great.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Rosalie and I used to come here to the ballet all the time.
OTHERMALE:Oh, she loved it.
SUPMALE:She'd say, as soon as the lights went down, she'd escape to another world.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Rosalie loved music.
LEADMALE:I remember in sixth grade she was the only girl with all the Partridge Family albums, even when it wasn't cool anymore.
SUPMALE:You know, she, uh wouldn't go to the ballet with me in New York.
LEADFEMALE:She wouldn't do anything with me; she just shut off.
LEADFEMALE:It was like she knew that it mattered to me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that doesn't sound like Rosalie.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure she had reasons.
LEADFEMALE:Don't defend her.
LEADMALE:She knew what she was doing, believe me.
LEADFEMALE:Um Evelyn, maybe this is not such a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I don't know if we should all stay for the second half.
SUPMALE:You're not leaving.
LEADMALE:What? You're staying till the end.
SUPMALE:Rosalie would have stayed till the end.
LEADMALE:I'm not Rosalie.
LEADMALE:I know that.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you think I know that? - Um, Evelyn - How could she have hurt herself like that? How could she have hurt me like that? What did I do? Evelyn, you can't blame yours She could've talked to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Anytime.
LEADFEMALE:I was there, I was ready to listen! You know how many times I went into her room, trying to get her to talk to me?! How could you leave me?! - What? - How could you do that to me, Rosalie?! - I'm not Rosalie.
OTHERMALE:You I knew I would be the first one to find you! How could you put me through that! You were my life! - Evelyn, I'm not her! - You meant everything to me! My God, I'm your mother! Evelyn?! Hey, uh, Mal, they didn't have orange juice, so I got you pineapple juice.
SUPMALE:I hope you don't mind.
LEADMALE:Um, I have to get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I didn't know it would bug you so much.
LEADFEMALE:No um, um, uh, take Evelyn home.
SUPMALE: Mal, she's crying.
LEADMALE:I I have to get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:All right, here you are, Andy a poodle! Thanks! My very own poodle!  What'll it be, Alex? A mouse? Peacock? Giraffe? - Dad - Hm? This has got to stop.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? Dad Dad, you're a well-educated guy and-and, and-and most of the time, you're pretty normal, but Dad, you got to face it you have a problem.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, it's just a hobby.
LEADMALE:No, Dad, Dad, Dad  It's an obsession.
LEADFEMALE:It's a compulsion.
SUPFEMALE:You have a compulsion for say it with me you have a compulsion for - birthday party tricks.
LEADFEMALE:Birthday party tricks.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, that's right, Dad.
LEADMALE:And it's got to stop the party is over.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, Alex.
SUPMALE:I need help.
LEADFEMALE:Attaboy, Dad.
SUPMALE:Attaboy, attaboy admitting it is the first step.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, come quick.
SUPMALE:Andy's poodle exploded.
LEADMALE:Oh, no! - Hey, Dad 
SUPFEMALE:Well Oh, God.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mom.
SUPMALE:Hi, hon.
LEADMALE: I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Must have been some ballet.
LEADMALE:I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE: That was Evelyn.
LEADFEMALE:It went too far.
SUPMALE:She started yelling at me.
LEADMALE:But she wasn't really yelling at me, she was yelling at me like I was, uh, Rosalie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:  I had this idea that I could help her, that I could fill this void that Rosalie left and I wanted to ease her pain.
LEADMALE:I think I wound up just hurting her more.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you didn't hurt Evelyn; Rosalie did.
LEADMALE: It's so weird! Rosalie and I were best friends.
SUPMALE:We wore the same clothes.
LEADMALE:We snuck in movies together.
OTHERMALE:We got caught smoking cigarettes in the girls' bathroom together.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me? You didn't hear about that, Mom? - No.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, it's water under the bridge.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't know how she could've made a decision like that.
SUPMALE:I mean, how could she have been so sad? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE: I mean, no matter how bad a day is, there's always tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there's always a chance that things can get better.
SUPMALE:I guess Rosalie didn't see it that way.
LEADMALE: She always saw things so differently.
LEADMALE:Even when we were little, I could tell she felt things much deeper than anyone else.
LEADMALE:She was so sensitive!  I remember, one time, we were in McDonald's and these girls started picking on her, and they were much bigger than us, so I stood in front of Rosalie and I took out a cherry pie and I threatened them with the hot fruit filling.
OTHERFEMALE:And they backed off, but Rosalie, she ran outside and she started to cry.
LEADMALE:But it was the way she was crying it's like it's like they hurt her so deeply, in her soul.
LEADFEMALE:It's like she couldn't help herself from hurting so deep.
OTHERMALE: Honey 
LEADMALE:Hello, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, can I talk to you? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, why don't you and I go in the living room, and you can tell me all about the ballet.
LEADMALE:You can start at the beginning, okay? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, first, the lights went down, and then the music started up real soft.
OTHERMALE:And then one person in the audience coughed, and then another and another.
OTHERFEMALE:And that was a real nice surprise, because I was not aware that it was gonna be an audience participation.
LEADFEMALE:What I did tonight was unforgivable.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't be her, Evelyn.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what I was doing.
LEADFEMALE:You're such a beautiful girl, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:You're so full of light and life, and I guess, when Rosalie died, I thought I'd never see that light again.
LEADMALE:Why did you come back here, Evelyn? I guess I wanted to turn back time.
LEADMALE:I wanted to try to remember when everything was okay.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if we hadn't moved away things would still be okay.
LEADFEMALE:I keep thinking, if I'd just done something different, this never would have happened.
LEADFEMALE:You can't think like that, Evelyn it wasn't your fault.
SUPMALE:I guess I spend so much time thinking about the past because I just can't bear to face tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Well, you have been, every day.
LEADFEMALE:You know my biggest fear?  God what am I saying this to you for? - I've done enough damage already.
LEADFEMALE:No, Evelyn it's tell me it's okay.
LEADMALE:My biggest fear is that I'll forget her.
OTHERMALE:That I'll wake up one morning and I won't remember the sight of her face or the sound of her voice or what it felt like, you know, when she was a little girl and she used to put her hand in mine.
LEADFEMALE:So I struggle every day  to try to keep those thoughts very clear in my mind.
SUPFEMALE:And I guess you were part of all that.
LEADFEMALE: I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be.
SUPFEMALE: Rosalie was the most precious thing in my life.
LEADMALE:I guess I'm not ready to stop loving her.
LEADMALE:Well, you don't have to.
SUPMALE:I mean you can still love the spirit of who she was.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't been able to do that.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Want to buy a raffle ticket, win a trip to Mexico? It's for my school.
SUPMALE:Ah, that sounds good.
LEADFEMALE:How much are they? Two dollars.
LEADFEMALE:Yikes! Two dollars! Wow.
OTHERFEMALE:Two dollars.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know if I can swing that.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see.
SUPMALE:Boy, it's really fat.
SUPFEMALE:You must be loaded.
LEADMALE:See that? See what happens? Just a minute.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You want to buy a raffle ticket, win a trip to Mexico? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:If I sell more than the other kids, I get a bike.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, in that case, Andy, I'll take three.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll take three, also.
LEADFEMALE:Alex only took one, and that was a struggle.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I heard his wallet go off.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hey, gang.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Do you think I should wear one of these to my high school reunion? I-I wore this to my graduation party, and this one to my prom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mom, I love these.
LEADMALE:I love antique dresses.
SUPMALE:Excuse me? Mom, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't honestly think you're going to fit into either of those, do you? Mom, what I mean is, they-they they look they look too big for you.
LEADFEMALE:You must have been beefy in high school.
SUPFEMALE:What are you going to wear, Dad? Whichever one your mother doesn't want.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, cut it out, Steven.
SUPMALE:He's just grumpy 'cause he has to go to the reunion.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why shouldn't I be? I don't know anyone.
OTHERMALE:Everyone will be clamoring around her.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be sitting in the corner, sucking up punch with some nerds.
LEADMALE:This is so exciting, Mom your high school reunion.
LEADFEMALE:I bet all your old boyfriends are going to be there.
LEADMALE:No, I didn't really have many dates.
LEADMALE:I was just waiting for my Prince Charming to come around.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Did he? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Elyse, you were the most popular girl in your high school.
LEADMALE:You had millions of dates.
OTHERMALE:Not really.
SUPFEMALE:What about this Roger Erdman guy, huh? He's been calling all week.
OTHERMALE:He insisted on coming over to see you today.
LEADMALE:"Eggy" Erdman? Please! He was my next door neighbor.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute Roger Erdman.
LEADMALE:Roger Erdman of Erdman Enterprises? That's the one.
LEADMALE:Mom, that man is a genius! His-his-his computer software company grossed $75 million last year.
LEADFEMALE:So what? So So you knew Roger Erdman, and you married Dad?! Why? All right, that's it! I'm not going! Gown or no gown.
SUPMALE:I can't believe you knew Roger Erdman, and you didn't tell me! The things you keep from me! You Who else do you know? Lee lacocca? No, just Eggy.
LEADMALE:Well, what was he like? Well, you know, he was kind of a sweet, awkward guy.
SUPFEMALE:He had the locker next to mine.
OTHERFEMALE:He could not close that locker without catching some part of his body in it.
LEADMALE:He was a strange character.
LEADMALE:He was really a nerd.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:I know the type.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, do you guys mind if I hang out here for a while? It's kind of lonely at my house.
LEADFEMALE:Where are your parents? They went away for the weekend on a skiing trip.
OTHERMALE:What about your girlfriend? She went with them.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my! - Well, here he is.
LEADMALE:Eggy! - Elysey! Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:He's a little nerdy, isn't he? so there I was in school, walking down the halls, you know, carrying my books.
OTHERMALE:I always had a ton of books with me, because I had a lot of trouble opening my locker.
LEADFEMALE:Closing it was no picnic, either, actually.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, I always - Uh, excuse me.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Um, need some more coffee? - Oh, thank you.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, be careful! - Oh, oh, oh! - Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:There we go.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:So I-I usually brought everything I owned with me.
LEADMALE:You know, I'd go down the halls with my books, clothes, microscope, a dozen handkerchiefs, my saxophone and an assortment of dried fruits.
SUPMALE:I should have had one of those, uh, shopping carts, but I wanted to be cool, you know.
LEADFEMALE:That is cool.
LEADFEMALE:I'm-I'm getting rid of my shopping cart.
SUPFEMALE:You remind me of someone.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I was a real bully-magnet at school, you know, a target for book dumping.
LEADMALE:Even the school nurse would get in a shot now and again.
LEADMALE:But I could always count on good old Elysey to help me out, to protect me, to tell me to stand up for myself.
SUPMALE:Do you remember uh, Vinnie Vinnie D'Agostino? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he was tough.
LEADMALE:I remember once he held your head underwater at the public pool.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, he did, and it was uncalled for, considering he was the lifeguard on duty.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Erdman Mr.
LEADMALE:Erdman, may I ask you a question? Certainly, but please call me Eggy.
LEADMALE:I prefer not to, sir.
OTHERMALE:I-I-I I don't think that that that's suitable for someone of your standing in the business community.
SUPMALE:Uh, I could call you I could call you Mr.
LEADMALE:Eggy.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:That's what my Mom calls me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm intrigued by your wealth.
LEADFEMALE:Um Where did it come from, how did you get it, and, um will you share it with me? Alex, I'll be honest with you.
LEADMALE:I-I never dreamed I'd have this much money, you know? Uh, as a matter of fact, when I was a kid, I was actually a bit of a nerd.
LEADMALE:But I was a tremendous nerd.
SUPMALE:What was that like? Take a wild guess, Skip.
LEADFEMALE:Well, anyway, it would have been miserable if it weren't for Elyse Donnelly, the most popular girl in the school, and she was my friend.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You want to buy a raffle ticket? Oh, sure.
OTHERMALE:Uh, how much are they? - Two dollars.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, two dollars.
LEADMALE:All right, I'll take one.
LEADFEMALE:Just one? Alex said you were loaded.
LEADFEMALE:He's confused.
LEADFEMALE:He's confused.
SUPMALE:What I what I said was that you may be quite well off.
SUPMALE:You said $75 million, not counting what he's probably hiding from the IRS.
LEADFEMALE:The things that come out of this kid's mouth, I'm I'm telling you.
SUPFEMALE:So I just used to stay up in my room and make up all these imaginary games and puzzles and tricks, and you know, they became the nucleus of my Ledgermatic Computer Software System.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Aha.
LEADMALE:Getting back to your wealth Alex, come on, I've described it to you in every way possible.
LEADFEMALE:It's-it's large, it's paper, it's green, let's greet it now money! Hey! Yeah.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Can I ask you a question? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, um, do you ever do you ever just kind of lay it out and-and roll around in it? I bathe in it.
LEADMALE:Alex, please, I don't want to talk about money.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right, all right.
SUPMALE:Um, this this, uh this this is not about money.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's a giant breakthrough in our relationship.
LEADMALE:This is about life.
OTHERFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADMALE:Will you adopt me? Come on, Alex, you have a-a full, complete, loving family here.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I think I've gotten everything I can out of the situation.
SUPFEMALE:Let's run away together.
LEADMALE:Look, you may not want to hear this, but money is not all that it's cracked up to be.
SUPFEMALE:See It is not a sure ticket to happiness.
LEADMALE:All you guys with money say that.
LEADMALE:And then you go home to your mansions, and you laugh hysterically.
LEADMALE:I want to be with you guys.
LEADMALE:I want to laugh with you.
LEADFEMALE:I am so ready to be rich.
LEADMALE:You have no idea.
LEADMALE:No, I have a good sense of it, Alex.
LEADMALE:Why don't I just give you a couple of million, we'll call it even? I love you.
SUPMALE:Uh, you knew him before Dad, and yet you Why am I torturing myself? You have a beautiful family there, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Steven, Andrew, the girls young Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Scrooge.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, I can't believe that you're actually here in my house.
OTHERMALE:Well, look at you! You look so grown up.
LEADFEMALE:Your hair is combed, your shoes are actually on the right feet Yes.
OTHERMALE:That's one of the advantages of being rich.
OTHERFEMALE:I hired a man that takes care of that before I leave the house.
LEADFEMALE:He's very good.
LEADFEMALE:So happy for you, for everything that's happened.
LEADFEMALE:For all the success you've achieved.
OTHERFEMALE:I always told you you could do it, didn't I? Yes, you did, Elysey.
SUPMALE:You were the only one.
OTHERFEMALE:So, you proud of your little Eggy? You bet! My God, Elyse, you're more beautiful than I remember.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, you say that to all the girls.
LEADFEMALE:There are no other girls.
LEADFEMALE:There's only you.
LEADMALE:Oh, Eggy.
LEADMALE:Do you remember we did our act on the talent night of the Senior Follies? Yeah Remember, we-we wore those matching outfits? - -God, those were beautiful dresses.
SUPFEMALE:You had a run in your stocking.
LEADMALE:That night is so clear to me! Uh, it was in the gymnasium, the lights went down, and the announcer got up and 
SUPFEMALE:"Attention seniors, seniors, seniors "And now, now the South Sandusky, Sandusky "High School Entertainment Committee, Committee "proudly presents "sents sents Elyse Donnelly, ly, ly, ly "and Roger "Is this thing on? I don't think it's on.

LEADMALE:Well, my parents never liked that sort of thing.
SUPMALE:Then then we rushed off into the wings, and and you kissed me.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Did I? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Right here.
LEADFEMALE:For a long time, I was thinking of having it framed.
LEADFEMALE:It was such fun.
SUPMALE:Let's do it again.
SUPFEMALE:We've got to do it again.
LEADFEMALE:I've been practicing.
LEADFEMALE:Do it again remember? We did it! It's over! I mean, come on, we're not in high school anymore.
OTHERMALE:You got to grow up.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, don't look at me like that, Eggy.
SUPMALE:You don't think I've grown up, Elyse? I-I didn't mean anything by it.
LEADMALE:I - You're sorry I came, though, huh? No, I'm not.
LEADMALE:I'm glad to see you.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that it's it's 25 years later, I don't feel like splish- splashing with you, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:You say that to a Doo-Wop Twin? You have changed.
SUPMALE:Boy! Let's-let's drop it, okay? Let me make you a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a raw egg for dessert you've always loved that.
LEADFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I've eaten.
OTHERMALE:And if you haven't noticed, Elyse Donnelly, I have grown up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not the same Eggy you knew.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a new, improved Eggy.
LEADFEMALE:One that won't be bothering you with silly little memories of a time you'd evidently rather forget.
OTHERFEMALE:Far as I'm concerned, high school never existed.
LEADFEMALE:See you at the reunion! I can't believe I feel so nervous about this.
OTHERMALE:What if no one remembers me? How do you think I feel? There's no chance anyone's gonna remember me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just afraid someone will remember me and lock me in the girls' bathroom all night.
OTHERFEMALE:Probably go sign in here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, excuse me.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I Elyse Donnelly! I can't believe it! You look exactly the same.
OTHERFEMALE:Bob Dunphy.
OTHERFEMALE:Bob! Hi! Hi! Hi, Elyse.

LEADMALE:Remember me? The prom? After the prom? Danny Wasserstein.
SUPMALE:Hey, listen, Eggy, I'm really sorry about holding you underwater in the community pool that time.
SUPFEMALE:It's no problem, Vinnie; I was asking for it sitting on a beach chair, reading the Bible.
SUPMALE:Welcome back, South Sandusky Class of '63! And now it's time to meet our class celebrities.

LEADMALE:Wh-Where is it, down? It's out there somewhere.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't care, as long as you know where it is.
LEADFEMALE:Buenos dÃ­as, my little burrito.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, buenos dÃ­as to you, my young and faithful enchilada.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy won the raffle at Andy's school.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait a min Andy! Andy, you told me I was gonna win that.
LEADMALE:I tell everybody that.
LEADMALE:Bandito.
LEADMALE:Hi, gang.
LEADMALE:Hey, how did it go? Not that great.
OTHERFEMALE:I was a big hit, but, uh your mother and Eggy had a little run-in.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, how could you?! The man is a millionaire! Maybe a trip to Mexico would make you feel better? I don't know, I'm-I'm not in the mood.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Honey, I think we'll all be in the other room.
LEADMALE:How about you, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton? Would you like to go to Mexico with me? Which weekend is it, Skippy? Whatever she did, she didn't mean it.
LEADMALE:Forgive me, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:When I, when I saw you, it brought everything back.
LEADFEMALE:I was 16 again, and so were you.
LEADMALE:We're not, though.
LEADFEMALE:You know, we're not 16, we're well, I'm almost 30.
LEADFEMALE:And strangely, I'm 41.
LEADMALE:You were always a little different.
SUPMALE:Seeing you has brought this all back to me, too, Eggy you know, growing up together, the old neighborhood, your old apartment on Steuben Avenue.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Apartment 4-A.
LEADMALE:My parents, next-door, in apartment 4-B.
LEADFEMALE:I used to wait for you at the bus stop to come back from cheerleading practice.
SUPMALE:Remember? I used to carry your pom-poms.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah - And sometimes the guys would whistle at me.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh - And sometimes I'd whistle back.
SUPMALE:And when we got home, we'd practice the cheers together.
LEADFEMALE:You remember? - Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Remember? S-A-N-D Please don't do the whole thing.
OTHERMALE:Usky! - Thanks.
SUPMALE:I'm-I'm just I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was way, way out of line.
LEADFEMALE:I-I-I I got crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:I had no business doing what I did; no business.
SUPMALE:I'm a married woman.
SUPFEMALE:How serious is it? Danny Wasserstein and I are very much in love.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Of course I do, and I I'm very happy about it; I really, I am.
SUPMALE:It's what you deserve.
LEADMALE:Oh, Eggy.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that I've thought about you all these years.
SUPFEMALE:And every time I dreamt about the moment we'd meet it always ended in a kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've thought about you, too, and the moment that we would meet, and it always ended in a minor injury.
SUPMALE:You thought about me? Really? Well, yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, I love that.
LEADFEMALE:See, when I think about you, I think that all my success and the great things that have happened to me have a lot to do with you.
LEADFEMALE:Your having believed in Eggy meant the world to me.
SUPMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:You weren't hard to believe in.
SUPFEMALE:You were a good friend.
LEADMALE:You're definitely, seriously married, huh? That's what I always loved about you you could always make me laugh.
LEADMALE:You could always bring out the silly side in me.
SUPMALE:I could bring out the silly side in Attila the Hun.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know how, when I was a little kid, I used to always take myself a little too seriously.
LEADFEMALE:I could never have done "Splish Splash" with anyone but you.
SUPFEMALE:You-you taught me it was okay to be silly, that it could be fun.
LEADMALE:I've carried that throughout my whole life.
OTHERFEMALE:It helps when you have four kids.
SUPFEMALE:So there's still a little Eggy left in your life, huh? There is.
LEADMALE:That's good.
LEADMALE:I like that.
OTHERFEMALE:So you made me believe in myself and I made you silly.
LEADFEMALE:It's a fair trade, believe me.
LEADFEMALE:It was great to see you, Elysey.
SUPFEMALE:It was great to see you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Eggy This one I'm definitely framing.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Here we go! Flapjacks a la PBS! What makes them "flapjacks a la PBS," Dad? Well I don't really know.
LEADMALE:I guess it's because they're good and good for you.
SUPFEMALE:They're a nutritious start to a nonprofit day.
SUPMALE: Alex, you know, it's not polite to type at the table.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Let me use the top of your head.
LEADFEMALE:I need a flat surface.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Well, I'm helping out my younger brother.
LEADFEMALE:See, they're having class elections in Andy's kindergarten, so I am typing up a rÃ©sumÃ© for him that will assure success.
LEADMALE:"In 1987, Andrew Keaton served "as director of nutritional unit disbursement in preschool.
LEADMALE:" What is that? Milk monitor, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody, guess who is "Buddy for the Day" in kindergarten.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:No, not me.
OTHERMALE:No, it's Andy.
LEADMALE:See, whenever a new child comes to the school, the teacher picks one of the most responsible kids in the class, and that child gets to show the other child around school for the day.
LEADFEMALE:It sounds like orientation at Grant College.
LEADMALE: - Hey, congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:Buddy for the Day.
LEADMALE:This is gonna go right into your rÃ©sumÃ©.
SUPMALE:When was Andy ambassador to the United Nations? It's too much? Too You're really not kidding anyone, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:He is in kindergarten.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Last week I was offered chairman of the board of Occidental Petroleum.
LEADFEMALE:Would've taken it, too.
LEADFEMALE:He had to go to Mitsy Lepman's birthday party.
LEADMALE: Good morning, everybody! - Hey, hi, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:All right there, Andy, ready to go to school? Oh, he's in an exchange program with Grant College? No, your parents asked me to take Andy to school today.
LEADMALE:No, Skippy, I asked you to pick up Andy after school this afternoon.
SUPMALE:Alex is taking him this morning.
LEADMALE:We really appreciate you doing this, Skip.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't mention it, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:In many ways, I consider myself part of this family.
LEADFEMALE:Except of course, I don't look like any of you.
LEADFEMALE:And I live in a different house.
SUPMALE:And I have a different last name.
LEADMALE:And a different first name.
LEADFEMALE:That's nice, Skip.
SUPMALE:In many ways, we consider you part of this family, too.
SUPMALE:Don't we? Pass the toast, Dad? Oh, wow, does this bring back memories.
SUPMALE:Andy, my first day of kindergarten I cried.
OTHERFEMALE:Were you scared, Alex? No, no, I just found out they weren't gonna pay us.
LEADMALE: I remember I had my first crush when I was six.
SUPMALE:Marjorie Hansen.
LEADFEMALE:I used to write her notes all the time.
OTHERFEMALE:One day, the, uh, the teacher stood up there, and read my note to the whole class.
LEADFEMALE:What did you say? "Roses are red, violets are blue.
LEADMALE:I'm into pork bellies, should I buy some for you?" Oh, good morning, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Alex.
LEADMALE: Good morning, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Metcalf.
LEADMALE:Good morning, boys, and it's Miss Metcalf.
OTHERFEMALE:Why haven't you got married yet? Well, Andy, um Actually I was married, but it didn't work out.
LEADMALE:Sometimes I would come home and he'd be Well, that's a different story.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, go on.
LEADMALE:Oh, Andy, um, why don't you join the group? We're just about ready to get started.
LEADFEMALE:But what happened to your husband? I will tell the whole class at story time.
LEADMALE:Okay?  I'm not gonna be able to make it to story time, so Alex, how have you been? Oh, well, I can't complain.
LEADMALE:Straight A's, dean's list I'm a senior over at Leland.
LEADMALE:Oh, good we're very proud of you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Miss Metcalf, uh any any word on that grade change yet? Alex  I'm keenly aware of your campaign to have that grade changed, but, uh, it's been over 15 years and your teacher at the time Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Wills has died.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, she'd do anything to keep from changing that grade.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Miss Metcalf, I tied my shoes correctly that day.
OTHERMALE:I mean, she was just steamed because I brought my television set to watch the Watergate hearings.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, it's too late there is nothing I can do.
SUPFEMALE:All right, okay, hey, fine, fine.
LEADMALE:I don't get into a good graduate program, I'm suing this school.
LEADMALE:Oh, sorry.
OTHERMALE:Oh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, hi.
LEADMALE:Good morning, Josh, and welcome to the class.
LEADFEMALE: Are you my teacher? Yes! I'm your teacher.
OTHERMALE:Andy, sweetheart, you want to come here for a second? Andy, I'd like you to meet Mrs.
SUPMALE:Richards.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Andy, nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:And this is Josh.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Andy, Josh can't hear.
LEADMALE:But he speaks by signing.
LEADMALE:It's called sign language.
LEADFEMALE:See, right now, he said that he's very happy to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:I would like to say, "I'm very happy to meet him," but how can I if he can't hear? MRS.
LEADMALE: Well, he can't he can't hear you.
LEADMALE:But he can read your lips a little bit.
SUPFEMALE:So, you can talk to him.
LEADFEMALE: Josh, I'm very glad to meet you.
LEADMALE:Is that okay? MISS 
OTHERMALE:See? He's signing, "Yes.
LEADMALE:" Okay, now, Andy, you're gonna be Josh's buddy for the day.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you like to see our goldfish? Oh, wait.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Well, I can see he's in good hands.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Andy's a very sweet kid.
OTHERMALE:I think they're gonna be good friends.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got to go to work.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Thanks a lot, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Hi, Andy.
LEADMALE:Hi, Eugene.
LEADMALE:This is Josh.
LEADFEMALE:What's he doing? He talks with his hands.
OTHERMALE:He can't hear.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean he can't hear? Let's see if he can hear this.
LEADFEMALE: Hey, kid! Get out of the way! I want to see the fish! Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Move it!  You guys stop it! Don't do that to him! All right, all right, all right, children, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go sit back down.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's get back to work.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't feel bad.
LEADMALE:It's okay, Skippy, everybody gets lost.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, well, so we went a little out of our way.
SUPFEMALE:It was nice driving around Columbus, wasn't it? Cincinnati was very nice, too.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, it was.
LEADMALE:And best of all, it gave me a chance to learn sign language.
SUPFEMALE:My name? Okay, S K I P P - Y.
SUPMALE:Y.
LEADFEMALE:Two Ps are you sure? No wonder I never get any mail.
LEADFEMALE:Josh, you want to color? Oh, you know what's funny? When I was a kid, there were certain things I didn't do very well.
OTHERMALE:Uh, coloring sports, math, spelling, gargling.
SUPFEMALE:But as you get older it doesn't matter as much.
LEADMALE:There's so many new things I can't do.
OTHERMALE:Do you like this? Cat.
LEADFEMALE:I had a cat once.
LEADFEMALE:His name was, uh, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:And sometimes when my mother would call me to dinner, he would get there first.
OTHERFEMALE:So I would get his Tender Vittles.
SUPMALE:When Eugene and the other kids made fun of you today, were you sad? I would never make fun of you.
LEADMALE:What happened? - Eugene and the other kids made fun of him today.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's not nice.
SUPMALE:Believe me, I know what it's like to be teased.
LEADFEMALE:Josh, are you sad because you can't hear? No.
LEADFEMALE:Then I guess I shouldn't be sad either.
SUPFEMALE: Ah, I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:Hi, are you Skippy? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'm Josh's mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, um - Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Did you have fun today? Yes.
SUPMALE:What did you do? Andy, Josh says you were a great buddy for the day.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome.
OTHERMALE:Uh, Skippy, Josh says the next time you pick him up, he wants to go to Michigan what does that mean? He's just kidding we weren't that close to Michigan.
SUPFEMALE:Um, we were closer to Florida.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Tell Andy you'll see him tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we're going, going home, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Here you go.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Skippy, friends are supposed to share, right? Right.
LEADFEMALE:So if my friend has a problem, it's my problem, too, right? Right, especially if it's a good friend.
LEADMALE:Now I know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, you might want to check these answers with someone who's actually had friends.
LEADMALE:Hey, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, how did it go, Skip? Any trouble picking up Andy at school? Well, uh, the picking up part went fairly smoothly, but then on the way home, we saw a little bit more of the Midwest than we had planned.
SUPFEMALE:Andy, I see you had your milk and cookies? Yeah, yeah, he sure did.
LEADMALE:And, uh, that reminds me you're low on milk.
LEADFEMALE:Chocolate syrup, peanut butter and jelly.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll try to restock before your next visit.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:It means a lot to me.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:So, Andy, what would you rather have for dinner pizza or your mother's special tofu-plankton nut loaf? It's pizza, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:So, how was school today, Andy? You okay? Something wrong? Are you okay, buddy? What's up? - I got pizza.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I got pizza with pepperoni, sausage and anchovies.
SUPMALE:And for dessert, I've got pizza with Alka-Seltzer.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you forget something? Oh, no, no, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Got it right here.
LEADFEMALE:Your health pizza no cheese, extra seaweed.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
SUPMALE:Alex, I gave you $40.
OTHERFEMALE:Might there not be some change forthcoming? Well, Dad, there was gas.
LEADMALE:It was my gas.
LEADFEMALE:It was my car.
LEADMALE:All right, okay, well, th-there was my delivery fee.
SUPMALE:There was my, uh my hanging out in the pizzeria fee.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, and then, then, of course, there was my tip.
OTHERFEMALE:So, actually, Dad, the way I figure it, you owe me $1.
SUPMALE:35.
LEADMALE:Have you got any change, Elyse? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Mom? - I'll go call Andy for dinner.
LEADMALE: Oh.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, honey.
LEADFEMALE:We want to talk to you about something.
SUPMALE:What did we do? - Oh, no, it's not you guys.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Something has really been bothering Andy lately.
LEADFEMALE:I know what it is.
LEADMALE:What is it? Gold.
LEADMALE:Dropped $14 on the London market today.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe that's part of it.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:There's got to be something else.
LEADFEMALE:Egg futures.
SUPMALE:They're down, too.
LEADFEMALE:There must be something else.
LEADMALE:It's not like Andy.
SUPMALE:Something is wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, all we know is that he went to school this morning, and then Skippy brought him home.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, Mom, that's it right there.
LEADMALE:He spent time with Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, after that, it-it takes three, four hours before the power of speech returns.
OTHERMALE:I'll give Skippy a call.
SUPMALE:Maybe he knows something.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I'll call him anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Andy just hasn't been himself.
LEADFEMALE:He wouldn't talk to us, and then he just went upstairs to his room and went to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:I know what it is.
LEADMALE:It's the it's a rumor going around that if a Democrat gets into office, interest rates are going to skyrocket.
LEADFEMALE:You'd make a fine child psychologist, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE: Hello.
LEADMALE:Skippy, it's Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Yes, from across the street.
LEADMALE:Uh Your neighbor.
SUPFEMALE:Would you mind coming over here for a moment? Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Good-bye.
LEADMALE:Andy, look what we've got here.
SUPMALE:Pizza, your favorite.
LEADMALE:What kind do you want? You want sausage, or you want mushroom? 
SUPMALE:I bet I can get him to say, "no.
LEADMALE:" Andy, how would you like some alfalfa sprouts and gluten on your pizza? He's definitely not talking.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, all right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Don't panic.
SUPMALE:Don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:Don't panic, okay? Watch.
LEADFEMALE:Andy who's your favorite brother? Definitely a problem here.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I got it.
SUPFEMALE:I got it.
LEADFEMALE:I got it.
SUPMALE:Ring! Ring! The phone! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ring.
LEADFEMALE:Ring.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Oh, just a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Andy, it's for you.
SUPMALE:But, Andy, there's a call for you.
OTHERMALE:I'll take it.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:It's not for you.
SUPMALE:I'll take it anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:No, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:This is her brother.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, yes, we'll keep her here until you arrive with the net and the tranquilizer gun.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, look.
OTHERFEMALE: Oh, Skippy! Look, when you brought Andy home today, did anything happen that might have upset him? I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, let's see.
SUPMALE:Uh, when I met him at school, he was busy on the jungle gym, so I played with the blocks for a while.
LEADFEMALE:If this yields any useful information, I'm transferring to Grant College.
LEADMALE:Skippy, what happened after you left kindergarten? I went to the first grade.
LEADMALE:He means today, Skippy.
SUPMALE:Let's see.
OTHERMALE:When-when we came home, uh, Andy and Josh Josh? Who is Josh? That's Andy's friend.
LEADMALE:His buddy for the day.
LEADMALE:And they came home together? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:We had milk and cookies and colored and, uh, Andy drew a cat while Josh drew a goldfish.
LEADMALE:Skippy, work with me on this.
LEADFEMALE:What the heck are you doing with your hands? It's sign language.
LEADFEMALE:Josh taught me.
SUPFEMALE:He's Deaf.
LEADMALE: 
LEADMALE:Oh Didn't I mention that? No.
OTHERMALE:Then, I, uh, I probably also didn't mention that some of the kids in Andy's class, they were teasing Josh.
OTHERFEMALE:Was Andy involved? Yeah, he stood up for Josh.
SUPMALE:He seemed really upset about it.
LEADMALE:Is-is there any more to the story? Is there anything else you want to say? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Is this pizza for everybody? Now this is the sign for want.
SUPFEMALE:I want a car.
LEADFEMALE:I want ice cream.
OTHERMALE:Yes? Okay.
OTHERMALE:So if you want Josh to pass something to you, this is the sign that you use.
SUPMALE:Does anyone have a special word that they'd like to know? Uh Louise.
OTHERFEMALE:Pencil.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Pencil.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, pencil.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Anybody else? What about "teacher"? Teacher.
LEADFEMALE:Teacher.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Yes? How about recess? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE: No.
LEADMALE:I don't mean the sign.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, how about recess? In just a couple of minutes, Eugene.
SUPFEMALE:All right, now, class, I think that we should thank Josh for teaching us these signs, okay? 
LEADMALE:Thank you, Josh.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:That's great.
LEADMALE:Okay, how about some free time? Good.
LEADFEMALE: Josh Do you feel like talking yet, Andy? Uh, well, um, after this period we can go into my office and we can talk about you not talking.
OTHERMALE:Uh, but you'll probably not want to talk about it, but you can talk about it if you want to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk later.
LEADFEMALE:Are you mad at me, Andy? Why aren't you talking to me? Because he's a dummy, just like his friend.
LEADMALE: MISS 
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
SUPMALE:I'm so glad that you could come today.
SUPFEMALE:Josh's mother is coming, too, and I figure that together, we can figure out Andy's problem.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we hope so, too.
LEADMALE:Uh, after we wrap that up, Alex asked us if we'd have a conference with you.
LEADMALE:Something about a grade change? He is 22 years old and he still can't believe that he got a "B" in shoe-tying? I think he's serious about it.
SUPFEMALE:He's asked for a makeup test.
LEADFEMALE:MISS 
LEADMALE:Oh, excuse me.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Richards.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Glad you could come.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Uh, these are the Keatons.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:This is Josh's mother.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Very nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, excuse me.
OTHERMALE:I think I see a tug-of-war breaking out.
OTHERFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Richards, we really appreciate your coming here this afternoon.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's no problem.
LEADMALE:Look, I can't help but feel responsible for Andy not talking.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, please don't.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that Andy's never had a friend before who was, uh you know.
LEADFEMALE:I think what Steven means is that Andy just has no experience playing with someone who's well, who's Deaf.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Um I don't know, for some reason it's difficult to talk about Josh being, uh Deaf.
LEADMALE:Andy stopped talking maybe I should, too.
LEADFEMALE:Don't feel bad, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:The word "deaf" is not an insult.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I think we just we're just afraid we're going to say the wrong thing.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPMALE:It happens all the time.
SUPMALE:You know, that's what's so remarkable about Andy.
LEADMALE:See, a lot of kids would be scared off by Josh, and Andy's been a real friend.
LEADMALE:You can be very proud of him.
LEADMALE:He's quite a boy.
LEADMALE:There's something I'd like to show you.
LEADMALE:It's a painting that both Josh and Andy drew.
LEADMALE:It's of the both of them.
OTHERFEMALE:Huh.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Right here.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see why we need to learn sign language just because the new kid can't hear.
SUPMALE:I think sign language is fun.
SUPFEMALE:I don't.
LEADMALE:I don't think deaf kids should be allowed in a normal class.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you guys be quiet? Why? He can't hear us.
LEADMALE:We can say anything we want.
LEADMALE:But Andy can hear you, and they're friends.
LEADMALE:See, he's getting really mad at you.
SUPFEMALE:Big deal! What's he going to do, not yell at us?  Hey, everybody, want to see something funny? Why don't you go home? You don't belong here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, get out of here, stupid-head.
LEADFEMALE:  Hey! Hey, hey, hey! - Come on! Come on! - Eugene, Eugene, Dougie, get over here.
LEADMALE:He started it! He started it! Andy, there is no excuse for this.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what is going on? Hey, how'd it go, buddy? Andy.
LEADFEMALE:He's still not talking? Nope.
LEADMALE:Of all my siblings to give up talking, why did it have to be him? I don't know how much we accomplished.
SUPFEMALE:We talked to Andy's teacher.
SUPMALE:We talked to Josh's mother.
LEADFEMALE:And then a fight broke out.
LEADMALE:Did you win, Dad? I wasn't one of the combatants.
SUPMALE:It was between Andy and another boy, and it was just so sad to see those children fighting Josh sitting there, knowing they were fighting over him.
SUPMALE:You know, there was a time in my life when I didn't talk.
OTHERMALE:Really? I'm sorry I missed that, Skippy.
OTHERMALE:When, exactly, were you speechless? From age zero to two.
LEADFEMALE:I think I could actually speak back then.
SUPMALE:There just wasn't anything on my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so basically nothing's changed.
SUPMALE:I really don't know what we're going to do.
OTHERFEMALE:Obviously, Andy's not speaking out of sympathy for Josh, which is really a very sweet and caring thing to do, but how do we get him to speak without squelching his noble impulses? Have you tried offering cash yet?  Oh, excuse me.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Richards, come in.
LEADMALE:Hi, Josh.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Come in.
SUPFEMALE:How are you? I'd like you to meet our children.
SUPFEMALE:This is Mallory and Jennifer and Alex.
LEADMALE:Uh, Skippy's not ours.
LEADMALE:Um, where's Andy? Oh, he's upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go get him.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Josh, I want to thank you for being such a good friend to Andy.
LEADFEMALE:What did he say? He said, "You like money.
OTHERMALE:" So Andy mentioned me to you.
SUPMALE: Andy Andy, thank you very much for standing up for Josh today.
LEADMALE:But we'd all like it very much if you would start to speak again.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, honey.
OTHERMALE:We love you so much.
LEADMALE:We really want to hear your sweet little voice.
LEADMALE:Andy, you're my best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for sticking up for me today but you don't have to.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't matter that I can't hear.
LEADMALE:Please talk, Andy.
SUPFEMALE: You're my best friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh - Oh, that's so great.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Richards, you have yourself quite a young man there
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Alex, can't you give us a hand? Sorry, Mom, it just seems kind of silly to clean up before company comes.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's just gonna get messy again.
LEADMALE:Come on, your cousin June hasn't been here in three years.
SUPMALE:I don't want her coming into a messy house.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? It was messy when she left.
LEADFEMALE:I just got off the phone with Jennifer.
LEADMALE:She's still at Adam's house doing the science project.
OTHERFEMALE:She said she'll be here soon.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder what's taking them so long.
SUPFEMALE:They should've finished that science project by now.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, they're trying to get fruit flies to mate and it's taking longer than they thought.
SUPMALE:You know, I'm a little offended by that project.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I think Jennifer should learn about fruit flies on the street like I did.
OTHERMALE:I wish she'd hurry because your father and June should be back from the airport any minute now.
OTHERMALE:They probably stopped off for a good ol' American hamburger.
LEADFEMALE:You know, that English food's pretty disgusting.
LEADFEMALE:That's a very narrow view, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Just because English food is different than ours doesn't mean it's terrible.
LEADMALE:Come on, Ma, how would you characterize a place that serves ox tails and kidney pies for breakfast? Disgusting.
SUPFEMALE:I mean "different," hey.
LEADMALE:I'm so excited that June's coming.
LEADFEMALE:I can't imagine what it's like to study in England.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't even know what it's like to study in America.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look who's here.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, hi! - Hi, June, hi! - Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? - Hey.
SUPMALE:There she is.
SUPMALE:Hi, June.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Sorry, we're late we stopped off for hamburgers.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I couldn't wait English food is disgusting.
SUPMALE:Nah, it's just different.
OTHERMALE:June, you look great.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
SUPMALE:All you do, too.
LEADMALE:The baby.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Is that Andrew? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Oh, he's so cute.
LEADMALE:Where's Jennifer? - Oh, she'll be here soon.
LEADMALE:She's at her boyfriend's house studying.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm so excited you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, are you kidding? You think I'd miss a chance to brag all about my trip? Well, sit down and brag.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, what was London like? Yeah, did you take advantage of the strong dollar? Did you meet the queen? Yeah, I love monarchies.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, come on, give her a chance to answer.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Steven.
SUPMALE:Uh, I brought some pictures and I'm anxious to tell you all about my trip.
LEADMALE:Great, we want to hear all about it.
SUPMALE:Well, a lot of things happened in three years.
SUPMALE:Mm, you're telling us.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know where to start.
LEADMALE:Well, how about the boys? Well, I did meet a couple of cute boys.
LEADFEMALE:And I got their pictures right here.
SUPMALE:I knew it.
OTHERMALE:Did you date any princes or dukes or anything? - No, just commoners.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's funny.
SUPMALE:When I got to England, I wasn't that interested in boys, but, uh, now they're not so bad, you know? Thanks, we try.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess we're all changing.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, here we are and Jennifer's out with a boy.
SUPFEMALE:I guess she's really growing up, huh? Well yes and no.
LEADMALE:Jennifer! Good evening, Scott.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I'd join you.
LEADMALE:Mallory! How nice to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Jen.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, why are you dressed this way? I'm a woman of many moods, Scott young and playful one moment, sophisticated and deadly serious the next.
LEADMALE:Hey! Uh Jennifer, this is a table for two.
SUPMALE:I'm sure you can make room for your sister.
LEADMALE:Well, Scott, what do you recommend? The last time I was here, I found the pizza with bologna very much to my liking.
LEADFEMALE:Shall I go for it again? I don't get it is this a joke or something? I'm deadly serious, Scott, pizza with bologna or not? Jen, we already ordered.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, Scott needs his strength.
SUPFEMALE:He has "mormons" coursing through his veins.
SUPFEMALE:What? They'll be no talking about baseball tonight, Scott.
SUPMALE:Know what I mean? Not really.
LEADMALE:You'll find tonight that I can be as soft as the next girl.
LEADFEMALE:Buy you a drink? Uh All right, Jen, uh, come here for a minute.
SUPMALE:Mallory, you're making a spectacle of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, I think we ought to take you home now.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need you to take me home.
LEADMALE:Jennifer - Stop Are you okay, little girl? I'm fine, and I'm not a little girl.
LEADMALE:Waiter, my bike.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, she was really embarrassed.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, poor kid.
OTHERMALE:I had to convince her that making a fool out of yourself is part of life when you're growing up.
LEADMALE:It's even part of life after you've grown up.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I know I matured a lot over the years.
LEADFEMALE:When I think back Uh, June, why don't you just show us the pictures and tell us about your trip? Let's face it, I mean, maturity and I are no strangers.
LEADMALE:Alex, who are you kidding? I'm the mature one.
SUPMALE:You? You don't even know - Oh, come on, guys.
SUPFEMALE:June's trying to tell us about her trip.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, the more I was on my own, I found that I think Mom and Dad know that they don't have to worry about my being responsible even when they're not home.
LEADFEMALE:That's because I'm in charge when they're not home.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, and he always does a great job.
SUPMALE:So, uh, nobody else is home, then? Nope, just you and me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should leave.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:I made her do it, Alex I'm an animal.
LEADMALE:I don't deserve to live.
LEADMALE:Where's Jennifer? I thought she was with you.
LEADFEMALE:I got caught up in the moment.
SUPMALE:I-I couldn't control myself.
SUPMALE:Jeff.
LEADMALE:I'm not usually like this but when I'm around Mallory, I go crazy.
SUPMALE:Jeff, calm down, we've got other problems here.
SUPFEMALE:I lost Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you took her to the card game with you! I-I did, but-but while I was playing, she just wandered off.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Mom and Dad came to the card game to get her.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:They're right behind me.
LEADFEMALE:I had to drive on the sidewalk to beat them home.
LEADMALE:Maybe Jennifer came home and she's upstairs sleeping.
OTHERMALE:I hope you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll look.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I kind of told my parents that Jennifer was with you, so I'd appreciate it if-if you'd Lie.
SUPFEMALE:That about says it, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, Alex, if you want me to.
SUPFEMALE:Look, if Jennifer's not home, maybe you and I should go look for her.
OTHERMALE:We both got cars.
SUPFEMALE:Good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeff, thank you for your support.
SUPMALE:I'm glad you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Not at all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're certainly not the two I expected to see on the couch.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that was real responsible, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Losing Jennifer in a card game? I had a straight flush I mean, what would you do? All right, okay, I got a little carried away.
OTHERMALE:I believe June was trying to tell us about her trip.
LEADFEMALE:What trip? Oh, right, right, well.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, the second day I was there, I met this terrific guy.
LEADFEMALE:I've got his picture right here, he's so Okay, all right, I admit I should've been thinking a little more about Jennifer, but it was a momentary lapse.
SUPMALE:I mean, I matured a lot since then.
LEADMALE:In fact, in some ways I'm so mature that I've outgrown a lot of people my own age.
OTHERFEMALE:You've been wondering about my age all evening, haven't you, Alex? Oh, no, your age? No, your age never-never entered my mind.
LEADMALE:How old do you think I am? Oh, I don't know, uh I'd say about years old.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be 40 in July.
SUPMALE:I'll be 29 in March.
LEADFEMALE:My, my and still in high school.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm a veteran, you know.
OTHERMALE:Okay, I'm-I'm 17.
LEADMALE:But they've been 17 very full years.
SUPMALE:Alex, chronological age means nothing to me.
LEADMALE:I like that in a woman.
SUPMALE:Hey, you want to dance? I thought you'd never ask.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you're good.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:No, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:No, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mom, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, uh, where's your, um Uh, uh, I-I mean is Is this your Who's this? Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, Dad, this is, uh, Lorraine Ferrar.
LEADMALE:My date.
LEADMALE:She's his date, Steven.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Yes, it-it certainly is nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'll say.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, you kids want to dance? We'll just roll back the rug.
SUPFEMALE:Nope.
LEADMALE:I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Do you think so, Steven? Are you talking to me? Oh, no, uh, no, uh, no, no-no dancing for us.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, um Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's good.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:What ever happened to Lorraine, Alex? Ah, Lorraine and I kind of lost track of each other.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I should give her a call.
LEADMALE:Forget it, Alex.
SUPMALE:Ah, that could be her now.
SUPMALE:Hello? Oh, yes, Jennifer, June's here.
LEADFEMALE:Uh All right, I see.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll tell her.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:That was Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:She sends you her best, June.
LEADMALE:She'll be here just as soon as she can.
LEADMALE:Apparently the female fruit fly is not in the mood.
OTHERMALE:What are they going to do, put on some Johnny Mathis records? Chances are.
OTHERMALE:Look, June, why don't you show us some more pictures? Well, I do have some beautiful shots of Florence.
OTHERFEMALE:Florence who? Mallory, Florence is a city in Italy.
LEADMALE:It's not a person.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, Alex, Florence is a person.
LEADMALE:Florence Weldon.
LEADFEMALE:See, Alex, Florence is not a city in Italy.
OTHERFEMALE:Florence and I went to Paris, and we stayed in this really cute bed-and-breakfast.
SUPMALE:What's a bed-and-breakfast? A bed is something you sleep in.
SUPFEMALE:Breakfast is something you have in the morning.
LEADMALE:It's like a small hotel, Mal.
OTHERMALE:In Europe, a lot of people rent out rooms in their houses.
SUPMALE:Oh, we were there during the tourist season, so, I mean, it got pretty wild.
LEADFEMALE:Some nights, we had 50 people staying in the house.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:I guess that doesn't happen too much here in Ohio.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't know about that.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you don't mind.
SUPFEMALE:I invited a few people.
SUPMALE:Uh, mind? As a matter of fact All right, okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, what are you doing? We did it.
OTHERFEMALE:We captured the other team's mascot.
SUPMALE:We got the Crawford Kangaroo.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Can you believe this? They captured the Crawford Kangaroo.
SUPMALE:This is a day we will never forget.
LEADMALE:I'm home.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:How was your trip? It's so nice to see you.
LEADFEMALE:What is going on here? Now, Dad, uh don't go jumping to any conclusions.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa! Alex, Parents are conditioned to accept a a-a few, uh, minor problems when they leave their children alone at home spilled milk on the rug, a broken dish.
SUPFEMALE:There was a kangaroo in my living room.
LEADMALE:It was just here for the party, Dad.
LEADMALE:Then I guess I'm overreacting.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, if you just give us a chance, we can explain everything.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, can you? Can you explain the valet parking in the driveway? The flashing vacancy sign in front of the house? The billboard on Route 41? Look, Dad, I just, I-I just lost my head, you know? When the when the money started rolling in, I got out of control.
LEADMALE:I-I could smell it.
SUPMALE:I could taste it.
LEADFEMALE:I could hear it, calling me at night, saying, "Alex, at last we'll be together.
OTHERFEMALE:" Dad, I-I guess you could just say that I-I kind of became a a money-holic.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I need help.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, uh, you left me in charge, and I let you down in every possible way.
OTHERFEMALE:I was immature, I was irresponsible, and, uh, and I was greedy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:He's coming around.
SUPFEMALE:For months Steven would wake up in the middle of the night screaming about kangaroos.
OTHERMALE:Well, Pop, I-I bet you look back on that whole incident now and laugh.
LEADMALE:Uh, I think we've all become a lot more responsible since then.
LEADMALE:It's because your father and I have set such a good example.
LEADMALE:Yes, we've taught you to think clearly and rationally before you act.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Ruben Tedesco.
SUPFEMALE:Your children call me Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Tedesco.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should, too.
SUPFEMALE:I teach European literature.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't belong in this classroom, don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:Neither do most of your children.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to make this an open forum.
LEADMALE:I'll answer any intelligent questions you may have.
SUPMALE:Well, I was wondering - Hands please.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, the lady in the front row.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Tedesco - Not you.
LEADFEMALE:The one next to you, the old bag.
LEADMALE:Why do you give out so much homework? I said intelligent questions.
OTHERFEMALE:Next.
SUPMALE:Yes, you.
LEADFEMALE:My son, he says you pick on him.
OTHERFEMALE:You call him names.
OTHERMALE:Who's your son? Larry Morgan.
SUPFEMALE:Larry the Loser? Madame, your son is an insipid pimple-faced liar.
OTHERMALE:Anyone else? Please identify yourself.
OTHERMALE:I'm Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Binney.
SUPFEMALE:My daughter, Mindy, so enjoyed reading The Little Prince.
OTHERMALE:Is there anything else you'd recommend for her? Yes, I'd recommend she lose 40 pounds.
LEADFEMALE:You could lose 30 yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Next? My, my, such an inquisitive bunch.
LEADFEMALE:I have something to say.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Tedesco, I think you owe Mrs.
LEADMALE:Binney and everyone else in here an apology.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:You-you've been terribly rude and insulting to us all.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, it's clear that your son does not get his intelligence from you.
LEADMALE:If you feel I'm being insulting, fine.
LEADFEMALE:I won't insult anyone anymore.
LEADMALE:This little get-together is over.
LEADFEMALE:I'm leaving.
LEADMALE:Sorry, the game is over.
SUPFEMALE:Let me through.
LEADFEMALE:Don't push me.
LEADMALE:Move it, Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:You can't do that.
SUPFEMALE:Who's gonna stop me? I came to apologize for my wife's behavior.
LEADMALE:She feels terrible about the whole thing.
OTHERMALE:She's really sorry.
LEADMALE:We both are.
LEADFEMALE:I could sue, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Look, uh, look, let-let-let-let's try to gain some perspective on the situation here.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, haven't you ever done something without thinking, something you regretted later? Yes, I showed up for parents' night.
LEADFEMALE:Look, look, I know you're upset and you have every right to be.
SUPFEMALE:But you're obviously a very intelligent, civilized person who can recognize this incident for what it is.
SUPMALE:An aberration.
LEADMALE:And I hope you'll forgive and forget.
LEADMALE:Fortunately, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Keaton, your son inherited your rational temperament.
LEADMALE:For his sake, I will allow myself to be appeased by your words.
LEADMALE:I am nothing if not civilized.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I can see that.
LEADFEMALE:Your wife, however, is an Amazon.
SUPMALE:Part Irish, part French, no Amazon.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean, Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:She's primal.
LEADMALE:Not fully evolved.
OTHERMALE:You must have a tough time keeping her in line.
LEADMALE:Tell me, do whips ever enter the picture? I think I'll be going now.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm curious, what's it like to live with that kind of unbridled she-devil? Good-bye, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Tedesco.
SUPFEMALE:No wait, just one more question.
SUPFEMALE:Does she ever, uh Why, you Now, now, June, I don't want you to get the idea that-that we condone violence.
OTHERMALE:No, no, not at all.
LEADMALE:Yeah, just don't make any sudden moves.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be all right.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Andy.
SUPMALE:What's wrong, honey? We've been doing all the talking.
OTHERMALE:I guess he feels left out.
LEADFEMALE:I know how he feels.
SUPMALE:You know, if Andrew could talk, I bet he'd have a story or two to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, your wife's on television.
LEADFEMALE:She sure does.
SUPMALE:This is my favorite part.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait till you hear the way she hits this one note.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Oh! Wow, she really nailed it that time.
SUPFEMALE:Don't stop, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Why did she stop? I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I think I'm going into labor.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, that-that explains it.
SUPMALE:Labor? Steven, are you watching? Of course I am.
LEADMALE:This is it.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Steven, if you're watching, meet me at the hospital.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'll be there in 15 minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Be there in ten minutes.
SUPMALE:Ten minutes, and I'll get your suitcase.
LEADMALE:And don't forget my suitcase.
LEADMALE:Stop nagging.
LEADMALE:I'm coming.
SUPFEMALE:Steven! - Come on, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Go! - Hurry.
OTHERMALE:Steven! Okay, now, let's give June a chance.
SUPMALE:We've been doing all the talking ourselves.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I really do want to see what London looks like.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, it's pretty much what you would expect, except that people drive on the wrong side of the street.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mal, you'd fit right in.
LEADFEMALE:June, we're all going to be quiet now, so you can tell us about your trip.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay, when I first got to London, - it was really foggy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, June.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, hi.
LEADMALE:It's nice to see you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, it's good to see you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you look great.
OTHERMALE:Oh, so do you.
LEADFEMALE:Did I miss much about your trip? Oh, no, not a word.
LEADMALE:Well, I want to hear everything.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay, now, no more interruptions.
LEADFEMALE:Well, anyway, as I was saying, when I first got there, I met this really terrific guy.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, you should meet this guy Adam.
LEADMALE:He's really smart and cute and funny.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, Jennifer, we don't want to hear about it, okay? I want to hear about Margaret Thatcher.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, how did how did Adam do with the
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Okay, Andy, here's your pop sticks and here's your glue.
SUPMALE:What are you going to make? A mess.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Andy.
SUPMALE:What did Nick teach you in art class? He taught me to let your artistic ideas spill out all over the place.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:That's because he doesn't have to clean it up.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to make a present for Nick.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to miss my art class.
SUPFEMALE:I know you are, Andy.
LEADMALE:Why does it have to end? Well, 'cause the community center needs the space and the class was only for six weeks anyway, so it has to end.
SUPMALE:I can't work under these conditions.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:Well, this was a successful trip to the supermarket! And good news.
OTHERMALE:There was a special on turkey franks.
LEADFEMALE:It was not a special.
SUPMALE:Sure there was.
LEADFEMALE:Buy 300, get one free.
SUPFEMALE:What's all this stuff? Oh, Andy's making a farewell gift for Nick.
SUPMALE:A farewell gift for Nick? Let me help.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, relax.
OTHERMALE:Nick's not going anywhere.
OTHERMALE:It's just that his art class is ending.
LEADFEMALE:That's such a shame.
SUPMALE:You know, I picked up Andy there last week, and-and I saw Nick teaching.
LEADMALE:He's wonderful with those kids.
SUPFEMALE:And he's not taking this sitting down.
SUPMALE:He wants to start his own art school.
LEADFEMALE:He went to the bank today to get a loan.
SUPMALE:A loan? They won't even give him a calendar.
SUPFEMALE:Don't laugh.
OTHERMALE:Alex went with him.
LEADMALE:I think he really has a chance.
LEADMALE: Just explain to me, Nick, explain to me how you could do that, okay? You completely blew it.
OTHERFEMALE:What happened? What happened, we go down to the bank, my favorite bank; they love me there.
OTHERMALE:I mean, the bank manager's got a picture of me on his desk.
OTHERFEMALE:So what went wrong? Hey-hey, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I-I walk into the bank, I go up to the guy behind the counter, and I say, "I need $5,000 and quick.
LEADFEMALE:" So? So he rang the alarm.
SUPFEMALE:I had to identify him to the police.
LEADFEMALE:I hope the bank invites me to the annual money fondling picnic again.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess that's the end of the art school.
SUPMALE:This seems so wrong.
SUPMALE:I mean, all you need is $5,000.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I don't think you have any other choice.
LEADFEMALE:There's only one place to go to get this money, and you know it.
LEADFEMALE:Where's that? To your father.
SUPFEMALE: Yes.
LEADFEMALE: Thank God.
OTHERMALE:Uh, no way.
LEADMALE:I told you, he and I are not on speaking terms.
LEADMALE:There is no way that I am asking him.
SUPMALE:Okay, everybody, paint brushes down! All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's check it out, see what we got here, huh? Whoa.
LEADMALE:Hey, you know something? We're good.
SUPMALE:You know something? You're right, we are good.
LEADMALE:This is great, huh? Anyway, next week, we are going to do collages.
LEADFEMALE:What about the week after that? There isn't going to be any week after that, honey.
LEADMALE:Class is over then.
OTHERFEMALE: Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey.
LEADFEMALE:But that does not mean you guys got to stop doing your work, right? Okay, now come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get your coats and everything.
OTHERMALE:Everybody find your moms.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:We'll see you next week.
LEADFEMALE: Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, I already did my work.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:This is very creative.
LEADMALE:You got, let me see, a house with a tree, and a, uh, birdie mowing the lawn.
LEADMALE:That's not a bird.
LEADFEMALE:That's Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I thought that was your mother.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no, that's definitely you, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Uh, check out the spindly legs.
SUPFEMALE:Always a pleasure, Nick.
SUPMALE:Hey, bye-bye, Andy.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
OTHERMALE:Bye-bye, art class.
OTHERFEMALE:Nick, you can't let this happen.
LEADMALE:You've got to keep teaching.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mal, what am I going to do? How about your father? Oh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:He is not going to help me.
LEADMALE:He has to, Nick; that's the rule.
LEADFEMALE:Fathers have to help their children.
SUPFEMALE:Mal, he walked out on us when I was 11 years old.
LEADMALE:Well, do you know where he is now? Yeah, sure.
LEADMALE:He's got a, uh, used car lot downtown.
LEADMALE:Joe Moore's Motors.
SUPFEMALE:Joe Moore?! The one on TV?! I love his commercials! Especially the one where he walks on top of the cars wearing stilts.
LEADFEMALE:How does he do that? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:He used to do that at home, too.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, a lot of time has passed.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, maybe he's changed.
OTHERFEMALE:Nick, give him a call.
LEADFEMALE:If-if he doesn't want to see you, fine, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:But if he does, then maybe you can work something out.
LEADMALE:Hey, my old man here yet? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:Look, uh, Alex, I hope you don't mind me having this little family reunion here.
SUPMALE:You know, Mal thought it would be a good idea for me and my father to meet on neutral territory.
LEADMALE:Nick, let me tell you something, okay? This is our living room.
LEADFEMALE:Switzerland is neutral territory.
LEADMALE:But, uh, listen, seeing as your father's coming over, and-and he has that-that lot full of used cars, wonder if you could mention to him that I just, I happen to be in the market for, uh, for a very reliable, I mean, I mean, bargain-priced, rock bottom, almost free Jaguar.
OTHERMALE:Look, Alex, Alex, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:Me and my old man, we don't get along.
LEADMALE:You know, I ain't got nothing to talk to him about.
LEADMALE:You don't know how lucky you are to have a dad who loves you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, a dad with class.
LEADMALE:A dad you can be proud of.
LEADMALE:Turkey franks, anyone? I got turkey frank pÃ¢tÃ©.
SUPFEMALE:I got turkey frank meatballs.
LEADFEMALE:And my personal favorite, turkey Frank Sinatra.
OTHERFEMALE:You were saying, Nick?  That's him! That's him! Now wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't get Oh, my God, Dad! Now, just 'cause this man is on television is no reason to get crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Dad! Just act natural, all right? Everybody, you hear me? Just act natural.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Okay, hey.
LEADMALE:Okay, okay, okay, okay.
SUPMALE:Stand back.
LEADMALE:I'm going to open the door now.
SUPFEMALE:Are we greeting your father or molten lava? Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:My God, Elyse, they're speaking Nick-anese.
LEADFEMALE:Look at you.
SUPFEMALE:You look great! Yeah, you look great, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see what the problem is.
LEADMALE:They seem to agree on everything.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey-ey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:I think they're summing up now.
OTHERMALE:Joe, I'd like you to meet Mrs.
LEADMALE:And Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Alex and Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:And my lovely girlfriend, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:I love your work.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Uh, now you met me, I want you to meet my better half, uh, my car.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Ain't she a beauty? -  I call her Marie.
LEADFEMALE:You got yourself a good woman there, Joe.
LEADMALE:Uh, you know, if you like her so much, she just happens to have a twin down at the lot, name of Joann.
LEADMALE:Joann recently passed her emissions test.
OTHERMALE:Joe, Joe, Joe, these people do not want to buy a car.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't go nuts, okay? It's a reflex.
SUPFEMALE:I sell, I sell.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, excuse me, uh, Joe.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah? Uh, listen, I was just wondering.
SUPMALE:How much would a couple of classy girls like Marie and, uh, and Joann set a guy like me back? Emotionally, I don't think I can bear to part with either one of them.
OTHERFEMALE:But $7,000 might help me compensate for any severe separation anxieties.
LEADMALE:Well, well, why don't we all sit down and, uh, get to know each other, huh? That's a good idea, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:You always were the one with the brains in the family.
LEADMALE:How-how about an hors d'oeuvre, Joe? Oh, I don't mind if I do.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, look at that, turkey franks.
LEADFEMALE:They're gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, if I have one, I got to have a million.
LEADMALE: Well, you came to the right house.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Joe, about this business proposition.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what I want to do is start a Business later.
SUPMALE:The night is young.
SUPMALE:Look, look, look, Joe, this is very simple, and I would really like to get it out of the way, okay? Nicky you miss your old man, huh? Come over here.
SUPMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a hug.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a hug.
LEADFEMALE:I don't feel like it.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, come on.
LEADMALE:Give me a hug.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What's this? It's a bread box for Nick.
LEADMALE:A bread box? Wait a minute, I thought I thought we decided what we were going to make for Nick's farewell present.
LEADMALE:Huh? What did we say we were going to make? The Reagan Ranch.
LEADMALE:That's right, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:I got the plans right here.
LEADFEMALE:I even now this is great even have plans for a little, uh, a little pop stick Ron and a little pop stick Nancy.
LEADMALE:How about a pop stick jail for his cabinet? Yeah, okay.
LEADFEMALE:I get it, I get it.
OTHERMALE:The minute I leave, you guys, you guys turn on me, you change your mind.
LEADFEMALE:All right, that's fine.
LEADMALE:I don't need you guys.
LEADFEMALE:I will build my own Reagan Ranch.
LEADFEMALE:I will build my own pop stick empire.
LEADMALE: Oh, no, you don't.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't.
SUPFEMALE:I stayed up all night eating ice cream pops for those sticks! Nick, I'm so excited.
LEADMALE:We're going to see 101 Dalmatians for the 101st time! Quick-quick-quick, turn on the TV.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to miss any of the barking.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE: JOE 
SUPMALE:This is Joe "I've got a cherry of a deal for you" Moore.
SUPFEMALE: At Joe Moore Motors, you get more.
LEADFEMALE:More value, more quality, more car for your car-buying buck.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, this is embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:I got to turn it down.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Nick, you have to be a little bit more understanding.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Joe does things the best way he knows how.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, granted, he's not the classiest guy in the world.
LEADMALE:I mean, he's not you.
SUPFEMALE:You see, that's just it.
OTHERMALE:You know, you caught all the breaks.
LEADMALE:Your dad's smart, your dad's intellectual, your dad's distinguished.
LEADMALE:Oh, boy! 101 Dalmatians.
OTHERMALE: Did I miss any barking? You see, Mal? You see? My father never did anything like this with me.
LEADMALE:You know, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton, in a way, my father's not my father.
LEADMALE:You're my father.
LEADMALE:Oh, Nick.
LEADMALE:Don't say that.
LEADMALE: - I'll get it.
SUPMALE: - 
LEADFEMALE:Hey, sir or madam! Guess who.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you a hint.
OTHERMALE:It's me!  Joe, you're so funny! I brought presents.
LEADMALE:Uh, personalized mud flaps for everybody.
LEADMALE:Oh! - Hey! Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Joe.
LEADMALE:I'm-I'm going to run these mud flaps up to Elyse.
OTHERMALE:Uh, our anniversary's coming up.
LEADMALE:Congratulations.
LEADMALE:Joe, tell me, what kind of transportation could a fellow get for $500? You can get on a bus to Haiti.
LEADFEMALE: Okay, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'll come back when you, when you stop kidding around, huh? - Okay.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:And for you, Nick, I got something special.
LEADMALE:Me.
SUPMALE:Huh? Oh, hey, thanks, Joe.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't got nothing like this.
LEADMALE:How about I take you two out to dinner at the Fish Shanty? You remember the Fish Shanty, huh? - No.
LEADFEMALE:Come on! It was your favorite restaurant.
LEADMALE:I took you there once.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yeah, right, I remember.
OTHERMALE:Beautiful time.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No, I didn't have such a beautiful time at the Fish Shanty.
LEADMALE:As I remember, you met up with a couple of your buddies, uh, started drinking, and you had to have the waiter drive me home.
SUPFEMALE:It's funny.
LEADFEMALE:I don't remember it that way.
LEADMALE:Well, that's the way it happened.
LEADFEMALE:Look, why don't we forget talking about the good old days and, uh, talk about my art school, okay? Well, you could talk about it over dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Somehow, I lost my appetite.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Uh, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? I'll tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:Tomorrow afternoon, come down to the lot.
OTHERMALE:You tell me what your needs are, I'll make out a check for you.
LEADMALE: Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! Very clever indeed.
LEADMALE:You really pinned me to the wall on this one.
LEADMALE:Uh, let's see what we have here.
LEADFEMALE:With the rebate, the dealer warranty, and No! Oh, you get one cherry of a deal, my good friend, at 1,995.
LEADFEMALE:I beg to differ, my good friend.
SUPFEMALE:But the automobile in question, if squeezed into a glass of water, would produce a tangy and refreshing glass of lemonade.
LEADMALE:You insult me, my dear friend.
SUPFEMALE:And yet, I take no personal offense.
SUPMALE:The car does have a certain citrus quality which may be easier to swallow at the paltry price of 1,775.
LEADFEMALE:A good price and a wonderful year.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Alex, what are you doing here? I'm trying to buy an automobile, but, uh, Joe and I aren't seeing eye-to-eye.
LEADMALE:Careful, he's a snake.
SUPMALE:Hey, don't worry, Mal, I can take care of this guy.
SUPFEMALE:I was talking to Joe.
LEADMALE:Alex, I'll tell you what I want you to do.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you to take her out for a test drive.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're going to love the way she handles.
SUPMALE:Just don't turn right.
SUPFEMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:Okay, Nicky, what do you need? It's really great what you're doing for Nick, Joe.
LEADMALE:It really means a lot to him.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go, son.
LEADFEMALE:$5,000.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, thanks, Joe.
SUPMALE:I really appreciate this.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, I'll make sure I get it back to you.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:I would like to have a private moment with my son.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'll just go join Alex.
LEADMALE:Yes, I see him out there going around in circles.
LEADMALE:So, uh, what do you want, Joe? I just gave you 5,000 smackers.
LEADFEMALE:Don't call me "Joe," call me "Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:" I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:It's not easy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm your father, right? - Yeah, you're my father.
OTHERFEMALE:I brought you into this world, right? Yeah, and I've been meaning to thank you for that.
OTHERFEMALE:You can thank me.
LEADFEMALE:You can thank me by calling me "Dad.
SUPMALE:" Hey, hey, let's not start this, all right? What's the point? We both know what's gone down between us.
SUPFEMALE:In other words, you're going to take the money and you're going to be off on your sweet way? Is that what it is? Well, what else is there here for me, huh? There's me, Nicky.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Joe.
OTHERMALE:Who are you kidding, huh? I was there.
LEADMALE:I was there the day you walked out.
SUPFEMALE:What is with you, huh? Are you determined not to forgive me, no matter what I do, no matter what I say, no matter nothing?! Huh?! You don't understand me! You don't know my side of the story! Oh, yeah? What is your side of the story? Okay, you want to know my side of the story? I'm going to tell you! Your mother and I never loved each other, okay? We got married because she was pregnant with you.
LEADFEMALE:We tried to make it work, Nicky.
LEADMALE:Believe me, we tried.
LEADMALE:We did everything we could do, but there was no way.
OTHERMALE:But that's all in the past now.
LEADMALE:Can't we get beyond this point? Maybe you can, but I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I was 11 years old the day you walked out that door.
OTHERMALE:And that was my childhood, the only one I'll ever have, and there was no father there! Hey! You called, I came.
SUPFEMALE:You said you needed money, I gave you a check.
LEADFEMALE:What else do you want from me? Not this.
LEADMALE:Well, this happens to be a particularly interesting collage.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, we got a man's head on a kangaroo's body.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody know what we call that? 
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:A mangaroo.
SUPMALE: All right, all right, everybody, it's time to call it quits.
SUPMALE: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, okay, okay, okay.
SUPFEMALE:I am not that happy about it, either.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm going to miss each and every one of you.
LEADMALE:But I got a very special present for all of you over here on the table.
LEADMALE:So make sure you pick one up before you go, all right? Hey-ey! I'll see you later, all right? - You take care.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye, Nick.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Nick, I have a present for you.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:It's a breadbox.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great, Andy.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Take care, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:Nick this is for you.
LEADFEMALE:It's the Reagan Ranch.
LEADMALE:Buddy, thanks.
SUPFEMALE: No, forget it, Nick! Forget it, Nick! I worked all night on this! This is mine, okay?! This is my ranch, all right? This is mine.
LEADMALE:I'm taking this, too.
LEADFEMALE:I want this, too.
SUPMALE:How are you, Joe? - Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, Joe.
LEADMALE:Uh, what is this, some kind of kids' coloring center? Well, uh, in a manner of speaking.
LEADMALE:So, uh, Nick is the chief colorer? He's very talented and he's wonderful with children.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? A chip off the old block, huh? I got a way with kids.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, kid, you got a smoke? - Nick.
SUPFEMALE:Nick.
SUPMALE:Huh? Look who's here.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm really glad you could come, Joe.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Have a seat.
SUPMALE:Huh.
LEADFEMALE: So, you're a teacher, huh? Who would have ever thought a son of mine would be a teacher? You know, Nick, when you were born, I just had one dream for 
LEADFEMALE:That you'd turn out to be better than me.
LEADFEMALE:No, I never wanted to be better than you.
SUPMALE:You're my dad.
LEADFEMALE:I looked up to you.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted you to be around.
OTHERMALE:I just wanted you to be there to teach me things, like how to throw a ball or how to ask a girl out or how to dance.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's not too late.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you want to learn, the mambo, the cha-cha, the hunky-dory chicky-dory? Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Huh? Hey-hey, I am serious here, you know? This may be a big joke to you, but this is my life we're talking about.
LEADMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:So I was a lousy father, all right? So I fooled around, I went to the track, I went to the pool hall.
SUPFEMALE:You know what hurt me? Is that you just forgot about me.
LEADMALE:I never forgot you, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:I followed everything you ever did.
OTHERMALE:I went to every one of your art shows when you weren't there, because I didn't think you wanted to see me.
SUPMALE:You did that? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You remember the first painting you ever sold? Yeah, sure.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Woman With Half- Eaten Burger.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it's hanging in my living room.
OTHERFEMALE:You bought it? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I went home last night after you came to the lot, and I'm looking at it.
LEADFEMALE:And I realized, unless I work things out, that would be the only thing I ever have of you.
SUPFEMALE:Nicky, I want to start again.
SUPFEMALE:But I want to start right this time.
LEADMALE:I want that, too.
LEADMALE:How about we go out for some fish and talk? I mean, really talk.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I'd like that.
LEADMALE:By the way, I still got that check for your school.
LEADFEMALE:And this time, you're going to take it.
SUPMALE:How can I say no Dad? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:All right, who did this? This is the most regressive, childish, immature thing I have ever seen in my life.
SUPMALE:I did the teeth.
LEADFEMALE:I did the mustache.
SUPMALE:I did the beard.
SUPMALE:Who did the antennas? I think he always had those, honey.
LEADFEMALE:-The man was crying out for antennas! I had a Magic Marker.
LEADMALE:Who could resist? Hey, what's going on? I mean, I could barely hear myself blow-dry my hair.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you wouldn't be interested, Mal; we're talking about the election.
LEADMALE:Oh, really, Alex? Are you forgetting something? I'm voting this year.
LEADMALE:Nick and I went down and registered.
SUPMALE:I guess this means they've abolished that literacy requirement.
LEADMALE:Have you decided who you're voting for, Mallory? - No, not yet.
SUPMALE:Well, honey, we've got some Dukakis literature upstairs, if you're interested.
LEADMALE:I have some Bush literature that I think is very helpful in defining the differences between the two candidates.
LEADFEMALE:Dentists also use it when they run out of Novocain.
LEADMALE:Can you vote? Can you vote? Alex, Alex, listen! What are you Sorry to interrupt your quiet morning at home.
OTHERMALE:Uh, sorry, we, uh, we get a little passionate around here - come election time.
SUPFEMALE:Well, have you decided who you're gonna vote for, Lauren? - Because we have some literature upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mom, Mom, Mom.
SUPMALE:Just give me a little bit of credit here, okay? Lauren and I have discussed the issue, and I think she feels the same way as I do about this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you've really got her under your thumb, son.
SUPMALE:Andy, you you want to get Lauren another one of those Bush T-shirts? Okay, but I think we're out of mediums.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not gonna vote for Bush.
LEADFEMALE:For one, I've never fully accepted his explanation of his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
SUPMALE:Bush had an affair? Well, not-not really, Mal.
OTHERMALE:The Iran-Contra scandal.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, Dad "scandal" is a loaded word.
LEADFEMALE:Y-You're right, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:The Iran-Contra prank.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, he had an affair in Iran? - This is the kind of political back-and-forth we have here.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, listen Hold it, hold it, hold it! Wait a minute! That is enough election talk.
LEADFEMALE:For the past month, it's been nothing but Dukakis-Bush around here.
SUPMALE:And, you know, I think we care more about the election than they do.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we ought to get away from this media hype for a while, huh? Go somewhere where there's no television, no radio, no telephone Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Breathe, breathe.
LEADFEMALE:Um, look, um Do you guys remember those weekend camping trips we used to take up to the Sandusky campgrounds? Oh, oh, I loved those weekends.
LEADFEMALE:Friday, we'd leave after dinner, and we'd drive all through the night.
SUPMALE:And my favorite part was in the car.
SUPMALE:We'd play word games and we'd sing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERMALE:Guys.
OTHERMALE:I think we know where you're going with this.
LEADMALE:Well, what do you say? Let's do it again, this weekend.
SUPFEMALE:Um, I can't make it this weekend, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, camping was fun when we were younger, but that's when I was wearing Earth shoes.
LEADFEMALE:And I have a history report on Ancient Greece I want to get started on.
SUPMALE:Well, okay.
LEADMALE:It was just a thought.
LEADMALE:Well, hey, just the two of us can go.
LEADMALE:We can still have fun, despite these spoilsports.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Elyse.
LEADMALE:It won't be any fun with just the two of us.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it'll be too much fun with just the two of us.
LEADMALE:Coming.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what are you guys up to, huh? Well, I'm trying to get Lauren to wear this T-shirt.
LEADMALE:Oh, I know that guy.
LEADMALE:I know who that is.
LEADFEMALE:I I seen him on TV.
OTHERMALE:That's, uh Orville Redenbacher.
LEADFEMALE:This is George Bush.
SUPFEMALE:You're voting this year, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:You're supposed to know this stuff.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, how how are you gonna decide who you're gonna vote for this year? Uh, you know, I'm not too sure.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna have to leave it up to Mel; she's the brains behind this couple.
SUPMALE:I weep for this nation.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Well, hey, what's going on here, huh? Oh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton and Andy and I are going camping this weekend.
OTHERFEMALE:Just the three of you? Everybody else is busy.
SUPMALE:It's no big deal.
OTHERMALE:So, uh, you guys all ready to go? Yeah, I think so.
SUPMALE:Let me just check this list again, see if we've got everything.
LEADMALE:Uh, tent? - Oh, check.
LEADMALE:Flashlight? - Check.
LEADFEMALE:Family? - Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
OTHERMALE:Never mind.
LEADMALE:Dad, are you really upset about us not going? Oh, no! Don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:I was just kidding.
OTHERMALE:No big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, you guys are all busy.
SUPMALE:You have your own lives to lead.
LEADMALE:What about me? Do I have my own life? You're too young to have your own life.
SUPFEMALE:The last thing we want to do is make you guys feel guilty.
OTHERMALE:Absolutely.
OTHERMALE:Let your conscience be your guide.
LEADMALE:Not you, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, could you give me a ride to my apartment? Oh, sure thing, Lauren.
OTHERFEMALE:God knows we've got enough room in the car.
LEADFEMALE:Just kidding! Kidding! All right, on we go, campers.
LEADFEMALE:On, you huskies! - You watch the house.
SUPFEMALE:Just take it with you, okay? Just take it.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:Drive safely.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:See you later, guys.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:See you.
SUPMALE:I don't feel guilty.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, me neither.
LEADFEMALE:They need some bonding time with Andy anyway.
SUPFEMALE:And camping trips are always such a mess.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Alex, remember that time you got poison ivy and nobody wanted to sit next to you on the way home? How could I not remember that? You don't forget driving 200 miles strapped to a ski rack.
LEADFEMALE:It's always cold at night, and the tent's always collapsing.
LEADMALE:Yeah, or it rains.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you get sick.
SUPMALE:That's funny.
SUPMALE:You know, when I was a kid, I always wanted my parents to take me camping.
LEADMALE:I mean, they took me to the woods once, but they just left me there and went home.
OTHERFEMALE:I Anyway, I always imagined sitting out there at night around the campfire.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody being together, cuddling up to stay warm.
LEADMALE:Roasting marshmallows.
LEADMALE:Well, it seemed like it could be fun.
LEADMALE:Sometimes it was nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, like when Mom would play her guitar.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, or we'd just sit and look at the stars.
SUPMALE:I I found ten dollars in the woods once.
SUPFEMALE:We should've gone.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it's true.
SUPFEMALE:And, you know, Mom and Dad they're getting old.
SUPMALE:They're deteriorating rapidly.
LEADMALE:All they've got left are their memories.
LEADMALE:Memories.
LEADFEMALE:Like the corners of their minds.
LEADMALE:I think we should go out there and surprise them.
SUPMALE:Misty water-colored memories.
LEADFEMALE:That is a great idea, Jen.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna go get the sleeping bags.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll get the road maps.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Alex, do you think we could speed it up a little bit? I have to be back for my graduation in two years.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, I am not about to go hot-rodding around for your amusement.
SUPFEMALE:We're only going 35.
SUPFEMALE:An old woman just passed us.
OTHERFEMALE:That's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Let that old woman drive as fast as she wants.
SUPFEMALE:She was on foot.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, come on, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I can't wait to get up there and see Mom and Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, they're gonna be surprised to see us.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially me.
OTHERMALE:I hope they don't scream or anything.
SUPMALE:Look, why don't you all just relax, okay? Enjoy the drive.
OTHERFEMALE:The freedom and exhilaration of the open road, the wind flowing through your hair.
SUPMALE:There's no wind at this speed.
LEADFEMALE:It's really deserted out here.
SUPFEMALE:Where are we? Um I don't know, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, let me see that map.
LEADFEMALE:All righty.
LEADMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:This is a map of Ancient Greece, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
OTHERMALE:Uh-oh? Uh-oh, what uh-oh? I had the maps right next to my history homework.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I must have taken the wrong one.
OTHERMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:How are we supposed to know where we are? I'd say we're about 50 miles from downtown Sparta.
SUPMALE:Well, let's do something.
SUPFEMALE:Like what? Anything.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, remember what we used to do during those long rides down to the campgrounds? Hold Jennifer out the window? No, no, not that.
LEADFEMALE:No, we used to play the word games and stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Oh-oh, hey, hey, I got one.
LEADFEMALE:How about 20 Questions? You know, where somebody thinks of a person, and everybody else has Okay, okay, okay, I'll start.
LEADMALE:Okay, I've got someone! Okay, ask away.
OTHERMALE:Okay, is this person living or dead? Neither.
LEADMALE:I see hours of fun-filled entertainment ahead.
SUPFEMALE:It's not really a person, it's more of a thing.
OTHERMALE:Like a fictional character or something? Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:Is it Mickey Mouse? Yes! Oh, are we perfect for each other, or what? It's like we're sending telepathic messages to each other that nobody else can hear.
LEADMALE:I'm sure no one's trying to listen in.
OTHERMALE:What was that? - I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'll check it out.
LEADMALE:You got a flashlight? Yeah, we have one in here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good, it doesn't work.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I've got something that lights up.
OTHERFEMALE:My compact! - All right, Mel, give him the compact.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, we got big trouble.
LEADMALE:What-what is it? - It's the generator.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:For crying not the generator.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
OTHERMALE:What does the generator do? Well, without the generator, the battery's dead.
LEADMALE:You know, we're not moving.
LEADMALE:Well, let's look at the bright 
LEADMALE:We have plenty of time for 20 Questions.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, okay, I've got one.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, all right.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's really cold.
LEADFEMALE:How long have we been out here? About 45 minutes.
SUPMALE:I can't believe we haven't seen a car.
SUPFEMALE:We're not going to.
SUPMALE:This road only goes up to Sandusky, and if you were going camping, you'd be there already.
OTHERFEMALE:No, our only hope is to be rescued by some other guilty children.
LEADMALE:It's so dark out here.
OTHERMALE:I've never seen it this dark.
SUPFEMALE:It's kind of scary.
SUPMALE:I miss the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we can't just stand out here all night, and it's too cold to sit in the car without the heater working.
OTHERMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:What else can we do? I think we should go for help.
LEADMALE:Out here at night? I know it's dangerous, but I think we've got to try.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I agree.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck, Jenny.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, I'll go with you, Jenny, all right? All right, that's all right, that's all right, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:That's all right, I'll go, I'll go.
SUPFEMALE:After all, she is my sister; I got to protect her.
SUPMALE:Oh, here, take my compact case.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, this will come in handy in case we have to do any emergency eye-lining.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, and, uh, stay in sight of the road, huh? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, they always say that in those teenage horror movies just before somebody gets hacked up.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, you got the map? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Okay, we'll just head this way, towards the Parthenon.
SUPMALE:I hope they'll be all right.
LEADMALE:You really care about him, don't you? Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I just want my compact back.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, hey, come on.
LEADMALE:I know how you guys are.
LEADFEMALE:You make fun of each other and everything, but deep down you guys really care about each other.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that's what makes you Keatons such a tight family.
SUPMALE:Hope I'm in a family like that someday.
LEADMALE:Well, you will be, Nick.
SUPMALE:Someday we'll get married.
OTHERMALE:That is if we're not eaten by a coyote - or bear first.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:No coyote or bear's gonna keep me from marrying you.
SUPMALE:It's your father I'm worried about.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, listen, Nick.
LEADMALE:As long as we're out here, I want to tell you something my father told me.
SUPMALE:But he made me promise never to tell you, so you can't let him know I told you.
LEADMALE:Shoot.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:One day, completely out of the blue, he says to me, "Mallory, "I guess it's not totally inconceivable that you could've done worse than Nick.
LEADFEMALE:" You think he really meant it? I do, Nick, I really do.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, God.
LEADFEMALE:And all this time, I thought he didn't like me.
SUPFEMALE:It's beautiful, isn't it? Yeah, I'll say.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you look up, up at them stars, and you just can't help thinking.
LEADMALE:Thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, sometimes you are so deep.
LEADMALE:Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:Mating season has already begun.
SUPMALE:What happened? How come you guys are back? Well, we got a little ways up the road and we saw this sign, Great.
LEADFEMALE:Now what? Well, I guess we could set up camp here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, let's set up camp here.
LEADMALE:What are we, the Swiss Family Robinson? This is all right.
LEADFEMALE:Clean air, smell of pine, the moon high above, the thrill of being at one with nature.
OTHERMALE:God, what I wouldn't give for a Holiday Inn.
OTHERMALE:Oh, stop whining, Gumby.
LEADFEMALE:We should've gone with Mom and Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, what would've been the big deal? I know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was kind of selfish, I mean, when you think of all that they've done for us.
SUPFEMALE:It's all gonna come back to us, Jen.
LEADMALE:One day, we'll be asking our kids to go places with us, and they'll tell us they're too busy.
SUPMALE:It's not gonna happen with mine, Mal.
SUPMALE:Oh, it happens to every kid and their parents, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Nope, nope, not mine.
LEADFEMALE:No, my kids are gonna be on a straight commission basis.
LEADFEMALE:Two dollars for a hug.
OTHERFEMALE:Five dollars for a kiss.
SUPMALE:And for an "I don't want to go to Aunt Mallory's house," of American Tourister luggage.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we're not gonna be like that with our kids.
LEADMALE:Are we, Nick? - Mm-mm, no way.
OTHERFEMALE:Our kids are gonna love us whether we give them luggage or not.
OTHERMALE:We're gonna be very close to Nick Jr.
OTHERMALE:And Nicolette Jr.
SUPFEMALE:Or little Mallory and little Mallomar.
LEADFEMALE:Mallomar? Make that a hundred bucks for not wanting to go to Aunt Mallory's house.
SUPMALE:I bet Mom and Dad and Andy are having a great time right now.
LEADFEMALE:They're probably roasting marshmallows.
LEADMALE:Uh, Dad's probably doing that, uh, Indian moon dance he's so fond of.
LEADFEMALE:The one where he's kind of a cross between Geronimo and Ginger Rogers.
SUPFEMALE:They're probably starting in on "A Hundred Bottles of Beer on the Wall" right now.
LEADMALE:By now, we'd probably be on to your version.
SUPFEMALE:What's your version, Mal? Oh, it's silly, Nick.
OTHERFEMALE:That never stopped you before.
SUPMALE:Do it, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Well Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Shh! Car, car.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, don't interrupt the song.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey, hey! - The car! Hey, hey, hey! It's Mom and Dad! It's Mom and Dad! - It's Mom and Dad! - I know who it is, hey! What are you doing here? - What's happening? Why are you here? - Wait, wait.
LEADMALE:All right, hey, hold it.
LEADFEMALE:One at a time.
SUPMALE:What are you guys doing here? We were on our way up to Sandusky.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we were gonna surprise you, but the car broke down.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's so sweet.
LEADMALE:You guys are great.
SUPMALE:Well, what are you guys doing here? Well oh, I don't know, I guess it just didn't feel right up there without you.
SUPMALE:It didn't have that good old-time family feeling.
OTHERMALE:There was no one to heckle my Indian moon dance.
LEADMALE:I heckled.
LEADFEMALE:So did I.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it just wasn't the same.
SUPMALE:I guess we missed you guys.
LEADFEMALE:Oh-ho, hey, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:We missed you, too.
OTHERMALE:Oh, good, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:That-that that means a lot.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, hey, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? - Look, uh, I know how you feel about me.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, I mean, let's put it this way.
SUPMALE:It's not totally inconceivable that Mallory could've done worse than me.
SUPFEMALE:You told him.
LEADMALE:Just drop everything right here.
LEADMALE:We can straighten it all up in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this turned out great.
SUPFEMALE:We logged over 500 miles, - and not a marshmallow was roasted.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I hope we didn't make you feel like you had to follow us up there.
LEADFEMALE:It's just some crazy idea we had.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, Mom, it was our fault.
LEADMALE:We should've gone with you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we felt guilty about not going up there in the first place.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, maybe next time.
SUPFEMALE:You mean, we have to do this again? It's usually not this bad, Andy, believe me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, normally we sit around the fire, we have a nice big dinner beans out of little tin cups.
OTHERFEMALE:Which reminds me, I'm really hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:Jen, check it out, I got something here for you.
LEADFEMALE:Ew, what's that? Well, it's just like beef jerky, but it's only healthier.
OTHERMALE:It's turkey jerky.
SUPMALE:See, I-I keep it in my pocket, and by the end of the day, it's cooked.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just stick with the marshmallows.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, we're camping.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh I notice there's a full moon out there tonight.
LEADFEMALE:No, Dad, no! - No, no! - Please, no, no.
LEADMALE:I'm just okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:Oh, you know what? I'm kind of glad this camping trip didn't work out.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, look at how much fun we're having.
LEADFEMALE:You can't plan moments like this.
LEADFEMALE:They've got to sneak up on you.
LEADMALE:I know what you mean; it's like if you've got a big party to go to and you buy a very special outfit, maybe a plaid skirt with a black blouse No, no, no! Uh, a lavender suit with a matching scarf with paisley - with a little bit of - Mal, Mal, Mal.
OTHERMALE:Just kind of move it along.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right and anyway, um, you get to the party, and it's not that great.
SUPFEMALE:But on the way home, uh, you see a beautiful moon, or a big orange cat comes and rubs itself up against your leg.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, or a complete stranger leaps out of the darkness and gives you a stock tip.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, exactly.
LEADMALE:Anyway, just for a minute, it's a special moment.
OTHERFEMALE:You could never have planned it.
LEADFEMALE:Is this a special moment? You bet it is, pal.
LEADFEMALE:Very special.
SUPMALE:That reminds me of something that John Lennon once said.
LEADMALE:"Life is what happens to you when you're busy making other plans.
SUPFEMALE:" John who? Oh, boy, do I feel old.
LEADFEMALE:One of the Beatles, honey.
LEADMALE:What are the Beatles? Oh, no, now I feel old.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Alex! - You're humming! - What is with you? You hummed the entire overture to Fiddler on the Roof.
OTHERMALE:I did not.
LEADMALE:You did! You were humming and "yidle-didling" at the same time! Look what you did, Alex! You made me smudge my sketch.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Mal.
LEADMALE:Did the crayon go outside the Smurf's hat? For your information, Alex, this is a sketch for my advanced design class.
LEADMALE:I've done a whole collection.
SUPMALE:Do you want to see it? No, Mal, I don't.
LEADMALE:You obviously don't understand how important clothes are.
SUPMALE:If we didn't have clothes, mister, we'd be naked.
LEADMALE:And if we were naked, we'd look pretty stupid wearing shoes.
SUPMALE:You know, Mal, if you were to spontaneously combust right now, those would be some pretty special last words.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello! - Hey, how was the mall? Oh, fun, fun.
LEADFEMALE:All the clerks send their love.
LEADMALE:They're so sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, they-they missed your mother, but I explained she was out of town on business, and they took it very well.
OTHERFEMALE:I got some really hot sweaters, Mal, and a belt.
OTHERMALE:Dad got attacked by women in lab coats spraying cologne.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't affect me in the slightest.
LEADFEMALE:I got it.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh Yes Yes? Yes, I'm Yes.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, okay.
LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Scarf sale at Lazarus? I just got a job at David Campbell Fashions.
OTHERFEMALE:They are the top fashion design firm in Ohio! Oh, honey, did we even know you were up for this? No, I didn't want you to know.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I didn't think I had a chance.
LEADFEMALE:They pick from the entire Grant College fashion department.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Now I know how you got the job.
LEADMALE:Everybody else sewed themselves together.
LEADMALE:Oh, now I'm in fashion.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I really, really am! Well, Mallory, you're on your way.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, you don't know.
SUPMALE:It's such an honor to be chosen for this.
OTHERMALE:You have to work long hours, you have to be on call at all times and you don't get paid.
LEADMALE:Sounds like your job, Dad.
LEADMALE:"And so, Robin Hood and Maid Marian, Friar Tuck "and Little John went back to Sherwood Forest.
SUPFEMALE:"And lived happily ever after "off the interest they were earning from Robin's investment in junk bonds.
SUPFEMALE:The end.
LEADFEMALE:" It's amazing.
SUPMALE:Each time you hear one of those classic tales, you discover something new.
OTHERMALE:Alex can really tell a story.
LEADFEMALE:This one was even better than the one about Rapunzel and her lucrative hair salon franchise.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, what, uh, what was this one about? It was about Robin Hood; how he stole from the poor and gave to the rich.
OTHERMALE:No, no, that's-that's not Robin Hood, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:That's Ronald Reagan.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there you go again, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Is that any way to treat a lame duck? I mean, what did Ronald Reagan ever do to you? He made a mockery of everything I value and hold dear.
SUPMALE:And that was just during his acting career.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Andy, I'll put you to bed.
SUPMALE:Everyone, I want you to meet Jamie Carter.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, Alex she said "Jamie," not Jimmy.
LEADMALE:You ought to get that changed.
LEADMALE:That's not fair.
LEADFEMALE:Jamie is a star designer at David Campbell Fashions where I'm gonna be an apprentice.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:I don't know if you guys remember, but in his Spring '87 collection there was this incredible mint chiffon split skirt with a matching Jacquard bolero.
LEADMALE:It was a Jamie.
SUPMALE:See, Dad I told you that was a Jamie.
LEADFEMALE:You said it was a Coco.
LEADMALE:Pay up.
LEADMALE:Come on, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Let's, uh, let's let these fashioneers design away.
LEADFEMALE:We can go out and do something manly.
LEADMALE:Let's, uh, let's go shave.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, that's okay.
LEADMALE:I have a brother just like that, so I'm used to it.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, I'm here to formally welcome you to David Campbell Fashions and to answer any questions you might have.
LEADMALE:This is so exciting.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's not all that glamorous, really.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a lot of menial work, you know, cutting fabric, basic sewing.
LEADMALE:Oh, I can do that.
LEADMALE:And also running errands and making coffee.
LEADMALE:No problem.
OTHERMALE:I'm great at that.
LEADFEMALE:Coffee, tea, cocoa, any of the hot water beverages.
LEADMALE:Um, also, Jamie, I-I have these designs I did for school and I'd really love to hear what you have to say.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mallory these are very good.
LEADMALE:Especially for someone with so little training.
LEADFEMALE:You really have a lot of talent in this area.
LEADMALE:I've-I've done a whole line.
LEADMALE:It's called "Dress For Your Fear Of Success.
LEADFEMALE:" - Hmm - Huh? It's for the young businesswoman.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? These clothes say, "Yes, I'm competent.
SUPFEMALE:"Yes, I'm making a bold statement.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'm a woman.
OTHERMALE:Can I help you?" I also have this idea to design something where, if your panty line is showing, a little bell goes off.
LEADMALE:Uh, oh, and also, if you accidentally tuck your skirt into your panty hose, you get an electric shock.
OTHERFEMALE:When we're finished here, do you want to go to lunch? Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
LEADMALE:Jamie, this has been the most exciting week of my life.
SUPMALE:I mean, I cannot believe I got to see the new David Campbell fashions before anybody else at my school.
SUPFEMALE:You said this wasn't glamorous, but it really is.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God, it's David Campbell, and I'm sewn to a dummy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Jamie? Oh, David, let me introduce you.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mallory Keaton, our new apprentice.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:I love your hair.
OTHERFEMALE:Jamie, I love your new designs.
LEADMALE:It's been quite a while since we've seen anything new from you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:It just kind of came to me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think we should share them with everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, please.
LEADMALE:Now? No, no, you don't have to.
SUPMALE:Don't be silly.
LEADMALE:Yvette's going to model.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you had done some new designs.
LEADMALE:You're so modest.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm really not.
LEADMALE:No, you are.
LEADMALE:I mean, all this time you've been doing these designs, and you still had time to show a new apprentice the ropes? Isn't this exciting? Bone-chilling.
SUPMALE:This is Jamie's latest creation.
LEADFEMALE:Very nice.
LEADMALE:Dress for your fear of success.
LEADFEMALE:This design allows the young professional woman to assert herself, yet keep every bit of her femininity.
LEADFEMALE:It's beautiful.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I go now.
SUPMALE:I want that in tomorrow's show.
SUPFEMALE:You've done it again, kid.
LEADFEMALE:It's over, Alex.
LEADMALE:It's not over, Jen.
OTHERMALE:It's not over until the fat bishop sings.
LEADFEMALE:Well, tell him to start warbling, pal, because you're looking at checkmate.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, look out behind you! Nice try, Alex.
SUPMALE:Jen, I'm serious! Jen, it's a monster! Jen, it's a beast.
LEADFEMALE:It's a giant furry creature! Jen, I mean it! What do you think I am, still six years old? I'm gonna turn around, you're gonna knock the pieces off the board? No.
LEADMALE:Jen it's hideous.
OTHERFEMALE:Jen! No, monster, don't touch her! Leave her alone! She's my sister! I love her! Aah! Oops.
OTHERMALE:You're seriously ill.
LEADFEMALE:You know that, don't you? That may be true, but I'm also undefeated.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Where you been? You guys are not gonna believe this.
SUPMALE:I'm so confused.
SUPMALE:Just generally, or is this something specific? Why? What happened? Jamie Carter, she stole the designs I did for school.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, she did what? She took my designs and she presented them to David Campbell as her own.
OTHERMALE:David loved them.
LEADMALE:They're gonna be in the new collection tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Well, that's awful, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you gonna do? I don't know.
SUPMALE:What do you mean, you don't know? You're gonna go in there, you're gonna tell him what she did.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think I could bring myself to do that, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:It's just not me.
LEADMALE:Are you saying you're just gonna do nothing, just chalk it up as a learning experience? I guess so.
SUPMALE:Is it possible maybe just once a learning experience could be fun? What about calling Mom? She'll know what to do.
SUPMALE:No, I want to handle this on my own.
LEADFEMALE:So don't tell Dad either, okay? I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:My first experience in the fashion world, and look what happens.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, is it always like this, Alex? Is this what the business world is like? Lying, stealing, cheating, corruption? If it's done right, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Then I can't compete.
SUPMALE:I can't live my life like this.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mal, I'm kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Mal, I'm kidding.
OTHERMALE:No, it should be tough.
LEADMALE:It should be competitive, but-but it should also be fair.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, lying and stealing should not be a part of it.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I just have to believe this is gonna come back to her.
LEADFEMALE:You know, her karma will get her.
SUPMALE:Yeah, there's something we can hang our hat on.
SUPMALE:Her karma will get her.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:It's pretty much a fact, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, whatever you put out there, it comes right back at you.
SUPFEMALE:Get out of here.
LEADMALE:No, it's a never-ending cycle of cosmic retaliation.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:It's true.
LEADFEMALE:If you're mean or petty or vengeful, that type of energy flows out around you, and into the universe that you inhabit.
LEADMALE:If you're negative or selfish, concerned only about yourself and your own feelings, soon that negativity will envelop you and become the very air that you breathe.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doomed.
OTHERMALE:It's packed out there; everybody ready? - Yeah, I'm ready.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Joe, you work with Renee.
SUPMALE:Jamie, you work with, uh, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:But I really - You have a problem with that? - No.
OTHERFEMALE:Not at all.
OTHERMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have a problem with that? No, I'm fine.
SUPMALE:Okay, everybody, let's go.
SUPMALE:No, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:That's not the way it goes.
SUPFEMALE:No, Mallory, leave it, I like it that way.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's wrong.
OTHERMALE:Mallory, you are the apprentice.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I know a little something about this design.
OTHERFEMALE:Jamie, it's bunching up in back.
LEADFEMALE:It looks fine.
SUPMALE:No, I'm telling you, it's bunchy.
LEADMALE:And I'm telling you it's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Yvette, is it possible for you to stop complaining just once? Say it, don't spray it.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:I'm I'm sorry, I didn't know you were getting breast.
LEADMALE:Dressed.
SUPMALE:I'm s Alex Alex, what are you doing here? I, um, just I came by to wish you luck, Mal.
LEADMALE:Oh, good luck, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:I just wanted No, no, no, this is totally wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Who did you? Who did him? No, I'm s Thank you, thank you.
LEADMALE:Did you, uh, did you confront her? Alex, I can handle it myself, okay? No, you're not handling it, Mal.
OTHERMALE:I know you.
SUPMALE:You're you're too soft.
LEADMALE:You're too forgiving, you know? You're too good for your own good.
LEADMALE:Ouch, man! I am not a pincushion, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Alex, I appreciate your concern, but I have a lot of work to do here.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I just don't like to see you taken advantage of.
LEADMALE:They love me.
LEADMALE:Will someone stop Dad before he goes around again? Dad, what are you doing? Mal, Mal, I never really knew what you saw in the fashion world, but now that I've had a taste of it, I'm hooked.
LEADMALE:It's great, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm gonna go out and watch the rest of the show.
LEADMALE:Okay, yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Dad I hate my hair.
SUPMALE:Jamie, I love this suit more and more every time I see it.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:It will be the hit of the new season.
SUPFEMALE:I think it's the best work you've ever done.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, grab that box of bracelets, please.
LEADMALE:I need those bracelets.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:That is my outfit.
LEADMALE:I made that jacket, it took me months.
LEADMALE:How can you stand here and smile and take the credit for it? You really don't understand the business world, do you, Mallory? No, I don't, Jamie.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you explain it to me? Explain how someone can pretend to be your friend and pretend to like you, and then turn around and stab you in the back.
SUPMALE:Why did you do this to me? Because I'm no good anymore.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm just burnt out, okay? The ideas are gone, and if I didn't come up with something soon, I was gonna be gone, too.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? You've been the star designer here for five years.
SUPMALE:Oh, let me tell you something.
SUPFEMALE:In this business, you are only as good as your last design.
SUPFEMALE:But that doesn't give you any right You don't know what it's like for me.
SUPMALE:I sit in front of that drawing board night after night, waiting for the ideas to come and nothing happens.
SUPMALE:I-I look at my old drawings, and I have to ask myself, "Why can't I do this anymore?" Let's just get this over with.
SUPMALE:Uh, David? - Yes? Uh, Mallory has something she wants to say to you.
OTHERMALE:Yes, Mallory, what is it? Um uh I-I just wanted I-I-I really appreciate this opportunity.
LEADMALE:It's really been great.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:It's nice having you here.
LEADMALE:You know, this would be much easier if you would just hate me.
SUPMALE:It'd be easier for me, too, but I can't do that, okay? If it's any consolation, my brother hates you.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it, people.
LEADMALE:The show's over.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Okay, everyone, let's take a bow, huh? Come on.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:What a night.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you were the hit of the show, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Just glad none of my peers were there to witness it.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you let me in on what was happening, Mal? Well, I wanted to handle it myself, Dad.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're a parent, and you always want to make it all better.
LEADMALE:And you usually do.
SUPMALE:But I wanted to make it all better by myself.
LEADMALE:Well, you handled yourself tonight with grace and dignity.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I could say the same thing for you, Dad.
LEADMALE:You know, I guess this is mostly my fault for being so naive.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I've always looked at the world through rose-tinted glasses in expensive Italian frames.
LEADMALE:I gotta stop doing that.
SUPMALE:Whoa, Mal, no, you don't.
SUPFEMALE:You don't, okay? You go through life trusting and always believing that the best is gonna happen.
LEADFEMALE:You can't give that up.
OTHERFEMALE:You're helping, nurturing, reaching out to people.
LEADFEMALE:That's what life is all about, Mal.
SUPMALE:Whoa, where am I? I should have said something.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, doesn't this make me kind of a I don't know, a pansy? Oh, no, no, no listen, not at all.
LEADFEMALE:If anything, it gives you strength of character.
SUPFEMALE:No, not a pansy.
SUPMALE:More like a rhododendron.
SUPFEMALE:I'm proud of you, Mal.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:So, kids, what do you say? Should I go into modeling professionally? You do that, and I'm transferring to a high school in China.
SUPFEMALE:That color's all wrong for you.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mal, you doing okay? I don't know, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I never thought the fashion world would be like this.
SUPFEMALE:I had this, I had this vision of, of, of what it would be like.
LEADFEMALE:That it'd be a bunch of designers, all working together, creating beautiful clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Then people would pop their heads into other people's offices and say, "Does this need a raglan sleeve or a dolman sleeve or a kimono sleeve?" And I'd say, "No, a regular set-in drop sleeve will be fine.
LEADMALE:" And then we'd all laugh and go to lunch.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that'd be great, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Course, there's a fine line between what you're describing and a mental institution.
LEADMALE:Mal, you're good, you know? Your-your designs were the best in the show.
SUPMALE:Nobody can take that away from you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's Jamie.
SUPMALE:All right, well, good night, Mal.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, Mal, count the silverware when she leaves.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Can I come in? - Sure.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing here? I mean, it seemed to me that there was nothing more to say.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes, there is.
LEADFEMALE:I told David.
LEADFEMALE:You told him? Why? Because I couldn't live with myself.
LEADMALE:How could I do that to someone like you? How could I do that at all? You don't need to steal, Jamie.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I've seen your work it's incredible.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you're in a slump right now, but you'll come out of it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when I saw your sketches, they were so wonderful.
OTHERFEMALE:They were so alive and fresh and They reminded me of what I was once.
SUPFEMALE:I think I almost convinced myself they were mine.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm so sorry, Mallory.
SUPMALE:Can you forgive me? Yeah, I can forgive you.
OTHERMALE:'Cause you know, I was thinking.
SUPMALE:If my designs were good enough for someone like you to steal, then they're good enough for someone to buy.
SUPFEMALE:And maybe I really do have what it takes.
LEADFEMALE:You definitely do.
LEADMALE:You know, I told David about your other sketches, how good they are and he wants to meet with you.
SUPMALE:Really? - Uh-huh.
OTHERFEMALE:That's great.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Mallory, you're really gonna go far.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe, one day, you can even give me some pointers.
LEADMALE:Oh, you know, I have one of your skirts.
LEADFEMALE:And to tell you the truth, in the back, It's a little bunchy.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE: In August, Dukakis looked like shoo-in.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that was before he got into the tank.
LEADFEMALE:Now we've got Dennis the Menace as vice president.
LEADMALE:You know the worst thing about Bush winning's gonna be? 
OTHERMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:Next time, I'm voting for the front-runner, no matter what he stands for.
LEADMALE: - Hey.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
LEADMALE:All right, Alex, let us have it.
OTHERFEMALE:We're ready.
OTHERMALE:You people underestimate me.
SUPFEMALE:The question is not whether we are Democrats or Republicans.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? We are Americans.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever differences we had during the campaign, we must now set aside.
SUPFEMALE:I want a kinder gentler nation.
OTHERMALE: Remember you fought the good fight, okay? You have nothing to be ashamed of.
OTHERFEMALE:    I bet we've been together for a million years And I bet we'll be together for a million more Oh, it's like I started breathing On the night we kissed And I can't remember what I ever did before What would we do, baby, without us? What would we do, baby, without us? And there ain't no nothing we can't love each other through What would we do, baby, without us? Ah, good, good, good! You're all here! You know what I have behind my back? - 
LEADFEMALE:The fridge.
LEADMALE: We have no idea, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! A piece of paper.
LEADMALE:What a stunner, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I've never seen that done up close.
LEADFEMALE:This is an electricity bill.
LEADMALE:From the size of it, you'd think we were major shareholders of Ohio Electric.
LEADMALE:I own some.
LEADMALE:Does anyone know who the chief waster of electricity is?  - I bet it's one of us.
LEADMALE: I bet it's one of us.
SUPFEMALE:I did a little spot-check of your bedrooms last night, and I came up with some interesting data.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, I need my lights to study.
LEADMALE:So do I.
LEADMALE: I need my light to study, too.
SUPMALE:Uh-uh-uh, it seems that Jennifer has forgotten she left her air conditioner on.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer! It's almost winter.
SUPMALE:It's not even hot.
LEADFEMALE:Well, evidently it is, when you're under your electric blanket.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, now that we know who the culprit is, maybe she can just move out, and the rest of us can get on with our energy-efficient lives.
LEADMALE:The utility bills in this house are too high, and they must come down have I made myself clear? - 
OTHERMALE:Yes, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Crystalline, Pop.
OTHERFEMALE:I think these are brown enough.
SUPFEMALE:So, what are you doing, Andy? My history homework.
OTHERFEMALE:Your history homework? Alex is teaching me.
LEADFEMALE:Today we're covering the Industrial 
OTHERMALE:A capitalist perspective.
LEADFEMALE:Well, somebody's got to supplement that joke of a first grade curriculum.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, Andy, maybe you can skip that today, because Nick's bringing over someone for you to play with his little nephew Rocco.
OTHERFEMALE:Rocco? He's so cute.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he's just like Nick.
SUPMALE:Of course he's not as sophisticated.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he is only five years old.
LEADFEMALE:So he's still got a year to go.
SUPFEMALE:For your information, Alex, Rocco's a very sweet little boy.
LEADFEMALE:He's staying with Nick for a week.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're really gonna like him, Andy.
LEADMALE:Neat! When is he coming over? Any minute now.
SUPMALE:All right, okay listen, before Nick and, uh, Rocco get here, maybe we can pack a little more fun in.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I got a surprise for you, pal.
OTHERMALE:I was gonna save it for later, but I think you've earned it.
LEADMALE:In the living room, on the table, is a book.
LEADFEMALE:The Socio- and Economic Impact of the Cotton Gin.
LEADFEMALE:It's yours, pal.
SUPMALE:Yay! Alex, you spoil him.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mal, listen, I think it's nice that, uh that Nick's bringing his nephew over.
OTHERFEMALE:I just don't want you to get your hopes up, all right? - What do you mean? - It's just that I don't know if Andy's gonna be that interested in playing with Rocco.
SUPMALE:I mean, he's really excited about the Industrial Revolution, and, you know, it's hard, at his age, to really fake that-that common touch.
SUPMALE: Oh, they're here.
LEADFEMALE: Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE: Everybody, this is my nephew Rocco.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:So, well, where's Andy, huh? Well, Nick, uh,  You know, Andy's a little shy.
LEADFEMALE:So I-I would Hi.
OTHERMALE:Is that an earring? Yeah, I would let you touch it, but my ear's kind of infected.
SUPMALE:Neat.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I'll show you my room.
SUPMALE: Cool! We're working on his shyness.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! Are you okay? Dad, that's the third time I've cut myself.
LEADFEMALE:Can we please have a little more light? There's more than enough light.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't there, Jennifer? I don't know, is that you, Dad? Dad, please? All of them, Steven.
OTHERMALE:All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't aware we were going to perform microsurgery in this area.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go wash my hair and dry it by candlelight.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, light.
LEADMALE:All right, can we have a little decorum here, please? It is time for Wall Street Week.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, Alex, you don't intend to use the electricity-guzzling television, do you? No, Dad, I thought I'd use the wood-burning television.
LEADMALE:Hey, Andy! Buddy, come on down! Wall Street Week is starting! Alex, Andy's not here.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Nick took him and Rocco to the mall.
SUPMALE:The mall?! Why would Nick drag Andy to the mall?  I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, Alex, nobody has to be dragged to the mall.
LEADMALE:And secondly, Andy wanted to go.
OTHERMALE:Nick is buying him a T-shirt just like Rocco's.
SUPMALE:Not-not the one with the picture of the dancing girl and a mug of beer Oh, no, no, you can't buy those in a store.
OTHERMALE:No, Rocco's mother is a waitress there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think it's nice that Nick wants to buy Andy a T-shirt.
LEADMALE:And if Andy wants his ear pierced, like his friend Rocco, I'm sure nice Nick will take him to the earring booth at the mall and get him that, too.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't exaggerate, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Nick would certainly know that we wouldn't want Andy to do that.
SUPMALE: Right, Mallory? Right, I think.
LEADMALE: This is Wall Street Week.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome back.
SUPMALE:One year ago this week, Wall Street had a I can't believe it started and Andy's not here.
LEADMALE:Now what am I supposed to do, watch Wall Street Week alone? What's wrong with that? It's just not done.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I mean, Wall Street Week is event television.
LEADMALE:It's something you got to share with your loved ones.
LEADMALE:I'd rather caught in Bloomingdale's in a house dress and flip-flops.
LEADFEMALE:Mom? Mommy? Come on, I mean, we haven't we haven't spent a lot of quality time together recently.
SUPMALE:Now's not the time to start, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Pop, guess it's just us men then, huh? I think there's a light on in the attic.
LEADMALE:Somewhere, kilowatts are escaping.
OTHERMALE:Wait, what are we doing? We're abandoning our firstborn in his hour of need.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Mom, it's fun.
SUPMALE:Well, let's sit down with him.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE: Hey! All right! - How bad can it be? Wall Street Week? Well, could be worse.
LEADFEMALE:It could be one of your dad's documentaries.
LEADMALE:So, uh, what do we do? Just, uh, just sit and watch it? No, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:You sit back, relax, let it envelop you whisk you away into the magical world of finance.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE: Throughout the ages, man has found a need to have some medium of exchange.
SUPFEMALE:So true.
LEADMALE:That is so true.
LEADMALE: Early man used shiny stones for this purpose.
OTHERFEMALE:On the other hand, you might find more solace in the report by a Vanderbilt University psychologist  Look at that graph.
LEADFEMALE:Chic-a-chic-a-boom.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, we are back, and we had a great time at the mall.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, and I got a T-shirt.
SUPFEMALE: Wow! That-that's great, that's great, Andy look, you're late.
LEADMALE:Wall Street Week's already started.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Alex, Rocco bought me this great truck.
LEADMALE:Oh, that-that was real nice of you, Rocco, but you didn't have to get that for Andy.
LEADMALE:I had some spare dough.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, I almost forgot.
LEADMALE:We made a special stop at the earring booth  I bought these for Mal.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:What, they're too busy? 
LEADFEMALE:All right Okay, Andy, you missed the beginning of the show, but you're in luck.
SUPMALE:I taped it; I'll watch it again later with you, if you want.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Alex, you're using the VCR and the television at the same time? Now, that's it, no more electricity for you.
LEADMALE:Did you? - Come on, Steven.
LEADMALE:It's time for your nap.
SUPMALE:You can dream about an electricity-free world.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Elyse, somewhere in this house there is current flowing.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's not in your brain.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Andy, let's go play truck convoy in your room.
LEADMALE: Yeah, let's go.
LEADMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, Andy.
SUPMALE: - Andy, Andy, don't you want to watch the show? I could watch that any time.
LEADMALE:I want to go upstairs and play truckers.
SUPMALE:Why don't you come up and help us, Alex? You can watch for smokies.
SUPFEMALE:You don't want to play truckers, do you? Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:It's fun.
OTHERMALE: from the world's biggest creditor nation to its biggest debtor.
LEADFEMALE: 
SUPFEMALE:And the only way we got away with it was that foreigners seemed to like our Well, I'm glad I caught you all in here together.
LEADMALE:Do you know what this is? I'm not gonna fall for this one again, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the water bill.
LEADFEMALE:Now, what are you people doing bathing in the stuff? Well, I know I'm not the problem.
LEADMALE:I take a shower every morning for 35 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:To be exact A personal best.
SUPMALE:Elyse, I clocked it Steven, don't tell me you timed my shower! Jennifer Yes, Daddy? Jennifer, you came in at a little over an hour.
LEADFEMALE:Morning and evening.
LEADFEMALE:I like to think in the shower.
LEADFEMALE:Twice a day? Well, in the morning, I plan out my day, and at night, I recap it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, from now on, think with the water off.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'll try, but it'll be hard to consider it a shower under those circumstances.
LEADFEMALE:Dismissed.
LEADFEMALE:Did you really need 15 minutes, Elyse? I wish I could say I'm not disappointed.
OTHERMALE:I'm getting dressed.
OTHERFEMALE:Please excuse me.
LEADMALE:You can't say she's not polite.
LEADMALE:Hey, have you guys seen Andy? Yeah, he's out with Nick and Rocco.
LEADMALE:The three of them went down to the interstate to eat at a truck stop.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, it was Rocco's idea.
OTHERFEMALE:He can only digest fried foods.
LEADFEMALE:All right, okay is it just me, or do you guys notice a change in Andy? What do you mean, a change? It's like his personality's had a lube job.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think he's having a lot of fun with Rocco and Nick, if that's what you mean.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh, uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Uh, what else? What are you trying to get at, Alex? All right, okay, I know this is gonna sound crazy but I get the feeling that Andy's not that interested in me anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it's ridiculous, I know, but it-it's almost like he finds me boring.
LEADFEMALE:You?! Come on.
SUPMALE:Boring? Never.
LEADFEMALE:Annoying, yes.
SUPMALE:Stuffy, absolutely.
SUPMALE:Pompous, you bet.
LEADMALE:Okay, but not boring.
LEADMALE:Um I don't know if you guys were-were young boys around Andy's age, I mean, wouldn't you find me exciting? I mean, someone to look up to, someone to emulate.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not sure what emulate means, but I'm going with a no.
LEADMALE:I do know what emulate means, and I'm also going with no.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Alex, don't worry.
OTHERMALE:Andy's just being exposed to something he's never seen before with 
LEADMALE:Fun.
LEADFEMALE:And he's finding it exciting.
LEADMALE:But look, soon Rocco will leave, and Andy will have no choice but to hang out with you again.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:If it's any consolation, I'm still fascinated by you.
LEADFEMALE: Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, no, Jennifer's not here right now.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She'll call you back.
LEADMALE:Uh, no uh, wait, wait.
SUPMALE:She'll write you a letter.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I have here? A list of your favorite foods? No, this is our phone bill.
SUPFEMALE: Very large phone bill.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I hardly ever use the phone No, no, no, no, it's not it's not you, Alex.
LEADMALE:And it's not me.
LEADMALE: It's those chatty women we live with.
OTHERMALE:Magpies.
LEADFEMALE:Dad - I've-I've I've watched them, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Yack, yack, yack, yack, yack.
SUPFEMALE:Long pause, then yack, yack, yack, yack, yack.
LEADMALE:Again.
LEADMALE:  They don't care.
LEADFEMALE:You're one foot out the window, Dad.
SUPMALE:I'm not kidding.
SUPFEMALE:  
SUPFEMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPMALE:How was the grease? - Oh, it was great.
OTHERMALE:Great! You know what? You got to come to the diner with us.
OTHERMALE:They got this new deep fryer.
LEADMALE:Makes everything taste like chicken.
LEADMALE:Sorry I missed it.
SUPFEMALE:We brought you something.
SUPFEMALE:For me? Well, I'll cherish it.
SUPFEMALE:What is it? It's a truck cab deodorizer.
SUPFEMALE:How did you know?  We got something for you, too, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:Huh? Oh.
SUPMALE: Oh, what's this? Well, we're not sure.
LEADMALE:You know, it's either fish sticks, of French fries.
OTHERMALE:But it's gonna taste like chicken.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Alex, we're going to the dirt bike race now.
LEADMALE:You want to come? It's loud, noisy and dirty.
LEADFEMALE: Ah, well, that's-that's a hard offer to turn down, but, uh, I think I'm gonna give that a pass.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:See you later.
OTHERFEMALE: All right.
OTHERMALE: Okay.
OTHERMALE: Dad, is this not driving you crazy? Well, it's the thought that counts.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, don't you know what's going on here? I mean, you-you've been so busy cutting down costs, you haven't even noticed.
SUPMALE:Dad, we're losing our son.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sure, when he does something bad, it's our son, huh? What-what what seems to be the problem, Alex? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it's 
LEADFEMALE:What? Ever since Rocco came into Andy's life, I mean, it's nothing but-but games, toys, fun, fun, fun.
SUPMALE:Is that the kind of six-year-old that you want? Want? Well-well, when it comes to the behavior of my children, want is something I gave up a long time ago.
LEADMALE:Well, what do you mean? Well, take you, for instance.
LEADMALE:Um, when you were first born, as you know, we called you Moonbeam.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, all right.
LEADMALE:Shh! Shh! - Well You wore love beads.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE: Tie-dyed pajamas with a little flap in the back.
SUPFEMALE:You listened to Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger.
SUPMALE:You were a child of the earth.
SUPFEMALE:Laughing, loving, sharing.
SUPFEMALE:Caring.
LEADFEMALE:Then one day, you snapped.
LEADMALE:What are you getting at, Dad? You have to be careful with Andy.
LEADMALE:You push too hard, you'll lose him.
LEADMALE:Then you'll have to wait for him to come back.
LEADFEMALE:That's how it was with you.
LEADMALE:All right, so, uh so when did I come back? We're still waiting.
LEADMALE:This land is your land This land is my land Nah Do you know what this is? THE 
LEADFEMALE:A bill.
OTHERFEMALE: That's right.
SUPMALE:It's the gas bill.
SUPMALE:Steven this house is heated with oil.
LEADMALE:The only thing in this house that runs on gas is the kitchen stove.
OTHERFEMALE:That bill can't be more than $15.
SUPMALE:Yes, but I think with a little efficiency, we can shave off $1.
OTHERMALE:50.
LEADFEMALE:What? - Steven Yes? Yes, Elyse? You really do need to seek professional help.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know what that will cost? All right, Andy! You ready to head out to the dirt bike races? - I sure am.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, uh, how about you, Alex? You sure you don't want to come? Ah, no, I don't think I'm gonna make it this time.
LEADFEMALE:But you guys go ahead, have a great time.
LEADFEMALE:I'll stay here and hold down the fort.
SUPMALE:You know, Alex, you're not exactly my type of guy, but for the kind of guy you are, you're okay.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks, Rocco.
SUPMALE:Underneath that layer of 10-40 oil you're a pretty good guy yourself.
SUPMALE:All right, we're out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Come on anybody else coming, huh? Yeah, I'd love to come; I've never been.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mal, you're gonna love it.
LEADMALE:Tonight they are crowning the Mud Queen.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, uh, how about you, Jen? You want to come? Are you kidding? I never miss a mud coronation.
LEADFEMALE: Hey, Alex, you want to come? Uh, no, pal.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I think I'm gonna pass.
LEADMALE:But you go and have a good time, and when you come home, you tell me all about it, okay? - 
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right, bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE: Come on, Andy.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's go! - 
LEADMALE:See you later! - Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE: Well, you did the right thing, Alex.
SUPMALE:You showed some real grace, there.
LEADMALE:Ah you know.
LEADMALE:Want him to be happy.
SUPMALE:You know, sometimes, honey, you're a little hard on him.
LEADMALE:Sometimes you're a little intense with him, but I-I'd really rather it be that way than have you just ignore him.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, if you're gonna make a mistake with him, it's gonna be out of love.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing like a mom.
LEADFEMALE:What can I say? Hey  - 
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:What's up? You forget something? No, I just decided to stay home.
LEADMALE:What? Hey, you all right? You feeling okay? You eat too many of those chicken fish sticks? I'm fine; I'd just rather be with you, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Uh I mean, 'cause you know, I-I don't want to force you into anything.
LEADFEMALE:You're not.
LEADMALE:I really missed you.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:No kidding.
SUPMALE:What, specifically, did you miss? Don't press me.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:I missed you, too, buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:I missed you big.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, too.
OTHERMALE:And, hey I'll tell you 
SUPFEMALE:You tell me what you want to do right now, we'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:I'd really like to play truckers.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:All right, truckers it is.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, um can I be president of the truck company? Sure, no problem.
OTHERMALE:I'm chairman of the board.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:What are you guys doing here? Mallory's reading Dad's tarot cards.
OTHERMALE:Just watch.
OTHERMALE:She's gonna predict a bright, rosy future.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:It can't be.
OTHERMALE:This is horrible.
LEADMALE:What? What is it? Somebody got jam on this card.
LEADFEMALE:I've had enough.
LEADMALE:No, Dad, please, sit, please.
SUPMALE:There's nothing to worry about.
LEADMALE:I will show you that the cards know all.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Says here that, in the recent past, you had a minor accident.
LEADMALE:Is that true? Ma-Mallory, two days ago, while trimming my beard, I cut myself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You knew that.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, but the cards didn't.
SUPMALE:Am I mentioned here at all? Oh, yes, Mom, you're in the home area.
SUPMALE:You're represented by the high priestess.
LEADFEMALE:See, you're holding the three babies.
LEADFEMALE:That would be, uh, Jen, Andy and me.
LEADMALE:Well, where's Alex? He's probably represented by the newt in the corner.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I will never let you drag me to one of these things again.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't understand; how can a human being not enjoy the Leland Economics Jamboree and Clambake? I mean, that's absurd.
SUPMALE:You know, that was the best one we've ever had.
SUPMALE:We've never had a kissing booth before.
SUPFEMALE:Kissing money is disgusting, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What is your problem? I mean, it just seems like everything I do today is wrong, wrong, wrong.
LEADFEMALE:It's so typical of you.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:How you doing? Steven, can I see you in the other room for a minute? What for? The thing.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right, right, right.
LEADMALE:Uh, the-the thing, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, Jen, can we see you in the living room? About the thing? Alex, I think we have a serious problem here.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like I'm having a hard time relating to you.
SUPMALE:We don't even talk anymore.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? See? We're talking.
SUPMALE:Alex, let's face it, whenever the conversation veers away from politics or the economy or current events and heads towards something personal, you run like a little kid.
SUPMALE:Lauren, what do you want from me? I want you to open up.
LEADMALE:I want you to tell me what you're thinking, what you're feeling.
LEADMALE:About what?! About us! I love you, you love me.
SUPFEMALE:We're in a great place here.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, emotionally, our relationship is right here.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it should be here.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, you love me.
LEADFEMALE:We're in a great place here.
LEADMALE:Only higher up.
LEADMALE:Alex, you may not want to deal with this, but from my perspective, we got a lot of talking to do.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Lauren, Lauren And you're obviously not ready for it.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren Whoa! - See you later! Can I help you? I doubt it.
OTHERMALE:Really? I happen to know you're having some romantic difficulties.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? How do you know that? What, do the cards tell you? No, I was listening at the door.
LEADFEMALE:But the cards might help you find a solution, if only you'll believe in them.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I believe.
LEADFEMALE:Hit me.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:First you have to follow the ancient tradition passed down from generation to generation.
OTHERFEMALE:And now available in this book from Hasbro.
SUPMALE:What do I do? First we separate the cards into decks of three.
SUPMALE:Put one on your forehead and one on your knee.
LEADMALE:And this is a personal low for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I see you purchasing six sweaters.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's mine.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'm just kidding.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I see a dark-haired woman.
OTHERMALE:She's upset about something.
OTHERMALE:She's hurt.
SUPFEMALE:Her man has let her down.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Yeah, then what? Okay, she's distraught.
LEADMALE:He's devastated.
SUPFEMALE:He has no future.
SUPMALE:Oh, God.
LEADFEMALE:What? Go on.
LEADMALE:Starting to see her more clearly now.
LEADFEMALE:What, is it Lauren? No, it's Kitty Dukakis.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hey, Mom, Dad, great timing.
SUPFEMALE:Let me ask you something, okay? I been having this little problem with Lauren recently.
SUPMALE:And, uh, I don't know, she seems to think that I can't relate on an honest, intimate level.
LEADFEMALE:What do you, what do you guys do about that? Well, your mother and I make an effort every evening to, uh, have at least one, uh, deep, meaningful, uh, personal exchange.
LEADMALE:What do you talk about? Well, it's personal.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I-I smell something burning.
LEADFEMALE:I-I think it's, uh, the thing.
LEADMALE:Well, we better get in there.
LEADMALE:There's nothing worse than burnt thing.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, how you doing? Okay.
OTHERMALE:I've been thinking a lot about what we talked about this afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh Jen, do you mind? This is kind of personal.
LEADMALE:Boy, the amount of times that I'm asked to leave places.
LEADFEMALE:I should just board the "Get out of the room" express.
LEADMALE:It's leaving now.
SUPFEMALE:Whoo-whoo! Listen, Alex, I didn't mean to imply that you don't have feelings or that you're immature.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, babe I'm, uh, I'm-I'm sorry that I didn't take you seriously.
LEADMALE:All that arguing, it's not gonna get us anywhere.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, you're so right.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too.
LEADMALE:I think we should go to group therapy.
LEADFEMALE:Let's try some interpersonal communication.
SUPMALE:Bobby, tell me some more.
OTHERFEMALE:You obviously have some complex thoughts on relationships.
SUPMALE:I do.
OTHERMALE:If Janie here so much as, like, looks at another guy, she gets it or he gets it.
SUPMALE:But definitely, somebody gets it.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you think you do that, Bobby? Hey, what can I tell you? You know, I'm funny that way.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Janie, how does that make you feel? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Do you feel that it takes away from your identity at all? It depends.
LEADFEMALE:What does that mean? It's great to be here discussing relationships with the bottom of the food chain.
LEADMALE:Yes, Alex, is there something you'd like to share with the rest of us? No, I don't share.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, what is that beard you wear? Excuse me? A beard, a mask.
SUPMALE:You hide your true self.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I used to do that.
LEADMALE:I used to have a beard.
LEADMALE:She did.
SUPFEMALE:And I really miss it.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, um, I want you to face Lauren and look her in the eyes.
LEADMALE:Can you feel her energy? No, I feel Bobby's energy.
OTHERFEMALE:Why does he express hostility in that repugnant manner? Yes, Alex, why do you? I don't know.
LEADMALE:Why don't we move on? We'll come back to you.
LEADMALE:I'll be here.
LEADFEMALE:Tom, why don't you tell us some of the things that you do to keep your relationship with Vera fresh after all these years.
LEADMALE:Well, for a long time, Vera and I didn't really talk much to each other at all.
OTHERMALE:But recently, since I taught her how to use the TV remote, it's opened up a whole new area for us.
LEADFEMALE:Before, Vera wouldn't say much.
SUPMALE:Now she talks all the time.
LEADFEMALE:For example, I'll say, "Do you think Geraldo looks a little too orange today?" And Vera says "No.
OTHERFEMALE:" Let's try some free-form interpersonal communication.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren, why don't you begin by questioning your partner.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, did you have difficulty coming here today? You know that I did.
SUPMALE:I mean, why do you have to ask me that? I think it's important for you to express it.
OTHERMALE:Are you angry at Lauren for revealing personal problems between the two of you? No.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have trouble showing affection to Lauren? No.
OTHERMALE:If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be? Look, uh, I-I got to go.
LEADMALE:I just remembered something I have to do.
LEADMALE:What do you have to do? Uh, run away screaming.
SUPMALE:Alex, what's going on? Honey, l-let's just go, okay? No, I'm not leaving.
SUPMALE:This is important to me.
LEADFEMALE:It's important to us.
SUPMALE:Honey, I can't stand it here! I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't fit in here! You didn't even try! I never played poker with tarot cards before, but I think I got a full house.
LEADMALE:Let's see.
OTHERMALE:What do you got? Uh, I got three ladies in a watermelon patch and two skeletons with floppy hats.
LEADFEMALE:Beats me.
SUPFEMALE:I got dragon high.
LEADMALE:Two dwarves.
LEADMALE:Read 'em and weep.
LEADFEMALE:Four fools.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, Alex.
LEADMALE:What's all this? This, this, Dad, is what's gonna save my relationship with Lauren.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, what happened between you and Lauren? Well, I'll tell you the truth, Dad.
OTHERMALE:We had a little fight about, uh, the way I didn't fit in at that group therapy session.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's a shocker.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm going back, and it's not gonna happen again, because I'm gonna be armed to my psychological teeth.
SUPFEMALE:Interpretation of Dreams.
LEADMALE:Ah, the May issue of, uh, Popular Neurosis.
SUPMALE:Yeah, this isn't exactly thriller-diller reading for me, but, uh, I don't know, I feel like I let Lauren down.
LEADMALE:And, uh, if it's important to her for me to be in touch with my feelings, then I'm gonna read these books, gonna find out what my feelings are, and memorize them.
SUPMALE:Alex, they're gonna be able to see right through you.
SUPMALE:Mom, Mom, you're missing the point.
OTHERMALE:The important thing is not what those people think of me, but-but that Lauren believes that I really tried to open up to her.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'm doing this for her.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Jen, do you mind? This is kind of personal.
LEADMALE:I don't know why I bother leaving my room.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, the best thing you can do for Lauren is to tell her honestly how you feel about her that you love her, that you care for her.
LEADFEMALE:Nah, Dad, that's no good.
LEADMALE:In this day and age, relationships have become a-a complicated, sophisticated, intellectual phenomenon.
OTHERMALE:Piggies.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, we're late; the traffic was terrible on Court Street.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I would like to share my feelings about that with all of you.
OTHERMALE:You know, sitting there in the midst of all that bumper-to-bumper traffic, I realized that my anxiety was a manifestation of my subconscious desire to return to the womb.
LEADFEMALE:That traffic was it jammed up going both ways? Alex, you amaze me.
LEADMALE:You seem to have really blossomed since our last meeting.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Davidson.
SUPMALE:Well, you're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Well, has anybody had any further thoughts about their relationship since we last met? Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh.
LEADMALE:Alex, I'm surprised.
LEADMALE:Well, honey, I'm here, and darn it, I'd like to participate.
LEADMALE:All right, Alex.
LEADMALE:All right, um Let me share this with all of you.
LEADMALE:I've been doing a lot of serious soul searching since our last meeting, because I felt that I didn't come across to the group in a positive light.
LEADMALE:All of you felt that I was holding back on my true emotions.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Afraid to confront my real feelings.
OTHERMALE:Well, you were right.
SUPMALE:I was afraid.
LEADMALE:And so today, I'm here to stand before all of you and say I'm Alex P.
SUPMALE:Keaton, and I'm repressed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bravo! Thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm s I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, this is wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:You're repressed; I am so happy for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, honey, and I-I'd be happy, too, if, you know, I wasn't so darn repressed.
LEADFEMALE:This is great.
LEADMALE:Now that you know what the problem is, you can really dig down and address the real emotional issues.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, hold on, Lauren.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Alex has made a major breakthrough.
LEADMALE:I think that is quite an accomplishment for one night.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:All right, let's move on to somebody else.
LEADFEMALE:Vera, how about you? We'll come back to you, Vera.
OTHERMALE:Lauren, how about you? How do you feel your relationship is working? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:No complaints.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you feel that you hold back in the relationship at all? Um no.
OTHERFEMALE:You hesitated.
SUPMALE:Did I? Yes, you did.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, honey.
SUPMALE:Do what I did.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell them you're repressed, they'll get off your back, they'll start torturing Vera.
LEADMALE:But I'm not repressed.
SUPMALE:Well, then why don't you just tell them some of the things that bother you about our relationship.
LEADMALE:I mean, the way the way I avoid intimacy, meaningful conversation, make you go to-to clambakes and kiss money.
LEADMALE:Well, Alex does, uh, tend to emotionally shut me out at important moments.
SUPMALE:To kind of build a wall around himself.
LEADFEMALE:We want to know about you, Lauren.
LEADMALE:How does that wall affect you? No, I recognize it for what it 
LEADMALE:A projection of his latent insecurity.
SUPFEMALE:Lauren, not in psychological terms.
LEADFEMALE:How do you really feel? Well, I, um I know what you're all doing here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm quite familiar with this dynamic.
LEADFEMALE:It's not a dynamic, Lauren.
OTHERFEMALE:It's your feelings we're after.
SUPMALE:Come on, Lauren, how do you feel? Lauren, you're not going to accomplish anything until you let go.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Lauren, you can do it.
LEADMALE:We're all here for you.
OTHERMALE:All right, look, everybody hold it for a minute, all right? If Lauren doesn't want to talk, that's okay.
LEADMALE:I mean, I know how she feels.
SUPMALE:How do you really know if she doesn't express it? - I'm sorry, I have to go.
LEADMALE:Wait Lauren.
SUPFEMALE:Lauren! Okay, it says here in the relationship area that you're very happy and secure in your relationship.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh, that's true.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:There's somebody else in the picture.
SUPMALE:Another woman.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, how could you? What? What? W-What'd I do? The cards say you're seeing another woman! Hey, they're lying I'm gonna knock their heads off! Should we put a stop to this? Oh, it's harmless enough, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Mal, you know you are the only one for me.
LEADMALE:I'll prove it to you; I'll marry you.
LEADFEMALE:All right, that's enough! Hello, uh, Lauren.
LEADMALE:Hi, hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Is Alex here? Yeah, he's in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:That's him.
LEADFEMALE:What's say we all go in the living room, watch some TV? There's a good movie on.
SUPMALE:The Thing.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse, I've seen that a thous Oh, The Thing/ Yeah, why didn't you you say so? Oh, I love The Thing.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, everybody out.
LEADMALE:They do that very smoothly, don't they? So, how you doing? Are you okay? Not really.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what happened to me today.
LEADFEMALE:Someone asked me a few questions, and I ran out of the room like some kind of wild woman.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of psychologist am I gonna be? Not a real busy one.
LEADMALE:I've never admitted this before, but I have a real problem confronting my own emotions.
SUPMALE:I don't know, I love listening to other people and helping them.
LEADMALE:But I don't really like talking about myself.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I love talking about myself.
OTHERMALE:Just not in front of Bobby and Janie.
LEADMALE:Well, you didn't seem to have a problem opening up to them today.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you didn't believe that, did you? I mean, I was just uh, telling them what they wanted to hear.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I'm not repressed.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADMALE:All right, I just don't like to stand around talking about it.
LEADFEMALE:I only did that for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Where does that leave us? You said what you didn't really feel and I panicked.
LEADFEMALE:We're in the same place we were when we started this.
OTHERMALE:Jen, do you mind? That's it, I'm moving out.
SUPFEMALE:You know, we got to get this thing worked out, so she can feel free to roam the house.
LEADMALE:Look, Alex, I'm sorry that I dragged you into this.
SUPMALE:I just want to be closer to you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to feel like you're holding things back from me.
LEADMALE:I'm a very private person.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, there are things about me that nobody knows.
LEADFEMALE:There are things about me I don't even know.
LEADFEMALE:But I've opened up more to you than I ever have to anyone else.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, when I look in your eyes, I feel like I can tell you anything.
LEADMALE:Really? All right, well, tell me something that you've never told anyone.
SUPMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:All right, you got to promise you're not gonna tell anybody this, I mean, not a living soul.
LEADFEMALE:I promise.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm worried about Quayle.
LEADFEMALE:And, um And there's-there's one, uh, one other thing that I got to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm not really sure how this is gonna go over with you.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:There is a wall around me.
LEADFEMALE:I built it.
LEADFEMALE:And it's real high.
LEADFEMALE:And it's that, um that controlled Alex that I want the world to see.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm just afraid that if I let that wall down, that you're gonna see who I really am and you're not gonna love me.
LEADMALE:There, I said it.
LEADMALE:Is the wall down now? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I still love you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:We did it.
SUPFEMALE:We won.
SUPMALE: Yay! You know how lucky you are, Andy? Born under Reagan, raised under Bush.
SUPMALE:I mean, with any luck at all, you will have a completely Democrat-free childhood.
LEADMALE:I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What about Dad? He took it really hard.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, you know, what can you say? The man was, uh, completely Dukakis-ized.
LEADMALE:He said you were Bush-whacked.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I feel great! - Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I bet I know why, Jen.
LEADMALE:It's a shopper's sky.
OTHERMALE:Shopper's sky? I knew you'd like that.
SUPMALE:Oh, I didn't realize that another meeting of the Young Republican Gloaters Club was in session.
LEADMALE:Want to sit in? Yeah, Jen.
SUPMALE:Join us.
SUPFEMALE:Just to refresh your memory Bush won.
LEADFEMALE:I'm warning you, Alex, I've had enough of this.
LEADMALE:Read my lips.
LEADMALE:That felt good.
LEADFEMALE:Shopper's sky.
LEADMALE:What? You don't want to know, Mom.
SUPMALE: - What happened to you? We were stride-for-stride there for a while.
LEADMALE:I had to stop.
LEADFEMALE:I got a pain right here, a burning feeling.
LEADMALE:Must've been something I ate.
OTHERMALE:What'd you eat? Just my usual breakfast.
LEADFEMALE:Hearty helping of your tofu buckwheat loaf.
SUPFEMALE:Look no further, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE: There it goes again.
SUPMALE:What is that? Does it hurt really bad, Dad? Uh no, Andy, it just hurts a little.
LEADFEMALE:Think about Mickey Mouse.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Works for me.
SUPFEMALE: I don't know what to say, honey the buckwheat was fresh.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:It's it's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, Dad, Jennifer and I really need to go shopping.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, let your dad finish his pain first, dear.
LEADMALE:Well, how long are you gonna be? In just a few more good, sharp stabs, I'll be with you.
OTHERFEMALE: Well, because there's a really big sale going on, and, well, I'm sure you noticed the shopper's sky.
SUPMALE:Yes, I heard the birds singing all about it.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Oh! Don't forget to fill the tank.
SUPMALE:Okay! Feel better, Dad! - Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hope you feel better.
LEADMALE:Take a bath! The tofu was fresh, too, I swear it.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Dad, it may not be the tofu buckwheat loaf after all.
SUPMALE:Although it certainly remains our prime suspect.
LEADFEMALE:No, Dad, my guess is that you're suffering from a little-known malady called Dukakis Separation Anxiety.
LEADFEMALE:Now, there's no known cure for DSA but there is hope.
OTHERFEMALE:Hope that sufferers like yourself will stop clinging rigidly to the Democratic Party.
LEADMALE:Hope that they will join me and millions of other jolly, pain-free Republicans for four more years of joy.
LEADMALE:Do it, Dad.
SUPMALE:Join us.
LEADMALE:Join the Republican Party and hurt no more.
LEADFEMALE:Go away.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Come on, George.
SUPFEMALE: - Hi, Andy.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:I'm telling! I don't care, Andy; enough's enough.
LEADMALE:Alex, come quick! Jen's got George! Freeze, Democrat! Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Frisk her.
LEADMALE:Alex, we all live in this house together.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Not you, missy.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to jail.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, really? And what for? The, uh, the unlicensed dismantling of the Columbus White House.
LEADMALE:Now give me George.
OTHERMALE:Come on, nice and slow, nothing fancy.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Okay, Alex, but I'm throwing out your Ron and Nancy pillowcases.
LEADFEMALE:Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let her out of your sight.
SUPMALE: George.
LEADFEMALE:George, George, George, George, George.
LEADFEMALE: George! Ah! Aren't you glad you listened to me, George? Huh? I told you, lose that high-pitched, squeaky voice, look people straight in the eye, and never, ever mention Pearl Harbor again.
OTHERMALE:And you did it, George.
LEADMALE:You won.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations! Of course, it's not perfect.
SUPMALE:Democrats have the Congress.
LEADMALE:All right, okay, we still have the veto.
SUPFEMALE:And if we want to, George, for the next four years, we can make sure absolutely nothing gets done.
OTHERMALE:Now, George -  Excuse me, Alex, I didn't realize you were in conference.
LEADMALE:Uh that's all right, Dad, we're just, uh, we're just winding down.
OTHERMALE:Oh, look at you, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:You look like you're obviously feeling better.
LEADMALE:Much better, thanks.
LEADMALE:I just, uh, cycled down to Darby Creek Park.
LEADMALE:You know, I think it might have been all that jogging that wasn't working for me.
OTHERFEMALE:All that, all that, uh, you know, pounding may have, uh Shifted the buckwheat?  Very possibly.
OTHERMALE:I hate when that happens.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
OTHERMALE:Well, listen, I think I'm gonna go throw that-that buckwheat loaf out, okay? Um I'll give you a call if I need a hand lifting it.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:   Elyse?  - Well, what'd they say? Mom? - What? What? Well, nothing new.
SUPMALE:He's still being examined.
OTHERMALE:You know, I've had about enough of this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna get something out of them.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:(woman speaking indistinctly over P.
LEADMALE:A.
SUPMALE:System) All right, okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:He's still being examined.
SUPMALE:They They'll let us know, you know.
LEADMALE:What do you think happened, Mom? I mean Oh, honey, we obviously don't know.
LEADFEMALE:But we're just gonna make ourselves crazy if we try to guess.
LEADMALE:Shortness of breath, dizziness, pain.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it could be something he ate.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we've considered that possibility.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Ruth Hobart.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi -Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm Elyse Keaton, - and this is Mallory and Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:My husband had the very same symptoms, and they told me it could very well be food poisoning.
SUPMALE:And? It was a heart attack.
LEADMALE: Oh, Lord.
SUPMALE:We came in from Greenville two days ago, and Tony had surgery yesterday morning.
LEADFEMALE:They said it went okay, but it was tough.
OTHERMALE:His heartbeat wasn't normal.
LEADFEMALE:He had these arrhythmias that's what they called them.
SUPMALE:Anyway, he's in the intensive care unit, and he's doing okay.
LEADMALE:Well, that's good.
SUPMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
SUPMALE:Course, he still thinks it was food poisoning.
LEADFEMALE:He says I've been trying to kill him with my meat loaf for years.
SUPMALE:I know how he feels.
LEADMALE:That's just like with Yeah, well it sounds like things are going in the right direction.
SUPFEMALE:I'd just love to take him home right now, but they say he's gonna be here for a few more days.
LEADFEMALE:I've been sleeping here and changing my clothes in the washroom.
LEADMALE:It's not the Hilton, but I'm not leaving till Tony's ready to go home.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hobart, I'm going down for a sandwich.
SUPMALE:Can I get you anything? No, thank you, Mr.
LEADMALE:Meyers.
LEADMALE:And how about you nice people? - No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:That's Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Meyers.
LEADMALE:His wife had heart surgery; it was a big success.
SUPFEMALE:She's going home soon, and I only hope he doesn't tell her that he and I slept in the same room last night.
LEADMALE:I feel sorry for these people, having to wait around the hospital day after day.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I remember the last time I sat in the hospital.
LEADMALE:Brought Alex in.
LEADMALE:He swallowed a dollar.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know what they 
LEADMALE:"You are what you eat.
SUPMALE:" I remember you said they pumped his stomach and they came up with $11.
SUPFEMALE:35.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if they had left that in there, you know how much I'd be worth right now? 
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Keaton? - Yes, Doctor? - Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's very good that you brought your husband in when you did.
SUPMALE:He had a heart attack.
LEADFEMALE:What? - Oh.
LEADFEMALE: Now, the angiogram shows there is some blockage of the left coronary artery.
OTHERFEMALE:But he's an excellent candidate for bypass surgery, and we're checking his schedule to see how soon we can fit him in.
SUPFEMALE:Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jen, one more game of Chutes and Ladders.
SUPMALE:Please? I can't, Andy, I just can't do it.
LEADFEMALE:I've been down more chutes and up more ladders than anyone my age in America.
LEADFEMALE:You can't poop out now, Jen; Mom's paying you to watch me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't you turn on the TV.
OTHERFEMALE:There's nothing on.
SUPMALE:Maybe there's a ball game.
LEADMALE:There's not.
SUPMALE:I checked.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe there's one of Dad's documentaries.
LEADMALE:There is.
LEADMALE:I checked.
SUPMALE: Ah, the sound of grown-ups.
SUPMALE:We're saved, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:Kiss me.
SUPMALE:Fat chance.
LEADFEMALE: Hi.
SUPFEMALE: Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Dad? Uh Dad's Dad's in the hospital.
SUPMALE:He's gonna he's gonna be staying there for a while.
SUPFEMALE:Did he get lost? - 
SUPFEMALE:No, honey.
SUPMALE:We don't want to scare you; we want to tell you truth, too.
SUPFEMALE:But the thing is, your-your dad had a heart attack, honey.
LEADMALE:What that means, honey, is that his heart, which-which is right here, has a boo-boo in it, and the doctor is gonna fix it, make it better.
LEADMALE:Was it a massive coronary? How do you know about that? I saw a TV show on it.
OTHERFEMALE:Could they operate? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:They do a million of those a week.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, I'm gonna go up and get some of Dad's things together.
LEADFEMALE:Come on up, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you can console me.
SUPFEMALE:This is so hard to believe this would happen to Dad.
SUPMALE:I mean, he did everything right he exercised, he ate right.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, think about what he ate.
OTHERMALE:It's quite a testimonial to sprouts.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm really scared.
SUPMALE:This is dangerous, isn't it?  Yeah, it is.
OTHERMALE:I love him so much.
SUPMALE:We all do.
LEADMALE:We've known him for quite some time.
LEADMALE:But it's such a helpless feeling though.
SUPFEMALE:How could somebody like Dad have a heart attack? Well, Grandpa Jake did have a heart condition.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:He did.
LEADMALE:That means that means I could have one.
LEADMALE:That means any of us could have one.
LEADMALE:Well, women don't get heart attacks nearly as often as men do.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hey, ain't that a kick? I mean, I mean, men, we-we work, we slave and we die.
OTHERFEMALE:And-and you women, you-you just sit back and eat bonbons and collect the insurance.
SUPFEMALE:Well, some insurance policies come with bonbons.
LEADMALE:Oh! All right, okay, you laugh, you laugh.
LEADMALE:It's true.
SUPFEMALE:Men men, we men, we're up every morning crack of dawn.
LEADFEMALE:Job to do, we get it done.
LEADMALE:Close shave, suit and tie, bag lunch and we're out the door.
OTHERFEMALE:"Bye, honey.
LEADMALE:Have a nice day.
LEADMALE:"Oh, no, sweetheart, don't worry about me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be dead soon.
LEADMALE:" We must remember these moments, Mallory.
SUPMALE:We must write them down, because no one will ever believe them.
SUPFEMALE:Where am I going?   -  - Yeah? Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, there's someone to see you.
SUPFEMALE:No more doctors.
SUPMALE: No.
LEADFEMALE:It's me, honey.
LEADMALE:Elyse.
SUPMALE: Oh, Mr Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, please.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you must get back into bed.
LEADFEMALE:He has a bit of a conduct problem.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's nothing new.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you only have a moment; we have a blood test to run.
OTHERFEMALE: More needles? Why don't you just run me through a sewing machine? Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Calm down, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Just-just let them do what they have to do; they're gonna do it anyway.
OTHERMALE:If I could just stick them with a few needles.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, maybe when you're feeling better, you can, uh, sneak up on someone.
LEADFEMALE: Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I really missed you.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone else is out in the waiting room.
LEADMALE:I was the only one they'd let in.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse I think there are a few things we need to discuss.
SUPMALE:I will never serve the buckwheat loaf again.
LEADFEMALE:The key to the safe deposit box I don't want to talk about that.
LEADMALE:I don't want to talk about it either, but this may be our last chance to talk.
LEADMALE:I'm not going in for a haircut here.
SUPMALE:Listen, don't-don't talk like that.
SUPMALE:We are not gonna need a safe deposit key for at least 50 years.
OTHERFEMALE:By which time, we'll be living off Alex anyway.
LEADFEMALE: Look, Elyse Uh I'm worried.
LEADFEMALE:Uh It's possible I  You're gonna live a long time, Steven.
SUPMALE:I want to live a long time.
LEADMALE:I want to live a long time with you.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to be old with you, I want to sit on a porch and rock with you.
OTHERFEMALE:I want that, too.
LEADMALE:And when we die I want us to die together.
LEADMALE:I want us to get real old.
LEADMALE:And then say, "One, two, three, die.
LEADMALE:" That sounds like fun.
LEADFEMALE:I want it to be that way, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:Because I cannot imagine being on this Earth without you.
SUPFEMALE:How 'bout them Browns? I'm not really that interested in sports.
LEADMALE:That so, a young fella like yourself? What are you interested in? Banking.
LEADMALE:How 'bout them interest rates? I feel they're artificially inflated at the moment.
OTHERFEMALE:Due to the rampant fluctuations in the price-earning ratios of certain blue-chip stocks in the industrial quadrant.
LEADMALE:Although, I'm sure you'll agree that the EEC's recent proclamation on the possible reactivation of the gold standard, making petrodollars a more financially lucrative option in this quarter, may help mitigate the crisis brought on by the refinancing of the deutsche mark.
LEADFEMALE:I think the Browns got a shot.
LEADFEMALE: What? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, he's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:He's fine.
LEADMALE:He He's making everyone nuts back there.
LEADFEMALE:I take that as a good sign.
OTHERMALE:Way to go, Dad.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's-that's Dad.
LEADMALE:This is some beautiful family you have, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Reminds me a lot of my own until they grew up, moved out and never call.
LEADFEMALE:Are you the Keatons? - Yes.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Peggy Vincent, - Dr.
SUPMALE:Harrison's secretary.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:And if I may, I'd like to describe - the surgical procedure to you.
OTHERMALE: Well, it's about time.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE: All right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! Grow up.
SUPFEMALE:It's just a heart.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it is.
SUPFEMALE:And this right here is the left coronary artery.
LEADMALE:That's the one that has the blockage.
LEADFEMALE:So what Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Harrison will do is open the chest cavity Uh, is that a must? Yes, it is, dear.
OTHERMALE:That's where the heart is.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the object of the surgery is to bypass this clogged coronary artery -  - With a piece of another artery.
SUPMALE:So what Dr.
SUPMALE:Harrison will do is sew  You don't look very well.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I'm fine, really.
LEADMALE:I'm just, you know, listening quietly here.
OTHERFEMALE:You have my complete undivided attention.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, the doctor is going to sew the new artery into Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton's left coronary artery to develop a flow of blood - around the blocked area, - Right.
OTHERFEMALE:And thereby bring a supply of vital nutrients to the heart.
LEADFEMALE: And that's it.
LEADMALE:Now, the surgery will take place tomorrow morning at 7:00, and the procedure normally takes about five hours.
OTHERFEMALE:So, are there any questions?  DR.
SUPFEMALE: Just breathe normally, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE: Good.
LEADFEMALE:Very good.
LEADMALE:Now, this is a team effort, Steven, and we're gonna need your help here.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You lie down, I'll do the surgery.
SUPFEMALE: I'm all scrubbed up.
OTHERFEMALE:You better let me do it.
OTHERMALE:That's a beautiful family you have out there.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to be seeing them very soon.
LEADMALE:I had a nice chat with your wife.
SUPMALE:She's a lovely woman.
SUPFEMALE:What's her first name? 
SUPMALE:Elyse.
LEADMALE:DR.
LEADFEMALE: That's a beautiful name, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Come on, Steven, tell me.
SUPMALE:There's something on your mind.
SUPMALE:Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm-hmm? I was accepted into the Peace Corps.
SUPFEMALE:Steven, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:They're sending me to Africa.
LEADFEMALE:Zambezi.
OTHERFEMALE:Your first choice! Good for you.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to come with me.
LEADFEMALE:I want to go.
LEADMALE:Well, I called and asked.
LEADMALE:They can't guarantee that we can go to the same place.
SUPFEMALE:That is, unless we're married.
SUPMALE:Now, I know how we feel about marriage.
OTHERMALE:So unnecessary when the love and the commitment is real.
SUPMALE:And we're so right.
SUPFEMALE:And that's how we feel.
LEADFEMALE:Funny, last night after you left, I was thumbing through this.
SUPMALE:Listen to this it's a quote from Euripides, who was no fool, by the way.
SUPMALE:"Never say that marriage has more joy than pain.
LEADMALE:" Is that saying it?  Says it all.
LEADMALE:It's funny, when I got home last night, I picked up some Shakespeare.
SUPFEMALE:Same subject.
LEADFEMALE:"When daisies pied, and violets blue, "And lady-smocks all silver-white, "And cuckoo-buds of a yellow hue "Do paint the meadows with delight, "The cuckoo then, on every tree, "Mocks married men, for thus sings 
LEADFEMALE:"'Cuckoo! Cuckoo, cuckoo! ' O word of fear, Unpleasing to the married ear.
OTHERMALE:" Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any idea what that means? Absolutely none.
LEADFEMALE:Will you marry me? I want nothing more.
SUPFEMALE: We got a problem here.
OTHERFEMALE:His blood pressure's falling.
LEADMALE:His heart is fibrillating.
LEADMALE:Quick, let's shock him.
LEADFEMALE: - Hurry up.
LEADMALE:We're gonna lose him.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Mom, didn't they say it was gonna take five hours? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, it's way after that now.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, they're almost an hour late.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, don't worry, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:You know, that's how it goes with this stuff, huh? You know, maybe these guys are like mechanics they're just shooting for a little overtime.
SUPFEMALE:Mal can you, uh, can you check my pulse, please? Your pulse? Yeah, you heard what the woman said.
LEADFEMALE:It's running very fast I'd just like you to check it.
LEADMALE:Okay, what do I do? Just put your finger right there and count.
OTHERMALE:Telephone, please, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Klein.
LEADFEMALE:How high? It gets into double figures.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
SUPMALE:I'll take my own pulse.
LEADMALE:I haven't got a pulse.
LEADMALE:This is unbelievable.
LEADMALE:Before I had too much; now I have none.
LEADMALE:Report to Obstetrics, please.
SUPMALE:Dr.
LEADMALE:Warner wanted in Radiology, please.
LEADMALE:Is everything okay, Ruth? H-How is Tony? He seemed fine.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, his spirits are up and he's very alert, but they decided to move him back into the I.
LEADMALE:C.
LEADFEMALE:U.
LEADMALE:Anyway.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I think that's just the way these things go.
LEADMALE:You know, two steps forward, one step back.
OTHERMALE:I'm going down for a snack.
LEADFEMALE:Would anybody like anything? I'm coming with you, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Meyers.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see you folks later.
LEADMALE:Alex? - Yeah? Yeah, what's up? It's taking so long.
LEADMALE:I'm getting really worried.
OTHERMALE:I mean, what if something happens to Dad? I love him so much, I don't think I could I could stand him being not there.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mal Dad is not gonna be not being there.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay? Me I have no pulse.
LEADMALE:I may die.
LEADFEMALE:But Dad, Dad Dad's not gonna die, okay? Dad Dad is gonna be fine, definitely.
LEADMALE:You're not worried? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mal, yeah, I'm worried.
SUPMALE:I'm very worried.
LEADMALE:I'm worried about me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mal, it's all about heredity, okay? When you consider the gene pool that we come from I got so much.
LEADFEMALE:I mean when they were handing out the genes, I must've been a special order or something.
SUPMALE:Well, let's face it, Mal, I got it all.
SUPFEMALE:Including the "raving egomaniac" gene.
SUPMALE:Yes, that.
LEADFEMALE:But I also I also got and this is what's making my pulse unfindable, Mal maybe I also got the "bum ticker" gene.
LEADFEMALE:Huh? The "bad heart" one.
LEADFEMALE:The-the-the "malo corazÃ³n" gene.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, I don't think so, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Why not? 'Cause I think you're gonna be around for a very long time so you can drive me nuts for the rest of my life.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, Mally, I hope so.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
SUPMALE:Seidelman, line one, please.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren, thanks for picking up the kids.
OTHERMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:How's Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton? We haven't heard anything for a long while.
LEADMALE:They're, they're still in surgery.
OTHERMALE:W-We'll hear something soon.
OTHERFEMALE:You okay? Alex got him going, and now he thinks he's gonna have a heart attack.
LEADMALE:I can't feel my pulse.
LEADMALE:Shake.
OTHERMALE:Come sit with your mommy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm still sane.
OTHERMALE:Is there anything I can do? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, there is.
LEADMALE:There is.
OTHERMALE:Lauren, I need psychiatric treatment.
LEADFEMALE:Hallelujah, Alex it's about time you saw the light.
OTHERFEMALE:Um Alex, here.
LEADFEMALE:Take this.
LEADMALE:Yeah, good.
LEADMALE:Make yourself comfortable - Good and let me see if I understand this.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, despite your father's condition, you seem to be more preoccupied with your own imaginary and highly neurotic worries.
LEADMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:So what do you think? Is there any hope? Alex, do you think maybe you really are very worried about your father and that you're hiding behind those feelings, unable to admit them? Me? Nah.
LEADFEMALE:Tigers eight, Padres four in this fifth game of the '84 World Series.
SUPFEMALE:The Tigers lead three games to one.
LEADFEMALE:Matter of fact, folks, it sure looks like the San Diego club will shortly be packing their bags and heading for the beach.
LEADMALE:Hey! Go to the beach! - Hey, take your water wings! - Go clamming, you bums! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Go clamming! - Nose plugs! You California sissies! You run up against some real Midwestern men, see what happens.
LEADMALE:Dad, Dad, Dad, are we not two unbelievably brilliant and clairvoyant touting maniacs? Did I not tell you Tigers in five? You did, and did I not tell you Tigers in five? You did.
LEADMALE:I did.
LEADMALE:You did.
LEADMALE:We done do'ed.
SUPMALE:Whoa! - Okay! Boy, does it get any any better than this, Alex? Ah, the women of our clan off in some distant, airtight mall.
SUPMALE:Our little baby boy fast asleep upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:And us the two Keaton hombres.
OTHERMALE:Sitting here watching the October Classic, smashing hot dogs into our faces.
OTHERFEMALE:What was the question, Dad? How about another dog-aroni? Arf, arf, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Arf, arf.
LEADMALE:I'll get 'em if you want.
LEADMALE:No, no, stay here, I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Extra mustard, extra relish? Extra everything.
LEADFEMALE:I'm celebrating.
LEADMALE:Boy, this really brings back memories.
OTHERFEMALE:Me as a kid watching the Yanks in the Series acting out every move.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey! Hodges digs in.
OTHERFEMALE:Larsen delivers.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! - And it's a long fly ball to deep left center! Mantle goes back back back breaks the lamp but makes a spectacular one-handed catch.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, will his mom be mad.
LEADMALE:I'll get the broom.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it! Got it! Good.
LEADFEMALE:Gwynn steps in.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's the pitch.
LEADFEMALE:Big, sweeping curveball, strike one! The Tigers two strikes away from the championship! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Here's the one-one pitch.
LEADFEMALE:Swing and a miss, strike two! Gwynn was way ahead of that one! We're one pitch away now! Yay! Go back to SeaWorld, Padres! Shamu's waiting for you.
SUPFEMALE:Hernandez toeing the rubber.
LEADMALE:Around comes the left arm.
SUPMALE:Here's the pitch.
LEADMALE:Gwynn lifts a high fly to left! This could be it, ladies and gentlemen! Herndon's under it and makes the catch! The Tigers win! - Yes! Yes! Tigers win! - The Tigers win the Series! Yes! Hey Dad, cheer up.
SUPFEMALE:Game's over.
LEADMALE:Your team won.
OTHERFEMALE:That was Rob on the phone.
LEADMALE:My father died.
SUPFEMALE:He, um He said he went real fast.
SUPFEMALE:It was his heart.
SUPMALE:He was gone before he got to the hospital.
LEADMALE:He was a good man, Dad.
SUPMALE:He was a very good man.
LEADMALE:And now and he led a-a full life, you know? He had two beautiful sons and a loving wife.
LEADMALE:He was a good provider.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, he worked hard, did the work of two men.
SUPFEMALE:Three men.
LEADFEMALE:And yet he was with you, you know, every step of the way, guiding you, until you were ready to go out in-into the world and-and start your own family, which you did.
LEADFEMALE:But time, as we know, marches on Alex, stop.
LEADFEMALE:And your mother, you know, I'm sure she's gonna receive a handsome insurance settlement.
LEADFEMALE:Not to mention the house, which if my sense of the Buffalo real estate market is accurate and, you know, I have no reason to believe that it's not Alex stop.
LEADFEMALE:What, what are you doing? I got to keep talking, Dad, because I'm afraid that if I stop talking, I'm gonna start I'm gonna start crying.
SUPMALE:Alex, my father died.
SUPFEMALE:Your grandfather.
LEADMALE:You can cry.
LEADFEMALE:We loved him very much.
LEADFEMALE:Uh you can grieve.
LEADFEMALE:Don't hide from your feelings, Alex.
LEADMALE:Your grandpa died.
LEADMALE:You can cry.
SUPMALE:Grandpa I'm very worried about my dad.
SUPMALE:Well, it's nice to know you're actually human, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not go jumping to conclusions, Mallory.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come on, now, let's not be picking on Alex, huh? He's made a psychological breakthrough here, and one can be quite vulnerable at such a time.
LEADMALE:Uh, am I right, Doc? Yes, you are, Nick.
LEADMALE:How did you know that? Well, I read Cosmo.
OTHERFEMALE:And one can simply see it by looking at him, that he is extremely vulnerable.
OTHERMALE:He is and he's very sweet and really adorable.
LEADMALE:I love him very much.
SUPFEMALE:Do you hear that? Yes, and I'm glad we're in a hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone, stop being mean to Alex.
SUPMALE:There'll be plenty of time for that at home.
OTHERMALE:Let's everybody just sit quietly and wait.
LEADMALE:Tony's been so happy these last few months since our youngest son Martin left home.
LEADMALE:Try to tell myself it's a coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:You know, we decided to travel all over the world.
SUPMALE:We never expected to travel to the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:But like Tony said, at least they didn't lose our luggage.
LEADFEMALE:That was Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:He, uh, sends his love, and he, uh, he's gonna try to make it over a little later.
LEADMALE:He's a sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he said he has this uncle, his Uncle Morris.
LEADMALE:The guy had a triple bypass, and he just ran a marathon.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's absolutely true.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I don't know his uncle, but you can do anything with a good bypass.
LEADFEMALE:It's no big deal these days.
LEADMALE:Now, a neighbor of mine her husband had to have a new valve put into his heart.
SUPFEMALE:Now, that was major.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I know where you're coming from.
LEADFEMALE:I had to do a valve job on my bike.
OTHERFEMALE:Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Hobart? May I talk to you, please? Is he all right? No.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ruth.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I-I-I guess this is good-bye.
SUPMALE:I-I want to th-thank y-you all I can't believe this has happened.
LEADMALE:If there's anything we can do I'll be okay.
LEADMALE:I will really.
OTHERFEMALE:And so will Steven, I know it.
OTHERMALE:Well, we we have your number.
SUPMALE:Here-here is ours, and if there's anything we can do, please call us.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Things were going so well for her husband.
OTHERMALE:You know? You-you heard her.
SUPMALE:They-they moved him into his own room.
OTHERMALE:How-how could something like this happen? Hey, Mom, you know, just take it easy, okay? I mean, I-I don't understand.
LEADMALE:One minute you're on the road to recovery, and the next minute you're dead.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, either they don't know what they're doing here, - or someone's lying! - Hey, Mom, Mom.
OTHERMALE:Hey, look, m-my husband Steven Keaton's being operated on.
LEADMALE:I-I want to know what's going on.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:You'll have to check with the duty nurse.
SUPFEMALE:I really don't know.
LEADMALE:Well, how long does an operation take?! I mean, God, it's the first one they've ever done?! - No, come on.
LEADMALE:What is going? Mom, stop it.
LEADFEMALE:Take it easy.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I-I'm just going nuts, I guess.
OTHERMALE:We all are.
OTHERMALE:Just Mom, Dad's gonna be okay.
LEADMALE:Everything's gonna be fine.
LEADFEMALE:You know when you know something with an absolute certainty sometimes? I mean, that's the feeling I get about Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's gonna be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Do you believe me? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I do.
LEADMALE:I-I do.
LEADMALE:I mean, I can I can see him in the kitchen, like, a week from now.
OTHERMALE:And he'll come down, and and he'll say, "Who didn't put the top back on the ketchup last night? Was it you, Mallory?" And I'll say, "No, it wasn't me, Dad.
LEADMALE:It was it was Jennifer, it was Alex.
SUPFEMALE:" And Alex'll say, "It was you, Mallory.
SUPMALE:You never, ever put the top on anything.
LEADFEMALE:" Dad'll say, "So it was you, Mallory.
LEADMALE:"How could you? Do you think ketchup grows on trees?" And Mallory will have to think about that.
SUPFEMALE:I-I'm thinking about it.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, uh, you see, tomatoes definitely do grow on vines.
LEADMALE:But most of the spices that we do find in ketchup do grow on trees, so I would have to say yes.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's gonna be fine, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's gonna be okay.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, you've been wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:You guys have been so supportive.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I found my pulse! Oh, great.
OTHERFEMALE:He finds his pulse.
LEADFEMALE:He's a kid.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't even need one.
SUPMALE:Alex? - It's got to be here somewhere.
LEADMALE:Oh, forget about your pulse.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's-that's a nice thing for a mother to say.
OTHERMALE:I want to talk to you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, what's up? I want to talk to you about what we're gonna do if he doesn't make it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, Mom Come on, don't talk like that, okay? I mean, he's-he's gonna make it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I-I believe that, I really do.
LEADFEMALE:But we have to think about what we're gonna do if he doesn't.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even see why we're discussing this, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Because I am the mother of this family! I have a six-year-old boy over there, and if this does happen, I will lose my mind, and I'm gonna turn to you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, guys, you want to come down to the cafeteria with us? Gonna get a milkshake.
LEADMALE:Celebrate Andy finding his pulse.
OTHERMALE:No, thank you.
OTHERMALE:You go on.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna stay up here.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Paging Dr.
SUPMALE:Robinson.
LEADFEMALE:Please call Surgery 3144.
SUPMALE:I-I, uh I-I don't think you have any concept of what your dad and I mean to each other.
LEADMALE:Um How close we are, uh how much we love each other.
LEADMALE:Mom.
SUPMALE:I don't think you can live in our house and not know that.
LEADMALE:If I lost him I don't know what I'd be like.
LEADMALE:I I don't know what I'd do.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mom.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I've depended on you for 22 years.
LEADFEMALE:And if you have to lean on me a little bit now, I'm ready.
SUPFEMALE:I love you so much.
LEADFEMALE:There's no way that I'm not gonna be there for you and I'm gonna let you go through this alone.
LEADMALE:You're my mommy.
SUPMALE:Come on, Alex.
LEADMALE:Say "Mommy.
SUPMALE:" Say "Mommy.

SUPFEMALE:Talk about solid water.
LEADMALE:There's no way my parents are getting in tonight.
LEADMALE:They're not.
LEADMALE:Your brother Rob called.
LEADMALE:Their flight was diverted to Denver.
LEADMALE:How's my dad? He's doing fine.
SUPMALE:Your brother's keeping a close eye on him.
LEADFEMALE:Evidently he won't actually admit he had a heart attack.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, he won't admit it? He had surgery.
SUPMALE:Well, he says they made a mistake.
LEADMALE:It was his appendix.
LEADFEMALE:He's a tough guy, my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, they're going to spend the night, and they'll try to get in tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:I guess this Thanksgiving is between you and me.
LEADFEMALE:Money.
LEADMALE:Oh, Steven, you're not gonna believe this.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? - Alex said "Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:" Really? Good for you, Alex.
LEADMALE:Come on, Alex, say "Mommy.
LEADMALE:" Money.
SUPMALE:That's "money," Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:He's been saying that for weeks.
LEADMALE:Are you sure? Are you sure? It sounds like "Mommy" to me.
LEADMALE:It's not.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, say "Daddy.
LEADMALE:" Money.
SUPFEMALE:This kid's gonna be rich, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:Either that, or he's going to make us very poor.
LEADFEMALE:Money.
OTHERMALE:Money, money.
LEADMALE:Money, money, money.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Ah! God, I'm a lucky guy.
SUPFEMALE:You are.
SUPMALE:I am.
SUPFEMALE:I have so much to be thankful for this year.
LEADFEMALE:My dad's alive, I have you, I have this spectacular, money-loving baby.
OTHERMALE:So thankful.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when Dad gets home, things aren't gonna be the same.
OTHERMALE:He's gonna be in a weakened state, and we're gonna have to do everything we can to try not to annoy him or upset him.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that means no loud music, Jen.
SUPMALE:Or no arguing, Mal.
LEADMALE:No Nick, Nick.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:If Nick goes, I go.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? So what? So, what's everyone talking about, huh? Well, we're talking about how things are gonna have to change when Dad gets home.
OTHERMALE:I don't think things have to change all that much.
LEADFEMALE:So I, uh, guess that means I can stay in town, huh? Well, let's see what the doctors say.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton? - Hey.
OTHERMALE:I just wanted to give you an update on the surgery.
SUPMALE:Yeah, what's going on? What's taking so long? What's happening with my dad? Well, it is taking longer than we expected.
SUPMALE:Well, why is that? Please, can you now tell us what's happening in there? Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Harrison has decided that Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton is in need of a quadruple bypass.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God.
OTHERMALE:What?! Dr.
LEADMALE:Harrison and his team are the best.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh They've run into this kind of unexpected problem before, and they know what needs to be done.
LEADFEMALE:I know how hard this is, but there's really nothing you can do now but wait.
SUPMALE:I promise I'll keep you posted.
LEADFEMALE:I - All right, Mom, sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, come on.
OTHERMALE:Come on, let's go, you guys.
OTHERFEMALE:He's gonna be fine Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Lap sponge.
LEADMALE:We have some bleeding here.
OTHERFEMALE:He's a fighter, you know that.
SUPFEMALE:His pressure is 55.
OTHERFEMALE:Clamp.
LEADMALE:What they can do now is incredible.
LEADFEMALE:I need a one-millimeter probe, please.
LEADFEMALE:Modern science is a miracle, huh? I need some traction here.
OTHERMALE:It's gonna work out, I'm telling you.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mal, you want to play catch? No, I don't really feel like it, Andy.
OTHERMALE:Ask Alex.
LEADMALE:M'kay.
LEADMALE:Alex? Alex! Ah! Geez! Alex, you want to play catch? No, but I'd like to change seats.
LEADFEMALE:Nick? - Hmm? - Nick? Nick, you want to play catch? Come on, babe, whip it in here.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, babe, whip it in here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Andy, honey, this isn't the place to play ball.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Mom.
LEADMALE:Hey, you're good.
LEADMALE:You don't drop it as much as Dad.
SUPMALE:That's true.
LEADMALE:I used to be a a pretty good ballplayer.
LEADFEMALE:For a girl.
LEADMALE:For a guy.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, all the females in this family are better athletes than the males.
LEADFEMALE:How 'bout you, Mal? Were you good, too? Well, you know, if I wanted to, I could have been a great athlete, Andy.
SUPMALE:But I just hate to sweat.
OTHERFEMALE:You know you know who's a good athlete, though, Andy? - Who? - Nick.
OTHERFEMALE:Watch this.
LEADFEMALE:Catch, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, babe, whip it in here.
LEADMALE:Oh, what am I doing? I-I forgot where I was.
SUPMALE:I'm sitting here laughing and my husband's in surgery.
LEADMALE:That's okay, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing wrong with laughing.
LEADMALE:It helps to relieve the tension.
LEADMALE:Yeah, absolutely, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Look at Shakespeare.
OTHERMALE:Any time the going got rough in one of his plays, and the-and the tension was unbearable, big Bill would bring out some comic relief.
LEADFEMALE:You know, a clown, a-a buffoon, a fool.
OTHERFEMALE:There you guys are.
LEADFEMALE:Amazing.
LEADMALE:Life imitates art.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADMALE:It-it's very sweet of you to come, Skippy.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton, I would have been here sooner.
LEADFEMALE:They gave me wrong info down at the desk.
LEADFEMALE:Instead of Steven Keaton, they sent me to a Stephanie Kelton, who was in for a liposuction.
LEADFEMALE:What? It went extremely well, she looks great.
SUPMALE:I-In fact, as soon as she gets out, I'm invited to her house for an evening of aerobic dancing.
LEADMALE:Well, sit down, make yourself comfortable.
SUPMALE:I, uh, brought some things to cheer up Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton, and I didn't know what he wanted, so I brought an assortment.
SUPMALE:Here's flowers, chocolates, archery set, uh oh, and this Slinky is for you, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:I hope you don't mind it's slightly used.
LEADFEMALE:It's my dad's.
LEADMALE:That's very sweet, Skippy.
OTHERMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton? - Huh? Yes, yes? I have some good news.
LEADMALE:The surgery is completed, and it went very well.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Doctor.
SUPMALE:If it's okay, - can-can we go see him? - No, no, no, not yet.
SUPMALE:He's in the coronary care unit.
LEADFEMALE:Everything looks good, but we have to go slowly.
SUPMALE:Now we have to wait and see how his heart adapts to the surgical procedure.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait, so-so it's not - really over yet? - No, no, not yet.
LEADMALE:The next few hours are going to be critical.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, thank you for your good work.
SUPMALE:His will to live is extraordinary.
LEADMALE:He obviously has a lot to live for.
SUPMALE:And I think I'm looking at it right now.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Yay! - Yay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh I just wish we could see him.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, just be grateful that the surgery went so well and just know that we're gonna have our daddy with us soon.
LEADMALE:I can't wait to see E.
LEADFEMALE:T.
OTHERMALE:again.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Mom? We're all set to go, she's not here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, she had a bunch of meetings.
LEADFEMALE:She's probably stuck in traffic.
SUPMALE:Well, we sure can't go without her.
LEADMALE:We sure can't.
LEADMALE:She has the car.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean it wouldn't be fun unless we all go anyway.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the whole family.
LEADMALE:Well, it's sweet to hear you say that.
LEADMALE:All right, let's do it, let's go.
SUPMALE:We can't go yet.
LEADMALE:Mom's not back.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, but why-why can't we just, you know, leave her a note and catch a cab? Fine plan.
OTHERFEMALE:Ditch Mom.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what I meant.
LEADMALE:Well, no, that is what I meant.
LEADMALE:What does E.
LEADMALE:T.
LEADFEMALE:Stand for? It means "Elyse Tardy.
SUPFEMALE:" It means "Extra Terrestrial.
SUPMALE:" What does that mean? Over to you, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:It means not of this earth.
OTHERMALE:Otherworldly.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Think Mallory.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's it, Dad.
LEADMALE:I am not going! - Oh He's been doing this to me all day.
LEADMALE:Why, Alex? Why do you persist in tormenting your sister? It's a hobby.
LEADMALE:All right, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mal, okay? I didn't mean to upset you.
OTHERFEMALE:Please forgive me.
SUPMALE:All right, I'll forgive you.
LEADMALE:I'll go.
LEADMALE:Now that was beautiful to witness.
LEADMALE:That's maturity.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Dad.
OTHERMALE:He meant me.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't mean you, he was looking right at me.
LEADMALE:You were looking at me.
SUPMALE:You meant me, right, Dad? Wait, what was that, was that a snort? - Are you snorting at me now? - I was not.
LEADFEMALE:What's happening? - Dad, you were talking to me, right? Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:I retract the statement.
LEADFEMALE:You know, we all want to go to this movie, but it's not the most important thing in the world.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, just look around.
LEADFEMALE:We're all together.
OTHERMALE:Granted, your mother is missing.
OTHERFEMALE:But all of us are here.
LEADFEMALE:And we have a beautiful home.
LEADMALE:People who truly care for each other.
LEADMALE:We're all healthy and happy Here it comes.
LEADFEMALE:When I was a boy, many, many moons ago, going to a a movie show, as we called it in those days, was a very, very rare and special event.
LEADFEMALE:Now, many nights many nights, my mom and dad and Rob and I would entertain ourselves.
LEADMALE:Do you know what we used to do? Churn butter? No, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:No, we'd sing.
LEADMALE:Do you want me to beg? Is that what? Yahoo.
LEADMALE:Yahoo.
SUPMALE:What?! How's he doing? - What happened? - I was getting a cup of coffee.
SUPMALE:Oh.

SUPMALE:Hey, absolutely not.
OTHERFEMALE:Absolutely not.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, you're the one who's exhausted.
LEADMALE:Why don't you go home, and if anything happens, we'll just we'll call you.
LEADFEMALE:Absolutely not.
SUPMALE:Sounds to me like we're all staying.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, unless we all go home, and then they could give us a call.
LEADMALE:Or-or-or-or they could go home, and we could call them.
SUPFEMALE:One way or the other, I want you to go home.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton? - Y-yes? Your husband's awake.
OTHERMALE:Can-can we all? - Yes, yeah.

LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:When are Mom and Dad coming in? Well, it's gonna take a minute or two to walk up the driveway, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:Dad's gonna be a little slower for a while.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:Now remember, when Dad walks in, we have to act really nice, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What? What? Come on, what are you talking about? Well, let's face it, Alex.
SUPMALE:You're just not nice.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but I can act nice.
SUPMALE:Did anyone notice that Dad was a little crabby on the way home? Of course he's crabby, Mallory.
SUPMALE:He's been in the hospital.
SUPMALE:That could really get to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:That and the fact that Mallory wouldn't stop jabbering - all the way home.
LEADMALE:Alex, I was try and make him feel comfortable.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you were jabbering.
OTHERFEMALE:The guy was trying to climb out the window, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:When's the last time you did No, he wasn't, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you talking to me about? Hello, Father.
SUPFEMALE:And hello to you, Daughter.

LEADFEMALE:Someone will be along shortly to take your order.
SUPFEMALE:Please stop.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine.
SUPMALE:I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I'm the same guy I was ten days ago.
LEADFEMALE:Just go do what you usually do.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go down to the bank and see how the dollar is doing against the yen.
LEADMALE:Attaboy, Andy.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope your brother and sisters will follow your example.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, everything is normal.
SUPFEMALE:But with a few little changes, we've decided that your life around here should be easier now.
LEADFEMALE:You won't have to lift a finger.
LEADMALE:You know how no one ever wants to take out the garbage? Well, Dad, I'm glad we're gonna do that for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Jen, please, let me do it.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I say again, could you all just go do what you normally do? - Okay, Dad, just don't get upset.
LEADMALE:I'm not upset.
LEADFEMALE:Well, 'cause the doctor said that - I don't want to hear the word "doctor.
LEADMALE:" Okay, the guy with the stethoscope said that you Please.
LEADFEMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:Get on with your lives.
LEADFEMALE:Grow older.
LEADMALE:Come on, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you're trying to do, but it's Okay, I'll go read.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go spend some quality time with my clothes.
SUPFEMALE:Before I go, Dad, there's just there's one little thing I want to show you, okay? Just one, all right? Dad, the incredible Stair Lift O-Matic.
LEADFEMALE:O-Okay, Dad, think about it.
LEADMALE:Sit yourself down, and you will be zooming from basement to attic in mere seconds.
LEADMALE:Alex, that is absolutely out of the question.
LEADMALE:We are not installing a chairlift in our house.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Dad, I wish you would've told me that before 'cause I got this incredible deal on the Stair Lift O-Matic Stair Buster X-90.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, it-it comes with rearview mirrors, it comes with air-conditioning and, uh, cruise control.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right, look.
OTHERFEMALE:Hol-Hold it.
SUPMALE:I know what you're trying to do here, and it's it-it's all very nice, but-but there's no need for it.
LEADMALE:Yes, I had a heart attack.
LEADMALE:Yes, I've had open heart surgery but, no, I'm not an invalid.
LEADFEMALE:All right, well do you mind if we get the Stair Buster for my own personal use? Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I just You know, I-I just I love you, - and I'm just happy that you're home.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:It-it comes in four colors.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
OTHERMALE:Are you okay? I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:You seem a little edgy with the kids.
LEADMALE:Well, excuse me, Elyse, if I'm not Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Congeniality.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a few things on my mind, okay? Well, if you've got to take it out on someone, why don't you take it out on me? I mean, they're just trying to help.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:In the hospital, all I could think about was how great it would feel to walk through that front door.
SUPMALE:Now that I'm here Why? This is where it happened.
LEADFEMALE:I fell right over here.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid every time I walk in this room, I'll think about it.
LEADMALE:I love this room.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure you're gonna love this house.
SUPMALE:It's quite a charming fixer-upper.
SUPFEMALE:It's got four bedrooms, three bathrooms and there's a separate dining room over here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven, this is beautiful.
LEADMALE:Don't you think? Well, yeah, yeah, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Yes, it is.
SUPFEMALE:But don't you think it's also maybe a bit out of our price range? Oh, we can manage it now that you got that promotion.
SUPMALE:Steven just got a job as program manager at WKS.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Public television.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, public television.
LEADMALE:How nice.
LEADFEMALE:We don't get that.
LEADMALE:Channel 3.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, I know.
SUPFEMALE:We had it, but we asked to have it removed.
SUPMALE:Alex! Mallory! Come on in and look at the house! - So, this is going to be your third child.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? - Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:Well, good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Two children is something, but three can really put you in the poorhouse.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:Uh, you're quite a saleswoman.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mom, I've been doing some research in the neighborhood checking out resale values, property taxes and my conclusion is, is this house is wildly overpriced.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, aren't you a clever little fellow? How would you like a nice stick of gum? Don't change the subject, lady.
LEADMALE:You're $7,000 over, and you know it.
SUPFEMALE:Mommy! - Mommy! Mommy! - What is it, Mallory? I love this house.
OTHERFEMALE:You can see the mall from the front porch.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can put your room out there.
LEADMALE:Please, please, kids.
LEADMALE:I think we can handle this.
SUPMALE:$7,000 over? Are you sure? Were you happy with your tax return this year? What's the closet space look like? There's one in every room.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we can add on.
LEADMALE:Add on? You think it's that easy? Have you no sense of zoning laws? Building codes? Housing agreements? Oh, yeah? Richard Nixon has the cooties.
LEADFEMALE:That's quite a comeback, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Richard Nixon has the cooties, and Tricia Nixon wears bad pantsuits.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, your brother's going through a bad time.
OTHERMALE:Watergate.
LEADMALE:Watergate.
SUPFEMALE:Nixon's going to jail.
LEADMALE:That's it! They're sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to see the kitchen? - 
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Can we just talk together for a minute? Oh, sure.
SUPMALE:Sure, take your time.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be right in here with my ear to the door.
SUPFEMALE:I'm getting real good vibes about this place, Steven.
LEADMALE:Well, so am I, but she's got a lot of other houses to show us.
LEADMALE:I don't need to see any other houses.
SUPMALE:I mean, everything we need is right here.
OTHERMALE:All we need to do is open it up a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, can't you just see it? We can open up this stairway here, put in a great big bay window right here in front and oh, we'll get this fireplace working.
OTHERFEMALE:That shouldn't be too hard.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Steven, it-it could be wonderful.
SUPMALE:What? Nothing.
LEADMALE:It's just You're very beautiful when you get all architectural like that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I can just see our family sitting in this living room.
OTHERMALE:You and I holding each other.
SUPMALE:Mallory sitting on the sofa, talking on the phone.
SUPFEMALE:Alex on the sofa digging under cushions, trying to find loose change.
LEADFEMALE:Would you guys mind taking the small bedroom? Can I borrow some turtle food? Hey, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You're not the Epsteins.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, we're the Keatons.
SUPMALE:Hi, I'm Skippy Handleman from across the street.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Well, these are our children, Alex and Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Va-va-va-voom.
LEADFEMALE:Marry me! Marry me! Well? - Let's take it.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey! What am I gonna do, Elyse? What am I gonna be like? It's gonna be fine, honey.
SUPFEMALE:How do you know that? Well, you heard what the doctor said.
LEADMALE:I don't want to hear the word "doctor.
LEADMALE:" I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You heard what the man with the stethoscope said.
OTHERFEMALE:It's gonna take some time to readjust.
LEADMALE:What am I readjusting to? What kind of a what kind of a life am I gonna be living here? Well, the-the same kind of life you led before.
LEADFEMALE:You heard what they said they said an active and full life.
LEADFEMALE:What do they know? Doctors.
SUPMALE:Don't say "doctors.
LEADMALE:" You know what really worries me? Matt Pearson.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, well, he's been on everyone's mind.
LEADMALE:Who is he? Sales rep for PBS.
SUPMALE:Big, brash, full of life kind of guy.
OTHERMALE:Huge fan of my documentaries.
SUPMALE:I think his favorite was probably The 
SUPFEMALE:From River King to Croquette.
LEADMALE:Well, he sounds like one of our kind of people.
LEADMALE:Anyway, six months ago, he doesn't show up for the annual sales meeting.
LEADMALE:And, uh, I ask about him.
LEADMALE:Turns out he's had a heart attack.
LEADMALE:He's five years younger than me, Elyse.
SUPMALE:I saw him recently.
LEADMALE:Completely different guy.
SUPMALE:He looked terrible.
LEADMALE:Thin, tired, skittish.
LEADMALE:Scared of living.
LEADMALE:Told me his doctor said he was as good as new.
LEADMALE:He could do anything.
LEADFEMALE:But he's afraid.
LEADFEMALE:Afraid he's gonna get another heart attack.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you afraid? I am.
SUPFEMALE:Afraid of becoming another Matt Pearson; a living, passionless ghost.
LEADFEMALE:I need passion in my life, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Passion for the kids, passion for my work passion for you.
SUPMALE:Honey it's all still there.
LEADFEMALE:It's just gonna take some time.
OTHERMALE:I'm just thrilled with every minute I have with you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:On second thought, I don't think we're gonna have to worry about that passion coming back.
SUPFEMALE:Va-va-va-voom.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Dad, let me carry those.
SUPMALE:Alex, don't be ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Steven, you're not supposed to carry heavy things.
LEADMALE:You just had a heart attack.
SUPMALE:Elyse, please.
LEADMALE:Everyone, do me a favor.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to hear the words "heart attack.
LEADMALE:" Well, Mom's right, Dad.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you shouldn't overexert yourself since, you know, you had the H-thingy.
OTHERMALE:Look, I had a H-thingy.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm doing fine now.
LEADFEMALE:It's not as if going to, um D-thingy.
SUPMALE:Steven, I think you're slowly losing your M-thingy.
OTHERFEMALE:What's for dessert, Mom? - Oh, I made some chocolate pudding.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, I love chocolate pudding.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, that's not for you.
LEADFEMALE:This is your dessert.
SUPMALE:Seaweed-bran pudding.
SUPMALE:Elyse, this was my main course.
LEADFEMALE:Not with plankton whip.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm-mmm.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for the ride, Skippy.
SUPMALE:Hi, Skipper.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Skippy, would you like to join us for some dessert? Uh, no thanks, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:I think I'm just gonna go back to my house, go up to my room, and carry on with my pointless and totally lackluster life.
LEADMALE:Say hello to your parents.
LEADMALE:Skippy, is something wrong? It's not something, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, it's just everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Today was Career Day at Grant.
SUPMALE:We got the results of our job aptitude tests.
LEADMALE:How'd you do, Mal? Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:They said I'm good at shopping, exchanging and gift wrapping.
SUPMALE:Well, let's just hope you use your power for good instead of evil.
SUPMALE:How'd you do, Skip? Oh, not bad, not bad.
SUPFEMALE:I did, uh, fine.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, what are you good at? "Converting oxygen into carbon dioxide.
LEADMALE:" There's a real future in that, Skip.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, let's face it, I've hit my peak.
LEADFEMALE:It's all downhill from here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Skip, come on.
SUPMALE:It'll work out.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come out with me for dessert? No thanks, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:K.
SUPMALE:Are you sure? I'm going to Baskin-Robbins.
LEADMALE:Steven, don't you dare.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just going to fondle some sherbet.
SUPMALE:Cheer up, Skippy, look, you brought home all those career brochures.
LEADMALE:I'm sure there's something in there for you.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:Um, "Join the circus.
LEADMALE:Become a human cannonball.
LEADMALE:" Gee, Skip, it says you'd be good at that.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, it's hopeless.
OTHERMALE:I'll never have a career.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I should just go into business with my father.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what is he doing these days? He's retired.
LEADMALE:Come on, Skippy, look at all these career opportunities.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, computer technician.
LEADMALE:Dental assistant.
SUPMALE:Bookkeeping.
LEADFEMALE:Chimney sweep.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look at this 
LEADFEMALE:The Army.
SUPFEMALE:Don't run away from chimney sweep.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at this it says you can travel all over the world, meet new and interesting people, work with state-of-the-art technology.
SUPMALE:Oh, and you got to love those hats.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow.
OTHERFEMALE:No, come on, Skip, you're really not the Army type.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? It's in my blood.
LEADFEMALE:One of my relatives was a famous Revolutionary War hero.
LEADFEMALE:Lieutenant Zachariah Handleman.
LEADMALE:He was the first American soldier to be captured by his own troops.
LEADMALE:Skip, be serious here, you know.
OTHERMALE:It's a very big step you're talking about.
OTHERMALE:I want to do this.
SUPMALE:H-How do you join the Army? I don't know, I mean, I guess you-you go down to a recruiting office, you tell them you want to join, uh, fill out some forms, uh, take a medical exam you know, turn your head, cough and you're in.
SUPFEMALE:I can do that.
LEADFEMALE:And I am going to.
LEADMALE:This is the dawn of a new, tough, courageous, independent Skippy Handleman.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, will you come with me? - You okay? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Good afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Sergeant Davis.
LEADFEMALE:Can I help you gentlemen? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Sergeant Davis.
SUPMALE:I'm Alex P.
OTHERMALE:Keaton, and, uh, this is Irwin Handleman.
LEADFEMALE:Irwin would like to join the Army.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's good, Irwin.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, what makes you interested in the Army? I want to be a man, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we can't promise anything, Irwin.
OTHERMALE:But we'll do our best.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, and what about you, Alex? Why do you want to join the Army? Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I'm, uh, I'm really I'm not the military type, uh, Sergeant.
LEADMALE:I'm, uh, I'm a business major.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, then perhaps you'll want to join our new elite fighting force, the Airborne Accounting Corps.
SUPFEMALE:The soldiers of fiscal warfare.
LEADMALE:See, we drop these troops behind hostile territory, and they screw up the enemy's books.
OTHERMALE:Uh, well, actually, sir, I'm-I'm from a family of, uh, fiscal pacifists.
LEADMALE:We're Quakers.
SUPMALE:Well, that's too bad.
SUPMALE:Uh, why don't you guys have a seat.
SUPMALE:Irwin, let me ask you a few questions about yourself.
LEADMALE:Okay, shoot.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, not really.
SUPFEMALE:Age? - 20.
OTHERMALE:Previous military service? Cub Scouts.
LEADMALE:Then the Army's gonna be a day at the beach for you.
LEADFEMALE:Any law violations? Well, some people say I violate the laws of natural selection.
LEADFEMALE:Education? Two years of college.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's great.
SUPFEMALE:Where? Grant College.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Well, uh, you know, Sergeant Davis, Grant College well, being an institute of-of lower learning, has produced some fine military prospects.
SUPMALE:Uh, in fact, may I remind you, sir, that, uh, Grant College is named for Ulysses S.
SUPMALE:Grant.
LEADFEMALE:Or possibly Lou Grant.
LEADMALE:Both-both fine fighting men in their own right.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Alex, you might be an excellent candidate for our Airborne Verbal Assault Team.
LEADFEMALE:You flatter me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Irwin, militarily speaking, is there a specific area that particularly interests you? Well, I-I've always seen myself driving a tank.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I feel pretty well-prepared, because my father has a Buick.
LEADFEMALE:Tanks it is.
OTHERMALE:That's it? I'm in? Well, there are a few formalities that have to be completed, but my general sense of it, Irwin, is that you're good Army material.
LEADMALE:All right! Hey, hey, Skip, Skip, look, you're moving really fast here.
LEADFEMALE:Now, are you serious about this? Oh, yes, I feel really good about this.
LEADFEMALE:This is, this is right for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, then, you'll be looking at eight weeks of basic training at Fort Wharton.
LEADMALE:Uh, where is that? - Just outside Dayton.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, right on the front lines.
LEADMALE:And I'll be seeing you down there, Irwin.
SUPMALE:I'm transferring down to Fort Wharton.
SUPMALE:I'll be your drill instructor.
LEADMALE:He'll warm up to you, Sarge.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't mind if I do.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Oh, I think I'd like Dad! These chips are not for you.
LEADFEMALE:They've not been approved by the American Heart Association.
SUPMALE:What am I supposed to eat? Oh, Steven, do you think we're insensitive to that? Came up with the perfect Cardiac chips.
OTHERFEMALE:And these are homemade, and there's nothing bad in them.
LEADMALE:No salt, no fat, no preservatives.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, great, what's the recipe? Thinly slice a raw potato and serve.
OTHERMALE:Oh, here, let me Now, that must be the Handlemans.
LEADFEMALE:Look, they're a little upset about Skippy going, so try to be supportive and show them a good time.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Private Handleman reporting for party, sir.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:At ease, Handleman, at ease.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Harry, good to see you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Harry.
OTHERFEMALE:We'd really like to thank you for throwing this little shindig for Irwin.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sure he'd throw one for us if we were going in the Army.
LEADFEMALE:We're so proud of him.
SUPMALE:He's going to be such a wonderful soldier.
LEADMALE:He's going to look so handsome In his uniform.
OTHERMALE:Oh, don't worry, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call you every day, twice a day.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, uh, once a day is fine.
LEADMALE:Every other day is fine.
OTHERMALE:Well, come on, everybody.
SUPMALE:Help yourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Here, have-have something to eat.
SUPMALE:What's he going to eat in the Army? They don't know how to cook for him.
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't eat everything, you know.
SUPMALE:It's not going to be like the good, nourishing food he's been eating at our house and yours all these years.
LEADMALE:These are raw.
LEADFEMALE:So, Skippy, when are you shipping out? Really soon.
LEADMALE:Uh, in fact, Sergeant Davis is coming here to pick me up so we can be at Fort Wharton by 0600 hours.
LEADMALE:Which for you civilians is 600 hours after oh.
OTHERMALE:I spoke to Sergeant Davis on the phone.
LEADFEMALE:He sounds like a very nice man.
LEADFEMALE:I told him about all of Irwin's special, sweet little quirks.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't have to do that.
LEADFEMALE:You can't watch over me every minute.
SUPMALE:I've got to grow up sometime.
LEADMALE:Now, he's right, Rose.
LEADMALE:He's a big boy now.
OTHERMALE:He's not the same little Skippy that used to walk around chewing an old blue blanket.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, did you pack it, Mom? It's in there right next to your asthma inhaler and your nightlight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, I don't mean to get emotional, but how would you all feel if you were losing Alex? I know how I'd feel.
LEADFEMALE:And we certainly would be having a party.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, um, Sergeant Davis, I presume.
OTHERFEMALE:That's correct.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Steven Keaton.
LEADMALE:How are you? heart attack.
SUPMALE:That's good to know.
SUPMALE:Please, uh, come in.
LEADMALE:Sergeant Davis, everyone.
OTHERFEMALE:Sergeant Davis, sir.
LEADMALE:You don't have to salute me, Irwin.
LEADFEMALE:This is sweet, but if you do this at the base, no one's gonna want to share a foxhole with you.
SUPMALE:Sergeant Davis, I'm Rose Handleman.
SUPFEMALE:We spoke on the phone.
LEADMALE:I haven't forgotten.
SUPMALE:Uh, your son can't digest milk products.
SUPMALE:And don't forget, at night He kicks off the covers and needs to be tucked in.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I'm off to war.
OTHERFEMALE:What about you, Alex? It's not too late.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, no, Sergeant, really, please.
LEADMALE:I, um actually, I inherited my dad's trick knee.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about, Alex? - You don't have a trick knee.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, listen whoa! My foot just went flat.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.

OTHERFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never forget you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm gonna miss you so much! You've meant the world to me.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, you'll wait for me, won't you? We'd better go now.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody better hurry up; inspection's in five.
LEADFEMALE:Irwin, come on, get up.
LEADFEMALE:One more minute, Mommy.
LEADMALE:I'm not your mommy.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a gun.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Hi, Holworthy.
LEADMALE:Hi, shnookums.
OTHERFEMALE:Now get up; it's inspection.
LEADMALE:And you've already failed twice.
LEADMALE:This time, I'm prepared.
LEADMALE:You better pull yourself together, or you're gonna lose your weekend pass.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Handleman, what are you doing with your weekend pass? Oh, I-I thought I'd just hang around here and brush up on the Geneva Convention.
SUPFEMALE:Did you guys hear what Handleman is doing with his weekend pass? Brushing up on the Geneva Convention.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is the Geneva Convention? Well, maybe you should hang out with me here and brush up on it.
SUPMALE:You talking to me, Handleman? Holworthy, back off.
LEADMALE:You're not scaring me.
LEADFEMALE:All right, maybe you are scaring me.
LEADFEMALE:May I remind you gentlemen that I know Sergeant Davis personally? We've hugged.
OTHERFEMALE:Ten-hut! Ready for inspection? Yes, Drill Sergeant! Actually, I could use a few more minutes.
LEADMALE:I don't hear you, Handleman! That could possibly be wax buildup, Sergeant Davis.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot believe that I'm the one who recruited you, Handleman! I cannot believe that you have not tucked me in once! Put a lid on it, soldier! All right, soldiers, stand at ease.
SUPMALE:Get to your bunks.
LEADMALE:Good job, Curtis.
SUPFEMALE:Well done, Matthews.
SUPMALE:Good job, Strauss.
LEADFEMALE:Well done, Holworthy.
OTHERMALE:Are you looking for something specific, Sarge? Yes! I'm looking for the signs of a solider! And I don't see one here! Um Sergeant Davis, can I talk to you for a minute? What happened to us? We used to be so close.
LEADMALE:Don't you remember, back at the recruiting office? Well, we'll always have Columbus, Handleman.
OTHERFEMALE:But right now when one of you screws up, you let the whole platoon down! When one of you fails, you all fail! Weekend passes revoked, compliments of Private Irwin Handleman.
OTHERMALE:Um No, uh, Sergeant, you Guys, I've got some extra Fig Newtons.
LEADFEMALE:Who am I kidding? Celery dog, Elyse? Steven, tonight you're gonna get lucky.
OTHERMALE:I don't care about that, Elyse, I want some food.
OTHERMALE:That's what I was talking about, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:See, you've been so pathetic all week, having to eat all this low-cholesterol food, so I called Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Harrison, and he said that occasionally you could have a small treat.
LEADMALE:Don't tease me, Elyse.
OTHERFEMALE:Feast your eyes on this.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, Elyse, thank you.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:You can't have it all.
LEADFEMALE:You can just have this much.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you gonna finish it? I'd like to save the rest for tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look at this.
SUPMALE:We got a postcard from Skippy.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what's it say? Uh I don't know, it's in Spanish.
SUPFEMALE:"Mis amigos Keatons.
LEADFEMALE:Todo esta muy bueno aqui en Akron.
OTHERFEMALE:" It was something about Akron.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know, Jennifer? Did you take Spanish? You know he's only been gone a couple of weeks, but I-I really miss our little Skippito.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this, Dad, but I have to agree with you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, remember all the silly things he used to do? Like when he'd come over to see us, instead of knocking on the door, he'd squish his face up against the glass and Skippy? Skippy, what are you doing here? I didn't think they'd give you time off.
LEADFEMALE:Do the letters "A-W-O-L" mean anything to you? You went AWOL? That's right, I did it.
OTHERMALE:I went AWOL.
LEADFEMALE:What is AWOL? It means "Absent Without Leave.
LEADMALE:" Really? I-I thought it literally meant "a wall.
LEADMALE:" As in going over a wall, which is what I did.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, what are you talking about? Listen, I thought you said everything was going fine there.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't.
LEADMALE:It was a complete disaster.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody liked me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Skippy, you should be used to that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's Sergeant Davis.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's Sergeant - What am I gonna do? - Well, Skippy, I No, I Well, Sergeant Davis.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:If you're here to measure me for a uniform, about-face.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'm here looking for Private Irwin Handleman.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Pri do you hear that, Steven? He's look He's looking for Private Irwin Handle You want a, want a celery dog, sir?! I'm here, Sergeant Davis.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton, but this is my problem, and I've got to deal with it.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, folks, but would you mind if I speak to the private privately? Handleman, you have committed a very serious offense.
LEADFEMALE:Now, going AWOL is one of Army's least favorite things.
SUPMALE:What's going to happen to me now, Sergeant? We could throw you in the stockade.
LEADFEMALE:Or we could put you on a rock pile.
SUPMALE:Or we could do what we're gonna do.
LEADMALE:Let you out.
OTHERFEMALE:You can do that? It's called a trainee discharge for unadaptability.
SUPMALE:This won't be the first one of these I've gotten.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Irwin part of growing up is finding out where you fit in.
LEADMALE:And where you don't fit in.
LEADMALE:And we both know you don't fit into the Army.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't feel good about this.
LEADMALE:I don't want to feel like I'm quitting.
OTHERMALE:You're not.
LEADMALE:You're fired.
LEADMALE:Well, great.
SUPMALE:So I'm back to where I started.
LEADFEMALE:Back to square one.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just no good at anything.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, listen to me, Irwin.
LEADFEMALE:Took a lot of courage for you to join the Army.
LEADFEMALE:And that's the same kind of courage that's gonna get you to where you should rightfully be.
LEADMALE:You're going to become a man, Irwin.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Sergeant Davis.
SUPMALE:Alex! I want you.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, actually, Sergeant Davis, I've been thinking about that Airborne Accounting Corps, and oh! Darn, the old trick knee.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's I'll be back for you, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Irwin.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
SUPMALE:What you doing? Oh, I'm working, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:Making notes on my new documentary.
LEADFEMALE:The Industrialization of 
SUPFEMALE:From Nacho Chip to Microchip.
LEADMALE:I wrote that line.
LEADMALE:It's a killer, Dad.
LEADMALE:Well, this  Oh, Steven, are you working again, on a Saturday? Honey, I'm just doing a little extra PBS work.
LEADMALE:You shouldn't be working on a weekend.
LEADMALE:Yeah, even during the week it's debatable.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, you know the doctor said that since your heart attack, you should de-stress your life and try to relax.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you need a hobby.
LEADMALE:I hate hobbies.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Hobbies are terrific, huh? I got a million of 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you find time to fit them into your busy schedule? Okay, I'll be in the kitchen, so please let me know when my friend gets here.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:What friend is this? Oh, just someone I know from school.
LEADFEMALE:He I mean, he-slash-she is gonna help me bake some stuff for my French Club bake sale.
LEADMALE:Wait, he "he-slash-she"? Yes.
SUPMALE:This person is a friend, and I don't see how gender enters into it.
SUPFEMALE:Mal, how do I look? Is this a good color for me? Yes, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna knock his-slash-her eyes out.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, is this one of them half-men, half-women guys you see Jennifer, is this, uh is this friend a boyfriend? Well, maybe.
LEADMALE:I don't want to discuss my personal life, though.
LEADFEMALE:He is so sweet, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:He's shy, he walks me to all my classes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really not sure if he likes me, but he's been hanging around my locker a lot this past week.
SUPMALE:Well, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:When he's, uh, talking to you, does he lean against the locker with one hand? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jennifer, then you're practically engaged! I'm so happy for you!  Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, he's shy, he walks, he can lean on one hand.
LEADMALE:That's one way to choose a mate.
LEADMALE:It's better than you did.
LEADFEMALE:Better than you did, too.
OTHERFEMALE:You might know who he is.
OTHERFEMALE:His name is Josh Wakefield.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, Josh Wake Josh Wakefield? Jeff Wakefield's little brother? Or little brother-slash-sister? Great.
SUPMALE:Jeff Wakefield.
OTHERMALE:Who is Jeff Wakefield? Well, it's a boy that, uh, Mallory used to go out with when she was in high school.
LEADMALE:Nick, he's the guy who broke my heart.
LEADFEMALE:He went away to college and asked me to go steady.
LEADFEMALE:Then when I went to visit him, I walked into his dorm and found him kissing another girl.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I was devastated.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I was a complete mess until I met you.
LEADMALE:You're wonderful, Nick.
LEADMALE:But Jeff Wakefield's a complete jerk.
LEADMALE:He's also a good friend of mine.
LEADMALE:Well, they're not mutually exclusive.
SUPFEMALE:I'm beginning to like this Jeff guy.
SUPMALE:What? Oh, you see, if he'd never broke up with you, you and I never would've gotten together.
LEADMALE: Damn that Jeff.
OTHERMALE:Oh, honey, he-he was a nice, shy boy.
LEADMALE:Remember, he'd come to the house, he couldn't even bring himself - to knock on the door? -  Mom, that's not because he was shy.
LEADFEMALE:He was standing out there thinking of ways to dump me.
LEADFEMALE:No, I-I thought he was nice.
LEADMALE:He'd come in and call you "pal.
LEADFEMALE:" Remember that goofy, high-pitched laugh he had whenever he got nervous? The deranged little cackle?  He sounded like Flipper.
LEADMALE:Boy, it's getting late.
LEADMALE:I hope Josh didn't get lost.
OTHERMALE:Josh! Hi.
SUPMALE:Come on in.
SUPMALE:Hey, pal.
SUPMALE:Josh, these are my parents.
LEADFEMALE:All of them?   He doesn't sound like Flipper.
LEADMALE:He sounds like Shamu.
SUPMALE:Well, Josh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:We better get baking.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Jeff? Okay, this last batch should be done pretty soon.
LEADFEMALE:Now all we have to do is glaze the cinnamon rolls.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jennifer, you got a little flour on your nose.
OTHERMALE:Oh, gosh.
LEADFEMALE:Is it gone? No, it's on the side Here, let me, uh Oh.
LEADMALE: Smudged it, uh - Here.
LEADMALE:Ow! Oh, God! I'm such a jerk, I I poked you in the eye, I Yes, you did, but it was the nicest poke in the eye I've ever received.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, can I talk to you about something? I think you went a little overboard powdering your nose.
SUPFEMALE:You don't think it's a good look for me? Oh, God, no.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna freshen up.
LEADFEMALE:Can you stir that for me until I get back? Oh, hey, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Spoke to my brother Jeff the other day.
LEADFEMALE:He said to say hi.
LEADMALE: As if I care.
SUPMALE:Huh? Uh I said, "Oh, have you been to the World's Fair?" Gee, Mal, I could've sworn you said, "As if I" Ow! So, how is Jeff doing? Well, let's see, uh After Jeff graduated summa cum laude in French from Princeton, he landed a job over in Paris.
LEADMALE:Vice president of a big French manufacturing company.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess Jeff's so busy, he doesn't have time for a social life.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he doesn't really go out much.
LEADMALE:Not since he got married.
LEADFEMALE:And Gigi kind of likes to relax when she gets home.
LEADMALE:You know, she says it's really tiring being an astrophysicist.
LEADMALE:Oh, she says that, huh? In French.
LEADMALE:She sounds charming.
LEADFEMALE:Charmant.
LEADMALE:I always knew Jeff would wind up with a bookish little girl.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually, uh, Gigi's quite tall.
SUPFEMALE:She-she used to be a model.
LEADFEMALE: Well, she couldn't make it as a model, she had to go and become an astrophysicist.
SUPMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:So, how about you, Josh? How you doing? Well, uh, I got into Princeton.
LEADMALE:Early admission, just like Jeff.
LEADMALE:And I'm gonna major in French, too.
LEADMALE:Like Jeff.
SUPMALE: Just like Jeff, huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I plan to follow in his footsteps.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff's kind of my my hero.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'm back.
LEADMALE:How do I look? - Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:How's that glaze coming? Great.
LEADMALE:Well, it looks like it's done.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Josh, we better get to the bake sale.
LEADMALE:Oh, we got to hurry, because I told Rebecca Philips I was gonna give her a ride, too.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay, great.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:See you guys later.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think of that, Alex? He's taking Rebecca Philips to the bake sale, too.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:We better call the bakery cops and bust his crullers.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Dad.
SUPMALE:Okay, Steven, you can start relaxing right now, because we have the hobby of your dreams.
SUPFEMALE:You remember your favorite childhood toy? We got it for you.
LEADFEMALE:Train set.
LEADMALE:Oh, Elyse, a train set.
OTHERMALE:That's a great idea! Boy, I used to love those freight trains.
SUPMALE:Climbing rugged mountains, crossing raging rivers, all of them pulled by that mighty locomotive.
LEADMALE:Doesn't look very mighty, does it? Yeah, all right, it's mighty tiny.
OTHERFEMALE:But it comes with great accessories for the village, Dad.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:A miniature Young Republicans headquarters with cute little miniature Young Republicans running hither and thither.
LEADFEMALE:They're not hithering and thithering in my village.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Dad.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Look-look at the box.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:Where's Jennifer? Uh, still at the bake sale with Josh.
SUPMALE:Still? Oh, Mom, when I have kids, the rule is gonna be three, at the most four, hours at a bake sale.
OTHERFEMALE:Anything over that, they're grounded.
LEADMALE:What has gotten into you? Oh, I don't know, Mom.
LEADMALE:Look, the truth is, I don't trust Josh.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you say that? Mom, I care about Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Josh worships Jeff.
SUPFEMALE:Josh is gonna do everything Jeff did.
LEADFEMALE:And in my judgment, Josh will jilt Jennifer just as Jeff jilted me.
LEADFEMALE:Gee judging by Jeff, Jen and Josh are really jinxed.
OTHERMALE:Jell-O? No, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, history doesn't really have to repeat itself.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Josh and Jen are unique individuals in a unique relationship, which, as far as I can tell, revolves solely around baked goods.
SUPMALE: Elyse, Alex isn't playing trains fair.
LEADMALE:Do I have to separate you two again? Mallory? Huh? Guess what happened.
SUPMALE:Josh asked me to the senior prom.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't that incredibly romantic? I don't know, Jen.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? This morning, you were so happy for me.
LEADFEMALE:That was before I knew who he was.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, I have to tell 
LEADFEMALE:I don't like Josh.
SUPMALE:How can you say that? You don't even know him.
LEADMALE:I know his type.
SUPMALE:Oh, I get it.
SUPMALE:You just don't like him because he's Jeff's brother.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:See, Jeff led me on and dumped me, and Josh is gonna do the same thing to you.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you, Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:Why-why are you trying to ruin this for me? Jennifer, I'm telling you this for your own good.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm your big sister; I think you ought to listen to me.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I thought you were more than my big sister, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:I really thought you were my friend.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, excuse me.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, hey-hey-hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Girls, how we doing, huh? Jennifer, I'm only trying to look out for you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe I don't want you to look out for me.
OTHERMALE:Who wants ice cream? Jennifer, I think I know a little bit more about the world than you do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the world of culottes, maybe.
LEADFEMALE:Frozen yogurt, Tofutti? I'm flexible here, huh? I can't believe you made a crack like that, Jennifer! Mallory, just because Jeff dumped you Whoa, whoa, whoa, girls, girls, girls, girls! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Jennifer, he is going What the hell is going on here? Mallory doesn't like Josh, and she's not even giving him a chance.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, I don't think you're thinking clearly.
LEADMALE:Mallory, I can't believe that you would make that statement.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Jeff did it, Josh - Josh worships Jeff.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, girls, girls! Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Mallory, Jennifer you're my sisters.
LEADMALE:I love you both very much.
OTHERMALE:And it pains my heart to see you fight.
LEADFEMALE:And snap at each other.
LEADMALE:So, please do it another room, all right? Thanks, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, all right, I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:I'll mediate your dispute.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God.
LEADMALE:Please, don't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, it will be just like when you were little and you'd have arguments and I'd settle them fair and square.
LEADMALE:No, you wouldn't; you always sided with Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE: - Well, I won't this time, okay? Listen, I'll listen to each of your complaints, I'll think about it, and I'll come up with a solution that will satisfy both of you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Now, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I think if I want to go out with Josh, it is my business, and Mallory should butt out.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:I just think Jennifer should go a little slow with Josh.
SUPMALE: Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Slow with him.
LEADFEMALE:Butt out.
LEADFEMALE:Mm uh Jennifer's right.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's not fair! Yes, it is, Mallory! Mallory, if you would take the time to get to know Josh, you wouldn't be saying these things about him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey, that gives me an idea, huh? Why don't you and me and Josh and Jennifer all go out for dinner, huh? That way, you can get to know him.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a great idea, Nick.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you say, Mal? What if after we go out I still don't like him? Well, I don't know, you know, I only get one idea at a time.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, Josh, you're fluent in French, huh? Say something.
SUPMALE:Nick, you're kind of putting him on the spot.
OTHERMALE:Aw, come on, just tell me a word, you know? Like, for instance, what's the French word for, uh, I don't know, say, um croissant? Croissant.
LEADFEMALE: Oh! Hey, so French and English are the same, huh? Basically.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, what else is going on with your life, huh? Well, we've talked enough about me.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, you haven't said much.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm just listening.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Josh got accepted early admission to Princeton.
SUPMALE:Well, hey, early admissions to Princeton, huh, Josh? You must be pretty excited or as they say in French, "Pretty excited.
SUPFEMALE:" Yeah, my brother Jeff went there, loved it.
SUPFEMALE:Says you can meet all sorts of interesting people.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Yeah, college can open up a lot of doors.
LEADMALE:Both academically and socially.
SUPFEMALE:Do tell.
SUPMALE:Maybe we ought to talk about what Nick's doing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what am I doing? Or as the French say, "What am I doing?" Shush up, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Um, Josh, which door do you think you'd be more interested in, the social one or the academic one? Ah, I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:Jeff says studying's pretty important, but, uh, I mean, you need a good social life, too, right? Well, he certainly had one.
LEADMALE:So, uh, you two is going to the prom, huh? That's great.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it, Nick? Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, I never went to a prom.
LEADFEMALE:How come? Oh, I was never in school when the year ended, so Um, Josh getting back to your social life what exactly do you think you'll be doing? Well, I I guess in the fall, I'd go to football games.
OTHERFEMALE:Alone, or with someone? Mallory, what does that matter? Oh, hush.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just curious.
LEADMALE:Josh?  Well, with someone, I guess.
LEADMALE:Hoping to make friends pretty fast.
SUPMALE:What kind of friends? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What kind are there? Well, there are the kind you hang out with, and there are the kind you kiss on the lips.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory! - Jennifer! Who here can roll their tongue? Listen, Josh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I just think Jennifer has a right to know where this relationship is going.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, stop it! Just leave him alone.
LEADFEMALE:Look I don't know what's going on here, but I really don't think this evening was a good idea.
LEADMALE:I better go.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, Josh, wait.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I am sorry, I got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer - Well, so long.
LEADFEMALE:Or as they say in French Oh, Nick! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right? Yes.
LEADMALE: 
LEADMALE:Okay, we did it.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay, what's, uh, what's next? Uh glue, glue, glue, glue.
LEADFEMALE:One drop in each of its slots.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, yes, each of the slots.
SUPMALE:All right? - Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Here we go.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do it, Alex.
OTHERMALE:I haven't got the hands anymore.
SUPFEMALE:I  -You can do it, Dad, you can do it.
LEADFEMALE:You're a champ.
SUPMALE:You're a winner.
LEADMALE:Okay, you're right.
LEADMALE:You're a model-building machine.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! - Okay, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Go for it, Dad.
SUPMALE:Tab 82 in slot A.
SUPMALE:It's done.
SUPMALE:It's All right, okay, okay, take a break, take a break.
OTHERMALE: Dad, little bit more?  Okay.
SUPMALE:Tab 83.
SUPFEMALE:It's done.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! One more! - Yes! - One more, Dad.
LEADMALE:One more.
OTHERMALE:God, thank you, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:One more.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, buddy.
LEADMALE:Come on, buddy.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Come on, buddy.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Done! We did it! - Oh! - We did it.
SUPMALE:We did it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex, I love it.
OTHERFEMALE:We've done it.
SUPMALE:We've done it.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:We built our very own Republican Savings and Loan.
LEADMALE:Alex, this is an authentic replica of a Wild West saloon.
SUPMALE:No, it's not, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Dad, look, look, look.
SUPFEMALE:If it's a Wild West saloon, what are all those cute little bankers doing in there? Those aren't bankers.
LEADMALE:Those are drunken cowboys.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
OTHERMALE:They're bankers.
LEADFEMALE:Look, look.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, no, don't tell me.
SUPMALE:Dad, n-no, I just - No.
LEADFEMALE:Al - Oh, oh! - Oh, oh, oh! Now look what you've done.
SUPMALE:How's your hobby coming, honey? Oh, it's tremendously relaxing, Elyse! The trains are so small, you can barely see them.
SUPFEMALE:Alex has turned the village into a bastion of Republican banking.
LEADMALE:You can hardly put-put the buildings together, and when you can, you you glue yourself to them.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to make a presentation at work tomorrow, and now I have to explain why I've got a saloon stuck to my hand.
LEADMALE:It's a Republican Savings and Loan, Dad! 
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE: -Hi.
SUPMALE:Where's Jennifer? Oh, she ran out of the restaurant after Josh.
LEADMALE:Oh, dear.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry to hear that.
SUPMALE:Why? Oh, I started asking him all these questions, Mom, to find out if he was really like Jeff, and I went a little too far.
OTHERMALE:I alienated Josh, I mortified Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I made a complete fool out of myself.
LEADMALE:Nick have a good time? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:He learned French.
LEADMALE:Honey, look, even if Jen is making a mistake, there is nothing you can do about it.
LEADFEMALE:It-lt's the only way she's gonna grow up.
SUPFEMALE:In other words, butt out.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be upstairs.
LEADMALE:How did things go with Josh? Fine, fine.
SUPMALE:He's a really sweet guy, so he didn't hold anything against me.
LEADMALE:You're another matter, however.
LEADFEMALE:He must hate me.
SUPFEMALE:No, I talked him down.
SUPFEMALE:I told him that you're getting over a vicious bout of scurvy.
SUPFEMALE:Then you must hate me.
LEADMALE:It's tempting.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm really, really sorry.
OTHERMALE:Mallory, you had no right to do what you did.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm old enough to handle these things by myself.
OTHERMALE:I-I know that in my head, but in my heart, you're still my little baby sister.
SUPFEMALE:You know, before you were born, I used to dream about what it would be like to have a little sister.
SUPFEMALE:And then, when you came along, I was so happy.
SUPFEMALE:Glad I could help.
LEADFEMALE:I used to sneak into your nursery and-and sit there and-and look at you through the bars of the crib, and I'd talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember what I said? Not offhand.
LEADMALE:I promised that I would be the best big sister in the world, and that I would protect you and care for you and teach you.
SUPFEMALE:You've done that; you've always been there for me when I needed you.
SUPMALE: Oh, sure, when you were a toddler, I'd tell you how to sit up, patty cake and catalog shop.
LEADFEMALE:But then, when you got older, you went in a different direction.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, books and school and intellectual discussions things I don't know anything bout.
LEADFEMALE:And I realized that you're not like me at all.
LEADFEMALE:You're like Alex.
LEADFEMALE:That's an awful thing to say.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Forgive me.
OTHERFEMALE:What I mean is that Alex took over and-and kind of became the one who gave you advice and-and that you looked up to.
LEADMALE:Look, Mal, I know we don't have loads of stuff in common, but you're still my big sister.
SUPMALE:Your opinion means a lot to me.
OTHERFEMALE:If it didn't, I wouldn't have cared what you thought of Josh.
OTHERMALE:Jen, that means a lot to me.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I'm sorry I didn't give Josh a chance.
LEADMALE:Well, do you ever think you'll change your mind about him? Why don't we all go out after my scurvy clears up, and I'm sure I'll like him.
LEADMALE:You're on, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:And Mal? Yeah? I still love you, big sister.
SUPFEMALE: Jen, I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Or as the French say, "I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, these are all your birthday cards - that arrived today, right? - Right.
OTHERMALE:All the aunts, uncles, cousins, friends, covered, right? Right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'm gonna show you how to get through this pile of cards in minutes.
LEADMALE:Ready? You take your letter opener.
LEADFEMALE:You take your card, give it a clean slit along the top like this.
SUPFEMALE:Give it one of these.
LEADFEMALE:Quick snap of the wrist.
OTHERFEMALE:No money comes out in the trash.
SUPMALE:Try the next one here.
LEADFEMALE:Money comes out.
LEADMALE:Keep the money, take the card, throw it in the trash.
LEADMALE:Either way, you don't have to read the card.
OTHERMALE:That's the beauty of it.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Hey, what are you guys doing? Looking for birthday money.
SUPMALE:Well, that is terrible.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where did you learn that? I know, it's shocking, isn't it? Oh, Andy, look.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, now, this one's from your grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I bet she took a lot of special care trying to find a card for you with a nice birthday message.
LEADMALE:Um, here.
OTHERFEMALE:"Dear Andy, here's the cash.
LEADFEMALE:Love, Grandma.
SUPMALE:" That's the kind of love you just can't buy.
LEADMALE:Can you believe this? This is Andy's birthday wish list.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Alex, this is reminiscent of your seventh birthday.
LEADMALE:You're the only second-grader I knew who took advantage of the bridal registry.
LEADMALE:It was a great birthday.
LEADMALE:I got, uh, two pocket calculators and a crystal gravy boat.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hi, hon.
LEADMALE:Listen, you are about to meet Nick's oldest friend in the world.
LEADFEMALE:What, prison furlough program? No.
LEADMALE:His name is Scrapper, he's very old, he's missing a few teeth, and he used to live with Nick's mom.
LEADMALE:That would be Nick's dad? No, it wouldn't be.
LEADMALE:Nick, Scrapper, come on in! - Hey.
OTHERMALE:This guy.
SUPFEMALE:This is Scrapper.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't he great? He even looks like Nick.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he does.
SUPMALE:He's-he's got his mother's nose though.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, a dog! Hey, Scrapper, sit, sit.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't you do that? Whoa, hey, hey, how are ya? How are you? Please go away.
SUPFEMALE:Keep it coming, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Doolittle.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, I don't happen to relate well to quadrupeds.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, come on, Alex.
LEADMALE:I know animals.
LEADMALE:This dog is just begging for a little love and affection.
LEADMALE:Aren't you, little doggy? Um, Dad, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:He doesn't like to be called "little doggy.
OTHERFEMALE:" Oh, excuse me, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Sensitive.
LEADMALE:How old is he? Uh, well, let's see.
SUPMALE:I had him since I was six years old.
SUPFEMALE:So that would make him, uh Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, carry the seven.
SUPMALE:would be, uh Right, right.
LEADMALE:So in dog years, that would make him, uh Let's see.
LEADMALE:11 Old, Nick.
SUPFEMALE:He'd be old.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:He used to live with my mom, but she moved.
LEADFEMALE:And they don't take pets in her new building, so now he's mine again.
OTHERFEMALE:I think he likes you, Alex.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, it's-it's mutual, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish someone would slip him a breath mint.
LEADMALE:No, I think Mal's right.
SUPMALE:You know, he gave you dolly.
SUPMALE:He doesn't give you dolly unless he likes you.
LEADFEMALE:Scrapper, give Alex a kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, oh, great, great! I just hope my pores weren't open.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, how can you not like a doggy kiss? What is there to like about having your face covered in kibble residue? Oh, hey, you want to see him do some more tricks? Somebody to tell him to roll over.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, me, me, me.
OTHERMALE:Roll over, Scrapper, roll ov Okay, here's Pin the Tail on the Donkey and Bingo.
LEADFEMALE:What else do you think would be fun for Andy's birthday party? I don't know, but ask your dad.
LEADFEMALE:He's in charge of the entertainment.
SUPFEMALE:What does he have planned? - Oh, don't ask.
SUPMALE:He's gone completely overboard.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, it just won't do.
OTHERFEMALE:Because I've seen it all 
OTHERFEMALE:The confetti-in-the-bucket shtick, the, uh, sweeping up the spotlight.
LEADFEMALE:I want something special for my boy's birthday.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry you feel that way.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe! What's going on? Dad's having a standoff with a clown.
OTHERMALE:I'll handle it.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Dad this bozo giving you a hard time? All right, listen, thanks a lot for coming.
LEADMALE:And, uh, by the way, clowns aren't funny, okay? Aw, Dad, you got ten of them getting in and out of your car.
LEADMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Do-do you think Andy will suspect anything? Nah, he'll probably think it's one of Mallory's friends.
LEADFEMALE:Hi! God, you should have seen Scrapper playing Frisbee.
LEADMALE:He leaps up and catches it every time.
LEADMALE:He's not as good at throwing, but he's still better than Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:But can he convert shillings into drachmas? Ah, he can't do that, but he can Watusi.
SUPFEMALE:Are you two available for birthday parties? Here you go.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's dolly right here.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:God, I love this guy.
SUPFEMALE:I almost forgot what great fun it was having him around.
OTHERMALE:Nick, what could you possibly have in common with an animal that does nothing all day but eat, sleep and chew shoes? Then again, what don't you have in common? Alex, animals are different than people.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for noticing.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, uh, anybody for another round of Frisbee? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Alex.
OTHERMALE:You can get some pointers from Scrapper.
SUPMALE:Come on, Scrapper.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'll come with you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Scrapper! Come on, Scrapper.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, boy.
SUPFEMALE:Good boy.
LEADMALE:Good boy.
SUPMALE:That dog hates me, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:He's not coming to Andy's party.
LEADMALE:Steven, you have gone totally off the deep end - with this party business.
LEADFEMALE:Nonsense, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:It's just going to be a small, tasteful get-together.
SUPMALE:Now, look, the contortionist is coming at 2:00.
LEADMALE:The, uh the human lightbulb at 2:15.
LEADFEMALE:The human lightbulb? Steven, that's crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:She's only 60 watts, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:Mom, Dad! Um, uh What? - Scrapper got hit by a car! - Is he okay? - Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know! I can't look! Yeah, this has happened plenty of times.
SUPMALE:You know, Scrapper sees a car, he runs right into it.
SUPFEMALE:He's not too bright that way.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but it was that cat that ran out in the street.
SUPMALE:Yeah, cats are definitely his weakness.
LEADMALE:You know, he loves to run after them.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think he wants to hurt them.
LEADMALE:It's just that he's never seen one close up.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I could say the same.
LEADMALE:Ow, ow.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for watching them.
LEADMALE:They seem very fond of you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, they-they sure do, they sure do.
SUPMALE:You should think about getting their claws sharpened though.
LEADFEMALE:Left some skin on my neck.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry about that.
SUPMALE:They must think you're their mother.
SUPMALE:It's impossible; I've been out of town.
LEADMALE:Well, hello there.
SUPMALE:Alex, this poodle hates me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if it's any consolation, Dad, he's gonna have that haircut for the rest of his life.
LEADMALE:Scrapper's been in there for an awfully long time.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, I think he broke his leg.
LEADMALE:You know, he's broken everything.
LEADMALE:I mean, this place is like his second home, so - Nick? - Oh, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Austin, how's he doing, huh? Pretty banged up this time? Nick, why don't we go talk in here.
LEADMALE:Uh, come with me, would you, Mal? So what is it, huh, Doc? What'd he do, break his leg? No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid there are other much more serious problems.
LEADFEMALE:Just tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Scrapper was obviously hit very hard.
SUPMALE:He's suffered some brain damage.
LEADMALE:Hey, that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he doesn't have to be that smart.
SUPMALE:I'm afraid it's not a matter of that.
SUPMALE:He's breathing at only 20% of his lung capacity and there's also some internal bleeding.
SUPFEMALE:What are you saying? I'm saying that you may have to consider euthanasia.
LEADFEMALE:How can I consider? I don't even know what it means.
LEADMALE:Euthanasia means having Scrapper put to sleep.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, no way.
OTHERMALE:I am not gonna do that.
SUPMALE:Isn't there something else you can do? Well, I could operate to stop the bleeding.
LEADFEMALE:S-So do that.
LEADMALE:Nick, I have to tell you, Scrapper's a very, very old dog.
SUPFEMALE:His chances of making it are slim.
OTHERMALE:If you'd like, you can have some time to think about it.
LEADMALE:You know, the last thing I want to do is think about it.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Nick.
OTHERMALE:What other choice do I have, huh? Go ahead, operate.
LEADMALE:Do me a favor and, uh, put this in his cage.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you make fun of him for having a dolly.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do everything I can.
LEADFEMALE:Okay Okay, thanks Thanks for coming.
LEADMALE:Thanks for coming.
OTHERMALE:The, uh, the party is in two days.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see you then, huh? This is great.
LEADFEMALE:Watch the antenna.
SUPMALE:Good, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Great, great.
OTHERFEMALE:Steven, you promised you were gonna keep this simple.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, please, please.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to get into the spirit.
SUPFEMALE:A boy only turns seven once in his life.
SUPMALE:Don't let it happen without a crustacean.
OTHERMALE:Do you guys know a good place I could hide Andy's birthday present? He won't stop snooping.
LEADFEMALE:Right now, he is scanning my bedroom with a metal detector.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, well, try the hall closet.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll try anything right now.
LEADMALE:Hi, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:That's it; I can't take it.
OTHERMALE:It's a chemistry set.
LEADFEMALE:Mom and Dad, did we hear if Scrapper's okay yet? Nick and Alex and Mallory are still at the vet, honey, but I'm sure everything's gonna be okay.
SUPMALE:I want to tell you something.
LEADMALE:Yeah, what is it, birthday boy? I don't want to have a birthday party.
LEADMALE:But, Andy, why not? It just doesn't seem right, what Scrapper's going through.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, that's very sweet.
SUPFEMALE:No clowns, no Smurfs, no Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Lobster? Nope.
LEADMALE:Maybe for your birthday, Dad.
SUPMALE:It's not for five months.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How'd it go? Surgery's over, but the doctor said it's too soon to tell.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, it was so sad seeing Scrapper sleeping alone there in his cage.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, when Nick saw him, I can't believe he didn't cry.
SUPMALE:Alex cried though.
LEADMALE:That's That's completely untrue.
LEADMALE:Alex, it was so sweet.
LEADMALE:Your eyes welled up and your mouth went into that cute figure eight shape.
SUPFEMALE:You cried.
LEADMALE:That was an allergic reaction, And you know it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:How you doing? Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you have there, Nick? Ah, just some presents for Scrapper.
LEADMALE:When he gets out, I am gonna spoil him rotten.
LEADMALE:Check it out.
LEADFEMALE:I got a little squeaky ball here.
LEADFEMALE:He'll love this.
LEADMALE:And a, uh, little plastic fire hydrant all his own.
LEADMALE:And a rawhide chew bone.
OTHERMALE:That's for me.
LEADMALE:That's what I want for my birthday, presents for Scrapper.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think he'd like a chemistry set? Nick, I'm so glad to see how optimistic you are.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, he is gonna pull through, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
OTHERMALE:You know, I know Scrapper; he's a little trooper.
SUPMALE:And when he gets out and he's back on his paws again, me and him are gonna look at the album I'm gonna make - from these photos here, huh? - What do you got there? Look, uh, there's us in our backyard.
LEADMALE:And, uh, there's my mom with Scrapper.
LEADMALE:Hmm? And, oh, there's Scrapper chasing a stick.
OTHERMALE:Huh? Oh, there's my mom chasing a stick.
LEADMALE:Uh, uh, there's my mom and Scrapper both chasing a stick.
LEADMALE:Oh, and here's one just of the stick.
SUPMALE:God, those were good times.
OTHERMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, yes.
LEADMALE:Hi, Dr.
LEADMALE:Austin.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:He is.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on.
SUPMALE:Um, Nick, it's the vet.
SUPMALE:Uh, hello.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADMALE:Okay, I-I'll be there.
SUPMALE:I He said Scrapper's not doing so good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Honey Damn.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, if he hadn't come to stay with me, this never would have happened.
OTHERMALE:He wouldn't have gotten run over, and everything would just be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, it's not your fault.
LEADFEMALE:Where the hell is the doctor? Nick, give him a minute.
LEADFEMALE:He's in with a parakeet that swallowed a swing.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't believe what I just saw.
LEADFEMALE:There's a parakeet out there shaped like a swing.
LEADFEMALE:Alex? Alex, what are you doing here? Oh, listen, I know you guys, uh, well, I know you think I don't have much of a rapport with animals, but, um, there's a special place in my heart for old Scrapper.
SUPMALE:Hey, thanks, Alex.
LEADMALE:Well, uh Uh, no, hey, Alex, you can stay.
LEADMALE:Yeah? So, uh, what's the story, Doc? How's he doing, huh? Nick, things didn't go as well as we'd hoped.
LEADFEMALE:All right, have a seat.
LEADMALE:Um, isn't there anything more we can do? Maybe he just needs a little rest, huh? Nick, right now, Scrapper's on heavy medication, so he's only semi-conscious.
LEADFEMALE:When he comes out of it, he'll be scared and in pain.
LEADMALE:Now, we can keep him alive for a little while on machines, but that would be more for you than Scrapper.
LEADFEMALE:So you're saying there's no hope, huh? Nick, this isn't an easy thing to say, but the best thing you can do for Scrapper right now is to put him to sleep.
OTHERMALE:I I can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's so final.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, he's in pain.
OTHERFEMALE:You have to let them take the pain away.
OTHERMALE:Nick, it'll happen very quickly and peacefully.
LEADFEMALE:It's a decision that requires courage, but really it comes out of love.
LEADMALE:Are you okay? Oh, sure, I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Scrapper's my pal.
LEADFEMALE:I can't let him hurt like that.
LEADMALE:Can I at least say good-bye to him? Yes, of course.
LEADMALE:We'll leave you alone, okay? I love you.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, thanks, Alex.
SUPMALE:All right, I'm okay.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm all right.
SUPMALE:It's all right.
OTHERMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, Scrap.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing, buddy? I'll be outside.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Scrapper.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
OTHERMALE:Something's gonna happen to you that I can't do nothing about.
LEADFEMALE:But where you're going, there's gonna be somebody really nice there to take care of you.
LEADMALE:Hey, God, it's me, Nicky.
LEADMALE:Can you do me a favor and, uh take old Scrap here and put him under your wing? Give him a lot of love? He's really good at Frisbee.
OTHERMALE:I mean, if you're into that kind of thing.
LEADFEMALE:And he's a very, very special little soul.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm gonna miss him.
SUPMALE:Oh, I love you, Scrapper.
OTHERMALE:A chemistry set! Thanks, Jen! What a nice surprise.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay, okay, what's next? How about a little Pin the Tail on the Donkey, huh? It's really not much of a party feeling, honey.
SUPMALE:Even the lobster's depressed.
LEADMALE:Where's Nick? Oh, he's on his way over.
LEADMALE:Poor Nick he cried so hard on the way home, you know, like a little kid, when you can't catch your breath.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, at first I couldn't hear him because Alex was crying so hard.
SUPMALE:Can I help you? Dad, can you get this guy out of here? I'm gonna have nightmares, I swear.
LEADMALE:Get going, buddy, or I'm gonna start boiling water in a minute.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry it didn't work out, but, uh Oh, excuse me just a moment.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Hey, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:This is for you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Okay, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:So, how you doing, Nick? You okay? Uh, no.
SUPFEMALE:But, uh yeah, I guess.
LEADFEMALE:You? Yeah, I'm Hey, uh, you know, I-I'm real sorry I had to drag all you into this, huh? Oh, honey, don't be silly.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's okay.
LEADMALE:Nick, you're like family.
LEADFEMALE:Guy's dog just died.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
SUPMALE:Uh You know, I feel like part of me died with Scrapper.
LEADMALE:It's just every memory I have from childhood, Scrapper was part of them.
LEADMALE:You know, and it's just strange to think that he's gone.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, we know that nothing will ever take Scrapper's place, and that he'll always have a special place in your heart and in your memories.
SUPFEMALE:We can't help feeling that Scrapper would want you to go on, you know, want you to start over.
SUPMALE:Here, Nick, I want to give you this.
LEADFEMALE:It's the best birthday present I could have.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey there, little buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:We know you'll give him a good home, Nick.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, thanks, you guys.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, pal.
LEADMALE:What do you say, you want to be pals with me? Huh?
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Can I help you? Can't you see I'm trying to work here? - What is it, honey? -  Well, I'm really struggling, trying to find a new idea for a documentary.
OTHERMALE:It's been two weeks, I haven't come up with anything.
LEADFEMALE:The problem is, honey, you're competing with a lot of your earlier work it's hard to top some of the things you've already done.
LEADMALE:I must admit they were very good.
LEADMALE:"In recognition of excellence for the documentary "The Automatic Milking 
LEADMALE:The Day the Cows Dried Out.
OTHERMALE:" That one made me cry.
LEADMALE:Perhaps my best work.
OTHERMALE:"So You Think You Know Your Hat.
LEADFEMALE:" - Are my friends here yet? - No, not yet, honey, - but I have your milk and cookies all ready.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, hey.
OTHERMALE:Milk and cookies.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, milk.
LEADMALE:Milk, cows.
LEADFEMALE:Milking machines! Don't you oh.
LEADFEMALE: Wait a minute, I've done that.
LEADMALE: I've done it all.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Dad, I think I've got it.
LEADMALE:How about a documentary on teenage sex? As far as you're concerned, there's no such thing as teenage sex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but there is.
LEADMALE:You don't know anything about it either.
OTHERMALE:Okay, how about a documentary about a brilliant young artist? You can use Nick.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you could start in his childhood when aliens replaced his brain with a throw rug.
LEADMALE: I'll get it! They're my friends.
LEADMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Your directions were perfect.
LEADFEMALE:These are my friends, Joseph Simmons and Eva Martin.
LEADMALE:Gee, they're so old.
LEADMALE:Maybe they got left back a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Andy you did tell your parents that we're from the retirement center, didn't you? - Oh!  - Oh! The retirement center! Andy's class visits there every week.
LEADMALE:It's a school project.
LEADMALE:Oh, please, please, - come in, come in, sit down.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:No, welcome.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Steven Keaton, Andy's father.
OTHERFEMALE:It's so nice to meet you.
OTHERFEMALE:This is, uh, my wife Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, excuse me, I feel as though I know the family already.
OTHERMALE:I'll bet that's Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:You're Mallory.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:And you must be Alex.
LEADFEMALE: Alex, you know, everyone at the center is so grateful to you for teaching Andy to fill out our tax returns.
LEADMALE:Who would guess you could deduct prunes? Well, I hope we'll see you again.
SUPFEMALE:Certainly, if Andy will be kind enough to invite us again.
LEADMALE:Mi casa es su casa.
LEADFEMALE:Oh -  - Well, we'll see you later.
SUPMALE:See you later.
LEADFEMALE:Nice meeting you.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Andy really seems to enjoy visiting you at the center.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, Andy's become a very good friend.
SUPMALE:You know, you can't imagine how nice it is to have a lively visitor each week.
LEADMALE: We're running a little low, Andy.
OTHERMALE:I'll go get some more.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, according to Andy, uh, there's so many activities, you hardly have a moment free.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Clark, the director of the center, she believes that seniors should always be kept busy.
LEADMALE:If you're not busy, she'll lecture you until you chase her off with a shuffleboard stick.
SUPMALE:Then she's happy.
LEADMALE: Joseph, you know you enjoy the activities.
SUPFEMALE: - He's shuffleboard champion.
LEADMALE:Yeah, haven't lost a game in four years.
LEADMALE:They're talking about testing for steroids.
LEADFEMALE: Well, it seems like you lead a really full life at the center.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, you know how it is.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing is perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, uh, Eva is perfect.
LEADMALE: 
LEADMALE:Excuse me, but we've done nothing but talk about ourselves since we came in.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, no, don't apologize; it's been very interesting.
SUPMALE:And I think you may have solved a problem for me.
OTHERMALE:How about a documentary about a first grader visiting a retirement center? Oh, I think that's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:No, i-it feels very good, especially since Americans are living so much longer now.
LEADMALE:And I could personalize it by focusing in on you two and your lives.
SUPFEMALE:What did I tell you, Eva? Stick with me, kid, I'll get you in show business.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Joseph! Hi, Eva! Hi, Sam! 
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hello, Andy.
LEADMALE:Hello, Steven.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Sam, this is Steven Keaton.
LEADMALE:He's making a documentary about Andy and all of us people - at the center here.
LEADMALE:How nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And this is, this is Jack McDowell, my cameraman.
SUPFEMALE:Jack is gonna be taking some background footage today.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, Keaton.
OTHERFEMALE:I know your work.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You did the documentary with the hats.
LEADFEMALE: They show that every year.
OTHERFEMALE:That's one of my favorites.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm no film critic, but it seems to me, in a half hour about hats, you could throw in a pair of socks.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Keaton, I'm Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Clark.
LEADMALE:We spoke on the telephone.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Very nice to meet you.
SUPMALE:Yes, we appreciate you giving us permission to tape here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, not at all.
LEADFEMALE:But please remember the conditions.
SUPMALE:Try to keep the noise down, don't interfere with any of the organized activities, and if you overstimulate any of the seniors, I'll have to ask you to leave.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about the over stimulation.
LEADMALE:He did the thing with the hats.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, well, look, uh, here's how I'd like to start.
OTHERFEMALE:Andy, I want you to sit, uh, with Joseph and Eva.
SUPFEMALE:And what am I, an end table? And Sam and I will ask you some questions.
LEADMALE:Very good.
SUPMALE:Okay? - Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Uh, Andy, um, what's it like coming to the retirement center? Well, the first thing I've noticed, everybody's older than me.
SUPMALE:By a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, what do you like best about being here? Well, I like it when they tell me stories.
LEADMALE:Joseph, tell the story of how you met Eva.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Andy, you know, when my wife died, I moved in with my son David.
LEADMALE:Well we didn't get along too well, and so eventually we decided that I should move in here to the center.
LEADMALE:I get along with my dad very well.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad! 
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:And then one day we were all sitting around here, you know, just like every other day, then all of a sudden, in walks the most beautiful vision you have ever seen in your life.
LEADMALE:That must have been Eva.
LEADFEMALE: It sure was.
SUPFEMALE:And I noticed Joseph right away, too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh And, you know, then I knew right away that I had met the woman that I was gonna marry.
OTHERFEMALE:And someday we will.
LEADFEMALE:Not someday, Eva.
SUPFEMALE:Time goes by too quickly.
LEADMALE:Will you marry me? Did you get that? Joseph my answer is yes.
OTHERFEMALE: Well, I don't believe it! Cut! - Cut! - Wonderful!  Hey, Dad.
SUPMALE:Pretty festive in here.
SUPFEMALE:What's all this? - Well, can't you see, son? - We're in the movies.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Steven Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hey.
LEADFEMALE:WKS.
LEADMALE:David Simmons.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what are you taping here? Well, we're doing a documentary on life here at the center, and, uh, well, we just captured a very, very special moment on tape.
LEADMALE:Well, Joseph, I'm sure you'd like to tell your son.
LEADMALE:Well, David, my boy - What is it, Pop? Well, Eva and I are gonna get married.
LEADMALE:Well, come on, kiss the bride.
LEADMALE:Come on, seriously, Dad, - what's going on? - I I am serious.
LEADMALE:I mean, we've got the honeymoon planned.
LEADMALE:You bet.
SUPFEMALE:They're going to a retirement center in Hawaii.
LEADFEMALE:You are serious about this.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Pop.
LEADMALE:Hmm? Okay, just wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Look, okay, it's crazy.
LEADFEMALE:You two cannot get married.
SUPFEMALE:All right, you're 74 years old.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, too young? No, Dad, now, be realistic.
LEADMALE:You can't get married.
LEADFEMALE:You can't move out of the center.
OTHERMALE:I mean, how are you gonna take care of yourself? I'm not going to take care of myself.
OTHERMALE:I am going to take care of Eva, and Eva is gonna take care of me.
LEADFEMALE:Who's gonna take care of me? David, I'm not going to let anything happen to your father.
LEADFEMALE:Eva with all due respect, I don't think this thing can possibly work out.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to listen to this.
LEADMALE:Let's go, Eva.
SUPMALE:Dad? Jennifer, the water cooler's empty.
LEADMALE:Will you help me with a new bottle? - Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Oh - Here, I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Oh, God, these things are heavy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, maybe we should wait, let Mom do it.
OTHERFEMALE:We can do it.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, we have to take the top off.
LEADFEMALE:I know we have to take the top off.
OTHERMALE:I have to get my hand off -  - Wait, Jennifer, please hold on.
SUPMALE:Here, here.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, my hand's right underneath it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't you can't I can't hold the whole thing by myself.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies you want to hurry up with this, please? I'm thirsty.
LEADMALE:Alex, you could give us a hand, you know.
OTHERMALE:What, are you kidding me? I don't touch this.
LEADMALE:Wait till Mom gets home.
OTHERMALE:Alex! - Alex! All right, all right, all right, - all right, all right.
LEADMALE:All right, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:First we gotta take the top - Take the top off we know.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, all right.
SUPMALE: Thank you.
LEADMALE:Okay, all right, now just bring it around.
OTHERFEMALE:No, wait, you're gonna spill it.
LEADFEMALE: - I-I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm getting it.
LEADMALE:I'm right here.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, we'll, we'll all get it, okay? We'll 
LEADMALE:Hi, kids.
SUPFEMALE:Is your dad home? Uh, he's not in right now; he should be back shortly.
SUPMALE:Care for a drink? Well, no, thanks.
SUPMALE:Do you mind if we wait for him? - No, help yourself.
LEADMALE:No, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:You need some help? - Uh Nah, it's all right.
SUPMALE:No, we got it.
LEADMALE: Well, it's no trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Eva does it all the time.
LEADMALE:Well, we appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:We-we got it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, all right.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE: You're gonna spill it all over me, Mallory! 
SUPFEMALE:Just bring it bring it up.
LEADMALE:Just bring it up.
SUPMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mom, how are you? - Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Mom.
OTHERMALE: Attagirl.
LEADFEMALE:Joseph! Eva! Great to see you! - Getting ready for the big day? - Well, yes, we've actually just been taking a walk.
SUPMALE:And, uh, discussing the wedding plans.
SUPMALE:Oh, you must be so excited.
LEADMALE:I remember what it was like before our wedding.
SUPFEMALE:It must've been very beautiful.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, it was.
SUPMALE:It was outside in Golden Gate Park.
LEADMALE:All our friends were there with guitars and everyone singing.
LEADMALE:Everyone was crying.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, weddings can be very emotional.
LEADMALE:No, it was the tear gas.
SUPMALE:Ou-Our wedding was held in the middle of a protest.
LEADMALE:Was it political? Uh, no, it was her father.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you mean we're having some family problems, too.
LEADMALE:I understand your son David - isn't making this easy for you.
LEADMALE: Well, I don't know what it is.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, why can't he be happy for me? I've tried to talk about it with him, but but somehow we can't communicate.
LEADFEMALE:We were wondering if maybe you could talk to him, Steven.
SUPMALE:Well, Joseph, Eva, I-I'd I'd love to help, but I don't know how I could.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I-I barely know your son.
OTHERMALE:But you can relate to him.
SUPMALE:I mean, you're, you're, you're more his age, and you speak his groovy kind of lingo.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, who can we go to? We're all alone except for the few people we know at the center.
SUPMALE:Please, Steven.
LEADMALE:We could really use some help.
LEADFEMALE:David comes to the center every Thursday to visit.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll try.
SUPFEMALE:I'll try, but I'm not sure what I'm gonna say.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Now we can go on with our walk.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Well, it's lovely that you dropped by.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPMALE:Please-please come at any time.
LEADMALE:Good-bye.
SUPMALE:See you Thursday.
LEADMALE:I'll be there.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks a lot.
SUPMALE:You bet.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE: -  What? What-what was that all about? - Well, Joseph and Eva want to get married.
SUPFEMALE: But his son David is adamantly opposed to the idea.
SUPMALE:Ah, well, I'm sure he has his reasons.
SUPMALE:I mean, you know, caring for an elderly parent, that's a that's an awesome responsibility.
LEADFEMALE:How would you know? Oh, come on, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:I've given this a lot of thought, you know? And I think that-that children have an obligation to plan for the day when their parents become a burden on society.
LEADMALE:I mean, uh God knows I have.
LEADMALE:Well, that's, uh that's a relief, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother and I were afraid we were going to be set adrift on an ice floe.
LEADMALE:Dad, Mom, I promise you that's a last resort.
LEADMALE:No, when your time comes, I'm gonna make sure you get put into the most comfortable, elegant retirement center available.
SUPMALE:Honey, honey, we're not gonna live in a retirement center.
LEADMALE:We're gonna live with you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, then it's the ice floe.
SUPMALE:Joseph, Eva, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello, Steven.
SUPMALE:Hi, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:Where's your camera? - Well, Sam, I'm, uh I'm here to pay a little social call today.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's great, and I got all made-up.
LEADMALE:I didn't notice anything different.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you see what I did with my hair? No.
SUPFEMALE:I parted it on the other side.
SUPMALE:Of the room.
LEADFEMALE: Oh!  - Crazy.
SUPFEMALE: Steve, can I have a word with you? Oh, sure, sure, sure.
SUPFEMALE: - What is it? - Well, first of all, - I want to thank you very much for coming.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
OTHERMALE:And, uh, David is gonna be here soon.
LEADMALE:Well, I just hope I can do some good.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, I'm sure you will be able to, but just if by chance you should run into any kind of a difficulty, I've just, uh, prepared a short list of points you might want to make.
LEADFEMALE:"David, remember when you were seven years old, and I bought you that bicycle?" Thank you, but I, uh I don't think it'll come to this.
LEADMALE: - Hello, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE: Ah, hello, David.
LEADMALE:My, this is a surprise.
LEADFEMALE:Who would have expected you to be here today? What are you talking about? He comes every Thursday.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go part your hair on the other side of the room? All right.
LEADMALE:Uh, I know where I'm not wanted.
LEADMALE:You can cry on my shoulder, Sam.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, sweet potato.
OTHERMALE:Uh, say, David, can I speak to you for a minute? - Yeah, sure.
SUPMALE: Uh look, I-I I realize you have an objection to your father and Eva getting married, but I'd like you to reconsider your position.
SUPFEMALE:Now, from what I can see, wouldn't a marriage make the rest of their golden years more fulfilling and rewarding? Look, yeah, I appreciate your concern, but I don't see how it's any of your business.
LEADFEMALE:David, remember when you were seven, and I bought you that bicycle? Dad, if you have something to say to me, - you want to try saying it yourself? - I have, but you haven't listened.
LEADMALE:I want your blessing on this marriage.
OTHERFEMALE:W-Wait a minute now.
LEADFEMALE:You're old enough.
SUPMALE:You don't need my blessing, so what is it? Why are you so stubborn? Why can't you accept Eva? She's a wonderful woman.
SUPFEMALE:And she's so like your mother.
SUPMALE:No, she's nothing like my mother.
SUPFEMALE:You obviously don't remember Mom.
SUPMALE:You don't want to remember Mom; you want to get married and move on - and forget she ever existed.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so that's what all this is about.
LEADFEMALE:David, don't you know I think of your mother every living day? Don't you think that she'd want me to be happy? Oh  - Um, look, look, may-maybe I should go now.
LEADFEMALE: No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, maybe I should.
SUPMALE:How'd it go? - Oh, he's impossible.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't care anymore.
LEADFEMALE:He is not gonna ruin our happiness.
SUPMALE:We are gonna get married, Eva, and we're gonna get married right here in this center.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe we could fix it up a little.
LEADMALE:Uh throw something over Sam.
OTHERMALE:You do, you lose the whole look of the room.
LEADMALE:I just wish it could be more like family.
LEADFEMALE: Look, Joseph, Eva, I think my family would be honored if you'd consider having the wedding at our house.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Steven, thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE: Andrew, aren't weddings lovely? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Joseph and Eva are the first one in my crowd to get married.
LEADMALE:Oh, Joseph, perfect timing.
LEADMALE:Oh, you got to be kidding.
LEADMALE:I got here an hour ago.
LEADMALE:I've been walking round and round the block.
LEADMALE:I'm a nervous wreck.
LEADMALE:Also, I've got cold feet.
OTHERFEMALE:Cold feet? You aren't having second thoughts, are you? No, my circulation's not too good.
SUPMALE: I-I just took a peek at the bride.
LEADFEMALE:Eva is wearing her grandmother's wedding dress she looks so lovely.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, Joseph, - good to see you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
OTHERMALE:So, my father tells me you're something of a cardplayer.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, I'm nothing special.
LEADMALE:You play? Wha Me? No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to learn, though.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Black Mariah, lowball with a split? One-eyed jacks, kings with the ax?  Hey there.
LEADMALE:I, uh I didn't think you'd come.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, up until a few minutes ago, neither did I.
SUPFEMALE:If you've come here to try to stop me, don't.
LEADMALE:Uh, no.
LEADMALE:No, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I-I th I thought a lot about what you said.
LEADMALE:Dad, you were right.
LEADMALE:Mom would want you to be happy, and-and I do, too.
OTHERFEMALE:And I think that Eva is a wonderful woman.
SUPMALE:So congratulations.
LEADMALE:Thank you, David.
SUPMALE:This means more to me than you will ever know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, listen, if, uh if you can possibly forgive me, I'd love to be your best man.
LEADMALE:There's no better best man in this room.
LEADFEMALE: Yes.
LEADMALE:Mom? The bride's ready.
OTHERMALE:Oh, um Joseph, uh, Eva is ready.
LEADFEMALE:We can, we can start now.
LEADFEMALE:We can start now, all right?  MALLORY 
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, there's one thing I have to ask you before you go down there.
LEADFEMALE:Did anyone talk to you about the wedding night? My mother told me 50 years ago.
LEADMALE:I still think I remember some of the basics.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:  Friends, we are gathered here to witness a very special union, a union that lends credence to the immeasurable power of love.
LEADMALE:Joseph Simmons and Eva Martin will be married here today.
SUPMALE:And now Joseph and Eva would like to express in their own words their feelings at this moment.
LEADMALE:Eva, at a time when most men are only thinking of the life that is behind them, your love and friendship have given me a gift beyond 
SUPFEMALE:A future.
SUPFEMALE:Joseph, before I met you, there were seconds, minutes, hours, but they were only ticks of a clock.
LEADMALE:Now each moment is a precious jewel to be cherished because it'll be shared with you.
LEADMALE: And so, by the power vested in me by the state of Ohio, I pronounce you husband and wife.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to present for the very first time, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:And Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Joseph Simmons.
LEADMALE: Steven, I'm so glad we had the wedding here.
SUPFEMALE:The house just feels full of love.
SUPMALE:You ever seen a more beautiful bride? Only once, Elyse.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dad.
SUPMALE:How was work? Oh, another day, another dollar.
LEADMALE:You know, Dad, yours is one of the few jobs where that's literally true.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe so, Alex, but today was no ordinary day.
OTHERFEMALE:On the way home, I, uh, noticed that Murphy's Bookstore - was having a going-out-of-business sale.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:So I stopped off and I got a little something for everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Elyse, this is for you.
OTHERMALE:Cat in the Hat? Oh, um, no.
OTHERFEMALE:That's, uh that's Andy's.
SUPFEMALE:There's yours.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Gothic Architecture in Ancient Babylonia.
LEADMALE:I'll take Cat in the Hat.
LEADFEMALE:No way, Mom.
LEADMALE:Mal, here you go.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God! Oh, it's the new Shirley MacLaine autobiography There Must Be a Higher Power in the Universe If I'm Making So Much Money Doing What I'm Doing.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Dad.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE:Jen, I thought you might enjoy this.
LEADFEMALE:Trout Fishing in Canada.
LEADMALE:Finally in paperback.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:They-they must have given me the wrong book.
SUPFEMALE:I'll take care of that tomorrow, and Alex, number one on the financial best seller list.
SUPMALE:Hey, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Now Give Me Money, That's What I Want.
SUPFEMALE:That's what I wa-a-a-a-ant.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I want.
OTHERFEMALE:And best of all, I got this for myself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, The American Medical Association Medical Guide.
LEADFEMALE:You feeling okay? - Oh, I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's just, since the heart attack, I've been more concerned about, uh, good health, and this book has home remedies, uh, safety tips, symptoms of all your major diseases.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a real page-turner, Dad.
SUPMALE:Oh, it is, Mal, it is.
SUPMALE:Uh, now, for example, let's say you've been feeling tired, irritated, frustrated, depressed.
LEADFEMALE:You turn to the self-diagnosis chart, and it tells you what you have.
LEADMALE:Oh, teenagers.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this teenager's about to drop from hunger if we don't eat soon.
SUPMALE:Well, honey, the alfalfa barnacle croquettes are ready.
LEADMALE:Ah, darn it.
LEADMALE:And I'm going out for dinner.
SUPFEMALE:With whom? With Paul Corman.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's nice.
SUPMALE:I haven't seen him since he graduated from Leland last year.
LEADMALE:What's he doing now? What's he doing now? He happens to be an associate at Dunn and Bradley, the biggest investment banking firm in Ohio.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:I know that's not as impressive as most of your friends.
SUPMALE:I mean, who could forget Shirley Applebaum, the woman who invented neon support hose? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:Hey, Paul.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, give me your coat.
LEADMALE:You know everybody, right? - Paul.
LEADMALE:Hey, Paul.
OTHERMALE:How are you? - Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:So What's new in the market? Well, I'm assuming you read Stimson's article in the Journal today? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, I can't believe he's still carrying that old Keynesian deficit spending currency-infusion banner.
LEADMALE:Actually I thought he did a good job refuting Dawson's pseudo-supply side inversion theory.
LEADFEMALE:Well, granted, Dawson's last essay was way too reminiscent of Klemps' piece on the refinancing of third-world debt through a suspension of the IMF loans.
LEADFEMALE:At least it was better than Oppenheimer's piece.
SUPMALE:Oh, God, did you read Oppenheimer's piece? - That bit about the variable prime rates? - Prime rates.
SUPMALE:Oh, stop it.
SUPMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:Stop.
LEADMALE:Whoa Oh, my God.
OTHERMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERMALE:I guess you had to be there.
LEADMALE:Oh, God.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, oh, I'm sorry, we must be boring the rest of you.
SUPMALE:I did just have an out-of-body experience.
SUPMALE:Oh, by the way, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Dunn and Bradley are looking to hire a new associate, and I-I gave your rÃ©sumÃ© to the hiring committee, and they want to meet with you sometime next week.
LEADMALE:Well, I hope you don't mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, let me give you a complete tour of the place.
SUPMALE:This is my desk.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey - Nice, isn't it? Everything you need to make it in the business world.
LEADFEMALE:Computer, fax machine, terminal, Pepto-Bismol extra-strength Pepto-Bismol.
OTHERFEMALE:Industrial-stregth Maalox.
LEADMALE:And, hey, look at this.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:That was when we, uh, co-won the Newman Award for excellence in undergraduate economics.
LEADFEMALE:We really had some good times, didn't we? - Yup, I'll say.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Yeah, remember the, uh, night of our high school prom? We snuck down and we watched them load tens and 20s into the automatic teller machine.
SUPMALE:It's one of the most romantic nights of my life.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Corman.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, good morning, Ms.
SUPFEMALE:Daniels.
LEADFEMALE:Ms.
SUPFEMALE:Foster is ready for Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton now.
SUPMALE:Okay, listen, Paul, uh, no matter what happens in there, um I really want to thank you for setting up this interview.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, you just go in there, knock 'em dead.
LEADMALE:No, you listen to me.
SUPMALE:I'm not gonna stand for this nonsense.
LEADFEMALE:I won't be jerked around, you understand? Either you come through for me, or you're out.
LEADFEMALE:You can be replaced, you know.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Say hello to Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Alex Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Jessica Foster.
SUPMALE:Good to meet you.
LEADMALE:Good to meet you, Ms.
SUPMALE:Foster.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex Keaton.
LEADMALE:Yes, I know.
SUPFEMALE:Please have a seat.
LEADMALE:Yeah, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I agreed to see you today, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, because this is an outstanding rÃ©sumÃ©.
LEADFEMALE:Fine school, excellent grades, terrific recommendations.
OTHERMALE:I was particularly impressed with this one from, uh, Richard Nixon.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately that may not be enough.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, excuse me? Every applicant who comes in that door went to a top school and received straight As.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm looking for something special.
SUPFEMALE:Something different.
LEADMALE:Something extraordinary.
OTHERFEMALE:I do a little juggling.
LEADMALE:I'm quite serious, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:If you're not, perhaps we should just terminate this interview.
LEADMALE:Ah, well, Ms.
LEADMALE:Foster, look, uh, I-I understand exactly what it is you're getting at and, believe me, I can help you.
SUPFEMALE:Really? How exciting.
SUPFEMALE:I can help you because not only do I have the basic training and know-how necessary to structure a takeover merger, supervise a leveraged buyout, and-and make change blindfolded, I also have what can't be taught.
LEADMALE:A vibrant, passionate, almost life-threatening love of money.
SUPMALE:A killer instinct for cash.
LEADMALE:A lust for traveler's checks.
LEADMALE:Now, sure, everyone who comes through this door loves money.
LEADMALE:But do they dream about it? Do they fantasize about it? Do they roll around naked in it? I do.
SUPMALE:Now, Ms.
SUPFEMALE:Foster, I'm sure you're familiar with the saying that the love of money is the root of all evil.
LEADMALE:So what? They're gonna have to do a lot better than that to get me to stop loving money.
SUPMALE:I mean, it is as fundamental to our lives as-as food, air, and shelter.
SUPFEMALE:Ms.
LEADMALE:Foster, you asked for something special.
SUPMALE:I am something special.
LEADMALE:I am something different.
SUPMALE:I am something extraordinary.
SUPFEMALE:I am money, hear me roar! Elyse.
SUPMALE:Would you feel my head? Why? I think I'm coming down with malaria.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, that is the fourth disease you've contracted since you got that book.
LEADFEMALE:That's been what? Malaria, mumps, chicken pox, and postpartum depression.
SUPFEMALE:You look fine to me, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Well, excuse me, Mal, but I don't remember seeing your medical degree around recently.
LEADMALE:In fact, I doubt that any of you are really equipped to deal with even the most common medical emergencies.
OTHERMALE:Such as? Well, for example, do any of you know how to handle snake bites? Sure, you suck the poison out.
SUPMALE:Not necessarily, Mal.
SUPMALE:It all depends on the type of snake that's involved.
LEADFEMALE:You see, the copperhead's bite only results in mild pain and discomfort.
LEADMALE:But the cobra's bite induces dizziness, disorientation, and delirium.
SUPMALE:It's obviously the one that got you.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:How'd the interview go? Well, let me put it to you this way, Jen, all my life there's been something I wanted to buy, but I never had the occasion to wear it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, today I bought it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, either you got the job or you've been possessed by Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Magoo.
OTHERFEMALE:I got the job.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's great, great.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Alex! And you know what they said? They said that if it goes well, they're gonna transfer me to Wall Street.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know what that means? You'll be moving out.
OTHERFEMALE:It means I will be rich.
OTHERMALE:And that is all I've ever wanted my whole life.
SUPMALE:Well, to be rich and not to go bald before I was 30.
LEADFEMALE:And to have a Porsche and to not go bald in that Porsche.
SUPFEMALE:He's delirious.
LEADMALE:Maybe got bit by a cobra.
LEADFEMALE:And I would like you all to have one of these as a token of my profound gratitude.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, son, this makes it all worthwhile.
OTHERFEMALE:And here is the man that I have to thank for all of this.
LEADFEMALE:You know what we're gonna do tonight? You know how we're gonna celebrate? We're gonna pop open a couple bottles of champagne, and we're gonna watch reruns of Wall Street Week until the sun comes up.
SUPMALE:Let the good times roll, Alex.
LEADMALE:But first I'm gonna take you all out to eat for the most expensive meal you can get at Guido's.
OTHERFEMALE:Yum, I think I can eat with this fever.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Okay, let's, uh, let's get moving so we can catch the early bird special.
SUPFEMALE:So, you think that I'm gonna have a desk near yours? Actually I-I think you're gonna have my desk.
LEADMALE:What does that mean? Alex, they fired me.
LEADMALE:You're kidding me, right? Foster called me into her office just before the end of the day.
LEADFEMALE:She said she was unhappy with my work, that I didn't have enough of a lust for cash, and that I don't want to roll around naked in money.
LEADFEMALE:What sort of lunatic would do that? She said there are only so many positions at the firm, and that you had the kind of killer instinct that, uh, she was looking for.
LEADMALE:I'm really sorry, Paul.
LEADFEMALE:Eh, it's okay.
LEADMALE:I mean, I was probably on the way out anyway.
LEADMALE:You know, I, I'd rather see you get it than somebody else.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, listen, I-I'm go I'm gonna go.
SUPMALE:I'll, uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll give you a call.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Paul? Didn't you invite him to dinner? Uh, he didn't feel much like going out.
LEADMALE:He just found out he got fired.
SUPMALE:Well, that's terrible on the same day you were hired.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I think I got his job.
LEADMALE:Well, you're not gonna take it, are you? Of course I'm gonna take it, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:I mean, this is the way it is in the business world.
SUPFEMALE:But, honey, he's your friend.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I am not gonna turn down a job that pays $45,000 a year.
LEADMALE:$45,000? How well did you really know him? Let's go.
OTHERMALE:Let's go celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait, Alex how can you celebrate at a time like this? All right, forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll go celebrate by myself.
SUPFEMALE:I knew he'd get out of paying for this dinner.
LEADMALE:Well, good morning, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Welcome to your first day - at Dunn and Bradley.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, Ms.
SUPFEMALE:Foster.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, I envy you.
SUPMALE:I remember my first day on the job.
LEADFEMALE:It was so exciting.
OTHERFEMALE:I was right out of Harvard.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:A business major? No, a literature major.
LEADFEMALE:What a waste of time.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it could have been worse.
SUPMALE:Could have been an ethics major.
LEADFEMALE:All right, let's get back to work.
LEADMALE:This is the paperwork on the Dell merger.
SUPMALE:I'd like an analysis - by the end of the day.
LEADMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, you can take Corman's old desk.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, Alex P.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Paul Corman doesn't work here anymore.
SUPMALE:No, I don't feel guilty about that.
LEADMALE:All right, Mallory, knock it off.
LEADMALE:Please hold.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Uh, Ms.
LEADFEMALE:Foster I finished that analysis of the Dell merger.
LEADMALE:Hmm, very nice, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:Very nice.
LEADMALE:This is the best analysis I've seen in months.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to do very well here, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:I quit.
LEADFEMALE:You have trouble with compliments, don't you? Look, uh, I'm sitting out here, looking over market reports, merger profiles, security violations stuff I love but I can't enjoy it.
SUPMALE:I can't enjoy it because I took a friend's job.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, I understand what you're going through.
LEADFEMALE:We all have friends.
LEADFEMALE:Not me personally.
LEADFEMALE:But we can't let them get in the way of business.
LEADMALE:Yeah, maybe that's true, but, uh, it's not the way I want to get my business career started.
OTHERMALE:Ms.
LEADMALE:Foster, look, I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to resign.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever you want.
LEADFEMALE:But you know what I think, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton? I think you're just a nice, sweet guy.
LEADMALE:Take that back.
LEADMALE:I bet you've never done anything truly nasty in your entire life.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Get my family on the phone.
LEADMALE:What did you ever do that showed a killer instinct? In the seventh grade I poured salt on a slug.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of salt.
LEADMALE:You're pathetic! Get out of my office! All right, fine, okay, okay.
LEADMALE:Let me tell you something.
LEADFEMALE:I may be a nice guy, but you have way too many lamps in this office! All right, you've pulled your drowning victim out of the water.
SUPMALE:You've completed the resuscitation.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the next step is to expel the water from the lungs, which is achieved with a firm push on the chest cavity so.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's mature, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Well, Steven, you've been letting that silly medical book dominate your whole life.
SUPFEMALE:It's true, Dad.
LEADMALE:Every day we've had a first-aid demonstration.
SUPFEMALE:It's like living with the school nurse.
LEADMALE:These are all very basic techniques that everyone should know! Dad, how often are we gonna have to extract poison arrows? Yeah, you walk around complaining about ailments you couldn't possibly have! Like what? Oh, Steven, you are not molting! Oh, no, Elyse? This is my second skin today.
SUPMALE:I don't know what's happening to me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys.
LEADMALE:Hey, honey, how was your first day at work? I quit.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, nobody works at that place very long, do they? Ah, you guys were right.
LEADMALE:I mean, I couldn't take that job after they fired Paul.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I could just go down there and forget about it, but, uh, didn't work out that way.
LEADMALE:Honey, I think that was very noble of you.
LEADMALE:You had to make a choice between money and friendship, and you chose friendship.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I would have lost my shirt on that bet.
SUPMALE:I don't think you guys fully appreciate how devastating this is to me.
LEADMALE:I mean, I always assumed that when the time came, that I could be cold and heartless and tough.
LEADMALE:That's what it takes to make it in the business world.
OTHERFEMALE:Instead it turns out I've got a conscience.
LEADMALE:Damn it.
SUPMALE:Alex, you did the right thing.
SUPMALE:Otherwise you wouldn't have been able to live with yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:As Friedrich Nietzsche once said, "If a friend does evil to you, "say to him, 'I forgive you for what you did to me, but how could I forgive you for what you did to yourself?"' Grow up, Jen.
LEADMALE:Alex, I'm sure there are plenty of sharks in the business world, but I'm also sure there are plenty of decent, compassionate people who have become very successful.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dad, name one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's your Uncle Charlie.
LEADMALE:Dad, Uncle Charlie manufactures wax fruit.
SUPFEMALE:Not only.
OTHERMALE:He's been getting into lips and candles.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, let's face it.
LEADMALE:I haven't got what it takes.
LEADMALE:I'm just not tough enough to make it.
LEADMALE:I got to find myself a kinder, gentler profession.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'll become a nun.
LEADMALE:You could work with me at the station.
LEADFEMALE:Nuns make more.
LEADFEMALE:Look, honey, even if you are nice, we're still proud of you.
LEADMALE:Dad, I was looking in your medical book.
SUPFEMALE:I have a question.
OTHERMALE:Oh, sure, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:What's up? What's human reproduction? Well, Andy, it's, um Uh mm sort of Elyse? Your father doesn't actually know, honey.
LEADFEMALE:It's, it's when a man and a woman, uh Birds do it.
LEADMALE:Uh Bees do it.
LEADFEMALE:Educated fleas do it.
SUPMALE:Nice going, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Ruth.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, help us out here.
LEADMALE:How should we know? You never told us.
SUPFEMALE:Un, Andy, look, come out in the kitchen - and we'll explain it to you.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I know what it means.
LEADMALE:I just wanted to see how they would react.
SUPMALE:Hey, Paul.
LEADMALE:Are you crazy? Why did you quit? Listen, get on the phone, call Foster, and tell her you want that job back.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it, Paul.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not taking your job.
OTHERMALE:It's not my job.
LEADMALE:It's a job and it's open.
LEADMALE:You should have never let it go.
LEADFEMALE:You would have done the same thing for me.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, really? You think I would have quit a $45,000-a-year job for you? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you're right.
LEADMALE:$50,000 would be a different story, of course.
SUPMALE:I completely understand.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'll tell you this much, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:You're a hell of a nice guy.
LEADMALE:Look, I know, I know.
SUPFEMALE:I'll grow out of it.
LEADMALE:Anyway, there are a lot of, lot of jobs out there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, actually I, uh, I think I got a shot at a job over at Hughes-Simpson.
OTHERMALE:Hey, congratulations.
LEADMALE:Hey, well, you know, guys like us bounce back quick.
LEADMALE:Hey, you bet.
LEADMALE:Think you can get me an interview?
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Everyone? Guess what I have a new passion.
LEADMALE:I want you to see the poster I'm going to hang in my room.
SUPMALE:Oh, teen idols sure have changed.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it amazing? It's the human body.
SUPMALE:Thank God for skin.
LEADMALE:What is this for, honey? Oh, I'm taking an evening course in Shiatsu massage at school.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it's a special this week at Grant.
OTHERFEMALE:If you take Shiatsu, you can drop history, English and math.
LEADMALE:What's Shiatsu? Shiatsu is a process of pressing certain nerve points and releasing tension, thus allowing bodily energies to flow freely.
SUPFEMALE:Just don't get them all over the floor.
LEADFEMALE:You see, the human body is divided up into meridians, which correspond with each organ and muscle group.
LEADMALE:For instance, the foot alone contains the pressure points that affect every one of the major organs.
OTHERFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADMALE:Let me see that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darn.
LEADMALE:Think I just stubbed my kidney.
LEADMALE:It's amazing how it works.
SUPMALE:Here, let me show you, Alex.
LEADMALE:Oh, I can see it now.
LEADFEMALE:"Alex Keaton killed by Vulcan nerve pinch.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, no, this can't be.
LEADFEMALE:What is it, Mom? Well, it says here that on the corner of Oak and Clinton, they're considering building another mini-mall.
SUPMALE:What? When? God, look at that she's got escalators in her eyes.
OTHERFEMALE:Oak and Clinton? Isn't that where your Cavanaugh Building is? Yes, it is.
LEADMALE:Now it says they're gonna tear it down and put up another one of those obnoxious mini-malls.
SUPMALE:Mother.
OTHERMALE:Oh, please, Mallory.
SUPMALE:The last thing that neighborhood needs is another bunch of silly stores.
SUPMALE:There are no silly stores.
LEADMALE:There are only silly shoppers.
SUPMALE:Look, Mallory, I have nothing against malls per se.
OTHERMALE:It's just the Cavanaugh Building is very special to me.
SUPFEMALE:It's the first building I ever designed.
SUPFEMALE:And, boy, well, you never forget your first building.
LEADFEMALE:Are they gonna tear it down? Well, it sure seems like it.
LEADMALE:Well, look at the bright side, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:At least it didn't fall down on its own.
SUPMALE:Look, Alex, I don't expect you to understand my feelings about this.
LEADMALE:But this is not just a building.
LEADFEMALE:This is part of our family history.
OTHERFEMALE:Gosh, you-you were only two years old.
SUPMALE:Mallory was just born.
LEADFEMALE:It was a very special time.
LEADMALE:Elyse to everything turn, turn, turn there is a season.
LEADFEMALE:Turn, turn, turn.
OTHERMALE:And a time to every - Oh, shut up.
OTHERMALE:The whole point of Shiatsu is to help you relax so you can realize your fullest potential.
LEADMALE:Okay, now we're gonna work on your spinal meridian, and align your cervical vertebrae.
LEADMALE:The square root of 1,595 equals 39.
LEADFEMALE:93745.
LEADMALE:I can't believe that came out of him.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe he had it in him in the first place.
LEADMALE:Doesn't that feel great, Nick? You see, I cleared a path for energy to flow right to your brain.
OTHERFEMALE:That must've been quite some blockage there, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, look at you you're a ball of tension.
LEADFEMALE:Hey - Here, let me work on you.
SUPMALE:Get away from me, okay? I know the square root of 1,595.
SUPMALE:Look at your posture.
LEADMALE:Alex, don't hunch.
LEADMALE:Lower your shoulders.
SUPFEMALE:Ah No, lower.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, lower.
LEADMALE:Ma Mal, if they were any lower, I could use them as hips.
LEADMALE:Alex, you need an adjustment.
LEADMALE:So do you, Mal.
LEADMALE:Only yours would require a few thousand volts of electricity.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, come on, I'm getting better at this.
LEADFEMALE:Just let me do it.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, okay just to humor you.
OTHERMALE:Go ahead, Subaru me.
OTHERFEMALE:Shiatsu.
LEADFEMALE:God bless you.
LEADFEMALE:All right, okay.
LEADMALE:Okay What the hell was that? See? Don't you feel more relaxed? Mal, I I I can't straighten up, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Oops.
OTHERMALE:Oops? Hey, hey, hey, hey, come here, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:I'll fix you up, huh? No, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'll straighten myself up, okay? There, I feel fabulous.
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:Who's next? No, thank you, Mal.
LEADMALE:I had Shiatsu for lunch.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Dad, how about you? How about a little Shiatsu? Um Well, Mal, I, um Oh, come on, Dad, look what it did for Nick.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, I'll pass.
SUPMALE:Oh, good, you're all here.
LEADMALE:Take a look at this I want to show you something adorable.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, baby pictures.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mom, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Nick's here.
OTHERMALE:Mom, I know how precious I was Kids, kids.
SUPMALE:If your mom wants to pour over pictures of her children, let her.
LEADMALE:It's part of being the loving, nurturing and devoted mom that she is.
LEADMALE:Elyse, these are pictures of buildings.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't they cute? Look, this is the Cavanaugh Building when it was only one week old.
LEADFEMALE:That's the Cavanaugh Building during its first summer.
LEADMALE:Isn't it having fun? Here it is at the circus, eating cotton candy.
SUPMALE:Mom, how far along is this plan to build the mall? Well, it seems to be in the formative stages.
LEADFEMALE:They still have to get the permit and the approval of the zoning board.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute, if they haven't got the permits yet, it means there's still a chance to fight this thing.
LEADMALE:You know, back in the '60s - Oh, back in the '60s - Oh, Dad, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Back in the '60s, by now, we'd be all organized to stage a protest.
LEADFEMALE:We'd make the zoning board listen to the people of this community instead of the money-grubbing, blood-sucking real estate profiteers who want to ravage our city streets just to turn a fast buck.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, do I talk like that about your friends? Elyse, we can't let them push us around.
LEADFEMALE:After all, who needs another mini-mall? Dad, do I talk that way about your friends? Okay, everybody, are you in? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hey, for you, Mom.
OTHERMALE:It's my baby.
LEADMALE:My beautiful baby.
LEADMALE:Elyse, please.
LEADMALE:Your hurting the children's feelings.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, you guys, too.
LEADMALE:Oh, here.
OTHERMALE:Come here, look, all of you, look, look, right here.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this brick, huh, huh? It's a honey, Mom, real brickish.
LEADFEMALE:No, you have to look closer.
LEADFEMALE:There's something scratched on it.
LEADMALE:Oh, "To Steven, Alex and Mallory with love, Elyse, 1970.
SUPFEMALE:" What about me and Jen, Mom? Well, you two hadn't been born yet.
LEADFEMALE:You have a chisel on you, Mom? Hey, wait a minute, there's more.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, "I dedicate this building "to you, my loving family.
SUPMALE:May its structure be as strong and as sound" Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Brick inspector.
SUPFEMALE:How are you? These are fine.
OTHERMALE:These are good.
SUPMALE:Solid, nice tone.
LEADFEMALE:Back to work.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:How can they put a mini-mall in here? It'd just be so wrong to tear this building down.
LEADFEMALE:There's still people working in there, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm assuming they'll be asked to leave before the ball goes crashing through the wall.
LEADMALE:It's not going to come crashing through the wall.
LEADMALE:We're going to save this building, right, guys? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry I'm late, you guys, but I was picketing in front of the wrong building.
LEADMALE:But you'll be happy to know they are not going to knock down Sisters of Mercy Hospital.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Nick.
LEADMALE:Hey, buddy, how you doing? - Come on.
LEADMALE:Let's get picketing.
LEADMALE:Let's get a chant going.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, why don't you kick it off, and if it's not too embarrassing, we'll all join in.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, all right.
LEADFEMALE:How about, uh, "Cavanaugh yes, mall no"? No, I can't say that, Dad.
LEADMALE:Well, do what you can, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, uh, did you want to help save the Cavanaugh Building? Actually, I'm here to knock down the Cavanaugh Building.
SUPFEMALE:Dave McPhee, McPhee Brothers Demolition.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? I'm the architect of this building.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, the architect.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen, what do you think's the best way to level this baby in a hurry? Hey, look, you're not gonna level anything.
LEADFEMALE:The demolition permits haven't been issued yet.
LEADMALE:Here you are.
LEADFEMALE:I just want you to know my family and I are gonna fight you every inch of the way on this.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't tell me.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, Dad, take it easy.
LEADMALE:You know, this guy could blow us to bits.
SUPFEMALE:If you got a problem, I'd hurry up - and take care of it.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you bet we will.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you, we're gonna be out here every day - until we win this thing.
OTHERFEMALE:I understand.
LEADMALE:Oh, if you picket on Friday, I'd leave a little more space between you for the, uh, wrecking ball to swing through.
LEADMALE:Come on, guys, let's do it.
LEADFEMALE:Cavanaugh yes, mall no.
SUPFEMALE:Cavanaugh yes, mall no.
LEADMALE:Cavanaugh yes, mall no.
SUPMALE:Alex, go ahead and laugh if you want.
LEADFEMALE:We are on a higher psychic plain than you are.
LEADFEMALE:Our yin is in perfect alignment with our yang.
LEADFEMALE:Can you say that? Our yin is in perfect alignment with our yang.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look out or I'll step on your liver meridians.
LEADMALE:Alex, come on, give me one more chance to fix you.
LEADMALE:Fix me? You know I was just offered the lead in the new production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame? Come on, Alex, I probably just overstimulated your pancreas.
LEADMALE:Let me have a look.
LEADMALE:Get away from my pancreas.
SUPFEMALE:It's the only thing I got left that works.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you're being Look, your legs are working.
LEADMALE:You're being ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:Keep your hands in your pockets, Mallory! What are we doing? We're basking in the afterglow.
LEADFEMALE:Of what? Of Shiatsu.
SUPMALE:I didn't have any.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you can just enjoy being here with me.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll get up now.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, you guys, help me hold him down so I can realign his vertebrae! You will not be happy until I'm one large knot! No, Alex, you're being ridiculous.
LEADMALE:Now, just lay down, and everything will be fine! - Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know that every day, when I go to work, I drive two and a half miles out of my way just to go by the Cavanaugh Building? I cannot believe that one day it will not be there anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Try to look on the bright side, Elyse.
LEADMALE:No matter what, it will live on in our memories.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven, it's not the same.
LEADMALE:How would you feel if someone wanted to destroy your first documentary? Well, it's not like it hasn't been suggested.
LEADFEMALE:What's the use of worrying about it? It's done, hmm? Might as well just put it out of my mind.
LEADMALE:Next time I go to work, I'll just drive by the mini-mall, wave hi to Mallory and go on my way.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Don't be so negative, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:There must be something we can do.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, I'm trying to convince your mother that the Cavanaugh Building can be saved.
LEADFEMALE:She thinks it's hopeless.
OTHERFEMALE:Help me out here.
SUPMALE:It's hopeless, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Look, there are certain fiscal realities here, okay? I mean, a guy owns a building, he can do whatever he wants with it regardless of other people's feelings.
SUPMALE:I mean, that's the beauty of capitalism.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what makes this country such a delight for the wealthy.
LEADMALE:Thanks for dropping by, son.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Alex, Alex, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:You just made me realize that there is hope.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you must have completely misunderstood everything I said.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:You said that the owner can do anything he wants.
LEADMALE:All I have to do is confront that owner on a professional basis.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I will appeal to his his aesthetic sense, his his spirit of civic pride, his desire to be a responsible member of the Columbus business community.
SUPMALE:And then and then I will convince him that there's more to life than making money.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get the old wrecking ball warmed up.
LEADMALE:Yes, Miss Clark.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Willis, there's an Elyse Keaton out here.
LEADMALE:She says she was the architect on the Cavanaugh Building and she wants to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her I'm not here.
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Willis, I realize you're not in, but I would like to see you.
LEADMALE:Get rid of her.
LEADMALE:Ms.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton! Oh, Ms.
LEADMALE:Keaton! Pleasure to see you.
LEADMALE:Look, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Willis, we both know why I'm here, so let's dispense with the niceties, okay? I'll put my cards on the table.
LEADFEMALE:I do not want my building destroyed, but I'm willing to compromise.
LEADMALE:You're willing to compromise? - Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:What a break for me.
LEADMALE:That's why I have designed the Cavanaugh Consumer Complex.
SUPFEMALE:Now, in the grandest tradition of urban rehabilitation, we preserve the external structure while inside inside, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Willis, is the mini-mall of your dreams.
OTHERMALE:Thus we maintain the stylistic integrity and the historical essence of the neighborhood while profitable enterprise takes place within.
LEADMALE:Now, I hope you like my idea, Mr.
LEADMALE:Willis.
OTHERMALE:It's my final offer.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, that means I won't have to hear another one.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, how about this? The world's first helium-filled mini-mall.
LEADMALE:It it hovers directly over the Cavanaugh Building, it's collapsible on the holidays, and it's the first mall that could be entered in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, huh? What do you think? I think you're a lunatic.
LEADMALE:Ms.
LEADMALE:Keaton, it's a simple matter of dollars and cents.
OTHERMALE:I own the building.
LEADFEMALE:If I tear it down and build a mini-mall, I'll make a lot of money.
SUPMALE:But tearing down a beautiful building to put up just another mini-mall Just another mini-mall? The Dayton Stop and Grab, my first mini-mall.
LEADMALE:My baby.
SUPFEMALE:It's a landmark in the mini-mall world.
SUPMALE:So, how would you feel if someone tore it down? Already did.
LEADMALE:To put up the Dayton Park and Pick.
SUPMALE:Well, the Dayton Park and Pick looks just like the Stop and Snatch.
SUPMALE:That's the Stop and Grab.
LEADMALE:That's the Stop and Snatch in Steubenville.
LEADFEMALE:How can you tell? They all look just alike.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I find that very comforting.
SUPMALE:Personally, I don't know how you can put these things up all the way across the country without some sense of self-loathing.
LEADFEMALE:Come again? Architecturally, they they are a real blight on the landscape.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you are turning America from Maine to California into one huge mini-mall.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't that bother you? Only if I don't build them.
SUPFEMALE:I love the certainty and security mini-malls provide.
SUPMALE:I love knowing any time, day or night, that I can get film developed, rent a video or get a Slurpee.
SUPMALE:Can you do that at the Cavanaugh Building? Oh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Willis, the Cavanaugh isn't just a building.
LEADFEMALE:It's-it's it's like a family.
LEADFEMALE:Look, how would you feel if someone came in here and destroyed this beautiful picture of your family, huh? That's not my family.
OTHERMALE:What, they came with the frame? No, I didn't like the family that came with the frame.
OTHERFEMALE:I had to buy another frame to get these people.
LEADFEMALE:Look, uh, I cannot begin to tell you what to do with your building.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I just thought you should understand that someone sweated and-and anguished and lost sleep trying to create this building.
LEADMALE:Uh, please save this building.
LEADFEMALE:This is the embodiment of my dreams.
LEADMALE:Help me, Mr.
LEADMALE:Willis.
SUPMALE:Save the Cavanaugh Building.
LEADMALE:Believe me, deep down, I just know you understand what I'm talking about.
LEADMALE:Did you ever get an itch in the back of your head that you just couldn't quite reach? You okay? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Just thinking about other things we could have done, but it's too late now.
LEADFEMALE:We did all we could.
OTHERMALE:We did everything but chain ourselves to the building.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, now you think of it.
LEADMALE:Elyse, look at it this way.
SUPFEMALE:You have all these other buildings.
SUPMALE:You know, I remember when I designed the Cavanaugh Building.
LEADMALE:I was so naive.
LEADMALE:You know, I think I only gave them one proposal.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't believe that they'd want to see anything else.
SUPFEMALE:They didn't.
LEADFEMALE:When they gave me the go-ahead, I I was so excited, I just screamed, and I hugged Mr.
LEADMALE:Cavanaugh so hard, his monocle popped off.
LEADMALE:I remember that day.
SUPFEMALE:I was home with Alex and Mallory in that little apartment - we had on Rosewood Avenue.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:You came through the door with such a gleam in your eye.
SUPFEMALE:The only other time I had seen that look was when you thought you'd spotted Bob Dylan at the International House of Pancakes.
LEADFEMALE:Was that 20 years ago? Seems like yesterday.
LEADMALE:Also seems just like a thousand years ago.
SUPMALE:When did it all go so fast? I know what you mean.
LEADMALE:Who would have ever thought we'd be sitting here in 1989, house of our own, five children? Four.
LEADFEMALE:Right, four children.
SUPFEMALE:Nice jobs, money in the bank, two good cars.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:God, we're square.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you are.
SUPFEMALE:You know, the worst part is that I feel I worked so hard, you know? I I-I've tried to make my mark in the world to create something that said "Elyse Keaton was here.
OTHERMALE:" Then they're gonna tear it down.
LEADFEMALE:Seems like pretty soon, there's not gonna be any record of who I used to be.
LEADFEMALE:I'll remember.
LEADMALE:I look at you, and I still see that same wild-eyed young woman who ran into that apartment with the news of her first building.
SUPFEMALE:And then then I see the 19-year-old girl I fell in love with.
SUPMALE:Then the young woman who gave birth to our beautiful children.
SUPFEMALE:And then more mature, older, wiser.
SUPMALE:Older.
LEADMALE:Uh, watch it, buster.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, you are all these people to your family, and we don't need any buildings to remind us of that.
SUPFEMALE:You have made your mark here.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I have a present for you.
LEADMALE:What? - What is it? - I'll give you a hint.
LEADFEMALE:It's from your building.
LEADMALE:A a brick! - How'd you know? - Oh! 'Cause I wanted one so badly.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:I love it.
OTHERFEMALE:All those birthdays, I've been running out and wasting money on perfume.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, we found the brick with the writing on it.
OTHERMALE:"I dedicate this to you, my loving family.
OTHERMALE:" Thank you so much.
SUPMALE:Oh, Cavanaugh Building's demolished, huh? I'm sorry, Mom.
LEADMALE:I will never shop at that mall.
LEADFEMALE:Ever, ever, ever! Honey, I-I think that's really too great a sacrifice to ask you to make.
LEADMALE:I'm not setting foot there.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, take it easy, Mal.
LEADMALE:You're going to become a a mall martyr.
LEADMALE:I want to thank you so much for trying to help me.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:You guys were great.
OTHERFEMALE:I I never dreamed we'd all be picketing together.
LEADMALE:On on the same side, that that is.
LEADMALE:Mom, you've been through a lot.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure you're tremendously tense.
SUPMALE:Let me Shiatsu you.
LEADFEMALE:No, no! Mom, don't! 
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Notice anything different about me? - Not a thing.
SUPMALE:Hair's a little different? I'll give you a 
LEADFEMALE:It happens when you're 16, and once it happens, you're never the same again.
LEADMALE:Jennifer! - What?! - No! Yes, yes.
LEADMALE:I got my learner's permit.
OTHERFEMALE: Okay.
LEADFEMALE:That's a relief, and I don't even know why.
LEADFEMALE:Jen, you must be so excited! Getting your learner's permit is a big event.
LEADFEMALE:And you've got something else to get excited 
SUPFEMALE:Driving lessons with your good old dad.
OTHERMALE:Boy, "excited" is such a subjective term.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Dad, I really appreciate that you want to teach me to drive, and it means a lot to me, but I've been thinking of the lessons you gave Alex and Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Yeah, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Those were great lessons.
LEADMALE:They could drive through hell if they had to.
LEADMALE:And in a sense, we did.
OTHERMALE:Dad, I want Mom to teach me to drive.
LEADFEMALE: Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, no, that's, uh that's fine, Jen.
SUPMALE:Just, uh, just fine.
LEADMALE:No, your mother will be a a wonderful teacher.
SUPMALE:If you want to learn to drive that way.
LEADMALE:What way is that? 
LEADMALE:Well You know.
LEADMALE:You mean like a woman? Well yeah, you have to admit that you rarely see a-a man, uh, stopped at a light fumbling through his little purse or  brushing his hair in the mirror.
LEADMALE: Uh, putting on eyeliner during a lane change.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, boys.
SUPMALE:Steven, I know I can teach Jen to drive better than you ever could.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really, Elyse? Oh, really, Steven.
LEADMALE:Not if I hide the keys, you can't.
LEADFEMALE:Steven!  This is gonna be hard the learner's permit says there has to be at least one adult in the car.
LEADFEMALE: - Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:You ready to go? Yes, I am, my little psychoanalytical cupcake.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to the movies, Mal.
LEADMALE:You want to come? Oh, you guys, don't leave me now.
SUPMALE:Skippy's on his way over.
SUPFEMALE:He has a new girlfriend; he wants to introduce her to us.
SUPMALE:That's great! When did this happen? How did this happen? I don't know, but this could be just what Skippy needs.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he hasn't dated since Amy transferred to Yale.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't they decide to see other people? Well, yeah, but Skippy didn't know what that meant.
SUPMALE:So, for months, he just walked around looking at other people.
LEADFEMALE:Hi! Hey, Skip, buddy, come on in.
SUPMALE:Uh, I'd like you all to meet someone special.
LEADFEMALE:This is Darlene.
LEADFEMALE:Darlene, this is Alex, Lauren and Mallory.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Darlene.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, how are you? - Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey, why don't we sit down and get better acquainted.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, uh Well -  -  Um, so, have you two known each other long? - Yes.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Um, we just met this morning.
LEADFEMALE:So this is your first date? Oh, no.
SUPMALE:This isn't a date; we're lab partners.
SUPFEMALE:As soon as I met him, he asked me to come home and meet his neighbors, which is weird enough.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, but I said yes because he begged me, and I have real trouble saying no.
SUPMALE:Will you marry me? Not that much trouble.
SUPMALE:Um, look, I hope you won't mind if I see myself out.
SUPFEMALE:I won't.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I-I don't suppose this engagement ring is gonna change your mind? Oh, there must be something we can do.
LEADMALE:I mean, he's such a sweet, lovable guy.
LEADMALE:There's got to be someone out there for him.
LEADMALE:There's not; I looked.
LEADMALE:That little vixen.
OTHERFEMALE:She's playing hard-to-get.
SUPMALE:No, she's not.
LEADMALE:Who am I kidding? She hates me.
SUPMALE:They all hate me.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, come on.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
LEADFEMALE:Then how come last week I asked Lisa Tobin if she wanted to go to the movies with me, and her head spun around a full 360 degrees? Well, she's had the flu, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, look, the odds are always huge against meeting the right person, but somehow it happens.
LEADMALE:Yeah, look.
LEADMALE:Look at Lauren.
LEADMALE:She wanted the best and, you know, darn it, she got it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sure, Alex, you've never had problems with women, but all the women I meet reject me.
LEADFEMALE:Even the women I don't meet reject me.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Skippy, I think maybe I can help you.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come to my lab at school, and I'll assess your psychological profile.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, maybe we can find out what type of female you're compatible with.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care if she's compatible, as long as she's human.
SUPFEMALE:All right, pal, one time around the maze, then lunch.
LEADMALE:Come on, it's easy.
LEADFEMALE:You can do it.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:Just a little further.
LEADMALE:Okay, now find the cheese.
SUPMALE:I don't know where to start.
SUPMALE: Hi, Skippy.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be done in just a second.
LEADFEMALE:We're trying to find the cheese.
LEADFEMALE:It's right here.
SUPFEMALE:Very good.
SUPMALE:Skippy, are you a little nervous? Uh, uh, well, yes, just a little though.
LEADMALE:Um, I'm not too good with these things.
SUPMALE:Uh, when I was a kid, my parents sent me to a psychologist, and then a week later, he was spotted roller-skating naked through a Woolworth's.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Skippy, I don't skate, and I'm sure this is gonna go fine.
SUPMALE:Just relax.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me a little bit about yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I-I think you're asking the wrong guy.
LEADFEMALE:Um See, I-I'm pretty much a mystery to me.
LEADMALE:Okay, then we'll both discover you at the same time.
LEADMALE:So, Skippy, why don't you tell me a little bit about your past relationships with women.
LEADMALE:Okay, um, well, you know about Amy.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:And before that, there was ooh, let's see, uh nobody.
LEADFEMALE:Mm, unless of course you count Mallory.
LEADMALE:What exactly was the nature of your relationship with Mallory? Somewhere in between close personal friend and dog.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I've got to admit, I was a little nervous about doing this, I mean, because we're friends, and sometimes it's hard to work with people you know real well.
LEADMALE:But I have to tell you, I feel very comfortable talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:I-I feel very comfortable talking to you, too.
SUPMALE:I just wish I could be like this around other women.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you're scared of women.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe-maybe you're scared of relationships.
SUPMALE:Does the word "love" scare you? Well, maybe.
LEADFEMALE:I-I guess it depends on how it's used in a sentence.
OTHERMALE:How so? Well, "I love my mother" is fine.
SUPFEMALE:Um, "We'd love to beat you up and take your bike" worries me.
OTHERFEMALE: Okay, let me rephrase the question.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, does the concept of being in love scare you? Not if I could find the right person.
LEADFEMALE:Well, who's the right person? Uh, someone who listens.
OTHERMALE:Someone who cares.
LEADFEMALE:Someone who makes you feel funny, you know? Like, uh, little sparklers are going off in your stomach.
SUPFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm listening.
OTHERMALE:I guess that's it.
LEADFEMALE:What do you look for in a guy? I-I guess it's just the little things that affect me, you know.
LEADMALE:Someone who's not afraid to show affection.
LEADMALE:You know, a gentle pat or a squeeze of the arm.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:That is delightful.
SUPMALE:Well, enough about me.
OTHERMALE:Let's get back to you.
LEADMALE:What do you look for in a woman? Well, I suppose she's pretty.
SUPFEMALE:What does she look like? Well, she's got long, dark brown, lustrous hair; beautiful pale blue eyes; pink, shell-like ears; and-and cute little orange freckles across the bridge of her nose.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:She sounds like a knockout.
OTHERFEMALE:She is.
LEADFEMALE:So, you ladies prepared for your adventure on wheels? Steven, don't start.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to help.
LEADMALE:I happened upon this Ohio driver's handbook, and I thought I might give you a little quiz.
SUPMALE:Dad, I think we'll be fine on our own.
OTHERFEMALE: Come on.
LEADFEMALE:This will be fun.
SUPFEMALE:Here's one.
SUPFEMALE:"When parking on a hill, which way do you turn your wheels?" Oh, well, okay, that's easy.
OTHERMALE:Um, towards the curb if the car is pointing downhill, away from the curb if the car is pointing uphill.
OTHERMALE:Very good, Elyse.
LEADMALE:That's great, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:You really know your stuff.
LEADFEMALE: Yeah, I'll say.
LEADFEMALE:Let's try another one, shall we? "When making a left turn from a two-lane street "onto a three-lane highway, does the car turning left "onto the street or the car turning right onto the highway have the right of way?" Let-let me think just a minute.
SUPMALE:Quickly, Elyse, there's no time.
OTHERFEMALE:Here comes the tractor-trailer.
LEADMALE:But if-if I were actually on the street - Too late, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:Let's, uh, let's try an easy one.
SUPFEMALE:"At what speed do you require a Class 3 license to tow anhydrous ammonia?" That's impossible.
SUPMALE:I don't know that.
LEADMALE:And you call yourself a driver.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you think you could do better? Yes, I do.
LEADMALE:Okay, big boy, you got it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, Mom, please don't leave.
LEADMALE:No, honey, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I-I cannot take the risk of what might happen on some wild night when you and your girlfriends decide to go out and tow ammonia.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Jen, out to the garage for a few words about tire pressure.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, help.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's taking me to the garage.
SUPFEMALE: I really need to talk, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll get out of your way.
LEADMALE:I-I meant to you.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, okay.
SUPMALE:What? Mallory, I'm having uncontrollable romantic feelings.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I knew it.
LEADMALE:Skippy, stop! You've got to stop pining for me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, sure, you're lonely.
SUPMALE:Yes, I'm desirable.
OTHERFEMALE:But it's got to stop.
OTHERMALE:It's not you.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:That was really embarrassing.
OTHERMALE:Well, sure, I-I felt that way about you, once, but now you're more like a sister to me.
SUPFEMALE:Or even a brother.
LEADMALE:No, no, more like a third cousin on my mom's side Uncle Nestor's boy.
OTHERFEMALE:It's all right, Skippy, I'm over it.
LEADMALE:What's up? I think I'm in love with Lauren.
LEADMALE:Well, that's great.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren who? Lauren of Alex and Lauren.
SUPFEMALE:That Lauren?! Skippy, you crazy? I know.
LEADMALE:I feel so guilty.
SUPMALE:I feel horrible.
LEADFEMALE:You should.
LEADMALE:How can you do this to Alex? - I know.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:There's nothing you can say that I haven't said to myself already.
LEADFEMALE:Have you said this? "I'm a jerk!" I was much tougher on myself.
LEADMALE:It even got physical; twice I had to separate me.
LEADFEMALE:But she's just the only thing on my mind.
LEADMALE:She's the only thing I can think about.
LEADFEMALE:All day and all night, all I say is, "Lauren, Lauren" I-Lord, I'm thirsty.
SUPMALE:Lauren? Skippy, perfect.
SUPFEMALE:You know, we got some great news for you.
OTHERMALE:Tell him, hon.
LEADMALE:All right, I hope you don't mind, but I matched up your profile with some other women I know at school, - and I got you a date.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Alex and I are gonna double with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't this exciting? Skippy! - Hi, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry we're late.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'm in charge of the introductions.
LEADMALE:Alex, this is Pippi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Pippi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Pippi, this is Skippy.
SUPFEMALE:My folks love Pippi Longstocking, so Oh, my folks love peanut butter, so Well, Pippi and Skippy.
OTHERMALE:Well, you two ever get married, your kids could be, uh, Flippy, Snippy and Dippy.
SUPFEMALE: You look beautiful, Lauren.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think Pippi looks terrific? Pippi who? 
LEADMALE:Pippi Longstocking.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, that Pippi! Of course, yes.
LEADFEMALE:You look very nice, very peppy, Pippi.
LEADMALE:Uh, bread, anybody? - Sure, I Hey, now, don't hog it.
LEADMALE:Lauren? No, thank you.
LEADMALE:No? - No.
OTHERFEMALE:Are we ready to hear the specials? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, will you wait just a minute, please? Lauren, are you ready to hear the specials? I think so.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:I-I don't think I'm ready yet.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm ready.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight I have a lovely veal scallopini, a delightful little chicken in a mustard sauce, and, of course, a number of selections from our brand-new fresh seafood cart.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:We have lobster, crab, roughy and scrod on ice, and you can select the exact one that you'd like.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, I'll have the lobster.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I'll have the lobster, too.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, I'm sorry; we only have one lobster left.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you go ahead, Pippi.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's all right, Lauren.
LEADMALE:Uh, Lauren, you get the lobster.
LEADMALE:Pippi, you get the scrod.
SUPMALE:Oh! Come on! - Skippy! Alex? Flip me a flounder, Skip! - I've got to go.
LEADMALE:Oh, you can't go.
SUPMALE:It's flying fish night at Guido's.
OTHERMALE:That's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I've lost my appetite.
SUPMALE:Alex, would you drive her? - Yeah, absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:I feel kind of responsible.
LEADMALE:I was the designated driver anyway.
OTHERMALE:It's funny, I thought I'd be driving someone home 'cause they drank like a fish, not got hit by one.
LEADFEMALE:All right, honey, save me that lobster, all right? -  - See you in a while.
SUPMALE:I had a very nice time, Pippi.
SUPFEMALE:I hope we can do this again.
LEADMALE:I'll bring my snorkel.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I don't want you to blame yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything was going fine until you started throwing fish.
LEADMALE:It's all my fault.
OTHERMALE:I'm a stupid, clumsy oaf! You're also sweet, sensitive and caring.
LEADFEMALE:I know what your problem is.
LEADFEMALE:You just tend to get overly excited around women.
LEADFEMALE:Your senses overload.
OTHERFEMALE:That only happens around certain women.
LEADMALE:Well, then maybe Pippi's still a good bet.
LEADFEMALE:Pippi wasn't the only woman here tonight, Lauren.
LEADFEMALE:That's very sweet, Skippy, but what I meant was that - Not that! - I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't help myself.
SUPFEMALE:Sure felt like you helped yourself.
SUPFEMALE: I'd better go.
LEADMALE: The Keaton driving school is now in session.
SUPMALE:So are some therapy groups I'd like you to visit.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, would you mind if we didn't go out in the car for the first time at night? I mean, it's gonna be hard enough in the daytime.
LEADMALE:Well, who said anything about a car? We are going to simulate a driving lesson right here in the kitchen.
OTHERMALE:Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
SUPFEMALE:Two more chairs, and we have a backseat.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do this; I get carsick.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, everybody in the car.
LEADFEMALE:  Don't slam the door.
OTHERMALE: Everybody buckled up? Okay, here.
SUPFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:Start the car.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Now pull carefully into the street, checking both ways for traffic.
SUPMALE:Stop! -  - What?! You almost hit that bicycle.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer! If you can't drive more carefully, I'm gonna have to get out! Drop me off at the mall! Okay Please, everybody, everybody calm down.
SUPMALE:We're in traffic now.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, watch the road.
LEADMALE:Take a left at the light.
LEADMALE:Where's the light? What light? It's right there! You just ran a red light, young lady.
LEADMALE: Oh, uh-oh, there's a cop behind us.
LEADMALE:Where? Right there.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna try to lose him.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer, no! Floor it, Jen! - Jen! - Hold on! Jen  Jen Oh, no, the drawbridge is up! - I can't look! -   Give me those keys.
LEADMALE: I've had it.
LEADMALE:You teach her.
SUPFEMALE:She's too much of a daredevil for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I quit.
LEADMALE:You can't take the heat, get off the highway.
SUPMALE:This is all my fault.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I did his profile; I should've seen this coming.
SUPFEMALE:What-what-what? What happened? Aw, Skippy flipped out at the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:He tossed a scrod and kissed Lauren on the mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good thing it wasn't the other way around.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's Skippy.
LEADMALE:Do you mind if I talk to him alone? He'd be crushed if he thought you knew.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's all right.
LEADMALE:Hello, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Lauren.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you came over.
SUPFEMALE:I-I think we should talk.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I think so, too.
LEADMALE:And, uh, since I have to catch a plane for the Arctic Circle, I'll go first.
LEADFEMALE:I just want you to know that wasn't me who kissed you in that restaurant tonight.
SUPMALE:That was my evil twin, Bad Irwin.
OTHERFEMALE:Skippy, I think we should talk about what happened at the restaurant tonight.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I-I really am.
LEADMALE:It's just that, uh well, you were so close, and, um I started to have these feelings.
SUPMALE:What feelings? That I loved you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Skippy, you don't really love me.
LEADMALE:You just have this need to be loved by someone, and you transferred that need to me.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with me? I make a complete fool out of myself every time a girl is nice to me.
LEADMALE:Fortunately, it doesn't happen that often.
LEADFEMALE:Skippy, when we were alone at the lab, you were charming and relaxed and funny, and I liked you.
SUPFEMALE:And someone else will, too.
SUPMALE:If you can be that way around me, you can be that way around anyone.
LEADMALE:Do you think so? All you got to do is be yourself.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I'll give it one more year, but then I'm gonna be someone else.
LEADMALE:Well, now there's just one more thing I have to do, which is, um talk to Alex.
OTHERMALE:Alex? Yes? I think I'll leave you two guys alone.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Alex, there's something I have to tell you.
LEADMALE:I, uh, fell in love with Lauren.
SUPMALE:But, uh, we talked it over, and I'm getting over it, and this will in no way affect you two or your happiness.
OTHERMALE:You fell in love with Lauren? Whoa.
LEADMALE:Whoa, Skippy, this is, uh this is a shocker.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, uh I'm not sure exactly what to say.
LEADFEMALE: I mean, it's a pretty painful It's a pretty painful thing to spring on a fella.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm just gonna need some time to absorb it and get over it.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm over it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Skip, hey, don't worry, 'cause somewhere out there is a wonderful girl for you.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone keeps telling me this! Where the hell is she? Hi Oh, no!
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what are you working on? Oh, I'm writing a play for my history class.
SUPFEMALE:It's about the final days of Richard Nixon's presidency.
SUPMALE:Oh, a comedy.
LEADMALE:Well, it's got a little bit of everything, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:You'll laugh, you'll cry.
LEADFEMALE:I call it "Ain't Misbehavin' All Right, Maybe I Am.
SUPFEMALE:" - Oh.
LEADMALE:Wait, listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:From the discussions I have had with congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter Dick! Dick, you've finally come for me! Dick? Alex, pull yourself together.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a tape.
SUPFEMALE:I'm writing a play of of the day Nixon resigned.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Jen, that is great.
LEADMALE:That is great.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize that you are writing a play about the greatest president this country has ever known? Wait a minute, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You've always said that Ronald Reagan was the greatest president.
LEADFEMALE:I heard you say that, too, Alex.
SUPMALE:Which is it, Nixon or Reagan? Ooh, boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Whew.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Nixon has a better body.
SUPMALE:Why isn't Mallory home yet? Ah, who cares? More oxygen for us.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:She's probably still out with Nick.
LEADFEMALE:She knows I need the car by 4:00.
LEADFEMALE:You'd think between the two of them, they could tell time.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, maybe if Nick takes the big hand and Mallory takes the little hand Nah.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Young lady, do you have any idea what time it is? Well, no.
SUPFEMALE:Nick, do you? Um Just glad Darwin isn't alive to see this.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't I tell you to get the car back by 4:00? I've got something very important to do today.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:We tried, but the Artists' Alliance for Peace meeting ran a little late.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I want peace as much as the next guy, but I've got to get a new pair of galoshes.
LEADMALE:Dad, this is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:There are too many drivers in the house and not enough cars.
SUPFEMALE:It's true, Dad.
OTHERMALE:In a few months, I'm going to be driving, and I'm going to need a car, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and on Wednesday, August 11, 2003, I'm gonna need the car to take Marion Davis to the movies.
LEADFEMALE:She said she'd consider going out with me sometime next century.
SUPMALE:Dad, you know, I've been saving up, and I think I have enough for a really fun car.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, and you may remember my dad runs the biggest and most often sued used car lot in the Midwest.
LEADMALE:Well, I think it's a good idea.
LEADMALE:We could definitely use another car.
OTHERFEMALE:Definitely.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Then Nick and I will go down to the showroom - and pick something out.
LEADFEMALE:Now, wait.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:I better go with you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's very easy to get swindled in one of those places.
OTHERMALE:Dad, it's Nick's dad.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:All the more reason.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Bill will take care of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Congratulations on your vehicle.
LEADMALE:Hey Hey! - Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Ho.
LEADFEMALE:Um, Joe, do you remember my dad, Steven Keaton? Oh, yes, yes.
SUPMALE:Very nice to resume our relationship.
SUPMALE:Always a pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, um, Dad, Mal's here to buy a car.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, la la.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you came to the right place.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, I like that one.
LEADMALE:No, no, honey.
LEADMALE:The only thing that works in that is the glove compartment.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, hey, we don't want to waste your time too much.
SUPFEMALE:We'll, uh, get down to business.
SUPFEMALE:Well, well, well, well, what business? Whoa, whoa, take it easy.
OTHERMALE:Come on, let's schmooze a little bit.
SUPMALE:You're family.
OTHERMALE:Well, inasmuch as we're both in the family of man.
LEADMALE:Steven, what I am trying to tell you is that you can never waste my time.
LEADFEMALE:Now, come on, sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:What's been going on in your life? - Well, uh, I'm still - I got just the car for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is, uh yeah, I like this.
SUPMALE:This looks like a very sturdy vehicle.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, it looks like something that broke off a glacier.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I think this looks nice.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I like that one.
LEADMALE:That cute little Karmann Ghia.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mal, Mal, come on, I don't know about that.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure this care is safe? Safe? I can assure you that it's safe.
LEADFEMALE:I personally use it to drive back and forth to the small claims court.
LEADFEMALE:Which is a lot of round trips.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm crazy about it.
LEADMALE:How much is it? Mal, Mal, God You got to play these things cool.
SUPFEMALE:She's crazy about it.
SUPFEMALE:How much is it? For you? $3,500.
SUPMALE:Isn't that a little high? Okay, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Tell you what I'm going to do.
SUPMALE:I'm going to give you this beauty for $3,000 even.
LEADMALE:I've never done this before.
OTHERMALE:I'm doing this only because I love you.
SUPMALE:I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:$2,500.
LEADFEMALE:I love you slightly less.
LEADFEMALE:A deal.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, it's yours for $2,500.
OTHERMALE:Dad, that's way out of my range.
SUPFEMALE:No problem, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:Go to a bank and partake of a loan.
SUPFEMALE:No, I would never qualify.
OTHERMALE:No, we just better look for something else.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how it would make you feel if I were to cosign for the loan? Really? You are the best daddy in the whole wide world.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great! You are the best daddy in the whole wide world.
SUPMALE:I'm not cosigning nothing for you.
LEADMALE:Boo.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I don't want your help.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Jen, I just I just came by to see if you needed any more source material.
SUPFEMALE:No, thank you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I have The Final Days by Woodward and Bernstein, I have manuscripts of the Watergate hearings, and I have several back copies of the Washington Post.
LEADMALE:Well, that's, uh That's great, Jen.
SUPMALE:But I have a much more reliable publication.
LEADFEMALE:Nixie.
LEADMALE:The official magazine of the Richard Nixon Fan Club, of which I have been a charter member since 1967.
LEADMALE:You've been the only member since 1967.
OTHERMALE:Oh, God, who would want to see him in a swimsuit? With the nose clips.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jen? Turn the page.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, he looks great on the bearskin rug.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Where have you guys been? - 
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:At the mall.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, went to the auto accessories store.
OTHERMALE:You should see all the great stuff I got.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
OTHERFEMALE:"Shopaholic on board.
SUPMALE:" And for our driving comfort, sheepskin seat covers.
LEADFEMALE:And matching pants.
SUPMALE:And, for complete cosmetic care on the road, a visor mirror that just happens to be full length.
SUPFEMALE:That's great, Mal.
LEADMALE:You look in that while you're driving, you'll be the prettiest girl at the three-car pile-up.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I so appreciate you doing this for me.
LEADMALE:I love you.
OTHERMALE:Aw Mal, these are the kinds of moments a father lives for.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I love you, too.
LEADMALE:The moment is over, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Ho.
SUPMALE:Huh? Good news, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Everything has been approved for your car loan.
LEADMALE:Here are the pertinent documents.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, perhaps we should look these over, honey? Yeah, you're right.
SUPMALE:You better look them over.
LEADMALE:As a matter of fact, I better look them over here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, what was I thinking here? I can't do this to somebody I know.
LEADFEMALE:I can't do this to somebody I don't know.
SUPMALE:See this? - I can go to jail for this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I've gone to jail for this.
SUPFEMALE:This is a travesty.
LEADMALE:Very difficult.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:A pure document.
OTHERMALE:All that is required is your signatures, and the vehicle will be yours.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory? Steven, your plume.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Nick, this is so exciting.
LEADFEMALE:We'll finally get to take that trip we've been dreaming about.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Enjoy yourselves.
OTHERMALE:What-what trip? Oh, Dad, I've got this all planned out.
SUPMALE:This spring break, Nick and I are going to drive around the country.
LEADMALE:We are going to see the U.
OTHERFEMALE:S.
OTHERMALE:Of A.
LEADMALE:And after that, we're going to head south of the border, straight into Rhode Island.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm not so sure I'm happy with this idea.
SUPMALE:Eh, why don't we just sign the papers, and we'll chat about travel plans later? Mal Mallory, I don't want you gallivanting all over the country.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:We are not gonna gallivant.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna drive.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Stevie boy, I hear you've got one humdinger of a signature.
LEADMALE:How about a demonstration of same? No.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, what's the problem? Sign the paper.
LEADMALE:I don't want to.
LEADMALE:Why not? I don't want you to go on this trip.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? I can do whatever I want.
SUPFEMALE:I'm 20 years old! Oh, yeah? Well, I'm 40 years old! Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, you must be familiar with your husband's signature.
LEADMALE:"And so, on his last day in office, "Nixon stood and addressed the White House staff.
SUPMALE:"And so, friends, we leave with high hopes, "with deep humility and eight settings of the good White House china.
LEADFEMALE:" "Nixon turns to the helicopter, bumps into Gerald Ford and says, 'Pardon me, if you know what I mean.
LEADFEMALE:"' Jennifer, how could you? And with him sitting here the whole time.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:President.
SUPFEMALE:Go upstairs, and I'll tell you all the bad things that Jennifer's been accused of.
SUPMALE:And we won't pardon her.
LEADMALE:So, uh Have you seen Mallory around recently? Well, she still lives here.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't know.
LEADFEMALE:She's not talking to me anymore.
SUPMALE:Well, Steven, you disappointed her.
LEADFEMALE:You said you'd cosign for the loan, and then you changed your mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sure, make me the heavy.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:When we were 19, didn't we drive from Berkeley to Washington, DC - over Christmas vacation? - That's right.
SUPMALE:We did.
SUPFEMALE:And it practically drove your father insane.
LEADMALE:I know, but wasn't it worth it? Don't you remember what it was like out under the stars? The two of us in that, uh tattered old sleeping bag.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:Mm-hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Your father was right.
LEADMALE:I take it back.
LEADFEMALE:I take it all back.
OTHERMALE:We were bad, bad kids.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
OTHERMALE:Oh, oh, I-I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:Um Uh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton, we are giving you the silent treatment.
OTHERFEMALE:Which means I am not at liberty to talk with you at the moment, though, in the very near future, I'm sure we can chat like we used to.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, maybe we could discuss When does your silent treatment begin, Nick? Because I'm really looking forward to it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:It's on right now.
SUPMALE:Perhaps you didn't follow me.
SUPFEMALE:Hush.
LEADFEMALE:You're not supposed to talk.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:You see, I can talk with you, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, if I was to talk with Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton there would be no point.
OTHERMALE:Nick, honey, let's go upstairs.
LEADMALE:We still have to plan our vacation.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:We don't have to plan.
LEADMALE:It's just gonna be you and me sleeping in our bags under the stars.
LEADMALE:You are bad, bad kids.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, you don't know what you're getting into with this trip.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know anything about cars.
LEADMALE:It can be very dangerous, you know.
SUPMALE:You know, if you recharge the battery the wrong way, you can blow up the car.
SUPMALE:How do you know? - He's done it.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Dad, Nick and I are gonna go down to Nick's dad's place, and we're gonna find something that I can afford.
LEADMALE:And we're gonna make this trip.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all I have to say.
LEADMALE:Joe, Joe, I want to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Steven, always good to see you.
SUPMALE:Let me get the papers, you'll sign them, and then we'll split a bag of pork rinds.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Joe I didn't come to sign.
LEADFEMALE:Then no pork rinds.
LEADFEMALE:Joe, I need your help.
SUPFEMALE:Man to man father to father.
OTHERFEMALE:Which is it, Steve? Joe, the kids are coming down here to buy a car, and I don't want you to sell it to them.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Steven, you don't seem to have a firm grasp of what I do here.
LEADMALE:Joe I don't think Nick and Mallory should go on this cross-country trip.
LEADMALE:I'm worried about the kids.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:I understand you.
SUPFEMALE:I understand you because we're both fathers.
OTHERFEMALE:And in a way, that bonds me and you even stronger than a wedding vow.
LEADFEMALE:That's lovely, Joe.
LEADMALE:A little scary.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but lovely nonetheless.
LEADMALE:I know, I know.
LEADMALE:I haven't done a a terrific job of, uh, controlling Nick because I haven't had a chance to be with him.
SUPFEMALE:Because I abandoned him.
OTHERFEMALE:No, but a daughter is different.
LEADFEMALE:If Nick were Nicotina, I wouldn't let him do half of the stuff that he does.
LEADMALE:What does he do? - I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:What does he do? I never see him.
LEADMALE:Joe, look, the kids don't have enough money to go anyplace else.
LEADMALE:They're coming here, so I'm asking you not to sell them a car.
LEADMALE:What am I supposed to tell them when they walk into this glorious showroom and they see all these automobiles? Joe, I'm gonna ask you to do something that's gonna be very hard for you to do.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to lie.
LEADFEMALE:Lie? Happily.
LEADFEMALE:Thought you were gonna ask me to give blood or something.
LEADMALE:Ooh - Hey, son.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Joe.
SUPFEMALE:Um, I'm sorry the first car didn't work out, but we'd like to look at something, um, less expensive.
SUPMALE:You know, I-I been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see what you need with a car.
SUPMALE:All the problems and the responsibilities, the expenses, car insurance.
SUPFEMALE:A car is a big pain in the butt.
LEADMALE:I'm talking to them.
LEADFEMALE:They're young and attractive.
LEADFEMALE:They can get around.
SUPMALE:Who's gonna take you anywhere? Dad, we got $1,500.
SUPMALE:This is a quality establishment.
LEADFEMALE:We don't have anything for $1,500.
LEADMALE:Well, what about this car here? It says $1,300 on the sticker.
LEADMALE:It's $1,300 a week.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, well, Joe, that-that just about, uh, wraps up the research on my new documentary, um We Never Get to Look Out the Window.
SUPMALE:Dad, what are you doing here? Well, I You came down here to talk Joe out of selling me a car, didn't you? He did nothing of the kind.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I did.
LEADFEMALE:You're a very hard guy to get a fix on.
LEADMALE:I understand your position now.
SUPFEMALE:You have this irrational desire to deprive me of any joy in my life.
SUPMALE:Let's get out of here, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:And then Nixon says Alex, stop.
LEADMALE:I don't want an alternate ending to my play.
SUPFEMALE:Just give it a chance, okay? Nixon steps up to the podium and addresses the American people.
OTHERFEMALE:"My fellow Americans "I can't thank you enough for your mandate "to make me president for life.
LEADFEMALE:"But more importantly, let me broach this 
LEADFEMALE:"Jennifer Keaton's play "is the worst thing I have ever read.
LEADMALE:"And let me just say this about 
SUPFEMALE:"When I think of Jennifer's play "one word comes to mind.
LEADFEMALE:"P.
LEADFEMALE:U.
LEADMALE:"Go see anything else.
LEADFEMALE:"Fiddler on the Roof, "Hello, Dolly/ "or just stay home and watch reruns of Flubber.
LEADFEMALE:"In conclusion, Jennifer, "and let me make this perfectly clear, "I am ashamed of you.
LEADMALE:"And did I mention, I hate your play.
OTHERMALE:" The end.
SUPMALE:What? What? What? Alex, that was complete nonsense from beginning to end.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, well, excuse me, Little Miss I Wrote One Play and Now I'm Shakespeare.
LEADMALE:Alex, you know what? I'm not using yours.
LEADFEMALE:There's only one copy of one Nixon play that I am taking to school with me, and it's upstairs on my desk right now.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm pooped.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just gonna I'm gonna take a little nap.
LEADMALE:Alex, don't you dare touch my Nixon play.
OTHERMALE:Well Elyse.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Mallory hates me.
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on? I was so upset about Mallory taking this trip with Nick that, uh, before they went down to see Joe, I went down there first and tried to convince him not to sell them a car, and Mallory found me hiding on the floor of a Camaro.
LEADFEMALE:Well, o-o-obviously you-you meant to do the Steven, how could you? How could you? I'll be upstairs watching Nixon Masterpiece Theater.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose the last thing you want to do is talk to me, but really, I think we should.
LEADFEMALE:You tried to stop me from doing something I have every right to do.
SUPFEMALE:You went back on your word, and you did it in front of Joe, the man who will one day be my father-in-law.
LEADFEMALE:If that's not bad enough, you treated me like a teenager.
LEADFEMALE:You snuck around behind my back, and you humiliated me in public.
SUPFEMALE:I agree with everything you said, except the father-in-law part.
LEADMALE:Dad, I am an adult now.
SUPFEMALE:I'm grown-up.
LEADFEMALE:You really have to start respecting my judgment.
LEADMALE:It's just, for-for 20 years, I've had this job as your father, to protect you, worry about you, and it-it's just it's hard to wake up one day and say, "Well, Mallory's an adult now.
SUPFEMALE:Stop worrying about her.
LEADFEMALE:" It's nice to know that-that you worry about me.
OTHERMALE:I mean, it's comforting.
LEADMALE:I mean, I know, when I was a kid and I had a problem, I would always come to you because I thought you had all the answers.
LEADMALE:You know, I used to love it when you'd come to me.
LEADFEMALE:Particularly since Alex never did.
LEADFEMALE:He was always telling me to cut my hair, get a decent job and stop listening to that loud rock and roll music.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, don't you know there's never going to be a time when I won't come to you? I mean, I'm always gonna want to know what you think, and not just 'cause you're my dad, but because I really like you.
SUPMALE:I like you, too.
OTHERMALE:You know, I've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:As your father, I want to be supportive of you and the decisions you make, so I've decided to cosign for that loan.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I think I should get it on my own, though.
SUPFEMALE:If I can't swing it, I'll just have to wait.
LEADMALE:You're no dope, Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Runs in the family, Dad.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Mom, quick, hide me.
SUPFEMALE:Are you all right? No, Mom, I'm scared.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, Alex? Did you see a rerun of The Wizard of Oz? Are the flying monkeys after you, Alex? Ooh, the flying monkeys are after Alex.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
OTHERMALE:Come on, come on, Mal.
LEADMALE:Knock it off.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:Ooh, the flying monkeys, Dad.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse! Honey, stop scaring your father.
LEADFEMALE:He'll be up all night.
LEADMALE:Ooh, the flying monkeys, my pretty.
LEADMALE:Ah, leave him alone.
LEADFEMALE:He's starting to cry.
LEADMALE:Alex, if this is scarier than the flying monkeys, I don't want to hear about it.
LEADFEMALE:It's the paper girl.
SUPFEMALE:She sees me walking down the street.
LEADFEMALE:She pedals her bike towards me, fast as she can.
LEADFEMALE:When she gets real close, she throws the paper right at my head.
LEADMALE:Thank God she doesn't deliver pianos.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Alex, it just means she likes you.
SUPMALE:When I was little, that's how I showed if I liked a boy.
SUPFEMALE:If-if I thought he was cute, I'd just punch him in the arm, and if I wanted him to go out with me, I'd pull his hair like that, but if I wanted to go steady with him, I'd I'd knock him unconscious.
LEADFEMALE:I married her, and I'm thankful to be alive to talk about it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God, that's her.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:This is like the Little Archies version of Fatal Attraction.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Alex, if you don't want her, I'll take her.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Marla! What can I do for you? Um, you owe me two bucks for the paper and I'm in love with your son.
LEADMALE:Don't hurt him, Marla! Well, not till we get there.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Jen, this is the happiest day of my life.
SUPFEMALE:Being picked to be your social studies partner is a natural high unlike any other, my little Ohio Buckeye beauty.
OTHERFEMALE:Simon, listen, I like you, and it's gonna be fun to be your project partner, but you have to stop calling me those names.
LEADMALE:What names are those, my flaxen-haired dove? Hi, Simon.
LEADMALE:Hello, lovely lady.
LEADMALE:Your radiance glows like moonbeams.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are you talking like Omar Sharif? Life is too short not to.
OTHERMALE:Tell your sister the wonderful news.
LEADFEMALE:Simon and I were paired together for a project at school.
LEADFEMALE:Paired together by fate, by the gods.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what's the project? We're supposed to do a paper on entering the workforce, so Simon and I got after-school jobs.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, that's great.
LEADMALE:Oh, for the first time in your life, you'll be earning your own money.
LEADMALE:You'll be able to go where you want to, buy whatever clothes you want to.
LEADMALE:I mean, you won't have to rely on Mom and Dad's measly little allowance.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mom and Dad.
SUPMALE:The k ah, the kettle's ready.
SUPMALE:Kettle's in here.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:The sofa the sofa's ready.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Um, what's this about getting a job? Oh, it's for school.
SUPFEMALE:Simon and I are gonna be working at a fast food restaurant.
LEADMALE:Chicken Heaven.
LEADFEMALE:Heaven for chickens and heaven for me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna be working side by side with the alluring Jennifer Keaton.
LEADMALE:Not to mention those alluring chickens.
LEADFEMALE:Have you noticed how popular our children are these days? Alex, I is your woman now! Hi, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Marla.
SUPFEMALE:You're wearing a skirt.
SUPMALE:You're also wearing pants.
OTHERMALE:Is Alex here? - Uh - Oh, hi, Marla.
SUPFEMALE:You look pretty today.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Even wearing a little blush on your cheeks? Oh, it's not blush.
LEADFEMALE:It's newsprint from the Sunday supplement.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, very becoming.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex, Alex, be nice to her.
OTHERMALE:I've never seen a girl so much in love.
SUPMALE:So, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton, you gave birth to Alex, huh? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Well, someone had to.
LEADFEMALE:Must have been the most exciting day of your life.
LEADMALE:How was it for you, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton? Well, Marla, I didn't give birth to Alex.
SUPMALE:I wanted to, but, uh, I lost the coin toss.
LEADFEMALE:You're pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Scram, kid, I don't go for tots.
LEADMALE:Not as pretty as I thought.
LEADFEMALE:I got a present for you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Marla, you-you don't have to give me presents.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I do.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanted to give you something personal.
SUPMALE:I got you this because I couldn't find the jar that my tonsils were in.
LEADFEMALE:Well-well that's a shame.
SUPMALE:I saved up my pennies, my nickels, and my dimes, and I bought you a $20 bill.
LEADMALE:I hope you like it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Alex, she sure knows the way to your heart.
SUPMALE:It is a beauty.
SUPMALE:Hate to have to give it back.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she should learn a lesson from this.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Jen, what's the price of a heavenly chicken combo deluxe? $4.
SUPMALE:95 plus tax.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, you're amazing.
LEADFEMALE:You've got the mind of a chicken.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Simon.
LEADMALE:You've got the body of a chicken.
OTHERMALE:Mallory, mystical woman of the Midwest, would test us on giblets? Okay, how many giblets in a quart? You know, Jen, I'm-I'm really proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:This sounds like a wonderful place to work.
LEADMALE:Well, Dad, it's not exactly the most prestigious place in the world.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about, Jennifer? Chicken Heaven is a completely highbrow establishment.
LEADMALE:Simon, highbrow establishments don't usually have a drive-through lane where your customers scream their orders directly into a chicken beak.
LEADMALE:And then what happens? The chicken tells the cook? Uh And 12 cents is your change.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Jennifer you're beautiful when you're making change.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, will you stop it and get to work? Excuse me, sir.
OTHERMALE:Sir? - Simon, I think he wants you.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Look, you completely screwed up our order, and we had to wait 20 minutes while you made it in the first place.
LEADMALE:I am sorry; I'll fix that right up for you.
OTHERMALE:Great, and what are we supposed to do in the meantime? Would you care for a lozenge? I'd like to see the manager.
OTHERMALE:Uh, here she is.
LEADFEMALE:She's the manager? Oh, she's more than just the manager.
LEADMALE:She's the woman I love.
SUPFEMALE:Simon, stop it.
LEADMALE:Go put some fries on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, sir, I'll take care of it.
LEADMALE:You better.
LEADMALE:Hey! That's no way to talk to her.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like to step outside? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you? No, I just thought you would.
OTHERMALE:Simon, you really got to get it together.
SUPFEMALE:You're really screwing up here.
LEADMALE:Now go put some more fries on.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, sir, here you go.
LEADMALE:I really don't know why I keep coming back here.
LEADMALE:The service is bad, the atmosphere is worse, and the food is inedible.
LEADFEMALE:How about a coupon for a free meal? Hey, thank you very much.
LEADMALE:See you tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Did you put the fries on? Mission accomplished, my poultry goddess.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Welcome to Chicken Heaven, where you get more cluck for your buck.
LEADMALE:Give me three heavenly drumsticks Ordering three heavenly drumsticks.
LEADFEMALE:French fries Ordering French fries.
LEADFEMALE:coleslaw Ordering coleslaw.
LEADFEMALE:The kitchen's on fire.
LEADMALE:Ordering the kitchen's on fire.
OTHERMALE:Is that one of our specials? No! The kitchen's on fire, you idiot! Make that ordering the kitchen's on fire, you idiot.
LEADMALE:Would you like a drink with that? Simon, the kitchen's on fire! That's a really popular dish.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the fries! Simon! Quick.
LEADMALE:Simon, Jennifer, who's responsible for this? Can we ever say, in the philosophical sense, that anyone is responsible for anything? Yeah, watch me.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Parker, we were really jammed up with customers, and I-I think it's possible that the fries were left on a little too long.
SUPFEMALE:I will tell you what happened.
LEADMALE:This chicken-flicking nitwit screwed up my order and ignored my repeated warnings that the fire was starting.
OTHERFEMALE:Will there be anything else for you today, madam? This young lady saved the day.
LEADMALE:You should be proud of having her as an employee.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
LEADFEMALE:And you should be ashamed of having him.
OTHERMALE:I am.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, you're on probation here.
SUPMALE:Thank you, sir, I'm honored.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, you're real Chicken Heaven material.
LEADMALE:I think you have what it takes to rise to the top of the coop.
SUPFEMALE:No one's ever said that to me before.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like to be assistant manager? Yeah.
SUPMALE:So, when did you first realize that Alex was the most wonderful human being in the whole world? When you told us.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, and before that, uh, when he told us.
SUPMALE:Let's move on.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, what's his favorite chair? Well, probably the one you're sitting in.
OTHERMALE:Mar Marla! Give it back! Let's not tell her where his bed is.
LEADFEMALE:Mom? Can you tell Alex to stop leaving his plates all over the house? I found this outside his door, like room service.
LEADMALE:She gone? Alex, you have to do something.
LEADFEMALE:You have to talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, not yet, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:I think she's about to give me some more money.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what's with the paper girl? She's standing on the corner, staring at a fork.
LEADFEMALE:She's in love with your brother.
LEADMALE:No, seriously.
LEADFEMALE:My sister, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADFEMALE:How was work, honey? - God, Mom, it was worse than ever.
LEADMALE:I mean, since they made me assistant manager, Simon has become even more of a problem.
LEADMALE:We took the job together, but now I'm his boss.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do.
LEADFEMALE:He's completely incompetent.
LEADMALE:If it were anyone else, I think I'd fire him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, so what's the problem? Alex, he's my friend.
LEADFEMALE:So what's the problem? I don't know what I'm gonna do.
SUPMALE:Maybe I should just quit, and get a job at Jiffy Burger.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:I've seen their hats.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Hi, Simon.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, this isn't the army.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to wear your uniform off duty.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADFEMALE:But I like it.
LEADMALE:So I've incorporated it into my wardrobe.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes I wear just the hat and ski boots.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry we had to hear that.
LEADMALE:Simon, we have to talk.
LEADFEMALE:Yes? Simon, we were paired together to do a job, and I don't feel that you're living up to your end of the bargain.
SUPMALE:What do you mean, pretty lady? Simon I've got a job to do, and I take that kind of responsibility seriously.
SUPFEMALE:Now, stop concentrating on me, and start concentrating on your job.
OTHERFEMALE:What job is that? Why am I both drawn to you and repelled by you? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:My mother asked the same thing.
LEADMALE:Sorry I'm late, but I'm ready to go.
SUPMALE:Whoa! - Simon Simon, when you're late, I get in trouble with Mr.
LEADMALE:Parker.
SUPMALE:Now stop fooling around and get to work.
LEADMALE:I love it when you're bossy.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, I don't want to hear it.
LEADFEMALE:Get to your post.
SUPFEMALE:You again, Simon? - No, sir, it was me.
LEADFEMALE:I accidentally bumped into Simon, and he knocked the cups over, and then I asked him to clean them up for me.
LEADMALE:And I'm happy to do that for her, sir, because I'm her knight in shining armor.
SUPMALE:Okay, I never had armor, but I had braces for a while.
LEADMALE:You should've had a muzzle.
SUPMALE:All right, get back to work, both of you.
LEADMALE:I like that idea.
LEADMALE:Jen, I really appreciate you-you covering for me.
LEADMALE:I don't know how to thank you.
LEADMALE:Maybe I do! Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Where you from? Simon Thank you.
LEADMALE:The next show is at 3:15.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:What are you guys doing here? Uh, just came by to get a little free food.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:We're out of here, then.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me, miss? Miss, hey you! Miss! Hey, you mister.
LEADFEMALE:That's no "miss," that's my sister.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She's my sister, too.
OTHERMALE:And you better listen to him, he's my brother.
OTHERMALE:Want to meet my parents? We're them.
LEADMALE:And she's right.
LEADFEMALE:You have a problem with her, you go through us.
LEADMALE:You see, if one of us gets a job, we all get the job.
LEADFEMALE:You got that? I just wanted some ketchup.
LEADFEMALE:Jen? It's over there.
LEADFEMALE:It's over there.
LEADMALE:Nice meeting you.
LEADMALE:So how's it going, Jen? See for yourself.
SUPFEMALE:In the true sense of the word, he is a soda jerk.
SUPMALE:Honey, you've got to do something about Simon.
OTHERMALE:Oh, just ignore him.
LEADFEMALE:It happens every two or three hours.
SUPMALE:What do you guys want? Uh, well, Jen, uh what do you recommend? Eating somewhere else.
LEADMALE:Look, why don't we try four of the Wing-a-ling Delights? No, no, no, I don't want a Wing-a-ling Delight.
LEADMALE:I want a Gizzard Blizzard.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I'll have the Tub O'Necks.
SUPFEMALE:Ordering three Wing-a-lings, one Gizzard Blizzard, and one Tub O'Necks.
LEADMALE:You know what I'd really like? A mesquite-grilled, free-range, boneless breast of chicken on a bed of radicchio with a mustard vinaigrette.
SUPMALE:Ordering one Heavenly Slop Pile.
SUPMALE:Simon! - Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa Hey! Whoa! That's enough! I've got it under control! Well obviously, I'm not needed here.
LEADMALE:Jen, uh why don't you, uh, lock up when you leave, all right? Mr.
OTHERMALE:Parker, can I fire him? Uh, no.
SUPMALE:But I can.
LEADMALE:Simon! You're fired! Where's my Tub O'Necks? You have a milk mustache.
OTHERFEMALE:I like that in a man.
SUPFEMALE:Marla Marla I'm very flattered that you have a crush on me.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, are you gonna tell me it's not gonna work between us? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fine, if that's the way you feel about it.
SUPFEMALE:I can handle this very maturely.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? Shh Marla, look I already have a girlfriend.
LEADMALE:And-and I go to graduate school.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I'm twice your age.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you want to go for the honeymoon? I like the Poconos.
LEADMALE:Marla, it's not gonna work, okay? I mean, it's-it's-it's it's completely nuts.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, i-it's impossible.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe I'm wearing a stupid bow in my hair.
SUPFEMALE:The bow is beautiful.
LEADMALE:It is not! I look like Rose Marie! That's not true.
LEADMALE:Alex you've broken my heart.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I don't want to do that.
OTHERMALE:In a very little while, you're gonna forget all about me.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, I want my 20 bucks back.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no reason to break this off entirely.
SUPFEMALE:A gift is a gift.
LEADMALE:Come on, cough it up.
LEADMALE:Look, Marla any guy your age would be crazy not to fall for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out of here.
LEADMALE:I mean it, I mean it, you know, who knows? Maybe ten or 20 years, you're breaking hearts left and right Maybe, uh maybe our paths will cross again.
SUPMALE:Bye, Marla.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:I'll never wash my forehead again.
LEADMALE:Not that I ever did much before.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Oh! How'd it go with Marla? Kind of rough.
LEADMALE:It's okay; she's young.
LEADMALE:She'll get over it.
SUPMALE:I'm talking about me.
LEADMALE:I had to give the 20 bucks back.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Is Jennifer here? I'll get her.
LEADMALE:Ooh Well, the secret's out.
OTHERMALE:I'm a real goofball.
LEADMALE:I'll be honest with you, Simon.
SUPMALE:That hat's not working for you.
LEADMALE:Hi, Jen.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry about how things went today.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here to turn in my uniform.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna miss this.
LEADMALE:Got a lot of compliments on it from my therapist.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Jen.
LEADMALE:I I guess I just got carried away.
LEADFEMALE:See, when I'm around you, I can't even function.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, you've got to grow up.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, don't you realize what happened back there? You could have gotten me fired.
OTHERFEMALE:You weren't even trying to do a good job.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to do a good job.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry I embarrassed you, I guess I do have to be a little more responsible.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanted to impress you, so that you'd like me.
LEADMALE:Simon, I do like you If you say "as a friend," I'm gonna spontaneously combust.
SUPMALE:Well, then, I guess I'd better take a few steps back.
LEADMALE:As a friend, huh? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I hope you can deal with that, Simon.
LEADMALE:Actually, it's like driving a stake through my heart.
LEADMALE:But I can live with that.
LEADMALE:Tell me something, Jen would you really have fired me from Chicken Heaven? Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:Would you ever fire me as your friend? Never.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:That was a wonderful dinner, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Every time I come here, I learn so much about health food.
LEADMALE:I like your family, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Even this guy.
OTHERFEMALE:When he's not talking politics.
LEADMALE:Come on, Gus.
SUPMALE:On the big issues, we're not that far apart.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Matter of fact, I have always felt, uh, kind of a special bond with you.
LEADFEMALE:I cried when Bush was elected.
LEADMALE:So did I.
OTHERFEMALE:Mine were not tears of joy.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, okay, so we don't talk politics.
OTHERFEMALE:It's one area we'll just avoid.
LEADFEMALE:How are things going down at the station? Oh, your dad and I are producing a documentary comparing, uh, Reagan's presidency to medieval Europe's bubonic plague.
SUPFEMALE:Nine out of ten people prefer the plague.
SUPFEMALE:All right, so we don't talk about work.
SUPMALE:Hey, how's Mike doing at Harvard? Oh, oh, very well, very well.
LEADMALE:He's working part-time for Ted Kennedy.
OTHERMALE:You're killing me, Gus.
OTHERFEMALE:Maya, I understand you guys are looking for a house.
OTHERMALE:Have you had any luck? Not yet.
OTHERMALE:The market is really tight.
SUPMALE:Seems like there's nothing out there.
SUPMALE:Well, if, uh, Alex and Gus don't wind up coming to blows here, uh, why don't you take a look at the house across the street? The Obecks are moving.
SUPMALE:The Obecks are moving? That's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Why is that such good news? Oh, well I never liked Marty Obeck.
LEADMALE:He was always running around telling people the only things I was interested in was makeup and clothes and shoes.
OTHERMALE:What, you dispute that? No.
LEADMALE:I just think it's very rude of him to point it out.
LEADMALE:What's the house like, Elyse? Kind of like this one.
LEADFEMALE:Victorian, with a lot of charm.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think we could see the house this weekend? Well, I'll talk to the real estate agent and set it up.
LEADFEMALE:Just out of curiosity, Steve, how many black families are there in the neighborhood? Well, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:There's the Well, uh with you, there'd be one.
LEADFEMALE:Let's say we didn't move in.
OTHERFEMALE:How many would there be? Didn't move in? Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:This will take a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Um That would be none.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I think that might say something about the neighborhood.
LEADMALE:Look, Gus, I want you to know this neighborhood is not like that.
SUPMALE:We've lived here for 15 years.
LEADMALE:There's never been one racial incident.
LEADMALE:That's a pretty impressive record for a one-race neighborhood.
LEADMALE:It'd be great to have you guys as neighbors.
SUPFEMALE:Gus and I could carpool to work.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm all for that.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I get so tired of driving to work alone with nothing but the radio for company.
LEADMALE:What do you listen to? Strictly elevator music.
LEADMALE:Welcome to the neighborhood, Gus! I just know your friends, the Thompsons, are going to absolutely love this house.
SUPFEMALE:It's just one of the most charming old Victorians - in Leland Heights.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:And you know it's been completely restored? Everything brought up to code in every respect.
LEADMALE:Oh, heck with the Thompsons.
LEADMALE:We'll take it.
SUPMALE:Listen, I'm gonna open the blinds in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:It's so pretty with the sunlight streaming through.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry we're late.
LEADFEMALE:Alex and Gus insisted on sitting in the car until the accordion version of "Rock Around the Clock" was over.
LEADMALE:Oh Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, uh, Christine Chadway, these are our friends, Gus and Maya and Michael Thompson.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Christine is the real estate agent who handles this house.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, how do you how do you do? Oh, this house is so charming.
LEADMALE:It's the best one we've seen, isn't it, Gus? Yes, isn't it? This is our dream house.
LEADMALE:This is the house I saw my family in.
LEADMALE:D-Don't show so much enthusiasm.
LEADFEMALE:It'll only make the price go up.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:For once in his life, my dad is offering some sound financial advice.
OTHERFEMALE:Pretend you hate the house.
LEADFEMALE:Make her have to work to sell it to you.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? This house has a lot of problems.
LEADMALE:Well, the roof leaks.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, the basement floods.
SUPMALE:You know, it needs a lot of work.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, quite frankly, they ought to just tear it down.
LEADMALE:Now, this woman has a very unusual sales technique.
LEADMALE:Didn't you just say that it'd been brought up to code in every way? Look, the workmanship is so shoddy, I just I just don't feel that I can, in good conscience, sell this house to these very nice people.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, uh, Christine? It seems to me that you're trying to discourage us from buying this house.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Uh, no, I-I just want to make sure, right up front, that you know the really miserable shape this house is in.
LEADMALE:Well, suppose we offered you full price - for the house right now.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, full price? Uh, can I speak to you for a moment, Gus? Maya, you like the house, don't you? - Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, good, good.
LEADMALE:We're offering your client full asking price for the house.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Gus.
OTHERMALE:Yoo-hoo, Gus, big fella.
LEADMALE:We haven't met.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Christine, it looks like you've got an offer you can't refuse.
LEADMALE:I don't know that my clients are really ready to sell this house yet.
OTHERMALE:I mean, actually, they just asked me to kind of feel out the market for them first.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
SUPFEMALE:I happen to know that the Obecks are very anxious to sell.
LEADMALE:Yeah, the absence of furniture is a bit of a tip-off.
LEADMALE:I think it's obvious what's going on here.
LEADMALE:She doesn't want to sell the house to us because we're black.
LEADFEMALE:Black? Me? Never.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:You're not black; we are.
SUPMALE:This behavior is totally offensive.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh I want to apologize to my friends.
LEADFEMALE:Christine, um I suggest you take this offer back to your clients, and that they, uh they give this the serious consideration it deserves.
SUPMALE:Well, actually, yes.
SUPMALE:I-I do I do have to talk to my clients.
LEADFEMALE:I'm beginning to think this isn't about money at all.
LEADFEMALE:And that pains me on every conceivable level.
LEADFEMALE:Are you aware, uh Christine Chadway, Realtor license number 47856 that there are anti-discrimination laws in this state? Dad, uh, why don't we just get out of here? This was a big mistake.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:The only mistake made here today was hers.
SUPFEMALE:Michael.
LEADFEMALE:Maya.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's, uh let's look at the rest of our house.
SUPFEMALE:It's scary the things I miss when I'm not here.
LEADFEMALE:Mom baked a apple pie.
SUPFEMALE:And it's still warm, Alex.
LEADMALE:Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get the knife.
LEADMALE:Alex, we can't have any.
SUPMALE:It's a it's a "welcome to the neighborhood" gift for the Thompsons.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but Mom just baked it to torture us.
SUPMALE:She's not above that, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Sure smells good.
OTHERMALE:Probably tastes even better.
LEADMALE:This could be her best work yet.
SUPFEMALE:This pie is mine.
LEADMALE:Do it, Alex.
LEADMALE:What about the Thompsons? We'll get 'em a store-bought pie.
LEADMALE:They'll never know the difference.
LEADFEMALE:Come to papa, come to papa Freeze, Alex! You eat that pie, that's the last thing you eat.
LEADFEMALE:Welcome to the neighborhood, Gus.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you, Alex.
LEADMALE:That's, uh, very sweet of you.
LEADMALE:Thanks very much.
OTHERMALE:Baked it myself.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, I came over to give you something, too.
LEADFEMALE:What's this? - Here.
OTHERMALE:"20 All-Time Greatest Hits for the Dentist's Office.
SUPMALE:" Oh, Gus.
SUPMALE:Oh, Gus.
OTHERMALE:I'm just glad I finally found someone to share this with.
SUPMALE:Oh Oh! You You know, I had a root canal to "The Streets of Laredo.
SUPFEMALE:" What is this? What is it, honey? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADMALE:What was that letter, Dad? Uh, no, just junk.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, something about a sale.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, have you lost your mind? It's okay, Steve.
LEADMALE:I know what it is.
LEADFEMALE:We got one, too.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? It's a letter from some of your neighbors, asking you to join them in their effort to rid the neighborhood of the new unwanted element.
SUPMALE:Oh, Gus, I'm-I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:This is terrible.
LEADMALE:They can't get away with this.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna find out who they are, and I am gonna give them a lecture on freedom and constitutional rights that they will not soon forget, and they are not gonna bother anybody after that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've heard your lectures, Alex, and I can't condone that kind of violence.
SUPMALE:What's going on? This is 1989.
LEADFEMALE:Things like this don't happen now.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess they do.
LEADMALE:It's just so shocking to find it happening in your backyard.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't be shocked, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Oh, this thing always comes up, and it doesn't take much to bring it to the surface.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you're not gonna move out now, are you? No, we are not.
LEADFEMALE:Maya and I want to stay.
SUPFEMALE:Gus, we have to find out who wrote this letter.
LEADFEMALE:No, Steven, no.
LEADFEMALE:No, the best thing to do is to ignore it.
SUPFEMALE:Once they realize we're not moving out, they'll give up.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you're not alone here.
LEADMALE:We're gonna keep an eye out for you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:But it's, uh it's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Look, uh, I got to go.
LEADMALE:Let me drive you home.
LEADMALE:I live across the street.
SUPMALE:Let me walk you home.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Steven, when I get home, I'll come back over here and tell you I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Then I'll walk you home.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Michael.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? I heard you were in from Harvard.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Alex, good to see you.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in, man.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:So, Harvard, huh? What's it like going to the best business school in the country? I'm not in the business school.
SUPMALE:I'm in liberal arts.
LEADMALE:They still have that? Sorry to disappoint you, Alex, but they do.
LEADMALE:And to tell you the truth, I think, uh, poets are more important than bankers.
LEADFEMALE:Well, try getting a car loan from the BrontÃ« sisters.
LEADMALE:You know, it's going to be interesting living in the same neighborhood with you, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dad, would you turn that down a little? Wait, wait, you don't want to listen to that? Hey, that's the "Beer Barrel Polka.
LEADMALE:" The two of you should rent an elevator, fix it up and move in together.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Mike, let me tell you why I really came by.
LEADMALE:Um, I just wanted you to know, while you're back at Harvard, that, um, you don't have to worry about your folks.
OTHERMALE:If there's any more problems, we'll be here.
LEADFEMALE:Problems? What kind of problems? Uh, it's nothing, really.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:The house is haunted.
LEADMALE:Look, somebody in the neighborhood, uh, is passing around this racist letter trying to convince people to get your parents to move.
OTHERFEMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:Alex, I told them this would happen if we moved into an all-white neighborhood, but they wouldn't listen to me.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you should have been listening to WNTW.
SUPMALE:You missed an uninterrupted polka fest.
LEADMALE:Dad, uh, Alex told me about the letters.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, don't worry about it, Michael.
SUPMALE:Chances are this whole thing will just blow over.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I am worried.
LEADFEMALE:How am I supposed to keep an eye on you and Mom if I'm 800 miles away in Boston? Hey, well, you don't have to.
SUPMALE:Look here.
LEADMALE:You see, we have our own personal vigilante.
SUPFEMALE:Hi there.
OTHERFEMALE:Looks like rain.
LEADFEMALE:Steve, old buddy, I appreciate your concern, but it really isn't necessary for you to guard our house.
LEADFEMALE:You can't be too careful, huh? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I didn't see you come over here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I walked right by you on the porch, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Maya.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Steve.
SUPMALE:Hi, M Maya, I didn't see you come home.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I walked right by you on the porch.
LEADMALE:It's a heck of a service you provide here.
OTHERMALE:Hello? Look here, if you ever call here again, I'm gonna have you arrested.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and I'll, uh, take a box of mint cookies, too.
LEADFEMALE:Damn Brownies.
SUPMALE:How long has this been happening, Dad? Oh, ever since Troop 39 started that sales push.
LEADFEMALE:I think he has a right to know what's happening here.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Besides the letter, there have been some phone calls.
SUPMALE:It's not the first time this kind of thing has happened, and it won't be the last, but we can deal with it.
LEADMALE:Who you calling? I'm, uh, canceling my flight back to Boston.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? - You'll do no such thing.
OTHERFEMALE:You've got midterms coming up.
LEADMALE:We'll be all right, Michael.
LEADMALE:We don't want you to miss school.
SUPMALE:What good am I going to be in school if I'm worrying about you two all the time? You deliberately put yourself into a dangerous situation and naively think it's gonna blow over.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not.
LEADMALE:Well, what do you wants us to do, Michael? Move? Yes, that's exactly what I think we should do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:We're not gonna be run out of here like criminals.
SUPFEMALE:We worked hard to own a place like this.
SUPFEMALE:Why are you so stubborn? This is a racist society.
LEADMALE:You can't change that.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, we can.
LEADFEMALE:Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you are at Harvard.
SUPMALE:Now, do you think you got there by people sitting back and saying, "I can't change things"? I'm all for change, but not when it comes to placing my family in danger.
SUPMALE:You're overreacting, Michael.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not.
LEADMALE:You just don't seem to understand what could happen to you here.
LEADMALE:I know Steven's one hell of a watchman, but it's not enough.
LEADFEMALE:I know what needs to be done here.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call a neighborhood meeting.
LEADFEMALE:We've got to put an end to this.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody should have to live under guard.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse, when did you get here? I came to hang curtains.
LEADFEMALE:Walked right by you on the porch.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Eagle Eyes.
LEADMALE:I'll walk you across the street.
SUPMALE:If you ask me, that's a trick porch.
OTHERMALE:Thank you all for responding to the call to come here and talk about what's going on in the neighborhood here.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm ashamed to say that ever since Gus and Maya Thompson moved in here to this neighborhood, they have been threatened and harassed with hate mail and-and phone calls.
LEADMALE:It-it has to stop.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, it does.
SUPFEMALE:Not everybody in this neighborhood is a bigot.
OTHERMALE:We're-we're nice people and we're good neighbors, unless we're taken advantage of, which brings me to the other reason why I'm here tonight.
LEADMALE:What's that, Phil? I want my hedge clippers back.
LEADMALE:You had them since last May.
LEADFEMALE:And my electric sander.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and my snow shovel.
SUPMALE:We, uh we promise to return everything after the meeting.
LEADMALE:Uh, I-I should apologize for my parents not being here.
LEADMALE:They're visiting my aunt in Detroit.
LEADFEMALE:Um, but I-I'm sure that I speak for my whole family when I say that black and white together make more than a nice piece of marble cake.
LEADFEMALE:They make brotherhood.
LEADMALE:Look, uh, let me, uh let me start by saying most everybody in this neighborhood is happy to have you here.
LEADFEMALE:We don't care about the color of your skin.
OTHERMALE:All we care about is, uh, what dish you'll bring to those potluck parties and whether or not you have good tools I can borrow.
LEADMALE:Um, I feel there's something I have to say.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I may not know much about history or politics or math, economics, language arts, phys ed Mal, we want to wrap this up about 11:00.
LEADMALE:Okay, okay.
OTHERMALE:I just have to include chemistry.
SUPMALE:Um, but I do know people, and when I look at the Thompsons, I see these are these are good people.
LEADMALE:These are warm people.
SUPMALE:These are stylishly dressed people.
SUPMALE:Uh, I-I-I'd like to say something.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to thank you for all the kind words that you've said.
LEADMALE:Now, we know that the trouble is being caused by only a few people.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't know who you are, and quite frankly, we don't care, but if you're here tonight, let me say, loudly and clearly, you are not scaring us out of this neighborhood.
LEADMALE:We are not moving.
SUPFEMALE:I have something to say.
LEADMALE:Go ahead, Glen.
SUPFEMALE:I worked at Franklin Steel for eight years, graveyard shift, to try to save up enough money to put a down payment on my house so that my wife, Ginny, and our kids could have a decent place to live, and, uh, now I hear that, since they've moved in, the value of my house has dropped by $5,000.
LEADFEMALE:And it's just gonna keep dropping as more and more blacks move in here.
OTHERFEMALE:My house is the only investment I have, and if it goes under, so does my family.
LEADFEMALE:So what am I supposed to do? Stand by and watch everything I've worked for just slip away? Now, I've got nothing against you personally.
LEADFEMALE:This is all about economics.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, maybe it is to you, but we have to take it personally.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we're the ones that are getting the hate mail and the phone calls.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm sorry that's happening to you, but nobody asked you to move into this neighborhood.
LEADMALE:I wasn't aware that I had to get permission.
LEADMALE:But there are plenty of nice black neighborhoods around.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, why'd you have to come here? We came here because we have the right to live here, just as you do.
LEADFEMALE:You don't see me trying to move into one of your neighborhoods, do you? This is one of my neighborhoods, an American neighborhood, and I am an American, and I fought in Vietnam and Mississippi and Memphis to defend the freedoms that some of us would like to enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, your freedom is my financial disaster, and if your family won't move, mine has to.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Ginny.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait, Glen.
LEADMALE:Glen, Glen, just before you go, you, uh you mentioned economics, so I feel that I must speak.
LEADMALE:Now, the only way the property values in this neighborhood are gonna go down is if people like yourself start panic-selling.
OTHERMALE:Now, in-in the current market, uh, our homes have been appreciating by approximately 4.
LEADFEMALE:2% per annum, any home improvements.
LEADMALE:How can we? Your dad has all our tools.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, what I'm trying to say is this.
LEADFEMALE:I hope that we in this neighborhood can continue to live in harmony, and to sell our homes to people of all creeds and all colors, all races at tremendously inflated profits.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Alex, I hope you're right, but I can't afford to take that chance.
OTHERFEMALE:I am moving out now, and there's a lot of you in this room here who are gonna be following me, even if you're too ashamed to admit it.
LEADFEMALE:He won't be moving so fast.
LEADMALE:I have his trailer hitch.
LEADMALE:I I'm terribly sorry this has happened.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, we found a house we liked, and we moved in, but we didn't mean to disrupt the neighborhood.
SUPMALE:Well, obviously this neighborhood needs disrupting.
LEADMALE:Disrupting is healthy.
SUPMALE:You know, my whole life, I've I've heard my parents talk about the '60s, how they disrupted the social order to change the things that they thought were wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I wish I were there in the '60s so I could say to the world, "I want to fight for justice, too.
SUPMALE:" That was a beautiful thought, Jennifer, and very well-timed considering tie-dye is coming back in.
SUPFEMALE:But it's only one family that's moving.
SUPMALE:The rest of us are staying, right? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:Of course.
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:Peter? Phil? Nancy? Well, how What can you be thinking? Well, none of us want to move, Elyse, but we can't afford to lose a lot of money, either.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
LEADMALE:Gus, Michael, I want to talk to you in private.
LEADMALE:I think we should go home.
SUPMALE:Look, don't let anything that's happened here change your mind.
LEADMALE:Steven, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:In my life, my family comes first, and right now, I'm not so sure that staying here is the best thing for us to do.
OTHERFEMALE:Michael, don't let them do this.
LEADMALE:It was never my choice to move here.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Ever since Gus and Maya Thompson moved in here to this neighborhood, they have been threatened and harassed with hate mail and-and phone calls.
LEADMALE:I hope that we in this neighborhood can continue to live in harmony and to sell our homes to people of all creeds and all colors, all races at tremendously inflated profits.
LEADFEMALE:I am moving out now.
LEADMALE:And there's a lot of you in this room here who are gonna be following me, even if you're too ashamed to admit it.
LEADMALE:Right now, I'm not so sure that staying here is the best thing for us to do.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, that is the worst neighborhood meeting I have ever been to.
LEADMALE:I think so, too.
SUPMALE:Why can't we live in a neighborhood full of nice, thoughtful people who care more about others than they do about themselves? One where people say, "Hi, neighbor.
LEADFEMALE:"How you doing there, neighbor? Glad to see you here, neighbor.
LEADFEMALE:" In other words, Dad, you want to live in Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Rogers' neighborhood.
SUPMALE:Well, you've got to admit, Alex, it's a real nice place.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood Beautiful day for a neighbor.
SUPMALE:It's a beautiful day at the funny farm, too, Dad.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm so upset with those people.
LEADMALE:We we've known Phil and Nancy how many years? How can they sit there and say that they're thinking of moving if their property value goes down? I know.
LEADMALE:It makes me want to put our house up for sale and move out.
LEADFEMALE:I feel the same way.
SUPMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:If we move, won't it look like we're running away from the Thompsons, too?  She's right.
LEADFEMALE:We can't move unless the Thompsons move.
SUPMALE:And if the Thompsons stay, we can stay.
LEADMALE:Well, what if the Thompsons decide to live here in the summers and somewhere else in the winters? We'd go with them.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we were pretty naive when we urged Gus and Maya to move into this neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, you're naive, Mom, but I I mean, nobody who came of age in the '60s has a great deal of savoir faire.
SUPMALE:It's true.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you two don't have a whole lot of that stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Four years of French at Grant College, ladies and gentlemen.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I never really thought of it before, but why do we live in an all-white neighborhood? You don't remember, Jen, but it wasn't all white when we moved in here.
LEADFEMALE:That's one of the reasons we liked it.
SUPMALE:Oh, I remember when I was little, I had this, uh, friend down the street named Maggie.
LEADFEMALE: - And one day, she asked me how come my skin wasn't black like hers.
LEADMALE:And the only reason I could think of is that we washed with Ivory soap and it was dyeing my skin.
LEADFEMALE:It's a good thing you didn't use Selsun Blue.
LEADMALE:Do you know, if we could just hold on to that kind of innocence all our lives, then there wouldn't be any discrimination.
LEADMALE:I mean, people would be accepted for their character and not their color.
LEADMALE:I mean, how many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free? The answer, my friend Is blowing in the wind 
LEADMALE:The answer is blowing in the wind Okay, you finished? Huh? How many roads must a man walk down Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Snap out of it.
SUPFEMALE:That is old.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we should go across the street and apologize to Gus and Maya for getting them into this mess.
LEADMALE:I feel responsible.
SUPMALE:I don't think we should bother them right now, Elyse.
SUPMALE:They probably want to be alone to, uh, discuss things.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're probably right.
OTHERFEMALE:If we went over there, we'd just wind up interfering.
OTHERMALE:And they have to decide what's best for them.
LEADFEMALE:Is it possible that they're really going to mind their own business? No, way, Jen.
LEADMALE:I mean, look at them eyeing the door.
SUPFEMALE:See that? See Dad's left foot? See he's starting to make a move? Any minute, Mom's gonna put down the coffee cup and say something like I could use some fresh air.
LEADMALE:How about a walk? And then he'll say A walk? Good idea.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:You two are good.
LEADFEMALE:  One in favor of moving.
SUPMALE:One not in favor of moving.
LEADFEMALE:And one more in favor of moving.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it looks like we have a tie.
LEADMALE:Since when does two-to-one make a tie, Dad? Well, I had to disqualify this one because of poor penmanship.
LEADFEMALE:You always were a poor loser, Gus.
LEADMALE:Look, I know you both want to move, but I'm afraid that if we let ourselves be run out of our home, we're never gonna be able to hold our heads up again.
SUPMALE:Dad, don't let pride get in the way here.
SUPFEMALE:We're talking about your safety.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm not talking about pride.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking about simple human dignity.
OTHERMALE:Tell me, Dad.
SUPMALE:How dignified do you feel when you hear somebody shouting racist slogans in your ear every time you pick up that phone?  How'd you do that? Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:Let me, Maya.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Oh? I see.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh, okay, uh, thanks for the warning.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh, we'll be on guard.
SUPMALE:What was the warning about? Should we call the police? Alex thinks so.
OTHERFEMALE:He says Steven and Elyse are coming over.
SUPMALE:They've been singing some of those white protest songs.
LEADFEMALE:Let's make a run for it.
SUPFEMALE: I work with the guy.
LEADMALE:You two save yourselves.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:We were taking a walk, and we suddenly remembered we wanted to borrow a A ladder.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, uh, let's go around back to the garage.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh, we don't need that right this minute.
LEADFEMALE:Next week would be fine.
SUPFEMALE:Our climbing plans are loose.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, uh, you might as well come in, then.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, uh, well, I guess we could do that, couldn't we, Elyse? Uh, we could.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, let's All right.
SUPMALE:Hey, we're in, we're in.
LEADMALE:Hi, Maya.
SUPMALE:Hi, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Steve, good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Steve.
LEADFEMALE:Good to see you.
LEADMALE:My pleasure.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down, honey, sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, we got some time.
SUPFEMALE: Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hi.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you can interfere now.
LEADMALE:Just want to tell you how badly we feel about how the meeting went.
SUPMALE:It it really backfired.
LEADMALE:No, it didn't.
LEADMALE:It just opened our eyes to the way the neighborhood really feels about us.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we just need some time to work this out.
SUPMALE:I'm sure most of these people will come around.
LEADMALE:Steven, we took a family vote, and we decided to move.
SUPMALE:You took a family vote without us? We love you, Steve, old buddy, but, uh, you're not actually in our family.
LEADMALE:And even though it didn't work out here, we still appreciate everything you did for us.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, especially the part where you encouraged us to move into this bastion of racial equality.
LEADMALE:But you don't blame us? "Blame" is such a strong word.
SUPFEMALE:Of course we don't blame you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, uh, it's our own fault that we forgot how naive you are when it comes to such ugly things like racism.
SUPMALE:Does everyone in the world think we're naive? - MAYA and 
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's true.
LEADMALE:But it's a compliment.
LEADMALE:You two are so pure of heart that it never occurs to you that others aren't that way.
SUPMALE:You are very special people.
LEADMALE:So you forgive us for getting you into this mess.
LEADMALE:"Forgive" is such a strong word.
SUPMALE:Look, I-I realize we put you in an awfully uncomfortable position, and I and I apologize for that.
LEADMALE:But in spite of everything, we'd really love to have you as our neighbors, and and we'll do everything we can to help you stay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm with Elyse and Steven.
LEADMALE:Yes, yes, I think, if we move, we're making a big mistake.
LEADMALE:And I-I tell you, I just don't feel good about it.
SUPMALE: Yeah? Well, I don't feel good about going off to Harvard and-and leaving you two alone.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother and I will decide what's best for this family.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why I didn't count her vote.
LEADMALE:Honey, give it up.
LEADMALE:You lost the vote.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I fought against discrimination as hard as you.
SUPFEMALE:But I don't want to fight the battle when I come home.
SUPFEMALE:Well what about that cute little window seat? I mean, we looked a long time to find a house with a window seat, buttercup.
SUPFEMALE:That's a mighty fine window seat, buttercup.
SUPFEMALE:What good is a window seat if you're afraid to sit in the window? That was some of the best Italian food I've ever tasted.
LEADFEMALE:We'll have to come back to Guido's, Gus.
SUPMALE:Well, there are a lot of restaurants you can try out if you stay in the neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, I must say I'm truly enjoying the way you've been trying all week to make me change my mind about moving.
LEADMALE:Is it having any effect? - Oh, a lot.
LEADMALE:It's convincing me I might want to move after all.
OTHERFEMALE:There's something wrong with this door.
SUPMALE:I can't seem to get it unlocked.
LEADMALE:Mom, Dad, I don't think you should go in there.
SUPMALE:Let's just go across the street to the Keatons' - until the police come.
LEADFEMALE:Police? - What's going on in there? - Dad, don't! Don't! Who did this? I don't know, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:They didn't sign the guest book.
LEADFEMALE:Michael, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I got here after it happened.
SUPMALE:I already called the police, and they're on their way over.
LEADFEMALE:How could anybody do this? Oh, Gus, they even wrote on the walls.
LEADFEMALE:What does "whits only" mean? It means that somewhere there's a bigot running around with a big "E.
LEADFEMALE:" You're gonna stay at our house tonight till we get this mess cleaned up.
LEADFEMALE:No, we will not.
LEADFEMALE:We're getting out of this neighborhood tonight.
LEADMALE:It's over.
OTHERMALE:I'm going upstairs to pack.
LEADMALE:I'll help you.
SUPFEMALE:Is this the house that reported a break-in? Take a wild guess.
SUPFEMALE:How do you do? I'm, uh Officer Steele.
SUPFEMALE:This is, uh, my partner Officer Larson.
SUPMALE:Who reported the break-in? I did.
SUPMALE:You came home and found it this way? No, he came home, he slashed the furniture, he wrote on the walls, then he called us.
LEADFEMALE:I'm signing us up for therapy.
LEADMALE:Hey, I saw the police car outside.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, did somebody break in? No, Mal, they came home, did this themselves and called the police.
LEADFEMALE:Have we met before? I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what does "whits only" mean? I think there's a letter missing, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Which one? Uh, did, uh did either one of you see anybody come in or go out of this house tonight? Oh, my boyfriend Nick has taught me to be very observant about cars, and I noticed a 1988 powder blue, um, uh, Mercury Topaz GS with sheepskin seat covers.
LEADFEMALE:I knew it was suspicious the minute I saw it.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my car.
LEADMALE:Gus, you're under arrest.
LEADMALE:FBI material if I ever saw it.
OTHERMALE:Hey, that's no way to talk about your girlfriend, Nick.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, don't ever call me Nick.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry Nicholas.
SUPMALE:All right, uh, let's get this report filled out.
LEADMALE:Who's the owner of the house? I am.
OTHERMALE:But not for long.
LEADMALE:Hey, sport, where you been? Timmy's house.
LEADMALE:Timmy's dad said the Thompsons are moving 'cause nobody wants black people here.
SUPMALE:Is that true, Alex? Well I hate to say it, Andy, but unfortunately there are some people who feel that way.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? Uh because they have this ignorant idea that they're better than everybody else.
LEADMALE:You always say that about yourself.
LEADMALE: Yeah, well I'm kind of joking when I say that.
OTHERMALE:No, you aren't.
SUPMALE:I got to stop saying that.
LEADFEMALE:Timmy's dad is telling everybody our house is worth less money 'cause black people live here.
LEADMALE:Who is Timmy's dad the town crier? Listen, Andy, I want to tell you something.
SUPFEMALE:In the strictest confidence, okay? I don't want you telling anybody else I said this, all right? Is that a promise? - Promise.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:In this situation, money's not important.
OTHERMALE:Mom, Dad, Alex has a fever! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa Andy I'm fine, okay? It's just it's just that w-we have to treat everybody fairly and equally whether th-they're white, they're black or-or my personal favorite, treasury-note green.
SUPFEMALE:All right? - Promise.
LEADMALE:Promise.
LEADFEMALE:What's this about a fever? Oh, that-that-that's just a little game we play.
LEADMALE:We-we accuse each other of having different ailments.
OTHERFEMALE: You have fallen arches.
OTHERMALE:Whatever happened to "Ring Around the Rosie"? Go get washed up for lunch, honey.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, keep those arches up.
LEADMALE: - Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:We just heard the Thompsons' house was vandalized last night.
LEADMALE:This is really terrible.
LEADMALE:Are they all right? Yeah, th-they're fine, but why are you suddenly so concerned? I didn't hear you speaking up for them at the meeting.
LEADFEMALE:It was different when we were talking about the value of our homes, but, well, now we're talking about violence.
LEADMALE:We can't sit back and let that happen.
LEADFEMALE:It-it's not different it was just easier to pretend it didn't matter before.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you either support the right of people to live where they please or you don't.
LEADMALE:Well, that's easy for you to say.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you're a two-income family.
LEADFEMALE:You can afford to let the value of your home drop without it affecting you so much.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying that if you were a two-income family you'd feel differently about the Thompsons moving in? Yes, absolutely.
LEADMALE:Phil, get a job.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't want to.
SUPMALE:I like it at home.
SUPFEMALE:I think we're getting off the point here.
LEADFEMALE:The point 
OTHERMALE:Where do you draw the line between protecting another family's civil rights and your own family's financial well-being? I'd like to think that I'd live in a tent before I give in to this sort of prejudice.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, it'd be my tent.
LEADMALE:You borrowed it last August, Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we're not prejudiced.
SUPMALE:I think there's a fine line between prejudice and complicity.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, your silence is as damaging as-as the graffiti on the Thompsons' wall.
LEADFEMALE:It is not.
OTHERFEMALE:It is so.
SUPMALE:And get a job.
LEADFEMALE:Look, look this isn't getting us anywhere.
OTHERMALE:Let's just stop making accusations.
OTHERMALE:Where were you at approximately As a matter of fact, I was watching television with the kids.
SUPMALE:And it was one of your documentaries, Steven.
SUPMALE:Oh, Hieroglyphic Humor? - Right.
LEADMALE:Um, how did you like it? The jokes were a little old.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You don't seriously suspect us of breaking in to their house, do you? Frankly, I don't know what to think about anyone around here anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, where were you at approximately 10:15 last night? Oh, what a mess.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go back to the hotel.
LEADMALE:They sure trashed this place.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I always thought that lamp would look better over there.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Michael, that was a joke.
LEADFEMALE:Laugh.
SUPFEMALE:How can you joke at a time like this? But this is the kind of time you need to laugh most.
LEADFEMALE:Your father and I learned that a long time ago.
LEADMALE: Hey, you remember that freedom march in Selma in '65.
SUPFEMALE: We laughed that day.
SUPMALE:Yes we did.
LEADMALE: What exactly made you laugh? Your father used to tell the worst jokes just to keep my spirits up.
SUPMALE:Hey, now, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:They weren't so bad.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, really? Do you think it was a coincidence that the stone throwing started whenever you said, "Knock, knock"? She's kidding.
SUPMALE: -  I wonder who Keaton Cleaning Brigade at your service.
OTHERMALE:No job too small.
LEADFEMALE:Some jobs too big.
LEADFEMALE:What does "whits only" mean? There's a letter missing.
LEADFEMALE:Somewhere.
SUPFEMALE:Where should we start? How about anywhere? - 
SUPFEMALE:Right, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Gus.
LEADMALE:They destroyed your Lawrence Welk collection.
LEADMALE: Racism takes many ugly forms.
LEADFEMALE: A one and a two.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh, he's starting to bubble.
SUPFEMALE:Gus, I know this can in no way make up for what's happened here, but I'd like you to have my Lawrence Welk record collection.
LEADFEMALE:No, Alex, I-I couldn't.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Yes, you could, please.
OTHERMALE:Take it with our blessing.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Gus, we're gonna need some extra boxes for all this stuff.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, we got lots of boxes in the basement.
LEADMALE:Yeah, come on, let's go get them.
LEADFEMALE: Okay, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Michael, what are these pictures of? Oh, well, in this one, my folks were thrown out of a segregated lunch counter in Mobile.
LEADMALE:And in this one, they were thrown out of a segregated lunch counter in Birmingham.
LEADFEMALE:Can you imagine being 20 years old and choosing to walk through an angry mob just to get a drink out of a public fountain? I would never have the guts to do that.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't even have the guts to walk through school in gaucho pants.
LEADFEMALE:You know, your parents really went through a lot back then, Michael.
LEADMALE:They sure did.
LEADFEMALE:They were turned away from public schools.
OTHERMALE:They couldn't sit at lunch counters next to whites.
SUPMALE:They couldn't live in the neighborhoods they wanted to.
LEADMALE:Looks like they still can't.
LEADFEMALE:It's really crazy, isn't it? - 
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I mean, how many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free? The answer, my friend Is blowing in the wind The answer is blowing in the wind.
SUPMALE:Finally.
LEADFEMALE:Proof that they're ours.
SUPMALE:What's this picture with all these people at the Lincoln Memorial? Uh, the march on Washington.
LEADFEMALE:That's where Martin Luther King made his famous speech.
LEADMALE:"Now is the time "to lift up our nation "from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
SUPFEMALE:" You know it, Michael.
OTHERMALE:How could I grow up in the same house with you two and not know it? Well, I wonder what Dr.
LEADMALE:King would say about the situation in this house today.
LEADFEMALE:He'd say we can't move.
SUPMALE:That we got to stay here and continue to fight.
SUPFEMALE:And what would you say? You and your friends fought long and hard to win us certain basic rights.
LEADFEMALE:And now it's my turn to fight for them.
LEADFEMALE:Finally proof that he's ours.
LEADFEMALE:I always wanted a window seat.
SUPFEMALE:They're not going to make us move out of this neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:Even if they pound down that door.
LEADMALE: How do you do that? - Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Can we come in? - 
SUPMALE:Nancy, what are you - 
OTHERMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:We, uh, would've been here sooner, but first we had to raid Keaton's garage to get our tools back.
SUPMALE:I know you have every reason to turn us away, but we would very much like to help you get your home back together.
SUPMALE:We're ashamed that it took this violence to get us to come over here.
LEADFEMALE:But we're here now, and, um, we'd like to do everything we can to make you feel welcome and safe in your neighborhood.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we certainly could use the help.
SUPMALE:What does "whits only" mean? Let's clear this up once and for all.
SUPFEMALE: Now we'll never know.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hmm? - Gus.
LEADFEMALE:Here, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we Mm-hmm.
SUPMALE:That's better.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Gus, you could have this man arrested for defacing your property.
SUPMALE:Aw, no, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I wouldn't do that to my neighbor.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, morning, Jen.
LEADMALE:How about some breakfast? What's the point of breakfast? Or any meal, or anything, for that matter? I mean, after all, life is basically a series of-of random, absurd, unrelated events not linked in any logical pattern, existing in a complete void that mocks our attempts to impose order and meaning upon it.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, can I have your bagel? When did all this occur to you? Ever since my advanced literature class started its unit on existentialism.
SUPMALE:What's existentialism? He's so young.
LEADMALE:Andy, an existentialist is someone who likes to take their clothes off in public.
LEADFEMALE:Existentialism is a belief that there is no real grand design to life and consequently, no real meaning.
LEADFEMALE:Still, that's no reason for a person to take their clothes off.
LEADFEMALE:It's a shame you're too depressed to eat, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Got some wonderful corn muffins here.
SUPFEMALE:Delicious, yummy, yummy muffins.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody's favorite.
SUPMALE:Mom, they do look good, but-but "while others live to eat, I eat to live.
LEADFEMALE:" Socrates.
LEADFEMALE:"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
LEADFEMALE:" Cap'n Crunch.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:How you doing? - Good.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Lauren.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Lauren.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hey, cut it out! We're trying to eat here! I'm sorry, Andy.
SUPMALE:It's just that Alex and I aren't gonna see each other for a few weeks.
LEADMALE:I'm going to a psychology conference in Detroit.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, why don't you take him along as an exhibit? Lauren, I know how you feel.
LEADMALE:I mean, the only way you could keep me away from Nick for a couple of weeks would be to lock me in my room.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, Steven.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Alex, just because Lauren's gonna be away for a while doesn't mean you're gonna be spending more time at home, does it? I-I got plenty to do.
SUPMALE:I start teaching today.
LEADMALE:Freshman seminar on campus.
LEADFEMALE:Basic applied economic principles of capitalism in the postindustrial era.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, let's hope they have festival seating for that one.
LEADMALE:You know, actually, uh, teaching this class is gonna fulfill all of my requirements for my degree.
SUPFEMALE:Then it's on to graduation.
LEADMALE:Boy, how time does fly.
LEADMALE:Next year at this time, Mallory will be graduating.
SUPMALE:Yeah, hopefully.
SUPMALE:What was that? Happily.
LEADMALE:Happily.
LEADMALE:I'll be graduating happily.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, graduation at Grant College should be a pretty impressive ceremony.
LEADFEMALE:Who's the guest speaker gonna be? Soupy Sales? Very funny, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:They have no plans to invite him back.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I'll see you guys later.
SUPFEMALE:Take good care of Alex for me.
LEADFEMALE:Sure you don't want to take him with you? It's tempting.
LEADMALE:See this, Jen? See this? How could life be absurd when a woman like this can't tear herself from my side? You just proved my point.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you may ask, and, uh, rightfully so, what is economics? Well, let's go to the dictionary.
LEADFEMALE:The word "economics" derives from the Greek oikonamus, meaning a manager of estates' or households' moneys.
LEADMALE:Well, the word money itself derives from the Greek moneta, or the Latin moola.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's go now to our history books.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, miss.
SUPMALE:Me? Uh, yeah, you.
SUPMALE:Do you have any idea what time it is? Uh, well, I've got 6:38.
LEADMALE:I got 11:05.
LEADMALE:Oh, I think you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Find a seat right there, please.
LEADFEMALE:Now, as I was saying, if you go to the history books, you'll see that money was not always used as a method of transaction.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, sorry.
LEADMALE:That was me.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it wasn't me.
OTHERMALE:It was, uh, Wolfgang Hensel singing Die ZauberflÃ te.
SUPFEMALE:Well, miss, just-just do me a favor and just keep it down.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I'm really sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, as I was saying, in ancient times, the barter system was in place and livestock were often used instead of money as a means of exchange.
LEADFEMALE:Now, eventually, the practice was dropped.
LEADMALE:For one thing, barter is an imprecise method of transaction.
SUPFEMALE:For another thing, it's hard to fit a goat in your wallet.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, okay, settle down, people.
SUPFEMALE:But seriously, folks, barter was, uh it was a terrible system.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, now, in the fourth century, the coinage of Oh, boy.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right? I'm fine, really.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:All right, okay, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:That's, uh that's enough for today.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna let you go early so you can, uh, read the first four chapters of your textbook, If You're Rich and You Know It, Clap Your Hands.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
OTHERMALE:I-I'm really sorry for interrupting the class.
LEADFEMALE:I-I really enjoyed your lecture.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I could tell.
LEADFEMALE:I thought your joke was funny, too.
LEADFEMALE:No kidding? You know, I-I got a million of them.
LEADMALE:Um, you ever hear the one, uh, about the quarter that asked the dollar bill out for a date? It was the quar the-the dollar bill says, "Wait a minute, you know, this isn't gonna work.
LEADFEMALE:"Uh, it won't be an equal relationship.
SUPMALE:For one thing, I'm four times bigger than you.
SUPFEMALE:" And-and then the quarter says I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Then the quarter says, "That's okay.
OTHERMALE:I'll bring three friends.
LEADMALE:" Wait, maybe I didn't tell it right.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's not you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not.
LEADMALE:It's just although that's a horrible joke.
LEADMALE:Yeah, my girlfriend doesn't like it, either.
LEADMALE:Neither does my mom.
SUPMALE:Or my sisters.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, maybe it's you know, it's just not a girl's joke.
LEADFEMALE:Although my dad hates it, too.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a really bad joke.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, look, I've got to go.
SUPMALE:Oh, here.
SUPMALE:You all right? Look I'm really sorry.
LEADMALE:Um, just, I-I've been having a really bad week here.
OTHERMALE:Um, Saturday I broke up with my boyfriend, and yesterday I someone stole my bicycle, and today all my cat's hair fell out.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? Her name is Fluffy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have to change it now.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen, um, miss Miss Marty.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Brody.
LEADFEMALE:Marty.
SUPFEMALE:Marty Brody is my Look, I've taken up enough of your time just trying to say my name.
SUPMALE:Thank you for being Thank you for You know, you're so considerate and, uh Next time, I-I promise, no no interruptions.
SUPFEMALE:Just, uh, one more interruption.
LEADMALE:Are you are you available for tutoring? Uh, tutoring? Well, I-I don't know, miss.
LEADMALE:Uh, I've got, you know, my own classes to contend with, and I got, you know, lectures to prepare.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll pay you 15 bucks an hour.
LEADMALE:Wednesday work for you? Wednesday is fine.
SUPMALE:Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Wednesday's my Wednesday's my orchestra rehearsal.
SUPFEMALE:What about what about Thursday? Uh, Thursday? Thursday is my seminar on foreclosing on the elderly.
LEADFEMALE:Orchestra what, are you you're a music major? Oh, see, that's what I wanted to to talk to you about.
LEADMALE:You see, with with all my rehearsals and lessons and theory classes, I-I'm just not gonna have much time for economics.
LEADMALE:Which well, even if I had time for it, I don't I don't like it very much, but then who does, you know? Right.
LEADFEMALE:You do.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, um, how's tomorrow? Tomorrow? Tomorrow actually is good.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great.
SUPMALE:Oh, great, oh Oh, I-I've got to run.
SUPFEMALE:It's 6:38.
SUPMALE:I Oh.
OTHERMALE:What just happened? Coming.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:So, you, uh you ready for your tutoring? Come on in.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:I guess we should get to work.
LEADFEMALE:Um, follow me.
SUPMALE:All right, um Uh, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Miss Brody! I'm scared! Uh, just take a left at the sustain pedal.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I want to thank you for being so sensitive in-in class yesterday.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's all right.
LEADMALE:It's, uh it's a teacher's job to be sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:So how's Fluffy? Oh, not so good.
SUPMALE:It looks like she fell into a tub of Nair.
LEADFEMALE:I think she's in for a slow mating season.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we all know that feeling.
LEADMALE:Is there something wrong? I mean, Fluffy didn't lose any more hair, did she? Oh, no, no, no, she's-she's right there.
LEADMALE:Aah! You should put a hat on that thing.
LEADMALE:I'm a little nervous about this tutoring stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Why? - I don't know.
LEADMALE:I-I'm just not very good with formal academic study.
LEADFEMALE:I-I Sometimes I just don't feel comfortable unless I'm sitting at a piano.
LEADMALE:You are sitting at a piano.
SUPMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:I wish I could play.
SUPMALE:Have you ever tried? Me? No, forget about it.
LEADMALE:No, I am the most unmusical person in the world.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, no, here, I-I can teach you.
OTHERFEMALE:Really, really, sit.
LEADFEMALE:Just name a song you want to learn.
OTHERMALE:This is not gonna work.
OTHERMALE:No, no, it'll be great.
OTHERMALE:Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:Do you know the Bush campaign jingle? No.
LEADMALE:But well, let-let's try this.
OTHERMALE:Gershwin? Ger I love Gershwin! Great.
LEADFEMALE:Now you try it.
LEADFEMALE:It was perfect.
OTHERMALE:Tr-Try again.
LEADMALE:I'm good at this! Never had a lesson.
SUPFEMALE:Yes! Yes! Yes, you did it.
LEADFEMALE:You did it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, we've got our act together.
LEADFEMALE:We should take it on the road.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Miss Brody Marty you play beautifully.
SUPMALE:Well, uh, w-we should get to work, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Uh - Yeah, uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We should, uh we should we should get to work.
SUPMALE:Uh, just go slow till I get the hang of it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:You know, you're gonna love this.
LEADMALE:You're gonna love this.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, now, if we turn to page one of our textbook, we'll see that economics relies on the principles of production and distribution.
OTHERMALE:I'll see you guys later.
SUPMALE:Oh, where are you going, Jen? Uh, I'm going down to the bookstore to get some more material for my existentialism class.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, Jen, while you're there, pick me up a copy of Tummy Tuck Tips.
OTHERFEMALE:It's by Cher.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Jen, Jen, don't you think you're going a little overboard with this, uh, existentialism stuff? I just want to find out the meaning of life.
LEADMALE:Well, did you ever think of asking your parents? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:What's the meaning of life? Elyse? Why do you do this to me? Because you're there.
OTHERFEMALE:I What are you so threatened by, Dad? Is it because, deep down, you're worried that there's no real meaning to life? That it's all just a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing? And that when we die, we're we're condemned to spend eternity in a vast, infinite expanse of nonexistence, confronting what Camus called "the benign indifference of the universe"? Dad, that is a ridiculous and inane rebuttal that only proves my point about the meaninglessness of the universe! Jen, cheer up or you're grounded for the rest of your life.
SUPFEMALE:Something wrong, Alex? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Alex, what is it? What? What do you mean? Come on, Alex, any time you want to speak to me about something that's hard for you to talk about, you sit and sigh until I drag it out of you.
SUPMALE:No, I do not.
LEADMALE:All right, Alex, come on.
LEADMALE:All right, okay.
LEADFEMALE:This is very difficult for me to talk about.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERMALE:I'll help you along.
SUPMALE:I'm confused.
LEADFEMALE:About Marty.
LEADFEMALE:Because Although it's the last thing in the world you wanted, you find yourself attracted to her.
LEADMALE:And You started to develop certain feelings for her that, uh, you can't control.
OTHERMALE:But You have a deep, meaningful relationship with Lauren.
OTHERMALE:Which You wouldn't want to harm in any way.
OTHERMALE:So you're confused, tense and worried.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:You're a good listener.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, it's easy to tell that you've liked Marty for the past week.
LEADMALE:You've spent every minute with her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mal, that was business.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I've been tutoring the girl.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Alex, if anyone tutored me that much, I'd make the dean's list.
LEADFEMALE:Mal, nobody could tutor anybody that much.
SUPMALE:This is stupid! I mean, this is ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:Lauren and I have been seeing each other for a year and a half.
LEADMALE:We love each other very much.
LEADMALE:I mean, Marty, Marty's a terrific girl, and I'm sure, if I wasn't seeing somebody else, you know, we might possibly be good for each other.
LEADFEMALE:But but-but I am.
SUPMALE:So, uh so that is that.
LEADMALE:You sure? Absolutely.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you, you know, this emotional stuff is overrated.
LEADMALE:A little rational, logical thought and everything is resolved.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you sorted that out.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, don't forget, Thursday, we start our unit on squeezing relatives out of the family business.
LEADMALE:Hey, uh hey, you.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:You know, um, uh, Cleo Laine is giving a concert at the Newing Auditorium.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, no kidding? No.
LEADMALE:Who's Cleo Laine? Uh, well, she's one of the greatest, uh, jazz singers in the world.
OTHERMALE:I-I saw her I saw her do Porgy and Bess on Broadway.
LEADMALE:It gave me it gave me the chills.
OTHERMALE:Really? I-I saw Porgy and Bess.
SUPFEMALE:It was performed by the Leland Heights PTA.
LEADFEMALE:Thelma Feinstein as Bess.
SUPMALE:Gave me the hives.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm sure Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Feinstein enjoyed it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, absolutely.
SUPMALE:Well, he was Porgy.
SUPFEMALE:Here, here, here, listen to this.
LEADFEMALE:She's giving a performance tonight, and-and I've got two tickets.
LEADMALE:Do you want to go? Actually, uh, Lauren's coming back tonight, so Oh.
LEADMALE:Well, that's-that's that's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, listen, Marty, we got to talk about this.
SUPMALE:No, no, no, that's okay.
LEADMALE:Um, I'm just gonna I'm gonna go have my legs waxed.
LEADFEMALE:See you.
LEADMALE:Look, we-we can't keep avoiding it! Look, let's just forget this whole thing, okay? I-I can't believe any of this.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you think I feel? I don't know how you feel.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess that's the problem, isn't it? Look, it's not my fault that we've developed an attraction to each other.
SUPMALE:Oh, we've developed an attraction to each other? My God! My God, you are so conceited! What-what what makes you think that I'm that I'm attracted to you? What, what, because we spend a few days together? Big deal.
OTHERFEMALE:And don't forget, I've been paying for you all along, right? You're a you're a kept man.
OTHERMALE:Well, I never.
SUPMALE:I mean, is that all I've been to you just a guy? You know, good for a few laughs and a few nights of cheap tutoring? Well, they weren't all that cheap.
LEADMALE:Weren't all that cheap, huh? All right, why don't I give you your money back, all right? Let me see.
OTHERFEMALE:Seven lessons at-at $15 a shot.
SUPFEMALE:That's $105.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Minus expenses.
LEADMALE:What expenses? What expen? How about that pizza I bought Wednesday night? And-and and my gas money going to and from your dorm? And-and who bought that damn toupee for Fluffy? And this.
LEADMALE:What is this? Open it.
LEADMALE:Alex, Alex, that's It's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it was on sale.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:I have this incredible urge to kiss you.
SUPFEMALE:Should I? Well, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I've got a class soon, and it's already 6:38.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey! - Hey, Lauren, come on in! - Hi.
LEADFEMALE: Long time, no see.
SUPMALE:Hey, Lauren.
SUPMALE:How was your psychology conference? It was great, except for I really missed Alex.
SUPFEMALE:Is he around? - No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't seen him.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't seen him.
LEADMALE:Out of sight, out of mind.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe he's with that other girl! - Andrew! don't know what you're talking about.
LEADFEMALE:You mean Marty.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's told you about her.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, he told me he was tutoring her.
LEADMALE:Oh, he is! - Oh, yeah, yeah, purely business.
SUPFEMALE:Business relationship, yeah.
LEADMALE:He's tutoring her.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE: Oh, look who's home! - Hey, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE: Hi.
LEADMALE:So, did you miss me? Yeah, sure, I did; sure, I did.
SUPFEMALE:You miss me? Well, sure.
LEADMALE:But I did get kind of friendly with a man at the conference who suffered from wide mood swings.
LEADMALE:See, he even signed my Freud anthology.
OTHERFEMALE:"Dear Lauren, it was nice to meet you.
OTHERMALE:P.
SUPFEMALE:S.
OTHERMALE:I can't stand you.
LEADMALE:" Uh, what do you want to do? You want, you want to go get a bite, something like that? No, let's just sit and talk.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, it's been two weeks.
SUPMALE:You know, I think that's the longest we've ever gone without seeing each other.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, not-not-not including the 20 years before we met.
SUPMALE: Alex, are you okay? Yeah, I'm just, I'm like really tired.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you're tired, then I'll just see you tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What? We've always said that we were gonna be completely honest with each other about everything.
SUPMALE:Alex, what is it? This girl that I've been tutoring, you know, from my economics class? Marty? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, we've been spending a lot of time together lately.
LEADMALE: And I would be lying to you if I, if I, if I didn't say that I was thinking about her a lot.
LEADMALE:Do you love her? I don't, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what I feel.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I'm thinking.
SUPMALE:I don't know anything.
LEADMALE:I just need a few days, okay? - Just a little bit of time.
SUPMALE:Okay, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren? Lauren? Are you all right? Of course, I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a trained psychologist.
LEADFEMALE:I know how to handle these types of emotions.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hey, Marty.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Uh, Cecilia, can I get a yogurt? You're too skinny, Marty.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm not very hungry, and besides, I'm a little short of cash.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, it's on me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no no, no, no, I couldn't, really.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:I'm loaded.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, most of it's your money.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, then I'll have a meatball sub, in that case, and some soup, a large salad, uh, the yogurt, some milk, and-and some Twinkies.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:What, are you going into hibernation later today? Alex, we need to talk, so I'm gonna go I'll go get us a table.
LEADMALE:Yeah, all right.
SUPMALE: Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Lauren! Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Cecilia, can I get a yogurt, please? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I'll put it on Alex's tab.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I think we need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get us a table, okay? I don't believe this.
SUPMALE:This is like a bad episode of Love, American Style.
LEADFEMALE:Alex.
LEADMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, there.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see, you had the yogurt and you had the yogurt, the meatball hero, the soup, the milk and the Twinkies.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if that'll be all for you ladies Alex, what's going on? Marty Brodie, this is Lauren Miller.
OTHERMALE: You okay? I'm fine, I'm fine.
SUPMALE:My doctor says I'm not getting enough calcium in my, in my nose.
LEADMALE:LAUREN & 
LEADFEMALE:I think I should go.
LEADFEMALE:No, look, look, I got a better idea, okay? Why don't I go? Alex, don't worry, you can stay, because I'm leaving.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, Lauren, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:You haven't even finished your yogurt.
OTHERFEMALE:I just decided I'm not hungry.
LEADMALE: Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:I paid $1.
OTHERFEMALE:20 for this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Alex, this is terrible.
SUPMALE:I really, I feel horrible.
LEADMALE:I cannot stay here Oh! Alex, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm I'm really hungry.
SUPFEMALE:Did you ever see Fatal Attraction? 
OTHERMALE:Hi, Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Alex.
SUPMALE:Feel like catching a movie? No, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not really in the mood tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we're running late.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
LEADMALE: Bye-bye, Alex.
LEADFEMALE: See you later.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Alex, you okay? Oh, yeah, Dad, I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:Just a little distracted lately with this whole Marty-Lauren thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, look, I'd be more than willing to miss this movie so we can stay and talk.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not really up for it.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I got to stay here and work on my valedictory speech for graduation.
LEADMALE:I can't get a handle on it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you let me know.
SUPMALE:I'll be around.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE: I'm gonna need some quotations to kick this thing off.
LEADMALE:Let's see what we got here.
LEADMALE:Shakespeare Bunch of pretentious guys in tights talking to skulls.
OTHERMALE:Better than my speech.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren's Freud 
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:An Introduction.
LEADFEMALE:Nah, I think too much of myself to read that.
SUPFEMALE:Jean-Paul Sartre.
LEADFEMALE:You know, maybe Jennifer's right.
LEADMALE:Maybe life is absurd.
OTHERMALE: Of course it is! You think I was just trying to sell some books? Jean-Paul, don't take it personally.
LEADMALE:I'm just a little skeptical about this existentialism stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Look at your life.
LEADMALE:If that isn't absurd, I'll buy you a ribs dinner.
SUPMALE: Jean-Paul, you're wrong.
LEADMALE:His life is not absurd.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Dr.
LEADMALE:Freud.
SUPFEMALE:He is just highly sexually repressed.
LEADMALE:Jean-Paul, Sigmund, please, I got a problem I'm trying to work out here.
LEADFEMALE:I have an emotional attachment to two women.
OTHERMALE:It can't be worked out.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, don't you see? Love is an impossibility.
SUPFEMALE:It's nothing more than an attempt to justify one's own existence by possessing another in a futile gesture at warding off the bleakness of death.
LEADFEMALE:And you wonder why you don't get invited to more parties.
SUPMALE:You're wrong, Jean-Paul.
OTHERFEMALE:Love does exist.
LEADMALE:Yeah, back me up on this, will ya, Shakespeare? Uh, Bill? May I call you "Bill"? Please.
LEADFEMALE:As I wrote in Hamlet, about love "Doubt the stars are fire, "doubt that the sun doth move, "doubt truth to be a liar, but never doubt my love.
SUPMALE:" How do we really know you wrote those plays? Guys, guys, guys, come on.
OTHERMALE:Look, we're getting nowhere fast here.
LEADFEMALE:You're supposed to be three of the greatest minds in history.
LEADMALE:You can't help me out? The truth is, Alex, we don't know more about this than anyone else.
LEADFEMALE:In the end, we're all just poor players strutting and fretting our hours upon the stage.
SUPMALE:It's true.
SUPMALE:When it comes to love, as my friend Camus once said, "It can burn, or it can last, but it can't do both.
LEADMALE:" God, that's depressing.
LEADMALE:I want it to do both.
SUPMALE:Hmph! Don't we all? That's why people are so unhappy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm not unhappy.
LEADFEMALE:I would be if I was wearing that outfit.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex all I can say is to thine own self be true.
SUPFEMALE:And remember, you must take responsibility for your own choices in this life.
LEADMALE: Talk to your dad.
OTHERMALE: I should have gone to the movies.
LEADFEMALE: 
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Marty Iook at you at that piano.
LEADFEMALE:You look so right sitting there.
LEADMALE:So joyous, so full of life.
LEADMALE:You look like me filling out the new 1040 short form.
LEADMALE:There's so much I like about you.
LEADMALE:Of all the basic applied economic principles of capitalism in the post- industrial-era seminars in the world, you had to walk into mine.
OTHERMALE:This is crazy.
OTHERMALE:This can't work.
LEADMALE:I'm probably gonna go get a job on Wall Street.
LEADMALE:You've got two whole years of college ahead of you.
LEADMALE:So even though I know this is gonna hurt you, we got to stop kidding ourselves.
SUPMALE:We've got to bring this thing to an end.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never forget the time we spent together.
SUPMALE:The way you hold your knife, the way you sip your tea, the way you changed my life Oh, no, they can't take that away from me.
LEADMALE: Hey, hey, don't stop.
LEADMALE:I-I have to.
LEADFEMALE:It's-it's the end of the song.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just, I'm here practicing for the ceremony.
OTHERFEMALE:I've gotta, I've gotta practice the old "Pomp and Circumstance.
SUPMALE:" Oh, yeah? How's it going? Well, I've got the pomp down, it's-it's the circumstance that's giving me a little trouble.
LEADFEMALE:We got to talk about this, Marty.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know, Alex.
OTHERMALE:I-I've been thinking, and, uh, you know, even though I know this is gonna hurt you, I-I think that we've got to stop kidding ourselves and we've got to end this.
SUPMALE:After everything we've been through? Alex, really, the last thing I want to do is break your heart.
LEADMALE:Aah! Aah! Aah! It's a little late for that now, isn't it? Alex I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please.
SUPMALE:Can I just have a minute to be alone with my thoughts? I hope he doesn't start to cry.
SUPFEMALE: I'm not crying.
SUPMALE:There's something in my eye.
OTHERFEMALE: Excuse me? 
OTHERMALE:There's something in my eye.
LEADMALE: Do you want a tissue? Marty, Professor Heller needs you to look over the arrangement for the processional.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know you do.
LEADMALE:Good-bye, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPMALE:Bye, Miss Brodie.
SUPMALE: Oh, Lauren.
OTHERMALE:Two years such a long time.
LEADMALE:And there's been a lot of good times in those two years.
LEADMALE:Remember the first time we met? In that little psychology lab? It was really love.
SUPFEMALE:You were so beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you are so beautiful.
LEADMALE:I'm not so bad myself.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what happened to us.
OTHERMALE:But whatever it is, I've got to admit my true feelings.
SUPMALE:And be honest with you.
LEADMALE:And I know it's probably gonna crush you.
LEADFEMALE: And yet you seem to be handling it pretty well.
LEADMALE:I just have to be honest with her.
LEADMALE:Just tell her that she's a wonderful, decent, intelligent, unique individual.
LEADMALE:And that we're not in love anymore.
LEADFEMALE: Lauren.
SUPMALE:Hi, Alex.
OTHERMALE:Uh, can I talk to you for a minute? Sure.
LEADMALE:Excuse us.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren, I got to be honest with you.
SUPFEMALE:I have to be honest with you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, you're a wonderful, intelligent, decent, honest, unique individual.
LEADFEMALE:But we're not in love anymore.
LEADMALE:Nobody lets me get a word in edgewise.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, the last couple of days have been torture for me.
SUPMALE:I've been trying to 
SUPMALE:What did I do to make you stop loving me? Was it something I said or was it something I did or? Was it that I was just trying too hard? And then I realized it was nothing I did, and nothing you did it just happened.
SUPFEMALE:And it's wrong for me to try to be something that I'm not.
LEADMALE:The same goes for you, Alex.
LEADMALE:You're an obsessive person.
LEADFEMALE:You don't love many things, but the things you love, you really love.
SUPMALE:And either you love me or you don't.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you really know me.
OTHERMALE:I do.
SUPFEMALE:And I know myself.
SUPFEMALE:And I got to admit something to you.
LEADMALE:The other day when Marty was giving a recital at Delaware Hall, I went and I just wanted to see what the attraction was.
LEADMALE:I also brought some rotten tomatoes, just in case.
OTHERMALE:I sat there listening and I I saw she-she's a real artist.
OTHERFEMALE:She's kind of bohemian, and she's very exotic.
SUPFEMALE:And I can't compete with that.
LEADFEMALE:Lauren, you don't have to.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm not.
LEADMALE:I'm not I know who I am and I like myself.
SUPMALE:I'm intelligent, I'm attractive.
SUPMALE:And I'm a good person.
SUPMALE:But I'm not her.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm not gonna make believe that I can be.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go on with my life and find someone who loves me just as much as I love him.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever happens I just want you to know that I can't be happy unless I know that you're happy.
SUPMALE:I really like you.
LEADFEMALE:And, um, we had a lot of great times together.
SUPMALE:I want you to know that part of who I am I mean one of the best parts is what you gave me.
LEADMALE: You gave me a lot, too, Alex.
LEADMALE:I really love to tell you that I hope you and Marty make a great couple, but, um, I really can't.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well uh, the crazy thing is Marty and I aren't gonna be seeing each other either.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? I think I got to take some time to be with myself.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'll go to New York and, uh, get a job on Wall Street.
LEADFEMALE:Try and meet Leona Helmsley.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Lauren.
SUPFEMALE: What next? Huh? Locusts? Boils? Democrats in '92? Am I interrupting anything? 
LEADMALE:Mommy, my gown doesn't fit.
OTHERMALE:It's okay.
SUPMALE:Your hat's no bargain either.
LEADMALE:Let's-let's fix this.
LEADFEMALE:This is just like when you were a little boy.
SUPMALE:Couldn't get yourself dressed then either.
LEADFEMALE:You'd come out of your room with your shirt buttoned the wrong way, and your pants on backwards.
SUPFEMALE:Although always with a tie.
LEADMALE:You'd come into the kitchen, I'd say, "Alex, did you even look at yourself in the mirror?" And I'd say, "I couldn't Mallory took it to school.
SUPMALE:" What I wouldn't give to be eight years old again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're still dressing about the same.
SUPMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's get this hat for you, okay, um You know, moms were a good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, no matter what else is happening, no matter what anybody else is doing you're just always there for me.
LEADMALE:Well, we'll see.
SUPMALE: Okay.
SUPMALE:Let's try this.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPFEMALE:Front.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hey, great, you did it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mom, you could give up architecture and go into tailoring.
LEADMALE:Mom? Hey, Mom, I'm only kidding, you know.
SUPMALE:You're a wonderful architect.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, it's not that.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't believe my little boy's graduating.
LEADMALE:You look very handsome.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well It's a good thing 'cause inside, I don't feel too terrific.
LEADMALE:Been a tough couple of weeks for you, hasn't it, honey? The worst.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, if you were eight years old again, I'd just kiss your boo-boo and make it better.
LEADFEMALE:But you're an adult now and that's, uh, that's a little more complex.
SUPMALE:I say we give it a shot.
LEADMALE:I love you so much, honey.
LEADFEMALE: Hey, you guys, come on, break it up.
SUPFEMALE:You got to sit down, graduation's starting.
SUPFEMALE:Well, can you give us a minute? We were just discussing the meaning of life.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's easy.
OTHERFEMALE:Be happy, try not to hurt other people and hope that you fall in love.
LEADFEMALE:It sounds good to me.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:Considering the source, that's truly frightening.
OTHERFEMALE:Well 
LEADFEMALE:So this is it college is finally over.
LEADMALE:Fortunately, it ends on a real high note for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Broke up with two wonderful women on the same day.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, maybe Jen really is right.
SUPMALE:Maybe life is absurd.
SUPFEMALE:Still, it has its moments.
LEADFEMALE:Even the painful ones.
OTHERFEMALE:Lauren this was a tough day for both of us.
SUPFEMALE:Still I don't regret one single moment we had together.
SUPFEMALE:And Marty, even if I never see you ever again, you'll always be a beautiful, wonderful memory.
SUPMALE:You know, Jen, your pal Jean-Paul Sartre once said, "Hell is other people.
LEADMALE:" Well, anybody who's seen a few game shows knows what he means.
SUPMALE:But I think he's only half-right.
LEADFEMALE:Because Heaven is other people, too.
LEADMALE:I mean, after all, when you get right down to it, we are all we've got.
OTHERFEMALE:And no matter how much we may argue or fight or hurt one another, in the end, we just keep running back for more because we're human.
SUPMALE:And for some strange, unexplainable reason, we need each other.
LEADMALE:And maybe that's the only real wisdom any of us will ever have.
LEADMALE:That and the words of another very great philosopher who just happens to be my sister Mallory, I 
LEADMALE:"The meaning of life is to be happy, "try not to hurt other people and hope you fall in love.
LEADFEMALE:" It's ironic.
LEADFEMALE:After all these years of learning, Mallory teaches me the most important lesson of all.
SUPMALE:Boy, life is funny sometimes, isn't it? so now I present to you the valedictorian of the class of 1989, Alex P.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Gabardine.
OTHERFEMALE:That's uncanny.
SUPMALE:Incredible.
LEADFEMALE:Um, here, let me try.
OTHERMALE:Let me Poplin.
LEADMALE:How does she do it? Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Let me try.
SUPMALE:It's polyester! Hey, hey, is everybody okay? It sounds like someone's being tortured in here.
OTHERFEMALE:I was; they made me touch polyester.
SUPMALE:It was disgusting.
LEADMALE:Hey, that's my favorite tie.
LEADFEMALE:What's in the box, Alex? Something for you, buddy.
LEADMALE:What is it? Well, I-I'm not gonna tell you; you got to guess.
LEADMALE:But I'll give you a few clues, okay? Let me see.
LEADMALE:It's alive, it repeats what it's told, and it spends most of its time behind bars.
LEADFEMALE:That's not fair, Alex.
LEADMALE:That could be anyone in the Reagan administration.
SUPFEMALE:No, it is a parakeet! - Oh! - Oh, this is great! Wow.
SUPMALE:Wow, I've never had a parakeet before! Now, the guy at the pet store said it can be trained to, uh, to climb stairs, to ring a bell, to play dead, and it can speak over 300 different words.
OTHERMALE:That's 50 more than you.
LEADMALE:When he can coordinate separates, Alex, you call me.
OTHERFEMALE:Here you go.
OTHERMALE:I want to go upstairs and show him my room.
OTHERMALE:Okay, be careful.
SUPMALE:All right, you do that.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hey! You're home, uh, kind of late from school, aren't you? Yeah, I stayed after to go over some things with my Natural Science teacher, Mrs.
SUPMALE:McGreevy.
LEADMALE:We've got this terrific new unit we're studying.
LEADMALE:Nowhere to run, nowhere hide.
SUPFEMALE:" Sounds fascinating.
LEADMALE:Oh, it really is.
LEADFEMALE:It's all about how the earth's ecological systems are being upset by man's stupid interference.
LEADFEMALE:See, look, we even have this map on the, on the world's most endangered areas.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute, let me see that.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm safe.
SUPFEMALE:What's for dinner? No, you're not safe, Alex.
LEADMALE:You see, the world is one big, living organism, and everyone in it is in danger.
LEADFEMALE:You see, we're destroying the rain forests in Brazil, the wildlife in Madagascar, and-and the ozone layer over the South Pole.
SUPMALE:Do you know what that means? Of course I do.
LEADFEMALE:It means those are bad places to invest in time-share condos.
LEADMALE:It's too bad, too, 'cause the South Pole was a real comer.
LEADMALE:No, it means that money grubbers are destroying the world for profit.
LEADMALE:That's our girl who said that.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, I happen to like money grubbers.
LEADFEMALE:That's our boy said that.
LEADMALE:Come on, face it, Jen.
OTHERMALE:There's just a price to be paid for progress.
LEADMALE:But how high a price, Alex? I mean, the climate is changing.
LEADMALE:You know, we're headed for one long, hot, endless summer.
SUPFEMALE:What will I do with all my dark colors? God, Elyse, this is, this is just like the old days.
SUPMALE:Remember when we celebrated the first Earth Day? How could I ever forget? As you may know, your father and I played crucial roles in saving the wombat.
LEADMALE:There isn't a wombat alive today that'll forget us.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, but all these have to go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, too.
LEADFEMALE:What-what are they? Things I found around the house that are harmful to the environment.
LEADMALE:I mean, if we're gonna save the planet, then we're gonna have to become much more ecologically aware around here.
LEADMALE:Oh, I didn't realize we had so much of this stuff.
OTHERMALE:It's so easy to become complacent.
LEADFEMALE:But Jen's right, it's got to go.
SUPFEMALE:Especially this.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, that's my hair conditioner! Mallory, it has formaldehyde.
OTHERFEMALE:It gets into our water supply and, along with a bunch of other contaminants, kills our fish and-and will destroy the entire aquatic ecosystem.
SUPMALE:What good is an ecosystem if I have split ends? Mallory, you can use another brand.
LEADMALE:Hope your ecosystems are happy.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Let's-let's face it, gang.
SUPFEMALE:Even though some of these things make our lives easier, I'm sure we can do without them.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we just have to find some safe alternatives.
LEADMALE:Now, who's gonna help me make the tofu tacos? Wait, Mom, you aren't gonna use the stove, are you? Well, sure.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? Well, Mom, gas stoves give off carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide gases.
LEADMALE:I mean, those are both major pollutants.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we don't have to pollute to eat.
SUPFEMALE:Tofu tacos are just as good cold.
LEADMALE:I-I'd eat them any way you serve them, dear.
SUPMALE:Fortunately, I have a ham sandwich left over from last night's takeout.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I can't believe you did that.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I'll eat the cold tofu.
LEADFEMALE:No, you accepted that container and supported the production of polystyrene foam.
LEADMALE:I didn't mean it, I swear.
LEADMALE:Do you know what happens when that container breaks down? It gives off chemicals that have caused a hole in the ozone layer the size of the continental United States.
SUPFEMALE:You're absolutely right.
OTHERMALE:Elyse, how many times have I told you this damn polystyrene foam is a hazard? Let's get rid of this stuff! Let's get it out of here right now! Well, Dad, you just can't throw it away.
OTHERMALE:Well, uh I can't.
LEADMALE:Of course not.
SUPMALE:What was I thinking? We'll put it on the lawn and make an example of it.
SUPFEMALE:No, you just can't put it in the trash because it's not biodegradable.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, eventually, it'll poison our neighborhood soil and groundwater.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:You leave me no choice.
LEADFEMALE:I'll build an atom smasher.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, forget it.
LEADMALE:M-Maybe there's no answer.
LEADFEMALE:Well, in that case, I'll just be using my hair conditioner.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to talk to you about the Brazilian rain forests.
OTHERFEMALE:As you may have read, we're burning down the rain forests and-and killing whole species in the process.
LEADFEMALE:And not just the big animals that get all the publicity, like-like tigers and monkeys, but little guys like you, who shouldn't be brushed aside just so someone can build another polluted, ugly highway.
LEADMALE:I mean, I really hate that.
LEADFEMALE:And I know you do, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Dickey wants a cracker.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, but they use fossil fuels for baking them.
SUPMALE:Oh, Jen, you'll never guess what we found.
LEADFEMALE:An incredible store that sells nothing but nonpolluting, nontoxic, nonhazardous products.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds great, Dad.
SUPMALE:Mallory even found something in the vegetable cosmetic department.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I got eggplant eyeliner, lentil lip gloss and rutabaga rouge.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm gonna put them on right now.
LEADFEMALE:And then maybe I'll eat them.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, wait, there's something in there - I want to show Jen.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, Mom, it's probably the beet blush.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just I'll show that to you later.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, it's the, uh, um Oh, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Where did this come from? All right.
LEADFEMALE:I ran across the street to Pollutants "R" Us, okay? Nice try.
SUPFEMALE:Fine! You want my hair au naturel? I'll just go stick my head in the crisper! How was your day, honey? All right, I guess.
OTHERFEMALE:I just watched some TV.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what about your tree-planting rally to remedy the greenhouse effect? Wasn't that today? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I called it off though.
LEADMALE:Why? I thought that was a terrific idea.
SUPMALE:I started to think that these problems are just too big.
LEADMALE:I mean, every day, more and more forests are being destroyed, more ultraviolet rays are getting through, and the Earth is just getting hotter and hotter.
LEADMALE:I know, I watched The Weather Channel all day, and the temperature just kept going up and up.
SUPMALE:You know, Jennifer, look, we understand what you're going through.
OTHERMALE:It's easy to get depressed when you see what's happening to the world, but we just want you to know you should feel free to talk to us about any of this.
OTHERFEMALE:We're on your side.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Dad, but there's nothing to talk about.
LEADMALE:I mean, talking doesn't solve anything.
LEADMALE:Look, you know, m-maybe we've all been focusing too much on this environmental thing, huh? Let's just get it off our minds for a while and relax.
SUPFEMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we watch some TV.
LEADMALE:I'll make some popcorn.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe there'll be a game on.
SUPMALE:Oh, there is! Uh, Yanks and the Indians.
SUPMALE:What do you say, Jen? Come on.
LEADMALE:Okay, any-anything but The Weather Channel.
LEADFEMALE:It's depressing.
LEADMALE:You got it.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's see what we got here, honey.
LEADFEMALE:And now for today's news update.
LEADFEMALE:All right, this game should be on any minute.
SUPMALE:Good evening.
SUPMALE:Rescue and cleanup efforts continue tonight in Prince William Sound in an attempt to contain the damage caused by the massive oil spill from a supertanker.
SUPFEMALE:God, I can't watch this.
SUPMALE:Unfortunately, some experts predict that the effects of the spill may now be irreversible, as numbers of oil-soaked birds, otters and fish wash ashore.
SUPMALE:Turn it off.
SUPFEMALE:I can't watch this.
OTHERFEMALE:I think Jennifer is getting entirely out of hand with all this ecological business.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I got to admit, I do miss Mallory's old hair conditioner.
LEADMALE:All right, listen, Jennifer's gone completely over the edge.
LEADMALE:And I'm surprised, because I thought if anyone in this family was gonna flip out, would've been Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that hurts.
SUPMALE:Especially coming from somebody who looks like they've just been electrocuted.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:That's the, that's the third time he's done that.
LEADMALE:And yesterday, he called George Bush a bird-brain.
SUPMALE:I wonder how Southern fried parakeet tastes.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I really am really am worried about Jennifer.
OTHERFEMALE:When I try to talk to her, all she gives me are statistics.
LEADMALE:More statistics she gives, the more depressed she seems to get.
SUPMALE:I'm worried, too.
OTHERFEMALE:She makes me wear sunscreen when I go outside.
SUPFEMALE:At night.
LEADMALE:Yeah, she won't come downstairs anymore 'cause she's worried about the radon gas buildup on the first floor.
SUPMALE:I mean, she won't even think about going into the basement.
SUPFEMALE:How would we know if there's radon in the basement? Well, I'm sure we could find out, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:But if we were coal miners, I suppose we'd take a canary down with us because, uh, the gas would affect the canary first.
SUPFEMALE:Alex! - Alex! What? I I was just gonna take Dickey for a walkie.
LEADFEMALE:I-I hope we're not overreacting here.
SUPMALE:Jennifer's always been a very sensitive girl, and it's easy to get emotional about the environment.
LEADMALE:Oh, I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure it'll pass.
LEADFEMALE:See? It's good to see you, Jen.
LEADMALE:That is you, isn't it? Jen, I don't think that mask goes with those pajamas.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-mm.
SUPFEMALE:It's one degree hotter today than it was in 1956.
SUPFEMALE:Jen, shouldn't you be dressed? You're supposed to be in school in half an hour.
OTHERMALE:I don't really feel like going today, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Um, say, Alex, would you mind, uh, doing Andy's carpool and dropping Mallory off at school, too? I'm not, uh, ready to leave just yet.
LEADMALE:Sure, Dad.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mal, we'll fit you - Yeah, have a good day.
SUPMALE:Attaboy, buddy.
SUPMALE:fit you in the car somehow and just stick your head through the sunroof.
LEADFEMALE:Good day, you guys.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Dad.
LEADMALE:Uh, Jennifer, your mom and I would like to talk to you a minute.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Um we're a little worried about, uh, the way you're dealing with this, uh, ecology issue.
LEADMALE:You mean how I'm dealing with the end of the world.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:You're not handling it well.
LEADFEMALE:Who could? I mean It really makes everything we do seem really stupid and pointless.
LEADMALE:I mean, why go to school? Why have a career? Or why raise a family? It's all gonna be over in a few years anyway.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's all hopeless.
LEADMALE:Honey, it-it's not hopeless.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you just don't seem to really be able to open up to us very much.
SUPMALE:Maybe you should talk to someone else.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe-maybe the school counselor, you know? I'm sure he's dealt with this before.
OTHERFEMALE:Dealt with what? No, these problems are not in my head.
LEADMALE:They're real.
SUPMALE:I-I have written documents.
LEADFEMALE:Now-now, if you guys want to ignore all the horrible things that are going on in this world, then you need to see the school counselor, not me.
SUPMALE:Look, we're not ignoring the facts, we're not denying the problems.
LEADFEMALE:But our most important problem is your health.
LEADFEMALE:And this is taking too much of a toll on you.
LEADMALE:It's got to stop.
LEADMALE:I really think you should see the counselor.
LEADFEMALE:All right, fine.
OTHERMALE:I-I'll go see him.
SUPFEMALE:But he's gonna find out that I'm a normal 16-year-old student with realistic concerns.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and if his radon level is over 4.
LEADMALE:0, I'm out of there.
LEADFEMALE:So this portion of the Eastern seaboard has been completely devastated by acid rain.
LEADMALE:Not to mention the environmental catastrophe that European forests have suffered from lack of industrial controls.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, I'm sure that that's all true, and we all realize that the environment is a, is a big issue.
SUPMALE:But I'd like to digress just for a moment, if we could? Let's talk about your social life.
SUPFEMALE:You like boys? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially boys who don't burn fossil fuels.
LEADFEMALE:Pardon me? Well, drive.
LEADMALE:Cars burn fossil fuels.
LEADFEMALE:I like boys who don't drive, because they don't pollute.
LEADMALE:See, car emissions are leaving a layer of carbon dioxide above the Earth that'll eventually trap the heat and cook us.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, so you like boys.
LEADFEMALE:What about, uh, sports? Music? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Hilgenburg, I don't see what this has to do with anything.
SUPFEMALE:I am concerned about what is happening to our environment, and I think I have reason to be.
SUPFEMALE:What I'm trying to get at, Jennifer, is that what you're saying may be true, but you seem to be obsessed by it.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm not obsessed.
SUPFEMALE:Look, it's perfectly normal at your age.
OTHERMALE:The same thing happens to students when they're exposed to violently graphic safe driving films or explicit information about the effects of nuclear war.
LEADFEMALE:They tend to dwell on it.
LEADMALE:The important thing for you to remember is that your fears are more debilitating than the actual problem.
SUPMALE:You know, it may be with a car accident or a nuclear war, because that might never happen.
LEADFEMALE:But right this minute, we are surrounded by a zillion different life-threatening influences.
LEADMALE:Like what? Okay, well, let's take a look at your office.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:I've already mentioned the radon level.
OTHERFEMALE:How about microwaves? From where? Well, from your computer terminal.
SUPMALE:It looks innocent enough, but studies show that waves similar to the waves given off by video display terminals can alter fetal development in animals.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know that.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but come on.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, how many animals use computers, right? Did I mention the electromagnetic waves it emits? I mean, it's been shown that the government's acceptable exposure limits are exceeded by merely touching the screen or sides of the terminal.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I never really learned how to use this thing anyway.
LEADMALE:Or how about the air conditioner? It's spewing ozone-destroying Freon gas into the atmosphere as we speak.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we shut this thing off.
OTHERFEMALE:I haven't even covered the contaminants in our drinking water.
SUPMALE:Causing these big, horrible tumors in our fish.
LEADFEMALE:Or how about the ultraviolet rays that are pouring through this window right now? Okay! Stop! What's wrong? I can't take this.
LEADFEMALE:You're depressing me.
LEADMALE:Well, I am sorry, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Hilgenburg.
SUPMALE:I didn't mean to.
LEADMALE:Well, you did.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I-I was having a perfectly nice day, and then you come into my office, and you tell me that everything around me is hazardous.
OTHERFEMALE:And I believe you.
SUPMALE:I was just giving you the facts.
SUPFEMALE:The facts are bleak, they're terrifying, they're horrible.
SUPFEMALE:Let's face it, it's over.
SUPMALE:You're some counselor.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm new.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look, I wouldn't exactly say that it's over.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no? Well, if it's not, prove it to me.
OTHERMALE:What can we do to possibly change anything? Come in.
OTHERFEMALE:Stephen, listen.
LEADMALE:The whales.
SUPMALE:It's our song.
SUPFEMALE:My God, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:That's "Humpbacks by Moonlight.
LEADFEMALE:" We haven't heard that in years.
LEADFEMALE:Must have been hard to slow-dance to.
SUPMALE:Try humming it.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Hilgenburg called.
SUPMALE:He's feeling better, but, uh he's thinking of moving to New Zealand.
SUPMALE:Gosh, I didn't mean to upset him like that.
LEADFEMALE:He looked terrible.
LEADFEMALE:He-he was pale and tense.
LEADFEMALE:I made the school counselor go see the school nurse.
SUPMALE:Well, look on the bright side.
SUPFEMALE:You made him aware.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you've-you've rekindled our commitment.
SUPMALE:Things have changed for the better around here.
SUPMALE:With the exception of your mother's reckless use of the gas stove.
LEADFEMALE:But you guys weren't there.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you didn't see the look on his face when he asked me, "What can we do?" And I didn't have an answer for him.
SUPFEMALE:There-there is no easy answer, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, when we first became interested in saving the Earth, well, we didn't know anything about the ozone problem, and the rain forests seemed relatively safe.
LEADFEMALE:But the stuff that we did know about um, air and water pollution and-and saving the whales well, no one else seemed to really care about it.
LEADMALE:It was all just the beginning, and everyone thought it was made up by-by hippies and crackpots.
LEADMALE:But the problems are so much worse now.
LEADMALE:That's why they need more commitment.
LEADMALE:You can't allow yourself to get overwhelmed.
SUPMALE:You are so bright, you're so aware.
LEADMALE:We can't afford to lose you in the struggle.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't know if I could really make a difference.
LEADMALE:What about the effect you had on Mr.
SUPMALE:Hilgenburg? I made him move to an island with sheep.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that probably would've happened anyway.
LEADMALE:Look, you can make a difference.
LEADMALE:But you don't have to do it by yourself.
SUPFEMALE:There are organizations you can join.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, maybe you want to become a member of, uh, Sierra Club or Greenpeace.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, someday you may head up Greenpeace.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'd like that.
OTHERMALE:That way, I know my grandchildren's world is in safe hands.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, we tested the basement, and there's no radon.
SUPMALE:So you can come downstairs now.
SUPMALE:Also, you'll be happy to know I found a conditioner that's ecologically safe and provides the luster and sheen that my hair's grown accustomed to.
LEADFEMALE:There is hope.
SUPFEMALE:I taught Dickey how to say something.
SUPFEMALE:Dickey, say it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Dickey, say it, Dickey.
LEADFEMALE:Save the planet.
LEADMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do my best.
LEADFEMALE:Well, ready for our weekly recycling run? Other families go on picnics; we go to the dump.
SUPFEMALE:It's not a dump, Alex, it's a recycling center.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, it's like a-a shopping mall for garbage.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, exciting.
SUPFEMALE:Why do we recycle everything? Why don't we just throw it away? Well, let's see.
SUPMALE:When we recycle something, that means we can use things over and over again.
SUPMALE:The Earth has limited resources, and if we don't recycle them, we use them up.
LEADFEMALE:For example, Andy, look at these newspapers.
LEADFEMALE:You have any idea where they came from? From the newsstand? No, from trees.
LEADMALE:And did you know if we simply recycled a Sunday run of The New York Times, we would save 75,000 trees? Yeah, lots of things in the house can be recycled, Andy.
SUPFEMALE:Aluminum cans.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, glass bottles.
LEADFEMALE:And there's another reason for recycling, Andy.
LEADMALE:The city's landfills are overflowing.
SUPFEMALE:We-we could burn the trash, but that costs too much and gives off too much toxic smoke.
SUPFEMALE:So the only alternative is to recycle our own garbage, and put an end to toxic and environmental pollution.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, sometimes they give you money for the stuff.
SUPMALE:So recycling will always be a part of this family's life.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:And every once in a while, - we can go on a picnic, too.
SUPFEMALE:You got it! - Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Go.
LEADFEMALE:That's mine, buddy.
SUPMALE:Come on, babe.
OTHERMALE:Come on, darling.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE: Freeze! Where do you think you're going? Uh, no place, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:We're just, uh, trying to break in our coats.
LEADFEMALE:But we were supposed to all be here tonight to share this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, not another Woodstock slide show where you guys spend the evening trying to spot yourselves among among a sea of long hair and beards.
SUPFEMALE:  Jennifer, we once spotted a blonde speck in that crowd that was definitely your mother.
LEADFEMALE:That's not what we're doing tonight.
SUPFEMALE:What are we doing tonight? You're helping me make a time capsule for school.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that sounds neat what are you gonna put in it? I'm gonna put stuff about our family.
SUPFEMALE:Can you put Alex in there? I could try.
OTHERMALE:So if you have any mementos that remind you of growing up, put them in there.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh, I actually have the first dollar I ever earned.
LEADMALE:Uh, and I'll sell it to you for 25 bucks.
LEADMALE:You sure you can't put Alex in there? Maybe if we let some of the hot air out of him, he'll fit.
LEADMALE:So what do you got in here so far, Andy? - I got my baby boots.
LEADMALE:Oh Yeah, you know, I've got mine bronzed which made it really tough to walk.
OTHERMALE:Look, our old color slides.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, the slides! - No slides.
LEADMALE:I thought you kids loved my slide shows.
SUPMALE:You used to sit there, staring at them, eyes wide open.
SUPFEMALE:No, Dad, we learned to sleep that way.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you guys can watch this.
LEADFEMALE:You look ridiculous.
SUPMALE:Half a million people trying to stop a senseless war.
SUPFEMALE:You find that ridiculous? I'm talking about the outfits.
LEADFEMALE:I'm dying, I'm dying.
LEADFEMALE:Promise me you'll never show these when my friends are here.
LEADFEMALE:Promise or I'm leaving home right now.
LEADMALE:Mallory, that was history in the making.
LEADFEMALE:There were people every state in the union at that protest.
LEADFEMALE:What were you protesting good grooming? Mommy, you look so pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Like an Indian princess.
LEADFEMALE:That's your father, dear.
OTHERMALE:There I am.
LEADFEMALE: There you go.
LEADFEMALE:You look almost as pretty as Daddy.
LEADMALE:Daddy, how long ago was that? That was very long ago.
LEADFEMALE:In a galaxy far, far away.
LEADFEMALE:All right, who wants to see - the Peace Corps slides? -  You know, this is fun, and it's a great way to clean out my closet.
LEADMALE:Do you have room for six pairs of Earth Shoes, a mood ring and a pet rock? Why were you guys always protesting stuff? Well, I think it was just the times.
SUPFEMALE:There was a lot to be upset about, you know? War, the government.
LEADMALE:Not being able to drag a comb through your hair.
LEADMALE:Don't listen to your brother, Andy.
OTHERMALE:If he'd been older, he would've loved the '60s.
LEADMALE:Mom, the only way I could've enjoyed the '60s would be if my headband had been too tight, I had lost consciousness and woke up in the '80s.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I seem to remember your getting involved in a protest or two.
LEADMALE: That's right, Andy, and it was for a good cause, too The Equal Rights Amendment.
LEADFEMALE:Alex? No, it was for a better cause than that.
LEADMALE:It was for a girl.
LEADFEMALE:Deep in our hearts We do believe We shall not be moved today.
LEADMALE: - All right! That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Sing it! It's important.
SUPMALE:Are you okay? No, not really.
LEADMALE:Look, Deena, I cannot go on with this any longer.
OTHERMALE:I-I-I'm not really Alex, that was a very courageous thing you did, coming to Dorothy's defense like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, thanks, but, uh, listen, about this whole ERA business, this-this this button, this-this shirt it's not Is that a scratch on your ear? Yeah, but it's nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, those animals.
LEADMALE:Alex, I don't think I've ever been as attracted to anybody as I am to you right now.
LEADFEMALE:So, what is it you wanted to tell me? Don't remember.
SUPMALE:I think it was a trivia question.
SUPMALE:Isn't this romantic? The two of us in prison together.
SUPMALE:Alex, I want to think you for coming to my defense.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm very impressed with your passion for the movement.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, Dorothy, it was a privilege to come to your aid.
LEADMALE:I mean, I-I regret I have but one ear to give to the cause.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, when you talk like that, I can barely keep my hands off you.
SUPMALE:But-but those are just idle words.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there is a job to be done here.
LEADMALE:Yes, there is.
SUPFEMALE:Right on! You know, and not only by us, but by women everywhere.
LEADMALE: Yeah, tell 'em! How long must we wait? How long are we expected to accept these indignities? How long, Lord?  You know, I feel the way President Kennedy must've felt that day at the Berlin wall, when he said, "Today I am a Berliner.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, today in this cell, I say to you, "I am a woman.
SUPMALE:"  
LEADFEMALE:Alex definitely turns up in the most unlikely places.
SUPFEMALE:"His mother put him to bed, and made some chamomile tea, and she gave a dose of it to Peter.
LEADMALE:" See? Right there.
LEADMALE:"One tablespoon full to be taken at bedtime.
SUPMALE:"But Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail, "who are good little bunnies, had bread and milk and blackberries for supper.
LEADFEMALE:" There, see? These are blackberries.
LEADFEMALE:Read it again, Mommy.
LEADMALE:Give it a break, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:She read it three times.
LEADFEMALE: Hey, come on, Andy and I love to read together.
OTHERFEMALE:"And then Mr.
LEADMALE:Reagan said "'Oh, look, Mommy, "It's Secretary of State It's Secretary of State George Shultz.
LEADFEMALE:" Boy, Andrew, this I Love Republicans pop-up book was the best purchase I ever made.
SUPFEMALE:Make Nancy wave again.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What is this word right here? "Impeach.
LEADFEMALE:" Isn't that sweet? It really is.
SUPMALE:You know, sometimes I think we're too harsh on Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:He-he's not just a callous archconservative Republican.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes he can be a warm, loving son and brother.
LEADFEMALE: "I am not a crook.
SUPFEMALE:" 
SUPMALE:The one thing you don't want to see, though, is a book in Mallory's hands.
LEADFEMALE:"But I reckon I got to light out "for the territory ahead of the rest because Aunt Sally, "she's gonna adopt me and civilize me and I can't stand it I've been there before.
SUPFEMALE:" Mal, is that you? What are you doing? I'm reading.
SUPMALE:When did you learn how? When I found out that Cosmopolitan magazine was banned in certain places, I became enraged.
SUPMALE:Then I saw Huckleberry Finn sitting on the coffee table, and I said to myself, "What better way to show Jennifer my support?" So I picked it up and I started reading and you know what? I love it.
LEADFEMALE:I love reading I'm gonna teach Nick how to read.
SUPFEMALE: Mallory did a great job of it.
LEADFEMALE:"The little engine looked at the hill and said, 'I think I can.
SUPFEMALE:"'  "I think I can.
LEADFEMALE:" "I think I can.
LEADMALE:" This is getting pretty exciting, huh? I wonder what happens next? He gets up the hill, Nick.
OTHERMALE:I got a few things from my own personal collection.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, that's way too big.
OTHERMALE:What's in there, your ego? Andy, I'm gonna give you my favorite baby toy.
LEADFEMALE:She knew how to feather her hair before she even had any.
LEADMALE:And this is the English textbook that I used to help Nick get his high school equivalency diploma.
LEADFEMALE: Yeah, yeah, you, uh, you were a lot of help.
SUPFEMALE:What is a verb? What does it do in a sentence? Uh, it just kind of sits there, trying not to bother the other words.
SUPMALE:Come on, Nick.
OTHERMALE:A verb is a word that does something active in a sentence, like walk or run or eat.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but, um, eating's not active.
OTHERFEMALE:Unless you eat and run.
LEADMALE:Well, you don't have to be moving to be active.
SUPFEMALE:You just have to be doing something.
OTHERFEMALE:Well what about if you're dead? I mean, you can't be active when you're dead, unless you're a ghost or a vampire.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you can use verbs for ghosts and vampires.
LEADMALE:Uh, just not for ordinary dead people, huh? I'm gonna have to look that up, I think they have special verbs for them.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is without a doubt, the most inane and absurd conversation I've ever heard.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, what are you doing here? What am I do well, I'm not "doing" anything, so I guess I'll need one of those special verbs.
LEADFEMALE:Like you use for dead people.
SUPFEMALE: Did Nick graduate? Yes, Andy, Nick did graduate  What was that, honey? With Alex's help.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
OTHERMALE:And it was no easy feat either, pal.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Alex, don't underestimate your sister.
LEADMALE:She's helped quite a few people.
LEADFEMALE:Remember when she was our little, uh, Ann Landers? I better get started.
LEADFEMALE:Look at all these letters I have already.
LEADFEMALE:Oh - Oh, hey.
LEADFEMALE:You can't actually look, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:They're confidential.
LEADMALE:Oh, let me look.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess you're family and all, so "Dear Mallory, I need your advice.
OTHERMALE:"My partner doesn't satisfy me sexually, and I was wondering" Oh, Dad! My advice is that you don't read that.
LEADFEMALE:Very wise, Dear Mallory.
SUPMALE:Alex, Alex, guess what.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Dear Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I'm adorable Alex.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:No, you don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm taking over the personal advice column for the Columbus Shopper's Guide.
SUPFEMALE:The column is called "Dear Mallory.
SUPMALE:" No, wait, wait, wait Columbus Shopper's Guide.
SUPMALE:Isn't that that freebie giveaway thing they have at the checkout counter at the supermarkets, the one with all the coupons in it? That's right.
OTHERMALE:What are you so excited about, Mal? You're gonna, you're gonna be giving advice to-to lowlife bargain hunters who can't afford to buy a real paper.
LEADMALE:But, Alex, they're not lowlife bargain hunters.
LEADMALE:They're people, real people coming to me for advice.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, if these people are willing to shell out a quarter, they could turn to Dear Abby.
SUPFEMALE:I can help him.
LEADFEMALE:That was a great job.
SUPFEMALE:People came to me for help, and I didn't help them one bit, but I had fun.
SUPFEMALE:I guess that's all that counts.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, Dad, you-you've messed up on helping people plenty of times.
LEADFEMALE:Like who? Like me, whenever you helped me with my homework.
LEADMALE:I remember a certain philosophy paper that I was doing  I don't know, Dad, I have to disagree with you.
LEADFEMALE:Kierkegaard felt that all knowledge must be self-knowledge.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're wrong, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:He was also concerned with the larger societal problems.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, you're missing the point completely.
LEADMALE:Oh, am I? Kierkegaard believed that examining man's existence within a larger framework of a societal, historical dialectic was the avoidance of subjective knowledge so essential to comprehending any type of spiritual truth.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, go to your room.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, go to your room.
LEADMALE:Now, come on, don't be so hard on your dad.
LEADFEMALE:He's done a lot around here.
LEADFEMALE:Remember when he re-wallpapered the kitchen? All by himself, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, Mal, Jennifer, Andrew, everybody! Could you come out for a minute?! There's something I'd like to show you! What, honey? Oh  Oh, Steven, it's magnificent! I never really liked this wallpaper, but you made it work.
SUPMALE:This is pretty nice, Mr.
OTHERMALE:K.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe you can come over to my house and do my kitchen for me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I have to admit I'm really good with my hands.
SUPMALE: Anyway, there's a certain satisfaction a man gets, a certain satisfaction a man gets from a job well done.
SUPMALE:I think I should do more work around the house.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's that's that's fine no That's fine.
LEADMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:I fully expected that to happen.
SUPMALE:Whoa! Whoa! - Whoa! Hey, hey - Oh! Well, it was beautiful while it lasted.
LEADFEMALE:Your father's obsessiveness is one of his most charming traits.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you, dear, but I think I've seen you go off the deep end a few times.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you have? Yeah, come on, Mom, he's got you there.
SUPFEMALE:Does the phrase "snake eyes" mean anything to you? All right, all right, all right, don't get into your pet names for each other.
LEADMALE:You know, Andy, there was one time when your mother became a complete compulsive.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, I bet you were the prettiest compulsive on the block.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother became a real riverboat gambler.
LEADFEMALE:All she was missing was the riverboat.
OTHERMALE:You see, we-we all went to Atlantic City, where your mother was to deliver a lecture at a convention.
SUPMALE:Instead, she fell in love with blackjack.
LEADMALE:Who's he? It's a card game, honey.
LEADMALE:Blackjack's a card game.
LEADFEMALE:Like "Go Fish"? A little, but when was the last time someone made $2,000 playing "Go Fish"? Mom, I'm hungry.
LEADMALE:Oh, can I get some ice cream? Oh, in a few minutes, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Your dad and I are gonna play a couple hands of blackjack and then we'll go have a snack.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, Mom, Mom, look, what are you doing? Every second you delay means interest lost on the money we're gonna win.
SUPMALE:Oh, there's Tom Jones! There's Tom Jones! He's coming this way! Here he comes! Good call, Mal.
SUPMALE:It looked like him from a distance, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You want to give it a try? Well, we might as well get it over with.
LEADMALE:You guys stay behind the rope here and don't get in any trouble.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, but only people over 21 in here.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll sit back here.
LEADFEMALE: 
SUPFEMALE:Your last 21.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think I should do, Elyse? Oh, don't ask me, Steven; I can only think about my speech.
LEADFEMALE:Stick.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? Didn't you read the cards that Alex gave you? Since the deck is rich in tens, you've got to stick, figuring the dealer's four will bust him.
SUPFEMALE:You heard her stick.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, whoo! - We won! Come on, let's cash in those chips.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Elyse.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you just play one game? - Well, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Guess it'd be silly to come all the way to Atlantic City and not play one hand of blackjack.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mom, how's it going? Remember, if the dealer has a four, five or six showing, you want to stick on 12.
LEADMALE:If he's got a three 
LEADMALE:Hit the 13, seven or above, hit the 17.
SUPFEMALE:It's great to see a mother and son enjoying a common interest.
LEADMALE:Okay, see, the dealer has a picture 
SUPFEMALE:hit.
LEADMALE:Stick.
SUPMALE:Whoo! - Yay! We win! I got to get in on this.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, how you doing? I'm Big Al from Vegas.
SUPMALE:Vinny says hello.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, son, didn't I tell you you weren't allowed in here? Who, Me? No, you've never seen me before.
SUPMALE:I'm just here with my wife and my brother-in-law Nice try, kid.
LEADMALE:See you later, hon.
SUPFEMALE:Blackjack! Whoo! On that note, let's call it a day.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, honey, let's hit the boardwalk.
LEADMALE:Can it, Steven.
OTHERMALE:We're not going anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Hit me over here.
OTHERFEMALE:Stick.
LEADFEMALE:Hit me over, but be gentle.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, soft 16.
LEADFEMALE:Hit me again.
LEADMALE:Ooh, stick.
LEADFEMALE:Hit me over here on the end.
LEADFEMALE:Stick.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Eddie.
SUPMALE:My pleasure, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:The lady wins on all three.
LEADMALE: - Whoo! Way to go, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hang in there.
LEADMALE:How ya doing? Nice to see ya.
LEADMALE:You have won quite a bit of money, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Why don't we just cash in now? Oh, Steven, everything is under control, baby.
LEADFEMALE:One more hour, and we are in fat city.
LEADMALE:Okay, now, Eddie, I'm doubling my bets.
LEADMALE:Be nice to me.
LEADMALE:Mom, can I go backstage and hang around Tom Jones's dressing room? Sure, honey.
LEADMALE:Say hi to Tom for me.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, I'm really getting hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Here's ten dollars.
LEADMALE:Get yourself some ice cream.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I saw this girl in the lobby I think I have enough stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't be silly, Andy.
OTHERMALE:The night is young and Keaton memories have just begun.
LEADFEMALE:You know what, Andy? I think it's time that I pass down to you one of my favorite collections.
SUPFEMALE:Baseball cards? They're better than baseball 
LEADMALE:The Alex Keaton report cards.
OTHERFEMALE:Nursery school through college.
LEADMALE:You can keep 'em, you can collect 'em, you can trade 'em with your friends.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Alex.
LEADMALE:I'll treasure 'em.
SUPMALE:You really know how to give that something special, don't you, Alex? Why would you want to save your report cards? Because they're gems.
SUPMALE:I mean, every year, all A's.
SUPFEMALE:Unlike you, Mallory, who spiced up her academic life by getting a Q in math.
OTHERFEMALE:Mal, I think it's great your brother shows such an interest in academics.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, the first day of school is Alex's favorite day of the year.
SUPFEMALE:Jen, I'm telling you, you're gonna do great in high school.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, Jen, what are you worried about? This is Harding High.
LEADMALE:This is my alma mater.
SUPMALE:I'm a legend there.
SUPMALE:Let me see your schedule.
LEADFEMALE:Little kids.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, first period you got Mr.
SUPMALE:Gibson for English.
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:He loved me.
SUPFEMALE:Wrote me a recommendation for college.
LEADFEMALE:Second period, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Hentoff for math.
LEADMALE:She wrote me two recommendations for college.
LEADFEMALE:Third period, Mr.
LEADMALE:Kaufman for science.
SUPMALE:He drove me to college.
LEADFEMALE:Andy, Andy, let's get to work, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:You got a lot of ground to cover here.
LEADFEMALE:First day of kindergarten, you want to get off to a good start, right? - I'm ready, Alex.
LEADMALE:You know, the first thing your teacher's gonna ask is what you did over the summer.
LEADFEMALE:Now, a lot of kids are gonna say, "I went to the zoo" or "I went to the beach," or "I went to a baseball game.
SUPFEMALE:" What are you gonna say? I watched the Iran-Contra hearings.
LEADFEMALE:And? President Reagan doesn't know anything.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't know anything about the scandal, okay? You don't want to be quoted out of context.
LEADMALE:See, the great thing about Andy is, whenever I'm talking, the kid is mesmerized.
LEADMALE:He expresses it in a funny way.
SUPMALE:Andy? - Hmm? Come on.
SUPMALE:Time for bed, sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:I'll take him up, Mom.
LEADMALE:Come on, Andy.
SUPMALE:I better stay to oversee the time capsule.
SUPMALE:It's okay, Andy.
SUPMALE:We'll work on it for you.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what I'm afraid of.
LEADMALE:So now what? Oh, I don't know, maybe mm! this.
LEADMALE:That's great, Merlin.
SUPMALE:Or perhaps this.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Dad, no magic tricks.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what happened the last time.
LEADMALE:Okay, Alex, pick a card! Any card.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jennifer, Jennifer, just the person I want to see.
SUPFEMALE:Get in this box.
LEADMALE:What is this, Daddy Dearest? Come on Steven, we're not gonna put our daughter in a magic box.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, okay, Elyse, then you-you help me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Jen, get in.
LEADMALE:That's all right.
LEADMALE:When I next open this box, my daughter Jennifer will be gone.
LEADFEMALE:Come one, come all from far and near, you have seen my daughter dear.
LEADMALE:I will make her disappear.
SUPFEMALE: Well, that's-that's very good.
SUPFEMALE:Now-Now bring her back.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:She's gone, she's gone, alack, alack, I will bring my daughter back.
LEADMALE: Okay, okay Jennifer? Jennifer, the trick worked.
OTHERFEMALE:You, uh, come out now.
LEADMALE: It's nothing.
OTHERMALE:She's really gone.
SUPFEMALE:Can you do that with Mallory? Wha-What's going on here? Where is Jennifer? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE: That was just the beginning.
LEADMALE:Soon, Dad was completely out of control.
SUPFEMALE:Poodle! Thanks! My very own poodle.
LEADFEMALE: What'll it be, Alex a mouse, peacock? Giraffe? - Dad? - Hmm? This has got to stop.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? Dad Dad, you're a well-educated guy.
LEADFEMALE:And-and-and most of the time, you're pretty normal, but Dad, you got to face it, you have a problem.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, it's just a hobby.
LEADMALE:No, no, Dad, Dad, Dad it's an obsession; it's a compulsion.
LEADMALE:You have a compulsion for say it with me you have a compulsion for 
SUPMALE:birthday party tricks.
LEADFEMALE:That's that's right, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:And it's gotta stop.
SUPMALE:The party is over.
SUPMALE:You're right, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I need help.
SUPFEMALE:Andy, what are you doing out of bed? I can't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:The clothes on my chair look like a monster.
SUPFEMALE:This, uh, this wouldn't by any chance be a ploy to get one of us to read you a bedtime story, would it? No, but the monster's requesting anything but Dr.
SUPMALE:Seuss.
SUPFEMALE:I'll, uh, I'll go.
SUPFEMALE:I speak monster.
SUPFEMALE: I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Hey! - Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Things were going so well there for a moment.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mal Mal, Mal, Mal, Mal uh, don't you remember? We had a date tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:I got two tickets for the postmodern art exhibition and pie-eating contest.
LEADMALE:Sounds like quite a full evening.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey, I just got caught up in this Keaton family time capsule that Andy's making for school.
LEADMALE:Oh, sounds like fun.
SUPFEMALE:Can I play? Sure, Nick.
LEADMALE:Get in.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, we'll let you out when Mallory comes to her senses.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey, don't get in.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, forget it I'll just make my own family time capsule.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, that is if I did have a family.
LEADMALE:Come on, Nick, what about your dad? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I sort of forgot about him.
LEADMALE:I mean, we didn't get together until recently, and that was really weird.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Hey My God, Elyse, they're speaking Nickanese.
LEADMALE:Look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:You look great! Yeah, you look great, too.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I don't see what the problem is.
LEADMALE:They seem to agree on everything.
LEADFEMALE:Hey-ey-ey - Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:I think they're summing up now.
LEADMALE:Nick, no matter what happens, you'll always feel like part of this family.
SUPMALE:Stop, Elyse, I'm going to have nightmares.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember when Nick almost became a member of our family? When was that? Oh, honey, don't you remember when we almost got married? Oh, yeah, yeah, that was beautiful.
SUPMALE:We're gathered here today to join you, Erin, and you, Michael, in marriage, which is an honorable institution.
OTHERMALE:It is the foundation of the home as the home is the foundation of society.
LEADMALE:Oh, sounds serious.
LEADMALE:The desire to join together in love with another human being is both noble and courageous.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, why are you getting married? Because you asked me.
LEADMALE:No, I mean, if I hadn't asked you, would you be here? By myself? Would you have asked me? Ah I'm not sure.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm not sure we're ready.
LEADMALE:Then why did you say yes? You know, you're so much smarter about these things than me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you know, I figured since you thought we were ready, we must be ready and I just didn't notice.
SUPFEMALE:Nick, why doesn't it feel right? We love each other.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Feels like we're breaking the law.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, like our wedding picture's gonna go up on a post office wall.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, like you say, we're starting with a couple of strikes against 
SUPFEMALE:I mean, your parents aren't here, our friends aren't here, this guy doesn't know "Lola" Maybe my parents are right.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we're going too fast.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we could slow down a little.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we don't have to get married if we don't want to.
OTHERFEMALE:No, nobody can force us.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, Nick, I love you.
OTHERMALE:Let's not get married.
LEADMALE:Mallory, you and Nick are so romantic.
LEADMALE:You know, I've often caught you guys looking into each other's eyes with long meaningful stares.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Jennifer, those are blinking contests.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jen, if you're looking for romantic role models, don't go looking at He-Man and She-Ra over here.
LEADFEMALE:And you happen to have the most romantic person in the world living right here under this roof.
SUPFEMALE:Why, thank you, son.
LEADFEMALE:No, Steven, he meant me.
SUPFEMALE:I beg to differ, darling he meant me.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm the most romantic.
LEADFEMALE:Don't make me bust your chops.
SUPFEMALE:I was talking about me.
SUPMALE:I mean, I, uh, I have something of a way about me.
LEADFEMALE:You may not realize this, but women think of me as something of a Don Juan.
LEADMALE:More like a Don Knotts.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Remember when I first started seeing Ellen? And I drove all night? I mean, I drove 400 miles just to see her, to tell her how I felt? Alex? Hey Ellen! What are you doing here? I, uh I, uh You forgot your Newsweek.
SUPFEMALE:I-I-I figured you might want that, so I swung by here.
LEADFEMALE:It was no big deal, really.
LEADMALE:It was seven hours.
LEADFEMALE:There's a good article on the omelet craze.
LEADFEMALE:I read someone else's copy on the train.
SUPMALE:I can't tell you how sorry I am to hear that.
LEADMALE:Uh, Ellen, listen to be honest with you the magazine is not the only reason I came.
LEADMALE:Why else? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I, uh, I just had to come.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I was in-in in the car, on my way to the biggest night of my life, and something made me turn the car around.
SUPMALE:I mean, I knew I missed the dinner and I'd be blowing any shot I had of returning this tux on time.
LEADMALE:Something made me turn the car around.
OTHERMALE:Ellen, uh, you and I are completely different.
LEADFEMALE:You're an artist.
SUPMALE:You write poetry.
LEADMALE:You attend anti-nuclear demonstrations.
LEADFEMALE:Me I'm an economics major.
LEADFEMALE:I, uh voted for Reagan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in the Young Executives Club.
LEADFEMALE:I-I wear a jacket and tie everywhere I go.
SUPFEMALE:Except for train stations at 3:00 in the morning, in which case, I wear a tuxedo.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, the point is, Ellen, that I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why I love you.
LEADFEMALE:You love me? Yeah, I love you, okay? I-I-I said it.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, after all, Ellen, if I'm gonna go this far, I might as well go all the way.
LEADMALE:I love you, all right? I love you, I love you, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm crazy about you, I'd give anything to be with you, I can't live without you, okay? Gotta go.
SUPMALE:See ya.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, too, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's like you have a way of seeing right through me.
OTHERMALE:I'm seeing a part of me that I-I don't ev I don't even like to admit exists.
OTHERFEMALE:And that scares me, because if you see it, that forces me What did you say? I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:You do? Alex, I've never met anybody like you.
LEADFEMALE:You come on like some pompous, arrogant, obnoxious guy.
LEADFEMALE:And underneath that, there's this wide-eyed child, completely innocent and naive.
OTHERMALE:Oh, is that sort of a compliment? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:And just telling Ellen that I loved her wasn't enough.
LEADFEMALE:I started doing anything I could to impress her.
SUPFEMALE:Are you ready, Mikhail? Da.
SUPFEMALE:I'm ready.
OTHERMALE:What is it that you'll be interpreting for us? This, uh, particular piece is an interpretation of the Stock Market Crash of 1929.
LEADMALE:What music will you be using to accompany yourself? Uh, just, uh, just play anything.
OTHERMALE:Th-this dance goes with everything.
SUPFEMALE:Maestro.
SUPMALE:  Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton, is something wrong? Uh, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do you ask? Because you're not dancing.
SUPMALE:You see, at this point in the dance, the economy is still good.
SUPMALE:In, uh in a minute, the crash comes, interest rates rise, and the dance really takes off.
OTHERFEMALE: Alex, are you okay? I'm fine.
LEADMALE:For my next number You see, I'm just that kind of guy, and when I met Lauren, it was the same thing.
SUPMALE:I'd do anything to open up and show my true self, even if it meant lying.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, this is just a polygraph machine.
LEADFEMALE:If someone displays undue tension or an increase in pulse when answering a question, the machine buzzes and I know they're not telling the truth.
LEADMALE:Does it really bother you? Oh, no, absolutely not; absolutely not.
LEADMALE:Uh, I got nothing to hide.
LEADMALE: Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:It's working.
LEADMALE:Well, first I'd like to ask you a few questions to see how well you'll fit in with the rest of the subject group.
LEADMALE:Now politically, would you describe yourself as liberal, middle of the road, or conservative? Uh, well, I-I don't really like political labels.
LEADMALE: Conservative.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, overachievers, they tend to meticulously plan out every aspect of their lives, from graduation to retirement.
OTHERMALE:Do you see yourself as an obsessive planner? What, me? No.
LEADFEMALE: Well, I-I wouldn't say obsessive.
LEADMALE: I'm a planning maniac.
LEADMALE:Now, the typical overachiever is so focused on classes and career that there's not much time left for dating.
SUPMALE:Would you say you have a very active social life? An active, active social life? Yeah, are you actively dating?  Well, I go out on a couple of dates a week.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe more.
LEADFEMALE: This particular week was a little slow.
LEADFEMALE: This particular year was a little slow.
SUPMALE: -  - Oh, I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Skipper.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in.
SUPMALE:Hi, hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:Andy told me about his school project, so I brought over my first aid kit.
LEADFEMALE:You're putting a first aid kit in the time capsule? Time capsule?! I-I thought he said a cold capsule.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, so, what's up, guys? Oh, we were just discussing how Alex is so romantic with his girlfriends.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, did you discuss how romantic he's been with mine? What's this? I-I liked this girl named Jane, and, uh, imagine my shock and dismay to discover that she didn't like me.
LEADMALE:Actually, that's to be expected, but the fact that she liked Alex took me by surprise.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go wash my hands, okay? Uh, you two get to know each other a little better - while I'm gone.
LEADMALE:Please don't leave me.
LEADMALE:Uh, Skippy  We're very close.
SUPMALE:Skippy, I'll be right back, okay?  So how long have you known Alex?  I can't remember.
SUPFEMALE:Do you live next door or across the street from Alex?  Are you all right? You're not having some kind of attack, are you? No! Good.
SUPMALE:I'm really glad we had this opportunity to talk.
SUPFEMALE: Great.
LEADMALE:Hi, I hope I gave you two enough time alone together.
SUPMALE:I think so.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Uh, I'm gonna go wash my hair.
OTHERFEMALE:Skippy, you mean your hands.
LEADFEMALE:Right, I mean, I'm gonna wash the hair on my hands.
OTHERFEMALE:He's quite a guy, isn't he? I'll say.
SUPMALE:I missed you while you were gone, Alex.
LEADMALE:Uh, I was only gone for two minutes, Jane.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what it is about you, Alex, but you bring out the animal in me.
SUPMALE: Hope I'm not being too forward.
SUPMALE:I understand.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, we're here to pick up a pizza for Keaton, please.

SUPFEMALE:I-I think I can see what's going on here.
SUPMALE:I've got a great idea.

LEADMALE:But we were supposed to all be here tonight to share this.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, not another Woodstock slide show where you guys spend the evening trying to spot yourselves among among a sea of long hair and beards.
OTHERFEMALE:Jennifer, we once spotted a blonde speck in that crowd that was definitely your mother.
SUPMALE:That's not what we're doing tonight.
LEADFEMALE:What are we doing tonight? You're helping me make a time capsule for school.
LEADMALE:Oh, that sounds neat what are you gonna put in it? I'm gonna put stuff about our family.
LEADFEMALE:Can you put Alex in there? I could try.
LEADMALE:So if you have any mementos that remind you of growing up, put them in there.
SUPMALE:I, uh, I actually have the first dollar I ever earned.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, and I'll sell it to you for 25 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:You sure you can't put Alex in there? Maybe if we let some of the hot air out of him, he'll fit.
OTHERMALE:So what do you got in here so far, Andy? - I got my baby boots.
OTHERMALE:Oh Yeah, you know, I've got mine bronzed which made it really tough to walk.
LEADFEMALE:Look, our old color slides.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, the slides! - No slides.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you kids loved my slide shows.
SUPMALE:You used to sit there, staring at them, eyes wide open.
SUPMALE:No, Dad, we learned to sleep that way.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe you guys can watch this.
LEADFEMALE:You look ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:Half a million people trying to stop a senseless war.
LEADMALE:You find that ridiculous? I'm talking about the outfits.
OTHERMALE:I'm dying, I'm dying.
LEADMALE:Promise me you'll never show these when my friends are here.
LEADFEMALE:Promise or I'm leaving home right now.
SUPFEMALE:Mallory, that was history in the making.
SUPFEMALE:There were people every state in the union at that protest.
LEADMALE:What were you protesting good grooming? Mommy, you look so pretty.
LEADMALE:Like an Indian princess.
LEADFEMALE:That's your father, dear.
LEADMALE:There I am.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADMALE:You look almost as pretty as Daddy.
SUPMALE:Daddy, how long ago was that? That was very long ago.
OTHERFEMALE:In a galaxy far, far away.
SUPMALE:All right, who wants to see the Peace Corps slides? You know, this is fun, and it's a great way to clean out my closet.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have room for six pairs of Earth Shoes, a mood ring and a pet rock? Why were you guys always protesting stuff? Well, I think it was just the times.
LEADMALE:There was a lot to be upset about, you know? War, the government.
LEADMALE:Not being able to drag a comb through your hair.
LEADMALE:Don't listen to your brother, Andy.
LEADMALE:If he'd been older, he would've loved the '60s.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, the only way I could've enjoyed the '60s would be if my headband had been too tight, I had lost consciousness and woke up in the '80s.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:I seem to remember your getting involved in a protest or two.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, Andy, and it was for a good cause, too The Equal Rights Amendment.
LEADMALE:Alex? No, it was for a better cause than that.
LEADFEMALE:It was for a girl.
LEADMALE:All right! That's right.
SUPMALE:Sing it! It's important.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you okay? No, not really.
LEADMALE:Look, Deena, I cannot go on with this any longer.
LEADFEMALE:I-I-I'm not really Alex, that was a very courageous thing you did, coming to Dorothy's defense like that.
LEADMALE:Well, thanks, but, uh, listen, about this whole ERA business, this-this this button, this-this shirt it's not Is that a scratch on your ear? Yeah, but it's nothing.
LEADMALE:Oh, those animals.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I don't think I've ever been as attracted to anybody as I am to you right now.
SUPMALE:So, what is it you wanted to tell me? Don't remember.
SUPFEMALE:I think it was a trivia question.
SUPMALE:Isn't this romantic? The two of us in prison together.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I want to think you for coming to my defense.
SUPFEMALE:I'm proud of you.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm very impressed with your passion for the movement.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, Dorothy, it was a privilege to come to your aid.
LEADMALE:I mean, I-I regret I have but one ear to give to the cause.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, when you talk like that, I can barely keep my hands off you.
SUPFEMALE:But-but those are just idle words.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there is a job to be done here.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, there is.
LEADMALE:Right on! You know, and not only by us, but by women everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, tell 'em! How long must we wait? How long are we expected to accept these indignities? How long, Lord? You know, I feel the way President Kennedy must've felt that day at the Berlin wall, when he said, "Today I am a Berliner.
LEADFEMALE:" Well, today in this cell, I say to you, "I am a woman.
SUPFEMALE:" Alex definitely turns up in the most unlikely places.
LEADFEMALE:"His mother put him to bed, and made some chamomile tea, and she gave a dose of it to Peter.
LEADFEMALE:" See? Right there.
LEADMALE:"One tablespoon full to be taken at bedtime.
LEADFEMALE:"But Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail, "who are good little bunnies, had bread and milk and blackberries for supper.
SUPMALE:" There, see? These are blackberries.
SUPFEMALE:Read it again, Mommy.
SUPMALE:Give it a break, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:She read it three times.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, Andy and I love to read together.
LEADMALE:"And then Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Reagan said "'Oh, look, Mommy, "It's Secretary of State It's Secretary of State George Shultz.
OTHERFEMALE:" Boy, Andrew, this I Love Republicans pop-up book was the best purchase I ever made.
OTHERFEMALE:Make Nancy wave again.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What is this word right here? "Impeach.
LEADFEMALE:" Isn't that sweet? It really is.
LEADMALE:You know, sometimes I think we're too harsh on Alex.
LEADFEMALE:He-he's not just a callous archconservative Republican.
OTHERMALE:You know, sometimes he can be a warm, loving son and brother.
LEADFEMALE:"I am not a crook.
OTHERMALE:" The one thing you don't want to see, though, is a book in Mallory's hands.
LEADFEMALE:"But I reckon I got to light out "for the territory ahead of the rest because Aunt Sally, "she's gonna adopt me and civilize me and I can't stand it I've been there before.
SUPMALE:" Mal, is that you? What are you doing? I'm reading.
LEADFEMALE:When did you learn how? When I found out that Cosmopolitan magazine was banned in certain places, I became enraged.
LEADFEMALE:Then I saw Huckleberry Finn sitting on the coffee table, and I said to myself, "What better way to show Jennifer my support?" So I picked it up and I started reading and you know what? I love it.
LEADMALE:I love reading I'm gonna teach Nick how to read.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory did a great job of it.
SUPMALE:"The little engine looked at the hill and said, 'I think I can.
SUPFEMALE:"' "I think I can.
LEADMALE:" "I think I can.
LEADMALE:" This is getting pretty exciting, huh? I wonder what happens next? He gets up the hill, Nick.
SUPMALE:I got a few things from my own personal collection.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, that's way too big.
LEADMALE:What's in there, your ego? Andy, I'm gonna give you my favorite baby toy.
LEADFEMALE:She knew how to feather her hair before she even had any.
LEADMALE:And this is the English textbook that I used to help Nick get his high school equivalency diploma.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, you, uh, you were a lot of help.
LEADFEMALE:What is a verb? What does it do in a sentence? Uh, it just kind of sits there, trying not to bother the other words.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Nick.
LEADMALE:A verb is a word that does something active in a sentence, like walk or run or eat.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but, um, eating's not active.
LEADMALE:Unless you eat and run.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you don't have to be moving to be active.
OTHERMALE:You just have to be doing something.
LEADFEMALE:Well what about if you're dead? I mean, you can't be active when you're dead, unless you're a ghost or a vampire.
LEADMALE:Well, you can use verbs for ghosts and vampires.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, just not for ordinary dead people, huh? I'm gonna have to look that up, I think they have special verbs for them.
LEADMALE:You know, this is without a doubt, the most inane and absurd conversation I've ever heard.
LEADMALE:Alex, what are you doing here? What am I do well, I'm not "doing" anything, so I guess I'll need one of those special verbs.
LEADMALE:Like you use for dead people.
LEADFEMALE:Did Nick graduate? Yes, Andy, Nick did graduate What was that, honey? With Alex's help.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
OTHERMALE:And it was no easy feat either, pal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Alex, don't underestimate your sister.
SUPMALE:She's helped quite a few people.
LEADMALE:Remember when she was our little, uh, Ann Landers? I better get started.
SUPFEMALE:Look at all these letters I have already.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh - Oh, hey.
OTHERMALE:You can't actually look, Dad.
LEADMALE:They're confidential.
LEADMALE:Oh, let me look.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess you're family and all, so "Dear Mallory, I need your advice.
LEADMALE:"My partner doesn't satisfy me sexually, and I was wondering" Oh, Dad! My advice is that you don't read that.
LEADFEMALE:Very wise, Dear Mallory.
LEADMALE:Alex, Alex, guess what.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Dear Mallory.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I'm adorable Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha.
SUPMALE:No, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm taking over the personal advice column for the Columbus Shopper's Guide.
LEADFEMALE:The column is called "Dear Mallory.
LEADMALE:" No, wait, wait, wait Columbus Shopper's Guide.
OTHERMALE:Isn't that that freebie giveaway thing they have at the checkout counter at the supermarkets, the one with all the coupons in it? That's right.
SUPFEMALE:What are you so excited about, Mal? You're gonna, you're gonna be giving advice to-to lowlife bargain hunters who can't afford to buy a real paper.
SUPFEMALE:But, Alex, they're not lowlife bargain hunters.
LEADMALE:They're people, real people coming to me for advice.
LEADMALE:Mallory, if these people are willing to shell out a quarter, they could turn to Dear Abby.
LEADFEMALE:I can help him.
LEADFEMALE:That was a great job.
OTHERFEMALE:People came to me for help, and I didn't help them one bit, but I had fun.
OTHERMALE:I guess that's all that counts.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, Dad, you-you've messed up on helping people plenty of times.
LEADFEMALE:Like who? Like me, whenever you helped me with my homework.
SUPMALE:I remember a certain philosophy paper that I was doing I don't know, Dad, I have to disagree with you.
LEADMALE:Kierkegaard felt that all knowledge must be self-knowledge.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you're wrong, Jen.
SUPMALE:He was also concerned with the larger societal problems.
SUPMALE:Dad, you're missing the point completely.
LEADMALE:Oh, am I? Kierkegaard believed that examining man's existence within a larger framework of a societal, historical dialectic was the avoidance of subjective knowledge so essential to comprehending any type of spiritual truth.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, go to your room.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, go to your room.
LEADMALE:Now, come on, don't be so hard on your dad.
LEADMALE:He's done a lot around here.
OTHERFEMALE:Remember when he re-wallpapered the kitchen? All by himself, too.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, Mal, Jennifer, Andrew, everybody! Could you come out for a minute?! There's something I'd like to show you! What, honey? Oh Oh, Steven, it's magnificent! I never really liked this wallpaper, but you made it work.
LEADFEMALE:This is pretty nice, Mr.
LEADMALE:K.
SUPMALE:Maybe you can come over to my house and do my kitchen for me.
LEADMALE:Well, I have to admit I'm really good with my hands.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, there's a certain satisfaction a man gets, a certain satisfaction a man gets from a job well done.
LEADMALE:I think I should do more work around the house.
LEADMALE:I don't think so, Dad.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's that's that's fine no That's fine.
SUPFEMALE:No problem.
SUPMALE:I fully expected that to happen.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Whoa! - Whoa! Hey, hey - Oh! Well, it was beautiful while it lasted.
SUPMALE:Your father's obsessiveness is one of his most charming traits.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you, dear, but I think I've seen you go off the deep end a few times.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you have? Yeah, come on, Mom, he's got you there.
LEADFEMALE:Does the phrase "snake eyes" mean anything to you? All right, all right, all right, don't get into your pet names for each other.
LEADMALE:You know, Andy, there was one time when your mother became a complete compulsive.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I bet you were the prettiest compulsive on the block.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Your mother became a real riverboat gambler.
LEADMALE:All she was missing was the riverboat.
LEADFEMALE:You see, we-we all went to Atlantic City, where your mother was to deliver a lecture at a convention.
LEADFEMALE:Instead, she fell in love with blackjack.
LEADMALE:Who's he? It's a card game, honey.
OTHERMALE:Blackjack's a card game.
LEADMALE:Like "Go Fish"? A little, but when was the last time someone made $2,000 playing "Go Fish"? Mom, I'm hungry.
LEADMALE:Oh, can I get some ice cream? Oh, in a few minutes, honey.
LEADMALE:Your dad and I are gonna play a couple hands of blackjack and then we'll go have a snack.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, Mom, Mom, look, what are you doing? Every second you delay means interest lost on the money we're gonna win.
LEADMALE:Oh, there's Tom Jones! There's Tom Jones! He's coming this way! Here he comes! Good call, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:It looked like him from a distance, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:You want to give it a try? Well, we might as well get it over with.
OTHERMALE:You guys stay behind the rope here and don't get in any trouble.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but only people over 21 in here.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'll sit back here.
LEADFEMALE:Your last 21.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think I should do, Elyse? Oh, don't ask me, Steven; I can only think about my speech.
OTHERMALE:Stick.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm? Didn't you read the cards that Alex gave you? Since the deck is rich in tens, you've got to stick, figuring the dealer's four will bust him.
LEADFEMALE:You heard her stick.
OTHERMALE:Oh, whoo! - We won! Come on, let's cash in those chips.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just play one game? - Well, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Guess it'd be silly to come all the way to Atlantic City and not play one hand of blackjack.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Mom, how's it going? Remember, if the dealer has a four, five or six showing, you want to stick on 12.
OTHERMALE:If he's got a three Hit the 13, seven or above, hit the 17.
OTHERFEMALE:It's great to see a mother and son enjoying a common interest.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, see, the dealer has a picture hit.
SUPFEMALE:Stick.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo! - Yay! We win! I got to get in on this.
OTHERMALE:Hi, how you doing? I'm Big Al from Vegas.
OTHERFEMALE:Vinny says hello.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, son, didn't I tell you you weren't allowed in here? Who, Me? No, you've never seen me before.
LEADMALE:I'm just here with my wife and my brother-in-law Nice try, kid.
LEADFEMALE:See you later, hon.
LEADFEMALE:Blackjack! Whoo! On that note, let's call it a day.
LEADMALE:Come on, honey, let's hit the boardwalk.
LEADMALE:Can it, Steven.
SUPMALE:We're not going anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:Hit me over here.
OTHERMALE:Stick.
OTHERFEMALE:Hit me over, but be gentle.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, soft 16.
LEADMALE:Hit me again.
LEADMALE:Ooh, stick.
SUPFEMALE:Hit me over here on the end.
OTHERMALE:Stick.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:My pleasure, Elyse.
LEADMALE:The lady wins on all three.
LEADMALE:Whoo! Way to go, Mom.
SUPMALE:Hang in there.
SUPMALE:How ya doing? Nice to see ya.
LEADMALE:You have won quite a bit of money, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we just cash in now? Oh, Steven, everything is under control, baby.
SUPMALE:One more hour, and we are in fat city.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, now, Eddie, I'm doubling my bets.
LEADFEMALE:Be nice to me.
LEADMALE:Mom, can I go backstage and hang around Tom Jones's dressing room? Sure, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Say hi to Tom for me.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I'm really getting hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's ten dollars.
LEADFEMALE:Get yourself some ice cream.
SUPMALE:Mom, I saw this girl in the lobby I think I have enough stuff.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't be silly, Andy.
OTHERFEMALE:The night is young and Keaton memories have just begun.
LEADMALE:You know what, Andy? I think it's time that I pass down to you one of my favorite collections.
LEADFEMALE:Baseball cards? They're better than baseball 
LEADMALE:The Alex Keaton report cards.
LEADFEMALE:Nursery school through college.
LEADFEMALE:You can keep 'em, you can collect 'em, you can trade 'em with your friends.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Alex.
OTHERMALE:I'll treasure 'em.
LEADMALE:You really know how to give that something special, don't you, Alex? Why would you want to save your report cards? Because they're gems.
SUPMALE:I mean, every year, all A's.
SUPFEMALE:Unlike you, Mallory, who spiced up her academic life by getting a Q in math.
LEADMALE:Mal, I think it's great your brother shows such an interest in academics.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, the first day of school is Alex's favorite day of the year.
LEADMALE:Jen, I'm telling you, you're gonna do great in high school.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Jen, what are you worried about? This is Harding High.
LEADFEMALE:This is my alma mater.
LEADMALE:I'm a legend there.
SUPFEMALE:Let me see your schedule.
SUPFEMALE:Little kids.

SUPFEMALE:You got a lot of ground to cover here.
LEADFEMALE:First day of kindergarten, you want to get off to a good start, right? - I'm ready, Alex.
LEADMALE:You know, the first thing your teacher's gonna ask is what you did over the summer.
OTHERMALE:Now, a lot of kids are gonna say, "I went to the zoo" or "I went to the beach," or "I went to a baseball game.
SUPMALE:" What are you gonna say? I watched the Iran-Contra hearings.
OTHERMALE:And? President Reagan doesn't know anything.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't know anything about the scandal, okay? You don't want to be quoted out of context.
SUPFEMALE:See, the great thing about Andy is, whenever I'm talking, the kid is mesmerized.
LEADMALE:He expresses it in a funny way.
SUPFEMALE:Andy? - Hmm? Come on.
LEADMALE:Time for bed, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take him up, Mom.
SUPMALE:Come on, Andy.
SUPMALE:I better stay to oversee the time capsule.
LEADMALE:It's okay, Andy.
OTHERMALE:We'll work on it for you.
SUPMALE:That's what I'm afraid of.
SUPMALE:So now what? Oh, I don't know, maybe mm! this.
LEADMALE:That's great, Merlin.
LEADMALE:Or perhaps this.
LEADMALE:Please, Dad, no magic tricks.
LEADFEMALE:You know what happened the last time.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, Alex, pick a card! Any card.
SUPMALE:Oh, Jennifer, Jennifer, just the person I want to see.
LEADMALE:Get in this box.

OTHERFEMALE:Well, okay, Elyse, then you-you help me.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jen, get in.
SUPFEMALE:That's all right.
SUPMALE:When I next open this box, my daughter Jennifer will be gone.
LEADFEMALE:Come one, come all from far and near, you have seen my daughter dear.
LEADMALE:I will make her disappear.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's-that's very good.
LEADFEMALE:Now-Now bring her back.

SUPFEMALE:She's gone, she's gone, alack, alack, I will bring my daughter back.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, okay Jennifer? Jennifer, the trick worked.
SUPMALE:You, uh, come out now.
OTHERFEMALE:It's nothing.
SUPMALE:She's really gone.
LEADFEMALE:Can you do that with Mallory? Wha-What's going on here? Where is Jennifer? I don't know.
LEADMALE:That was just the beginning.
OTHERFEMALE:Soon, Dad was completely out of control.
OTHERFEMALE:Poodle! Thanks! My very own poodle.
LEADMALE:What'll it be, Alex a mouse, peacock? Giraffe? - Dad? - Hmm? This has got to stop.
OTHERMALE:What do you mean? Dad Dad, you're a well-educated guy.
LEADMALE:And-and-and most of the time, you're pretty normal, but Dad, you got to face it, you have a problem.
LEADMALE:Alex, it's just a hobby.
SUPMALE:No, no, Dad, Dad, Dad it's an obsession; it's a compulsion.
SUPMALE:You have a compulsion for say it with me you have a compulsion for birthday party tricks.
SUPFEMALE:That's that's right, Dad.
SUPMALE:And it's gotta stop.
LEADFEMALE:The party is over.
SUPMALE:You're right, Alex.
SUPMALE:I need help.
SUPFEMALE:Andy, what are you doing out of bed? I can't sleep.
OTHERFEMALE:The clothes on my chair look like a monster.
SUPMALE:This, uh, this wouldn't by any chance be a ploy to get one of us to read you a bedtime story, would it? No, but the monster's requesting anything but Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Seuss.
SUPMALE:I'll, uh, I'll go.
LEADFEMALE:I speak monster.
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! - Hi.
OTHERMALE:Things were going so well there for a moment.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mal Mal, Mal, Mal, Mal uh, don't you remember? We had a date tonight.
LEADMALE:I got two tickets for the postmodern art exhibition and pie-eating contest.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like quite a full evening.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey, I just got caught up in this Keaton family time capsule that Andy's making for school.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sounds like fun.
LEADFEMALE:Can I play? Sure, Nick.
LEADMALE:Get in.
SUPFEMALE:And, uh, we'll let you out when Mallory comes to her senses.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey, don't get in.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, forget it I'll just make my own family time capsule.
LEADMALE:I mean, that is if I did have a family.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Nick, what about your dad? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:I sort of forgot about him.
SUPMALE:I mean, we didn't get together until recently, and that was really weird.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey! Hey My God, Elyse, they're speaking Nickanese.
LEADMALE:Look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:You look great! Yeah, you look great, too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I don't see what the problem is.
SUPFEMALE:They seem to agree on everything.
LEADMALE:Hey-ey-ey - Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:I think they're summing up now.
SUPMALE:Nick, no matter what happens, you'll always feel like part of this family.
SUPMALE:Stop, Elyse, I'm going to have nightmares.
LEADFEMALE:Do you remember when Nick almost became a member of our family? When was that? Oh, honey, don't you remember when we almost got married? Oh, yeah, yeah, that was beautiful.
SUPMALE:We're gathered here today to join you, Erin, and you, Michael, in marriage, which is an honorable institution.
LEADFEMALE:It is the foundation of the home as the home is the foundation of society.
LEADMALE:Oh, sounds serious.
LEADFEMALE:The desire to join together in love with another human being is both noble and courageous.
LEADMALE:Nick, why are you getting married? Because you asked me.
LEADMALE:No, I mean, if I hadn't asked you, would you be here? By myself? Would you have asked me? Ah I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm not sure we're ready.
LEADFEMALE:Then why did you say yes? You know, you're so much smarter about these things than me.
LEADMALE:I mean, you know, I figured since you thought we were ready, we must be ready and I just didn't notice.
LEADMALE:Nick, why doesn't it feel right? We love each other.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Feels like we're breaking the law.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yeah, like our wedding picture's gonna go up on a post office wall.
SUPMALE:Yeah, like you say, we're starting with a couple of strikes against 
LEADMALE:I mean, your parents aren't here, our friends aren't here, this guy doesn't know "Lola" Maybe my parents are right.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we're going too fast.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we could slow down a little.
SUPMALE:I mean, we don't have to get married if we don't want to.
OTHERMALE:No, nobody can force us.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, Nick, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not get married.
LEADFEMALE:Mallory, you and Nick are so romantic.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I've often caught you guys looking into each other's eyes with long meaningful stares.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, Jennifer, those are blinking contests.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Jen, if you're looking for romantic role models, don't go looking at He-Man and She-Ra over here.
OTHERFEMALE:And you happen to have the most romantic person in the world living right here under this roof.
LEADFEMALE:Why, thank you, son.
LEADFEMALE:No, Steven, he meant me.
LEADFEMALE:I beg to differ, darling he meant me.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm the most romantic.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't make me bust your chops.
OTHERFEMALE:I was talking about me.
LEADMALE:I mean, I, uh, I have something of a way about me.
SUPMALE:You may not realize this, but women think of me as something of a Don Juan.
SUPFEMALE:More like a Don Knotts.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Remember when I first started seeing Ellen? And I drove all night? I mean, I drove 400 miles just to see her, to tell her how I felt? Alex? Hey Ellen! What are you doing here? I, uh I, uh You forgot your Newsweek.
SUPFEMALE:I-I-I figured you might want that, so I swung by here.
SUPFEMALE:It was no big deal, really.
LEADMALE:It was seven hours.
LEADMALE:There's a good article on the omelet craze.
SUPMALE:I read someone else's copy on the train.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell you how sorry I am to hear that.
SUPMALE:Uh, Ellen, listen to be honest with you the magazine is not the only reason I came.
SUPFEMALE:Why else? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I, uh, I just had to come.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I was in-in in the car, on my way to the biggest night of my life, and something made me turn the car around.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I knew I missed the dinner and I'd be blowing any shot I had of returning this tux on time.
OTHERMALE:Something made me turn the car around.
SUPMALE:Ellen, uh, you and I are completely different.
SUPFEMALE:You're an artist.
LEADMALE:You write poetry.
SUPMALE:You attend anti-nuclear demonstrations.
LEADMALE:Me I'm an economics major.
OTHERFEMALE:I, uh voted for Reagan.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in the Young Executives Club.
SUPMALE:I-I wear a jacket and tie everywhere I go.
LEADMALE:Except for train stations at 3:00 in the morning, in which case, I wear a tuxedo.
LEADMALE:Anyway, the point is, Ellen, that I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why I love you.
LEADMALE:You love me? Yeah, I love you, okay? I-I-I said it.
LEADMALE:I mean, after all, Ellen, if I'm gonna go this far, I might as well go all the way.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, all right? I love you, I love you, I love you.
SUPFEMALE:I'm crazy about you, I'd give anything to be with you, I can't live without you, okay? Gotta go.
LEADMALE:See ya.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, too, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's like you have a way of seeing right through me.
OTHERMALE:I'm seeing a part of me that I-I don't ev I don't even like to admit exists.
SUPMALE:And that scares me, because if you see it, that forces me What did you say? I love you, too.
SUPMALE:You do? Alex, I've never met anybody like you.
LEADFEMALE:You come on like some pompous, arrogant, obnoxious guy.
LEADMALE:And underneath that, there's this wide-eyed child, completely innocent and naive.
SUPMALE:Oh, is that sort of a compliment? Yeah.
LEADMALE:And just telling Ellen that I loved her wasn't enough.
OTHERFEMALE:I started doing anything I could to impress her.
LEADMALE:Are you ready, Mikhail? Da.
LEADMALE:I'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:What is it that you'll be interpreting for us? This, uh, particular piece is an interpretation of the Stock Market Crash of 1929.
LEADFEMALE:What music will you be using to accompany yourself? Uh, just, uh, just play anything.
SUPFEMALE:Th-this dance goes with everything.
SUPMALE:Maestro.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton, is something wrong? Uh, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:Why do you ask? Because you're not dancing.
SUPMALE:You see, at this point in the dance, the economy is still good.
SUPFEMALE:In, uh in a minute, the crash comes, interest rates rise, and the dance really takes off.
LEADMALE:Alex, are you okay? I'm fine.
OTHERMALE:For my next number You see, I'm just that kind of guy, and when I met Lauren, it was the same thing.
LEADMALE:I'd do anything to open up and show my true self, even if it meant lying.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, this is just a polygraph machine.
SUPMALE:If someone displays undue tension or an increase in pulse when answering a question, the machine buzzes and I know they're not telling the truth.
LEADMALE:Does it really bother you? Oh, no, absolutely not; absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I got nothing to hide.
SUPMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:It's working.
LEADMALE:Well, first I'd like to ask you a few questions to see how well you'll fit in with the rest of the subject group.
SUPFEMALE:Now politically, would you describe yourself as liberal, middle of the road, or conservative? Uh, well, I-I don't really like political labels.
LEADMALE:Conservative.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, overachievers, they tend to meticulously plan out every aspect of their lives, from graduation to retirement.
SUPFEMALE:Do you see yourself as an obsessive planner? What, me? No.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I-I wouldn't say obsessive.
LEADMALE:I'm a planning maniac.
LEADFEMALE:Now, the typical overachiever is so focused on classes and career that there's not much time left for dating.
LEADMALE:Would you say you have a very active social life? An active, active social life? Yeah, are you actively dating? Well, I go out on a couple of dates a week.
LEADMALE:Maybe more.
OTHERFEMALE:This particular week was a little slow.
SUPFEMALE:This particular year was a little slow.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Hey, Skipper.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:Hi, hi, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Andy told me about his school project, so I brought over my first aid kit.
LEADMALE:You're putting a first aid kit in the time capsule? Time capsule?! I-I thought he said a cold capsule.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, so, what's up, guys? Oh, we were just discussing how Alex is so romantic with his girlfriends.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, did you discuss how romantic he's been with mine? What's this? I-I liked this girl named Jane, and, uh, imagine my shock and dismay to discover that she didn't like me.
OTHERMALE:Actually, that's to be expected, but the fact that she liked Alex took me by surprise.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna go wash my hands, okay? Uh, you two get to know each other a little better - while I'm gone.
SUPFEMALE:Please don't leave me.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Skippy We're very close.
SUPFEMALE:Skippy, I'll be right back, okay? So how long have you known Alex? I can't remember.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you live next door or across the street from Alex? Are you all right? You're not having some kind of attack, are you? No! Good.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really glad we had this opportunity to talk.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, I hope I gave you two enough time alone together.
LEADMALE:I think so.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, I'm gonna go wash my hair.
SUPMALE:Skippy, you mean your hands.
SUPMALE:Right, I mean, I'm gonna wash the hair on my hands.
LEADMALE:He's quite a guy, isn't he? I'll say.
LEADMALE:I missed you while you were gone, Alex.
LEADMALE:Uh, I was only gone for two minutes, Jane.
LEADMALE:I don't know what it is about you, Alex, but you bring out the animal in me.
LEADMALE:Hope I'm not being too forward.
LEADMALE:I understand.
LEADMALE:Hi, we're here to pick up a pizza for Keaton, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Mallory, look.
LEADFEMALE:Jennifer and Mallory, what are you guys doing here? Um, we Come on over and say hello to Alex and Jane.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, no, Skippy, don't go over there.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? - Um I'm sorry, Mallory, but I'm spoken for.
LEADFEMALE:Better be getting back to my date.
LEADMALE:Uh, Skippy, don't Uh, uh I-I can explain this.
SUPFEMALE:No, Alex, don't bother explaining.
LEADFEMALE:I-I think I can see what's going on here.
SUPMALE:I've got a great idea.
LEADMALE:You know what we're in perfect formation for.
SUPFEMALE:A gang synchronized swim? No, a sing-along.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mom, if you go into "If I Had a Hammer," I'm gonna lose it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, a sing-along will be fun.
LEADMALE:After all, we Keatons do it so well.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody! I'd like to sing for you, if I might, uh, a song that's very special to me, a song that asks the musical question Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:Join me.
LEADMALE:Kiss me, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hi, Alex.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mom, what are you doing? Taxes.
LEADFEMALE:Got an extension they have to be in next week.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see, that's, uh that's, um  - What? -  Uh, it's nothing.
LEADMALE:It's nothing, Mom.
LEADMALE:It's this is this is cute.
LEADMALE:This it's very cute.
LEADMALE: It's fine.
SUPMALE:Just go ahead.
LEADMALE: Alex, I think Mom is perfectly capable of doing the family taxes.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:I appreciate the words of support.
SUPMALE:Now, why isn't Alex doing 'em, like he usually does? Well, Alex isn't always going to be here.
LEADMALE:Besides, I should be able to do this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Your father can't help because he's got a deadline to meet he has to finish his new documentary on Leo Tolstoy.
SUPMALE:Well, what happened to the one he was doing before? Exotic Pet Stores How Much Is That Armadillo in the Window? He's blocked on that.
LEADFEMALE:So he switched, and I get to do the taxes.
SUPMALE:What? Mom, look, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:This is America, and in America, Americans don't just sit and "do their taxes.
LEADFEMALE:" They go to H&R Block or, uh or me.
SUPMALE:Well, Alex, I don't have to go anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:Our taxes aren't that complicated.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Mom, what I'm telling you is that you are being offered the services of Keaton & Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, because this is America, I support and benefit from many of the government programs our taxes pay for.
LEADMALE:So I am not interested in the Keaton & Keaton "insidious loophole" approach.
LEADFEMALE:Take your hands off Andy's ears.
SUPMALE: All right.
SUPMALE:A good citizen pays all of his or her taxes.
OTHERFEMALE:But at Keaton & Keaton, no one pays taxes.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but no, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Andy, never mind.
SUPMALE:Can't teach an old dog new tricks.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? Oh, I'm sorry, I meant a young dog.
LEADMALE:A puppy.
SUPMALE:Oh, Elyse, I'm really excited about this Tolstoy documentary.
SUPMALE:The whole key to it lies in this book - What? - War and Peace.
SUPMALE:Remember? I was reading this the night you went into labor with Alex - Oh! - This week, I'm gonna pick up where I left off.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Steven, I remember.
LEADFEMALE:I remember.
SUPFEMALE:You wanted to name 
LEADMALE:Sascha Alexei Keatonovich.
LEADFEMALE:It's amazing I grew up so normal.
SUPFEMALE:Don't flatter yourself, Sascha.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mal.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Well, hi, Mal.
SUPMALE:How's your documentary going? Well, I think it's gonna be great.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like you stripped the library bare.
LEADFEMALE: Lucky for me.
SUPMALE: Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Do you want something? Well, I was gonna ask you a question, but it can wait.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mal, if you've got a question, just ask.
LEADMALE:I-I'm sure between the brilliant Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Tolstoy and me, we can come up with an answer.
LEADFEMALE:Can Nick stay here for a week while his apartment's being painted? Nyet.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, please? I mean, Nick really has no place else to go.
LEADMALE:I think we can do this much for Nick.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Dad! I know it's a big favor.
LEADFEMALE:I'm unclear about this did I say yes? Uh, now, look, Mal, um, you've got to explain to Nick that your father's got a lot of work to do on his documentary and Nick's really gonna have to keep out of his way.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, of course, no, you don't have to worry about that.
LEADFEMALE:The Nick I know is a very quiet and private person.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, when we're together, sometimes we we completely forget the other person's there.
LEADFEMALE:One of us has to say to the other "Hey.
LEADMALE:I'm here.
OTHERMALE:" That's one hell of a think tank.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my gosh, I almost forgot! Oh!  Hey.
OTHERMALE:I'm here.
LEADFEMALE: Hey, guys, what's all that stuff for? Well, Nick, he's gonna have to sleep on the couch, so I'm gonna make it comfortable for him.
SUPMALE:Hey, wait a minute, could we get a tax deduction for boarders? 'Fraid not, Mom.
SUPMALE:See, technically, he's not a boarder.
SUPFEMALE:He's a freeloader.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, would you get up? Uh absolutely not.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, fine.
LEADMALE:Have it your way.
LEADMALE: Mal Mal How's it coming with the taxes, honey? Needn't concern yourself.
LEADMALE: Dad, Mom's not taking full advantage of the new tax laws! Elyse, I'd listen to the couch.
SUPMALE:All right, Alex, that's it! Just get up! Jen, help me with those pillows, okay? No, not that end Nick always likes to sleep with his feet pointing north.
LEADFEMALE:How would you know? How would I know? Uh well, Nick told me.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Nick's like a compass, see? And in fact, if you lay him down with his feet pointing south, he'll turn completely around.
SUPMALE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Keaton, you really ought to change the blades in that razor more often.
LEADMALE:It's an electric razor, Nick.
OTHERFEMALE:Not anymore.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm really tired.
SUPMALE:I think I'm gonna go hit the sack.
SUPMALE:Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, can we point him south? 'Cause I want to see him spin completely around.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going up, too.
SUPMALE:Come on, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Yep, I'm exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go, Mal.
OTHERMALE:I'll be up in a little while, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:No rush.
LEADFEMALE:We'll wait.
LEADMALE:Good night, Nick.
SUPMALE:Night.
SUPMALE:Elyse, I'm not too thrilled with the sleeping arrangements here.
OTHERMALE:We've been sleeping in the same bed for 20 years.
OTHERMALE:Not us.
LEADMALE: Please, Steven, don't be ridiculous.
SUPMALE:Everything's gonna be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Now, can we go to bed? All right, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:We're two mature adults.
SUPMALE:We trust our daughter.
SUPFEMALE: We trust this young man.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go to sleep.
LEADMALE: 
LEADFEMALE:Nick, Nick, wake up.
SUPFEMALE: - We don't have much time.
OTHERFEMALE:My dad's asleep on the landing.
LEADMALE:Oh, oh, oh, oh, all right, all right, I'm awake, - Shh! - I'm awake, I'm awake.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go for it in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE: - All right! -   What exactly is going on in here? Aw Mr.
SUPMALE:K, you've ruined the surprise.
LEADMALE:Thank God.
OTHERFEMALE:What surprise? We're gonna make a big breakfast for the whole family.
OTHERMALE:So that's what you were, uh doing i-in here? Yeah.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? - Dad? -  Oh, Mal! Nick! I  
SUPFEMALE:What a deep sleep I was in.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What am I doing in the kitchen? I Oh! I must have been sleepwalking! Well good night.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm? Last chance for some professional tax assistance.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't need an H&R blockhead.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just seconds away from the biggest tax refund in Keaton history.
OTHERMALE:Okay, come on, Keogh deduction plan, do your stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Mama needs a new pair of shoes! How much are we getting back, Mom? - Minus $3,000.
LEADMALE: Oh, my God Don't spend it all in one place, Mom.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, I-I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:It says we we owe $3,000.
SUPMALE:How could we owe $3,000? Guess what I got in the mail? A check for $800.
SUPMALE:Alex did my taxes and this is the refund!  $800? Mallory, that's more than you made.
LEADMALE: Alex, will you take a look at this for me, please? Uh, well, Mom, it looks to me like you've got everything under control, so I'm just gonna shove off, okay? Oh, please, honey.
SUPMALE:Mom, Mom, don't beg, okay? You're much better than Oh, please, I'll be your best friend.
LEADMALE:  
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a beautiful morning Oh, what a beautiful day I got a beautiful feeling Everything's going my way.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Nick, what are you doing here? Oh, wait you live here now.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, hey you know, that was a pretty amusing incident that happened in the kitchen earlier this morning, huh, Mr.
SUPMALE:K? Huh? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Glad you enjoyed it, Nick.
LEADMALE:Next show at 11:00.
LEADFEMALE:So, I, uh, guess it's just the two of us at home.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's how it looks.
LEADFEMALE:What are we gonna do? Well, whatever we're gonna do, I'm just hoping we'll do it in separate rooms.
SUPFEMALE:Well, maybe later.
LEADMALE:Right now, you just do what you normally do, and, uh, I'll do what I do, huh? Fine.
LEADMALE:Fine, Nick.
SUPMALE: Hey, uh Uh, Mr.
SUPMALE:K, I'm just gonna do a bunch of sit-ups, huh? And, uh, could you count for me? Tell me when I get to 100? Sure thing, Nick.
SUPMALE:Get started.
LEADFEMALE: What am I up to? Uh that's one.
SUPMALE:Boy, am I out of shape.
SUPFEMALE:Am I at two yet? Not yet.
LEADFEMALE:  So, uh, what's the big book about, huh? Uh  Russia.
SUPMALE:Russia.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
SUPMALE:So, uh, you just read for the general idea.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:Adult's Digest.
LEADFEMALE:Adults digest what? I guess whatever they eat, huh? Oh, hey, hey, hey, I don't mean to be disturbing you, huh? - No.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:I'll just, uh, get into my own thing here.
SUPMALE: "Meet Bill's gallbladder.
SUPMALE:" "I am a membranous muscular sac "in which Bill's bile is stored.
LEADMALE:"What is Bill's bile, you ask? Bile is a yellow or greenish fluid s" "secreted by my very close personal friend, Bill's liver.
LEADMALE:" Oh, hey, hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I don't mean to be bothering you, all right? I'll, uh I'll just get into my own thing here, all right? -  - 
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:  Nick! What-what are you doing?! Who? Me?  Oh! Look! Why, a little fairy must've brought you a cup of tea.
LEADFEMALE:Tea! Mal, can I talk to you about something for a minute? Sure, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Have you noticed a slight tension in this house between me and your dad? No more than usual.
LEADFEMALE:It's starting to make me think that maybe I shouldn't be staying here.
SUPMALE:Maybe I should go downtown and stay at the Hi-De-Ho "Hote.
LEADMALE:" No, honey, you mean the Hi-De-Ho Hotel.
LEADFEMALE:The "L" burnt out, remember? Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I just thought they changed the name.
OTHERMALE:Anyway, I just think it'd be better for everybody if I just left.
LEADFEMALE:No, honey, we all love having you here.
LEADMALE:No, it's rather obvious that your father doesn't.
OTHERMALE:But, honey, he never liked you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know, you know? But it's just starting to get to me.
LEADMALE:I mean, everybody likes me, you know? Except for maybe my uncle Louie, all right? When I was eight years old, I accidentally burnt down his garage.
LEADFEMALE:However, his wife, Aunt Louie she loves me.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, I'm a good guy, you know? Your father should like me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Nick, maybe if you stopped whining about whether or not he likes you and just act the way you do around me, he's bound to like you.
OTHERMALE:You think I ought to kiss him? Hi.
OTHERFEMALE: Listen, sometimes it just takes a while with my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Just be patient.
LEADMALE:Oh! Look who's here.
LEADMALE:It's my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, Nick; Nick, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE: Hey, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE: Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, gosh.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, - how's that Russian thing coming, huh? - Yeah, well Fine, Nick, thanks.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, you know how to make a White Russian? - It's one part vod - Oh, thank-thanks, Nick.
LEADMALE:I-I'm sure I'll be able to work that in here somewhere.
SUPFEMALE:You know how to make Russian dressing? Yes, I do, Nick.
LEADMALE:Good, good I mean, you'll be able to slip that right in after the White Russian part, you know? I mean we're just rolling right along here, huh? Nick - if you don't mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, I understand.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, here.
SUPMALE:Let me get those for Oh.
LEADFEMALE: - Nick! Please! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just trying to help.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need you to help me with this, Nick.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Keaton.
SUPFEMALE:You don't need me to help you with nothing, huh? Nick, please.
LEADMALE:I have work to do.
SUPFEMALE:You know, you've never really given me a chance.
LEADFEMALE:A chance for what? A chance to show you who I really am.
LEADMALE:I mean, from the minute you met me, you always thought I was this dumb guy with no future who's no good for your daughter.
SUPFEMALE:And now four years later, you think I'm this dumb guy with no future who's no good for your daughter.
LEADMALE:Nick, that's not true.
SUPMALE:I don't think you're dumb.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but you don't think I'm any good for your daughter.
OTHERFEMALE: Look, if Mal wants to talk to me, tell her she can find me down at the Hi-De-Ho Hote.
SUPMALE: Elyse, I've been up all night up all night thinking.
OTHERMALE:I need your opinion.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I've always been nice to Nick, haven't I? Are you crazy? No, I'm serious.
SUPMALE:Come on, Steven, from the moment Nick set foot in this house, you were determined not to like him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, so were you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I came around, though.
LEADFEMALE:I learned to like him; I talked to him got to know the real Nick, the true Nick, the inner Nick.
LEADMALE: 
LEADMALE:Aw.
OTHERFEMALE:Steven, once you get to know him, he's really a wonderful guy.
SUPFEMALE:He's very good-hearted, he's sensitive, he's-he's good-looking, he's caring.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, he reminds me a lot of you.
LEADMALE:What?! Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:Just think about it.
SUPFEMALE:Do you remember the first time you came to my parents' house? You-you had this headband on, and the real long hair and-and your ripped jeans.
SUPMALE:God, you scared my mother half to death.
OTHERFEMALE: My father thought you were Cher.
SUPMALE:Look, Elyse, I know what you're getting at here, but it's a completely different situation.
SUPMALE:When I was Nick's age, I was goal-oriented.
OTHERFEMALE:I-I had a career in mind.
SUPMALE:I had a college degree.
LEADFEMALE:That may be true, but there is something you have in common with Nick.
LEADFEMALE:It's the way that you loved and cared for me when you were a young man it's-it's the same way that-that Nick loves and cares for Mallory now.
LEADMALE:That's a real rare thing to find.
SUPFEMALE: Dad, I hope you're happy, making Nick stay at the Hi-De-Ho Hotel.
SUPMALE:You don't understand the impact you have on Nick.
SUPFEMALE:And he really cares a lot what you think of him.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Nick is one of the sweetest guys I know.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'd do anything to have a boyfriend like him.
OTHERMALE:Jennifer, go stand in the corner.
OTHERMALE: - 
LEADFEMALE:Oh, um - Hi.
LEADMALE:Uh, I just came by to pick up my toothbrush.
LEADMALE:MALLORY/JENNIFER/
OTHERMALE:I'll get it.
LEADMALE:Nick, come in.
SUPFEMALE:Uh make yourself at home.
SUPMALE:What is this, a trap? No, no, I, uh I think we need to talk.
OTHERFEMALE:I, uh I realize I made things pretty unpleasant for you these last few days.
OTHERFEMALE:Years.
SUPFEMALE:When I first met you, you didn't strike me as the sort of young man I wanted for my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:And now? Well when you say "now," do you mean right now?  Look, uh Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton, sit down.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I know I am not exactly the kind of guy you wished your daughter had fallen in love with.
SUPFEMALE:But I got to tell you, uh, you know, uh I'm really happy being me.
LEADMALE:I like me.
LEADFEMALE:I would go out and buy me a Coke.
LEADFEMALE:But if you don't like me and if you're never gonna like me, I mean, hey, that's the way it's got to be, you know? But I love your daughter, and I want to be with her for the rest of my life.
SUPFEMALE:And I want you to know that I am gonna take excellent care of her.
LEADMALE:I know you will, Nick.
LEADMALE:And, listen about whether I'm ever gonna like you or not  I like you right now.
LEADFEMALE:You have respect for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:You have respect for my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:I admire that in a man.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE: - Thanks, Dad.
LEADFEMALE: I knew I shouldn't have said anything.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE: Dad, do we have to rehearse this again? Just one more time, Andy, to be sure you know your lines.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:"We're going to the dentist, we'll be there in a while.
LEADMALE:He's really not a menace, he's there to help us smile.
SUPFEMALE:" "He'll clean your teeth and make them white.
SUPFEMALE:"Your mouth will look like new.
LEADMALE:"He'll check your gums, he'll fix your bite, "and afterwards, if you didn't cry, your mom and dad can take you to the zoo.
OTHERMALE:" I'm not so sure about this rhyme, Andy.
LEADMALE:Who who wrote this? - My teacher.
SUPFEMALE:It's very good.
OTHERMALE:It's very, very good.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:What are you guys reading? Well, it's a school play about dental hygiene.
OTHERFEMALE:Andy got one of the lead roles.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Are you playing the dentist? I'm the permanent molar.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:That's very good! That's how Marlon Brando got his start.
LEADMALE:I remember I was in a dental hygiene play in, uh, second grade.
LEADMALE:We did our production of Annie Get Your Gums.
SUPMALE: I-I played the ingenue.
SUPMALE:I was, uh Jamie Lee Dental Floss.
SUPFEMALE:I still remember my line.
LEADFEMALE: I'm gonna get between you two molars if it's the last thing I do!  Mommy, help! Jamie Lee, stop being dental floss.
SUPFEMALE:You're scaring your brother.
LEADFEMALE: Alex isn't here yet, is he? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, not yet.
SUPFEMALE:Good, he's been driving me crazy lately.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, you've got to be a little more patient with Alex.
LEADMALE:He's really worried about whether or not he's gonna get this job.
LEADFEMALE:O'Brien, Mathers & Clark is one of the biggest investment banking firms on Wall Street.
LEADFEMALE:This is the big time.
LEADMALE:Or, as Alex so lovingly puts it, his "ticket out of this dump.
SUPFEMALE:" All right, I understand his anxiety, but-but we live here, too.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I can't believe he won't let us use the phone just because he's expecting a call from-from O'Brien, Mathers & Clark.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, he's not here now.
LEADMALE:There's no reason you can't use the phone.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah?  ALEX 
OTHERMALE:Mallory, put down the phone.
LEADFEMALE:I repeat, Mallory, put down the phone.
SUPFEMALE: - That's better.
LEADMALE:This has been a public service announcement.
LEADMALE:And let me tell you, that's not the worst part about this whole New York thing.
LEADFEMALE:He's acting like he lives there already.
LEADFEMALE:Yesterday, I went to get in the car, he throws open the car door, throws me out, and says, "Find your own cab, pal.
SUPFEMALE:" Well, yeah, all right, look, I-I'm sure once Alex hears about this job and hopefully gets it everything will be fine around here.
LEADMALE:Well, I hope so, because if I hear one more word about New York, I'm gonna scream.
LEADFEMALE:Start spreading the news  I'm leaving today You've been a wonderful sister.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be a part of it Get yourself a little something New York, New York Alex, that's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! Why are you congratulating him, Dad? He didn't sing it that well.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mallory, he got the, he got the job.
OTHERFEMALE:You did get the job, didn't you? Because you really didn't sing it that well.
LEADMALE:I got the job! - Oh, Alex, great, great! Yes! Yes! Did you hear that, Mom? I'm gonna be the youngest executive in the history of O'Brien, Mathers & Clark.
LEADMALE:Mom, I am gonna be rich.
LEADMALE: That's wonderful.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm so excited for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, we hate to admit it, too, Alex, but we're excited for you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:You have something for me? Thank you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, we're excited for you.
LEADFEMALE:How rich? Well, Mal, you know how much money Nick is gonna make in his entire lifetime? I should pass him by Thursday.
LEADMALE:Well, at least you're staying humble.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Dad, it's hard to be humble when you are gonna make $75,000 a year.
LEADMALE:Alex, that is a lot of money it's very impressive but don't forget to ask this 
OTHERMALE:Will it bring you fulfillment? Dad, it'll bring it it'll clean it and it'll have it pressed for me in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:This is a culmination of all my dreams.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be winging to Gotham, I'm gonna be hobnobbing with the bigwigs.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, lunch at the plaza, date with a different Rockette every night.
SUPMALE:Well, just don't get them mad, 'cause they could kick the hell out of you.
SUPMALE:So I guess this means you'll be moving to New York.
LEADMALE:Well, of course I'll be moving to New York, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:That, uh that, uh, Columbus-to-Manhattan commute is really a bear.
OTHERMALE:So, so when will you go? In the fall? The f Mom, get real; the fall? They got me.
LEADFEMALE:They know what they got; they want me next week.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, would you wait until the fall to get me? Well, Alex, that's not enough time.
LEADMALE:We have to get your plane ticket No, done, paid for.
OTHERFEMALE:We have to get you a place to live.
LEADFEMALE:Done, paid for.
SUPMALE:Well, sheets, towels, pillowcases.
LEADMALE:Done.
SUPFEMALE:Taking yours.
LEADMALE:Well, Alex, that's just not right.
LEADMALE:I mean, don't they understand, this really isn't enough time.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait, Mom, Mom, if-if they want him there in a week, I'm sure we can get him out of here in a week.
LEADMALE:That's right, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'll be happy to help you pack.
LEADMALE:You want to start now? Girl, girls, girls, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you're being very cavalier about this, but, uh, let's face it, I mean, someday, you're gonna miss me.
LEADMALE:We know that.
LEADMALE:We already miss him.
LEADMALE: We're just simply saying that if you want to start packing now, then you want what we want.
LEADMALE: Look, look, look.
LEADMALE:Let's not, uh, let's not rush this.
LEADMALE:This is a moment to be relished.
OTHERMALE:Alex, we're all very proud of you.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of like to savor this moment myself.
SUPFEMALE: I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:Alex is finally leaving the nest, huh? Sprouting wings, flying out on your own, huh? Journeying beyond the borders of Keaton Land to the uncharted regions of the unknown.
SUPMALE: Flying against the wind.
SUPMALE:Fighting the odds.

SUPMALE:Well, it's just been there's been a fine tradition of father-son farewell discussions in the Keaton family.
LEADFEMALE:You may remember what my father said to me as I left to venture out into the world.
LEADFEMALE:"Get out and take your brother with you"? Well, I don't remember the exact words.
OTHERMALE:But the important thing is the sentiment.
SUPFEMALE:Passing of advice from one generation to the other, and, uh, well I'd like to do the same thing for you, my son.

SUPMALE:Dad, uh thanks for your advice.
SUPFEMALE:Try and keep it in mind.
LEADMALE:You know, Alex, you and I have disagreed on, well almost everything, uh but one thing I've always admired about you is your passion for what you believe in.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, look, when you get into the business world, there's gonna be a lot of pressure on you to compromise your beliefs.
LEADMALE:But, Alex don't lose your passion.
SUPFEMALE:More importantly don't lose your keys.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna miss you, Dad.

SUPMALE:Mom, believe me, it's no big deal, one way or the other.
LEADMALE:You want it or not? Hey, look, I'll tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you keep it, get a copy made, you bring it to New York when you come visit me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Alex, um, we're not just gonna be flying all over the country for you, you know.
SUPMALE:What's the matter with Mom? Oh, you know her.
LEADFEMALE:She hates to fly.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Jen.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell are you doing? Me? Well, um Well, you know, you, um S-Since you're leaving soon, I just wanted to see your room the way you like to keep it once more.
SUPMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:It's very nice.
LEADFEMALE:How do you explain the tape measure? The tape measure? Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Well, um I'm taking wood shop in school.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:And I was gonna surprise you with a new floor.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, sorry to spoil your surprise, Jen.
LEADMALE:Okay, I admit it, Alex.
LEADFEMALE: I-I was gonna bring my stereo in here and turn this into a music room after you leave.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sor A music room, Jen? I've calculated the national debt in this room.
OTHERFEMALE:And you're gonna play the devil's music in here? Jen, I'm shocked.
SUPFEMALE:I am shocked no, I'm dismayed.
LEADMALE:No, this room is gonna stay exactly as it is.
LEADFEMALE:It's gonna be a It's gonna be a shrine.
OTHERFEMALE:It's gonna be a shrine to me.
SUPMALE:And after I'm gone, you put up the little velvet ropes.
LEADMALE:You can bring on the tour buses and charge a buck a head.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:In two years, we'll be able to buy an ice cream cone.
OTHERFEMALE:N-No actual ice cream, just the cone.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
LEADFEMALE:No, Jen, I'm telling you, people are gonna line up just to see this autographed picture of Nixon.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the picture of Nixon I'm sorry, I completely forgot.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna have to get valet parking now.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Jen, you always surprise me.
SUPMALE:How can you be so politically naive, being as smart as you are? I mean, Jen, you're almost as smart as I am.
SUPMALE: Well, Alex, you know, since you're leaving soon, I can break this to you.
SUPMALE:I'm smarter than you are.
SUPFEMALE:Obviously, my imminent departure has clouded your excellent but slightly inferior mind.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm smarter than you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Try me.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Jen, I'm not gonna try you.
LEADFEMALE:of what number? You have five minutes; take your time.
OTHERMALE:That's close.
LEADMALE:Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:Annoying.
SUPFEMALE:But interesting.
LEADFEMALE:All I want to know, Jen, is what good is that gonna do you as you stroll through the third most populous city in Tanzania purchasing its three major exports? Well, it would give me pause for thought as I strolled through downtown Zanzibar with an armful of cotton, coffee and sisal.
LEADMALE:That is such a lucky guess.
LEADMALE:You know, Alex, to be fair, you did teach me everything I know.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERMALE:Never do that again.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we just call it a tie? I mean, the most important part about it is you've always been there for me.
LEADMALE:Tutoring me, pushing me to do better, to achieve everything that I could possibly achieve.
SUPMALE:And I thank you for that.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Jen.
LEADMALE:So, I guess the question is what use are you gonna put all that knowledge to? Well, I was thinking of going to law school, maybe becoming an anti-trust attorney, and possibly putting you in jail in a few years.
LEADFEMALE:Hang on to your dreams, Jen.
OTHERMALE:I think I'll go now.
SUPMALE:Feel much more comfortable measuring your room after you move out.
LEADMALE:You're a sensitive gal.

OTHERMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Sewing.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want us to do? Put up little velvet ropes when you're gone and keep it as a shrine? What kind of a pompous fool do you take me for? Oh, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:You know what, Alex? No.
SUPMALE:What, Mal? I guess I'm really proud of you.
LEADMALE:I mean, I am.

OTHERFEMALE:" I'm gonna miss you, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:I know.

SUPMALE:We are really gonna miss you.
LEADFEMALE:Y-You've been my best friend ever since you moved in across the street 18 years ago.
LEADMALE:You're-you're like a big brother to me.
LEADMALE:You've taught me everything I know about life, love, romance.
LEADMALE:The fact that I still don't have a girlfriend and people won't even talk to me on the 976 party line that doesn't change my feelings about you.
SUPMALE:Well, Skippy, it's been a pleasure knowing you.
LEADFEMALE:You're truly one of the most unique people I've ever met.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Alex, don't go.

LEADFEMALE:I mean, I am gonna be your brother-in-law one day.
LEADMALE:Let's not jump the gun here, Nick.

SUPMALE: Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, Alex, you know, I've been thinking about it a lot.
LEADFEMALE:I got the whole proposal planned out, you know? Yeah, uh, how about I show you how I'm gonna do it? I'd rather not see this.

SUPFEMALE:I've watched you blossom into a beautiful young woman.
LEADFEMALE:My, is it getting warm in here? This is like the nuthouse version of Romeo and Juliet.
LEADFEMALE:When I see you on the back of my bike, your lustrous hair blowing in the breeze it just makes me realize how very much in love with you I am.
SUPFEMALE:And it just makes me want to sing one of my favorite love songs.
SUPFEMALE:Here she comes Uh, just a-walkin' down the street Singing do-wah diddy Diddy-dum, diddy-do I think the key word here is "dumb.

LEADMALE: I even had them write a message on it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's-that's real sweet, Lauren.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was supposed to say, "Good luck in the Big Apple, Alex," but that's all they could fit.
OTHERMALE:Well, I think "goo" pretty much covers it.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:Look, I can't stay long.
LEADMALE:I just wanted to wish you all the best in New York.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:So I guess you're finally gonna get your wish.

LEADFEMALE:I have a good idea.
LEADMALE:Why don't we go out for pizza, okay, and celebrate Andy learning his lines.
SUPMALE: Yeah.
SUPMALE:Also, 'cause I forgot to get anything out for dinner.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:  Well, are you coming? We're all going out for some pizza.
LEADMALE:Ah, pizza.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, no, that sounds great, Mom, but I got a lot of important stuff I got to do tonight.
LEADMALE:What stuff? I-I you know, kind of packing up and moving to the Big Apple kind of stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I got to, uh, I got to call my landlord and make sure he got my deposit check.
LEADMALE:I got to make sure the electricity's turned on.
LEADFEMALE:I got to call Mayor Koch about that key to the city thing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, it's only gonna take us an hour to eat.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you make the calls later? Uh, Ma, I'd just feel a little more comfortable if I got it done tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADMALE:What? Is-is there a problem with that? No, no, that's fine.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
SUPMALE:Mom, what's-what's the matter with you? I said, nothing.
LEADMALE:Look, this is a very big deal here.
OTHERMALE:I'm-I'm not just going across the street.
LEADMALE:I'm picking my whole life up, and I'm taking it to New York.
OTHERFEMALE:I swear that's all I hear lately.
LEADMALE:"New York! New York!" Well, maybe you've been listening to a little too much Sinatra, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Wonderfully funny, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:What is going on with you, Mom? Ever since I got this job, you're treating me like I'm not a member of this family.
LEADFEMALE:A member of this family would be going out for pizza, because that's what the family is doing tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe what I'm hearing! I have some important things to do tonight.
SUPMALE:Why is that so hard to understand? What I don't understand is the way you've been acting ever since this whole job business started.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, Mom, fine.
OTHERMALE:Okay, why don't you just tell me how I've been acting.
LEADMALE:Like an ungrateful, arrogant, selfish, insufferable little boy who doesn't have any time for his family now that he's become such a big shot.
LEADFEMALE: Well, if that's the way you feel about it, Mom, that's your problem.
OTHERMALE:No, no, Alex, that is your problem.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's your problem.
LEADFEMALE:Is there a problem? Alex refuses to go out for pizza.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, that's right, I do.
LEADMALE:Call the pizza cops, haul me away.
LEADMALE:Well, you guys don't have to argue.
LEADMALE:I mean, you know, we can go out for Chinese food.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
LEADFEMALE:You shouldn't listen to this woman.
SUPFEMALE:She's being completely irrational! Hey, hey, hey, don't talk to me that way.
LEADMALE:All right, hol-hold on.
SUPMALE:Hold on there, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Alex, you're really forgetting something real fast, you know? We have been there for you financially and emotionally.
LEADFEMALE:We put a roof over your head - Oh.
LEADMALE:And food on your plate for 22 years! All right, okay, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Is that what this is about? It's about thank you? Well, thank you, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:But guess what.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need your food anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:And I don't need your roof.
OTHERMALE:You know, I'm not waiting till next week to leave.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna stay, I'm gonna watch Andy's play tomorrow night, and then I'm out of here the next morning! Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How was your day? Well, I was kind of tired.
SUPMALE:As you know, I didn't get much sleep last night.
LEADFEMALE:It's not my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I believe it was you who kicked me out of bed four times during the night yelling, "Is that any way to treat your mother?" I'm sorry, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm just so upset.
LEADMALE:I mean, look, w-we're great parents, aren't we? You know, sensitive, caring, gentle.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I I'm not finished! Uh, sorry.
LEADMALE:You were up to, uh, "gentle.
LEADFEMALE:" Damn right, we're gentle! And considerate and patient.
LEADMALE:And he he just takes it all for granted.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, there are two sides to this problem.
SUPFEMALE:No, there are not.
LEADMALE:What's the other side? Alex has a lot of pressure to deal with.
SUPMALE: "Oh, Alex has a lot of pressure to deal with.
LEADFEMALE:" This is his first real experience away from home.
OTHERMALE: "This is his first real experience away from home.
LEADMALE:" Have you ever noticed a sarcastic echo in this kitchen before? Steven, Alex is going off to start a whole new life.
SUPMALE:He is thrilled.
LEADMALE:He is happier than he's ever been.
OTHERFEMALE:And he's only thinking about one person.
SUPMALE:Not you, not me.
LEADMALE:He's thinking about him.
OTHERMALE:He is totally and completely self-centered.
OTHERMALE:But he's always been that way.
SUPFEMALE:I know, I know, but why has he always been that way? I mean, we're not that way.
LEADFEMALE:Wh And he has our genes.
OTHERMALE:Why? Why aren't our genes in him, huh? I mean, oh, look at you.
LEADMALE:Y-You're a wonderful man.
OTHERMALE:You're warm, you're caring.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm not finished! Ugh! I-I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:And-and I am warm and caring, too.
SUPFEMALE:That goes without saying.
SUPFEMALE:You don't think I'm right about this, do you? Elyse, forgive me, but I don't think there is a right or wrong to this situation.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm telling you, there is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I would disagree with you, but But, but, but what, what, what?! But I'm afraid to.
SUPFEMALE:I don't expect you to understand, Steven.
SUPMALE:You're a man.
LEADMALE: Hey, uh, yeah, you're right about that, Elyse.
SUPFEMALE:Us men we don't, uh we're too dumb to figure out nothing.
LEADFEMALE:What's this we're sitting at? Hey, a table.
LEADFEMALE:Knock it off, Steven.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious.
OTHERMALE:See -  it's different for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a woman.
LEADMALE:Duh.
LEADFEMALE:What's a woman? I'm telling you.
LEADFEMALE: Elyse, men have feelings about these things, too.
SUPFEMALE: Duh.
LEADFEMALE:What's a man? All right.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Elyse.
SUPMALE:Obvious, I can't talk to you about this now.
LEADMALE:Steven-Steven, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I'm-I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm I'm just upset and really confused.
SUPMALE:I know you are.
LEADFEMALE:I'm feeling it, too.
LEADMALE:But you have got to talk these things out.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:To communicate.
SUPFEMALE:If not with him, then with me.
SUPMALE:Let's-let's face it.
LEADFEMALE:Before you know it, these kids will all be leaving home.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be just you and me.
SUPMALE:Oh, God, I'm so depressed! Once you get to know me, I'm a pretty nice guy.
OTHERMALE:Steven, I I don't mean about you and me.
LEADMALE:I Oh, I I love you so much for putting up with me.
SUPFEMALE:How can I ever thank you? Please don't kick me out of bed tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'll think about it.
LEADMALE: 
LEADMALE:Well, look who's here! The permanent molar.
SUPFEMALE:Please don't bite me! -  I won't.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not that kind of tooth, Mom.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, uh, actually, Andy, molars do bite.
LEADFEMALE:I know, as I was once bitten by my cousin Davey, who, after several seasons of semipro hockey, only had molars.
LEADFEMALE:Why'd he bite you, Nick? Well, I bit him.
LEADMALE:It was a, uh, phase the whole family was going through.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why don't we go.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:We don't want to be late.
LEADFEMALE:Alex! Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get my coat.
LEADMALE:  Alex, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure, Dad.
LEADMALE:Uh, look, Alex, your mother is really upset.
SUPMALE:I think it would be nice if you went over and talked to her.
SUPFEMALE: About what? About whatever it is that's bothering you two.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Dad, I didn't do anything wrong, okay? If anything, she should be talking to me.
OTHERMALE:Look, Alex.
SUPMALE:Alex, please.
OTHERMALE:I've found that in dealing with your mother in situations like this, doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
LEADMALE:I always apologize.
LEADFEMALE:Works like crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Then you apologize.
SUPFEMALE: Alex, why do you have to be so stubborn? Why does she have to be so stubborn? I asked her.
SUPMALE:She answered, "Why do you have to be so stubborn?" What'd you say? I just apologized.
LEADMALE:Dad, I appreciate what you're trying to do here.
SUPMALE:I just don't feel like I have anything to say to her.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, this is so frustrating.
SUPMALE:You're just like your mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Good evening, everyone.
OTHERMALE:Would you all please take your seats? Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I think there are some over here.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:The Greenvale Elementary School would like to welcome you this evening to our production of The Whole Tooth and Nothing but the Tooth.

SUPMALE:Soon it's gonna be time for me to go.
LEADMALE:Well, looks like it's time for me to go.
SUPFEMALE:Sure wish I could get out of here.
LEADMALE:I got to be on Wall Street by 9:00.
SUPFEMALE:Tooth Fairy, come and get me.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, what's the hurry? Mom, you know, I don't think you realize how valuable I am in the outside world.
LEADMALE:Under a pillow, I'm worth as much as 25 cents.
LEADMALE:Even more on the open market.
SUPMALE:But, honey, there's so much to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:I got to go, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:A permanent tooth is breathing down my neck.
LEADMALE:Besides I kind of get the feeling maybe you don't want me around anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:Of course I want you around.
OTHERMALE:What You're my little baby tooth! Then how come you yelled at me yesterday? Oh, I didn't mean to.
LEADMALE:I was angry.
SUPFEMALE:I-I didn't know what I was saying.
LEADFEMALE:I got to go, Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:Will you come back and visit me? I can't be flying all over the country for you.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to me.
OTHERMALE:Alex? Alex! Alex!  Mm.
LEADMALE:Alex, you forgot to pack your tie.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's not like you don't have others.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, with all your ties, it's hard to believe you've only got one neck.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you, uh, go out for ice cream with the others? Just didn't feel like it.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't feel like it either.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll get out of your way.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I can't take this anymore.
SUPFEMALE:What did I do to make you so upset at me? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing, honey.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It's-it's me.
SUPFEMALE:It's-it's all me.
SUPFEMALE:I-I just Just what?  Mom, we got to talk about this.
SUPMALE:I mean, I'm not leaving home like this.
LEADMALE:What's going on? W It's-it's not it's not that I don't-don't want you to be happy.
LEADFEMALE:It's it's not that I don't want you to-to be successful and have everything you want.
SUPMALE:I mean, I do.
LEADMALE:I-I want you to be happy.
LEADFEMALE:I I just Just what? Well, if if I could keep you in this house forever, I would.
LEADMALE: I-I don't know what to say to that, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE: Nothing to say to that.
LEADFEMALE:Why? What do you say to that? Uh, it's a crazy thing to think.
OTHERMALE:It's a crazy thing for a mother to think.
OTHERMALE:I mean I mean, I know what-what I-I should be doing.
SUPMALE:I sh-should've washed your clothes and packed your bags and made you a cake, given you a hug and send you on your way.
LEADFEMALE:And damn it, that's what I was planning to do! Mm, I-I just, I just couldn't do it.
LEADMALE:See, Mom this isn't all about you.
LEADMALE:I'm-I'm the one who's going out there.
SUPMALE:I'm the one who's rushing into God knows what.
LEADFEMALE:All my life, I've planned for this moment.
LEADMALE:Alex P.
LEADFEMALE:Keaton.
OTHERFEMALE:Brilliant young financial executive.
SUPMALE:I mean, that's who I'm supposed to be, right? What if I don't make it? What if it doesn't work out? And I'm finished, Mom.
LEADMALE:I mean, that's it.
SUPFEMALE:It was all about nothing.
LEADFEMALE:And that scares the hell out of me, and I don't understand why-why you can't understand that.
LEADFEMALE:I understand it, Alex.
LEADMALE:You're scared.
OTHERFEMALE:But you're always scared or worried or nervous about things, and But you always come out on top.
LEADMALE:Things always work out for you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's great, Mom.
LEADMALE:Is-is there something wrong with that? I don't, I don't Do you resent that? No.
LEADFEMALE:No, I-I don't resent that.
LEADMALE:What I do resent is the callous joy you seem to be taking in leaving this house.
SUPMALE:Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
SUPMALE:W-Wait, I'm not finished! - Here you go again.
OTHERFEMALE:'Cause, see, if it were me leaving this family, I wouldn't be going, "Bye-bye! Bye-bye!  Bye-bye! Kiss, kiss, kiss.
LEADMALE:I love you! I'm going off to my new life!" Ah, start spreading the news, I'm leaving today! 'Cause if it were me if it were me, it would break my heart! It would tear me up! Well, don't you know how hard it is for me?! I mean, don't you know how hard it is for me to walk out that door? Every time I've left this house, I've always come back, but this is it, Mom.
OTHERMALE:And everybody else seems to understand how hard that is for me.
LEADMALE:Everybody else has been real supportive Dad, Jen, Mal, even Andy but not you! Damn it, why can't you be happy for me?! You're my mother! Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm your mother.
SUPMALE:I'm Alex Keaton's mother.
LEADFEMALE:That's what this is all about.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, so we've established that you're my mother.
LEADMALE:See, you don't, you don't seem to understand what it's like for me.
LEADFEMALE:See, I feel like I'm standing on something real high and looking down at all the pieces of my life, and I can see who I am.
SUPFEMALE:And I see this this very big part of me that makes me who I am I see that part breaking away.
SUPMALE:And I know that it's right, and I know it's supposed to happen, but I don't want to let go.
SUPMALE: You're not, you're not gonna lose me, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there's a lot of big changes ahead, but you're still my mother.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I'm still Alex Keaton.
LEADMALE:I'm still Elyse Keaton's son.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:It's not such a bad job, huh?  Are you kidding me? I got the best mom around.
SUPMALE:Remember when I was a little kid, and, uh and you'd come and pick me up at the playground?  Know what the other kids said? The other kids would say, "There goes Alex's mom.
SUPMALE:What a knockout.
SUPFEMALE:"  Go on.
LEADMALE:Mom, you-you were the hippest, coolest, classiest, best-looking mom around.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
OTHERFEMALE:No, better than that I had a mom that'd always listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:Anything that was bothering me, I could talk to her about.
SUPFEMALE:Until this week.
LEADMALE:Far enough.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:You know what this makes me think of? All those times when your father and I would go to open house at night at your school, and we'd sit in your classroom.
LEADFEMALE:And I'd-I'd hear these-these mothers come in, and they'd go, "Oh, that's Alex Keaton's mother.
LEADFEMALE:Now, he's the smart one that the other kids won't play with.
OTHERMALE:"  And I'd-I'd get upset.
LEADFEMALE:I'd think, I'm not just Alex Keaton's mother.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Elyse Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:I'm an individual.
SUPFEMALE:I'm-I'm a person in my own right.
SUPMALE:And then I'd-I'd just stop, and I'd think, I love being Alex Keaton's mother.
SUPMALE: It's not such a bad job, is it? It has its moments.
SUPMALE:Well, I should let you get some sleep, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You've got an early flight to catch.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mom, listen, um, you know, it could be pretty crazy in the morning, so if I don't get a chance to say this to you, I want to say it to you 
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna miss you so much.
LEADMALE:Honey, I'm gonna miss you, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you're Alex Keaton's mother.
LEADMALE:Um, who am I kidding? I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
LEADMALE:Uh, why don't we go downstairs to the kitchen, and-and you can buy me a cup of coffee.
LEADMALE:Well, on your salary, you better be buying.
LEADMALE: No, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Michele Briganti was not my first girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Ana Krewson was my first girlfriend.
LEADMALE:No, no Ana Krewson, um, beat you up in the back of the Little League field.
SUPMALE:No, see, that was Michele Briganti.
OTHERMALE:You're wrong.
LEADFEMALE:So, what, do you want to bet, Mom? How much do you want to bet? Dollar.
SUPFEMALE:A dollar? Pshaw! All right, five dollars.
LEADMALE:No, it's too much.
LEADFEMALE:A dollar.
LEADFEMALE:It's a bet.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Hey, Dad, Dad, settle a bet.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Dad!  We can walk on coals or have ninjas fight us but be sure not to get gingivitis.
LEADFEMALE:  
OTHERMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse.
OTHERMALE:I-I I was having a nightmare.
LEADMALE:I dreamt I was Nick.
SUPMALE: How did I get here? Well, uh, about m-midnight, you came down to sit and have coffee with me and Alex, and we were having coffee, so you went to the refrigerator to get some cream, and you just, you just never made it back.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Cream, anyone? It's yogurt now, Dad.
SUPMALE:Oh, wow, it's 7:15.
LEADFEMALE:Cab should be here any minute.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, uh, look, are-are you sure you don't want us to drive you to the airport? Oh, no, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:This is on, uh, O'Brien, Mathers & Clark's expense account.
LEADMALE:Come to think of it, I may even tip the driver this time.
SUPFEMALE: - Morning, Andy.
LEADMALE:You want some breakfast? Coffee, black, two sugars, and step on it.
LEADMALE:This is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, farmers don't even get up this early.
LEADMALE:Come on, everybody, let's have a little spirit.
LEADFEMALE:Alex is leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just give him a big, energetic Keaton send-off, okay? Well, looks like we're the only ones with any stamina around here, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:These namby-pambies have nothing on us.
SUPFEMALE:Nah, you tired? No, I'm fine, Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:So you're leaving today, huh? That's right, Mal.
OTHERMALE:This is our last morning in this kitchen together as housemates.
LEADMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Next time we see each other, a new phase of our lives will have begun.
LEADMALE:I'll be able to buy and sell you.
LEADFEMALE:Drop me a line.
SUPMALE: Oh, there's my cab.
LEADMALE: Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, so, uh I guess this is it, huh? The big send-off.
LEADMALE:Uh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, uh, I-I don't need any big send-off.
SUPFEMALE:I-I really couldn't take a big, emotional scene right now, so, um, why don't we just take our leave in a manner befitting uh, the youngest  executive at O'Brien, Mathers & Clark.
LEADMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:Well, in that spirit, good-bye, son.

LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:"We're going to the dentist, we'll be there in a while.
LEADFEMALE:He's really not a menace, he's there to help us smile.
LEADMALE:" "He'll clean your teeth and make them white.
SUPFEMALE:"Your mouth will look like new.
SUPMALE:"He'll check your gums, he'll fix your bite, "and afterwards, if you didn't cry, your mom and dad can take you to the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:" I'm not so sure about this rhyme, Andy.
LEADMALE:Who who wrote this? - My teacher.
LEADFEMALE:It's very good.
LEADFEMALE:It's very, very good.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:What are you guys reading? Well, it's a school play about dental hygiene.
SUPMALE:Andy got one of the lead roles.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Are you playing the dentist? I'm the permanent molar.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:That's very good! That's how Marlon Brando got his start.
LEADFEMALE:I remember I was in a dental hygiene play in, uh, second grade.
SUPMALE:We did our production of Annie Get Your Gums.
LEADMALE: I-I played the ingenue.
LEADFEMALE:I was, uh Jamie Lee Dental Floss.
LEADFEMALE:I still remember my line.
LEADMALE: I'm gonna get between you two molars if it's the last thing I do!  Mommy, help! Jamie Lee, stop being dental floss.
SUPFEMALE:You're scaring your brother.
LEADFEMALE: Alex isn't here yet, is he? No.
SUPMALE:No, not yet.
OTHERMALE:Good, he's been driving me crazy lately.
SUPFEMALE:Jennifer, you've got to be a little more patient with Alex.
SUPMALE:He's really worried about whether or not he's gonna get this job.
LEADMALE:O'Brien, Mathers & Clark is one of the biggest investment banking firms on Wall Street.
LEADFEMALE:This is the big time.
OTHERFEMALE:Or, as Alex so lovingly puts it, his "ticket out of this dump.
LEADFEMALE:" All right, I understand his anxiety, but-but we live here, too.
SUPMALE:I mean, I can't believe he won't let us use the phone just because he's expecting a call from-from O'Brien, Mathers & Clark.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he's not here now.
LEADFEMALE:There's no reason you can't use the phone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah?  
LEADMALE:Mallory, put down the phone.
LEADMALE:I repeat, Mallory, put down the phone.
LEADFEMALE: - That's better.
LEADMALE:This has been a public service announcement.
LEADMALE:And let me tell you, that's not the worst part about this whole New York thing.
OTHERFEMALE:He's acting like he lives there already.
LEADFEMALE:Yesterday, I went to get in the car, he throws open the car door, throws me out, and says, "Find your own cab, pal.
LEADMALE:" Well, yeah, all right, look, I-I'm sure once Alex hears about this job and hopefully gets it everything will be fine around here.
LEADMALE:Well, I hope so, because if I hear one more word about New York, I'm gonna scream.
OTHERFEMALE:Start spreading the news  I'm leaving today You've been a wonderful sister.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be a part of it Get yourself a little something New York, New York Alex, that's wonderful.

LEADFEMALE:I got the job! - Oh, Alex, great, great! Yes! Yes! Did you hear that, Mom? I'm gonna be the youngest executive in the history of O'Brien, Mathers & Clark.
LEADMALE:Mom, I am gonna be rich.

SUPFEMALE:Thank you, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You have something for me? Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, we're excited for you.
LEADMALE:How rich? Well, Mal, you know how much money Nick is gonna make in his entire lifetime? I should pass him by Thursday.
SUPMALE:Well, at least you're staying humble.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Dad, it's hard to be humble when you are gonna make $75,000 a year.
OTHERMALE:Alex, that is a lot of money it's very impressive but don't forget to ask this 
LEADMALE:Will it bring you fulfillment? Dad, it'll bring it it'll clean it and it'll have it pressed for me in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:This is a culmination of all my dreams.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna be winging to Gotham, I'm gonna be hobnobbing with the bigwigs.
SUPMALE:I mean, lunch at the plaza, date with a different Rockette every night.
SUPMALE:Well, just don't get them mad, 'cause they could kick the hell out of you.
SUPFEMALE:So I guess this means you'll be moving to New York.
LEADMALE:Well, of course I'll be moving to New York, Mom.
LEADMALE:That, uh that, uh, Columbus-to-Manhattan commute is really a bear.
LEADFEMALE:So, so when will you go? In the fall? The f Mom, get real; the fall? They got me.
SUPMALE:They know what they got; they want me next week.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, would you wait until the fall to get me? Well, Alex, that's not enough time.

LEADMALE:We have to get you a place to live.
SUPFEMALE:Done, paid for.
SUPMALE:Well, sheets, towels, pillowcases.
LEADMALE:Done.

LEADFEMALE:I mean, don't they understand, this really isn't enough time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, Mom, Mom, if-if they want him there in a week, I'm sure we can get him out of here in a week.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, I'll be happy to help you pack.
LEADMALE:You want to start now? Girl, girls, girls, girls.
SUPMALE:Now, you're being very cavalier about this, but, uh, let's face it, I mean, someday, you're gonna miss me.
LEADFEMALE:We know that.
LEADMALE:We already miss him.
OTHERFEMALE: We're just simply saying that if you want to start packing now, then you want what we want.
SUPFEMALE: Look, look, look.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not, uh, let's not rush this.
LEADFEMALE:This is a moment to be relished.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, we're all very proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Dad.
LEADMALE:Kind of like to savor this moment myself.
LEADMALE: I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:Alex is finally leaving the nest, huh? Sprouting wings, flying out on your own, huh? Journeying beyond the borders of Keaton Land to the uncharted regions of the unknown.
OTHERFEMALE: Flying against the wind.
SUPMALE:Fighting the odds.
SUPMALE:Uh, Dad, Dad, we could've had him out of here by now.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, you okay up there? You need any help with your stuff? No, it's okay, Dad, I can manage.
OTHERFEMALE: Come on, Jen, let's go.
LEADMALE:Chop-chop.
LEADFEMALE:Haven't got all day.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I can't do this.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, she can't carry all that stuff.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, your sister is not a Grand Canyon mule.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for noticing, Dad.
LEADMALE:Look, Jen, come on, one more trip.
LEADFEMALE:All you got left is the dresser.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex, I can't physically do this.
OTHERMALE: "I can't physically do this.
LEADMALE:" Come on, do you want me to live here for the rest of my life? I'll get that dresser.

LEADMALE:There's a load up there for you, too.
LEADMALE: Ow.
SUPFEMALE:Alex.
OTHERMALE:Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Come here, come here.
LEADFEMALE:What?  Anything you want to ask me about, uh, life? As a young man on his own for the first time.
SUPMALE:Not really, Dad, no.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's just been there's been a fine tradition of father-son farewell discussions in the Keaton family.
SUPFEMALE:You may remember what my father said to me as I left to venture out into the world.
LEADMALE:"Get out and take your brother with you"? Well, I don't remember the exact words.
LEADFEMALE:But the important thing is the sentiment.
LEADFEMALE:Passing of advice from one generation to the other, and, uh, well I'd like to do the same thing for you, my son.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, all right, well, what advice did your father give you? Neither a borrower nor a lender be.
SUPFEMALE:A penny saved is a penny earned.
OTHERFEMALE:If you swallow an apple seed an apple tree will grow in your stomach.
LEADMALE:A bird in the hand makes blowing your nose difficult.
SUPMALE:Your mother and I have done our job well.
LEADMALE:Now, Alex  Alex, when you get to the big city, you're gonna be walking down the street and some woman may sashay up to you dressed in some sort of provocative and scanty garb.
LEADFEMALE:You mean Aunt Miriam still lives in New York? No, Alex, these woman are even friendlier than Aunt Miriam.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, uh thanks for your advice.
LEADMALE:Try and keep it in mind.
LEADMALE:You know, Alex, you and I have disagreed on, well almost everything, uh but one thing I've always admired about you is your passion for what you believe in.
LEADFEMALE:Now, look, when you get into the business world, there's gonna be a lot of pressure on you to compromise your beliefs.
SUPFEMALE:But, Alex don't lose your passion.
SUPMALE:More importantly don't lose your keys.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna miss you, Dad.

LEADMALE:Well, hey, if you're gonna be that way about it, I don't want it.
LEADFEMALE:You take it.

SUPFEMALE:Uh, I don't need it, you take it.
LEADMALE:Mom, believe me, it's no big deal, one way or the other.
OTHERMALE:You want it or not? Hey, look, I'll tell you what.

LEADMALE:How can you be so politically naive, being as smart as you are? I mean, Jen, you're almost as smart as I am.
LEADMALE: Well, Alex, you know, since you're leaving soon, I can break this to you.
SUPMALE:I'm smarter than you are.
OTHERFEMALE:Obviously, my imminent departure has clouded your excellent but slightly inferior mind.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm smarter than you, Alex.
LEADMALE:Try me.
SUPFEMALE: Oh, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Jen, I'm not gonna try you.
OTHERMALE:of what number? You have five minutes; take your time.
SUPFEMALE:That's close.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:Annoying.
LEADFEMALE:But interesting.
LEADFEMALE:All I want to know, Jen, is what good is that gonna do you as you stroll through the third most populous city in Tanzania purchasing its three major exports? Well, it would give me pause for thought as I strolled through downtown Zanzibar with an armful of cotton, coffee and sisal.
SUPFEMALE:That is such a lucky guess.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Alex, to be fair, you did teach me everything I know.
LEADMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Never do that again.
LEADMALE:Why don't we just call it a tie? I mean, the most important part about it is you've always been there for me.
LEADFEMALE:Tutoring me, pushing me to do better, to achieve everything that I could possibly achieve.
LEADFEMALE:And I thank you for that.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:So, I guess the question is what use are you gonna put all that knowledge to? Well, I was thinking of going to law school, maybe becoming an anti-trust attorney, and possibly putting you in jail in a few years.
LEADFEMALE:Hang on to your dreams, Jen.
OTHERMALE:I think I'll go now.
SUPFEMALE:Feel much more comfortable measuring your room after you move out.
LEADMALE:You're a sensitive gal.
LEADFEMALE:  - Hey, Mallory.
SUPMALE:  What are you doing?  Me? Uh Well with you leaving and everything, um I was feeling nostalgic, so You're measuring it for a music room.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Sewing.
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you want us to do? Put up little velvet ropes when you're gone and keep it as a shrine? What kind of a pompous fool do you take me for? Oh, forget it.
LEADMALE:You know what, Alex? No.
OTHERFEMALE:What, Mal? I guess I'm really proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I am.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
LEADMALE:I'm very proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:That means a lot to me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean  I don't know anything about what it is that you do.
LEADFEMALE:But I know that you do it really well.
SUPFEMALE:And I think it's terrific the way you went out and-and got what you wanted.
LEADMALE:Whatever that is.
SUPFEMALE:And I mean that.
SUPMALE:Well, Mal, I'm proud of you.
OTHERFEMALE:And I mean that.
SUPFEMALE:Really? 'Cause sometimes I feel like you don't have respect for what I do.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mal.
LEADMALE:Come on, your fashion designs? You're brilliant.
OTHERMALE: - I mean, you're very talented.
LEADMALE: Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for noticing.
SUPMALE:Now that you're leaving, I want to talk to you about something.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? Your overcoat.
SUPMALE:Don't get mushy on me, Mal.
SUPFEMALE:You've got to promise me that when you get to New York, you will buy a new one this one's too stuffy.
SUPMALE:Well, Mal, I-I'm going to work for O'Brien, Mathers & Clark.
LEADMALE:They like stuffy.
LEADFEMALE:Their president's name is Bob "Stuffy" O'Brien.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, you got to listen to me.
SUPMALE:Give this one to Mr.
LEADMALE:Stuffy and start fresh.
LEADMALE:And when you're on Wall Street, and you're wearing one of those, uh, one of your boring, black, three-piece pinstripe suits, add a little splash of color somewhere.
SUPMALE:A red handkerchief or a rose or-or a little button that says, "I'm really not this dull.
LEADMALE:" I'm gonna miss you, Mal.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'll be the next one to move out, Alex.
SUPMALE:I hope I'm as successful as you are.
SUPMALE:I mean, in fashion.
OTHERFEMALE:Not in whatever it is that you do.
LEADFEMALE:I'll warm up New York for you, Mal.
OTHERMALE: Oh, excuse me, Alex.
SUPMALE:I didn't know you're in here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, get down here, get down here.
SUPFEMALE:All right.

LEADMALE: No, I-I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:All right, then it must be me.
LEADFEMALE: Nice work, gentlemen.
SUPMALE: Okay.
LEADMALE: Now to the matter of money.
LEADMALE:I believe there was a a fee discussed for this job.
LEADMALE:Uh, well, gee, Alex, all I can really afford to give you is a dollar and a quarter.
LEADMALE:We'll call it even, Skip.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, uh, you know, Alex this place ain't gonna be the same without you here.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, when I come over to talk to you, you ain't gonna be here.
LEADFEMALE:Won't affect our conversation any.
LEADMALE:No, Alex, he's right.
LEADFEMALE:We are really gonna miss you.
LEADMALE:Y-You've been my best friend ever since you moved in across the street 18 years ago.
LEADMALE:You're-you're like a big brother to me.
LEADFEMALE:You've taught me everything I know about life, love, romance.
LEADMALE:The fact that I still don't have a girlfriend and people won't even talk to me on the 976 party line that doesn't change my feelings about you.
OTHERMALE:Well, Skippy, it's been a pleasure knowing you.
LEADFEMALE:You're truly one of the most unique people I've ever met.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Alex, don't go.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Skippy, get a grip.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please, Alex, don't go! This is really beautiful.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE: Skippy.

LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, that's true, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I am gonna be your brother-in-law one day.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not jump the gun here, Nick.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I mean, you haven't even asked her yet, so there's still a good possibility that we're not gonna be related.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, Alex, you know, I've been thinking about it a lot.
OTHERMALE:I got the whole proposal planned out, you know? Yeah, uh, how about I show you how I'm gonna do it? I'd rather not see this.

LEADMALE:That way, in case I screw anything up, you can tell me, all right? Uh Skip, you be Mallory.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I can do that.
LEADFEMALE:Just stop me before I throw me out of the house.
SUPFEMALE: Mallory I've been thinking.
LEADMALE:We've been together now for quite some time, and, uh, I've really grown quite attached to you.
OTHERMALE:I've watched you blossom into a beautiful young woman.
LEADFEMALE:My, is it getting warm in here? This is like the nuthouse version of Romeo and Juliet.
LEADFEMALE:When I see you on the back of my bike, your lustrous hair blowing in the breeze it just makes me realize how very much in love with you I am.
LEADFEMALE:And it just makes me want to sing one of my favorite love songs.
LEADMALE:Here she comes Uh, just a-walkin' down the street Singing do-wah diddy Diddy-dum, diddy-do I think the key word here is "dumb.
SUPFEMALE:" What I mean is Skippy will you marry me? Yes.
SUPMALE:It's the best offer I've had in months.
SUPMALE:Oh!  Okay.
OTHERMALE:I now pronounce you idiot and wife.
OTHERMALE:There's a champagne reception in the kitchen.

LEADMALE:How you doing? - Good.
LEADFEMALE:I heard you were leaving.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:So I stopped by a bakery to get you a going-away cake, but they didn't have any, so I got you this going-away muffin instead.
OTHERFEMALE: I even had them write a message on it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's-that's real sweet, Lauren.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Well, it was supposed to say, "Good luck in the Big Apple, Alex," but that's all they could fit.
LEADMALE:Well, I think "goo" pretty much covers it.
LEADMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I can't stay long.
OTHERFEMALE:I just wanted to wish you all the best in New York.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:So I guess you're finally gonna get your wish.

SUPFEMALE:Hey! - 
LEADFEMALE:Oh! 
LEADMALE:Oh, boy! Don't eat sweets or I'll turn brown.
LEADMALE:Remember to brush me up and down.
OTHERFEMALE:Yay.
LEADFEMALE:That's terrific, honey.
SUPMALE:This costume - Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I was so touched by it, I wrote one for myself.
SUPMALE:Um we can walk on coals and have ninjas fight us, but be sure not to get gingivitis.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, this is great, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:We're gonna have a good time coming to see you at your play.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, all right, come on.
OTHERMALE:Let's go upstairs, Andy, all right? Let's get that costume off, get ready for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I have a good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't we go out for pizza, okay, and celebrate Andy learning his lines.
SUPMALE: Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Also, 'cause I forgot to get anything out for dinner.
LEADMALE:All right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:  Well, are you coming? We're all going out for some pizza.
LEADMALE:Ah, pizza.
SUPMALE:Uh, no, that sounds great, Mom, but I got a lot of important stuff I got to do tonight.
OTHERMALE:What stuff? I-I you know, kind of packing up and moving to the Big Apple kind of stuff.
LEADFEMALE:I got to, uh, I got to call my landlord and make sure he got my deposit check.
LEADFEMALE:I got to make sure the electricity's turned on.
SUPMALE:I got to call Mayor Koch about that key to the city thing.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, it's only gonna take us an hour to eat.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you make the calls later? Uh, Ma, I'd just feel a little more comfortable if I got it done tonight.
LEADMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADMALE:What? Is-is there a problem with that? No, no, that's fine.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:Mom, what's-what's the matter with you? I said, nothing.
LEADMALE:Look, this is a very big deal here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm-I'm not just going across the street.
LEADMALE:I'm picking my whole life up, and I'm taking it to New York.
LEADMALE:I swear that's all I hear lately.
LEADFEMALE:"New York! New York!" Well, maybe you've been listening to a little too much Sinatra, Mom.
LEADMALE:Wonderfully funny, Alex.
OTHERFEMALE:What is going on with you, Mom? Ever since I got this job, you're treating me like I'm not a member of this family.
OTHERFEMALE:A member of this family would be going out for pizza, because that's what the family is doing tonight.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe what I'm hearing! I have some important things to do tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Why is that so hard to understand? What I don't understand is the way you've been acting ever since this whole job business started.
LEADMALE:All right, Mom, fine.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, why don't you just tell me how I've been acting.
LEADMALE:Like an ungrateful, arrogant, selfish, insufferable little boy who doesn't have any time for his family now that he's become such a big shot.
LEADMALE: Well, if that's the way you feel about it, Mom, that's your problem.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, Alex, that is your problem.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's your problem.
LEADFEMALE:Is there a problem? Alex refuses to go out for pizza.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's right, I do.
LEADMALE:Call the pizza cops, haul me away.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you guys don't have to argue.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you know, we can go out for Chinese food.
LEADMALE:I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
SUPFEMALE:You shouldn't listen to this woman.
SUPFEMALE:She's being completely irrational! Hey, hey, hey, don't talk to me that way.
LEADMALE:All right, hol-hold on.
LEADMALE:Hold on there, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Alex, you're really forgetting something real fast, you know? We have been there for you financially and emotionally.
SUPFEMALE:We put a roof over your head - Oh.
LEADMALE:And food on your plate for 22 years! All right, okay, all right.
LEADMALE:Is that what this is about? It's about thank you? Well, thank you, Mom.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Dad.
LEADMALE:But guess what.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need your food anymore.
LEADMALE:And I don't need your roof.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm not waiting till next week to leave.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna stay, I'm gonna watch Andy's play tomorrow night, and then I'm out of here the next morning! Hi, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:How was your day? Well, I was kind of tired.
LEADMALE:As you know, I didn't get much sleep last night.
LEADMALE:It's not my fault.
LEADMALE:Well, I believe it was you who kicked me out of bed four times during the night yelling, "Is that any way to treat your mother?" I'm sorry, Steven.
SUPMALE:I-I'm just so upset.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, look, w-we're great parents, aren't we? You know, sensitive, caring, gentle.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I I'm not finished! Uh, sorry.
LEADMALE:You were up to, uh, "gentle.
LEADFEMALE:" Damn right, we're gentle! And considerate and patient.
OTHERMALE:And he he just takes it all for granted.
OTHERFEMALE:Elyse, there are two sides to this problem.
SUPFEMALE:No, there are not.
OTHERMALE:What's the other side? Alex has a lot of pressure to deal with.
SUPFEMALE: "Oh, Alex has a lot of pressure to deal with.
LEADMALE:" This is his first real experience away from home.
OTHERMALE: "This is his first real experience away from home.
LEADMALE:" Have you ever noticed a sarcastic echo in this kitchen before? Steven, Alex is going off to start a whole new life.
LEADMALE:He is thrilled.
LEADFEMALE:He is happier than he's ever been.
LEADFEMALE:And he's only thinking about one person.
LEADFEMALE:Not you, not me.
LEADMALE:He's thinking about him.
LEADMALE:He is totally and completely self-centered.
SUPFEMALE:But he's always been that way.
LEADMALE:I know, I know, but why has he always been that way? I mean, we're not that way.
SUPFEMALE:Wh And he has our genes.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Why aren't our genes in him, huh? I mean, oh, look at you.
LEADFEMALE:Y-You're a wonderful man.
SUPFEMALE:You're warm, you're caring.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I'm not finished! Ugh! I-I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:And-and I am warm and caring, too.
LEADMALE:That goes without saying.
SUPMALE:You don't think I'm right about this, do you? Elyse, forgive me, but I don't think there is a right or wrong to this situation.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm telling you, there is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I would disagree with you, but But, but, but what, what, what?! But I'm afraid to.
OTHERMALE:I don't expect you to understand, Steven.
SUPFEMALE:You're a man.
SUPMALE: Hey, uh, yeah, you're right about that, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Us men we don't, uh we're too dumb to figure out nothing.
OTHERMALE:What's this we're sitting at? Hey, a table.
LEADFEMALE:Knock it off, Steven.
OTHERMALE:I'm serious.
OTHERFEMALE:See -  it's different for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a woman.
LEADMALE:Duh.
LEADFEMALE:What's a woman? I'm telling you.
OTHERFEMALE: Elyse, men have feelings about these things, too.
SUPFEMALE: Duh.
LEADMALE:What's a man? All right.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Elyse.
LEADMALE:Obvious, I can't talk to you about this now.
LEADMALE:Steven-Steven, wait, wait.
SUPFEMALE:I'm-I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm I'm just upset and really confused.
OTHERMALE:I know you are.
LEADMALE:I'm feeling it, too.
SUPFEMALE:But you have got to talk these things out.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:To communicate.
LEADFEMALE:If not with him, then with me.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's-let's face it.
LEADMALE:Before you know it, these kids will all be leaving home.
LEADMALE:It'll be just you and me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, God, I'm so depressed! Once you get to know me, I'm a pretty nice guy.
LEADFEMALE:Steven, I I don't mean about you and me.
LEADFEMALE:I Oh, I I love you so much for putting up with me.
SUPFEMALE:How can I ever thank you? Please don't kick me out of bed tonight.
LEADMALE:I'll think about it.
OTHERMALE: 
OTHERMALE:Well, look who's here! The permanent molar.
LEADFEMALE:Please don't bite me! -  I won't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not that kind of tooth, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, well, uh, actually, Andy, molars do bite.
LEADFEMALE:I know, as I was once bitten by my cousin Davey, who, after several seasons of semipro hockey, only had molars.
LEADMALE:Why'd he bite you, Nick? Well, I bit him.
OTHERFEMALE:It was a, uh, phase the whole family was going through.
SUPMALE:Well, why don't we go.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:We don't want to be late.
SUPMALE:Alex! Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready.
SUPMALE:I'll get my coat.
LEADFEMALE:  Alex, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, look, Alex, your mother is really upset.
LEADMALE:I think it would be nice if you went over and talked to her.
SUPMALE: About what? About whatever it is that's bothering you two.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Dad, I didn't do anything wrong, okay? If anything, she should be talking to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Alex.
SUPMALE:Alex, please.
SUPMALE:I've found that in dealing with your mother in situations like this, doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
LEADMALE:I always apologize.
LEADFEMALE:Works like crazy.
LEADMALE:Fine, Dad.
LEADMALE:Then you apologize.
LEADMALE: Alex, why do you have to be so stubborn? Why does she have to be so stubborn? I asked her.
LEADFEMALE:She answered, "Why do you have to be so stubborn?" What'd you say? I just apologized.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, I appreciate what you're trying to do here.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't feel like I have anything to say to her.
LEADMALE:Alex, this is so frustrating.
LEADFEMALE:You're just like your mother.
OTHERMALE:Good evening, everyone.
LEADMALE:Would you all please take your seats? Thank you.
SUPMALE:I think there are some over here.
SUPMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:The Greenvale Elementary School would like to welcome you this evening to our production of The Whole Tooth and Nothing but the Tooth.
LEADFEMALE: Watch out, teeth.
SUPFEMALE:Here come the sweets.
LEADMALE:You can get cavities from those kind of treats.
LEADMALE: - Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble Don't eat sweets or I'll turn brown.
OTHERMALE:Remember to brush me up and down.

LEADMALE: Hi.
OTHERMALE:I'm a baby tooth.
SUPMALE:I've been here a long time, and I think I'm getting loose.
SUPFEMALE:Soon it'll be time for me to go! 
LEADMALE:Soon it's gonna be time for me to go.
LEADMALE:Well, looks like it's time for me to go.
SUPFEMALE:Sure wish I could get out of here.
LEADMALE:I got to be on Wall Street by 9:00.
SUPFEMALE:Tooth Fairy, come and get me.
SUPMALE:Alex, what's the hurry? Mom, you know, I don't think you realize how valuable I am in the outside world.
SUPFEMALE:Under a pillow, I'm worth as much as 25 cents.
LEADFEMALE:Even more on the open market.
LEADMALE:But, honey, there's so much to talk about.
LEADMALE:I got to go, Mom.
OTHERMALE:A permanent tooth is breathing down my neck.
LEADMALE:Besides I kind of get the feeling maybe you don't want me around anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Of course I want you around.
OTHERFEMALE:What You're my little baby tooth! Then how come you yelled at me yesterday? Oh, I didn't mean to.
LEADFEMALE:I was angry.
SUPMALE:I-I didn't know what I was saying.
LEADFEMALE:I got to go, Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Will you come back and visit me? I can't be flying all over the country for you.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Alex? Alex! Alex!  Mm.
LEADMALE:Alex, you forgot to pack your tie.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not like you don't have others.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, with all your ties, it's hard to believe you've only got one neck.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you, uh, go out for ice cream with the others? Just didn't feel like it.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't feel like it either.
SUPMALE:Well, I'll get out of your way.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't take this anymore.
LEADMALE:What did I do to make you so upset at me? Nothing.
OTHERMALE:Nothing, honey.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It's-it's me.
SUPMALE:It's-it's all me.
SUPMALE:I-I just Just what?  Mom, we got to talk about this.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'm not leaving home like this.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? W It's-it's not it's not that I don't-don't want you to be happy.
LEADMALE:It's it's not that I don't want you to-to be successful and have everything you want.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I do.
LEADMALE:I-I want you to be happy.
SUPFEMALE:I I just Just what? Well, if if I could keep you in this house forever, I would.
SUPFEMALE: I-I don't know what to say to that, Mom.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE: Nothing to say to that.
LEADFEMALE:Why? What do you say to that? Uh, it's a crazy thing to think.
SUPFEMALE:It's a crazy thing for a mother to think.
SUPMALE:I mean I mean, I know what-what I-I should be doing.
LEADFEMALE:I sh-should've washed your clothes and packed your bags and made you a cake, given you a hug and send you on your way.
LEADMALE:And damn it, that's what I was planning to do! Mm, I-I just, I just couldn't do it.
LEADMALE:See, Mom this isn't all about you.
LEADMALE:I'm-I'm the one who's going out there.
LEADMALE:I'm the one who's rushing into God knows what.
LEADMALE:All my life, I've planned for this moment.
OTHERMALE:Alex P.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Brilliant young financial executive.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, that's who I'm supposed to be, right? What if I don't make it? What if it doesn't work out? And I'm finished, Mom.
OTHERMALE:I mean, that's it.
SUPMALE:It was all about nothing.
LEADFEMALE:And that scares the hell out of me, and I don't understand why-why you can't understand that.
LEADMALE:I understand it, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:You're scared.
LEADFEMALE:But you're always scared or worried or nervous about things, and But you always come out on top.
LEADFEMALE:Things always work out for you.
LEADMALE:Well, that's great, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Is-is there something wrong with that? I don't, I don't Do you resent that? No.
SUPFEMALE:No, I-I don't resent that.
LEADMALE:What I do resent is the callous joy you seem to be taking in leaving this house.
OTHERMALE:Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
LEADMALE:W-Wait, I'm not finished! - Here you go again.
LEADMALE:'Cause, see, if it were me leaving this family, I wouldn't be going, "Bye-bye! Bye-bye!  Bye-bye! Kiss, kiss, kiss.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you! I'm going off to my new life!" Ah, start spreading the news, I'm leaving today! 'Cause if it were me if it were me, it would break my heart! It would tear me up! Well, don't you know how hard it is for me?! I mean, don't you know how hard it is for me to walk out that door? Every time I've left this house, I've always come back, but this is it, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:And everybody else seems to understand how hard that is for me.
LEADMALE:Everybody else has been real supportive Dad, Jen, Mal, even Andy but not you! Damn it, why can't you be happy for me?! You're my mother! Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I'm your mother.
LEADMALE:I'm Alex Keaton's mother.
LEADFEMALE:That's what this is all about.
LEADMALE:Okay, so we've established that you're my mother.
SUPMALE:See, you don't, you don't seem to understand what it's like for me.
SUPFEMALE:See, I feel like I'm standing on something real high and looking down at all the pieces of my life, and I can see who I am.
LEADFEMALE:And I see this this very big part of me that makes me who I am I see that part breaking away.
SUPMALE:And I know that it's right, and I know it's supposed to happen, but I don't want to let go.
LEADMALE: You're not, you're not gonna lose me, Mom.
LEADMALE:I mean, there's a lot of big changes ahead, but you're still my mother.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm still Alex Keaton.
LEADMALE:I'm still Elyse Keaton's son.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not such a bad job, huh?  Are you kidding me? I got the best mom around.
LEADFEMALE:Remember when I was a little kid, and, uh and you'd come and pick me up at the playground?  Know what the other kids said? The other kids would say, "There goes Alex's mom.
LEADFEMALE:What a knockout.
LEADFEMALE:"  Go on.
SUPMALE:Mom, you-you were the hippest, coolest, classiest, best-looking mom around.
LEADMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:No, better than that I had a mom that'd always listen to me.
LEADMALE:Anything that was bothering me, I could talk to her about.
SUPMALE:Until this week.
LEADFEMALE:Far enough.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You know what this makes me think of? All those times when your father and I would go to open house at night at your school, and we'd sit in your classroom.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'd-I'd hear these-these mothers come in, and they'd go, "Oh, that's Alex Keaton's mother.
LEADMALE:Now, he's the smart one that the other kids won't play with.
SUPMALE:"  And I'd-I'd get upset.
LEADMALE:I'd think, I'm not just Alex Keaton's mother.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Elyse Keaton.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm an individual.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm-I'm a person in my own right.
LEADFEMALE:And then I'd-I'd just stop, and I'd think, I love being Alex Keaton's mother.
LEADMALE: It's not such a bad job, is it? It has its moments.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I should let you get some sleep, honey.
LEADMALE:You've got an early flight to catch.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mom, listen, um, you know, it could be pretty crazy in the morning, so if I don't get a chance to say this to you, I want to say it to you 
LEADMALE:I'm gonna miss you so much.
OTHERMALE:Honey, I'm gonna miss you, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you're Alex Keaton's mother.
SUPMALE:Um, who am I kidding? I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
SUPMALE:Uh, why don't we go downstairs to the kitchen, and-and you can buy me a cup of coffee.
SUPFEMALE:Well, on your salary, you better be buying.
LEADFEMALE: No, Mom.
LEADMALE:Michele Briganti was not my first girlfriend.
SUPMALE:Ana Krewson was my first girlfriend.
SUPFEMALE:No, no Ana Krewson, um, beat you up in the back of the Little League field.
LEADFEMALE:No, see, that was Michele Briganti.
LEADFEMALE:You're wrong.
LEADMALE:So, what, do you want to bet, Mom? How much do you want to bet? Dollar.
LEADFEMALE:A dollar? Pshaw! All right, five dollars.
LEADMALE:No, it's too much.
SUPMALE:A dollar.
OTHERMALE:It's a bet.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dad, Dad, settle a bet.
SUPMALE:Hey, Dad!  We can walk on coals or have ninjas fight us but be sure not to get gingivitis.
LEADFEMALE: 
SUPMALE:Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Elyse.
SUPMALE:I-I I was having a nightmare.
LEADMALE:I dreamt I was Nick.
LEADFEMALE: How did I get here? Well, uh, about m-midnight, you came down to sit and have coffee with me and Alex, and we were having coffee, so you went to the refrigerator to get some cream, and you just, you just never made it back.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Cream, anyone? It's yogurt now, Dad.
LEADMALE:Oh, wow, it's 7:15.
LEADMALE:Cab should be here any minute.
OTHERMALE:Alex, uh, look, are-are you sure you don't want us to drive you to the airport? Oh, no, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:This is on, uh, O'Brien, Mathers & Clark's expense account.
LEADMALE:Come to think of it, I may even tip the driver this time.
LEADFEMALE: - Morning, Andy.
LEADFEMALE:You want some breakfast? Coffee, black, two sugars, and step on it.
LEADMALE:This is ridiculous.
LEADMALE:I mean, farmers don't even get up this early.
LEADMALE:Come on, everybody, let's have a little spirit.
SUPFEMALE:Alex is leaving.
SUPMALE:Let's just give him a big, energetic Keaton send-off, okay? Well, looks like we're the only ones with any stamina around here, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:These namby-pambies have nothing on us.
SUPMALE:Nah, you tired? No, I'm fine, Jennifer.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:So you're leaving today, huh? That's right, Mal.
LEADMALE:This is our last morning in this kitchen together as housemates.
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Next time we see each other, a new phase of our lives will have begun.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be able to buy and sell you.
LEADFEMALE:Drop me a line.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, there's my cab.
SUPFEMALE: Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, so, uh I guess this is it, huh? The big send-off.
LEADMALE:Uh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, uh, I-I don't need any big send-off.
SUPFEMALE:I-I really couldn't take a big, emotional scene right now, so, um, why don't we just take our leave in a manner befitting uh, the youngest  executive at O'Brien, Mathers & Clark.
SUPFEMALE:Dad.
SUPMALE:Well, in that spirit, good-bye, son.
OTHERMALE:Good-bye, Dad.
LEADMALE:Remember, you still owe me $74.
LEADFEMALE:50.
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:It's been fun.
LEADMALE:A million laughs.
OTHERFEMALE:Pleasure working with you.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:See ya, pal.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, send me the picture of the first guy you step on as you climb up the corporate ladder.
LEADMALE:You got it.
SUPMALE:Uh, just tell her I've gone, and you don't know where I am.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, the I wanted to give you something.
SUPMALE: Be surprised what a little splash of color will do.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, whoever called for the cab, the meter's running.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, yeah, that's me.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I like the red.
SUPMALE:It makes you look like somebody.
