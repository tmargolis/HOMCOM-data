LEADMALE:Well, maybe, uh Maybe I'll be off to work now.
SUPMALE:I-I-if it's okay with the two of you Go.
LEADMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:Elyse, I'm furious with you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're mad at me? I'm not the one who stayed out all night.
LEADMALE:Why are you having a harder time accepting this divorce than I am? It's not right! It's unnatural! There are some things in this world that you can count on.
LEADMALE:The sun comes up in the morning, it's hard to whistle with crackers in your mouth, and my mom and dad do not get divorced! Elyse, you're going to have to get used to it.
LEADFEMALE:You had a great marriage.
LEADMALE:We had a great family.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody said so.
LEADFEMALE:Was it all a lie? Look, we did have a good marriage.

LEADFEMALE:It happens.
LEADMALE:But it doesn't erase the wonderful years we had together.
OTHERFEMALE:I want my family back.

LEADFEMALE:It's so scary.
LEADFEMALE:If if you and dad can break up, that can happen to anybody.
LEADFEMALE:It could happen to me.

SUPMALE:There are a lot of things about your father that I miss.
LEADMALE:Like what? Oh, little things.
SUPFEMALE:Like the way he used to wake me up in the morning.
SUPMALE:How? He used to lean over and yell, "swimmers, take your marks!" And then he'd shoot off a little toy cap pistol.
LEADFEMALE:You miss that? I never overslept.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Elyse I've always belonged to someone else.
OTHERMALE:Charlie Donnelly's wife.
LEADMALE:Elyse's mother.
LEADFEMALE:Ned's mother.
LEADFEMALE:Never just me, Kate.
