SUPFEMALE:Glad you could make it down for the final 30 seconds of dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry, mom.
SUPFEMALE:I was in the middle of studying.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if I was to break concentration at that point, it would've been a fatal error.
LEADFEMALE:This week, every minute, every second is precious.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be so melodramatic, Alex.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal about studying for midterms? Why don't you try it sometime and find out, Mallory? Alex, Mallory's been making great strides this year in her schoolwork.
OTHERMALE:Didn't you say you thought you'd get a 'b' in biology this term? I did say that.
SUPMALE:I did think that.
LEADMALE:I was wrong.
SUPMALE:Anyway, it's not the same, dad.
LEADFEMALE:See, I'm a senior.
LEADMALE:These are the last grades I'll get that will count towards college.
SUPMALE:Oh, and on top of that, the state scholarship exam is on Saturday.

LEADMALE:Oh, Steven, your special's about to start.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Come on, kids, you'll love it.

LEADMALE:I-I-I've got more work to do this week than Than even I can manage.
LEADMALE:So I need your help.

OTHERFEMALE:Alex, effie has a prescription for those pills.
SUPMALE:It's illegal for anyone else to take them.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mallory.
OTHERMALE:You took one yourself, a couple of months ago, when you were on that diet.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:And it was you that talked me out of taking any more.
LEADFEMALE:You said they were dangerous and that drugs weren't the solution to anything.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Throw that up in my face.
SUPMALE:Look, Mallory, you know me well enough to know I am not gonna abuse the pills.
SUPFEMALE:I probably won't even use 'em.
LEADFEMALE:They will sit on my shelf, and I won't touch 'em.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'll talk to effie tomorrow.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Not tomorrow, tonight.

LEADMALE:Will you keep your voice down? We are dealing with illegal contraband here, Mallory.
SUPMALE:What took you so long? Effie didn't want to give up the pills.
LEADMALE:She said she needs them for her diet.
OTHERMALE:How'd you talk her into it? She likes you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:So, uh, I told her you'd go out with her.
LEADFEMALE:You what?! I don't want to go out with effie.
LEADMALE:She weighs 300 pounds.

LEADFEMALE:'Course, she would do all the heavy work.
LEADFEMALE:On the other hand, what choice have I got? Help me out here.
LEADMALE:I mean, what would you do? Pressure mounting from all sides, y-your entire future, your career hangs in the balance.
OTHERMALE:Would you do something you knew was wrong? 
LEADMALE:Hey, Alex, you want to take a break and join us? 
LEADMALE:I'm really busy, mom.
LEADFEMALE:We're playing monopoly! Then you'll join us? Monopoly? You kidding me? I'd love a game.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I-i thought you had a lot of work to do? Well, dad, I was thinking.
LEADMALE:You know, term papers and exams come and go, but the family unit is the one true constant in life.
LEADMALE:The precious hours spent in the familiar abode, with loved ones, playing a heartwarming game such as this, are what make memories that one can treasure for all eternity.
LEADMALE:When did all that occur to you? As I was coming down the stairs.
LEADFEMALE:Are these dice in proper working order? Yes, all the dots seem to be in place.
