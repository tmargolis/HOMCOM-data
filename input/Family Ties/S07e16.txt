LEADFEMALE:Mom, quick, hide me.
SUPFEMALE:Are you all right? No, Mom, I'm scared.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, Alex? Did you see a rerun of The Wizard of Oz? Are the flying monkeys after you, Alex? Ooh, the flying monkeys are after Alex.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
OTHERMALE:Come on, come on, Mal.
LEADMALE:Knock it off.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:Ooh, the flying monkeys, Dad.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Elyse! Honey, stop scaring your father.
LEADFEMALE:He'll be up all night.
LEADMALE:Ooh, the flying monkeys, my pretty.
LEADMALE:Ah, leave him alone.
LEADFEMALE:He's starting to cry.
LEADMALE:Alex, if this is scarier than the flying monkeys, I don't want to hear about it.
LEADFEMALE:It's the paper girl.
SUPFEMALE:She sees me walking down the street.
LEADFEMALE:She pedals her bike towards me, fast as she can.
LEADFEMALE:When she gets real close, she throws the paper right at my head.
LEADMALE:Thank God she doesn't deliver pianos.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Alex, it just means she likes you.
SUPMALE:When I was little, that's how I showed if I liked a boy.
SUPFEMALE:If-if I thought he was cute, I'd just punch him in the arm, and if I wanted him to go out with me, I'd pull his hair like that, but if I wanted to go steady with him, I'd I'd knock him unconscious.
LEADFEMALE:I married her, and I'm thankful to be alive to talk about it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, God, that's her.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:This is like the Little Archies version of Fatal Attraction.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Alex, if you don't want her, I'll take her.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Marla! What can I do for you? Um, you owe me two bucks for the paper and I'm in love with your son.
LEADMALE:Don't hurt him, Marla! Well, not till we get there.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mal.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Jen, this is the happiest day of my life.
SUPFEMALE:Being picked to be your social studies partner is a natural high unlike any other, my little Ohio Buckeye beauty.
OTHERFEMALE:Simon, listen, I like you, and it's gonna be fun to be your project partner, but you have to stop calling me those names.
LEADMALE:What names are those, my flaxen-haired dove? Hi, Simon.
LEADMALE:Hello, lovely lady.
LEADMALE:Your radiance glows like moonbeams.
OTHERFEMALE:Why are you talking like Omar Sharif? Life is too short not to.
OTHERMALE:Tell your sister the wonderful news.
LEADFEMALE:Simon and I were paired together for a project at school.
LEADFEMALE:Paired together by fate, by the gods.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what's the project? We're supposed to do a paper on entering the workforce, so Simon and I got after-school jobs.
LEADMALE:Jennifer, that's great.
LEADMALE:Oh, for the first time in your life, you'll be earning your own money.
LEADMALE:You'll be able to go where you want to, buy whatever clothes you want to.
LEADMALE:I mean, you won't have to rely on Mom and Dad's measly little allowance.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mom and Dad.
SUPMALE:The k ah, the kettle's ready.
SUPMALE:Kettle's in here.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:The sofa the sofa's ready.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
SUPFEMALE:Um, what's this about getting a job? Oh, it's for school.
SUPFEMALE:Simon and I are gonna be working at a fast food restaurant.
LEADMALE:Chicken Heaven.
LEADFEMALE:Heaven for chickens and heaven for me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna be working side by side with the alluring Jennifer Keaton.
LEADMALE:Not to mention those alluring chickens.
LEADFEMALE:Have you noticed how popular our children are these days? Alex, I is your woman now! Hi, Mr.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Marla.
SUPFEMALE:You're wearing a skirt.
SUPMALE:You're also wearing pants.
OTHERMALE:Is Alex here? - Uh - Oh, hi, Marla.
SUPFEMALE:You look pretty today.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton.
LEADFEMALE:Even wearing a little blush on your cheeks? Oh, it's not blush.
LEADFEMALE:It's newsprint from the Sunday supplement.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, very becoming.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Oh, Alex, Alex, be nice to her.
OTHERMALE:I've never seen a girl so much in love.
SUPMALE:So, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Keaton, you gave birth to Alex, huh? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Well, someone had to.
LEADFEMALE:Must have been the most exciting day of your life.
LEADMALE:How was it for you, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Keaton? Well, Marla, I didn't give birth to Alex.
SUPMALE:I wanted to, but, uh, I lost the coin toss.
LEADFEMALE:You're pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Scram, kid, I don't go for tots.
LEADMALE:Not as pretty as I thought.
LEADFEMALE:I got a present for you, Alex.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Marla, you-you don't have to give me presents.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I do.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanted to give you something personal.
SUPMALE:I got you this because I couldn't find the jar that my tonsils were in.
LEADFEMALE:Well-well that's a shame.
SUPMALE:I saved up my pennies, my nickels, and my dimes, and I bought you a $20 bill.
LEADMALE:I hope you like it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Alex, she sure knows the way to your heart.
SUPMALE:It is a beauty.
SUPMALE:Hate to have to give it back.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she should learn a lesson from this.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Jen, what's the price of a heavenly chicken combo deluxe? $4.
SUPMALE:95 plus tax.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, you're amazing.
LEADFEMALE:You've got the mind of a chicken.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Simon.
LEADMALE:You've got the body of a chicken.
OTHERMALE:Mallory, mystical woman of the Midwest, would test us on giblets? Okay, how many giblets in a quart? You know, Jen, I'm-I'm really proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:This sounds like a wonderful place to work.
LEADMALE:Well, Dad, it's not exactly the most prestigious place in the world.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about, Jennifer? Chicken Heaven is a completely highbrow establishment.
LEADMALE:Simon, highbrow establishments don't usually have a drive-through lane where your customers scream their orders directly into a chicken beak.
LEADMALE:And then what happens? The chicken tells the cook? Uh And 12 cents is your change.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Jennifer you're beautiful when you're making change.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, will you stop it and get to work? Excuse me, sir.
OTHERMALE:Sir? - Simon, I think he wants you.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Look, you completely screwed up our order, and we had to wait 20 minutes while you made it in the first place.
LEADMALE:I am sorry; I'll fix that right up for you.
OTHERMALE:Great, and what are we supposed to do in the meantime? Would you care for a lozenge? I'd like to see the manager.
OTHERMALE:Uh, here she is.
LEADFEMALE:She's the manager? Oh, she's more than just the manager.
LEADMALE:She's the woman I love.
SUPFEMALE:Simon, stop it.
LEADMALE:Go put some fries on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, sir, I'll take care of it.
LEADMALE:You better.
LEADMALE:Hey! That's no way to talk to her.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like to step outside? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you? No, I just thought you would.
OTHERMALE:Simon, you really got to get it together.
SUPFEMALE:You're really screwing up here.
LEADMALE:Now go put some more fries on.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, sir, here you go.
LEADMALE:I really don't know why I keep coming back here.
LEADMALE:The service is bad, the atmosphere is worse, and the food is inedible.
LEADFEMALE:How about a coupon for a free meal? Hey, thank you very much.
LEADMALE:See you tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Did you put the fries on? Mission accomplished, my poultry goddess.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Welcome to Chicken Heaven, where you get more cluck for your buck.
LEADMALE:Give me three heavenly drumsticks Ordering three heavenly drumsticks.
LEADFEMALE:French fries Ordering French fries.
LEADFEMALE:coleslaw Ordering coleslaw.
LEADFEMALE:The kitchen's on fire.
LEADMALE:Ordering the kitchen's on fire.
OTHERMALE:Is that one of our specials? No! The kitchen's on fire, you idiot! Make that ordering the kitchen's on fire, you idiot.
LEADMALE:Would you like a drink with that? Simon, the kitchen's on fire! That's a really popular dish.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the fries! Simon! Quick.
LEADMALE:Simon, Jennifer, who's responsible for this? Can we ever say, in the philosophical sense, that anyone is responsible for anything? Yeah, watch me.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Parker, we were really jammed up with customers, and I-I think it's possible that the fries were left on a little too long.
SUPFEMALE:I will tell you what happened.
LEADMALE:This chicken-flicking nitwit screwed up my order and ignored my repeated warnings that the fire was starting.
OTHERFEMALE:Will there be anything else for you today, madam? This young lady saved the day.
LEADMALE:You should be proud of having her as an employee.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
LEADFEMALE:And you should be ashamed of having him.
OTHERMALE:I am.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, you're on probation here.
SUPMALE:Thank you, sir, I'm honored.
SUPMALE:Jennifer, you're real Chicken Heaven material.
LEADMALE:I think you have what it takes to rise to the top of the coop.
SUPFEMALE:No one's ever said that to me before.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like to be assistant manager? Yeah.
SUPMALE:So, when did you first realize that Alex was the most wonderful human being in the whole world? When you told us.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, and before that, uh, when he told us.
SUPMALE:Let's move on.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, what's his favorite chair? Well, probably the one you're sitting in.
OTHERMALE:Mar Marla! Give it back! Let's not tell her where his bed is.
LEADFEMALE:Mom? Can you tell Alex to stop leaving his plates all over the house? I found this outside his door, like room service.
LEADMALE:She gone? Alex, you have to do something.
LEADFEMALE:You have to talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, not yet, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:I think she's about to give me some more money.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what's with the paper girl? She's standing on the corner, staring at a fork.
LEADFEMALE:She's in love with your brother.
LEADMALE:No, seriously.
LEADFEMALE:My sister, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADFEMALE:How was work, honey? - God, Mom, it was worse than ever.
LEADMALE:I mean, since they made me assistant manager, Simon has become even more of a problem.
LEADMALE:We took the job together, but now I'm his boss.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do.
LEADFEMALE:He's completely incompetent.
LEADMALE:If it were anyone else, I think I'd fire him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, so what's the problem? Alex, he's my friend.
LEADFEMALE:So what's the problem? I don't know what I'm gonna do.
SUPMALE:Maybe I should just quit, and get a job at Jiffy Burger.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:I've seen their hats.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Hi, Simon.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, this isn't the army.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to wear your uniform off duty.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I know.
LEADFEMALE:But I like it.
LEADMALE:So I've incorporated it into my wardrobe.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes I wear just the hat and ski boots.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry we had to hear that.
LEADMALE:Simon, we have to talk.
LEADFEMALE:Yes? Simon, we were paired together to do a job, and I don't feel that you're living up to your end of the bargain.
SUPMALE:What do you mean, pretty lady? Simon I've got a job to do, and I take that kind of responsibility seriously.
SUPFEMALE:Now, stop concentrating on me, and start concentrating on your job.
OTHERFEMALE:What job is that? Why am I both drawn to you and repelled by you? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:My mother asked the same thing.
LEADMALE:Sorry I'm late, but I'm ready to go.
SUPMALE:Whoa! - Simon Simon, when you're late, I get in trouble with Mr.
LEADMALE:Parker.
SUPMALE:Now stop fooling around and get to work.
LEADMALE:I love it when you're bossy.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, I don't want to hear it.
LEADFEMALE:Get to your post.
SUPFEMALE:You again, Simon? - No, sir, it was me.
LEADFEMALE:I accidentally bumped into Simon, and he knocked the cups over, and then I asked him to clean them up for me.
LEADMALE:And I'm happy to do that for her, sir, because I'm her knight in shining armor.
SUPMALE:Okay, I never had armor, but I had braces for a while.
LEADMALE:You should've had a muzzle.
SUPMALE:All right, get back to work, both of you.
LEADMALE:I like that idea.
LEADMALE:Jen, I really appreciate you-you covering for me.
LEADMALE:I don't know how to thank you.
LEADMALE:Maybe I do! Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Where you from? Simon Thank you.
LEADMALE:The next show is at 3:15.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:What are you guys doing here? Uh, just came by to get a little free food.
SUPFEMALE:Alex, I can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:We're out of here, then.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me, miss? Miss, hey you! Miss! Hey, you mister.
LEADFEMALE:That's no "miss," that's my sister.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:She's my sister, too.
OTHERMALE:And you better listen to him, he's my brother.
OTHERMALE:Want to meet my parents? We're them.
LEADMALE:And she's right.
LEADFEMALE:You have a problem with her, you go through us.
LEADMALE:You see, if one of us gets a job, we all get the job.
LEADFEMALE:You got that? I just wanted some ketchup.
LEADFEMALE:Jen? It's over there.
LEADFEMALE:It's over there.
LEADMALE:Nice meeting you.
LEADMALE:So how's it going, Jen? See for yourself.
SUPFEMALE:In the true sense of the word, he is a soda jerk.
SUPMALE:Honey, you've got to do something about Simon.
OTHERMALE:Oh, just ignore him.
LEADFEMALE:It happens every two or three hours.
SUPMALE:What do you guys want? Uh, well, Jen, uh what do you recommend? Eating somewhere else.
LEADMALE:Look, why don't we try four of the Wing-a-ling Delights? No, no, no, I don't want a Wing-a-ling Delight.
LEADMALE:I want a Gizzard Blizzard.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I'll have the Tub O'Necks.
SUPFEMALE:Ordering three Wing-a-lings, one Gizzard Blizzard, and one Tub O'Necks.
LEADMALE:You know what I'd really like? A mesquite-grilled, free-range, boneless breast of chicken on a bed of radicchio with a mustard vinaigrette.
SUPMALE:Ordering one Heavenly Slop Pile.
SUPMALE:Simon! - Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa Hey! Whoa! That's enough! I've got it under control! Well obviously, I'm not needed here.
LEADMALE:Jen, uh why don't you, uh, lock up when you leave, all right? Mr.
OTHERMALE:Parker, can I fire him? Uh, no.
SUPMALE:But I can.
LEADMALE:Simon! You're fired! Where's my Tub O'Necks? You have a milk mustache.
OTHERFEMALE:I like that in a man.
SUPFEMALE:Marla Marla I'm very flattered that you have a crush on me.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, are you gonna tell me it's not gonna work between us? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, fine, if that's the way you feel about it.
SUPFEMALE:I can handle this very maturely.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? Shh Marla, look I already have a girlfriend.
LEADMALE:And-and I go to graduate school.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I'm twice your age.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you want to go for the honeymoon? I like the Poconos.
LEADMALE:Marla, it's not gonna work, okay? I mean, it's-it's-it's it's completely nuts.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, i-it's impossible.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe I'm wearing a stupid bow in my hair.
SUPFEMALE:The bow is beautiful.
LEADMALE:It is not! I look like Rose Marie! That's not true.
LEADMALE:Alex you've broken my heart.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I don't want to do that.
OTHERMALE:In a very little while, you're gonna forget all about me.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, I want my 20 bucks back.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no reason to break this off entirely.
SUPFEMALE:A gift is a gift.
LEADMALE:Come on, cough it up.
LEADMALE:Look, Marla any guy your age would be crazy not to fall for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out of here.
LEADMALE:I mean it, I mean it, you know, who knows? Maybe ten or 20 years, you're breaking hearts left and right Maybe, uh maybe our paths will cross again.
SUPMALE:Bye, Marla.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:I'll never wash my forehead again.
LEADMALE:Not that I ever did much before.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Oh! How'd it go with Marla? Kind of rough.
LEADMALE:It's okay; she's young.
LEADMALE:She'll get over it.
SUPMALE:I'm talking about me.
LEADMALE:I had to give the 20 bucks back.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Is Jennifer here? I'll get her.
LEADMALE:Ooh Well, the secret's out.
OTHERMALE:I'm a real goofball.
LEADMALE:I'll be honest with you, Simon.
SUPMALE:That hat's not working for you.
LEADMALE:Hi, Jen.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry about how things went today.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here to turn in my uniform.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna miss this.
LEADMALE:Got a lot of compliments on it from my therapist.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Jen.
LEADMALE:I I guess I just got carried away.
LEADFEMALE:See, when I'm around you, I can't even function.
LEADFEMALE:Simon, you've got to grow up.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, don't you realize what happened back there? You could have gotten me fired.
OTHERFEMALE:You weren't even trying to do a good job.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true, Jen.
LEADFEMALE:I wanted to do a good job.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry I embarrassed you, I guess I do have to be a little more responsible.
SUPFEMALE:I just wanted to impress you, so that you'd like me.
LEADMALE:Simon, I do like you If you say "as a friend," I'm gonna spontaneously combust.
SUPMALE:Well, then, I guess I'd better take a few steps back.
LEADMALE:As a friend, huh? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I hope you can deal with that, Simon.
LEADMALE:Actually, it's like driving a stake through my heart.
LEADMALE:But I can live with that.
LEADMALE:Tell me something, Jen would you really have fired me from Chicken Heaven? Absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:Would you ever fire me as your friend? Never.
LEADFEMALE:
