LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, what's going on? Shh.
LEADMALE:Shh.
SUPFEMALE:A fight? A fight, and you didn't call me? It just started, but it has real potential.

SUPFEMALE:It would make my life a lot easier.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, Elyse.
LEADFEMALE:Richard and Keith are here.
LEADMALE:Do you think we could stop this silly fight? I know I could.
LEADFEMALE:Oh oh, I see.
SUPMALE:It's my fault.

OTHERFEMALE:Even if you're in a deep, deep sleep? Oh, and there's the bell to end the first round.
LEADMALE:Coming.
SUPFEMALE:Try to keep some sense of decorum, would you, Elyse? The man's been through a horrible divorce and custody battle.

LEADFEMALE:So, Keith, where has this dad of yours taken you today? Well, we started at the football hall of fame.
SUPFEMALE:Then we went to the pony rides Uh, don't tell him any more, Keith.

OTHERMALE:Tomorrow, the wine country.
LEADMALE:Mm-hmm.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Alex, you want to go fly the kite? Yeah, thanks anyway, Keith, but I think I'm a little old for kites.
