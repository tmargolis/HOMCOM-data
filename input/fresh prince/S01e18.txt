SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you, Ashley, it's the perfect thing for Granny's visit.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we enter here, we go past the llamas and giraffes take a look at the monkey house and then end with a ride on the Ferris wheel.
LEADFEMALE:For the last time we are not breaking into Michael Jackson's house.
SUPMALE:Man, what's up? We're picking up Grandma from the airport.
LEADFEMALE:She won't want to hear that garbage when she gets here.
LEADFEMALE:The reason you don't like the music is because you can't dance.
LEADFEMALE:Really? In your face.
LEADMALE:So it turned out I did get an "A" in my English mid-term and the A minus was in Math.
OTHERMALE:What a crazy week that was.
OTHERFEMALE:That takes us up to the spring quarter.
OTHERMALE:That's when l Worked hard, got good grades, made the honor roll, the end.
LEADMALE:Granny! Oh, sugar! Will, as handsome as ever.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, as generous as ever.
SUPFEMALE:Did you notice how Carlton's grown? He's almost into adult sizes.
OTHERFEMALE:Congratulations, dear.
SUPMALE:I've been looking through the guidebooks I found an attraction with your name written all over it.
LEADFEMALE:What's that, honey?
LEADFEMALE:Raging Waters.
LEADMALE:Are you insane?
LEADMALE:It's a little late to be asking.
LEADMALE:She's here to rest and recuperate.
LEADMALE:She's just gotten over the flu.
LEADMALE:I told you it was a cold.
LEADMALE:What did the doctor say? Us country folks don't run to the doctor at every sneeze, sniffle, or broken bone.
LEADMALE:We are not the spendthrifts you are, Zeke.
LEADFEMALE:Zeke.
LEADFEMALE:That one always kills me.
SUPFEMALE:Granny, I love when you come to visit.
LEADFEMALE:Did you bring the picture of him and the goat? Never leave home without it.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, sir, I'll be getting a frame for this one.
SUPMALE:Hattie.
SUPFEMALE:Hello! Honey, you are younger and prettier every time I see you.
OTHERFEMALE:Will you look at you two?
LEADMALE:You could enter a beauty contest.
LEADMALE:Grandma.
OTHERMALE:Really? I never gave it much thought.
LEADFEMALE:Just think, for the talent portion, you could twirl a checkbook.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, are we gonna do some more crafts while you're here? We sure are.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey! Yes, madam? Ashley and I are going to be doing some art.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to need 50 Popsicle sticks two bags of macaroni wheels, and lots and lots of glitter.
LEADFEMALE:I'm way ahead of you.
LEADMALE:In anticipation of your visit I have saved two dozen egg cartons.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey, but we won't be making purses this time.
LEADMALE:Speaking of art, I thought we could go to the museum.
LEADMALE:They have a display on 100-year-old quilts.
LEADFEMALE:I got one of them in the back of my truck.
SUPFEMALE:I know what'd be perfect for 
SUPFEMALE:A complete day of beauty where the salon does your hair, makeup, nails, and you come out looking fabulous.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think your grandmother would be interested.
OTHERFEMALE:Then can I do it? I know we all have plans for Grandma, but let her relax a little bit first.
OTHERFEMALE:Sweetie, I feel fine.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe so, Mama, but while you're here I want you to take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:You are not to lift a finger.
LEADMALE:We're gonna treat you like a queen.
LEADFEMALE:You said the magic words.
OTHERFEMALE:Granny, what you doing? Nothing much, I'm afraid.
SUPMALE:Your uncle gave me this book of find-the-word puzzles.
LEADFEMALE:So I found all the words.
SUPMALE:Now what do I do with them? You shouldn't just be sitting here.
LEADFEMALE:You should do something you like doing, like I don't know baking me a sweet potato pie.
SUPMALE:Baby, much as I'd like to, I think your uncle wants me to stay put.
LEADMALE:Now that's your first mistake.
LEADMALE:He tells me all kinds of stuff to do and I never listen to him.
LEADMALE:And I'm a better person for it.
OTHERMALE:How come you're just sitting around? Don't you have any plans? No, not really.
LEADFEMALE:You got to have a girl.
OTHERFEMALE:No kidding.
LEADMALE:There's no one that gets your sap rising? There's this girl named Tanya, I met her at the mall.
SUPFEMALE:She works in a fancy men's store where even the underwear comes from Europe.
SUPMALE:I don't know if she'd go out with anybody in local drawers.
LEADFEMALE:Sets to mind a heifer we once had.
LEADFEMALE:You ain't seen Tanya.
LEADMALE:You listen up.
LEADFEMALE:Petunia had two bulls liking her.
SUPMALE:One a big strong Angus with a chest as wide as a Chevy.
LEADFEMALE:That one's me, right? The other was a slim, handsome Jersey.
OTHERMALE:A real lady's bull.
LEADMALE:Word to Granny.
LEADFEMALE:That one's me, right? All season long, Petunia just couldn't decide.
SUPFEMALE:So come fall, she ups and picks the Angus.
OTHERFEMALE:See? No.
LEADMALE:By then, breeding season was over.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if you changed it to cats or something.
SUPMALE:Everybody be quiet.
LEADMALE:Grandma's probably sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:She's going to love my gift.
SUPMALE:I didn't know Leonard Nimoy even sang.
LEADFEMALE:That was very thoughtful, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I smell something funny.
OTHERFEMALE:It smells like pine or something.
SUPMALE:I smell it, too.
SUPFEMALE:I thinks it's coming from the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:What is that smell? Watch your step.
SUPMALE:The floor is wet.
LEADMALE:Mother, what are you doing? I'm picking apples from a cherry tree.
LEADFEMALE:What does it look like I'm doing? I'm giving your floor a good hand scrubbing.
OTHERFEMALE:That's Geoffrey's job.
LEADMALE:No, it ain't.
LEADMALE:I have begun the mulch pile, madam.
LEADMALE:Fine Geoffrey, I'll be out to look at it directly, right after I flip the mattresses.
LEADMALE:Hold on, Mama.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey Sorry, sir, but she threatened me with a whupping.
SUPFEMALE:It seems like you're back to your old self.
SUPFEMALE:I have an idea for this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:I know how proud you are of your azaleas.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we go to the botanical gardens and see how theirs stack up?
LEADFEMALE:I'll get my sweater.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Mama, you cold? Geoffrey, turn up the heat.
LEADMALE:Sir, I already set the thermostat on 80 as you requested.
LEADFEMALE:The candles are starting to melt.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanted my sweater because we are going to the gardens.
SUPMALE:We can go to the garden later this week.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to get settled in.
LEADMALE:I am more settled than a big old box of raisin bran.
SUPMALE:Mama, don't excite yourself.
LEADMALE:Is there anything I can get for you?
LEADFEMALE:How about a magazine?
OTHERFEMALE:Or a game.
SUPMALE:Or some moisturizer.
LEADMALE:I have an idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't we all take a dip in the pool? Sounds good.
OTHERMALE:That way we can all get out and let Mama take a nap.
LEADMALE:I want to swim, too.
SUPFEMALE:You shouldn't swim when getting over the flu.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see you after your nap.
OTHERMALE:Nap! Why don't they put me in a playpen? Yo, DJ Granny.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on?
SUPMALE:Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:And your uncle aims to keep it that way.
SUPMALE:I know he means well but a body has to feel useful.
SUPFEMALE:Useful? You know that girlie advice you gave me? It worked like a charm.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I don't remember it exactly but I just walked up to her and 
LEADFEMALE:"Hey Tanya, bulls and cows need to get together before it starts snowing.
SUPMALE:" And she understood that? No, but she liked my hair.
LEADFEMALE:We're going out on her first night off.
SUPFEMALE:That's fine.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't have a date for the concert tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Who's playing?
LEADMALE:Heavy D.
LEADFEMALE:I love him.
LEADMALE:You do? Who doesn't like Charlie Daniels? This is another Heavy D, Granny.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if I play this tape for you.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.
SUPMALE:Not bad.
SUPFEMALE:Can't understand what he's saying but it does have a beat to it.
SUPMALE:What kind of dance you do to this? Trust me on this one.
LEADMALE:It's very complicated.
SUPFEMALE:It takes a lot of hard study and dedication to learn.
LEADMALE:Honey, I ain't got that kind of time.
LEADFEMALE:You're getting there, you're getting there! This kind of dancing works up quite an appetite.
SUPMALE:What say I make us some flapjacks? Granny, will you marry me? Sweet talker! This is the good part.
LEADMALE:I'll turn up the Victrola.
LEADMALE:Yeah! Go, granny! Go, granny! What's going on in here? Mama, are you all right? Of course I am.
SUPMALE:Take your hands off of me.
LEADMALE:Will, why were you playing that music? Grandma's supposed to be resting.
SUPMALE:You're grounded.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get so worked up.
LEADMALE:I was just having fun.
LEADFEMALE:Mama, a woman your age should not be dancing around.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, don't you tell me what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was just trying to look out for you.
SUPMALE:Will, no more horsing around.
LEADMALE:"Will, no more horsing around.
OTHERMALE:" That boy is about as much fun as day-old oatmeal.
LEADMALE:I noticed that.
LEADFEMALE:Granny, since we're both grounded want to go upstairs, slam our bedroom doors, and throw things? A woman my age shouldn't be dancing.
LEADMALE:We'll see about that.
LEADFEMALE:Spoiling my fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Yours? I can't believe I'm not going to that concert.
LEADFEMALE:You are going to that concert.
LEADFEMALE:I am?
SUPMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:With me.
SUPMALE:But Uncle Phil won't let us.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil won't see us.
OTHERFEMALE:Sneaking out? You? Honey, you are looking at a woman who has snuck out to more barn dances hayrides, and midnight skinny-dips than a chicken has pecks.
SUPMALE:Yo well Hiiii haaaaa! Looks like you've got plans for the evening.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Got me a couple of extra pillows.
LEADMALE:I like to turn in early at my age.
LEADMALE:Would you like some hot chocolate?
LEADMALE:Lord, no! Don't need the stimulation.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, honey.
SUPFEMALE:That was close.
SUPFEMALE:But I was cool.
LEADMALE:Good work 0070.
SUPFEMALE:Now here's the plan.
SUPFEMALE:The concert starts at 8:00.
LEADFEMALE:My friend Jazz will meet us at the corner at 7:00.
SUPFEMALE:He'll flash his lights twice, then drive us to the Bel-Air border.
LEADFEMALE:There, we'll meet with a guy known only as the Captain.
OTHERMALE:He'll drive us the rest of the way.
SUPMALE:No questions asked.
LEADFEMALE:What's the code words? Here's $10.
LEADFEMALE:Got you.
SUPMALE:You're going to be ready to go? No problem.
LEADMALE:Good, you'll blend in.
LEADFEMALE:I brought these pillows to put them in our beds so they think we're sleeping.
SUPFEMALE:Granny, granny, granny Nice try, but today it's all done electronically.
LEADMALE:Check it.
LEADFEMALE:That's lovely dear What do you mean your grandmother wasn't in her room?? Well, i went to tell her goodnight, but there were just clothes underneath her covers.
OTHERMALE:Where on earth would she get an idea like that? Will! How could he still be sleeping? Look at this.
SUPMALE:I can't believe how low Will will stoop to deceive you.
LEADFEMALE:With this tape, who knows how many times he could sneak out of the house for a whole night completely unnoticed.
SUPMALE:You think Will and Grandma are all right?
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure they are.
OTHERMALE:Okay, I'm going to bed.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADMALE:Where would they be at this hour? The Heavy D concert.
LEADFEMALE:I accidentally overheard Will on the phone when I was trying to clean my receiver.
SUPFEMALE:Will probably dragged my mother with him.
LEADMALE:I'm going down there.
LEADMALE:I'm going with you.
LEADFEMALE:It's a rap concert.
LEADMALE:You want to be with someone who knows how to be hip.
LEADMALE:$10 for a T-shirt.
LEADMALE:That boy must be crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:I still ain't sure how you managed to get it for $1.
LEADMALE:25 and a picture of Grandpa.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should call home.
LEADFEMALE:I know how it is.
SUPMALE:I've been a parent.
LEADMALE:I've been a kid, and the answer is bad choice, Joyce.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry to bother you.
OTHERMALE:Miss Fitzgerald? I'm a big fan of yours.
LEADFEMALE:I was wondering if i can I have your picture taken with me? Come on, she's not Ever too busy for a fan.
SUPMALE:They had backstage passes.
LEADMALE:It shouldn't be too hard to find them.
LEADMALE:Let's hurry up.
SUPFEMALE:This is weird.
LEADMALE:Can you believe how these kids dress? It's beginning to get to me.
LEADMALE:Excuse me a moment.
LEADFEMALE:I just Could I see your backstage pass, please? I don't have one.
SUPFEMALE:I'm here looking for my mother.
SUPFEMALE:And your sister knows a member of the band, right? You groupies are all alike.
LEADMALE:I am not a groupie.
OTHERFEMALE:Call it what you like, but take it from me, Heavy D doesn't want to hear you rap.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you think you're going? Pardon me.
SUPFEMALE:Have you seen a kid in wild, colorful clothing with an earring in his ear and the sides of his head shaved? Nope.
OTHERMALE:You better get to your seat, the concert's about to start.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not here to see some stupid concert.
LEADMALE:Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'll find him myself.
LEADMALE:He couldn't have gotten too far.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, put your hands together for Heavy D! Boo! When the crowd saw he wasn't Heavy D, they was upset.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil, you had the shortest rap career in history.
OTHERMALE:But I do feel bad.
OTHERFEMALE:All the trouble we caused you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're right.
OTHERMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well! You all should've seen Granny.
SUPMALE:She was great.
LEADFEMALE:She climbed down from the second story window then she ran to Jazz's car then helped push it up the hill when it stalled.
LEADMALE:Philip, I think you're right.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think Hattie's up to seeing those azaleas tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Why, I sure am, and after that Hilary and I are going to get those facials.
OTHERMALE:Grandma, you haven't lived until you've had a mud mask.
LEADFEMALE:What people don't pay for in Beverly Hills.
LEADMALE:Good night, Grandma.
SUPMALE:Good night.
OTHERMALE:And then, Ashley, baby you and I are going to make us some macaroni rain hats.
LEADFEMALE:Great!
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, Grandma.
LEADMALE:Good night, precious.
LEADMALE:After all that activity, you're going to need a rest.
LEADFEMALE:That's when you can tell me more about your schoolwork, dear.
OTHERMALE:Excellent!
LEADMALE:Good night, Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, baby.
SUPMALE:You know, Granny, you were a great date tonight.
OTHERMALE:You showed me a great time.
LEADMALE:And to thank you tomorrow I'm going to bake you a sweet potato pie.
SUPMALE:Granny, I don't think you should be waking up all early.
SUPMALE:Let's get started on it now.
OTHERMALE:Will, I think it's time for bed.
SUPMALE:Good night, Granny.
LEADMALE:Good night, baby.
OTHERMALE:Good night, Mama.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, darling.
LEADMALE:Don't go giving me that look, Zeke.
SUPMALE:Now, you're not all that mad with me, are you? Well Mama, yes, I am.
SUPMALE:I try to set some rules down for Will and you undermined my authority.
LEADMALE:I know how to handle things.
LEADFEMALE:I am an adult.
LEADMALE:I am, too, Zeke.
OTHERMALE:I know that.
LEADMALE:Do you? How many adults do you tell to take a nap? Mama, I was just worried about you.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm fine, baby.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:When you had the flu and I talked to you on the phone you sounded so small.
LEADMALE:I just want you to live a long time.
OTHERMALE:Then, Zeke let me live.
LEADFEMALE:
