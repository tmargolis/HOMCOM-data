LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Oh, I'm trying to see how close I can get to your head without hitting it.
LEADMALE: Uh You know, you're not doing a very good job.
SUPMALE:The next time you throw one of those at me, I'm gonna make you eat it.
SUPMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, see, now see, now see, now you're in trouble.
LEADMALE:I'm in trouble?
OTHERMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Now you're in trouble.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:Whoo.
LEADFEMALE:If that's what happens for throwing a couple grapes at you Will, you know what I like about you? What? That I'm so romantic? No, that you're so goofy.
OTHERMALE:Goofy, well Oh, you mean like in a suave, debonair, Denzel-ian kind of way, right? No, not really.
SUPFEMALE:What? What do you mean? I'm, what, immature? No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I mean that you're spontaneous and you're fun and, you know, goofy.
LEADMALE:Why don't we just study? Let's just get back to studying.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Your mom goofy.
LEADMALE:Attention, everyone.
SUPMALE:Attention.
LEADFEMALE:I have an announcement.
LEADFEMALE:My horoscope said that I will prosper in my house.
LEADMALE:So I figured I better go buy one.
OTHERFEMALE:Hallelujah! Excuse me.
OTHERMALE:Hilary, that's wonderful.
LEADMALE:Nothing fancy.
LEADMALE:No more than six or seven bedrooms.
LEADMALE:And I don't even care if it has a wine cellar.
LEADFEMALE:For now.
LEADMALE:How are you going to afford a house like that? I have discovered a unique method of savings.
OTHERFEMALE:I never spend my own money.
LEADFEMALE: By the way, Daddy, don't use your platinum card this month.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Let me get this straight.
SUPMALE:All this time, you've been hoarding your salary while feasting away on the family fortune? What do you say to that, big guy? All I heard is that she's moving.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Hey, good morning, G.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Master William.
SUPMALE:Hey, what's up, y'all? Listen.
LEADFEMALE:If you had to sum me up in, you know, like, one word how would y'all describe me? 
LEADFEMALE:Freeloader.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Undependable.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:He's not a freeloader.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Lazy.
LEADMALE:Of course he's lazy.
OTHERFEMALE:He works for me.
OTHERFEMALE:He's a freeloading, lazy bum.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Believe me, he's lazy.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:I said one word.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, y'all.
LEADFEMALE:Like suave, debonair, strong.
OTHERFEMALE:What's this for, Will? Well, you know, the other night, Lisa said I was kind of, you know, goofy.
SUPMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, that's it.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADMALE:We're going to go with goofy, Will.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing, goofy?  Shut up, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Well, look, I don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe Lisa tried to give you a hint.
SUPFEMALE:She calls you goofy.
SUPMALE:Next thing you know, she's not calling you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:You think? Will, if there's one thing I know, it's about women not calling.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:What's up, baby?
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Hey, listen.
LEADMALE:I'm off in 15 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Will, I'm so excited.
SUPMALE:To hell with it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm off now then.
LEADFEMALE:You're so ridiculous.
LEADMALE:I'm excited because my friend Marvin got published in the op-ed section.
LEADFEMALE:Pfft.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, if I put my mind to it, I could write in any one of them old magazines.
LEADFEMALE:You don't need to prove to me that you're an intellectual.
LEADMALE:I like you just the way you are.
SUPMALE:What is that supposed to mean?
LEADMALE:Oh, just forget it.
SUPMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:I cannot wait to read this.
LEADMALE:The last article he wrote, ooh, it gave me goose bumps.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna climb into a hot bubble bath and get started on this right now.
LEADFEMALE:See you later.
OTHERFEMALE:A bubble bath? "Marvin, take me away.
OTHERMALE:" I'm saying, how hard could it be to write a dumb article? I could write a whole book.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of book? A good one.
LEADMALE:One that real people would wanna read.
SUPFEMALE:You know, with pictures and stuff.
SUPMALE:Oh, a coloring book.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm being serious, Carlton.
LEADMALE:How hard could it be to write good?
LEADMALE:Well.
LEADMALE:Well, what? Never mind.
OTHERMALE: 
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Carlton, thanks for coming along.
LEADMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:The sooner you make money, you're out of the house and ultimately out of my life.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, man, what do you think of this title for my book? I'm gonna call it Celebrities' Houses At Night.
LEADFEMALE:I may have misjudged you, Will.
SUPFEMALE:You really are pulling out all the stops for this girl.
LEADFEMALE:Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:Your hair's neat, your nails are trimmed.
SUPMALE:You started flossing again.
SUPMALE:Hey, man, look, I even trim my nose hair.
LEADMALE:Check it out.
LEADMALE:Nice job.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:It's just wild, man.
OTHERMALE:You know, it's like Lisa's the first thought in my mind when I wake up in the morning.
OTHERMALE:The last thought before I go to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you know, I can talk to her about anything.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's like her face has just been engraved inside my head.
LEADFEMALE:It's like, say I'm having a bad day.
OTHERMALE:No matter what it is, just terrible.
LEADFEMALE:It's like, that first second that I see her beautiful face and she puts her arms around me I touch her lips it's like, just everything is better.
LEADFEMALE:Everything.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I'm saying, Carlton?  I sure do.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a hug, big guy.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton! 
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, what is wrong with you, man?
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I just got caught up in the moment.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you get caught up in keeping your eyes on the road? All right, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Look, just take a picture of Bob Barker's house.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Look like Bob up in there getting his freak on.
LEADFEMALE:Bobby, come on down.
LEADMALE: 
OTHERMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:I even got a title.
LEADFEMALE:It's called Celebrities' Houses At Night.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this picture.
OTHERMALE:How about this one? Look at Richard Simmons in his back yard cooking them big old stank sausages.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, that one is gold.
SUPFEMALE:Look, kid, I gotta tell you, this picture doesn't really do it for me.
LEADMALE:I mean, look at it, it's too dark.
SUPMALE:Oh, see, you're not open.
LEADFEMALE:You're not open, man.
SUPMALE:I'm telling you.
LEADFEMALE:It's Celebrities' Houses At Night.
OTHERMALE:Okay, look, look.
LEADFEMALE:Kid, you got a nice idea here with the house thing.
LEADMALE:It's just not something I can get behind, all right? Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:See, because you're not letting your cerebellum rotate.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:It's not just pictures.
SUPFEMALE:I wrote little stories with them too.
OTHERMALE:Bam! You didn't notice that one.
LEADMALE:See, it's different now.
LEADFEMALE:See, because I'm not just a photographer.
LEADMALE:I'm a photographer and a writer.
SUPFEMALE:I'm ambidextrous.
LEADMALE:Nice try, huh? Maybe next time.
LEADMALE:Well, fine.
LEADMALE:Maybe I am goofy.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't forget your pictures here.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Is this one Jay Leno?
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's him.
LEADFEMALE:What is he doing here? He was pouring some coffee in the sewer or something.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, what does my story say?
OTHERMALE:I could use this in one of my publications.
SUPMALE:Really?
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, America loves Jay Leno.
LEADMALE:So, what, it'd be more like an article? Yeah, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:But I still get credit and everything, right? That and $500.
OTHERFEMALE:Here, here, here.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to read this release form.
LEADFEMALE:Sign it when you're ready.

SUPFEMALE:Published? When did you start writing? Last week.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look.
SUPMALE:I wanna give you some goose bumps too.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:Okay, so where's the article?
LEADFEMALE:Let me see it.
SUPMALE:Eh, eh, eh.

OTHERFEMALE:In due time.
LEADFEMALE:It's all a surprise, baby.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hoo.
LEADMALE: Lisa.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, there's only one word to describe you.
LEADMALE:Scum.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you know the routine.
OTHERMALE:When there's a sock in the door, you sleep on the lawn.
SUPMALE:Have you read this week's National Inquisitor? Man, I don't read that trash.
SUPFEMALE:Then how come you're writing it? Wait, wait.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:They used one of my photos from my book and put it in here.
SUPMALE:"'Jay 
LEADFEMALE:Earth Enemy Number One' by Will Smith?" You sold pictures to a sleazy magazine like this? No, no, no, baby.
LEADMALE:I did not.
LEADMALE:I sold them to a book publisher.
LEADMALE:Look, Jay Leno wasn't holding an oil can.
SUPMALE:He was holding a coffee pot.
LEADMALE:That guy tricked me.
OTHERMALE:Well, at least I got paid.
LEADFEMALE:Master William, you have a visitor.
LEADFEMALE:Will Smith?
SUPFEMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:You're served.
LEADMALE:What? What's wrong, baby? Jay Leno is suing me for $10 million.
LEADFEMALE:How do you go from trying to make a little impression on Lisa to being sued by Jay Leno for $10 million? Um I'm goofy? But wait, wait.
SUPMALE:I'm the victim here.
LEADFEMALE:That publisher took my pictures and used them for evil instead of good.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he like Hugh Hefner.
SUPMALE:And I'm an innocent young girl from the Midwest.
SUPFEMALE:And you expect me to clean up this mess.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You know the routine.
LEADMALE:I do something stupid, you clean it all up.
SUPMALE:The only difference is this time, I didn't do nothing.
SUPMALE:I think you've taken troublemaking to a whole new plateau.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:You gotta know somebody down there.
SUPFEMALE:A cameraman, a makeup girl.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you sentenced one of the guys in the band or something.
SUPFEMALE:There is a bigger issue involved here.
SUPMALE:I can't keep pulling your butt out of the fire.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:You're right, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Look And this is the last two or few times.
LEADFEMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:You know, Will, there comes a time Oh, not the "there comes a time" speech.
LEADFEMALE:I'd pay $10 million to not have to hear that again.
SUPFEMALE:I'd pay $10 million so I didn't have to say it again.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:If you don't wanna help me, just say that.
SUPMALE:I got myself into this mess, I'll get myself out.
LEADMALE:I don't need nobody.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't I watch you handle this one, I'll get the next one, all right? I can't believe that that realtor wasted my time on that dump.
OTHERMALE:That house was gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:What's the problem? Problem? Well, for starters, the layout.
OTHERMALE:Say I'm having a small garden party for 50 of my closest friends and someone spills cocktail sauce on their Armani suit.
SUPFEMALE:My maid Hildegard would have to go through the gazebo into the living room past the library and up the steps to get to the laundry room.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary, that's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:Who cares how far Hildegard has to walk? Is there anything I can do to help? Can you drive a getaway car? Master William, come quickly.
OTHERFEMALE:They're talking about you on the telly.
LEADMALE:PEOPLE 
SUPMALE:Save our sewers.
SUPMALE:Save our sewers.
SUPFEMALE:Save our sewers.
SUPMALE:This is Andrea White of KFPB.
LEADFEMALE:It has been reported to the National Inquisitor that Tonight Show host Jay Leno is a toxic polluter.
LEADFEMALE:Will Smith is the young man who photographed Leno dumping oil into the sewer systems.
OTHERMALE:His story also alleges that Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Leno may be single-handedly responsible for destroying the rain forest, the ozone layer and the one tree that grows in Brooklyn.
SUPMALE:Oh, that poor little tree.
LEADMALE:Forget that tree, Ashley.
OTHERMALE:Come on, I'm getting railroaded.
LEADMALE:Well, I finally contacted Leno's lawyer.
SUPMALE:Yeah? What'd he say?
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm sorry, but it doesn't look good.
OTHERMALE:I'm afraid you're liable.
LEADFEMALE: What is so funny? You're liable for libel.
OTHERMALE:Get it? Those are homonyms.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, your next crack is gonna be in your head.
OTHERFEMALE:Try it and I'll sue.
LEADFEMALE: Well I know what I gotta do.
SUPFEMALE:He's not gonna do anything stupid, is he? You don't know him very well, do you? It's The Tonight Show.
LEADMALE:I'm doing the Bill Clinton McDonald's bit.
SUPMALE:It's my best joke.
LEADFEMALE:You're my agent.
SUPMALE:I'm the one who should be nervous.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call you after the show, okay? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE: Hey, bro.
SUPMALE:How you doing? Have you seen Jay Leno? No, and I probably won't until I'm on stage.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, John.
LEADFEMALE:How long have you been a standup? About 10 years.
LEADFEMALE:Why?  I just hate this part of my job.
LEADMALE:What part? Dude, you've been bumped.
LEADMALE:Bumped? Listen.
LEADFEMALE:One of Roseanne's other personalities showed up.
LEADFEMALE:We have to let her keep talking.
LEADFEMALE:You gotta be kidding.
SUPMALE:My family in Milwaukee will be watching.
LEADFEMALE:I got a killer opening.
LEADFEMALE:That's show biz.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:No, wait a minute, I got this great joke about how I'm so pro-black I won't even pick the cotton out of a bottle of aspirin.
LEADMALE:I think I did you a favor, bro.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:But my family is gonna

LEADMALE:Please give a warm welcome to a very funny young man, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:John Ridley.
OTHERMALE: Hey, how you doing? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, the other day, I just had this bottle of aspirin, you know.
LEADFEMALE:But I couldn't take it because I'm black.
LEADFEMALE:What I mean is, you know, the bottle had cotton in it, you know.
LEADMALE:Get it? Cotton.
LEADMALE:I'm black.
LEADMALE:Well, well, actually, you know, what I mean is Um 
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wait a minute, wait.
OTHERMALE:This isn't John.

LEADFEMALE:You got to listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the guy you're suing, Will Smith.
LEADFEMALE:The guy that's been putting the stuff in the paper?
SUPFEMALE:That's me.
OTHERMALE:There's been a lot written about me.
SUPFEMALE:A lot of it untrue.
LEADMALE:And this seems to be the gentleman respon Come over here.
LEADFEMALE:Let's settle it right now.
LEADMALE:You got two minutes to explain yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:All right, tell us what's going on.
LEADFEMALE:Jay, listen.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to impress my girlfriend, Lisa.
SUPFEMALE:I like her a lot.
LEADMALE:I wanted to prove to her that I wasn't, you know, goofy.
SUPMALE:You, goofy? I can't imagine how she got that idea.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about?
LEADMALE:Me neither, man.
SUPMALE:I was putting together this book.
LEADFEMALE:It's called celebrities' houses at night.
SUPMALE:Good concept, right?
OTHERMALE:Terrific idea.
SUPFEMALE:You know, what happened was, you know, I just wanted to show Lisa that I was special, you know? Because I just really don't wanna lose her because I really like her.
LEADFEMALE:And, well, the pictures I gave them to the guy, he was supposed to put out my book.
LEADMALE:He put it in the national inquisitor.
SUPFEMALE:I never meant for anything bad to happen.
LEADMALE:The pictures weren't for that.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, America, I just want you to know it was not oil, it was coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Jay was pouring coffee out.
SUPMALE:It wasn't oil.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you, Smith, for clearing that up.
SUPMALE:I appreciate that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, my friends call me Will.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Smith.
LEADFEMALE:I really appreciate that.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, that's kind of romantic, I think, though.
LEADMALE:I think I mean, what you You are goofy, and you are an idiot.
SUPMALE:That's beside the point.
OTHERMALE:It's kind of a romantic thing.
LEADMALE:And maybe we should drop the suit.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think, audience?
OTHERMALE:All right, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:You're off the hook.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, Jay.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right.
