OTHERMALE:Let me take care of you.
LEADMALE:No, no, that's all fat.
SUPMALE:No, no, all sugar.

SUPMALE:Philip.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, honey, what your father's trying to say is you don't live here anymore, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:But this is all so sudden.
SUPMALE:I mean, like, if I'd only had some kind of warning or something.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, is this on? Where do you expect me to go? I don't have anything saved.
LEADMALE:Honey, we'll pay first and last month's rent.
SUPMALE:What about the months in between?

LEADMALE:You're just nervous about your first day at a new school, but don't be, come on.
LEADMALE:You're going to make a lot of new friends.

SUPMALE:Sweetheart, you're going to be all right.
SUPMALE:You have a wonderful personality.

SUPMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:This is a great day.
LEADMALE:Little Ashley joining me at Bel-Air Prep.
LEADMALE:Hey, I thought you asked Dad to send me to public school.
LEADMALE:Merely a trial balloon.
OTHERMALE:The fact remains that I love you.
SUPFEMALE:But if we run into each other at school, act like we've never met.
LEADMALE:Don't acknowledge me, don't talk to me, act like I'm invisible.
SUPMALE:If you're not sure how, just do what all the other girls do.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm serious.
SUPMALE:This is my senior year, and I don't want you tagging along.
LEADMALE:I've worked too hard at becoming popular.
LEADMALE:And any day now, it's going to kick in, right? Darn tooting.
OTHERMALE:Hey, look.
LEADMALE:I just think it's about time Bel-Air Prep went coed.
LEADMALE:There's going to be cute girls everywhere.
OTHERMALE:Cute, rich girls that know the one thing their parents can't stand is for them to be dating a big black dude.
LEADFEMALE:Will, can I hang out with you until I make some friends? Oh, yeah, sure, Ash.
LEADMALE:Just look for the huddle of girls with the chocolate center.
SUPFEMALE:It's a disgrace.
SUPFEMALE:It's a scandal.
OTHERFEMALE:It's an outrage! It's the mother of my children.
LEADMALE:Carlton, look.
LEADFEMALE:The way to make an impression is to relax, man.
LEADMALE:You got to be calm, chill out a little bit.
LEADMALE:Hurt me! Hurt me! What's up, baby? The name's Veronica.
LEADMALE:Veronica, I likes that.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Now, I can die.
SUPFEMALE:Hold up, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:See now, I noticed you noticing me.
LEADMALE:So I just want to put you on notice that I noticed you, too.
LEADMALE:And? And to let you know that, you know, I might consider letting you be with me.
LEADMALE:Is that what passes for a compliment around here?
OTHERMALE:Look, baby, listen.
LEADFEMALE:No, you listen.
SUPFEMALE:If you want a shot at being with me maybe you should try talking to me like a human being, okay? Got it? Actually, baby, you got it, but I take donations.
LEADMALE:Dag, Will.
LEADFEMALE:You sure have a way with the ladies.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, man, what's your secret? Well, I would like to help you out, my brother.
LEADMALE:But, you know, it's a chemical thing.
SUPMALE:You drug them? No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Kenny, it's instinct.
LEADFEMALE:Like, you know the old 
LEADFEMALE:"Those who can, do, those who can't, teach"? Well, I can and I do.
LEADFEMALE:That's deep, man.
LEADMALE:Slide over here for a second.
SUPMALE:I'll give you a few pointers.
LEADMALE:Incoming! Well, Carlton, here we have a couple of particularly impressive competitors.
LEADFEMALE:Judges! Will, the judges like her.
SUPFEMALE:They really, really like her.
SUPMALE:And let's hear it for the East German team!
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Carl.
OTHERMALE:Out of the way, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to see.
LEADMALE:Ashley, watch out! I can't believe how hard it is to find a beachfront place with a pool and tennis court for $500 a month.
SUPMALE:I mean, what's happening to this country? It's enough to make me want to vote.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should lower your standards a little.
LEADMALE:You're not going to be happy until I'm living in a trailer, eating Spam on Ritz.
LEADMALE:I mean, that's where this is going, isn't it? Sweetheart, I found a few places that don't look so bad.
LEADMALE:I'm beginning to get the idea that you want to get rid of me.
OTHERFEMALE:Run with that.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:So how was the first day at school?
LEADMALE:Way cool, grand hombre.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Uncle Phil, it was booming, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Tasties everywhere.
SUPMALE:I mean, big ones, small ones, short ones, tall ones Black ones, brown ones, rich ones, poor ones, crazy ones.
LEADFEMALE:Well, your aunt and I used to It's not important.
LEADMALE:Carlton, I thought you were against girls at Bel-Air Prep.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll be the first to admit I had great reservations about it but I've already learned that many of my assumptions about the opposite sex were just plain wrong.
LEADFEMALE:And that was just from 10 minutes of hiding under the bleachers.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPMALE:Come on over here.
LEADFEMALE:You know, that reminds me of my freshman year at college.
LEADMALE:Now, for extra money, I had to work for the Princeton Dai/y.
LEADMALE:And my first assignment was to interview the town's most famous stripper Boom Boom LaSalle.
LEADMALE:I wonder why they called her that? For some reason, I don't know what, she kind of took a liking to me and so she invited me to go with her and her sister to their dressing room for drinks.
LEADFEMALE:You the man.
LEADMALE:Anyway, one thing led to another and before I knew it, this old country boy finished his y oo-hoo and went right home.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute, Philip.
SUPMALE:Go back to where you finished your y oo-hoo.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley! Ashley, baby, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:How was school?
LEADMALE:School was fine.
LEADMALE:Did you make any new friends?
SUPMALE:A few.
LEADMALE:I've got to go study.
LEADMALE:Well, did some of the boys try anything with you? No, nothing.
LEADMALE:Nothing at all.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil, you'll be happy to know that none of the boys tried nothing with me, neither.
SUPFEMALE:There you go noticing me again.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you, she wants me.
OTHERMALE:She senses my raw animal power and is incapable of turning away.
SUPFEMALE:She senses that big, wet, nasty blob of mayonnaise on your cheek and she can't eat till you wipe it off.
LEADMALE:So, yo, you seen Ashley today?
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Me neither.
OTHERFEMALE:I wonder where she at.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know and I don't care.
SUPMALE:As long as she doesn't try to sit with me again.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of hard to impress the honeys when your baby sister's blowing bubbles in your milk.
OTHERMALE:Will, check out the talent.
OTHERFEMALE:She's cool! She's hot!
LEADFEMALE:She's
LEADFEMALE:y our baby sister, man! Ease back, man, ease back.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think you're doing?
SUPFEMALE:Buzz off, short stuff.
LEADMALE:That's it, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to I'm ordering you to look unattractive.
LEADMALE:Ashley, who did you have for breakfast, some hormones or something? Beat it.
SUPMALE:I'm working the room.
LEADMALE:Hi, Bobby.
LEADMALE:Where'd she learn to walk like that? Yeah, where'd she get that Lee Press-On body? Hurt me! Hurt me! Yo, baby.
SUPFEMALE:You see, I noticed you noticing me.
OTHERMALE:And I wanted to give you notice that I noticed you, too.
SUPFEMALE:Baby, you float my boat.
SUPFEMALE:I know you better float your midget boat on out of here.
LEADMALE:Will, man, ease up.
LEADFEMALE:No, you ease up, man.
OTHERMALE:What do you think you're doing? The same thing that you do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just trying to press up this woman.
SUPMALE:That ain't no woman, that's my cousin.
LEADFEMALE:I am too a woman, and I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my business.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you shake your neck at me like that, girl.
SUPMALE:Come on, Kenny.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:And don't you shake that either.
SUPMALE:I did it.
SUPMALE:I found the perfect place, and it's within my budget.
LEADMALE:You did?
LEADMALE:That's great, baby.
LEADMALE:You guys were right.
LEADMALE:I do have what it takes to survive.
SUPFEMALE:And it's true what they 
OTHERMALE:"You give a man a fish, you feed him for a day" But you give a man a cow and he can eat for a month, maybe more.
LEADFEMALE:Don't, don't, don't.
SUPMALE:She's on a roll.
OTHERFEMALE:This place has got it all.
LEADMALE:Pool, tennis, and full utilities.
SUPMALE:And I won't need any more than the $500 a month that Daddy promised me.
OTHERMALE:That's an incredible deal.
SUPMALE:Unbelievable, even.
OTHERMALE:I think we should see this place.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if you want to.
OTHERFEMALE:I wouldn't miss it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get the car keys.
LEADMALE:You're not going to need them.
LEADMALE:Why? Is it in the neighborhood? You're getting warmer.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where is it, exactly? I'm going to live in the pool house.
LEADFEMALE:You said I had to be out of the house, but not off of the property.
LEADMALE:And with the money that Daddy promised me it will cover my furniture rental.
LEADMALE:Philip! Philip, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, we're getting off easy.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not fair.
SUPMALE:She's winning! Baby, I'm telling you.
LEADMALE:You've got more moves than a bowl of Jell-O.
LEADFEMALE:And there's always room for Jell-O.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Dude sounds like a jackass.
LEADMALE:Actually, Will, he sounds like you.
OTHERMALE:So, Kenny, when are we going out?
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, baby.
LEADFEMALE:You have to let me check my book, and I'll get back to you.
LEADMALE:You see, I want to make sure I can give you my undivided attention.
LEADMALE:Actually, Will, he's better than you.
LEADMALE:I mean, look at you, you got it going on.
OTHERMALE:You got sweet hips, lips and fingertips.
LEADFEMALE:But, baby got back! Bye, baby.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute! Will.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I know my sister needs me, but that girl was babelicious.
OTHERMALE:Carlton I think you know what you have to do.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Still I would have liked to have been there for Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:I was so sure looking like this would make me popular.
LEADMALE:I mean, what do guys want, anyway? Ashley, look, guys want a girl who's sweet and kind and smart.
LEADMALE:Just like you.
OTHERMALE:Kenny wanted the girl with back.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, look, Kenny's a special case.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton wanted the same girl.
LEADFEMALE:Well, see, Carlton's a basket case.
LEADFEMALE:What about all the boys in the hall yesterday?
SUPMALE:See, Ashley
LEADFEMALE:And all the guys in the beer commercials?
LEADMALE:Look, Ashley
SUPFEMALE:And all the guys who ask Hilary out.
OTHERMALE:Look, all right, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Ashley, I can't lie to you, all right? Some guys don't know what's special about a woman.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, a lot of guys don't know.
LEADMALE:Well, really, damn near all guys don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Ashley, there's still some guys that appreciate quality, you know? And you're quality.
SUPFEMALE:You don't got to do all this.
LEADMALE:Just work on being you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, the right guy will come along.
SUPFEMALE:I promise you.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Have your people call my people.
LEADFEMALE:We'll do lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Give Mama a kiss, baby.
LEADMALE:I'm really glad you're my cousin.
LEADFEMALE:Mama know.
LEADMALE:Go on, girl.
SUPMALE:Veronica you know, I've thought about what you said yesterday and you know, I just wanted to tell you, you was right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry about the way I behaved and I'd be real grateful if I could have your number, so I could call you.
SUPFEMALE:That's really nice.
LEADMALE:What did I say? What did you say? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You thought over what I said, and I was right.
LEADMALE:What did you agree with? Yo, it was deep.
LEADMALE:I agreed with all of it.
LEADMALE:You have no idea what I said, do you? Wait, hold up, girl, you tripping.
SUPMALE:I know what you said.
LEADMALE:You, you 'Cause we was right here.
OTHERMALE:You said that people who live in glass cribs shouldn't throw hard stuff.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:"Let your smile be your umbrella"? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Who cares what you said, baby.
SUPMALE:I'm saying I'm trying to be with you.
LEADMALE:That's the first honest thing you said to me.
SUPFEMALE:That's like a good thing, right? That's a very good thing.
OTHERFEMALE:That's what I'm saying! Write down your number! You can't get it yet.
LEADMALE:But I've got your number.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hold up.
LEADMALE:Am I as superficial as all those guys I warned Ashley about? I mean could it be that I'm more obsessed with breasts and thighs than Colonel Sanders ever was? Mightn't I be able to look deeper? I mean, to cherish women as full and complete and complex individuals.
LEADMALE:And with this new understanding to finally find and keep this true love that eludes so many of us.
LEADFEMALE:Nah! Yo, baby, I know your feet must be tired 'cause you been running through my mind all day.
OTHERMALE:Come here, girl! How are we supposed to translate Cicero with a bunch of girls glossing their hair, and glossing their lips and messing up lines and just trying to cover it, but not being able to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we got a lot of women in the audience.
LEADFEMALE:Any of y'all ever glossed your hair? Because I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's a new cu/t thing or something, that / don't know about.
SUPMALE:
