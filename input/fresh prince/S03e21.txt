LEADFEMALE: Hey, what up, C?
LEADMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADMALE:Bacon, avocado, and mayonnaise.
LEADFEMALE:Alex, the question is, "What are three things found in Uncle Phil's beard?" Yuck! Now, I lost my appetite.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, Will.
LEADFEMALE:No, thank you, man.
SUPFEMALE:Master William, here are the maps you requested for your road trip.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, G.
LEADMALE:University of Nevada.
LEADMALE:Where at graduation they don't wear their tassels on their caps, if you know what I'm saying.
SUPFEMALE:You sure are lucky, Will.
LEADMALE:Spending the weekend at a college campus with 4,000 hot coeds and you get to bunk with Dad and Sara Lee.
SUPFEMALE:Crocket anyone? Jazz, you all right, man? You got a kind of a Clark Kent-Urkel thing jumping all over you.
SUPMALE:Actually, Will, he looks like me.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, that's what I was saying.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm all ready for my trip to college.
LEADMALE:About time, too.
SUPFEMALE:I spent eight years in high school.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, Uncle Phil is going to be my chaperon and I don't think he wants you to come, buddy.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I better return these stupid, funky clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Here, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Hello, Master William.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's up, G? Hey, check it out.
SUPMALE:I just finished making my schedule for the weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Figure if I work fast, I can see everything that this college has to offer.
LEADMALE:This is a list of sororities.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, sir, from alpha to gamma to bad Mama-Jamma.
LEADFEMALE:Silly me.
SUPFEMALE:When I went to university, I actually spent most of my time studying.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, yeah, but look at you now, G.
SUPMALE:Touch√©.
SUPMALE:Did you by any chance see Murder, She Wrote last week?
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Watch your back.
SUPFEMALE:I just love having a little brother.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it cute the way he burps and drools and dribbles? Look, you guys, Carlton's 18 now.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think we should continue to encourage that type of behavior.
LEADFEMALE:We're talking about the new baby.
LEADMALE:I never thought I'd actually enjoy taking care of one.
LEADFEMALE:It's for you, Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:We better get to the club.
LEADMALE:All right, but I draw the line at breastfeeding.
SUPMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, you ready to burn some rubber, make some tracks?
LEADFEMALE:Cough up a lung?
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I never felt better.
OTHERFEMALE:Call an ambulance.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, whoa.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, man, you can't do this to me.
LEADFEMALE:I've been planning this trip for months.
LEADMALE:Hey, I tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, you can make it.
SUPMALE:There's a Dodger dog in it for you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Will, I don't think I can make it.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, you can.
SUPMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, you're just going to have to call the university and cancel, that's all.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, why can't you trust me to go by myself? Because I'm smarter than the average bear.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, if you can't trust me I mean, there's got to be somebody you trust me to go with.
SUPMALE:Hey-ho, campers.
LEADFEMALE:Cut it out, Will.
LEADFEMALE:No hijinks while driving, young man.
SUPMALE:And fasten that seatbelt.
LEADMALE:It's the law.
SUPMALE:Yes, sir, Deputy Dawg.
LEADMALE:Carlton, did you see that billboard? Come on, man, I'm starving.
SUPMALE:Yes, hello, this is Tony Montana.
LEADMALE:I just saw your billboard on the highway.
LEADFEMALE:If you know what's good for you you'll make me a pepperoni pizza with anchovies on it.
LEADMALE:Will, what do you think you're doing? What's it sound like I'm doing? Yeah, no, we're going north on l-80.
OTHERMALE:Just look for the little, square-head guy who can just barely see over the steering wheel.
LEADFEMALE:Grow up, Will.
LEADMALE:Oh, Carlton, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:What's up girls? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Slow down.
LEADMALE:We could use a little roadside assistance, you know? Will, do you want me to turn this car around? I want you to speed up and catch up with them girls, man.
SUPFEMALE:That's it, mister, you're on a time-out.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, man, look.
LEADMALE:You really need to loosen up, man.
SUPFEMALE:Look, we're young and we're single.
LEADMALE:One of us is really handsome, the other one is you.
LEADMALE:But, come on, man, we're kids.
SUPFEMALE:It's our job to act like idiots.
SUPFEMALE:That's your job, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here representing Dad.
LEADMALE:My job is to ruin your fun.
SUPFEMALE:And you really love your work, don't you? What's wrong now? Look, man, I got to go bathroom.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, but the next bathroom break isn't scheduled for another 33 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that may be so, but whether you stop or not, I'm going in one minute.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get a good feeling about this place, Will.
SUPMALE:It's cool.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll take care of it.
SUPMALE:We ain't black.
LEADFEMALE:We just got back from Hawaii.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you have exactly 45 seconds to get back from the bathroom.
SUPFEMALE:If you're not back, I'm leaving without you.
LEADMALE:Carlton, it may take you 45 seconds but it takes a fully grown man a little while longer.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, you just wasted about 15 seconds, buddy.
SUPMALE:You smell chicken?
LEADMALE:Forget about it, Will.
SUPMALE:Rule number 13, no poultry in the car.
SUPMALE:Are we there yet? Will, I think the engine's knocking.
LEADMALE:That's not where the engine is, stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Chicken, my brother? Jazz, how did you get in the trunk? It was easy.
LEADMALE:Oh, by the way, you need a new lock for your garage.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPMALE:College.
SUPMALE:Just like I imagined it.
LEADMALE:Can I help you fellows? Yeah, I guess you might as well fill her up.
LEADFEMALE:And wash the windows.
LEADMALE:And look under the hood for you know, hood things.
SUPMALE:I don't know how people play these things.
SUPFEMALE:They're so boring.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, touch that handle, Granny, and you'll be pulling back a nub.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Homer.
LEADFEMALE:What's up with the Benz, man? Well, considering my limited experience with foreign cars this being the first one anyone's actually let me touch I think it went pretty well.
LEADMALE:Let me guess.
SUPFEMALE:You have a nuclear reactor in your backyard, don't you? What do we owe you? It's $300.
SUPFEMALE:There's $25 for the gas and $275 to call Germany to find out whether it took regular or unleaded.
LEADMALE:Yo, man, are you crazy? Well, I prefer the term "emotionally challenged.
SUPMALE:" And you still owe me $300.
OTHERMALE:This guy's scaring me.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just pay him and get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Do you prefer a check or credit card?
LEADMALE:Cash.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I've only got $40 cash.
LEADMALE:You've got to take a credit card.
LEADMALE:I mean, everyone takes credit cards.
SUPFEMALE:What kind of hick are you? The kind that don't take credit cards.
SUPFEMALE:I'm afraid I'm just going to have to keep the car.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Homer, Homer, Homer.
LEADFEMALE:Chill, check it out, man, look.
SUPFEMALE:I got $30.
OTHERMALE:Jazz, how much you got? Well, between this soda can and what I got in my wallet I'm good for a nickel.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Homer, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:We'll get you your money, man.
OTHERFEMALE:We just need a few minutes, all right? All right, it's no problem.
LEADMALE:If you need me, I'll be at McDonald's watching the numbers change.
SUPFEMALE:Great, what are we going to do now? All right, all right.
SUPMALE:Look, let's just think, man.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sure we can come up with something if we just put our heads together.
SUPFEMALE:You got me.
SUPMALE:Yes, yes, yes! Come to Lola.
SUPMALE:Coming.
LEADFEMALE:All right, check it out.
SUPFEMALE:We going to get paid right here.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, give me your money.
LEADMALE:Forget it, Will.
LEADMALE:I will not let you succumb to the base pleasures of gambling.
LEADMALE:Besides, we're underage.
SUPMALE:Can I get $40 in quarters? What do you say, Jazz? You turn my $30 into $300? Does James Brown use a hot comb? Jazz, that was our last chip, man.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, man.
LEADFEMALE:We got her right where we want her.
SUPFEMALE:Full house.
LEADMALE:Yes! Jazz, you lost all our money, man.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you said you knew how to play poker.
SUPMALE:Poker? You mean this isn't Go Fish? Tough luck, boys.
LEADFEMALE:Next victim? Hey, Lola, Lola, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Check it out.
OTHERMALE:Looky here.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we had an understanding, you know? I mean, where I come from, when a man is nice to you you don't take all his money.
LEADMALE:I mean, at least not while he's still awake.
SUPMALE:You're breaking my heart.
LEADFEMALE:Take a hike.
LEADFEMALE:Lola, baby, come on.
SUPMALE:I mean, you got to give me a chance to win my money back.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, 'cause if you don't, then I'm not going to be able to get my car.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, baby, have a heart.
LEADMALE:I'm just a poor black man trying to get to a panty raid.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look, I'll give you a job.
LEADFEMALE:You can work off your debts.
LEADFEMALE:Like Woodrow here.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, my Studebaker broke down way back in '78.
LEADMALE:I've been working here all this time to pay it off.
SUPMALE:Fifteen more years and you can just eat my dust.
OTHERMALE:Check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Lola I don't want to die here an old white man, okay?
LEADMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:What? I think I got the answer to our problem right here in my sock.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz, ain't nobody going to pay no money to see your sixth toe.
OTHERMALE:Allow me, my brother.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, you've been holding out on me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Emergency bean-pot fund.
OTHERMALE:Miss Lola, can I interest you in a game of chance? I'm listening.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I'm thinking of a number between one and ten.
LEADFEMALE:What is it?
LEADMALE:Four.
LEADMALE:Damn! You boys are pathetic.
SUPMALE:All right, I'm going to give you another shot, slim.
OTHERFEMALE:Double or nothing, high card wins.
SUPMALE:All right, you're on.
OTHERFEMALE:Black queen.
SUPMALE:Something I can relate to.
LEADFEMALE:Scaboom! A black king, and I don't mean Shaka Zulu.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Quarters.
OTHERFEMALE:I have to have quarters, Will.
OTHERMALE:Carlton, wait.
OTHERMALE:See, I know I can beat it.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, listen
SUPFEMALE:First, it was bell, bell, cherry.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:And then cherry, lemon, lemon.
LEADMALE:Carlton
LEADMALE:But now, it's just cherry, cherry, bell.
OTHERFEMALE:Cherry, cherry, bell.
OTHERFEMALE:Cherry, cherry, bell! Every time a cherry, cherry, bell! Carlton! Get a grip on yourself, man.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I got the money for the car.
LEADMALE:We can leave.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:It's this damn thing.
LEADFEMALE:It just sits there taunting me.
SUPMALE:"What's wrong, Carlton?" "Lost your nerve, sissy boy?" Look, you got to help me, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Make it stop.
LEADMALE:Carlton
SUPMALE:Okay, everybody, stand back.
SUPMALE:If I apply the Vulcan death grip, and press real hard right here I believe I can make him black out.
LEADMALE:Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:Look, look, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, if you get in the car right now I promise we can sing the theme to West Side Story, okay? You can be Maria.
SUPFEMALE:I just want to play a few more times.
SUPMALE:Boy, did you hear what I said? Get your butt in that car right now.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you roll your eyes at me.
LEADMALE:I can't leave now, Will.
OTHERMALE:See, I figured the odds.
OTHERFEMALE:If I just play 9,063 more times, I know I can beat it.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Carlton, Carlton, listen.
LEADMALE:This is what gambling does to you, all right? It's a disease and it's evil.
LEADFEMALE:Stop it.
LEADMALE:Right now.
OTHERMALE:Buzz off, flattop.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Carlton, I ain't playing with you, man.
LEADMALE:Get your butt in that car right now!
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you just get off my damn back? Okay, see, now it's on.
LEADFEMALE:All right, see, my mother don't talk to me like that.
LEADMALE:Come on, Jazz, let's go.
LEADMALE:I mean, Jazz, we was right for leaving Carlton, right? Absolutely.
LEADMALE:I mean, I've been looking forward to this weekend for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:And there ain't no way that I should miss out on it just cause he got the hots for the slots.
LEADMALE:You on a roll with a side of slaw.
SUPMALE:I mean, what? He expect us to babysit him while he have a nervous breakdown? He's so selfish, man.
SUPMALE:That boy put the "E" in ignorant.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just saying, look, it ain't no way I'm letting Carlton ruin this weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Are we slowing down? I mean, nothing, but nothing, should stand between a man and his Phi Beta booty.
SUPMALE:Will, you're only doing 20 over the speed limit.
OTHERMALE:What's wrong? Look, didn't I say nothing's wrong, man? Except the fact that I got a tank full of gas, a campus full of honeys and all I keep thinking about is that little midget we left back there.
LEADFEMALE:Will, honestly, I don't think Ashley wanted to come along.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not talking about Ashley.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about Carlton, man.
LEADFEMALE:We left him back there without a friend in the world.
LEADMALE:Then he should feel right at home.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you know what, I think you're right, man.
LEADFEMALE:He don't need us and we don't need him.
SUPMALE:Could luck be a lady tonight? Tramp.
LEADMALE:Michael Jackson impression? Only a quarter.
SUPFEMALE:Here's 50 cents.
OTHERMALE:Now, get out of my face.
SUPMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Evening, Bo.
LEADMALE:What can I get you? Shirley Temple.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, no giggling when you bring it to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll draw your portrait for a quarter.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah! No! That's my money.
LEADFEMALE:I've been feeding this machine all night.
SUPMALE:Those quarters are mine.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, man, what do you think you're doing? Get out of my way.
LEADFEMALE:This is my money.
OTHERMALE:I don't like your attitude.
LEADMALE:Can it, steroid breath.
LEADMALE:What did you say? See? He's doing great.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Bo, now knock it off.
LEADMALE:You might break something.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, like my cousin.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, yo, chill.
OTHERFEMALE:What's up? What's up, man? Bigfoot here stole my quarters.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, I'm just guessing here, but name calling? Bad idea.
SUPMALE:Hey, man, you tore my shirt.
OTHERMALE:My mother bought me this shirt.
SUPFEMALE:And you know, I'm sure she's a really fine woman.
LEADFEMALE:But you got plenty of quarters.
LEADMALE:Why don't you go call your mom, have her send you a new shirt? I don't want a new shirt.
LEADFEMALE:I want to clean the bar with his face.
LEADMALE:I'm saying, my brother, pick on somebody your own size.
LEADMALE:So what are you saying? Well, I mean, I wasn't suggesting me specifically.
LEADFEMALE:Bo, now this isn't a fair fight.
LEADMALE:Any bets? I'll take $5 on the big guy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm saying, ain't nobody going to chump me.
SUPMALE:I ain't no punk.
SUPMALE:You know, Will, you don't have to Look, the time comes when a man has to take responsibility and fight his own battles.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll let you know when the time comes.
LEADMALE:Give me $10 on Bo.
OTHERFEMALE:Prince, I know how you can take this dude.
SUPFEMALE:How good are you at faking seizures? Thanks for the vote of confidence, Jazz.
LEADMALE:Look, check it out.
SUPFEMALE:Just take the keys, start the engine.
LEADMALE:I'm going to bite him and jump in the car.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get busy.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't got all night.
LEADMALE:Night/ine is on in two minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Can I stretch first, please? Pull a muscle or something out here.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody got any kryptonite in the house? Yeah, man, that's real funny.
SUPFEMALE:Really? So you're not going to hit me? You're not that funny.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, no, but I can be, though.
SUPFEMALE:That's funny, though, right?
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, wait a minute, man.
SUPFEMALE:You wait one damn minute! We brothers, man.
LEADMALE:This is crazy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we shouldn't be out here about to fight over a couple quarters.
LEADMALE:I mean, in this cruel, hard world we got to stick together, man.
LEADMALE:Or we done, man.
SUPMALE:And if you want to be the brother that casts the first stone for the degradation of the entire race then you go right ahead.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you get the feeling back in your head yet? You say something, Uncle Phil? Will, I just want to thank you for standing up for me.
LEADFEMALE:Man, look, it was nothing.
SUPFEMALE:What is family for? Plus, we shouldn't have left you there in the first place, man.
LEADMALE:Anything could have happened.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry about that.
LEADFEMALE:Are you crazy? I had the time of my life.
OTHERMALE:What? Will, for a little while, I was living on the edge.
OTHERMALE:I, Carlton Banks, recording secretary of the audio visual squad was gambling, swearing, and staying up really, really late.
LEADMALE:I mean, I feel so liberated.
SUPMALE:Quick, open the back window.
LEADMALE:Yo, for what, man?
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to moon Nevada.
LEADMALE:Bottoms up.
SUPMALE:Carlton, come on, put that thing away.
SUPFEMALE:Someone's going to get hurt.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry, Will.
LEADMALE:This is my lucky day.
OTHERMALE:I knew your butt was going to get us in trouble, man.
LEADFEMALE:University of Nevada, here I come.
LEADMALE:Where at graduation I got all this in my mouth.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Where at graduation 
LEADMALE:
