LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:I mean, on the lips.
SUPFEMALE:So do I.
LEADMALE:Will, I need to know everything you know about sex.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ashley.
SUPMALE:Don't you think sex is something you should discuss with Aunt Viv? You know, like, over a cup of General Foods International Coffee? Look, I mean, it's hard enough for me to accept the fact that Mom and Dad even did it.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to talk about it with them.
LEADMALE:Besides, we've already discussed all the technical stuff.
LEADMALE:I mean, I know all about eggs, fallopian tubes Am I gonna have to wash your mouth out with soap, young lady? Will, grow up.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm old enough to marry Jerry Lee Lewis.
SUPFEMALE:Look, if Mom and Dad knew about all these weird feelings I'm starting to have, they'd freak.
LEADMALE:Promise not to tell them?
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:But I want you to stop having these feelings.
LEADMALE:You don't want to be that kind of girl.
LEADMALE:You mean the kind you like? What is this? The Spanish Inquisition? Look, Will, when a girl doesn't fool around you never call her back.
LEADMALE:There's a reason for that, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Not one I'm proud of, but there's a reason for that.
LEADMALE:It's 'cause there's nothing to remember.
SUPMALE:Now, how come it's okay for you and not for me? Look, it's just Look, well Look, I can't answer all these questions, Ashley.
SUPMALE:And I thought you were the one person who would understand.
LEADMALE:I do understand, Ashley.
LEADMALE:You know, it's just that I just need a little time to get prepared, all right? But I thought you knew everything about sex.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well Look, I just, you know I just want to make sure there haven't been any new developments, you know in the last day or so.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hey, thanks a lot for helping me, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so excited! Will you stop talking dirty?
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Is Ashley ready?
LEADMALE:No, man.
LEADFEMALE:She's only 13!
OTHERMALE:Hi, Kevin.
SUPMALE:Hi, Ashley.
OTHERMALE:So, you wanna go watch some TV now?

LEADMALE:TV.
LEADMALE:What a great idea! Come on, let's go into the family room for some nice family fun.
LEADMALE:Come on, kids, have a seat.
LEADMALE:Let's watch some TV.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Couple number two.
OTHERMALE:Where's the most unusual place you've ever made whoopee? Boy, that was good.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how about some music? I wanna sex you up Filth.
LEADMALE:I like that song.
LEADFEMALE:You would.
LEADMALE:You men disgust me.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, there's my favorite cousin.
SUPMALE:Come over here and have a seat with us.
LEADMALE:Hey, move over, man.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I'm late to pick up Dora.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Now wouldn't you much rather spend time with us playing a nice sweet game of Duck-Duck-Goose? Dora can tie a slipknot with her tongue.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Who ate all the whipped cream? Is there no end to you people's preoccupation with sex? Somebody's girlfriend got grounded again? May I please speak to the two of you in the kitchen? Right now? It's Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, you can't tell Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:But she asked me to tell her about sex.
OTHERMALE:I don't know what to tell her.
LEADMALE:I mean, she should hear it from somebody more experienced.
OTHERMALE:Well, pardon me for being attractive.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'm the wrong person.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I tried to tell Carlton about sex And, well, you know the rest.
SUPMALE:Look, well, somebody has to tell her.
SUPMALE:I mean, she won't do anything stupid if she has some good solid facts.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong, my hot-blooded cousin.
LEADFEMALE:If you tell her about sex, she's just gonna run out and do it.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's ridiculous, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:We wanna expose her to a realistic portrayal of relationships.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:We'll rent Pretty Woman.
LEADMALE:Well, here we are to get information for our book report.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just here to check the place for asbestos.
SUPFEMALE:This is embarrassing, Will.
LEADMALE:Why did you have to drag me down here anyway? Please.
LEADMALE:Look at this face.
LEADFEMALE:You think anybody's gonna believe I have questions about sex? Is there a John Doe and a Joan Crawford? I choked, okay? Present.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Miss Rinkoff.
LEADMALE:I'm one of the counselors here.
LEADMALE:Right this way, please.
SUPMALE:Shall we step into your office and talk about asbestos? Asbestos? Last I heard, it was called knocking boots.
LEADMALE:Please, have a seat.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, how can I help you? By turning into an old ugly man.
LEADMALE:Boys, there's no reason to be embarrassed about sex.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, we're all adults here.
SUPFEMALE:Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone has questions about their reproductive organs.
LEADMALE:Must you be so raw? Well, actually, it's about my cousin.
LEADFEMALE:His sister.
SUPMALE:She's 13.
OTHERFEMALE:Is she pregnant? Hey, that's my sister you're talking about.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry to say it, but that's reality.
LEADFEMALE:These days more and more teenage girls are having sex.
OTHERFEMALE:They certainly don't go to our school.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we can't control people's actions but we can help kids make wise choices, not stupid ones.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Here's a pamphlet called The Truth about Sex.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Nope, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:And here's one about the prevention of pregnancy.
SUPFEMALE:Here's one about AIDS.
OTHERFEMALE:And here's one about dealing with your emotions.
LEADMALE:Sure a lot of stuff to read.
SUPMALE:Yes, I know.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I think this is something your parents should be discussing with you and your cousin.
LEADFEMALE:That's not likely with Uncle Phil.
OTHERMALE:He won't let us watch Snow White 'cause she lives with seven dwarfs.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Not so fast.
LEADMALE:I think it's wonderful you have information for your cousin
LEADMALE:but what about you?
LEADMALE:I practice abstinence.
LEADFEMALE:But I think I've got that down and I'm ready to move on.
OTHERMALE:Will! Hey, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Black folks playing tennis.
LEADMALE:I wonder if there's a white guy somewhere tap-dancing.
LEADFEMALE:Kids, we found these pamphlets.
SUPFEMALE:Is there anything anyone here would like to discuss? Okay.
LEADMALE:Who's pregnant? Hey, not me.
LEADMALE:Not me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna go out on a limb and make that unanimous.
SUPMALE:Now, somebody in this house needs to talk about sex and it ain't one of us.
LEADFEMALE:But that only leaves Oh, God, tell me it's Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:I think it's our not-so-little girl.
LEADMALE:Okay, kids.
LEADFEMALE:Your father and I need to talk alone.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Now, just remember that sex is as natural as breathing.
LEADMALE:And I'm gonna hold my breath till I'm married.
LEADFEMALE:I can still remember the night Ashley was born.
LEADFEMALE:She looked like a beautiful, little, black Winston Churchill.
OTHERFEMALE:Seems like yesterday.
OTHERMALE:Our baby's not a baby anymore, is she? You know, I knew it was time to have a talk with her and I tried to the other night but I just couldn't face the fact
SUPFEMALE:that she was having sexual feelings.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian.
OTHERMALE:Vivian, how could this happen to us? We live in a good neighborhood, they go to good schools.
LEADFEMALE:She's never even had a cavity, for God's sake.
LEADMALE:Vivian, times have changed since you and I were young.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, they've changed since Hilary and Carlton were young.
LEADMALE:Well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
LEADMALE:You pack your bags, we are moving to Greenland.
OTHERMALE:Now, this is not easy for me, either, but this is our job, honey.
SUPMALE:We're parents.
OTHERFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:We can do this.
LEADMALE:We can do it.
SUPFEMALE:Hi! I can't do it.
LEADMALE:Can't do what, Daddy? We want to talk to you.
LEADMALE:About sex.
LEADFEMALE:I know where babies come from.
LEADMALE:I took sex education.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you took band.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I know that there are some feelings you're experiencing as a young woman.
LEADMALE:And I just wanna know, do you have questions? Well, a few.
SUPFEMALE:Then we'll do our best to answer them for you.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Kevin asked his mom a question and she fainted.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess the first thing I better do, then, is sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:Dora can tie a
LEADFEMALE:Slipknot.
LEADMALE:Slipknot.
SUPMALE:Dora can fit a whole orange in her mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Dora.
