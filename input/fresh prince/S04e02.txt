SUPMALE:On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-
LEADFEMALE:I cannot believe that you and Carlton are moving into your own place.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Dad, I have to go.
LEADMALE:No, you don't.
SUPMALE:Will says I do.
SUPFEMALE:He says it's time for me to leave the nest, become independent and have sex with girls.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, everybody, guess what.
OTHERMALE:I'm getting married.
OTHERMALE:Will, I've met the woman of my dreams.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:No, no, no!
LEADMALE:Baby!
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Girl, look at you.
LEADMALE:That's for not calling me after you left.
SUPMALE:Well, I called you twice times.
SUPMALE:The line was busy.
OTHERMALE:Will, you have not changed, have you? Carlton, I'll see you later.
SUPFEMALE:Since I didn't buy a program on the way in could you please tell me what the heck is going on? Man, look, that filly is from Philly.
LEADFEMALE:We grew up together.
LEADFEMALE:What does that mean, "grew up together"? What do you want it to mean? That she hates you and you have no interest in her.
SUPMALE:You saw her smack me, didn't you? I've seen a lot of girls smack you, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Then I see the same girls leaving your room.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, Jackie is not like most girls.
OTHERMALE:She's special.
LEADFEMALE:Look at her.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, man, she used to be able to beat every brother on the playground in a foot race.
LEADFEMALE:I'll fight you for her, Will.
SUPMALE:Any time, any place.
OTHERFEMALE:Relax.
LEADFEMALE:I got about as much chance with Jackie as you do.
SUPMALE:Hey, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Did Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gorodetsky say anything about this building being a landmark or something? No, why? Because there's a tour bus pulling up on the front lawn.
LEADMALE:All right, y'all, everybody in rows one through 15 the party's in apartment 206.
LEADMALE:Jazz!
LEADFEMALE:Jazz! Everybody in rows 16 through 30.
OTHERFEMALE:And have money in your hands.
SUPMALE:Senior citizens get a 10-percent discount.
SUPFEMALE:I do take tips.
SUPMALE:So, Will what's on tap for tomorrow? Daddy, how about a November wedding? Nothing extravagant, just 800 of our closest friends and relatives.
SUPFEMALE:Or maybe we could book the Forum.
LEADMALE:I'm sure the Lakers will be on the road by then.
LEADMALE:Daddy, is something wrong? I'm sorry, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:It's This wedding took me by surprise.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't count on losing you and Carlton on the same day.
LEADMALE:Oh, Daddy.
LEADMALE:You're not losing me.
LEADMALE:You promise? Look, even though I'm getting married you'll always be my daddy.
OTHERMALE:And you'll always be my little girl.
SUPMALE:I'm also Trevor's little girl.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Technically, you're his woman, not his little girl.
SUPFEMALE:Then why does he make me wear those outfits? Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm scheduled for a heart attack.
SUPFEMALE:Go away.
LEADMALE:Ain't no party.
OTHERMALE:Open up, it's Mr.
LEADMALE:Gorodetsky.
LEADFEMALE:Just a second, I'm undressed.
SUPMALE:Carlton, Carlton, wake up.
LEADFEMALE:Look out, Jerry.
OTHERFEMALE:Tom's gonna get you.
LEADMALE:Wake up, it's the landlord.
SUPFEMALE:We gotta put the furniture back.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Open up! Open up here! This used to be my lawn.
LEADMALE:And this used to be my banister.
SUPMALE:And you used to be my tenants.
LEADMALE:But But I want you out of here by noon.
LEADMALE:But
LEADMALE:Noon! He kicked your butt.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, that's our butts, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:We're in this together.
SUPMALE:Not anymore, Kemosabe.
LEADMALE:I'm going back to my family, where I belong.
LEADMALE:No, you are not.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Why? Because that will be like admitting we can't make it on our own.
LEADMALE:I don't have to make it on my own.
LEADFEMALE:I'm rich.
SUPMALE:I never wanted to move out in the first place.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks to you, I've had my heart broken and I've been evicted.
OTHERFEMALE:If this is your idea of independence, you can have it.
SUPMALE:I can be reached by fax.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, come on, man.
LEADMALE:I can't make rent without you.
OTHERFEMALE:Then come home, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I'll send Geoffrey for my things.
LEADMALE:Then go ahead home, you damn baby.
LEADFEMALE:You'll probably be there till you're in your 30s anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Like all those other serial killers.
LEADMALE:This is Jazz's mother.
LEADMALE:He's not here.
SUPMALE:This is Publishers Clearinghouse.
OTHERMALE:You've already won.
SUPMALE:It's about time.
SUPFEMALE:Open the door.
LEADFEMALE:Open the door.
LEADMALE:Will, I'm so glad it's you.
SUPFEMALE:I heard somebody disguised as me ran a party scam.
LEADMALE:Jazz, you got me kicked out my crib, man.
SUPFEMALE:Let me make it up to you.
LEADMALE:Talk fast, you've only got a few minutes to live.
LEADFEMALE:You can stay here with me.
LEADFEMALE:In this roach motel? It would only be temporary.
LEADMALE:I'm getting thrown out on the 15th.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz give me the money.
SUPMALE:Money? What money? The 25 dollars a head you charged for my party.
SUPMALE:Man, I was sneaking the bus back to the depot and I got held up.
OTHERMALE:White dude.
SUPFEMALE:He took the bus too.
SUPFEMALE:The money's gone, isn't it? Like the Jheri curl.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go, roomie.
LEADMALE:Get comfy.
LEADMALE:You're gonna love it here.
LEADFEMALE:That's the Wilsons.
SUPMALE:You'll get to know them.
LEADFEMALE:I hate you, Jazz.
LEADMALE:I know you don't mean that.
LEADFEMALE:"Roommate wanted.
SUPFEMALE:Minutes from school.
SUPFEMALE:Must love ice hockey, country-and-western music and Tom Cruise movies.
LEADMALE:" This is worse than Jazz's.
SUPMALE:Whoa, wait, back up, girl.
SUPMALE:Wax on, wax off.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I had to clock you last night, but you know me and my temper.
OTHERMALE:No, you know, I understand.
SUPMALE:That torch you've been carrying for me all these years suddenly got a little too hot to handle.
LEADFEMALE:We were friends, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing more.
LEADMALE:We were more than friends that night after Alonzo Simmons' party.
LEADFEMALE:I was young and immature then.
OTHERMALE:I guess you still are, Lobe.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, don't you be calling me Lobe.
LEADFEMALE:I left that in Philly, where I thought I left you.
SUPMALE:What are you doing out here anyway? Remember that jump shot you taught me? Well, I parlayed that into a basketball scholarship.
LEADMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.
LEADFEMALE:You mean they're giving basketball scholarships to girls now? Lmagine my surprise.
LEADMALE:There I was just churning butter, and the phone rings.
LEADFEMALE:So you and Carlton tight? He is.
SUPFEMALE:We're cousins.
LEADMALE:I've been staying with his family.
LEADMALE:In Bel-Air?
SUPMALE:Yeah, so?
SUPFEMALE:So beware of the bougieman.
LEADMALE:Hold on, hold on, hold on.
OTHERFEMALE:I kept in touch with everybody from the hood.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody but me.
SUPFEMALE:Why? Why? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Why would you keep in touch with everybody but me? I see this really bothers you.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes.
OTHERFEMALE:Damn you, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Just answer the question.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't you call me? Because I missed you too much.
LEADMALE:How's that? I said it.
SUPMALE:Happy? That what you wanna hear? Hey, y'all, I missed the hell out of her.
OTHERFEMALE:I missed her.
LEADFEMALE:I missed her.
SUPMALE:I said it.
SUPFEMALE:That's what you wanted, right? Everybody know I missed her.
SUPMALE:Look, I gotta get up out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Gotta go find me an apartment and a job.
LEADMALE:Don't hit your head on the rim.
LEADMALE:One of my people quit this morning.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Are you suggesting maybe you and me working together side by side? No, it's too tempting.
LEADFEMALE:Before long, you'd be dragging me down into the storeroom and snatching all my gear off and everything.
OTHERMALE:Then I have to nail you with a sexual-harassment suit like the Anita Hill thing in reverse.
SUPFEMALE:It's too much now.
LEADFEMALE:Look, maybe your transmission's stuck in junior high or something but mine's not.
LEADFEMALE:I busted my butt to get where I am, and I'm not about to lose focus just because you're back in my life.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I got me an agenda too.
SUPMALE:And it certainly does not include risking frostbite around you.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Well, good then.
LEADMALE:When do I start? Next week, when school starts.
SUPFEMALE:I will be here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Wear something warm.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, man, I didn't really miss her.
LEADFEMALE:That was just game I was kicking there.
SUPMALE:You know, that's how you gotta do it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, man.
LEADMALE:Hey, man.
SUPMALE:I was, man I was I was coming Coming back I was getting the rest of my stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, why don't you take some food too.
LEADFEMALE:We have plenty.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if it's gonna spoil.
LEADMALE:So things aren't going quite as smoothly as you planned, are they, son? Hey, hold up.
LEADMALE:Not only do I got me a new place to stay I got me a job on campus.
LEADMALE:Adversity is my oyster.
LEADMALE:This will go good with my adversity.
LEADMALE:Why don't you come home, Will? No, I can't, Uncle Phil, man.
LEADMALE:Don't get me wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I appreciate you taking me in and everything but I just feel like I'm at a point in my life where I need to have my own space.
LEADFEMALE:Trevor's about to propose.
LEADMALE:Where's Carlton? The last I saw him, he was in his room kissing the floor.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I just want you to know that the door is always open for you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:There's no place like home.
OTHERMALE:There's no place like home.
SUPFEMALE:There's no place like home.
OTHERFEMALE:Turn it up.
LEADMALE:Oh, there's Trevor.
SUPMALE:It's a bungee jump.
LEADFEMALE:I asked him to propose in a special way, but I never expected a bungee jump.
SUPMALE:What's a bungee jump? Well, Hil, he's gonna propose while falling 300 feet on a giant rubber band.
LEADMALE:Isn't it romantic? Please, whatever happened to getting down on one knee?
LEADMALE:Daddy, that's for old fogies.
LEADFEMALE:I got down on one knee.
SUPMALE:Sustained.
SUPFEMALE:Look, there he goes.
SUPMALE:Hilary Banks Yes, Trevor? Will you marry me? I ain't no bungee expert or nothing but I don't think he's supposed to be slamming into the ground like that.
LEADMALE:"Please stand by"? Great.
LEADMALE:The president's about to interrupt my marriage proposal.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just pray that Trevor's okay.
SUPMALE:Well, that was a lovely service.
LEADFEMALE:Trevor didn't look so bad for a dude that had a concrete face-lift.
LEADMALE:Fool.
LEADFEMALE:Like that was his real head.
SUPMALE:Could you two show a little compassion? Your sister's right behind you.
LEADFEMALE:I still can't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean technically.
LEADMALE:Am I a widow or what? This is all my fault.
OTHERMALE:If I hadn't asked for a special proposal Trevor would be in my arms instead of in my purse.
SUPMALE:I love you, Trevor.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary Trevor wasn't cremated.
SUPFEMALE:Then who's this? I'll see him to the door, Miss Hilary.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart Now is the time when you should make use of Reverend Boyd.
LEADFEMALE:Is he single? I mean you should be spiritual.
SUPFEMALE:After all, Trevor's in heaven now.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:He's up there with my little dog Scruffy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and the bus he rode in under.
LEADFEMALE:Must everything be a joke to you? My sister's in a fragile condition.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to help her bounce back.
OTHERMALE:Bounce.
SUPFEMALE:Trevor bounced.
LEADMALE:Son, go get yourself a milk.
LEADMALE:If you go right back to work as soon as possible maybe it would help you get your mind off things.
SUPMALE:Work? Every inch of that newsroom reminds me of Trevor.
OTHERFEMALE:His desk, his makeup bib the shower in his office.
OTHERMALE:I just need some time to find some sense of inner peace.
LEADMALE:After all I am alone now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:You have me.
SUPMALE:Look, in a few days why don't I take you to the mall and we can go shopping.
LEADFEMALE:Go to the mall with my father? Sorry, I forgot.
SUPMALE:Must you do that? I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but Greetings, mourners.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary.
OTHERMALE:If there's anything we can learn from this tragedy that's to live each day to the fullest.
LEADFEMALE:I know, Jazz.
SUPMALE:So with that in mind, what are you doing later? Oh, my
SUPMALE:It's all right.
SUPFEMALE:Guess y'all need to be alone right now.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, so do you, Jazz.
OTHERMALE:I'll meet you back at the palace later.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:There's a hostage situation back at my building.
SUPMALE:SWAT team said it'd be a week before we could get back in.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz Forgive me for what I'm about to do.
LEADMALE:Hilary, can I have a word with you? Look, you know, I think you got the right idea not going back to, you know, work so soon.
SUPMALE:You're just lucky that there's nothing around here that reminds you of Trevor.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, there is the pool house.
LEADFEMALE:Never mind, forget about that, though.
LEADMALE:Then, on the other hand that is where you and he shared countless romantic evenings.
LEADMALE:I bet if those walls could talk they'd 
LEADFEMALE:"Trevor.
SUPMALE:" "Trevor.
LEADMALE:" Daddy, I can't stay in the pool house.
LEADFEMALE:I'm moving back in here.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, sweetheart, whatever will make you more comfortable.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what I would do without my family.
OTHERMALE:Mother.
LEADMALE:Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Can you get my things from the pool house? Of course.
LEADMALE:Come on, Ashley.
LEADMALE:Say, Uncle Phil, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know what, Will? I was thinking maybe I could turn that pool house into a law library.
LEADFEMALE:Stop playing, listen.
LEADMALE:No, no, well A greenhouse.
SUPMALE:That would work, huh? I said, stop playing, listen.
LEADFEMALE:I was wondering
SUPFEMALE:You can have the pool house.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:At the same rent Hilary was paying.
SUPFEMALE:And I have a few rules.
LEADFEMALE:That's cool, because I got demands.
LEADFEMALE:No loud music after 11.
OTHERFEMALE:Twelve.
SUPMALE:Eleven-thirty.
LEADMALE:Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.
OTHERMALE:It's important that I have my privacy.
SUPMALE:Say a honey be tiptoeing up my crib.
LEADMALE:That's my business, not yours.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:No skinny-dipping.
OTHERFEMALE:You gotta promise me that same thing.
LEADMALE:Done.
SUPFEMALE:Well, son, I guess you got yourself a pool house.
SUPMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
LEADMALE:How come he gets the pool house and I'm stuck upstairs with the grieving widow? Another thing.
SUPMALE:Keep this person off my property or I'll shoot him.
SUPFEMALE:It's my property.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna inherit it after the big guy takes his bungee jump.
LEADFEMALE:Right, big guy? Well, he does have a point.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you what, why don't you two work it out.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, tallest one gets the bedroom.
LEADMALE:I need the big closet for my peacock suit.
OTHERMALE:So nice to have my family back.

LEADFEMALE:Look, you shut up.
SUPFEMALE:And wipe that damn milk mustache off.
