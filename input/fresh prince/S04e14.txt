LEADFEMALE:Why don't you put that down and come sit next to me.
SUPFEMALE:How's that? Everything cool?
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:It worked?
LEADFEMALE:Perfect, Branford, you hear? Good, I'm glad you liked it.
LEADMALE:So, Will, I'm off like a dirty shirt.
LEADMALE:Hey, peace with two fingers, man.
LEADFEMALE:Give J some for me, all right? There's definitely some perks to working for NBC.
OTHERMALE:I call the couch in the living room.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm sleeping on the couch.
LEADMALE:You can sleep under the couch, you squidgit.
SUPMALE:I'm sleeping on the couch.
LEADFEMALE:I said no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, grow up, you two.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you're staying here.
LEADMALE:Imagine calling an exterminator for a few harmless little crickets.
OTHERFEMALE:Supposed to be soothing, for God's sake.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think you understand, man.
LEADFEMALE:Now, these ain't them cute little Jiminy-wish-upon-a-star-type crickets.
SUPMALE:No, man.
LEADMALE:These are big, mean, nasty, bug-eyed take-over-the-human-race kind of crickets, man.
LEADMALE:You can borrow my makeup, but the key is subtlety.
LEADMALE:You want your date to think you stepped out of Vogue not a clown car.
SUPFEMALE:Date?
OTHERMALE:Tonight's the night.
LEADFEMALE:I go to the movies with Randy, remember? Randy? Randy who? Why wasn't I consulted about this? Stop pretending you don't know anything about it.
LEADFEMALE:You already gave permission.
LEADFEMALE:You cannot keep little girls from growing up.
LEADFEMALE:I can and I will.
LEADMALE:Ashley, come here.
LEADFEMALE:Look, now, seeing as how this is your first real date I think there's a couple things you need to know.
LEADMALE:Listen, if you're gonna hold the popcorn, make sure you hold it up in plain sight so when he go reaching for the bucket he don't miss, talking about, "Oops.
LEADFEMALE:" And stop at a gas station and make sure that tank is full.
SUPFEMALE:And if he tells you to pull his finger, don't do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, but it's just a little innocent date.
LEADMALE:Nothing's gonna happen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're right, nothing's gonna happen because I want you back here at 9:30.
LEADMALE:But the movie doesn't even end until 10.
OTHERMALE:Well, you can catch the end of it when it comes out on video.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy!
LEADMALE:Ashley, be back by 10:30.
OTHERMALE:Ten-thirty on the dot.
SUPFEMALE:Not 10:31, and that's in this house.
LEADFEMALE:Not on the porch, not parked out on the driveway.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me I'm gonna go check the video camera over the front door.
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy never gave Hilary a curfew.
LEADMALE:He was probably hoping she wouldn't come back.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that reminds me, I'm gonna be out late tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'm shooting a commercial for Casual Cup coffee.
SUPFEMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you get it? Well, the director said I reminded him of the coffee.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, he probably thought you was hot, creamy and rich.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, that's it.
LEADMALE:I was pretty sure I wasn't mountain-grown.
LEADFEMALE:Check please.
SUPFEMALE:I guess that leaves the house to just you and me.
LEADMALE:I can write my paper while you study for your midterm.
SUPMALE:It'll be nice and quiet.
SUPMALE:We can clear tables like the study center.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? I know how we can make it even more like the study center.
LEADFEMALE:I won't be here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll go run some ball.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get with you all later.
SUPMALE:But you told me you haven't studied yet.
SUPMALE:I haven't.
LEADMALE:Look, Carlton, I'm the king of cram.
OTHERMALE:All I need is three solid hours and I'm cool.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, let me tell you a little story about the grasshopper and the ant.
SUPMALE:I really don't feel like hearing about you and your little friends, okay? Just listen.
LEADMALE:See, the grasshopper goofed off while the ant worked hard storing up food for the winter.
LEADFEMALE:When the winter came, the ant had food but the grasshopper starved to death.
LEADFEMALE:You know what the moral of the story is? Yup, even if we were insects, I'd be bigger than you.
LEADFEMALE:All hail, the king of cram is about to take his throne.
LEADMALE:This is really sad, Will.
SUPMALE:It's 10:30 and you're just now cracking open that book.
SUPFEMALE:No, that's not true.
LEADMALE:I cracked it earlier when I had to write down this honey's phone number right next to the periodical table.
OTHERMALE:Do you wanna hear a little chemistry rhyme? No, not really.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Little Timmy took a drink But he will drink no more For what he thought was H2O Was H2SO4 That's how I remember the equation for sulphuric acid.
LEADMALE:Oh, look, look.
LEADMALE:I got one.
LEADFEMALE:I got one.
SUPFEMALE:Little Carlton was a boy Whose body was short and stumpy He never shut his mouth So I kicked his little rumpy Are you quite finished? Yup, all ready.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Carlton, that's really annoying.
LEADMALE:Oh, sorry, nervous habit.
LEADMALE:Sorry, nervous habit.
LEADMALE:Fool.
OTHERFEMALE:I am so sorry, Geoffrey, but if I put him down he cries even harder.
SUPMALE:So would you mind making up more formula? Mind? Madame, you woke me from a most marvelous dream.
LEADMALE:I haven't had one this good since I was strip searched at Dulles Airport.
LEADMALE:"Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry.
LEADFEMALE:" Honey, could you hold Nicky just a second? Wait, Aunt Viv, come on, l He stopped.
LEADMALE:Well, these fingers can work magic.
SUPMALE:Ain't that what the honeys tell me, huh?
LEADFEMALE:Okay, it's 10:37.
LEADFEMALE:I'm calling the police.
SUPMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:Police don't need your hysterical calls cluttering up their phone lines.
LEADMALE:They've got to catch real criminals.
LEADFEMALE:Like the murderous muggers and thugs that hang around movie theaters after hours.
SUPFEMALE:She's at the mall.
LEADMALE:She's not at the Pussycat Theater.
SUPMALE:I've never seen a mugger at the Pussycat Theater.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks.
SUPFEMALE:Can I speak to Ashley? She's not home from her date.
LEADMALE:She was supposed
SUPMALE:Daddy, I got it.
SUPMALE:Ashley, sweetheart, where are you? I'm upstairs in my room.
LEADFEMALE:I got home 20 minutes ago.
SUPMALE:Come on, hang up, I wanna talk to Connie about my date.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you about it tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:All right, sweetheart, good night.
LEADMALE:This is too easy.
LEADFEMALE:Are you ready? Don't I feel like an idiot? Ashley got home 20 minutes ago.
SUPFEMALE:She's upstairs talking on the phone.
OTHERMALE:Oh, really? That's a load off my mind.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll go to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Idiot.
SUPMALE:Maybe you can hold on to Nicky till he falls asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, Aunt Viv, listen, I can't.
OTHERMALE:I have to study.
OTHERFEMALE:You can't study if the baby is crying.
LEADMALE:It shouldn't take long.
LEADFEMALE:He hasn't slept all day.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You are getting sleepy.
LEADFEMALE:Very, very sleepy.
LEADFEMALE:Your eyelids are getting heavier.
SUPFEMALE:Your little head is drooping.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm back.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we should just try a bottle and a warm bath.
LEADMALE:Thought you'd never ask.
LEADMALE:The coffee commercial went great.
LEADFEMALE:First, I take a big sip of coffee, then I 
SUPMALE:Hi, I'm Hilary Banks, TV weather girl.
LEADMALE:When I don't have my head in the clouds I like to relax with a nice hot cup of Casual Cup coffee.
SUPMALE:So rich and fine, tastes just like you ground the beans yourself.
LEADMALE:First take, I said, " Tastes just like you found the beans yourself.
SUPFEMALE:" We did it again, I said, " When I don't have my head in the crowds.
SUPMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:So I did it again, and
LEADFEMALE:Hilary.
LEADMALE:How many takes did you do? Only 41.
LEADMALE:You think that would tire me out.
LEADMALE:But I'm more awake now than when I started.
SUPMALE:Stupid question, did you forget to spit after each take? Why would I spit it out? I'm nuts about coffee.
OTHERMALE:It's not made from nuts, it's from beans, so I guess I'm beans about coffee.
LEADMALE:Oh, gee, I'd love to stay and continue this fascinating monologue but I have to get some studying done.
LEADFEMALE:I've always wondered, if coffee's made from beans does that make it a vegetable? Why are you following me? Don't you have to work in the morning? Shouldn't you go sleep? I'd love to go to sleep, but I can't.
SUPMALE:I'm wide awake.
SUPFEMALE:See? Why don't you try doing something boring like reading the dictionary?
SUPMALE:Do you have one?
LEADMALE:Of course, I do.
SUPMALE:What do you think is propping up my makeup table? Finally.
LEADMALE:Carlton, I need your earplugs, man.
LEADMALE:Hey! Come on, man.
LEADMALE:Listen, I can't concentrate.
OTHERFEMALE:I read that same sentence like two million times.
OTHERFEMALE:If this test covers more 
SUPMALE:"Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry", I'm done.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe next time you should promise to yourself not to put things off until the last minute.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? You're right, man.
LEADFEMALE:And I've been wanting to squeeze your peezy little head like a grape all day long, and now is as good a time as any.
SUPMALE:Give me those earplugs.
LEADFEMALE:Give me your earplugs, man.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not sharing anything with you, mister.
LEADFEMALE:Who knows where those ears have been? That's it.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Get over here.
LEADMALE:Get over here.
LEADMALE:Get over.
SUPFEMALE:Time-out, Ashley's home.
OTHERMALE:Ashley? I thought she was supposed to be upstairs in bed.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you also thought Tupac Shakur was a Jewish holiday.
SUPFEMALE:Why is everybody still up? You know, you're making it very difficult for me to sneak in.
SUPMALE:Ashley, even you should know if you're trying to get past Uncle Phil you don't go through the kitchen.
LEADMALE:I guess I have a lot to learn.
LEADMALE:No, you learn too much.
LEADMALE:What you doing trying to run my phone scam for? Well, it worked.
LEADMALE:That's not the point.
LEADFEMALE:Look, the point is you don't realize the dangers that are lurking out there.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Ashley, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Guys are only after two things.
LEADFEMALE:I thought they were only after one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah, but they wanna do it more than once.
OTHERMALE:That noise is driving me crazy!
LEADMALE:Daddy's up? Get down, hide, hide.
SUPMALE:Get down.
LEADMALE:I can't stand all that chirping.
OTHERMALE:Geoffrey! Geoffrey! You rang? Where did you last put the insecticide? In your soup.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you're a grumpy Gus.
LEADFEMALE:I was having a most wonderful dream.
LEADMALE:Amazon women had just bound me with sinuous vines and were taunting me with tangelos.
OTHERMALE:What the hell is a tangelo? "'Tangelo', the fruit of a hybrid citrus tree that is a cross between certain varieties of grapefruit and tangerine.
LEADMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:No, thank you.
SUPMALE:I never knew how much fun I could have reading the dictionary.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's filled with all kinds of words.
SUPMALE:Big words, little words, abbreviations, common phrases.
LEADMALE:Can I look up a word for you?
LEADFEMALE:Go away.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's two words.
LEADFEMALE:This will take care of that little sucker.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, that's air freshener.
LEADMALE:Well, it's all we have.
SUPFEMALE:It might work.
OTHERMALE:Yes, perhaps the scent of sea breeze will recall some painful memory for him, and then he'll commit suicide.
LEADMALE:Quick, get in here! You were lucky Uncle Phil didn't catch you.
LEADMALE:Well, there's still time.
SUPMALE:What's that supposed to mean? Remember last year when I skipped school so I could pre-register for jury duty? And a little somebody snitched on me? Well, missy, the tables have finally turned.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Carlton, you're evil, man.
LEADMALE:Please, don't tell, I'll do anything.
SUPMALE:I'll clean your room.
SUPMALE:I'll polish your Star Trek figurines.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Now it's coming from the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Get down, get down! That cricket sounds like it's coming from two places at once.
SUPFEMALE:Must be the ventriloquist of the animal kingdom.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Dad, I think it's coming from this side of the counter.
LEADFEMALE:No, you know, Uncle Phil I think he's over here, the sneaky little bugger.
LEADFEMALE:I was right the first time.
LEADFEMALE:It's coming from the family room.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'll hunt that cricket if it's the last thing I do.
OTHERMALE:His head will make a fine trophy, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, you stink.
LEADMALE:You just go ahead outside.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go upstairs and get your pajamas.
LEADMALE:You can put them on and pretend you just came down for a snack.
OTHERFEMALE:My God, that bug isn't gonna get the best of me.
LEADMALE:Now I know how Captain Ahab felt when he was chasing Moby Dick.
LEADFEMALE:Between the two of you, the cricket is the whale? Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:How'd you like to be unemployed?
LEADMALE:What do you mean? "Unemployed.
SUPMALE:Out of work, jobless, not being used.
LEADFEMALE:I.
LEADFEMALE:E.
LEADFEMALE:, a person who does not have a job.
LEADMALE:" See, the answer is right at your fingertips.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Put those on.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, man, I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God, it's 1:30.
OTHERFEMALE:That's true.
LEADFEMALE:And it's a shame you always have to learn the hard way.
LEADMALE:As for me, I'm just finishing my paper.
SUPFEMALE:Can't stand it anymore.
LEADMALE:This chirping is boring a hole straight into my skull.
LEADMALE:There she blows, captain.
SUPFEMALE:By the table! By the table! I got him.
LEADFEMALE:I killed that little sucker.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, stop charging about like a rogue elephant.
SUPMALE:You're lucky you didn't wake Nicky up.
SUPFEMALE:My paper.
LEADMALE:Thirty pages of genius gone.
LEADMALE:Oh, well.
LEADMALE:I guess sometimes that little hardworking head just gets squashed into a little black spot, huh? That's funny, ain't it? Listen, you did all this hard work, I didn't do anything and we're both in the same boat.
OTHERMALE:Except that my paper was optional.
LEADMALE:Optional? Yeah, I was only doing it to get in good with the professor.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, I guess I'll just have to bring him some cupcakes.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:This is Philip Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, I haven't seen Randy and Ashley's been home since 10:30.
SUPMALE:Well, I'll call you back if she knows anything.
LEADFEMALE:That was Randy's father.
SUPFEMALE:Apparently, Randy decided to go somewhere else after dropping Ashley off.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God I have a responsible child.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, hey! Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, man.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? I'm gonna go ask Ashley if she knows where Randy went.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, you're not gonna just go up there and wake her up, are you? I mean, she could already have morning breath.
LEADFEMALE:Will, please.
OTHERMALE:Randy's father has a very serious problem.
OTHERMALE:If she did something like that, I'd throttle her.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:Throttling isn't anything like killing, is it? Not exactly.
SUPMALE:The second definition of throttle is, "To strangle, choke.
OTHERMALE:" Killing is the result of throttling.
LEADMALE:Either way, I think we're about to see a demonstration.
LEADMALE:Ashley's not in her room! I'm right here, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:I was just in the kitchen getting a snack.
LEADMALE:We were just in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:I mean the kitchen in the pool house.
LEADFEMALE:The pool house is being fumigated.
LEADFEMALE:Where am I? What am I doing down here? I must have been sleepwalking.
OTHERMALE:I better go back to my room.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley.
OTHERMALE:You've already lied once tonight.
LEADMALE:Let's not make it a habit.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, none of my other friends had a curfew.
LEADMALE:If I came home at 10:30, everyone would think I was a baby.
LEADFEMALE:You have to realize that I'm growing up.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, I am your father.
LEADMALE:It is my job to protect you.
LEADMALE:It's a job I refuse to quit, and at which I can't afford to fail.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I won't do it again.
LEADMALE:Of course, you won't, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:Because you're grounded for 10 years.
SUPMALE:Ten years? Or whenever you move out of the house.
OTHERMALE:Whatever comes first.
LEADMALE:That's not fair.
LEADFEMALE:Tell it to the judge.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's me.
LEADMALE:I killed the cricket.
LEADMALE:What a horrible death.
LEADFEMALE:But, Dad, you can't do that to me.
LEADMALE:Watch me.
OTHERFEMALE:But, no! Ding-dong, the cricket's dead Ashley's grounded Now you all go to bed Will, the house is all yours.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:"Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry.
SUPMALE:" Come on, Dad, 10 years? The Menendez brothers will be free before I am.
LEADFEMALE:The Menendez brothers got home on time.
LEADFEMALE:Will, wake up.
LEADMALE:Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry.
SUPMALE:Will, it's 8:00.
LEADMALE:You don't have much time to get changed and get to school.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:I never even got past the first page.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what are you gonna do?
LEADMALE:Carlton, I'm gonna fail.
LEADFEMALE:Hate to say, I told you so.
LEADFEMALE:So how'd the test go, Will? I got an 85.
LEADFEMALE:What? But you didn't even study.
LEADMALE:How could you have learned everything you had to know about chemistry? Well, the only chemistry I needed was between me and the honey in the next seat.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm saying? You have a good winter.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a second, Will.
SUPFEMALE:You're not really gonna let people think you cheated? Yeah, I know.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Ready?
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:So how'd the test go, Will?
LEADFEMALE:I failed.
SUPMALE:See, Will, you can't put studying off until the last minute.
OTHERMALE:I know, I know, you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what? I'm gonna run to the library right now.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm not leaving until I learn everything to know about chemistry.
LEADMALE:That's the spirit.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Hilary Banks, TV weather girl.
OTHERMALE:When I don't have my head in the clouds I like to relax with a nice hot cup of
SUPFEMALE:Cup of hot coffee.
SUPFEMALE:From the top.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at first I said Oh, shoot.
LEADMALE:Damn it.
SUPMALE:Then what did you say?
SUPMALE:I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:And the next take I said, " When I don't have my" Oh, shoot, shoot.
LEADMALE:And the next thing I said
LEADFEMALE:Hilary how many takes did you do? Only 41.
SUPFEMALE:You think that would tire me out.
LEADMALE:But I'm more awake now than when we started.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna pass out, you know.
LEADFEMALE:
