I used to get up every morning at dawn and run through the park.
You used to jog? That was a shortcut to the diner where she worked.
The one sure way that I could tell that I was in love was that You know those stupid, sappy love songs I used to make fun of, you know? Well, they started making sense.

I'll just go eat some celery.
Will, I am so surprised at you.
Standing around here watching your uncle dig himself into an early grave.
Yeah, you filthy stinking enabler.
Hey, look, wait a minute, I got other things on my mind right now.
I ain't got no time for buns of brass and brains of bricks.
He needs help.
You wouldn't talk that way if you walked just one mile in your uncle's shoes.
My uncle can't walk one mile in my uncle's shoes.
Listen, why don't you go haunt one of your big-boned friends? Big-boned? Okay, I'm gonna show you big-boned.
Looks like Lorena Bobbitt got to this suit, huh?  Let's just call this part of your family education kit because you know why? In every group, there's always an insensitive boob.
We must be lucky, we got two.
Ha, ha.
This dumb suit ain't gonna prove nothing.
I could wear this thing for a week.
Oh, really? Why don't you just go out for one day? Go out in public and see what it feels like to look like this.
Go ahead.
Pbbt.
Look, this thing will be a breeze.
 Lady I'm your knight in shining armor And I love you You have made me what I am And I am yours Will, are you all right?
Yeah, why?
You were just singing "Lady" to a melon.
Oh, that's how I check them for ripeness.
Will, you've been acting really weird.
 That's funny? Y'all think that's funny? You think that's funny, huh? Whoo.
You ain't had no home training, that's what your problem is.
Whoo.
Potato chips? What about Susan Powter? Listen, I'm as health conscious as the next person but when she threw out the strawberry Pop-Tarts, she crossed the line.
Which reminds me, I'll be right back.
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.
I'm retaining water.
Well, well, look who's here, Lisa and friend.

Oh, we need paper towels and a can opener.
Is that fat guy following us? What fat guy? Come on.
Excuse me, is there some reason why you're following us?
Will?
Well, it ain't Fat Albert.
What are you doing? What am I doing? What are? Oh.
What am I doing? What are you doing? I don't believe you, girl.
I thought we had something real.
Here I am singing stupid love songs about you and thinking about you all the time.
Writing your name on every book I own.
And you stepping out on me in a grocery store.
You know how ridiculous that makes me look? Huh? Do you? Will, for the umpteenth time, I told you, Dana and I are just friends.
Oh, oh.
Well, let me tell you about your slimy little friend.
He's just trying to gain your confidence, so he'll know when you're most vulnerable.
And that's when he's gonna pounce on you like a cheetah on a rabbit.
And you believe that? Believe it? I've done it.
Hey, man, you've got me all wrong.
Hey, hey, hey.
Look here, dude this is between moi and her.
We don't need you.
I'm out of here, Lis.
You just hold on a second.
What? Hold on what? If you are gonna have a relationship with me you are gonna have to trust me.
The same way that I trust you not to date anybody else.
Oh, yeah, well, I did date somebody else.
Oh, you did?
Yes, I did, last night.
One of my friends.
She was ready and willing to do anything I wanted to do.
Except we couldn't do what I wanted to do.
All I wanted to do was be with you.
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
And do you know why?
No, why? Because I love you.
What did you just say? I said I love you.
Baby.

So let's just say I wanted to do an exercise tape.
That would bring me, what, 10 million? Though, I wouldn't actually have to touch fat people, would I? Could they just be electronically morphed in later? Philip, as much as I'd like to hang around and help you reach your ideal weight, I can't.
I gotta go, because I can't stand being around you.
Ooh, you have such a grating personality.
That's my boy.
Ha-ha-ha.
Come on, everyone, tuna melts on me.
Come on.
Hey, what's up, G?
Hey, Master William.
Guess what, Geoffrey.
We saw Lisa at the grocery store and Will used the L-word.
"Leather"? No, "love.
" Tomato, tomato.
That's right.
I'm telling you, I made the leap, man.
First time in my life, I'm a one-woman man.
Well, you know what you have to do? Repeat after me.
Repeat after me.
Sorry.
I accept this gift and all the responsibilities it carries.
I accept this gift and all the responsibilities it carries.
I'll never betray it.
I'll never betray it.
I'll never abandon it.
I'll never abandon it.
I will never reveal the secrets which it contains.
I will never reveal the secrets which it contains.
Hold out your hands.
Carlton I give you my chicktionary.
