SUPMALE:Are you busy, Will? No, not really.
SUPMALE:So, what's up? Well, they're kind of having cheerleader tryouts at school and I sort of thought about going.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, that's kind of a stupid idea, so I sort of blew it off.
LEADMALE:Oh well, I think that being a cheerleader is a kind of, you know, a sort of a good idea.
SUPMALE:Do you think I have a chance?
SUPFEMALE:Of course you do.
LEADMALE:Yo, back in Philly the girls had this cheer, right that, yo, really got the crowd hyped.
LEADFEMALE:They used to be like this.

LEADMALE:I will not be 40 until 7:08 tonight.
LEADFEMALE:One hour later you and your feet are gonna be at the world's greatest birthday party.
LEADMALE:Oh, Philip, you've gone to so much trouble.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so sorry I'm such a grouch.
LEADMALE:Baby, that's okay.
LEADMALE:Nobody's thrilled about getting not young.
SUPMALE:But look what you've accomplished.
LEADMALE:You're a full professor, you've got three great kids and a husband who's tall, dark, and loaded.

LEADFEMALE:Well, what did you get her?
LEADFEMALE:This is Mom-proof.
OTHERFEMALE:Any professor would be proud to carry this whether she's wearing a dress or a G-string.
LEADFEMALE:'Course, with that second outfit, attendance would shoot up.
LEADFEMALE:Among other things.
LEADFEMALE:Where's your mom? She hasn't come down since we got home from school.

SUPMALE:Is this Advanced Jazz?
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Then I'm in the right place.
LEADMALE:So, anyway, last summer I was in A Chorus Line and Oklahoma.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I was in West Side Story, Gypsy, and My Fair Lady.

LEADMALE:You're gonna go to that audition and you're gonna give it everything you've got.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Philip.

OTHERFEMALE:You know, Uncle Phil most husbands wouldn't want their wives running off half naked to a bunch of bulging, masculine dancers that's gonna be grabbing them and lifting them in places their husbands forgot existed.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's what trust in a marriage is all about.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian! Excuse me.

LEADMALE:Are you too tired for one more dance? Oh, baby, not with you.
SUPMALE:Philip! Maybe I should sit this one out.
OTHERMALE:An even better idea.
