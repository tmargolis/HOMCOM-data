LEADMALE:Good evening, sir.
SUPMALE:How was your day? Being a lawyer stinks, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:No matter how good a job you do your clients still compare you to Harry Hamlin.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:The resemblance is quite striking.
LEADMALE:Come on, baby.
LEADMALE:Get on the soul train.
LEADMALE:I love this kind of dancing, it makes you feel so young.
LEADMALE:Doesn't that golden oldie take you way back? That was Papa's Got a Brand New Bag recorded 25 long years ago by James Brown the Granddaddy of Soul.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be right back after this message from Geritol.
LEADFEMALE:And the Fresh Prince drives down the court.
SUPMALE:He stops, he pops, and it's Yes! No.
OTHERMALE:Will, don't play inside.
OTHERMALE:You might break something.
LEADMALE:Or something might break you.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have a hoop outside.
OTHERMALE:And Jazz is getting tired of standing on the second-floor balcony holding a pool skimmer.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Prince, man.
LEADMALE:I know a playground in my neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:'Course we can only play half-court.
LEADFEMALE:They use the other end to sell stolen appliances.
LEADFEMALE:Dope.
OTHERMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Hold on.
LEADFEMALE:We don't want you playing there.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a perfectly good basketball court at the school, where Carlton is practicing.
LEADMALE:Carlton's on the basketball team? How do they do? They try hard, but to tell you the truth, they haven't won a game so far.
SUPMALE:Aunt Viv, don't you think if we went down to watch them practice Carlton would be a little embarrassed?
SUPMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Good try! Man, these guys need help.
SUPFEMALE:Help? They need a telethon.
LEADFEMALE:He threw that ball to me.
LEADMALE:I'm on the other team.
LEADFEMALE:I'm supposed to try and get it.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to be rude about it.
LEADFEMALE:You two, make up right now.
SUPFEMALE:All right, men.
LEADFEMALE:Another brilliant warm-up.
LEADFEMALE:Frankly, I think there's been way too much emphasis over the years on putting the ball actually through the hoop.
OTHERMALE:So let's practice some passing.
LEADMALE:Coach Smiley, may I have a minute?
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:All right, men, take five.
LEADFEMALE:Headmaster Thorvald, good afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:This is Barry O'Donnell.
LEADFEMALE:He's a distinguished alumnus and I'm encouraging him to donate money for a new gymnasium.
SUPFEMALE:Coach.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think the team's prospects are this year? For what? For winning.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:What about those two? You've been holding out on me.
SUPFEMALE:Now those are players.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to meet them.
LEADMALE:Gentlemen.
LEADFEMALE:Not you.
SUPFEMALE:You two, come on over.
LEADMALE:I want you to meet somebody.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Thorvald, straight up, about that fire 
LEADMALE:I don't know who pulled it.
SUPFEMALE:Forget about it.
LEADMALE:I'd like you to meet two of Bel-Air Academy's newest recruits.
SUPMALE:This is Will Smith and Your name is Jazz, man.
OTHERMALE:Of course, Mr.
LEADMALE:Jazzman.
LEADFEMALE:Will, where have you been hiding yourself? What do you mean? During gym class? No.
OTHERMALE:I just wondered, how'd you two men like to join the school team? Man, I ain't even in this school.
SUPMALE:I'm willing to look past that if you are.
SUPFEMALE:Coach, he can't be on the team if he's not in school here.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:How about you, Will? I was just trying to find somewhere to play.
LEADFEMALE:You join this team, you can play here anytime you want.
LEADMALE:No, I don't think so.
SUPMALE:It'll look good on a college application.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, Coach.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll give you my car.
LEADMALE:Okay, this is gonna be fun.
SUPMALE:The coach asked me to go through the playbook with you.
LEADMALE:Your team doesn't need a playbook.
OTHERFEMALE:They need a prayer book.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, pay attention.
SUPMALE:This is you and this is me.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, you got it wrong already.
LEADMALE:It's more like this.
LEADMALE:This is me.
SUPMALE:And this is you.
LEADFEMALE:Fair enough.
LEADFEMALE:This is my brain and this is your brain.
LEADMALE:This is my handsome face.
LEADMALE:And this is your ugly little Frankenstein face.
SUPFEMALE:Give me that chalk.
LEADMALE:Come on, man, beat it.
LEADMALE:Give it.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley! Here, Ashley, finally there's an adult in the room.
LEADMALE:Guys, I'm trying to study.
SUPMALE:What are you doing?
LEADMALE:Keep away from Carlton.
SUPMALE:Over here.
LEADFEMALE:Children, please! What if your parents witnessed this horseplay?
LEADMALE:Give me that chalk immediately.
SUPFEMALE:Keep it away from Carlton! Keep away from Carlton and Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:You've met your match, Master William.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, get off me, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey? May I get you something, sir? No, thank you.
LEADMALE:Will, how many times do I have to tell you that this is our living room? How'd you like it if I went into your room and started throwing chalk around? I'd be devastated.
SUPMALE:Out.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you do that?
SUPFEMALE:What? You singled Will out.
LEADMALE:They were all goofing around.
LEADMALE:He was the mastermind.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me.
OTHERMALE:I just wish you'd be nicer to Will.
OTHERMALE:He joined the basketball team and you haven't said a word about it.
SUPMALE:Give him some credit.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I see your point.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I think it's a great opportunity for you two to find some common ground.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, you were kind of a star athlete in college.
LEADMALE:"Kind of a star athlete"? All right.
SUPMALE:You were a football god.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Who knows, it might do him some good.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing like a little organized sport to straighten a guy out.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:It did wonders for Pete Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, I appreciate you coming tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're not a big sports fan.
LEADMALE:Mother, please, it's Will's first game with the team.
SUPMALE:I'm proud of him.
LEADFEMALE:If I didn't show up to support him, what kind of cousin would I be? lt'll be three hours well spent.
LEADMALE:Three hours? Five, four, three, two, one! I'm going to Disneyland! You did all right! All right, men, good game on Friday.
OTHERMALE:But we can do even better this week.
SUPMALE:So let's go over some plays.
LEADMALE:Sorry I'm late, Coach! Sorry isn't good enough, Cartwell.
OTHERMALE:I was under the assumption
LEADFEMALE:You made an assumption.
OTHERMALE:Don't make an assumption because you will be an ass and the ump will shun you.
LEADFEMALE:Cartwell, after practice, you give me 10 laps around the school.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Coach.
OTHERMALE:Now let's take a look at this play.
OTHERMALE:What's up? It's my squad.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry I'm late, Coach.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry about it, Smith.
LEADMALE:You just take it easy.
SUPFEMALE:Save that energy for the game.
LEADFEMALE:But I was late, and I have to run 10 laps.
SUPMALE:Twenty laps.
LEADFEMALE:Now, shut up.
LEADFEMALE:First play.
LEADMALE:Guard inbounds to the center.
LEADFEMALE:Center moves down court, fakes right, passes to the forward.
SUPMALE:What does he do?
LEADFEMALE:Passes to Will?
SUPFEMALE:Bingo.
LEADMALE:Second play.
SUPMALE:Jump ball.
OTHERFEMALE:Ball is tipped to the center.
LEADFEMALE:Center shuttles to the guard, back to the center who hits to the forward and over to baseline.
LEADFEMALE:What does he do?
LEADMALE:Passes to Will.
SUPFEMALE:Yes! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Number three.
SUPFEMALE:Forward inbounds from here bounce pass to the guard, who zips it back to the forward under the net.
LEADFEMALE:What does he do? If he's clear, he goes for the lay-up.
LEADFEMALE:Otherwise, back to the guard.
SUPMALE:Okay, Banks, not paying attention? Ten laps.
LEADMALE:Not paying attention? Look at Will.
SUPFEMALE:He's asleep.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind your own business, Banks.
LEADFEMALE:That's 20 laps.
LEADMALE:NBA superstar Isaiah Thomas is used to having things his own way.
LEADMALE:But not today.
SUPMALE:How do you do it, Prince? Easy, Isaiah.
OTHERMALE:Air Fresh gym shoes.
LEADFEMALE:Just pass it to Will.
LEADMALE:Hi, pumpkin.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, love.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Is Will home yet? He's outside playing basketball with Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Now let me down.
LEADFEMALE:Will, would you come in here a minute, please? What's going on? I've been thinking about what you said about us finding some common ground.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:The firm has season tickets for the Laker game, so I put in for them.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we could go.
OTHERFEMALE:Philip, what a great idea.
SUPMALE:He'll love it.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, thanks for putting the hoop up on the garage.
SUPMALE:It's really helping my lay-ups, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Come on out, I'll show you.
LEADMALE:Sounds great, Carlton, but in a minute, okay?
LEADMALE:You wanted to talk to me?
OTHERMALE:I have two tickets to the Lakers game.
LEADMALE:How'd you like to come?
LEADMALE:Word, I'm with that.
LEADMALE:Give the Laker girls an opportunity to check out a future Laker.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADMALE:Son, you want to show me those lay-ups? Maybe a little bit later.
OTHERMALE:Actually, I've got some studying to do.
LEADFEMALE:After dinner?
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, want to shoot a few hoops?
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Did I tell you how my high-school team won the state championship? I made the final basket right at the buzzer.
SUPMALE:That's decent.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, can I ask you something?
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:How was I in the basketball game last Friday? You were great.
LEADMALE:You didn't make any baskets or anything but you looked cute in your uniform.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's great how you don't get it too sweaty.
LEADMALE:I guess it's 'cause you don't run too fast.
LEADFEMALE:Smart move.
LEADMALE:Did Dad mention me during the game? He did turn around to the guy behind him once and 
LEADMALE:"Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:That's my son you're talking about.
LEADMALE:" It's Will, isn't it? No.
SUPFEMALE:It's not.
SUPMALE:Talk to me.
LEADMALE:Look, it's ridiculous to compare yourself to Will.
SUPFEMALE:You're captain of the debate team, a straight "A" student you're leader of the glee club.
LEADFEMALE:So what if Will's good at basketball? Thanks, Hilary.
OTHERMALE:That means a lot to me.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, if that basket were two feet lower you'd be just as good as he is.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, I'm surprised you decided to come.
LEADFEMALE:You're not a basketball fan.
LEADFEMALE:True, madam, but I have found that any game can be made interesting if you put a little money on it.
LEADFEMALE:You bet on this game?
LEADFEMALE:$50 says Bel-Air wins it.
LEADMALE:Who'd take that bet? You rang, beautiful? Jazz, you bet against Will? Yeah.
LEADMALE:He screws up, I'm loaded.
OTHERMALE:Students, parents, alumni, let me introduce our beloved coach Herb Smiley.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I see a lot of new faces out here tonight faces I didn't see when we were losing.
SUPFEMALE:People who did not support this team in its darkest hour.
LEADMALE:All I can say is, I don't blame you one bit.
LEADFEMALE:Half the time, I didn't want to be there.
LEADFEMALE:And quite frankly, I usually ducked out a little early.
LEADMALE:But that's all gonna change tonight because of our new superstar Will Smith.
LEADMALE:With seven seconds remaining, Bel-Air is down by two points and calls a time out.
LEADFEMALE:Our only hope for winning this game is by shooting a three-pointer.
LEADFEMALE:So here's the plan.
LEADFEMALE:Cartwell, you inbound to Hunt.
LEADFEMALE:Hunt, what do you do?
SUPFEMALE:Shoot for the three-pointer? Very funny.
LEADFEMALE:That'll be 10 laps, chowderhead.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the right answer?
LEADFEMALE:Pass it to Will.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Now, let's do it.
OTHERMALE:One, two, three, Bel-Air! Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:Yes! Thirty, forty, fifty!
SUPFEMALE:There.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, man.
LEADFEMALE:Nice doing business with you.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Jazz, the World Snooker Championship is on the sports station in a few moments.
LEADFEMALE:Would you care to place a wager?
LEADMALE:I don't know anything about snooker.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you everything you need to know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to shoot some hoops.
LEADFEMALE:If you'd like to practice some new and more spectacular ways to lose a game, please join me.
LEADFEMALE:Put that down.
LEADFEMALE:Put what down?
SUPMALE:My basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Your basketball? Excuse me, your name is Spalding? Dad gave it to me for my birthday three years ago.
SUPMALE:It's my ball.
SUPFEMALE:Give it.
LEADMALE:In a bad mood? You should be the happiest guy in the world.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Why? 'Cause you got out of that locker room alive.
LEADMALE:Man, Coach Smiley was upset.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you're lucky that was just a starter's pistol.
SUPMALE:I was trying to win the game.
LEADFEMALE:No, you were trying to be the hero.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody else can be the hero besides you all the time.
SUPMALE:Let's get something straight.
LEADFEMALE:I been here for two months.
LEADFEMALE:I been getting yelled at at home screamed at at school, I been sent to detention, grounded threatened with expulsion on almost a daily basis.
LEADMALE:I finally do something I get credit for, and you can't take it.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, I got news for you.
LEADMALE:I ain't about to sell myself short just to make you feel better.
SUPMALE:Grow up! You should grow up, hogging the ball every chance you get!
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't hogging nothing.
SUPMALE:You were! Okay, you two.
SUPMALE:What's this all about? Carlton doesn't want me to use his basketball 'cause he's afraid I might get it in the basket.
OTHERMALE:Will you two start acting your age? What I saw on that basketball court tonight was a disgrace.
SUPMALE:If I'd made that last shot, I'd be the hero right now.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, the fact that you missed the shot wasn't a disgrace.
SUPFEMALE:You stole the ball from a member of your own team.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and if you'd passed it to me, we would've won.
LEADMALE:You would? Of course, I can make that shot with my eyes closed
SUPMALE:and one hand tied behind my back.
OTHERFEMALE:Was that gonna be your next trick? 'Cause you were like a one-man circus out there.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, the coach told the team to pass the ball to me.
SUPFEMALE:Did he tell you to woof at the crowd kiss the cheerleader between plays, and shoot the ball backwards? No, I came up with all that fly stuff myself.
SUPMALE:That wasn't fly, Will.
LEADMALE:A real star plays with the team.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should think about that.
LEADMALE:Carlton, can I ask you something? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:When you stole the ball from Will and tried to make that Hail Mary shot what were you thinking about?
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Really? I guess I was just thinking of the first game Will won and how you ran out on the court and you were so proud of him.
LEADMALE:I guess I thought it would be cool if it happened to me.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, you don't have to be a hero.
LEADMALE:I'm proud that you're out there giving it all you got.
LEADMALE:You started coming to games when Will joined the team.
LEADMALE:I wanted to support him.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't come when it was just me.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to come to everything you do.
SUPMALE:I always come to your tennis games, to your debate matches your glee club concerts.
LEADMALE:Frankly, keeping up with your extracurricular activities is a 24-hour-a-day job.
SUPMALE:Did I mention I was elected editor of the yearbook? I didn't mean to slight you.
LEADMALE:But I can't slight Will, either.
LEADMALE:His mother is 3,000 miles away.
SUPFEMALE:He needs a cheering section as much as you do.
LEADMALE:Maybe more.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna head up.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, son.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Dad.
SUPMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Here.
SUPFEMALE:
