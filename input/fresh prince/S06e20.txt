SUPMALE:You running away from home, you gonna need some food.
LEADFEMALE:You know, bums, they don't like to share.
LEADMALE:Here you go, a little grub.

LEADMALE:And here's a few bucks, you know, in case something jump off out there.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:You good to go, little bro.
OTHERMALE:Aren't you gonna try and stop me? Try to stop you? No, man, with you gone that's more food for me, you know.
SUPMALE:Plus, I get to keep your turtle and that banging little bike you got.
SUPFEMALE:My turtle and my bike? I mean, somebody gotta claim all that stuff.
SUPMALE:All right, I'll stay.
SUPMALE:But not because I'm scared.
SUPFEMALE:Not because you're taking my stuff.
LEADMALE:And not because of that reverse psychology you tried to use on me.
LEADMALE:Well, then why you gonna stay? I'm 5, you dork.
LEADMALE: Yee-ha! Giddyup, giddyup.
LEADMALE:  Hey, come on, G.
SUPMALE:It's your turn.
OTHERMALE:Get on.
SUPFEMALE:Get on.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.

LEADFEMALE:What, you some kind of freak, boy? Hey, G, we're going down to the race track today, man.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna put a couple of ones on a bet? Well, I'm not much of a gambler, Master William, but since you're going back wheel the eighth with the one on top of the two, three and six.
LEADMALE:And in the fifth, par tri the three eight with the two and five.
LEADFEMALE:You got yourself a secret life going, don't you, G? Will, which one do you think your friend Frank will like best? This one? Or this one? God, I wanna get into the New York School of Performing Arts so bad.
LEADMALE:Well, Ash, I don't think they pick their students by what they're wearing.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think he'll recommend me? Not if you keep spinning around like that, girl.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody, look.
LEADMALE:Wednesday Bingo is running out of post position five.
LEADFEMALE:Not post position five!  That's his favorite position.
SUPFEMALE:It's the same position he had when he won his first race.
LEADMALE:I still remember him standing in that winner's circle Iooking up to me as if to say: "Tsk, tsk.
LEADMALE:This one's for you, little man.
SUPMALE:"  You sure his tail wasn't up in the air at the time? Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Mommy, wish me luck.
OTHERFEMALE:I really wanna get into that school in New York.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, good luck, honey.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:New York.
SUPMALE:Isn't that a bit of a drive every morning?  How cute, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd have to live there, of course.
SUPMALE:Of course you would, muffin.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, it's always been my dream to send my underage daughter off to New York unsupervised.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that every parent's dream? Daddy, you'll warm to the idea.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, just remember that the road to New York goes through me.
LEADMALE:What, that be like a six-lane highway? Well, Mom, you're okay with it, right? She feels the same way I do, don't you, darling? There's plenty of time to discuss this later.
SUPFEMALE:Huh?
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, Mom.

LEADMALE:Hilary, one of them has to win.
OTHERFEMALE:I know and it doesn't matter which one.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it great? Where's Carlton? Oh, he's in the stables with the jockeys.
LEADMALE:He's never been the tallest person in a room before.

SUPFEMALE:Will says you wanna go to the School for the Performing Arts.
LEADFEMALE:More than anything.
SUPFEMALE:That's where I learned to be a director.
LEADMALE:Really? You studied directing there? No, acting, but I sucked.
LEADFEMALE:My old acting partner is head of the school now.
SUPMALE:Guess he couldn't even direct, huh?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're smart.
SUPMALE:You should produce.
LEADFEMALE:Come by the office tomorrow.
LEADMALE:We'll call him up.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That'd be great.

LEADMALE:I'll be there at noon.
LEADMALE:Feel free to have a bagel while you wait.
SUPMALE:Some short stack told me to get out of the paddock area.
LEADMALE:God, that feels great to say.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh.
SUPFEMALE:ANNOUNCER: They're at the gate.
OTHERFEMALE:The flag is up.
LEADFEMALE:And they're off.

LEADFEMALE:ANNOUNCER: At the wire, it's Rest Darling by a nose.
SUPMALE:Lilac Lady, second and Daddy's Best, third.
OTHERMALE:Wednesday Bingo is taking a nap.
LEADFEMALE:You just wait till he wakes up.
LEADFEMALE:Shoo! Will, Frank said he'd help me get into the School of Performing Arts.
LEADMALE:Do you think he meant it? Ashley, how many times do I have to tell you? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:Really, Will, do you think he will? Ashley, the man is in show business, he wouldn't lie.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Look, he'll help you.

LEADMALE:He looks so sad.
OTHERMALE:Aww.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, he's so cute.

LEADFEMALE:Now, look, just watch some TV and take your mind off of it, all right? MALE VOICE : Hello.
LEADMALE:I'm Mister Ed.
LEADMALE: You bastard! Wow, Carlton seems pretty upset.
LEADFEMALE:I think what he needs is a refreshing pick-me-up beverage that's not too sweet and not too heavy.
SUPMALE:What? You know my motto.
LEADMALE:If you're a woman on the go like me, things can get rough.
SUPMALE:And when they do, don't sweat, drink Jet.
LEADFEMALE:Jet cola that is.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:You been sipping that gin and juice.
LEADFEMALE:VIVIAN: Hi, guys.
SUPMALE:Oh, Ashley, look.

OTHERMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:I don't need a mint.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, I went to see Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Roberts about the High School of the Performing Arts and he offered me a commercial for Jet cola.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's great! Let's go tell your dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE: This don't seem that hard.
LEADFEMALE:You know my motto.
SUPFEMALE:If you're a woman on the go like me, things can get rough.
SUPFEMALE:And when they do, don't sweat, y'all.
OTHERFEMALE:Drink Jet.
LEADMALE:Jet cola that is.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, be a woman on the go.
LEADFEMALE:Leave so I can vacuum.
LEADMALE:Hey, Frank, what's up, man?
LEADMALE:Hi, Will.
SUPMALE:How's it going? All right.

OTHERMALE:Let's get this rolling.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Frank.
LEADMALE:I got to tell you, man, it's guys like you make life worth living.
LEADMALE:Bringing all these beautiful women to us during all our favorite programs.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you ought to have a billboard with your face on it.
LEADMALE:You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:That's a wrap!
SUPFEMALE:I am so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:There is no way I'm gonna let her parade around on some beach hawking Jet cola in nothing but a skimpy bikini.
SUPFEMALE:And showing that can all over national TV.
LEADMALE:And I ain't talking about the soda.
LEADMALE:HILARY: Carlton, this is crazy.
SUPMALE:Hilary, we had no choice.
LEADMALE:We needed a place till we find him a permanent home.
LEADMALE:What's gonna happen if Dad finds out there's a horse in the back yard? He'll blame Will like he always does.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you "hi, Daddy" me.
LEADMALE:Just when were you planning on telling me about your little soft-core drink commercial? You.
SUPFEMALE:We would've found out eventually.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, even though they're not showing that much of her face.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:You're both being hypocrites.
SUPMALE:You sit there glued to the set anytime Baywatch comes on.
LEADMALE:That's only because I have trouble sleeping and the sound of the waves gently caressing the shore helps relax me.
LEADFEMALE: Nice cover.
LEADMALE:Nice cov Ashley, you're not doing this commercial.
LEADFEMALE: Mom, can you talk to him? I'm afraid your father feels very strongly about this.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't quit the commercial.
LEADMALE:How's it look if I walk out on the person who's gonna give me the recommendation? I don't care.
SUPMALE:This is more important.
SUPFEMALE:And you're not going to New York, either.
LEADMALE:What about what I want? Doesn't that matter? No.
SUPFEMALE: No, no, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:I am telling you, Uncle Phil, I was there and that commercial was nothing but a disgusting, gratuitous display of Just call it what it is.
LEADFEMALE:Smut.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think I was too rough on Ashley?
LEADFEMALE:Are you tripping? You are the leader of the pack.
LEADFEMALE:It is your right.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Scratch that.
LEADMALE:It is your duty as a male to assert your dominance.
LEADMALE:There, I said it, your dominance.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Because your Aunt Vivian wasn't as supportive of my approach.
SUPFEMALE:Your approach? Man, I got one thing to say about your approach: Woof, woof, woof.
LEADFEMALE:You are the king of the jungle, Mufasa.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, I am.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I am.
LEADMALE:You are the ruler of all that you survey.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:You will be obeyed!
LEADMALE:I will be obeyed!
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Hi, sweetie, you look awfully pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I showed her.
LEADFEMALE:You ain't nothing but Simba.
LEADFEMALE:  What's up, Ash?   What you watching? You know, I have no idea what got into the big guy! You got into him.
LEADFEMALE:You're the rat that dimed me out.
LEADMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute, Ashley.
OTHERFEMALE:Now that hurts.
LEADMALE:I'm offended by that characterization.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You don't like rat.
SUPMALE:How about snake? Weasel? Doody-head? Don't be calling me no doody-head.
SUPFEMALE:You know how much going to the School of Performing Arts means to me and how much that commercial would help.
LEADMALE:That commercial was degrading.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? It was? Which part? The part where I'm in clothes driving the car? The part where I'm in sweats drinking the cola? The part where I'm Rollerblading? No.
LEADMALE:All you focused on were the seven seconds I was in a bathing suit playing volleyball.
SUPFEMALE:I play volleyball in a bathing suit all the time.
SUPMALE:Am I degrading myself? I didn't know about all them other parts.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
SUPMALE:Because you didn't ask.
LEADMALE:All that mattered to you and Dad was your narrow-minded maleness.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this job may not be my dream job but, regardless, it's my dream.
SUPFEMALE:You and Dad have nothing to do with it.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what? I should just go and do it anyway.
LEADMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Now Now, I realize you're excited and you're a little upset but Uncle Phil is a big man.
LEADFEMALE:He's a very big man with a very short fuse.
SUPFEMALE:Bad combination.
OTHERFEMALE:Very bad combination.
SUPFEMALE:Goodbye.
OTHERFEMALE:Bad talk.
LEADFEMALE:Very bad talk.
SUPMALE:Here you go.
SUPFEMALE:Nick, have I ever kept you from achieving your dreams? Not many.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you wouldn't call me narrow-minded, would you? You just don't get it, do you? I'm 5, you dork.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
LEADMALE:I should just be talking to Ashley.
SUPMALE:Is she here? Nope.
LEADMALE:She's at the commercial.
SUPFEMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:What? Whoa! Ha-ha-ha! Hey.
SUPMALE:Well, Uncle Phil, man.
SUPMALE:How long you been standing there? You know, you're a light stepper for a big fella.
LEADFEMALE:What did you just say, Nicky? Ashley's at the commercial.
LEADMALE:Oh, how could she do this, huh? In direct defiance of The king of the jungle? We'll see about this.
LEADMALE:What? Now, Uncle Phil, calm down, man.
OTHERFEMALE:All right? It ain't that serious.
OTHERFEMALE:Big man, short fuse.
SUPMALE:Bad combination.
SUPFEMALE:Well, she's not here, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:We just got here.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know, Uncle Phil, as I look around you know, the level of nakedness isn't as high as I had previously assumed.
SUPMALE:Will, you know, ever since we've left the house you seemed a little distracted.
LEADMALE:You know, what ever happened to that: Woof, woof, woof.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, heh.
LEADMALE:Well, that's still there, man.
LEADFEMALE: Woof, woof, woof.
LEADMALE:You know, Uncle Phil, I don't even think that Ashley's here! PHIL: Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? What are you doing here? You defied me.
LEADMALE:Now, you go get your clothes and you come with me right now.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, l
OTHERFEMALE:I don't wanna hear it.
LEADMALE:Coming down here and doing this commercial after I expressly forbade it.
SUPFEMALE:I just quit the commercial.
OTHERFEMALE:Well Uh You should be ashamed of yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:Not trusting Ashley.
LEADMALE:I knew she would never do it.
SUPFEMALE:Mama knows, child.
LEADMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:Shut up, Will.
OTHERMALE:Listen, I'm taking over.
LEADMALE:I need to know where your wardrobe is.
SUPMALE:Um, it's in the dressing room in the back.
OTHERFEMALE:Too bad your daddy won't let you do the commercial.
LEADFEMALE:Better off leaving it to the big girls.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo-hoo-hoo.
LEADMALE:Whoo-hoo.
SUPFEMALE:Little cat in you, huh, girl? Little leopard skirt on.
SUPFEMALE: You know, let's just go.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
SUPFEMALE:You better make it home before Saved by the Bell starts.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, miss.
LEADFEMALE:No one talks to my daughter that way.
LEADMALE:So maybe you and your little horsehair weave should just mosey on before I get really upset.
LEADMALE:Better some horsehair than some no hair.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:Ashley.
OTHERMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:It ain't worth it.
OTHERMALE:It ain't worth it.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, you go to your dressing room and put on your costume.
OTHERMALE:Because I think Frank's gonna need some class to sell his drink.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, you're gonna let me do the commercial?
LEADMALE:It's up to you if you want to.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy, thank you.
OTHERMALE:Ha-ha.

OTHERMALE:It's "your mama.
LEADMALE:" Hey, Ashley, I gotta tell you.
LEADMALE:I think this commercial thing is gonna be all right.
SUPFEMALE:You know, all them new friends you made today.
LEADFEMALE:How you got all their telephone numbers.
LEADMALE:That was cool.
OTHERMALE:I'll give you $20 apiece for each of them.
OTHERMALE:Hey, except for that cat girl.
SUPFEMALE:She had a beard.
LEADMALE:Daddy, did you hear? Frank said I'm a shoo-in for the School of Performing Arts.
LEADMALE:I'm as good as in New York.
LEADFEMALE:I've said it before and I'll say it again.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:What happened to you being more open-minded? I am open-minded, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:And any commercial you wanna shoot here in the greater Los Angeles area hey, I'm on board.
SUPFEMALE:Will, what do you think? Hey, I have nothing but love and respect for the both of you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mom.
SUPMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you convince Dad it's all right for me to move to New York? Tell her she is too young to move anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:I moved out of the horse when I was 17.
OTHERFEMALE:Horse? House.

LEADMALE:We found one but

SUPFEMALE:He did it.
LEADFEMALE:What? Hey.
