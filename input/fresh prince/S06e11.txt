LEADMALE:Hi, Grandma.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:I'm so glad you're here.
SUPMALE:I need someone to talk to.
LEADMALE:See, I just don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I was all set for today to be the best day of my life but it feels just like any other day.
LEADFEMALE:And I have this empty feeling, you know, like something's missing? Sure, I have an effervescent personality and a smile that could blind you from across the room but I just feel so blah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying something, honey? You've gotta talk into my good ear.

SUPFEMALE:Remember, doc, no mouth-to-mouth on the first date, huh? Ha, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's like a hotel.
LEADMALE:They expect you to take this stuff.
LEADMALE:Have you taken the roast out of the oven yet, Geoffrey? Show me again how it's done, Nana Hattie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right.
SUPFEMALE:I love my job.
LEADMALE:Mm-mm-mm.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma Hattie's roast.
LEADFEMALE:You know, a cow would be happy to be in your kitchen.
LEADMALE:Boy, am I happy to be here.
SUPMALE: HILARY: Oh, great.
LEADFEMALE:You're all here.
LEADFEMALE:I have some really big news.
SUPFEMALE:No news is bigger than my mother's roast.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna have a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that would be bigger than the roast.
LEADMALE:Daddy, you're gonna be a grandpa.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, say something.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, get the Scotch.
LEADFEMALE:It's gone, sir.
LEADMALE:What? You've said my attitude has improved lately.
OTHERMALE:How could this happen? It's the pressure, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Phil, calm down.
SUPMALE:Hilary, darling, this doesn't have to be bad news.
SUPFEMALE:Having a child is a gift.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come on, tell Grandma, who's the father? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dear God.
OTHERMALE:Ashley, take your grandmother upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Will, takes notes.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, grandma.
OTHERMALE:Just how pregnant are you? Who said I was pregnant? I said I was gonna have a baby.
LEADMALE:I think Aunt Viv must've dropped the ball on that little girl-girl talk.
LEADMALE:Hilary, you're not making any sense.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not pregnant yet.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go down to one of those fertility clinics and find a donor.
LEADMALE:After Will and I went to the hospital, I realized what was missing in my life.
LEADMALE:I need a baby.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Are you insane? Do you have any idea what having a baby entails, huh? This is madness.
SUPMALE:A baby is a lifetime commitment.
OTHERFEMALE:A commitment that a couple makes.
LEADMALE:A baby is not a pick-me-up.
LEADFEMALE:Scotch is a pick-me-up.
LEADMALE:Damn that, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I didn't come here for your permission I came here for your blessing.
SUPFEMALE:This is your fault.
LEADMALE:Hey, man.
LEADFEMALE:How you gonna blame me? You're the one who took her to the hospital.
SUPFEMALE:Therefore, it's your fault.
LEADFEMALE:There.
SUPMALE:Oh, forget it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what I'm saying.
OTHERMALE:What am I gonna say to Vivian? WILL: Uh "Hi, Grandma"? Heh, heh.
OTHERMALE:Hoo.
LEADMALE:Thanks for coming, Will.
LEADFEMALE:It's really great to have your support.
OTHERFEMALE:No problem.
SUPMALE:When you leave here there'll be no doubt in your mind what you wanna do.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I'd like some information about your, um, inventory.
LEADMALE:Are you looking for something specific? What have you got in a hunk? You'll be happy to know that our donors are screened very thoroughly.
LEADFEMALE:We have everything from doctors to rocket scientists.
SUPFEMALE:You wouldn't happen to have this month's, would you? Sure.
LEADMALE:Here you are, doctor.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:We get lots of doctors.
LEADMALE:Ugh! I don't think so.
LEADMALE: Hey, yo.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, man.
SUPMALE:Glad I could be of service.
LEADMALE:Hey, come on, let's get out of here.
OTHERMALE:Uh I'll catch up to you later.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you all for joining me on another journey of love, happiness and good cheer.
SUPFEMALE:So until tomorrow, goodbye.
OTHERMALE:And remember Okay? Whoo! Hey, good show, Hil.
LEADMALE:I'm glad to see you're feeling better.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what'd you expect? Well, you know, after today, I kind of thought you Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:That was just a little setback.
SUPMALE:I'm a trouper.
LEADMALE:Girl, you are a super-duper trouper.
LEADMALE:Well, I just hope my baby's a super-duper trouper too.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:WILL: Huh?
OTHERMALE:Baby? DUANE: Hey.
SUPFEMALE:You ready?
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what's up, doc.
LEADMALE:What you doing? Come back to deliver another baby, huh? What, you get a commission on them? No, I came to pick up Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Will.
SUPFEMALE:On to plan B.
SUPMALE:So how do you like the food?
OTHERMALE:It's delicious.
OTHERMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:I found this place the first year of my internship.
LEADFEMALE:I was dying for food that didn't come out of a machine.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
SUPFEMALE:I spent some time in Milan and this place reminds me of a little restaurant near the Piazza Di Vani.
OTHERFEMALE:So any mental illness in your family? Heh.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? Schizophrenia? Anorexia? You know, general weirdness? Uh, not that I know of.
SUPFEMALE:So tell me, what were you doing in Italy? Shopping and studying Italian.
LEADMALE:So you speak Italian?
LEADMALE:Well, not exactly.
SUPFEMALE:I did more shopping than studying, but it didn't matter I mean, they have translators in all those little shops.
SUPFEMALE:So back to you.
LEADMALE:Any heart disease? Gingivitis? Midgets? No.
OTHERMALE:Any relatives in the circus? Uh, not that I know of.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I did have an uncle who was a clown.
LEADFEMALE:Ew.
LEADFEMALE:Duly noted.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't they so cute? You're so lucky, you get to be around babies all the time.
LEADMALE:Yeah, babies are great.
SUPFEMALE:I can't wait to have a family someday.
SUPMALE:How about you? I suppose.
OTHERMALE:Oh, so you're not ready for babies, huh? No, I'm definitely ready for a baby, it's just the family.
LEADMALE:I mean I hadn't thought about it, I guess.
SUPMALE:I don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, how can you have one without the other? Wait, wasn't I the one asking all the questions? Want another hit? Hit me.
LEADMALE:PHIL: Ah  What were we thinking about having kids?  What? What? I was wondering what life would've been like without the headaches of parenting.
LEADFEMALE: Imagine that, if you ain't had no kids.
SUPFEMALE:It'd just be you, Aunt Viv and me all by ourselves in this big house.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Party, you know.
LEADMALE: I saw the light on.
SUPFEMALE:Can I talk to you, Daddy? Oh, God, I don't wanna do this.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I'd Daddy, please?
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Will, will you excuse us, please?
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure thing.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, Uncle Phil, I just want you to know I got your back.
LEADMALE:All right? Anything jump off, all you got to do is holler
OTHERMALE:Goodbye, Will.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Where did we go wrong? Well? You said you wanted to talk.
LEADMALE:Daddy, I'm not gonna have a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's a relief.
LEADFEMALE:I must tell you, this whole thing has been very upsetting.
SUPMALE:It's been upsetting for me too.
LEADMALE:I thought that the show going national was gonna change my life.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I had set certain career goals for myself and then when I reached them, I still felt empty.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, it's fine to have career goals it's wrong to assume that's all you need to make you happy.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I thought I needed a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I need a new car.
OTHERMALE:Oh, God, Hilary.
OTHERMALE:I'm kidding, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have all the answers.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish I did, but I don't.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it used to be so easy.
LEADFEMALE:You'd cry, I'd buy you a bracelet.
LEADFEMALE:You cried louder, maybe some earrings.
SUPFEMALE:I miss those days.
SUPMALE:Just remember happiness comes from inside.
LEADMALE:Hm?
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:I love you too, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:It's perfect.
OTHERMALE:It's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:I was talking about my side.
LEADMALE:Your side? Please.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen better looking trees hanging from rearview mirrors.
LEADMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:Your side looks like someone threw up on a snowman.
LEADMALE:Threw up on a snowman?
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, that's enough, you two.
SUPFEMALE:All right, now, each side is very nice in its own way.
SUPFEMALE:You really think so, Will? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I mean, you might've laid the flock on a little thick but other than that, it's very busy.
LEADFEMALE:Not bad, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Not bad.
LEADMALE:I'm just kind of getting the hang of this parenting thing here, know what I mean? Hey, Dad, I'm heading down to the mall.
LEADMALE:Mind if I borrow a few bucks? I'm sorry, I'm busted.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have to get back with me later on that one.
LEADFEMALE:You call that dusting, Geoffrey? Give me that.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll do it myself.
LEADMALE:GEOFFREY: God bless us, everyone
OTHERMALE:
