SUPFEMALE:Okay, well, I'm against plea bargaining and I'm for y eah, but where do you stand on a woman's right to choose the restaurant? I think we should leave that up to the Supreme Court.

SUPMALE:Philip Banks, kick the man's butt.
LEADMALE:Can't do it, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:I'm running an honest campaign.
SUPMALE:Philip, that man is evil and senile.

SUPFEMALE:I hate L.
SUPFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:And there's the loser now! Let's listen in as he makes his concession speech.
LEADMALE:Everyone, I want to thank you for your support.
LEADMALE:We put up a good fight and well it was just an unfortunate set of circumstances that saw y ou don't have to shove, we got two exits! Mr.
SUPMALE:Banks not in recent memory has someone managed to lose a race by such a large margin.
LEADFEMALE:And so darn quickly.
SUPMALE:How does it feel? Well, once when I was a kid I zipped my pants up too fast let's just say this brings back old memories.
LEADMALE:On a brighter note, I see you've brought your lovely family with you including your daughter, KFPB weather personality, Hilary Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, you have just seen your father suffer a humiliating defeat.
LEADMALE:So tell me, are you free for dinner tonight? Look, my father just lost an election.

LEADMALE:Let's get the hell out of here.
LEADMALE:That was fun.
OTHERFEMALE:There goes Philip Banks the biggest sap that ever lived.
SUPMALE:What a stooge.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me? You heard me.
OTHERFEMALE:He's a sap, a dope, a loser.
LEADFEMALE:He never had what it takes and he never will.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't that right? I think you should take that back, man.
LEADMALE:You do?
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think you should run along and play.
OTHERFEMALE:And don't get involved in politics until you're a big boy.
SUPMALE:At least my uncle stands for something.
SUPFEMALE:Really? And what would that be? A buffet? My uncle fights for what he believes in.
SUPFEMALE:Shame on me.
LEADFEMALE:My uncle's three times the man you will ever be.
SUPFEMALE:He's got my vote.
LEADMALE:And another 
SUPFEMALE:Everything you said in your campaign was a lie.
LEADFEMALE:You have no integrity, no decency, and you're really, really short.
SUPMALE:And I'll tell you another thing, if you don't like it, man, you can drop dead.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, he's dead.
LEADMALE:Come on, man, if I told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it? How are you doing, baby? I just feel so guilty, Aunt Viv.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, now, you gotta stop blaming yourself, Will.
LEADMALE:He wasn't a young man, he didn't take very good care of himself.
SUPMALE:Now, you heard what the doctor said.
LEADMALE:I know, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:If I could just forget it, just clear my mind for one minute.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Will, you really knocked them dead the other night, huh? Don't get him mad, Mom.
OTHERMALE:You don't want to make him raise his voice.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, take out the trash, honey.
LEADMALE:I did it last week, it's the Terminator's turn.
LEADMALE:Dan Quayle, please.
LEADMALE:I'll hold.
LEADMALE:Carlton, why are you calling Dan Quayle? Simple.
SUPMALE:Thanks to the Grim Reaper over here and Judge Robertson taking the old dirt nap the governor has to appoint someone and the right endorsement could swing it to Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Carlton Banks.
LEADFEMALE:That's B-A-N-K-S.
LEADFEMALE:No E.
SUPFEMALE:That was a joke, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Hello? The phone's dead, Will.
OTHERMALE:Carlton, man, I am not a killer.
LEADMALE:That's not funny.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, you know I'd never hurt you, right? I know.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, you know that I would never Hurt a fly.
LEADMALE:We know.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Will, you're taking this way too seriously.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, it's not like you got a bad haircut.
LEADMALE:Look, I think I know how to help Will.
SUPMALE:This calls for tough love.
SUPMALE:We've gotta draw him out.
SUPMALE:We've gotta bait him, confront him attack him until he defends himself.
OTHERMALE:Only then will he start to feel better.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Look, just follow my lead.
LEADMALE:Will, you should be ashamed of yourself.
SUPMALE:How could you do such a thing? Hope you never get mad at me.
OTHERMALE:Why are y'all screaming at me? I was minding my damn business eating some fruit.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I could be wrong.
LEADFEMALE:You won't believe this.
OTHERFEMALE:They want me to give the eulogy at Judge Robertson's funeral.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
SUPMALE:Philip, you know, I really hate to speak ill of the dead but if that little man hadn't died I would have killed him myself.
SUPFEMALE:So, who's up for Chinese food?
LEADFEMALE:I'd like some.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna give the eulogy, Vivian.
SUPMALE:Philip, no.
SUPMALE:Dad, how could you say yes? I know Carl changed over the years but the man was my mentor.
SUPMALE:And I'm going to that funeral.
LEADFEMALE:And you're all going with me.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, any chance of getting those flowers after the funeral? Sit down, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to welcome you to the memorial for Carl Robertson.
LEADMALE:Saying a few words on behalf of the departed will be Philip Banks.
SUPMALE:Vivian, where's my speech?
SUPMALE:It's on the kitchen counter where I Sorry, Philip.
SUPMALE:What can you say about Judge Carl Robertson? What indeed? He was a judge.
SUPMALE:A judge named Carl.
LEADMALE:But he was more.
SUPFEMALE:So much more.
LEADMALE:Carl He wasn't a very heavy man.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm probably the wrong person to be up here.
SUPMALE:I mean, I just got finished losing an election to the man in which he used every dirty trick in the book.
SUPMALE:So, at this time I'd like to invite someone with an especially warm memory of Carl Robertson to come up here and share it with us.
LEADFEMALE:Anyone with a somewhat fond memory of Carl Robertson.
