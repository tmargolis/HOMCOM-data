LEADMALE:Yo, Nicky, you ready? 
SUPMALE:Almost.
LEADFEMALE:Hurry up, man, we got to get on.
LEADMALE:Where's Nicky? Today is children's day at the Nixon Library.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up, man.
SUPFEMALE:Nicky's going with me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm taking him to the sorority beach-volleyball tournament.
LEADMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:Two hundred honeys bumping and spiking.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I mean? Heh.
OTHERMALE:You know what I mean? Yeah, you don't know what I mean.
SUPFEMALE:You're just Nicky's cousin, I'm his brother.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a big branch of his family tree.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:Then why are your limbs so short? Let's see what my father thinks about this.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, you big baby.
LEADMALE:Fine, Nicky can go with you.
LEADFEMALE:Y'all just have fun.
LEADMALE:Really?
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, sure, man.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Don't forget your flag, though.
LEADMALE:What's a day at the Nixon Library without Old Glory?
LEADMALE:Oh, good call.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE: 
SUPFEMALE:Hey! Hey! Everybody going to the beach say, "Kowabunga!"
LEADMALE:Kowabunga!!
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE: Whoa, nice flowers.
SUPMALE:Another stalker? I wish.
LEADFEMALE:I had a problem at the studio today.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Well, I was late for my talk-show taping, so I parked in the first space I could find.
SUPMALE:I found out later it was Leeza Gibbons' spot and she had my car towed.
LEADMALE: I was so upset, I sent these flowers to cheer myself up.
LEADMALE:Man, now who does a thing like that? I know, can you believe her? I don't care how high her ratings are, nobody treats Hilary Banks like this.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get her.
SUPMALE:And her little car too.
LEADFEMALE:You're not taking them diet pills again, are you? You have to help me think of a way to get even with her.
LEADMALE:Forgive me, but why are you involving Master William? Will's come a long way from Philly, but let's face it he's still a common street hood from the wrong side of the tracks.
LEADFEMALE:So will you help me? Oh, gee, you know, when you put it that way, no.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I'm begging you.
OTHERMALE:Look, come on, girl, that's vandalism you're talking about.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I do remember this one time, though my homies was trying to get even with this gym teacher.
LEADMALE:My man Chill took a key, scratched all up the side of the paint.
LEADMALE:I took a potato, right, rammed it up in the tailpipe.
LEADMALE:Dude came out, started that joint, it was like "kaboom!" Boom! What a wonderful lesson for Master Nicky.
LEADMALE:Perhaps now you could teach him to run with scissors.
SUPMALE:Come on, G, Nicky knows that vandalism ain't cool, right?
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:All right, come on, let's go.
LEADMALE:Unh.
SUPMALE:Get down to this beach.
LEADMALE:Get with these honeys, know what I mean? Geoffrey, if I were a potato, where would I be?
SUPFEMALE:Where are you two going?
SUPMALE:To the beach.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me and Will are going trolling for slimmies.
LEADMALE:He be tripping.
SUPMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:No, he mean, "We gonna play in the sand.
SUPFEMALE:" Ha, ha.
SUPMALE:Look, Ashley, it's Daddy's mad face.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Nicky, let's go upstairs before Daddy's head explodes.
LEADFEMALE:Will, at this age, Nicky is like a sponge.
SUPMALE:If he hears something he likes, he's gonna imitate it.
LEADMALE:Oh, kind of like Michael Bolton.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you've been spending too much time with Nicky.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't Carlton have some plans for this afternoon? Oh, yeah, and where is he? I know he better have a daggone good excuse for standing Nicky up.
SUPFEMALE:Will locked me in the closet.
LEADMALE: That's so tired.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:All right, Uncle Phil I just wanted to take the kid to his first bikini volleyball tournament.
LEADMALE:I do not want my little boy exposed to that much sex.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry, Mom, it only happened once.
LEADFEMALE:You meant Nicky, didn't you? I read that Dougie is gonna be appearing down at the mall today.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Dougie? That big, dumb, orange whale that be singing them stupid songs? Those are life-affirming little ditties that bring joy to the young and young at heart.

LEADMALE:Cute and ugly, I love them all
LEADMALE:Cute and ugly, I love them all Would you like to go see Dougie at the mall today? Dougie? Cool! Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, time out.
LEADFEMALE:Now, can we think about this for a second, please? Now, Dougie loves everything.
SUPMALE:People, am I the only one that finds something terribly wrong with that?  I love bugs and I love death I love oozing flesh wounds Mommy! Mommy! Will! Will! What the hell is wrong with you? Oh, I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:I didn't know he was gonna act like that.
LEADFEMALE:Look, at least can I take him to the mall? Are we gonna go see Dougie? Yeah, that's right.
LEADMALE:Me and you.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:If we hurry out of there, we can make it to the victory swim.
LEADMALE:Hey, unhand me.
OTHERFEMALE:Sir, the floor seating is for children only.
LEADMALE:Now sit in the chair like a grown-up.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Where's Dougie? Well, he is a whale.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should go look for him at the beach.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:  
OTHERMALE:It's Dougie.

LEADMALE:What's wrong with Dougie? I think something must have crawled up his blowhole.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Dougie! Dougie! Dougie! Dougie! Dougie! Let's get out of here.
OTHERMALE:Last time a Dougie concert was canceled, kids went crazy and trashed a babyGap.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go back and have a mammal-to-mammal with Dougie.
LEADMALE:Go get Nicky and calm this crowd down.
SUPMALE:Come on, Nicky.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit right here.
LEADFEMALE:Maestro.
LEADMALE: Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Dougie? I was wondering when you were coming back out there because we've been waiting all day.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you a little old for this crap? Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but my cousin isn't.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he came here to see a show.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah? What'd he pay for the ticket? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:It was free.
OTHERFEMALE:Then the little brat got his money's worth.
LEADMALE:Now beat it.
SUPMALE: Um, look here, you big orange Moby Dick.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, hotshot.
OTHERMALE:I know this isn't as glamorous as your job down at the mini-mart but I make an honest day's work.
SUPFEMALE:And who the hell are you to look down on me, huh, punk?  You pushed me, called me "punk.
SUPMALE:" That's funny.
OTHERMALE:Listen.
SUPFEMALE:Um I'll tell you what, why don't you just put your hat on go back out there, do what you gotta do for the kids because they're looking forward to it.
LEADMALE:

SUPMALE: You see?
LEADMALE:Get him!
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE: Mom, presenting the all new and improved Nicholas Banks.
LEADMALE:Look at you.
LEADMALE:Nicky and I are gonna be spending more time together, especially since he's M-A-D at W-I-L-L.
LEADFEMALE:How do you like your new clothes, baby? Mommy, I H-A-T-E them.
OTHERFEMALE:From now on, it's you and me, Nicky.
LEADMALE:The fabulous Banks boys.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's up, everybody? Nicky.
SUPFEMALE:He's still mad at you, and so am I.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please leave me alone, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I already had to go through this for 40 hours with Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:I made a mistake.
SUPMALE:That's why I bought this train set.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's a start.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:When I was a little girl, I got so mad at your mother I stopped speaking to her for weeks.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh.
SUPFEMALE:Really? It's hard to imagine you being quiet for that long, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE: Go on.
LEADFEMALE:She gave away one of my favorite toys.
LEADMALE:It was a Raggedy Ann doll.
LEADMALE:But I got over it.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, wait a minute, my mom told me about that.
SUPMALE:Didn't you chop the head off her teddy bear and flush it down the toilet? That's how I got over it.
SUPMALE:Look at this.
OTHERFEMALE:"Powerful Earthquake Rattles Northern Coast.
SUPFEMALE:" Oh, boo-hoo.
OTHERFEMALE:This.
LEADMALE:"Television personality Leeza Gibbons was shocked that the woman attempting to vandalize her car was none other than rival talk-show host Hilary Banks.
LEADMALE: Banks, seen here wielding a potato " Wielding? I was not wielding, I was rubbing.
LEADFEMALE:I rubbed that damn potato all over Leeza's car and it didn't make a scratch.
SUPFEMALE: At least they didn't catch me putting my keys in her exhaust pipe.
LEADMALE:Hilary, you were suppo Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:  Hey, Nicky.
LEADMALE:What's all this? His Dougie toys, he's giving them all away.
SUPMALE:I'm not worthy, thanks to you.
LEADFEMALE:Nicky, Nicky, come here, come here.
SUPMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:You don't understand, man.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I wasn't rumbling with Dougie.
SUPFEMALE:I was rumbling with the guy inside Dougie.
SUPMALE:Oh, right, the guy inside Dougie.
LEADFEMALE: That damn whale got him brainwashed.
LEADFEMALE:Will, Nicky believes in Dougie the same way he believes in Santa Claus.
OTHERFEMALE:So?
LEADMALE:Well, Dougie's his hero.
LEADMALE:Didn't you have heroes when you were a kid? Yeah, Shaft.
SUPFEMALE:And how did you feel when you found out that Shaft wasn't real? What are you talking about? No, I'm saying, he was based on an actual guy.
SUPMALE:No, he wasn't.
LEADFEMALE:He was too, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Shaft is fictional, Will.
SUPMALE:I'm saying, he went to Africa and everything.
LEADMALE:Will, you can't tell Nicky that Dougie isn't real.
LEADMALE:Why don't you take him down to the mall and let him see you apologize to Dougie? I thought of that, just he ain't there no more.
LEADMALE:Well, where is he? In rehab.
LEADMALE:Well, Will, you have to do something.
SUPFEMALE: It's like he lost his best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Yep, I know the feeling.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey! Geoffrey! Yes, Miss Hilary? I have been calling you for 15 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you hear me? Yes, but I so rarely have a woman scream my name I was rather enjoying it.
LEADMALE:I need to tape Leeza Gibbons' show.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna record every nasty thing she says and then I'm gonna sue her for definition of character.
LEADMALE: Now, how do you turn this on? Why don't you just use the VCR? Geoffrey, if I knew how to use the VCR, would I need this camera? No, I would not.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's already started.
OTHERMALE:Turn it on.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:So that's all coming up today.
LEADFEMALE:But we'll get to that in a moment.
OTHERMALE:First, I wanna talk about this so-called feud going on between Hilary Banks and me.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Hilary, you and I, we're part of a very special sorority.
LEADMALE:A sort of sisterhood of talk-show hosts.
OTHERFEMALE:I love your show and I wish you lots of success.
LEADMALE:So, what do you say? Let's bury the hatchet.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh, that witch.
SUPMALE:So you see it too.
LEADFEMALE:All I see is a beautiful woman perched atop two of the most finely sculpted legs I've ever seen.
LEADMALE:Oh, like those are real.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, the pogmeister's in the house.
LEADFEMALE:Who wants some? Looks like I'm out.
LEADMALE:Here's Will.
LEADMALE:Maybe he can give you some competition.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not in the mood.
SUPFEMALE:Gets that from his mother.
LEADFEMALE:You know what that kid's problem is? His values is all messed up, man.
LEADMALE:Any other normal kid, you could just buy their love back.
LEADFEMALE:This has really upset you, hasn't it?  You was right, man, I'm a terrible role model.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't never having no kids.
SUPMALE:Well, now, Will, as much as the idea of your reproducing scares the hell out of me you'll make a great father.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody makes mistakes with kids.
LEADFEMALE:The important thing is to admit when you're wrong and to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:How come you don't ever do that? Don't question me.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey, Nicky.
LEADMALE:Mind if I join you? Wow.
SUPMALE:I didn't know you could read the paper.
LEADMALE:I can't.
SUPFEMALE:Nicky, listen, there's something I need to tell you about Dougie.
SUPMALE:And not just him neither.
SUPFEMALE:It's the Easter bunny and the tooth fairy.
LEADMALE:What about them? Well, you're getting to be a big boy now.
SUPFEMALE:Sooner or later you're gonna find out none of them
LEADFEMALE:None of them are what?
LEADFEMALE:Um Here, read the personals, Nicky.
LEADMALE:Yo, hottie.
OTHERFEMALE:Yo.
OTHERFEMALE:What's up, baby? Freeze, munchkins! They're not munchkins, son, they're elves.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Who are you, Keebler?  Oh, boy, you're not even close.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:All right, look here, dude.
SUPFEMALE:Check it out.
LEADMALE:Um I'm about to give a little ring-a-ding-ding to Bel-Air Security.
SUPMALE:So if you and any of your little friends took anything, you better put it back.
LEADFEMALE:You hold on there, young man.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody talks to Santa Claus like that.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Santa Claus.
LEADFEMALE:Right on, yeah.
SUPMALE:Everybody knows Santa Claus is a Clippers fan.
LEADFEMALE:I am not.
LEADMALE:I just can't move these things.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you listen to me, sonny.
LEADFEMALE:I don't usually make off-season visits but you were about to do something terrible to your cousin Nicky.
SUPMALE:You don't have any idea what I'm talking about, do you?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, of course you don't.
LEADMALE:Maybe this year I'll put a brain in your stocking.
SUPMALE:Why do these make-believe guys keep pushing me? Come on over here.
LEADMALE:Sit down, right here.
LEADFEMALE:Unh-unh.
LEADFEMALE: Now, what are you talking about with Nicky? Will being a child today is tougher than any time that I can remember.
SUPFEMALE:But, Nicky Nicky is blessed with a very precious gift.
LEADMALE:Innocence.
LEADFEMALE:And you were about to take that away from him.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't wanna do that.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want him to be mad at me forever.
SUPFEMALE:Aw, Will, nothing is forever with children.
LEADFEMALE:They grow up and they forget.
LEADMALE:Hey, remember something you used to believe in me once.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you ought to try believing in me again.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, here, here.
OTHERFEMALE:You be a good boy.
LEADMALE:And tell Carlton to stop faxing me.
OTHERMALE:I cannot get him into Princeton.
LEADMALE: 
SUPFEMALE:Will! Will! Nicky.
SUPFEMALE:Nicky.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Santa was here.
LEADMALE:Did you see him? Uh, yeah, we was kicking it in the pool house.
LEADMALE:You know Santa? Know him? Who do you think gave him the idea for that mistletoe thing?
LEADFEMALE:You?
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:See, we was chilling back in Philly one night.
LEADMALE:It was me, Santa, the tooth fairy and Shaft, right? Who's Shaft? Who's Shaft? Oh, Nicky, there's so much I got to teach you.
LEADMALE:See, Shaft was a complicated man.
LEADFEMALE:
