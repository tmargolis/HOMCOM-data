OTHERMALE:Those tonsils have just got to come out.
LEADMALE:Now there's no reason to be afraid.
OTHERMALE:Who are you kidding? Why do you think they wear masks? So they can't be identified.

LEADFEMALE:Look, this time they've given me a real scalpel.
SUPMALE:Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Man, I'm getting out of here before Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Hannibal Lecter shows up.
LEADFEMALE:Doctor, the patient in 214 is not responding to the medication.
LEADFEMALE:What should I do? Well, Nurse, I'd run a KGB and an NAACP.
LEADFEMALE:If he still doesn't respond give him an upper GI Joe.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to get my real estate license.
LEADMALE:They got some free ice-cream and cake in the cafeteria.
SUPFEMALE:Well, this is enjoyable.

LEADMALE:Oh, sweetheart, Will's operation's gonna go fine.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I'm talking about Geoffrey's book.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey can write whatever he wants.
LEADFEMALE:This family has nothing to hide.
SUPMALE:Your father's right.
SUPFEMALE:Now I don't want to hear any more about it, okay? Philip, would you help me clear the dishes, please? Geoffrey knows everything about us.

LEADFEMALE:Now hit the dirt and start twitching.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, we've got to find those memoirs.
LEADMALE:I'll just die if my friends find out why Lou in Better Shoes gives me that 10% discount.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, what if my friends find out I sleep with a hand puppet? Move over, Carlton.
LEADMALE:I don't have any room.
LEADFEMALE:Will, move over.
SUPMALE:Will? Geoffrey, we'd like to speak to you for a moment.
OTHERFEMALE:He's not here, Philip, let's go.
SUPMALE:Not so quick, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:Do you really want Hilary to find out she was conceived during a Sly Stone concert? Well, it never would have happened if he hadn't been five hours late.
LEADFEMALE:All right, everybody out.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here? What are y'all doing here? And I hope them concert tickets wasn't front row.

LEADFEMALE:Where was I conceived?
OTHERFEMALE:Probably at a white sale.
SUPMALE:That's enough.
LEADMALE:Will, why aren't you in the hospital? I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I'm scared of going under the knife.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, if I wanted to get cut I'd let Stevie Wonder do my fade.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, I know you're nervous about this operation but you have to believe that we know what's best for you.
LEADFEMALE:The bottom line is it has to be done.
LEADMALE:So you have a choice.
SUPFEMALE:You can either be dragged in kicking and screaming or you can stand up and walk in like a man.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Will, we're gonna step outside and talk to your doctor.
SUPFEMALE:You've given us your word that you won't try to escape, and I trust you.
LEADFEMALE:Abdulla, here's $100.
SUPFEMALE:If he tries to run, sit on him.
