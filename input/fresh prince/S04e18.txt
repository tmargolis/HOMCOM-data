LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:What is wrong with you, girl? Will, daddy is going to drive me and my date to the movies tonight.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't sound like that's a big deal.
SUPFEMALE:Will, the last time daddy drove me and my date to the movies he wound up sitting in the two seats behind us.
LEADMALE:Couldn't you just drop us off and pick us up? Oh, I'm afraid that's a little bit of a problem, Ashley.

LEADMALE:6 on the Richter scale so I wanna be there, you know, for all the aftershocks.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you're saying.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm doomed.
OTHERMALE:Ashley? I've circled the movies I feel are appropriate for you and your friend.

SUPMALE:She's in your hands.
OTHERMALE:But if anything happens to her, those hands will be without fingers.
LEADMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Lose my fingers, sir.
