OTHERFEMALE:Yo, what up, guys?
LEADMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADMALE:Master William.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Viv, I got the cake you wanted for the family reunion.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:And guess what's in here? It's round, it's rubber and you'll never use it.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, can we please keep your hand puppet out of this? Look, it's a California's driver's license.
SUPMALE:I think you're confused, Will.
LEADMALE:You need a license to drive a car, not steal one.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, Carlton, I didn't understand you, I don't speak pygmy.
LEADFEMALE:Diva! Will, what do you think you're doing? I'm practicing for when my mom and all my aunts get here.
SUPMALE:I am so excited, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Aren't you excited? No.
LEADMALE:I hate family reunions.
SUPFEMALE:I always do all the work.
LEADMALE:Philip, that is not true.
OTHERMALE:Philip, this is not the kind of juice Vy drinks and Helen does not like this kind of bread.
SUPMALE:I guess I will have to take it back to the store.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, let me do that.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Would you pick me up a gallon of Rocky Road and some sardines.
OTHERFEMALE:And don't eat it all on the way home like you did last time.
SUPMALE:Look who we found.
OTHERMALE:Diva! Helen, oh, God! Let me look at you.
LEADMALE:Let me look at it, let me look at it.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, Frank, how are you?
OTHERMALE:I'm fine, how you doing? Let me look at Frank, Jr.
LEADFEMALE:My goodness, where did you get those beautiful green eyes? I'm guessing, the guy with no rhythm.
LEADMALE:You mean Carlton? Diva! Whoa, whoa, think you could all come together next time?
LEADFEMALE:This is exhausting.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me look at you all.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian, girl, you are glowing.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:That's 'cause she be spending a lot of time in front of the microwave.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, that reminds me.
LEADMALE:Would you pick me up some microwave popcorn, please? You know, next time I'm going to get pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you certainly have the pants for it.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, if I would have said that I would have gotten smacked in my head.
SUPMALE:Look at Little Frank.
LEADFEMALE:Now that's the first time a man has smiled at me since my divorce.
LEADMALE:Aunt Helen, I just want to say how sorry I am things didn't work out between you and Uncle Lester.
LEADMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think he'll still be sending me a gift for graduation? How has he been acting since the divorce? Awful.
LEADMALE:I hate that man.
SUPFEMALE:But I don't like to badmouth him without the kid around.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's like doing the work twice.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Vy? Now, she said she has some really big news.
LEADMALE:You know, she told me the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it obvious? Really big news? She must be bringing me Grandma's diamond earrings.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you like them? Aunt Janice, I never got to know Grandma.
SUPMALE:I'd really like to have something of hers.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, honey, I have a beautiful silk handkerchief of Grandma's.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, like I really want some old lady's snot rag.
LEADMALE:Well, she said it was something about Robert.
LEADFEMALE:Now, ladies, this could be an engagement announcement.
OTHERMALE:You know it could
LEADFEMALE:Come on! No! Maybe the big news is something else.
LEADMALE:Maybe she got cable.
LEADMALE:Divas!
OTHERMALE:Big Diva.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, it's a terrible idea marrying this Robert dude, it's a big mistake.
LEADMALE:Baby, I'm not marrying Robert, we broke up.
SUPFEMALE:Vy, now come
LEADMALE:That's the big news.
SUPFEMALE:My goodness.
SUPMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, what happened, tell us.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:He just wanted more out of the relationship and I wasn't sure I could spend the rest of my life with him.
SUPMALE:Amen.
OTHERFEMALE:And, Will's never been too fond of him.
LEADMALE:No, Will was not.
LEADMALE:So, in the long run it seemed like the best thing.
OTHERMALE:Well Hey, you know, Vy, I have a brother who's single.
SUPMALE:Although, he's not a brother.
OTHERMALE:I mean he is a brother because he's my brother, but he's just not your kind of brother.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, brother.
LEADMALE:Help me, Will.
SUPMALE:No, I think I'm going to stick with the black folks on this one.
LEADFEMALE:I love you so much, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too, sweetie.
LEADMALE:You know, it's great having you out here.
LEADFEMALE:Especially without that Robert dude.
LEADFEMALE:Getting all in our hair.
LEADFEMALE:Trying like a damn fool to win me over.
OTHERFEMALE:You're not kidding, baby.
LEADFEMALE:You know, for your graduation, he actually wanted to buy you a car.
OTHERMALE:A car?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you dumped him anyway, Ma.
LEADMALE:What kind of car he want to get me, Mom? Okay, set everything on the island.
LEADFEMALE:We'll use it tomorrow to serve.
LEADFEMALE:Let me take that, Vivian, wouldn't want you to overexert yourself.
LEADMALE:Philip, are you upset with me? Vivian, for the past 48 hours, all I've heard 
OTHERFEMALE:"Philip, wash this.
OTHERFEMALE:Philip, dust that.
LEADMALE:"Philip, push me up the steps, I'm pregnant.
LEADMALE:" As long as you're not upset with me.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, when she's not looking, break one of her crystal figurines.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll work wonders for your attitude.
SUPMALE:Yes!
SUPMALE:Hello, everybody.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, girl.
LEADFEMALE:You guys missed a great afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:So did you.
LEADFEMALE:We were down at the news station.
SUPMALE:We got to polish the silver.
LEADMALE:Let me tell you, Hilary's the best weather girl I've ever seen.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:She's beautiful.
OTHERMALE:She's poised.
SUPFEMALE:She's articulate.
LEADMALE:God, I'm really enjoying all of this, but please stop.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Frank, honey, I think it's time to change Frank, Jr.
OTHERMALE:Okay, babe.
OTHERMALE:You know what, you look a little tired.

LEADMALE:Now, come on, you know you all were thinking it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm never driving in a car with Uncle Lou and Aunt Eleanor again.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, what happened?
LEADFEMALE:They were blasting the radio sticking their heads through the sunroof, and yelling at other cars.

LEADMALE:I mean, when are those two going to grow up? Honey, stop it.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Eleanor.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, get your own girl.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Eleanor.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Uncle Lou.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Look at you two.
SUPFEMALE:Gosh, you look like a couple of kids.
SUPFEMALE:You look like a couple of kids yourself.
LEADFEMALE:You all got to remember, she carrying Uncle Phil's child.
LEADMALE:Lou, I want to go up and freshen up.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPMALE:See you all tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Now, what does Aunt Eleanor have that I don't? A horny husband.
OTHERFEMALE:This is just so great, my whole family under one roof.
OTHERMALE:You know, I just wish that we could all be together all the time.
LEADMALE:Baby, at least you and I are going to be together in a few months.

LEADMALE:And keep your fingers crossed because I got a friend at U of P who thinks she might be able to pull some strings with your application.
SUPMALE:Heck, with me working around the corner, we could have lunch together every day.
LEADFEMALE:Every day.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you, baby, these past few days with you have been so great
LEADFEMALE:I haven't thought about Robert once.
LEADMALE:Really? 'Cause, yo, I've been thinking about him all the time.
LEADFEMALE:You just get some rest, and we'll talk some more tomorrow.

SUPFEMALE:It's really, really great to be rich.
OTHERMALE:"Hah, hah.
LEADMALE:" Isn't it nice to hear from Carlton? Baby, why ain't you got on that leisure suit I laid out for you? Because I'm a 72-year-old man still living with his mother.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm tired of it, Mom.
SUPMALE:I mean, I want to get married.
OTHERFEMALE:And I want to have some kids.
SUPMALE:And I don't want nobody telling me what to wear.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.

OTHERMALE:I'll cancel my date with Harriet.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, you ain't got to do that.
OTHERMALE:You just put on that leisure suit.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call Harriet.
LEADMALE:I'm still half asleep, so don't nobody talk to me.
LEADMALE:Did the baby wake you up?
SUPMALE:Eleanor and Lou woke me up.
LEADFEMALE:I swear that man's part jackhammer.
LEADMALE:Lord, they didn't even eat this much at the Last Supper.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess you old enough to remember.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but I'm still young enough to kick your butt.
SUPFEMALE:What are you all doing up?
LEADFEMALE:Eating and talking about sex.
LEADFEMALE:Personally, I prefer eating.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to wait an hour for seconds.
LEADFEMALE:All right! Well, Vy, tell me, what's the real deal between you and Robert?
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't in love with him.
LEADFEMALE:Girl, are you crazy? That man had a business, a car and money.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what's love got to do with it? Can we just for once have a conversation without my name being mentioned? Sure, Vy.
SUPMALE:Why is a certain person ruining Will's life by moving him back to Philly? Why doesn't a certain person stick a drumstick in her mouth and call it a day? Wait a minute, now, Vy.
OTHERMALE:We all family here and we all care about Will.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, do I tell you how to raise your son? No, but I wish you would.
SUPMALE:Vy, I really think Will had his heart set on going to school in California.
LEADMALE:So this is how it is? Once again my family has taken it upon themselves to decide that Vy don't know how to take care of her own.
LEADMALE:No, you're wrong.
LEADFEMALE:You're wrong.
LEADMALE:And I'll thank all of you to keep your noses out of my personal affairs.
SUPMALE:Okay, everybody, who's going to bless this table? Come on, you all.
OTHERMALE:I think it ought to be the oldest, Vy.
LEADMALE:I am not the oldest, Uncle Lou is.
SUPFEMALE:He's young to me.
LEADMALE:Lou!
LEADMALE:Yes, yes, okay, okay.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Dear Lord, we thank you for bringing our family together.
LEADFEMALE:Keep us safe and healthy so that we can come together again.
LEADMALE:And, we thank Philip and Vivian for their hospitality
LEADMALE:and their Jacuzzi.
LEADMALE:Amen.
SUPMALE:Enjoying the reunion, Master William? I don't know what to do, G.
LEADMALE:I mean I don't want to move back to Philly, but I don't want to let my mom down.
LEADFEMALE:But then on the other hand, it's like I'm so terribly sorry, Master William, there's been a misunderstanding.
LEADMALE:Apparently, I gave you the impression that I really wanted to know.
SUPFEMALE:Where did Uncle Lou and Aunt Eleanor disappear to? Oh, my God, are they at it again? Those two are animals.
LEADMALE:I was in the bathroom.
SUPFEMALE:Get your minds out the gutter.
LEADFEMALE:What? Now, Will, about your moving back to Philly.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know, the sheets and bed linens stay here.
SUPMALE:No, well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:No, what I was going to say was I hope that money wasn't a part of your decision because I'd be more than happy to help you with your tuition.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil but I need to be in Philly, you know, with my mom.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever you decide, I just want you to know that I'm behind you 100o/o.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks and it means a lot to me, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Okay, son.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Vivian, I told him everything you wanted me to now give me my piece of pie.
LEADFEMALE:Baby.
OTHERMALE:Hey, what's up, Mom?
LEADFEMALE:I have a little surprise for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah? Yes, I got a great deal on a cruise and I am sending you to the Caribbean for your graduation.
SUPFEMALE:For real?
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I always wanted to go to the Caribbean.
OTHERMALE:It'll be so great, baby.
SUPFEMALE:We could go snorkeling and play shuffleboard.
LEADFEMALE:We? You going, too? Well, sure, and it's not locked in yet but I think the entertainment is going to be the new Fifth Dimension.
SUPMALE:I love them, take me.
LEADFEMALE:Take me.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, you smell like broccoli.
LEADMALE:What's the matter?
OTHERMALE:Ma, this is great.
LEADFEMALE:We need to talk and Look, it can't wait.
LEADMALE:We got to talk about this right now.
LEADMALE:Well, I hate to say I told you so.
SUPFEMALE:I know what you all are thinking.
LEADFEMALE:But you're wrong.
SUPMALE:Now, Will is looking forward to moving back to Philly.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you, baby? Look what the wind did to my hat.
LEADFEMALE:Ma, can you help me go find it, please?
LEADMALE:Will, what's going on?
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Mom, it's We were just
SUPFEMALE:Somebody should fix this light here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, there's some things broken.
LEADFEMALE:The light, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Walk with me, talk with me, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:All right, look, check it out.
LEADMALE:Spit it out.
LEADFEMALE:All right, see, I was
LEADMALE:Baby, whatever it is, I will understand.
LEADFEMALE:I know, you'll understand and I'll be on my way to the emergency room.
SUPMALE:Will, just say it.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, I don't want to move back home.
SUPMALE:How can you say that? Baby, when I sent you out here, it was only on a temporary basis.
SUPMALE:I always expected you to come back home.
LEADFEMALE:So did I, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:And, I know I was tripping when I first came out here 'cause you were right, I needed to be out here.
LEADFEMALE:And I still need to be out here.
SUPMALE:You know, it's given me a head start so I can break out on my own.
SUPFEMALE:What about college? You know I can't afford to send you to an out-of-state school.
LEADMALE:I know, Ma, but, look, I was hoping I could get a scholarship or a loan, and Uncle Phil said he'd help me.
LEADFEMALE:And, if that doesn't work, I'll get a job I'll get two jobs, but please, don't make me move back home, Mommy.
SUPMALE:Obviously, you've given this a lot of thought, huh? But I'll be honest with you, I still want you to come home.
LEADMALE:I miss you.
LEADFEMALE:I miss you, too, Mom.
LEADMALE:Look, but I'll visit.
SUPMALE:Every Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:And every Easter.
LEADFEMALE:And whatever else of them holidays it'd take to get that evil look out your face.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it sounds like you made up your mind.
LEADFEMALE:So I guess I have to respect your decision.
LEADMALE:You do? I mean, you do!
OTHERMALE:I love you, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too, baby.
SUPFEMALE:As much as I hate to admit it, your aunts were right and I was wrong.
LEADMALE:But don't you dare tell them, you hear me?
LEADFEMALE:Someone should fix this light here.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Someone should fix this light.
LEADFEMALE:Your secret's safe with me.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, when she's not looking, break one of her crystal fusiliers.
LEADMALE:Do you know what a fusilier is? A fusilier, a crystal fusilier.
LEADFEMALE:They must got them in London.
OTHERFEMALE:
