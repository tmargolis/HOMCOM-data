LEADMALE:I'm in middle of a holiday shopping season.
LEADFEMALE:Are you mad? I simply said I was considering it.
SUPMALE:He's here plenty.
SUPFEMALE:You can't do this.
LEADMALE:Money, we need money.
LEADMALE:You know we can afford this.
OTHERMALE:You're the one who helped me invest.
OTHERFEMALE:My money makes money.
SUPFEMALE:We're rich.
OTHERMALE:That's right, we are rich.
LEADMALE:Never thought about it like that.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
OTHERMALE:If we're so rich why we can't afford no ceiling?
LEADMALE:Hi, Mr.
SUPMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, kids.
LEADMALE:Stop worrying, go to work, I'll handle your father.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know my father.
LEADMALE:He's very overprotective.
LEADMALE:Last time one of my boyfriends spent an evening with him it ended our relationship.
LEADMALE:So, what? You never saw the guy again? No, no one did.
SUPFEMALE:He left town.
OTHERFEMALE:At least that's what my dad told the police.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're exaggerating a little bit.
LEADMALE:Okay, maybe a little.
LEADFEMALE:But, just in case it's been really nice knowing you.
SUPFEMALE:Go on, girl, get out of here.
LEADMALE:Hiyah!
OTHERMALE:Bye, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:So you're meeting Lisa's father tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:4:30 from Cleveland.
SUPMALE:I remember the first time I met Vivian's father.
SUPMALE:He was an obstinate, dictatorial old tightwad.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't get along at all.
LEADMALE:Really? Even with all that in common? I'm serious, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Wasn't till the day he died that he did something to improve the situation.
LEADMALE:Really? What did he do?
LEADFEMALE:He died.
OTHERFEMALE:But the point is, first impressions can last forever.
SUPFEMALE:You be careful tonight.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about me, I'll be myself.
OTHERFEMALE:Let the charm take care of it for me.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think that's such a good idea.
LEADMALE:Your charm is kind of an acquired taste.
LEADFEMALE:Like liver.
SUPFEMALE:You hate liver.
LEADMALE:Exactly.
LEADMALE:So, what? What, are you saying I shouldn't be myself? Let me just leave you alone with your thoughts.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:So that's still a possibility?
LEADMALE:A very strong one, honey.
SUPMALE:We have to do something about Dad.
LEADMALE:I've tried, but he likes that shirt.
LEADMALE:I mean we have to discourage this whole early retirement thing.
LEADFEMALE:You were all for it.
LEADMALE:I was, but I've been thinking, if Dad has more time I'm the one he'll be spending it with.
OTHERMALE:His favorite what? His favorite child, his little girl.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it was obvious.
SUPMALE:Well, think again, little sister.
OTHERMALE:You are not Dad's favorite.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, Ashley, I am.
SUPFEMALE:You? Hey, it's a known fact that the oldest is always the favorite.
SUPMALE:Mom and Dad got it right the first time.
LEADFEMALE:Then why did they keep trying? Well, you're both wrong.
SUPFEMALE:It's me.
LEADMALE:I make him money.
SUPFEMALE:And Daddy's little girl doesn't mean beans next to a chip off the old block which is me.
LEADFEMALE:And Nicky.
SUPFEMALE:Nicky's only been around a few years, Daddy hardly knows him.
SUPMALE:It's me.
LEADFEMALE:A simple way to find out.
SUPFEMALE:Dad's will.
LEADMALE:Whoever gets the most wins.
SUPFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:More money doesn't mean more love.
SUPFEMALE:We're all his children, right? Don't know, I'm starting to think you were adopted.
OTHERMALE:Let's find that will.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, listen, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Wilkes, I want you to order anything that you want.
SUPMALE:Price is no object.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, I heard you the first six times.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You know, they're known for their lemon soup.
OTHERFEMALE:Sir, that's a finger bowl.
SUPMALE:Oh, my fault, my fault.
SUPMALE:Excellent.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know about this place.
LEADFEMALE:See, I'm more of a pizza guy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, they got pizza.
OTHERMALE:What do you want on it? What, a tandoori duck? Grilled pheasant? For 24 bucks, I want a 20-dollar bill on it.
LEADFEMALE: He said That is so It was fu So Lisa says you're an automotive technician.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not.
LEADMALE:I fix cars.
OTHERFEMALE:I manage a garage.
LEADMALE:A garage.
LEADMALE:Wow, that is so interesting.
LEADMALE:No, it's not.
LEADMALE:It's a job.
SUPMALE:Hey, but I like working with my hands.
SUPFEMALE:It gives me the feeling I'm earning my money instead of having it just handed to me.
LEADFEMALE: I know the feeling.
SUPFEMALE: No, you don't.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, Lisa may like you but personally, I think you're a bourgie little toad.
SUPMALE:Thank you for a wonderful evening.
LEADFEMALE:I'll catch a bus back to Lisa's.
OTHERMALE:Don't leave.
SUPFEMALE:This is This is not the real me.
LEADMALE:This is Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Why you putting on airs, boy? Look, please? I like your daughter more than any other girl that I've ever been with.
OTHERFEMALE:And believe me, I've been with Out of girlfriend for a long time.
LEADMALE:Listen, I just wanted to make a good impression on you.
SUPMALE:Well, look, as long as we're being honest with each other I wasn't going to like you no matter how you acted.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, why not? Ever since the good Lord took my Yvonne my life's been pretty empty, Will, except for Lisa.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a little overprotective.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? The real Will Smith ain't bourgie.
SUPMALE:I'm telling you, he's a low-class working stiff like yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Even lower.
SUPMALE: Hoo! Hey, I tell you what, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we get out of this joint and introduce me to the real Will Smith? Sounds good to me.
LEADFEMALE:Say, baby, you seen the real Will Smith? 
LEADMALE:Where did you learn to do this? The Young Republicans sponsored a seminar.
LEADFEMALE:Open sesame.
LEADMALE:It's full of gold bars.
SUPMALE:Those are Twinkies.
LEADMALE:Hello, legal docs.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes.
OTHERMALE:I see someone's coming into money.
LEADMALE:We weren't taking any money.
LEADFEMALE:I meant me.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Geoffrey, what will it cost to keep you quiet? Considering the magnitude of this betrayal of your father's trust I'd say a thousand dollars.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's cool, we can handle that.
SUPFEMALE:No problem.
OTHERFEMALE:A week.
LEADMALE:If you'll excuse me, I have to wash some dirty laundry.
OTHERMALE:He has no scruples.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up and close the safe.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Oh, baby.
SUPMALE:Hey, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:How was the game?
OTHERMALE:Oh, girl, it was the bomb.
SUPMALE:Check out this here fly jacket your daddy got me.
SUPMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:How come? My little way of saying thanks for such a wonderful visit.
SUPMALE:I got one for you too, baby.
LEADMALE:Oh, just what I wanted.
LEADMALE:Hey, I better go check on my flight time.
OTHERMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Ah! No.
SUPMALE:Not that I mind, but what was that for? Hm.
SUPFEMALE:Because you've been so nice to my dad.
SUPFEMALE:You spent more time with him than I have.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, trust me, I am exhausted.
OTHERMALE:Hey, let me tell you.
LEADFEMALE:Your father followed me on my jog today, then he showed up in my lit class.
LEADFEMALE:Last thing I ever waan to do again is see a naked middle-aged man in the shower.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you that now.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you.
SUPMALE:Your dad is a great guy, but I'm kind of happy he's leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me about it.
LEADFEMALE:I love when he comes to visit but we haven't spent any time alone in a whole week.
SUPMALE:Well, I think I can remedy that situation.
SUPMALE:There's a 747 with his name written all over it.
SUPFEMALE:Soon as we get him to the airport we can get back to my crib for a little one-on-one.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean? You know what I'm saying? Well, my flight's on time.
LEADFEMALE:It was nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:You too.
SUPMALE:Take care of my little girl.
SUPFEMALE:You got that.
LEADMALE:It was so good to see you again.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, you know what? Too bad you got to leave.
SUPMALE:You mean that?
LEADMALE:We had a ball.
LEADFEMALE:It's a shame you can't stay longer.
SUPFEMALE:If that's the way you feel, O.
OTHERMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Okay what? I'll stay.
OTHERFEMALE:Stay where? I'll stay with you for another week, maybe two.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, the way things are going, I might stay forever.
OTHERMALE: You cannot be serious about moving out here.
SUPMALE:I'm saying, won't you miss Cleveland? You've never been there, have you? Besides, this city makes me feel alive.
OTHERFEMALE:And my little girl is here, and you, Will.
LEADMALE:Man, you're like the son I never had.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Daddy, remember Craig? Craig's too busy with his marriage and two kids.
LEADMALE:He has no time for his old man.
LEADMALE:What do you say we celebrate with a nice dinner tonight, huh? My treat.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I kind of have plans for tonight.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what about you, Will?
LEADMALE:Oh, I'd love to, you know
OTHERMALE:Then great, pick me up at 7.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to take a nice nap, so I'll be rested up for my big night with Will.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:Whoo.
LEADMALE:Your brother's not busy, he's hiding.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, this is your fault.
LEADMALE:You are just too damn lovable.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, there's a character flaw.
LEADMALE:You have to do something, otherwise we'll end up spending the rest of our lives playing one-on-one-on-one.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe Daddy's password is some kind of food.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I tried every dish in Geoffrey's cookbook, nothing works.
SUPFEMALE:Unbelievable.
SUPMALE:What kind of idiot picks a password no one can guess? See, it's that kind of question that knocks you out of the running for Dad's favorite.
OTHERMALE:Just keep a lookout.
LEADMALE:I told you this whole idea was stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Can you put disk back in the safe before Dad catches us? Too late.
SUPFEMALE:Do you even know what the word "lookout" means? Daddy, I am so sorry.
SUPMALE:Let's settle this right now.
LEADFEMALE:Look, big guy Sir we just wanted to see what was in your will.
OTHERMALE:I knew it.
OTHERMALE:Never should've let you play with those Menendez boys.
LEADMALE:Daddy, we just wanted to know who your favorite child was.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you would even ask.
OTHERMALE:See, it is me.
SUPFEMALE:Right now, it's hard to love any one of you, but I do.
OTHERFEMALE:Ashley, I love your sensitivity, your warmth.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, I love your ambition and your persistence.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary.
LEADMALE:Hilary.
LEADMALE:Yes, Daddy?
LEADMALE:Nice earrings.
LEADMALE:Oh, Daddy.
SUPMALE:I love Nicky's innocence and his enthusiasm.
SUPMALE:I love you all differently, but equally.
LEADFEMALE:Do you understand? Daddy, that was beautiful.
SUPMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:Okay, they're gone now.
SUPFEMALE: 69 BOYZ

LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I'm a little uncomfortable in here.
SUPMALE:What would my pastor say if he saw me in this place? Probably say, "Hey, Fred, you got change for a 20?"  
LEADMALE:Welcome to Caufield's, gentlemen, follow me.
LEADMALE:I got a little somethin'- somethin' for you, girl.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh! Whoo.

LEADFEMALE:I don't know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't say nothing, lay back, cool out, get your groove on.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? Ooh-ooh! Whoo!  Hey, shake it, but don't break it.
LEADMALE:Ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh! Excuse me, Reverend Fred, it's nice to see you coming out of your shell.
LEADMALE:Will, I was wrong, man, this is just good clean fun.
LEADMALE:These girls are trying to earn a dollar like me except I work with my hands and they work with everything else.
LEADMALE:Well, come up on the stage, man.
SUPMALE:Ooh-ooh!  JANET 
LEADMALE:Nasty, nasty boys Don't ever change Oh, Lisa, Lisa, baby.

LEADMALE:Daddy, tonight Will is taking me out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPMALE:Hold up a second there, Fred.
OTHERFEMALE:Lisa, I'm breaking our date tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me? Did it ever occur to you I might wanna see this game more than I wanna see you? I was looking forward to our date tonight.
LEADMALE:Look, look, here, woman, okay? I'm the man, and as the man, I said I'm gonna see the game.
LEADMALE:How dare you disrespect me in front of my father.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, now, this is between you kids.

SUPMALE:Whether you like it or not, I'm going.
SUPMALE:You know what? Blow our date off tonight you can forget about us.

OTHERMALE:Well, maybe I just will forget then.
OTHERMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Now, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:I can't believe what I'm hearing.
SUPMALE:Maybe you should do something.
LEADFEMALE:You're damn right I should.
OTHERMALE:Shame on you.
LEADMALE:Don't you see how important this game is? How can you be so unreasonable? I raised you better.
LEADMALE:You really disappoint me, young lady.
OTHERMALE:You really disappoint me.
SUPMALE:See you later, buddy.
LEADMALE:You know what? That's it, I can't take this no longer.
LEADFEMALE:I got to do it tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Do what? Break up with your father.
LEADFEMALE:Good, game hasn't started.

SUPFEMALE:See you in a sec.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADMALE:Man, I was starting to get worried.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nothing, nothing, everything's fine.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's not.
SUPMALE:I can see it in your eyes.
LEADFEMALE:There's something you're not telling me.
LEADMALE:You're right, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:I can't go on pretending anymore.
LEADMALE:This just isn't working out.
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? You, me, us, this whole thing.
LEADMALE:It was great in the beginning but I just think we need to stop seeing so much of each other.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, is it something I did?
LEADFEMALE:Will, I can change.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:No, it's not you, Fred.
LEADFEMALE:It's me.
LEADMALE:It's me.
SUPMALE:I haven't been straight up with you.
SUPFEMALE:There's someone else.
SUPMALE:Oh, who is he? He's right over there.
LEADMALE:He taught me everything I know about sports.
LEADFEMALE:He's generous.
OTHERMALE:He's caring.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, I'm sure he's a great guy.
LEADMALE:I guess I should be grateful for you at least being honest with me.
SUPMALE:Maybe I should give you this back.
LEADMALE:No, no, I want you to keep it.
LEADMALE:To remember the game.
LEADFEMALE:I will, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's been fun.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, it's definitely been fun.
LEADMALE:Hey, you be well.
LEADFEMALE:You too, Will.
LEADMALE:Can I call you? I don't think that would be such a good idea.
SUPFEMALE:Well, at least, not right at first.
LEADMALE:You're a very lucky man.
LEADMALE: I talked to my dad today.
SUPFEMALE:No, he's staying in Cleveland, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:He's been spending a lot of time with my brother.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't take him long to forget about me, huh? He did not forget about you.
SUPMALE:As a matter of fact, he wanted me to give you a message.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not sure I understand it.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Same game, next season.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, tell him it's on.
LEADMALE:Oh, look.
LEADMALE:There's a shooting star.
LEADMALE:Make a wish.
SUPFEMALE:Don't need to.
LEADFEMALE:You already came true.
