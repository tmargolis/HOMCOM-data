LEADMALE:I'm sorry to hear that, Hector.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, now, kids, you remember Hector.
SUPMALE:I'll remember him now! Sweetheart, before you were born, we used to live here.

LEADMALE:Well, we didn't have a lot, but we always had enough to eat
SUPMALE:thanks to Hector.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Even if you didn't have any money, you had all the food you needed long as he liked you.
LEADFEMALE:I guess y'all was in love then, huh, Uncle Phil? So, Perry Mason, how is the crusading business coming, man? Are you still fighting for little guys like me? Well, I'm still fighting, but it's corporate mergers mostly.
LEADFEMALE:So you're not working out of a little storefront anymore? Well, no, my office has gotten a little bit bigger but it's just a few miles from here.
SUPFEMALE:You work in Beverly Hills, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Beverly Hills.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Curly, that's terrific! Hey, maybe now you can pay me back for some of those Ring Dings? He ain't doing that well.
LEADFEMALE:Hector, I just cannot believe our old apartment went up in flames.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, there's been a lot of changes since you've been gone.
LEADFEMALE:It's still nice to have you back.
SUPMALE:Well, look, I'll be downstairs.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? I never gave you kids a wedding present.
LEADMALE:Best of luck, huh? You know, Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, I used to love coming out here to visit y'all.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Ashley, check this out.
SUPFEMALE:This is where Aunt Viv used to measure how tall we was getting.
SUPMALE:Look, here's me.
LEADFEMALE:Will, there's you.
LEADMALE:Look, there's Carlton.
LEADMALE:You know, Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, there was a lot of love shared in this room.
LEADMALE:Don't even think about kissing me.
LEADMALE:Hilary, time to set the table.
LEADMALE:Baby, why are you throwing your doll in the garbage? Well, I tried flushing her down the toilet, but the little creep floats.
LEADFEMALE:I want a new doll.
OTHERMALE:Baby, it's all we can afford right now.
OTHERMALE:With all the free legal aid your daddy gives we're barely covering expenses but there are more important things in life than fancy clothes and big houses.
OTHERMALE:What have you been smoking? Yo, Uncle Phil, how you going to play a nephew? On his behind, Will.
SUPFEMALE:That honey was about to invite me up for some milk and cookies.
SUPFEMALE:That honey was old enough to be your mother.
OTHERFEMALE:Word up, and she was divorced, too.
LEADFEMALE:Parents just don't understand.
LEADMALE:Hey, big guy, got time to read me a bedtime story? Sure, Carlton, what's it going to be? Cat /n The Hat or Curious George? No, The Wa// Street Journa/, the part where AMC goes belly up.
LEADMALE:Are you sure we're all related? Mom, Dad, I've been thinking it over and I've decided what I want to be when I grow up.
SUPFEMALE:What, tall?
LEADFEMALE:That's nice, honey, what?
LEADFEMALE:President of the United States.
SUPMALE:Well, that would make me very proud, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Imagine, my son, the country's first black president.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm black? Hello? One second, please.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, it's Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Firth from the law firm.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Firth? Yes.
LEADMALE:I would love to meet with the other partners.
LEADMALE:Next Thursday is great.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:All right, hold it now.
LEADMALE:Don't want to get anybody's hopes up but Mr.
LEADMALE:Firth wants me to come back for a second interview.
SUPFEMALE:I'm rich! I'm rich! I'll pack our bags.
LEADMALE:Maybe we can get a place close to the Reagans.
SUPFEMALE:Did I ever tell you folks how much I like visiting? Hold on, now.
SUPMALE:Hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Now look even if I do get this job, nothing changes.
LEADMALE:This is our home and this community is a part of our family.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll never turn my back on it.
LEADMALE:We had some good times in this old place.
OTHERMALE:We sure did, baby.
LEADMALE:Our roots are here.
OTHERMALE:This is where we started our family.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, I wonder if that divorced lady still live here? She probably like 127 or something y eah, and we made some very good friends here.
LEADMALE:But we haven't fulfilled our commitment to them or to this place.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you know, Uncle Phil, I think I will come back you know, next weekend.
OTHERFEMALE:Hook up with my man Noah, set up a schedule.
LEADMALE:Yes, I think I'll hook up with Simone and make out a little schedule of my own.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go sign up for next week.
LEADMALE:So, the house will be empty next week? Great! I'm going to plan a party.
LEADMALE:I guess you're really disappointed in me, huh, Vivian?
LEADMALE:Why?
LEADMALE:'Cause I sold out.
LEADFEMALE:Did everything I said I wouldn't do.
SUPFEMALE:Became a high-powered lawyer bought that house in Bel-Air, and never looked back.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, honey, you shouldn't feel guilty about your success.
OTHERMALE:Baby, nobody gave you anything.
LEADMALE:You have worked hard for everything you've got.
LEADFEMALE:You've been generous and you've contributed to a lot of causes.
LEADFEMALE:It takes more than just writing a check.
LEADMALE:I've lost myself, I've lost my fire, my passion.
LEADMALE:You're right, Vivian, I have become dull and predictable.
LEADFEMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:I want to be the kind of man you fell in love with.
SUPFEMALE:I want to be open to risks, I want to take chances.
LEADMALE:Oh, Philip, do you mean it? Do you? I'm afraid it's too late.
LEADMALE:I've chased you away.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, what are you talking about? I know where you were yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:You're having an affair.
LEADFEMALE:I don't blame you, I'm just going to kill you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no, is that where you thought I was yesterday? What? You mean, you weren't with another man?
SUPMALE:Of course not.
SUPMALE:Lucky for you.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, I was afraid to tell you because I didn't think you could take it.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't think I could take it.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:But now I know you can.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, I was at the doctor's yesterday.
LEADMALE:The doctor's! Philip, I'm pregnant! So you're not working out of a little storefront anymore? Well, no, my office has gotten a little bit bigger and I only And, it's pretty good.
