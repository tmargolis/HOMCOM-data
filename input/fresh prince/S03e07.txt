SUPMALE:What's up, Prince? Me and Carlton just checking out these college brochures.
LEADFEMALE:I've already set my sights on Princeton.
SUPFEMALE:It has a balanced curriculum with the largest repository of classical literature.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, I got my sights set on this school with the largest repository of girls with the big old butts.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah! Which reminds me, I brought your CD player back.
LEADFEMALE:See, Jazz, now this is not my CD player, see 'cause my CD player has the wires on the inside.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, man.
SUPMALE:How can I make it up to you? Jazz, how about paying for it? Why would I want to buy a broken CD player?
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Aunt Viv.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Judge.
LEADMALE:Now, Will, please.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't even announced that I'm running.
SUPMALE:I don't think you'd have to announce it, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:If you ran, we'd hear you coming.
SUPFEMALE:I'm running for Superior Court Judge.
SUPFEMALE:He still could use the exercise.
LEADMALE:Will, Carlton I want you guys to be on your best behavior tomorrow and look presentable.
SUPFEMALE:It's navy-blue jacket, gray slacks, power tie.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, Uncle Phil, you sure you wouldn't want Carlton to wear Aunt Viv's apron? No.
SUPMALE:Oh, Jazz, I need you to bring over my blue jacket.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry, man, I'll have it back to you first thing tomorrow morning.
LEADFEMALE:You won't even be able to tell I wore it.
SUPMALE:Jazz, what did you do to my jacket? You told me to get it cleaned.
SUPFEMALE:So I washed it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe you, man, first my CD player, now this.
LEADFEMALE:You make a doorknob look smart, man.
LEADFEMALE:No need to get testy.
OTHERFEMALE:At least I got out all the A.
SUPMALE:1.
LEADFEMALE:sauce.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, hold up.
OTHERFEMALE:Underdog's on.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, but I'm watching the Eagles.
LEADFEMALE:Well, excuse me but you once preferred the whimsy of a y ogi and a Boo Boo.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I hardly know you.
LEADFEMALE:Will, put on your jacket.
LEADFEMALE:We're leaving for the press luncheon in 10 minutes.
SUPMALE:Hey, have you been undressing my Teddy Ruxpin again?
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, you look so sexy.
SUPMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Now go upstairs and change.
LEADFEMALE:What, don't you want to project the right image? Hey, I'm happy that this fits over my belly.
LEADFEMALE:Which reminds me, I'm hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Viv Daddy? I am a young adult, and I have my rights.
OTHERFEMALE:If you force me to wear this, I'II I'll hold my breath until my face turns blue.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, you're 13 years old, you'll do what I say.
LEADFEMALE:But that's not fair.
LEADMALE:Call a cop.
LEADMALE:Mommy! Well, I'm ready.
SUPMALE:I've been waiting all my life to hear you say that.
LEADMALE:I meant, I'm ready for the press conference.
SUPFEMALE:You know, sometimes I lose sight of why I want to be a judge.
LEADFEMALE:Then you open your mouth, and it all comes flooding back.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:See, Will, I inspire him.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, not yet.
LEADMALE:Not now, Jazz.
LEADMALE:Oh, no! No, you're on the one-yard line! Fumble? Herschel, pick it up! Well, it's painfully obvious that my presence is no longer required.
LEADMALE:Here, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Eventually, you'll grow into it.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, sir, but how's your day been going so far?
LEADFEMALE:Well, wonderful, Geoffrey, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, down the toilet it goes.
LEADFEMALE:Judge Robertson, what are you doing here, sir? Philip, it's good to see you again, my boy.
SUPFEMALE:How long has it 
OTHERFEMALE:10, 15 years?
SUPFEMALE:We just had dinner a few weeks ago, sir.
LEADMALE:We did? Did I leave here with my pants on? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank God.
LEADMALE:But that means you must throw a lousy party.
SUPFEMALE:But enough about you, Philip.
SUPMALE:Look, Philip, you got to help me.
LEADMALE:You're the only one I can trust.
LEADMALE:I just heard that they found someone to run against me.
OTHERFEMALE:Judge, we discussed that over dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I'm running against you.
OTHERFEMALE:What? How dare you! Get out of my house! Out! Lionel, show him the door.
LEADFEMALE:Go, go, go, touchdown! Will, Will.
LEADMALE:Put that thing away.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, they just tied it up.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care.
SUPMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Banks.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
SUPFEMALE:And welcome to this afternoon's press conference.
OTHERFEMALE:It is my pleasure to introduce to you Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Philip Banks.
OTHERMALE:Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the press and thank you very much for coming.
LEADMALE:I'd like to take this opportunity to formally announce my candidacy for the office of Superior Court Judge.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I plan on restoring faith in the judicial system.
SUPMALE:And I ask 
SUPMALE:Do you really want six more years of the same tired plea-bargaining? Yes, yes! What? Judge Robertson has been in office six straight terms how do you intend to break that streak? By focusing on the issues and not personality.
OTHERMALE:Once the voters see where I stand, I'm sure I'll win this election.
LEADFEMALE:You idiot, you don't even deserve to sit on the bench.
LEADMALE:What? Judge Robertson.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know he had kids.
LEADMALE:He doesn't.
LEADMALE:And that's not his wife.
LEADMALE:And am I crazy or does he look 10 years younger? That's unbelievable.
LEADMALE:Is that brisket I smell?
LEADFEMALE:Lovely family.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Who are they?
OTHERMALE:Rented.
LEADMALE:Judge Robertson, how does it feel to be running against your own student? Philip Banks is a gentleman and one of the smartest students I ever had.
LEADMALE:A man who would bring honor to the bench.
OTHERMALE:Don't get me wrong, I want the job.
SUPMALE:But I can't think of another person that I would mind losing to but this man here.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, my son.
SUPFEMALE:What a guy.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks, what's your response? Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Banks, we're looking for your nephew, a William Smith.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:It's over, it's all over.
SUPFEMALE:Are you Will Smith? No, Rahjim Shabaz, Muslim activist.
LEADFEMALE:Sa/aam a/aikum.
LEADMALE:Will, what's wrong? You're under arrest, Shabaz.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, Smith.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay, it's like that, right? All right.
OTHERFEMALE:It's cool.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna sit down.
OTHERMALE:All right, I'm sitting down right here.
LEADFEMALE:And you think that just 'cause you got that badge and all your tough cop friends walking around and your cute little walkie-talkie that you can talk to folks any old way you want to do it.
LEADMALE:Well, I tell you right now, if you ain't have all that stuff we'd be squawking a different language up in here right now.
LEADFEMALE:What are you trying to say? I think I made myself real clear when I said what I just said.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess you did.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Officer, your stuff fell off.
OTHERFEMALE:Hip-hop cop.
OTHERMALE:Blue looks nice on you, too.
LEADMALE:Match that big blue vein throbbing in your neck right now.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Philip Banks, the boy's attorney.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like to speak to my nephew alone, please.
LEADMALE:What's up now, tough guy?
LEADFEMALE:No problem, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:I guess we told him, right, Uncle Phil?
SUPFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPMALE:Will, how could you get $2,000 worth of parking tickets when I told you to get rid of that car months ago? Actually, I did get rid of it.
SUPMALE:See, I gave it to a friend.
SUPMALE:Look, I swear to you, Uncle Phil there ain't no way I got them parking tickets.
LEADMALE:Look at the printout.
SUPFEMALE:Huh? "Snuffy's Chicken Shack, Big Ben's Barbeque "Alice's All Nude Review.
SUPFEMALE:" What do you call this? One hell of a Friday night.
OTHERFEMALE:Can I see that, Uncle Phil? Wait a minute, Uncle Phil, these are all Jazz's hangouts.
LEADMALE:He must have gotten all these parking tickets.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious.
OTHERFEMALE:I told him I'd kill him.
OTHERFEMALE:How could he go to Alice's All Nude Review without me? Well, hello, Philip, my boy.
LEADMALE:Welcome to City Hall.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Will, wait in the car and don't even touch the steering wheel.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Judge.
SUPFEMALE:Judge.
LEADFEMALE:Judge, check it out.
LEADMALE:Look, brother ran into a little misfortune.
LEADFEMALE:Right? I got like $2,000 worth of parking tickets.
LEADFEMALE:I was just wondering, I don't know, maybe you might be able to do a I thought he was selling condoms.
SUPMALE:I apologize for my nephew, Judge.
LEADMALE:And I hope this little incident didn't cause any undue embarrassment.
SUPFEMALE:I mean
LEADMALE:the press is going to have a field day.
LEADMALE:Well, I certainly hope so.
SUPFEMALE:This is just the beginning.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I was browsing through the police files and bingo, up pops your nephew's name.
SUPMALE:Parking tickets up the ying-yang.
OTHERFEMALE:So I busted his bony butt.
SUPMALE:Pretty good, huh?
LEADMALE:Excuse me?
SUPMALE:Oh, wake up, knucklehead.
LEADMALE:You're in the big leagues now.
SUPMALE:I may be old, I may be senile and I haven't been able to find my car for the past half hour but I can beat your butt in a political campaign any day.
OTHERFEMALE:You're dead meat, Tiny.
LEADMALE:I always knew Will would be the downfall of this family.
LEADMALE:But no one ever listens to me.
SUPMALE:What, honey? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Will being arrested means we're all going to be investigated.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, this is how they knocked off Imelda Marcos.
LEADMALE:I'll just die if they touch my shoes.
LEADMALE:I'd die if you made your own bed.
LEADFEMALE:Get off me, man, just get off me.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, thank you.
SUPMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:I'm so glad you're home.
OTHERMALE:Carlton said you were probably doing 5 to 10 by now.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right, sweetheart?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I'm fine, Aunt Viv.
OTHERMALE:Well, good, now I can break your legs.
LEADMALE:Vivian, Vivian, I'll handle this.
LEADFEMALE:Now we have to make a statement for the press.
LEADMALE:So put on an apron, grab the cookie jar.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:And I ate all the cookies before lunch.
SUPMALE:Okay, okay, then we'll have to grab the cutest kid.
LEADMALE:Ashley, you'll do.
SUPMALE:Come on, smile, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go, Vivian, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you ready to talk to us now? Man, this has been the worst day of my life.
LEADMALE:And as soon as I see Jazz, I'm going to make it the worst day of his.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you seem embittered.
LEADMALE:Jail will do that to a man.
SUPFEMALE:Now that you've done hard time, a book may be in order.
LEADMALE:Criminals sell.
OTHERFEMALE:I can sell criminals.
OTHERMALE:You're a criminal.
LEADMALE:Really? And you're too short to ride the teacup ride at Disneyland.
LEADMALE:What's up, Will? Man, what's with all the reporters? I ain't seen no chalk outlines or nothing.
LEADFEMALE:That's 'cause I didn't murder you yet.
SUPMALE:What's got your BVDs in a bunch? Well, for starters, you ruined the most important day in my uncle's life.
SUPFEMALE:Haagen-Dazs opened in Bel-Air? Jazz, I trusted you with my ride over the summer and you got $2,000 worth of parking tickets.
LEADMALE:And you didn't even tell me.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, I should have told you.
LEADMALE:Will, I got $2,000 worth of parking tickets.
LEADFEMALE:What do you plan to do about that, Jazz?
LEADFEMALE:I'll take care of it, man.
SUPMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:Can I borrow $2,000? This is not a joke, man.
SUPMALE:I trusted you, Jazz.
OTHERFEMALE:I trusted you, and you got me tossed into jail.
LEADMALE:Friends don't do that to each other, man.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, friends are supposed to be there for each other.
LEADFEMALE:Friends aren't supposed to set you up to take a fall.
SUPFEMALE:And most importantly, friends are supposed to be honest with each other.
LEADFEMALE:And you obviously don't fit that mold.
LEADFEMALE:So from this point on, you can consider our friendship over.
OTHERFEMALE:You're no longer welcome in this house.
OTHERFEMALE:And I'd appreciate it if you just got the hell out of my crib.
LEADMALE:Ain't you going to even bother to throw me out? You're not worth it, man.
LEADMALE:Hey, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Will.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey G, you want to go watch some Underdog? Why, do I look like a moron? Banks residence.
LEADFEMALE:G, look, if that's Jazz, tell him I do not want to talk to him.
LEADMALE:It's for me.
LEADMALE:It's my accountant.
LEADMALE:So what are you wearing? Hey, Carlton, man, how about we shoot down to The Wing King, man get a big bucket of ribs? Do I look like Jimmie Walker? Forget you then, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:I just got the new video boxing.
SUPMALE:Come on, you want to play? Sorry, homey, homework.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Hil, you want to No, Will, I don't want ribs, I don't want to wax your ride and I don't even know what a Chumpy is.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:It's like that, right? It's like that.
LEADFEMALE:Y'all going to flee me like that, right? My suggestion to you, my despondent, desperate, ne'er-do-well cousin is to make amends with your partner in delinquency.
LEADMALE:What? Call him, Will.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure Jazz is sorry.
OTHERMALE:Why should I call him after what he did to me? You know, forget it.
LEADMALE:I don't need him.
OTHERMALE:I don't need you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't need nobody.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to get up to my room, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I don't want no trouble.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right, Will, I'm not mad anymore.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God, Philip, look at this.
LEADFEMALE:What? It's all in the paper.
LEADFEMALE:They got a picture of me throwing a reporter in the pool.
LEADMALE:What a wonderful way to start my campaign.
SUPFEMALE:My nephew gets arrested.
SUPFEMALE:My wife looks like y ou look wonderful, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Actually, Aunt Viv, you got a, kind of a homicidal, sumo-wrestler thing going.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, but you working it, girl.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing here? I was out for my morning constitutional and I must have walked farther than I thought.
LEADFEMALE:But since I'm here, bean pie for all.
LEADFEMALE:You know, just my way of saying y ou know.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's very nice, Jazz.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you two want to be alone.
SUPMALE:I don't get it, Philip, why did he give us a bean pie? What am I, Freud? Grab a fork, Vivian.
SUPMALE:Well I guess I ought to be going.
SUPFEMALE:You probably got college applications to fill out.
SUPMALE:Well, yeah, actually, I do.
SUPFEMALE:You probably want to hang out with educated people who drink their malt liquor in a glass.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about, Jazz? Face it, Will.
LEADMALE:You're going to go off to college to be somebody and I'm going to be stuck here living foot to mouth.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you mean hand to mouth, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Don't try to impress me with your fancy education.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to go off next year to some big old college and I'll be sitting here by the phone waiting for you to call.
SUPMALE:You're not making any sense, Jazz.
LEADMALE:You used to think that was cute.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You mean this whole thing is about me going off to college? Oh, comes the dawn.
SUPMALE:My mother told me you was no good.
SUPMALE:I knew I should have listened to her.
SUPFEMALE:See, I promised myself I wasn't going to cry.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, come on, Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:Get your hands off of me.
LEADMALE:I'm not a faucet to be turned on and off at your whim.
LEADMALE:I have emotions.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz, yes, it's true that I'm going off to college, man, but Come on, you like family to me.
OTHERMALE:Jazz, just 'cause somebody moves away from the family that doesn't mean they break up.
SUPMALE:That just means that, you know, the family has to work harder to stay together.
LEADMALE:You understand what I'm saying? No.
SUPMALE:But at least you talking to me.
LEADMALE:Come on, Jazz, you know you're always going to be my homey.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you say that in the first place? I did say that.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you clean out your ears? Now, I know you ain't talking about nobody's ears.
OTHERMALE:Hey, come on, man, let's jet down to the mall, pick up some Chumpies.
LEADFEMALE:Will, could you do one thing for me? You know, just for old time's sake.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, no problem, man.
LEADMALE:Jazz, I trusted you with my ride over the summer and you got me tossed I mean shoot.
SUPMALE:I said, "shoot," Mom.
SUPFEMALE:"I raised my boy better than that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God.
LEADMALE:
