OTHERFEMALE:Well, how do I look? Whoa, man.
SUPFEMALE:You know that model in all them Hugo Boss ads?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You don't look nothing like him.
SUPFEMALE:You're just jealous because the love of my life has returned.
LEADMALE:In Cindy, I have found the woman I'd share the rest of my life with.
OTHERFEMALE:You've never even found a woman you'd share a burrito with.
OTHERMALE:Earth to Carlton, but Cindy dumped you, man.
LEADMALE:She didn't dump me, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:She was just working through a fear of intimacy caused by an overpowering father and a narcissistic mother.
LEADFEMALE:Sure it wasn't your breath? Oh, look, hors d'oeuvres.
LEADMALE:Isn't it great to be rich? Hands off.
SUPMALE:They're for Cindy.
LEADFEMALE:Cindy? Isn't she the one who dumped you? Carlton, why are you wearing a suit? Is Daddy bringing home white people?
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Cindy's coming over.
SUPMALE:Cindy? I thought she dumped you.
SUPMALE:Okay, okay, she dumped me but now that she's back, I'm not gonna let her go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna prove to her that I'm ready for an adult, mature relationship.
LEADMALE:Door! Door! Door! All right, don't wet yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:God, I'm a wreck.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton.
LEADMALE:Cindy.
LEADMALE:I have something that belongs to you.
LEADMALE:Say hello to Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:G, hurry up with that water, man.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, wake up.
LEADMALE:Now, come on, man.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations, man.
SUPMALE:He's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, come on, man.
LEADMALE:Carlton, a father? He won't even let Ken and Barbie sleep in the same shoebox.
LEADFEMALE:You and Cindy? I mean, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, the longest relationship Carlton ever had was with last year's Ebony swimsuit issue.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't a joke.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, doesn't he look just like Carlton? Well, it looks like they wear the same size.
SUPFEMALE:Can I hold him?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, here you are.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, he is so cute.
SUPMALE:Oh! Get this drool machine away from me.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, can I? Thank you.
LEADMALE:What up, dude? Boy, when Mom and Dad see this, somebody's gonna swing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I can assure you, it won't be me.
SUPFEMALE:This time, the butler didn't do it hasn't done it and I'd be surprised if he even remembered how to do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Philip, I am never wearing a bathing suit again, as long as I live.
LEADFEMALE:Now, honey, I'm sure the pool man didn't really mistake you for me.
LEADMALE:He called me Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:That's still no reason to hold his head underwater, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:I'll get you some antacid for that.
SUPMALE:No, don't.
LEADFEMALE:That wasn't me.
LEADFEMALE:Cindy.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:And Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Banks.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:How long has it been? Well, I'd take a shot in the dark and say around nine months.
LEADFEMALE:Whose is that? He's mine.
SUPMALE:Oh, my goodness.
LEADMALE:He's adorable.
LEADMALE:Come here, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Oh, my.
OTHERMALE:What's his name? Carlton.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Please tell me your father's first name is Carlton.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, wrong answer.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, for those of you just tuning in to Name That Father this little bundle of joy belongs to a young man who's seen Litt/e Mermaid eight times.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton are you the father? Excuse me.
OTHERMALE:Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton!
LEADFEMALE:Vivian.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Back off, Philip.
OTHERFEMALE:I am having a mother-son moment.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, how could you do this to us?
LEADMALE:Vivian, step away from the boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, look, we're going to have to talk about this in private.
SUPFEMALE:Not you, stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Sit your butt down.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'll take care of this, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that's it.
SUPFEMALE:Move it along, party's over.
SUPMALE:Nothing to see here.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Pep it up, little grey man.
LEADMALE:Man, I thought they'd never leave.
LEADMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:Phil.
SUPMALE:All right, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm just gonna Look, I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
SUPMALE:Sweetheart, you show up here with a baby that you say is my son's and you didn't mean to cause any trouble.
LEADMALE:Where do you think you are, Fantasy /s/and? Watch out how you talk to the mother of my son.
SUPMALE:Sir.
LEADMALE:Carlton, do you realize what you're saying? He is Carlton's baby.
SUPMALE:I'll believe that when I see a blood test.
SUPFEMALE:It's the truth, whether you want to believe it or not.
LEADFEMALE:I love Carlton.
SUPMALE:Really? Yes.
LEADMALE:And I'll tell you something else.
LEADMALE:Carlton is the most incredible lover I have ever had.
LEADMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERMALE:I mean, he's so in tune with my needs.
LEADFEMALE:It was amazing, and endless, and magnificent.
OTHERMALE:I think I saw God.
LEADMALE:The windows.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I fell.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't mean to.
LEADFEMALE:I fell.
LEADMALE:I fell.
SUPMALE:Carlton, I am so disappointed in you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, why didn't you come to us first? Honey, we could have counseled you.
LEADMALE:Or at least had you neutered.
LEADFEMALE:Cindy, honey, I don't understand.
SUPMALE:If you knew this was Carlton's son, why did you leave? Because I knew that a baby could ruin his life but I did feel that he deserved to see his son and that's why I came.
LEADMALE:Thank you for stopping by.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:Cindy, honey, I think we need to talk to your parents about this.
LEADMALE:That won't do any good.
LEADFEMALE:They don't want to have anything to do with me.
LEADMALE:They threw you out? Where are you going to stay? Mommy?
SUPMALE:Well, you could stay with us.
SUPFEMALE:No! At least, until after the blood test.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't impose.
LEADMALE:Oh, we understand.
SUPMALE:You know, I hear Ramada Inn has a wonderful pool.
OTHERFEMALE:Cindy, please stay.
SUPMALE:We want you to, okay? Carlton will show you to the guest room and there's no need to wake the baby.
SUPMALE:You know it's like the Rodney King videotape, you know? I just keep seeing it over, and over, and over again.
LEADMALE:And I ask myself, where did I fail him, you know? Where did we go wrong? Hey, Mom, guess who? No, it's Will.
LEADMALE:Will Smith.
SUPMALE:Hey, yo, Mom, check it out.
LEADMALE:It is some drama cutting loose out here.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm not in trouble, but, no, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody we know is a grandma.
LEADMALE:No, not you, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:No, Mom.
SUPMALE:Mom, stop crying.
OTHERFEMALE:Stop crying.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, no, it's not me.
LEADFEMALE:It's Carlton is the father.
LEADFEMALE:Stop laughing, Mom.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that will be a large pepperoni with extra cheese.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:That makes them bring it faster.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the phone, Will.
LEADMALE:This time Cindy's parents are going to talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, honey, just be calm.
SUPMALE:Now, I'm sure they're lovely people.
SUPFEMALE:Just because they let their daughter run wild and take advantage of our only son and flush his life down the toilet
SUPMALE:Give me the damn phone, Philip.
LEADMALE:Vivian! Vivian, sweetheart, I'll handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, don't you dare try to hang up on me.
LEADMALE:What kind of lowlifes are you throwing a minor out onto the street and endangering a helpless infant? Well, I'm going to do everything I can to see you behind bars.
SUPFEMALE:And what do you have to say for yourself? So when will your mommy and daddy be home? Here we come, ready or not.
OTHERFEMALE:Super, huh? Look, matching hats.
LEADFEMALE:I never knew having a family could be so neat.
LEADMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:I love you, too.
LEADMALE:All right, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to take this opportunity to bring it to everyone's attention that Uncle Phil's head is about to explode and, for once, it ain't my fault.
OTHERMALE:Well, I think it's time for little Carlton's nap.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, it smells like you needs to be changed, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'll miss you, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Miss you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't she something?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, she sure is and Monday, after the blood test proves the baby's not yours she'll be out of here on the first thing smoking.
LEADMALE:Dad, the baby's mine.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, honey, suppose the baby is yours.
SUPMALE:Now, being a teenage parent is a very big responsibility, honey and you have already proven yourself irresponsible otherwise, you wouldn't be in this situation.
SUPFEMALE:How are you going to feed this baby? Where are you going to live? How are you going to educate it? Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You mean, you're not going to take care of us?
LEADFEMALE:Hold me back, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, get out.
LEADMALE:Get out, now.
SUPFEMALE:Go.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I got him, but take another step, and I'll fill you full of potassium.
SUPFEMALE:Master William, might I see you for a moment? Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, G? Well, it's such a beautiful night.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you might like to see the moon.
LEADFEMALE:Go easy on the poor little pinhead.
SUPMALE:Are you climbing down Rapunzel's extensions? I don't want Mom and Dad to know.
SUPMALE:To know what?
SUPMALE:Cindy and I are driving to Lompoc.
LEADFEMALE:No, Carlton, nobody drives to Lompoc.
SUPFEMALE:You drive through Lompoc.
SUPFEMALE:No, but there's a chapel.
LEADMALE:We're eloping.
SUPFEMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:No, Will, I don't want to hear it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm tired of everyone telling me what to do.
LEADMALE:I love Cindy, and I've made up my mind.
SUPMALE:All right, man, fine.
OTHERMALE:Look, whatever you want to do is fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:What? I said, whatever you want to do is fine with me.
SUPFEMALE:If you want to marry Cindy, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Just do me a favor.
SUPFEMALE:Sleep on it tonight.
SUPFEMALE:In the morning, if you feel the same way then, whatever you want to do.
SUPFEMALE:Deal?
SUPMALE:Deal.
OTHERFEMALE:My man.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, give me your car keys.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Will, I gave you my word.
SUPMALE:I'd think that'd be enough.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you lucky I ain't going to do you like Kunta Kinte and chop off your foot.
LEADFEMALE:Your cheesecake, sir.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, would you get Carlton, please?
LEADMALE:Certainly, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Run, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Fetch, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:Perhaps you'd like me to catch a Frisbee in my teeth?
LEADMALE:Hey, y'all.
LEADMALE:Hey, freeze! Just where have you been?
LEADFEMALE:To the refrigerator.
SUPMALE:At this hour? It's 8:00.
SUPMALE:Philip, look at us.
LEADFEMALE:We are really overreacting.
LEADFEMALE:This is Will.
LEADMALE:There's no such thing as overreacting.
SUPFEMALE:Frisk him.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Adolph, Eva, why don't you all relax for a second.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, where's Carlton? I'm sorry, sir, but he's not in his room but the trip wasn't a total loss.
LEADMALE:I found $1.
LEADFEMALE:25 under his bed.
SUPFEMALE:Who knew Christmas would come twice this year? Geoffrey, did you check Cindy's room? The girl hasn't a penny to her name.
OTHERMALE:Will, where's Carlton? I don't know, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Did you check the cracks in the couch? Will, you know something? Come on, Uncle Phil does this look like the face of a dude that knows something? He's got a point there, Vivian.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe we should call Carlton's friends.
LEADMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call one, you call the other.
SUPFEMALE:Number 52.
SUPMALE:Well, we're next, my little bride-to-be.
SUPMALE:Carlton I hope you don't feel like I pressured you into this.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you are glad we're getting married, right? Glad? Cindy, I've been in love with you ever since the third grade.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I used to go to sleep at night and dream about the day we'd be married.
SUPFEMALE:Do you really mean that, Carlton?
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:We're going to have such a wonderful life.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we'll have to live in a trailer at first but I'll get a job during the days, and I'll work nights, too as soon as I lick that pesky fear of the dark thing.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, Carlton, I was thinking that I would get a job, too.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about it.
OTHERFEMALE:No wife of mine is going to have to work.
SUPMALE:I mean, you can stay home and take care of the kids.
LEADMALE:Exactly how many kids? Well, you know what they say, eight is enough.
LEADMALE:Look, Carlton, I need to
OTHERFEMALE:Would you watch the baby for a minute?
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Please, sweetie, please don't cry.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes little Mr.
LEADMALE:Ducky.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't he quack you up? Wow! If I could pass like that, they wouldn't make me play on the girl's team.
LEADMALE:They'll throw us out.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my boy.
LEADFEMALE:"And if there's anyone here "who feels this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony "let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
LEADMALE:" Stop, man, don't do it! You don't even know if the baby is yours!
LEADFEMALE:How did you know I'm having a baby?
LEADFEMALE:What? You having a baby? Yo, hey, look, my fault.
LEADFEMALE:You all, see, my cousin was supposed Hey, congratulations, man.
LEADFEMALE:So you're having his baby? What a wonderful way to say how much I love you, huh? You're too late, Will.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man, you did it? Tell me you didn't do it.
SUPMALE:God, please tell me you didn't marry her.
LEADMALE:I didn't marry her.
SUPMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:You the man.
SUPFEMALE:She left me.
LEADFEMALE:I got the feeling she didn't want to live with me.
LEADFEMALE:What made you think that?
SUPFEMALE:She said she didn't want to live with me.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man, I mean, she can't just walk out on you like that.
SUPFEMALE:What if the kid is yours?
LEADMALE:He's not.
OTHERMALE:Carlton, come on, just because the baby is cute doesn't mean you're not the father.
LEADMALE:I never slept with her.
LEADFEMALE:Look, since we're in a church, I feel the need to confess something.
OTHERFEMALE:Please don't laugh.
LEADFEMALE:This is really hard for me to say.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a y ou a German? No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a virgin.
LEADMALE:What? I'm a virgin! It's nice to know somebody still is.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, Carlton, man, I mean, I didn't know.
SUPMALE:I mean, hey, don't feel bad though.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, a lot of guys are you know, Germans.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I feel so unused.
SUPMALE:I mean, promise me you won't tell anyone.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Carlton, come on, man, you ain't got nothing to be ashamed of.
OTHERMALE:I mean, everybody talks about how much pressure there is on girls to have sex.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there's pressure on us, too.
LEADMALE:That's why we lie about it.
OTHERMALE:You lie about it? You mean you're a virgin, too? Keep your voice down, man.
SUPMALE:I ain't no virgin! Sorry.
SUPMALE:Hey, look, man, when it comes to me and the honeys, I just say no way.
SUPMALE:Yucky.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I'm really gonna miss her.
LEADFEMALE:Where did she go?
OTHERMALE:Back to her parents.
SUPMALE:When she called and told them she was going to marry me they came and got her.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, Carlton, man, they're wrong about you.
LEADMALE:You're a great guy, man.
OTHERMALE:Hey, look, come on.
LEADMALE:Let's go home, so you can get in trouble.
SUPFEMALE:And don't worry about it, man.
LEADFEMALE:I mean one day the right girl's going to come along and, I mean, you won't be a German forever, you know? Good, 'cause I'm really looking forward to losing my accent.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't you dare try to hang up on me.
LEADMALE:Now, who do you think you are? What kind of lowlifes are you people to throw a helpless minor out onto the street with a helpless infant? I'll call you back.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you people, to talk to my uncle like that
OTHERMALE:with a helpless infant
OTHERMALE:Here we go.
SUPMALE:and helpless actors?
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:With all these helpless people.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, here.
LEADMALE:This is it.
SUPMALE:Will somebody please help us? 
LEADMALE:
