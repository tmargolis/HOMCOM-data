OTHERFEMALE:Okay, here we go.
SUPFEMALE:Put down your money, find the honey.
LEADFEMALE:Locate the black queen, and I don't mean Little Richard.
LEADFEMALE:There! Okay, Carlton, you're pretty good for a white guy.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on out here?
SUPFEMALE:I'm cleaning up, Geoffrey.
OTHERMALE:I hope they pay you more than they pay me.
SUPMALE:Seriously, Geoffrey, you should get in on this.
LEADMALE:Do you play the Hell's Kitchen version or the A-train hybrid.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in.
SUPFEMALE:All right, here we go.
LEADMALE:Zagnut, Goobers, Good & Plenty, locate the black girl, you win $20.
LEADFEMALE:That one.
OTHERMALE:Yes! Well, there goes Saturday night at Sizzler.
SUPMALE:I had coupons, too.
LEADFEMALE:Beginner's luck, Master William.
LEADFEMALE:One last bet?
LEADFEMALE:No, no, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out, G.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't realize you were such a coward.
LEADMALE:Chicken.
LEADFEMALE:All right, don't nobody call me a coward.
LEADFEMALE:What's your bet?
OTHERMALE:$50.
SUPFEMALE:I ain't no punk, I'll take that down.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:I can't look.
SUPFEMALE:Drat!
SUPMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, damn, G.
LEADMALE:Damn! There, see, that one red.
LEADFEMALE:See, if it was like you, you'd have won, but it red, so you lost.
LEADFEMALE:Better luck next time.
SUPMALE:He fell for it, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Now let's go hustle Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oops.
LEADMALE:"Oops"? Good cover.
LEADMALE:I'm guessing you've done this before? You're wasting your time, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey already cut out all the bra ads.
SUPMALE:Will, for your information, I was looking at those funny little markings underneath the pictures.
OTHERFEMALE:In Bel-Air we call them "words.
SUPMALE:" Guess what, I just finished my first short story.
LEADMALE:What a coincidence, your first short story and your first short son in the same room.
LEADFEMALE:My friend at Essence magazine offered to read it.
OTHERMALE:But, before she does, I wanted to give you a copy and I want you to tell me exactly what you think.
SUPMALE:Great, I can't wait to read it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now that I am a professional I'm gonna go check out that new word processor.
OTHERFEMALE:See you.
LEADMALE:That's my little writer.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, somebody bury this.
SUPMALE:Dad, are you crazy? If I read this story, it'll be the biggest mistake I've ever made.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know about that, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Remember them plaid shorts you wore last summer? Look, let me tell you boys something about women.
OTHERMALE:Now, if I read it and say I like it she'll think I'm just trying to make her happy.
SUPFEMALE:If I say I don't like it, she'll stop trying to make me happy.
SUPMALE:Yes, women is a trip, Uncle Phil.
OTHERMALE:It's just like, let's say you accidentally scream out the wrong name and they jumping all out the back of your car like that.
LEADFEMALE:So, what are you going to do, Dad?
LEADMALE:Well, hey, I'm the man of the house.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think I'm gonna do?
OTHERFEMALE:What a man would do.
LEADMALE:Buy her a car and hope she forgets all about this.
LEADMALE:You know, we can really learn a lot from that man.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, G, would you make me a sandwich?
LEADFEMALE:But, of course.
OTHERMALE:Now you're a sandwich.
SUPFEMALE:You can take it off your head.
SUPFEMALE:G, something wrong?
LEADFEMALE:You swindled me.
LEADFEMALE:I was planning to use that money on lottery tickets.
SUPMALE:The jackpot's up to $26,000,000.
LEADFEMALE:Wow! Could you imagine what life would be like with all that money? Buying whatever you want, driving fancy cars dining in fancy restaurants.
LEADMALE:Wait a second, that is what life is like.
SUPFEMALE:I see this is getting me nowhere.
SUPMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me I'm going to enjoy the one thing you can't spoil for me.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Will.
LEADMALE:I mean, Geoffrey works hard for his money.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, we have so much and he has so little.
SUPMALE:Well, now we'll have more.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, absolutely.
LEADMALE:Let's play Brainstorm.
LEADFEMALE:Felix, l'll take Famous Quotes for $100.
OTHERFEMALE:The question is, "What is the motto of The Three Musketeers?" That's an easy one.
LEADMALE:"Creamy on the inside, smooth on the outside.
LEADFEMALE:"
OTHERFEMALE:"All for one and one for all!"
SUPMALE:Right again.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you missed that one, G.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, even Will could have guessed that one and the only thing he reads is the cereal box.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, at least I don't fit in one.
SUPMALE:Well, if you're so confident in my lack of ability perhaps you'd like to make a little wager.
LEADFEMALE:Say, $30?
LEADFEMALE:Done.
LEADMALE:Vietnam for $200.
SUPFEMALE:You drew the wild card.
LEADMALE:What do you say, Geoffrey? Want to double your bet? Well, it is an awful lot of money but, what the hell.
LEADMALE:And the question is.
SUPMALE:' "Who is the South Vietnamese president killed by his own generals in 1963?" Ngo Dinh Diem.
LEADFEMALE:No guesses? The correct answer is Ngo Dinh Diem.
LEADFEMALE:Splendid.
SUPMALE:I say we call Immigration.
OTHERFEMALE:Is this Brainstorm? How sad.
LEADFEMALE:Some people will do anything for money.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, why don't they just ask their fathers? The category is Greek History.
OTHERFEMALE:And the final Brainstorm question is.
SUPMALE:' "What Bronze Age civilization emerged about 2500 BC?" Oh, I know, the Minoan civilization.
LEADFEMALE:The Minoan civilization?
SUPFEMALE:Correct.
OTHERMALE:Hold up, hold up.
OTHERFEMALE:Time out.
LEADMALE:Flag on the plate, traveling, offsides, clipping.
SUPMALE:Hold up, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:What's up with this here?
LEADMALE:Hilary, how'd you know that? Easy, Geoffrey's been watching that tape all day.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm off to the store.
LEADFEMALE:When you're through, do turn off the VCR and return that tape of Brainstorm to my room.
LEADMALE:And might I add, ha ha! And, ha!
LEADMALE:Carlton, come on, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
OTHERMALE:I wonder what Geoffrey uses that cape for.
SUPFEMALE:Just Give me the lottery ticket.
SUPFEMALE:All right, watch the door.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure we should do this?
LEADFEMALE:Look, come on, man.
OTHERFEMALE:He got our money.
SUPMALE:I mean, it's either this or force him to listen to y oko Ono albums.
LEADFEMALE:Boys, your mother is driving me crazy about reading that short story.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, Dad, why don't you just read it and get it over with? I did read it.
SUPFEMALE:Trust me, the only thing your mother should write is checks.
LEADFEMALE:So, if she asks where I am, you haven't seen me and I'm not at home.
LEADMALE:But, Uncle Phil
LEADMALE:No "buts," Will.
LEADFEMALE:No matter what she says, you haven't seen hide nor hair of me.
OTHERMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:How long have you been there? You read it.
SUPFEMALE:You read it and you hated it.
LEADMALE:No, I lost it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, that's it.
SUPFEMALE:And I was so looking forward to reading it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, that's okay 'cause, you know, I made an extra copy.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:And I want you to be honest.
SUPFEMALE:I will.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:The lottery numbers are coming on! Turn it up.
LEADFEMALE:Turn it up.

SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, now, that's a $500 bottle of champagne.
LEADMALE:Ah, the cheap stuff.

LEADMALE:I quit.
LEADMALE:Will, Mom and Dad are gonna kill us when they find out what we did.
SUPMALE:No, they're not, 'cause they're not gonna find out what we did.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey's not leaving because I'm going to do the right thing.
SUPMALE:What, tell the truth?
OTHERMALE:No, I'm gonna beg like Keith Sweat.

SUPFEMALE:Money.
LEADFEMALE:Will, do something.

SUPFEMALE:Am I missing something? Yeah, about $26,000,000.
LEADMALE:Will did it.
LEADMALE:Did what? We tricked you into thinking you won, G.
SUPFEMALE:What you just watched was a tape of last week's lottery numbers.
LEADMALE:How clever.
LEADFEMALE:You used my own ruse against me.
LEADFEMALE:How I admire you.
SUPFEMALE:Die! Geoffrey, you're killing him.
LEADMALE:You catch on quickly, you little twit.
SUPFEMALE:G, listen, I said we're sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I must not have heard you.
LEADMALE:I'm fine.
LEADMALE:I'm okay.
SUPFEMALE:I'm okay.
SUPMALE:Look, G.
LEADFEMALE:It's going to be all right, man.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil will give you your job back.
LEADMALE:What about the money? There is no money.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:I have no choice but to leave.
OTHERMALE:I made such a fool of myself.
LEADFEMALE:I shudder to think what I said to your parents.
LEADMALE:It's all right, G.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, man.
LEADFEMALE:I'm too humiliated to stay.
LEADMALE:But, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, you can't go.
LEADMALE:Come on, G.
LEADMALE:It was a joke, man.
LEADFEMALE:Will, what are we gonna do? Look, I don't know about you, man, but I'm going to take this TV right here.
LEADMALE:Hey, grab that radio, drop it off in my room for me.
LEADFEMALE:You did what? Are you out of your horny, little adolescent minds? I know I am, Dad.
SUPMALE:What you did was not only humiliating it caused Geoffrey to quit his job.
LEADMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, it was just a joke.
SUPFEMALE:A joke I had nothing to do with, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, you know me, I don't even have a sense of humor.
OTHERFEMALE:You two have pulled some pranks in your day but this one, this one takes the cake.
SUPMALE:He's about to blow, man.
LEADFEMALE:Make a break for the front door.
LEADFEMALE:I'll cover you.
SUPFEMALE:So.
LEADFEMALE:So.
SUPMALE:Tell me, if you were me, what would you do? I don't know, forget the whole thing and get us a couple Jet Skis.
LEADFEMALE:I like that.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you big-eared freeloader you take the little, square-headed cousin, here and you find Geoffrey and you bring him back or they'll never find your bodies.
LEADMALE:And, I'm a judge.
SUPMALE:I can make it happen.
SUPMALE:You know, really, I don't mind the yelling.
SUPMALE:But does he have to spit? This happens all the time.
SUPFEMALE:They think I'm Bryant Gumbel.
LEADFEMALE:Are you the guy from Webster? No.
SUPFEMALE:I told you it was the guy from Diff'rent Strokes.
LEADFEMALE:So, Bryant, are you sure this the restaurant Hilary said G was working at?
SUPFEMALE:What are you two nimrods doing here?
LEADMALE:I'm pretty sure.
LEADMALE:Look, G.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, man, we want you to come home with us.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid that's impossible.
LEADMALE:All right, G, we made a mistake, okay.
LEADMALE:What, are you going to hold a grudge forever? How about until I'm dead? Geoffrey, you can't let something like this come between us.
LEADMALE:Look, I want you to leave.
SUPFEMALE:I finally found a position where I'm respected and appreciated.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, the urinals need mints.
LEADMALE:Move it.
LEADMALE:Inside joke.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't understand.
SUPMALE:Look, I don't think it's going to work, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Keep hope alive.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, my man! Look, check it out, me and my partner, here, we need a table preferably by the window.
LEADFEMALE:Now.
OTHERMALE:Who are you? Who am I? You hear Who am I? I'm a black man with a short fuse.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, show them to the table.
LEADMALE:Show us to the table.
LEADMALE:Eat fast and get out.
OTHERMALE:We're not leaving without you.
LEADFEMALE:Look, G, come on, everybody misses you.
SUPMALE:Well, get used to it.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't go back.
LEADMALE:You humiliated me.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, we've all been humiliated.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, how do you think Carlton feels when he changes into his gym shorts? That's a very small humiliation.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what's that supposed to mean? Waiter.
SUPMALE:If I don't get something to drink soon, I'm gonna die.
LEADFEMALE:You promise? Will, I don't think he's going to come with us.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, baby.
LEADMALE:Plan B.
OTHERFEMALE:Say, Miss, check it out, look me and my partner can't afford nothing on this menu.
SUPMALE:Probably, a Vaseline and salt sandwich if they had one.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out, I'll give you $5 for that salad.
OTHERMALE:What?
LEADMALE:All right, $6.
LEADFEMALE:50.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, check it out, $7 for just the lettuce.
SUPMALE:Well, I never.
OTHERFEMALE:All this money he paying for this food, girl, you better.
OTHERMALE:What? What's up? What's up? What?
SUPMALE:I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You're embarrassing me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know what you have to do to get rid of us.
LEADMALE:I know you're trying to get me fired, but it won't work.
LEADFEMALE:Just leave.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! What, are you blind? Your table's on fire.
SUPFEMALE:Pay attention.
LEADMALE:You idiot!
LEADMALE:What is going here? Should I tell him? Or do you want to, Dad?
LEADFEMALE:This is your son?
LEADFEMALE:Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Is it our fault you never married Mom? I know she embarrassed you.
SUPMALE:She only had one arm and when you would go to concerts, she clapped like this.
LEADFEMALE:Surely, you don't believe this.
SUPMALE:Daddy, you're ashamed of us? This is my brother, Carlton.
SUPMALE:He knows we can't afford any bigger clothes so he just doesn't grow.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, I want to grow.
OTHERMALE:He's never even been on a roller coaster for God's sakes.
LEADFEMALE:You two are really something.
LEADMALE:Something good or something bad? I can't believe you'd go through all this to get me back.
SUPMALE:We miss you.
LEADFEMALE:We love you, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll come back home.
SUPMALE:Daddy's coming home.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Daddy's coming Thank you.
