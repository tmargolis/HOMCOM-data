SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil, please.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind turning the music back on? I'm trying to study.
OTHERMALE:I'm expecting a very important client.
LEADFEMALE:We have a golfing date and I'd appreciate it if you could study somewhere else.
LEADMALE:Okay, I get it.
LEADFEMALE:You're trying to impress him.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:You might want to change them pants.
SUPMALE:Good morning, sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Aunt Viv.
SUPFEMALE:What time is Jameson getting here?
SUPMALE:What are you wearing, Vivian? Excuse me? That red blouse.
OTHERFEMALE:That's Jameson's bad-luck color.
LEADMALE:This happens to be my favorite blouse so he can just go find himself another bad-luck color.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe he can pick one out of Uncle Phil's pants.
SUPMALE:Vivian, please change.
LEADFEMALE:I know he's a little superstitious but his big account helps to pay our little bills.
LEADMALE:All set for a great game of golf, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, what is it, recess at the clown convention? That's right.
OTHERMALE:And by the way, Will, who cut your hair, Ray Charles? I've been saving that one for a week.
LEADFEMALE:Don't even try to top it.
LEADMALE:That must be Jameson.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, humor him.
SUPMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Jameson Whitworth.
SUPMALE:Jameson, how are you? Fine.
SUPMALE:Vivian, it's lovely to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:And it's nice seeing you, Jameson.
SUPMALE:How are you, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Whitworth?
LEADMALE:Not great.
LEADFEMALE:My caddy called me on the car phone a few minutes ago and canceled.
LEADFEMALE:I've learned my 
LEADMALE:Never trust a Leo.
OTHERMALE:Ain't that the truth? Back in Philly I knew this guy named Leo Brentley.
OTHERMALE:The dude tried to steal my lucky drawers.
SUPFEMALE:You have a pair of lucky drawers?
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:So do I.
LEADFEMALE:This is all very interesting.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, you can caddy for both of us.
OTHERFEMALE:Shall we go, gentlemen? Wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:I have a very good feeling about this.
LEADFEMALE:How would you like to be my caddy? I ain't down with carrying golf clubs.
SUPMALE:It's $50, plus tip.
LEADFEMALE:Fore! This is the worst round of golf I've ever played.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the green's a little wet today.
SUPMALE:That's what's wrong.
SUPMALE:What? A hole in one! I made a hole in one.
LEADFEMALE:The first time in my life.
LEADMALE:Some shot, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Whitworth.
LEADMALE:Congratulations, Jameson.
OTHERMALE:Did you see that, Will? It's because your hat's turned to the side, you can see better.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:There's more to it than that.
LEADMALE:There is? Jameson, let me buy lunch.
LEADFEMALE:A hole in one calls for a celebration.
LEADFEMALE:I'll say.
LEADFEMALE:I have to make it quick.
SUPFEMALE:I have to get back to the office.
OTHERMALE:I'm making a major investment in Thorton Pharmaceuticals.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I'll get lucky again, Will.
LEADMALE:That's wack.
SUPFEMALE:"Wack.
LEADMALE:" In what sense of the word? It's Saturday afternoon.
LEADMALE:All you're thinking about is work.
SUPFEMALE:That's got to be hurting you with the girlies.
SUPFEMALE:Will, please.
LEADFEMALE:Forget about the office, forget about that stock.
OTHERFEMALE:Just max and relax.
LEADFEMALE:Kick back and enjoy yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Go home and let your wife know she's still got it.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:Doggone it, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Doggone it, I'm right.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, I really think I made an impression on Mr.
SUPMALE:Whitworth.
OTHERMALE:And was your sucking up as successful as you'd hoped? I'll say.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna apply for a summer job with his company.
LEADFEMALE:But, Carlton, Dad's his lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that kind of using a connection? I can't believe it, Vivian.
SUPMALE:Jameson made a hole in one, and he's not a very good golfer.
OTHERFEMALE:What's his handicap, sir?
LEADMALE:Ain't it obvious? Everybody, the working girl is home.
SUPFEMALE:How was your day?
OTHERFEMALE:I love working in an art gallery.
LEADFEMALE:I'm learning so much.
SUPMALE:I just told my boss, "Teach me.
LEADMALE:I'm a blank slate.
SUPMALE:" At least you're honest.
SUPMALE:What exactly do you do in this job?
OTHERMALE:This is a very exclusive art gallery.
LEADFEMALE:So, they're trying to maintain a certain atmosphere.
SUPFEMALE:So, when customers come in the door, I ignore them.
LEADFEMALE:If they ask me about a piece of art, I look right through them.
LEADMALE:If they ask for a price, I go like this And walk away.
LEADMALE:Hilary, it sounds like they hired you to be a snob.
LEADFEMALE:I guess they saw something in me.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Whitworth.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Jameson, this is a surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, Philip, I'm not here to see you.
OTHERFEMALE:I told you I impressed him, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:I'm here to see Will.
LEADMALE:No, sir, my name is Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:I know that.
LEADMALE:I'd like to see Will.
LEADMALE:I'll get him.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, I brought this for you.
OTHERMALE:What is it?
SUPFEMALE:It's a sprig of wolfsbane.
SUPFEMALE:Hang it over your kitchen door and all will be well.
LEADFEMALE:But Jameson, everything's fine in our kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:That you know of.
SUPFEMALE:What's up, J? I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:You saved me a lot of money.
LEADMALE:Word? On the golf course, you told me not to buy Thorton Pharmaceuticals.
LEADFEMALE:The stock dropped 10 points today.
LEADMALE:Jameson, I think you're reading a little too much into this.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know nothing about stocks.
LEADFEMALE:It was just luck.
LEADFEMALE:Precisely.
OTHERFEMALE:You're a good-luck charm.
SUPMALE:I would've lost millions, but thanks to my "Yo, homey" here I didn't.
LEADFEMALE:So what you're saying is thanks to me, you got lucky twice yesterday.
SUPMALE:Three times.
OTHERMALE:The wife girlie will be smiling for months.
LEADFEMALE:You have a bright future, young man.
SUPMALE:This is no fair.
LEADFEMALE:There are many forces at work in the universe, Will.
SUPFEMALE:For example, the power in numbers.
LEADMALE:The four arms of the Mutable Cross, Virgo.
SUPMALE:When the moon is in the seventh house.
LEADMALE:The sixth-ray energies, Saturn to Neptune the seventh sun, born for good luck all numbers.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Jameson, why don't I fix you a drink? I don't drink.
LEADFEMALE:I like to keep my mind clear.
LEADFEMALE:I think he's cleared it out pretty well.
LEADFEMALE:My lucky numbers have always been three and seven.
LEADMALE:Will, when's your birthday?
OTHERMALE:July 3.
LEADMALE:What year?
LEADFEMALE:1973.
LEADMALE:So you were born on 7-3-73 my lucky numbers.
OTHERFEMALE:Jameson, that's just a coincidence.
OTHERMALE:Coincidence? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:I was born August 4, 1974.
LEADFEMALE:A Leo? Will, I have an assignment for you.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to go through these files.
LEADFEMALE:They're about a company called Innermark.
OTHERMALE:I've been analyzing the data for months trying to decide whether or not I should buy it.
SUPMALE:You want me to read all this? That's not necessary.
LEADMALE:Just feel the pages.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me what kind of energy you get back.
LEADFEMALE:Jameson, I have to say this all sounds a little Insane? unorthodox.
LEADMALE:You have an excellent brokerage firm to advise you.
LEADFEMALE:J, straight up, I don't know nothing about this stuff.
LEADMALE:Will, you don't know that you know but believe me, you know.
LEADMALE:Man, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Philip, Vivian, have a nice day.
LEADMALE:Why is that man running loose on the streets without medication? He's a little eccentric, Vivian, but he has a brilliant financial mind.
OTHERFEMALE:He does? Philip, why don't you tell Will about Sparky? I don't think we need to go into that.
LEADMALE:Last year Jameson was taking all of his stock advice from his dog.
SUPFEMALE:That's untrue, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:He only took tax advice from Sparky.
OTHERFEMALE:Then, last spring Sparky met with an untimely run-in with a milk truck but of course, that didn't stop Jameson from talking to him.
SUPMALE:He talks to the spirit of a dead dog? No.
LEADMALE:He had him stuffed and put in his office.
OTHERMALE:Uncle Phil, why do you humor this guy? The planet he's on ain't even been discovered yet.
LEADFEMALE:He's an important client and he's just entrusted you with a very serious financial decision.
SUPFEMALE:This has got to be handled delicately.
LEADFEMALE:What am I supposed to do? Tomorrow, you to go down to Whitworth's Capital Investments find Jameson Whitworth and tell him that you're a 17-year-old kid and you're in no position to give financial advice.
OTHERMALE:Exactly.
LEADMALE:That's Sparky's job.
LEADFEMALE:Your main man is in effect, Mr.
SUPMALE:Whitworth.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Gladys.
LEADMALE:Will, come in.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on, J? You know, I just wanted to come so Is something wrong, Will? No.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm a little pressed for time, so let's just get right to the point.
LEADMALE:Excellent.
LEADMALE:All right, Will, Innermark Industries.
SUPMALE:Do we buy this stock or not? Look, that's what I came to talk to you about.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I'm in any position to give you financial advice.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm only 17.
SUPMALE:Did you say 17? This is a sign.
LEADMALE:Will, look at this.
LEADMALE:This machine gives me stock quotes.
LEADMALE:What price has Innermark been trading at all day? Seventeen.
OTHERMALE:You've done it again, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I'm calling my broker.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, I really don't think you should Miles? Buy me one million shares of Innermark Industries.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Done.
LEADFEMALE:You bought a million shares of stock because I told you I was 17? That's right.
SUPFEMALE:This is just one big coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I'm about to turn 18.
LEADFEMALE:Did you say 18?
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Yes, you did.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at this, Will.
LEADMALE:The stock just went up to $18.
LEADMALE:You just made me $1 million.
LEADMALE:That doesn't mean anything, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Whitworth.
LEADMALE:I can understand you being frightened by your powers.
LEADFEMALE:But there are forces at work in the universe beyond our understanding.
SUPMALE:Don't fight them, Will.
LEADMALE:Learn to accept them and there will always be a place for you here.
LEADMALE:You know, Will's been gone for hours.
OTHERMALE:I wonder how his meeting with Mr.
OTHERMALE:Whitworth is going.
OTHERMALE:Nothing to worry about, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Traffic from Mars is very heavy this time of day.
LEADMALE:I'm home.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, get the camera.
LEADFEMALE:I want a picture of me opening my first paycheck.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations, baby.
LEADMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so excited.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, Dad, I'll start paying my own way around here and I won't accept no for an answer.
LEADFEMALE:You still owe me $5 for those magazines you bought.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, don't be petty.
OTHERFEMALE:All set.
SUPMALE:Here goes.
SUPMALE:Don't you all feel like a part of history? What? Federal taxes? This is an outrage.
LEADMALE:Didn't President Bush say, "No new taxes"? But federal taxes aren't new.
LEADFEMALE:They are to me.
LEADFEMALE:And who is this FICA guy? Hilary, taxes are taken out of everybody's salary.
LEADFEMALE:They pay for highways, national defense, and housing programs.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought the government was supposed to pay for all that.
LEADMALE:Okay, I know the solution.
LEADMALE:I'm going to demand a raise.
LEADMALE:Hilary, you've only been there a week.
LEADMALE:Nobody starts at the top.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Lunch on the company yacht? Yeah, that sounds great, Jameson.
LEADFEMALE:Let's say you have the limo pick me up noon-ish.
LEADMALE:Yeah, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Peace back at you, babe.
OTHERMALE:Will, I want you to return all that stuff before the cops get here.
LEADMALE:What are you tripping? J gave me this stuff as a little thank-you gift.
LEADMALE:For what?
LEADMALE:I made him $1 million.
OTHERFEMALE:That may seem like a lot, Will, but wait till they take out all the taxes.
LEADMALE:Will, how did you make Jameson $1 million? To be honest, I have no idea.
LEADFEMALE:Jameson seems to think I'm good luck.
LEADMALE:Will, there's no such thing as good luck or bad luck.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, there is.
LEADMALE:I've got bad luck.
OTHERFEMALE:You look handsome, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Nice suit.
LEADMALE:You like it, Ash? Custom-made.
LEADFEMALE:Size 42, extra fly.
LEADFEMALE:When you work for Whitworth, you get all the fringe benefits.
LEADMALE:Does he need a butler? Just asking.
LEADMALE:For a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you don't really think you're capable of giving financial advice, do you? Aunt Viv there are forces at work in this universe that are beyond our understanding.
OTHERMALE:And if these forces want to give me a limo a cellular phone, and an Armani suit who are we to argue with them? Will, I sent you there to get out of this arrangement with Jameson and now you're in deeper than before.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I just feel terrible.
LEADMALE:Am I showing enough cuff?
SUPMALE:What are you doing?
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna put an end to this.
LEADMALE:Yes, Philip Banks for Jameson Whitworth.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I've been talking to Will here.
LEADFEMALE:First of all, I'd like to say he's very flattered but it's a little risky having a high-school student give financial advice.
LEADMALE:As your lawyer, I'd advise you put an end to it.
SUPMALE:Sure, you want to talk to him yourself? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, J.
LEADFEMALE:What up, coolie-bop? Really? Really? Yeah, if that's the way you want it, that's cool.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Peace.
LEADMALE:What did he say? Uncle Phil, you're fired.
LEADFEMALE:So, is Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Whitworth ready to see us yet? He's still in there talking to his homey.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll just have to chill.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:We can't afford to lose Whitworth's account.
SUPMALE:We need a game plan.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we had agreed on groveling.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, but we need to straighten out the order in which we grovel.
OTHERMALE:I'll go first.
SUPFEMALE:Since my father founded the law firm, I can make an emotional plea.
OTHERMALE:Philip, you can remind him of all our dedicated service to his company.
LEADFEMALE:What do I say?
OTHERMALE:Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:You're only here because his lucky number is three.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:J, come on, man, you've got to meet with them.
SUPMALE:They're sitting right outside.
OTHERFEMALE:Straight up, pop.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but the aura is wack.
LEADMALE:What did you say, Sparky? He's talking? He hasn't talked in weeks.
SUPMALE:You think it's a good idea to have the meeting? Word? What's that? Go ahead with the meeting? Send them in right away.
SUPFEMALE:There you have it.
LEADMALE:Sparky says have the meeting.
LEADMALE:Well, all right.
LEADFEMALE:It's two against one.
LEADMALE:Gladys, send them in, please.
SUPMALE:Jameson, good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Have a seat.
LEADMALE:Will, excuse us, please.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:He stays.
LEADFEMALE:I want him here.
LEADFEMALE:Sparky wants him here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Jameson, Furth, Wind & Meyer has represented you for the past 20 years.
SUPMALE:And I think I speak for all the lawyers in the firm when I say that we're dedicated to continuing in that capacity.
OTHERMALE:So? Lawyers are a dime a dozen.
LEADMALE:There's some truth in that.
LEADMALE:You had an interesting point you wanted to make, didn't you? Yes, Henry.
LEADMALE:Jameson, to elaborate on what Henry was saying, it Yes? What? This is terrible.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter?
LEADFEMALE:That was my broker.
LEADFEMALE:Innermark stock is plummeting.
OTHERMALE:It's already down 10 points.
SUPMALE:My God, it's already down to $6 a share.
LEADFEMALE:It's down to $5, $4, $3 Great.
OTHERFEMALE:That's your lucky number.
OTHERMALE:I just lost a fortune.
LEADMALE:Will, you owe me $14 million.
LEADMALE:Here's $5.
LEADMALE:This is serious.
LEADMALE:Don't you know anything? No.
SUPMALE:How many times do I have to tell you? Why did you tell me to buy that stock? You're out of your mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm out of my mind? You're the one that's got Lassie as your vice president.
SUPMALE:You're not lucky.
LEADFEMALE:You're unlucky.
LEADMALE:You're a curse.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of my office.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you talk to him like that.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? It's your fault he's involved in this.
SUPFEMALE:This isn't the first time that your craziness has got us in hot water.
LEADFEMALE:Last January, on my birthday when I could have been home with my wife and family, where was I? Stuck in the office buried under paperwork because Sparky chased a Buick and you thought that was his way of telling you to take over General Motors.
LEADMALE:Jameson, I am through with your craziness.
LEADFEMALE:If that means we lose a $20 million account, then so be it.
LEADFEMALE:Jameson, I think that's Philip's way of saying "I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:"
LEADMALE:Why didn't you ever say this before?
LEADFEMALE:I should have.
LEADMALE:Absolutely.
LEADMALE:I had no idea your birthday was in January.
SUPFEMALE:You're a Capricorn.
LEADFEMALE:My horoscope says a Capricorn will lead me to prosperity.
OTHERFEMALE:Philip, you're just the goat I've been looking for.
OTHERMALE:Gentlemen, welcome back.
SUPFEMALE:The way you stood up for me, Uncle Phil, you were all that.
LEADMALE:I didn't like the way he was treating you.
LEADFEMALE:So what happened next? Uncle Phil told him he could take his big account fold it five ways and stick it where Sparky can't find it.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, Dad, that took guts.
SUPMALE:Well done, sir.
SUPMALE:You know, I've always wished I had the nerve to tell off my employers.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, you've been a wonderful example for me.
OTHERFEMALE:How much abuse can one person take for the sake of a job? There are lots of things about my boss that bug me.
LEADFEMALE:And I've been putting up with him for a whole week.
LEADFEMALE:It's time to take action.
LEADMALE:Hilary, I don't want you to go screaming at your boss.
SUPMALE:Can you? Philip, I am really proud of you.
LEADMALE:Life is too short to put up with the Jameson Whitworths of the world.
LEADFEMALE:Straight up, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe that loon changed his mind because you told him you were a Capricorn.
SUPMALE:Capricorn? Philip, your birthday's January 30.
OTHERMALE:You're an Aquarius.
OTHERFEMALE:Vivian, for a $20 million account, I'm a Capricorn.
LEADFEMALE:
