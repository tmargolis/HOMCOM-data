LEADMALE:Now, look, Uncle Phil, we don't need nothing too fancy as long as it's got vibrating bucket seats a refrigerated glove compartment and a license plate that 
LEADFEMALE:Will, this car is for basic transportation, not your indulgences.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, big guy.
LEADMALE:We want something that emphasizes good sense over style and excitement.
LEADMALE:How about a '94 you?
SUPMALE:There it is.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Ta-da! The all new Accountant BX.
SUPFEMALE:It has the latest technology in childproof door locks.
OTHERFEMALE:What are the honeys gonna say about a dude cruising around in one of these? They'll say, " Why, there goes a thrifty, level-headed young man.
LEADFEMALE:" Yeah, right before they say, "And I'll never have sex with him.
OTHERFEMALE:" Afternoon, gentlemen.
LEADMALE:Philip Banks.
LEADMALE:Pete Fletcher.
LEADMALE:I'll be right with you.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, I think we found what we're looking for.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:I like a man who knows what he wants.
LEADMALE:Makes my job a whole lot easier.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, you not seriously considering making me drive this Carltonmobile, are you? Son, when I was in college, I drove a manure-brown '65 Dodge Dart.
OTHERMALE:So why you taking that out on me? What a piece of junk.
LEADFEMALE:Tow trucks used to follow me around like vultures.
LEADMALE:You deserve better, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Perhaps.
SUPFEMALE:Don't listen to him, Dad.
OTHERMALE:It's a trick.
LEADFEMALE:Check this out, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:You like that, right? There you are, Uncle Phil, thousands of pounds thinner cruising the strip at Princeton.
SUPFEMALE:Wind blowing through your big old fro.
LEADMALE:Honeys checking you out.
LEADMALE:They're 
SUPFEMALE:"There go Philip Banks, he is a bad mamma jamma.
LEADFEMALE:" They waving at you, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:Go ahead, go ahead, wave back.
SUPMALE:It's okay, wave back.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADMALE:Right on, sisters.
SUPMALE:Dad, did I mention that the all-new Accountant gets 75 miles to the gallon? To hell with the Accountant, I want this.
LEADFEMALE:Excellent choice, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in the office, we'll crunch some numbers.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, Will just bamboozled you.
SUPMALE:And that's the story we'll tell your mother.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Will.
LEADMALE:You bought a great car, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for your business.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Someday.
LEADMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, sir? I believe this is yours.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, a grand? Yeah, well, that's the standard commission for an Evader.
LEADMALE:Oh, I forgot something.
LEADMALE:What? Another zero? Hey, hey.
SUPMALE:Well, I can only pay commission to someone who works for me.
LEADMALE:Interested? That sounds great, man.
SUPMALE:I can't fade that, I'm still in school.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good for you.
LEADMALE:Forget I mentioned it.
LEADFEMALE:What does a college kid need with cash like this anyway? Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:What you talking about? Will, I believe you have the makings of a super salesman, and together we can make piles of money.
OTHERMALE:Of course, my pile would be bigger.
LEADFEMALE:How about Saturdays?
LEADFEMALE:Saturdays? I tell you, throw a CD changer in my uncle's Evader, you got a deal.
SUPFEMALE:Done.
SUPFEMALE:How about Sundays?
LEADFEMALE:You gotta give me some wire wheels.
SUPMALE:Holidays?
OTHERMALE:Got to give a brother cellular for that.
SUPMALE:"As you become more comfortable as a salesman you'll develop your own style.
SUPFEMALE:" Say, baby, with all that butt, you might be needing a hatchback.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be so rich.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Will.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hil, you mind if I kick my sales rap on you? Pretend you're buying a car.
LEADFEMALE:No offense, Will, but I would never buy a car from you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hil, we're pretending here.
LEADFEMALE:You're not my cousin, you're somebody else.
SUPMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm Will Smith.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm the Baroness Natasha.
SUPMALE:I am on holiday in your country with my husband, the baron, and my lover Gustav.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, look, baroness, I was wondering if I could interest you in a sporty new Evader?
SUPFEMALE:It has a V6 dual overhead
LEADFEMALE:Yes, of course, I take six.
LEADMALE:Gustav, pay the man.
LEADFEMALE:You take jewels, yes? Hey, thanks a lot, Hil.
LEADMALE:My pleasure.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm off.
LEADMALE:You most certainly are.
LEADMALE:Look, G, I was wondering if my sales Peasant! Hey, can I kick my sales rap around with you? Later.
LEADFEMALE:Your Aunt Viv and I are going for a ride in Daddy's new toy.
OTHERMALE:What is that?
LEADFEMALE:This is cruising music.
LEADFEMALE:Al Green and the Isley Brothers.
LEADFEMALE:Sookie, sookie, now.
SUPMALE:Baby.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Will, Will, Will.
LEADMALE:Man, congratulations.
OTHERFEMALE:Five cars in one day.
SUPFEMALE:I've never seen anything like it.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, I have.
LEADFEMALE:Me.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I'm telling you, boss, it is the best feeling in the world.
LEADMALE:Well, there's a close second.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I'm talking about.
OTHERMALE:You know what I'm talking about.
LEADMALE:Well, there'll be plenty of time for that.
SUPMALE:Now, if you feel good now, take a look at your commission check.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, are my pants wet? How many of your friends can say they made that kind of money in one day? What you mean, legally? But it's a shame.
OTHERFEMALE:Tomorrow, when you're in some chemistry class learning about inert gases, someone will be stealing your commissions.
SUPMALE:Now, that's where you're wrong.
LEADFEMALE:That's the spirit.
OTHERMALE:I don't take chemistry, but I damn sure know math.
SUPMALE:So you can figure what a full-time check would be? Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:Five times this, carry the six, and add a zero.
LEADFEMALE:And what do you get?
LEADMALE:I get out of school.
SUPMALE:Shake hands with your new full-time man.
SUPMALE:Whoomp, there it is.
LEADMALE:Isn't this great? Family fun and no Will.
LEADMALE:Your turn, son.
SUPMALE:Okay, to me.
OTHERFEMALE:"You're in a store and you find $50 on the ground.
LEADFEMALE:Do you pick it up?" Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey picks it up.
LEADMALE:Your turn, Ash.
SUPMALE:Oh, okay, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:"It's clear your teenage daughter is not enjoying the tedious board game being played in a forced family-bonding moment.
LEADMALE:What do you do?" Fine.
SUPMALE:I try to encourage family time together, and this is the thanks I get.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't wanna play, you don't have to.
LEADMALE:Go on, get out of here!
LEADFEMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:That's what it says on the card.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'd ask if there was something else she'd rather do and discuss an alternative.
SUPFEMALE:Good answer, baby.
LEADMALE:Oh, I bet you feel like a big dummy.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
OTHERMALE:Yo, I tore up that sales chart today.
OTHERMALE:Well, congratulations, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:If you find something that excites you, hold on to it.
LEADFEMALE:That's what gets me through the day.
LEADMALE:So, Uncle Phil, what you're saying is that if a guy finds a job that he likes, he should give it his all.
SUPFEMALE:Absolutely.
OTHERFEMALE:Then I'm doing the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Of course you are.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm thinking I'm gonna quit school and sell cars full-time.
SUPMALE:Boy, have you lost your damn mind? There is no way you're gonna quit school as long as I'm here.
OTHERFEMALE:Aunt Viv, it's not like I'm working fries in some burger joint.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'm in a suit and a tie and I'm selling fine cars.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:College isn't for everyone, and if Will is happy I think we should all be happy for him.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, thanks a lot, Ash.
LEADMALE:Listen, I get my license in a few months.
LEADFEMALE:You think you could hook me up? Ashley, go to your room.
SUPFEMALE:Cherry red.
SUPFEMALE:I got you.
LEADFEMALE:You know.
LEADMALE:I got you, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Your mother sent you here so you could have a bright future.
SUPMALE:You quit school, you're throwing it all away.
LEADMALE:I won't allow that.
SUPMALE:See, now, that's not fair.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary dropped out of school and turned out great.
SUPMALE:Hilary's success is contrary to the laws of nature.
LEADMALE:Totally inexplicable.
SUPMALE:Oh, stop.
LEADFEMALE:Look, that was a bad example.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I think it's stupid
SUPMALE:Stupid? It's not stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey! Could we talk to Will in private, please? It's idiotic.
OTHERMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, you go to college to figure out what you wanna do.
SUPMALE:I mean, I found what I wanna do, and it ain't taking me no four years.
LEADFEMALE:Going to college is not about finding a job.
SUPFEMALE:It's also about finding yourself.
SUPMALE:And the search should take more than one weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't you guys respect my decisions and treat me like an adult? Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling your mother.
SUPMALE:Oh, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, I got to do this, man.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, come on, man, it's not the end of the world.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADFEMALE:If I'd waited a few days, I could have bought that car from you wholesale.
LEADMALE:Yo, what up, J?
LEADFEMALE:Yo.
LEADMALE:I need to ask you a favor.
LEADFEMALE:I need a car with a back seat.
SUPMALE:Jazz, I can't just give you a car to take off the lot, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Who said anything about leaving the lot? This will do just fine.
LEADMALE:Get out.
SUPFEMALE:Get out! Come on, Ophelia.
SUPFEMALE:That's all right, I have a real friend at the bus depot.
SUPMALE:Well, this is impressive, man.
LEADFEMALE:Twelve units in your first week.
OTHERMALE:You realize I have people on my staff who don't sell 12 cars in a year? Well, they in the wrong business.
SUPMALE:So you think I should fire Harrison, do you?
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you're wrong.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:You should fire him.
SUPFEMALE:What? Me?
SUPMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Because I think you're excellent management material.
SUPMALE:Here, sit down.
LEADFEMALE:Put your feet up.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:See? Looks good on you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Feels nice on my butt too.
SUPMALE:Imported cigar?
SUPMALE:Lf that's all you got.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Bite the end off.
OTHERMALE:I'm not too sure about this firing thing, man.
OTHERMALE:Will, Harrison's been sliding downhill for years.
LEADMALE:His sales record is embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:Especially when compared to a mover like you.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead, put him out of his misery.
LEADFEMALE:It's the only humane thing to do.
LEADMALE:This chair is made out of leather, isn't it? All right, all right.
SUPMALE:Say, Harrison, you got a second, man? Sure, I'm just doing some paperwork.
SUPFEMALE:You know, some nights I can barely tear myself away from this desk.
SUPMALE:Maybe you can take it with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Harrison
LEADFEMALE:Don't get me wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you know I have six kids? No, I didn't know that.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I bet you'd love to spend more time with them, wouldn't you? Sure, especially since Mary died.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
OTHERMALE:Yo, man, did you know Harrison has six kids and a dead wife? Of course I know.
LEADFEMALE:He's my brother.
LEADFEMALE:See, now, that's cold, man.
LEADFEMALE:No, Will, that's business.
SUPFEMALE:When you're the manager, you make the tough decisions.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, man.
SUPMALE:Firing people ain't fun.
LEADFEMALE:It's an acquired taste.
LEADFEMALE:You'll learn it.
LEADMALE:I have faith in you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, man.
LEADMALE:That's it, you're out of here, come on.
LEADMALE:Don't be eyeballing me neither.
SUPFEMALE:Get on, come on.
LEADMALE:Get on! And wash those shirts.
LEADMALE:Especially you.
OTHERFEMALE:That's three less mechanics to worry about.
LEADMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:Tomorrow, we hit the parts department.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:I'll buy you a steak.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, man, you missed a spot.
OTHERMALE:You're fired! Fired! Now, look, the bottom line is, he wasn't producing.
LEADFEMALE:Now, in this business, you either cut it or you don't.
LEADFEMALE:And he didn't.
LEADMALE:So y'all can take your bellyaching elsewhere because it's falling on deaf ears.
LEADFEMALE:Get on out of here before I have to take my belt off.
LEADFEMALE:Yo! Oh, that's funny? Y'all think that's funny? What were my nieces and nephews doing here? Yeah, they were coming to plead your brother Harrison's job.
SUPMALE:I guess none of them good salesmen either, huh? You're beginning to scare me.
SUPMALE:Can I adopt you? Hey, Pete, do you remember November 6, 1987? How can I forget? That's the day I set the sales record for the entire Southern California area.
SUPMALE:I sold 11 cars.
LEADFEMALE:Well, 10.
SUPMALE:One of them had an exploding gas tank.
LEADFEMALE:As far as I'm concerned, once they leave the showroom, it's a sale.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that don't matter, because today I'm gonna sell 15.
OTHERMALE:Nobody can sell 15 cars.
OTHERMALE:Will Smith can sell 15 cars.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Why don't you try your hand at that angry sister that just came in.
SUPMALE:Yo, man, that's my mom.
SUPFEMALE:So what? A sale's a sale.
LEADMALE:Hey, Ma.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, where do you get off dropping out of school?
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Smith, if I may interject
LEADFEMALE:Who the hell are you? Mom, this is my boss.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Fletcher.
LEADFEMALE:So you're the snake that lured my boy from that fine institute of higher learning.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Smith, your son has a bright and productive future here at Mulholland Motors.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? You ever been beat up by a woman? Not without having paid for it.
OTHERMALE:Will, I'll be in my office hiding under the desk if you need me.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Mom, listen.
OTHERFEMALE:For the first time in my life I found something that I'm good at and that I enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:It feels good, Mom.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah?
LEADFEMALE:Does this feel good?
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:Which way is that college?
LEADMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Mom!
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:This doesn't feel good, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:My commission! This fat-free cake isn't bad.
OTHERMALE:Sir, that's a sponge.
OTHERMALE:Well, I guess I'll start my homework now.
OTHERMALE:I got a lot of studying to do if I expect to make the best of this wonderful opportunity to get my college education! Will, your mother's not here.
LEADFEMALE:She went out to dinner with your Aunt Viv.
SUPMALE:Oh, she better had.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I'm sorry we had to involve her in this but you really left us no choice.
LEADMALE:How in the world did she get the college to readmit you? She threatened to enroll herself.
LEADFEMALE:We're all glad you finally came to your senses.
LEADFEMALE:You have plenty of time to figure out what you wanna do with your life.
LEADMALE:And being a car salesman didn't exactly bring out your most endearing qualities.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, I was getting paid, man.
SUPFEMALE:Will, what you do for a living should provide you with a sense of pride and personal fulfillment.
LEADMALE:It should tap into that part of you that has something valuable to give to the world.
LEADMALE:Shouldn't be just about money.
SUPFEMALE:You really believe that, Uncle Phil?
LEADMALE:Yes, son, I do.
LEADMALE:Then how do you explain being a lawyer? I'm going to get another piece of sponge.
SUPFEMALE:How in the world did she get the college to readmit you? She threatened to enroll herself.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we're all gla Well, we're all glad you came to your senses.
SUPFEMALE:You have plenty of time to figure out what you wanna do with your life.
SUPFEMALE:And being a car salesman didn't exactly promote your * * * *.
LEADFEMALE:It didn't promote? Excuse me.
LEADMALE:It's people from the Lord.
LEADFEMALE:There's people of the Lord in the audience.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it ain't like they ain't never used that word.
LEADFEMALE:We sorry.
SUPMALE:See See, James Avery See, he's a heathen.
LEADMALE:He's just a heathen.
LEADMALE:Amen.
SUPMALE:He's a blasphemer.
SUPMALE:Here we go.
SUPMALE:
