LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody, listen up.
SUPFEMALE:Listen up! As acting manager while Jackie is away, I'd like to announce a few changes.
LEADFEMALE:Now, due to the numerous requests, the no tipping policy has been waived.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello.
LEADFEMALE:Don't forget to pick up your applications for the new and exclusive stockroom clerk.
LEADMALE:So you're in charge now, huh, Will?
LEADMALE:Oh, sure, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:And you know what they say.
LEADFEMALE:Behind every successful man, there's a woman.
LEADFEMALE:But if you wanted to switch positions, I'm with that too, know what I mean? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, where are you going? Where are you going? Come here, girl.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Professor Milligan.
LEADFEMALE:How are you doing? Don't tell me.
SUPFEMALE:Don't tell me.
LEADMALE:You're coming down here to swear me in as the new manager.
OTHERMALE:You're making the right choice because as you can see, this place is bumping.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe so, but sales aren't.
LEADFEMALE:Take a look.
LEADMALE:You throw a good party, Will, but nobody's spending.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid you're just not management material.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Professor Mil.
SUPMALE:Hey, listen, listen.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna let a silly little thing like profits stand in the way of my promotion, are you? I'm sorry, I've already made my decision.
LEADMALE:I'm bringing in one of the most conscientious freshmen business students for the job.
LEADMALE:Very meticulous.
LEADMALE:Bakes me fresh muffins every day.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, he's 
LEADFEMALE:Well, where did you get this thing?
LEADFEMALE:They were passing them out at school.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:What's that? The I Hate Hilary newsletter.
LEADFEMALE:"Dedicated to the premise that weathercaster Hilary Banks is a boob.
LEADFEMALE:" Get to the insulting part.
LEADMALE:"Hilary Banks doesn't know the difference between a cirrus cloud and a cumulus cloud.
OTHERFEMALE:" What is the difference? Will, look around.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you see my TelePrompTer here? "Hilary's knowledge of the weather is as skimpy as those ridiculous outfits she wears on the air.
SUPFEMALE:" I mean, it's one thing to attack my performance, but my wardrobe? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Yep, every business major at ULA wanted The Peacock but my prospectus blew away the competition.
SUPFEMALE:Who knows? I could be the next Ross Perot.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Short, obnoxious.
LEADMALE:All you need is a bad haircut.
SUPFEMALE:And your ears.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm proud of you, son.
LEADFEMALE:Your first job, and you're running the entire operation.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, big guy.
LEADMALE:There aren't too many first year students with my level of savvy and maturity.
LEADMALE:Fruity Pebbles! And there's a little tugboat inside, Ross.
SUPMALE:You know, Dad, the best part is, this could be my ticket to Princeton.
LEADFEMALE:Professor Milligan says that lvy League schools Iook pretty darn favorably on management experience.
LEADMALE:How do they feel about guys who still depend on the crossing guard? Hey, that's a dangerous intersection, mister.
LEADFEMALE:Quit putting your hands
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey! You two are gonna have to come to an understanding and work this thing out.
SUPMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm I'm willing to try if you are, boss.
LEADFEMALE:Put it there, Smith.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Geoffrey, this might be a very good experience for both of them.
OTHERFEMALE:Especially Master William who will discover the joy of working for a Banks.
LEADMALE:Hey, Professor Kemp, Professor Meyers.
LEADMALE:Hey, Will, how are the subs today? Oh, well, you know, sort of like your lectures.
LEADMALE:Long, stale and full of baloney.
LEADMALE:I'm stupid.
SUPFEMALE:I just failed, didn't I? Look, check it out, here's a sub on the house.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Instant A.
LEADFEMALE:What up, Dex? Hey, look, man.
LEADFEMALE:I saw Donna the other night down at the quad and I told her breaking up with you was the biggest mistake she ever made.
OTHERMALE:So she'll see me again?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, man, she hates your guts.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, but look, there's always more fish in the sea.
SUPMALE:I should know.
LEADFEMALE:They call me Aquaman.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've spent the whole morning back in the stockroom.
SUPFEMALE:What a mess.
LEADMALE:Do you believe someone papered the ceiling with hundreds of Jet beauties? That's fly, ain't it? I like to think of it as my own Sistine Chapel.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well, Phillipe's been in there worshipping for two hours.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, relax little fellow.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll get your turn.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:What up, dog? Dog? Will, this is a place of business, not a kennel.
OTHERMALE:Therefore, you will greet each customer as 
OTHERFEMALE:"Hello, I'm" Your name here.
LEADMALE:"Welcome to The Peacock, where our motto 
LEADFEMALE:Whatever you want, we've got it.
LEADMALE:" I'll give that a shot, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:My name's Will.
OTHERMALE:Welcome to The Peacock, where our motto 
LEADMALE:Girl, whatever you got, I want it.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you're getting it all wrong.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, man, as long as I'm getting it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Will, personal relationships aside I'm your boss, and you have to listen to me.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Carlton, you say something? May I remind you, I'm the one issuing your paycheck? Yes, sir, General Shorcoff.
LEADFEMALE:That's the spirit, soldier.
LEADMALE:I am so frustrated.
LEADMALE:What's the matter? Mom and I wrote down a bunch of meteorological terms for me to memorize, and I keep screwing them up.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't I become an anchorperson? They don't have to know hardly anything.
LEADFEMALE:It's commendable that you wanna improve your skills.
LEADMALE:You don't have to impress those newsletter people.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to impress them.
LEADFEMALE:I want to smack them.
LEADMALE:Daddy you're a judge.
LEADMALE:Can't you just throw them in jail or something? Sweetheart, the worst thing you can do is blow this thing out of proportion.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if you ignore it, it will probably go away.
SUPMALE:Did you really refer to Hurricane Robert as Bobby? Well, Robert just sounded so serious.
LEADMALE:It was serious, darling.
LEADFEMALE:It wiped out half of Miami.
LEADMALE:Well, excuse me for trying to spread a little sunshine.
LEADMALE:Daddy, I just can't stand the idea of people hating me.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, people love to attack celebrities.
SUPFEMALE:It's part of the price you pay for being in the public eye.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call someone who's been through this.
OTHERFEMALE:Who's that, honey? Someone who knows what it's like to be hated.
LEADMALE:Oh, Shannen? Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary Banks.
LEADMALE:You remember that I Hate Brenda thing that you went through? What do you mean you don't know me? You spilled a drink on me at Roxbury.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hello? Boy, she's not gonna make many friends with that attitude.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, ladies.
SUPMALE:I'm Carlton Banks, Peacock manager.
SUPMALE:And I'm afraid these tables are for eating not loitering.
LEADFEMALE:We did eat.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you did.
LEADFEMALE:Seven minutes ago.
SUPFEMALE:Are you saying we have to leave? No, no, no.
LEADMALE:You can stay if you order something else.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I particularly recommend the shrimpy cocktail.
OTHERMALE:Will, I could use a little help out here.
LEADMALE:I ain't coming out, man! Fine, then you're not getting paid.
LEADMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:Carlton, I think we need to have a little talk, man.
LEADMALE:You know bird to nerd.
SUPMALE:Sorry, I'm busy.
OTHERMALE:So, ladies, have you decided?
SUPFEMALE:Drop dead.
LEADFEMALE:Excellent choice.
LEADMALE:Look around, man.
SUPMALE:The Peacock is a place where people just come to kick it, man.
LEADMALE:To relax.
LEADFEMALE:You know, get away from the pressures of class.
LEADMALE:If you start hassling them, they'll go somewhere else.
LEADFEMALE:Where? The closest competition is three blocks off campus.
OTHERMALE:Look, don't you see, Will? We've got these people by the textbooks.
LEADMALE:We can charge and pretty much do whatever we want.
OTHERFEMALE:This is like sex to you, isn't it? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know what? It doesn't turn me on, Carlton.
SUPMALE:I think you're being an idiot.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you think you're gonna do with that, mister? Marking up the prices, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Can't let you do that, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:These people are students.
LEADFEMALE:They're good people.
LEADMALE:Decent people.
LEADMALE:They can't afford to pay any more.
SUPFEMALE:Save it for someone who cares.
OTHERFEMALE:Freeze, man! Do what you got to do, cowboy.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, give me back my gun.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, as your boss I'm not gonna tolerate that kind of insubordination.
SUPMALE:You're not my boss.
SUPMALE:You're just some butt-kissing, apple-a-day suck up that got lucky.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:That little outburst is going to cost you a reduction in hours.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'll do you one better.
LEADFEMALE:How about zero hours? I quit! Oh, yeah? Well, well Don't ask me for any recommendation.
OTHERFEMALE:I know Will's mad, but this is ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, he hasn't talked to me in two days.
SUPMALE:What do you think I should do? Count your blessings.
SUPMALE:Hey, what's up G?
SUPFEMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you can't keep me.
LEADFEMALE:It's 
LEADFEMALE:That's what I 
LEADMALE:Well, you can't even right.
LEADMALE:Stay out of my face, man.
SUPFEMALE:I'm still not speaking to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Fine, be that way.
OTHERMALE:Master William I've never seen you behave so coldly.
LEADMALE:I like it.
SUPMALE:Well, G, a man has got to stand his ground.
OTHERFEMALE:A man also has to work to pay his bills.
OTHERFEMALE:Otherwise, I'd be out parasailing with these.
OTHERMALE:Seriously, what are you going to do for money? Already taken care of, G.
LEADMALE:Got me a brand new job, three blocks off campus.
OTHERFEMALE:The Chestless Touchdown.
LEADMALE:This is an outrage.
LEADMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, I swear that dent was in that car before I hit that mailbox!
LEADMALE:What dent?
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what were you saying? Those newsletter bozos put up a big "Honk, if you hate Hilary" billboard right at the corner of Sunset and Doheny.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, damn.
LEADFEMALE:That mean they took down the Naughty Nightie girl.
SUPMALE:Hilary! Hilary! More snow today with temperatures dropping to the low teens this evening.
OTHERFEMALE:Sweetheart, l
LEADMALE:Daddy, I have the greatest idea.
LEADFEMALE:If I watch the weather in New York I'll have a three-hour jump on the competition.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, that might not work every time.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, when you drove to work today you didn't by any chance go down Sunset Boulevard, did you? Oh, I couldn't.
SUPFEMALE:It was backed up for miles.
OTHERFEMALE:And everyone was honking like it was New Year's Eve.
SUPMALE:Chance of snow and a minus three wind chill.
LEADFEMALE:Well, my work is done.
SUPMALE:I'm going shopping.
OTHERMALE:Sweetheart, I've thought it over, you know, and you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna put an end this newsletter business.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I'm gonna head down to the law library and get right to work.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Daddy.
LEADMALE:Now, dress warm, it's gonna snow.
LEADMALE:Please don't go.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I apologize for performing the Heimlich maneuver on you.
LEADMALE:I really thought you were choking.
LEADFEMALE:And now, to create a more festive mood The Peacock is proud to present music from Hawaii.
OTHERFEMALE:The entertainment charge has already been added into your check.
SUPFEMALE:Also, we are pleased to announce that the proceeds from our new pay toilets have enabled us to buy this brand new metal detector.
LEADMALE:Remember, less flatware theft means lower prices for you our valued consumer.
LEADMALE:Man, they ought to draw a chalk outline around this place.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:So, what can I get you? A sandwich? A T-shirt? Peacock-a-cola?
LEADFEMALE:I made that one up myself.
SUPMALE:It shows.
LEADMALE:Actually, I just came by to see Will.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith is no longer employed here.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like he took everybody with him too.
SUPFEMALE:They didn't leave because of Will.
SUPFEMALE:They left because of me.
LEADMALE:I mean, they just need time to get acclimated to some of my new policies.
SUPFEMALE:Phillipe told me you cut the teeth marks off the pickles and reuse them.
LEADMALE:Look, Jazz, I'm in real trouble.
LEADMALE:My professor's coming down to check on business.
LEADFEMALE:You know a lot of people.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you can bring some of them by.
LEADFEMALE:What's in it for me? Well you know how your pigeons are always getting sick all the time? My babies.
LEADFEMALE:I'll pay their vet bill for the rest of the year.
LEADFEMALE:Even Oliver? He has a heart murmur.
LEADFEMALE:Even Oliver.
OTHERFEMALE:Be back in an hour.
LEADMALE:Jazz, what is this? Pretty good job, huh? It's nice to have friends you can call on at the last minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Oliver.
LEADFEMALE:Banks! What is going on here? Professor Milligan.
SUPMALE:Well, see, sir.
LEADMALE:I've managed to diversify our clientele.
LEADMALE:If anybody asks, I've been with you all day.
LEADMALE:Banks, I don't know what you've done to this place.
LEADFEMALE:But whatever it is, I suggest that you fix it, or I'll yank you off this project.
SUPFEMALE:But But, sir, what? Jazz, you better get those freaks out of here immediately.
LEADMALE:You're the boss.
SUPMALE:All right, you weirdos, beat it.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I've got some news.
LEADFEMALE:So do I.
SUPFEMALE:I've filed the necessary court papers.
LEADMALE:We'll have that newsletter killed in no time.
SUPMALE:Daddy, don't you dare.
LEADFEMALE:My ratings this week have gone through the roof.
LEADFEMALE:They're even talking about letting me announce the lottery number.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what about your reputation? So, what if a few people don't like me? I'm a hit.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, think about this.
SUPFEMALE:Is this the kind of fame you want? People are gonna be tuning in, not to hear your weather report but looking for a laugh.
LEADMALE:Hello? You're kidding.
LEADMALE:Well, of course, I'm interested.
LEADFEMALE:Who was that? They're thinking of making me an anchorperson.
SUPMALE:I've gotta brush up.
SUPFEMALE:Who is this Bosnia person I keep hearing about? Forty-eight, 49, 50.
LEADMALE:Have fun with them potatoes, spud.
OTHERMALE:Oh, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I've thought about it, and I can't let you do this to yourself.
LEADMALE:Hey, come on, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Come back when I'm on a break, all right? Excuse me, may I cut in? Carlton, what are you doing? This is a sports bar, man.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I know you only left The Peacock because of your foolish pride.
SUPMALE:No, I left because of my foolish cousin.
LEADMALE:Will, you can't be happy here.
SUPFEMALE:This is a franchise.
SUPMALE:The kind of place where they treat employees like faceless, anonymous nobodies.
OTHERMALE:Will Smith, come on up here.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you've only been here four days but the staff has voted you employee of the week! Let's have a hand for Will Smith, huh? And by the way for winning this honor, you get the weekend off with pay.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Oh, Carlton, save me from this hellhole.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Will, I was willing to let bygones be bygones.
LEADFEMALE:But I can see it's no use.
LEADMALE:It is no use, right? Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I guess the dream is over.
SUPFEMALE:I'm obviously not management material.
SUPFEMALE:All those summers at business camp were just a waste of time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Carlton, hold up, man.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you're not a bad manager.
LEADFEMALE:You just stink when it comes to people.
LEADMALE:And you stink when it comes to business.
SUPFEMALE:So, what does that tell you? That we both stink.
LEADMALE:Yes, individually.
SUPFEMALE:But together we'd smell like success.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say, Will? No, man.
LEADMALE:I got a good thing here.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Will.
LEADMALE:I'll make it worth your while.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give you priority shifts, and you can wear your own clothes and you've got unlimited use of the stockroom.
SUPFEMALE:No, man.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do you want, Will? You know, I kind of want you to beg me.
LEADFEMALE:Beg? I don't know how to beg.
LEADFEMALE:I'm rich.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, I'll give you $ 1000 if you come back.
LEADMALE:Gosh, you don't get it, do you? Carlton, it isn't always about facts and figures and green pieces of paper with dead presidents on them.
LEADFEMALE:Look, a man's most valuable possession is his self-respect.
LEADFEMALE:Make it 2000.
LEADMALE:All right, let me go get my hat.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Professor Mil, chill.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, man.
LEADMALE:Look Now Listen, hey, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:No, hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, well, listen.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, I got it.
OTHERMALE:Okay, I've got it.
LEADMALE:You ready? Let's pick it up from right there.
LEADMALE:
