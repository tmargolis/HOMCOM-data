SUPFEMALE:Will, I'm ready.
SUPFEMALE:You said you'd teach me one of your basketball tricks.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, you know, my moves are kind of like top secret, Nick.
LEADMALE:I mean, I could show you, but then I'd have to kill you.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe I'll make an exception this one time, all right? All right.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:D me up, D me up.
SUPFEMALE: All right, check it out.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, this is called the Will Smith Hoop Dream, Dunk on Hakeem Down the Lane, House of Pain pass.
LEADFEMALE:I see you wasn't ready for that one.
LEADMALE:Back in Philly, they used to call me Will "The 747" Smith.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna know why?
LEADMALE:Why? Because I'm about to jet.
LEADMALE: This weekend? Oh, I'd love to, Thad, but I'm gonna lay low.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, it's nothing serious, just the flu.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's so sweet.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Thad? I thought you were dating Kyle.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
SUPFEMALE:He's the flu.
LEADFEMALE:Go, girl.
SUPFEMALE:You see what I'm saying? It sounds like it's raining men.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope y'all are taking notes.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, stop being all freaky.
LEADMALE:Hi, Will.
SUPFEMALE:What you doing? Five to ten if you don't take your hands off me.
LEADFEMALE: Hill, what you think? You did a pretty good show today, huh? Three words: Stink.
LEADMALE:Stank.
OTHERMALE:Stunk.
LEADFEMALE:It was the worst show we have ever done.
OTHERMALE:We need better guests.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be getting all mad at me.
SUPMALE:I'm just the assistant talent coordinator.
LEADFEMALE:If I had some more responsibility, maybe we'd have some better guests.
LEADMALE:Then get me someone great for tomorrow's show.
SUPFEMALE:And if it were my responsibility, then I'd do it.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'm telling you to do it.
LEADMALE:All right, and if I thought you meant it, then I'd get it done.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, my baby can definitely get it done.
SUPFEMALE:Don't make me turn the hose on you, all right? Will, I need more stimulating guests.
SUPMALE:I need someone who can hold my attention for more than three seconds.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:How about we get? I gotta go.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, what's going on, man?  Would you like to buy a vowel?  You know, this trial is gonna be the death of me.
LEADFEMALE:We lost another juror today.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? Hey, did you check under your robe? I can see you're not in the mood for that right now.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Right here.
LEADFEMALE:Right here.
OTHERMALE:So come on, man.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? He was writing a book.
LEADFEMALE:The bailiff found him hiding in the men's room with his laptop.
SUPMALE:You sure he wasn't just downloading his floppy? 
LEADFEMALE:Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Shut up.
LEADMALE:Can you hear me? Hi, I'm Carlton Banks, and I joined Great Introductions to give you red-hot mamas a chance to take a walk on the wild side.
LEADFEMALE:So climb on board.
LEADMALE: Hm.
SUPMALE:A tad forward.
OTHERMALE: I am tan, I am a tourist and I'd love to give a lucky mademoiselle like you a chance to meet moi.
SUPMALE:That felt close.
LEADFEMALE: Do you guys mind?  What is your problem, Pepe Le Puny? Hardy har har.
SUPFEMALE:And in a related story Judge Philip Banks has dismissed yet another juror in the Show-Biz Madam Case.
SUPFEMALE:As cameras are not allowed in his courtroom we have an artist's rendering of his action.
LEADFEMALE:Specific details are not yet available as to why the juror was dismissed.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, I know that guy.
LEADFEMALE:Of course you do.
LEADFEMALE:That's my Dad, you half-life.
OTHERMALE:Not him, the other dude.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what, you knew him? He's my barber.
SUPMALE:The dude that cut that jack-o'-lantern in your head last Halloween? That's the guy.
LEADMALE:It'd have been great if that candle hadn't burned the roof of my mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, do you think he'd do Hilary? Why not? She got a nice big head.
LEADMALE:This place is so tiny.
LEADFEMALE:I can't even imagine how small the facial room must be.
LEADMALE:Hill, why don't you come on over here and sit down? Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Read this Jet magazine and let me handle my business, all right?
OTHERMALE:Okay, you're next.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Whoa, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you know I'm gonna have to charge you extra for working around these ears.
LEADFEMALE: Well, no, hold up, my man.
OTHERMALE:Actually, I'm not here to get a haircut.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you in the wrong place, fool.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, a friend of mine sent me.
SUPFEMALE:You know Jazz? The idiot that put the candle in his mouth?
LEADFEMALE:That's him.

SUPMALE:Who? Ha, ha! That's very funny.
LEADFEMALE:I would be really honored if you would be a guest on my show.
LEADFEMALE:What is it with you people? First, you got Geraldo coming in here you know his head is as empty as Al Capone's vault, then you had Montel.
OTHERFEMALE:I told Montel, "Yeah, I'll do your show when you grow some hair.
SUPMALE:" Now, listen, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told them.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not interested in doing tabloid television.

LEADFEMALE:Now what am I supposed to do? Please, for carnations and a little baby's breath? Nothing.

LEADMALE:In five, four, three, two  Hello and welcome to Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:We're very excited today to have as our guest recently dismissed juror from the Show-Biz Madam Trial, George Howlings.
SUPMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Welcome.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you so much.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess what we're all dying to know is why you were dismissed.
LEADFEMALE:You know, they told the press I was writing a book, but that's not it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh? Tell us what it really was.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they said I was crazy, but I'm not crazy.
LEADFEMALE:But you wanna know who is crazy? Maybe I shouldn't say this on TV.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, George.
OTHERMALE:Just between you and me who was crazy? That lard-butt of a judge.
OTHERFEMALE:That man is crazy as they come.
SUPFEMALE:GEORGE : What does it take to become a judge these days? Now, if you ask me, that man was very incompetent.
SUPMALE:Couldn't judge a beauty pageant.
SUPFEMALE:About as useless as a no-mouthed dog at a Frisbee contest.
LEADMALE:If I ever see him, I'll lower him like a cheap carpet.
LEADMALE:And it looked to me, he dozed off every now and then.
SUPMALE:HILARY: George Probably dreaming about that bony-legged prosecutor.
SUPMALE:I think they got something going on.
LEADFEMALE:Ain't that right, Will Smith? Hill.
LEADFEMALE:Hill.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold up.
LEADFEMALE:He's gonna kill us.
SUPFEMALE:Will, it's not like it was our fault.
LEADMALE:We can't control what someone says.
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy will understand that.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I hope so.
LEADMALE:And if not, I'll just blame the whole thing on you.
LEADMALE:Oops.
LEADMALE:Did I say that out loud? Is he in there? No, the coast is Clear! Hi, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:You look so handsome.
LEADMALE:Oh, not bad for a lard butt, huh? I guess there's no reason to ask whether or not you saw the show today.
LEADMALE:Oh, I saw the show.
LEADFEMALE:ALL: We all saw the show.
LEADMALE:Wait, wait, hold up, Uncle Phil.
OTHERMALE:Now, before you get started I wanna let you know that finger pointing isn't gonna get us nowhere.
LEADMALE:And also that it's not called The Will Show.
OTHERMALE:Oh, please.
OTHERFEMALE:You're the one that introduced me to that nut.
LEADMALE:Daddy, punish him.
LEADMALE:He needs tough love.
LEADMALE:That is enough.
SUPFEMALE:I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life.
SUPFEMALE:And to think the two people responsible for it are my own family.
LEADFEMALE:My own flesh and blood.
LEADMALE:Um Technically, Uncle Phil, I'm not really your flesh and blood.
LEADMALE:See, my Mom and Aunt Viv, they I see where you going with this though.
SUPFEMALE:Do you?
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, I can see.
LEADFEMALE:Pssh-pssh! Then tell me, what is it? Haven't I done enough for you? Taking you into my home, huh? Treated you with respect.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I did something to hurt you, is that it? No.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:No, that's not it.
SUPMALE:Then why?
SUPFEMALE:I don't I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:And you my own daughter.
OTHERFEMALE:My first-born.
OTHERFEMALE: I don't know if there's a knife that could cut as deeply.
LEADFEMALE:We tried to tell you yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:That's your excuse? You didn't have the sense to know that that man would be angry with me for dismissing him? You didn't have the common sense to know that? I don't have any common sense.
OTHERFEMALE:You two have profoundly hurt and disappointed me.
LEADMALE: Unc Uncle Uncle Ph Unc You should be ashamed of yourselves.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Aunt Aunt
SUPFEMALE:A Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:You understand, don't you? Nicky.
SUPFEMALE:Come on Ow! Man.
SUPMALE:Hill, you know what you gonna say?
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just gonna speak from the heart.
SUPMALE:Hey, now just remember, this is from both of us.
LEADMALE:Don't be out there taking all the credit.
SUPFEMALE:Have a good show.
SUPMALE:Here we go.
OTHERFEMALE:In five seconds, four, three, two Hello and welcome to Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:Today's show is a very special tribute to fathers.
LEADMALE:But before we get to our guests I'd like to say something special about a very important man in my life.
LEADFEMALE:My father, Judge Philip Banks.
SUPFEMALE:Yesterday, a dismissed juror in the Show-Biz Madam Trial came on the show and said some really icky things about him.
LEADFEMALE:My cousin Will and I were, well, to say the least, shocked.
SUPMALE:And now Daddy won't even talk to us.
SUPMALE:WILL: He won't say nothing.
LEADFEMALE:HILARY : And we feel like strangers in our own house.
LEADFEMALE:Please, Daddy, forgive us.
OTHERMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:You should be ashamed of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! And we don't know what we supposed to do.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, no one answered the front door.
OTHERMALE:I have a package for a Carlton Banks.
LEADMALE:That's me.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, not another rejection.
OTHERFEMALE:Bad news? I sent this to Last Chance Video Dating.
LEADFEMALE:You know, "We guarantee you a date," except if your name is Carlton Banks.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
SUPMALE:It doesn't work if your name is Michelle Williams either.
SUPMALE:You tried this?
OTHERFEMALE:I tried them all.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't expect someone like you to have trouble meeting people.
LEADMALE:The only people I meet are dogs and shut-ins.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't it be easier? I mean, why can't you just open the door and meet someone nice? Well, bye.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Would you? Uh Uh Like to go out Saturday night? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, I'm not
SUPMALE:Coming on too strong? Not at all.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Sweet mother of God, that's a firm handshake.
OTHERFEMALE:Trust me, if Daddy saw the show this afternoon, everything will be fine.
LEADMALE:And if he didn't, we'll show it to him.
LEADFEMALE:Now, do you know how to work one of these things? What are you two doing?  Hey, man.
LEADFEMALE:Did you see anything, I don't know, good on TV today? No.
SUPMALE:So you didn't see the show?
SUPMALE:Oh, I saw the show.
SUPMALE:And now thanks to you, not only am I an incompetent judge, but an unfit parent.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, what do you have planned for tomorrow? Perhaps snapshots of me in the bathtub, huh? Or a video of me chasing stray dogs in my car.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, you don't do that, do you? You two are the most irresponsible All right, I've heard enough.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I did see something good on TV today.
LEADFEMALE:I saw two people begging for forgiveness and feeling very badly for hurting someone that they love.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please, Vivian.

OTHERFEMALE:What's done is done.
SUPMALE:I just wanna sit here and watch a little TV.
LEADMALE:LENO : Anybody see the Hilary show the other day? They had a dismissed juror from the Show-Biz Madam Case insulting Judge Banks, who just happens to be Hilary's father.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, here's a family that really puts the "fun" back in dysfunctional, isn't it?  Speaking of Judge Banks, we have a special tribute to him tonight.
