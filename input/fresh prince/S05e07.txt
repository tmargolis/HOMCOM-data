LEADFEMALE:Mail call.
LEADFEMALE:Wall Street Journal for Master Carlton.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:A statement from The Bank of Bel-Air for Miss Ashley.
LEADMALE:And a plain brown package for me.
LEADMALE:I'll be taking my break now.
OTHERMALE:Bank of Bel-Air? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, bye.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:See you later, Ash.
SUPFEMALE:Something's afoot.
LEADMALE:And something's a foot and a half.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm talking about Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:I know where every penny of this family's money is.
LEADMALE:And none of it is in the Bank of Bel-Air.
OTHERMALE:So? So, obviously, Ashley's hoarding money.
SUPFEMALE:And I know why.
LEADMALE:She's amassing a private fortune so she can buy out the family business in a hostile takeover.
OTHERMALE:A sweater and a string of pearls and you'd be Angela Lansbury.
SUPMALE:  
LEADMALE:Ouch! Shoot! Ashley, what are you doing? Changing for school.
SUPMALE:See, um Today is, uh, casual day.
LEADMALE:Well, uh, that sounds like the, uh, truth.
OTHERMALE:Actually, Will, I've been keeping a secret.
SUPMALE:Lf I don't tell someone, I'm gonna explode.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Don't tell me.
SUPFEMALE:If I know, I can't say I don't know when you get busted and Uncle Phil start rounding up the usual suspects.
LEADFEMALE:And I am the usual suspects.
SUPFEMALE:I dropped out of Bel-Air Academy.
LEADMALE:I've been going to public school since the beginning of the semester.
LEADMALE:I didn't hear that.
SUPFEMALE:I said I dropped out.
LEADMALE:I heard what you said, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Ash, what are you? How can you do that? It was easy.
LEADMALE:I forged all the papers took Daddy's tuition money and put it in an interest-bearing account.
OTHERFEMALE:Pretty good, huh? You're tripping? No, no No, no.
SUPFEMALE:You're worse than tripping.
SUPFEMALE:You've fallen and you can't get up.
LEADMALE:And he will find out.
LEADMALE:And when he does, he's going to ground you into dust.
OTHERMALE:Will, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:Everything's so fake at Bel-Air Academy.
LEADFEMALE:The teachers, the kids, the noses.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't take it anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Please don't tell Daddy.
LEADMALE: I ain't gonna dime you but if he subpoenas me, I'm gonna be singing like Luther.
SUPFEMALE: I'm in.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Will, come here.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:"Bank of Bel-Air"? How did you tap into those records? Well, I overrode the configuration files and deleted the encrypted password.
LEADMALE:Goodness.
OTHERMALE: It's Hack Boy, the stubby-fingered avenger.
LEADMALE:Go ahead and joke.
LEADFEMALE:But sometimes you have to go around the law to expose the greater evil.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley's hiding $10,000.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where did she get that kind of money? Maybe she's Counterfeit Girl, the sister of Hack Boy.
LEADFEMALE: Look, it's none of your business.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just butt out? Oh, I see.
LEADMALE:She's already gotten to you.
SUPFEMALE:Trust no one.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I don't get it.
LEADMALE:My producer told me that I'm losing my black audience.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't see why, Hil.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you got the best talk show on TV.
SUPFEMALE:You really think so? Well, what was your favorite topic? Uh Uh, the one with the, uh Dysfunctional, uh, single parent, uh, gang member nuns.
LEADFEMALE:Hil, I've never actually seen one of your shows.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:Look, listen, Hilary, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You need to do some stuff that reaches out to your brothers and sisters.
SUPFEMALE:Why? What have Carlton and Ashley ever done for me? Whoa, if it isn't Belly D.
SUPMALE:Williams.
LEADMALE:Just kidding.
LEADFEMALE:You look great.
LEADMALE:Where you all going? Fundraiser at the museum.
LEADMALE:Do I hate these things.
OTHERFEMALE:Why agree to be on the Board of Trustees? Well, I'm a judge and judges are supposed to be on boards.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's just that with you, it's usually a smorgasbord.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Hi, baby.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:Will, I need to talk to you.
OTHERFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE: It's girl talk.
LEADMALE:Will, my homeroom teacher insists on meeting my parents.
OTHERFEMALE:I've already canceled five times.
LEADFEMALE:She wants to see someone tonight.
LEADMALE: You're just gonna have to come clean with Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I can't.
OTHERMALE:I'm waiting for the right time.
LEADFEMALE:And when is that? When we go shopping for my cap and gown.
LEADMALE:That's assuming that you're gonna live till graduation.
LEADMALE: Will, I need your help.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, let me sum this up for you in two 
LEADMALE:Unh-unh.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I didn't want to have to say this.
OTHERFEMALE:But it's your fault I'm in this mess.
SUPMALE:My fault? Oh, this one here gonna be good.
LEADMALE:Before you showed up, I was leading a nice, sheltered existence.
LEADMALE:But you made me see there was a whole world beyond Bel-Air filled with people who take public transportation and don't have butlers.
LEADMALE:I like that world.
LEADFEMALE:It's like a drug, Will, and you got me hooked.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you better go cold turkey before you wind up a dead duck.
SUPFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:Ashley, no.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm sorry that you got yourself into this little predicament.
LEADMALE:But trying to blame it on me, now, that's just low.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:I can't believe I said that.
SUPMALE:You've always been so good to me.
LEADMALE:I'm just so desperate.
SUPMALE:I'm a terrible, terrible person.
LEADFEMALE: No No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Look, don't cry, Ashley.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, all right.
SUPFEMALE:We'll figure a way out of this, all right? Thanks, Will.
LEADFEMALE:You're a saint.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:What was that? What? You smiled.
LEADFEMALE:I saw your reflection in the window.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:That was a happy smile.
LEADMALE:See? I don't believe I fell for them tears.
SUPFEMALE:Girl, you're on your own.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, fine! Be that way! But if I go down, I'm taking you with me.
LEADMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:I didn't do nothing.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:You wanna call your parents and see what happened? No.
SUPMALE:Maybe we should reschedule again.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:Is there something you wanna tell me? Miss Sharpe
SUPMALE:the truth is I  Ashley.
SUPMALE:There's my little bran muffin.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Is this your father? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
OTHERMALE:Miss Sharpe, this is, uh, Daddy.

OTHERMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:How could something so smooth be called sharp? Yes.
SUPMALE:Well, nice to finally meet you, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks.
OTHERMALE:Rhaul, please.
SUPFEMALE: Rhaul.
SUPMALE:Oh, and welcome back from the Orient.
OTHERFEMALE: God bless you, Miss Sharpe.
SUPMALE:It is Miss Sharpe, isn't it?
SUPFEMALE:Yes, it is.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:You're a fine teacher, Miss Sharpe.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, I bet you could teach me a thing or two  On the academic side, I mean.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, will Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Banks be joining us? Uh, no, I'm single.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, um, Ashley's mother ran out on us.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley was but a mere tyke at the time.
LEADMALE:I had to be both Mommy and Daddy.
LEADMALE:We went from training wheels to training bras.
LEADFEMALE:They both came off too soon, didn't they kitten? Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Well, anyway, about Ashley's schoolwork.
OTHERMALE:You should be very proud of her.
LEADMALE:She does excellent work.
SUPMALE:She participates actively in class and she's just a pleasure to have around.
SUPFEMALE:You know, that runs in the family.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Well.
LEADMALE:Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any questions? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Not a one.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you for your time.
SUPFEMALE:What do you say we have the next meeting at my place, huh?
SUPFEMALE:Well, I don't know.
LEADMALE:L
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for being so understanding.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Daddy.
LEADMALE:It's time for your pill.
LEADMALE: It's a miracle this whole thing worked.
SUPMALE: What you talking about, girl? Denzel ain't the only brother than can act.
LEADMALE:Well, at least this buys me some time before I have to break the news to Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I have to get my history books.
OTHERMALE:You stay right here, Rhaul.
LEADFEMALE:I made that up.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks, did you forget something?
SUPFEMALE:Uh, you know, I'm glad you asked.
LEADMALE:I, uh, forgot to give you the number to my direct line.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I'm very flattered, but
LEADMALE:You know that is an absolutely intoxicating fragrance that you're wearing.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Come closer.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:That's a fake mustache.
LEADMALE:No, it's not.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I don't know who you are, but I'm calling your real parents right now.
LEADMALE:Will? No, it's not.
OTHERFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Miss Sharpe.
SUPMALE:It's not.
LEADFEMALE:You just had to go back.
LEADFEMALE:We were out the door, Will.
LEADFEMALE:We were free.
LEADFEMALE:Free! Look, ease up, Miss Tubman.
SUPMALE:Miss Sharpe gave us the weekend to break it to Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Now, let's go over this evil twin story again.
LEADMALE: I'm sure the mayor's mother meant it as a compliment.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? Then I should be honored that she thinks I look like a black Alfred Hitchcock.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, kids.
LEADFEMALE: Good evening.
SUPMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE: Ashley.
LEADMALE:Ashley.
LEADFEMALE: Okay.
SUPMALE:Mom, Dad, it's like this.
LEADFEMALE:Will has something he wants to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't got nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Um Your Honor, uh now, before you deliver your verdict the defense dictates that you sustain the motion of the ocean.
SUPFEMALE:Because most parents want the truth, but they can't handle the truth.
LEADFEMALE:So in conclusion, I move for a change of venue.
LEADFEMALE:You give us a half-hour head start.
SUPMALE:What the hell are you talking about? Daddy, I withdrew from Bel-Air Academy six weeks ago and transferred to Morris High.
LEADMALE:You what? I'm not mad.
OTHERMALE:You're not? And you thought he was gonna be mad.
SUPMALE:Well, you transferred out, you'll transfer back.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow when I wake up Ashley will be back in Bel-Air Academy and maybe Will won't even be here.
SUPMALE:Daddy, I'm not going back.
LEADMALE:Now I'm mad.
SUPMALE:You knew about this.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Will didn't do anything wrong.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, you tell him.
LEADMALE:If anything, I should thank Will.
SUPFEMALE:He's the whole reason I transferred.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:Pull it back, baby.
LEADMALE:Pull it back.
LEADMALE:Like I'm doing.
SUPMALE:Pull it back.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, Will made me realize how limited my life has been.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna be with real people with real concerns.
LEADMALE:Oh, and people in Bel-Air don't have real concerns?
SUPFEMALE:It's pronounced Porsche.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Porsche.
SUPFEMALE:Porsche.
LEADFEMALE:Porsche.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, honey, you lied to us.
OTHERMALE:I knew you'd say no.
SUPMALE:But, honey, we just want you to have the best education possible.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, Bel-Air Academy doesn't equal better.
SUPFEMALE:You and Dad both went to public schools.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, good point, Ash.
LEADMALE:Can't we at least discuss this?
LEADMALE:I believe we just did.
SUPMALE:San Tropez.
LEADFEMALE:San Tropez.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I took your advice and reached out to our brothers and sisters.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Hello and welcome to Hilary.
SUPMALE:As an African American woman I'd like to dedicate this show to all my sisters.
SUPMALE:Presenting fashions from the motherland.
LEADMALE: Inga is wearing a hand-woven dashiki from Nairobi.
SUPFEMALE:Her jewelry is from the Ivory Coast and her weave is from Whoopi Goldberg's House of Hair.
OTHERMALE:Work it, you Nubian princess, you.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:Our next model is Buffie.
OTHERMALE:Um, Hil, I just I I really wanna commend your attempt to reach out to your African American viewers
LEADMALE:but you forgot one thing.
OTHERMALE:What? African Americans.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Carlton, she went to private school, didn't she? Touché.
SUPFEMALE:But there's a bigger issue here.
SUPFEMALE:People talk.
SUPMALE:What if an admissions officer at Princeton found out my sister was going to public school? I mean, my God.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Daddy, I'd like you to meet someone.
LEADFEMALE:This is Miss Sharpe.
LEADMALE:She's my homeroom teacher at Morris High.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss Sharpe, this is my father.
LEADFEMALE:The real one.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Pleased to meet you.
SUPMALE:Same here.
SUPMALE:Why don't you have a seat?
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I thought if we met I could allay any concerns you might have.
OTHERMALE:Well, Miss Sharpe you made quite an impression upon my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:But, with all due respect, I am thoroughly satisfied with the education Ashley is receiving at Bel-Air Academy.
LEADMALE:Perhaps you're not aware of Morris High's academic achievements.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't doubt that Morris High is a fine institution but I've already made my decision.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry to hear that.
LEADMALE:One of the things I've admired about Ashley is her open mind.
SUPFEMALE:Well, she gets that from her mother.
OTHERMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, the phone Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, man.
SUPMALE:I can explain everything.
LEADMALE:Look, I was dizzy, then I came I was Uh, you must be Will.
OTHERMALE:I'm Miss Sharpe.
OTHERMALE:Oh, nice to meet you for the first time ever in life.
LEADMALE:Hey, you know, Uncle Phil, that's the first time I ever met her in life.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Banks, we were profiled here in Education Today.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if you read it, you'll reconsider.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry you had to drive out here for nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Nice to meet you for the first time ever in life.
SUPFEMALE:Whoo.
LEADFEMALE:She really something, huh? Hard to say no to her.
SUPFEMALE:Not if you're a parent.
OTHERFEMALE:Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Be reasonable.
LEADFEMALE:When's the last time a teacher from Bel-Air Academy came to the house? Look, the girl went and changed schools behind my back.
LEADMALE:Now, in this house, that constitutes a capital crime.
LEADFEMALE:But she had a good reason.
LEADFEMALE:Look, my wife's nephew.
LEADFEMALE:I want Ashley in Bel-Air Academy where there's a controlled environment.
LEADFEMALE:I know who's there.
LEADFEMALE:But, more importantly, I know who's not.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm telling you.
LEADMALE:I went to both public and private schools and I'm saying in public school, it's more different kinds of people.
OTHERFEMALE:In Bel-Air Academy, everybody cut from the same mold.
OTHERFEMALE:If you ask me, you acting like a Snob.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna just go.
LEADFEMALE:And a one and a Hell with that.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:The forecast for the
SUPFEMALE:Philip, look here.
LEADFEMALE:Morris High School is fourth in the country among magnet schools.
SUPFEMALE:Magnet schools? Maybe that's why they need metal detectors, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:This is important.
LEADMALE:Don't make jokes.
LEADMALE:Vivian, we've made our decision.
SUPMALE:We? No, you've made a decision.
LEADMALE:I'm a college professor.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't even ask my opinion.
LEADMALE:Didn't I? I'm sure I did.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think? I think we should at least consider it.
LEADMALE:Sometimes I think we work so hard to give our kids what we didn't have sometimes we forget to give them what we did have.
SUPMALE:Good morning, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Good morning, Ashley.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:What are you eating? Food.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Cutting the tension.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, everyone.
LEADMALE:Hey, Hil.
LEADFEMALE:So, what's today's black topic? Amish rap stars? I'm through chasing one specific demographic.
SUPMALE:Thanks to my leopard skin midriff top, I hit an all-time high with male viewers.
LEADMALE:I got more men yesterday than Sally Jesse Raphael gets in a year.
SUPFEMALE:How hard could that be? 
SUPMALE:Where are you going?
LEADMALE:School.
LEADMALE:Since when do you wear a uniform to public school? What are you talking about? Your mother and I had a long talk last night.
OTHERFEMALE:I called Miss Sharpe and made an appointment to check it out.
SUPMALE:Now, if I'm satisfied with what I see, you can give it a shot for a semester.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna be late.
LEADFEMALE:Go change.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Uncle Phil, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:
