LEADFEMALE:I've worked for your father for 20 years.
LEADFEMALE:He's seen me through some very hard times.
SUPFEMALE:Even paid for my dear mother's cataract surgery.
LEADMALE:The extra money could get you that Beemer.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's not as if he gave her a kidney.

OTHERMALE:"Dr.
SUPMALE:Whitehorn.
LEADMALE:Psychologist"? His specialty is relationship counseling.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Banks, Will and I are in love.
OTHERFEMALE:We don't need any counseling.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:But I could damn sure go for some Reese's Pieces.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Now, look, look, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, marriage is difficult at any age.
LEADFEMALE:Now, all counseling will do is give you tools to make your relationship work.
LEADMALE:I mean, you wouldn't drive a car without taking at least a few lessons first.
LEADFEMALE:Look here, Uncle Phil, I'm from Philly.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what I mean? I was driving when I was 11, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, that was in the good old days before The Club.
LEADFEMALE:Hear what I'm saying? That'll put a crimp in the plans, you know.
LEADMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, thanks a lot, man, but we both go to school and we work.
SUPMALE:We really don't have time for that.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, that's a shame.
LEADMALE:Because I was gonna pay for your honeymoon anywhere in the world you wanted to go.
LEADFEMALE: Hey, baby, what's Swahili for "ching-ching"?  I guess what I'm trying to say is, you know, we don't need to be here.
LEADFEMALE:We happy.

SUPFEMALE:Yes, very happy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know them little yellow smiley faces? Just put some Hershey syrup on them, you got us, you know.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Then all I have to do is give you the skills to maintain that enthusiasm.
OTHERMALE:Oh, if you mean what I think you mean, I got skills, you know.
LEADMALE:I was talking about interpersonal relationship skills.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's what I meant.
OTHERMALE:That's what I was thinking.
LEADFEMALE:The two most 
SUPMALE:respect and communication.
SUPMALE:You see, it's very important  Oh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Whitehorn.
LEADMALE:Ugh, it's you.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Rita, you are sucking me dry.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you want more alimony, you talk to my first two wives, all right?  Never get married on a dare.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Now, uh, where were we? Um, respect and communication.
SUPFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:But look, for now before tomorrow's group session, I'd like to ask questions.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, cool, questions.
LEADMALE:Knock yourself out.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Uh, where do you see yourselves Ah, that's an easy one.
LEADFEMALE:Ten years, I see us, you know kind of like the Huxtables, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Except I'm not gonna be delivering babies, I'm gonna be making them, you know.
LEADFEMALE:You know.
LEADMALE:But first, I figure we'd start out with Will, Jr.
SUPFEMALE:, you know.
LEADMALE:Then Willfred, then Willoughby, then Willard, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Then Willis.
SUPFEMALE:Will, stop.
OTHERFEMALE:"Will Stop"?  That ain't no good name.
LEADMALE:Now, Willstafa, you know.
LEADMALE:That's strong, you know, like, kind of a Lion King kind of feel.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Will Simba.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, we'll come back to that.
LEADMALE:Look, let's take another question.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, where will you be living?
OTHERMALE:That's an easy one.
LEADMALE:Right, baby?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Cleveland.
SUPFEMALE:Philly.
LEADMALE:Oh, this ought to be good.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that new little Beemer of yours runs like a dream, doesn't it? Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:How should I know? You've been hogging it ever since I signed the papers.
SUPMALE:Just come on upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:You know that table in Daddy's study? I need you to carry it out to the car.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a pool table.
SUPMALE:Duh.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Miss Hilary, I'm sorry, but I have duties here to attend to.
SUPMALE:Besides, I'm still worn out from last night.
LEADMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:I just had you do a little yard work.
LEADMALE:I don't believe blacktopping your tennis court falls into that category.
OTHERFEMALE:You are so lazy.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Not too lazy to quit.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, where have you been?
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Last thing you said 
OTHERFEMALE:"I just need to step outside for a little fresh air.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:"
SUPFEMALE:That was seven hours ago.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, don't get into a hissy fit, sir.
LEADMALE:I left dinner in the oven.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank goodness.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we were gonna have to eat what Daddy gave us.
SUPFEMALE:God help us.
LEADFEMALE:You'd think a guy who eats so much would at least know his way around the kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Lisa, hi.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Will?
SUPMALE:Will who? 
SUPFEMALE:Will, was there a problem in therapy? Man, we are this close to breaking up.
LEADMALE:Boy, that stuff doesn't work at all.
LEADMALE: Oh, thanks, babe.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't hurt me! What is your problem? Me?  Baby, just tell me one 
LEADMALE:Did you put something on or did you take something off? Trust me, the next time I decide to take something off you will be too old and blind to care.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, this is just stupid.
LEADFEMALE:We shouldn't be fighting like this.
LEADMALE: Okay, baby, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Aww.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, put it there, dude.
OTHERFEMALE:What?
SUPMALE:You have some nerve.
LEADMALE:So you expect me to be a gourmet chef, raise eight kids and look beautiful 24 hours a day? Too much? And what exactly are you gonna be doing? 
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be supporting y'all.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, on what? That one-figure salary that you pull down at the Peacock? Oh, no, you did not.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no You know what? I could yell I could scream.
OTHERFEMALE:I could even call you some names.
LEADFEMALE:But you know what? One of us has to be the mature one.
