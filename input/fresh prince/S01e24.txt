LEADFEMALE:Shouldn't she be playing with those toy ponies with the pink hair? Carlton, it's just puppy love.
SUPMALE:Don't you remember your first crush? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:It was Tootie in The Facts of Life.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:You had a love thing for Tootie? When did you get over it? What do you mean "get over it"? I'd still love to meet her someday.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder what I'd say.
OTHERMALE:How about, "Hello, Tootie, I'm Fruity"? Just because you've never been in love I've got the perfect idea for Ashley's birthday present.
SUPMALE:What's that, sweetheart?
LEADFEMALE:I know Little T's agent.
LEADMALE:He used to go out with my friend Jennifer.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet he could get Ashley a front row seat at Little T's next concert.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, Hilary, if you know his agent you can get something twice as good as that.
LEADFEMALE:Two seats.
LEADMALE:Let me walk you through this one.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow is Ashley's birthday party.
LEADMALE:Ashley has a crush on Little T.
SUPMALE:Birthday party.
LEADMALE:Little T.
LEADMALE:Something beginning to gel here? Wouldn't it be nice if Little T came to Ashley's birthday party? That would be so cute.
OTHERMALE:Will everybody please be quiet? I'm trying to think.
LEADMALE:This party has been going on for an hour.
LEADMALE:When is Little T gonna get here? You know nothing about celebrities.
OTHERMALE:They always come to parties fashionably late.
LEADMALE:For a celebrity, being an hour late is like being half an hour early.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Well, if he's not here Hi, kids.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Tidy the Clown.
SUPFEMALE:We are going to play a new game.
OTHERFEMALE:It's called Clean Up After Your Spoiled Little Selves.
LEADMALE:Mom, Dad, make him stop.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, baby? Come on, a clown at a birthday party? It's so babyish.
LEADMALE:No, it's cool.
SUPMALE:I'm about to get this party started right.
LEADMALE:All right, kids, check it out.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Ashley's cousin, Will and I'm about to hip y'all to this new style of dancing.
LEADMALE:It's called dumb dancing, and no matter what you do you got to have a serious mug on the whole time.
SUPMALE:So y'all peep this here.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Now you give it a try.
LEADMALE:Yeah, like that'll be happening.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, man, who invited the old guy? My brother, you want to take this outside? Will, will you cut it out? You are wrecking the party.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, this stuff is for 
OTHERFEMALE:clowns, dance contests.
LEADMALE:Hi, kids.
SUPMALE:Prepare to be amazed.
LEADMALE:It's time for the great Carltoni.
LEADFEMALE:I wish I was never born.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Now, that's Little T's agent.
LEADFEMALE:I was the only one who thought Home Alone would make money.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that was me.
LEADFEMALE:Got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Lee.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, sorry I'm late, but I was just at Goldie's house and Goldie and Chevy and Mel were there.
LEADFEMALE:It just turned into a thing and, you know As usual, I had to straighten it out.
LEADMALE:But, you know Exactly.
LEADMALE:Well, is Little T here? Hey, would I lie to you? Happy birthday, Ashley.
LEADMALE:Are you feeling better? I can't believe I just did that.
LEADFEMALE:This is so embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE:It's not so bad.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:I've always been planning on things to say if I got a chance to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Then I finally meet you, and I don't even make a sound.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know about that.
LEADFEMALE:You made a pretty good thud when you hit the ground.
LEADMALE:Did I really? God, I can't even faint right.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:You mean this is the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you?
SUPMALE:I guess not.
OTHERFEMALE:What was? I can't tell you.
LEADFEMALE:It's too embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you my most embarrassing moment.
LEADFEMALE:I was dressing for gym class during a fire drill and I had to run out of the building in my drawers.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'll tell you mine.
SUPMALE:It was the Honor Day assembly.
SUPMALE:I was sitting with my legs crossed for the whole time.
SUPFEMALE:And when they called my name for the English award I stood up and started across the stage, only my leg was asleep.
SUPMALE:And then, thwap! I fell flat on my face.
LEADFEMALE:Come to think of it most of my embarrassing moments involve me hitting the floor.
LEADFEMALE:You're really funny.
OTHERFEMALE:You're really cool, too.
LEADFEMALE:Who, me?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Look, I've got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry we didn't have more time to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what with you being unconscious and all.
SUPMALE:Okay, thanks for coming.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Look, you want to go out sometime?
LEADFEMALE:Who, me? I thought we'd go out for pizza tomorrow night.
SUPMALE:I mean, if you're free.
LEADMALE:I'd have to check my calendar, but I think I'm free.
SUPMALE:Okay, then can I come around 7:00?
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, then.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'll go now.
SUPMALE:I'll walk you to the door.
OTHERMALE:I'm hungry.
LEADMALE:Would you like a sandwich? No, thanks, Mom.
OTHERMALE:I'm just too excited.
LEADFEMALE:I can never eat before a big date.
LEADMALE:Do I look okay? Hilary, it's not even your date.
OTHERMALE:It's Ashley's date.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but still, do I look okay? Hilary, baby, calm down.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Mom, but this is the most exciting day in a girl's life.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's Ashley's first date.
LEADMALE:And it's with a celebrity.
SUPFEMALE:It is so gratifying to see her developing the right values.
LEADMALE:Guys, don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:What? You know, sigh like that.
OTHERFEMALE:You make me feel like Benji.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:We're just excited, that's all.
LEADMALE:We'll calm down.
OTHERMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Could you check my hair?
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna go in the living room and wait for Little T.
OTHERMALE:Just a second.
OTHERMALE:Baby, I just want to get one picture.
SUPMALE:Mom, not the camcorder.
SUPFEMALE:But, sweetheart, this is your first date.
LEADMALE:This only happens once in your life.
SUPMALE:Thank God.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now turn around so we can see your pretty dress.
LEADFEMALE:Go back out and come in again the way you did.
LEADMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:Hilary, you sit there drinking your coffee the way you were.
LEADFEMALE:That was great.
SUPMALE:No, Mom.
OTHERMALE:Let's do it again.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't happy with what I did.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, go back out again.
LEADFEMALE:Guys, will you cut it out? You're driving me crazy.
LEADFEMALE:He's a very special boy and I don't want to be so nervous that I mess things up.
LEADMALE:In case you don't remember, this is my first date.
SUPMALE:I'm telling you, Uncle Phil, he kissed her right on her mouth.
LEADMALE:It was really more on the cheek.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but he was aiming for her mouth and he missed.
LEADFEMALE:The kid is not only aggressive, but inaccurate and that's a dangerous combination.
SUPFEMALE:You're getting all worked up over nothing.
LEADFEMALE:He's just a 13-year-old boy.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, you don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:This is serious.
SUPFEMALE:I know what goes on in the mind of a 13-year-old boy.
LEADFEMALE:Considering you still have the mind of a 13-year-old boy.
OTHERMALE:Will's got a good point.
OTHERFEMALE:When I was 13, I harbored some pretty impure thoughts about Tootie.
SUPMALE:Look, I wasn't thrilled about her going out in the first place.
OTHERFEMALE:She's only 12.
SUPFEMALE:But she had her heart set on it.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, the kid's agent is chaperoning.
LEADMALE:So what could possibly happen? That's them.
LEADFEMALE:This discussion is at an end.
SUPFEMALE:Master T and Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Lee Cohen.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you're English.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I represent some English bands.
LEADFEMALE:Ever heard of Duran Duran?
LEADMALE:Why, yes.
LEADFEMALE:When they came to me, they were just Duran.
SUPMALE:I added the second Duran, and bang-o! You must be so proud.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mr.
SUPMALE:Banks.
SUPMALE:I brought some flowers for Ashley.
LEADMALE:Now, that's sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that sweet, Will, Carlton? Yeah, real sweet.
LEADMALE:This evening should be fun.
LEADMALE:I hope it will be, son.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley's in the kitchen.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you join her? Isn't that sweet? He seems really excited about his first date.
SUPMALE:First date? Dream on.
LEADFEMALE:First date today, maybe.
SUPFEMALE:Pardon me? When he's on tour, he's gotta beat the chicks away with a stick.
LEADMALE:Wish I had a piece of that action.
LEADMALE:Action.
SUPMALE:Isn't that sweet? You kids have a great time at the pizza place.
LEADMALE:We will.
LEADMALE:Did you hear that? "We will.
LEADFEMALE:" All right, kids.
SUPMALE:Let's party.
LEADMALE:Okay, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Have a good time.
SUPMALE:Have fun, you guys.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPMALE:Follow them.
LEADFEMALE:Out.
LEADFEMALE:When I first read the script of Pretty Woman it was called Attractive Woman.
LEADMALE:I said, "Come on, guys, let's go all the way with this.
LEADFEMALE:" So they changed the title, and bang-o!
LEADFEMALE:So, what's your favorite video game?
LEADFEMALE:Tetris.
SUPFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I brought my Game Boy.
SUPFEMALE:So you want to play?
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:He's got his arm around her already.
LEADFEMALE:That's the same arm I used when I was 13.
LEADMALE:It's that love arm.
LEADMALE:We better work fast.
LEADMALE:Let's roll.
SUPMALE:Hey, Ashley, Little T, what's going on? What are you two doing here? Uncle Phil got hungry, so he sent us to pick up a dozen pizzas.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, can I speak to you for a minute?
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:What do you want?
LEADMALE:Don't get upset, but it's your hair.
SUPFEMALE:It's doing a weird kind of bird's nest thing.
LEADFEMALE:You might wanna get a hairbrush and fix it.
OTHERMALE:I'll be right back.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna be straight with you.
OTHERMALE:You're going out with my little cousin.
SUPMALE:You better not try nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't give me that innocent role.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you people in the music business are like.
LEADFEMALE:Makes me sick.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.
LEADMALE:Perhaps this will refresh your memory.
SUPMALE:From the current issue of Right On! magazine.
LEADFEMALE:There's a picture of you at the recent Soul Train Awards.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you'd be kind enough to tell us who this bimbo is on your arm.
SUPMALE:That's my mom.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You covered yourself on that one but what about this girlie action you been getting on tour? Your agent told me all about it.
OTHERMALE:Did you believe my agent? Man, he lies about everything.
SUPMALE:He told me I could have a career in singing.
SUPMALE:Look, guys, with all the recording, touring, and my homework I haven't had any time for girls.
LEADFEMALE:To tell you the truth, this is my first real date.
OTHERFEMALE:I knew that.
OTHERFEMALE:I just brought Carlton down 'cause I had to prove it to him.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Carlton, I looked at my hair and it was fine.
LEADFEMALE:If you two don't mind, I'd like to continue with my date alone.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we're going.
SUPMALE:Check you later, Ash.
SUPFEMALE:What was that all about?
LEADMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPFEMALE:So, you want to play some more Tetris?
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really having a good time, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
LEADMALE:I don't believe you, Philip.
LEADMALE:Sending Will and Carlton to spy on your own daughter? What's wrong with that? She is my daughter.
SUPFEMALE:I'd do it again, damn it.
LEADMALE:Word to big bird.
SUPMALE:Just say the word and we there, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:But this was such a big night for Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Mom and I were so happy for her.
SUPMALE:What got into you guys? I know it was a big night for her.
LEADMALE:I knew it had to come sometime.
LEADMALE:I just didn't think it would come so soon.
LEADFEMALE:She's really growing up.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it's time for us to stop butting into her life so much.
SUPMALE:No, it's not! Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:How did it go?
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not going to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he did kiss me.
SUPFEMALE:I want to hear all the details.
LEADFEMALE:We'll pop some popcorn, do our nails and you can tell me every single thing that happened tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like a written copy of that report.
LEADMALE:Ashley, sweetie when you walked in from that date with that smile on your face
LEADMALE:That's a moment I will always remember.
SUPFEMALE:That's nice, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Could you go out and do it again, and I'll go get the camcorder?
LEADMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, just asking.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:My little princess.
SUPMALE:I cannot believe my little girl went out on a real date tonight.
LEADFEMALE:He's a really nice guy, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, but there's something you should know, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:What? I'm never gonna like anybody you bring home.
LEADFEMALE:That's awfully fair of you.
SUPFEMALE:It's not that they're not good.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that nobody is good enough for you.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Daddy.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm just sorry I wrecked your date.
SUPMALE:You didn't, Will.
SUPFEMALE:It was the most wonderful night of my life.
LEADFEMALE:Really? That's great.
LEADMALE:I think your second date will be even better 'cause when you're 21, you can appreciate these things more.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, I'm going out with him again next Saturday.
SUPFEMALE:Next Saturday I'm busy.
LEADMALE:You'll have to change that.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're busy.
LEADMALE:That's why I made it for then.
OTHERMALE:Good night, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:You should try rapping.
OTHERMALE:When you're rapping, you mess up the words and make up some new ones right there on the spot.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's try this.
SUPMALE:I'll sing one line, you make up a line to rhyme it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's see.
SUPMALE:"You didn't get into Miss Berkley's chorus"
LEADFEMALE:I'm thinking, all right?
OTHERMALE:That's all right.
LEADMALE:We got all day.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I've got it.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:"You didn't get into Miss Berkley's chorus" "I'd like to hit her in the head with Roget's Thesaurus" "Don't need no choir when you're a rapper" "Gonna hunt Miss Berkley down and zap her" "Got this whole town of Bel-Air buzzing" "Get a load of me and my rapping cousin" 
LEADMALE:
