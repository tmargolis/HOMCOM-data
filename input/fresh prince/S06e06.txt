LEADFEMALE:What you doing, Carlton? Oh, packing away my CDs.

OTHERMALE: Just couldn't hang on there could you, little fella? CARLTON: Darn.
SUPMALE: Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Here's something for your trouble, little brother.

SUPMALE:You got to break me off some.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:That movie was pathetic.
SUPMALE:Pathetic.
LEADFEMALE:Naked women bumping and grinding on strangers' laps? And the way them guys just sat there and took it.
LEADMALE:How can anyone find that attractive? I mean, is our culture that diseased? You know, just thinking about it is making me feel dirty.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I'm gonna have to take a shower.
OTHERFEMALE:You wanna join me? What am I saying? It's even infected me.
SUPFEMALE:Hola.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What'd you guys end up seeing?
LEADFEMALE:Showgirls.
LEADMALE:Again? What does that make it, eight times, Will?  Eight times? You told me you hated it.

LEADMALE:I know the feeling, Will.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE: Wait, but, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, hol Oh, girl.
OTHERMALE:Boy, did you handle that badly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, Geoffrey, you're here.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:When did I ever ask you for anything? You never stopped asking from the moment I started here.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
OTHERFEMALE:In fact, as I remember I spent my first seven hours of service here installing wall-to-wall carpet for Barbie's Dream House.
LEADMALE:Carpet which had to be promptly removed.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not my fault that when Ken got home, he didn't like it.
SUPFEMALE:And it wasn't my fault the dollhouse burnt to the ground.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, Skipper died in that fire.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't even wanna think about it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I need you to hem this dress.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Hi, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Hi, baby.
SUPMALE:Have you seen the notes I've been working on for my speech tomorrow? They're right here, big guy.
LEADFEMALE:I've crossed out what didn't work and rewritten the rest.
LEADMALE:How thoughtful.
SUPMALE:Daddy, can I use your car tonight?
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:How about Mom's?
SUPMALE:Talk to her.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Dad said it's okay for me to use your car tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say that.
OTHERFEMALE:Those weren't your exact words, Uncle Phil, but you kind of did imply that You know, there was absolutely no reason for me to jump in here, was there? None whatsoever.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna go ahead and jump out of here.
LEADMALE:Yes, jump on with your bad self.
LEADFEMALE:It's fine if you take the car, honey.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
OTHERMALE:Ashley's going out tonight.
LEADMALE:I've given Geoffrey the night off and Nicky's going to his first sleepover.
SUPMALE:PHIL: Mm-hm.
OTHERMALE:Philip, the house will be nice and quiet.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:You know what that means?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I can finally finish my speech.
SUPMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:Nobody said anything.
LEADMALE:Nicky's first sleepover.
SUPMALE:Ahh.

LEADFEMALE:On Saturday night? For some, it's bath night.
LEADMALE:For me, it's math night.
SUPMALE:But, hey, maybe you could help me?
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd probably just get in your way.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you're probably right.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Hmm.
OTHERMALE:She seems a bit of a gloomy Gus.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe Michelle hasn't called.
LEADMALE:I've left messages.
LEADFEMALE:I've paged her.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God, I hope she's not disgruntled.
LEADFEMALE:You better be worrying about me being disgruntled after the way you messed my date up today.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I've come to the realization I don't understand women.
SUPMALE:Or men, for that matter.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should just talk to my Dad.
LEADFEMALE:He understands women.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry about before.
LEADMALE:We're gonna have a great time tonight, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:A great time.
SUPMALE:You know what I'm saying? I love you.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:Do you? Sweetheart, I just said I did.
LEADMALE:And you look beautiful.
LEADMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:I'm serious.
SUPFEMALE:For someone who's had four children, you look amazing.
LEADMALE:Sandra, I'm telling you.
LEADFEMALE:I really hated that movie.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess in some sick kind of way I was just trying to punish myself.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:No, I can be serious.
OTHERFEMALE:Ju Let me prove it to you.
OTHERMALE:Sandra, I seriously wanna go out with you tonight.
LEADMALE:Your cousin? No, no.
SUPMALE:I mean, I can find somebody to go out with your cousin, yeah.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:That's no problem at all.
LEADMALE:Hey, and I got the perfect guy for the job.
LEADMALE:All right, baby, you're the breast Best! Best! I said best! CARLTON: No.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hey, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, man.
LEADMALE:You owe me.
LEADMALE:You almost wrecked everything with Sandra.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna do it.
SUPFEMALE: Oh, you're not gonna do it.
LEADMALE: You know what? That's fine.
LEADMALE:It's probably time for me to move on anyway, you know.
OTHERMALE:As luck would have it, it's come to my attention that there's this cute little mail carrier that's available.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're right.
SUPFEMALE:But that would be exactly what you deserved.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I'm sorry and I know I owe you one.
LEADFEMALE:But I just wouldn't feel right going out and having a good time without Michelle.
SUPFEMALE:What if I could promise you a terrible time? If I could only be sure.
LEADMALE:I guarantee you the worst time that you have ever had in your life.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE: We finally have the house all to ourselves.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Don't stop.
LEADFEMALE:Go on with whatever you're doing.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Ew.
LEADMALE:What were you doing? I don't even wanna think about it.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Geoffrey?
LEADFEMALE:He's got the night off.
SUPMALE:What about my dress? I'm pretty sure he was wearing pants.
LEADFEMALE:Eww.
SUPMALE:Oh, let me tell you now, that there was some good grub.
LEADFEMALE:That girl can cook.
OTHERFEMALE:What about you, Carlton? Did you enjoy your dinner? It was fine.
SUPMALE:You don't talk much, do you? Uhh, as a child, he was dropped on his tongue.
LEADFEMALE:I think he's the strong silent type.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:You are strong.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm no stranger to the gym.
LEADMALE:Carlton, how about some dessert? I've got ice cream.
LEADFEMALE:Sweet chocolate ice cream.
LEADMALE:I'm a tutti-frutti man myself.
SUPFEMALE:What the heck is wrong with you, Carlton? That girl just offered you two scoops.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid I'm a one-gal guy.
SUPMALE: What's so funny? We were just thinking of a little game we could play.
LEADMALE:Tiffany.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, Sandra.
LEADMALE:It'll be fun.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:What'll be fun?
SUPFEMALE:A word game.

SUPMALE:How is it possible that we're losing? I can't pull a vowel to save my life.
