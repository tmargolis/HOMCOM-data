LEADMALE:Um, we was talking about this movie we had seen.
LEADMALE:Um, the movie we just came from it was about a linebacker and a fraternity.
LEADFEMALE:You know, and Larry Fishburne played the dean.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Is that the family room? All right, young lady, out with it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I didn't go ice skating.
OTHERMALE:I went to a party.
LEADFEMALE:And, yes, I was with a guy, but we were just kissing.
LEADMALE:You have no business with a college fullback.
SUPMALE:He was a linebacker, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, it wasn't just anybody.
SUPFEMALE:He used to go to Bel-Air Academy and I had a big crush Save it.
LEADMALE:There are not enough words in the English language to explain your behavior.
OTHERMALE:My God, do you have any idea the kind of danger you put yourself in tonight?
OTHERMALE:All my friends
SUPMALE:If all your friends jumped off the damn MTV building, would you do it? Do you have any idea where your daughter was tonight, Vivian? Hmm? At a fraternity house playing touch football in the bedroom.
LEADMALE:Ashley.
OTHERMALE:Mom, do you remember Andre Lawrence? The fullback? He was Ashley, go to your room.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, please let me
LEADMALE:You heard what your father said.
SUPFEMALE:But, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Go! You all right? I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to recall what it felt like to be 15.
LEADFEMALE:So long ago, how could you remember? I'm just so upset that I'm saying things I don't even mean.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go have a talk with Ashley.
SUPMALE:You know, sir, if you really wanted to teach Miss Ashley a lesson you could always have her taken out of the portrait.
SUPFEMALE:Miss Ashley and I are about the same height it would be a simple matter of painting my head on her body.
SUPMALE:Phillip, Ashley's gone.
LEADMALE:What? Take the back streets.
SUPFEMALE:I don't wanna be seen.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up and look for Ashley.
LEADMALE:Hello.

LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Lisa, what's up? It's me.
LEADFEMALE:Will, it is 1 in the morning.

SUPFEMALE:I just called you two minutes ago.
SUPMALE:Where were you?
LEADMALE:I was asleep.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:Sure you ain't just getting in? Just as sure as I'm about to hang up on you.
LEADMALE:How you gonna call me at 1, then ask me where I been? All right, all right, all right.
SUPFEMALE:My fault, my fault.
LEADMALE:Look, Ashley ran away and I just thought she might be there with you.
LEADFEMALE:No, you didn't.
SUPMALE:Keep me posted.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:When we find Ashley, she's reimbursing me for gas.
OTHERMALE:Where is she? Well, if it was me and I ran away from home I'd probably check into the Four Seasons and get a massage.
SUPMALE:Well, y'all should have seen Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:Dude just went straight loco.
LEADFEMALE:That big vein in his neck looked like an anaconda.
LEADFEMALE:Look, there's a method to my father's madness.
SUPFEMALE:If he came down hard on Ashley, it was for her own good.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, you think everything your father does is right.
LEADMALE:Of course, don't you? Hell, no.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, Will's right.
LEADMALE:Daddy is way too strict.
SUPMALE:Well, he may be strict, but he's always fair.
LEADMALE:Yeah, when you're a son.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sons are different than daughters.
SUPMALE:In your case, just barely.
LEADFEMALE:If you're referring to the size of my endowment, it's almost as large as Hilary's.
OTHERFEMALE:God, I hope you talking about money.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell him.
LEADMALE:Sir, the precinct says they'll keep looking.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe she's out there somewhere, Vivian.
LEADMALE:Our little girl.
SUPMALE:Sorry, guys, we couldn't find her.
LEADFEMALE:Will, this is all your fault.
SUPMALE:My fault? Where else did Ashley learn such behavior? Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You're the one that chased Ashley out of here.
LEADFEMALE:How dare you talk to me like that? He dares because he doesn't respect you.
LEADMALE:Neither of them do.
LEADMALE:What a crock.
LEADMALE:How you go and just tell a bold-faced lie like? HILARY 
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, Will is right.
LEADMALE:Daddy is way too strict.
SUPMALE:
OTHERMALE:Right, you think everything your father does is right.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Of course, don't you? 
LEADFEMALE:Hell, no.
LEADMALE:And listen to this from last week.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, man, what is wrong with you? Hey, what up, Ash? Hi, Will.
LEADMALE: You mean we've been out running all over this city looking for you and you've been up in here? Well, I did run away.
OTHERFEMALE:But there are some weirdoes out there.
SUPFEMALE:You know something, this is all your fault.
OTHERMALE:What is that, like, the theme of this family? "When in doubt, blame Will.
SUPMALE:" If it wasn't for you, Daddy would never have found out about that party.
LEADMALE:Ashley, that still doesn't mean that you should have been there.
SUPMALE:Ashley, listen, college boys are like predators.
LEADFEMALE:You know, they prey on innocent little high school girls like you.
SUPFEMALE:They're like piranha, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:And you're 110 pounds of teenage chum.
LEADMALE:A hundred and eight and I'm not as innocent as I look.
OTHERMALE:All right, I am.
OTHERFEMALE:Well you ready to walk that last mile? Will, I didn't do anything.
LEADMALE:The Lord is my shepherd Hey, everybody, look what I found.
LEADFEMALE:Are you okay? Yeah, I'm all right.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we've got a bit of a volatile situation here.
OTHERMALE:A powder keg if you will.
SUPMALE:A mishandling of this situation could have repercussions that will reverberate forever.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian call your sister and tell her she's about to lose her only child.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna call her and tell her myself.
OTHERMALE:Look now, I could ground you forever.
SUPMALE:I could put bars on your windows, I could put locks on your doors.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy
LEADMALE:Don't "daddy" me.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any idea what you put this family through? Running around doing God knows what with God knows who.
LEADFEMALE:If I'd have asked, you wouldn't have let me go.
SUPMALE:You're darn right.
LEADFEMALE:You're 15 years old.
LEADMALE:You have no business at a party with college boys!
LEADMALE:All my friends were there.
LEADFEMALE:Your friends don't live here! I can't do this.
LEADFEMALE:You talk to your daughter.
LEADFEMALE:I'm done.
LEADMALE:You guys hate me.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, if that were true, we wouldn't care when you did something foolish like this.
LEADFEMALE:What you have to understand is that we know what's best for you.
LEADFEMALE:It may not seem like that now, but one day you'll understand that.
LEADFEMALE:End of discussion.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, don't you understand? Yes, I understand.
LEADFEMALE:I understand you lied and you ran away.
LEADFEMALE:And another thing as long as you live in this house, you will follow our rules.
LEADFEMALE:That's it! Mom.
SUPMALE: Ashley, I understand what you're feeling.
LEADMALE:But you have to consider the seriousness of what you did.
LEADFEMALE:You really hurt us this evening.
SUPFEMALE:All I want is for you to trust me.
LEADMALE:Trust is a very fragile thing and you're gonna have to start earning it all back.
LEADFEMALE:I messed up really bad.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk about it tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Mama, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I saw Ashley's tutor leaving.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, they're actually gonna let Ashley eat tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's what happens when you lie.
OTHERFEMALE:You gotta be punished.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you think your punishment should be? Oh, I don't know.
LEADMALE:I think it should hurt.
LEADFEMALE:I think it should really teach me a lesson.
SUPMALE:And I should be wearing some kind of hat.
SUPFEMALE:You are sick.
LEADMALE:Okay, no hat.
SUPMALE:I think people lie because the truth hurts.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Like, take this jacket you're wearing.
SUPMALE:What about this jacket? I love it.
