LEADMALE:Look, Will, we're almost there.
OTHERMALE:Carlton, relax.
SUPFEMALE:This is the line for class registration not the Nixon Library.
LEADMALE:Will, I took the liberty of jotting out a few courses you might be interested in.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Carlton, but I already have my academic priorities in order.
SUPMALE:Will, I'm proud of you.
SUPMALE:You're finally taking your education seriously.
OTHERMALE:Can I help you? Yes, I'll have what she's having.
SUPFEMALE:Will, do you realize we stopped and talked to every woman we saw? So? We were on the freeway.
LEADMALE:Why do you do these crazy things? The same reason Eddie Murphy tries to sing, I like the challenge.
LEADFEMALE:Right, well, if you like to be challenged so much how come you registered for classes like Cheese Appreciation? Carlton, the challenge is to make your life as easy as possible.
LEADFEMALE:That's why God made canned meat.
SUPFEMALE:Spam cakes, anyone?
LEADMALE:Hey, man.

LEADFEMALE:Western Philosophy.
LEADMALE:Western Philosophy? I'm impressed.

SUPFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:I'm late for school, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley! Could we see a little compassion here? Hilary just lost her fianc√©.
OTHERMALE:She could use a little sisterly comfort.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary, this is your sister, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Suck it up, and get on with your life! Hilary.
OTHERMALE:Sweetheart.

LEADMALE:And you don't have to.

LEADMALE:Yeah, and on page 14, there's this fabulous leather bag and Oh, that would be cute.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, attention Kmart shoppers.
SUPMALE:We're running out of books for Psych 157 the study of human sexuality.
SUPFEMALE:So for any of you slimmies who miss out I'll be more than happy to demonstrate the contents of the book.
SUPFEMALE:Twice, you know.
LEADMALE:Can I borrow that for a second?
SUPMALE:Oh, sure thing, boss lady.
OTHERFEMALE:You're an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:There you go making snap judgments again.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I need to get
LEADMALE:Hey, Sting, kick some lyrics, man.
LEADMALE:Do you always have to embarrass me in public? No, you do that all by yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:What'd you sign up for today, Advanced Sarcasm? Whatever I'm taking has gotta be tougher than your schedule.
OTHERMALE:What is Cheese Appreciation, anyway? Have you ever heard of a little thing called Western Philosophy? You're taking Western Philosophy? I can see you're being seduced by my intellectual prowess.
SUPFEMALE:Is that Spam in your teeth? I didn't have no Spam.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, my bird.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, you think I could possibly get some help? Well, Hair Club For Men would be a good start.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing like that minimum-wage humor.
LEADMALE:Look, my friend, if it's not too taxing I'd like you to do a little work, find these books for me.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, just relax a second.
SUPMALE:Here, fill out this requisition form, and I'll get them for you as soon as I can.
SUPMALE:Okay, try to have it before graduation, okay? Sure thing, Skippy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'd stay and continue this battle of wits with you but you're obviously unarmed.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'll be sure and take care of this requisition form for you.
LEADFEMALE:He dribbles behind his back he's up and he shoots.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and it's no good.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton the peacock says, "Don't be a quitter, pick up your litter.
LEADMALE:" Help me! Come on, guys, help me up.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we need a cleanup on aisle four.
LEADMALE:We got some bird droppings.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me but I think I've seen your picture somewhere before.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, that's right, it was in the dictionary next 
LEADMALE:You have nothing better to do than hit on me? Well, now, I don't know, let me check my schedule.
SUPMALE:Nope, all clear.
OTHERFEMALE:And Plus, I don't have any early classes, that means we could sleep in.
SUPFEMALE:You're relentless.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I don't give up, neither.
LEADFEMALE:Just think of me as the Love Terminator.
SUPMALE:T2, meet my boyfriend, T-Rex.
OTHERMALE:Hasta la vista, baby.
LEADMALE:Hey, Skippy, the Garth Brooks concert must be over, huh?
SUPFEMALE:You think I could get by?
OTHERFEMALE:Well, not with those looks.
SUPMALE:I see you're hung up on superficial facades.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't speak geek.
LEADFEMALE:No, now, come on, come on, man.
SUPMALE:I'm just kidding.
SUPMALE:Take a seat right here, next to me and observe a class clown in his natural habitat.
SUPMALE:I get it.
LEADMALE:You're planning on giving the teacher a real hard time, is that it? Well, you know, that's plan B.
LEADMALE:Plan A was derailed by this refrigerator-shaped gentleman over here.
LEADMALE:I gotta tell you, I see a real problem with Plan B.
SUPMALE:What's that? Watch.
SUPFEMALE:I am Professor Jeremy Mansfield and this is Western Philosophy.
LEADMALE:I'm Will Smith.
LEADMALE:And this is an interesting coincidence.
SUPFEMALE:Philosophy is all about the perception of reality.
SUPFEMALE:And today's reality is this is a very difficult course.
LEADFEMALE:I am a very difficult man and I'm going to make your lives very difficult.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, Professor Mansfield, it's not too late to start sucking up, is it? There'll be a paper every week and a pop quiz whenever I feel like having some fun and I'm a fun-loving guy.
LEADFEMALE:You will have five 20-page papers, two midterms and a little cumulative final that I like to call the widow-maker.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Padre.
LEADMALE:Not so quick with the hair jokes now, my friend? Well, work may be hard but I think in the long run you'll find this course electrifying.
LEADMALE:No, no, no! No, wait.
LEADMALE:Call my mother! Somebody call the governor! I ain't even supposed to be in this class, man! I wanna live.
LEADFEMALE:So, what I'm trying to do here, Mr.
LEADMALE:Hosek, is just drop this one class.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, according to your schedule, I would say it's Western Philosophy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, how'd you know that? It's the only course you're taking that actually requires staying awake.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute, I have a really good reason for wanting to drop that class.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I'm sure my wife has a really good reason for cheating on me.
OTHERMALE:Look, man, I got problems of my own.
LEADMALE:You think you got problems? My wife has seen more action than Chuck Norris.
LEADMALE:I got an office that used to be the janitor's washroom.
LEADFEMALE:Look, here! I got a toilet in my closet! And every day I just see my career going down it! Now, since registration is over, officially over, the only way to get out of a class is to get the instructor's written permission.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:But I have to get Professor Mansfield's signature? He's not gonna sign this.
LEADFEMALE:There has to be another way.
LEADMALE:Well, actually, there There is.
SUPFEMALE:Well, come on, man, tell me, tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Make it one of your demands when you climb the bell tower with a rifle.
SUPFEMALE:Nurse, I'm ready to leave now.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Dad, how was court today?
LEADFEMALE:It was great.
LEADMALE:I got to send El Diablo up the river.
LEADMALE:El Diablo, the graffiti guy? He was the worst tagger the city's ever known.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be a while before they see his name around here again.
LEADMALE:Vivian.
SUPMALE:It's celery, I swear.
SUPMALE:Philip, what has gotten into you? The incarceration of a felon always gets my juices pumping.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go upstairs and celebrate.
LEADMALE:Honey, we have a problem.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, your credit cards, I mean
LEADMALE:After, after.
OTHERFEMALE:See? So what? We're wealthy.
LEADMALE:You should have seen me deny that man's plea bargain.
LEADMALE:I was brilliant! You're going upstairs aren't you? Yes, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Is there a problem? I have no one in my life to go upstairs with anymore.
LEADMALE:Lower.
OTHERMALE:Honey, how about a rain check? Rain check? Vivian, I am not a car wash.
SUPFEMALE:I have needs.
LEADFEMALE:So does Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I'm sorry, I will stay down here with you.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian! I'm ready for my wax job.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith.
SUPFEMALE:Such a quiet entrance.
SUPMALE:Where's your Your vim your verve your pedestrian wit? Why don't we stop wasting each other's time.
LEADFEMALE:Just give me an F and I'll be on my way.
SUPMALE:Will that make you happy? What would make me happy is never having been here in the first place.
LEADMALE:Just get me a drop slip.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make your wish a reality.
SUPMALE:You mean all I have to do to get out of this class is ask? I don't want anybody in here who doesn't wanna be here.
SUPFEMALE:Man, you gonna start a stampede.
SUPMALE:You know, I take back everything I said about you.
LEADMALE:And give me a couple of hours before you start your car.
LEADMALE:Psych.
SUPMALE:Or should I say "philosp.
SUPFEMALE:" One of the central questions of philosophy is the revelation of truth.
LEADMALE:Enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:Do you wanna know the truth? Do you wanna know the truth? You can't handle the truth! Hey, that's Jack Nicholson.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Smith, if you wouldn't mind, please would you just beam yourself out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:Captain Kirk, now that's fly.
OTHERMALE:No, this is The 
LEADFEMALE:"Help me! Help me!" Reality is, reality changes constantly.
SUPMALE:Yesterday's reality may not necessarily be today's.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody got a pencil? Okay, good.
SUPMALE:Hold it up.
LEADMALE:Little higher.
LEADFEMALE:Little lower.
LEADMALE:Perfect, right there.
LEADFEMALE:Now break it in half.
OTHERFEMALE:What a sound.
SUPMALE:From now on, we're going to be using our minds.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, give me a pencil.
SUPMALE:Give me a pencil.
OTHERMALE:This course isn't about taking notes.
LEADMALE:This course is about creative thinking.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look, conservatives, right? Liberals, rappers, skinheads nudists and televangelists, they all have something in common.
LEADMALE:You know what it is?
OTHERMALE:They all been on Montel Williams.
OTHERFEMALE:See, I can't hear you because you no longer exist.
SUPMALE:But you could shove me, though, right? What they have in common is they all have a distinct version of the truth.
SUPMALE:But do we really care what the truth is? No, not really.
OTHERFEMALE:We want to know, "How come nobody loves me?" "Where's my next paycheck coming from?" "How come I never get any breaks in life?" Okay, let's get on our feet.
LEADMALE:We need a couple of volunteers to start with.
LEADMALE:Let's get some people who have a personal philosophy that is rooted in, oh, I don't know, sex.
LEADMALE:Okay, that's what I thought.
SUPMALE:Nothing kinky, we just need two.
LEADMALE:Denise, right? Denise and Evan.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:All right, right up there.
LEADFEMALE:Now, don't be nervous.
LEADMALE:You're gonna engage in a little dialectic.
LEADFEMALE:Dialectic is a ten-dollar word, and it means "debate.
LEADFEMALE:" Man! I should have never dropped out of his class.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:What you doing down here?
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna tape Carlton's first pep rally.
LEADMALE:You have no idea how proud I am that he's the peacock.
SUPMALE:Nope, not even a clue.
LEADFEMALE:You got a little time, though.
OTHERFEMALE:You want some grub?
LEADMALE:I've already eaten.
LEADFEMALE:Is that a yes or a no? Man, this brings back memories.
SUPMALE:I bet you was in the top of your class at Princeton, huh? Actually, far from it.
LEADFEMALE:I was spinning my wheels until I met Matthew Langford.
LEADFEMALE:Who's that, one of your professors?
SUPFEMALE:Not "one.
LEADFEMALE:" The professor.
SUPFEMALE:Man changed my life.
LEADMALE:Turned a skinny kid from South Carolina into the man you see today.
LEADMALE:And you know how? He challenged me.
LEADFEMALE:To what? A pie-eating contest? No, to having a fool as a nephew.
LEADFEMALE:I have this theory.
SUPMALE:I believe that everyone in college has one special teacher that That gives him an insight, a glimpse into who they really are.
OTHERMALE:You be on the lookout, Will.
LEADMALE:I think I found that dude already, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Already? I was in my third year before I found Professor Langford.
SUPMALE:Let me tell you, this dude is hilarious.
LEADMALE:I mean, he's fun, he's funny.
SUPMALE:He makes me think about stuff in a way that I never even looked at it before.
SUPFEMALE:And I dropped his class.
SUPMALE:Let me guess.
LEADMALE:Western Philosophy, right? How does everybody know that? Because every time you're faced with a challenge, you run for cover.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, now, that is not true, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I mean, this whole college thing is just kind of new to me.
SUPMALE:Bull! It's old territory.
SUPMALE:I mean, you're always going on about how you want to be out on your own and get respect.
LEADMALE:But you don't do anything to earn it.
OTHERMALE:I think it's my break time.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell is wrong with you, anyway? I mean, you're smart, you're charming.
OTHERFEMALE:You have gifts that other people would kill to have.
LEADMALE:And what do you do? You throw it away by taking the easy road.
OTHERFEMALE:Uncle Phil, this is one class.
OTHERMALE:No, this is not one class, Will.
LEADFEMALE:This is your life.
SUPMALE:It's not my life, it's not Carlton's life and you only get out of it what you put into it.
SUPFEMALE:And you are off to one lousy start.
LEADFEMALE:But enough about me, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Let's talk about you.
SUPMALE:That's exactly what I'm talking about.
LEADMALE:Today's topic of conversation is this glass.
LEADMALE:Is it A, half-empty, or B, half-full? Professor, it's an emergency, you got to come out here.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, Will? Can't move those oranges at the off-ramp?
LEADMALE:I'm serious.
SUPFEMALE:You got to come out here.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, just wax philosophically for a few moments by yourselves.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, Will, what is it? What did you want me to see?
OTHERFEMALE:Here it is, the new me.
LEADMALE:What happened to yesterday's you? Well, yesterday's reality isn't necessarily today's.
SUPMALE:You're mastering the lingo.
SUPFEMALE:I'm impressed.
LEADFEMALE:That's good, because I wanna get back in your class.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Will some other student already took your spot.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Hey, come on, Professor Mansfield, please.
SUPMALE:You gotta do me this favor, please.
LEADMALE:You come to me, my son, asking for a favor.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna let you back in this class.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Godfather.
LEADFEMALE:Unfortunately, the class registrar is closed, so you won't receive any credit.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, wait, whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold on.
OTHERFEMALE:Freshmen have to carry 12 credits.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'd have to pick up another class, plus do all the work in this one.
LEADFEMALE:You gotta love the irony, though, huh?
LEADMALE:You got a deal.
SUPMALE:Good, take a seat.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:This looks like a lovely seat right Right over there.
LEADMALE:Okay, here's another oldie but a goodie.
SUPFEMALE:If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's around to hear it does it make a sound? Yes, yeah, yes, it does.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, it don't.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, well, you know, yeah, it's a tree, it has to, yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it Well How big is the tree? I mean, is it anywhere near a subway or anything like that? And how close is this forest to the ghetto? Okay, all right, how about if it landed on, like, a gopher or something like that? Hey, does the noise that the gopher makes count? Or what if it falls on Uncle Phil and he hurt the tree? Will, I took the liberty of jotting out a few courses you might be interested in.
LEADMALE:Carlton, thank you very much, but I already have my academic stuff in order.
SUPFEMALE:Good job, Will.
LEADMALE:
