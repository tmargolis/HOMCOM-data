SUPMALE:This is one of the last times that we'll all be sitting together around this table for a while.
LEADMALE:We should cherish these few moments we have as a family.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Not to worry, Big Guy.
LEADMALE:Will's gonna be sitting around this table for years to come.
LEADMALE:For your information, midget boy, I already got an apartment.
LEADMALE:I have, uh, a little announcement to make myself.
OTHERMALE:I have decided to move back to London to be near my son Frederick.
LEADMALE:What would you say if I said I think I may have made a mistake? The word "duh" comes to mind.
LEADFEMALE:In light of all the changes afoot your mother and I have decided to change too.
LEADMALE:We're gonna sell the house.
SUPFEMALE:  Come on, Will.
LEADMALE:Early bird catches the worm.
SUPMALE:Sound like that's what got caught in your throat.
LEADFEMALE:So, Will, you haven't told me about your new place.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, you know, I'm moving in soon.
OTHERMALE:You know, right now they putting a Jacuzzi in and they getting the mirrors on the roof.
LEADMALE:So what, it's kind of a fixer-upper? Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:No, not at all, man.
LEADMALE:Yo, this place is huge.
OTHERMALE:I mean, we got floor-to-ceiling walls and wall-to-wall floors.
LEADFEMALE:Man, yo, it's the bomb.
SUPMALE:Look, since Mom and Dad are selling the place I don't wanna take all my stuff to Princeton.
LEADMALE:Can I leave some of it in your apartment? Pfft.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, uh No, I can't do that.
OTHERFEMALE:See, uh, my place kind of small, man.
SUPMALE:I thought you just said it was big.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:No.
SUPMALE:I mean, uh, it's big in a real petite kind of way.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:I know what this is.
SUPMALE:You do?
LEADFEMALE:Separation anxiety.
LEADMALE:You can't bear to have reminders of me in your new place.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come here, you big lug.
LEADMALE:Will, don't hide your emotions.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Carlton, I don't have no separation anxiety.
SUPFEMALE:I got no-apartment anxiety.
LEADMALE:Oh, someone's hiding their true feelings.
LEADFEMALE:Come out, come out, wherever you are.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, stop.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, stop.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have an apartment.
LEADFEMALE:What? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I never had one.
LEADFEMALE: Why'd you lie? I don't know, man.
LEADFEMALE:Y'all was all going on with your stuff.
LEADMALE:Look, I just did.
LEADMALE:Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Will, I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:When I gave you a hard time earlier about frittering I didn't mean anything by it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just that you was right.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, why don't you move back East with us? You could transfer to a school in New York.
LEADFEMALE:You could take the job on the Hilary Show, you could be near the family.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, just make it easy on yourself.
LEADMALE:Carlton, I don't wanna make it easy on myself.
LEADFEMALE:I came out here to go to school and that's what I'm gonna do.
LEADMALE:Period.
SUPMALE:I started it and I'm gonna finish it.
LEADMALE:Look, I just need to get myself situated.
SUPFEMALE:So, what are you gonna do? Gotta get out there and look for a place.
LEADMALE:You know what? Dad could help you out in a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go
LEADMALE:Carlton, no.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton.
OTHERMALE:No, I don't want Uncle Phil to know nothing about this.
SUPFEMALE:Why? That's dumb.
SUPMALE:Carlton, I do not need Uncle Phil to clean up all my messes.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:You are gonna swear to me right now, you ain't gonna say nothing to nobody.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I swear.
SUPMALE:Hello, Master William, you're back early.
SUPMALE:How's the apartment hunt going? Pfft.
LEADFEMALE:Please, don't ask.
OTHERMALE:Where's everybody at? They're gone.
SUPFEMALE:We're showing the house today, remember? Oh, right.
SUPMALE:What are you still doing here? That's a question that haunts me every day.
LEADMALE:Actually, I'm here to answer questions about the house.
LEADMALE:That is not your job.
LEADMALE:There they go abusing you again.
SUPMALE:I mean, I love them but it hurts me so bad the way they treat you.
LEADMALE:G, you go ahead get out of here, man.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take care of it.
OTHERFEMALE:You will do your best? What would make me happier than selling the house? Not selling the house? Yep.
LEADMALE:You know, this looks like a great place, Arnold.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, Willis would love it.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that is if he wouldn't mind living over a haunted Indian burial ground.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? Hey, I'm Will Smith.
SUPMALE:I'm the Realto.
OTHERMALE:At night, you can hear the wailing of the dead.
LEADFEMALE: What you talking about, Will? I think he's overstating it a little bit, Arnold.
LEADMALE:You're probably right, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Let's check out this fly pad.
SUPFEMALE:I could get used to living in the lap of luxury.
LEADFEMALE:You know, those things were a lot funnier when you were still a little child.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, Dad, your little stories were a lot more interesting back then too.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, let's check out the wet bar.
SUPMALE:Oh, wait, wait.
OTHERMALE:Uh, we don't have one.
LEADMALE:Let's check out the house down the street.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks anyway.
LEADMALE: Yes.
LEADFEMALE:And this is the living room.
LEADMALE:Come on, shake a leg.
OTHERMALE:We gotta get to the Universal Tour and see the Backdraft ride.
LEADMALE:Oh, then you should probably leave now before the fire goes out.
SUPMALE:Oh, believe me, Will.
LEADMALE:The fire went out a long time ago.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, George, this place is beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, Weezy, we can't afford it.
OTHERMALE:How can you say that? Easy.
LEADFEMALE:He's cheap.
OTHERFEMALE:If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut.
LEADMALE:Out here, there are a lot of people crossing the border to get a job like yours.
SUPFEMALE:One look at a bald-headed miser like you, they'll be crossing right back over.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you, Weezy, it's too expensive.
OTHERMALE:Oh, loosen up, George.
LEADFEMALE:I like it.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, and let me tell you.
LEADMALE:Next door, ooh, the girls, man.
LEADMALE:Bikinis all that.
LEADFEMALE:They got a regular Playboy mansion jumping off over there.
LEADFEMALE:Memorial Day, it all comes off, you know what I'm talking about?
LEADMALE:You know what I'm talking about, boy?
LEADMALE:Ha, ha! Come on, George.
SUPMALE:This place is too expensive.
LEADMALE:It all comes off, huh?
LEADMALE:Man, let me tell you George! 
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, what's up, y'all?
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, it's the Realto.
SUPMALE:Now, don't get your hopes up, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I mean, it could take weeks or months, even years to sell a house.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah?  Great.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:We have a buyer.
SUPFEMALE:VIVIAN: What?
LEADMALE:That's fantastic.
SUPFEMALE:A couple.
OTHERMALE:The Jeffersons.
SUPFEMALE:There's only one catch.
LEADFEMALE:We have to be out in a week.
LEADMALE:Why such a rush? Something about being in by Memorial Day and it all coming off.
LEADMALE:We can't possibly be out in seven days.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we have to organize, we have to pack, we have to move.
SUPMALE:I mean, Geoffrey only has two hands.
SUPFEMALE:Our apartment's not even ready.
LEADFEMALE:Where are we gonna live? And my dorm room's not ready.
SUPMALE:And what about Will? Oh, Will's set, huh?  I have an idea.
LEADMALE:Why don't we check into the Plaza Hotel? Or perhaps the Hilton.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE: Good one, Daddy.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, we'll stay at the Plaza.
LEADMALE:Let's crack open a bottle of champagne.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, champagne.
LEADMALE:Girl.
SUPFEMALE:So, Will, what are you gonna do? Hey, hey, hey, no need to stress, C.
SUPMALE:I mean, I still got seven days.
OTHERMALE:God built the whole universe in that much time.
SUPFEMALE:He had better credit.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:I mean, I know I don't have any references and I don't have any credit, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, is it? Oh, it is? Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:Well Get the Ha, ha Hello? Hello? I cannot believe it's that hard to rent an apartment.
SUPMALE:Yes, to think that all landlords wouldn't jump at the chance to rent to somebody with no job, no references, no credit.
SUPFEMALE:It's because I'm black, ain't it? Hey, Will.
LEADMALE:How's your apartment? Is everything set up? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:It's cool, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:All set.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I haven't seen it.
SUPMALE:Has anyone? Oh, well, from When I took the, um Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:I have.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what does it look like? Well, it's wall-to-wall doors and floor-to-ceiling floors.
LEADMALE:It's neat.
LEADFEMALE:It makes this place look tiny.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Ahem.
LEADMALE:You know, I think Carlton's just bragging a little too much.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna see it.
LEADFEMALE:We'd all like to see it.
SUPFEMALE:Um, well, you can't.
LEADFEMALE:Because it's tented.
LEADMALE:Look, C No, you can't because I don't have an apartment.
SUPMALE:It's a condo is what it is.
LEADMALE:Look, that's all right.
OTHERFEMALE:That's all right, C.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I don't have an apartment and I never had one.
SUPMALE:Would you excuse us for a minute, please? I'm sorry, Will.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is going on? Look, um, Uncle Phil, this is not really your concern.
LEADMALE:You know, it's about me, it's not about you.
SUPMALE:So don't even worry about it, all right?
LEADMALE:How can you say that? We are leaving town in a day and you don't have a place to live.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you lie? I mean, we sitting around the table and everybody talking about all these great lives and these new things they're doing.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want you to say: "Hey, there's my nephew.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, he's still living in my pool house.
OTHERFEMALE:" I didn't want you to think that all these years that I've been out here just ain't worth nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, that you just been wasting your time with me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, I just don't want you to think that I'm that same stupid kid I was when I first moved out here.
SUPMALE:How could you possibly believe that that's what I'd be thinking? Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:You're moving out on your own.
LEADMALE:You're gonna finish college in a year.
SUPMALE:You're becoming a man.
OTHERMALE:A man I'm damn proud of.
SUPMALE:I just didn't want your last memory of me to be no better than the first one.
SUPFEMALE:You have no idea what my first memory of you is.
OTHERFEMALE:I remember a kid loaded with all the potential in the world.
LEADFEMALE:And now I see a person on the verge of realizing that potential.
SUPMALE:Come on, let's go get you an apartment.
SUPMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, um what you mean by verge?
SUPMALE:Don't push your luck.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait, check this out.
LEADMALE:I didn't know I had two Biggie Smalls CDs.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:One of them is mine.
LEADFEMALE:You own a Biggie Smalls CD? Well, you know, I'd like to think of myself as with it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, look at you, boy.
LEADMALE:Six years, you couldn't fight the flood, could you? Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I know I don't own two What's New Pussycats? I don't know why we standing here talking.
LEADMALE:We gotta get packed, man.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Will this is the last time we'll ever live together.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We've been through a lot together.
LEADMALE:Childhood to manhood.
LEADFEMALE:It's been a good trip.
LEADFEMALE:It's been a great trip.
SUPFEMALE:Look, whenever, wherever, I got your back, C.
SUPMALE:Whenever, wherever, I've got your back, W.
SUPMALE:That just doesn't sound right coming from me, does it? Sounds great, man.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? CARLTON: What are you doing? Oh, no, no.
SUPMALE:You got to do it.
LEADFEMALE:One last time for me, man.
SUPMALE:  It's not unusual to be loved by anyone It's not unusual to have fun with anyone But when I see you hanging about With anyone It's not unusual to see me cry I wanna die It's not unusual to go out at any time But when I see you out and about It's such a crime If you should ever wanna Be loved by anyone It's not unusual It happens every day No matter what you say  Wow, it's so empty.

LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Lot of good times in this house, huh?
LEADFEMALE:A lifetime's worth.
LEADFEMALE:You okay? Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:I'm cool.
LEADFEMALE:I'm cool, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, it's just when I first came out here, you know I was a relative.
LEADMALE:But for the past six years, it's like we've been family.
LEADMALE:I just don't wanna go back to being just a relative again.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I lived without a father and without brothers and sisters and all of that.
SUPMALE:I like this life better.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you to call me on Sundays too when you're calling all your other kids.
