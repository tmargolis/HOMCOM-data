LEADFEMALE:Hey, Will, what's going on? Lisa's coming over.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna watch a couple action-adventure flicks tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if I get lucky we'll have a little action adventure of our own.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? So, what movies did you rent, Casanova? Oh, we got Terminator 2, Lethal Weapon 3 and my personal favorite, Maniac Cop VII.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like a romantic evening.
LEADFEMALE:What's Lisa going to do? Lookie here, lookie here, Spanky.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I'm the man.
LEADMALE:You see what I'm saying? I'm the Man-dingo.
SUPMALE:Lisa will watch what I tell her to watch and she will enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:And that, as they say, is that.
LEADMALE:If you'll excuse me, it's about to get X-rated in here.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean?
LEADFEMALE:Hey!
LEADFEMALE:Hey, baby.
LEADMALE:Hey! What's up girl? So, what movies did you get? Terms of Endearment, Fried Green Tomatoes and The Joy Luck Club.
LEADMALE:Shall I get us some hankies? What are you so happy about? I just made the weekend reservations at Palm Springs for me and Lisa.
SUPMALE:Lisa? You've been seeing a lot of her lately.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah, and if it goes the way I plan I'll be seeing the rest of her this weekend, you know? Have you no shame? Yeah, I'm ashamed of you.
LEADMALE:Well, while you're wallowing in your sordid filth of a life I'll be pursuing some culture.
OTHERMALE:I bought tickets to The Jeffersons live on stage.
OTHERFEMALE:It includes dinner with Sherman Hemsley and an autograph picture of both Lionels.
LEADFEMALE:Swell.
SUPFEMALE:That will go great with your Weezy collectible cups.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Kool-Aid! I got your Kool-Aid, all right? You look so good.
LEADMALE:You are gonna be a hit at the Bahamas.
LEADMALE:I can't wait to see your mother down there.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been practicing my limbo.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Dad, that limbo bar gets as low as 13 inches.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, Carlton, you could just walk right under.
LEADFEMALE:Will's shacking up with some girl in Palm Springs.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna get it now, mister.
LEADMALE:Have fun.
SUPMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Is that all you're gonna say to him? Am I paying for your little trip?
LEADMALE:Well, no.
SUPFEMALE:Five up top.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Master William, Miss Lisa is here to see you.
LEADMALE:Oh, sugar-wugar, now, come on, girl.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and sir, the limbo bar is set at three feet when you're ready.
OTHERFEMALE:Excellent.
SUPMALE:He couldn't make that lying flat on his back.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, now, say those words that you know send chills up my spine.
LEADMALE:I want you to meet my father.
LEADMALE:What you talking about, girl?
LEADFEMALE:Well, baby, he and I are very close.
LEADFEMALE:And before you and I get any closer I think that you should meet him.
LEADMALE:That's cool.
LEADMALE:I'll meet him when we come back from Palm Springs.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, check it out.
LEADMALE:I got us the Wilt Chamberlain suite.
SUPMALE:With the electronic scoreboard over the bed and everything.
SUPMALE:Well, before you and I get into a little one on one you're gonna have to talk to the head coach.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'm saying, what if he ain't playing off the same playbook I am? Well, then we're gonna have to call a time-out.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, don't be using my analogy against me.
LEADMALE:Come on, baby.
LEADMALE:I'm just not gonna be comfortable going unless I know that my father approves of you.
LEADMALE:As if there's anything not to approve of.
LEADMALE:Oh, not the ears, baby.
LEADMALE:All right, I'll talk to your daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Keep doing that, we're gonna have to dig up his daddy, I'll talk to him too.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have a non-profit book by African-American photographers? You mean Songs of My People? It's a very popular book.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, we're not non-profit.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hi, hey, hey, hey.

LEADMALE:"This is CNN.
OTHERFEMALE:" Well, I've got to get to class.
SUPFEMALE:I want you guys to enjoy each other.
OTHERMALE:So how's the grub here, Wilbur? Well, we've only had two food-related deaths in the past month.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't read about that.
SUPFEMALE:You must be doing a good job as a manager to keep something like that quiet.
SUPFEMALE:Well, actually my cousin Carlton is the manager, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm pretty much just Trying to score with my daughter.

SUPFEMALE:There's nothing in the world I won't do for her.
SUPFEMALE:And I really respect that, sir.
SUPFEMALE:And if you don't mind me saying so, that is a lovely picture of your wife.
LEADFEMALE:I see where Lisa gets her good looks from.
LEADMALE:That's not my wife.
LEADFEMALE:That's my sister-in-law Cecilia.
LEADFEMALE:She's so ugly, she'd make an onion cry.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I was being polite.
OTHERFEMALE:She is a dog.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, she's so ugly, she could make a freight train take a dirt road.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, maybe I'll just do that.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, okay.
OTHERMALE:All right, the sun sets in the west, right? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right.

LEADFEMALE:Stop spouting all that witchcraft.
LEADMALE:All we got to do is just stay put.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure they're out there looking for me.
LEADMALE:Not if they know you.
LEADFEMALE:You know what, boy? You've got a double order of lip.
OTHERMALE:And I got a short stack of patience.

LEADMALE:Don't worry, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure everything's gonna be okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? I'm missing The Jeffersons live on stage.
SUPFEMALE:Right now I bet George is calling somebody a jive turkey.
LEADMALE:What are you complaining about? This is hardly the way I wanted to spend my weekend.
SUPMALE:Sitting around in some dusty old shack waiting for Will to show up.
SUPMALE:Man, it's tough finding people in the woods.
LEADMALE:We'll try again in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Well, no hurry.
LEADFEMALE:Look, my nephew is a city boy.
LEADMALE:I'm worried he might not survive in the woods.
LEADMALE:Oh, where's he from?
OTHERMALE:West Philadelphia.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, don't worry.
OTHERMALE:If he can survive there a couple of snakes and bears aren't gonna bother him.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? What's it look like? I'm blowing on the embers.
LEADMALE:You're blowing the fire out, man.
OTHERMALE:Look, relax, I got an idea.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Just stand back, please.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing with my Red Rooster? Damn! And that was just the mild.
SUPFEMALE:Man.
OTHERMALE:Look at those stars.
LEADFEMALE:You don't see them like that back in the city.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, too much light.
LEADMALE:You know, being out here in nature two guys against the elements it's like guys just naturally kind of bond with each other, you know? You come together through a tough situation.
SUPMALE:Actually start to like each other.
SUPFEMALE:That ain't happening with us.
LEADMALE:Not even a little.
LEADFEMALE:Man, look at that moon.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what you know about some jazz, boy? Oh, man, my grandma used to play Ella all the time.
LEADMALE:Ella, Sarah, Thelonius, Miles, Bert.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, those were the days.
LEADFEMALE:Before the music died.
LEADMALE:Hey, yeah, you can stop there.
LEADMALE:The music ain't died.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you got Guru, Diggable Planets, A Tribe Called Quest.
SUPFEMALE:The defense rests.
LEADMALE:No, I'm telling you, they got a nice blend of the old school with the new.
LEADFEMALE:Lisa likes it.
OTHERMALE:Lisa listens to jazz? Oh, man, we listen to jazz every time when we try to get in the mood Is that Orion the Hunter? Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Will, about Lisa sometime I am a little overprotective of her.
LEADMALE:But she's my baby girl.
LEADMALE:Heck, she's all I got now that I lost my plane.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm saying, I mean, I can dig that and everything.
SUPMALE:But don't you care what she wants?
LEADFEMALE:Nope.
OTHERMALE:Put some more hot sauce on the fire.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go on to bed.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I always found it so incredible that only I could prevent forest fires.
LEADMALE:I mean, that's so much responsibility.
SUPFEMALE:I really should be out there looking for your cousin.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Will likes to sleep in.
LEADFEMALE:Will!
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank God you're all right.
SUPFEMALE:The pool house wouldn't have been the same without you.
LEADMALE:Hey, thanks a lot, Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:There, I said it.
LEADFEMALE:You happy? Will, where's my father?
LEADFEMALE:Hey, it's all right, baby, he is fine.
SUPMALE:But what happened? Well, you know, we had a little engine trouble and we went down.
LEADMALE:But it was the best thing could have happened to us.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we landed kind of in this wooded glade, you know near this bubbling brook.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of looked like the beer commercials.
LEADFEMALE:Except there wasn't no naked honeys.
SUPFEMALE:There wasn't no beer.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, but you know what? I don't know if it was the beauty of the area or just being outdoors, but we kind of bonded.
LEADMALE:Why didn't he come back with you? Look, I could not tear him away.
LEADMALE:I told him we could walk down this brook, take us back to civilization.
LEADMALE:But he said, "No, you go on without me I wanna stay here and be at one with nature.
SUPMALE:" You can't be at one when you two.
LEADMALE:So I jetted.
SUPMALE:Really? You know what? I'm telling you, your father is a changed man.
OTHERFEMALE:He said we should go to Palm Springs and enjoy ourselves.
LEADFEMALE:You mean he actually said that we could go? He insisted.
LEADFEMALE:Now that you're safe, I can still catch my flight to the Bahamas.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, everybody, let's go, we're out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Where's that boy with that firewood? Wilbur! Outside is a trail of hot sauce.
LEADFEMALE:Light a match, take you right to him.
SUPMALE:Wilbur! Robin Hood, are you around here? Anybody! Red Rooster? Anybody, give me a hand.
SUPFEMALE:Squirrel! I need Give me a piece of cheese, I'm hungry.
SUPFEMALE:Little Red Riding Hood, where are you? Wilbur! Hey! They leaving me out here by myself.
