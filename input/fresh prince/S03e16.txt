SUPFEMALE:You know, I used to think the only reason to kill a man was self-defense but I just spent 45 minutes in the Volvo with another reason.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with him?
LEADFEMALE:This idiot is taking a mime class.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, get I swear to God, Carlton, get away from me with this.
LEADFEMALE:Stop.
LEADFEMALE:Stop playing.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, stop or I'll hang you with that rope! All right, that's it.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:I was going to throw him out on the freeway but you know the old 
SUPMALE:A mime is a terrible thing to waste.
LEADMALE:Now we are entering the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:This is where we eat.
LEADFEMALE:Some of us more than others.
LEADMALE:And this is your mommy and she look like she eating for a couple of brothers herself.
LEADFEMALE:Will, what are you doing with that microphone? Making a tape for the coming attraction.
LEADMALE:You know, I was going to knit some booties or something but you know, I had to get yarn and needles and I'd have had to learn how to knit.
LEADFEMALE:See, look, Uncle Phil, the concept is to aesthetically capture for posterity the sounds that are familiar to this house.
LEADMALE:Will, I'm eating.
SUPMALE:You'll hear a lot of that.
LEADMALE:You're grounded.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that about sums up Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Yo, G, what sound do you think accurately depicts your position in the family? You're sick, man.
LEADMALE:See a therapist, okay? Hey, Ashley, say something to the baby.
SUPFEMALE:Care to elaborate?
SUPFEMALE:A lot.
SUPFEMALE:Don't feel bad.
OTHERMALE:She just mad 'cause she found out she ain't adopted.
LEADFEMALE:So Mom's having a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Big deal.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you didn't go through all this for me.
LEADMALE:You probably smoked cigarettes and rode horseback until the day I was born.
LEADMALE:Ashley, honey, come on, we prepared for you and took the same precautions as we did for Hilary and Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Bungee jumping.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, the baby's moving, feel my stomach.
LEADMALE:Hey, I move all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Let's have a party.
LEADFEMALE:All you guys do is talk about the baby.
SUPMALE:The baby's clothes, the baby's room.
LEADFEMALE:The baby, baby, baby.
SUPFEMALE:You'll forget all about me after you have it, Mommy.
LEADMALE:I can see it coming.
LEADMALE:Good morning, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:Morning, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, my place isn't set, and where's my food? Let me feed my favorite little cousin.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, come on.
LEADMALE:Oh, I thought it was my turn.
LEADMALE:I thought I was your favorite cousin.
SUPMALE:What do I have to do, spit up on your shirt? Y'all hear something? Yeah, how about me screaming at the top of my lungs? I guess not.
OTHERMALE:I be tripping, boy, tripping.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy.
SUPMALE:There's my favorite little girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy, don't you remember me? It's me, Ashley.
LEADMALE:She's so precious.
LEADFEMALE:You know, she reminds me of someone.
SUPMALE:That little girl who used to hang out around here.
OTHERFEMALE:Pretty little thing.
SUPMALE:Black hair.
SUPMALE:Amanda.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:Or was it Anna?
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
OTHERMALE:I'm pretty sure it was Appalonia.
LEADMALE:No, it was Ashley.
LEADMALE:Well, hold up, was it Ashley?
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Ashley, honey, your father and I have always been here and we will always make time for you.
LEADMALE:Hilary, why not? I mean, it will help your ratings.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to hear about it anymore, okay? Now, here come your two eldest siblings, Dopey and Greedy.
OTHERMALE:No, Carlton, I will not plug your stupid school play on my weather spot today, tomorrow, or ever.
SUPMALE:Well, for your information, Brigadoon is a classic musical comedy.
OTHERFEMALE:No, man, for my money, classic musical 
LEADFEMALE:Milli Vanilli.
SUPMALE:Think about it, Hilary's special because she's the oldest.
LEADMALE:Carlton's the only boy.
OTHERMALE:I was the baby, but who am I now? The whiner.
LEADFEMALE:Look, lighten up, Ashley.
LEADMALE:We all have our burdens to bear I mean, when the new Banks arrives, Dad's going to have to update his will which means there'll be another slice of the pie I won't be getting.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, what about my needs? What about me?
SUPMALE:What about
SUPMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Good call.
LEADFEMALE:I can't wait till the new baby's born.
LEADFEMALE:Then I can do all those special things that big sisters do.
OTHERMALE:Like when you took me up to the attic window and told me I could fly? Or when you told me it was okay to roller skate down the steps.
OTHERMALE:Judging by your lovely brothers and sisters you're going to need an insurance policy before you're potty trained.
LEADMALE:Look, I'll have you guys know that I had a hand in raising you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be a positive influence on the new baby.
OTHERMALE:You just wait and see.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary, baby, you're 30 years old.
LEADMALE:Don't you think it's about time you moved out on your own? That is so unfair.
LEADFEMALE:Mom's 50 years old and you haven't pushed her out the door.
SUPFEMALE:Why do I even bother? Cindy.
SUPFEMALE:Aren't you forgetting something, baby sister?
SUPMALE:You're prettier than I'll ever be.
LEADFEMALE:Something else.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm feeling a little warm.
SUPFEMALE:So, tell me about your day at school and move a little to the left.
OTHERMALE:Well, Miss Randolph gave a pop quiz and l
LEADMALE:Do you like my outfit?
LEADMALE:It's real pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, my arm is starting to hurt.
LEADMALE:You poor baby.
LEADFEMALE:Use the other arm.
SUPMALE:Maybe you should start lifting weights.
LEADMALE:Anyway, go on with your story.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Myra Walker brought a hamster to class for show and tell
LEADMALE:Should I color my hair?
LEADMALE:No, it's beautiful.
LEADMALE:It is, isn't it? Guess what? I have a little surprise for you.
LEADFEMALE:Ta-da! Oh, goody, a shoeshine kit.
SUPFEMALE:I know I spoil you, but I just couldn't resist.
SUPFEMALE:Do you like my shoes? They're great.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, they'd be even better if they were shiny.
SUPMALE:Can I put the fan down first? This time.
LEADFEMALE:It is your birthday.
LEADFEMALE:But don't make a habit of it.
LEADMALE:A spit polish.
SUPMALE:I meant on the shoes.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'd just be better off being invisible.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, what'd you say, Ash? Hold it there, home fry.
SUPMALE:Say a little something to spud.
LEADMALE:Hey, little bro, piece of 
SUPFEMALE:Don't lend Will a penny even if he begs, and he will.
LEADMALE:That's your brother Carlton.
LEADMALE:You'll recognize him, he'll be the one at eye-level.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hello, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Graham.
OTHERMALE:Yes, this is Philip Banks.
SUPMALE:Fine, fine, thank you, and how are you? Unusual? I see.
LEADMALE:Are you sure? Okay, I'll tell her right away.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Doctor.
LEADMALE:Vivian, you better sit down.
LEADFEMALE:I am sitting down.
SUPMALE:Philip, is there something wrong with the baby? No, that was the doctor.
OTHERFEMALE:He just said that he thinks that we're having twins.
LEADMALE:Twins!
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God!
LEADMALE:Two birds! Two birds!
LEADMALE:Come on, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Philip, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I got it, y'all.
SUPMALE:Look out.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? Come on, get him up, get him up.
OTHERFEMALE:I remember something about twins and I have this incredible urge for a sausage.
SUPMALE:Philip, the doctor called, but there must be some mistake.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't possibly be having twins.
OTHERMALE:We'll have to split the inheritance four ways thanks to Forget-the-pill Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Is that all you think about? Pretty much.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know about y'all, I'm excited we having twins.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, now you can finally have the son you always wanted.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they already have me.
LEADMALE:Now, you can finally have the son you always wanted.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, Doctor.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I figured there must be some mistake.
LEADMALE:I knew I couldn't possibly be having twins.
OTHERMALE:Triplets? That's right, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be having three little ones so I suggest a lot more help.
LEADMALE:Preferably a young nanny amply endowed, with no inhibitions.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:Might I get you anything?
SUPMALE:An explanation.
SUPMALE:Mid-life crisis.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey, why did you do it? I'm terribly sorry, madam.
LEADMALE:It was just the thought of one more person to clean up after was more than I could bear.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, this baby is all of our responsibility and I promise you we will not leave you with all the work.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, I told you, I wanted tomatoes in my omelet.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, I need some sliced cucumbers for my eyelids.
LEADFEMALE:G, the phone's ringing.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, you did my homework all wrong.
LEADMALE:Do it again.
SUPFEMALE:Master William, would you go change the baby? I'm trying to do 10 things at once! Sorry, no can do, G.
LEADMALE:I'm about to go shoot some hoops.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, do me a favor, spit shine my kicks for me, though.
LEADMALE:Thanks, babe.
LEADMALE:For heaven's sake, I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Daddy.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey is so lazy.
LEADFEMALE:So, how's Jamaica? What'd you buy me? Great.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we'll see you soon.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what did your father say? For God's sake, when are they coming back? They'll be home in time for graduation.
OTHERMALE:Thank heavens.
LEADFEMALE:The baby's.
LEADMALE:They figure you can handle things until then.
LEADFEMALE:Look, G, check it out, I'm a peace-Ioving brother but if you don't hurry up with my kicks, I'm gonna split your wig, man.
LEADFEMALE:I want a new omelet.
OTHERFEMALE:Homework.
LEADMALE:Cucumbers.
SUPMALE:Are you ignorant?
LEADMALE:I know you old.
LEADFEMALE:I want the omelet.
LEADFEMALE:When you old, you do stuff like this.
LEADMALE:What's up with my kicks? Calgon, take me away! Geoffrey, you're exaggerating.
LEADFEMALE:And you're lying through your bonded teeth.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:He pretends he doesn't like the family but deep down inside he really hates us.
OTHERMALE:That's not true.
OTHERFEMALE:I can tolerate Miss Ashley.
LEADMALE:Man, I can't wait to start my own family.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, I want to have a whole bunch of kids, like six and I'm going to have them one right after another.
SUPMALE:Will, we're talking about kids, not malt liquor.
LEADMALE:Why don't you shut up before we send you back to that white family that dropped you off on the doorstep? I don't know if I want to have kids.
LEADMALE:Why not? I told you, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary, honey, you're gonna change your mind.
SUPMALE:Having kids makes life worthwhile.
LEADMALE:Boy, I just can't wait.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'm gonna have the perfect life with a perfect wife and perfect kids.
OTHERMALE:It's perfect.
LEADMALE:Honey, I'm home.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, dear, did you have a tough day shooting the naked centerfolds? Yeah, babe, it was hell.
OTHERMALE:Today we shot La Toya Jackson.
LEADMALE:And I had to keep turning the lights off 'cause she was melting.
LEADFEMALE:You poor baby.
SUPMALE:Why don't you glue yourself to the television set completely ignore me and play Nintendo until you're too tired to make love?
OTHERMALE:You mean you don't mind?
SUPFEMALE:Have I ever? I'm perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Father.
LEADMALE:Hey, Shaquille, Barkley, Jordan.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, forget about that.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we go outside and shoot some hoops? What are hoops? I think he's referring to that sport where a spherical object is thrown into a round receptacle at opposite ends of a court.
OTHERFEMALE:You watch your mouth, boy.
LEADMALE:All right, look, forget basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, come here, come here.
LEADMALE:What do y'all say we sneak and get some candy before dinner? But that would spoil our appetite, and tonight we're having liver.
LEADMALE:Yeah! Shantay! Don't do that.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, dear.
OTHERMALE:Did you want something? Yes, I'd like to know what pods these kids came from.
SUPMALE:Actually, Father, we came from a zygote.
OTHERMALE:You see, in human reproduction Knock it off.
LEADMALE:Ever since you won that Nobel Prize you think you're so doggone smart.
LEADMALE:Honey, you seem tense.
LEADFEMALE:I am tense.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody all perfect, baby, I don't know.
SUPMALE:Why don't I send the children away and dress up in that French maid's uniform and give you a nice hot-oil massage? You, you, you! Why must everything always be about you? What about my needs? I'm sorry, honey.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want? I want a girl with extensions in her hair and bamboo earrings, at least two pair.
SUPMALE:I want kids that pick their noses sometimes and roll me when I'm drunk.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I want a dirty house.
SUPFEMALE:No, I want a dirty house.
SUPMALE:I want to argue in public, you know.
LEADMALE:I want you to have a headache sometime.
OTHERFEMALE:I want a regular life.
LEADFEMALE:I want a regular marriage.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetheart, you seem upset.
LEADFEMALE:Let's all give Daddy a great big hug.
LEADMALE:No! No!
SUPMALE:Yeah! No! See, Will, I told you this baby thing was a lousy idea.
SUPMALE:Kids aren't all they're cracked up to be.
SUPMALE:And I know, I used to be one.
LEADFEMALE:Now, stop it all of you.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I cannot wait for this baby to get here.
SUPMALE:And that's not just because I'm retaining more water than the Hoover Dam.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, honey we're not going to forget you when the baby comes.
LEADMALE:You'll see, this will bring us all closer together.
LEADFEMALE:That's true, Ash.
SUPMALE:I mean, look at us now.
LEADFEMALE:Last time we sat around like this is when they reran Roots.
LEADMALE:Maybe you guys are right.
LEADFEMALE:We shouldn't be so selfish and think about ourselves all the time Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I don't mind sharing my inheritance with the baby.
OTHERMALE:We're not dead yet, Carlton.
OTHERMALE:Hey, it's a cruel world, big guy and you're not going to be in it forever.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Now, now, come on, let's not spoil the mood.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's go to dinner, huh?
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:You, too, Geoffrey.
OTHERMALE:Zip-a-dee, and might I add doo-dah! Maybe this will be a good idea.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go grab my sweater.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I don't feel good.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:You're coming.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, but I'm not sitting between you and the dessert cart.
OTHERFEMALE:Last time I almost lost an eye.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, so where are we going? I say Snuffy's Catfish and Biscuits.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't we just go eat out of a dumpster?
SUPMALE:Come on, let's decide in the car.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:How about Haitian?
LEADMALE:Let's get some Haitian food.
LEADFEMALE:French.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready.
LEADMALE:And, you know, I'm feeling really silly about that invisible stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd everybody go? Hey, no! Hey, wait for me! Oh, no! And all those big nasty women you be bringing up in here, too.
OTHERFEMALE:You think Uncle Phil don't know.
LEADMALE:He knows.
LEADMALE:He knows what you do, Geoffrey, okay? Now, I'm asking you to just do my sneaks.
LEADFEMALE:I want to go.
LEADFEMALE:I want to run some balls going to be some girls there, I gotta look cute.
LEADMALE:If I have dirty sneaks, other guys going to get the girls.
SUPMALE:All I'm asking is to have some clean sneaks when I go dunk on some people, all right? So, Geoffrey, straighten your act up.
SUPMALE:Okay, look, get some Calgon, take me away! 
SUPFEMALE:
