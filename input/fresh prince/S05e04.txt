LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when I was growing up, my best friend lived in the next apartment.
LEADMALE:His name was Ralph.
LEADMALE:And one day, after 18 years of friendship, we had a fight.
SUPMALE:Well, I went to college and he joined the Navy.
LEADFEMALE:Five years ago I went to our high school reunion.
LEADFEMALE:I was determined to bury the hatchet.
OTHERFEMALE:But Ralph didn't show up.
SUPFEMALE:I found out that he died the month before.
LEADMALE:Well, I never had a chance to make peace with him.
LEADFEMALE:What's even worse, I can't even remember what we fought about.
SUPFEMALE:You kids should think about that.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Hold up a second there, Aesop.
LEADMALE:What's this apartment stuff? Thought you grew up on a farm.
LEADFEMALE:Well, in the South, "farm" and "apartment" are interchangeable.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Uh, uh, five years ago? Since when do they have reunions for your 22nd year?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, man.
SUPMALE:And how all of a sudden?
LEADMALE:Okay, okay, I made it up.
LEADMALE:All right? Pfft.
SUPMALE:Huh.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess lying just run all through this family, huh? I'm not lying, you nefarious, degenerate miscreant.
LEADMALE:Oh, like I'm supposed to believe that, you big dog.
LEADFEMALE:Did you put super glue in my hair gel?  Hey, that's what you get for stealing my girl.
LEADMALE:I didn't have to steal her.
LEADMALE:She was bored with you so she came to me, a real man.
LEADMALE:So, what you saying? I'm not a real man? Yeah, you got it.
LEADMALE:You should know that all that "yo, yo, hey, baby, bap, bap, bap" stuff is just played out.
OTHERFEMALE:It worked in high school, but now it's just embarrassing.
OTHERMALE:So I'm the embarrassment now? Take it easy, stumpy.
LEADFEMALE:You know something else? I'm tired of all those short jokes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm average height.
LEADFEMALE:For a woman.
SUPFEMALE:I'm large enough for Valerie.
LEADFEMALE:You wants to go there, huh? You know what? I'm sick of this.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go right now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sick of this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sick of this.

LEADMALE:Like that hurt.
OTHERMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:Will, are you okay? Will, wake up.
LEADMALE:Will, come on.
OTHERFEMALE: Damn, still alive.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what keeps me going? The thought of dancing on your grave.
SUPFEMALE:Dance on my grave, will you? Damn.
LEADMALE:Come, Mr.

OTHERFEMALE:I ought to knock your teeth out.
LEADMALE:Go ahead, they're in the glass next to my bed.
SUPMALE:Is that what you want? Aw.
LEADFEMALE:Got to go back to the ghetto on you now.
LEADMALE: You're trying to kill me.
OTHERFEMALE: Will.
SUPMALE:You all right?
SUPFEMALE:Come closer.
LEADFEMALE:You all right? I'm feeling the life being sucked out of me.
SUPFEMALE:Before I die I just want you to know that I I hate you.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Carlton, wake up.
OTHERMALE:Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I never got to tell you I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE: Why, Carlton? Will, hold you head back.
LEADMALE:It'll stop the bleeding.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I think you've helped enough.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you're wondering what happened.
SUPFEMALE:What's to wonder? Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:I have a nephew with a possibly broken nose.
SUPFEMALE:And I don't wanna even know why your damn hands are stuck to your head.
LEADFEMALE:What I do know is that I want both of you to settle this thing or I will.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:You got it, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:You got it.
LEADMALE:We can handle it.
OTHERMALE:
LEADFEMALE:It's done.
LEADMALE:We can handle it.
LEADMALE:Just go on.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Carlton, um I was doing a lot of thinking while I was unconscious.
LEADMALE:We're cousins, man.
LEADMALE:We've been together long enough.
SUPMALE:I should know you would never do to me the kind of things that I would do to you.
SUPFEMALE:That's sweet, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry for saying all those things and for punching your lights out.
LEADFEMALE:It was a lucky shot.
SUPFEMALE:I hit you pretty square, Will.
LEADMALE:Look, the important thing is that we get beyond that lucky punch.
SUPMALE:We're family, man.
LEADFEMALE:We shouldn't be fighting like this.
OTHERMALE:We should be helping each other.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, put her there.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, man.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry about the hair.
SUPMALE:Let me help you.
LEADFEMALE:
