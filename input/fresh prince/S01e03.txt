LEADFEMALE:What dog did he steal that sweater from? Probably his wife.
LEADFEMALE:Good God, who shot the couch? Give her a break, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:She just won the Kentucky Derby.
LEADFEMALE:Who's that lady with Nell Carter? That's not Nell Carter.
OTHERMALE:That's my father! God, you're so shallow.
LEADMALE:I hate you.
LEADMALE:You're stupid and ugly and I wish you would die.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Look at her! Brake! Hit the brake, Will!
LEADFEMALE:What in the hell are you doing?
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:It ain't my fault.
LEADMALE:I panicked.
SUPMALE:That squirrel came out of nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, I'll call the manager and have him remove the cart.
OTHERMALE:Oh, let's just draw more attention to ourselves.
SUPFEMALE:Get in the cart, Vivian.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks, but no golf carts in the dining room.
LEADMALE:You've certainly made a name at this country club.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't be surprised if they revoked our shuffleboard privileges.
LEADMALE:That's fine with me.
LEADMALE:This place is wack.
LEADMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Hold up.
LEADMALE:Special bulletin.
LEADMALE:Hormones to Will.
SUPMALE:Hold up yourself, Will.
LEADFEMALE:That's Mimi Mumford.
SUPFEMALE:You can't get to first base with her unless you impress her father.
OTHERFEMALE:He's an eminent surgeon, a championship polo player and around these parts, he's known as Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Why do they call him that?
SUPMALE:Because he never says "yes.
LEADMALE:" No young man is good enough for his daughter.
LEADMALE:He ain't gonna have a chance to tell me no 'cause I ain't gonna ask.
LEADFEMALE:Mimi, if you're not busy on Friday night would you like to accompany me to the Apple Blossom ball? No.
LEADFEMALE:What's your name, boy? What school do you go to? What college are you applying to? What's your career plans? I'm just a sophomore, sir.
OTHERMALE:I don't really know yet.
SUPFEMALE:Out of here, son.
OTHERMALE:You disgust me.
LEADMALE:So, what kind of guy does Dr.
LEADMALE:No say yes to? Fellas with good grades, good manners, good looks.
SUPMALE:In a word, me.
OTHERFEMALE:So why haven't you made your move on Miss Mimi? Not my type.
LEADFEMALE:Doesn't tickle my fancy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she can tickle mine.
SUPMALE:If only wishing made it so.
SUPMALE:Let's face it, Will.
LEADFEMALE:You lack the social graces to impress someone like Dr.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, you must be on dog food.
LEADFEMALE:I am the most handsome, the most intelligent and unequivocally the most flamboyant bachelor since Billy Dee.
LEADMALE:This isn't West Philly, Will.
SUPMALE:It's Bel-Air.
LEADFEMALE:And the women here are different.
LEADMALE:I guarantee you Dr.
SUPMALE:No will say no.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? I bet he won't.
LEADMALE:I bet he will.
LEADFEMALE:I bet he won't.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet he will.
LEADFEMALE:Who says the art of conversation is dead? All right, Will.
LEADMALE:You think you can be a gentleman? How do you propose on going about it? Carlton, it's very easy to be a geek.
LEADMALE:All I have to do is follow you around for a day.
OTHERFEMALE:It isn't as easy as it looks.
LEADFEMALE:And with your father's permission I'd love to escort you to the Apple Blossom ball.
LEADMALE:I had no idea you two were getting along so well.
LEADMALE:What's going on here, Carlton? Will's got a thing for Mimi Mumford so I'm teaching him how to be a perfect gentleman.
SUPMALE:I want a piece of this.
OTHERFEMALE:Observe, Will, this is how a perfect gentleman talks to a young lady.
LEADFEMALE:"Say there, Mimi "might I say that you rate a perfect 10 on my niftiness meter?" I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, how did you used to crack on the girlies? What I'm about to tell you is going to change your life forever.
LEADFEMALE:Are you listening?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:First, I take her hand then I stroke it gently but imperceptibly Iook deep into her eyes, blow gently in her ear let my mouth curl up into a smile make a low, rumbling, hypnotic sound.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, that's what you did on our first date.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:You're lucky you got a second one.
SUPMALE:Allow me, sir.
OTHERMALE:Certainly, Geoffrey, if you think you can do any better.
LEADFEMALE:Mademoiselle.
LEADMALE:My life was but a mere whisper until you entered into it.
SUPMALE:Whether it was chance or blind fate or kismet, if you will, that brought us together I would be remiss to let this moment pass without telling you how deeply you have affected the very core of my being.
LEADFEMALE:Baby!
LEADFEMALE:The fish knife.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:No, it is right.
OTHERMALE:He got it right.
LEADMALE:He got it right!
OTHERMALE:He did? Get your own geisha.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, Master Carlton.
SUPMALE:You were saying?
LEADMALE:Will, he picked out the fish knife.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I want you to pay very close attention.
LEADMALE:Which one is the shrimp fork? By george, I think he's got it.
LEADMALE:I think he's got it.
SUPMALE:Where did he get that jacket? Probably off the rack.
LEADMALE:Did you hear about his Jaguar?
LEADFEMALE:The one he bought secondhand? Okay, just remember you're from Connecticut you're transferred to Bel-Air Academy, and you row on the crew team.
LEADMALE:Now, where did you transfer from? Bend over.
LEADFEMALE:It's Andover.
LEADFEMALE:We're going back home.
LEADFEMALE:I was joking, man.
SUPMALE:Relax.
OTHERFEMALE:Hook it up.
OTHERMALE:I beg your pardon, Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Mumford.
SUPMALE:I have a friend who's new in town.
LEADMALE:He's the new star on the crew team.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to meet him? No.
LEADMALE:I respect your wishes, sir but I'd just like to say kudos on that polo match.
LEADMALE:Super form.
SUPMALE:You saw it, huh? Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I didn't get your name.
LEADMALE:Smithers, sir.

LEADFEMALE:Thoracic surgery.
LEADMALE:That's my field.
SUPFEMALE:What aspect of it interests you the most? The cutting part.
OTHERMALE:That's the part I like, too.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm glad you're a fan of polo.
LEADFEMALE:I have a very fine string of Arabians.
LEADMALE:Really? With turbans and everything? Very funny, Smithers.
LEADMALE:You had me there for a moment.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you were a blithering idiot.
LEADMALE:There's my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like to meet her? Gosh, sir.
LEADFEMALE:There's a big question mark on that one.
LEADFEMALE:I seem to be painfully shy with the fairer sex.
SUPFEMALE:Nonsense.

OTHERFEMALE:There is someone I'd like you to meet.
SUPMALE:Mimi, Kip Smithers.
OTHERFEMALE:Varsity crew from Bel-Air.

LEADMALE:I'll just leave the two of you alone.
LEADMALE:Mimi
LEADFEMALE:Look, before you get yourself all worked up into a lather, I just would like to say this.
LEADMALE:I am sick of you white-washed, preppy stuffed shirts.
OTHERMALE:What? I don't need some stooge who's going to play up to my father.
SUPFEMALE:I want a real man.
SUPFEMALE:Someone dangerous.
LEADMALE:Someone exciting.
SUPMALE:Someone from the streets.
SUPFEMALE:What's so funny?
LEADFEMALE:Yo, baby.
LEADMALE:Your prince is in effect, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not down with this preppy nonsense.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton told me to do this.
LEADMALE:I'm definitely straight out the 'hood.
SUPMALE:That was the worst homeboy act I've ever heard.
LEADFEMALE:It's not an act.
SUPFEMALE:It's the real deal.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, C! Come here! Mimi.
OTHERMALE:Kip.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, would you please tell her who I really am?
SUPMALE:Who you really are?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:He's Kip Smithers, from Connecticut.
LEADMALE:He transferred from Andover to Bel-Air, so he could row with the crew.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Tell her where I'm really from.
OTHERMALE:England? For future reference, Will, our club frowns on strangulation.
LEADFEMALE:This is all your fault.
LEADFEMALE:You got me into this mess.
LEADFEMALE:Me.
LEADMALE:Yeah! This preppy nonsense.
SUPFEMALE:I knew women didn't like that mess.
LEADFEMALE:If I would've had my way, I would've had my way.
OTHERFEMALE:Congratulate me.
LEADMALE:It took all day but I finally found the perfect pair of alligator pumps to wear to the Save the Everglades rally tonight.
LEADMALE:Will has a crush on Mimi Mumford.
LEADMALE:That fat girl? Mimi is not fat.
LEADFEMALE:Not today.
SUPMALE:Liposuction.
LEADFEMALE:She's been vacuumed more times than a hooked rug.
LEADFEMALE:She looks good now, right? I don't see your point.
OTHERMALE:Just wave a chili-cheese dog in front of her nose and see how much of your arm you come back with.
LEADMALE:Will.
OTHERMALE:So, how did it go with Mimi Mumford? He struck out.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Will, you've taken advice from Carlton, from Philip, and Geoffrey but you have not gone to the most logical 
LEADFEMALE:the woman of the house.
LEADMALE:Before I was married, I had my share of admirers.
LEADMALE:A sorrier bunch of deadbeats you'll never meet.
LEADMALE:The ones that I was most attracted to were the ones who were secure enough to just be themselves.
LEADFEMALE:And that's my advice to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Just be yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:So, Will, are you going to take Mom's advice? Man, you got to be crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Mimi wants a street-wise, Harley, bad-to-the-bones type guy, man.
SUPMALE:If I could show her that I'm dangerous, I'll have her like that.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll bet you wouldn't.
LEADMALE:I bet I would.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet you wouldn't.
SUPFEMALE:I bet you wouldn't.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you would.
SUPFEMALE:See, I fooled you.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, I'm wanted in five states I'm hiding out from the police for robbing a gun store
SUPMALE:and what did I do before then?
LEADMALE:You went to Penn State.
SUPFEMALE:I went to the state pen.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought Penn State was bad enough.
SUPFEMALE:Mimi, top of the evening.
SUPMALE:Carlton, for the 900th time, no, I will not go out with you.
LEADMALE:I thought you said she wasn't your type.
SUPFEMALE:She isn't.
LEADMALE:She's too negative.
SUPMALE:I'm not here for that.
OTHERFEMALE:Although if you just gave it some objective thought Anyway, I'm here for him.
OTHERMALE:Does he need to go to the bathroom? No, he's just being his bad self.
SUPMALE:What you saw before was just a charade.
LEADMALE:Kip is his street name.
LEADMALE:K-l-P.
LEADFEMALE:It stands for conceived in prison.
SUPMALE:He's my cousin and he's from the Bedford-Stuyvesant region of Brooklyn wherein he is a felon.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Then what's he doing here in Bel-Air? He's living with us to escape, and I quote, "the man.
LEADMALE:" Voila.
LEADMALE:I thought you said he rode crew.
LEADFEMALE:No, baby.
LEADMALE:You misunderstood.
SUPFEMALE:He said I wrote for the 2 Live Crew.
SUPMALE:But, see, they kicked me out because my lyrics was too abrasive.
SUPMALE:He's as nasty as he wants to be.
LEADFEMALE:I kid you not.
LEADFEMALE:Baby.
SUPFEMALE:You look so good I wish I could plant you and grow a whole field of y'all.
LEADMALE:Yo, baby, Fresh Prince in full effect.
LEADMALE:It's time to get busy.
LEADMALE:You can't hay, can you, baby? You work on that, all right, baby? Salutations, Doctor.
SUPFEMALE:This is quite an intense shindig, huh? Listen, I just want to find out how things are going with Mimi.
SUPFEMALE:I'm having a little trouble breaking the proverbial ice, sir.
LEADMALE:I hope I don't embarrass myself, being in your illustrious presence and all.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'll just make myself scarce but, I do have one piece of advice.
LEADFEMALE:Be yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a natch, sir.
LEADFEMALE:This music is def, exceptionally def.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, beat it! I'm dope.
SUPMALE:Yo.
SUPMALE:What were you talking to my father about? I told him if he don't stay out my face, we would take it to the street.
SUPFEMALE:Baby, you close your eyes when you dance with me.
SUPMALE:Salutations yet again, Doctor.
SUPMALE:Just a thought.
SUPMALE:Mimi loves horses and you love polo I thought that might break the ice.
SUPMALE:Thanks for the prescription, Doc.
LEADFEMALE:Enough said.
LEADMALE:What were you talking to my father about this time? I wasn't listening to him, baby.
LEADMALE:I was stealing his wallet.
LEADFEMALE:Kip, I'm so sorry I didn't believe you before.
SUPFEMALE:I should have seen right through that thin charade.
SUPMALE:Let's go someplace and get busy.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:But first, I want you to rap for me.
SUPFEMALE:What? You know, let me hear some of them abrasive lyrics.
SUPMALE:Okay, baby.
SUPFEMALE:This one I got banned in Buffalo for.
LEADFEMALE:And that is just the type of music we will not let our children listen to.
SUPFEMALE:Smithers, what is the meaning of that ridiculous hat? Who put this on my head? Daddy, isn't he funny? No.
SUPMALE:He disgusts me.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of my sight.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:You can't talk to him like that, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:He's practically a convicted killer, and I love him.
LEADFEMALE:A convicted killer? Who are you? All right, look.
SUPMALE:I'm not a young republican from Connecticut and I'm not a hood from Bed-Stuy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Will Smith from West Philly and I've been busting my butt all night trying to impress you and trying to scare you.
OTHERMALE:And I'm exhausted.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going home, and I'm going to sleep 'cause, baby, ain't no girl that fly for me to go through all this trouble for.
LEADMALE:Yo, baby.
SUPMALE:What's up? Miss Hilary.
SUPMALE:Did you have a good time at the Save the Everglades fund raiser? Geoffrey, these events are not about having a good time.
SUPMALE:They're consciousness-raising experiences.
LEADFEMALE:When you hear about all of the species that are on the brink of extinction it's grim, grave, and very sobering.
LEADMALE:Tom Cruise was near tears.
LEADFEMALE:Wasn't he gorgeous? So there I was, G, then this real fly honey walked by, right? So I decided I'll just be myself.
SUPFEMALE:I said, "Yo, baby.
SUPFEMALE:" And she loved me!
SUPFEMALE:Then what happened?
LEADMALE:Well, then her husband came in.
LEADMALE:
