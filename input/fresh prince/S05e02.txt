LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to do the best thing I could for Ashley.
LEADMALE:You can push me out and take everything over but we both know I made Ashley Banks.
SUPFEMALE:Well, gee, I could have sworn that Vivian and I had something to do with it.

SUPMALE:These new managers are putting pressure on her and she's doing the best she can with it.
LEADFEMALE:They must be doing something right.
LEADMALE:She is in heavy rotation on The Box, heh, heh whatever that is.
OTHERMALE:I'm glad you're okay with this because I don't like it.
SUPFEMALE:Not one little bit.
OTHERMALE:Gee, she hides it so well.
LEADMALE:Hey, yo, man, is Ashley really that bad? I'm afraid so, Master William.
SUPMALE:Perhaps later on we could pour some water on her and watch her melt.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, do you hear that? You mean your song on the radio? No, I mean the cash registers racking up my record sales.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't she funny? Don't just stand there, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Call him a good boy and toss him a treat.
SUPMALE:Will, don't be mad.
OTHERMALE:I'm thanking you on my album cover.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? So thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:What the hell is my problem? There she is, America's sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Watch the hair! I have some very exciting news for you.
LEADMALE:Make it quick.
LEADFEMALE:Miss Banks has to mentally prepare for her appearance tomorrow at Dad's record store.
LEADMALE:I have the greatest idea for my talk show.
LEADFEMALE:It's a salute to divas.
LEADFEMALE:Past, present and future.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, that is my idea.
LEADMALE:Right, just like you launched Ashley's career? So how about it, Ash? Hilary, it sounds really wonderful and I'd love to do it but, well, my managers have this silly little idea about me only doing important shows.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so, what you doing, 60 Minutes? So young, so bitter.
LEADMALE:Carlton! Oh, she is so self-centered.
LEADFEMALE:I hear that.
OTHERMALE:After everything I've done for her.
OTHERMALE:You? Who's talking about you? Well, I'm talking about Miss Thing.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody need to snatch her big helium head down out the stratosphere.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, I need to talk to Queen Sheba.
SUPFEMALE:Alone.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I never wanted to fire you.
OTHERMALE:Really?
SUPMALE:Of course not.
LEADMALE:I would have been happy paying you a token salary while someone else did the real work.
LEADMALE:I discovered you.
SUPFEMALE:And don't think I'm not grateful but it's time for me to take my career to the next plateau.
LEADFEMALE:And, face it, you're small potatoes.
LEADMALE:Small potatoes? I'll show you how small my potatoes are.
SUPMALE:Carlton! Sorry, no.
LEADMALE:Next.
LEADMALE:Sorry, too tall.
OTHERMALE:You're a little too big-boned.
LEADFEMALE:Well, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Get a tan.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Would you think? Hey, Will, look what I found.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, she looks just like Ashley.
LEADMALE:The resemblance, much like the beat, goes on.
SUPMALE:Sing something, honey.
LEADMALE:Although I'm crazy about ya I can live without ya And you wasted my time  Jazz, she's great.
LEADMALE:I'm back! You? Get your own client.
LEADMALE:This one's mine.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Bashley.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? Doesn't Ashley got some boots that need licking? Well, she found out I was skimming money off the top, so she fired me.
LEADMALE:Her own brother.
LEADFEMALE:Face it, man, family means nothing to Ashley no more.
LEADFEMALE:Look what she did to me.
SUPMALE:Well, at least you still have your 15 percent.
LEADFEMALE:All I got was a promise she wouldn't press charges.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, wait, wait, wait.
SUPMALE:Whoa.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? I don't have no 15 percent.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, you had an oral agreement with Ashley.
LEADMALE:That's legally binding.
SUPMALE:Just ask Kim Basinger.
OTHERMALE:You're right, man, I didn't even think about that.
OTHERMALE:Thanks a lot, C.
SUPFEMALE:I think I'll slide down to this record store and give the good news to Little Miss Fat Head.
OTHERMALE:Where are all the people? Philip, I don't know, but you've gotta do something.
LEADMALE:She's been sitting there for hours.
LEADMALE:Hey, kid, how'd you like to have your own personal CD of "Make Up Your Mind"? Man, that song is weak.
OTHERFEMALE:Last week.
SUPMALE:I thought you said it was gonna be a hit.
LEADMALE:It was.
SUPFEMALE:We had such positive feedback that we threw extra promotional muscle behind it saturated our key demo playlist and topped out.
LEADFEMALE:What does that mean?
LEADMALE:The kids got sick of her.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what's up, y'all? How you doing? Man, let's see, I guess I'll get one of these.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Nas in the house.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Partners In Rhyme.
OTHERFEMALE:I love that CD.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Oh, I just want my piece of the pie.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, seeing as how Ashley and I have a legally binding oral agreement which guarantees my 15 percent.
LEADMALE: I guess you got me there.
LEADMALE:So tell me something.
LEADMALE:How much is 15 percent of nothing? It's Okay, 15.
LEADMALE:Hold up, 15, carry the zero.
LEADMALE:Fifteen Nothing, you math whiz.
SUPMALE:Fifteen percent of nothing is nothing.
LEADFEMALE:All right, what are you talking about? 
OTHERMALE:Well, evidently Ashley is not gonna be as big a star as they thought she was going to be.
OTHERFEMALE:And I can't say that I'm not happy about it.
SUPMALE:Me either.
LEADMALE:Well, it's nice to know my family was rooting for me to fail.
LEADMALE:Ashley, that is not at all what we Ashley.
OTHERMALE:This is all your fault, Will.
LEADMALE:This is all your fault, Will.
LEADMALE:ASHLEY 
SUPMALE:Tell me why you're playing with my mind, boy Hey, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you mind signing my CD? Very funny.
SUPMALE:No, come on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm being serious.
LEADMALE:One day you're gonna be famous in something and a signed CD is gonna be worth some real dough.
LEADMALE:Or if not, we can use it to prop up an unlevel table.
LEADMALE:You know, so it don't wobble.
LEADFEMALE:Is that a smile?
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Why are you being so nice to me? I was such a jerk.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you learned from the master.
