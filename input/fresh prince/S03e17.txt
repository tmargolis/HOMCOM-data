LEADMALE:Really? Maybe you'd like to go upstairs and I could do my stand-up.
SUPMALE:Now, why waste time going upstairs? See, this way whenever you pass the couch, you'll think of me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I could get some memories of you in the kitchen and the Jacuzzi, too.

LEADMALE:Mama knows, child.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, what you doing? Will, I can't do this.
OTHERMALE:I better go.

SUPFEMALE:Baby, some things just ain't that easy to stop.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, and it isn't that easy for me either but, Will, I want you.
SUPFEMALE:But I guess deep down inside I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
LEADMALE:I want to be married before I go all the way.
LEADMALE:You understand, don't you? Look, Monique, I'd love to talk, but there ain't no blood in my brain.
LEADMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:It's only 7:00.

SUPFEMALE:You never want to go for a ride in a car without your seat belt.
OTHERMALE:And use your brakes.
SUPMALE:Don't floor it because then you throw a rod, you flood your carburetor, you crack your block.
LEADFEMALE:You understand what I'm saying? No, man.

SUPFEMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil, this is the '90s, man.
LEADFEMALE:Take a cold shower.
SUPFEMALE:I've been doing that since the '80s.

LEADMALE:You know, my child, I've never known the pleasures of the flesh but I could be convinced to give up Excuse me, Father, could I rap to you for a second.
SUPMALE:Don't go away baby.
LEADFEMALE:Bartender, another Olde English for the lady.
LEADMALE:It's a fashion risk, but I like it.
OTHERMALE:Jazz, sit down.
LEADMALE:Look, I can't believe I let you talk me into this, man.
SUPMALE:I feel awful.
LEADFEMALE:Will, a naked, willing female is in your room.
LEADMALE:Stop me when I get to the awful part.
LEADMALE:I don't have a right to treat her like this, man.
LEADMALE:She's a human being.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's enough.
LEADFEMALE:Now, get a bottle of whiskey, liquor that girl up and take advantage of her.
SUPMALE:Be a man for God's sake.
SUPMALE:Jazz, I'm sorry, man, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to tell her the truth.
LEADMALE:Maybe you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps we've both been a little remiss in our treatment of women.
OTHERMALE:You think? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:You inspire me, Prince.
SUPFEMALE:From now on I, too, will be completely honest in my dealings with the fair sex.
SUPFEMALE:My man.
LEADMALE:You know, my child, I've never known the pleasures of the flesh but I could be convinced to give up the priesthood for you.
LEADMALE:Honey, where have you Monique, this is going to be hard enough as it is so please just let me do the talking.
LEADMALE:I know you respect honesty in a man, so I'm going to be honest.
OTHERFEMALE:Monique, I just wanted to get you into bed so I tricked you.
LEADMALE:The whole ceremony was a fake and we're not really married.
SUPMALE:Monique, look, I'm sorry and I know what I did was wrong.
LEADMALE:And, Monique, I really care about you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Monique the room is paid for and everything, so why don't, you know I was just hoping that maybe since So, could you just come get me, Uncle Phil? Your Mercedes? Oh, well, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:See, actually, yeah.
LEADMALE:I did borrow it.
LEADMALE:Well, but, you know, it's not here right now.
LEADMALE:Well, to be honest, my wife took it.
LEADFEMALE:All I could overhear were the words Mercedes, wife, and Monique and then Dad ran out of the house.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think it's obvious what happened.
SUPMALE:Will and Monique stole a Mercedes, and ran over somebody's wife.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, that's ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:Obviously, Will has been seeing a woman named Mercedes, Monique found out and I'm still working on the wife part.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think Will married Monique just to get her into bed and when she found out, she got so mad she took off in Dad's Mercedes.
SUPMALE:Get real! I still can't believe that you could do something so despicable.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, marrying Monique just to get her in bed? Even I don't believe it.
SUPMALE:I can't imagine what kind of excuse you could come up with.
LEADMALE:Do you have anything to say in your own defense? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:It's shameful, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, here you are busting your hump trying to impart values and teach basic human decency and I turn around and do some mess like this.
SUPMALE:I just don't get it, Will.
SUPMALE:I mean what is going on in that head of yours? I don't know, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I'm out of control.
OTHERMALE:Please stop me before I disobey again.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you ever stop to think before you do these disgusting things? Of course, I do, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Do you think I like being the way I am? I'm a victim.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a victim of my imagination.
OTHERMALE:Help me.
LEADFEMALE:Well all right, since you put it that way.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to punish you, Will.
LEADMALE:You know, that's radical, Uncle Phil, but it just might work.
LEADMALE:I'm not going to punish you today maybe not even tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I need to think a long, long time about just what I'm going to do with you.
OTHERMALE:I don't know, it might come to me in the middle of the night or maybe next week, or a few years from now.
SUPMALE:In the meantime, why don't you worry about it? Be afraid, Will.
LEADMALE:Be very afraid.
LEADMALE:I've got it.
LEADMALE:Will! I want to put something special on for you.
SUPFEMALE:And I promise it'll be worth the wait.
SUPMALE:Trust me.
OTHERFEMALE:I got that effect on women, you know.
SUPMALE:
