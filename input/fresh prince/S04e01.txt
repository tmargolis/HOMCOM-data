Philip, did you get too close? I don't know, Vivian, is four feet too close? Nicky, honey, Daddy won't hurt you.
What is about me that baby doesn't like? Is it my beard? Because if it is, I'll shave it off right now.
Don't you dare.
I love the way that beard feels.
I'm surprised you remember.
Sweetheart, it hasn't been that long since we've made love, has it? Five months this Tuesday.
Thin walls.
I'm sorry, honey.
I'll make it better, I promise.
I hope so.
There are priests laughing at me.
I'll have my breakfast in the family room, Geoffrey.
I'll get the wheelbarrow, sir.
Morning, Master William.
Hey.
Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil out there grumbling something about getting his tubes tied.
He's bluffing.
D.
J.
Nicky, Nicky, Nicky.
Nick in the house.
Get up.
Oh, man.
Aunt Viv, this kid is sprouting.
Hey, you know, another month, he'll be bigger than Carlton.
I cannot believe that you and Carlton are moving into your own place.
Seems like just yesterday when I was wiping the tears from his eyes.
No, no, that was yesterday.
I told you that boy wasn't ready for Jurassic Park yet.
Will, honey, you and Carlton will look out for each other, won't you? Come on, absolutely, Aunt Viv.
We got each other's back.
Great, great, great.
You two just be careful.
There are a lot of sick, demented perverts out there.
Greetings, all.
Hello, Jazz.
I brought a gift for baby Dicky.
Nicky.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Whatever.
I know it's five months late, but I wanted to find just the right thing.
This is very sweet of you, Jazz.
Thank you.
You know, Ms.
Banks, since you had that baby there's something different about you.
Here, Will.
Thank you, Jazz, very much.
It's a baby pillow.
Isn't it beautiful.
Oh, yeah.
Jazz, this thing says "Wendy Beth" on it.
So? When you buy a wallet, doesn't it have someone else's picture in it first? Jazz, you stole this pillow.
It's the thought that counts.
Hi, Daddy.
Bye, Daddy.
Whoa, precious.
Where you going?
To the mall.
See you.
Hold it.
Sweetheart, come here.
Today is Saturday, baby.
Why don't you and I do something together.
Like what? Like, we could go to the mall.
Daddy, all my friends are at the mall.
Do you know what would happen if I showed up with my father? What? Be banned for life from The Gap? No, Mom.
No, school don't start for another week.
Oh, yeah, the apartment is great.
Yes, it's in a safe neighborhood, Ma.
Oh, check it out.
The candy store actually sells candy.
Yeah, Mom, I know how proud you are of me that I'm going to college.
Come on, don't do this, Mom.
You know how this affects me.
Well, yeah, it's like a dream come true for both of us.
I love you too, Mommy.
Bye-bye.
Kendrick Petroleum up three and an eighth.
What did I tell you? You called it, son.
Vectrocomp Industries down third day in a row.
The merger killed them.
Yeah.
Good thing we got out when we did, huh? I'm gonna miss you, son.
Did you say something, Dad? I don't want you to move out.
Sorry, Dad, I have to go.
No, you don't.
Will says I do.
He says it's time for me to leave the nest, become independent and have sex with girls.
Safe sex, mind you, but lots of it.
Excuse me.
Is this what you've been telling my boy?
What?
That life is one big orgy.
I never said
College is hard work, son.
Followed by a family, which is even more hard work.
And a teenage daughter who doesn't wanna be seen with you in public.
And a wife who won't let you anywhere near her.
And a butler who may be the father of your child.
And a gardener, a gardener
Dad! Dad! Hey, Will.
Will, I can't bear to see him like this.
That's why we moving, so we don't have to.
Well, look at him.
He needs me.
No, I don't.
I don't need either one of you.
There is a silver lining in my dark cloud.
Hilary.
I'm sorry, Hilary Banks? You know, fate works in mysterious ways.
For years, I've been trying to get her to move out of the house and now when I'm gonna be alone, she is my salvation.
So you two, you two go on with your little lives.
My Hilary needs me.
Okay, everybody, guess what.
Okay, I can see you're stumped.
I'm getting married.
To Trevor.
Oh, Hilary.
What is this? Hilary's marrying Trevor.
Oh, come on.
Don't tease me.
Mother, it's true.
When did he propose? This morning, as he was leaving the pool house.
I mean, this morning on the phone.
You certainly ain't wasting no time getting a gown.
Mom and Dad bought this for me when I hit puberty.
One down, three to go.
Oh, Philip, you all right? You look like you're in shock.
Shock? Oh, no, it figures.
Here's the best part.
I asked Trevor to officially propose to me during his Slice of L.
A.
segment on tomorrow's news.
That way, all of Los Angeles can share in our happiness.
Hilary, sweetheart I think there may be a question that you should ask yourself.
I already did.
I'm going to register at Tiffany's.
No, no, sweetheart.
Are you in love with Trevor? What's love got to do with it? I'm having a wedding.
Hey, back off, lke.
We're having a wedding.
Let's go do the invitation list.
Oh, Mommy.
Way to go, sis.
The guy's a prince.
I can't believe she's gonna marry that jerk.
Trevor's not a jerk.
He's a superficial, self-centered, TelePrompTer-reading airhead.
Sounds like a match to me.
My little girl is leaving me.
Are you gonna be all right, big guy? Because I can stay here and help you through this rocky time.
I'll be fine.
We out then.
Bye, Dad.
You take care, man.
So if you take package D, you get basic cable three premiums and the Lust Channel.
Carlton, how you feel about the Lust Channel? I think it's 24 hours of shallow, pointless nudity.
You heard the bird.
We'll take it.
You'll be hooked up tomorrow.
Thank you, Mr.
Smith.
You heard that right.
Mr.
Smith.
This boy's getting some respect around here.
Will, I've met the woman of my dreams.
Word? I didn't know RuPaul lived in L.
A.
See, one of my duties as mascot is to walk around and greet people on campus.
So I'm doing my thing, and this wise guy starts messing with my plumage.
Then she came to my rescue.
Five feet, 11 inches of feminine firepower.
I bet she could toss me around this room.
Hope it works out for you, buddy.
Oh, Will, she's crazy about me.
What makes you think that? Get this, she said she's looking forward to seeing me again.
So?
So no one's ever said that to me except my dentist.
You were right.
We're on our own three hours and my life's already taken a turn for the better.
Well, let freedom ring.
Oh, that's the door.
Hey, Mr.
Gorodetsky.
I thought I said no pets.
I'm not really a peacock.
And I'm not really a slumlord.
Look, if you need to reach me, I'll be at my home number.
You don't live here?
Are you kidding? Oh, yeah.
I hope that's not a long-distance call you're making.
Can I see that first dollar you ever had again?
Oh, sure.
Put it away, you cheapskate.
I'm just calling Jazz, invite a couple of people over.
Christen the new crib.
Is there anyone in particular you'd like to invite? I don't keep friends.
In time of war, they can be tortured and give up valuable secrets about you.
I was talking about your Miss Lady Peacock.
Are you nuts? I'm not bringing her within a hundred yards of you.
What? Carlton, I'm your cousin, man.
The cousin who stole every woman I ever had.
Oh, please, I stole one girl.
My point exactly.
All right, Carlton, I promise you I ain't gonna press up on her.
As far as I'm concerned, she's just a man with breasts.
She does have breasts, doesn't she? Well, all right.
She runs the campus store.
I'll go ask her.
Carlton.
What? Change your clothes.
Geoffrey.
Geoffrey, look.
It's Carlton's first haircut.
Hilary's first day at kindergarten.
Geoffrey.
Geoffrey.
Here's Ashley on a diving board.
The way we were.
You've got to look to the future, sir.
Put the past behind you.
I guess.
You're right.
What's for dinner?
Leftovers.
Hold it, hold it.
Who do we have here?
We met at the mall.
What's your name, son? This.
This is a stick with a snake wrapped around it.
It's a symbol, like Prince.
Prince who? See, that's exactly why fathers ain't allowed at the mall.
What's this thing? It's a symbol for "get out of my house!" Daddy, I love him! Keep it up, sir and I'll be all you have left.
You owe me.
That's Boardwalk with a hotel.
That's 2 grand.
Thank you.
Community Chest.
Yes, and what a lovely community it is.
Coming through, coming through.
Hey, Carl, where you been, man? I was watching the sun set over the Bank of America building.
I think you know everybody Oh, except LaTanya.
Hello.
I'd like to set the record straight before any other woman comes on to me.
I'm in a monogamous relationship.
Really? How long?
It's going on five hours.
I'd appreciate it if you scavengers would refrain from eating this.
I'm saving it for my Jacqueline.
Jacqueline is his imaginary friend.
Hey.
Hey, my brother, can I help you? Yeah, man, this is where the party at? What party, man? The party we paid $25 apiece to go to.
Say, where's En Vogue? Hey, my brother, I think you got the wrong crib, man.
This is apartment 206, right? Well, yeah, man, but it ain't no party.
Read it and weep, man.
"It's the rump-baking, booty-shaking don't miss the mix in apartment 206.
"
This is Jazz's handwriting.
How do you know? All the letters is cut out of magazines.
Hey.
Hey, what's up with you, man? Hey, my brother.
This is a private party, and y'all are going to have to step.
Not without my $25.
Get out or I'll call security.
Not old dude with the flashlight.
He carries a whistle too.
All right, man, we don't want that kind of trouble.
Guess we'll just go home and watch some TV.
Sounds like a good idea, my brother.
Hey.
Hey.
Why don't you just take the pictures off the wall while you're at it.
Good idea.
Go nice with my new TV.
Look, Carlton, if anybody else comes, you take care of it.
I'm going to get our stuff back.
Hey, y'all come back here with our stuff, man.
This should cover your $25.
Oh, the blender's still on warranty.
It looks like your Jacqueline stood you up.
It also looked like Loni and Burt had a good marriage.
Dance with me, you freak.
Maybe if you asked me nicely.
This party's played out.
Oh, tell Will the crib is dope.
Like that's all I got on my mind.
Come on, Jacqueline.
My bedtime's coming soon.
Bird man? Jacqueline.
Wait, I thought there were gonna be other people here.
Well, there were.
They left.
Some with lovely parting gifts.
Maybe I better leave too.
No, don't.
I went and got us some dinner from Chez Paul.
Filet mignon? Thanks, but I don't eat red meat.
I'll give it up too.
No need, bird man.
Jacqueline, how about a dance before you go to christen the new crib.
It'd be my first dance with a brother from Bel-Air.
Better take the opportunity.
There aren't too many of us.
All right.
What is this anyway? Bobby Vinton, the Polish Prince.
Well, I have some Manilow if you prefer.
No, the Polish Prince will do just fine.
It's my Jacqueline.
It's the TV.
Jackie? Oh, my God.
Will.
No, no, no! Go, peacock.
Go, peacock.
Go, peacock
