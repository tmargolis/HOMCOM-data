OTHERMALE:Are you nuts? I'm not bringing her within a hundred yards of you.
LEADFEMALE:What? Carlton, I'm your cousin, man.
SUPMALE:The cousin who stole every woman I ever had.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please, I stole one girl.
SUPFEMALE:My point exactly.
SUPMALE:All right, Carlton, I promise you I ain't gonna press up on her.
