SUPMALE:Well, I'm looking forward to it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, me too.
SUPMALE:Come on, Carlton.
LEADMALE:This is Philadelphia in the springtime.
LEADFEMALE:Man, there's people all over the place.
SUPFEMALE:There's guys playing stickball.
LEADFEMALE:Girls in the street playing double dutch.
LEADFEMALE:No country club reciprocity.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, we'll be gone for about four or five days.
SUPMALE:You know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, sir, the house is in excellent hands.
LEADMALE:Do we have to go? Carlton, your Aunt Vy is dying to show us how she's redecorated her home.
OTHERMALE:God forbid she should send a picture.
SUPFEMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:Come on, kids, let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, all right, let's get it over with.
OTHERMALE:Carlton, would you cool out a little bit, man.
OTHERMALE:What, just because you're not going to some fancy resort somewhere that means you can't have a good time? It is a damn shame when people are spoiled by money.
SUPMALE:G, put some butter on that, bring that out to me in the car.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, y'all come right on in.
LEADMALE:Make yourself at home.
LEADMALE:Oh, there it is, y'all.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, check it out.

LEADFEMALE:Y'all know who you are.
SUPMALE:Don't make me kill you in your mother's home.
LEADMALE:I'm going to check out my bedroom.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what do you guys think? Vy, you have really perked this place up.
LEADFEMALE:Hasn't she, Hilary? Yeah.

LEADMALE:I'm putting both of you right out here on the convertible couch.
LEADMALE:And Ashley and Hilary will be with me.
LEADMALE:Philip and Vivian will have your room.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Mom, listen, you should probably make sure that Uncle Phil sleeps on the bottom bunk.
LEADMALE:Because if he get up on the top bunk Well, you know gravity ain't no joke.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm saying? He could end up in China.
LEADMALE:You know, Vy, we don't wanna be any trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we just make reservations at a hotel and just get out of your hair.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's a great idea.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:There is plenty of room right here.
LEADFEMALE:Yep, yep.
SUPMALE:And I'll take it as a personal insult if you guys leave.
SUPMALE:Yep.
LEADMALE:Yep, yep, yep.
SUPMALE:How about if just I left? That's what I get for being considerate.
LEADFEMALE:Vy, we'd be happy to stay here with you.
OTHERMALE:All of us.
LEADFEMALE:Good, but don't bother unpacking now, because we got to get to the ballpark.
LEADMALE:Teddy Pendergrass is singing the national anthem.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, Phillies in the house! You know, Vy, we're all a little jet-lagged.

SUPFEMALE:They got the kind of food here that sticks to your ribs.
SUPMALE:And your feet.
SUPFEMALE:What do you have to tip the maitre d' to get a good stool? Unless you're here to stick up the joint, sit down and eat.
LEADFEMALE:Take a tip, buddy, you won't get anywhere in the service industry treating customers like that.
LEADMALE:Why don't you take your Bing Crosby butt over to the golden arches and lie down in front of a drive-through window.

LEADMALE:We went for a long walk.
OTHERFEMALE:I love this city.
LEADMALE:Tell her about that scrapple place.
LEADFEMALE:You ate scrapple? That's made from the part of the pig that's not good enough to go in sausage.
LEADMALE:But it's good enough to go in Philip.
SUPMALE:Oh, baby.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, this is all very nice, but where are my groceries? I knew we forgot something.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, I'm supposed to be in England.
LEADMALE:Get some English muffins.

LEADFEMALE:My mama made me move.
OTHERFEMALE:I would never leave Philly! I love it here.
LEADMALE:So do I.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I'm giving back to it.
LEADMALE:I stayed to help the kids in the area so that they wouldn't make the same mistakes I did.
SUPFEMALE:You sound like an after-school special, or something.
LEADMALE:But that ain't gonna do nothing for my rep.
SUPMALE:Let's go right now, and I ain't taking no for an answer.
LEADFEMALE:You have no choice.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, well, you're so stupid, you thought a quarterback was a refund.

LEADMALE:Okay, come on, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Look here, man I know what you're trying to do, but I am not gonna hit you.
LEADFEMALE:Then I'm gonna tell everybody you're a punk, then.
SUPMALE:Be my guest.
LEADFEMALE:What about your rep? Look, you see those guys over there? That's my rep.
LEADFEMALE:Brother, you need to grow up.
OTHERMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:Let me know when you need me.
LEADMALE:Thank you for a lovely time.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.

SUPFEMALE:And here.
LEADMALE:Here's the Phillies schedule.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you can come back when they make it to the World Series.
LEADMALE:I can't do it.
OTHERMALE:No need to get melodramatic, Will.
LEADMALE:Just watch it on TV with the rest of us.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking about going back to Bel-Air.
LEADMALE:I ain't ready to leave yet, y'all.
LEADMALE:I'm still having fun.
LEADFEMALE:Fun? You've been ostracized since you got here.
SUPFEMALE:What you talking about? That Chicken Will thing? That ain't nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Guys be tripping like that all the time.
OTHERMALE:You mean I was in a garbage can for nothing? When were you in a garbage can? Look, I'm just saying, you know I didn't realize how much I miss just sitting out on the stoop.
LEADMALE:Look, when we get back, Dad will buy us a stoop.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, we're gonna miss the plane.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I don't wanna spend another minute in this sardine can.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for everything, Aunt Vy.

SUPMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:Now, go clean up your room.
OTHERFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:What time is Will's plane coming in?
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:He was supposed to call with his flight arrangements but he gets so wrapped up in his own life that he cannot take the time to be a little bit responsible.
SUPFEMALE:That must be him now.
OTHERMALE:Hello?
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Will, are you at the airport? No, I'm at home.
LEADMALE:Well, what happened? You miss your flight? Sort of.
LEADFEMALE:Well, when you coming back, then? I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:
