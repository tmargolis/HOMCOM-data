LEADMALE:Hey, my brother.
LEADMALE:I just came back from the free clinic, and guess what I got? What, man? The phone number of those two nurses we met.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, the twins that sleep in the same bed? With some luck, we can put an end to that streak.
SUPFEMALE:You the man.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, Phillipe, I need you to cover my next shift.

LEADMALE:What do you mean, you're getting married? Her name is Jewel Robertson.
LEADFEMALE:I saw her on Cops, getting busted for grand theft auto.
LEADMALE:Jazz, the woman's a convict? We prefer the term "freedom impaired.
LEADMALE:" How about the term "not playing with a full cell block"? You don't understand, man.
SUPFEMALE:Jewel makes my life complete.
LEADMALE:See, I know you look at me and you say, "Damn, that Jazz has it all.
LEADFEMALE:" But the truth is, behind these shades, there's a big, empty hole.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's for damn sure.
SUPFEMALE:And I was gonna make you my best man.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, really? Your best man? Well, you are my best friend.
SUPMALE:My other friends pretend to like me for my money.
SUPFEMALE:That's because you owe it to them.
LEADMALE:The ceremony's at the Woman's Correctional Institution next Tuesday.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:You're getting married at the prison? Why not.
LEADMALE:It's free.
LEADMALE:We follow an execution.

LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with her face? Sweetheart, it's electronically scrambled.
OTHERFEMALE:Whatever.
SUPMALE:I just hope she's not toying with Jazz's emotions.
LEADMALE:I hate to see a sweet guy like that get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, up till today, you've never had a nice thing to say about Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Up till today, Jazz was available.
LEADMALE:Now that he's getting married well, forbidden fruit always looks more tempting, doesn't it? Mother, for God's sake, he's half your age.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm happy for Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:I think it is so romantic.
SUPMALE:I give it three weeks.
LEADMALE:The marriage or her parole? Yo, whoa, hey, that's not funny.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz is my best friend.
LEADMALE:Was.
LEADFEMALE:Be prepared, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Marriage brings about new priorities.
LEADMALE:You may find Jazz has less time to spend with you once he's taken a wife.
LEADFEMALE:Please, ain't no way Jazz, knowing me, gonna let some honey come between us.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I thought too.
LEADMALE:When I married Vivian, I lost all my friends.
LEADFEMALE:Right, honey? But, you know But it wasn't like I was gonna need them.
LEADMALE:After all, I wasn't gonna have any fun anymore.
SUPMALE:Honey.

LEADMALE:Thank you, baby.
LEADMALE:Hey, well, look, I don't even care.
OTHERFEMALE:Jazz is in love and I'm gonna make sure that he has the best wedding ever.
LEADFEMALE:Even if I got to pay for it myself.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, even though I am just a poor black man trying to get my education.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it, Will.
SUPMALE:I am not shelling out for Jazz's wedding.
SUPMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I seem to remember a rather large relative of mine saying 
SUPFEMALE:"If Jazz would just find some bimbo to get his mind off of Hilary I'd be more than happy to pay for the wedding.
LEADFEMALE:" Well Way to go, Judge Banks.
SUPFEMALE:You pretend to uphold the law but you'll renege on a verbal contract? Well Well, she is a convict.
SUPFEMALE:I could call it a rehabilitation party and write it off.
LEADMALE:Check it out, you're a judge.
LEADMALE:You can perform the ceremony.
SUPFEMALE:Pay yourself 25 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Fifty.
OTHERMALE:Pay yourself 100.
OTHERFEMALE:It's your money.
SUPMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:I finally found the man of my dreams.

SUPMALE:I mean, we are gonna have a convict in the house.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, would you relax, man.
SUPMALE:Can't help myself, Will.
OTHERMALE:Not with Jewel due any minute.
SUPMALE:Oh, is she pregnant too? Of course not.

LEADMALE:Gillespie Liquors.
OTHERMALE:She's here.
SUPFEMALE:She's here.
SUPFEMALE:She's here.
SUPMALE:Carlton.

LEADFEMALE:Well, hi there, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Man.
OTHERFEMALE:You like my dress? Hilary, will you get out of my way? You're blocking my view.

LEADMALE:Munchkin! There's a lot to be said for a woman who's been in prison a long time.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Yo.
LEADFEMALE:Hello in there.
SUPFEMALE:Munchkin, these are the lovely people who have opened their home and their wallet to us.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm Will, the best man.

LEADFEMALE:I love this bony butt.
SUPFEMALE:And it loves you too, my pet.

LEADFEMALE:We are very happy to have you in our home.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, and I guess it's true what they 
SUPFEMALE:Can't buy good taste.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Which one is the desperately stuck-up, self-centered clothes horse? Guilty.
SUPMALE:Now, just a minute, young lady.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:See, the prison therapist says that I should say what's on my mind and not keep too much bottled up, otherwise I'd you know, go out and do something stupid like hotwiring a Lexus.
OTHERMALE:Although it did get me on prime time.
LEADFEMALE:And kept you in the hearts of viewers everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanna say, if you ever hurt him I'll hunt you down like the dog that you are, and kill you.
OTHERMALE:Well, gotta go shop for your present.
LEADMALE:Beautiful and nuts.
LEADFEMALE:You must be very proud.
LEADFEMALE:I guess.
OTHERMALE:Well, hey, look, I've got an idea.
LEADMALE:Jazz, why don't you take Jewel into the kitchen and get her some grub.
LEADMALE:That's if tubby here hasn't eaten it all.
LEADMALE:Come in.
OTHERMALE:Just trying on my wedding dress.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Jewel, I just wanted to come and check to see if there's anything you needed.
LEADFEMALE:You know, a cup of coffee, a blood test.
SUPMALE:Actually, I thought I'd see if you could live up to your title.
LEADMALE:You know, best man.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what did you have in mind?
OTHERMALE:Could you help me with this? It's already zipped up.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I want you to zip it down.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think that's a good idea.
LEADMALE:Listen, my cousin Hilary is right down the hall.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get her.
LEADFEMALE:Quit messing around.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, I gotta take a shower and do my hair.
LEADFEMALE:Now, hurry up.
LEADMALE:You know if somebody was to walk in here right now they might think you was hitting on me.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me, if I was hitting on you, you'd know it.
SUPFEMALE:Really? How? Okay, you made your point.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, you busy? What's on your mind, Will? Jewel kissed me.
SUPFEMALE:It's customary to kiss the bride.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, this was like one of them Fatal Attraction elevator-scene kisses.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? You know? Oh, come on, you're exaggerating, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Uncle Phil, I'm telling you.
SUPMALE:I went up to the room to see if she needed anything.
SUPFEMALE:She kissed me on my lips.
OTHERMALE:She jumped on me and she was stuck on me.
LEADMALE:And I was trying to shake her off, but I couldn't.
LEADFEMALE:She was like a little naked Velcro midget.
LEADMALE:What am I gonna do, Uncle Phil? Guess you've only got two choices.
LEADFEMALE:You can either tell Jazz or not.
LEADMALE:And you're a judge, right? Look, maybe this story will help you.
LEADMALE:You know, when I was younger, I was a pretty sexy guy.
LEADFEMALE:If you're not gonna take this seriously, Uncle Phil Do you wanna hear this story? Okay.
OTHERMALE:I was driving home from a party with my buddy and his girlfriend and my buddy fell asleep.
OTHERMALE:Next thing I know, she leans across and fastens my seat belt.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? Please don't do that, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I figured that our friendship was strong enough to stand the truth.
LEADFEMALE:So we went out for a beer and I told him everything.
SUPFEMALE:Well, did he thank you? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:With a bar stool, on the head.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I mean, Jazz ain't the violent type I don't think.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the point is, to be a good friend, you have to risk losing a good friend.
LEADMALE:I think I know what I gotta do.
LEADMALE:What's that? I gotta find somebody else to talk to about this.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:How's it going, man? How's it going? This is the best day of my life.
LEADMALE:Did I thank you for everything you've done? Well, not everything.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you two will be close.
LEADFEMALE:She touched me, Will.
OTHERMALE:And I know she'll touch you too.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, actually, Jazz, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
OTHERMALE:See, listen, last night

LEADFEMALE:What decision?
SUPMALE:The one we made last night.

LEADMALE:I kissed you for nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, damn.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I've never met anybody who cares for me as much as Jazz does.

LEADFEMALE:If it was on the first roll.
SUPMALE:But if it was on the second roll, and the point was six, you'd be a six.
LEADMALE:No, actually, you'd be a nine.
LEADMALE:I'd play the field on the second roll, make a couple of extra bucks.
