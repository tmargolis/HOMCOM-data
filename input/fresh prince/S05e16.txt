SUPFEMALE:Thank you, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man, this week has been hell.
LEADFEMALE:Remind me to never get shot again.
OTHERFEMALE:It's always hard the first time.
SUPFEMALE:I remember mine.
LEADFEMALE:I'd forgotten how much Jewel hates anchovies on her pizza.
LEADMALE:Well, the rest you can guess.
OTHERMALE:Good morning, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, Lisa.
OTHERMALE:Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my goodness, Nurse Avner, you might wanna hurry up and go change.
SUPMALE:Nurse Sigmund has on the exact same outfit.
LEADMALE: Will, I have a special going-away present for you.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, I'm on such a natural high from getting up out of here I'm sure my arm won't feel a thing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I think that's a safe bet.
SUPFEMALE:Woo.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE: Have a nice day.
LEADMALE:Check it out, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the black dude on ER.
LEADMALE:Jazz, that is not a toy.
SUPMALE:It doesn't have to be a toy to be fun.
LEADFEMALE:Check this out.
OTHERMALE:Clear.
LEADFEMALE:  Remember, just because you're going home, doesn't mean you can slack off.
LEADMALE:The harder you work, the faster you'll regain use of your leg.
SUPFEMALE:You think I'll ever be able to slam-dunk?
LEADMALE:Sure you will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, cool, because I never could before.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you in therapy tomorrow.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, baby, I packed your books and your Walkman.
SUPMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:And this cute little backless gown that you just looked so good in.
SUPMALE:
OTHERMALE:Is there anything else I can get?
LEADFEMALE:Uh, just my stuff in the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:And don't forget my Magic Shave, baby.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Tss.
OTHERFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Will, you fell?
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I fell, unh in love with you, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Lisa, will you marry me? Marry you? Will, did you take another one of those yellow pills? I'm serious, Lisa.
LEADMALE:I mean, you've been right here with me all through this thing.
LEADMALE:The first face I saw every morning, the last face I saw every night.
LEADFEMALE:I just want that to go on forever.
SUPMALE:Will, I don't know what to say.
LEADMALE:Your face says it all, baby.
LEADMALE:Hey, listen, we should probably Ah.
LEADFEMALE:We should probably keep this thing a secret, just spring it on people at the right time.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's gonna blow them away.
SUPMALE:It sure is.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh, babe, I'm sorry I don't have a ring for you.
LEADMALE:I can give you this one around my collar.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Ready to go?
LEADMALE:Oh, well, Hil, where's everybody else at?
LEADFEMALE:Well, they're all at home.
SUPMALE:It's just me.
SUPFEMALE:WILL & 
SUPFEMALE:Don't touch that! Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Hil, on my big day, I thought that everybody would be here.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's not their fault.
LEADFEMALE:They're setting up for your surprise party.
SUPFEMALE:They're giving me a surprise party? Well, now that you dragged it out of me.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Well, come on, y'all, let's go.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:Let me practice.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God, wait, babe, hold up.
SUPFEMALE:Um, I forgot to sign those release papers.
LEADMALE:Hil, could you buzz the nurse for me, please? 
SUPMALE:No, not that one.
OTHERFEMALE:There has got to be an easier way to call the nurse.
LEADFEMALE: Honey, honey, I don't think what you're doing is good for you.
LEADMALE:And I don't think what you're doing is good for anybody.
LEADMALE: 
SUPMALE:Psht.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Babe, listen.
SUPMALE:Ahem.
LEADFEMALE:May I have everyone's attention, please? You are not gonna announce it in front of all these people.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, baby, don't be shy.
LEADMALE:Here, take this, take this.
LEADFEMALE:Now, as you all know there's a person in this room who's very, very special to me.
SUPFEMALE:A person who's warm, caring and extremely sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I love you too, Will.
LEADMALE:Go sit down.
LEADMALE: Oh, all right, there's two very special people to me.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, as I was about to say, I have a little announcement to make.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I don't think that
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you're right, baby.
SUPMALE:We have an announcement to make.
LEADMALE:Me and Lisa are getting married.
LEADFEMALE:  What?
LEADFEMALE:Will, that's great.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks, Ash.
SUPMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this precludes any possibility of us getting together.
OTHERFEMALE:To do what? Good seeing you again, Lisa.
OTHERMALE:Well, ha, ha that's really news.
LEADFEMALE: Since you're gonna get married maybe you and I should have that man-to-man talk in the kitchen, huh?
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Right now, Uncle Phil?
SUPFEMALE:Sure, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil
SUPMALE:Congratulations, Lisa.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Lisa, I want you to know that Will's as proud of you as I am of my sweet little bride, Jewel.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Jazz, that's nice.
SUPMALE:Um, by the way, where is Jewel? Her ex-cellmate broke out.
LEADFEMALE:They're having dinner.
LEADMALE:Will, what is all this? It's too soon for you to get married.
LEADMALE:Hilary's right.
LEADMALE:Did I say that? I mean, come on, I'm still decorating my new house.
LEADMALE:When would I have time to buy you a gift?  Isn't anybody gonna congratulate me? Yeah, yeah, come here.
OTHERFEMALE:My foot wants to congratulate your butt.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, no way are you ready for marriage.
LEADFEMALE:How are you gonna support a wife? Now, now, Vy, I'm sure the boy has a very sound financial plan in mind.
SUPMALE:That's right, you tell her.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, he is working full time at the college.
LEADFEMALE:It's part time, Uncle Phil, just part time.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's okay.
SUPMALE:I mean, you have that great hourly wage.
SUPFEMALE:Not to mention my tips.
SUPMALE:That's right, that's right Well, now, just what exactly is 15 percent of a frozen burrito? Oh, never mind.
SUPFEMALE:That's okay.
SUPFEMALE:Once you graduate and you start your career Um, what is it that you're majoring in, now? See, I haven't exactly declared my major yet, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You're not giving good examples right now either.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Aha.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:I see what you're doing.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I watch The Cosby Show too, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:This is that episode where Theo drops out of school, right? Well, yeah, something like that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, a couple more Pudding Pops, you'll be there.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, you are not getting married, and that is it.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mom, I understand that this was a bit of a shock for you guys.
OTHERMALE:But you don't have to worry about me and Lisa.
LEADMALE:We're gonna be all right.
LEADMALE:You know why? Because we got love.
SUPFEMALE:What's love got to do with it? GEOFFREY 
LEADMALE:Got to do with it, got to do with it Look, I really, really appreciate you guys' concern but I'm a grown man.
LEADMALE:And with all due respect, if I needed your permission to get married I would've asked for it.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:What's the matter?
SUPMALE:Nothing.
SUPMALE:Come on, babe.
SUPMALE:Hil, run us past Lisa's house, please.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Mrs.
LEADMALE:Banks said I could take this home.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, you don't.
LEADMALE:I'm serving that tonight.
OTHERMALE:No, you're not.
LEADMALE:Yes, I am.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're not.
LEADMALE:Yes, I am.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
LEADMALE:Yes, I am.
LEADMALE:Guys, stop it! Jazz, let go.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am!  I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm okay.
SUPMALE:Um Maybe we can run by X-ray on the way to Lisa's?
SUPMALE:Thanks, for a really nice party.
SUPMALE:Could I speak to you for a second? I know Will has probably told you we have some concerns about you getting married.
LEADFEMALE:You do too?
OTHERFEMALE:What you talking about, Lisa? Mr.
SUPMALE:Banks, it's not that I don't love Will.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that all of this is happening so fast.
SUPFEMALE:And I never really said I would marry him.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, I never said I wouldn't either.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you two should talk.
OTHERFEMALE:And soon.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't want to devastate him with all that's been going on.
SUPFEMALE:Have you ever crushed anyone?
OTHERMALE:Well   Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Before we wrap up, let's test your reflexes.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! My goodness, those doctors must have crossed some wires in there.
SUPFEMALE:Quit messing around, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, there she come.
SUPFEMALE:There she come.
SUPMALE:What's up, baby? 
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey, tell her how good I've been doing.
SUPFEMALE:Tell her how good.
LEADFEMALE:He's doing great, and you must be the reason.
LEADFEMALE:He can't stop talking about you.
LEADMALE:See you tomorrow, Will.
LEADMALE:All right, bye.
SUPFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, baby, I got a little surprise for you.
LEADFEMALE:Unh.
LEADMALE:Um, Will, I kind of got a little surprise for you too.
OTHERMALE:
OTHERMALE:No, no, no, me first.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.
SUPMALE:Unh.
OTHERFEMALE: Just get away from me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mama, look, I can walk.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Oh, I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, girl, I got me some motivation.
OTHERMALE:If I wasn't walking down that aisle with you I'd probably still be upstairs in that wheelchair.
SUPMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Oh, what was your surprise? Um Will, I don't really know how to say this, but I don't wanna get Don't wanna get what? A ticket.
LEADFEMALE:I'm double-parked outside.
LEADMALE:Whoa, whoa, hold up, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, come on, come on.
LEADMALE:That ain't what you wanted to say.
OTHERMALE:Look, there is nothing that you can't tell the man that you're gonna marry.
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna marry you.
LEADFEMALE:See? It wasn't that hard, was it?  
SUPMALE:You're thinking of Lisa again, aren't you?
LEADMALE:Pfft.
SUPMALE:Lisa who? Girl, what you talking about? I'm playing Scrabble.
LEADMALE:D- U-M-P-E-D.
LEADMALE:"Dumped.
SUPMALE:" And you also made "lonely," "shocked" and "pathetic.
LEADMALE:" No, no, no, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:That's mine.
SUPMALE:I'm "pathetic.
SUPFEMALE:" Yeah, you're right, Ash.
SUPMALE:Look, I can't concentrate.
SUPMALE:Maybe we should do something else.
LEADFEMALE:Let's watch some TV.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, I think Montel is on.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Next on Montel Williams Women Who Won't Marry and the Losers Who Ask Them.
LEADFEMALE:Give me that.
SUPMALE:MAN 
LEADFEMALE:Yes, folks, at Willie's World of Wheels we lease every kind of transportation imaginable.
LEADMALE:Lease a truck, lease a car, lease a van, lease a bus, lease a tractor.
LEADMALE:G, to the kitchen, please.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Rain Man.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey, babe.
SUPMALE:Are you hungry, baby? 
LEADFEMALE:Not especially.
SUPMALE:You've got to eat something.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, just give me the same thing Uncle Phil has.
LEADFEMALE:Just make mine a single-sized serving.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, thanks a lot, Aunt Viv.
OTHERMALE:Oh, can you cut up my chicken finger for me, please? Of course, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, my biscuit needs some butter.
LEADFEMALE:Then I suggest you butter it.
SUPMALE:My God, man, I'm in a wheelchair.
OTHERFEMALE:I've noticed.
LEADFEMALE:I've noticed a lot of things lately like you moping around here, acting all helpless.
SUPFEMALE:You can do some things for yourself, you know.
LEADMALE:Sir, when you're finished eating, I've pre-pasted your toothbrush upstairs.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:You should be happy, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:You didn't want me to get married and now I'm not.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, we know you're upset about Lisa.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you know what? I just wanna forget that she ever existed.
LEADMALE:I never even wanna hear her name again.
SUPFEMALE:Which reminds me.
LEADFEMALE:Lisa called.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Will, it's time to go to therapy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going anywhere with you.
OTHERMALE:Every time I get around you, I wind up getting hurt.
SUPFEMALE:You are so accident-prone.
LEADMALE:Will, I am really disappointed in you.
LEADMALE: Please, not another lecture.
SUPFEMALE:Well, someone has to say it.
LEADMALE:Being in a wheelchair is no excuse for wearing the same shirt two days in a row.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary.
LEADMALE:Look, you don't know what it's like to lose a fiancée.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? I was engaged last year, remember?
SUPMALE:Bungee accident?
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, Hil.
LEADMALE:You would think hitting the concrete like that would've made more of an impact.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Will, we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
OTHERFEMALE:But we never even would've been engaged if he hadn't been so persistent.
OTHERMALE:God, I must have turned him down like 10 times before we even went out.
LEADMALE:Ha.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? You know what made me finally change my mind? That big old rock he put on your finger? Well, besides that.
LEADMALE:It was knowing that no matter what I said or what I did or how I acted he would always be there for me.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, Will, if she really means something to you take a lesson from my fiancé.
LEADMALE:Don't give up.
LEADFEMALE:God, I miss him.
SUPMALE:Poor, poor Tip of the tongue, Will.
SUPMALE:Please help me out.
LEADMALE:Trevor.
LEADMALE:Trevor.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Hilary.
LEADMALE:Hey, you know what? I think you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I did give up too easy.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call Lisa right now.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:Damn, you got good ears, girl.
LEADMALE:We need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you got that right.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, do you mind?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, go ahead.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Duh.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, Lisa
OTHERFEMALE:No, Will.
LEADFEMALE:When I said we needed to talk I meant that I need to talk and you need to listen.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you are stupid.
LEADMALE:Well, stupid is as stupid does.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what is that supposed to mean? I don't know, but the movie made like a half a billion dollars.
LEADMALE:So I say one thing that you don't wanna hear and that's it? You just shut me out without even letting me explain? "Will, I don't want to marry you" seems pretty self-explanatory.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you're wrong.
LEADMALE:Will, I love you.
LEADFEMALE:But I feel like the only reason you asked me to marry you is because you're feeling vulnerable right now.
LEADMALE:Well, getting shot kind of has that effect on a brother.
OTHERMALE:I understand that, but what'll happen when you're back on your feet and feeling like yourself again? Baby, I don't wanna have to shoot you every six months just to hold on to you.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Lisa when that bullet hit me, I gotta admit, it scared the hell out of me.
LEADFEMALE:But it made me realize that maybe I don't have all the time in the world like I thought.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, who's to say what'll happen tomorrow or next week or the week after that? All I know is that I love you.
LEADFEMALE:And, Lisa, believe me, that is never gonna change.
LEADMALE: Well, in that case, the answer is yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes? Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes!  Hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:You wouldn't really bust a cap at me, though, would you?
SUPMALE:Not unless I have to.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:So you think we should tell your family?
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I think some of them already know.
LEADMALE: Good thing it's the ones on our side.
LEADMALE:Come on out here, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Give the bride-to-be a kiss.
LEADMALE:Time for a toast.
LEADMALE:Carlton, get some glasses.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Dom Perignon, the good stuff.
OTHERMALE:Tyler and I were saving it for our honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Trevor, Hilary.
SUPMALE:Right, Trevor, whatever.
LEADMALE:Anyway, I figured it was the least I could do with all the injuries I've caused.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:It ain't nothing, Hil.
LEADFEMALE:Accidents happen.
SUPMALE:
