LEADMALE:Hey, beautiful.
LEADMALE:I love a woman with good reflexes.
LEADMALE:Makes me crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:Get out.
SUPMALE:Your mouth is saying "get out," but your eyes are saying "get busy.
LEADMALE:" Daddy??? That's not going to work this time, Hil, darling.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil went to the supermarket, so he'll be gone for at least a week.
LEADFEMALE:Mom??? She went with him.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey???
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Miss Hilary?
LEADMALE:You know the drill.
SUPMALE:Hilary, why is it so hard for you to be nice to Jazz? You know he likes you.
LEADMALE:I'm supposed to be nice to everyone who likes me? How much time do you think I have? So that's the reason for you to be mean to Jazz?
SUPFEMALE:Look, Jazz will be fine.
LEADMALE:You think so? Well, I don't.
OTHERMALE:You don't know Jazz the way I know him.
LEADFEMALE:He's a very sensitive person.
SUPFEMALE:He has feelings that are very deep.
SUPMALE:When you had Geoffrey throw him out, I think that was the last straw.
LEADMALE:I don't think he'll ever be the same.
LEADMALE:Really? Want to kiss my boo-boo? I hope that you didn't take my throwing you out of the house personally, Mr.
LEADMALE:Jazz.
LEADMALE:It was strictly business.
OTHERMALE:That's cool.
SUPMALE:If you grab me in that place again, we're engaged.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jazz, if you want to get with Hilary you got to have a plan.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean mine hasn't been working? Jazz, that's the 18th time she threw you out of the house.
LEADMALE:All a part of my plan.
LEADMALE:We're home.
SUPMALE:Later.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, the groceries are in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, madam.
LEADMALE:Carlton has sunk to a new low.
SUPFEMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Carlton, what's up with the crutches?
SUPFEMALE:I'm practicing my new scam.
OTHERMALE:Girls love a guy with a sports injury.
SUPMALE:I can't see too many honeys being impressed 
LEADMALE:"Babe, I busted myself up playing peewee football.
SUPMALE:" Mom, Dad, I'm so glad you're home.
SUPMALE:I have exciting news about my job.
SUPFEMALE:What is it? I'm not going to just tell you.
SUPFEMALE:That's no fun.
LEADMALE:Guess.
LEADMALE:Did you sell a painting at the gallery?
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Did you get a promotion?
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Did you get fired?
SUPFEMALE:No, I quit.
LEADFEMALE:What?
OTHERMALE:I was definitely the closest.
OTHERMALE:Hilary, you were doing so well at the art gallery.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but, Mom, it's not really a cool job.
LEADMALE:When I was a little girl, I had a dream that when I grew up, I'd have a glamorous job in a glamorous office.
LEADFEMALE:At parties, people would ask what I did and I'd tell them.
SUPFEMALE:I imagined them turning pea-green with envy and blurting 
LEADMALE:"You are so lucky," and walking away eaten up inside because I had a fabulous job and they didn't.
LEADMALE:They say Gandhi had a very similar childhood dream.
LEADMALE:All right, young lady, how do you propose to get this glamorous job? I already got it.
OTHERFEMALE:Starting tomorrow, I'm going to be the personal assistant to Marissa Redman.
SUPMALE:The movie star?
LEADFEMALE:Wow, she's really big.
LEADFEMALE:What? She ain't do nothing good in years.
OTHERMALE:That's not true.
OTHERFEMALE:She's one of the most famous actresses in Hollywood.
SUPFEMALE:She won an Oscar.
LEADFEMALE:Nominated.
LEADFEMALE:And she was in one of the top 10 movies of all time.
LEADMALE:Eight years ago.
LEADFEMALE:And she needs a new assistant because she just got back from a well-deserved year off.
LEADMALE:Nose job.
LEADMALE:How did you know all of that? I have an inquiring mind.
SUPMALE:Will, please.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary's obviously very excited about this job.
LEADFEMALE:Be a little more supportive.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, I loved her in that musical she did.
LEADFEMALE:God, what a voice.
LEADMALE:Lip-synch.
LEADFEMALE:Dinner is served.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz, I thought you left.
LEADMALE:Why? Because you walked out the door and you said, "Later.
SUPMALE:" All a part of my plan.
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear the news about Hilary?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so proud of her.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, tomorrow's her first day at work.
SUPFEMALE:I think I got a little plan that will make Hilary like you.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow we'll go down there and you're gonna surprise her with flowers and candy.
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:Meet you here tomorrow at 9:00 sharp.
LEADMALE:You got it, man.
LEADMALE:Don't forget the candy and flowers.
SUPMALE:Miss Tony Fisher, please.
SUPMALE:Hi, Tony.
LEADFEMALE:It's Hil.
OTHERMALE:How's your job going? Guess where I'm calling from.
SUPMALE:No, guess.
OTHERMALE:No, guess again.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you mean you give up? This is fun.
LEADMALE:No, guess again.
OTHERMALE:No, don't hang up, Tony.
OTHERFEMALE:Do not hang up now.
LEADMALE:Come on, guess.
LEADFEMALE:No, guess again.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'm in Marissa Redman's office.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's my first day.
SUPFEMALE:What's she like? Tony, I have to tell you, you'd never know she was a movie star.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, she's so grounded.
OTHERFEMALE:She's so real.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care if you have other appointments, clown.
OTHERMALE:My cat needs acupuncture.
OTHERMALE:Marissa.
OTHERMALE:Heather.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get one thing straight.
OTHERMALE:My last assistant quit on me because I never learned her name.
LEADMALE:Now, is that going to be a problem?
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:I'm so excited.
LEADMALE:I want to learn all about the movie business.
OTHERFEMALE:And you will.
LEADMALE:The key is to be positive.
LEADFEMALE:I like positive people.
LEADMALE:Are you positive?
SUPMALE:Yes! Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, this is a process.
SUPMALE:You do realize it's a process? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I'm positive it's a process.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get that.
SUPFEMALE:You got that right.
LEADMALE:Miss Redman's office.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm afraid Miss Redman's on the other line now, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Haskell
OTHERMALE:but I'll see if she's finishing up.
SUPMALE:It's my agent.
SUPMALE:Hello, Sam.
SUPFEMALE:This better be good news.
LEADMALE:So you're saying I didn't get the part? I know the part called for a Meryl Streep type.
SUPMALE:Yes, I'm a Meryl Streep type if I want to be.
OTHERFEMALE:It's called acting, Sam.
LEADMALE:So what fool got the part? Meryl Streep.
LEADMALE:Ain't that cozy? I'm sorry you didn't get the part, Marissa.
SUPFEMALE:But let's be positive.
SUPFEMALE:After all, this is a process.
SUPMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:I have to go to a restaurant opening tonight.
OTHERMALE:So I need you to pick up my clothes from the cleaners.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not speaking to my tired boyfriend, so I'll need someone to go with.
LEADMALE:I wonder if that cute little Johnny Gill is free.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't he, like, my age?
OTHERFEMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:I get it.
LEADFEMALE:First, I'm too black to play Meryl Streep's parts and now I'm too old to date a 20-year-old.
OTHERMALE:Cher can do it, but I can't? No, Marissa, I didn't mean anything like that.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone's trying to fit me into their nice, neat little box.
LEADMALE:You're walking a fine line, Helena.
SUPFEMALE:A very fine line.
SUPMALE:Hello, I'm calling from Marissa Redman's office.
SUPMALE:Is her dry-cleaning ready? It says here on the 
LEADFEMALE:"Three dresses, two blouses, four silk brassieres "and eight pair of underwear.
LEADMALE:" Fantastic.
SUPMALE:I'll be right over to pick them up.
LEADMALE:Glamour, glamour, glamour.
LEADMALE:You know, while you're down there you may even get to see Dustin Hoffman's drawers.
LEADFEMALE:Will, what are you doing here? Congratulations on your new job, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Flowers, a Kit Kat and a song.
LEADMALE:All the way from Compton, California the king of the keyboard himself, just for you, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:It's Jazz!
SUPMALE:He plays so beautiful.
LEADMALE:Don't you agree?
SUPMALE:What is going on here?
LEADMALE:Marissa, I can explain.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even want to hear it.
LEADMALE:So I've got a party girl on my hands.
LEADMALE:Is that it? As soon as I turn my back.
LEADMALE:We've got a word for people like you in this business and it's called Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Miss Redman, we didn't mean to get Hilary in any trouble.
LEADFEMALE:I'm her cousin.
LEADFEMALE:She's not in any trouble.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't catch your name.
LEADFEMALE:Will Smith.
LEADMALE:Little Willie Smith.
SUPMALE:I like that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but little Willie's got to go now.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get right out of your way.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not in my way.
LEADMALE:Well, you kind of are.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you stay for a little while? You know, we'd love to, but we made other plans.
LEADMALE:No, we didn't.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you remember, Jazz you've got that brain-surgery appointment.
LEADMALE:Must have forgotten.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I just had a thought.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure it's brilliant.
OTHERMALE:What is it? I thought I'd like to take your cousin Will to that restaurant opening tonight.
LEADMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Are you thinking I'm too old for him? You think he wouldn't want to go out with me? No, Marissa, I mean, who wouldn't want to go out with you? You better hope he does.
SUPMALE:Because if he doesn't want to go out with me tonight, you're fired, Hester.
LEADFEMALE:I forfeit the game.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, G.
SUPFEMALE:He was about to take me.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Look who's home.
LEADMALE:It's Miss Hollywood.
SUPMALE:Tell me all about your faboo day.
LEADMALE:So what did you do this afternoon? Massage her feet, give her cat a perm? Will, I love your irreverent sense of humor.
SUPMALE:It's so refreshing.
SUPMALE:How you trying to play me, Hilary? Will, you're always thinking the worst of me.
LEADMALE:I have got some great news for you.
LEADMALE:Guess who I can get to go out with you.
SUPMALE:Janet Jackson?
SUPFEMALE:Guess again.
SUPFEMALE:Jody Watley.
LEADMALE:Guess again.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, or I'll kill you.
LEADFEMALE:Marissa Redman.
LEADMALE:You've got to be tripping.
LEADMALE:Hilary, I wouldn't go out with her if she and Marsha Warfield were the last two women on earth.
SUPMALE:Will, please.
LEADMALE:Marissa said if I can't get you to go out on a date with her, she'll fire me.
LEADFEMALE:Perfect.
SUPMALE:All she does is yell at you, boss you around and treat you like dirt.
SUPFEMALE:I know but I'm the envy of all my friends.
LEADMALE:Hilary, come on, don't cry.
LEADFEMALE:Don't cry.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:I guess it won't kill me to go out with Marissa Redman.
LEADMALE:Will, thank you.
LEADMALE:And I guess it won't kill you to go out with Jazz.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe that you agreed to go on this date with Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
SUPMALE:I had to, or I'd lose my job.
LEADMALE:Touchy, touchy.
LEADFEMALE:Cut it out! I can see it now.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:and Mrs.
LEADMALE:Jazz
LEADFEMALE:Does Jazz have a last name?
SUPFEMALE:I believe it's Matazz.
LEADMALE:Will you three cut it out? Philip, we don't mean anything by it.
LEADMALE:I don't see the destruction of our gene pool as something to joke about.
LEADMALE:That must be Jazz.
OTHERFEMALE:Marissa's meeting us at the restaurant.
OTHERMALE:We can't be a second late.
SUPMALE:Just relax, Hilary.
LEADMALE:Just make sure you're sweet to Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:This is making his whole week.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz.
SUPMALE:Yo, G.
LEADMALE:As of tonight, my new official name is Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Lucky.
SUPMALE:Marissa, thanks for inviting us.
LEADFEMALE:This is such an exciting new restaurant.
LEADMALE:Look at that.
SUPMALE:Butter on ice.
LEADFEMALE:I'm living large now.
LEADFEMALE:Speaking of ice, Jazz
OTHERMALE:doesn't Hilary look a little chilly?
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:You are so beautiful, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz, please.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I know you can be nicer than that.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:That was a wonderful imitation of a creepy spider you just did, Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Cher! Sophomore in high school.
SUPFEMALE:Beat that, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know what time it is, Hilary? It's 8:15.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
LEADMALE:It's "slow dancing with Jazz" time.
LEADFEMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's either "slow dancing with Jazz" time or "Will getting up, going home, and leaving you without a job" time.
OTHERFEMALE:Jazz, do you want to dance? Man, this must be my birthday.
SUPMALE:When you get back, bring me a mineral water three ice cubes, a lemon, and a lime.
LEADMALE:For the sake of novelty, get it right this time.
SUPMALE:Yes, Marissa.
LEADMALE:So, little Willie, would you pass me the salt, please? Sure.
SUPMALE:Jazz, I feel I should tell you something.
LEADMALE:I'm only on this date with you as part of my deal with Will.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:You do? It doesn't bother me but if it's making you feel sad dancing with me, you don't have to.
LEADMALE:No, Jazz, it's not that.
SUPFEMALE:Thank God.
LEADMALE:It's just this job is getting to me.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't mind the hard work.
SUPFEMALE:It's just I can't seem to do anything right.
SUPMALE:She's always yelling at me.
LEADFEMALE:Tell Jazz all about it.
SUPFEMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:Biggest director in town.
LEADFEMALE:Sydney.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
LEADFEMALE:Loved your new movie.
LEADFEMALE:We've got to do What? He just looked right through me.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should have spoken up a little bit.
LEADMALE:This is not good.
LEADMALE:Hickory! Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I just saw Sydney, and he cut me dead.
LEADFEMALE:Did you send him a bottle of champagne like I told you for the premiere of his crappy movie? You said this morning you were thinking of sending him something but didn't know what.
LEADFEMALE:Champagne would obviously be the perfect choice, Einstein.
SUPMALE:Marissa, chill.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:She's trying.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I work so hard.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I work harder than anybody, and I'm very underpaid and it does not help when the person who is supposed to be my assistant is a total idiot.
OTHERMALE:You're the idiot.
LEADMALE:Well, date's over.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I don't care how many movies you make.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody don't talk like that to Hilary.
OTHERMALE:She's smart, sweet, and the most beautiful woman in the cosmos and she's been very nice to me tonight.
LEADMALE:She's been nice to you, even though you didn't deserve it.
LEADFEMALE:So you tell her you're sorry because I'm about to get pretty mad.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:This is what you do.
OTHERMALE:Run to an all-night liquor store
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? What do you think I am? I shouldn't be treated like an idiot.
LEADMALE:I'm not an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:I'm smart.
SUPFEMALE:And another thing, your last five movies really sucked big time.
LEADMALE:Six.
LEADFEMALE:You can't stand here talking like that to me.
LEADFEMALE:You're right, because I have a prior engagement with someone from the A list.
LEADMALE:Come on, Jazz, let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, oh, Lord.
LEADFEMALE:Who needs them? They don't know how to appreciate you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I think me and you can have a better time without them.
LEADFEMALE:Really?
OTHERFEMALE:Psych.
SUPMALE:You really said that to Marissa? At least now Marissa the cradle crook knows what Hilary thinks about her.
LEADMALE:And I owe it all to Jazz.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Now my daughter's unemployed.
LEADMALE:Daddy, you should thank Jazz.
SUPMALE:He reminded me that I do have some self-respect.
SUPMALE:Why chase after celebrities? They're all so shallow and self-centered.
SUPFEMALE:From now on, I want to spend time with people who have depth intelligence, and maturity.
SUPMALE:I don't like the sound of this.
OTHERMALE:Good night, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Good night, Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, guys.
LEADMALE:Good night.
OTHERMALE:Night, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Guys, I'm sorry the night was so awful.
LEADMALE:Hilary, I'm just grateful I got my young body out of there before old Marissa put some miles on it.
SUPFEMALE:I got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Peace.
LEADMALE:Peace, babe.
LEADMALE:Jazz, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:I mean
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, babe.
LEADMALE:You want to go out with me on Saturday night? I don't think it's a good time.
LEADFEMALE:I'd only say "yes" because I felt like I owed you something.
LEADMALE:That's cool with me.
SUPMALE:Maybe some other time.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Good night, Hilary.
LEADMALE:No, wait.
SUPMALE:All a part of my plan.
LEADMALE:
