SUPFEMALE:What the heck is that? It's a fiber shake.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got an interview with an old Princeton chum of Dad's.
LEADMALE:I need to be strong.
LEADMALE:I need to be alert.
LEADMALE:And I need to be regular.
LEADMALE:Ain't nothing in the world gonna make you regular, man.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
OTHERMALE:Geoffrey, are my sandwiches ready yet?  Philip, for God's sake, we're going to SeaWorld.
SUPFEMALE:There's gonna be food stands everywhere.
LEADMALE:That may be true, Aunt Viv, but there ain't gonna be no food stand in the Volvo.
LEADMALE:You better let that man eat and give him food or he'll mess around and chew one of your arms off in the car.
SUPMALE:Carlton, I had a talk with Frank Bradley this morning from Princeton.
OTHERMALE:You ready for your big interview tomorrow?
LEADFEMALE:Am I ever.
OTHERMALE:I've been enhancing my résumé all week.

LEADMALE:Now, why you go and do that? You certainly ain't big, and as far as being a brother  Well, I've already planned what I'm gonna wear.
SUPFEMALE:I've got my argyles, my wide-wale cords and my lucky sweater.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Master Carlton, about your sweater, we've had a dryer mishap.
OTHERMALE: Don't worry, Carlton, it'll shrink.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a small setback.
SUPFEMALE:I still have the canary-yellow one.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you, Geoffrey.
OTHERFEMALE: Banks residence.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, certainly.
OTHERMALE:For you, Master Carlton.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:It's the rec center.
OTHERMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPMALE:All right.

OTHERMALE:Ha! You got that right.
SUPFEMALE:Mama, no! Hey, what's up, G? Another Village People reunion? As it is my weekend off, I've decided to head for the Circle M Dude Ranch.
OTHERFEMALE:There's nothing like the feel of an animal beneath you to recharge your battery.
SUPMALE: I know what you're talking about there, G.
SUPMALE:No, I'm afraid you don't, Master William.
LEADMALE:But I do find it rather endearing when you think you do.
LEADFEMALE:Have a nice weekend.
OTHERMALE: Have fun at the "dude ranch.

OTHERFEMALE:Ah, ha, ha.
OTHERMALE:Not so fast, man.
SUPMALE:I got a little surprise for you.
SUPMALE:Now, nothing makes a brother who's feeling down feel better than seeing somebody who's in worse shape.
LEADMALE:Huh? I called up Stinky McGuire.
OTHERMALE:Yeah? Stinky's here? I haven't seen him since high school.
LEADMALE:Seeing him would cheer me up.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he was always such a loser.
LEADFEMALE:He was even shorter than me.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, bring him in.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Carlton.
LEADMALE:  Party, dude.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, man.
SUPMALE:Come on.

SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You not in the mood for this, huh? Well, look here, too short if you wanna sit around and wallow in the stench of your own self-pity then you go right ahead.
LEADMALE:Will, you don't understand.

SUPMALE:Now, I'm about to go out and I'm gonna get me a 16-piece nugget dinner.
LEADMALE:And when I get back, I wanna see a new attitude, mister.
LEADFEMALE:And for God's sakes, clean yourself up.
LEADMALE:Whoa, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, Ash, the cops are outside.
SUPMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:No, no, I was just kidding.
SUPFEMALE:I'm playing.
SUPMALE:Will, what are you doing? I gotta get barbecue sauce.

LEADFEMALE:He left and he ain't come back yet Excuse me, Pappy, why don't you take a nappy? Listen, I am not about to stand here and argue with you about who has it worse.
LEADMALE:The fact of the matter is neither one of us has it that bad.
SUPMALE:But this is your last chance to get into Princeton.
LEADMALE:If you wanna blow that, you go right ahead.
SUPMALE:  What were you doing? No one's allowed in the bedrooms.

SUPMALE:I'm just having a smoke.
LEADMALE:Not here you're not, idiot.
OTHERMALE:Could somebody turn down the music? Carlton, I really appreciate your willingness to change your schedule.
LEADFEMALE:Well, changing is one of my strong suits, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bradley.
LEADMALE:As you know, your father and I were classmates at Princeton.
SUPFEMALE:He was quite the big man on campus.
LEADMALE:He's even bigger now.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, aren't we all?
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:I was very impressed with your application.
OTHERMALE:Particularly cogent was your essay on the fall of Eastern Europe.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:If you like Eastern Europe in the fall you should see it in the spring, it's beautiful.
SUPMALE:Oh, you.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE: Oh, you've got a good sense of humor.
SUPMALE:Obviously, you got that from your dad.
SUPMALE:Oh, you know my Dad? Well, yes, didn't I just mention that a moment ago? Ah! Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:Big man on campus.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:I see here that you've worked for a lot of charities.
SUPFEMALE:Which one meant the most to you? Um The second one.
LEADFEMALE:But this has all been about me, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bradley.
LEADFEMALE:Me, me, me.
LEADMALE:Frank, is there a Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Bradley? A couple of baby Bradleys? Hey, have you seen Braveheart? Look, friend, we can talk about candy all day but you ain't gonna convince me that blue was a bad way to go.
LEADMALE:By the way I hear that whistle blowing.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a train to catch.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let's go.
LEADMALE:Hey, hold on there, Sparky.
LEADFEMALE:Before you catch any train, how about you telling me what you're running away from? Okay.
LEADMALE:But this won't be pretty.
OTHERMALE:I must say, I was riveted by your thesis on regressive taxation.
SUPMALE:How did you arrive at such a scintillating hypothesis? But I guess the signs were always there.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure these chiseled good looks and striking personality opened the doors of opportunity quickly but lately, they've been closing even quicker.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, heck, who am I kidding? Look at me, I'm not Princeton material.
LEADFEMALE:Like the song says, Pappy "you gotta know when to fold them.
LEADMALE:" It's my time to fold.
SUPMALE:Sounds like, to me, you're giving up.
SUPFEMALE:You're a smart man, Pappy.
OTHERMALE:Listen, Carlton, it's one thing to throw in the hand but it's another thing to get up from the table and quit the game.
LEADMALE:You honestly believe that Superman could beat the Flash in a foot race? Oh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bradley, I'm glad you're still here.
OTHERMALE:Carlton Banks.
SUPMALE:What? That's poppycock.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Carlton Banks.
LEADMALE:No, Will, your charade is not necessary.
LEADMALE:Now, if you'll excuse us, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bradley and I need to talk.
SUPMALE:A lot of these legacies I interview, they've got the grades, the résumé but they're sheltered, you know? Like that milquetoast cousin of yours.
LEADFEMALE:But you really impressed me tonight.
LEADMALE:I'd be happy to sign a letter of recommendation for you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for covering for me tonight.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no problem, man.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just glad you came back when you did.
LEADMALE:I'm starting to get a little too comfortable in this stuff, know what I'm saying?  Um Carlton, hold up.
LEADFEMALE:Mom and Dad leave for the night and you take advantage like this? And what about you, mister? What kind of role model are you? If it weren't for me, the two of you would have this family on the way to hell in a handbasket.
LEADFEMALE:And another thing, what?
LEADMALE:He's back.
LEADFEMALE:He's back.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, I'm back? Of course, I'm back.
OTHERMALE: I'm home.
LEADFEMALE:
