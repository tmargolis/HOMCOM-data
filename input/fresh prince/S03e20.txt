SUPFEMALE:Get up.
SUPMALE:Hurry, everybody, get up! Yo, what's the matter, Uncle Phil? Calm down, Will, calm down.
OTHERMALE:It's Vivian, she's having the baby.
LEADMALE:That ain't what's scaring me.
LEADMALE:You ain't got no drawers on! Okay.
LEADMALE:Mother, are you all right? Of course you're not all right.
SUPMALE:You're having a baby.
LEADMALE:I think I'm going to be sick.
SUPMALE:Hilary, sweetie, come here.
SUPFEMALE:Having a baby is very spiritual.
OTHERFEMALE:This is my last baby and I am never going to experience this miracle again.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes another contraction.
LEADMALE:Why, that wasn't so bad.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, honey, don't be so dramatic.
LEADFEMALE:My hand.
SUPMALE:All right, it's cool.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's cool, Aunt Viv.
OTHERFEMALE:Everything's cool.
LEADMALE:All right, check it out.
LEADMALE:Carlton, you boil some water.
SUPMALE:Ashley, you go get some blankets.
LEADMALE:Hilary, you circle the wagons.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, honey, what are you talking about?
LEADFEMALE:I wish to God I knew, Aunt Viv.
SUPMALE:Mom, I think what Will is referring to is Oh, my God, the pains are getting closer.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, honey, get up off the floor.
SUPMALE:My hand! What is wrong with everybody? Philip, pull up your damn pants and let's go!
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Viv, I wanna go, too.
SUPMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I could really use somebody to hold my hand.
OTHERMALE:Wonder if Mom had the baby yet.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Birth is a miraculous thing, isn't it? To think I was once inside of a woman's body.
SUPMALE:I find that hard to believe.
LEADFEMALE:I think we all do, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mom.
SUPMALE:Mom! Mom, you're still pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:You think?
LEADFEMALE:I can't do this anymore.
LEADMALE:Look, me neither.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, getting woke up in the middle of the night by a naked man running around the house.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, I thought you were all asleep.
SUPFEMALE:Not you, G.
LEADMALE:Oh, never mind.
OTHERMALE:Look, now, everybody calm down.
LEADFEMALE:False alarms happen all the time.
LEADFEMALE:But Uncle Phil was naked, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, I wanna have this baby already.
SUPFEMALE:You think I don't? I feel like I ate a Buick.
LEADFEMALE:Look like a Winnebago from here.
OTHERMALE:Baby, is there anything more I can do for you? Will you look at her, Uncle Phil? Haven't you done enough? Leave her alone.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Good, I gotta lay down.
OTHERFEMALE:Can I get you some tea, madam? That would be lovely, Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:Bring it to the laundry room.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be sitting on the dryer.
LEADFEMALE:Poor Mom.
LEADMALE:Poor Mom? Poor me.
LEADMALE:I saw Uncle Phil naked.
LEADFEMALE:And he was running.
OTHERFEMALE:What can I get for you, madam? Geoffrey, I've got a proposition for you.
LEADMALE:Perhaps if we were both younger, and I didn't work for you.
LEADMALE:Not that kind of proposition, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:I will give you $50 to drive me over a set of railroad tracks.
SUPMALE:Well, Doctor, the pains are coming closer together.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they start in the abdomen and they kind of radiate up and down in all directions.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, what are you talking about? I'm not having any pains.
SUPMALE:Well, I am.
SUPMALE:Well, yes, Thursday afternoon will be fine.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, thank you.
OTHERMALE:Yes, your Majesty? Geoffrey, from an objective point of view, who is having this baby? Him or me? It's rather difficult to tell just by looking.
LEADMALE:She's in here.
LEADMALE:Look, whatever you do, don't mention her chins.
LEADFEMALE:Or her ankles.
SUPFEMALE:Or her feet.
SUPFEMALE:And whatever you do, never ever feed her after midnight.
LEADFEMALE:Poor Diva.
LEADMALE:Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sick of this.
SUPMALE:Look at you.
OTHERMALE:No more, y'all, come on.
LEADFEMALE:No more.
LEADMALE:Will, why are you crying?
SUPMALE:I don't know, man.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, where's Helen? She couldn't come.
SUPMALE:She had to go to court with Lester.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I thought the divorce was final months ago.
LEADMALE:That's right and everything was going so well until she saw Lester with another woman and that's when she snatched off the wig.
LEADFEMALE:She snatched off the woman's wig?
OTHERFEMALE:No, Lester's.
LEADMALE:What a novel idea, that little bell.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, would you get us all something to eat, please? Golly, yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's great to be working in the big house.
SUPMALE:You've all met our butler, Chicken George? Don't you worry, Vivian, I am going to take good care of you.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:I'm so happy you guys are here.
SUPMALE:I was beginning to feel like nobody understood me.
SUPFEMALE:We're family.
LEADFEMALE:We love you.
SUPFEMALE:Stop with the damn bell! That's it, I'm never going back up there again.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I ever went up there in the first place.
LEADMALE:I took her some honey for her tea.
SUPMALE:She tells me she does not want honey from California.
LEADFEMALE:She wants honey from New Mexico.
SUPMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:Diva needs to get her butt out of Bel-Air a little more often.
SUPFEMALE:If it get any bigger, it'll be in and out of Bel-Air at the same time.
LEADMALE:Oh, my goodness.
LEADMALE:All right, come on, y'all.
LEADFEMALE:This ain't easy on Aunt Viv.
SUPMALE:I mean, the baby is a week late.
LEADFEMALE:All right, that bell is mine.
LEADFEMALE:Who's with me? All right, Hilary, you act like you're gonna hug her and then pin her arms down.
SUPFEMALE:I know the chokehold.
LEADMALE:Better.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it, now.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's enough.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you know this is harder on her than it is on us.
LEADMALE:We're her family, we have to be here for her.
SUPFEMALE:You guys, why isn't anybody answering my bell? Could somebody please come upstairs and keep me company? You hate me, don't you? Okay, I know this has been hard to take and this baby does not look like he's coming any time too soon so why don't we just take a breather from one another? You know, just for a little while.
LEADMALE:Hello? Geoffrey, have you seen my bell? What bell? I don't blame you, Geoffrey, I've been pretty unbearable.
LEADMALE:Do you think my family is ever gonna come back? I doubt it.
LEADMALE:Why don't you sit down and let me make you some tea? Geoffrey, you know, you always know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you relax.
LEADFEMALE:If anything happens, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks has Master William's beeper.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm sure your sisters will be back from the salon any minute.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, this is great.
LEADFEMALE:I really needed this.
LEADMALE:I know, and some electrolysis wouldn't hurt you, either.
OTHERFEMALE:This could get ugly.
LEADMALE:We're family.
SUPMALE:Aren't you guys finished yet? Carlton, Aunt Vy is getting a makeover.
LEADMALE:It could take hours.
LEADFEMALE:Am I wearing a "kick me" sign? I don't see why women spend so much time in these places.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Forget college, I'm going to beauty school.
LEADFEMALE:Look, if I'm not back in 20 minutes, be really happy for me.
LEADFEMALE:Way to go, speedy.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Will, I could have driven myself here for my examination.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're taking this sympathy pains thing just a wee bit too far.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be ridiculous, Will.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:I think my water broke.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, it's Vivian.
SUPMALE:She's having the baby.
LEADFEMALE:We gotta get to the hospital!
OTHERFEMALE:Uncle Phil we in the hospital.
LEADMALE:Good, 'cause I'm having a heart attack.
OTHERMALE:Uncle Phil, I think you better let me take care of this.
LEADFEMALE:False alarm, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:It's for me, it's Carla.
SUPFEMALE:No, Uncle Phil, that's 40, 24, 36.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting out that cigarette? It's a free country.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, it certainly is but it's against the law to smoke cigarettes in elevators.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, boy, this is a New Jack City.
SUPMALE:You the man.
SUPFEMALE:You the man.
LEADFEMALE:You the big man that broke the elevator.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey, I think we better beep Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks.
OTHERMALE:Oh, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Keep calm.
OTHERFEMALE:I think we'd better beep Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, I just said that.
LEADFEMALE:Good, that's good.
LEADMALE:Now, we're on the same train of thought.
SUPMALE:How do you work this bloody thing? Thank God you're here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God! Uncle Phil, is that you? No, but you have really soft hands.
LEADMALE:Mommy! Ma! Relax, Will.
LEADMALE:I'm sure they'll have us out of here in no time.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, that's Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, somebody get us out of here! I'm having a baby! Something must be wrong.
SUPMALE:I've beeped him twice and he still hasn't answered.
LEADMALE:My hand! I'd better try the beauty salon.
LEADFEMALE:So, while she's been stepping out on him he's been having an affair with her sister.
OTHERMALE:But she works here so keep it quiet.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:What? Black Beauty, how can I help you? Yeah, right, it's always an emergency.
SUPFEMALE:I'll ask.
LEADFEMALE:Vy Smith, phone call.
LEADMALE:Sorry, nobody's answering.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you just love these quiet girl talks? What? I know.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, it looks like you're gonna have to drive me to the hospital.
LEADMALE:Will I steer with my left foot? I hate men.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mommy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God, here comes another one.
LEADMALE:Ashley, give me your hand!
LEADFEMALE:No way.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley!
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey!
LEADFEMALE:You keep away from me.
SUPMALE:This baby's coming.
LEADMALE:I gotta get to the hospital.
OTHERMALE:Don't worry, Mom, I'll get you there.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, you can't drive.
SUPMALE:Grow up.
LEADFEMALE:I've been taking the car since I was 12.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:How much longer before somebody gets us out of here? My wife's having a baby.
LEADMALE:She ain't in there with you, is she?
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Good, 'cause I'm going on a break.
SUPFEMALE:What? Just kidding, a little elevator humor there.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, I'll get you out of there as soon as I can.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey, I'm gonna be late for lunch.
LEADMALE:Great, you have a phone.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, and you don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, we gotta get that phone.
LEADMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, just ask him nice.
LEADMALE:No, after what I did to him, he's never going to let me use it.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, I'm coming straight out the hood, right? All right, where I come from when we want something, we step up on it and take it.
LEADMALE:Observe.
SUPFEMALE:Please, can I use your phone? Look, man, if you don't let me use your phone I'm gonna start singing Paula Abdul's greatest hits.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you want to use this phone real bad, huh? Yes, sir, I do.
LEADFEMALE:About as bad as I wanted that cigarette? Stop, ghetto time.
LEADFEMALE:No, Will.
OTHERMALE:Calm down.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Calm down, now.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I trained as a lawyer for many years.
SUPMALE:I was trained in the art of negotiation, okay? Observe.
OTHERFEMALE:Sir, give me that damn phone or I'm gonna rip your liver out and eat it raw.
LEADMALE:That's right, boy, and he about due for a snack.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Banks should be arriving at the hospital any minute.
SUPFEMALE:What? Who drove her?
LEADFEMALE:Who drove?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You are trapped in an elevator, right? Yes, yes I'm trapped in an elevator.
LEADMALE:Now who drove her? Miss Ashley drove.
LEADFEMALE:What? How could you let that happen? Are you insane? No, sir, I don't know how I could have let that happen.
LEADFEMALE:Call Mrs.
SUPMALE:Banks' sisters and tell them to meet her at the hospital.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, sir, I'll call the salon right away.
LEADFEMALE:I am furious at you, Geoffrey! This is completely irresponsible of you.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir, I'm a very, very bad butler.
SUPMALE:In fact, I'm going to punish myself.
OTHERMALE:No phone privileges for a week.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Geoffrey, we're on our way.
LEADMALE:Vivian's having the baby.
SUPMALE:We've got to get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Finally.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go get Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Hilary.
LEADMALE:I can't go into a hospital looking like this.
SUPFEMALE:The place is full of doctors.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, please don't tell me you're that superficial.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it may be superficial to you, but I'm young, I can still get a husband.
LEADFEMALE:Not without any teeth, you won't.
LEADFEMALE:That girl wanted me, Aunt Janice.
SUPMALE:Carlton, when a woman says, "Drop dead, troll" it usually means she's not interested.
LEADMALE:Now, come on.
SUPMALE:I'll call you.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, young lady but you are going to have to fill out these insurance forms like everyone else.
SUPMALE:I'm a kid.
LEADMALE:I don't know jack about insurance.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, but those are the rules.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, here comes a big one.
LEADFEMALE:Nurse, could you hold my hand, please? Get this woman to a birthing room.
LEADMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Fagin, telephone, please.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to Hilary? Hilary Violet Banks, get your butt in here.
LEADFEMALE:My hand.
LEADFEMALE:I'm pretty sure Mom has been here.
LEADFEMALE:Look, this is an emergency.
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any mascara? Where is the woman that did this to you? Down the hall.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:She's down here.
LEADMALE:Vivian, we got here as soon as we could.
LEADMALE:You doing okay, baby? She's fine.
SUPMALE:I took care of things.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look, I appreciate that you're a close family but you all can't be in here.
LEADMALE:I'll go.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:This is what I usually look like.
OTHERFEMALE:Philip! Vivian.
OTHERMALE:Wilma! Dad, over here.
LEADMALE:Where? Where is she?
LEADMALE:That way.
LEADMALE:Vivian! Say hello to your new son.
LEADMALE:We should get a picture of this.
LEADFEMALE:Doc, would you do the honors? Sure.
LEADMALE:Look, he look like a little black yoda.
OTHERMALE:He's adorable.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, little Nicholas Andrew Banks.
SUPMALE:Honey, I thought we agreed to call him Philip.
LEADMALE:That's a stupid name.
OTHERMALE:Why don't we name him after Daddy? Eli.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:No, over my dead body.
LEADMALE:Let's name him Rufus.
OTHERFEMALE:How about Brock? Shazam! Smile.
SUPMALE:Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston.
LEADMALE:Wilma!
LEADMALE:
