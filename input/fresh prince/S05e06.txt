LEADMALE:This piece is exquisite.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:It certainly is.
LEADFEMALE:And you can sense the artist's pain and yet it's a celebration of life.
LEADMALE:Yo! A swap meet.
SUPFEMALE:This is Mr.
SUPMALE:Culture.
LEADMALE:What you talking about, Uncle Phil? I got me a capacity for paintings, man.
LEADMALE:You know, I can sense what the artist is saying.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, like this one.
LEADFEMALE:What a brother got to do to get some fries? See, and here, I can sense the juxtaposition of metaphors interspersed with the three-second violation.
LEADFEMALE:You're a jackass.
LEADFEMALE: What is that noise? Geoffrey's using my electric shoe buffer.
LEADFEMALE:That old thing with the frayed wires? That's one of a kind.
OTHERMALE:They don't make them like that anymore.
OTHERMALE:I call this one workman's compensation.
LEADMALE:Autumn, my favorite time of the year.
SUPMALE:The leaves are falling and the hotties are pledging.
LEADFEMALE:Here I go, girl.
LEADMALE:Baby, if I told you you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me? Get it? That's a double entendre.
SUPMALE:   Oh, Grey Poupon to you too, girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, listen, what do you say we go have some dinner tonight? You know, escargots and all that.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think that will be a good idea.
SUPFEMALE:I'm pledging Kappa and we sisters have to stick together.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Your lines won't work with us, mister.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Lines? What are y'all talking about? These aren't lines.
LEADMALE:You know what? A woman cannot take it when a man is honest.
LEADMALE:Look, when I take a woman out, I'm 100 percent gentleman.
SUPMALE:I'm opening car doors, paying for dinners.
LEADFEMALE:Car doors, paying for dinners.
LEADMALE:And I treat a woman like a king treats a queen.
SUPFEMALE:Y'all remembered those, huh? Ladies, say goodbye to Will in his native tongue.
LEADFEMALE:    I don't believe you.
SUPFEMALE:You're so desperate to get over, you gonna go out on your own blood.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not trying to get over on anybody, Will.
SUPMALE:Your problem is that you can't understand or respect women because you're not in touch with your feminine side.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what your problem is, C? You're not in touch with anybody's feminine side.
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy, today I bought something for someone I really love.
LEADMALE:I hope you enjoy it, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, it's for you.
OTHERMALE:Well, what do you think? It's It's a Blue.
SUPMALE:I bought it next door at the new country club.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a Marachi, handmade in Milan.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you love it? Try it on.
SUPFEMALE:Well, ha, ha my first Marachi.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I just think that sweater looks gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I'm gonna buy you a matching hat.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sweetheart Tell me, sir, do I wash that or take a weed whacker to it? 
LEADMALE:So, what are you talking about? 
LEADFEMALE:What is? Carlton, quick, get a bat, let's bust this pi√±ata.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it, Dad, he got his earlier.
SUPFEMALE:Today, this entire group of girls made a fool out of Will.
OTHERMALE:Not one of them would fall for his lines.
LEADMALE:Master William, it's for you.
LEADMALE:A Lisa Wilkes.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, one.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, man, can I help it if I say the things that women wanna hear? What's up, chumpy? It's confidence, son.
OTHERFEMALE:Women love a confident man.
SUPMALE:Take me for instance.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, back in the day  I'd slip on the old dashiki puff up the old fro find a foxy mama, say, "Hey, baby, let's get it on.
SUPFEMALE:"  And they bought that? Actually, your mother was the only one.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Helen, they was out of Goobers, so I got us this large thing of popcorn.
LEADFEMALE: Get out! What you doing, Barney? Yo, man, where Helen at? She's probably at the chiropractor.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Helen! Helen.
LEADMALE:Oh, Will, don't let that spoil anything, because this has been the greatest night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you like this one, wait till you see the sequel.
SUPFEMALE:You are a dog.
OTHERFEMALE: The only problem is I really wanna be a Kappa and if they see me with you, they won't let me in.
SUPFEMALE:Don't even worry about that, I'll wear a disguise.
LEADMALE:I'll go Michael Jackson style.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:You don't need to go that far.
LEADFEMALE:I'm house-sitting a friend's cabin this weekend and I wouldn't mind a little company.
LEADFEMALE:Little company? I'm more like the Fortune 500, you know? AT&T.
OTHERFEMALE:Reach out and touch a brother if you got your bill paid.
LEADMALE:Will, where are you going? Oh, to the cabin.
LEADFEMALE:That's tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, cool.
LEADMALE:Well, let's get back to the movie.
OTHERMALE:I was so lucky I found this hat.
LEADMALE:It was the last extra extra extra large.
SUPFEMALE:Well, gee, the gods must be smiling on me.
LEADMALE:And I'd guess there's some laughing and pointing going on too.
LEADFEMALE: Oh, honey, I think it's cute.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Really? I'm going to the pro shop to buy you a matching outfit right now.
SUPFEMALE:Well, honey, I quit playing golf.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
SUPFEMALE:You could at least yell four! I'll take care of it, Miss Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:You know, when they redesigned this golf course I thought it might raise our property values.
SUPFEMALE:But it's making it dangerous for us to be here.
LEADMALE:Sir, perhaps you could get them to erect a fence.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:MAN 
SUPMALE:Always and forever Each moment with you Will, you're so romantic, I don't know why you have such a horrible reputation.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you know, I'm really just misunderstood.
SUPMALE:You spend a little time with me, you'll see I'm actually pretty cool.
LEADFEMALE:  Now, where were we? Why don't we just dance? MAN 
LEADMALE:With a smile Take time Oh, I just love these romantic songs.
OTHERMALE:Baby, this song is not even good enough for you.
OTHERFEMALE:I could write you the best love song ever.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE: Let's hear it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, you see, um I'm not really that good at thinking on my feet.
LEADMALE:Not yet.
SUPMALE:How about we play a little game first?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, cool.
LEADMALE:Here, have a seat.
LEADMALE:Oh, what kind of game? We're gonna play cops and robbers.
OTHERMALE: Oh, girl now Make it more better now I'm gonna be the cop and you're gonna be the nasty old robber.
OTHERFEMALE:Just call me public enemy number one.
LEADFEMALE:So how do you like the game so far? Beat the hell out of playing Stratego with Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! That's kind of tight.
LEADMALE:Oh, I mean, I know my rights.
SUPFEMALE:I think I'm entitled to one frisk.
SUPMALE:Shut up! Huh? I thought you were good, but you're not good.
LEADFEMALE:You've caused so much pain to so many women.
LEADFEMALE:You're just a dirty dog.
LEADFEMALE:And now it's payback time.
SUPMALE:Baby, you're kind of killing the mood.
LEADMALE:Ow! What are you, a psycho? You don't know how tired I am of hearing that.
SUPMALE:Huh?   Hello? Hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Nicky, it's Will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Will.
LEADMALE:Nicky, I need some help.
LEADFEMALE:I need you to get a grownup.
LEADMALE:Carlton! Nicky, I said a grownup.
LEADMALE:Carlton Banks here.
LEADMALE:Carlton, it's Will.
LEADMALE:I'm up at Lake Arrowhead with Lisa.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, she got me tied to a chair, man.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, stop bragging, you sick pervert.
LEADFEMALE:Who's a pervert?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm just teasing Will.
LEADFEMALE:See, some girls are playing a trick on him at some cabin.
OTHERMALE:What kind of trick?
LEADFEMALE:They're going to terrorize and torture him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry, it's all in good fun.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:So Mr.
LEADMALE:Dirty Dog is trying to make a phone call, is he? So you mean to tell me for 5 extra dollars, I could get HBO? Okay, basic cable is cool.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't mind if I freshen up a little bit for you.
LEADMALE:What you doing? I just wanna look pretty for you.
LEADFEMALE:And you do.
LEADMALE:You do.
LEADMALE:You know, I saw a great dress to go with that lipstick.
SUPFEMALE:You did? Yeah, and you know what, if you untie me we'll drive down and get it before it closes.
SUPMALE:Do I look like a fool to you? No, not a fool.
OTHERMALE:Hey, wait, wait, where you going? To get the dress.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Lord.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:Ooh! Hot.

OTHERMALE:Our daughter bought them for us.
OTHERFEMALE:She's got great taste.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mr.
LEADMALE:Kareem, they're waiting for you on the tee.
OTHERFEMALE:Got to run, ciao.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Ciao.
SUPMALE:You know, honey, the color of this sweater does compliment your eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it is comfy.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go get the stains out.
LEADMALE:These are my role models.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:How you doing there, Little Miss Mood Swing? Give me the keys to the car.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now I'm never gonna get in.
LEADMALE:You need to be worried about getting out.
OTHERFEMALE:Them rubber rooms ain't got no windows.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, I am not crazy, okay? This whole thing was a sorority prank.
LEADFEMALE:They wanted me to teach you a lesson.
LEADFEMALE:In what, bladder control? No, respect for women.
LEADMALE:Ugh! I cannot believe you sorority girls could be so devious.
SUPMALE:It was actually your cousin Carlton's idea.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? You know what, I'm gonna pop that little zit when I get home.
SUPMALE:You give me the car keys.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:What you crying about? You don't care.
SUPFEMALE:You're damn right I don't care.
SUPMALE:You damn near fricasseed me.
LEADMALE:But seriously, though, what you crying about? Will, the only reason I did this is because I wanna be a Kappa.
LEADFEMALE:So I guess that if I don't go through with this thing then you can kiss your pledge pin goodbye.
LEADMALE:Oh, well.
SUPMALE: I deserve that.
LEADMALE:Will, I just want you to know that this is the best date that I've had in a long time.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, before I tied you up.
LEADFEMALE:Like I'm supposed to believe that.
LEADFEMALE:Pfft! For real? WILL 
SUPFEMALE:You're right, I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm a dog.
SUPMALE:I'm the fresh prince of the pound.
LEADMALE:The doggiest of all dogs.
SUPFEMALE:Unbelievable.
OTHERFEMALE:Will Smith apologizing.
SUPMALE:My sisters, welcome the newest member of Kappa Phi Gamma, Lisa Wilkes.
LEADMALE:All right.

LEADMALE:Pray tell, why not? We got up there, the girl went crazy.
LEADFEMALE:She tied me to this chair, was trying to torture me.
