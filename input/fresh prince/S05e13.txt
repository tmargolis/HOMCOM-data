LEADFEMALE:After we power down our cocoas, there's a complimentary luge lesson.
LEADMALE:Followed by supper at 7, then back to the room for some hot spiced cider and a Barbara Walters Special.
LEADFEMALE:Normally, I would ditch you on that last one but, uh, I'm gonna let you in on a little something.
LEADMALE:Ever since I was like 7, I had a mad crush on Barbara Walters.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I was the only one.
SUPFEMALE:How do you feel about Nancy Reagan? Oh, see now you're being just sick.

SUPFEMALE:Your whole life does flash before your eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Which reminds me, you still owe me You want your 20 bucks? Okay, here it is.
LEADMALE: Now, go get it, you little car flipper.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Making a mental note of where it is in case we get out of here, which we won't.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about?
LEADFEMALE:It's a 40-foot drop to that slope.
SUPMALE:Well, we ain't going that way.
LEADMALE:I'm climbing back up to the road.
OTHERMALE:Will, that's sheer ice.
LEADMALE:Happen not gonna.
LEADMALE:Back in Philly, they used to call me Spider-Man.
SUPMALE:That was just one of my nicknames.
LEADFEMALE:So this is it.
SUPMALE:This is how the Carlton Banks story ends.
OTHERFEMALE:With a whimper.
LEADFEMALE: Shut up, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE: Help! Echo! Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho.
LEADMALE:Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hey.
LEADMALE:Hi-de-hi-de-Heidi-Fleiss.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, isn't it great about Hilary? When do you think I'll get to move out? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, you know expressions like "when hell freezes over"? "When the cows come home"? "When donkeys fly"? Pick one.
SUPMALE:It's too dark to signal with that mirror, Will, you might as well put it down.
SUPMALE:I've been trying to for, like, a half hour.
SUPMALE:Will, I want you to eat me.
LEADFEMALE:If I die first.
SUPMALE:You can stay alive by using my body for nourishment.
OTHERFEMALE:Incidentally, the buttocks has the most meat.
LEADFEMALE:God, I hope I go first.
LEADFEMALE: Ouch.
LEADFEMALE:God, man, my fingers are getting all numb.
SUPMALE:That's how it starts.
SUPFEMALE:First numbness, then the sensation of needles on skin finally, right before death, violent spasms as your blood freezes and your heart locks up.
LEADFEMALE:No more Discovery Channel for you, man.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
OTHERMALE:What Carlton, what? What?
LEADMALE:No, no, no! What, Carlton, violent spasms? Tell me what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't get the insurance.
SUPMALE:What?
LEADMALE:I put the car on my credit card and I didn't get the $6 insurance.
SUPMALE:You always wonder why they ask you to sign that waiver.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there it is.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know what's worse.
LEADFEMALE:Dying a slow agonizing death or staying alive and listening to you.
LEADMALE:Damn, it's cold.
LEADMALE:You know, Will? I don't have any friends.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about, Carlton? You got plenty of friends, man.
SUPMALE:You think people are your friends but they're only that because of what you can do for them.
LEADFEMALE:Except you, Will.
SUPFEMALE:I don't do anything for you.
LEADMALE:Even when you make fun of me I know you're doing it out of love.
SUPFEMALE:You haven't been doing that as much lately.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about, Carlton? I just called you Thumbelina this morning.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but your heart wasn't in it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Carlton let me tell you something, man.
LEADMALE:Lisa, that's my girlfriend and we're gonna be together, man.
SUPFEMALE:But that doesn't change the fact that you're my best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Stumpy.
LEADMALE:I'd cry, but my tear ducts are frozen.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? I ain't going out like this.
SUPMALE:All right, look, I figure if I can hit this slope at the perfect angle I could ski down and get us some help.
SUPMALE:Look, Will, I'm a much better skier than you.
SUPFEMALE:Let me go.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.
SUPMALE:You'd let me jump like that? Hey, hey, hey, who better to risk his life for me than my best friend, huh? Huh? Wait, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:I think I see somebody down there.
LEADFEMALE:We're saved.
LEADMALE: Hello, up here! I think he sees us.
SUPFEMALE: What? What did he say? I think he said, "Don't yell.
SUPFEMALE:" Don't yell?  Why not?  
OTHERFEMALE:Avalanche! 
LEADMALE:You don't think anything bad happened?
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure they'll be back any second.
SUPFEMALE:  What was that?  Hey, you know, you never know how brave you can be until you don't have no choice.
OTHERFEMALE:Now I see how people could jump out of burning buildings.
SUPFEMALE:You couldn't figure it out before? Look, Lisa, we still have a full day left.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we make the most of it?
LEADMALE:I would like that, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:There's three of us now, we need to get another room.
SUPMALE:I have a room.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, isn't that great? Now you and I can stay together and Lisa can stay with her.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:How could you not take the insurance? It only costs an extra $6.
OTHERFEMALE:Sweetheart, in honor of your new house we've put together a little photo album for you.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Naugahyde.
OTHERMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:You really went all out.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Just look at the pictures.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, here I am at Camp Gucciwanka.
LEADMALE:Ha.
SUPFEMALE:Camp Gucciwanka? Oh, yeah, that's Apache for "over-privileged.
SUPMALE:" I drew a picture of the family, and that's you with the diamond.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna miss you all so much.
LEADMALE:Will, you take good care of that little lady.
SUPMALE:And, Carlton, you stay just who you are, I mean that.
OTHERMALE:And, Daddy, don't worry, I still have duplicates of all your credit cards.
SUPMALE: Goodbye, little house.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, little yard.
SUPMALE:Oh, goodbye, little lamp.
LEADMALE:No, I could use this.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:One down, four to go.
LEADMALE:Take it easy, Philip.
LEADMALE:It's still about 13 years before our nest is empty.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Hey, guys, listen, me and Lisa about to run to Roscoe, get a little grub.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Carlton, you wanna go? No, three is a crowd.
