OTHERMALE:I'm in.
LEADMALE:I call.
LEADMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:What you got, man?
SUPMALE:Oh, it's so pretty.
LEADFEMALE:It's just so pretty.
SUPMALE:If I had two sets of lips, I'd kiss myself.
OTHERFEMALE:Trump aces.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's 9:30.
LEADMALE:Time to turn in.
SUPMALE:The Peacock's catering a big party tomorrow night after Michelle Michaels' concert.
LEADFEMALE:I suggest you get some shuteye, mister.
OTHERMALE:We'll be melon balling at 0600.
SUPMALE:I can't believe you'll be hanging out with Michelle Michaels.
LEADMALE:She is a goddess.
SUPMALE:Please, she put her bra on one cup at a time just like everybody else.
LEADFEMALE:I'd pay big money to see that.
SUPFEMALE:Save your dough for Friday night.
OTHERMALE:What's Friday night? There's people coming.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna watch the fight on Pay Per View.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Will, I have better things to do with my Friday nights than sit around, watching some stupid boxing match on TV.
LEADMALE:Well, you overlooked one small fact, Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:What's that?
OTHERMALE:You weren't invited.
SUPMALE:Whoa, now, hold it.
LEADFEMALE:Now, don't think of this just as a backstage pass.
LEADMALE:Think of it more as a merit badge.
LEADFEMALE:What are you going to do to earn it? You got to do something.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? What's up? What you gonna do? Will, we have a crisis situation.
LEADFEMALE:The glasses have spots on them.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you come to me sooner? Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Relax, squeeky.
LEADFEMALE:It's just a dumb old party.
LEADMALE:You don't look at the big picture, do you? Today, Michelle Michaels, tomorrow, Gloria Estefan.
LEADFEMALE:And then, dare I dream, Michael Bolton.
LEADMALE:Lan, I didn't feel like anything was clicking tonight.
LEADFEMALE:You sure the new songs are working? Three words, babe, fabulous.
LEADFEMALE:Am I right? Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody jumping.
SUPFEMALE:People act so stupid when celebrities get around.
LEADFEMALE:I need a reality check.
LEADMALE:You, waiter.
SUPFEMALE:Come here.
OTHERFEMALE:Me? Yeah, you.
OTHERMALE:Miss Michaels wants to see me.
SUPFEMALE:Have you heard my new record?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, sure, baby, who hasn't?
SUPFEMALE:It's magic, isn't it?
LEADFEMALE:Right, sister.
SUPFEMALE:Please.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you like it? Well, you got some beats.
LEADMALE:You do got some beats.
LEADFEMALE:And you mix some lyrics with your beats, and you blended them.
LEADFEMALE:Be honest.
SUPMALE:I think it stinks.
SUPMALE:I apologize, Miss Michaels.
SUPMALE:He's from a foreign land.
OTHERMALE:Back to work, Vladimir.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton Banks here.
LEADMALE:I balled your melons.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:So is there anything you do like about my record? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That cover is slamming, you know.
SUPMALE:How long it take you to get all that honey off you, girl, you know? You look all sticky and everything, you know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just acting stupid, you know.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just tripping.
LEADMALE:I can't believe that I'm actually talking to Michelle Michaels.
SUPMALE:And I can't believe I'm actually talking to Who are you? Will Smith, of the Philadelphia Smiths.
LEADFEMALE:So, honest Will.
SUPMALE:Did you like the show? I've been back here.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't hear anything.
OTHERMALE:All I heard 
SUPMALE:I really didn't have it going on, but next time I'm gonna kick it and maybe you could be there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'm with that.
LEADMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I need to get back to work.
LEADMALE:See you later?
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:You know, Miss Michaels, I thought your album stunk too.
SUPMALE:She only wanted to know my opinion.
SUPMALE:Will, I cannot believe Michelle Michaels actually spoke to you.
LEADMALE:Hey, I checked her coat.
LEADMALE:Really? I wonder who'll play you in the movie of her life? You know what, Will? Maybe I'll get you Michelle Michaels' new CD for your birthday.
SUPMALE:Oh, my goodness, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:I do have a birthday coming up.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, it just totally slipped my mind.
LEADMALE:Now, now, listen.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing too fancy.
SUPMALE:Something in a hatchback will do just fine.
LEADMALE:You're impossible to surprise, so this year, we're not doing anything special.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, we're all set.
SUPFEMALE:Birthday reservations at Wolfgang Puck's new restaurant.
SUPMALE:Hilary.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:Aunt Viv, you can still surprise me with that red sweater you hiding in the upstairs closet.
OTHERMALE:Wolfgang Puck, huh? You were great.
SUPFEMALE:He fell for it.
SUPMALE:Now he'll never suspect we're giving him a surprise party.
SUPMALE:We're giving him a surprise party? I am proud to announce Miss Michelle Michaels.
LEADMALE:Are you stalking me? No, I just wanted to see you again.
LEADMALE:It was so nice to talk to somebody other than a hysterical fan.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, Michelle Michaels! Your second song on your third album is so cool.
LEADMALE:Who was Omar? Is he your boyfriend?
LEADMALE:He is so fine.
SUPFEMALE:You might never
LEADMALE:Ashley, please.
LEADMALE:Hilary Banks, TV weathergirl.
LEADMALE:Pardon my little sister.
LEADFEMALE:She doesn't know how to talk to celebrities.
SUPFEMALE:So, Mich.
LEADMALE:How about a song? Oh, hello there.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Philip Banks.
OTHERMALE:This is my wife, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:We're not hip, so we don't know your music.
OTHERMALE:It's nice to meet you anyway, though.
OTHERMALE:Now, let's give them some privacy.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come upstairs.
LEADMALE:It was nice meeting you, Michelle.
LEADMALE:It's good to see you again, Michelle.
LEADMALE:Miss Michaels?
LEADMALE:Yes? Don't think of me as just a manservant, think of me as a pleasure dome.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, G.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that was embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:No, they're sweet.
LEADFEMALE:So do you wanna come to my concert tonight? You can watch from backstage.
SUPMALE:Oh, goodness.
LEADMALE:See, tonight is dime-a-frame bowling night, you know.
SUPMALE:Top scorer gets those cute little shoes and I just couldn't miss that.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll send a limo for you at 6.
SUPMALE:Then, after the concert, she took me to this fly restaurant called Chez Pinette.
LEADMALE:Chez Pinette? Isn't that up near San Francisco? Oh, did I forget to tell you-all? She flew me up there in her private jet.
SUPFEMALE:What?
SUPMALE:Michelle has a private jet? Listen, she got a private jet.
SUPFEMALE:She has yacht.
LEADFEMALE:Does she have a brother? Well, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll find out tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to the Golden Choice Music Awards.
LEADFEMALE:They got us sitting between lke and Tina just in case something flare up.
LEADMALE:Hey, y'all, don't wait up.
LEADMALE:Hilary, is the coast clear? No, there's gonna be patchy morning fog with limited visibility.
LEADFEMALE:I meant is Will gone?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he's gone.
LEADFEMALE:Let's talk about this party.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Hilary, you are getting the DJ and I arranged for the caterer.
LEADMALE:Why do I have to pay for a caterer if I have a butler? Philip complains.
LEADMALE:That only leaves the cake.
LEADFEMALE:All set.
SUPFEMALE:I ordered a Sunny the Seal ice-cream cake.
LEADFEMALE:His sleek little body is made of chocolatey goodness and he balances a ball of tutti-frutti sherbet on his buttercream nose.
LEADMALE:You are way too into this.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess at your age, birthdays are no longer a cause for celebration.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm giving up a hair appointment with Sergai to hang out with Will and his loser friends.
SUPMALE:Will's friends are not losers.
LEADMALE:Greetings, y'all.
LEADMALE:Jazz, to what do we owe your presence? My guess would be inbreeding.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm taking care of the entertainment for Will's party.
LEADFEMALE:I've already shelled out for a DJ.
LEADMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Now we have music for my stripper.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, You are not bringing a naked woman into my house.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:You don't understand, Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Banks.
LEADMALE:She don't come in naked.
LEADFEMALE:Where is Will? He was supposed to be here at 7.
OTHERMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:I'm leaving.
LEADMALE:Where are you going? Sergai keeps the salon open till 9.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna see if he can squeeze my head in.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks, can I borrow 50 more bucks for Princess Lalet? Otherwise, she gonna leave.
LEADMALE:Let her go.
LEADFEMALE:I've spent enough money on this party.
SUPFEMALE:Here's 100 dollars.
LEADFEMALE:No telling when Will will come back.
SUPMALE:Well, he didn't leave a message on the answering machine.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe that's him now.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:You're an hour and a half late.
SUPMALE:What, do you mean you can't make it? Friends? What friends? So, birthday boy, you having fun? This is the best birthday I ever had.
LEADMALE:I always wanted to try skiing too.
SUPFEMALE:You did great.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:Except for that one run.
SUPMALE:I'm just glad that the Saint Bernard didn't have to suffer.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've been wanting to check this out over here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what does this button do?
OTHERMALE:No, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the moon roof.
SUPMALE:Oh, and that's funny? You think that? Okay, no, no.
LEADMALE:No, what are you doing? Don't.
SUPMALE:Come down.
LEADFEMALE:Come inside, it's freezing out there.
SUPFEMALE:Come up, babe, it's great.
LEADMALE:There's no way.
SUPMALE:You're crazy.
LEADFEMALE:I said, come up here.
OTHERMALE:You ain't with me?
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Well, take that, then, girl.
LEADFEMALE:How's that?
LEADMALE:All right, that's it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what you gonna do? Oh, man.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:I'm frozen solid.
LEADMALE:Really? Well I was thinking maybe I could warm you up a little bit.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I just got caught up in the moment.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hell, yeah.
SUPMALE:Greetings from Aspen.
LEADMALE:Let me tell you, what a night.
LEADMALE:You open up the hot tub and the neighbors come out.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? I didn't even mind Bruce and Demi, you know.
OTHERMALE:I really didn't mind Arnold and Maria.
OTHERFEMALE:But Frank and Kathy Lee came over with that little dude Cody.
LEADMALE:He made bubbles in the Jacuzzi without the jets on.
SUPMALE:You know what I'm saying? Nasty little dude, you know.
SUPFEMALE:You have got a lot of nerve, Will.
SUPMALE:Right, big guy? Oh, yeah, right, right.
LEADFEMALE:Will, this Maria Shriver full-figured gal?
SUPFEMALE:Philip? Will We were throwing you a big surprise party.
SUPMALE:Oh, you were? I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we was just gonna have dinner.
LEADFEMALE:A cleverly orchestrated ruse, bub.
LEADMALE:And to think, I laid out 50 big ones on your damn cake.
LEADFEMALE:And not just any cake.
OTHERMALE:I got you that really neat one in the commercials.
LEADFEMALE:The one that 
SUPFEMALE:Carlton.
OTHERMALE:All right, okay.
LEADMALE:Look, I said I'm sorry, all right? Well, look, I know somebody that wants to hear about my snowball fight with Denzel.
LEADMALE:Yo, Hil!
LEADMALE:Will, no!
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Hil!
SUPMALE:Will, no, no! Don't go up there!
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:Ashley, what is wrong with you? Will, I don't think Hilary wants to see you right now.
LEADFEMALE:Why, what did I do to her? You made her miss her appointment with Sergai.
LEADMALE:She had to settle for his assistant.
SUPFEMALE:So what? Damn.
SUPFEMALE:And I mean that in the nicest possible way, Hil.
OTHERFEMALE:I look like a troll doll.
OTHERMALE:Hilary, don't you think you're overreacting just a tad? Sleep with one eye open.
OTHERMALE:Look, come on, guys.
LEADMALE:Cut me some slack here.
SUPMALE:Now, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if you had a choice between an ordinary yet very thoughtful birthday party, and hitting the slopes with a superstar which one would you choose? You mean, which superstar would I choose?
SUPFEMALE:Well, if I had to
SUPMALE:Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:Michelle Michaels may not feel as serious about all this as you do.
LEADMALE:Does that look like she's playing, Aunt Viv? She gave it to me in Aspen.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are you going? She's taking me to see the fight in Vegas.
SUPFEMALE:What about the fight party you excluded me from? You got the guys coming over to watch it on TV.
OTHERMALE:You know, I'm glad you reminded me, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, make sure they don't let you in, okay? And there's the end of round one.
SUPFEMALE:This is better than watching the fights with my Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
SUPMALE:Hey, now, how could I not be enjoying myself? I got Vegas, you, me a black dude and a white dude beating each other.
SUPFEMALE:Life is good.
LEADFEMALE:Here, let me grab us a little something here.
LEADFEMALE:Michelle, I got to tell you ever since the barbecue at Wesley Snipes' crib I kind of been wanting to say something to you.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't found a way to say it quite yet.
LEADMALE:But this thing we got going on, I just feel real good about it, you know.
OTHERMALE:And I just Hey, hey, hey! Hello, who is this?! Rick Benton.
LEADFEMALE:We shot a swimsuit video in Tahiti.
OTHERMALE:This is Will Smith.
OTHERFEMALE:Guy? Michelle, Michelle.
SUPMALE:You know, you're even more alluring with your clothes on.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't he the funniest male model you ever met? Oh, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Now I recognize this dude.
LEADMALE:I take it you've seen my calendar, huh? Yeah, you were the April fool, right? Look, guy, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Michelle is a one-man woman now, all right?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really?
OTHERMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:You might be able to tell by this ring she gave me.
SUPFEMALE:It kind of reminds me of this one right here.
SUPMALE:So are we all friends now? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:We found out we had a lot in common.
SUPMALE:Look, black Fabio, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you and your Motown-revival haircut go back to your seat shave your chest, shut up and just watch the fight.
SUPFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:What?
OTHERFEMALE:Round 2.
LEADFEMALE:Are you squaring off on me, fool? What you gonna do? What you gonna do? Poor Rick.
LEADFEMALE:He'll be in the hospital for weeks now.
LEADFEMALE:How did I know he was gonna fall on Sinatra? I think you overreacted.
LEADFEMALE:What am I supposed to do with a dude putting his hands all over my woman? Look, besides, he deserved it.
LEADFEMALE:He stole one of your rings.
LEADMALE:Will, I gave him that ring.
LEADFEMALE:You did? Yeah, I did.
LEADFEMALE:I give out a lot of rings.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm saying, this one you gave me is the last one though, right? I just gave one to the paramedic.
LEADMALE:I was wondering why he was taking your pulse.
LEADMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:You're so adorable.
LEADFEMALE:But I think we need to take some time off.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna play slots.
LEADMALE:I'll be back in an hour.
LEADMALE:Will.
SUPMALE:Sit.
LEADFEMALE:It's been fun.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, "been"? I'm no good with relationships.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you knew.
LEADMALE:Don't you listen to my songs? Well, yeah, I do.
SUPFEMALE:Okay Why? All right.
SUPFEMALE:There's "Untouchable.
LEADFEMALE:" There's "Never Going To Settle.
LEADFEMALE:" There's "Wham Bam Goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:" Come on.
SUPMALE:This isn't goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:You only say goodbye to people you're never gonna see again.
SUPFEMALE:This is more like see you later.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll see you later, Will.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Michelle.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:It was a hell of a fight last night, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, champ ain't no joke, right? I was referring to your bout.
LEADMALE:They showed that on TV? From the first shove to when Sinatra put his toupee back on.
SUPFEMALE:There ain't gonna be no rematch.
SUPFEMALE:When dude get out of the hospital, he can have her.
SUPFEMALE:She dumped you, right? Man, you crazy? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, it was a nice ride while it lasted, huh? You know what, Uncle Phil? I think I loved her.
LEADFEMALE:Bull.
SUPFEMALE:You hardly even knew her.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil, I knew her.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? I knew her.
SUPFEMALE:You might have known her intimately.
SUPMALE:But you didn't know her well.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, face it, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:It was the lifestyle you're in love with.
LEADMALE:Time out.
LEADFEMALE:You trying to say that the only reason I loved her was because she was rich and let me sponge off of her? Then I love you too, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe you guys did this.
LEADFEMALE:We waited an hour and a half.
LEADMALE:What's a couple more days?
SUPMALE:We even saved Sunny the Seal for you.
SUPFEMALE:Really, where? 
LEADFEMALE:
