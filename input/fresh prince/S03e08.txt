LEADMALE:We're somewhere in the galaxy.
LEADMALE:My father has no idea where.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil, I'm telling you, I think we should just pull into a gas station.
SUPFEMALE:Will, for the last time, I don't need directions.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:You need gas.
LEADMALE:Okay, I made a wrong turn.
OTHERFEMALE:It's no big deal, it's not the end of the world.

LEADFEMALE:The only people that's going to stop is going to have on sheets and saying stuff like, "Get them, Jim Bob.
LEADFEMALE:" Will may have a point, Dad.
SUPMALE:Why don't we stay here and let him go get the gas? We're all getting out of the car.

SUPMALE:Let's get out of the car.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of the car.

LEADMALE:Let's look on the bright side, okay? This will give us a perfect opportunity to pull together and show what we're made of.
LEADMALE:Does Bigfoot have to come down here with a chain saw before you admit we're in trouble? Okay, we can't stay here, we'll freeze to death.
LEADMALE:Just get all the stuff out of the back seat.
LEADMALE:We'll go ahead on foot.

SUPMALE:My florist is on vacation.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my.
OTHERMALE:You look beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you put this on ice?
LEADFEMALE:Champagne?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What are we celebrating? An empty house.
LEADMALE:Yoo-hoo! I thought this was your day off.
LEADFEMALE:Correct, but you overlooked one fact.
SUPFEMALE:I have no life.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, will you get it?
SUPMALE:On my day off? You'd really let me? Well, I thought we'd have a quiet evening together and I'd make you dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Trevor, that is so sweet.
LEADMALE:All right, now.
SUPFEMALE:You get out of the kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:I want this to be a surprise.
SUPFEMALE:Surprise! Jazz, what do you think you're doing? Looking after you, my pet.
SUPMALE:After all, you're a beautiful, desirable woman.
LEADFEMALE:Or you would be if you combed your hair once in a while.
LEADMALE:And some lipstick wouldn't kill you, either.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jazz, go home.
LEADFEMALE:Stand back.
SUPMALE:Let a man handle this.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here?
LEADFEMALE:I'm cooking dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Good, I like my steak medium-rare.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to freshen up a bit.
LEADFEMALE:Get off me! Would you See, a cave.
LEADFEMALE:Told you everything would be all right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was trying to scare the bears away.
LEADMALE:Carlton's log.
LEADFEMALE:I'm wet.
LEADFEMALE:I'm wet and I'm cold.
LEADFEMALE:I'm wet and I'm cold and I'm in a cave.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I'm shutting up.
SUPMALE:I'm shutting up and I'm wet.
LEADMALE:That's it!
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Just relax! Look, come on.
OTHERMALE:Now, we'll build a fire.
LEADFEMALE:How are we supposed to build a fire, Uncle Phil? It's snowing outside.
LEADMALE:All the wood is soaking wet.
LEADMALE:Then we'll freeze to death.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to die.
LEADFEMALE:I want to go to college and poke fun at all the kids on financial aid.
LEADFEMALE:I want to see Karate Kid 17.
OTHERMALE:Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you check the cave for dry wood.
LEADMALE:Man, I ain't walking around in this cave by myself.
SUPMALE:There's rats and bats and bears and stuff all over the place.
LEADFEMALE:Me, neither, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:I think the three of us should just cuddle up close together for the night.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to go check the cave for some wood.
SUPMALE:I found this bag, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Will, we can't just burn a bag.
LEADMALE:We're helpless, it's over, we're dead.
LEADMALE:We're rich!
SUPMALE:What? Hey, back up, back up! $25,000.
SUPMALE:Do you all mind if I get butt naked and roll around in this for a little while? Will, we're going to have to turn that money over to the authorities.
LEADFEMALE:If nobody claims it, then you can keep it, but until then, I think I should look after it.
LEADMALE:Whoa, no! I'm all right, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I'll just find a safe place to keep it, you know, just for the night.
SUPFEMALE:Goodnight, Abe.
LEADFEMALE:Goodnight, Alexander.
LEADMALE:And I can't forget you, Ben.
SUPMALE:Man, I'm sleeping with the presidents.
SUPFEMALE:Must be what Marilyn Monroe felt like.
LEADFEMALE:What's for dinner? Jazz, I told you to go home.
SUPMALE:How fast were you going when you hit this? Now, see here, homey.
OTHERMALE:My lady and I are trying to have an intimate moment.
LEADMALE:Oh, I get it.
OTHERMALE:You're trying to make me jealous.
LEADMALE:Well, it worked like a charm.
LEADMALE:Beat it, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:How dare you talk to me like that? Do you have any idea who I am? A really bad cook? Trevor, could you excuse us for a moment, please? I have never been so insulted in my life.
LEADMALE:Blind people recognize me.
LEADFEMALE:I could kill you.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, baby, hurt me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I am not going to let you screw this up for me.
SUPMALE:Trevor is a wonderful man.
LEADMALE:But I'm Jazz, the lover of all lovers.
LEADFEMALE:I put the "afro" in aphrodisiac.
SUPMALE:So lose the stiff, and I'll be waiting in the pool house.
LEADMALE:And fix yourself up a little.
LEADMALE:What happened to your friend? Don't worry about him.
LEADFEMALE:What are you watching? One of those silly sentimental films, formula stuff.
SUPMALE:Can I watch with you? Sure.
OTHERMALE:But I have to go home in a few minutes.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to alarm either one of you but it's about 20 degrees in here, and it's only going to get worse.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton's log.
SUPMALE:I hate Dad.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this wood is just too wet to ignite.
SUPMALE:We need something dry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm afraid it's going to have to be something that's near and dear to all of us.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil, at least knock him out first.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about the money, Will.
LEADMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:Do you want to die with $25,000 by your side or do you want to live to see tomorrow? I'm thinking, I'm thinking, all right?
LEADMALE:I'm afraid there's no other choice.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, can I just have a few minutes alone with the guys? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:When you throw that money into the fire if I lose my head and leap in after it you'll pull me out, right? Son, there are more important things in life than money.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but I can't get a date, either.
LEADMALE:All right, here's the money.
LEADFEMALE:What?
OTHERMALE:Was that Andrew or Ben?
OTHERMALE:It was Ben.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Ben.
LEADFEMALE:You was one of the few white people I could really count on.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton's log.
OTHERFEMALE:Will has been reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self.
SUPMALE:I, on the other hand, have the strength of 10 men.
LEADFEMALE:Will's log is about to connect with Carlton's head! Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, Will, give me the log.
LEADFEMALE:That's not why I brought you two up here.
LEADFEMALE:I really blew it.
SUPFEMALE:All I wanted to do was spend some time with you before you went off to college.
LEADFEMALE:You know, there was a better way of doing it, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps a matinee and a box of Raisinets.
SUPFEMALE:Raisinets? I hate Raisinets.
LEADFEMALE:Can we get some Goobers? It's not the same.
LEADMALE:Some of the best memories of my life are camping with my father.
OTHERFEMALE:He taught me how to hunt and fish, how to pitch a tent.
SUPMALE:I'm guessing he didn't teach you how to use a compass.
LEADMALE:Now that he's gone I really miss him.
LEADFEMALE:I really appreciate what we had together.
OTHERMALE:He was quite a man.
LEADMALE:I learned so much from him.
SUPMALE:That's decent, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:At least you had somebody to teach you stuff, you know? I had to learn everything on my own.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, my mom was working all the time and everything.
LEADMALE:Like, I wanted to roller skate but, you know, I didn't even really know how to do it.
SUPMALE:So I used to put on one skate and push with the other foot.
LEADMALE:Never seemed like I could be fast enough to keep up with the other kids, though.
LEADMALE:You know, actually that's how I felt when I came to Bel-Air, you know? It's like everybody had two skates, and I was trying to keep up with one.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for my other skate, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:For a long time it gave me nightmares having to witness an injustice like that.
LEADFEMALE:It was a constant reminder of how unfair this world can be.
LEADMALE:I can still hear them taunting 
OTHERFEMALE:"Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids.
SUPFEMALE:" How come they just couldn't give him some cereal?
SUPMALE:You guys, wake up.
SUPFEMALE:Wake up.
LEADMALE:Whoa, man.
LEADMALE:We made it.
LEADMALE:We made it.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, wake up.
OTHERMALE:Vivian, I'm not a machine! Come on, Dad, it's morning.
SUPFEMALE:What do you know, it stopped snowing.
OTHERMALE:Come on, let's get the hell out of here and find a Denny's.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, if I ever agree to go camping with you all just hold my head underwater till I stop struggling.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go now.
SUPMALE:Congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:What's up?
LEADMALE:Right this way, guys, right this way.
OTHERMALE:Come right over here.
SUPFEMALE:Right over here.

SUPFEMALE:What did we do?
LEADFEMALE:And was it legal? Homey, we was going to give the money back, man, but my uncle Give it back? It's yours to keep.
LEADMALE:See, you just found the last clue in the KCBE scavenger hunt.
LEADMALE:You found the prize money.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now tell me something, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:How does it feel to be rich? Terrible.
LEADMALE:Uncle Backdraft made us burn it.
SUPMALE:You burned $50,000?
LEADFEMALE:$50,000? You said it was $25,000.
SUPMALE:I must have miscounted.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well.
