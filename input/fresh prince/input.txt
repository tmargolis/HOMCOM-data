SUPMALE:Uncle Phil! Man! How are you doing? I am not your uncle Philip.
OTHERMALE:My fault, man.
SUPFEMALE:I must have got the wrong crib.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't know there were so many brothers living in this neighborhood.
OTHERFEMALE:We're doing all right, huh? You have the right house.
LEADMALE:I am Geoffrey, your uncle's butler.
SUPMALE:Okay, well, I Cheerio and all that rot.
LEADFEMALE:Bring the horses round, would you? If you will follow me I will show you to your room, Master William.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, man, it's cool if you just call me Will.
LEADFEMALE:Master William tradition dictates that a clean, unbreakable line be drawn between a family and their butler.
SUPMALE:Therefore, it is necessary for the operation of a household that you address me as Geoffrey and I, in turn, address you by your proper 
LEADMALE:Master William.
SUPFEMALE:Who are you, Robo-butler, man? Come with me, Master William.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, G.
SUPFEMALE:Let me rap to you for a second.
OTHERFEMALE:All this Master William stuff, I'm not down with that, man.
OTHERMALE:Make it sound like we're back on the plantation, 
SUPFEMALE:"Massa William! Massa William!" Let's come up with something better that you could call me.
SUPMALE:What would you prefer? Check 
SUPMALE:"His Royal Freshness." That's dope.
LEADMALE:Master William, walk this way.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Willie!
LEADMALE:Hey, Aunt Viv!
LEADFEMALE:Sweetie, hi.
LEADMALE:How you doing? My goodness, let me look at you.
SUPMALE:Turn around.
LEADMALE:The last time we saw you, you were this funny little boy.
LEADFEMALE:Now look at you.
LEADFEMALE:My goodness, you are a man.
LEADMALE:That was the plan.
SUPMALE:It is amazing.
LEADMALE:You certainly have grown, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we all have.
SUPFEMALE:Did you enjoy the trip? The plane ride was stupid.
SUPMALE:All the way first-class Excuse me?
SUPMALE:I'm saying the plane was dope
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? No.
SUPMALE:Stupid, dope No, that doesn't mean what you How would he say The flight was really neat.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, would you take Will to his room, and help him get settled in?
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Madam.
LEADFEMALE:Nice seeing you.
LEADFEMALE:Master William.
OTHERFEMALE:You got to love this guy, right?
LEADMALE:Did you see the way he was dressed?
LEADMALE:What's wrong with it?
SUPFEMALE:You hear that language?
SUPFEMALE:We used slang when we were kids.
SUPMALE:Do you remember our first date? You took one look at me and 
OTHERMALE:"That is a bad dress.
LEADMALE:" You could've just said it was a good dress.
LEADMALE:I could have, if I liked it.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it was a bad dress.
OTHERFEMALE:That's stupid.
LEADMALE:Now, take it for whatever meaning you want.
SUPMALE:Now he's got you doing it.
OTHERMALE:Philip, cut him some slack, please.
SUPMALE:He's my nephew.
SUPMALE:And I would just appreciate it if you would try to understand him.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Hi, sweetie pie.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, this place is huge, man.
LEADFEMALE:Next time I go to my room, I'm gonna take some bread crumbs.
SUPMALE:Will, this is Ashley.
LEADMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:My little Scottish cousin.
LEADFEMALE:Pleased to make your acquaintance.
OTHERMALE:I'm your humble servant.
LEADFEMALE:He's cute.
LEADFEMALE:I know he is.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna take a swim before dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck.
OTHERFEMALE:The pool heater's broken.
LEADMALE:Don't you just hate it when that happens?
LEADMALE:Yes, that is my pet peeve.
LEADFEMALE:You got your own pool here?
SUPMALE:And a tennis court, too.
SUPMALE:Yo, this is better than Love Boat.
SUPMALE:This boy gonna be maxing and relaxing.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold on just a minute, son.
LEADMALE:We promised your mother that you're here to work hard, straighten out and learn some good old-fashioned American values.
LEADMALE:Dad, I need $300.
LEADMALE:Hilary, your cousin Will is here.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, I need $300.
LEADFEMALE:That's a lot of money, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:What for? I need a new hat.
LEADFEMALE:For what?
LEADMALE:Probably her head.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'm going on the Save the Ozone celebrity bus next Saturday.
LEADMALE:It's gonna be Bruce Willis and Demi, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez or Charlie Sheen, I can't remember which.
LEADMALE:We're taking the bus all over town to protest air pollution and then we're gonna motor to the beach and have a big bonfire.
LEADMALE:What? I'm not an expert or anything, but don't you think driving a big old bus around town and then having a bonfire is sort of adding to the problem of pollution? Look, if this weren't a good idea I really don't think Ally Sheedy would be involved.
SUPMALE:Hey, look who's here.
LEADMALE:Benson.
LEADFEMALE:This is for you.
LEADFEMALE:But I didn't get you anything.
SUPFEMALE:Your uncle has invited several of the partners from his law firm to dinner.
SUPFEMALE:At the time of the invitation, he did not realize you'd be descending upon him today.
SUPFEMALE:And regrettably, it was too late to cancel.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, are we having a party? We're gonna get stupid, right? For some of us, that will require very little effort indeed.
LEADFEMALE:Miss Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:That will be all, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:That's all you had to say to get rid of him? I've been racking my brain.
LEADFEMALE:This is for you.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Ashley.
OTHERMALE:This is nice.
SUPFEMALE:You're very talented.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm glad I'm good at something.
OTHERMALE:I tried out for the school chorus today, but I didn't get in.
SUPMALE:How come? Well, when I auditioned for Mrs.
LEADMALE:Berkley I couldn't remember all the words to the song.
LEADMALE:The part I remembered was fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure it was.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you're def.
LEADMALE:That's what she said.
LEADMALE:Not deaf.
LEADMALE:D-E-F.
LEADFEMALE:That's just slang.
SUPFEMALE:Means terrific, good.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You should try rapping.
LEADMALE:When you're rapping, you mess up the words and make up some new ones right there on the spot.
SUPMALE:Let's try this.
SUPFEMALE:I'll sing one line, you make up a line to rhyme it.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see.
LEADMALE:"You didn't get into Miss Berkley's chorus"
SUPMALE:I'm thinking, all right?
LEADFEMALE:That's all right.
LEADFEMALE:We got all day.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I've got it.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
SUPFEMALE:"You didn't get into Miss Berkley's chorus" "I'd like to hit her in the head with Roget's Thesaurus" "Don't need no choir when you're a rapper" "Gonna hunt Miss Berkley down and zap her" "Got this whole town of Bel-Air buzzing" "Get a load of me and my rapping cousin" Ashley, why don't you go downstairs and get ready for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Bye, Will.
SUPMALE:Check you later, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:Look who's here, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Who is he? It's your cousin, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Don't you remember? When you two were little, people thought you were twins.
LEADFEMALE:You looked exactly alike.
LEADMALE:I guess some things never change.
OTHERFEMALE:How's it going there, Will?
LEADMALE:It's going all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Malcolm X.
LEADMALE:He's sort of my hero.
LEADMALE:Well, he was a great man.
LEADMALE:I don't know if I'd call him my hero exactly.
SUPMALE:Really? Who are your heroes?
LEADFEMALE:Well, my dad.
SUPFEMALE:And Bryant Gumbel.
LEADMALE:He's darn good.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my, yes! I see they brought your tuxedo.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me something, Will.
OTHERMALE:Have you ever attended a formal dinner before? Other than that thing at Buckingham Palace, no.
OTHERFEMALE:The important thing to remember is to relax, enjoy yourself and when in doubt, do whatever Carlton's doing.
LEADMALE:You got it, man.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'll see you at dinner.
LEADFEMALE:That's a really neat tux, isn't it, Will?
OTHERMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's definitely the cat's meow.
SUPFEMALE:Wait till we come downstairs in those tuxes.
LEADMALE:People may not think we're twins, but I bet they'll think we're brothers.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think you have to worry about anybody mistaking you for a brother.
LEADMALE:Touch√©.
SUPFEMALE:This is going to be great.
LEADMALE:Your first formal dinner.
LEADFEMALE:And tomorrow, I'll introduce you to the gang.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we'll play a set of tennis or two.
LEADMALE:Yes, this is going to be wild.
LEADFEMALE:Where is he?
LEADFEMALE:He's upstairs changing.
LEADMALE:Not Will.
LEADFEMALE:President Reagan.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't?
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean, I didn't?
LEADFEMALE:You invited him again.
SUPMALE:Why not? He's our neighbor.
SUPFEMALE:He's turned down the last 16 invitations.
LEADMALE:When are you gonna take a hint?
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe I should call his house.
SUPMALE:Don't.
LEADMALE:I don't want him here.
LEADMALE:Why not?
SUPMALE:Because he'll bring her.
LEADMALE:Anyway, Bruce, Demi and I all feel that the ozone layer must be protected.
SUPMALE:I mean, every square foot of rain forest that's cut down brings us just one step closer to global warming.
LEADFEMALE:We have to learn to protect the earth.
OTHERMALE:Not just for ourselves and not just for our children but for the future of all mankind.
LEADMALE:I had no idea it was such a serious problem.
LEADMALE:I really commend you for getting involved in such a good cause.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:It's my passion.
SUPMALE:Where can I send a donation?
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God! Philip, don't make a big thing out of it.
OTHERMALE:If this is how he feels comfortable He's not killing anybody.
OTHERMALE:Aren't you going to introduce Will? Introduce him.
SUPMALE:Well, Steve, David, Henry.
LEADMALE:This is Will, my nephew by marriage.
SUPFEMALE:Will, these are my partners in the law firm of Furth, Winn and Meyer.
SUPFEMALE:Earth, Wind & Fire! When's your next album coming out? Will is going to go to Bel-Air Academy with Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Good for you, Will.
SUPFEMALE:I used to fence at Bel-Air.
SUPMALE:Really? How much do you think we could get for that stereo? These hors d'oeuvres look tempting.
LEADMALE:Don't mind if I do.
LEADMALE:How could you do that?
OTHERMALE:It's all in the tongue.
LEADMALE:I'll show you later.
SUPFEMALE:There are other people at this table.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:Any requests?
LEADMALE:Sweetie, would you say grace, please?
OTHERMALE:Yes, Mommy.
LEADMALE:"Hey, there, Lord My name is Ashley Banks "My family and friends Want to give you some thanks "So before this dinner's All swallowed and chewed "Thank you, God, for this stupid food" Hey, Geoffrey, home butler.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad to see you, man.
LEADMALE:It is a special thrill for me as well.
OTHERMALE:Check this out.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna be down here for a while.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you hop on in the kitchen and get me some cocoa? Master William while it is my natural inclination to accede to your every demand I officially go off duty at 9:00 p.
SUPMALE:m.
SUPFEMALE:And if you care to look at your watch, you will note that the long hand is on 12, and the short hand is on 9.
LEADFEMALE:It is 9:00, Master William.
LEADFEMALE:And do you know what that means? Masterpiece Theatre is on.
LEADMALE:Sir, do you require anything further of me? No, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Then I shall retire.
LEADFEMALE:Man, he took that hard.
LEADMALE:I want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:About what?
LEADFEMALE:You know.
LEADFEMALE:From the minute you came, you've been a one-man wrecking crew trying to tear down what's taken a lot of hard work to build up skewering everything with your flippant shenanigans! Man, I was with you up till "skewering.
SUPMALE:" You know what I'm talking about.
LEADMALE:You deliberately tried to embarrass me tonight and I don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:Your aunt and I went through a lot of trouble to bring you here.
LEADMALE:This is the thanks we get?
LEADMALE:I ain't asked to come.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone's talking about shipping me off, and dressing me up and changing me into something I don't wanna be.
OTHERMALE:Nobody wants to change you.
LEADFEMALE:You told me yourself I got to straighten out.
SUPMALE:"When in doubt, act as Carlton acts.
LEADMALE:" Man, I don't wanna be like Carlton.
OTHERMALE:I'm a joker.
SUPFEMALE:I play around.
LEADMALE:I have fun.
SUPFEMALE:Being a joker is what's gotten you into trouble.
LEADMALE:You may think it's cool to be on the streets when you're 17 but when you're my age, it's a waste.
LEADMALE:I can't think that far ahead.
SUPFEMALE:That's your problem.
LEADFEMALE:You can't take anything seriously.
LEADMALE:Look, man, I don't have the problem.
LEADFEMALE:You have the problem.
LEADMALE:I remind you of where you came from and what you used to be.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, somewhere between Princeton or the office, you got soft.
SUPMALE:You forgot who you are and where you came from.
LEADMALE:You think you're so wise.
SUPFEMALE:Look at me when I'm talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you something, son.
LEADMALE:I grew up on the streets just like you.
LEADMALE:I encountered bigotry you could not imagine.
LEADMALE:Now, you have a nice poster of Malcolm X on your wall.
LEADFEMALE:I heard the brother speak.
LEADFEMALE:I read every word he wrote.
SUPMALE:Believe me, I know where I come from.
LEADMALE:You actually heard Malcolm speak, man?
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:So before you criticize somebody, you find out what he's all about.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll take care of you in the morning.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to bed.
OTHERMALE:Hold on.
LEADFEMALE:I can't tell my side of the story? No, you can't.
LEADMALE:I know what you're all about.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, the very thought of it makes me very tired.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, my fly girl, Ashley Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Would you teach me how to dance?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Not in here.
OTHERFEMALE:Even I lose my rhythm in this room.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Could you do me a favor?
LEADMALE:Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:I seem to be missing a Walkman.
SUPFEMALE:So if it shows up anywhere, like, I don't know, on your head, maybe maybe you could get that to me.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:Dad won't let me get one.
LEADFEMALE:How come? He says he wants to hear everything I'm listening to, to make sure it's not bad.
OTHERMALE:What record does he think is good?
SUPFEMALE:He really likes the Care Bears.
SUPMALE:Ash, from time to time, your father's gonna say or do things that may seem irrational or hard for you to understand.
LEADFEMALE:It's not because he's mean, or a bad guy, or that he doesn't care about you.
LEADFEMALE:It's that he's from Mars, Ashley.
LEADMALE:I gotta get washed up.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
OTHERMALE:I'm really glad you're living here.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Ash.
LEADMALE:You're like the big brother I never had.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? You got You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I see your point.
OTHERMALE:How many bathrooms you got in this place? Four and a half.
LEADMALE:A half bath? How does that work? It doesn't have everything a full bathroom has.
LEADMALE:You better show me a full bathroom.
SUPMALE:I don't want to take no chances.
LEADFEMALE:Next bathroom.
OTHERFEMALE:Can't a person gargle in peace? Hilary, are you gonna be in there for long or is this just like a pit stop? Stop hounding me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to take off my makeup.
LEADFEMALE:Now, go away.
LEADMALE:Okay, good night, Hilary.
SUPMALE:I knew it! 
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Today, sir, I thought we might begin the day with an aspirin preventative medicine being so much the mode.
SUPFEMALE:It's too late, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:I already have a headache just anticipating that infernal hammering at the office.
LEADFEMALE:I thought the workmen were supposed be done by yesterday.
LEADMALE:Shockingly enough, Vivian, they're behind schedule.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, it's so obvious.
SUPMALE:If all that hammering is bothering you, just tell them to quit it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even want to talk about it.
SUPFEMALE:These are the only moments of peace and quiet I'll have all day.
OTHERFEMALE:Another aspirin, sir? Perhaps a gun.
SUPFEMALE:What the devil is he doing up there? I Got The Power by Snap.
LEADMALE:Snap is a great band.
LEADMALE:When Crackle and Pop cut a disc, then call me.
SUPFEMALE:What's so funny?
LEADMALE:Carlton told a joke.
LEADMALE:No, Hilary.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton is a joke.
SUPFEMALE:Mommy, who's gonna take me to my tennis lesson after school today? Are you sure it's tennis today? Maybe you'd better check your schedule.
SUPMALE:Schedule? My parents bought me this calendar so I could keep my lessons straight.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't you have a schedule for after school at my age? Yeah, the TV Guide.
SUPMALE:See, Monday is for ballet, Tuesday is riding, Wednesday is violin.
LEADFEMALE:I thought today was violin, sweetie pie.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean Ashley would have shown up for her violin lesson in her tennis outfit? I just pictured it.
SUPMALE:I'm two for two.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to quit while I'm ahead.
LEADFEMALE:May I suggest retirement? Keep them coming, Will.
LEADMALE:So, Mommy, who's going to drive me? There's a growing pollution problem in this city, and I will not contribute to it.
LEADMALE:I absolutely refuse to drive anybody anywhere until a responsible car pool is organized.
LEADMALE:But, Hilary, Ashley is in a car pool.
LEADMALE:I just don't want to do it, okay? I have an idea.
SUPMALE:Will, you don't have any chores this afternoon.
SUPFEMALE:You can drive Ashley.
SUPMALE:Word up.
OTHERFEMALE:Kick over the keys to the Jag.
LEADFEMALE:The Benzito?
LEADFEMALE:The station wagon.
OTHERMALE:Come on, you're gonna ruin my rep.
OTHERFEMALE:You're only 17.
SUPFEMALE:You don't have a rep yet.
SUPMALE:You'll drive her to her class, wait for her there, and bring her home.
LEADMALE:Come on, I got to sit through a hour of them scratchy violins? You might learn something.
SUPFEMALE:The same thing I learned from banging my head against a 
SUPMALE:Don't do it again.
LEADFEMALE:This is your new job.
SUPFEMALE:Wednesdays you are Ashley's driver.
LEADFEMALE:Understood? Yes'm.
OTHERMALE:I'll be more than happy to drive you to the Piggly Wiggly, Miss Daisy.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Ladies, hold it.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Let's try something different.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody just repeat after me, okay? Come, girls! You are late.
SUPFEMALE:Now let's begin with the piece you were to memorize from Stravinsky's Violin Concerto in D minor.
LEADFEMALE:And remember, you are playing this for a woman who was the great Stravinsky's lover.
LEADMALE:One, two, three, four.
LEADMALE:Faster! Stop! You, there.
LEADMALE:What you do here? I'm Ashley's cousin.
LEADFEMALE:I was just waiting to drive her home.
LEADFEMALE:You make me kind of nervous with that stick, lady.
LEADMALE:You dare to read while great Stravinsky is played? I wasn't as tight with the man as you were.
LEADMALE:Do not attempt to make joke with me.
LEADMALE:I was lover of both Laurel and Hardy.
OTHERFEMALE:Guess that look really works for you then.
LEADMALE:Hey, Ash, that was decent to listen to that kind of music without having to see Freddy Krueger kill somebody.
LEADMALE:I'm glad somebody enjoys it.
LEADFEMALE:What, don't you? Not yet, but when I'm older, it will be very useful to me.
LEADMALE:No, wait.
LEADFEMALE:That's tennis.
SUPFEMALE:Who told you that?
LEADMALE:My dad.
LEADMALE:Just because your dad likes something, doesn't mean you have to like it.
LEADMALE:He likes being a lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to be a lawyer.
LEADMALE:I am going to be a lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:Ash, the world does not need another Philip Banks.
SUPFEMALE:We might not have enough farmland to support the one we have.
LEADFEMALE:No, the world needs an Ashley Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Girls, you must remember to practice more, no? Violin is very jealous, much like the sexy Toscanini.
SUPMALE:If you even look at another, it will not speak to you for days.
LEADMALE:But if you give all of yourselves, it will fulfill your every need and set your very soul on fire.
OTHERFEMALE:What does she mean by that? Let's just say that lady expects a lot from a piece of wood and some strings.
LEADMALE:Your aspirin, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:Do you attribute your headaches, sir solely to the ongoing construction in your office or do you suppose there might be a stress factor involved? This is how my day went, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:At 9:00, they were pounding.
LEADMALE:At 10:00, they were jackhammering.
LEADFEMALE:By noon, a pneumatic drill came into play.
LEADFEMALE:And, Geoffrey, they were just repainting the office.
LEADFEMALE:I'd say that's cause for stress.
OTHERMALE:Wouldn't you? You know, sir, the Earl of Cranbrook to whom I was in service for several years suffered from the most severe headaches.
SUPFEMALE:And you're saying these were caused by some sort of stress? I should very much doubt it.
OTHERFEMALE:He spent his days riding to the hounds, and his evenings attending rather pleasant dinner parties with his delightful wife, Lady Celia.
OTHERMALE:Now, she was a terribly good snooker player, one of the best.
SUPFEMALE:One night, she bet
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Where does the stress come in? It certainly doesn't in Lord Cranbrook's case.
LEADFEMALE:I never saw a calmer household.
OTHERFEMALE:Then what was the point of the story? Sheer entertainment, sir.
SUPFEMALE:What the devil was that? I believe the technical term is a "rim shot.
LEADFEMALE:" Who did it? Utter speculation, of course, but my guess is Master William.
LEADMALE:Ashley, honey where is your violin?
SUPMALE:Big Sal has it.
SUPFEMALE:Big Sal? He owns this great store where you don't need any money.
LEADFEMALE:You just go in and give him something you don't even want anymore
LEADMALE:and he gives you this ticket.
LEADFEMALE:Then
LEADFEMALE:A pawnshop?
LEADMALE:You took her to a pawnshop?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, it was really hard, too.
LEADMALE:You don't have many pawnshops in Bel-Air.
LEADFEMALE:That's really a shame.
LEADFEMALE:I had to go all the way to East LA.
SUPFEMALE:East LA?
SUPMALE:They gave me a great deal.
SUPFEMALE:They gave you a set of drums.
LEADMALE:And I made them throw in a little gift for each of you.
SUPMALE:Close your eyes.
SUPMALE:Vivian!
SUPFEMALE:I want my present.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, open.
SUPMALE:What a lovely antique necklace.
SUPFEMALE:What is this?
LEADMALE:Daddy, it's a diamond.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it isn't.
SUPFEMALE:You don't like it?
LEADFEMALE:No, I do not.
LEADFEMALE:Can I have it? How dare you pawn her violin!
SUPFEMALE:She don't even like playing it no more.
LEADFEMALE:She will learn to like it later.
SUPFEMALE:A young woman who can play a violin is an accomplished young lady.
OTHERFEMALE:A girlie that can play the drums can write her own ticket.
LEADMALE:Will, I want the best for Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:When I was a kid, I loved classical music, but my parents couldn't afford lessons.
SUPMALE:I used to stand out in the parking lot of the Philharmonic hoping to catch a spare note on the night air.
LEADMALE:Philip, when I met you, you were into James Brown.
LEADMALE:He liked James Brown?
LEADFEMALE:He even wore his hair like him.
LEADFEMALE:He had hair? You know, it is possible to like both classical music and James Brown.
SUPMALE:I could not agree more.
SUPFEMALE:So let's let Ashley play whatever she wants.
LEADMALE:She spent an entire year on the violin.
SUPFEMALE:So if she wants to try something new, let her.
LEADFEMALE:You tell him, Aunt Viv.
SUPFEMALE:And as for you, young man
SUPFEMALE:Love you.
OTHERFEMALE:The next time you decide to visit a pawnshop, don't.
SUPFEMALE:Are we clear on that?
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Master William, there is a young gentleman downstairs with a rather large radio who is here to see you.
SUPFEMALE:He claims his name is Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, word up.
LEADFEMALE:Send him up.
LEADFEMALE:Now, who is this Jazz fellow?
SUPFEMALE:I heard the boy at a club.
LEADMALE:He was all of that.
LEADFEMALE:He will be Ashley's new music teacher.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, he's not as experienced as Madame Chatchka, but then who is? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz.
LEADMALE:It's nice to meet you, Jazz.
OTHERMALE:How do you do? I'm Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks.
OTHERMALE:You got that right.
LEADMALE:Man, you're loaded! Yo, what's up, J.
LEADFEMALE:? Come on, let's just leave them alone.
SUPFEMALE:I asked him to take her to her lesson
LEADFEMALE:I know, baby.
SUPMALE:Tell Mama all about it.
LEADMALE:Ash, how about let Jazz get busy one time? So, Carlton, how's the soccer scene? Well, I may be moving up from JV to Varsity, but Am I the only one who finds this drumming inappropriate for high tea? I can't take another week of this.
LEADFEMALE:From morning until night all I hear is this relentless, pulsating, thumping beat.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to the Hard Rock Cafe.
LEADMALE:Hilary.
SUPMALE:Stay.
SUPFEMALE:We are having tea.
LEADMALE:It's a civilized way for me to have a conversation with my family so someone talk.
LEADMALE:I want her severely punished! It was the only time that Jazz could give her a lesson today.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish you would stop calling him that.
LEADFEMALE:But that's his name.
OTHERFEMALE:It is not.
SUPFEMALE:It can't be.
LEADFEMALE:These kids like to make up their own names.
LEADMALE:Let them.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:From now on, I'm no longer Philip Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Just call me King Edward IV.
LEADMALE:As you wish, Your Majesty.
LEADMALE:Humor, sir.
LEADMALE:Dad, I'm as liberal as the next guy but it's time for someone to take the reins.
LEADFEMALE:High tea has been a weekly tradition in our family for as long as I can remember.
OTHERMALE:If we let young Will ruin this for us, what's next to go? Christmas? I can't answer that question for you, son.
OTHERMALE:Ask your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you two.
LEADFEMALE:High tea is not a sacred institution.
SUPFEMALE:It's not the tea.
LEADFEMALE:It's not the drums.
LEADMALE:It's Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:I've spent nine years trying to raise a proper young lady and Will is undoing all of my work in a week.
OTHERMALE:Ashley, honey, come down here!
SUPMALE:What are you doing? He's punishing her.
LEADFEMALE:No, Hilary, I just want her to spend some time with her family.
SUPMALE:Same thing.
LEADMALE:What is all this yelling about downstairs? Look, we are trying to give a music lesson upstairs.
SUPMALE:Work with me, people, please? You've been practicing all afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Look, that is the only way she's gonna become a star.
SUPFEMALE:This young lady has the drive, the good look, and the intelligence to get to the top but she will not be on Yo! MTVRaps if you all don't work with me.
LEADFEMALE:Practice is over, Will.
LEADMALE:Ashley, honey, it's teatime.
SUPMALE:Tea.
LEADMALE:Biscuits! Geoffrey, put on our teatime music, please.
LEADFEMALE:You'll love this, honey.
SUPMALE:It's Brandenburg Concertos.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz, hit me with some sugar, man.
OTHERFEMALE:How about a little milk?
LEADMALE:No, I'll get it.
SUPFEMALE:I thought this was sterling.
LEADMALE:It's got that certain weight to it.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:This is my favorite part.
LEADMALE:Ashley, honey, this is possibly the most beautiful music ever written.
LEADMALE:Would someone turn it up for me, please?
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, crank it up for me.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Listen, darling.
SUPMALE:Listen to the violins.
LEADFEMALE:Beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:The oboes will be coming next.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey, would you tell Miss Ashley I'd like to speak to her? Right away, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I know you're upset, but I want you to stay calm.
LEADFEMALE:I'm calm.
LEADMALE:I'm happy.
OTHERMALE:I'm in control.
OTHERMALE:You see, Vivian, I had lost control.
SUPMALE:"Lost control"? You drop-kicked a human being across our front lawn.
LEADFEMALE:It felt good, damn it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm back in the saddle again.
LEADMALE:You know, I think living down the street from the Reagans has had a very bad effect on you.
LEADFEMALE:Will, your uncle just wanted to speak with Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:No, let him stay.
LEADFEMALE:I want him to hear this, too.
LEADFEMALE:I hope this isn't going to be one of those Theo moments.
OTHERMALE:Ashley, honey, sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, baby through no fault of your own things went down a very wrong path this week.
LEADFEMALE:But luckily, your daddy has put it all back together.
LEADMALE:You're going to return to the violin.
SUPFEMALE:I've called Madame Chatchka.
LEADMALE:She's agreed to give you a makeup lesson.
SUPMALE:You must have caught her on one of her rare free nights.
SUPMALE:Will, please? We've all lost sight of the most important thing here and that is what is best for Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:It's not what's best for Ashley.
SUPMALE:You're trying to control her.
OTHERMALE:She's 9 years old, and she's got a calendar telling her where she's got to be, what she's gotta do.
OTHERMALE:She doesn't have to worry about that anymore because now you tell her what to do, right? There's only one thing wrong with 
SUPMALE:You're not her father.
SUPMALE:How come you didn't know she doesn't like the violin? She liked it for a year before you moved in.
LEADMALE:Can you explain that?
SUPMALE:I never liked it, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:That explains it.
LEADMALE:Look, if you ask her, she'll tell you she wants to play the drums.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like the drums, either.
SUPMALE:See? Now you confused her.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not confused.
OTHERFEMALE:I just didn't want to disappoint you, Will.
LEADMALE:And I didn't want to disappoint you, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Now hold on.
LEADMALE:Let's get this straight.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, you don't have to please Will, and you don't have to please your father.
OTHERMALE:You just continue with the lessons that you like best.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mean it, Mommy?
LEADFEMALE:Absolutely, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Then I want to quit ballet.
LEADMALE:Ballet? Honey, no.
LEADMALE:But you look so cute in that little tutu.
OTHERMALE:I really hate it, Mommy.
SUPMALE:But, honey, just until Christmas? Do you believe that?
SUPFEMALE:She wants to quit everything.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:These kids today have no attention span.
LEADFEMALE:I blame television.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:What dog did he steal that sweater from? Probably his wife.
LEADFEMALE:Good God, who shot the couch? Give her a break, Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:She just won the Kentucky Derby.
SUPMALE:Who's that lady with Nell Carter? That's not Nell Carter.
LEADMALE:That's my father! God, you're so shallow.
LEADMALE:I hate you.
LEADMALE:You're stupid and ugly and I wish you would die.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Look at her! Brake! Hit the brake, Will!
OTHERMALE:What in the hell are you doing?
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It ain't my fault.
LEADMALE:I panicked.
OTHERMALE:That squirrel came out of nowhere.
LEADMALE:Philip, I'll call the manager and have him remove the cart.
OTHERMALE:Oh, let's just draw more attention to ourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Get in the cart, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks, but no golf carts in the dining room.
LEADFEMALE:You've certainly made a name at this country club.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't be surprised if they revoked our shuffleboard privileges.
SUPMALE:That's fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:This place is wack.
SUPMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Hold up.
OTHERFEMALE:Special bulletin.
LEADMALE:Hormones to Will.
LEADFEMALE:Hold up yourself, Will.
LEADMALE:That's Mimi Mumford.
LEADFEMALE:You can't get to first base with her unless you impress her father.
LEADMALE:He's an eminent surgeon, a championship polo player and around these parts, he's known as Dr.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Why do they call him that?
LEADFEMALE:Because he never says "yes.
LEADMALE:" No young man is good enough for his daughter.
LEADMALE:He ain't gonna have a chance to tell me no 'cause I ain't gonna ask.
LEADMALE:Mimi, if you're not busy on Friday night would you like to accompany me to the Apple Blossom ball? No.
LEADMALE:What's your name, boy? What school do you go to? What college are you applying to? What's your career plans? I'm just a sophomore, sir.
SUPFEMALE:I don't really know yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Out of here, son.
LEADFEMALE:You disgust me.
SUPFEMALE:So, what kind of guy does Dr.
LEADFEMALE:No say yes to? Fellas with good grades, good manners, good looks.
LEADMALE:In a word, me.
OTHERMALE:So why haven't you made your move on Miss Mimi? Not my type.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't tickle my fancy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she can tickle mine.
SUPMALE:If only wishing made it so.
LEADFEMALE:Let's face it, Will.
LEADMALE:You lack the social graces to impress someone like Dr.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Boy, you must be on dog food.
SUPFEMALE:I am the most handsome, the most intelligent and unequivocally the most flamboyant bachelor since Billy Dee.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't West Philly, Will.
LEADMALE:It's Bel-Air.
LEADFEMALE:And the women here are different.
OTHERMALE:I guarantee you Dr.
SUPMALE:No will say no.
SUPMALE:Yeah? I bet he won't.
SUPFEMALE:I bet he will.
LEADFEMALE:I bet he won't.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bet he will.
SUPFEMALE:Who says the art of conversation is dead? All right, Will.
LEADFEMALE:You think you can be a gentleman? How do you propose on going about it? Carlton, it's very easy to be a geek.
LEADFEMALE:All I have to do is follow you around for a day.
LEADMALE:It isn't as easy as it looks.
LEADMALE:And with your father's permission I'd love to escort you to the Apple Blossom ball.
OTHERMALE:I had no idea you two were getting along so well.
LEADMALE:What's going on here, Carlton? Will's got a thing for Mimi Mumford so I'm teaching him how to be a perfect gentleman.
SUPFEMALE:I want a piece of this.
SUPMALE:Observe, Will, this is how a perfect gentleman talks to a young lady.
SUPFEMALE:"Say there, Mimi "might I say that you rate a perfect 10 on my niftiness meter?" I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil, how did you used to crack on the girlies? What I'm about to tell you is going to change your life forever.
LEADFEMALE:Are you listening?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:First, I take her hand then I stroke it gently but imperceptibly Iook deep into her eyes, blow gently in her ear let my mouth curl up into a smile make a low, rumbling, hypnotic sound.
LEADMALE:Philip, that's what you did on our first date.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:You're lucky you got a second one.
LEADFEMALE:Allow me, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Certainly, Geoffrey, if you think you can do any better.
LEADMALE:Mademoiselle.
SUPFEMALE:My life was but a mere whisper until you entered into it.
LEADFEMALE:Whether it was chance or blind fate or kismet, if you will, that brought us together I would be remiss to let this moment pass without telling you how deeply you have affected the very core of my being.
LEADFEMALE:Baby!
SUPMALE:The fish knife.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
OTHERMALE:No, it is right.
LEADMALE:He got it right.
OTHERMALE:He got it right!
LEADFEMALE:He did? Get your own geisha.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, Master Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:You were saying?
LEADMALE:Will, he picked out the fish knife.
LEADMALE:Will, I want you to pay very close attention.
SUPFEMALE:Which one is the shrimp fork? By george, I think he's got it.
LEADFEMALE:I think he's got it.
LEADFEMALE:Where did he get that jacket? Probably off the rack.
LEADMALE:Did you hear about his Jaguar?
SUPFEMALE:The one he bought secondhand? Okay, just remember you're from Connecticut you're transferred to Bel-Air Academy, and you row on the crew team.
SUPMALE:Now, where did you transfer from? Bend over.
LEADFEMALE:It's Andover.
LEADMALE:We're going back home.
OTHERMALE:I was joking, man.
LEADMALE:Relax.
LEADFEMALE:Hook it up.
OTHERMALE:I beg your pardon, Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Mumford.
OTHERFEMALE:I have a friend who's new in town.
LEADMALE:He's the new star on the crew team.
OTHERMALE:Would you like to meet him? No.
SUPMALE:I respect your wishes, sir but I'd just like to say kudos on that polo match.
SUPFEMALE:Super form.
SUPMALE:You saw it, huh? Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't get your name.
SUPMALE:Smithers, sir.
SUPMALE:Kip Smithers.
LEADMALE:Have a seat, Smithers.
OTHERMALE:May I join you, sir?
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:What school do you go to? What college have you applied to? What's your career plans? Bel-Air Academy, Princeton, and thoracic surgery, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Thoracic surgery.
LEADFEMALE:That's my field.
SUPFEMALE:What aspect of it interests you the most? The cutting part.
LEADFEMALE:That's the part I like, too.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I'm glad you're a fan of polo.
OTHERMALE:I have a very fine string of Arabians.
LEADMALE:Really? With turbans and everything? Very funny, Smithers.
LEADMALE:You had me there for a moment.
LEADMALE:I thought you were a blithering idiot.
LEADMALE:There's my daughter.
OTHERMALE:Would you like to meet her? Gosh, sir.
SUPMALE:There's a big question mark on that one.
SUPFEMALE:I seem to be painfully shy with the fairer sex.
LEADMALE:Nonsense.
LEADMALE:Hi, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Poodles.
LEADMALE:There is someone I'd like you to meet.
LEADMALE:Mimi, Kip Smithers.
LEADMALE:Varsity crew from Bel-Air.
LEADFEMALE:A gentleman and a scholar and soon to be a fine surgeon.
LEADMALE:You flatter me, sir.
SUPMALE:I'll just leave the two of you alone.
LEADFEMALE:Mimi
LEADFEMALE:Look, before you get yourself all worked up into a lather, I just would like to say this.
SUPMALE:I am sick of you white-washed, preppy stuffed shirts.
LEADFEMALE:What? I don't need some stooge who's going to play up to my father.
LEADMALE:I want a real man.
LEADFEMALE:Someone dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:Someone exciting.
SUPFEMALE:Someone from the streets.
SUPMALE:What's so funny?
LEADMALE:Yo, baby.
LEADMALE:Your prince is in effect, baby.
LEADMALE:I'm not down with this preppy nonsense.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton told me to do this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm definitely straight out the 'hood.
SUPMALE:That was the worst homeboy act I've ever heard.
LEADFEMALE:It's not an act.
LEADFEMALE:It's the real deal.
LEADMALE:Yo, C! Come here! Mimi.
OTHERFEMALE:Kip.
SUPMALE:Carlton, would you please tell her who I really am?
LEADFEMALE:Who you really are?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:He's Kip Smithers, from Connecticut.
LEADMALE:He transferred from Andover to Bel-Air, so he could row with the crew.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her where I'm really from.
LEADMALE:England? For future reference, Will, our club frowns on strangulation.
LEADFEMALE:This is all your fault.
LEADMALE:You got me into this mess.
SUPFEMALE:Me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah! This preppy nonsense.
SUPMALE:I knew women didn't like that mess.
SUPFEMALE:If I would've had my way, I would've had my way.
OTHERMALE:Congratulate me.
OTHERFEMALE:It took all day but I finally found the perfect pair of alligator pumps to wear to the Save the Everglades rally tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Will has a crush on Mimi Mumford.
OTHERMALE:That fat girl? Mimi is not fat.
SUPMALE:Not today.
LEADMALE:Liposuction.
LEADFEMALE:She's been vacuumed more times than a hooked rug.
LEADMALE:She looks good now, right? I don't see your point.
OTHERFEMALE:Just wave a chili-cheese dog in front of her nose and see how much of your arm you come back with.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:So, how did it go with Mimi Mumford? He struck out.
SUPMALE:Okay, Will, you've taken advice from Carlton, from Philip, and Geoffrey but you have not gone to the most logical 
OTHERMALE:the woman of the house.
LEADMALE:Before I was married, I had my share of admirers.
OTHERMALE:A sorrier bunch of deadbeats you'll never meet.
LEADMALE:The ones that I was most attracted to were the ones who were secure enough to just be themselves.
SUPFEMALE:And that's my advice to you.
LEADMALE:Just be yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Aunt Viv.
OTHERMALE:So, Will, are you going to take Mom's advice? Man, you got to be crazy.
SUPMALE:Mimi wants a street-wise, Harley, bad-to-the-bones type guy, man.
SUPFEMALE:If I could show her that I'm dangerous, I'll have her like that.
SUPMALE:I'll bet you wouldn't.
LEADFEMALE:I bet I would.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet you wouldn't.
SUPFEMALE:I bet you wouldn't.
LEADMALE:I bet you would.
SUPMALE:See, I fooled you.
OTHERMALE:Remember, I'm wanted in five states I'm hiding out from the police for robbing a gun store
OTHERMALE:and what did I do before then?
LEADMALE:You went to Penn State.
LEADMALE:I went to the state pen.
OTHERMALE:Sorry.
SUPMALE:I thought Penn State was bad enough.
SUPMALE:Mimi, top of the evening.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, for the 900th time, no, I will not go out with you.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you said she wasn't your type.
LEADMALE:She isn't.
LEADFEMALE:She's too negative.
SUPMALE:I'm not here for that.
LEADFEMALE:Although if you just gave it some objective thought Anyway, I'm here for him.
LEADMALE:Does he need to go to the bathroom? No, he's just being his bad self.
LEADMALE:What you saw before was just a charade.
LEADFEMALE:Kip is his street name.
OTHERMALE:K-l-P.
LEADFEMALE:It stands for conceived in prison.
LEADFEMALE:He's my cousin and he's from the Bedford-Stuyvesant region of Brooklyn wherein he is a felon.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Then what's he doing here in Bel-Air? He's living with us to escape, and I quote, "the man.
SUPMALE:" Voila.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you said he rode crew.
LEADMALE:No, baby.
SUPMALE:You misunderstood.
SUPMALE:He said I wrote for the 2 Live Crew.
LEADMALE:But, see, they kicked me out because my lyrics was too abrasive.
LEADMALE:He's as nasty as he wants to be.
SUPFEMALE:I kid you not.
LEADMALE:Baby.
SUPFEMALE:You look so good I wish I could plant you and grow a whole field of y'all.
LEADMALE:Yo, baby, Fresh Prince in full effect.
OTHERFEMALE:It's time to get busy.
OTHERMALE:You can't hay, can you, baby? You work on that, all right, baby? Salutations, Doctor.
OTHERFEMALE:This is quite an intense shindig, huh? Listen, I just want to find out how things are going with Mimi.
LEADMALE:I'm having a little trouble breaking the proverbial ice, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I hope I don't embarrass myself, being in your illustrious presence and all.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'll just make myself scarce but, I do have one piece of advice.
LEADMALE:Be yourself.
SUPFEMALE:That's a natch, sir.
SUPMALE:This music is def, exceptionally def.
LEADMALE:Carlton, beat it! I'm dope.
SUPFEMALE:Yo.
LEADFEMALE:What were you talking to my father about? I told him if he don't stay out my face, we would take it to the street.
LEADMALE:Baby, you close your eyes when you dance with me.
LEADFEMALE:Salutations yet again, Doctor.
LEADMALE:Just a thought.
SUPMALE:Mimi loves horses and you love polo I thought that might break the ice.
LEADMALE:Thanks for the prescription, Doc.
SUPFEMALE:Enough said.
LEADFEMALE:What were you talking to my father about this time? I wasn't listening to him, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:I was stealing his wallet.
LEADFEMALE:Kip, I'm so sorry I didn't believe you before.
OTHERFEMALE:I should have seen right through that thin charade.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go someplace and get busy.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, ma'am.
LEADFEMALE:But first, I want you to rap for me.
LEADFEMALE:What? You know, let me hear some of them abrasive lyrics.
LEADMALE:Okay, baby.
LEADFEMALE:This one I got banned in Buffalo for.
LEADMALE:And that is just the type of music we will not let our children listen to.
LEADMALE:Smithers, what is the meaning of that ridiculous hat? Who put this on my head? Daddy, isn't he funny? No.
SUPMALE:He disgusts me.
SUPMALE:Get out of my sight.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You can't talk to him like that, Daddy.
OTHERMALE:He's practically a convicted killer, and I love him.
LEADFEMALE:A convicted killer? Who are you? All right, look.
SUPMALE:I'm not a young republican from Connecticut and I'm not a hood from Bed-Stuy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Will Smith from West Philly and I've been busting my butt all night trying to impress you and trying to scare you.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm exhausted.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going home, and I'm going to sleep 'cause, baby, ain't no girl that fly for me to go through all this trouble for.
LEADMALE:Yo, baby.
LEADMALE:What's up? Miss Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:Did you have a good time at the Save the Everglades fund raiser? Geoffrey, these events are not about having a good time.
LEADFEMALE:They're consciousness-raising experiences.
LEADMALE:When you hear about all of the species that are on the brink of extinction it's grim, grave, and very sobering.
OTHERMALE:Tom Cruise was near tears.
OTHERFEMALE:Wasn't he gorgeous? So there I was, G, then this real fly honey walked by, right? So I decided I'll just be myself.
LEADMALE:I said, "Yo, baby.
SUPMALE:" And she loved me!
SUPMALE:Then what happened?
LEADMALE:Well, then her husband came in.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Shall I continue to delay dinner, madam? Yes, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know where he is.
LEADMALE:He's never late without calling.
LEADMALE:Do you think Daddy's all right?
SUPMALE:It's awfully late, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, let's not jump to any conclusions.
LEADFEMALE:We're all worried, but let's Bill Cosby has a streetwise niece coming on his show.
LEADFEMALE:That should be decent.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm home.
LEADMALE:Daddy.
OTHERMALE:Philip, where have you been?
SUPMALE:I was at the office.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I didn't call, but I wanted to rush home with the great news.
LEADMALE:What is the highest recognition a self-made Black professional can receive? A raise! No, darling, it's not a raise.
LEADMALE:I'm getting the Urban Spirit Award.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, we're so proud of you.
LEADMALE:Is it a cash award? Hilary, don't be so shortsighted.
SUPMALE:This award is an honor which leads to prestige which leads to cash.
SUPMALE:The community leaders are recognizing me for helping our brothers and sisters on the streets.
LEADMALE:The only time you're on the streets is when you're waiting for the valet to bring your car around.
SUPFEMALE:Is that so, son? Let me tell you something.
LEADMALE:The '63 March on Washington? I was there.
OTHERFEMALE:The '65 demonstrations at Selma, I was there.
SUPFEMALE:The '65 Watts Riots, I was there, too.
LEADMALE:Seems to me every place you go, trouble follows.
LEADFEMALE:Your uncle deserves this award.
SUPFEMALE:He's fought a lot of discrimination cases.
SUPFEMALE:He's prosecuted slumlords.
LEADMALE:He's started scholarship funds.
OTHERFEMALE:All that and he still found time to vote for Reagan.
SUPMALE:Twice.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:It wouldn't be bad if you could remember some of that when the reporter gets here.
LEADFEMALE:Reporter?
LEADMALE:Photographer? New dress.
LEADFEMALE:All right, you can have a new dress.
SUPFEMALE:I want you all to look your best for the newspaper interview and the awards banquet.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, this is wonderful.
LEADMALE:Two new dresses.
LEADFEMALE:Have you called your parents? You bet.
LEADFEMALE:They're taking the next plane out.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma and Grandpa are coming to visit.
LEADFEMALE:Toys.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:Come on, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:Rock this funky joint, baby.
LEADMALE:Come on, Ash.
LEADMALE:Less like George Michael, more like Hammer.
SUPMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:Baby, you got to put some more butt into it.
SUPMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, but Grandma and Grandpa are here.
OTHERMALE:I just saw the cab pull up the driveway.
OTHERMALE:Grandpa.
LEADMALE:Sweet potato.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, sweetie.
LEADMALE:My, how you've grown.
SUPMALE:Hilary, sweetie.
OTHERFEMALE:My, how you've grown.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, sweetie.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, Grandpa, this is my cousin Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Will.
LEADMALE:Your uncle told us all about you.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Hattie.
LEADMALE:He don't look like the devil incarnate.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:So, how was the flight from Baltimore?
SUPMALE:Baltimore?
OTHERMALE:That's where Uncle Phil's from, right? He moved there when he was 16, but he was born and raised in Yamacraw.
LEADFEMALE:Yamacraw?
LEADMALE:North Carolina.
LEADMALE:I can't believe Zeke never mentioned his hometown.
LEADMALE:Zeke? Mama.
SUPMALE:Pop.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Uncle Zeke.
LEADFEMALE:Give your old man a hug.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Pop.
LEADMALE:Am I tripping, or does this remind you of the last episode of Family Ties? Daddy, didn't I send you money for a new suit? You're looking at it.
LEADMALE:When you sent that money me and my buddy Leroy went down to the dry goods store and we each got a suit, a fishing rod, and some radial tires.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I better get to fixing supper.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:This is what I'll be needing.
LEADFEMALE:"One pound of lard "four handfuls poke greens "and a big old slab of fatback.
LEADFEMALE:" Now, if it comes to more than $1, they're cheating you.
SUPFEMALE:We are going to have pork chops, collard greens baked macaroni, and sweet potato pie.
SUPFEMALE:Have mercy! Grandma, Grandpa, you want to go see our swimming pool? That's a good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Growing up, my Zeke always did love our swimming hole.
SUPFEMALE:He would strip down to his birthday suit and dive right in.
LEADMALE:Granny, please.
SUPFEMALE:It's almost dinnertime.
SUPFEMALE:He just loved his skinny-dipping, him and Melvin.
LEADFEMALE:Melvin.
LEADMALE:I don't think we want to hear anything Au contraire, Dad.
LEADMALE:The Melvin stories are priceless.
SUPFEMALE:So, Melvin was like his best friend?
LEADFEMALE:Melvin was his pig.
LEADFEMALE:I have plenty stories about my Zeke.
LEADMALE:Are any of them humiliating stories?
LEADMALE:The best ones are.
LEADMALE:Let's start with those.
SUPMALE:It's 3:00 in the morning, Will.
LEADMALE:How did you see me?
LEADFEMALE:Mama knows.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Granny, please don't tell Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just a little bit past my curfew.
LEADMALE:How much is a little? Let's just say I went out after I was supposed to be in.
LEADFEMALE:Don't do it again.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing up so late? Child, I had to get up and get breakfast started.
SUPMALE:I don't know what you all got that Geoffrey for.
LEADFEMALE:Five-card draw?
SUPMALE:Yeah, I'm with it.
LEADFEMALE:Granny, I really like you.
LEADFEMALE:You and Grandpa, you have fun.
OTHERFEMALE:You tell jokes.
SUPMALE:You all bust me up.
LEADMALE:Thank you, son.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look, Granny, it's late, everybody's asleep.
LEADFEMALE:You can level with me.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil's adopted, right? Now, we're real proud of Zeke.
SUPMALE:Did you know he won the Young Farmers of America Pig Raising trophy? No, I didn't know that, but I'd love to have some details about that.
LEADMALE:Won it four years running.
LEADFEMALE:They had to retire his slop bucket.
LEADMALE:Slop bucket? I can't wait till he wakes up.
LEADMALE:Respect your elders, son.
OTHERMALE:See, I beat you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, he was the first Black president of the Young Farmers.
SUPFEMALE:Was that like a big thing?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my, yes! I beat you again.
LEADMALE:You know, then, we also had those White rest rooms? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I remember this one time we was downtown and Zeke had had too much lemonade and suddenly he just lit out from me and split right into that White rest room.
OTHERMALE:They told him to leave, but little Zeke just stood his ground.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil did that? Look here, I beat you again.
SUPMALE:All right, that reporter's going to be here any minute.
LEADMALE:Does everybody remember what they're supposed to say?
LEADMALE:Hilary?
LEADMALE:Yes, Daddy.
OTHERMALE:Ashley?
SUPFEMALE:Yes, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Vivian? What is this, the von Trapp family? I'm not about to parrot compliments for the benefit of some reporter.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not be naive, Vivian.
OTHERFEMALE:I've dealt with the press before.
LEADMALE:If you don't rehearse what you're going to say, they eat you alive.
LEADMALE:Carlton? At the forefront of the civil rights movement.
LEADMALE:You were asleep, son.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:All of Grandma's pies last night and waffles this morning.
SUPMALE:I just crashed.
LEADMALE:I've got the sugar blues.
SUPFEMALE:I'm this close to a crying jag.
LEADMALE:Ms.
OTHERMALE:Melissa Klein, sir.
LEADFEMALE:LA Press, "Urban Beat.
LEADMALE:" I'd like you to meet my family.
OTHERMALE:My wife Vivian my son Carlton, my daughters Hilary and Ashley.
LEADMALE:Pleased to meet you.
OTHERFEMALE:So where's the photographer?
LEADFEMALE:Your father sent a picture in already.
OTHERMALE:Am I in it?
LEADMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADMALE:Am I pretty? Let's begin the interview, shall we? Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks, you're best known as the lawyer who won the landmark housing discrimination case Winston vs.
SUPFEMALE:Jones but our readers want to know about Philip Banks the man.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I really don't like to blow my own horn.
LEADFEMALE:Growing up on the mean streets of Baltimore, Maryland Philip Banks overcame great obstacles to win a scholarship to Princeton University in 1963.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Hilary, Princeton was the turning point in Philip Banks' life.
SUPMALE:It was then that he developed an interest in law and distinguished himself as a fine student earning himself a place at Harvard Law School.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:But did you know that Philip Banks, in addition to becoming a partner of the prestigious law firm of Furth, Wynn, and Meyer remained active in the field of civil rights culminating in his crowning achievement in 1975 when he was elected to the board of the ASPCA.
LEADFEMALE:ASPCA? I think Ashley means NAACP.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry, Daddy.
LEADMALE:After living in Bel-Air, it was great to spend time at Disneyland to get back to reality.
LEADMALE:Joe, it's 7:30.
LEADMALE:We're getting to be a couple of night owls.
LEADMALE:Yes, ma'am.
SUPFEMALE:We better go put ourselves to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I'm with you.
SUPMALE:Good night, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Feature desk, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Jake? Melissa.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm having second thoughts about this Philip Banks piece.
LEADMALE:It's just one long, boring r√©sum√©.
LEADMALE:For a while there, I thought I had an angle about the ASPCA but that turned out to be a blind alley.
SUPMALE:I'm telling you, this man's life is boring.
OTHERMALE:His own son kept nodding out.
OTHERMALE:We better kill the story.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Hold up, lady.
SUPMALE:My uncle has been looking forward to this all week.
SUPMALE:If you kill that story, he's gonna get mad.
LEADFEMALE:If he gets mad, the heat comes down on me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, kid.
LEADFEMALE:You got to wake up and smell the java.
SUPMALE:Your uncle's dull.
LEADFEMALE:Dull! Dull? Sweetheart, that's one thing my uncle is not.
LEADFEMALE:Max out, lady.
LEADMALE:I got a couple of stories for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, dear.
LEADMALE:Good, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:You got the paper.
LEADMALE:Yes, madam.
LEADFEMALE:Make sure you buy the 100 copies that Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks wanted.
LEADFEMALE:Before we make such an investment, perhaps it might be wise for you to peruse the contents of this article.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, dear.
OTHERMALE:Geoffrey, how on earth did they get a hold of all these stories? Madam, the press is made up of a very low type of person.
LEADFEMALE:You see what they've done to Fergie.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian, is it in the morning paper?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:You got the paper.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you have your morning coffee first, sir? That's perfect.
OTHERMALE:I'll have my coffee, and you can read it to me, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:"Local lawyer wins prestigious award.
LEADMALE:" It goes on from there.
LEADMALE:Goes on to what?
LEADFEMALE:Just details, really.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just recycle this.
LEADFEMALE:Give it to me.
LEADFEMALE:"The coveted Urban Spirit Award "given to Los Angeles' outstanding Black leaders "will be presented tonight to distinguished attorney Philip Banks.
SUPFEMALE:" This is well-written.
SUPFEMALE:"Known to his barnyard companions as Zeke "Banks is no stranger to accolades.
OTHERFEMALE:"This ex-hog-handler "slopped his way to the top with the help of his trusted companion "Melvin the pig.
SUPFEMALE:" Who is responsible for this? Hey, Uncle Zeke.
SUPFEMALE:I got your 100 black and whites.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:How did they get all these stories about the pig? All right, I wasn't going to tell you, but
LEADMALE:You!
OTHERMALE:Will, honey run.
LEADMALE:What did I do?
LEADMALE:What did you do?
SUPFEMALE:You destroyed my image.
LEADMALE:I didn't destroy nothing.
SUPMALE:Of course you did.
SUPMALE:Look at that story.
LEADFEMALE:I have to walk into that banquet room tonight filled with people who'll think I'm nothing but a hog-handling hick from Yamacraw.
LEADFEMALE:But that is where you come from, Zeke.
SUPMALE:Mama.
LEADMALE:I was just having a few words with Will.
SUPMALE:And I'm having a few words with you.
SUPFEMALE:What have you got to be ashamed of? We always put food on the table and clothes on your back.
OTHERMALE:Mama, I'm not ashamed.
SUPMALE:There are just certain aspects of my life I don't wish emphasized.
LEADFEMALE:Where I come from they call that being ashamed Mr.
LEADMALE:Big Shot! Mother, you look very nice in your dress tonight.
LEADMALE:Did you enjoy the limousine ride, Pop?
LEADFEMALE:You bet.
LEADFEMALE:I went Hattie, aren't you going to talk at all? Come on.
LEADMALE:We're mature adults.
LEADMALE:Refusing to speak won't solve anything.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not talking to you.
LEADMALE:Philip, Vivian, congratulations.
SUPMALE:Yes, we're all quite proud of you at the office, old man.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like you to meet my parents.
SUPFEMALE:Hattie and Joe Banks, Henry and Margaret Furth.
OTHERFEMALE:Ma'am, would you like the salmon or chateaubriand? We don't want to be a bother.
LEADFEMALE:We'll just hang on to these empty plates.
LEADMALE:Thank you kindly.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure you don't want any of the food? We don't want to impose.
LEADFEMALE:We'll just fade into the background.
LEADMALE:Breast or wing?
LEADMALE:I think I'll have a wing, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Got any okra casserole?
LEADFEMALE:Coming up.
SUPMALE:Granny.
LEADFEMALE:You know how much Uncle Phil likes his mama's okra casserole.
LEADMALE:Why don't you ask him if he wants some?
LEADFEMALE:It ain't going to work, Will.
SUPMALE:What is this interesting m√©lange? It smells divine.
SUPFEMALE:Just plain old okra and tomato, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Try that, Henry.
SUPFEMALE:Outstanding.
SUPFEMALE:Do we have any biscuits? I hope they're still hot.
OTHERMALE:Can I say something please? I just know that at a time like this my uncle Phil is extremely happy to have his two loving parents here with him.
LEADMALE:I can feel the love at this table.
LEADFEMALE:Parents? To hear him tell it, he just sprung full-grown from the ground and we had nothing to do with it.
LEADMALE:Yes, he just sprung up like a big old eggplant.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you Philip Banks?
SUPMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:You're the hog-slopping lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:I saw your picture in the paper this morning.
LEADFEMALE:Is Melvin going to be here tonight? No, Melvin eschews these type of events.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the same way.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing in here, Uncle Phil? Is this for your own information, or will this be in USA Today? Come on, I'm sorry I made you mad.
LEADMALE:The reporter was gonna trash the article until I gave her those pig stories.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Everyone loves those amusing little agricultural anecdotes.
SUPFEMALE:I guess it never occurred to you that they'd make me look like a fool.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, your plaid golf shorts make you look like a fool.
SUPMALE:Those stories make you look great.
OTHERMALE:You did a lot for Black people that I didn't even know.
LEADMALE:I raised a pig for the Young Farmers Association.
SUPMALE:Puts me right up there with Martin Luther King.
LEADMALE:You were the first Black president.
LEADMALE:That's something.
SUPFEMALE:And what about the Whites only rest room? In case my mother didn't make it painfully clear I wasn't trying to prove a point.
LEADFEMALE:I went in there because I really had to go.
LEADFEMALE:I see a whole lot of that.
LEADMALE:I mean, look, Uncle Phil, it's just like Rosa Parks.
OTHERMALE:When she sat in the front of the bus, she wasn't doing it to prove a point either.
SUPFEMALE:She did it 'cause her feet hurt.
LEADFEMALE:They told her to leave, and she didn't.
LEADMALE:Neither did you.
LEADFEMALE:I must be kidding myself.
LEADMALE:I had it all planned out.
SUPFEMALE:There was my family, all lined up to meet the press.
LEADFEMALE:There I was, with my perfect image.
LEADFEMALE:Philip Banks pulled himself up from the streets with his own bootstraps.
SUPFEMALE:The only problem was, I didn't have it that hard.
LEADMALE:I had two parents who loved me and were always there for me and worked hard to make sure I'd have everything they never had.
LEADMALE:I mean, why are you worried so much about your image? The truth sounds real good to me.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think my mother will ever forgive me.
LEADMALE:Man, you must be tripping.
LEADFEMALE:Granny's great.
LEADMALE:Just explain it to her.
SUPFEMALE:Will, there's something you have to learn.
LEADMALE:Sometimes parents just don't understand.
LEADMALE:In addition to the civil rights cases he has won as an attorney Philip Banks is a community leader, an unsparing philanthropist and a role model to all citizens.
OTHERFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, Philip Banks.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I grew up on the streets of Baltimore.
LEADFEMALE:But I was born on a farm in Yamacraw, North Carolina.
LEADMALE:I was one of the lucky ones.
LEADFEMALE:I had two wonderful parents who worked hard every day of their lives.
LEADFEMALE:They couldn't give me a lot of material things but they gave me morals, courage and most important of all, love.
LEADMALE:I just hope I can give the next generation what my parents gave me.
SUPFEMALE:I hope he mentions his pig.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, have you seen Will? Master William sits in his room sadly staring out of the window, madam quiet as a church mouse.
LEADMALE:Hasn't spoken a word for hours.
LEADMALE:What a shame.
LEADMALE:Poor homesick baby.
SUPFEMALE:I have an idea.
SUPFEMALE:If Will is that homesick, let's send him home.
LEADMALE:All he's been talking about is Philadelphia.
LEADFEMALE:I hope these Philadelphia cheese steaks cheer him up.
SUPMALE:I don't know what you and Will see in those vile concoctions.
SUPFEMALE:Which is why you only ate five of them? Will, we know you're homesick, so we got you something to cheer you up.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks a lot.
OTHERFEMALE:What is it? It's a sandwich composed of cheese, steak, and a croissant de boulanger from the Caf√© Antoinette in Beverly Hills.
LEADFEMALE:It's a Philadelphia cheese steak, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Nice try, Uncle Phil, but this is not a Philadelphia cheese steak.
OTHERFEMALE:See, look at the bag.
LEADMALE:No grease stain.
LEADFEMALE:If this were authentic, you could see right through the bag by now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry you don't like it.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll dispose of it later.
LEADFEMALE:I'll throw it out.
LEADMALE:I'll dispose of it, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:You know where you get the best cheese steaks in Philly? Pat's Steaks on Passyunk Avenue.
LEADFEMALE:Me and my buddy Ice Tray used to go there every Friday.
LEADFEMALE:We used to steal I mean, we would enjoy them there often.
SUPMALE:Ice Tray? Isn't he the one you're always talking about? Did I ever tell you about the story in the middle of the winter? Ice Tray grabbed onto the back of a bus and it was so cold, his face got stuck.
LEADMALE:And he was dragged around the city.
LEADFEMALE:He couldn't get off till he hit a bump on the Ben Franklin Bridge.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a story we can all relate to.
LEADMALE:Cut it out, Philip.
LEADMALE:He misses his friend.
SUPFEMALE:Ice Tray's more like my big brother, though.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a good idea.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we fly him out for a weekend visit? You mean it, Aunt Viv? I'm down with that.
LEADFEMALE:Word up.
SUPMALE:This is gonna be cold stupid on the serious tip.
LEADMALE:What did you say, young lady? I said that this is quite an exceptional idea, Daddy.
LEADMALE:Peachy-keen, even.
LEADFEMALE:Later, my man.
LEADFEMALE:Wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:First Will, now Ashley.
SUPMALE:I can't wait till Ice Box gets here.
LEADMALE:No, it's Ice Tray, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Ice Tray.
SUPFEMALE:I apologize.
SUPFEMALE:Ice Box would be an idiotic name.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it would.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Viv, this is going to be great.
SUPFEMALE:I can't wait to show him all the strange sights of L.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even know where to begin.
LEADMALE:I'll take him to Disneyland, to Marineland
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, I need $200.
SUPFEMALE:I'll take him to Hilaryland.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you need $200, Hilary?
SUPMALE:For books.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm changing my major.
LEADFEMALE:To what?
OTHERFEMALE:Communications.
LEADMALE:Exactly what does that entail? You know, it's like communications.
LEADFEMALE:It's, like, the study of communicating, okay?
SUPMALE:Why do you want to major in that?
LEADFEMALE:Because I'm good at it.
SUPMALE:So I presume this is the official Ice Tray greeting party.
LEADMALE:Tray!
SUPMALE:Prince! Homey, get in there.
SUPFEMALE:Guys, you're going to hurt each other.
SUPFEMALE:That's okay, Vivian.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see where this goes.
LEADMALE:Ice Tray, we didn't hear you come in.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, did you leave the door open?
SUPMALE:Well, no.
LEADMALE:I guess we must have left it unlocked.
SUPMALE:"Well, no.
LEADFEMALE:" You still got it, man.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, I'm Vivian, Will's aunt.
LEADFEMALE:Will, why don't you introduce Ice Tray to your family? I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:This is my little cousin Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:This is my bodyguard, Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:All of this is my Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Remember we used to say that Daffy Duck must have a little brother somewhere? Meet my cousin Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Can't touch this.
OTHERMALE:Geoffrey, would you take Ice Tray's luggage to his room? Certainly, madam.
LEADMALE:So you're also a disadvantaged inner-city youth, I hear.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, man, what's with him?
SUPMALE:It's a tan.
LEADMALE:What up on the schoolyard?
LEADMALE:School, man.
SUPMALE:I don't bother it, and it don't bother me.
LEADFEMALE:You don't go to school, Ice Tray? Sure I do.
LEADMALE:I've been held back in the 10th grade three times in a row.
LEADMALE:Three times? See, my motto is, when I find a grade I like, I stick with it.
LEADMALE:Education is the mortar that builds the temple of success.
SUPMALE:That's what I personally think.
SUPFEMALE:Like who cares? What's up with Smooth, Jocko, and O-Money? Smooth and Jocko got their own singing group now.
SUPFEMALE:And O-Money got his hair cut to look like the Chrysler Building.
SUPFEMALE:That's good, though, man.
OTHERFEMALE:That Mount Rushmore thing was not working.
OTHERFEMALE:This is dope, man.
SUPFEMALE:I'll just kick back here for a few days, let somebody else do all the work.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, young man.
LEADFEMALE:In this house, everyone carries his own weight.
OTHERFEMALE:Too easy.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Daddy.
OTHERMALE:Tray's on vacation.
LEADFEMALE:See, my motto is Lord, if there's anything like work around my heart, please remove it.
LEADMALE:I smell something greasy.
OTHERFEMALE:Too easy.
LEADFEMALE:A cheese steak! This is the real deal.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, man.
LEADFEMALE:Could I get $100?
OTHERFEMALE:For what?
SUPFEMALE:To pay the limo dude.
LEADMALE:You took a limo? Prince said y'all was loaded, and when in Rome, do as.
LEADMALE:$100?
SUPFEMALE:I got a cash flow problem.
LEADFEMALE:You see, my Korean Gucci bags, they just ain't been moving lately.
OTHERFEMALE:Tray, let's pay the dude.
SUPFEMALE:What's up with the Blake sisters, they still live on 43rd St.
LEADMALE:? Yeah, man, they got their own 900 number now.
SUPFEMALE:He's some piece of work.
LEADMALE:We're getting a rottweiler.
SUPFEMALE:I know he seems rough around the edges but we should all give him a chance.
SUPMALE:When you really look at it, how different is Ice Tray from Carlton? With all due respect, Mom, I think he's a little fonder of the 10th grade than I.
SUPMALE:Hold up.
OTHERMALE:What about that one girl you went out with that Latiqua? Man, that girl was ugly.
SUPFEMALE:Ugly? You crazy, man.
SUPFEMALE:She was so ugly, she was oogly.
LEADMALE:She was so ugly, Freddy Krueger had nightmares about her.
SUPMALE:At least she was smart.
OTHERFEMALE:That girl you was with
LEADFEMALE:Stacy.
LEADFEMALE:That girl was so dumb, it took her an hour to cook Minute Rice.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Let's talk about skinny girls.
LEADFEMALE:Who's skinny?
LEADMALE:That Julie you went out with? She was so skinny, you could tie a rope around her head and use her like a tetherball pole.
LEADMALE:Hold it.
SUPFEMALE:Back to Stacy.
LEADMALE:Stacy was so dumb.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know how dumb Stacy was?
LEADMALE:How dumb was Stacy?
LEADFEMALE:Stacy was so dumb that she took the Pepsi Challenge and chose Jif.
LEADFEMALE:This is dope, man.
SUPFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:Crystal, china dolls, a book.
LEADMALE:You know people are rich when they got all this stuff they got no use for.
LEADFEMALE:Crime and Punishment.
OTHERFEMALE:That's just some tired old book Carlton's reading.
LEADFEMALE:Really? "From the library of Master William Smith.
OTHERMALE:" Who's tired now, homey? They're forcing us to read that at school.
LEADMALE:I ain't gonna read it.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:This is your handwriting.
SUPFEMALE:"Intriguing duality?" Same old Prince, man.
LEADFEMALE:When I first met you, you was carrying books in a pizza box so nobody knew you were studying.
LEADFEMALE:That was cool, till them guys jumped me, trying to steal my pizza.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, they was upset.
SUPMALE:You got a good deal here, homey.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't blow it.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go grab us some cheese steaks.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, I think you're blowing this whole thing out of proportion.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me the story again.
LEADFEMALE:And this time, just the facts.
LEADMALE:I'll give you a transcript, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:"Hi.
LEADFEMALE:" 
SUPFEMALE:"Hi.
LEADMALE:" I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:What could she possibly see in him? He's got a nice smile, and cool hair.
LEADMALE:Hair? I thought it was a hat.
LEADMALE:I think I should have gotten a larger tattoo, Tray.
SUPMALE:Tattoo?
SUPMALE:I got a tattoo of Tray's initials.
SUPMALE:Where? Don't worry, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:No one will ever see it.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna go put this stuff up in my bedroom.
LEADMALE:I'll go with you.
LEADMALE:So will I.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Viv, you got to be proud of yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Pride doesn't quite capture it, Will.
LEADFEMALE:It was your idea to bring Tray out here.
SUPMALE:Hilary used to walk around all the time with such a sour look on her face.
LEADMALE:I used to say to myself, she just needs one good friend.
LEADMALE:He does seem like an interesting young man.
LEADFEMALE:You've only seen one side of him.
SUPFEMALE:He's joking around, but he can be serious.
OTHERMALE:Really? Seriously.
LEADFEMALE:If somebody's chasing him, he can jack a fence like that.
LEADMALE:But if somebody catch him, it don't matter.
LEADMALE:The boy got a crazy rabbit punch, like you don't even see it coming.
SUPMALE:You out of there.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go check out that swimming pool, Prince.
SUPMALE:See you later, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Icy.
LEADFEMALE:It's nice to see you and Ice Tray getting along.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry he couldn't stay longer.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry, I've got it all figured out.
SUPMALE:He can come visit every other weekend.
LEADMALE:When the 10th grade lets out, he can come stay in the pool house.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy can get him a job at the office.
SUPFEMALE:What job could he have in the law firm? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Lawyer? Anyways, Mom, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:This is our problem, not yours.
LEADFEMALE:The only thing I want to say is thank you.
LEADMALE:For what? You, like, saw right past his rough-tough exterior and you welcomed him into our home.
LEADMALE:I'm so proud of you, Mom.
LEADMALE:I just want to share my joy with you.
SUPMALE:I haven't been this happy since I bought my Giorgio Armani suit.
SUPMALE:This is serious.
SUPMALE:Hilary wants him to live in our pool house.
LEADMALE:That shouldn't matter to you, Vivian.
SUPFEMALE:You're the one who invited Ashtray.
LEADMALE:In fact, why don't we invite some more of Will's friends out? Let's just put a big neon sign out in front of the house that says "Homeboy Hotel.
LEADMALE:" That's it.
LEADMALE:I want him out of this house.
LEADFEMALE:You're making the classic mistake.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you know that? I have the perfect solution for dealing with Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Ice Pick.
SUPMALE:You do?
SUPMALE:My street savvy should not be taken lightly.
SUPMALE:She's rebelling against us.
LEADFEMALE:So? So any hostility will only drive her closer to him.
OTHERMALE:We have to embrace him, welcome him into the family take him out for a nice meal, smother him with acceptance.
LEADFEMALE:Once the element of rebellion is gone, the relationship will lose its appeal.
LEADMALE:What if that doesn't work?
SUPMALE:It'll work.
LEADMALE:You two make such a lovely, lovely couple.
LEADMALE:Dad, has Mom been drinking? Nonsense, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:She's just being polite to our lovely houseguest.
OTHERMALE:Have you been drinking? Tray, check this.
LEADMALE:That's dope, man.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:Nice catch, lady.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, Tray, you are so funny.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't he funny, everyone? Not to me.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, I'm sober.
SUPFEMALE:I think escargots all around for starters.
LEADMALE:Snails.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:I don't eat nothing that leaves a trail.
LEADMALE:God, Tray, you slay me.
OTHERMALE:He busts me up.
OTHERMALE:Before we get started, I'd like to propose a toast.
OTHERMALE:Tray, since this is your last night here Vivian and I would just like to say that we're both extremely happy that Hilary's found that special someone, that special love.
LEADFEMALE:I can just see Hilary and Tray in their tiny little love nest in Philadelphia with the pitter-patter of five little Ice Cubes.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary changing diapers and preparing a lovely meal while her loving husband is working his night job on the corner as a Korean Gucci bag representative.
SUPMALE:Hilary, this is for those wonderful years in Philadelphia.
LEADMALE:I guess I'll be driving home tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I am so happy.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, are you saying that you wouldn't mind if Tray and I, like, got married? Mind?
LEADFEMALE:Did you hear that, Vivian?
LEADMALE:Mind? That's good, because Hilary and I got married this afternoon.
LEADMALE:Hilary, no! How could you do this to us? How could you be so stupid? Do you realize you've gone and ruined your life? This boy doesn't care Mom, take it down 1,000.
LEADFEMALE:It's only a joke.
LEADMALE:We didn't get married.
LEADMALE:We just wanted to see what you'd do.
LEADFEMALE:See, baby, I told you they'd flip.
OTHERFEMALE:Homey, order me three steaks and a salad.
LEADMALE:Come on, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's dance.
SUPMALE:Got married.
LEADMALE:Sir, Master Tray's all packed and ready to depart.
SUPFEMALE:Excellent, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:Let's afford him everything we can in getting him on his way.
SUPMALE:Shall I call for a car, sir, or just shoot him out of a cannon? So, that really is a wonderful restaurant, isn't it? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I think everybody had a good time, don't you? I really enjoyed meeting Ice Tray this weekend.
LEADMALE:Any time you want to invite any of your other friends, just let us know.
LEADFEMALE:You enjoyed it?
LEADMALE:Yeah, a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Wasn't Hilary falling in love with Tray just the icing on the cake?
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad they had fun together.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:It's just a shame he had to leave before he had a chance to ruin her life.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry I said that, it's just that
SUPMALE:But you meant it.
LEADFEMALE:It was cool as long as Tray was some clown to come out here and bring me some cheese steaks and cheer me up.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on.
OTHERFEMALE:The second you found out Hilary liked him, you wanted him out.
LEADMALE:That's something I'd expect from Uncle Phil, not from you, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary is my daughter, Will.
LEADMALE:And Tray is my best friend.
OTHERMALE:We grew up together.
SUPFEMALE:We're from the same neighborhood.
SUPFEMALE:We're the same person.
LEADFEMALE:If Tray's not good enough for this family, then maybe I'm not.
LEADMALE:You are not the same person.
SUPMALE:I know who I am.
LEADMALE:No, you listen to me.
OTHERMALE:I can see why you like Ice Tray.
LEADMALE:He's a lot of fun.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's a joke to him.
OTHERFEMALE:School, work, people.
LEADMALE:He doesn't care about anything.
SUPMALE:He always managed to care about me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad he's a good friend, but that doesn't change who he is.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, but a young man his age should be able to do something else besides fight and jump fences.
SUPMALE:You weren't there.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but still When I was in seventh grade, trying to bring books home from school the kids would jump me, so Tray started walking me home.
LEADMALE:If he hadn't been there to throw those punches and help me jump fences then maybe I wouldn't be here.
LEADFEMALE:While he was busy protecting your books, where the hell were his? What's that got to do with anything? I'm glad he cared so much about you.
LEADMALE:But why doesn't he care as much about himself? Because nobody was there for Tray.
LEADFEMALE:If he hadn't been there to cover my back, maybe I wouldn't care about myself either.
LEADFEMALE:And that would be an awful waste.
LEADMALE:I shall load Mr.
SUPMALE:Tray's belongings into the cannon.
SUPFEMALE:I mean cab, madam.
OTHERFEMALE:We miss you in the 'hood, homeboy.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come on back with me? No, I better cool out here, man.
OTHERMALE:If Uncle Phil woke up and I wasn't here, he'd have a nervous breakdown.
LEADFEMALE:I'd recover, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really going to miss you, Ice Tray.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Banks.
OTHERMALE:Thanks for inviting me.
LEADFEMALE:We gotta do this again.
LEADMALE:Have a safe trip back.
OTHERFEMALE:Take care of yourself.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Snap.
SUPMALE:I almost forgot.
LEADMALE:I got a little something for y'all.
LEADFEMALE:That's our china dog.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I figured y'all were so nice to me and everything that I don't need it.
SUPFEMALE:That was a joke.
LEADMALE:You've become a part of my spirit that's never been touched before.
OTHERFEMALE:I feel a oneness with you, and now that you're leaving I just have this sense that life will be empty, hollow, and meaningless.
LEADMALE:Peep this, babe.
LEADMALE:See, I have this first-class ticket.
LEADFEMALE:We could go down to the airport and trade it for two coach tickets and you could come back to Philly with me.
SUPMALE:What do you think? Coach? 
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:Mom.
LEADMALE:It's only a weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, at your age, you should be able to baby-sit your little sister.
SUPMALE:Why can't Geoffrey baby-sit her? Because we're giving him the weekend off.
LEADMALE:You mean I'm going to have to get my own breakfast, too? Am I being punished for something? I was just asking myself that same question.
LEADFEMALE:But, Dad, I'm only nine.

LEADMALE:Here, let me check.
OTHERFEMALE:No, man.
SUPMALE:No freeways.

LEADMALE:You the one who ain't bring no map.
LEADMALE:You had to go to the bathroom.
OTHERMALE:You're the one that gave me that Shasta.
SUPFEMALE:Is that the police?
SUPMALE:Punch it, man.
LEADMALE:We're in a Benz.
LEADFEMALE:Are you crazy? I call this a lucky break.
OTHERFEMALE:A policeman is our pal.
LEADFEMALE:We can ask him for directions.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to me, when he comes up, keep your hands on the wheel.
OTHERFEMALE:Good evening, Officer.
SUPMALE:Carlton Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Keep your hands on the wheel.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you headed?
LEADMALE:We're going to Palm Springs.
OTHERFEMALE:And you? Where are you headed this fine evening? Good job.
SUPMALE:Now he's gonna want to see your license.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Can I see your license? My license? I have to warn you this picture was taken without my contacts.
LEADFEMALE:And the height is a typo, I'm actually a lot taller.
OTHERMALE:Fool, this is not The Love Connection.
SUPFEMALE:Vehicle registration, please.
LEADMALE:Just a sec.
LEADMALE:But the thing is, Officer, this isn't my car.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of the car.
LEADFEMALE:What? He's going to tell us to get out of the car.
OTHERMALE:You watch too much TV.
OTHERMALE:Get out of the car.
OTHERMALE:Officer, honestly, I don't see the need to Hey, out of the car now.
LEADMALE:Hey, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Thanks to you we're already an hour late to bikini land.
OTHERMALE:So when they interrogate us, which they like to do keep all your answers short and sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I know how to handle this.
SUPFEMALE:I'm pre-law.
SUPMALE:Okay, fellas, let's start at the beginning.
LEADMALE:Where are you from?
OTHERMALE:LA.
SUPFEMALE:Not exactly
SUPMALE:Next question, please.
LEADMALE:Let's hear what your friend has to say.
LEADFEMALE:Actually we come from Bel-Air.
SUPMALE:In fact, we live two houses away from the Reagans.
LEADFEMALE:We have the same pool man.
LEADMALE:And where were you headed to?
LEADFEMALE:The desert.
LEADFEMALE:Next question, please.
SUPFEMALE:Not just the desert.
OTHERMALE:Palm Springs.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to a legal retreat at Henry Furth's villa.
LEADMALE:He's my father's partner and the owner of the car we're driving.
LEADFEMALE:He is, is he? Then why didn't he drive it himself to Palm Springs? Because his wife flew everybody in her helicopter.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, fellas, we've had a lot of car thefts in the area lately.
LEADMALE:You want to talk about it?
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I think it's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:You making fun of me, kid? You're the one who wanted to talk about it.
SUPFEMALE:Quite frankly, I think it's a matter for the police to handle.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, they're handling it now.
SUPFEMALE:What on earth are you talking about? They think we stole the Benz.
OTHERMALE:Officers, let me call Henry Furth.
SUPMALE:He's the owner of the car.
LEADFEMALE:He'll straighten everything out.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:And while you're at it you might want to give Ron and Nancy a ring-a-ding-ding.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:It is up! It's up! Yes! You bum.
LEADMALE:You miserable bum! What a great game.
OTHERMALE:Would you get that, honey?
SUPFEMALE:Hello?
LEADFEMALE:May I speak to Philip Banks? Thanks? For what? No, I said, "Philip Banks.
SUPMALE:" Can I speak to him? I don't see him.
LEADFEMALE:He must have stepped out.
LEADMALE:Can you call back later? No.
SUPMALE:Is Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Furth there? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Furth.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Furth, this is Carlton Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, how are you, dear? You've got to get a message to my father.
SUPFEMALE:It's very important.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in jail.
SUPMALE:Yale? Marvelous.
SUPMALE:I've got to go now.
OTHERMALE:See you soon, dear.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, Vivian, Carlton just called.
OTHERMALE:Is everything all right?
LEADFEMALE:I should say so.
LEADFEMALE:He got into Yale.
SUPMALE:Yale? That's my alma mater.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton's only a sophomore.
LEADFEMALE:He's not applying to college yet.
OTHERFEMALE:You know Margaret.
LEADMALE:I'm sure she got it wrong.
LEADFEMALE:It probably wasn't Yale or Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:It probably wasn't even the phone.
OTHERMALE:I'm not getting back in that helicopter with her.
LEADMALE:It's all right, man.
LEADFEMALE:Chill.
SUPMALE:I get a phone call, too.
OTHERFEMALE:C, it's all right.
OTHERMALE:Chill.
LEADFEMALE:Get it.
LEADFEMALE:SHE Hilary, you're sitting right next to the phone.
OTHERMALE:I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:I'm your babysitter.
SUPMALE:I command you.
LEADMALE:Phone.
SUPFEMALE:Let me know if it's for me.
OTHERMALE:But, Miss Hilary, I'm off duty.
OTHERMALE:And you're sitting right next to the phone.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you're facing the phone.
LEADMALE:Lazy House.
LEADFEMALE:G, what up? This is Will, man.
LEADMALE:I need a big favor.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tired of doing favors for you spoilt children.
SUPFEMALE:I'm off duty.
SUPMALE:I am not an animal.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, man.
LEADFEMALE:I need another phone call.
LEADFEMALE:My butler hung up on me.
LEADMALE:Okay, fellas.
LEADMALE:You want to talk about those other car thefts? I don't think you know who you're talking to.
LEADFEMALE:I have a 3.
SUPFEMALE:95 grade point average which would have been 4.
LEADMALE:0, except I had to take a ceramics class and my pot exploded in my kiln.
SUPMALE:I'm going to go to Harvard Law School, graduate with honors and then I'm going to sue you blind.
LEADFEMALE:Now give us another phone call.
OTHERFEMALE:I think he likes you.
OTHERFEMALE:This is terrible.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm ruined.
LEADMALE:I'll be kicked out of the glee club, I won't get into Princeton.
OTHERMALE:I won't be admitted to the bar.
OTHERFEMALE:Neither will I.
LEADFEMALE:The cops took my fake ID.
LEADMALE:Come on, man, don't give me that my-dog-is-dead face.
SUPMALE:Come on, let's sing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not singing.
LEADFEMALE:This is just retarded.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, man, let it go.
LEADFEMALE:You'll feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, that was dope, Bob.
LEADFEMALE:Take five? We got to get out of here, man.
LEADMALE:That big dude is making me nervous.
OTHERMALE:Why? Any time you see a White guy in jail, you know he did something bad.
LEADFEMALE:We got to get a message to Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:He's a lawyer, he'll get us out of here.
LEADFEMALE:But they won't give us any more phone calls.
LEADMALE:Not that it matters.
LEADMALE:The game was on so loud, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Furth couldn't even hear what I said.
SUPFEMALE:The game?
OTHERMALE:Yeah, the football game on TV.
LEADMALE:That's all they do at these retreats.
LEADFEMALE:All right, we out of here.
LEADMALE:I got an idea.
OTHERMALE:Yo!
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:My buddy here is ready to confess.
OTHERMALE:Come on! Look at this!
OTHERFEMALE:He's going for a touchdown!
SUPFEMALE:Go! We interrupt this game for a special report.
LEADMALE:You bum! This is Steve Goddard of the Minuteman-21 news team at the Santa Juanesta police station.
LEADMALE:The recent rash of car thefts in the Palm Springs area has been solved, as the perpetrators were arrested this evening.
LEADMALE:The ringleader agreed to confess only if a camera crew were present to broadcast live.
LEADMALE:What you are about to see is a Minuteman-21 news exclusive.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we done it.
LEADMALE:Word to Big Bird.
SUPFEMALE:We flicked eight Benzitos, 15 Jags, and a Maserati! But I didn't like the upholstery so I took it back, Jack! Do you have anything to say? Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Aunt Viv!
LEADFEMALE:Dad! Who's in charge here?
LEADFEMALE:I am.
SUPMALE:Let those kids out.
LEADMALE:These kids are car thieves.
LEADMALE:You have made a big mistake.
SUPMALE:I don't know how you got that bogus confession out of them but those two boys haven't stolen a thing from anyone.
OTHERFEMALE:This is the biggest amateur operation I have seen since Mayberry R.
SUPFEMALE:F.
OTHERFEMALE:D.
LEADMALE:Could you ask your wife to calm down?
LEADMALE:Calm yourself, Barney Fife.
LEADMALE:Vivian, please.
SUPFEMALE:Officers, I'm sure we can clear this whole matter up quite easily.
OTHERFEMALE:Could you please sit down? We're busy now.
LEADMALE:Honey, we're about to get very busy.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down!
LEADMALE:Hey! You don't talk to my wife like that.
LEADFEMALE:Who the hell do you think you're talking Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
OTHERFEMALE:What's going on?
OTHERMALE:May I help you, sir? I'm Henry Furth.
LEADMALE:Good news.
LEADMALE:Your car is safe and sound.
LEADFEMALE:And we've got the perpetrators.
LEADFEMALE:Those aren't the perpetrators.
LEADFEMALE:Those are my partner's son and nephew.
LEADFEMALE:Partner? Legal partner.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a few questions for you.
SUPFEMALE:When you got this alleged confession from them did they have a lawyer present? No.
SUPFEMALE:Because I'm their lawyer.
LEADMALE:Did you notify their parents? No.
LEADFEMALE:Because we're their parents.
LEADMALE:So, Officer, don't tell us to wait.
LEADMALE:And don't tell us to sit down.
LEADMALE:Just open that damn cell and let those two boys out or I'll tie this place up with so much litigation that your grandchildren are gonna need lawyers! Open the cell, Jerry.
SUPMALE:Peace out, Bob.
LEADMALE:POLICE Geoffrey, I want a duck salad.
LEADMALE:When exactly do you go back on duty? When your parents walk through that door and not a moment sooner.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:We're home.
SUPFEMALE:Drat.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, how did everything go with Ashley? Mother, she was a little angel.
LEADFEMALE:She polished my nails and cleaned out my closet.
SUPMALE:To reward her, we went to this caf√© that's owned by John Cougar Mellencamp Kim Basinger, and Doogie Howser's business manager.
SUPFEMALE:And we spent the afternoon drinking espresso.
LEADMALE:You let Ashley drink espresso? Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! Let's go play! Come on, everybody, let's go play! Not tonight, sweetie, we kind of had an exhausting weekend.
LEADMALE:What happened?
LEADMALE:We got arrested.
SUPFEMALE:Arrested?
LEADMALE:By who? The fashion police? No.
SUPFEMALE:The police thought we stole Mr.
OTHERMALE:Furth's car.
SUPFEMALE:But they were just trying to do their jobs.
LEADFEMALE:Why did they think you stole it? Hilary, we've been over that all weekend.
SUPMALE:It's late.
LEADMALE:I think we all should go to bed.
SUPMALE:I don't want to.
LEADFEMALE:I want to play Monopoly, I want to jump up.
LEADMALE:Let's go paint my room! Geoffrey, some warm milk, please.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Carlton.
OTHERMALE:Yeah? Those cops were just trying to do their jobs? Don't get all bent out of shape.
LEADMALE:You didn't learn anything this weekend.
OTHERMALE:I most certainly did.
LEADFEMALE:Always bring a map.
OTHERFEMALE:What? If we would have had a map we wouldn't have to drive 2 miles an hour to find a freeway entrance and we wouldn't have been stopped.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I get it now.
LEADMALE:We were stopped because we were driving too slow.
LEADMALE:We were breaking the slowness limit.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I've never heard of that law before.
SUPFEMALE:But I did hear this other law.
LEADFEMALE:It's the "if you see a Black guy driving anything but a burned-out Pinto "you better stop him because he stole it" law.
LEADFEMALE:I heard about that one.
LEADMALE:But I thought it was "the Black guy law" when in actuality, it was the "slowness limit law.
SUPMALE:" Thank you for sharing that with me.
LEADMALE:Good night.
OTHERMALE:They were just doing their job.
LEADMALE:Good night, Carlton.
SUPMALE:What's your complaint here? We were detained for a few hours Dad cleared things up, and we were released.
OTHERFEMALE:The system works.
OTHERMALE:I hope you like that system 'cause you'll be seeing a lot of it in your lifetime.
OTHERFEMALE:Not if I bring a map.
SUPMALE:You just don't get it, do you? No map is going to save you, and neither is your glee club or your fancy Bel-Air address or who your daddy is.
LEADFEMALE:When you're driving in a nice car in a strange neighborhood none of that matters.
LEADMALE:They only see one thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe growing up where you did has made you a little touchy but I think you've blown this thing out of proportion.
LEADFEMALE:If you look at the facts Carlton, it's late.
LEADMALE:It's a school day tomorrow, son.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, okay, Dad.
SUPMALE:It was awfully nice of Mr.
LEADMALE:Furth to help us out.
LEADFEMALE:I'll have to write him a thank-you note.
LEADMALE:It shouldn't have happened in the first place, son.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
LEADMALE:If you were a policeman and you saw a car driving 2 miles an hour wouldn't you stop it? I asked myself that question the first time I was stopped.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, son.
LEADMALE:I would stop it.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Vogue with me, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:We're voguing.
LEADMALE:And what is the precise nature of this nervous disorder? It's for people that want to look cool but ain't really got no rhythm.
SUPFEMALE:You should be good at it.
SUPMALE:Come on, strike the pose.
SUPFEMALE:Unhand me, you ruffian.
SUPMALE:Will, please.
SUPMALE:Don't you have anything better to do than to annoy Geoffrey? Yeah, but Carlton ain't home yet.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you have any idea what he does after school? Window-shop at Randy's Short and Small? Carlton belongs to three different after-school clubs.
LEADFEMALE:I belong to the home shopping club.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, love.
LEADFEMALE:How was your day?
LEADMALE:Fine, until I ran into the man of leisure.
SUPFEMALE:Will doesn't think he needs any after-school activities.
LEADFEMALE:If you sit around the house all afternoon and never develop any outside interests you'll become a very, very shallow person.
LEADMALE:And you won't get into any of the good nightclubs.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never meet Lisa Bonet.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:You have so many talents.
LEADFEMALE:Why not join an after-school club? Aunt Viv, I ain't really down with staying at an all-boys school after dark.
LEADFEMALE:All right, then.
SUPFEMALE:I think you should get an after-school job.
LEADMALE:Bring on the clubs.
LEADMALE:It's officially after school.
LEADFEMALE:Go find the club of your choice.
SUPMALE:If I had the club of my choice, you'd be lying on the floor unconscious.
LEADMALE:A girl? Where did that come from? Didn't you know? We share our extra-curricular activities with the girls from our sister school.
SUPFEMALE:Lead me to the sisters.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready to get extracurricular.
LEADMALE:Yo, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Slap me 10.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I finally rented the movie Glory last night.
LEADFEMALE:Denzel was incredible.
LEADFEMALE:The South, man.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:We got to do something about it.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, Mr.
SUPMALE:Fellows?
LEADFEMALE:Call me Ned.
LEADMALE:You need another member of this poetry club? Will, solid.
LEADMALE:We could really use a representative of the Black male urban experience.
SUPFEMALE:More specifically, the handsome Black male urban experience.
OTHERFEMALE:Everyone, the meeting's about to begin.
SUPFEMALE:Will you please take your seats? I'd like to open this meeting with a reading from the poem Daddy by Sylvia Plath.
OTHERMALE:Daddy.
LEADMALE:"Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You "Every woman adores a Fascist "The boot in the face, the brute "Brute heart of a brute like you" Sylvia Plath killed herself shortly after writing this poem.
SUPMALE:If she didn't, her daddy would have.
LEADMALE:Who are you? This is my main man Will Smith, newest member of our poetry club.
LEADFEMALE:Will, Christina Johnson.
OTHERMALE:And we are so glad to have you.
SUPMALE:It's such a thrill to see a man from Bel-Air Academy not afraid to share our love of poetry.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Christina.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, on with the love sharing.
OTHERMALE:You can start by reading a poem for us.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't bring one.
SUPFEMALE:What a shame.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing that moves me more than hearing a poem recited in a deep, sensual, masculine voice.
LEADMALE:I got a poem.
SUPMALE:Who's it by?
LEADFEMALE:He's a street poet.
SUPFEMALE:He's a friend of mine.
LEADMALE:His name is Raphael de la Ghetto.
LEADMALE:Raphael de la Ghetto.
LEADMALE:I don't think I've ever heard of him.
OTHERFEMALE:I have.
OTHERFEMALE:You have? I stay pretty current, bro.
LEADMALE:Isn't he one of those street poets from south central LA? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Same guy.
LEADMALE:Will, the floor's yours.
OTHERMALE:Floor's yours.
OTHERMALE:You're a poet and you don't know it.
OTHERFEMALE:I am a poet and I do know it.
SUPMALE:Why don't you recite your poem? All right.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies, my poem is called Tick Tock Clock by Raphael de la Ghetto.
LEADMALE:"Tick tock clock "The clock is ticking for you "'Cause the love you said you'd give "Came up way past due "So dance to the clock rock "Stay on the floor "'Cause when the ticks turn to tocks "I'll be knocking at your door" That was incredible.
LEADFEMALE:And very typical of de la Ghetto's work.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, everybody, let's take a break while I go fire up the cappuccino maker.
OTHERMALE:That poem was brilliant.
LEADFEMALE:De la Ghetto uses a lot of metaphor.
SUPMALE:No, baby, he used to.
LEADFEMALE:He went to the clinic.
LEADFEMALE:He's straight now.
LEADFEMALE:I'd love to hear more of de la Ghetto's poems.
SUPMALE:As a woman, I find his work so passionate, so raw so exciting.
OTHERFEMALE:When I hear those words my body just quivers crying out for more.
LEADMALE:Poetry is good.
SUPMALE:"Love by Raphael de la Ghetto.
LEADMALE:" "Burnin' Love by Raphael de la Ghetto.
SUPFEMALE:" Master William, Mr.
SUPMALE:Jazz is here to see you.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, what up, J? What's up, man, I got this new Ice Cube tape.
LEADMALE:It's dope! I ain't got enough time for that.
LEADMALE:I got to finish writing this poem.
LEADMALE:Poem? Then what you going to do, bake some cookies? Hem a dress? Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm doing it to get this girl.
SUPFEMALE:Listen to what I got so far.
SUPMALE:I just need one last line.
SUPMALE:"My love for you is like a river "Like a summer breeze That makes my soul shiver "One look from you Is more precious than gold" Let's go get some barbecue and get busy.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of line is that? It always works for me.
OTHERMALE:I hear someone in this room likes poetry.
LEADMALE:Try this one on for size.
SUPMALE:"Roses are red Violets are blue "Pansies are poets Will, tell me it isn't true" That's funny.
LEADFEMALE:I got a poem for you, Carl.
LEADMALE:Try this one on for size.
SUPMALE:"Roses are red Violets are blue "Jazz and I are Black, But Carlton, what are you?" Master William I applaud your new interest.
LEADMALE:Poetry is one of my great loves.
LEADMALE:I won first prize at the old Devonshire poetry recital of 1963.
LEADFEMALE:You should have been there.
LEADFEMALE:The crowd rose to its feet shouting, "Encore!" That's interesting "Cannon to the right of them "Cannon to the left of them "Cannon in front of them "Volleyed and thundered" You need a last line for that?
LEADFEMALE:Good evening.
LEADMALE:Good evening, sir.
SUPMALE:So, young man, how'd it go at school today?
LEADFEMALE:I joined the poetry club.
LEADFEMALE:Excellent.
SUPFEMALE:I remember when I got interested in poetry.
SUPMALE:So who's the girl? I'm starving.
LEADMALE:When do we eat here? We eat here later.
LEADMALE:You eat here never.
SUPFEMALE:Looks like you eat here often.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Where's your uncle? He's throwing Jazz out the house again.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Here are those poetry books you wanted.
SUPFEMALE:I used them in the Freshman Lit class I taught last year.
LEADMALE:If you have any questions about poetry, just ask me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I have a question.
LEADMALE:I understand why guys get into poetry.
LEADMALE:To get girls.
LEADMALE:But why do girls like poetry? Because girls think with their brains.
OTHERMALE:Miss Christina Johnson.
SUPFEMALE:This is my Aunt Viv and this is my cousin Ashley.
OTHERMALE:Nice to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:You, too.
LEADFEMALE:You'll have to excuse us.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I've got a poem.
LEADFEMALE:"Will and Christina sitting in a tree"
LEADMALE:Beat it.
LEADFEMALE:They seem really nice.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:They mean well.
LEADMALE:But the only people I'm really comfortable with are my friends.
SUPFEMALE:The dead poets.
LEADMALE:Care to sit?
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I can't get de la Ghetto's poem off my mind.
LEADMALE:He is a genius, isn't he? Do you really, really know him? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:We're like brothers.
LEADMALE:Tell me.
SUPMALE:What's he like? He's a kind of a strange guy.
LEADMALE:His girl left him back in the '60s and he never changed his clothes.
SUPMALE:Wears the same old dashiki and monster afro.
SUPMALE:That's such a sad story.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:When I think about poor Raphael it makes me wonder if a woman could ever really care about a man.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you know him so well, because I have a favor to ask you.
SUPFEMALE:Anything.
LEADMALE:Could you bring Raphael to poetry night?
LEADMALE:Excuse me?
OTHERMALE:We have it at school once a month.
LEADMALE:Usually club members get up and recite their poetry.
LEADMALE:I'm in charge of it this month and I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if we had a real poet?" I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Raphael doesn't like to leave the house.
SUPFEMALE:You wouldn't either if you had the same dashiki on for 20 years.
SUPMALE:Could you just ask him, Will? I'd be so grateful.
LEADMALE:I could ask him, but I'm sure he'll say no.
OTHERMALE:Please try, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:It would mean so much to me.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, he'll be there.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you're here.
LEADFEMALE:You sounded kind of clutch on the phone.
OTHERMALE:I'm in big trouble.
LEADMALE:I promised Christina I'd have a famous poet at school tonight.
SUPFEMALE:I'm connected, but I don't know any famous poets.
LEADFEMALE:I need somebody to pretend to be a famous poet.
SUPMALE:I'll be home about 6:00, Geoffrey.
OTHERMALE:Is that your uncle? I'm tired of those grass burns.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Will.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Better get ready for school.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:We're really looking forward to poetry night tonight.
LEADFEMALE:How did you hear about it?
SUPMALE:Your teacher Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Fellows called.
OTHERFEMALE:He's calling all the parents of Bel-Air Academy.
LEADFEMALE:No, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:You guys can't go.
LEADMALE:But I love poetry.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, now, Vivian.
OTHERMALE:Let's be a little sensitive here.
LEADFEMALE:Will only joined the poetry club because he had a crush on Christina.
SUPFEMALE:If we show up, we'll cramp his style.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Will, good luck tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for understanding.
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? I just didn't want to get stuck at some boring poetry night.
SUPFEMALE:Is he gone yet? Did you hear any of that? This is getting out of control.
LEADFEMALE:I need a phony poet tonight.
LEADMALE:What does he have to do? He just has to have a big afro, a dashiki and stand in front of a crowd and read some stuff I'll write.
OTHERFEMALE:He has to be able to read? Yes, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:That'll cost you two extra Jacksons, but I know a guy.
LEADFEMALE:He's a sidewalk jewelry salesman so he has free nights.
LEADMALE:But he'll need $60 cash in advance.
LEADMALE:$60? Are you tripping? All I got is $20.
LEADMALE:He'll take it.
SUPMALE:Here's an extra $10.
LEADMALE:Get me a Rolex.
OTHERFEMALE:I just can't believe it.
LEADMALE:Raphael de la Ghetto at Bel-Air Academy.
LEADMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm looking forward to seeing him again.
SUPMALE:Will, is Raphael here yet? No.
LEADMALE:He'll probably be a little late.
LEADFEMALE:He likes his audience to be a little hostile.
LEADMALE:It's okay if he's running a little late.
SUPMALE:I just wrote a new poem and I'm anxious to share it.
LEADMALE:Will, this is our night.
OTHERMALE:Bringing Raphael de la Ghetto here tonight is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me.
LEADMALE:I'm feeling really close to you right now.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know how to thank you.
LEADMALE:You don't have to thank me.
SUPFEMALE:But, Will, I want to after the reading.
SUPMALE:Will's gonna get thanked! What are you guys doing here? It's after dark, Master William.
LEADFEMALE:I thought it wise to drive the young ladies to ensure that they arrived safely.
OTHERFEMALE:Are there any women my age here?
LEADMALE:But why did you two come?
OTHERMALE:Are you kidding? We heard the buzz about this event on Melrose.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot believe your dinky, little school got Raphael de la Ghetto to come.
SUPMALE:Why didn't you tell me it was poetry night? You know what a great lover of literature I am.
OTHERMALE:I've never seen you read nothing.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:I suppose I just get my horoscope out of the air.
SUPMALE:Jazz, where is the poet? Locked up in the steel hotel.
SUPFEMALE:Cops caught him with a fistful of toy Rolexes.
LEADMALE:Yo, let's get out of here.
SUPMALE:Jazz, I can't go.
SUPFEMALE:After this, I'm getting thanked.
LEADMALE:Ode to Judy.
LEADMALE:"Unfinished Sunday Times puzzle "Lying limp on the hardwood floor "The society page spread open "My coffee is cold "It seems you are engaged "To a prominent investment banker "Prominent for what? "I'd very much like to know" We better go.
SUPFEMALE:This crowd will get ugly if they got to listen to much more of that.
SUPMALE:The audience is growing restless.
LEADFEMALE:Where is this de la Ghetto fellow? I really stepped in it this time.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what I'm going to do.
LEADMALE:What's wrong? There is no Raphael de la Ghetto.
OTHERFEMALE:I made him up.
LEADMALE:I just wanted to impress Christina.
OTHERFEMALE:I even had Jazz hire a phony poet to come tonight, but the dude didn't show up.
SUPMALE:There was extenuating circumstances.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I'm gonna do, G.
SUPMALE:Christina is a very, very nice girl.
LEADFEMALE:If she finds out I lied to her, she may never even speak to me again.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone, I'm sorry for the delay but the big moment has finally come.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like to present the man responsible for this evening's event Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Will Smith.
SUPMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Raphael de la Ghetto.
LEADMALE:"Listen "To the street beat "Hear the sound pound "Plug your ears "Mask your fears "Something weird's going down "So listen to the street beat "Listen to the box shock "Listen, or I'll kill you" That was heavy, man.
SUPFEMALE:Let's have another one.
SUPFEMALE:Encore.
LEADMALE:"Cannon to the right of them "Cannon to the left of them "Cannon in front of them "Volleyed and thundered"
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, isn't that your butler?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:It's a good look for him.
LEADFEMALE:"Came through the jaws of Death" Silence, you ungrateful children.
LEADMALE:When you're ready to be quiet and listen, I shall return.
LEADMALE:That was your butler.
LEADMALE:Look, baby, let me explain.
SUPMALE:You don't even know de la Ghetto.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe anything you've said to me.
OTHERFEMALE:You're nothing but a liar.
LEADMALE:My man Will ain't no liar.
SUPFEMALE:Who are you? I am Raphael de la Ghetto.
SUPFEMALE:Where's your afro? And where's your dashiki? I worked all that out in therapy.
SUPMALE:I don't know who to believe anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:How do I know you're the real Raphael de la Ghetto? Listen.
LEADMALE:"My love for you is like a river "Like a summer breeze That makes my soul shiver "One look from you Is more precious than gold "Let's go get some barbecue And get busy" Tell me more.
LEADFEMALE:Works every time.
OTHERMALE:"Cannon to the left of them "Cannon to the right of them" I'm sorry I missed that.
LEADMALE:So Jazz went out with Christina.
LEADFEMALE:That's cool, though, baby.
LEADMALE:I'm a poet, and it's a lot more ink in this pen.
LEADMALE:I think you have a talent for poetry.
OTHERMALE:I was just playing around with that stuff.
SUPFEMALE:But the poem that you wrote got a standing ovation.
LEADMALE:That's right, and it got me a date.
SUPMALE:The other one you wrote got Jazz a date.
LEADMALE:The one I got out of your wastebasket got me a date.
OTHERMALE:Mommy, I'd like to hear a poem.
LEADMALE:Could you read us one? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:This is a poem that your father and I especially love.
OTHERFEMALE:It's by Amiri Baraka.
SUPFEMALE:It's called Three Modes of History and Culture.
LEADFEMALE:"I think about a time "When I will be relaxed "When flames and nonspecific passion "Wear themselves away "And my eyes and hands And mind can turn "And soften "And the songs will be softer "And weight the air" If you'd like to learn more about poetry, you can reach us at Psych.
SUPMALE:We just kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, y'all.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:I told them you were awake.
LEADMALE:Happy birthday, Geoffrey! I'm so touched.
SUPFEMALE:May I get you anything? Don't be silly.
LEADMALE:You're always worried about pleasing us, but today it's Saturday, we're home and we're waiting on you.
LEADMALE:This is highly irregular.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to hear it.
SUPFEMALE:Today, we're your butlers.
SUPMALE:Here's breakfast in bed.
OTHERMALE:Is there anything else you would like? A spot of tea.
LEADMALE:I'll get the tea.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like anything with that? Geoffrey, relax.
SUPFEMALE:It's your birthday.
SUPMALE:We're gonna do all of your most hated chores.
LEADFEMALE:But, sir, I don't hate any of my chores.
LEADMALE:We do.
LEADFEMALE:Are you going to do anything special for your birthday? Most assuredly, Miss Ashley.
LEADMALE:Tonight, I'll be enjoying a BBC broadcast of Gilbert and Sullivan's HMS Pinafore followed by a penetrating interview by David Frost.
LEADFEMALE:And they say the man can't party.
LEADFEMALE:Before we get you your tea there's something else we'd like to do for you.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, put away that tired old kazoo, please.
SUPFEMALE:Get busy for me one time, Skinny A.
SUPMALE:"Happy birthday, my man G "Because you know the most About butlery "So don't move an inch, stay where you sit "We're going to treat you like The King of Brit" Did you see that look on Geoffrey's face? He just lit up.
LEADMALE:I never thought I'd say this, but it feels really good to do something for somebody else for a change.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't we supposed to make him some tea? Right.
OTHERFEMALE:How'd you like to go into the kitchen and introduce Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Tea Bag and Mr.
OTHERMALE:Teapot to Mr.
SUPMALE:Boiling Water? Hilary, how'd you like to make the tea before I take away Mr.
LEADMALE:Allowance? Mother, please.
LEADFEMALE:Don't talk down to me.
LEADMALE:Yo, I got it.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what I'm getting G for his birthday.
LEADMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:Let me give you a hint.
LEADMALE:Little Richard? Shut up.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:I want to hook Geoffrey up with a woman so he can get busy.
LEADFEMALE:I think Geoffrey's busy enough, what with all his chores.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't get it.
SUPMALE:Look, it's Geoffrey's birthday, and he's just staying up listening to his radio.
LEADFEMALE:Straight up, the man's depressed.
LEADFEMALE:No, he's not depressed.
LEADFEMALE:He's British.
LEADFEMALE:It's the man's birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Leave him alone.
SUPFEMALE:If Geoffrey's interested I don't see any harm in introducing him to a nice woman.
SUPMALE:Here she goes.
OTHERFEMALE:Here what goes? Your poor Aunt Vivian seems to think she's a matchmaker.
LEADMALE:In her mind, she's the Chuck Woolery of Bel-Air.
LEADMALE:It's not just my opinion.
SUPFEMALE:When I was in college, I introduced three couples and they all got married.
LEADFEMALE:And by your fifth reunion, they were all divorced.
LEADFEMALE:I just get them to the altar.
OTHERMALE:After that, they're on their own.
LEADMALE:People, people, please.
LEADMALE:I don't want to hear your dirty laundry.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey deserves a woman interested in a serious, long-lasting relationship.
LEADMALE:And I know exactly where to find her.
LEADMALE:The mall.
LEADFEMALE:Wait till Geoffrey sees this.
LEADMALE:When I'm done, he won't have to polish this for a month.
LEADMALE:I can see myself.
LEADMALE:I can't.
LEADMALE:Stay smooth.
LEADFEMALE:Don't buckle.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, what's the problem? I've never wrapped a present before.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey's always wrapped my presents.
SUPMALE:Hilary, you can't ask him to wrap his own present.
LEADMALE:I guess that's another one of those unwritten rules.
SUPFEMALE:Man! Two hours at the mall, and I ain't get no girls.
LEADFEMALE:What did you expect? You went to the mall with girl-away there.
SUPFEMALE:For your information, Hilary, Jazz here happens to be the master when it comes to cracking on the girls.
SUPMALE:The boy is irresistible.
LEADMALE:Sure, maybe during a blackout.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd love to get a hold of you during a blackout.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy.
LEADMALE:That's better.
LEADMALE:Now, where were we? In honor of Geoffrey's birthday, we are preparing an incredible feast.
LEADMALE:Beef Stroganoff, Potatoes au Gratin, and Apple Brown Betty.
LEADMALE:It sounds delicious.
OTHERFEMALE:When will it be ready? In 55 seconds.
LEADMALE:Just tell us when to zap it.
LEADMALE:Could you put a hold on dinner, please? I'm trying to find Geoffrey a girl.
LEADMALE:The words "mission impossible" come to mind.
LEADMALE:I know someone.
LEADMALE:Really? You know my friend Samantha? Maybe I should explain some of the finer points of the law to you.
LEADMALE:I was going to say that Samantha has this sweet nanny who just came from England.
LEADMALE:She says Helen has nothing to do.
SUPFEMALE:She just sits in her room at night knitting.
SUPFEMALE:I smell a match.
LEADMALE:How long has this nanny been in America? Two weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:A lonely woman, new to our country she probably won't even notice what a Melvin Geoffrey is.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, you go invite her.
LEADFEMALE:The rest of y'all beat it.
LEADMALE:You bellowed, Master William? I've been thinking about it.
LEADMALE:I'm not down with you being lonely on your birthday.
LEADMALE:I shall be far from lonely.
LEADFEMALE:I shall be spending the evening with the glorious music of Sir William Schwenck Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan not to mention David Frost.
LEADMALE:So far, I count you plus three guys.
SUPFEMALE:I just thought you might prefer a woman.
LEADMALE:I'm not making too big an assumption here, am I? As it happens, I like women just fine.
LEADFEMALE:But I think it's a bad idea for a butler to intertwine his private life with that of the family.
SUPFEMALE:Surely you gleaned that much from watching Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Belvedere.
SUPMALE:But, G, there's this nice old British nanny that Ashley knows she really wants to go out with you.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, Master William.
LEADMALE:But Ashley already invited her.
SUPFEMALE:What? I told her that was a little pushy, but you know kids.
OTHERFEMALE:This is just regrettable.
SUPFEMALE:It ain't so bad, G.
SUPMALE:I mean, it's your patriotic duty to show your countrywoman a good time.
LEADFEMALE:G, don't do it for yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Do it for the King.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't want to disappoint King Elizabeth.
OTHERFEMALE:Helen is going to be here any minute.
OTHERMALE:Baby, hook it up.
LEADMALE:I'm hooking as fast as I can.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be such a wanker.
SUPMALE:What are you going to wear?
LEADFEMALE:Voila! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,no, no,no, no, no.
OTHERMALE:Come on, G.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary's taking you and Helen to the fliest club in LA.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz is the DJ there.
LEADMALE:He said the place is all of that.
LEADMALE:All what? Look, forget it.
LEADMALE:I don't think you understand, man.
LEADMALE:You got a kind of a Ben Vereen thing going here, man.
LEADMALE:Come on, baby.
LEADFEMALE:You got to dress a lot funkier than that.
LEADMALE:Funkier? There.
LEADMALE:Pure, unadulterated funk.
LEADMALE:All right, look, G, forget about looking cool.
LEADMALE:Let's concentrate on acting cool.
OTHERMALE:Don't talk to me about cool.
LEADMALE:During the '70s, I was briefly employed as Led Zeppelin's road butler.
LEADMALE:When the music is pumping and it's time to go on the dance floor this is what you do.
SUPMALE:Now you give it a try.
LEADFEMALE:I would be most happy to, but to the best of my knowledge hell has not yet frozen over.
LEADFEMALE:Madam, sir.
LEADFEMALE:A round-trip ticket to England.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:We thought it would be nice for you to see your family.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I suppose I should drop in on them.
SUPFEMALE:This is from Ashley and me.
LEADMALE:I paid the lion's share.
LEADMALE:Happy birthday, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:English Leather.
LEADFEMALE:English toffee.
LEADMALE:An English muffin.
SUPMALE:That sounds like my present, G, but I'll leave the unwrapping to you.
OTHERMALE:Will, must you be so ribald? I won't answer that without a lawyer and a dictionary.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get Helen.
LEADMALE:Here's my present, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Happy birthday.
LEADMALE:I wrapped it myself.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Miss Hilary.
LEADMALE:This is most generous.
LEADMALE:I know I boss you around too much.
LEADFEMALE:This gift is my way of making up for it.
LEADMALE:Hilary, sweetheart, you could also stop bossing him around.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, then I'll keep the sweater.
LEADMALE:He's right this way, Helen.
SUPMALE:Happy birthday, G.
LEADMALE:Get ready to have your candles blown out.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, I'd like you to meet Samantha's nanny, Helen Carter.
SUPFEMALE:Helen, I'd like you to meet Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Charmed.
LEADFEMALE:It's nice to meet you.
SUPFEMALE:From the children's description, I thought you'd be much older.
LEADMALE:Ditto.
LEADMALE:And this is my mom, my dad Hilary, Will, and Carlton.
LEADMALE:You can call me Tony.
LEADMALE:What are you trying to pull here, Tony the Tiger? I didn't start it.
OTHERMALE:Did you see the way she looked at me? Share the fantasy, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to be friendly.
LEADFEMALE:Park your welcome wagon elsewhere.
LEADMALE:That's Geoffrey's date.
LEADMALE:She'll be dancing with him, but she'll be thinking of me.
SUPFEMALE:So, Helen, I'm Will.
SUPMALE:Welcome to our humble crib.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, this must be that houseboy you were telling me about.
LEADFEMALE:That's homeboy.
SUPMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so glad you could make it tonight, Helen.
SUPFEMALE:This is working out just beautifully.
LEADFEMALE:The two of you look so wonderful together.
LEADFEMALE:How many lives do you have to ruin, Vivian? Helen, what part of England are you from? Allow me, Miss Hilary.
LEADMALE:You can tell a lot from a person's accent.
SUPMALE:You're from London, of course.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:I'm guessing West End.
LEADFEMALE:Why, yes.
SUPFEMALE:Chilton Road?
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Upstairs above Shrimpton & Son.
SUPFEMALE:Close.
LEADMALE:One more block up, next to Bottomleys.
LEADMALE:It has been a while.
LEADMALE:Isn't this cute? You two have so much in common.
SUPMALE:You both speak English.
SUPFEMALE:To this day, it remains the largest rhino ever to be taken with a bow and arrow.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, this is fascinating.
LEADMALE:It's like going out with James Bond.
LEADMALE:You're not the first to have made that comparison.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to go mingle.
SUPFEMALE:The "A" list turned out tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Look.
LEADMALE:That's Tom Cruise's pool cleaner.
SUPFEMALE:And that's Cher's electrolysist.
LEADFEMALE:And that's Heather Locklear.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, beautiful, I see you've come to make up.
LEADFEMALE:What's with the Band-Aid? Was your brain leaking? I hit the pavement kind of hard when your dad threw me out of the house.
SUPMALE:You could call it a love scar.
OTHERFEMALE:Perhaps I haven't been clear in the past.
OTHERMALE:I don't like talking to you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even like seeing you.
LEADMALE:So please, just go away.
SUPMALE:I love a flirt.
LEADMALE:Will, what are you doing here? Leave Geoffrey and Helen alone.
SUPMALE:What do you think I am? I'm down here merely to hang out with my good friend Jazz.
SUPMALE:While you're here at it, hose him down.
SUPFEMALE:I got to run.
OTHERFEMALE:There's Demi Moore's cable man.
SUPMALE:Yo, J, what up, baby?
OTHERFEMALE:Yo.
LEADMALE:Your cousin's really starting to warm up to me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with you?
LEADMALE:Peep out that babe G's with.
LEADMALE:You mean Wonder Woman? Check this out.
LEADMALE:I got the worst luck in the world.
LEADFEMALE:All the babes I mess with in Bel-Air been whacked, right? I follow you so far.
OTHERMALE:I go to hook G up with an old British nanny it turns out to be her.
LEADFEMALE:She don't look too old to me.
LEADMALE:I know, Jazz.
LEADMALE:She's perfect.
LEADMALE:Homey, I'm in love.
LEADFEMALE:G didn't even want to go out with her in the first place.
SUPMALE:I don't know what you guys do in Philly but in LA, we don't give stuff like that away.
LEADMALE:I don't know what you guys do in LA but in Philly, you crack on somebody's honey, you get yourself killed.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what you guys do in Philly, but in LA, we men have to take that risk.
LEADMALE:Yo, brother, you want to take this outside? Calm down, man.
LEADMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, how's your butler dance? Like he dresses.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? I'll throw on some house music, he can't hang out on the dance floor.
LEADFEMALE:You can pick up all the pieces.
LEADMALE:We got a brother in the house tonight.
LEADFEMALE:He's celebrating his birthday.
SUPFEMALE:He's my main man Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Clear the dance floor, and let him and his lady get busy.
SUPMALE:Helen, care to cut a rug? Smashing.
LEADFEMALE:Like an angel in flight.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he is better than I thought he'd be.
LEADMALE:They're doing the lambada.
LEADFEMALE:That's the forbidden dance.
LEADFEMALE:It's like this, right? Mississippi Burning, right? I'm getting that feeling of deja vu.
SUPMALE:I'm trying to concentrate.
SUPFEMALE:Could you turn that down? I'm sorry, honey.
SUPMALE:Maybe this will help.
SUPMALE:It's Saturday night.
LEADFEMALE:We always used to go out dancing Saturday nights.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we can do some in-house dancing.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing home?
SUPFEMALE:Man, I sort of bounced home.
LEADMALE:They threw me out of the club.
SUPMALE:Why? It all started when your man Geoffrey started doing the lambada.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey does the lambada? That's the forbidden dance.
SUPMALE:You guys missed the night of the year.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey is an amazing dancer.
OTHERFEMALE:He was doing back flips.
LEADFEMALE:Back flips? Isn't he cute?
LEADMALE:Good night, Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:Good night, Miss Hilary.
SUPMALE:Yes, I think we'll go up, too.
OTHERMALE:Good night, everyone, and thanks for a lovely birthday.
SUPMALE:Yo, G?
OTHERFEMALE:Yes? Hold on.
LEADFEMALE:I shouldn't have busted your groove at the club.
LEADFEMALE:I guess what I want to say is it's all Jazz's fault, man.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, lad.
SUPMALE:Master William for you, a birthday is a time to paint the town red but for me, it's a time of reflection.
LEADMALE:A time to review one's successes and regrets.
LEADFEMALE:One of my regrets has always been the fact that I never had a son.
LEADFEMALE:I have so much advice to pass on to the next generation.
LEADFEMALE:But no one to tell it to.
LEADMALE:Look at the time.
LEADMALE:Boy, I'm bushed.
LEADFEMALE:Sit, William.
SUPFEMALE:My boy, a man is much more than the job he holds or the clothes he wears.
LEADMALE:For example, if I were to judge you by your costume I should guess you were some kind of circus performer.
LEADFEMALE:That's pretty cold, G.
LEADFEMALE:But you made the same assumptions about me.
OTHERFEMALE:You assumed I was lonely.
LEADMALE:You assumed I couldn't comport myself at a nightspot.
SUPMALE:You assumed I was a poor dancer.
LEADMALE:I hope the events of tonight have proved to you that I am, as the saying goes a fairly fly individual.
SUPMALE:Helen sure thinks so.
SUPFEMALE:She's certainly a hot little number.
SUPMALE:But I'm afraid she and I were mismatched.
LEADFEMALE:She was a little too young for you?
OTHERMALE:Quite the contrary.
SUPFEMALE:I am afraid I was a little too intimidating for the poor girl.
LEADMALE:She's looking for someone a little slower a little less sophisticated.
LEADFEMALE:I could be slower.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure I could be less sophisticated.
OTHERFEMALE:She sensed that.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's her phone number.
LEADFEMALE:She's expecting your call.
LEADFEMALE:It isn't important that I got the date with Helen.
LEADFEMALE:The important thing is I learned to appreciate Geoffrey as a human being.
LEADMALE:And Geoffrey and I have a deeper relationship.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Good evening, sir.
LEADMALE:How was your day? Being a lawyer stinks, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:No matter how good a job you do your clients still compare you to Harry Hamlin.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:The resemblance is quite striking.
OTHERMALE:Come on, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Get on the soul train.
LEADMALE:I love this kind of dancing, it makes you feel so young.
LEADMALE:Doesn't that golden oldie take you way back? That was Papa's Got a Brand New Bag recorded 25 long years ago by James Brown the Granddaddy of Soul.
LEADMALE:We'll be right back after this message from Geritol.
SUPFEMALE:And the Fresh Prince drives down the court.
OTHERFEMALE:He stops, he pops, and it's Yes! No.
LEADMALE:Will, don't play inside.
SUPFEMALE:You might break something.
LEADFEMALE:Or something might break you.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You don't have a hoop outside.
LEADMALE:And Jazz is getting tired of standing on the second-floor balcony holding a pool skimmer.
SUPMALE:Come on, Prince, man.
SUPFEMALE:I know a playground in my neighborhood.
LEADFEMALE:'Course we can only play half-court.
LEADFEMALE:They use the other end to sell stolen appliances.
LEADMALE:Dope.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Hold on.
SUPMALE:We don't want you playing there.
SUPFEMALE:There's a perfectly good basketball court at the school, where Carlton is practicing.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton's on the basketball team? How do they do? They try hard, but to tell you the truth, they haven't won a game so far.
OTHERMALE:Aunt Viv, don't you think if we went down to watch them practice Carlton would be a little embarrassed?
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Good try! Man, these guys need help.
SUPFEMALE:Help? They need a telethon.
LEADMALE:He threw that ball to me.
SUPMALE:I'm on the other team.
LEADMALE:I'm supposed to try and get it.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to be rude about it.
SUPFEMALE:You two, make up right now.
LEADFEMALE:All right, men.
LEADMALE:Another brilliant warm-up.
SUPMALE:Frankly, I think there's been way too much emphasis over the years on putting the ball actually through the hoop.
LEADMALE:So let's practice some passing.
OTHERMALE:Coach Smiley, may I have a minute?
LEADMALE:Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, men, take five.
OTHERFEMALE:Headmaster Thorvald, good afternoon.
LEADMALE:This is Barry O'Donnell.
LEADFEMALE:He's a distinguished alumnus and I'm encouraging him to donate money for a new gymnasium.
OTHERMALE:Coach.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think the team's prospects are this year? For what? For winning.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:What about those two? You've been holding out on me.
LEADMALE:Now those are players.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to meet them.
LEADMALE:Gentlemen.
SUPMALE:Not you.
OTHERFEMALE:You two, come on over.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to meet somebody.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Thorvald, straight up, about that fire 
LEADFEMALE:I don't know who pulled it.
LEADFEMALE:Forget about it.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like you to meet two of Bel-Air Academy's newest recruits.
LEADFEMALE:This is Will Smith and Your name is Jazz, man.
LEADMALE:Of course, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Jazzman.
SUPMALE:Will, where have you been hiding yourself? What do you mean? During gym class? No.
LEADFEMALE:I just wondered, how'd you two men like to join the school team? Man, I ain't even in this school.
SUPFEMALE:I'm willing to look past that if you are.
LEADMALE:Coach, he can't be on the team if he's not in school here.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:How about you, Will? I was just trying to find somewhere to play.
LEADFEMALE:You join this team, you can play here anytime you want.
SUPMALE:No, I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:It'll look good on a college application.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Coach.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll give you my car.
LEADMALE:Okay, this is gonna be fun.
LEADFEMALE:The coach asked me to go through the playbook with you.
LEADFEMALE:Your team doesn't need a playbook.
SUPMALE:They need a prayer book.
SUPMALE:Now, pay attention.
LEADMALE:This is you and this is me.
LEADMALE:Carlton, you got it wrong already.
SUPFEMALE:It's more like this.
LEADMALE:This is me.
SUPMALE:And this is you.
SUPFEMALE:Fair enough.
LEADFEMALE:This is my brain and this is your brain.
LEADMALE:This is my handsome face.
OTHERMALE:And this is your ugly little Frankenstein face.
OTHERMALE:Give me that chalk.
LEADMALE:Come on, man, beat it.
SUPMALE:Give it.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley! Here, Ashley, finally there's an adult in the room.
OTHERMALE:Guys, I'm trying to study.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing?
SUPMALE:Keep away from Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Over here.
OTHERFEMALE:Children, please! What if your parents witnessed this horseplay?
LEADMALE:Give me that chalk immediately.
OTHERMALE:Keep it away from Carlton! Keep away from Carlton and Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:You've met your match, Master William.
OTHERMALE:Geoffrey, get off me, man.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey? May I get you something, sir? No, thank you.
OTHERMALE:Will, how many times do I have to tell you that this is our living room? How'd you like it if I went into your room and started throwing chalk around? I'd be devastated.
LEADFEMALE:Out.
SUPMALE:Why did you do that?
LEADMALE:What? You singled Will out.
SUPFEMALE:They were all goofing around.
SUPMALE:He was the mastermind.
OTHERMALE:Trust me.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish you'd be nicer to Will.
SUPFEMALE:He joined the basketball team and you haven't said a word about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Give him some credit.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:I see your point.
LEADMALE:Besides, I think it's a great opportunity for you two to find some common ground.
SUPFEMALE:After all, you were kind of a star athlete in college.
LEADFEMALE:"Kind of a star athlete"? All right.
LEADMALE:You were a football god.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Who knows, it might do him some good.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing like a little organized sport to straighten a guy out.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:It did wonders for Pete Rose.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, I appreciate you coming tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I know you're not a big sports fan.
LEADFEMALE:Mother, please, it's Will's first game with the team.
OTHERMALE:I'm proud of him.
LEADFEMALE:If I didn't show up to support him, what kind of cousin would I be? lt'll be three hours well spent.
LEADFEMALE:Three hours? Five, four, three, two, one! I'm going to Disneyland! You did all right! All right, men, good game on Friday.
LEADFEMALE:But we can do even better this week.
OTHERMALE:So let's go over some plays.
LEADMALE:Sorry I'm late, Coach! Sorry isn't good enough, Cartwell.
LEADMALE:I was under the assumption
LEADMALE:You made an assumption.
OTHERMALE:Don't make an assumption because you will be an ass and the ump will shun you.
LEADMALE:Cartwell, after practice, you give me 10 laps around the school.
LEADMALE:Yes, Coach.
OTHERMALE:Now let's take a look at this play.
LEADFEMALE:What's up? It's my squad.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry I'm late, Coach.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it, Smith.
SUPMALE:You just take it easy.
OTHERMALE:Save that energy for the game.
LEADMALE:But I was late, and I have to run 10 laps.
SUPFEMALE:Twenty laps.
LEADFEMALE:Now, shut up.
LEADFEMALE:First play.
LEADFEMALE:Guard inbounds to the center.
LEADMALE:Center moves down court, fakes right, passes to the forward.
SUPFEMALE:What does he do?
LEADMALE:Passes to Will?
LEADMALE:Bingo.
OTHERFEMALE:Second play.
LEADMALE:Jump ball.
LEADFEMALE:Ball is tipped to the center.
LEADFEMALE:Center shuttles to the guard, back to the center who hits to the forward and over to baseline.
LEADFEMALE:What does he do?
SUPFEMALE:Passes to Will.
LEADMALE:Yes! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Number three.
LEADFEMALE:Forward inbounds from here bounce pass to the guard, who zips it back to the forward under the net.
LEADMALE:What does he do? If he's clear, he goes for the lay-up.
SUPMALE:Otherwise, back to the guard.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Banks, not paying attention? Ten laps.
LEADFEMALE:Not paying attention? Look at Will.
LEADFEMALE:He's asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Mind your own business, Banks.
SUPMALE:That's 20 laps.
LEADMALE:NBA superstar Isaiah Thomas is used to having things his own way.
LEADMALE:But not today.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do it, Prince? Easy, Isaiah.
LEADFEMALE:Air Fresh gym shoes.
OTHERMALE:Just pass it to Will.
LEADMALE:Hi, pumpkin.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, love.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Is Will home yet? He's outside playing basketball with Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Will.
LEADMALE:Now let me down.
SUPFEMALE:Will, would you come in here a minute, please? What's going on? I've been thinking about what you said about us finding some common ground.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:The firm has season tickets for the Laker game, so I put in for them.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought we could go.
OTHERFEMALE:Philip, what a great idea.
SUPFEMALE:He'll love it.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, thanks for putting the hoop up on the garage.
SUPMALE:It's really helping my lay-ups, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on out, I'll show you.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds great, Carlton, but in a minute, okay?
LEADMALE:You wanted to talk to me?
SUPMALE:I have two tickets to the Lakers game.
SUPFEMALE:How'd you like to come?
LEADFEMALE:Word, I'm with that.
SUPFEMALE:Give the Laker girls an opportunity to check out a future Laker.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:Son, you want to show me those lay-ups? Maybe a little bit later.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, I've got some studying to do.
LEADFEMALE:After dinner?
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, want to shoot a few hoops?
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Did I tell you how my high-school team won the state championship? I made the final basket right at the buzzer.
LEADFEMALE:That's decent.
LEADMALE:Hi, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Hilary.
LEADMALE:Hilary, can I ask you something?
OTHERMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:How was I in the basketball game last Friday? You were great.
SUPFEMALE:You didn't make any baskets or anything but you looked cute in your uniform.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's great how you don't get it too sweaty.
LEADMALE:I guess it's 'cause you don't run too fast.
LEADFEMALE:Smart move.
OTHERMALE:Did Dad mention me during the game? He did turn around to the guy behind him once and 
OTHERFEMALE:"Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:That's my son you're talking about.
LEADMALE:" It's Will, isn't it? No.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not.
LEADFEMALE:Talk to me.
SUPFEMALE:Look, it's ridiculous to compare yourself to Will.
LEADMALE:You're captain of the debate team, a straight "A" student you're leader of the glee club.
LEADMALE:So what if Will's good at basketball? Thanks, Hilary.
LEADMALE:That means a lot to me.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, if that basket were two feet lower you'd be just as good as he is.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, I'm surprised you decided to come.
LEADMALE:You're not a basketball fan.
LEADFEMALE:True, madam, but I have found that any game can be made interesting if you put a little money on it.
OTHERFEMALE:You bet on this game?
OTHERMALE:$50 says Bel-Air wins it.
LEADFEMALE:Who'd take that bet? You rang, beautiful? Jazz, you bet against Will? Yeah.
LEADMALE:He screws up, I'm loaded.
LEADMALE:Students, parents, alumni, let me introduce our beloved coach Herb Smiley.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:I see a lot of new faces out here tonight faces I didn't see when we were losing.
OTHERFEMALE:People who did not support this team in its darkest hour.
OTHERFEMALE:All I can say is, I don't blame you one bit.
LEADFEMALE:Half the time, I didn't want to be there.
LEADFEMALE:And quite frankly, I usually ducked out a little early.
SUPMALE:But that's all gonna change tonight because of our new superstar Will Smith.
LEADFEMALE:With seven seconds remaining, Bel-Air is down by two points and calls a time out.
OTHERMALE:Our only hope for winning this game is by shooting a three-pointer.
LEADFEMALE:So here's the plan.
LEADMALE:Cartwell, you inbound to Hunt.
LEADFEMALE:Hunt, what do you do?
SUPMALE:Shoot for the three-pointer? Very funny.
SUPFEMALE:That'll be 10 laps, chowderhead.
LEADMALE:What's the right answer?
SUPFEMALE:Pass it to Will.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, let's do it.
OTHERFEMALE:One, two, three, Bel-Air! Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Yes! Thirty, forty, fifty!
LEADMALE:There.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, man.
OTHERMALE:Nice doing business with you.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, the World Snooker Championship is on the sports station in a few moments.
SUPFEMALE:Would you care to place a wager?
LEADFEMALE:I don't know anything about snooker.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you everything you need to know.
SUPMALE:I'm going to shoot some hoops.
LEADMALE:If you'd like to practice some new and more spectacular ways to lose a game, please join me.
LEADFEMALE:Put that down.
SUPFEMALE:Put what down?
LEADFEMALE:My basketball.
LEADMALE:Your basketball? Excuse me, your name is Spalding? Dad gave it to me for my birthday three years ago.
OTHERFEMALE:It's my ball.
SUPMALE:Give it.
LEADMALE:In a bad mood? You should be the happiest guy in the world.
LEADMALE:Yeah? Why? 'Cause you got out of that locker room alive.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, Coach Smiley was upset.
SUPMALE:Boy, you're lucky that was just a starter's pistol.
SUPFEMALE:I was trying to win the game.
SUPFEMALE:No, you were trying to be the hero.
SUPFEMALE:Somebody else can be the hero besides you all the time.
LEADMALE:Let's get something straight.
LEADFEMALE:I been here for two months.
LEADMALE:I been getting yelled at at home screamed at at school, I been sent to detention, grounded threatened with expulsion on almost a daily basis.
LEADFEMALE:I finally do something I get credit for, and you can't take it.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, I got news for you.
LEADMALE:I ain't about to sell myself short just to make you feel better.
SUPFEMALE:Grow up! You should grow up, hogging the ball every chance you get!
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't hogging nothing.
LEADMALE:You were! Okay, you two.
LEADMALE:What's this all about? Carlton doesn't want me to use his basketball 'cause he's afraid I might get it in the basket.
OTHERMALE:Will you two start acting your age? What I saw on that basketball court tonight was a disgrace.
LEADFEMALE:If I'd made that last shot, I'd be the hero right now.
OTHERMALE:Carlton, the fact that you missed the shot wasn't a disgrace.
OTHERFEMALE:You stole the ball from a member of your own team.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and if you'd passed it to me, we would've won.
OTHERMALE:You would? Of course, I can make that shot with my eyes closed
LEADFEMALE:and one hand tied behind my back.
LEADMALE:Was that gonna be your next trick? 'Cause you were like a one-man circus out there.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, the coach told the team to pass the ball to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Did he tell you to woof at the crowd kiss the cheerleader between plays, and shoot the ball backwards? No, I came up with all that fly stuff myself.
SUPFEMALE:That wasn't fly, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:A real star plays with the team.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you should think about that.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, can I ask you something? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:When you stole the ball from Will and tried to make that Hail Mary shot what were you thinking about?
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Really? I guess I was just thinking of the first game Will won and how you ran out on the court and you were so proud of him.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I thought it would be cool if it happened to me.
LEADMALE:Carlton, you don't have to be a hero.
LEADMALE:I'm proud that you're out there giving it all you got.
LEADMALE:You started coming to games when Will joined the team.
OTHERMALE:I wanted to support him.
LEADMALE:You wouldn't come when it was just me.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to come to everything you do.
SUPFEMALE:I always come to your tennis games, to your debate matches your glee club concerts.
LEADMALE:Frankly, keeping up with your extracurricular activities is a 24-hour-a-day job.
LEADMALE:Did I mention I was elected editor of the yearbook? I didn't mean to slight you.
LEADFEMALE:But I can't slight Will, either.
SUPFEMALE:His mother is 3,000 miles away.
LEADFEMALE:He needs a cheering section as much as you do.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe more.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna head up.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, son.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah? Here.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:And so the men and women of Plymouth Colony "sat at a long table with their new-found Indian friends "to celebrate the first Thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:"And at the head of the table, the leader of the pilgrims "folded his hands, bowed his head and said" And then the village idiot interrupted the prayer ruining the feast for one and all.
OTHERMALE:Boy, holiday traffic is starting already.
LEADFEMALE:People are in such a lousy mood.
LEADFEMALE:I learned five new words on the way home.
LEADFEMALE:Did you know what they meant?
SUPFEMALE:I think so.
LEADMALE:They were accompanied by very helpful hand gestures.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I bet you can't wait till your mom gets here.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Thanks for flying her out, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:We had to convince her to accept it.
SUPFEMALE:She never lets us spend a penny on her.
LEADMALE:Apparently, that's not a genetic trait.
LEADMALE:Now, for Thanksgiving do you want to try something different or the traditional turkey? Mother, I have a big problem with turkey.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong with it? From the moment they're hatched to the moment they're shrink-wrapped turkeys are raised to be food, and nothing but food.
OTHERMALE:Hilary, I don't think too many of them had aspirations to be doctors or lawyers.
LEADFEMALE:My sister should be here any minute.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you excited? Yeah, I can't wait till she gets out here and starts taking her usual shots at me.
OTHERFEMALE:Vi's that way with everybody.
SUPMALE:Remember what she said about my beard? You misunderstood.
SUPFEMALE:She said it made me look like Bigfoot.
LEADMALE:Which is ridiculous, because nobody knows what Bigfoot really looks like.
LEADMALE:That's her.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom!
SUPFEMALE:Baby! Goodness gracious! Viv, come on, give us a hug! Look at my boy.
LEADMALE:You really have changed.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'm handsome.
LEADFEMALE:No, you haven't changed.
LEADMALE:I hope he's not eating you out of house and home? Not at all.
LEADFEMALE:He's certainly not taking any food out of your mouth.
OTHERFEMALE:Starting already.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good one, Mama.
LEADMALE:I got to use that one.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't make fun of your uncle.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my job.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go inside.
LEADMALE:Girl, you look wonderful.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:How's everything at the post office?
LEADMALE:They made me a supervisor.
OTHERFEMALE:That's wonderful.
SUPMALE:Honey, they make everybody at the post office a supervisor.
OTHERMALE:You practically have to eat the mail not to get promoted.
OTHERMALE:Aunt Vi.
LEADFEMALE:My goodness, aren't you handsome? And looking less and less like your daddy every day.
SUPFEMALE:Ouch.
SUPMALE:Run for cover, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's he going to hide at? Vi, this is Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, my sister-in-law, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Smith.
LEADMALE:How do you do?
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, check this.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, take my mom's bags to her room.
SUPMALE:What did I do? You can take those bags yourself.
SUPFEMALE:That man is twice your age.
SUPFEMALE:Even though he doesn't look it.
SUPFEMALE:At least take the heavy one.
SUPFEMALE:Now go on.
LEADMALE:But, Mom
LEADFEMALE:You heard me.
LEADMALE:After you, Master William.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, go tell your sisters their aunt is here.
SUPFEMALE:Y'all tell me, has Will been giving you any trouble? He's been wonderful, hasn't he, Philip? Let's just say he takes after you, Vi.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Vi, I was dusting the albums this morning and guess what I found.
OTHERMALE:Certainly not dust.
LEADMALE:The Temptations! Girl, I have that album.
OTHERFEMALE:You had it.
LEADFEMALE:I borrowed it.
SUPMALE:You taught me to dance to this, remember? I didn't teach you to dance like that.
SUPMALE:Move over, girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:Look out.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Vi!
LEADFEMALE:My girls!
LEADFEMALE:You look fantastic.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Dance with us.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:What dance is this? It's called the swim, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:It was very popular in the 1940s.
SUPMALE:The 1960s, and it's not the swim.
LEADMALE:Your daddy knows how to swim.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Swim for her.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody out of the pool.
SUPMALE:That cobbler was delicious.
LEADMALE:The person that invented the elastic waistband should get the Nobel Prize.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I mean
LEADMALE:Don't start.
SUPMALE:Mom, you know who used to make the best cobbler? Old lady lvory down the street.
SUPFEMALE:Does she still make it?
LEADMALE:Honey, she passed on.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Child, she was in her early 100s.
OTHERMALE:You'd have never known by the way she used to swing that baseball bat at me.
OTHERFEMALE:Can we have a moment of silence? Yeah, well.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, Dad, I have a little favor.
SUPFEMALE:My English teacher doesn't have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving tomorrow and I just thought, since he's all alone, and we have so much to share could we invite him to dinner? Certainly, Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:That's very thoughtful.
LEADFEMALE:And not the worst way to pull my grade up to an "A.
LEADMALE:" This sure was lovely.
OTHERMALE:No, Mom, I'll get that for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey! Mom, what did I do? It's all right, Viola, Geoffrey clears the table.
SUPMALE:It's his job.
LEADMALE:You shouted, Master William? Yes, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you have a seat and have some of this delicious peach cobbler
LEADMALE:while we clear the table.
SUPMALE:Don't go through so much trouble.
SUPMALE:No trouble at all.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, Carlton, Ashley, and you Your Highness, let us all clear the table.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good one.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, do I look like I'm telling a joke? Not to me.
LEADMALE:Don't just sit there watching.
SUPFEMALE:Pick up the dishes and get them into the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Now hustle.
SUPMALE:Some guest.
SUPFEMALE:What should I do with these bowls? Just put them in the dishwasher.
LEADMALE:Here? Let's just take them up to Geoffrey's room.
SUPMALE:He'll know what to do with them.
LEADMALE:Lord, have mercy.
LEADFEMALE:Just leave them here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll take care of them.
SUPFEMALE:Now, go on.
LEADMALE:Honestly, I've never seen such a lazy bunch in my life and I work at the post office.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, Jesse!
SUPMALE:How's it going, Will? Mom, this is my man Jesse.
SUPFEMALE:He does the gardening here.
SUPMALE:How you doing?
OTHERMALE:How you doing? Is your aunt around? I want to know where to plant the bushes.
LEADMALE:I think she said she wanted them by the pool.
SUPFEMALE:Could you do me a favor? My mom really likes roses.
LEADMALE:Can you snip a couple for her bedroom?
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a second.
SUPMALE:Honey, don't go bossing him around.
LEADMALE:If you want to cut me some flowers, you go get them yourself.
LEADFEMALE:But, Mom
LEADMALE:Understand? Okay, I'll cut you the most beautiful bouquet in the world but its beauty will pale in comparison to yours.
SUPMALE:Don't even try that Prince Charming stuff.
LEADMALE:Jesse, listen, it's the day before Thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:Take the day off.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:You going to be around here for Christmas? Jesse! Good, I wanted to talk to you about the bushes.
SUPMALE:We can talk about it next week.
LEADFEMALE:Have a happy Thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:Is Jesse leaving? He didn't mow the lawn.
LEADFEMALE:Mom gave him the day off.
LEADMALE:What? It's a holiday.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be cool if the grass grows for another week.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:It's not growing 'cause you going to cut it.
LEADFEMALE:Why me? You always mowed the lawn back home.
LEADMALE:I don't see why can't you do this one.
LEADMALE:'Cause it's the size of a football field! Since when do I have to ask you twice?
SUPMALE:But, Mom
LEADMALE:Now hustle.
LEADMALE:Okay, but I ain't going to cut you no flowers.
SUPFEMALE:You should have talked to me before letting the gardener take the day off.
LEADFEMALE:It's the day before Thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:It was a nice idea, but it's the same thing with telling Geoffrey not to clear the table.
LEADMALE:I just think that they might feel uncomfortable taking orders from somebody they don't know.
LEADMALE:And they'd rather take orders from a 17-year-old boy? What do you mean? Honey, I don't mean to be critical but I don't like what I saw today.
SUPMALE:Will's got a bunch of grown men doing all the work he should be doing.
SUPMALE:I haven't seen him lift a finger except to scratch his head.
LEADFEMALE:You're not being fair, Vi.
SUPMALE:Will works very hard at his homework.
OTHERFEMALE:Back home, Will did his homework, mowed the lawn, raked the leaves and cleared the table.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think a little work around the house is gonna interfere with his education.
OTHERFEMALE:From what I see, all he's learning is how to be a rich kid.
LEADMALE:Philip and I just want Will to have the same advantages that our kids have.
LEADMALE:Isn't that why you sent him out here? I sent him out here to stay out of trouble and get a good education.
SUPMALE:But, Vivian, I also taught that boy the value of hard work and I don't want him to lose that.
LEADMALE:All I know is the kids in this house are getting a free ride a free ride in a fancy car.
LEADMALE:But I don't mean to be critical.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:All done.
SUPMALE:Vivian, since Carlton's invited his teacher maybe you should call the caterers and tell them there'll be one more for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Are you okay?
LEADFEMALE:I'm just fine.
SUPFEMALE:Do you know what my sister just said? You are not gonna believe this.
SUPMALE:She said that our kids are spoiled.
OTHERFEMALE:News flash.
LEADMALE:You mean you agree with her? I keep saying they should do more work around the house.
LEADMALE:You're the one who's too easy on them.
LEADMALE:Really? Does this sound familiar? "Daddy, I need $300.
SUPMALE:" You don't have to get personal.
LEADMALE:Vi just made an honest criticism.
OTHERMALE:Let's just leave it at that.
OTHERMALE:You really think I've been too easy on them.
LEADMALE:Honey, we're not going to solve this overnight.
SUPMALE:Look, let's just have a pleasant Thanksgiving tomorrow and we can talk about it after Vi leaves, okay? Don't forget to call the caterer.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Sally? This is Vivian Banks.
LEADMALE:You had us scheduled for a Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:We'd like to cancel it.
LEADMALE:We're going to have the kids make dinner.
OTHERMALE:What do you mean, good luck? Will, Carlton, Hilary, Ashley! Get down here! Hustle!
OTHERMALE:Did you get the turkey?
LEADFEMALE:Certainly, madam.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, it's frozen solid.
SUPFEMALE:Really, madam? I thought it was just scared.
SUPMALE:Mommy, didn't we just have a fire drill last week?
OTHERFEMALE:This is not a drill.
OTHERMALE:It's a fire? My God, I'm going back for my new suede boots.
LEADFEMALE:Don't try to stop me.
SUPMALE:While you're up there, get my lucky drawers! You are going to cook and serve Thanksgiving dinner.
OTHERMALE:How?
SUPMALE:Why? Because you kids don't do enough work around the house.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? Didn't I just mow Central Park yesterday? Mom, my English teacher is coming to dinner.
LEADFEMALE:He holds my English grade in the palm of his hand.
SUPFEMALE:This is not the time for one of your leftist experiments.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton's right, Mom.
LEADMALE:This stuff about us working could really wait.
LEADMALE:It has a real New Year's resolution feel to it.
LEADFEMALE:I do not want to discuss this.
LEADMALE:Since when do I have to ask you twice?
LEADFEMALE:Every time, Mommy.
LEADMALE:Well, not this time.
LEADMALE:You've got 15 minutes to get up, get dressed, and get back down here.
LEADMALE:Move it! Instead of doing all this work, shouldn't I be spending some time with my mom? I mean, she sees me so little and I'm growing so fast.
LEADFEMALE:Don't even try that Prince Charming stuff.
LEADMALE:Your mother did not send you out here on vacation.
SUPMALE:And so far, you've been getting a free ride, a free ride in a fancy car.
LEADMALE:And if you really want to do something nice for your mother why don't you show her you can do some work here?
LEADFEMALE:But, Aunt Viv
OTHERFEMALE:No discussion.
LEADMALE:Do you realize there's a bump forming back there? All right, these are your assignments.
SUPFEMALE:I'll do the turkey.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, you do the cranberry sauce.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, you do the stuffing.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, you do the yams and the rolls.
LEADMALE:I get two things? Why don't you just put a yoke around my neck and hitch me to a plow? Hilary, I don't think it would be the worst thing in the world if you guys did some work around here.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you guys are getting a fancy ride, a fancy ride in a free car.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry dinner's so late, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Fellows.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
SUPFEMALE:I think in our society, we're too obsessed with time.
LEADMALE:Save time.
LEADMALE:Don't waste time.
LEADFEMALE:Be on time.
SUPMALE:What are we in such a hurry to do? To eat.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Fellows, Carlton always talks about your English class.
LEADMALE:He said you were studying Shakespeare.
SUPFEMALE:This is really exciting.
SUPFEMALE:We're reading Hamlet.
LEADFEMALE:But to make it more relevant to the kids I'm teaching it to them in a rap version I wrote myself.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Lord.
LEADMALE:Peep this.
SUPMALE:"To be in effect "or not to be in effect? "Slamming, man, on the questioning tip.
OTHERMALE:" Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, dinner will be served in 10 minutes.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? It seems that little Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Poppin' Fresh doesn't want to come out of his tube.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps this will persuade him.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, how's the cranberry sauce coming?
SUPMALE:All done.
LEADFEMALE:Darn it!
SUPMALE:Nice going, Carlton!
SUPMALE:Do you want to try to make this? This stuffing is completely dry.
LEADMALE:Look, do I have to do everything myself? Carlton, this isn't exactly brain surgery.
LEADFEMALE:When something is too dry, what do we do? Cream of mushroom soup.
LEADFEMALE:Pour.
SUPMALE:Mix.
LEADMALE:Can you do that?
LEADMALE:Hilary, did you check the yams?
LEADFEMALE:For what? Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:Shall we say grace? Dear Lord, for this food we are about to receive make us truly thankful.
SUPMALE:Amen.
LEADFEMALE:Let's start by serving our guest of honor.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Fellows, care for some yams?
SUPFEMALE:I'd love some.
LEADFEMALE:Interesting.
LEADMALE:I've never had them before with this thick black crust.
SUPMALE:It's Cajun style.
OTHERMALE:Hilary burned them.
LEADMALE:They're just burned on top.
OTHERFEMALE:Once you get underneath it they're totally charred.
LEADMALE:How did you do that? Mom, give Hilary a break.
SUPFEMALE:I think she deserves some credit for putting out the fire.
LEADMALE:Fire? What else do we have? That looks like cranberry sauce, Mr.
SUPMALE:Fellows.
LEADFEMALE:Lay it on me.
SUPMALE:Allow me.
LEADMALE:It looks wonderful.
SUPMALE:Who made it?
LEADFEMALE:I did, Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:It's delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you'd never know Ashley dropped it on the floor.
LEADFEMALE:What about the stuffing? Where's that been? That's dope.
LEADFEMALE:Give it a try, Mr.
SUPMALE:Fellows.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:I made it, Mr.
LEADMALE:Fellows.
SUPMALE:I'm sure you'll find it of grade "A" quality.
SUPFEMALE:Speaking of A's
SUPMALE:Yes? Will is gonna get an "A" in my English class.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations, baby.
LEADMALE:Do you have any news for my parents? Not really.
LEADMALE:So, how about that stuffing? Serve yourself.
LEADMALE:It looks Looks great.
LEADFEMALE:Shall I pass it on? No! You can have all of that.
SUPMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADMALE:Save lots of room.
LEADMALE:Because we have a turkey roasted to perfection by yours truly.
LEADFEMALE:Would you do the honors, Uncle Phil?
SUPMALE:Why, certainly.
SUPMALE:It's frozen inside.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I thawed it as much I could.
LEADFEMALE:What am I supposed to do, sit on it all day? Come on, Vi.
LEADMALE:The kids worked very hard on this.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, "hard" is the word.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see what food we can throw together.
LEADMALE:I know, 'cause Bigfoot is growling.
LEADMALE:Honestly, that dinner was a disaster! That's not true.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Fellows is out there drinking his second cup of stuffing.
LEADMALE:This is certainly one for the books.
LEADMALE:You know, Vi, you really hurt my feelings yesterday.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? When you said I was spoiling Will and my kids.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just trying to give them the things that we didn't have.
OTHERFEMALE:First of all, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
LEADMALE:Seems to me, when we were growing up I'd say a lot worse to you and you'd take it.
SUPMALE:I don't know, I think living in California has made you sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I'm being sensitive, Vi.
LEADFEMALE:You basically called me a bad mother.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, look I don't think you're a bad mother.
SUPFEMALE:I never would've sent Will out here if I thought you were.
LEADFEMALE:I don't blame you for wanting to give those kids everything we didn't have.
LEADFEMALE:But you got to teach them how to work hard, too.
OTHERMALE:That's what I taught you.
LEADMALE:You turned out pretty good.
LEADFEMALE:I got to admit it, Vi, Philip says I'm too easy on them.
SUPMALE:I guess they should have some more responsibilities.
OTHERMALE:It wouldn't kill them.
SUPFEMALE:Food! I wouldn't be taking my time in here.
SUPMALE:I'm on my way.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADMALE:Ma, can I help you in here? No, not from what I saw today.
OTHERFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:You got to learn how to cook before you go to college.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Aunt Viv can teach me.
OTHERFEMALE:She's a great cook.
SUPMALE:She should be.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Yo, G, that was hilarious.
LEADMALE:Put a Barney Rubble head on, I'd swear i was watching Flintstones On Ice.
LEADFEMALE:I'm pleased that I've amused you, Master William.
OTHERFEMALE:It is the least I can do, given the hours of merriment I have derived from looking at the remarkable way your ears protrude from your head.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Butler With an Attitude.
LEADFEMALE:So anyway, Toni's coming over.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna study for our history midterm together.
SUPFEMALE:She really needs help.
LEADMALE:She's not doing well? Daddy, Toni is a dear friend of mine, but she lacks concentration.
LEADMALE:She totally gave up on Twin Peaks.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, Uncle Phil! Did you lose a couple of pounds? Man, you're looking chiseled.
LEADMALE:So what do you want the car for, Will? Public Enemy concert.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz got two tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Every time Jazz is in that car he leaves a small collection of chicken bones behind.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight, we're having ribs.
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy, I wanted to use the car tonight.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to a world peace benefit hosted by Steven Seagal.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't you just hear me ask first? I guess you're right.
SUPMALE:Besides, I'd feel better knowing you had the car.
LEADMALE:Especially if you're gonna be out again until 3:00 in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:That's what time he got in last night.
LEADMALE:Oops, did I say that? No, it was for school, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:I'm doing a term paper on owls.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you've broken curfew entirely too many times.
LEADFEMALE:You are grounded for a week.
OTHERFEMALE:A whole week? Will, being grounded won't be all bad.
LEADMALE:Maybe you'll find enough time to do your own dishes instead of paying Ashley.
SUPMALE:Oops again! Two weeks.
SUPFEMALE:I'm grounded for two weeks?
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:You're to stay in this house, and you're not to go anywhere near that car.
LEADMALE:Can he still rent the car to Jazz? Oops, oops, oops! Let's make it an even month.
LEADMALE:I don't know my own strength.
LEADMALE:Revenge! Miss Toni.
LEADMALE:Hi, Toni.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry I'm late.
LEADMALE:I saw a lady wearing a sweater so ugly I was forced to pull over and yell at her.
LEADMALE:Hi, Toni.
LEADMALE:What are you two up to? The library.
OTHERMALE:Big history exam.
OTHERFEMALE:How did your English midterm go?
LEADMALE:I think I did great, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I think I failed it.
LEADMALE:Will you cut it out? You always say you've failed and then you get the test back and you always get a "D.
SUPFEMALE:" You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I probably did fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:You two have fun at the library.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:A library? I thought we were going shopping.
LEADMALE:We are.
SUPMALE:I was just saying that to her.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:What's this I hear, Hilary? Lying to mommy? I feel that revenge is within my reach.
LEADFEMALE:This is a job for Sherlock Homeboy.
SUPFEMALE:to keep up with Volvo.
LEADFEMALE:Here at Toni's dorm room to determine where suspects went shopping.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see what happens.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, is this Toni Gower's room?
SUPMALE:We're her roommates.
SUPMALE:I'm Kimmy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Cindy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Willie.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Willie.
LEADFEMALE:No, just "Will.
LEADFEMALE:" Can I get you something, Will? No, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to find Hilary Banks.
SUPMALE:There's been a family emergency.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, we don't know her.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, we do.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Toni's friend.
SUPFEMALE:The one who never wears anything twice.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Earth to Kimmy.
LEADFEMALE:I just haven't seen her around since she dropped out of school.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, the midterms must have been a little too much for her.
LEADFEMALE:Midterms? Hilary dropped out three months ago.
OTHERMALE:This family emergency, is it, like, a big one? It's even bigger than I thought.
SUPFEMALE:Looks like I am gonna be pulling another all-nighter.
LEADMALE:I have to get my index cards together for the big debate match next week.
OTHERMALE:What's your topic? "When President Bush said he would never raise taxes "was he lying or just kidding?" Sorry I'm late.
LEADMALE:Time flies when you're studying.
LEADFEMALE:Ain't that the truth, Ruth.
LEADFEMALE:How was your day, honey? It was great.
LEADMALE:I got a lot of work done on my physics research paper.
LEADFEMALE:What? I was just thinking about that funny thing that happened to you today.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? How soon they forget.
OTHERMALE:I'll explain.
LEADMALE:Today after school was out, I went to UCLA and sat in the back of Hilary's physics class.
LEADFEMALE:You did? You remember.
SUPFEMALE:After all, you were in the class.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:You did.
LEADMALE:You remember that funny thing that happened.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, that funny thing.
LEADFEMALE:Tell them about it.
SUPFEMALE:Will sat in the back of my physics class.
SUPMALE:While he was there Will, you tell it so much better.
OTHERMALE:See, I snuck up behind Hilary, right? Her head must have been full with all that studying or something because when she saw me she said my head looked like the basic element of physics.
SUPFEMALE:What was that technical term again? A quark, right? Right.
LEADMALE:Exactly.
OTHERMALE:I said his head looked like a quark.
LEADMALE:Or was it a neutron?
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:No, it was definitely a quark.
SUPFEMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I must have been thinking.
SUPFEMALE:That was a real scream, Will.
SUPMALE:Dinner is served.
LEADMALE:What do you know? First of all, I know that the basic element of physics is matter.
LEADFEMALE:If you were going to do a research paper you'd probably have to know something they taught on the first day.
OTHERFEMALE:How did you find out?
SUPMALE:I have my methods.
SUPFEMALE:It helps that Toni's roommates have the combined IQ of a raisin.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to me, Will.
LEADMALE:You can't tell mom and dad.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? You're not in any position to tell me what I can or cannot do, Miss Thing.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do anything you want.
SUPFEMALE:Just name it.
LEADMALE:Thanks to you, I'm grounded for the next month.
SUPFEMALE:All I want from you is that you make that month as pleasant as possible.
LEADMALE:It's that simple.
LEADMALE:At the risk of sounding redundant, dinner is served.
LEADMALE:We'll be right there, Geoffrey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary?
LEADFEMALE:What? Carry me.
LEADFEMALE:Yes? "Yes," what? Yes, Your Highness?
LEADFEMALE:Have you done His Highness' laundry?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Your Highness.
LEADFEMALE:You forgot His Highness' overalls, his T-shirt, and of course, his pair of lucky drawers.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to want to hand wash these.
SUPMALE:I am not hand washing your drawers.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you are.
OTHERFEMALE:And from now on, you will pronounce the word "draws.
LEADMALE:" Okay, fine.
SUPFEMALE:And His Highness would like to discuss the condition of his royal sneakers.
OTHERMALE:You will clean them with your toothbrush.
SUPFEMALE:Not side to side, though.
SUPFEMALE:Not up and down.
LEADMALE:But a smooth circular motion.
LEADMALE:Do you want me to floss them, too? We are not amused.
LEADMALE:And for this act of treason His Highness would like you to read him a bedtime story.
LEADFEMALE:This is getting really annoying, Will.
OTHERMALE:Okey dokey, have it your way.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil! Aunt Viv! Okay, I'll do it! His Highness would like you to read this Spider-Man comic book.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Let's make this fast.
OTHERMALE:"Spider-Man.
OTHERMALE:By Stan Lee.
LEADFEMALE:" The yellow box 
SUPMALE:"High above Manhattan.
LEADMALE:" And Spider-Man goes, "My spider-sense is buzzing like a beehive.
LEADMALE:" His Highness would like you to describe everything in the picture.
OTHERMALE:Can't you just look at it?
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil! I was just asking.
SUPFEMALE:He's sitting on the edge of some stupid building and there are wavy lines coming out of his head so he's hot, or his head smells or something.
SUPMALE:Anyway Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:That's his spidey-sense.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:There's also something gross coming out of his wrist.
SUPMALE:Is this the guy you don't want to be standing next to at a party, or what? Anyway, this fat guy in a really bad suit grabs him and 
OTHERFEMALE:"Spider-Man, at last we meet again.
SUPFEMALE:" That's Doctor Octopus, but his voice is a lot deeper than that.
LEADMALE:Give it a try.
SUPFEMALE:"At last, we meet again.
OTHERFEMALE:" And it's raspier.
LEADFEMALE:"At last, we meet again.
LEADMALE:" Come on, baby.
SUPMALE:You doggin' it.
SUPFEMALE:"At last, we meet again!" Happy? You have amused us, but His Highness is tired and would like to go to sleep.
LEADMALE:Thank God.
LEADFEMALE:But first, His Highness would like to be tucked in.
SUPFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADMALE:Of course, I'm kidding.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil! Nice and tight! Not too tight.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't want you to suffocate.
OTHERFEMALE:Before you go, we would like you to have this.
OTHERFEMALE:A list of things to do tomorrow night at the dinner table.
LEADMALE:Like what? Please, we do not wish them read in our presence.
SUPFEMALE:Be gone! Carlton, I'm living a nightmare.
LEADMALE:Hilary, I'd love to talk to you but I'm staring down the barrel of an all-nighter.
SUPMALE:Please, Carlton, I need help! I'm coming to you because I know how much you don't like Will.
LEADFEMALE:Will Smith is a fine young man.
SUPMALE:Come off it, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:You're talking to me now.
LEADFEMALE:We've let Will wreak havoc in our lives for too long.
OTHERFEMALE:And now it's time to band against him as brother and sister.
SUPFEMALE:What have you got in mind? That's what I need you for.
SUPMALE:I don't have any plans, I just want to punish him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm very vindictive, I'm just not imaginative.
LEADFEMALE:Whether or not I want to punish Will and for the record, I haven't come out pro or con why are you so mad at him? It's a long story, but you have to promise not to tell anybody.
SUPMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:First of all, I dropped out of college.
OTHERFEMALE:I know!
SUPFEMALE:Mom and Dad are gonna kill you.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but the worst thing is Will found out.
SUPFEMALE:Now he's using it to make me do all kinds of humiliating things.
LEADMALE:Like what? He's making me clean his sneakers.
OTHERMALE:Really?
SUPFEMALE:It gets worse.
OTHERMALE:I have to hand wash his lucky "draws.
LEADMALE:"
LEADMALE:Disgusting.
LEADMALE:And this is his 
OTHERMALE:He gave me a list of embarrassing things I have to do at dinner tomorrow night.
SUPFEMALE:That's awful.
LEADMALE:Is he making you clean his room?
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Will you clean mine? I'm sorry, but this is too good to be true.
OTHERMALE:Why should Will have all the fun?
OTHERMALE:Why, you little
LEADFEMALE:Dad? I hate you! Be that as it may I want these debate cards typed by tomorrow morning.
OTHERMALE:Double-spaced.
LEADMALE:Today was Career Day and Teresa's dad came in to speak to us.
LEADMALE:Really? What does he do? Joan Rivers.
OTHERMALE:He's a plastic surgeon.
LEADMALE:Dinner is served.
LEADMALE:What? Did you memorize that list of things I gave you to do at dinner tonight? Yes.
SUPMALE:Just to be on the safe side, let's have a little pop quiz.
SUPFEMALE:Number 
LEADMALE:Any time Uncle Phil takes a drink, what do you do?
SUPFEMALE:I compliment you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes! Did you memorize the list of compliments?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, very good.
SUPFEMALE:Number 
LEADMALE:Any time anyone says "Hilary," what do you do? I bark like a dog.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right! See you at dinner.
SUPMALE:Will, if you have an ounce of compassion, you'll let me off the hook.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's a good point.
LEADFEMALE:No, we'll do it anyway.
LEADMALE:It's dinner time.
OTHERMALE:Did you memorize our list?
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Let's just review.
LEADFEMALE:What do you do when I hit my glass with my spoon? I insult Will.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:And what do you do when I clear my throat? I smack Will upside the head.
LEADFEMALE:Damn it, you're prepared! Let's go! For these gifts we are about to receive may the Lord make us truly thankful.
SUPMALE:Amen.
SUPFEMALE:Amen.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, how were your classes today? Fine.
LEADMALE:I just wish my students would concentrate more on their work.
SUPMALE:They're very easily distracted.
SUPMALE:I see it every day.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you, Hilary?
LEADFEMALE:Did you say something, sweetie?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Will Smith is perfect.
LEADMALE:Why, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:It's so nice to be appreciated.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, but perhaps another time.
OTHERFEMALE:Your mother would appreciate it if she weren't interrupted again.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:Anyway, as I was saying Will Smith is the king of the universe.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, thank you.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to finish my story, if that's okay with you, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary? Look, I know everyone gets a little silly around midterms but not at the dinner table.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Will Smith is the scum of the earth.
LEADMALE:Hilary! However, Will Smith is the pinnacle of manliness.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary! What's with Hilary? Stop it! I can't take it anymore! I dropped out of school! There! You did what?
LEADFEMALE:I dropped out of school.
LEADMALE:You dropped out of school?
OTHERMALE:When did this happen?
LEADMALE:Three months ago.
OTHERFEMALE:Three months ago?
LEADMALE:And you've been lying to us since then?
LEADFEMALE:Three months ago?
LEADFEMALE:Let me explain.
LEADMALE:Three months ago?
SUPFEMALE:Mother, please just let me explain.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not interested.
LEADFEMALE:You've been lying to us.
SUPMALE:And if you think for one minute
SUPMALE:Philip, wait.
SUPFEMALE:Will, Carlton, Ashley, take your dinner into the kitchen.
SUPMALE:Thanks a lot, Will.
SUPMALE:Man, they've been in there for an hour.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder what Hilary told Mom and Dad about our part in all this.
SUPMALE:I think it's pretty safe to assume she sang like a canary.
LEADFEMALE:There's no need to worry.
SUPMALE:She's been lying to them for three months.
LEADFEMALE:We can punch holes in her credibility.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, Dad, awfully sad about what happened to Hilary.
OTHERMALE:Hope her crazy lies don't drag down anyone else.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, sit.
OTHERMALE:Maybe we haven't been clear enough about the rules of this house.
LEADFEMALE:You are not to blackmail other members of this family.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I didn't know.
SUPMALE:You two are grounded for a month.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, added to the month you already have that should pretty much take you into fiscal '91.
LEADFEMALE:Dad!
LEADMALE:You are excused.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:I've been thinking.
SUPMALE:About what?
OTHERMALE:You know, what Hilary said to us.
LEADFEMALE:That I put too much pressure on her.
LEADMALE:That it's hard living up to a mother who's a college professor.
OTHERMALE:That I made her feel that she could never come to us and admit she failed.
LEADFEMALE:You mean you bought that crap? Mom, Dad, can I say something? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I've been thinking.
LEADMALE:And I decided that I'll do whatever you want me to do to make things better.
LEADMALE:And exactly what would that be? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever you want me to do.
LEADMALE:Hilary, that's the problem.
LEADMALE:We've been making all the decisions for you.
OTHERFEMALE:You're 21 years old.
SUPMALE:It's time for you to make your own decisions.
OTHERMALE:If you weren't getting anything out of college and wanted to drop out you should have told us and not tried to hide it like a kid.
LEADMALE:But I thought you wanted me to go to college.
LEADMALE:We want you to go to college when you'll appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:It's not to make us happy.
SUPFEMALE:It's to make something of your life.
OTHERFEMALE:We just want you to be all you can be.
SUPMALE:You want me to join the Army? Let's try this again.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary, what do you want to do with your life? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I guess I'll have to think about it.
SUPFEMALE:While you're thinking about it, you're going to get yourself a job.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Dad? What kind of job do you want me to get? I'm not talking to you.
LEADMALE:Look, straight up.
LEADMALE:I didn't know you'd break down like that.
SUPMALE:You walk around here like nothing bothers you.
LEADFEMALE:And I guess I took it a little too far, and I just wanna say I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, now.
SUPFEMALE:An hour ago you were ready to tell on me.
LEADMALE:You tripping! I was never going to tell on you.
SUPFEMALE:Really?
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, of course not.
LEADFEMALE:How about you, Carlton? We're dealing in hypotheticals here.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:I wasn't going to tell.
OTHERMALE:Does that little placebo make either of you feel any better? So, I guess you're gonna hate me forever, right? I thought about it.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I brought this whole thing on myself.
LEADMALE:If I hadn't gotten you grounded, you wouldn't have blackmailed me.
LEADFEMALE:So, I've learned my lesson.
LEADMALE:And we're even.
LEADMALE:That's decent, Hilary.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Before you go as my last official act of servitude, I did finish your laundry.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe I made you do that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:What's done is done.
SUPFEMALE:My lucky "draws"! 
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I wish I could see your sister's face when she finds Courtney's frog in her bed.
LEADFEMALE:You and me both.
SUPMALE:This is gonna be good.
LEADFEMALE:If she doesn't scream soon, I'm gonna have to give my frog a drink.
LEADMALE:Ferdinand gets dehydrated.
LEADMALE:It's Will and Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:Open up.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:We're all gonna die.
LEADMALE:We wanted to say good night.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to bed just as soon as we finish this frog-leg soup.
LEADMALE:Frog-leg soup?
LEADMALE:It's mm-mm good.
LEADMALE:I wish you could have some but there wasn't enough frog to make more than two bowls.
LEADMALE:Can I have a bite?
LEADFEMALE:Sasha, they're eating Ferdinand.
SUPMALE:Ferdinand? This is a guy frog? Nighty-night.
LEADFEMALE:Don't let the snails bite.
SUPMALE:Snails? That's funny, I thought she said she put snakes in your sleeping bags.
LEADFEMALE:Psych!
SUPMALE:That means "just kidding.
LEADFEMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:Nighty-night.
LEADMALE:Will? Will you tell us a scary story before you go, please? Okay, but I hope everybody's ready to be scared to death.
SUPFEMALE:Yes! Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Hold up.
OTHERMALE:Scream for me one time.
SUPMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:I got a scary story, but I have to warn you it's really, truly frightening.
OTHERFEMALE:Any of you have pacemakers on?
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:See, what makes this story so scary is that it's true.
SUPMALE:It happened to a guy named Will bert.
LEADFEMALE:Wilbert Smith sonian.
LEADMALE:See, Wilbert Smithsonian grew up in Philly.
SUPFEMALE:He went to school in the 'hood, right? But this school he went to was so tough I mean, it was graffiti everywhere, even on the principal.
LEADMALE:But that's not the scary part.
LEADMALE:It all happened right here in Bel-Air when Wilbert was transferred to a private school.
SUPMALE:It was a living nightmare.
LEADFEMALE:Enter as boys, leave as men?!?! How long they trying to keep us here? Banker, what do you know?
LEADFEMALE:It's who you know that counts.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, how you doing?
SUPFEMALE:Wallace.
LEADFEMALE:Chadster!
LEADMALE:Bankster!
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like you to meet my cousin Willster! So, Studmaster General, what's the word on co-ed tennis camp? I really got a lot out of it, amigo.
SUPFEMALE:Scored big on and off the court.
LEADMALE:Way to play.
OTHERMALE:I kid you not, Will, women faint at this man's feet.
SUPFEMALE:Odor-Eaters work for me.
LEADMALE:Outrageous.
SUPMALE:This guy's seriously twisted.
OTHERFEMALE:He gets in a good one now and then.
SUPMALE:Will, this is Simon Stanhope, our student council president.
SUPFEMALE:It's my job here to give you the tour.
SUPMALE:I took the Universal Tour.
LEADFEMALE:You know that earthquake ride? Look out! Here comes the subway car! Excuse my cousin.
LEADFEMALE:He just doesn't know.
SUPMALE:As I was saying, this is our founder and those are the first students of the Bel-Air Academy and they all carved their names on this the alumni desk.
SUPFEMALE:And these are the championship oars that we retired in 1957.
OTHERFEMALE:Y'all don't throw nothing away.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Edward Fellows III, but call me Ned, okay? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You've been assigned to my lit class, so I read your records.
LEADMALE:I just wanted to say, we're both coming from the same place.
LEADMALE:You're from Philly? Shaker Heights, Ohio.
LEADFEMALE:But when I was doing research on my main man Langston Hughes, I lived in Harlem.
LEADMALE:And believe me, those two weeks changed my life.
LEADMALE:"I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young "I built my hut by the Congo and it lulled me to sleep "My soul has grown deep like the waters" I can tell.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, I've got a mean collection of jazz platters.
SUPFEMALE:Anytime you feel like grooving, come over and get down with my bad self.
LEADMALE:Seriously, you have any problems, any questions? Where are all the fly honeys at?
LEADMALE:Fly honeys?
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, girls.
LEADFEMALE:Will, didn't anybody tell you this is an all-boys school? Greetings Bel-Airdales.
LEADMALE:We're the Alligaroos.
LEADMALE:And we'd like to take this opportunity to tell you new students to Then Wilbert saw their evil plan.
SUPMALE:They were trying to break him down.
SUPFEMALE:First, they told him it was an all-boys school.
SUPMALE:Then they tortured him with a half an hour of Broadway show tunes.
OTHERFEMALE:But he wouldn't break.
LEADMALE:Then they went ballistic.
LEADFEMALE:They brought in the evil teacher, Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bloat.
LEADFEMALE:Enter the Bloat.
LEADFEMALE:Five, four, three, two I am Dr B, period, Langford Oates.
LEADMALE:And you are Alan, Banks, Downer, Fales, Hunt, Lieberbaum, Smith William Smith.
LEADMALE:Stanhope, Sterling, Svenson Yo!
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Svenson?
SUPMALE:Ja? Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith, how good of you to join us.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Smith, look around.
LEADFEMALE:Do you see any difference between yourself and the other young gentlemen? Is that like a trick question? The tie, Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith.
LEADFEMALE:The tie.
SUPMALE:Kindly consult that section of the rule book pertaining to neckwear.
LEADMALE:You mean Section 3, Paragraph 4, which 
LEADFEMALE:"A tie must be worn with a Windsor knot.
OTHERMALE:" But it doesn't say where.
LEADMALE:Take a seat.
LEADMALE:Now may we turn our attention to history? Thomas Paine once wrote
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Smith?
SUPFEMALE:Weren't you the bad guy in Goldfinger?
LEADFEMALE:Smooth.
LEADFEMALE:Looking great.
SUPFEMALE:Sharp.
SUPMALE:Look at that.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a little something I put together.
LEADMALE:Smith, ho!
SUPFEMALE:My man Lieberbaum.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:First name Kellogg.
SUPMALE:Listen, Cornflake.
OTHERMALE:"Ho" is definitely not a word that you want to yell.
LEADFEMALE:I think the word you're looking for is "yo.
SUPMALE:" "Yo"? Yeah.
LEADMALE:It'll be easy to remember.
LEADFEMALE:It's like "oy" backwards.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:Yo.
LEADMALE:Will, may I have a word? You got something you want to say to me, man? Can you be serious for just one moment? Will, this is your first day.
LEADMALE:And I think you're rubbing a lot of people the wrong way.
LEADMALE:Carlton, here in Boys Town I don't want to rub anybody any way.
OTHERMALE:That's not funny.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing you say is funny.
LEADMALE:What, did you like pass out in history class? I had them rolling.
LEADFEMALE:The people who count were laughing at you, not with you.
LEADMALE:I mean it, Will.
OTHERMALE:When you're snubbed, don't say that I did not warn you.
SUPMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADMALE:How's it going?
OTHERFEMALE:There you are.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, here comes Chadney.
LEADFEMALE:Just lay low and watch how it's done.
SUPFEMALE:Are you free this weekend, Smithy? My parents are throwing a weekend bash at our compound in Malibu.
LEADMALE:Badminton, the lobster boil, you know, the usual.
LEADMALE:Yes, the usual.
LEADFEMALE:The Chadster's Malibu bashes are legendary.
SUPMALE:Carlton, you should come, too.
LEADFEMALE:Bang-bang.
LEADFEMALE:My man Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Master William.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I could go for right now?
LEADFEMALE:Some pati.
OTHERFEMALE:Then by all means, go.
LEADMALE:Might I recommend the gourmet deli on Roxbury? When I said I could go for it, I mean, like, I want it like you go for it.
SUPMALE:Wilbert thought his first day at Bel-Air Academy was a big success.
SUPMALE:When he told his aunt and uncle, they were thrilled.
LEADMALE:This is cause for celebration.
OTHERMALE:Geoffrey, Will did well at school.
LEADFEMALE:This calls for champagne.
SUPMALE:There's been a tragedy at the school.
LEADFEMALE:The alumni desk has been cruelly and wantonly defaced.
LEADMALE:What happened?
SUPMALE:Someone carved the word "fresh" in it.
LEADFEMALE:And they have a theory about the person who did it.
LEADMALE:They do? They think it was a freshman who got halfway through and lost his cool.
LEADFEMALE:He lost his cool? That's funny.
OTHERMALE:"Fresh" means cool, right, Will? I can't keep up with this crazy teenage slang.
LEADFEMALE:But I thought they call you the Fresh Prince.
LEADMALE:Day damn one, Vivian.
LEADMALE:Champagne.
LEADFEMALE:Cork it.
OTHERMALE:All I can say to you, Will, is tsk squared.
SUPFEMALE:You thought you had the school all figured out.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:You didn't need my advice.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Carlton, what is your brilliant advice? I'll tell you.
OTHERMALE:You've gotta march straight into school tomorrow and confess.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious, Will.
LEADMALE:There's such a thing as the honor code.
LEADMALE:There's such a thing as dog dumb, too.
SUPFEMALE:You don't intend to tell them?
LEADMALE:Maybe on my deathbed.
LEADMALE:Then on your conscience be it.
LEADMALE:Before we begin the class, I must speak about the atrocious defiling of our sacred alumni desk.
LEADMALE:Fingerprint analysis has shown it is the handiwork of our resident hoodlum, William Smith.
LEADMALE:And may we turn our attention to another important figure in American history.
LEADFEMALE:Dolley Madison was one of our most influential First Ladies and not, as Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Smith contends the manufacturer of Ring Dings.
SUPMALE:In the short time left, I'd like to address the infamous act of vandalism which occurred here yesterday.
LEADMALE:The desecration of our desk is indeed sad but even sadder is the fact that no one has yet come forward with a confession.
LEADFEMALE:So if any of you may know
LEADFEMALE:He did it.
LEADFEMALE:Can you believe it? Wilbert was accused by his evil cousin Carlton I mean, Carlbert.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get what's scary about this story.
SUPFEMALE:There aren't any werewolves or vampires or anything.
SUPFEMALE:But we're coming to the scary part.
SUPFEMALE:Poor Wilbert was brought to trial before the scariest monsters of 
OTHERMALE:Preppies.
LEADFEMALE:As president of student council, I declare this tribunal in session.
LEADFEMALE:Let's begin by hearing from Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Smith.
LEADMALE:Will, will you finally take my advice? Let me do the talking for you.
LEADMALE:Gentlemen, my cousin has committed a vicious crime.
LEADFEMALE:He could not be guiltier.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:That's what I would have said.
LEADFEMALE:The fact is, young Will has not yet developed the social skills to adapt to the rarefied atmosphere of Bel-Air Academy or parties in Malibu.
SUPMALE:I recommend we put him on probation, ban him from all clubs sports, special events, the Alligaroos.
LEADFEMALE:No, not the Alligaroos.
LEADMALE:Probation is not enough.
LEADFEMALE:If Smith isn't expelled, it will be an invitation to anarchy.
OTHERFEMALE:I have to say that I am appalled at this tribunal's lack of sensitivity.
SUPMALE:Speak on, bro.
OTHERMALE:We can't judge Will Smith by our standards.
LEADMALE:He doesn't even speak our language.
LEADMALE:Where he grew up, the word "bad" means "good.
OTHERMALE:" Doesn't that say it all? Fight the power.
SUPFEMALE:Will, do you have anything to say?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't think y'all was gonna get so mad for me writing my name on an old desk.
LEADFEMALE:I'd never write my name on a new desk.
LEADMALE:That's vandalism.
LEADMALE:But those guys, they carved their name in a new desk.
LEADFEMALE:They got their picture on the wall.
LEADMALE:That's totally different.
LEADFEMALE:They carved their names so people would remember them as part of the school.
LEADMALE:That's why I did it.
LEADMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:You're trying to ruin our school.
LEADFEMALE:No, he isn't.
LEADMALE:Lieberbaum, you're out of order.
LEADMALE:But he's not ruining the school.
LEADMALE:He's making it better.
LEADFEMALE:Word up, Cornflake.
SUPMALE:I don't mean to dis you guys but if Will's expelled, I'm leaving, too and I'm taking my dad's checkbook with me.
LEADMALE:Free Will! I'm going to bed.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope you realize how lucky you were that you weren't kicked out of school.
SUPFEMALE:Lucky? I gotta work every day after school to pay off the desk repair.
LEADMALE:Before I cry myself to sleep may I leave you with a few words of advice? If at some point tomorrow, or during my lifetime for that matter you come up with another brilliant idea for something to do at school, stop.
LEADMALE:Do nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Just stand there doing nothing saying nothing arms at your side like a zombie.
LEADMALE:Breathing just enough to keep the blood circulating.
SUPFEMALE:And no more.
OTHERMALE:Could you do that for me? I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I wasn't listening.
OTHERFEMALE:What did you say? Good night, Will.
LEADMALE:Lock your door when you go to bed.
SUPMALE:Will, before I go to bed, I just want to say I was proud of you tonight, old sport.
LEADFEMALE:Kudos.
LEADFEMALE:You took your punishment like a man.
SUPMALE:That's all you got to say?
SUPMALE:Good night?
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, you Five-Oed me, man.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me?
SUPFEMALE:You dimed me out.
SUPMALE:Pardon? You tattled on me, all right? I did it for your own good.
LEADMALE:You weren't going to tell.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you know? You didn't give me a chance.
LEADFEMALE:You're not worried about my own good.
SUPFEMALE:You're just worried about yourself.
LEADMALE:It may seem like that to you now, but one day, you will Carlton, shut up! I know what this is about.
SUPMALE:You thought you were this big hotshot at school and I was gonna be your little charity case, but I took your juice.
LEADMALE:Let me explain something to you.
LEADMALE:In this society, we have this silly little thing called order and we have rules to preserve that order.
LEADMALE:If we let people break the rules, there would be chaos.
LEADMALE:We have rules where I'm from, too.
SUPMALE:And they say you don't rat on people.
SUPMALE:The more you cling to your old ways and refuse to listen to reality the harder it's going to be for you to fit in with my friends.
LEADFEMALE:You just don't get it, do you, man? I don't want your friends.
LEADFEMALE:All right? If I woke up one morning and I had all of your friends and I was an Alligaroo and I wore those cute shirts with the little horses on them I'd jump off the Empire State Building and hope to catch my eyelid on a nail.
LEADFEMALE:With quips like that, it's no wonder you're the toast of the town.
LEADMALE:Good night, Will.
SUPMALE:Master William.
LEADFEMALE:I have been informed that due to your new after-school employment you will no longer be requiring your customary 4:00 snack.
OTHERFEMALE:Could this be true? Yeah, afraid so, G.
LEADFEMALE:I might not even get home till dinner time, if that early.
LEADMALE:What a pity.
SUPFEMALE:Out of curiosity just what is the nature of your enforced labor? Kitchen duty.
OTHERMALE:Fetching, cleaning, carrying, that kind of stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Indeed.
SUPMALE:Oh, well.
LEADMALE:Chin up.
LEADFEMALE:Picture this if you will my man Wilbert in a kitchen with a hair net on his head.
LEADFEMALE:If that's not a scary thought, I don't know what is.
OTHERMALE:So look.
LEADFEMALE:You all gotta do me a favor.
SUPFEMALE:Raise your right hand.
SUPFEMALE:I want your solemn promise that if any of you ever meets Wilbert Smithsonian you won't tell him I told you this story, okay?
LEADFEMALE:Swear?
LEADFEMALE:I swear, Wilbert Smithsonian.
OTHERFEMALE:Will's cold busted.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:And then came the Third Day of Christmas and still no one had made a present for Santa.
SUPMALE:Whom shall I ask to help me, boys and girls? I know.
SUPMALE:Ask the reindeer on your left hand.
LEADMALE:I'd love to help but I have my hooves full as it is.
LEADMALE:I get it.
SUPMALE:His hooves are full.
LEADMALE:He don't have no hands, I get it.
SUPMALE:Hey, G, I did not see that coming.
SUPMALE:This is dope, right, Ash?
OTHERMALE:Ashley!
SUPMALE:I'm awake.
LEADMALE:I don't know why I bother.
LEADFEMALE:It's impossible to compete with tawdry entertainment like MTV, Nintendo the new children on the block.
SUPMALE:Thanks a lot, Ash.
LEADMALE:Now I'll never know how the story ends.
LEADMALE:I really wanted to know what Santa got for Christmas.
OTHERMALE:He doesn't get an actual gift, Will.
LEADFEMALE:He gets the love of all the little children in the world.
SUPMALE:Really? What a gyp.
SUPMALE:Come on, Will.
SUPMALE:Everyone knows there's no Santa Claus.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, there is no Milli Vanilli but there definitely is a Santa Claus.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, Ash, let's write our letters to Santa Claus.
LEADMALE:Here, you can help me with my list.
SUPMALE:How do you spell "Vanessa Williams"? Don't you have anything better to do with Christmas vacation than writing a silly letter? What are you gonna do with your vacation? Play with your friends? I wish I had someone to play with but every year my friends all go out of town and I'm stuck here all alone.
OTHERMALE:You can still have fun while you're here.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to.
LEADFEMALE:I've decided to learn a new word every day.
OTHERMALE:Ashley, that's boring.
OTHERMALE:Really? I think it's very autodidactic.
OTHERMALE:Christmas vacation is finally here.
LEADFEMALE:God help me, I do love it so.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you liked school, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Ash, I think Bel-Air Academy is one of the best schools in the country.
SUPFEMALE:Its academics and sports program are excellent, and the faculty is first-rate but around December 10, it starts to get a little old.
OTHERMALE:Know what I mean? Carlton, we got a problem.
SUPFEMALE:Your sister, 10 years old and doesn't know the meaning of Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:I know the meaning of "undulate.
SUPMALE:" I don't know where this Christmas thing's going, but I've got bigger fish to fry.
LEADMALE:I've got to raise $600 more for my Glee Club ski trip.
LEADMALE:Give you $1 if you shave your head.
SUPFEMALE:I've booked the Alligaroos to sing at a bunch of Christmas parties.
LEADMALE:If we make enough money, on December 26 we'll all be Imitating Jerry Lewis? I've got to rehearse now.
LEADFEMALE:Guys, let's use this room.
SUPFEMALE:Let's start with our opening number.
SUPFEMALE:Five, six, five, six, seven, and Hold it! What the bloody hell kind of song is that? What do you mean? A little kid sees his mom tongue-wrestling with Santa Claus? Will, it's his father dressed up like Santa Claus.
OTHERMALE:Why'd he dress up like I get it.
LEADFEMALE:I dress up like Santa Claus.
LEADFEMALE:You dress up like the Easter Bunny.
LEADMALE:That makes me sick.
LEADMALE:We're putting together a program for Jonathan's parents' party tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Jonathan's stepfather is a record producer and he asked us not to do tired old Christmas carols.
LEADMALE:Here's our program.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You Don't Bring Me Flowers People Who Need People, The Way We Were.
SUPMALE:Who's coming down the chimney, Barbra Streisand? You've been to my parents' parties? That would be fantastic.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Also, I want to send a box of the fancy chocolate-covered pretzels to Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Patrick Swayze.
SUPMALE:Right.
OTHERFEMALE:The card should 
LEADMALE:"Pat, saw these and immediately thought of you.
OTHERMALE:Love, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:XXX.
LEADFEMALE:" Send the same thing to Kevin Costner, Michelle Pfeiffer and Sting.
SUPMALE:Great, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:That takes care of the A-list.
LEADMALE:Now, should I send the box of pears or the meat thermometer to Steve Guttenberg? Hilary, I hate to inject some reality into these proceedings but who you trying to fool, baby? What do you mean? You always walk around fronting like you know all these famous people.
LEADMALE:You don't know nobody.
SUPMALE:Will, you are so jaded and skeptical.
SUPMALE:You remind me so much of Judd Nelson.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, we'll spend an hour at your office party, then we'll come home.
LEADMALE:I have papers to grade.
SUPMALE:Okay, but first things first.
LEADMALE:Do you remember the names of all my partners' wives? Yes.
LEADMALE:Who is George Meyer's wife?
OTHERFEMALE:Eunice.
SUPFEMALE:That was last year.
LEADFEMALE:The new wife's name is Kelly.
OTHERMALE:Kelly? Walter's secretary?
LEADMALE:Now, who is Jack Fitzgerald's wife?
LEADFEMALE:Doris.
OTHERFEMALE:The correct answer is Heather, formerly the muffin-cart girl.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:How many new wives are going to be at this party? Let's put it this way, Vivian.
LEADMALE:You're the only repeat.
SUPMALE:Hold up.
LEADMALE:You guys going to a Christmas party?
LEADMALE:It's just an office Christmas party.
LEADFEMALE:I remember ours back in Philly.
LEADFEMALE:The building would be filled with the sounds of Christmas.
OTHERFEMALE:Jingle bells and singing and laughing.
LEADFEMALE:Then at the end of the evening, the traditional police sirens.
LEADMALE:Those were the days.
LEADMALE:I'll just go bring the car around.
LEADMALE:Aunt Viv, does this neighborhood do anything special for Christmas? Not really.
LEADMALE:Last year, President Reagan's Secret Service agents dressed up as Santa and warned everyone to keep their distance.
LEADMALE:That was kind of festive.
LEADMALE:Aunt Viv, this is terrible.
SUPFEMALE:People in Bel-Air don't know how to celebrate Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:I'm worried about Ashley.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? Growing up in Bel-Air, she never had a real Christmas.
LEADMALE:There's no sledding, there's no caroling there's no winos making snow angels on the front lawn.
SUPMALE:You don't even decorate the living room.
LEADMALE:Yes, we do.
LEADMALE:We've already started.
SUPMALE:The poinsettias, the red candles and here's the beautiful crystal nativity your uncle gave me for Christmas years ago.
LEADFEMALE:Where's little baby Jesus?
SUPFEMALE:Right there.
LEADFEMALE:That little disk? There are more decorations coming.
LEADMALE:A wonderful shop in Beverly Hills comes to the house, sets up the tree and decorates it for us.
SUPMALE:Do they open your presents and wear your sweaters, too? If you want to show Ashley a little more of the Christmas spirit why don't you go to the shop, pick up the decorations and you and Ashley can decorate it yourself, okay? All right, then.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to be hype.
LEADFEMALE:Have fun at the office Christmas party.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, I'm looking forward to meeting all the new wives.
SUPMALE:I hope they bring their Barbie dolls.
SUPFEMALE:Will, were you vociferating for me? I got to get back to you on that.
SUPFEMALE:You want to go to Beverly Hills with me and get the decorations?
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:We can sing Christmas songs all the way.
LEADMALE:Great.
OTHERFEMALE:Here's one Carlton taught me.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Merry Christmas.
LEADMALE:Aren't these figures outstanding? They're beyond outstanding, they're deeply beyond.
LEADMALE:They're hand-carved.
SUPMALE:We import them from Poland.
OTHERFEMALE:We're looking for some Christmas decorations.
LEADMALE:Let me show you something we're doing now that's deeply happening.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a Caribbean Christmas tree.
LEADFEMALE:It's very big in London, it's beyond big.
SUPMALE:It's all about very hot oranges and very intense yellows.
LEADFEMALE:I feel it's a very vibrant tree, and I feel it's a very important tree.
LEADMALE:We're just picking up the decorations for my mother, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Banks.
SUPMALE:Yeah, she phoned and told me you'd be putting them up yourselves this year, which is fine.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll save yourself a little money, which is a good thing because the '90s are going to be all about restraint.
LEADMALE:Is this the wreath for the door? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Let's talk about that wreath for a moment, if you will.
OTHERFEMALE:Last year, I was so deeply into the distant salmons and the sandy beiges.
OTHERMALE:But this year I went more with the muted roses with these little arrogant touches of celadon and periwinkle.
LEADMALE:I think it worked out quite nice.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's try something wild here, you know? Do you have anything red or green or, I don't know, maybe something like a Santa Claus? It's been done.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse us.
SUPFEMALE:These decorations are wack.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll save Aunt Viv a lot of money and buy them somewhere else.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:You forgot your box of decorations.
SUPMALE:No, you see, we're going to do our own decorations this year.
SUPFEMALE:It's going to be about arrogant little elves and rambunctious reindeer and little men in red suits.
OTHERFEMALE:I think it will be deeply, deeply dope.
LEADMALE:We should've left that stupid office party an hour earlier.
LEADMALE:I still have 30 papers to grade.
LEADMALE:We're both busy, but we can't work in the car so why don't we take this time to relax a bit? You're right.
LEADFEMALE:Look how nicely they decorated the house on the corner.
SUPMALE:Those white lights on the tree outside.
SUPFEMALE:Just the right touch of lights.
OTHERMALE:A little goes a long way, you know.
LEADMALE:God, I used to love Christmas when I was little.
OTHERMALE:Now it just rushes by in one big blur.
LEADFEMALE:Christmas is more for kids.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, even though we're busy I think we should do something nice for Will.
LEADFEMALE:Must be hard for him spending Christmas in a strange place.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're right, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:We'll do something nice for him.
SUPFEMALE:Surprise!
LEADMALE:Ashley, sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Will?
LEADMALE:Aren't you surprised, Mommy?
LEADMALE:Where is Will? I had so much fun today with Will, you can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Surprise! Look, it's Will.
LEADFEMALE:Will, what happened at the Christmas shop? Aunt Viv, they were trying to rip you off.
OTHERFEMALE:So me and Ashley went down to the Pick 'n' Grab.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Yes, this is Philip Banks.
OTHERFEMALE:You saw our lights.
LEADMALE:The blinking Frosty the Snowman is riling your attack dogs.
LEADFEMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADMALE:Our neighbors are furious.
LEADMALE:We must take down the lights.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, I bet there's a lot of neighbors that love those decorations.
SUPMALE:I mean, certainly anyone who possesses good taste.
OTHERMALE:Banks residence.
LEADFEMALE:Have a holly, jolly Christmas.
SUPMALE:Brother, you got a problem with my lights? Why don't you come tell me that to my face, then? You can do whatever you want to do.
LEADFEMALE:It's your world, squirrel.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just trying to get a nut.
OTHERMALE:What? We can do this.
LEADMALE:That was clever, Trevor.
LEADMALE:Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Madam, sir.
LEADMALE:A group of your neighbors have assembled on the front lawn.
SUPFEMALE:They're looking at your Christmas decorations and growing enraged.
LEADMALE:They are threatening to burn Frosty in effigy.
SUPFEMALE:We'd better get out there.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey, thanks for helping us put up those Christmas decorations.
SUPFEMALE:I'd have never had the guts to climb up on that roof with that reindeer strapped on my back.
LEADFEMALE:Anything in the name of Christmas, Master William.
LEADFEMALE:Your aunt and uncle didn't suspect anything, did they? No.
SUPMALE:Still, I think it's best we avoid eye contact for the rest of the evening.
OTHERMALE:Should I talk to them? Or do you want to?
SUPMALE:No, I'll give it a try.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, can I offer a suggestion?
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:They're our neighbors and they're upset.
SUPMALE:It's up to us to make sure that this doesn't ruin their Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:There's only one way to do that.
LEADMALE:I think we should write a few checks.
LEADMALE:Sit down, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:As you wish, Father.
SUPMALE:I'll have to tell them we'll take the decorations down as soon as we can.
SUPMALE:Can't we leave some of them up? I don't know, maybe we can reach a compromise.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, in keeping with the spirit of the season I think we can discuss this rationally.
SUPMALE:Property values in this neighborhood must be vigorously protected.
LEADMALE:Isn't that right, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Uesato? I'm afraid potential buyers aren't too crazy about the Kmart look.
OTHERFEMALE:You know dear, there are wonderful services that will come and decorate your house for you.
LEADMALE:But this year our daughter and nephew decided to do the decorating themselves.
LEADFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:Are they very angry with you over something? No, why? This reminds me of the summer my daughter Amanda turned 15 and tried to burn our house down.
OTHERMALE:Master William.
SUPFEMALE:There is a gentleman in the foyer who claims you had some harsh words with him on the phone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? That chump is here? Send him in.
LEADFEMALE:Fighting doesn't solve anything.
SUPMALE:Aunt Viv, ain't gonna be no fight.
LEADFEMALE:I can tell by the sound of this guy's voice on the phone, I could take him in a minute.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Evander Holyfield.
LEADFEMALE:The undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World.
OTHERMALE:Nice champion.
LEADMALE:I recognize your voice.
SUPMALE:You're the chump I talked to on the telephone.
SUPFEMALE:Phone? I ain't talked to you on no phone.
OTHERMALE:Evander.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary.
OTHERMALE:You know her? Where were you last night at Bruce Willis' party? I'm not speaking to Bruce.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you about it later.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here?
OTHERMALE:I didn't know you lived here.
OTHERFEMALE:Frankly, I saw the lights and I thought they were a little tacky.
LEADFEMALE:Look! I didn't mean for everybody to get so upset.
SUPMALE:You might as well just take all the lights down.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:It's okay, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Now, come on.
LEADFEMALE:The house looks dope.
OTHERMALE:Who cares what they think? Bet you Santa thinks it's nice.
SUPFEMALE:I know you're trying to get me into the Christmas spirit but I'm just not into it.
LEADFEMALE:All those people are in a bad mood none of my friends are around to play with.
LEADMALE:I'm going to go up to my room learn some new word and wait until New Year's.
LEADMALE:That was great.
OTHERMALE:Who are you guys?
SUPMALE:Hi, I'm Mark Driscoll.
SUPMALE:How you doing? Every year, I take the neighborhood kids around to look at the Christmas lights.
SUPMALE:They choose one house as the best-decorated then sing carols for the people who live there.
SUPFEMALE:This year, you guys won.
LEADFEMALE:We drove all over.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and usually this neighborhood is a complete dud.
SUPFEMALE:We weren't even going to come here until Jimmy saw the house from the freeway.
LEADFEMALE:I tell you what, we've got cookies and hot chocolate inside.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:All right, let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Merry Christmas.
LEADMALE:Merry Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, I seem to remember you saying you wanted some friends and there they are.
SUPMALE:Still don't believe that there's a Santa Claus? I'm glad we cleared up this little matter.
LEADMALE:I assume the lights will be down by tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:I've changed my mind.
SUPMALE:I want the lights to stay up.
LEADFEMALE:Fight the power, Ashley.
SUPMALE:I love them.
SUPFEMALE:They're beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not the only one who thinks so.
OTHERMALE:Will thinks so, too, and so do all these kids.
OTHERFEMALE:And besides, it's Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:When I look at the lights and the reindeer and the decorations it makes me feel very ebullient.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley's right.
SUPMALE:What are we arguing about here? When we were kids, we used to all love Christmas.
LEADMALE:And now we take things too seriously.
LEADMALE:Personally, I think the lights are kind of neat.
LEADMALE:I guess they're really not hurting anybody.
SUPMALE:And the kids really like them.
SUPMALE:We shouldn't be fighting.
OTHERFEMALE:It's so barbaric.
LEADFEMALE:Then we're all agreed? I think those decorations are totally inappropriate for a home in Bel-Air.
LEADMALE:Madam, another of your neighbors has arrived.
LEADFEMALE:Great, that's all we need.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, everybody.
LEADMALE:Hi, there, Hilary.
LEADMALE:Thanks for the pretzels.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry to bother you, neighbor.
LEADFEMALE:I just want to say that I greatly admire your wonderful Christmas decorations and I just wanted to say that because Nancy won't let me do anything fun to our house.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:President.
OTHERMALE:It's a pleasure.
LEADMALE:A few of our neighbors came to tell us about our lights, too.
LEADMALE:What were you saying, Mr.
LEADMALE:Grey? I was just saying they were absolutely magnificent, Mr.
SUPMALE:President.
SUPMALE:That's what I think.
SUPFEMALE:This is what Christmas is all about.
SUPMALE:Now comes the magic moment.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody gather around the TV.
SUPMALE:Will, what are you doing? This is one of our Christmas traditions.
OTHERMALE:I like to watch out for this certain commercial.
LEADMALE:A commercial? You know the one where it's all snowy and the little jolly Santa is riding on a Norelco shaver? I love that commercial.
LEADFEMALE:And that Christmas beer commercial with the horses with the furry feet are pulling the sleigh through the snow.
SUPFEMALE:I loved that commercial where the little covered wagon is being chased by the dog across the kitchen floor.
LEADMALE:He's on the shaver! 
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Helium.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Lithium.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Sodium.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Zinc.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, please.
LEADMALE:Do you mind turning the music back on? I'm trying to study.
LEADMALE:I'm expecting a very important client.
LEADMALE:We have a golfing date and I'd appreciate it if you could study somewhere else.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, I get it.
LEADMALE:You're trying to impress him.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:You might want to change them pants.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Aunt Viv.
SUPMALE:What time is Jameson getting here?
OTHERMALE:What are you wearing, Vivian? Excuse me? That red blouse.
LEADFEMALE:That's Jameson's bad-luck color.
LEADFEMALE:This happens to be my favorite blouse so he can just go find himself another bad-luck color.
OTHERMALE:Maybe he can pick one out of Uncle Phil's pants.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian, please change.
OTHERMALE:I know he's a little superstitious but his big account helps to pay our little bills.
LEADFEMALE:All set for a great game of golf, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, what is it, recess at the clown convention? That's right.
LEADFEMALE:And by the way, Will, who cut your hair, Ray Charles? I've been saving that one for a week.
LEADMALE:Don't even try to top it.
SUPMALE:That must be Jameson.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, humor him.
LEADMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Jameson Whitworth.
SUPMALE:Jameson, how are you? Fine.
OTHERMALE:Vivian, it's lovely to see you again.
SUPFEMALE:And it's nice seeing you, Jameson.
LEADMALE:How are you, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Whitworth?
LEADMALE:Not great.
LEADMALE:My caddy called me on the car phone a few minutes ago and canceled.
LEADFEMALE:I've learned my 
LEADMALE:Never trust a Leo.
SUPFEMALE:Ain't that the truth? Back in Philly I knew this guy named Leo Brentley.
SUPMALE:The dude tried to steal my lucky drawers.
LEADFEMALE:You have a pair of lucky drawers?
LEADMALE:Well, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:So do I.
LEADFEMALE:This is all very interesting.
SUPMALE:Carlton, you can caddy for both of us.
SUPMALE:Shall we go, gentlemen? Wait a second.
SUPFEMALE:I have a very good feeling about this.
SUPFEMALE:How would you like to be my caddy? I ain't down with carrying golf clubs.
LEADFEMALE:It's $50, plus tip.
LEADFEMALE:Fore! This is the worst round of golf I've ever played.
SUPMALE:Well, the green's a little wet today.
SUPFEMALE:That's what's wrong.
SUPMALE:What? A hole in one! I made a hole in one.
LEADMALE:The first time in my life.
LEADMALE:Some shot, Mr.
LEADMALE:Whitworth.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations, Jameson.
LEADMALE:Did you see that, Will? It's because your hat's turned to the side, you can see better.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:There's more to it than that.
LEADMALE:There is? Jameson, let me buy lunch.
LEADFEMALE:A hole in one calls for a celebration.
LEADFEMALE:I'll say.
SUPMALE:I have to make it quick.
SUPFEMALE:I have to get back to the office.
LEADMALE:I'm making a major investment in Thorton Pharmaceuticals.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'll get lucky again, Will.
LEADFEMALE:That's wack.
LEADFEMALE:"Wack.
SUPMALE:" In what sense of the word? It's Saturday afternoon.
OTHERFEMALE:All you're thinking about is work.
SUPFEMALE:That's got to be hurting you with the girlies.
LEADFEMALE:Will, please.
LEADFEMALE:Forget about the office, forget about that stock.
LEADFEMALE:Just max and relax.
SUPMALE:Kick back and enjoy yourself.
LEADMALE:Go home and let your wife know she's still got it.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:Doggone it, you're right.
LEADMALE:Doggone it, I'm right.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, I really think I made an impression on Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Whitworth.
SUPMALE:And was your sucking up as successful as you'd hoped? I'll say.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna apply for a summer job with his company.
OTHERMALE:But, Carlton, Dad's his lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that kind of using a connection? I can't believe it, Vivian.
LEADMALE:Jameson made a hole in one, and he's not a very good golfer.
OTHERMALE:What's his handicap, sir?
SUPFEMALE:Ain't it obvious? Everybody, the working girl is home.
LEADFEMALE:How was your day?
SUPMALE:I love working in an art gallery.
SUPMALE:I'm learning so much.
LEADMALE:I just told my boss, "Teach me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a blank slate.
LEADFEMALE:" At least you're honest.
SUPFEMALE:What exactly do you do in this job?
OTHERFEMALE:This is a very exclusive art gallery.
LEADFEMALE:So, they're trying to maintain a certain atmosphere.
OTHERMALE:So, when customers come in the door, I ignore them.
LEADFEMALE:If they ask me about a piece of art, I look right through them.
LEADMALE:If they ask for a price, I go like this And walk away.
LEADMALE:Hilary, it sounds like they hired you to be a snob.
LEADMALE:I guess they saw something in me.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Whitworth.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Jameson, this is a surprise.
LEADMALE:Actually, Philip, I'm not here to see you.
OTHERFEMALE:I told you I impressed him, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:I'm here to see Will.
SUPMALE:No, sir, my name is Carlton.
OTHERMALE:I know that.
SUPMALE:I'd like to see Will.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get him.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, I brought this for you.
SUPMALE:What is it?
SUPFEMALE:It's a sprig of wolfsbane.
LEADFEMALE:Hang it over your kitchen door and all will be well.
LEADMALE:But Jameson, everything's fine in our kitchen.
SUPMALE:That you know of.
SUPFEMALE:What's up, J? I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:You saved me a lot of money.
OTHERFEMALE:Word? On the golf course, you told me not to buy Thorton Pharmaceuticals.
LEADFEMALE:The stock dropped 10 points today.
LEADMALE:Jameson, I think you're reading a little too much into this.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know nothing about stocks.
OTHERFEMALE:It was just luck.
LEADFEMALE:Precisely.
LEADMALE:You're a good-luck charm.
SUPMALE:I would've lost millions, but thanks to my "Yo, homey" here I didn't.
OTHERMALE:So what you're saying is thanks to me, you got lucky twice yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:Three times.
LEADFEMALE:The wife girlie will be smiling for months.
LEADFEMALE:You have a bright future, young man.
LEADFEMALE:This is no fair.
LEADMALE:There are many forces at work in the universe, Will.
LEADFEMALE:For example, the power in numbers.
LEADFEMALE:The four arms of the Mutable Cross, Virgo.
SUPMALE:When the moon is in the seventh house.
SUPFEMALE:The sixth-ray energies, Saturn to Neptune the seventh sun, born for good luck all numbers.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Jameson, why don't I fix you a drink? I don't drink.
LEADFEMALE:I like to keep my mind clear.
LEADFEMALE:I think he's cleared it out pretty well.
LEADMALE:My lucky numbers have always been three and seven.
LEADMALE:Will, when's your birthday?
LEADMALE:July 3.
LEADMALE:What year?
LEADMALE:1973.
SUPMALE:So you were born on 7-3-73 my lucky numbers.
LEADMALE:Jameson, that's just a coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:Coincidence? I don't think so.
SUPMALE:I was born August 4, 1974.
LEADFEMALE:A Leo? Will, I have an assignment for you.
OTHERMALE:I want you to go through these files.
SUPFEMALE:They're about a company called Innermark.
SUPMALE:I've been analyzing the data for months trying to decide whether or not I should buy it.
LEADMALE:You want me to read all this? That's not necessary.
OTHERFEMALE:Just feel the pages.
SUPMALE:Tell me what kind of energy you get back.
OTHERFEMALE:Jameson, I have to say this all sounds a little Insane? unorthodox.
SUPMALE:You have an excellent brokerage firm to advise you.
LEADMALE:J, straight up, I don't know nothing about this stuff.
SUPMALE:Will, you don't know that you know but believe me, you know.
LEADMALE:Man, I don't know.
SUPMALE:Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:We'll talk tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, Vivian, have a nice day.
SUPFEMALE:Why is that man running loose on the streets without medication? He's a little eccentric, Vivian, but he has a brilliant financial mind.
LEADMALE:He does? Philip, why don't you tell Will about Sparky? I don't think we need to go into that.
LEADMALE:Last year Jameson was taking all of his stock advice from his dog.
SUPFEMALE:That's untrue, Vivian.
SUPMALE:He only took tax advice from Sparky.
LEADFEMALE:Then, last spring Sparky met with an untimely run-in with a milk truck but of course, that didn't stop Jameson from talking to him.
SUPMALE:He talks to the spirit of a dead dog? No.
LEADFEMALE:He had him stuffed and put in his office.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, why do you humor this guy? The planet he's on ain't even been discovered yet.
LEADFEMALE:He's an important client and he's just entrusted you with a very serious financial decision.
LEADMALE:This has got to be handled delicately.
LEADMALE:What am I supposed to do? Tomorrow, you to go down to Whitworth's Capital Investments find Jameson Whitworth and tell him that you're a 17-year-old kid and you're in no position to give financial advice.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:That's Sparky's job.
SUPMALE:Your main man is in effect, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Whitworth.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Gladys.
LEADMALE:Will, come in.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on, J? You know, I just wanted to come so Is something wrong, Will? No.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm a little pressed for time, so let's just get right to the point.
SUPMALE:Excellent.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Will, Innermark Industries.
LEADMALE:Do we buy this stock or not? Look, that's what I came to talk to you about.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think I'm in any position to give you financial advice.
LEADFEMALE:I'm only 17.
LEADMALE:Did you say 17? This is a sign.
LEADFEMALE:Will, look at this.
LEADFEMALE:This machine gives me stock quotes.
SUPFEMALE:What price has Innermark been trading at all day? Seventeen.
LEADFEMALE:You've done it again, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I'm calling my broker.
LEADMALE:Wait, I really don't think you should Miles? Buy me one million shares of Innermark Industries.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Done.
SUPFEMALE:You bought a million shares of stock because I told you I was 17? That's right.
LEADMALE:This is just one big coincidence.
SUPMALE:Besides, I'm about to turn 18.
OTHERMALE:Did you say 18?
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Yes, you did.
LEADMALE:Look at this, Will.
LEADMALE:The stock just went up to $18.
LEADMALE:You just made me $1 million.
LEADFEMALE:That doesn't mean anything, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Whitworth.
SUPMALE:I can understand you being frightened by your powers.
SUPFEMALE:But there are forces at work in the universe beyond our understanding.
LEADFEMALE:Don't fight them, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Learn to accept them and there will always be a place for you here.
SUPMALE:You know, Will's been gone for hours.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder how his meeting with Mr.
LEADMALE:Whitworth is going.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing to worry about, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Traffic from Mars is very heavy this time of day.
LEADFEMALE:I'm home.
LEADMALE:Carlton, get the camera.
LEADMALE:I want a picture of me opening my first paycheck.
SUPFEMALE:Congratulations, baby.
SUPMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so excited.
LEADMALE:Mom, Dad, I'll start paying my own way around here and I won't accept no for an answer.
LEADMALE:You still owe me $5 for those magazines you bought.
SUPMALE:Ashley, don't be petty.
LEADMALE:All set.
LEADMALE:Here goes.
OTHERMALE:Don't you all feel like a part of history? What? Federal taxes? This is an outrage.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't President Bush say, "No new taxes"? But federal taxes aren't new.
LEADFEMALE:They are to me.
SUPFEMALE:And who is this FICA guy? Hilary, taxes are taken out of everybody's salary.
OTHERMALE:They pay for highways, national defense, and housing programs.
LEADFEMALE:I thought the government was supposed to pay for all that.
LEADMALE:Okay, I know the solution.
SUPMALE:I'm going to demand a raise.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, you've only been there a week.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody starts at the top.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Lunch on the company yacht? Yeah, that sounds great, Jameson.
OTHERMALE:Let's say you have the limo pick me up noon-ish.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Peace back at you, babe.
SUPMALE:Will, I want you to return all that stuff before the cops get here.
LEADFEMALE:What are you tripping? J gave me this stuff as a little thank-you gift.
LEADFEMALE:For what?
LEADFEMALE:I made him $1 million.
SUPFEMALE:That may seem like a lot, Will, but wait till they take out all the taxes.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, how did you make Jameson $1 million? To be honest, I have no idea.
SUPMALE:Jameson seems to think I'm good luck.
LEADMALE:Will, there's no such thing as good luck or bad luck.
LEADMALE:Yes, there is.
LEADFEMALE:I've got bad luck.
SUPFEMALE:You look handsome, Will.
LEADMALE:Nice suit.
SUPMALE:You like it, Ash? Custom-made.
LEADMALE:Size 42, extra fly.
LEADMALE:When you work for Whitworth, you get all the fringe benefits.
SUPFEMALE:Does he need a butler? Just asking.
LEADMALE:For a friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, you don't really think you're capable of giving financial advice, do you? Aunt Viv there are forces at work in this universe that are beyond our understanding.
LEADMALE:And if these forces want to give me a limo a cellular phone, and an Armani suit who are we to argue with them? Will, I sent you there to get out of this arrangement with Jameson and now you're in deeper than before.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I just feel terrible.
OTHERMALE:Am I showing enough cuff?
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing?
SUPMALE:I'm gonna put an end to this.
LEADMALE:Yes, Philip Banks for Jameson Whitworth.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I've been talking to Will here.
LEADMALE:First of all, I'd like to say he's very flattered but it's a little risky having a high-school student give financial advice.
SUPMALE:As your lawyer, I'd advise you put an end to it.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, you want to talk to him yourself? Okay.
LEADMALE:Yo, J.
OTHERMALE:What up, coolie-bop? Really? Really? Yeah, if that's the way you want it, that's cool.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Peace.
SUPMALE:What did he say? Uncle Phil, you're fired.
LEADMALE:So, is Mr.
LEADMALE:Whitworth ready to see us yet? He's still in there talking to his homey.
LEADMALE:You'll just have to chill.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:We can't afford to lose Whitworth's account.
LEADMALE:We need a game plan.
LEADMALE:I thought we had agreed on groveling.
LEADMALE:Yes, but we need to straighten out the order in which we grovel.
SUPMALE:I'll go first.
LEADMALE:Since my father founded the law firm, I can make an emotional plea.
OTHERFEMALE:Philip, you can remind him of all our dedicated service to his company.
LEADMALE:What do I say?
LEADFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:You're only here because his lucky number is three.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
SUPFEMALE:J, come on, man, you've got to meet with them.
SUPMALE:They're sitting right outside.
LEADMALE:Straight up, pop.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, but the aura is wack.
OTHERMALE:What did you say, Sparky? He's talking? He hasn't talked in weeks.
LEADMALE:You think it's a good idea to have the meeting? Word? What's that? Go ahead with the meeting? Send them in right away.
LEADMALE:There you have it.
LEADMALE:Sparky says have the meeting.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all right.
SUPMALE:It's two against one.
LEADMALE:Gladys, send them in, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Jameson, good to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Have a seat.
SUPMALE:Will, excuse us, please.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:He stays.
LEADMALE:I want him here.
SUPMALE:Sparky wants him here.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Jameson, Furth, Wind & Meyer has represented you for the past 20 years.
LEADFEMALE:And I think I speak for all the lawyers in the firm when I say that we're dedicated to continuing in that capacity.
OTHERMALE:So? Lawyers are a dime a dozen.
LEADFEMALE:There's some truth in that.
LEADMALE:You had an interesting point you wanted to make, didn't you? Yes, Henry.
LEADMALE:Jameson, to elaborate on what Henry was saying, it Yes? What? This is terrible.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter?
LEADFEMALE:That was my broker.
LEADMALE:Innermark stock is plummeting.
LEADFEMALE:It's already down 10 points.
LEADFEMALE:My God, it's already down to $6 a share.
LEADFEMALE:It's down to $5, $4, $3 Great.
LEADMALE:That's your lucky number.
SUPMALE:I just lost a fortune.
LEADMALE:Will, you owe me $14 million.
LEADMALE:Here's $5.
OTHERMALE:This is serious.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you know anything? No.
LEADMALE:How many times do I have to tell you? Why did you tell me to buy that stock? You're out of your mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm out of my mind? You're the one that's got Lassie as your vice president.
SUPMALE:You're not lucky.
LEADMALE:You're unlucky.
SUPFEMALE:You're a curse.
SUPMALE:Get out of my office.
LEADMALE:Don't you talk to him like that.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? It's your fault he's involved in this.
SUPFEMALE:This isn't the first time that your craziness has got us in hot water.
OTHERMALE:Last January, on my birthday when I could have been home with my wife and family, where was I? Stuck in the office buried under paperwork because Sparky chased a Buick and you thought that was his way of telling you to take over General Motors.
LEADFEMALE:Jameson, I am through with your craziness.
OTHERMALE:If that means we lose a $20 million account, then so be it.
LEADFEMALE:Jameson, I think that's Philip's way of saying "I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:"
SUPMALE:Why didn't you ever say this before?
SUPMALE:I should have.
SUPMALE:Absolutely.
LEADMALE:I had no idea your birthday was in January.
LEADFEMALE:You're a Capricorn.
LEADFEMALE:My horoscope says a Capricorn will lead me to prosperity.
SUPMALE:Philip, you're just the goat I've been looking for.
LEADFEMALE:Gentlemen, welcome back.
OTHERMALE:The way you stood up for me, Uncle Phil, you were all that.
LEADMALE:I didn't like the way he was treating you.
LEADFEMALE:So what happened next? Uncle Phil told him he could take his big account fold it five ways and stick it where Sparky can't find it.
LEADMALE:Wow, Dad, that took guts.
SUPMALE:Well done, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I've always wished I had the nerve to tell off my employers.
LEADMALE:Daddy, you've been a wonderful example for me.
LEADMALE:How much abuse can one person take for the sake of a job? There are lots of things about my boss that bug me.
SUPMALE:And I've been putting up with him for a whole week.
LEADFEMALE:It's time to take action.
LEADMALE:Hilary, I don't want you to go screaming at your boss.
SUPMALE:Can you? Philip, I am really proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Life is too short to put up with the Jameson Whitworths of the world.
SUPMALE:Straight up, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:I can't believe that loon changed his mind because you told him you were a Capricorn.
LEADFEMALE:Capricorn? Philip, your birthday's January 30.
SUPMALE:You're an Aquarius.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian, for a $20 million account, I'm a Capricorn.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Hey, Kellogg, how was your weekend? Complete disaster, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I took this girl to see New Kids on the Block and all night she's saying, "Donnie's so cute.
SUPMALE:"Donnie's so sweet, Donnie's so hunky.
LEADMALE:" What does Donnie have that I don't have? My guess is you don't have the right stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, men, it's History time.
LEADFEMALE:Smith, you're late.
LEADMALE:Sorry about that, Coach, but I thought I'd run a few laps before class.
LEADFEMALE:Help out the old basketball team.
OTHERMALE:Good idea, Smith.
LEADFEMALE:Good way to stay ahead of the competition.
OTHERFEMALE:Might not be a bad idea for all you men who are on the team to start the day with a few laps.
LEADFEMALE:We run enough laps at basketball practice, Coach Smiley.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Hunt, we're not in the gym.
LEADMALE:Therefore, you are to refer to me by my official teaching 
LEADMALE:Professor Smiley.
LEADMALE:And for that little slip of the tongue, All right, men.
LEADFEMALE:Before we start the next chapter in our History books I'm going to give back the pop quiz from Friday.
SUPMALE:I want you all to take these home and bring them back signed by your parents.
LEADFEMALE:I think I aced this one.
LEADFEMALE:How about you, Will? I think I did just fine.
SUPMALE:and the way that you write your "A" shows you're intelligent and playful.
LEADFEMALE:You can tell all that from just my signature?
LEADMALE:Yup.
SUPFEMALE:That's amazing.
LEADMALE:Do me, do me! Sign right there, under Ashley.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:So what do you see about me? Well, the bold vertical strokes show that you're impulsive.
SUPMALE:The large capital letters show that you're committed.
SUPMALE:And the little smiley face you use to dot your "l" shows that you got way too much time on your hands.
LEADMALE:That's all true.
LEADMALE:Who does it say I'm going to marry? "Handsome movie star, who will only be happy "if you spend obscene amounts of money.
LEADMALE:" You're good.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy, Will knows how to analyze people's handwriting.
LEADMALE:He's quite good, sir.
SUPMALE:One look at my signature and he deduced that I was valiant ingenious, and have the strength of 10.
LEADMALE:Let me do yours, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:No, I don't believe in that nonsense.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd hardly call it nonsense.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, Daddy, it's fun.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Where do I sign? No, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:You deserve a fresh piece of paper.
LEADFEMALE:How about you, Aunt Viv?
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? Will, this is always such a sad moment.
LEADMALE:What is? Getting you and Mom to sign his "Hall of Shame" History exam.
OTHERFEMALE:History exam? Sorry, Will.
LEADMALE:Mom, Dad, if it's any consolation, I got an "A" on the test and I must say I found it very easy.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, Ashley, we'd like to talk to Will alone.
LEADMALE:Will, what is going on here? You do so well in English and Math.
LEADFEMALE:How could you do so poorly in History? It's not my fault.
LEADFEMALE:That class is boring.
LEADMALE:Don't give us that, Will.
OTHERMALE:No, what I meant was they don't teach the whole story.
LEADFEMALE:We don't learn nothing about the Black people in American history.
LEADFEMALE:If they taught that, maybe I'd be more interested and work harder.
LEADMALE:That's not a bad idea.
SUPMALE:It's not?
SUPMALE:It's not? It's not? Carlton, stop eavesdropping! Sorry, Mom.
OTHERMALE:This does not excuse your bad grade but you've made a good point about the curriculum.
OTHERMALE:So we all agree here? None of this is any of my fault? This has been a very productive meeting.
LEADMALE:Stay put.
SUPFEMALE:You brought up a valid point here but if you want to learn Black history, what are you gonna do about it? Don't just complain, baby, take action! Write a statement about why more Black history should be added to the curriculum.
SUPFEMALE:Present it at next week's parent-teachers' meeting.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go with you.
SUPFEMALE:You will?
LEADFEMALE:You will? You will? The administration will consider the petition suggesting that we change the school motto to "Bel-Air 
OTHERFEMALE:Love lt "Or Go To Public School.
LEADFEMALE:" Any other new business? Headmaster Armstrong, I have some.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Smith.
LEADFEMALE:This should certainly be fly.
SUPFEMALE:I think the students at this school are being cheated out of a valuable learning experience.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about Coach Smiley's History class.
LEADMALE:That's Professor Smiley, Smith.
LEADFEMALE:That will be 10 laps.
LEADFEMALE:What's your concern, Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith? We learn about George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and them other dudes that wound up on money but what about Martin Luther King and Crispus Attucks and all the other Black people that made a difference in this country? It's like when there wasn't no pictures of any brothers on the wall.
LEADMALE:You know Spike Lee's movie, Do the Right Thing? I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:The last movie I saw was Dead Poets Society.
SUPFEMALE:With the right headmaster that would have been a completely different story.
LEADFEMALE:Coach Smiley, would you care to respond to Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Smith? All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to make three points.
LEADFEMALE:First, in my course, we are trying to condense 200 and some odd years of history into nine months of lessons.
LEADMALE:Obviously, we have to concentrate on some historical figures and exclude others.
OTHERFEMALE:That's true.
OTHERFEMALE:Second, our school has a fine library, or so I've been told where any student can study more about Black history.
LEADMALE:Another good point.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:For years I have taught my course from this well-respected textbook and quite frankly, I don't know a lick more than what's in this book.
LEADMALE:So forget it.
SUPFEMALE:But I think it's important.
LEADMALE:And it is.
LEADMALE:Unfortunately, the school rulebook clearly states that any requests pertaining to curriculum changes be accompanied by A petition signed by 150 student signatures.
OTHERMALE:Article 4, Section 9.
LEADMALE:Where'd you get ahold of that book? It certainly will take some time to revise the curriculum.
LEADMALE:What about having somebody come in to replace Coach Smiley for a month to teach some Black history? A month off? Armstrong, I think the kid's got something here.
LEADMALE:Be that as it may, I'm sure it will be some while before we can find a teacher.
LEADFEMALE:So, unless there's any other new business, this meeting is I hate to say this, Mr.
LEADMALE:Armstrong, but it sounds to me like you're stalling.
SUPFEMALE:Not at all, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Banks we want to make sure that the person we get is properly qualified.
LEADMALE:For example, a college professor with a Ph.
LEADMALE:D who's taught Black History and Literature at the university level?
LEADMALE:Where would we find someone like that?
SUPMALE:You're looking at her.
SUPMALE:See you in a month.
SUPFEMALE:All right, now that we're studying something I know I'm gonna be the star of this class.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not.
LEADMALE:I am.
LEADFEMALE:What, are you tripping? How do you figure that? Because the teacher's my mommy.
LEADMALE:Good morning, class.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, I'd like to welcome you, and say, on behalf of the entire class how happy we are to have you here.
SUPMALE:What did you call me, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks? What I always call 
LEADFEMALE:"Mom.
SUPFEMALE:" My name is not "Mom.
SUPFEMALE:" My name is Professor Banks.
LEADFEMALE:That is how I prefer to be addressed.
LEADFEMALE:It that clear, class? Yes, Professor Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Black American history, gentlemen from Africa, to slavery, to the present.
LEADMALE:We've all heard of Frederick Douglass Martin Luther King and Booker T.
LEADMALE:Washington.
SUPFEMALE:But Black history includes a lot of people whose names and faces aren't remembered today.
LEADMALE:How many of you have heard the spirituals sung by the slaves? I have.
OTHERFEMALE:Now listen to 
LEADFEMALE:That was pretty cool.
LEADMALE:What do you suppose the purpose of that song was? Let me handle this one.
LEADMALE:For those of you unfamiliar with the spirituals allow me to explain.
SUPMALE:The slaves used to sing them to keep their spirits up and their minds on God in the face of all the oppression that they suffered.
SUPMALE:That was very well put, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Smith, but you're wrong.
LEADMALE:I beg your pardon? That song was written to be used as a secret code of the Underground Railroad.
LEADMALE:Secret code? What do you mean? Can anyone tell me what the Underground Railroad was? Now, this one I know.
SUPFEMALE:The Underground Railroad was a group of people that led the slaves to freedom.
SUPFEMALE:When was it established? During slavery.
LEADMALE:That covers about 250 years, Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith.
SUPMALE:Care to narrow it down a bit? What do you mean, right now? Sit down, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Smith.
LEADMALE:It was established during the 1840s.
LEADMALE:Harriet Tubman, an ex-slave, was one of the leaders.
LEADMALE:These gospel songs were actually secret messages sent to tell the runaway slaves how to get to freedom.
SUPMALE:For example, "the drinking gourd" referred to the Big Dipper.
LEADMALE:When the slaves sang Follow the Drinking Gourd that signaled to the runaway slaves to run towards the Big Dipper.
LEADFEMALE:Along the route, they would meet with the abolitionist and escape to freedom.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I meant.
SUPFEMALE:Could you teach us one of the songs, Professor? Here's one called Wade in the Water.
LEADFEMALE:This song told runaway slaves that the best escape route was along the river.
SUPMALE:Late at night, these songs could be heard coming from slave cabins along the route guiding the runaways to freedom.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody, join in now.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, now.
SUPMALE:Now, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Not bad, guys.
LEADMALE:Next week's assignment will be a report on the Port Royal Experiment and the Penn School written by Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith.
OTHERMALE:Who, me? This course was your idea.
LEADFEMALE:I think it only fitting you be given the honor of the first assignment.
LEADMALE:Congratulations, Will.
SUPFEMALE:What an honor.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith will write the first half of the report the second half will be written by Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks.
LEADMALE:Who, me? I expect it to be at least 15 pages typed, double-spaced, with footnotes and a bibliography.
LEADMALE:This course was a brilliant idea.
LEADFEMALE:She's your mom! I can't believe Mom picked us to do that special assignment.
LEADFEMALE:Word.
SUPMALE:Coach Smiley never would have did that.
LEADMALE:He used to say, "Extra work for you "means extra work for me.
SUPMALE:" Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Dibs on the tall one.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, miss.
LEADMALE:Maybe you can help me out here.
OTHERMALE:I've lost the feeling in my lips.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Carlton Banks.
LEADMALE:That's right, the Carlton Banks.
LEADMALE:Want to slide out of here, get something to eat?
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Will, Carlton, I've been looking for you.
LEADFEMALE:I think class went pretty well today, don't you? Yes.
OTHERMALE:Got to go.
LEADFEMALE:Just a second.
LEADFEMALE:I've got something for you.
LEADFEMALE:This book will help you with your research paper.
LEADFEMALE:It's about the Penn School.
SUPFEMALE:Charlotte Forten was one of its first Black teachers and she Will!
SUPFEMALE:Are you listening to me?
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:You were talking about the Penn School.
OTHERMALE:What did I say about the Penn School? It's right around the corner from the Pencil School? Thanks, Mom.
LEADMALE:Carlton, how many times do I have to tell you tuck in your shirt! Look at you.
LEADMALE:Honestly, Will those eyebrows! Hurry up.
LEADMALE:We're going to the library.
LEADMALE:The tall one really liked me.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, I'm going on my first job interview at an art gallery and I need some advice.
OTHERFEMALE:You've been on a lot of job interviews, haven't you? Why, yes, Miss Hilary.
OTHERFEMALE:I've worked my entire life.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Why? Because I've always been partial to food and shelter.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, I've been trying to prepare for this interview but every time I think about it, I get really nervous.
SUPFEMALE:What do they ask you at these things? It's nothing to be nervous about.
LEADMALE:Just a few simple questions.
LEADMALE:For example, what is your name?
LEADMALE:Hilary S.
SUPMALE:Banks.
SUPMALE:Education? Two years of college.
SUPFEMALE:What are your qualifications to work in an art gallery? Well, I'm like An art gallery, to me, is like You know, it's like, okay.
LEADMALE:When I walk into an art gallery, it's like Okay, if I had to choose, all right It's like, I mean Leave me alone! You're hired.
LEADMALE:Is Aunt Viv here?
SUPFEMALE:Yes, she's in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Shall l No! She can't know we're here.
LEADMALE:She hasn't let us watch TV in a week.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting withdrawal symptoms.
LEADFEMALE:My body needs a certain amount of microwaves.
LEADMALE:Hi, guys.
SUPMALE:How's that history class coming?
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Decent, I guess.
LEADMALE:How are you doing with your term papers and your reading assignments and your economic graphs of the cotton industry? Dad, if you don't mind, we'd rather not talk about History class.
LEADMALE:Okay, suit yourself.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, please.
LEADMALE:If memory serves, this Black history class was your idea.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know Aunt Viv was gonna teach it.
LEADFEMALE:She's driving us crazy.
LEADFEMALE:Last night, I had a dream that I went to the prom with Harriet Tubman.
LEADMALE:Will, I saw this coming.
SUPMALE:You thought you'd get a free ride in that class, didn't you?
SUPFEMALE:No, I didn't.
SUPMALE:I sure did.
SUPMALE:I don't have any sympathy for either one of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Just because she's good at teaching the class and making you do some hard work
LEADMALE:you can't take it.
OTHERMALE:Look, that's not it.
SUPFEMALE:For her own good, you have to warn her if she keeps being so tough, the whole class is gonna revolt.
LEADFEMALE:I can see it in the kids' faces.
LEADMALE:They're on the edge.
LEADMALE:Umoja.
SUPFEMALE:What? Umoja.
OTHERMALE:It's Swahili for "unity.
SUPMALE:" Dope, huh? I got the whole Berlitz course on cassette for my oral report today.
LEADFEMALE:Did you take my Jet magazine? No, I've got my own subscription.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, class.
LEADFEMALE:Who would like to make the first oral presentation? Jonathan, you did your presentation yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:But I've done a whole new presentation, just for fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Before we make our presentations we have something to say to you.
SUPMALE:A bunch of us were at Chadney's house making our extra-credit dioramas and we started talking.
OTHERFEMALE:We agreed it's a shame you're going to leave at the end of the month.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, terrible.
LEADMALE:That's a wack situation.
LEADMALE:A shame.
LEADMALE:So, anyway, we came up with this.
LEADMALE:It's a petition for you to become our permanent history teacher.
SUPFEMALE:Shoot me.
LEADMALE:Guys I'm overwhelmed.
SUPMALE:This is very flattering.
LEADFEMALE:According to the rulebook, we need 150 signatures.
LEADFEMALE:So far we've collected 148.
LEADMALE:It'd be fun if the two signatures to put it over were Will and Carlton.
LEADMALE:Guys, do the honors.
LEADMALE:After you, Will.
LEADFEMALE:No, you go ahead first.
LEADMALE:I insist.
SUPFEMALE:She's your mom.
SUPMALE:This class was your idea.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, listen, guys.
SUPMALE:I'm very touched that you want me to stay but I don't think the university would approve.
LEADFEMALE:But I don't see
SUPMALE:Let's get back to work.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Fletcher, would you care to give your report, please?
SUPMALE:Hi there, Aunt Viv.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing? Just grading papers.
LEADMALE:The class coming over later? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Maybe you can tell us more about Harriet Tubman.
OTHERMALE:I never get enough of her.
SUPMALE:I think you did get enough.
LEADMALE:You thought one month was enough.
SUPMALE:Mom, I'm sorry if I wasn't as enthusiastic as the rest of the guys.
LEADFEMALE:You're a great teacher.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just I hope you don't take this the wrong way but you made our lives a living nightmare.
SUPFEMALE:How did I do that? You ragged me in front of the whole class.
LEADFEMALE:You gave us all that extra work and made us do those reports.
LEADMALE:I didn't hear any complaints from the rest of the class.
OTHERMALE:That's because you were harder on the two us.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry you felt I was being hard on you but I thought the two Black students would actually want to get the most out of the course.
SUPFEMALE:I guess we didn't think about it that way.
OTHERMALE:Mom.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:This whole ugly episode it's not going to affect my grade, will it? I'm a very tough grader, Carlton.
LEADMALE:And you're very beautiful, Mommy.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, there's one thing I've been wondering.
OTHERFEMALE:What's that? Why did you want a course in Black history in the first place?
LEADFEMALE:I'm interested in it.
LEADFEMALE:Are you really? Of course.
LEADMALE:You didn't seem happy about all the work I was giving you.
LEADFEMALE:Weren't you the one who said if you were interested in something, you would study hard? Aunt Viv, I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X three times.
LEADFEMALE:That makes you a serious student on Black history? That's a very important book.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you can read that book you can wear the T-shirts, put up the posters, and shout the slogans but unless you know all the history behind it you're trivializing the entire struggle.
LEADMALE:Now you started something very good here but it's up to you to follow through on it.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you, Ashley, it's the perfect thing for Granny's visit.
SUPFEMALE:Look, we enter here, we go past the llamas and giraffes take a look at the monkey house and then end with a ride on the Ferris wheel.
SUPMALE:For the last time we are not breaking into Michael Jackson's house.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, what's up? We're picking up Grandma from the airport.
LEADMALE:She won't want to hear that garbage when she gets here.
OTHERMALE:The reason you don't like the music is because you can't dance.
LEADMALE:Really? In your face.
OTHERMALE:So it turned out I did get an "A" in my English mid-term and the A minus was in Math.
LEADMALE:What a crazy week that was.
LEADFEMALE:That takes us up to the spring quarter.
OTHERFEMALE:That's when l Worked hard, got good grades, made the honor roll, the end.
LEADFEMALE:Granny! Oh, sugar! Will, as handsome as ever.
OTHERFEMALE:Grandma, as generous as ever.
LEADFEMALE:Did you notice how Carlton's grown? He's almost into adult sizes.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations, dear.
LEADFEMALE:I've been looking through the guidebooks I found an attraction with your name written all over it.
SUPMALE:What's that, honey?
LEADFEMALE:Raging Waters.
SUPMALE:Are you insane?
LEADMALE:It's a little late to be asking.
LEADFEMALE:She's here to rest and recuperate.
OTHERFEMALE:She's just gotten over the flu.
LEADFEMALE:I told you it was a cold.
SUPFEMALE:What did the doctor say? Us country folks don't run to the doctor at every sneeze, sniffle, or broken bone.
LEADMALE:We are not the spendthrifts you are, Zeke.
SUPMALE:Zeke.
SUPFEMALE:That one always kills me.
SUPMALE:Granny, I love when you come to visit.
LEADMALE:Did you bring the picture of him and the goat? Never leave home without it.
LEADMALE:Yes, sir, I'll be getting a frame for this one.
SUPFEMALE:Hattie.
SUPFEMALE:Hello! Honey, you are younger and prettier every time I see you.
SUPMALE:Will you look at you two?
LEADMALE:You could enter a beauty contest.
SUPMALE:Grandma.
SUPMALE:Really? I never gave it much thought.
SUPFEMALE:Just think, for the talent portion, you could twirl a checkbook.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, are we gonna do some more crafts while you're here? We sure are.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey! Yes, madam? Ashley and I are going to be doing some art.
LEADMALE:We're going to need 50 Popsicle sticks two bags of macaroni wheels, and lots and lots of glitter.
LEADFEMALE:I'm way ahead of you.
SUPMALE:In anticipation of your visit I have saved two dozen egg cartons.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey, but we won't be making purses this time.
LEADFEMALE:Speaking of art, I thought we could go to the museum.
SUPMALE:They have a display on 100-year-old quilts.
LEADFEMALE:I got one of them in the back of my truck.
LEADMALE:I know what'd be perfect for 
LEADMALE:A complete day of beauty where the salon does your hair, makeup, nails, and you come out looking fabulous.
SUPMALE:I don't think your grandmother would be interested.
OTHERFEMALE:Then can I do it? I know we all have plans for Grandma, but let her relax a little bit first.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetie, I feel fine.
LEADMALE:Maybe so, Mama, but while you're here I want you to take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:You are not to lift a finger.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna treat you like a queen.
SUPFEMALE:You said the magic words.
SUPMALE:Granny, what you doing? Nothing much, I'm afraid.
LEADFEMALE:Your uncle gave me this book of find-the-word puzzles.
LEADFEMALE:So I found all the words.
LEADFEMALE:Now what do I do with them? You shouldn't just be sitting here.
LEADFEMALE:You should do something you like doing, like I don't know baking me a sweet potato pie.
OTHERMALE:Baby, much as I'd like to, I think your uncle wants me to stay put.
LEADMALE:Now that's your first mistake.
OTHERMALE:He tells me all kinds of stuff to do and I never listen to him.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm a better person for it.
OTHERMALE:How come you're just sitting around? Don't you have any plans? No, not really.
LEADMALE:You got to have a girl.
OTHERMALE:No kidding.
SUPFEMALE:There's no one that gets your sap rising? There's this girl named Tanya, I met her at the mall.
LEADMALE:She works in a fancy men's store where even the underwear comes from Europe.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know if she'd go out with anybody in local drawers.
LEADMALE:Sets to mind a heifer we once had.
LEADMALE:You ain't seen Tanya.
LEADFEMALE:You listen up.
SUPFEMALE:Petunia had two bulls liking her.
LEADMALE:One a big strong Angus with a chest as wide as a Chevy.
LEADMALE:That one's me, right? The other was a slim, handsome Jersey.
OTHERMALE:A real lady's bull.
LEADFEMALE:Word to Granny.
OTHERFEMALE:That one's me, right? All season long, Petunia just couldn't decide.
LEADMALE:So come fall, she ups and picks the Angus.
LEADMALE:See? No.
SUPFEMALE:By then, breeding season was over.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe if you changed it to cats or something.
OTHERMALE:Everybody be quiet.
SUPMALE:Grandma's probably sleeping.
SUPFEMALE:She's going to love my gift.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't know Leonard Nimoy even sang.
LEADMALE:That was very thoughtful, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I smell something funny.
LEADFEMALE:It smells like pine or something.
SUPFEMALE:I smell it, too.
LEADMALE:I thinks it's coming from the kitchen.
SUPMALE:What is that smell? Watch your step.
LEADMALE:The floor is wet.
LEADMALE:Mother, what are you doing? I'm picking apples from a cherry tree.
LEADFEMALE:What does it look like I'm doing? I'm giving your floor a good hand scrubbing.
SUPFEMALE:That's Geoffrey's job.
LEADMALE:No, it ain't.
LEADFEMALE:I have begun the mulch pile, madam.
OTHERMALE:Fine Geoffrey, I'll be out to look at it directly, right after I flip the mattresses.
SUPFEMALE:Hold on, Mama.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey Sorry, sir, but she threatened me with a whupping.
LEADFEMALE:It seems like you're back to your old self.
LEADFEMALE:I have an idea for this afternoon.
OTHERMALE:I know how proud you are of your azaleas.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we go to the botanical gardens and see how theirs stack up?
SUPMALE:I'll get my sweater.
LEADMALE:Why? Mama, you cold? Geoffrey, turn up the heat.
SUPFEMALE:Sir, I already set the thermostat on 80 as you requested.
LEADFEMALE:The candles are starting to melt.
LEADMALE:I just wanted my sweater because we are going to the gardens.
SUPMALE:We can go to the garden later this week.
LEADMALE:I want you to get settled in.
SUPMALE:I am more settled than a big old box of raisin bran.
SUPMALE:Mama, don't excite yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Is there anything I can get for you?
OTHERFEMALE:How about a magazine?
LEADFEMALE:Or a game.
LEADMALE:Or some moisturizer.
SUPMALE:I have an idea.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we all take a dip in the pool? Sounds good.
LEADFEMALE:That way we can all get out and let Mama take a nap.
SUPFEMALE:I want to swim, too.
SUPMALE:You shouldn't swim when getting over the flu.
LEADMALE:We'll see you after your nap.
SUPFEMALE:Nap! Why don't they put me in a playpen? Yo, DJ Granny.
LEADMALE:What's going on?
SUPMALE:Nothing.
OTHERMALE:And your uncle aims to keep it that way.
LEADFEMALE:I know he means well but a body has to feel useful.
LEADMALE:Useful? You know that girlie advice you gave me? It worked like a charm.
SUPMALE:Really? I don't remember it exactly but I just walked up to her and 
LEADMALE:"Hey Tanya, bulls and cows need to get together before it starts snowing.
LEADMALE:" And she understood that? No, but she liked my hair.
LEADFEMALE:We're going out on her first night off.
SUPFEMALE:That's fine.
LEADMALE:But I don't have a date for the concert tonight.
SUPMALE:Who's playing?
SUPMALE:Heavy D.
LEADMALE:I love him.
SUPMALE:You do? Who doesn't like Charlie Daniels? This is another Heavy D, Granny.
SUPMALE:Maybe if I play this tape for you.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.
SUPFEMALE:Not bad.
SUPMALE:Can't understand what he's saying but it does have a beat to it.
LEADMALE:What kind of dance you do to this? Trust me on this one.
OTHERMALE:It's very complicated.
SUPMALE:It takes a lot of hard study and dedication to learn.
LEADMALE:Honey, I ain't got that kind of time.
LEADFEMALE:You're getting there, you're getting there! This kind of dancing works up quite an appetite.
LEADFEMALE:What say I make us some flapjacks? Granny, will you marry me? Sweet talker! This is the good part.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll turn up the Victrola.
LEADMALE:Yeah! Go, granny! Go, granny! What's going on in here? Mama, are you all right? Of course I am.
SUPFEMALE:Take your hands off of me.
LEADFEMALE:Will, why were you playing that music? Grandma's supposed to be resting.
SUPFEMALE:You're grounded.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get so worked up.
LEADFEMALE:I was just having fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Mama, a woman your age should not be dancing around.
LEADMALE:Boy, don't you tell me what to do.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I was just trying to look out for you.
SUPFEMALE:Will, no more horsing around.
SUPFEMALE:"Will, no more horsing around.
LEADMALE:" That boy is about as much fun as day-old oatmeal.
SUPMALE:I noticed that.
LEADFEMALE:Granny, since we're both grounded want to go upstairs, slam our bedroom doors, and throw things? A woman my age shouldn't be dancing.
LEADMALE:We'll see about that.
LEADFEMALE:Spoiling my fun.
LEADFEMALE:Yours? I can't believe I'm not going to that concert.
SUPFEMALE:You are going to that concert.
OTHERFEMALE:I am?
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:With me.
OTHERFEMALE:But Uncle Phil won't let us.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil won't see us.
LEADMALE:Sneaking out? You? Honey, you are looking at a woman who has snuck out to more barn dances hayrides, and midnight skinny-dips than a chicken has pecks.
SUPFEMALE:Yo well Hiiii haaaaa! Looks like you've got plans for the evening.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Got me a couple of extra pillows.
OTHERFEMALE:I like to turn in early at my age.
LEADMALE:Would you like some hot chocolate?
LEADMALE:Lord, no! Don't need the stimulation.
OTHERMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, honey.
SUPMALE:That was close.
LEADFEMALE:But I was cool.
LEADMALE:Good work 0070.
LEADMALE:Now here's the plan.
SUPMALE:The concert starts at 8:00.
LEADFEMALE:My friend Jazz will meet us at the corner at 7:00.
LEADFEMALE:He'll flash his lights twice, then drive us to the Bel-Air border.
LEADMALE:There, we'll meet with a guy known only as the Captain.
SUPFEMALE:He'll drive us the rest of the way.
SUPMALE:No questions asked.
LEADMALE:What's the code words? Here's $10.
LEADFEMALE:Got you.
LEADMALE:You're going to be ready to go? No problem.
LEADMALE:Good, you'll blend in.
LEADMALE:I brought these pillows to put them in our beds so they think we're sleeping.
LEADFEMALE:Granny, granny, granny Nice try, but today it's all done electronically.
OTHERMALE:Check it.
OTHERFEMALE:That's lovely dear What do you mean your grandmother wasn't in her room?? Well, i went to tell her goodnight, but there were just clothes underneath her covers.
SUPFEMALE:Where on earth would she get an idea like that? Will! How could he still be sleeping? Look at this.
LEADMALE:I can't believe how low Will will stoop to deceive you.
LEADMALE:With this tape, who knows how many times he could sneak out of the house for a whole night completely unnoticed.
OTHERMALE:You think Will and Grandma are all right?
LEADMALE:I'm sure they are.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'm going to bed.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Where would they be at this hour? The Heavy D concert.
LEADMALE:I accidentally overheard Will on the phone when I was trying to clean my receiver.
LEADMALE:Will probably dragged my mother with him.
SUPMALE:I'm going down there.
LEADMALE:I'm going with you.
LEADFEMALE:It's a rap concert.
LEADMALE:You want to be with someone who knows how to be hip.
LEADMALE:$10 for a T-shirt.
LEADMALE:That boy must be crazy.
SUPMALE:I still ain't sure how you managed to get it for $1.
OTHERMALE:25 and a picture of Grandpa.
LEADMALE:I've been thinking.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should call home.
SUPFEMALE:I know how it is.
LEADFEMALE:I've been a parent.
LEADMALE:I've been a kid, and the answer is bad choice, Joyce.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry to bother you.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss Fitzgerald? I'm a big fan of yours.
SUPMALE:I was wondering if i can I have your picture taken with me? Come on, she's not Ever too busy for a fan.
LEADMALE:They had backstage passes.
SUPMALE:It shouldn't be too hard to find them.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's hurry up.
OTHERFEMALE:This is weird.
LEADMALE:Can you believe how these kids dress? It's beginning to get to me.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me a moment.
OTHERMALE:I just Could I see your backstage pass, please? I don't have one.
LEADMALE:I'm here looking for my mother.
SUPFEMALE:And your sister knows a member of the band, right? You groupies are all alike.
LEADFEMALE:I am not a groupie.
LEADMALE:Call it what you like, but take it from me, Heavy D doesn't want to hear you rap.
OTHERFEMALE:Where do you think you're going? Pardon me.
LEADMALE:Have you seen a kid in wild, colorful clothing with an earring in his ear and the sides of his head shaved? Nope.
LEADFEMALE:You better get to your seat, the concert's about to start.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not here to see some stupid concert.
SUPFEMALE:Never mind.
SUPMALE:I'll find him myself.
LEADFEMALE:He couldn't have gotten too far.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody, put your hands together for Heavy D! Boo! When the crowd saw he wasn't Heavy D, they was upset.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, you had the shortest rap career in history.
LEADFEMALE:But I do feel bad.
OTHERMALE:All the trouble we caused you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well! You all should've seen Granny.
LEADMALE:She was great.
OTHERMALE:She climbed down from the second story window then she ran to Jazz's car then helped push it up the hill when it stalled.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, I think you're right.
LEADMALE:I don't think Hattie's up to seeing those azaleas tomorrow.
SUPMALE:Why, I sure am, and after that Hilary and I are going to get those facials.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, you haven't lived until you've had a mud mask.
SUPMALE:What people don't pay for in Beverly Hills.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:And then, Ashley, baby you and I are going to make us some macaroni rain hats.
SUPFEMALE:Great!
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Grandma.
LEADMALE:Good night, precious.
LEADFEMALE:After all that activity, you're going to need a rest.
LEADMALE:That's when you can tell me more about your schoolwork, dear.
LEADMALE:Excellent!
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Grandma.
LEADMALE:Good night, baby.
LEADMALE:You know, Granny, you were a great date tonight.
LEADFEMALE:You showed me a great time.
LEADFEMALE:And to thank you tomorrow I'm going to bake you a sweet potato pie.
LEADMALE:Granny, I don't think you should be waking up all early.
LEADMALE:Let's get started on it now.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I think it's time for bed.
OTHERMALE:Good night, Granny.
SUPMALE:Good night, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Mama.
SUPMALE:Good night, darling.
LEADMALE:Don't go giving me that look, Zeke.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you're not all that mad with me, are you? Well Mama, yes, I am.
OTHERMALE:I try to set some rules down for Will and you undermined my authority.
OTHERMALE:I know how to handle things.
LEADMALE:I am an adult.
LEADFEMALE:I am, too, Zeke.
LEADFEMALE:I know that.
OTHERMALE:Do you? How many adults do you tell to take a nap? Mama, I was just worried about you.
OTHERFEMALE:But I'm fine, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:When you had the flu and I talked to you on the phone you sounded so small.
OTHERFEMALE:I just want you to live a long time.
SUPFEMALE:Then, Zeke let me live.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz
LEADMALE:What up, J?
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Prince, I need a favor.
OTHERFEMALE:Anything, man.
LEADFEMALE:How many times you helped me out? Seven.
SUPFEMALE:What do you need?
SUPMALE:A date.
OTHERMALE:Say no more!
LEADFEMALE:I want you to date my sister.
LEADFEMALE:Say a lot more.
LEADFEMALE:She just moved out here.
LEADMALE:She hasn't had a date yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Prince, she really needs a man.
SUPMALE:But does she look good? Sure she does.
LEADMALE:Good looks run in my family.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you know I'd do anything for you.
LEADMALE:You're like a brother to me.
LEADMALE:Check.
LEADMALE:Which means that your sister should be like a sister to me, not a girlfriend.
SUPMALE:If it doesn't work out, it could jeopardize our friendship.
LEADMALE:I'm willing to take that risk.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, my brother, I have to give this some serious thought.
SUPMALE:Can I bring her by just to meet you?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that's chill.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight, 8:00 sharp.
LEADMALE:And try to smell good.
OTHERMALE:Yo, big boy.
LEADFEMALE:Give your sweet mama some sugar.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I did my budget just like you told me.
OTHERMALE:Good for you.
SUPFEMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:This is the amount I made last week.
SUPFEMALE:These were my expenses.
LEADMALE:I spent five times more than I made.
LEADFEMALE:This budget thing is pretty easy.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, G! Chill, man! Whatever you do, don't open that door.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, Lord, tell me it isn't the police.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:It's my boy, Jazz.
SUPMALE:Much worse.
LEADMALE:Hey, G.
LEADMALE:$10 says I ain't home.
SUPMALE:It doesn't quite say it loudly enough.
OTHERFEMALE:Do I hear $15?
SUPFEMALE:G, you gonna do a brother like that?
SUPMALE:My life's at stake.
SUPMALE:I took that into consideration.
SUPMALE:Why don't you want to see Jazz?
LEADMALE:It's his sister I don't want to see.
LEADMALE:Jazz is trying to set me up.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz has a sister? Nice to meet you, Dad.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Jazz and Miss Janet.
LEADFEMALE:Prince, here she is.
SUPFEMALE:Janet, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Will, Janet.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have a goatee.
SUPMALE:Excuse me? Hi, I'm Vivian Banks, Will's aunt.
LEADFEMALE:And this is my husband Philip and our daughters Hilary and Ashley.
OTHERFEMALE:It's nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:Hey, meet me again.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we all take a seat? May I get you anything, Master William? A dribble bib? How long have you been in town? I just moved here.
LEADMALE:I got a scholarship to go to UCLA.
LEADMALE:We certainly know who got the brains in your family.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but Janet ain't stupid.
LEADMALE:So, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Banks, Jazz tells me you're a college professor.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:I teach English.
LEADFEMALE:And Mr.
SUPMALE:Banks, Jazz tells me you're a professional wrestler.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid he was mistaken.
SUPMALE:I'm a lawyer.
SUPFEMALE:My apologies.
OTHERMALE:I was misquoted.
SUPFEMALE:I went to UCLA.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want to use my books? Thanks.
LEADMALE:I was thinking of buying used books.
OTHERMALE:Well, these aren't used.
LEADMALE:Come take a look at them anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, I'm going to go into the kitchen for a snack.
LEADFEMALE:When I come back, I want you gone.
LEADMALE:Guess I got plenty of time then.
LEADMALE:Will, I think Janet likes you.
LEADMALE:I definitely think she's up on me.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, it's probably not too late to get that spinach out of your teeth.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you think? Brother, do the words "boing-yoing-yoing" mean anything to you? I can't wait to go out with your sister.
LEADMALE:Thanks for putting me "D," man.
SUPMALE:Man, I'm having second thoughts.
LEADMALE:See, Prince, you're like a brother to me.
LEADMALE:If you date my sister and it doesn't work out it could jeopardize our friendship.
LEADFEMALE:I'm willing to take that risk.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, how much are you willing to give? Give? You know, to take her out.
SUPFEMALE:I'd sure look good in this jacket.
LEADMALE:I should have known.
LEADMALE:The hat, too.
SUPMALE:The hat.
SUPMALE:Let me get a good look at this shirt.
OTHERFEMALE:I must say Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz's sister is quite a charmer.
LEADMALE:Yes, she is.
SUPFEMALE:Makes me question the whole theory of genetics.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Philip, it was awfully nice of Jazz to introduce Will to his sister.
OTHERMALE:He's a good friend.
LEADMALE:My brothers and sisters, I've got a date.
LEADMALE:You know what would be fun?
LEADMALE:I can think of a couple of things.
LEADMALE:It would be fun to take your cousin Ashley out sometime.
SUPFEMALE:I love kids.
LEADMALE:Yeah, word.
LEADMALE:Kids are great.
SUPMALE:Do you want kids of your own?
LEADFEMALE:Definitely.
LEADMALE:You'd be a great dad.
SUPMALE:You, too, baby.
SUPFEMALE:I probably shouldn't tell you this but the moment I saw you I knew we'd be great together.
LEADFEMALE:I hope it wasn't the leather jacket that did it.
LEADMALE:Don't be silly.
LEADMALE:You're not wearing the jacket now, are you? And I never will be again.
OTHERFEMALE:Clothes don't make the man.
LEADMALE:And, Will, you are my man.
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should look at the menu.
LEADMALE:If I can get my eyes to focus.
LEADFEMALE:I am getting a little hungry.
LEADMALE:Baby, have the lobster, have the caviar.
LEADMALE:Anything you want.
SUPMALE:I know I don't want lobster and caviar, they're much too expensive.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:We are going to be great together.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm Gia.
SUPMALE:Hi, I'm Will.
LEADFEMALE:You ready to order?
LEADFEMALE:We certainly are.
LEADMALE:Not.
SUPMALE:Then I'll come back.
OTHERMALE:William, can we get one thing straight? When you are with me, I don't want you to be looking at other women.
SUPMALE:What other women?
OTHERMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:I saw you looking at that waitress.
SUPFEMALE:So you can just put those googly eyes back in your head, all right? Hello? I said, all right? All right.
LEADMALE:Gia? I'd like the swordfish and a salad.
LEADFEMALE:No dressing.
LEADMALE:What about you, Will? I'll have the
OTHERFEMALE:I'll have the steak.
OTHERFEMALE:Rare.
LEADFEMALE:Steak is really unhealthy.
SUPFEMALE:Do you need another minute?
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:He'll have the same thing I'm having.
LEADFEMALE:Plus a baked potato.
OTHERFEMALE:No butter, no sour cream.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Got it.
OTHERMALE:I like sour cream.
LEADFEMALE:You used to.
LEADMALE:From now on, you need to watch that cholesterol.
LEADMALE:I'm not having my husband dying of a heart attack at 40 and leaving me to raise six kids by myself.
LEADMALE:Six kids? That's right, baby.
LEADMALE:Three girls, three boys.
LEADFEMALE:And don't even think about naming one of them William.
SUPFEMALE:Janet, hold on.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think it's a little early to be talking about marriage? Excuse me? Then what did you have in mind? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Dinner, maybe a dance or two.
LEADMALE:Is that right? A moment ago, you were chewing on my earlobe, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Niblet.
LEADFEMALE:Did you think you could sample the milk without putting a down payment on the cow? I ordered lemonade.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna drink it.
SUPMALE:You're cutting out sugar, too.
LEADFEMALE:No husband of mine will sit around getting fat and watching TV all day and leaving me with all the work of raising six kids by myself.
OTHERMALE:No.
LEADMALE:But
LEADMALE:But, nothing.
LEADMALE:And look at me when I'm talking to you! William, who are you looking at? Don't you feel great? Brisk walk in the morning and now you're exercised and ready to start the day.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:We got any more of those pecan rolls? Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, I need your help.
LEADMALE:I'm having girl problems.
OTHERMALE:Didn't your date go well last night?
OTHERMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:What's the matter, baby? You like Janet more than she likes you? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Well, I sure liked her.
LEADMALE:I hope so, since we'll probably be living here with our six kids.
LEADFEMALE:Kids?
SUPMALE:She told me last night we're having six.
LEADMALE:Not anytime soon, I hope.
LEADMALE:She doesn't want to start a family until we've finished graduate school worked at least five years and have complete dental benefits.
LEADFEMALE:That sounds very sensible.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Viv, this is all before we had salads.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you tell her you're not interested? I tried, man.
LEADFEMALE:She just won't listen.
LEADFEMALE:It's like Fatal Attraction.
OTHERMALE:I'm telling you, if we had a bunny, dude would be on the stove right now.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Will.
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you, this babe is tripping.
LEADFEMALE:She's already telling me what to do, what to eat, where to look.
SUPMALE:Well, women get like that.
LEADMALE:Get like what?
LEADFEMALE:You know.
SUPFEMALE:No, Philip, I do not.
LEADMALE:Women get like what? Like that.
LEADFEMALE:You say something, William? Master William, Mr.
SUPMALE:Jazz is here to see you.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, G.
LEADMALE:What do women get like? I am waiting.
SUPFEMALE:Hello! Prince, is your uncle here? I think I dislocated my hip last night dancing.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to risk getting thrown out.
LEADMALE:Yo, man, what's up? Come on, man, that tickles.
SUPMALE:I want my clothes back, Jazz.
LEADMALE:You set me up with a maniac.
SUPFEMALE:Your sister's the bossiest woman in the world.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:You know? She gets on my last nerves.
LEADMALE:Ever since she moved out here she's been hanging out at my place, bossing me around all the time.
OTHERFEMALE:I had to pawn her off on some sucker.
LEADMALE:Between you and the Humpty Dance, I'll get a metal plate put in my butt.
LEADMALE:You deserve it.
OTHERMALE:Your sister showed up here at 7:00 to pick out my clothes.
LEADFEMALE:By 10:00, she phoned five times.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm telling you, she'd be here now if she wasn't out shopping for my beeper.
LEADMALE:Are you saying your relationship isn't working out? What relationship? I just met her.
SUPMALE:If you're thinking about breaking up with her, you better think again.
OTHERFEMALE:Last guy that tried to cut her loose it wasn't pretty.
LEADMALE:Dude, he's walking and all, but still.
LEADFEMALE:What am I supposed to do?
LEADFEMALE:I say, marry her.
LEADMALE:You can stop that.
LEADFEMALE:Homes, I'm breaking up with her.
LEADMALE:Well, if she kills you, can I have that shirt?
LEADFEMALE:No, you can't have this shirt, Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:I got an idea.
OTHERMALE:I set you two up to get her out of my face, right? So why don't you set her up with some other sucker? I ain't living like that.
LEADFEMALE:What guy deserves a woman like your sister? Hi, fellas! Hope you don't mind, I borrowed your Public Enemy tape.
SUPMALE:You like Public Enemy?
LEADFEMALE:To tell you the truth, they're not half bad.
OTHERMALE:That used to be my favorite song.
LEADMALE:You know, Carlton, I misjudged you.
SUPMALE:You're a lot cooler than I thought.
LEADFEMALE:You want to go to the club with us tonight? Sure, but I don't have a date.
SUPMALE:Carlton, never bring a sandwich to a buffet.
LEADMALE:And what is boyfriend having? The green-grass salad with blue-cheese dressing.
LEADFEMALE:Nix the blue cheese.
LEADMALE:Got it.
SUPFEMALE:Janet! Kiss, kiss.
LEADMALE:Janet, meet Toni.
OTHERMALE:Toni, Janet.
LEADMALE:Oh, Janet.
LEADFEMALE:I have a sister named Jane, but we call her Amy.
OTHERFEMALE:You know Carlton and Will.
SUPMALE:And a little further down on the evolutionary chart, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:She noticed me.
LEADMALE:Would you ladies care to join us? Maybe later.
LEADFEMALE:We have to see if anyone better is here first.
LEADMALE:Isn't that Patrick Swayze?
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:You tell us, Carlton.
LEADMALE:You see, Janet, not only is Carlton brilliant and handsome he also knows everybody who's anybody.
OTHERFEMALE:Ain't that right, Jazz?
OTHERMALE:Does he know Janet Jackson? William, ever since we got here you've been going on and on about Carlton this and Carlton that.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, save your charm for the girl on your arm.
SUPFEMALE:Someone has her rude hat on tonight.
LEADMALE:William, my soda is warm.
SUPMALE:Yo, Gia.
LEADMALE:I need more ice.
SUPFEMALE:You need more ice, what? I need more ice in my warm soda.
LEADFEMALE:You need more ice, please.
SUPMALE:What did you say to me?
LEADFEMALE:He said, "You need more ice, please.
SUPFEMALE:" Heads up.
LEADMALE:Will, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I've got to say something.
LEADFEMALE:Janet, your behavior this evening has been completely unacceptable.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Where I come from, manners count for a lot.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry I've got to say this but I simply can't sit back and allow this rudeness to continue.
OTHERFEMALE:You owe every one of us an apology, especially that poor waitress.
SUPFEMALE:If you refuse, we're taking you home and continuing the evening without you.
SUPFEMALE:Do I make myself clear? You know, I'm going to miss him.
SUPFEMALE:Do I make myself clear? Yes, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton was a little bit of that.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know he had it in him.
LEADMALE:He stood right up to Janet and 
LEADFEMALE:"Baby, that's about all that lip I'm going to have.
SUPMALE:" Boys, you've got a lot to learn about women.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton has obviously been watching me in action.
LEADMALE:Now, Will, your Aunt Vivian can be quite bossy at times.
LEADFEMALE:But when she starts bossing me around, I don't let it bother me.
SUPMALE:I just say no in a strong, masculine voice.
SUPFEMALE:And when I say no, she jumps.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:What did you say? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:How long have you been there? I came in on, "Your Aunt Vivian can be quite bossy sometimes.
OTHERMALE:" You didn't hear the part where I 
SUPFEMALE:"Boys, the rest of this statement is completely untrue.
LEADMALE:" Philip, you better sleep with one eye open.
LEADMALE:I got her just where I want her.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I've learned something from all this, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:You know what every woman wants?
LEADFEMALE:Rib tips? No, Jazz.
LEADMALE:Every woman wants a man to take control.
SUPMALE:That's what Carlton did with Janet.
LEADMALE:If he can make it work for him, imagine what I could do.
LEADFEMALE:You did an excellent job on those apology notes.
SUPFEMALE:I'll mail them right away.
LEADMALE:Mail them?
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I'll hand-deliver them.
SUPFEMALE:That's better.
OTHERMALE:I'll get your coat.
SUPMALE:I really should write a book.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Jazz, I know how to check a woman.
LEADMALE:Watch this.
LEADMALE:Yo, Janet! Peep this here, baby.
LEADFEMALE:We're going out tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna choose the place.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna eyeball any honey that I darn well please, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Then I'm gonna order a steak with a big bucket of blue-cheese dressing.
SUPFEMALE:Do I make myself clear? The only thing clear about you is the space between your ears.
LEADMALE:Why the hell didn't that work? You got the theory right.
OTHERMALE:You just ain't got the technique.
SUPMALE:Take notes.
OTHERMALE:Hilary! What? Hilary, your behavior at the club last night was completely unacceptable.
LEADMALE:Where I come from, manners count for a lot.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm sorry to have to say this, but I simply can't sit here and allow this rudeness to continue.
LEADMALE:Do I make myself clear? Jazz??? Come here 
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Shouldn't she be playing with those toy ponies with the pink hair? Carlton, it's just puppy love.
LEADMALE:Don't you remember your first crush? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:It was Tootie in The Facts of Life.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:You had a love thing for Tootie? When did you get over it? What do you mean "get over it"? I'd still love to meet her someday.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder what I'd say.
LEADFEMALE:How about, "Hello, Tootie, I'm Fruity"? Just because you've never been in love I've got the perfect idea for Ashley's birthday present.
SUPFEMALE:What's that, sweetheart?
SUPFEMALE:I know Little T's agent.
SUPFEMALE:He used to go out with my friend Jennifer.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bet he could get Ashley a front row seat at Little T's next concert.
LEADMALE:Listen, Hilary, if you know his agent you can get something twice as good as that.
LEADMALE:Two seats.
SUPMALE:Let me walk you through this one.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow is Ashley's birthday party.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley has a crush on Little T.
LEADFEMALE:Birthday party.
LEADFEMALE:Little T.
SUPMALE:Something beginning to gel here? Wouldn't it be nice if Little T came to Ashley's birthday party? That would be so cute.
SUPMALE:Will everybody please be quiet? I'm trying to think.
OTHERMALE:This party has been going on for an hour.
LEADFEMALE:When is Little T gonna get here? You know nothing about celebrities.
OTHERFEMALE:They always come to parties fashionably late.
LEADFEMALE:For a celebrity, being an hour late is like being half an hour early.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah? Well, if he's not here Hi, kids.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Tidy the Clown.
LEADFEMALE:We are going to play a new game.
OTHERMALE:It's called Clean Up After Your Spoiled Little Selves.
SUPMALE:Mom, Dad, make him stop.
SUPMALE:What's the matter, baby? Come on, a clown at a birthday party? It's so babyish.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's cool.
LEADFEMALE:I'm about to get this party started right.
SUPMALE:All right, kids, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Ashley's cousin, Will and I'm about to hip y'all to this new style of dancing.
LEADMALE:It's called dumb dancing, and no matter what you do you got to have a serious mug on the whole time.
SUPMALE:So y'all peep this here.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Now you give it a try.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, like that'll be happening.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, man, who invited the old guy? My brother, you want to take this outside? Will, will you cut it out? You are wrecking the party.
OTHERMALE:I mean, this stuff is for 
LEADFEMALE:clowns, dance contests.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, kids.
LEADMALE:Prepare to be amazed.
SUPFEMALE:It's time for the great Carltoni.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish I was never born.
LEADMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Now, that's Little T's agent.
LEADMALE:I was the only one who thought Home Alone would make money.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, that was me.
LEADFEMALE:Got to go.
LEADMALE:Lee.
OTHERMALE:Hilary.
SUPMALE:Listen, sorry I'm late, but I was just at Goldie's house and Goldie and Chevy and Mel were there.
OTHERFEMALE:It just turned into a thing and, you know As usual, I had to straighten it out.
LEADMALE:But, you know Exactly.
OTHERMALE:Well, is Little T here? Hey, would I lie to you? Happy birthday, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Are you feeling better? I can't believe I just did that.
LEADFEMALE:This is so embarrassing.
SUPMALE:It's not so bad.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I've always been planning on things to say if I got a chance to meet you.
OTHERFEMALE:Then I finally meet you, and I don't even make a sound.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know about that.
SUPMALE:You made a pretty good thud when you hit the ground.
SUPMALE:Did I really? God, I can't even faint right.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:You mean this is the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you?
OTHERFEMALE:I guess not.
LEADMALE:What was? I can't tell you.
LEADFEMALE:It's too embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you my most embarrassing moment.
OTHERMALE:I was dressing for gym class during a fire drill and I had to run out of the building in my drawers.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'll tell you mine.
LEADMALE:It was the Honor Day assembly.
LEADMALE:I was sitting with my legs crossed for the whole time.
LEADMALE:And when they called my name for the English award I stood up and started across the stage, only my leg was asleep.
OTHERFEMALE:And then, thwap! I fell flat on my face.
SUPFEMALE:Come to think of it most of my embarrassing moments involve me hitting the floor.
LEADMALE:You're really funny.
LEADFEMALE:You're really cool, too.
SUPMALE:Who, me?
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Look, I've got to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry we didn't have more time to talk.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what with you being unconscious and all.
LEADMALE:Okay, thanks for coming.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you want to go out sometime?
OTHERFEMALE:Who, me? I thought we'd go out for pizza tomorrow night.
LEADMALE:I mean, if you're free.
SUPFEMALE:I'd have to check my calendar, but I think I'm free.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, then can I come around 7:00?
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Okay, then.
LEADMALE:I guess I'll go now.
LEADFEMALE:I'll walk you to the door.
SUPFEMALE:I'm hungry.
SUPMALE:Would you like a sandwich? No, thanks, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just too excited.
LEADMALE:I can never eat before a big date.
LEADMALE:Do I look okay? Hilary, it's not even your date.
OTHERMALE:It's Ashley's date.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but still, do I look okay? Hilary, baby, calm down.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Mom, but this is the most exciting day in a girl's life.
LEADMALE:I mean, it's Ashley's first date.
SUPMALE:And it's with a celebrity.
OTHERFEMALE:It is so gratifying to see her developing the right values.
LEADMALE:Guys, don't do that.
SUPMALE:What? You know, sigh like that.
OTHERFEMALE:You make me feel like Benji.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:We're just excited, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:We'll calm down.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Could you check my hair?
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go in the living room and wait for Little T.
LEADFEMALE:Just a second.
OTHERFEMALE:Baby, I just want to get one picture.
OTHERMALE:Mom, not the camcorder.
OTHERFEMALE:But, sweetheart, this is your first date.
LEADMALE:This only happens once in your life.
LEADMALE:Thank God.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, now turn around so we can see your pretty dress.
LEADMALE:Go back out and come in again the way you did.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
SUPMALE:Hilary, you sit there drinking your coffee the way you were.
LEADFEMALE:That was great.
LEADMALE:No, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Let's do it again.
SUPFEMALE:I wasn't happy with what I did.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, go back out again.
LEADFEMALE:Guys, will you cut it out? You're driving me crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:He's a very special boy and I don't want to be so nervous that I mess things up.
LEADFEMALE:In case you don't remember, this is my first date.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, Uncle Phil, he kissed her right on her mouth.
LEADMALE:It was really more on the cheek.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but he was aiming for her mouth and he missed.
OTHERFEMALE:The kid is not only aggressive, but inaccurate and that's a dangerous combination.
OTHERMALE:You're getting all worked up over nothing.
LEADMALE:He's just a 13-year-old boy.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:This is serious.
LEADFEMALE:I know what goes on in the mind of a 13-year-old boy.
SUPFEMALE:Considering you still have the mind of a 13-year-old boy.
LEADMALE:Will's got a good point.
LEADMALE:When I was 13, I harbored some pretty impure thoughts about Tootie.
SUPMALE:Look, I wasn't thrilled about her going out in the first place.
SUPFEMALE:She's only 12.
LEADMALE:But she had her heart set on it.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, the kid's agent is chaperoning.
LEADFEMALE:So what could possibly happen? That's them.
LEADFEMALE:This discussion is at an end.
LEADMALE:Master T and Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Lee Cohen.
LEADMALE:Hey, you're English.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I represent some English bands.
LEADFEMALE:Ever heard of Duran Duran?
SUPMALE:Why, yes.
SUPFEMALE:When they came to me, they were just Duran.
OTHERMALE:I added the second Duran, and bang-o! You must be so proud.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks.
OTHERFEMALE:I brought some flowers for Ashley.
SUPMALE:Now, that's sweet.
OTHERMALE:Isn't that sweet, Will, Carlton? Yeah, real sweet.
OTHERFEMALE:This evening should be fun.
LEADMALE:I hope it will be, son.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley's in the kitchen.
SUPMALE:Why don't you join her? Isn't that sweet? He seems really excited about his first date.
LEADMALE:First date? Dream on.
LEADMALE:First date today, maybe.
LEADMALE:Pardon me? When he's on tour, he's gotta beat the chicks away with a stick.
SUPFEMALE:Wish I had a piece of that action.
LEADFEMALE:Action.
SUPMALE:Isn't that sweet? You kids have a great time at the pizza place.
LEADMALE:We will.
SUPFEMALE:Did you hear that? "We will.
LEADFEMALE:" All right, kids.
LEADMALE:Let's party.
OTHERMALE:Okay, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:Have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:Have fun, you guys.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Follow them.
LEADFEMALE:Out.
SUPMALE:When I first read the script of Pretty Woman it was called Attractive Woman.
LEADFEMALE:I said, "Come on, guys, let's go all the way with this.
OTHERMALE:" So they changed the title, and bang-o!
LEADFEMALE:So, what's your favorite video game?
LEADFEMALE:Tetris.
LEADFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I brought my Game Boy.
SUPFEMALE:So you want to play?
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:He's got his arm around her already.
LEADMALE:That's the same arm I used when I was 13.
SUPFEMALE:It's that love arm.
LEADFEMALE:We better work fast.
SUPMALE:Let's roll.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Ashley, Little T, what's going on? What are you two doing here? Uncle Phil got hungry, so he sent us to pick up a dozen pizzas.
SUPMALE:Ashley, can I speak to you for a minute?
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want?
LEADFEMALE:Don't get upset, but it's your hair.
SUPFEMALE:It's doing a weird kind of bird's nest thing.
OTHERMALE:You might wanna get a hairbrush and fix it.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be straight with you.
SUPMALE:You're going out with my little cousin.
SUPMALE:You better not try nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Don't give me that innocent role.
LEADMALE:I know what you people in the music business are like.
LEADMALE:Makes me sick.
SUPMALE:Sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps this will refresh your memory.
LEADMALE:From the current issue of Right On! magazine.
LEADMALE:There's a picture of you at the recent Soul Train Awards.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you'd be kind enough to tell us who this bimbo is on your arm.
LEADMALE:That's my mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You covered yourself on that one but what about this girlie action you been getting on tour? Your agent told me all about it.
LEADMALE:Did you believe my agent? Man, he lies about everything.
LEADMALE:He told me I could have a career in singing.
LEADMALE:Look, guys, with all the recording, touring, and my homework I haven't had any time for girls.
LEADMALE:To tell you the truth, this is my first real date.
SUPMALE:I knew that.
LEADMALE:I just brought Carlton down 'cause I had to prove it to him.
SUPMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Carlton, I looked at my hair and it was fine.
OTHERFEMALE:If you two don't mind, I'd like to continue with my date alone.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we're going.
LEADFEMALE:Check you later, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:What was that all about?
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:Don't worry about it.
LEADFEMALE:So, you want to play some more Tetris?
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really having a good time, Ashley.
OTHERFEMALE:So am I.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe you, Philip.
SUPFEMALE:Sending Will and Carlton to spy on your own daughter? What's wrong with that? She is my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:I'd do it again, damn it.
LEADMALE:Word to big bird.
OTHERFEMALE:Just say the word and we there, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:But this was such a big night for Ashley.
SUPMALE:Mom and I were so happy for her.
LEADMALE:What got into you guys? I know it was a big night for her.
SUPFEMALE:I knew it had to come sometime.
SUPFEMALE:I just didn't think it would come so soon.
LEADMALE:She's really growing up.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it's time for us to stop butting into her life so much.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not! Hi, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:How did it go?
SUPFEMALE:I'm not going to talk about it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, he did kiss me.
SUPMALE:I want to hear all the details.
LEADMALE:We'll pop some popcorn, do our nails and you can tell me every single thing that happened tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like a written copy of that report.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, sweetie when you walked in from that date with that smile on your face
LEADFEMALE:That's a moment I will always remember.
SUPMALE:That's nice, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Could you go out and do it again, and I'll go get the camcorder?
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, just asking.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night.
SUPMALE:My little princess.
SUPFEMALE:I cannot believe my little girl went out on a real date tonight.
SUPMALE:He's a really nice guy, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but there's something you should know, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm never gonna like anybody you bring home.
LEADFEMALE:That's awfully fair of you.
SUPFEMALE:It's not that they're not good.
SUPFEMALE:It's just that nobody is good enough for you.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I'm just sorry I wrecked your date.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't, Will.
LEADMALE:It was the most wonderful night of my life.
LEADFEMALE:Really? That's great.
LEADFEMALE:I think your second date will be even better 'cause when you're 21, you can appreciate these things more.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I'm going out with him again next Saturday.
LEADMALE:Next Saturday I'm busy.
OTHERMALE:You'll have to change that.
SUPMALE:I know you're busy.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I made it for then.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Will.
SUPMALE:Good night, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:You should try rapping.
SUPFEMALE:When you're rapping, you mess up the words and make up some new ones right there on the spot.
LEADFEMALE:Let's try this.
LEADMALE:I'll sing one line, you make up a line to rhyme it.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:"You didn't get into Miss Berkley's chorus"
LEADFEMALE:I'm thinking, all right?
LEADMALE:That's all right.
SUPMALE:We got all day.
LEADMALE:Okay, I've got it.
SUPFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:"You didn't get into Miss Berkley's chorus" "I'd like to hit her in the head with Roget's Thesaurus" "Don't need no choir when you're a rapper" "Gonna hunt Miss Berkley down and zap her" "Got this whole town of Bel-Air buzzing" "Get a load of me and my rapping cousin" 
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, beautiful.
SUPMALE:I love a woman with good reflexes.
SUPFEMALE:Makes me crazy.
LEADMALE:Get out.
SUPFEMALE:Your mouth is saying "get out," but your eyes are saying "get busy.
LEADFEMALE:" Daddy??? That's not going to work this time, Hil, darling.
OTHERFEMALE:Uncle Phil went to the supermarket, so he'll be gone for at least a week.
OTHERMALE:Mom??? She went with him.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey???
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Miss Hilary?
SUPMALE:You know the drill.
LEADMALE:Hilary, why is it so hard for you to be nice to Jazz? You know he likes you.
LEADMALE:I'm supposed to be nice to everyone who likes me? How much time do you think I have? So that's the reason for you to be mean to Jazz?
LEADMALE:Look, Jazz will be fine.
SUPFEMALE:You think so? Well, I don't.
SUPMALE:You don't know Jazz the way I know him.
LEADFEMALE:He's a very sensitive person.
LEADMALE:He has feelings that are very deep.
SUPFEMALE:When you had Geoffrey throw him out, I think that was the last straw.
LEADMALE:I don't think he'll ever be the same.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Want to kiss my boo-boo? I hope that you didn't take my throwing you out of the house personally, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:It was strictly business.
LEADMALE:That's cool.
LEADMALE:If you grab me in that place again, we're engaged.
LEADMALE:Look, Jazz, if you want to get with Hilary you got to have a plan.
OTHERMALE:You mean mine hasn't been working? Jazz, that's the 18th time she threw you out of the house.
LEADFEMALE:All a part of my plan.
SUPMALE:We're home.
OTHERMALE:Later.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, the groceries are in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:Yes, madam.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton has sunk to a new low.
SUPMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Carlton, what's up with the crutches?
LEADFEMALE:I'm practicing my new scam.
SUPMALE:Girls love a guy with a sports injury.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't see too many honeys being impressed 
OTHERFEMALE:"Babe, I busted myself up playing peewee football.
OTHERMALE:" Mom, Dad, I'm so glad you're home.
LEADMALE:I have exciting news about my job.
SUPFEMALE:What is it? I'm not going to just tell you.
LEADFEMALE:That's no fun.
LEADFEMALE:Guess.
LEADMALE:Did you sell a painting at the gallery?
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Did you get a promotion?
SUPMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Did you get fired?
SUPFEMALE:No, I quit.
SUPMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:I was definitely the closest.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, you were doing so well at the art gallery.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but, Mom, it's not really a cool job.
OTHERMALE:When I was a little girl, I had a dream that when I grew up, I'd have a glamorous job in a glamorous office.
LEADFEMALE:At parties, people would ask what I did and I'd tell them.
SUPMALE:I imagined them turning pea-green with envy and blurting 
SUPMALE:"You are so lucky," and walking away eaten up inside because I had a fabulous job and they didn't.
SUPFEMALE:They say Gandhi had a very similar childhood dream.
SUPFEMALE:All right, young lady, how do you propose to get this glamorous job? I already got it.
OTHERMALE:Starting tomorrow, I'm going to be the personal assistant to Marissa Redman.
LEADFEMALE:The movie star?
LEADFEMALE:Wow, she's really big.
OTHERMALE:What? She ain't do nothing good in years.
SUPFEMALE:That's not true.
LEADFEMALE:She's one of the most famous actresses in Hollywood.
LEADMALE:She won an Oscar.
SUPFEMALE:Nominated.
LEADFEMALE:And she was in one of the top 10 movies of all time.
LEADFEMALE:Eight years ago.
LEADFEMALE:And she needs a new assistant because she just got back from a well-deserved year off.
LEADFEMALE:Nose job.
OTHERMALE:How did you know all of that? I have an inquiring mind.
SUPFEMALE:Will, please.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary's obviously very excited about this job.
LEADMALE:Be a little more supportive.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Hilary, I loved her in that musical she did.
LEADMALE:God, what a voice.
LEADMALE:Lip-synch.
LEADMALE:Dinner is served.
OTHERMALE:Jazz, I thought you left.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because you walked out the door and you said, "Later.
LEADFEMALE:" All a part of my plan.
SUPFEMALE:Did you hear the news about Hilary?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm so proud of her.
LEADMALE:Okay, tomorrow's her first day at work.
SUPMALE:I think I got a little plan that will make Hilary like you.
OTHERFEMALE:Tomorrow we'll go down there and you're gonna surprise her with flowers and candy.
SUPMALE:Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Meet you here tomorrow at 9:00 sharp.
LEADFEMALE:You got it, man.
LEADFEMALE:Don't forget the candy and flowers.
SUPMALE:Miss Tony Fisher, please.
SUPMALE:Hi, Tony.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Hil.
SUPMALE:How's your job going? Guess where I'm calling from.
LEADMALE:No, guess.
LEADMALE:No, guess again.
LEADMALE:What do you mean you give up? This is fun.
LEADMALE:No, guess again.
LEADMALE:No, don't hang up, Tony.
LEADMALE:Do not hang up now.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, guess.
OTHERFEMALE:No, guess again.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'm in Marissa Redman's office.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's my first day.
SUPMALE:What's she like? Tony, I have to tell you, you'd never know she was a movie star.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, she's so grounded.
LEADMALE:She's so real.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care if you have other appointments, clown.
SUPMALE:My cat needs acupuncture.
LEADFEMALE:Marissa.
LEADMALE:Heather.
LEADMALE:Hilary.
SUPMALE:Let's get one thing straight.
LEADFEMALE:My last assistant quit on me because I never learned her name.
LEADMALE:Now, is that going to be a problem?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:I'm so excited.
LEADFEMALE:I want to learn all about the movie business.
SUPFEMALE:And you will.
LEADFEMALE:The key is to be positive.
SUPFEMALE:I like positive people.
LEADFEMALE:Are you positive?
SUPFEMALE:Yes! Yes.
OTHERMALE:Remember, this is a process.
LEADMALE:You do realize it's a process? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I'm positive it's a process.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get that.
SUPMALE:You got that right.
SUPMALE:Miss Redman's office.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid Miss Redman's on the other line now, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Haskell
LEADMALE:but I'll see if she's finishing up.
OTHERMALE:It's my agent.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Sam.
LEADMALE:This better be good news.
SUPFEMALE:So you're saying I didn't get the part? I know the part called for a Meryl Streep type.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I'm a Meryl Streep type if I want to be.
SUPFEMALE:It's called acting, Sam.
SUPFEMALE:So what fool got the part? Meryl Streep.
SUPMALE:Ain't that cozy? I'm sorry you didn't get the part, Marissa.
OTHERMALE:But let's be positive.
LEADFEMALE:After all, this is a process.
OTHERFEMALE:Shut up.
OTHERMALE:I have to go to a restaurant opening tonight.
LEADMALE:So I need you to pick up my clothes from the cleaners.
SUPMALE:I'm not speaking to my tired boyfriend, so I'll need someone to go with.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder if that cute little Johnny Gill is free.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't he, like, my age?
LEADMALE:I see.
SUPFEMALE:I get it.
SUPMALE:First, I'm too black to play Meryl Streep's parts and now I'm too old to date a 20-year-old.
LEADMALE:Cher can do it, but I can't? No, Marissa, I didn't mean anything like that.
LEADMALE:Everyone's trying to fit me into their nice, neat little box.
LEADMALE:You're walking a fine line, Helena.
LEADFEMALE:A very fine line.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, I'm calling from Marissa Redman's office.
LEADMALE:Is her dry-cleaning ready? It says here on the 
LEADFEMALE:"Three dresses, two blouses, four silk brassieres "and eight pair of underwear.
LEADFEMALE:" Fantastic.
SUPMALE:I'll be right over to pick them up.
SUPMALE:Glamour, glamour, glamour.
LEADMALE:You know, while you're down there you may even get to see Dustin Hoffman's drawers.
LEADMALE:Will, what are you doing here? Congratulations on your new job, Hilary.
LEADMALE:Flowers, a Kit Kat and a song.
OTHERFEMALE:All the way from Compton, California the king of the keyboard himself, just for you, Hilary.
LEADMALE:It's Jazz!
LEADFEMALE:He plays so beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you agree?
LEADFEMALE:What is going on here?
OTHERFEMALE:Marissa, I can explain.
LEADFEMALE:I don't even want to hear it.
SUPFEMALE:So I've got a party girl on my hands.
LEADMALE:Is that it? As soon as I turn my back.
SUPFEMALE:We've got a word for people like you in this business and it's called Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Miss Redman, we didn't mean to get Hilary in any trouble.
LEADMALE:I'm her cousin.
LEADMALE:She's not in any trouble.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:I didn't catch your name.
SUPMALE:Will Smith.
LEADMALE:Little Willie Smith.
LEADFEMALE:I like that.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but little Willie's got to go now.
LEADMALE:We'll get right out of your way.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're not in my way.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you kind of are.
LEADMALE:Why don't you stay for a little while? You know, we'd love to, but we made other plans.
LEADFEMALE:No, we didn't.
SUPMALE:Don't you remember, Jazz you've got that brain-surgery appointment.
OTHERFEMALE:Must have forgotten.
OTHERMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I just had a thought.
LEADMALE:I'm sure it's brilliant.
LEADFEMALE:What is it? I thought I'd like to take your cousin Will to that restaurant opening tonight.
SUPFEMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Are you thinking I'm too old for him? You think he wouldn't want to go out with me? No, Marissa, I mean, who wouldn't want to go out with you? You better hope he does.
LEADFEMALE:Because if he doesn't want to go out with me tonight, you're fired, Hester.
SUPMALE:I forfeit the game.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, G.
LEADMALE:He was about to take me.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Look who's home.
SUPMALE:It's Miss Hollywood.
SUPMALE:Tell me all about your faboo day.
LEADMALE:So what did you do this afternoon? Massage her feet, give her cat a perm? Will, I love your irreverent sense of humor.
LEADFEMALE:It's so refreshing.
LEADMALE:How you trying to play me, Hilary? Will, you're always thinking the worst of me.
LEADMALE:I have got some great news for you.
LEADMALE:Guess who I can get to go out with you.
SUPMALE:Janet Jackson?
LEADFEMALE:Guess again.
LEADFEMALE:Jody Watley.
SUPFEMALE:Guess again.
SUPMALE:Tell me, or I'll kill you.
OTHERFEMALE:Marissa Redman.
LEADMALE:You've got to be tripping.
SUPMALE:Hilary, I wouldn't go out with her if she and Marsha Warfield were the last two women on earth.
LEADMALE:Will, please.
LEADFEMALE:Marissa said if I can't get you to go out on a date with her, she'll fire me.
LEADMALE:Perfect.
LEADFEMALE:All she does is yell at you, boss you around and treat you like dirt.
LEADMALE:I know but I'm the envy of all my friends.
LEADMALE:Hilary, come on, don't cry.
LEADMALE:Don't cry.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:I guess it won't kill me to go out with Marissa Redman.
LEADMALE:Will, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:And I guess it won't kill you to go out with Jazz.
LEADMALE:I can't believe that you agreed to go on this date with Jazz.
OTHERMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
OTHERMALE:I had to, or I'd lose my job.
SUPFEMALE:Touchy, touchy.
LEADFEMALE:Cut it out! I can see it now.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:and Mrs.
SUPMALE:Jazz
LEADMALE:Does Jazz have a last name?
OTHERMALE:I believe it's Matazz.
LEADFEMALE:Will you three cut it out? Philip, we don't mean anything by it.
LEADMALE:I don't see the destruction of our gene pool as something to joke about.
SUPFEMALE:That must be Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Marissa's meeting us at the restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:We can't be a second late.
SUPFEMALE:Just relax, Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:Just make sure you're sweet to Jazz.
LEADMALE:This is making his whole week.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, G.
LEADMALE:As of tonight, my new official name is Mr.
OTHERMALE:Lucky.
LEADMALE:Marissa, thanks for inviting us.
LEADMALE:This is such an exciting new restaurant.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Butter on ice.
OTHERMALE:I'm living large now.
OTHERFEMALE:Speaking of ice, Jazz
LEADMALE:doesn't Hilary look a little chilly?
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:You are so beautiful, baby.
LEADMALE:Jazz, please.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I know you can be nicer than that.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:That was a wonderful imitation of a creepy spider you just did, Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Cher! Sophomore in high school.
SUPMALE:Beat that, honey.
LEADMALE:Do you know what time it is, Hilary? It's 8:15.
SUPMALE:No, it's not.
SUPFEMALE:It's "slow dancing with Jazz" time.
SUPFEMALE:No, it isn't.
LEADMALE:You know, it's either "slow dancing with Jazz" time or "Will getting up, going home, and leaving you without a job" time.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz, do you want to dance? Man, this must be my birthday.
LEADMALE:When you get back, bring me a mineral water three ice cubes, a lemon, and a lime.
LEADFEMALE:For the sake of novelty, get it right this time.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Marissa.
LEADFEMALE:So, little Willie, would you pass me the salt, please? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, I feel I should tell you something.
SUPFEMALE:I'm only on this date with you as part of my deal with Will.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:You do? It doesn't bother me but if it's making you feel sad dancing with me, you don't have to.
LEADFEMALE:No, Jazz, it's not that.
LEADMALE:Thank God.
LEADFEMALE:It's just this job is getting to me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't mind the hard work.
SUPMALE:It's just I can't seem to do anything right.
LEADFEMALE:She's always yelling at me.
OTHERMALE:Tell Jazz all about it.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:Biggest director in town.
LEADMALE:Sydney.
OTHERFEMALE:Congratulations.
OTHERFEMALE:Loved your new movie.
LEADMALE:We've got to do What? He just looked right through me.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should have spoken up a little bit.
SUPMALE:This is not good.
LEADMALE:Hickory! Yes.
LEADMALE:I just saw Sydney, and he cut me dead.
OTHERFEMALE:Did you send him a bottle of champagne like I told you for the premiere of his crappy movie? You said this morning you were thinking of sending him something but didn't know what.
LEADMALE:Champagne would obviously be the perfect choice, Einstein.
LEADMALE:Marissa, chill.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:She's trying.
LEADMALE:Look, I work so hard.
SUPMALE:I mean, I work harder than anybody, and I'm very underpaid and it does not help when the person who is supposed to be my assistant is a total idiot.
SUPMALE:You're the idiot.
SUPMALE:Well, date's over.
LEADMALE:Look, I don't care how many movies you make.
LEADMALE:Nobody don't talk like that to Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:She's smart, sweet, and the most beautiful woman in the cosmos and she's been very nice to me tonight.
LEADFEMALE:She's been nice to you, even though you didn't deserve it.
LEADMALE:So you tell her you're sorry because I'm about to get pretty mad.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up.
OTHERFEMALE:This is what you do.
LEADMALE:Run to an all-night liquor store
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? What do you think I am? I shouldn't be treated like an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not an idiot.
SUPFEMALE:I'm smart.
LEADMALE:And another thing, your last five movies really sucked big time.
OTHERMALE:Six.
LEADMALE:You can't stand here talking like that to me.
LEADMALE:You're right, because I have a prior engagement with someone from the A list.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jazz, let's go.
LEADMALE:Thank you, oh, Lord.
LEADMALE:Who needs them? They don't know how to appreciate you.
SUPMALE:I mean, I think me and you can have a better time without them.
LEADMALE:Really?
LEADMALE:Psych.
LEADFEMALE:You really said that to Marissa? At least now Marissa the cradle crook knows what Hilary thinks about her.
LEADMALE:And I owe it all to Jazz.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Jazz.
SUPMALE:Now my daughter's unemployed.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, you should thank Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:He reminded me that I do have some self-respect.
OTHERFEMALE:Why chase after celebrities? They're all so shallow and self-centered.
LEADFEMALE:From now on, I want to spend time with people who have depth intelligence, and maturity.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like the sound of this.
SUPFEMALE:Good night, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, guys.
LEADMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Night, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Guys, I'm sorry the night was so awful.
SUPMALE:Hilary, I'm just grateful I got my young body out of there before old Marissa put some miles on it.
SUPFEMALE:I got to go.
OTHERMALE:Peace.
LEADMALE:Peace, babe.
OTHERMALE:Jazz, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I mean
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:Sure, babe.
LEADFEMALE:You want to go out with me on Saturday night? I don't think it's a good time.
LEADFEMALE:I'd only say "yes" because I felt like I owed you something.
LEADFEMALE:That's cool with me.
LEADMALE:Maybe some other time.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Good night, Hilary.
LEADMALE:No, wait.
LEADFEMALE:All a part of my plan.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Are you busy, Will? No, not really.
LEADMALE:So, what's up? Well, they're kind of having cheerleader tryouts at school and I sort of thought about going.
OTHERFEMALE:But, you know, that's kind of a stupid idea, so I sort of blew it off.
SUPMALE:Oh well, I think that being a cheerleader is a kind of, you know, a sort of a good idea.
LEADMALE:Do you think I have a chance?
SUPMALE:Of course you do.
LEADMALE:Yo, back in Philly the girls had this cheer, right that, yo, really got the crowd hyped.
SUPFEMALE:They used to be like this.
LEADMALE:They used to, 
SUPFEMALE:"We beat them, we dissed them, we kicked they butt good.
LEADFEMALE:"But that was kind of stupid, y'all, we in they neighborhood! "Run!" Philip, this skirt used to look better, didn't it? This didn't used to be here.
SUPMALE:Does this look better?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Now you look just like Yul Brynner in The King and I.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:You look great and you always will.
SUPFEMALE:You are the best-looking 40-year-old woman in this hemisphere.
LEADMALE:Philip, I am not 40.
LEADFEMALE:I will not be 40 until 7:08 tonight.
LEADFEMALE:One hour later you and your feet are gonna be at the world's greatest birthday party.
SUPMALE:Oh, Philip, you've gone to so much trouble.
LEADMALE:I'm so sorry I'm such a grouch.
LEADMALE:Baby, that's okay.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody's thrilled about getting not young.
LEADMALE:But look what you've accomplished.
LEADMALE:You're a full professor, you've got three great kids and a husband who's tall, dark, and loaded.
SUPMALE:How many people can say that at your ZIP code? Man, Carlton, that's kind of a smooth tie you've got there, man.
LEADMALE:Here, let me check that joint out.
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:It's silk twill, hand sewn in Italy.
LEADFEMALE:That spider been getting on my nerves all day, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Check this out! I dotted the "l" on Armani! Will, I thought about it all weekend and I've decided to sign up for cheerleader tryouts.
LEADMALE:Are you sure, Ashley? You'll have to wear an indecently short skirt make a spectacle of yourself in front of your whole school and ride on a bus with a bunch of sweaty teenage boys.
SUPFEMALE:Gosh, I hope I get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I'm sure you will, Ash.
LEADMALE:Hey, let me see your moves.
LEADMALE:Well, okay.
SUPMALE:Two bits, four bits, six bits, a dollar! All for Hollingsworth Preparatory Institute stand up and holler! Yay, school! I take it back, Ashley.
LEADMALE:That was incredible.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Carlton.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what do you think, Will? That was, kind of dignified, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:Would you like some help?
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you!
SUPMALE:Oh, you're welcome! Well, I spent the entire day shopping for the perfect gift for us to give Mother.
LEADFEMALE:But it was worth the sacrifice, she is going to love it.
LEADFEMALE:Ta-da! No, wait.
OTHERFEMALE:That's for me.
SUPMALE:Oops! For me again.
LEADFEMALE:Here it is.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with you, girl? I gave you two weeks salary and you got a pot holder? Shh! I hear her coming.
LEADFEMALE:Happy Birthday!
LEADFEMALE:Happy Birthday! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:Here, Hilary, sweetie, these are for you.
LEADMALE:I don't think short skirts are appropriate for me anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, I've been meaning to talk to you about how you look in diamonds.
LEADFEMALE:There's Stacey Cooper, the dean's daughter.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I heard her mother had some extensive plastic surgery.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, that is her mother.
LEADMALE:What happened to the rest of her chins? Yo, they look good down there.
LEADMALE:Thank God.
LEADFEMALE:I got to the mall right as it was closing.
LEADMALE:They made a huge fuss just because I asked them to turn the escalator back on.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway our present is going to be perfect.
LEADMALE:It's a very conservative, long wool skirt.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi!
SUPFEMALE:Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, sweetie.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you? Mom, isn't that your costume from Halloween? You know, the year you came as Tina Turner? It certainly is.
SUPFEMALE:You're not going to sing Proud Mary again, are you? Well, I might.
SUPFEMALE:The night is young, baby, and so am I.
SUPFEMALE:My life is great, this party's gonna be great and I look fantastic.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mom, you do.
SUPMALE:You look great.
SUPFEMALE:I look stupid, don't I?
LEADMALE:Oh, Vivian.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, this has all been just perfect.
LEADMALE:Has? Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:The night's not over yet.
SUPMALE:Surprise!
SUPMALE:Surprise! Yo, we're here to display A look at a woman who is forty today She's smart and well-dressed, so just to give thanks This is your life, Vivian Banks! Remember 1951? Remember Chuck Berry? Remember Hula-Hoops? Me neither! Hold up, yo.
LEADMALE:Well, that was the year that Vivian Smith was born.
SUPFEMALE:Eat your heart out, LaToya.
SUPFEMALE:In just a few short years, little Vivian starred in her first dance recital.
OTHERFEMALE:Over a quarter of a century ago.
LEADMALE:The seasons came and went.
OTHERMALE:The 60s.
OTHERMALE:The Dark Ages of fashion.
OTHERFEMALE:Yet, Vivian braved the afro, the dashiki, and the platform shoe.
SUPFEMALE:She went off to college with dreams of being a dancer.
LEADMALE:Time marched on.
LEADMALE:As the days turned into years Vivian got a teaching degree, got married, and moved to California.
SUPFEMALE:The years rolled by.
OTHERFEMALE:Today, Vivian Banks has matured into a successful college professor outstanding wife and mother, and a tribute to middle age.
LEADMALE:Hold up, y'all.
LEADFEMALE:Hold up, hold up, hold up.
OTHERMALE:Now, see a lot of people make jokes about being 40, but we're not living like that here.
SUPFEMALE:'Cause 40 ain't old if you're a giant sequoia! After all, life begins at 40.
LEADFEMALE:Oops, did I say "life"? I meant gum disease.
LEADMALE:Really, 40 is just the beginning.
SUPFEMALE:The beginning of the end! What we're trying to say here is What is going on? The candles, sir.
SUPFEMALE:The system really isn't equipped for that kind of heat.
SUPMALE:Two returns in two days.
LEADMALE:How humiliating.
OTHERMALE:The second time I had to pretend I was my own twin.
SUPMALE:Well, what did you get her?
LEADFEMALE:This is Mom-proof.
LEADMALE:Any professor would be proud to carry this whether she's wearing a dress or a G-string.
LEADMALE:'Course, with that second outfit, attendance would shoot up.
SUPFEMALE:Among other things.
LEADMALE:Where's your mom? She hasn't come down since we got home from school.
LEADMALE:She's probably going to be moody and depressed.
SUPMALE:So let's try and be understanding, okay?
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Hello, everyone!
SUPMALE:Hi, Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it a beautiful day? Good call, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Philip, I had the greatest day, thanks to you.
LEADFEMALE:That party really helped me put things in perspective.
LEADMALE:Last night I realized that my career has gotten in the way of the thing that's the most important to me.
LEADMALE:That's wonderful, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I hope you know I'm behind you, whether you want to be a professor or a loving wife who devotes her day to supporting her hardworking husband and keeping an immaculate home.
LEADMALE:I'm glad.
LEADFEMALE:Because I've made a decision.
SUPMALE:You're gonna vacuum in that? No! I'm gonna dance.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm all set for dance class.
SUPFEMALE:Has anybody seen my keys? Where's my purse? Where's my car? Aunt Viv, maybe I should drive you.
LEADMALE:I gotta go down to Jazz's anyway.
LEADFEMALE:I'd appreciate that, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, before you go, could you sign this so I can go to cheerleader tryouts? Oh, Ashley, I am so proud of you.
LEADMALE:Sweety, I know you've wanted to do this since you were a child.
OTHERMALE:But just 
LEADMALE:No matter how nervous you get don't give up.
LEADFEMALE:No matter what the odds.
LEADMALE:Even if you feel foolish leaving an important position at your school.
LEADFEMALE:You have to hold your head up high walk out that door, get in your car, and follow your dream.
LEADMALE:Y'all remember that movie, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? The Israeli folk-dancing class is down the hall.
OTHERFEMALE:Is this Advanced Jazz?
SUPMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:Then I'm in the right place.
SUPMALE:So, anyway, last summer I was in A Chorus Line and Oklahoma.
OTHERMALE:Really? I was in West Side Story, Gypsy, and My Fair Lady.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Actually, the last thing I was in was the supermarket.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you could say, you know, I'm into all type of artistic endeavors, you know? I like dance, the theater, opera.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a pretty cultured brother.
SUPFEMALE:Wow, just like that, huh? Okay, we'll start in a minute.
LEADMALE:Up.
SUPMALE:All right, class, let's begin.
LEADFEMALE:Warm up, space it out.
SUPFEMALE:And five, six, seven, eight.
LEADMALE:And contract.
LEADMALE:Five and six, head, seven, eight.
SUPMALE:Fingers open, straighten out.
OTHERMALE:Head look, contract, release.
LEADFEMALE:And up.
SUPMALE:And stand, and pose.
SUPFEMALE:Repeat.
LEADFEMALE:Five and six and seven, eight.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Arms up, contract.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Up! So, Mom, how was dance class? It was like heaven.
LEADMALE:Except the angels was doing splits.
OTHERMALE:It was hell on earth.
LEADMALE:So, how was dance class? Great! You know, Vivian, maybe you jumped into this too fast.
SUPMALE:You might just need to relax.
SUPFEMALE:And I have just the thing.
LEADFEMALE:Two first-class tickets to Hawaii! Philip, how could you? I just thought you might want to take it easy.
LEADMALE:Easy? Easy? Philip, I took it easy 20 years ago when I got that teaching degree.
LEADMALE:I don't want to take the comfortable road anymore.
SUPFEMALE:And you shouldn't have to.
LEADFEMALE:Hand over the keys to your Benz.
OTHERFEMALE:No one is going to stop me from being a dancer.
SUPMALE:Now, there's an audition in three weeks, and I am going to take every class I can.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna show the world that Vivian Banks can dance.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is it.
LEADMALE:The audition.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'd better get going, huh? I guess I'm a little nervous, but that's silly.
LEADMALE:Why should I be nervous? I just have to do a few dance steps in front of a professional choreographer and a room full of 20-year-olds who've been dancing their whole lives.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go to bed and eat a cheesecake.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:Vivian.
LEADMALE:You're gonna go to that audition and you're gonna give it everything you've got.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Philip.
LEADMALE:Hey, go get them, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:You know, Uncle Phil most husbands wouldn't want their wives running off half naked to a bunch of bulging, masculine dancers that's gonna be grabbing them and lifting them in places their husbands forgot existed.
LEADFEMALE:I guess that's what trust in a marriage is all about.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Will.
LEADMALE:Vivian! Excuse me.
LEADMALE:There's an audition here today.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:Auditions usually require dance training.
LEADMALE:You haven't been to any classes.
LEADFEMALE:Unless you count Lamaze.
LEADMALE:Well, actually, I've been taking private instruction with Natalia Broshkova.
LEADFEMALE:The dancer?
SUPMALE:No, the obstetrician.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, people.
LEADMALE:We're looking for three of our leading roles, so let's get started.
LEADMALE:We have to learn this combination.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay? Five, six five, six, seven, eight.
LEADFEMALE:A one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
OTHERFEMALE:Down, up, and rock, and rock, and one, two, three, four, and five, six seven, eight.
LEADFEMALE:One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
LEADFEMALE:One, two, head, head, head, over up, pop-pop.
SUPMALE:And walk it, and walk it, and walk it.
SUPMALE:And step, step, double turn, down, cross, swing around.
SUPMALE:Up, change.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Let me have my first four.
LEADFEMALE:Let's have you you you, and you.
LEADFEMALE:Come on down.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody else All right, ready? Here we go.
LEADMALE:Five, six five, six, seven, eight.
LEADMALE:One.
LEADFEMALE:All right! All right! Very good! Okay.
SUPMALE:Next four.
SUPFEMALE:Are you ready? Five, six, seven, eight So, you're home.
LEADFEMALE:So, is there anything you know, new? Audition go okay? It was better than okay.
LEADMALE:It was great.
SUPMALE:They offered me one of the lead roles! That's great, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:Hold up.
LEADFEMALE:When's the cast party? I wanna sit next to that honey that was doing the splits.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold it, guys.
LEADFEMALE:I am not gonna do the show.
SUPMALE:I turned down the part.
OTHERMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:I mean, if that's okay with you.
LEADMALE:Philip for the last 20 years I have wondered if I could have made it as a dancer.
SUPFEMALE:And now I know I could have twenty years ago.
LEADMALE:These have been the hardest three weeks of my life.
LEADMALE:There isn't a part of my body that isn't aching for Bengay.
LEADFEMALE:But I miss books.
LEADFEMALE:I miss my kids.
LEADFEMALE:And do you know what I miss the most? What, honey? H√§agen-Dazs Vanilla Swiss Almond.
OTHERMALE:I wish I could have seen those kids' expressions.
LEADMALE:Sounds like you left them dancing in your dust.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, do you think I'm old? Of course not.
OTHERMALE:Do you think I'm pretty? Woman, look in that mirror and tell me what you see.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let me tell you.
SUPFEMALE:I see every great thing a man could possibly want in a woman.
OTHERMALE:Eyes so dark and deep a man could get lost in them.
LEADMALE:Skin the color of mahogany soft as satin.
LEADFEMALE:A body fit for a goddess.
SUPFEMALE:Look how beautiful you are.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:Look how beautiful you are.
LEADMALE:Why do you think I make it home by 6:00 every night? I thought it was for those little cheese things Geoffrey makes.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you too tired for one more dance? Oh, baby, not with you.
SUPFEMALE:Philip! Maybe I should sit this one out.
LEADFEMALE:An even better idea.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey! Say hello to Miss Pompom!
OTHERFEMALE:Ashley, you made cheerleader?
LEADFEMALE:Yes!
LEADFEMALE:Will's cheer did it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, go on, show them your moves.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Will, but you'll have to fill in for little Bobby Greenspan.
SUPMALE:Okay, that'll be swell.
LEADFEMALE:One, two, three, four.
SUPMALE:Your school is whack! Your school is whack! Wherever y'all came from, just take your butts back! You look great, and you always will! You are the greatest 40 Any professor would be proud to carry this whether she's wearing a dress or a G-string.
LEADMALE:'Course, that second outfit you know, would do something.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I do know my line.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it just slipped my memory for a second.
LEADFEMALE:But I know it!
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah I know what it is! I know what it is! 
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I can't feel it yet, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Move a little to the right, baby.
LEADMALE:I'm about to go downstairs to the family room.
SUPMALE:Gee, I hope there ain't nobody down there getting busy.
SUPFEMALE:Will, your aunt thought her earring rolled under the couch.
SUPFEMALE:Look, man, y'all are married.
LEADMALE:Where y'all put your earrings is your business.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want, Will? Yo, them two Lakers tickets you promised me.
SUPMALE:I'm taking Jazz.
SUPMALE:No, you're not.
SUPMALE:I'm giving the other one to one of my clients' daughters.
LEADFEMALE:I get it.
OTHERMALE:This is a setup, right? Come on, Uncle Phil, no way.
OTHERMALE:I can't let my man down.
SUPMALE:They're floor seats, center court.
LEADMALE:You know, come to think of it, I don't even know if Jazz likes basketball.
LEADFEMALE:Don't try to move the couch, Philip.
SUPMALE:Just forget the earring.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:Why not? Because I can't stand up.
SUPMALE:In theory, that probably means that you can't run, either.
LEADFEMALE:Right? Which probably makes this a pretty good time to tell you that I wore that earring to school today.
SUPFEMALE:Get him, Vivian.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Geoffrey, it looks like I'm all ready for the harvest dance.
LEADFEMALE:Tux? Check.
LEADFEMALE:Shoes? Check.
LEADMALE:And a pure silk, hand-stitched pocket square.
LEADMALE:Exquisite.
LEADMALE:It is definitely peach season, man.
LEADMALE:Will, that's disgusting.
SUPFEMALE:Would you please clean this for me, Geoffrey? I would prefer an assassin's bullet to this kind of living hell.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, I think G's drawers must be bunching again.
LEADFEMALE:So have you got a date to the dance yet? I will when I call Claudia.
LEADMALE:Claudia? As in head cheerleader? Why don't you just ask Sinead O'Connor? I did, but she had to wash her hair.
LEADMALE:That's probably your date to the Lakers' game.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you just take her to the dance? Wait.
SUPFEMALE:First of all, it is not a date.
OTHERMALE:She's coming to pick up her ticket, and then she's gonna go.
SUPFEMALE:Man, I'm not down with that blind-date stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Every time they get here they look like Yo, man, where's my date? Miss Denice Williams.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, I'm Dee Dee.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe we got center court, floor seats to the Lakers' game.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my team.
LEADFEMALE:I know they're gonna kick butt tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you think? Hello? I know they don't walk in LA, but I at least hoped they talked.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Will and this is my cousin Carlton.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Can you do that and walk at the same time? That's darn clever.
SUPFEMALE:So, Dee Dee, what school do you go to?
LEADFEMALE:Well, I just moved here Listen, Dee Dee, you know what? I don't think I'm gonna be able to take you to that game 'cause I got this stuff piled in my car.
SUPMALE:There probably wouldn't be enough room for you.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, not just you, anybody.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about?
LEADMALE:Our blind date to the game.
LEADFEMALE:Blind date? No, see, I don't do blind dates.
LEADMALE:I mean, you think it's gonna be Mr.
LEADMALE:Right and then it ends up being some tall, skinny guy with big ears and weird clothes.
OTHERMALE:I mean, not just you, anybody.
SUPMALE:Look, here you go.
LEADMALE:Here's your ticket.
OTHERMALE:Hey, maybe I'll see you at the game.
SUPMALE:You probably will.
LEADMALE:I'll be the one in the seat next to you shouting my phone number to Magic Johnson.
LEADMALE:Bye, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you later.
SUPMALE:I hope Magic ate his Wheaties.
LEADMALE:Okay, here are the files you asked for, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I need a copy of the Richburg merger and find out if we got a continuance on the Seger case.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, I am tired of this.
LEADFEMALE:You're just lying on your back giving orders, and I'm doing all the work.
OTHERFEMALE:Why does this seem so familiar? Well, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to get a little work done.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, Dr.
LEADMALE:Black said the best thing for you to do is rest.
LEADFEMALE:Now if you need anything else, use the intercom.
SUPMALE:Yo, what's up, Uncle Phil? Hey, yo, the game was live, man.
SUPMALE:The Sixers crushed the Lakers.
LEADFEMALE:I never heard so much rough language in my life.
OTHERMALE:Was Dee Dee offended?
LEADMALE:No, only when they told her to shut up.
LEADMALE:You know, Dee Dee is real cool, though, man.
SUPFEMALE:She's coming over tomorrow.
LEADMALE:We gonna listen to some tapes.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like you two are getting along.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Why don't you ask her to the dance? You're clowning me, right, Uncle Phil? No, but look, man, I'm telling you, Dee Dee is real down and everything but you know how it would be to take somebody to the dance that's real big.
SUPMALE:On sports, big Yeah, well, look, I already asked Claudia anyway almost.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, baby.
LEADMALE:I came to keep you company.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's the remote? Darling, there's nothing on TV to stimulate the intelligent mind.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, you must be tripping, man.
LEADFEMALE:This is the episode of Star Trek where Captain Kirk sleeps with that green girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, that is such worthless drivel.
LEADFEMALE:Look, the home-shopper's channel.
LEADMALE:So with the Sandwich King all you need is two pieces of white bread and a can of delicious chili.
LEADMALE:And in less than a minute you have a mouthwatering chili-pocket.
SUPFEMALE:You gourmets may want to squirt a little cheese on top.
LEADMALE:Yuck.
SUPFEMALE:Man, I haven't heard of nothing that disgusting since Clarence Thomas found that hair on his cola.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, you are entitled to your opinion but the best movie ever made was not Cleopatra Jones.
SUPFEMALE:It was Casablanca.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADMALE:Here you have a movie set in Africa there's only one brother in the whole thing, and he's from Detroit.
SUPMALE:Okay, but you know a movie I really like?
OTHERFEMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Shaft.
LEADMALE:Shut your mouth.
SUPFEMALE:I'm talking about Shaft.
LEADMALE:Then we can dig it.
SUPMALE:"He's a complicated man "but no one understands him but his woman.
LEADMALE:" John Shaft.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, G.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what's up, G? You don't think that's funny? Yes.
OTHERMALE:I'm about to laugh myself into a seizure.
SUPFEMALE:This is just fine and dandy.
LEADMALE:The cleaners shrunk my tux.
LEADMALE:Carl, man, you can wear that.
OTHERMALE:Just put it on and say, "Boss, da plane, da plane.
LEADFEMALE:" Why don't you just rent a tux? Great.
LEADMALE:Wear used clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't I just go pitch a tent under a freeway and eat cold beans with a stick? It's just a dance.
LEADMALE:But I heard the music is gonna be bumping.
SUPMALE:It's probably gonna be a lot of fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I've already asked Claudia, almost.
SUPFEMALE:You know, right, cool.
SUPMALE:Well, you know, see, I'm still trying to get my rap together.
LEADMALE:I got as far as, "Yo, yo, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, baby, yo.
LEADMALE:" Look, I don't mean to butt in, but I'm sure her name is not Yo and I know she ain't got your baby.
LEADMALE:I mean, why don't you try something more honest 
LEADFEMALE:I think you're great.
LEADMALE:I'd be honored if you'd go to the dance with me.
LEADMALE:Honest.
OTHERFEMALE:Damn, what a concept.
LEADFEMALE:You know, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:See, you know what? Most women won't tell you stuff like that.
SUPFEMALE:That's cool, you know.
SUPFEMALE:No, really, you're different.
OTHERMALE:You know, I mean, you're not afraid to just say what you think, you know or do something silly, or, you know, just bug out.
LEADFEMALE:That's decent.
LEADMALE:You make me feel so, man, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:So So hungry.
SUPFEMALE:Hungry is what you make me.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, man.
LEADMALE:I could go for a nacho refill, right? Yeah? Right, I'm gonna make this call to Claudia first though, right? You know, I mean, I don't want to forget what you said.
LEADFEMALE:Honest, right? Honest.
SUPMALE:There's a hex on me.
SUPFEMALE:All the tuxes that are halfway acceptable in this town have been rented.
SUPMALE:My shoes, which I put outside for a final Scotchgarding were carried off by a Labrador retriever.
LEADMALE:What else could go wrong? How about that big old zit on your nose? I'm finished with my hoagie, Aunt Viv.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go meet Dee Dee for a pizza.
SUPMALE:Dee Dee?
SUPMALE:Is that who you're taking to the dance?
SUPFEMALE:No, Aunt Viv.
SUPMALE:See, it's not like that with me and Dee Dee.
LEADFEMALE:We're just buddies.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going with Claudia Prescott.
OTHERMALE:That girl's built to take all of my money.
SUPMALE:I like Dee Dee.
LEADFEMALE:She's fun.
SUPFEMALE:And she's cute.
OTHERFEMALE:But I'm worried about her cholesterol level.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I'll see you all later.
LEADFEMALE:My man, Will.
SUPMALE:Ty, what's up, baby?
SUPMALE:What up, man? Dee Dee, I'd like you to meet my friend, Ty.
OTHERFEMALE:My sister, how you doing?
OTHERMALE:Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:Check it out.
OTHERMALE:Let me go grab my order pad.
LEADMALE:I'll hook you up.
SUPFEMALE:All right, man.
OTHERMALE:Yo, bro.
LEADFEMALE:Kellogg Lieberbaum, yo.
SUPFEMALE:This is my man, Cornflake.
OTHERMALE:Well, aren't you going to introduce us to your date? This is my friend, Dee Dee.
LEADMALE:Dee Dee, meet the brat pack.
SUPMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me while I go to Hell, I'm going to the bathroom.
OTHERMALE:Good work, bro.
LEADMALE:She's quite a fly sister.
SUPMALE:Yeah, and I bet she's tons of fun.
LEADFEMALE:You know, as a matter of fact, she is.
SUPMALE:Hey, good honey is hard to find.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, that one would be hard to lose.
OTHERFEMALE:Cornflake, remind me to talk about them guy's mothers when we get to school on Monday.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, Ty, give me a large pepperoni and two colas.
OTHERFEMALE:So we got your date covered.
LEADFEMALE:What you having? Hey, look, Ty.
LEADMALE:Come on, please.
LEADFEMALE:Don't even start.
SUPMALE:That is my friend, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:All right, cool out, man, you know, 'cause it ain't my fault the babe's got more buns than a day-old bakery.
SUPMALE:That's all I'm saying.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, now, hold on.
LEADMALE:Now how you trying to play me?
OTHERFEMALE:I ain't trying to play you.
SUPMALE:You've seen the honeys that I've had up in here.
LEADFEMALE:I can't figure out how a brother goes from T-bone to rump roast.
LEADMALE:That's all.
LEADFEMALE:Man, that girl is not my girlfriend.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not your friend, either.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dee Dee.
OTHERMALE:Hey, this is Will.
LEADFEMALE:Pick up that phone, girl.
LEADMALE:Hey, Dee Dee, I ain't playing.
SUPMALE:Pick up the phone.
SUPMALE:Hey, Dee Dee, if you don't pick up that phone, I'm gonna have to call you back.
LEADFEMALE:And I ain't afraid to do it, neither.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Dee Dee, I'm sorry about yesterday.
LEADMALE:I was tripping.
LEADMALE:I'll call you back later.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:I don't even know why I'm making such a big deal about this.
LEADMALE:She's not even my type.
LEADMALE:You like the same movies, same music same food, same jokes and you both enjoy sticking straws up your noses.
SUPFEMALE:I know, Aunt Viv, but other than that we don't have nothing in common.
LEADFEMALE:It's her weight, isn't it? You may have noticed that your Uncle Philip is overweight.
SUPFEMALE:And you may also have noticed that I could care less and that I love him very, very much.
LEADFEMALE:Dad changed his mind.
OTHERMALE:He doesn't want a Belgian waffle.
LEADFEMALE:He wants you to use his new Sandwich King to make a chili-pocket sandwich.
LEADMALE:I'll put some chili in his pocket.
LEADFEMALE:Dee Dee? Hold on.
LEADMALE:It's for you, man.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hi, Kelly.
SUPFEMALE:All ready for tomorrow night's big soiree? What do you mean you can't go? What kind of medical reason? A pimple? Kelly, that's no reason to stay home.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I have a pimple.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, I have two.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? That's it, my life is cursed.
LEADFEMALE:No tux, no shoes, no date.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:There's got to be someone I can call.
LEADFEMALE:But what kind of girl is sitting home without a date for a Saturday night? A great girl.
LEADMALE:So, anyway, Tiffany and Nica and I walk into the Yacht Club and we're the only ones in white.
OTHERFEMALE:So Tiffany says, "Oh, my God! It's the day after Labor Day.
SUPFEMALE:" And we just all wanted to die.
SUPMALE:And that's a true story.
SUPMALE:Wow, have you sold the movie rights yet? I don't get it.
LEADFEMALE:Look, here comes Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in, C.
LEADFEMALE:You look cool, man.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I probably don't look as bad as I think, huh? No, you got a sort of a Lou Rawls thing going there, man.
OTHERMALE:Yes, Carlton, you do look top-notch, I must say so.
LEADMALE:Honestly, Will, if he sits with us, I'm leaving.
SUPMALE:Well, Claudia, what are you talking about? That's my cousin.
SUPMALE:Well, it ain't like we brothers or nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Beat it, C.
LEADMALE:Hey, Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:Great minds think alike, huh? I wonder if you could hang yourself with a cummerbund.
OTHERMALE:Next to your faithful dog this Prince Albert pants-presser is a man's best friend.
LEADFEMALE:For just $39.
SUPMALE:95 your creases will be the talk of the town.
LEADFEMALE:And the attachments Darn.
SUPFEMALE:That's what I should have ordered instead of that pinky ring.
LEADFEMALE:What is going on in here? We're shopping in the comfort of our home and we're saving money, too.
LEADFEMALE:How did they do it? "Volume.
LEADFEMALE:" Philip, Dr.
SUPMALE:Black said you should be resting.
LEADMALE:I want everyone to leave.
SUPMALE:Bye, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Last one to the family room pays for all the shipping and handling.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, if you ever want to stand up straight again you need some rest.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'll just lay here and do nothing flat on my back.
LEADMALE:Philip, I'm so sorry if I was stupid enough to think that there was something really wrong with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Vivian it's a miracle.
OTHERMALE:I can walk! And then, if you divide the number of atoms in a cubic centimeter of air by the number of people in this room, you get a prime number.
OTHERMALE:That is totally nifty, isn't it, Carlton? So there we are in a sailboat in the middle of the lake and I look down and Nica has on sandals instead of deck shoes.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, can you just imagine how I felt? Yeah, like jamming a fork in your hand you know, just to make sure you're still alive.
SUPMALE:No, but that's okay.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'm gonna go fix my hair.
SUPFEMALE:Cornflake, come on, come with me, man.
LEADFEMALE:You push her in.
LEADFEMALE:I'll flush.
LEADMALE:You know, I wonder what Dee Dee is doing, man.
SUPFEMALE:She's dancing.
LEADFEMALE:What? How do you know that?
LEADFEMALE:Because she's right over there.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:She's supposed to be at home not returning my phone calls.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Dee Dee, what are you doing here? And who's this? I'm dancing.
LEADMALE:This is Robert.
OTHERMALE:Robert, this is Will.
SUPFEMALE:We used to hang out.
LEADMALE:Hi, Will.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go get us some punch.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Where'd you find him at? Rent-a-sucker? Look, I'm on a date, Will.
SUPFEMALE:You know, like when a guy who likes a girl asks her out and they go somewhere and he still acts nice to her when they get there? You know, I do go on dates.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Dee Dee, I just thought that You just thought that 'cause I'm not a size six, no one would ask me out.
LEADMALE:Well, not everyone feels like that.
LEADFEMALE:I mean that's just your hang-up, isn't it? Dee Dee, listen.
LEADMALE:I really like you a lot, all right? You really like being with me as long as no one thinks you're with me.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'm sorry, but that's just not good enough for me.
LEADFEMALE:So that's when we realized that we were the only ones in white.
LEADMALE:And we just all wanted to die.
SUPMALE:You know what color I really like? Strawberry.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:and now that Beemer runs like a top.
LEADMALE:You know, I think that's really ex-straw-dinary I don't get it.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Hold it, Dee Dee.
SUPMALE:Would you ever wear white after Labor Day? If I can button it, and it's clean, I'll pretty much wear anything.
LEADMALE:My kind of honey.
LEADMALE:You know, Dee Dee I never thought I'd have you in bed on the first night.
SUPMALE:Well, I can honestly say this is the first time I've ever done this.
LEADMALE:This clever device is probably I can't believe we didn't get in on that abdominizer.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that's because you couldn't decide between the chocolate gavel and the picture of the dogs playing poker.
OTHERMALE:Will you two be quiet? I'm trying to hear the musical toilet seat.
LEADMALE:It's 12:01.
LEADMALE:Thank God this day is over.
OTHERFEMALE:I look like I escaped from the '70s.
LEADMALE:I've spent the whole night with two guys who consider picking their faces a hobby and I got a flat tire on the way home.
LEADMALE:I just want to sit down and pretend this never happened and if one more thing happens to me, I'm gonna kill myself.

SUPMALE:May I recommend Chapter 7? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:And Mrs.

LEADMALE:Geoffrey, this book is dedicated to you.

LEADMALE:Bennett said.
LEADMALE:Those tonsils have just got to come out.
SUPMALE:Now there's no reason to be afraid.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you kidding? Why do you think they wear masks? So they can't be identified.
LEADFEMALE:And why do you think they knock you out? So you don't see them drinking margaritas over your open stomach.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry I'm late.
LEADMALE:I had to stop by the gift shop.
LEADMALE:Hey, thanks a lot, Hil, that's real nice.
OTHERMALE:Well, sometimes a girl just has to treat herself.

LEADMALE:It's your peace of mind, my friend.
SUPFEMALE:Let's say you die.
LEADFEMALE:Do you want just anyone to get their hands on that $323 and 15 cents you have hidden under your LL Cool J hat? I ain't think about it like that.
LEADFEMALE:Can I see that, Carlton? Sure, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I hate to break up this Hallmark moment, but visiting hours are over.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Well, you better get some rest, we better get going.
LEADMALE:No, Aunt Viv, no! Please can't you just stay one more itty bitty teenie weenie moment? Don't leave me here, Aunt Viv.

LEADFEMALE:Would you please pick it up for me? Thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:Beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:I never forget a face.

LEADFEMALE:Relax.
LEADFEMALE:As long as you got a good doctor, kid, what could go wrong? And now you'll have to excuse me.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna cop a sponge bath.
LEADFEMALE:Max, you're supposed to be in therapy.
LEADFEMALE:I played there 40 years ago.
OTHERFEMALE:Bad theater, lousy audience.
LEADFEMALE:Will Smith?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be performing your surgery.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:No, you won't, man.
LEADMALE:I want my regular doctor.
SUPFEMALE:When can I see Dr.
LEADMALE:Bennett? In five-to-10 years.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, relax.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Dr.
LEADMALE:Baylor and I'm eminently qualified to perform this operation.
LEADFEMALE:Where are my glasses? Oh, hell.
SUPMALE:Nurse, did they close up Miss Henderson yet? Never mind.
SUPFEMALE:But check my locker for my beeper, will you? All right, Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith, open your mouth.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, my man, your beeper ain't in here.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on, let me look at those tonsils.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so much for golf tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Hey, Doc, y'all just gonna take the tonsils, right? Hey, I got big plans for everything else.
LEADMALE:Trust me.
LEADFEMALE:You're in the hands of a capable doctor.
SUPMALE:I've got to find those glasses.
SUPFEMALE:God please don't let me leave here with breasts.
LEADMALE:Max!
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, what?
LEADMALE:What do you think of the rap tape? Rap tape? Sounded like an auction.
LEADFEMALE:Kreplach?
OTHERFEMALE:Yo, man, what'd you call me? Kreplach.
LEADMALE:It's a dumpling.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, have a nosh.
SUPMALE:Yo.
SUPMALE:Hey, Max?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Let me ask you something.
LEADMALE:You all cooped up in this hospital.
LEADMALE:Why are you so happy about it? Look, kid, I'm 83 years old.
SUPFEMALE:Inside I feel like I'm just as young as you.
SUPMALE:The difference is, you think you're immortal.
SUPFEMALE:Me, I know better.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to waste time feeling sorry for myself.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I mean? You know, you're really something, Max.
LEADMALE:Please, don't make me cry.
LEADMALE:I can't spare the fluid.
LEADFEMALE:Do me a favor, will you? Turn on the TV.
SUPMALE:Oh, sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Give me this.
LEADMALE:So what do you wanna watch, Max? Man, I had forgotten how big Jimmie Walker's lips was.
SUPMALE:Max? Goodnight, Max.
LEADFEMALE:I'm very sorry, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Peterson, we did the best we could.
SUPMALE:But, Doctor, I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:We just brought little Billy to the hospital for a field trip.
LEADMALE:And now he's Doctors play God, and patients get the short end of the scalpel on the next Oprah Winfrey Show.
LEADFEMALE:Why aren't we sleeping, Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith? 'Cause we in here bugging out, Nurse Petty.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a job for Mr.
LEADMALE:Needle.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, I must got the wrong number.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, Will Smith, man, my main patient.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, homey?
SUPMALE:Doctor Dr√©?
LEADMALE:Yo, man, what's happening, man? Yo, this next LP, man, has got your name written all over it.
OTHERFEMALE:All over it, homey.
LEADMALE:You know what it's called?
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Yo man, it's called Death Certificate, man.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, man, are you ready for some dope cuts? No! Confounded! Everywhere I go, I hear the same damn music.
LEADMALE:That'll be all now, Nurse.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, wait a minute, man
OTHERFEMALE:you ain't no doctor.
LEADFEMALE:No, but I play one on TV.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you that dude from the soap opera.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, didn't you just die in a car crash?
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Right now I'm hanging precariously on the edge of a cliff and I intend to stay there until they put a window in my dressing room.
LEADMALE:Now, let's get busy with that brain transplant, shall we? Whoa, man.
LEADMALE:I'm just getting my tonsils out.
LEADFEMALE:Tonsils don't get ratings, young man.
LEADMALE:One of us will be right back, right after this commercial.
LEADFEMALE:Gloves.
SUPFEMALE:Gauze.
SUPMALE:Scalpel.
OTHERMALE:Yo, man, you better be using that scalpel to cut some lemon wedges for Isaac.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, buddy, I don't have all day.
SUPFEMALE:In 15 minutes, I gotta meet Adrienne Barbeau on the poop deck.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, man, I don't care if you're playing shuffleboard with Nipsey Russell.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't getting cut by no doctor with knee socks.
LEADMALE:Look, there's nothing to worry about.
SUPFEMALE:I've pretended to do this operation a thousand times.
LEADMALE:Look, this time they've given me a real scalpel.
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
LEADMALE:Man, I'm getting out of here before Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Hannibal Lecter shows up.
LEADFEMALE:Doctor, the patient in 214 is not responding to the medication.
SUPMALE:What should I do? Well, Nurse, I'd run a KGB and an NAACP.
LEADFEMALE:If he still doesn't respond give him an upper GI Joe.
LEADMALE:I've got to get my real estate license.
SUPMALE:They got some free ice-cream and cake in the cafeteria.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is enjoyable.
LEADFEMALE:It's been too long since we've spent quality time together.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy's right.
SUPFEMALE:Can I go now? Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:We're a family.
OTHERMALE:We should express our feelings.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, let's cut the crapola and get to what's really on our minds.
LEADMALE:Oh, sweetheart, Will's operation's gonna go fine.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about Geoffrey's book.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey can write whatever he wants.
LEADMALE:This family has nothing to hide.
OTHERMALE:Your father's right.
LEADMALE:Now I don't want to hear any more about it, okay? Philip, would you help me clear the dishes, please? Geoffrey knows everything about us.
LEADMALE:If Mom and Dad find out what really goes on around here, they're going to kill us.
LEADMALE:We've got to get that book.
OTHERMALE:The Butler's Tales, Chapter 42.
SUPMALE:Someone get that damn door! Oh, that would be me.
SUPMALE:All right, all right.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate this part of the job.
LEADFEMALE:It's never for me.
LEADMALE:Those memoirs have got to be in here somewhere.
LEADMALE:Okay, Ashley, we're in.
LEADFEMALE:Now hit the dirt and start twitching.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, we've got to find those memoirs.
LEADMALE:I'll just die if my friends find out why Lou in Better Shoes gives me that 10% discount.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, what if my friends find out I sleep with a hand puppet? Move over, Carlton.
LEADMALE:I don't have any room.
LEADFEMALE:Will, move over.
SUPMALE:Will? Geoffrey, we'd like to speak to you for a moment.
SUPFEMALE:He's not here, Philip, let's go.
SUPMALE:Not so quick, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:Do you really want Hilary to find out she was conceived during a Sly Stone concert? Well, it never would have happened if he hadn't been five hours late.
LEADMALE:All right, everybody out.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? What are y'all doing here? And I hope them concert tickets wasn't front row.
OTHERMALE:Is that why you always play Hot Fun in the Summertime on my birthday?
SUPMALE:Where was I conceived?
LEADMALE:Probably at a white sale.
SUPMALE:That's enough.
LEADFEMALE:Will, why aren't you in the hospital? I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I'm scared of going under the knife.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, if I wanted to get cut I'd let Stevie Wonder do my fade.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetheart, I know you're nervous about this operation but you have to believe that we know what's best for you.
LEADMALE:The bottom line is it has to be done.
OTHERMALE:So you have a choice.
SUPFEMALE:You can either be dragged in kicking and screaming or you can stand up and walk in like a man.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Will, we're gonna step outside and talk to your doctor.
LEADMALE:You've given us your word that you won't try to escape, and I trust you.
LEADFEMALE:Abdulla, here's $100.
SUPFEMALE:If he tries to run, sit on him.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we'll be right back, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, so, where's Max at? Out playing doctor with a couple nurses? No, I'm afraid Max has gone to a better place.
LEADFEMALE:What? Gone?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, he went.
OTHERMALE:Just like that.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, hold it.
LEADMALE:That's his lucky hat.
LEADMALE:Here I am acting like a little baby over a couple of tonsils.
SUPFEMALE:Max had all that stuff wrong with him.
SUPFEMALE:Never even complained.
OTHERFEMALE:So long, Max.
LEADMALE:Hi, Will, how do you feel? Like I swallowed a weed whacker.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello there, Master Will.
LEADMALE:I've brought you something to read.
SUPMALE:What is it, G?
SUPMALE:My memoirs.
LEADMALE:Give me that.
LEADMALE:Let me have it.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you scratched me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment.
LEADMALE:I've just come back from my literary agent and the memoirs have been rejected.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I'm sorry, G.
LEADMALE:What'd your agent say? I believe he referred to it as "Sominex in a dust jacket.
LEADMALE:" Hi, kid.
LEADFEMALE:Max.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you died.
LEADMALE:In Pittsburgh I died.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't my fault.
LEADMALE:I was opening for a seal.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:The nurse said you went on to a better place.
LEADMALE:I did.
LEADFEMALE:Cedars-Sinai Hospital.
LEADFEMALE:They've got cable.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I just came back to get my lucky hat.
LEADMALE:I'm glad you're okay, kid.
LEADFEMALE:You know, maybe we could hang out sometime.
SUPMALE:Maybe.
LEADFEMALE:If you were a woman and I had a prostate.
LEADFEMALE:See you around, kid.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Max, you're forgetting your lucky hat.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I forgot.
SUPMALE:I forgot the hat.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell you what, kid you keep it.
LEADMALE:Oh, Nurse? Kreplach.
LEADFEMALE:It's a dumpling.
LEADMALE:I got kugel here.
SUPFEMALE:Tsimmes, latkes.
OTHERFEMALE:Jewish Why are you so happy about it? Look, kid, I'm 83 years old.
LEADFEMALE:And I chewing on the What you got to go through for a lousy $100,000 a show.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I think Aunt Viv put the Ring Dings in the cabinet over here.
LEADMALE:The sink is busted, and I'm trying to fix it, Will.
LEADMALE:Wait, Uncle Phil, no.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey's eyebrows just grew back from the time you tried to fix the stove, man.
LEADMALE:Philip, drop the wrench and step away from the sink.
SUPFEMALE:Why does everybody act like I'm dangerous when I'm trying to fix something? Have you forgotten the toaster incident, sweetie? Geoffrey hasn't.
LEADFEMALE:How was I supposed to know a piece of whole wheat would scratch a man's cornea? Besides, I know plumbing.
LEADMALE:Certainly got the pants for it.
LEADMALE:I'm calling the plumber.
LEADMALE:I'm calling the tailor.
LEADMALE:Hello? Philip, did you do something to the phone? There was a little static on the line, so I did a little rewiring.
LEADMALE:Honey, there's no dial tone.
LEADMALE:There's no static, either.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the keys to your car, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:Thanks for letting me use it.
LEADMALE:You're welcome, baby.
OTHERMALE:When are you gonna get your car fixed? I don't have to.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna win a brand-new Corvette on this game show.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
SUPMALE:Right after your Uncle Philip repairs something that doesn't send Geoffrey to the emergency room.
LEADFEMALE:No, seriously, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:They were recruiting down at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be on the game show, Double Trouble.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna be on TV?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, that is so exciting.
OTHERMALE:All right! All right.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Viv, I'll push and if you Spackle real fast, we could probably wall him in.
LEADMALE:Well, I just called the repairman from the car phone.
SUPMALE:They can't come out until tomorrow.
LEADMALE:No phone service for 24 hours? This is a nightmare.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, it's like we've vanished off the face of the earth! Don't be so dramatic, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, she's not being dramatic.
SUPFEMALE:Jimmie Walker's phone went out for 24 hours in the late 70s and, hey, well, y'all know the rest.
LEADMALE:The phones are still out.
SUPMALE:Excuse my language, Dad, but it's got to be said I'm behind you, big guy.
LEADMALE:Mom, Cathy's line is busy.
OTHERMALE:Can I have the keys so I can drive the phone over to her house? Sure, honey, in four years.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure the phone will still be broken.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that reminds me.
SUPMALE:When I win that brand-new Corvette, I'm gonna have a phone on the dash leather on the seats, and Halle Berry on my lap.
SUPMALE:I can't believe you're gonna be on Double Trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Double Trouble? Are you nuts? You want to embarrass yourself in front of the entire country for a lifetime supply of Alberto VO5? What you talking about, man? It ain't embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE:All I gotta do is answer a couple questions and let my partner squirt some stuff all over me.
LEADMALE:Wasn't Jimmy Swaggart just arrested for that? So, who's gonna be your partner? Oh, Kellogg Leiberbaum.
LEADFEMALE:He's the smartest dude in school.
LEADMALE:He's gonna call me on the car phone at 8:00.
OTHERFEMALE:That is, if Uncle Phil don't try to fix it.
SUPMALE:Well, that's it.
SUPMALE:The next person that mentions the phone, gets a boot in their behind.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks, your phone is broken.
OTHERFEMALE:It occurs to me, this family's got a lot to learn about hospitality.
OTHERMALE:Hey, what's up, J? I'm here to practice for the game show.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, how do you know I'm going on a game show? From Willy at Roscoe's Chicken 'n' Waffles.
SUPMALE:He knows everything.
LEADFEMALE:He's the source that revealed that Mariah Carey's black.
LEADMALE:Jazz, hold up a second, man.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Will.
LEADMALE:Yo, what's up, Ty?
LEADFEMALE:Bro.
LEADMALE:What's he doing here?
SUPFEMALE:No, what's he doing here? Well, come, now y'all not still mad at each other about the watch thing?
LEADMALE:Yo, he sold me a fake Rolex.
LEADMALE:You paid with a fake 20.
SUPFEMALE:All right, now first of all, you should have known that it was fake when you saw that the warranty was only for two hours.
LEADMALE:And you should have known that the Jackson on a 20 ain't Jermaine.
SUPMALE:They all look alike to me.
LEADMALE:Be that as it may, when do we start practicing for the game show?
LEADMALE:I'm his partner.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm his partner.
LEADFEMALE:What, wait, how does everybody know I'm going on a game show? Man, from Willy at Roscoe's Chicken 'n' Waffles.
LEADMALE:I'm telling He knows everything.
LEADMALE:He's the source who revealed Color Me Badd was white.
LEADMALE:Look, so is it gonna be me or him?
SUPMALE:I already got a partner.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Kellogg Leiberbaum.
LEADFEMALE:He's a dude from my school.
LEADMALE:My bro, if you did have to pick one of us.
LEADMALE:Speaking hypodermically.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to, so I'm not gonna choose.
LEADMALE:All right? Okay, you know, because I'm your best friend I respect your decision.
LEADFEMALE:Because I am your best friend.
LEADMALE:Peace, my best friend.
SUPMALE:Some best friend.
LEADMALE:When you go to your car, you gotta walk.
LEADFEMALE:What? Don't you?
LEADMALE:Please, watch this.
OTHERFEMALE:Yo, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks, my tubby judicial brother.
LEADMALE:Man, there ain't no water pressure.
OTHERFEMALE:Somebody in this house broke the three-minute shower limit.
LEADMALE:Obviously, it wasn't you.
LEADFEMALE:Would you mind standing downwind? My fault, G.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I got a, kind of, Pep√© Le Pew thing going here.
OTHERFEMALE:Morning.
SUPMALE:Aunt Viv, can you please tell Uncle Phil to call the plumber? There's gotta be something you can do, or not do.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, can I get some coffee, please?
OTHERFEMALE:I'm working on it, madam.
OTHERMALE:Well, when will it be ready? At this rate? About the time Queen Elizabeth opens for Queen Latifah.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, why can't Daddy be like other lawyers and hire people and then sue them for inferior work? I mean, look at my hair.
LEADMALE:It hasn't been washed in 24 hours.
SUPFEMALE:I can't possibly go to work looking like this.
SUPFEMALE:Man, you sure can't.
LEADFEMALE:You should probably call in ugly.
OTHERMALE:Will, I hate to rain on your fashion parade but the Moms Mabley look is definitely pass√©.
LEADMALE:I was trying to take a shower, but there ain't no water pressure 'cause somebody broke the three-minute shower limit.
LEADFEMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:Don't give me that.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at these fingernails.
OTHERFEMALE:Look behind these ears.
LEADFEMALE:How long did you bathe today, young lady? Seven minutes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, but I had to wash.
LEADMALE:I have enough problems.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going through puberty for God's sake.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Aunt Viv, I'm telling you, if we band together we can take him.
SUPFEMALE:Leave him alone, honey, he's mine.
SUPMALE:Philip, baby if Mr.
LEADMALE:Goodwrench wants to visit Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Toolbox he'd better get Mr.
SUPMALE:Water running.
LEADMALE:Carlton, get the yellow pages.
SUPMALE:And now it's time for America's messiest, winningest program Double Trouble!
OTHERFEMALE:My brother.
LEADMALE:Yo, what's up, J? I see you're watching Double Trouble a show both salubrious and sudorific.
SUPMALE:For you, in recognition of our salubrious and sudorific friendship.
LEADMALE:You got a little salube on the side of your lip, too.
SUPMALE:What's this? That's me.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, Will.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's up, Ty?
LEADMALE:Nice weather we're having.
LEADFEMALE:Guess that's 'cause we're the third planet from the sun.
SUPFEMALE:Unlike Mercury, where the surface is perpetually molten.
LEADMALE:For you.
SUPFEMALE:I appreciate the gifts, fellas, but, you know I think I still want to see other people.
LEADMALE:Look, a little nasty piece of carpet with a vest.
SUPMALE:Will, this is Winky.
LEADFEMALE:Winky, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you get a stupid name like Winky? Man, Winky was my father's name.
SUPMALE:Will, could you tell this sucker to take his sack of lint and beat it? Me and you gotta practice for the game show.
OTHERMALE:Look, Will needs a partner who knows his trivia and no one's more trivial than me.
LEADMALE:Yeah, what Will needs is intellectual capacitance.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I already told you.
LEADMALE:Leiberbaum is my partner.
LEADMALE:Master William?
LEADMALE:Yo, what's up, G? Young Leiberbaum stopped by on his way to the airport.
LEADMALE:What? Where's he going?
LEADMALE:He wouldn't say.
LEADMALE:It appears he's been getting notes warning him to get out of town.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, how y'all gonna play Leiberbaum? Man, this is just a stupid game show.
SUPFEMALE:There's more at stake here than a stupid game show, my brother.
LEADMALE:That's right, our friendship's on the line.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, pick your best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, go ahead, Will, tell him.
OTHERMALE:Who's gonna be your partner? All right, I pick I pick Carlton.
OTHERMALE:Carlton is your partner? Yeah, what he got I ain't got? On a straight up tip, y'all, see, Carlton got this rare disease, right? And to go on this game show was his last desperate wish before he takes that old dirt nap.
LEADMALE:That's decent, Will.
LEADMALE:What he got? He got Bette Davis eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Will, can I borrow your Walkman? I'm going out for a five-mile run.
SUPMALE:Yo, this don't sound right.
LEADMALE:And you call yourself a friend.
LEADFEMALE:All right, so I lied.
LEADMALE:But, come on, y'all, I wanna win that car! I mean, and to win on these game shows you gotta be you know, Carlton-like.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it.
LEADMALE:His point exactly.
SUPMALE:You see, what Will is trying to say is and let me choose my words carefully you guys are stupid.
LEADMALE:Look, that is not what I'm trying to say.
SUPMALE:Look, it's like this, y'all.
SUPMALE:It's like, with Carlton Carlton, who is Captain Kangaroo's friend? Mr.
LEADMALE:Green Jeans.
SUPFEMALE:How many players on a cricket team?
LEADMALE:Eleven.
LEADFEMALE:Letters not on a phone dial?
LEADMALE:Q and Z.
SUPFEMALE:Best picture, 1936?
SUPFEMALE:The Great Ziegfeld.
SUPFEMALE:The third wife of Julius Caesar?
OTHERFEMALE:Calpurnia.
SUPMALE:You see? Yeah, I see.
OTHERFEMALE:You think we're stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I better be going but I guess I'm too stupid to find the door.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:I guess if we put our brains together we could find our way out.
LEADMALE:And by the way, can you remind me when to breathe? What just happened here, man? I sacrificed my two best friends for a stupid convertible.
SUPMALE:Yeah, well.
LEADFEMALE:The wind in my face will dry my tears.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck.
SUPMALE:Wait, hold up.
LEADFEMALE:You ain't gonna help me out?
LEADMALE:Certainly not.

LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
SUPFEMALE:All right now, Carlton and Tyriq, here's your question.

SUPMALE:You see, the ancient Mayans Carlton, your time is up.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Tyriq who is Jazz's best friend? I'm sorry, Bob, this is a bad time.

LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Will, sweetie, you've been snapping everything in sight for days.
SUPMALE:Now, what's going on? It's a photography assignment, Aunt Viv.
OTHERMALE:I wanted to do something meaningful and artistic but ain't nobody getting naked.
LEADFEMALE:Morning, all.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, the photography assignment is due today.
SUPMALE:You haven't snapped a single picture yet.
LEADFEMALE:Not to worry.
LEADMALE:Carlton, this is a photography assignment.
SUPMALE:Not a Prince video.
LEADMALE:Madam, sir, there is a most perturbing person out here who claims to be an old friend of yours.
LEADMALE:Who is it, Geoffrey?
SUPMALE:She didn't say.
SUPFEMALE:She was too busy calling me a pathetic servant of the capitalist fat cats.
LEADFEMALE:Marge.
LEADFEMALE:Marge.
SUPFEMALE:You look so good, girl, give me a hug! Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:Woman, the last time I saw you was that anti-war rally in '71.
SUPFEMALE:You stole my Afro comb.
LEADFEMALE:Don't look like you be needing it now.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Hey, how you doing? I'm Will.
LEADFEMALE:My God, you look just like my old boyfriend, EI.
OTHERFEMALE:I take it El was blindingly handsome.
SUPFEMALE:Who's EI?
LEADMALE:Eldridge Cleaver.
OTHERFEMALE:Was he related to Wally and the Beav? Hold it.
SUPFEMALE:You knew Eldridge Cleaver?
SUPMALE:We were all in the movement together.
LEADFEMALE:Me, EI, Olifami, and Adisimbol.
SUPMALE:Wait, hold up.
LEADMALE:Olifami and Adisimbol, too? Man, that's unbelievable.
LEADMALE:Who the hell are they? Phil is Olifami and Vivian is Adisimbol.
LEADMALE:Okay, and I'm "About To Bust A Gut-a.
SUPMALE:" Boy, you two have come a long way from that fifth floor walk-up you had when Olifami and I were in law school.
LEADMALE:Boy, those were the days.
SUPFEMALE:We marched on Washington, staged sit-ins, held hunger strikes.
LEADMALE:Would that have been between breakfast and lunch, or lunch and dinner? But we knew how to par-tay, too.
LEADFEMALE:Did we ever.
SUPFEMALE:Remember Woodstock?
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:20 of us tried to squeeze into that tent.
OTHERMALE:Vivian and I jumped into that lake naked.
LEADFEMALE:I wasn't at Woodstock.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Kids, did I tell you that Marge and I went to school together? That she graduated near the top of our law school class? So, Marge, are you with a firm or on your own? On my own.
LEADMALE:I'm still in the struggle.
LEADMALE:That's dope, Marge.
OTHERFEMALE:You never gave up on what you believed in.
OTHERFEMALE:I do my best.
OTHERMALE:Hey, check it out.
LEADMALE:Look right into the camera and say "Burn, baby, burn.
OTHERMALE:" No, you can't take my picture.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, just wait for me to freshen up a little.
SUPMALE:But speaking of pictures, look at what I have here.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:Who are those two weirdoes and who is that ugly little kid in the dashiki diaper? Those two weirdoes are your father and I, and that ugly little kid is you.
LEADMALE:The bone in your hair is a good look for you, Hilary.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you've got sort of a "yabba-dabba do.
LEADMALE:" Mom, look at how short your skirt is.
LEADMALE:Your mother's legs made the miniskirt famous.
LEADMALE:I have Mom's legs.
SUPFEMALE:Can I wear my skirt that short? You have my legs, and the answer is no.
LEADFEMALE:Marge, girl, you must be tired after your trip.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you're staying with us.
LEADMALE:And I don't want to hear any arguments.
SUPFEMALE:You aren't getting any.
SUPMALE:Just tell me where to plug in my eight-track.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey will take your bags up to the guest room.
LEADFEMALE:I carry my own bag.
LEADFEMALE:My brother, you have been oppressed, repressed, and suppressed by capitalism.
SUPMALE:Don't you know you can be free? I have known freedom, don't like the health plan.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey is not oppressed.
OTHERMALE:He's more our friend.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you, Geoff? Whatever you say, Phil.
LEADFEMALE:So you can see how Ansel Adams created a work of genius just by using light and shadow.
SUPMALE:Which brings me to your work, geniuses.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see those homework assignments.
LEADFEMALE:I like that.
LEADFEMALE:Will, that wouldn't happen to be gum in your mouth, would it?
LEADMALE:Yes, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Knotts.
SUPMALE:Cool, do you have any more? Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, this is It's a very, it's What the hell is it? Our assignment, sir.
SUPMALE:You asked us to experiment with shadow.
LEADMALE:I call this Bunny on a Wall.
LEADMALE:And I'm gonna call this Midget at a Desk.
LEADMALE:Everybody, before you go, there's something I'd like you to remember.
SUPFEMALE:I think that there is something very special about every single one of you.
SUPMALE:Class dismissed.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, hold up.
SUPMALE:What about our trip to the Mapplethorpe exhibit? Don't you want our permission slips? Mine ain't forged this time.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, Cornflake, where's your permission slip? Are you kidding? My parents won't let me look at naked photos.
SUPFEMALE:They thought The Little Mermaid was pornographic.
OTHERFEMALE:Turned me on.
LEADMALE:I can't go see the Mapplethorpe exhibit either.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, none of us is going.
LEADFEMALE:It seems that a lot of your parents just don't approve of this exhibit and since going was my bright idea
LEADFEMALE:I've been fired.
OTHERFEMALE:What? No.
LEADFEMALE:What? Hold up, they can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:This is an outrage! They can't give us a new teacher now.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I've spent the whole semester sucking up to you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Marge.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:I still can't believe they fired the best teacher that Bel-Air Prep ever had.
OTHERMALE:You know, you been talking about this for the past two days.
LEADMALE:Move on it.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what Malcolm 
LEADFEMALE:"By any means necessary.
LEADMALE:" Yeah, you know, Marge, you're right.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna move on it.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I like having you around.
LEADFEMALE:You get me all hyped and everything.
SUPMALE:I bet that's how you felt when you roomed with Angela Davis, right? Yeah.
SUPMALE:But we had a lot of huge arguments.
LEADMALE:Word? What? About her political views? No, about how she used to always put her name on everything in the refrigerator.
SUPFEMALE:Got on my nerves.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and I bet with that big old Afro, she probably had a lot of hair and Afro Sheen and stuff all over the place, right? Boy, don't get me started.
LEADMALE:You know what? I'm gonna call you Hasani.
LEADFEMALE:What, you just gonna dis me right in my face like that, Marge? No, it's Swahili.
LEADMALE:It means "handsome.
LEADMALE:" I like how you talk, Marge.
SUPMALE:I like how you think, too.
SUPMALE:Hey, you know what? I got a name for you, too.
LEADFEMALE:It's just "Too Legit To Quit.
OTHERMALE:" Hey, that's pretty clever.
LEADFEMALE:Did you just think of that? Yeah, why? You like it? Your Perrier, my sister.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Marge, listen.
LEADFEMALE:We just got tickets to the Roberta Flack concert tonight.
SUPMALE:Come on, we'll grab a bite to eat first.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't feel like going out tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, you haven't been anyplace since you've been here.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I mean, we'll make it another time, okay? Greetings, Sister Adisimbol.
LEADMALE:Greetings, Brother Olifami.
LEADMALE:Power to the people! Ash, you kind of look like Winnie the Pooh Mandela.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Daddy, I am a depressed minority and I want my allowance increased.
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Then I'm staging a sit-in and I won't eat my peas.
LEADMALE:You will eat your peas.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Daddy.
LEADMALE:Suppose Gandhi's parents treated him like this.
OTHERMALE:Gandhi ate his peas.
LEADMALE:Then I shall spray paint my demands on the pool house wall.
SUPMALE:We like to encourage free speech.
LEADFEMALE:We certainly do.
LEADMALE:Ashley! Girl, are you crazy? Get your butt back here! You're on the mike, what's your beef? No, sir, he just stepped out.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Sure, I'll tell him.
SUPMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:That was the FBI looking for Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder what they want.
SUPFEMALE:They want me.
LEADFEMALE:Look I guess I better just flat out say this.
OTHERMALE:The FBI wants me.
LEADMALE:What?
OTHERFEMALE:The FBI?
LEADMALE:Really? Could you put in a good word for me? I'm thinking of applying.
LEADMALE:She means they're after her, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:She's a fugitive.
LEADMALE:We're harboring a fugitive? Look, no offense, Marge, but I'm not going to prison over this.
SUPFEMALE:No way am I sharing a cell with a woman called Big Mama.
SUPFEMALE:Marge, I don't understand.
LEADMALE:What do they want you for? Take your pick.
LEADFEMALE:I helped a bunch of migrant workers bust out of an internment camp broke into some federal buildings, shredded a few files made life pretty damn difficult for the South African Embassy back East.
LEADMALE:Man, and I thought I was doing my part by going to Spike Lee movies.
LEADFEMALE:Does the government know where you are? They probably know I'm in the area and they're checking out everybody I know.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's cool, Marge.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna stand right behind you.
LEADFEMALE:Right? Marge, you know we love you, but we've got a family to think about.
SUPMALE:Why don't you give us some time to think this over? I understand.
LEADMALE:Marge.
OTHERMALE:We're behind you 200%.
LEADMALE:Peace.
LEADFEMALE:Operator, get me the FBI.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, what are you doing, man? Come on, Will.
SUPMALE:We're harboring a fugitive.
LEADFEMALE:She's not a fugitive, she's our friend.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And ever since she got here my diary has been a lot more interesting.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I agree, Ashley's diary is a lot more interesting.
LEADFEMALE:But it's not worth going to jail over.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that is enough, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Your mother and I will handle this.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to sound paranoid but do we really know if Mom and Dad are who they say they are? Or if their names are really Mom and Dad? Gentlemen, we all agree that Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Knotts' dismissal is wrong but we have the rights to redress our grievances which is why I urge you to sign this petition.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes a man has to be willing to put his name on the line for what he believes in.
LEADFEMALE:"Ricky Ricardo"? "Lucy, you got some explaining to do.
LEADFEMALE:" Hey, look, fellas.
LEADMALE:There ain't no point in trying to reason with The Man when The Man is not trying to reason with you.
LEADFEMALE:Right on.
SUPMALE:What we gotta do is get up in his grill
SUPFEMALE:and show him that we got the power.
LEADMALE:Yes! Power to the people.
LEADFEMALE:Say it loud.
LEADMALE:I'm Black and I'm proud! All right.
LEADMALE:My man Cornflake got the spirit.
LEADMALE:He's a little confused, but he's got the spirit.
OTHERMALE:Hey, look, what we got to do is take over this classroom.
LEADMALE:We gotta nail that door shut, and we gotta chain ourselves together to show them that we mean business, each and every one of us.
SUPFEMALE:Now y'all with me? Will, I think I speak for all of us when I say let's get the hell out of here.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Will.
SUPMALE:They'll never take us alive.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, calm down, man.
SUPFEMALE:I already bought my suit for the prom.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, what we gotta do is nail that door shut.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call the handyman.
LEADMALE:Come on, man, we're radicals.
SUPFEMALE:We gotta do things for ourself.
LEADMALE:You're right, my brother.
LEADMALE:Where are the safety goggles? Man, my butler forgot to pack them.
LEADMALE:Here, here you go.
LEADMALE:Here, man, it's easy.
SUPFEMALE:It's like this.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, you all right, man?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'm just hyperventilating.
LEADMALE:This is so exciting.
LEADMALE:We're like The Mod Squad, without Julie.
LEADMALE:Well, this ought to show them we mean business.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Will?
SUPFEMALE:Yo? What do we do now? We chant.
LEADMALE:Attica! Man, you smell that? Damn, it's chimichanga day in the cafeteria.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Marge, you should have seen me.
SUPFEMALE:It was dope.
LEADMALE:Me and my man Cornflake barricaded ourself in Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Knotts' classroom, right? It took the whole football team to break down the door and when they came in, we was chanting, "Make love, not war.
SUPMALE:" Right on, Hasani, but why were you chanting "Make love, not war?" We was kind of hoping the cheerleaders would overhear.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, this is not a joke.
SUPMALE:Now, your antics got you suspended for three days.
LEADMALE:Now go to your room.
SUPMALE:Looks like I've had quite an impact on your kids.
LEADMALE:You're proud of getting a high school kid suspended? If you mean, am I proud to have told him to do anything you have to for what you believe in then, yes, I am.
SUPMALE:Marge, when you talked to Will about when we chained ourselves together at sit-ins, you're only giving him the romantic part of the struggle.
LEADFEMALE:Girlfriend, you are leaving out everything that went before it.
LEADFEMALE:The leaflets, the petitions, the years of trying to work through the system.
LEADFEMALE:If the system doesn't work, you have to blow the door down.
OTHERFEMALE:Looks like you forgot that.
LEADMALE:You talk as if I wasn't there with you in Birmingham facing dogs and fire hoses.
LEADFEMALE:This is me, Olifami.
SUPFEMALE:The same Olifami that was with you the night Harlem went up in flames.
LEADMALE:But now I have a family and I choose not to fight in the streets.
SUPMALE:I have an office to fight from and I have fought and won cases for fair housing, affirmative action health care and I am not ashamed to write a big fat check for something I believe in and that doesn't make me any less committed than you.
SUPMALE:So don't you dare look down your damn nose at me, Adibola.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I've overstayed my welcome.
LEADMALE:Marge you are welcome to stay here until you can figure out where you want to go.
LEADMALE:But if you ever want to stop running Viv and I will be here for you.
LEADMALE:Marge.
SUPFEMALE:Where Uncle Olifami? He's in the study with Adisimbol.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, good thing he ain't in here.
LEADMALE:Because if he was I might just have to run back up to my room.
SUPFEMALE:What you doing? Now that The Man's after me, I think it's best for me to split.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, you know, you got to get back to your work.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I heard that there was an anti-apartheid rally in D.
LEADFEMALE:C.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I may swing by.
SUPMALE:I knew you'd understand, Will.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:So I'll be ready in about 10 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:For what?
LEADFEMALE:Yo, I'm gonna go with you.
SUPFEMALE:Man, if we gonna be underground, though, I'll probably need another name.
LEADMALE:How about, Akbar Shabash Jenkins? Will, you're a kid.
LEADMALE:You belong at home.
LEADFEMALE:You're only 17.
LEADFEMALE:By the time you were 17, you burned your first bra.
SUPFEMALE:Baby, you can't do what I did.
LEADMALE:But I could go get one of Hilary's.
OTHERFEMALE:What I mean is, you have to find your own way, Will.
LEADMALE:You know, when I was your age there weren't many doors open to us.
LEADMALE:Some of them we had to blow open, and because we did you've got more opportunities.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get me wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I am not saying that things are perfect.
OTHERFEMALE:It's just that now you can fight our battles in the boardrooms, too.
SUPMALE:And in the classrooms, the voting booths, and the courtroom.
OTHERMALE:Just like your uncle.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, hold it.
SUPFEMALE:I thought you said "by any means necessary.
SUPFEMALE:" Right, but it's up to you to figure out what's necessary.
SUPMALE:And, Will, when the courtroom doesn't work, come find me.
LEADMALE:You're a deep sister, Adibola.
SUPMALE:And you are the future, Hasani.
LEADFEMALE:Agent Marcus Collins of the FBI.
OTHERFEMALE:If you need me, I'll be upstairs saluting the flag.
LEADMALE:Philip Banks, my wife, Vivian.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:How do you do? I understand you're acquainted with a woman named Margaret Smallwood? I have reason to believe she's been in contact with you, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Really? What would that reason be? We tap every Black person's phone in the United States of America.
SUPMALE:Just a little FBI humor.
LEADFEMALE:But seriously, folks, harboring a fugitive can have grave repercussions.
LEADFEMALE:Marjorie Smallwood is a very close personal friend of mine.
LEADMALE:I consider myself privileged to know her.
LEADFEMALE:She was here, but she left some time this afternoon.
LEADMALE:Do you have any idea where she was headed? As a matter of fact, she said she was going to a nuclear power plant in Texas.
LEADMALE:But then again, she did mention a migrant workers' camp in Salinas.
LEADMALE:No, honey, she said she was going to a voters' registration drive in Biloxi.
LEADMALE:Well, I thought she was just going to Saks.
SUPMALE:Get the heck out of here.
LEADMALE:You all mean she ain't in the bathroom? I must say, I'm disappointed in you, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:I would have thought a man in your position would be more aware of his responsibilities.
OTHERMALE:I know exactly what my responsibilities are.
SUPFEMALE:Son, would you show Agent Collins to the door? By the way, I don't think we've met.
LEADMALE:Ricky Ricardo.
LEADMALE:Yo, Hil, check out my horoscope.
LEADFEMALE:"You will become a famous rapper with your own TV show.
LEADFEMALE:" That's dope, right? Those things are ridiculous.
OTHERFEMALE:What does mine say? It says, "You are headed for a fall.
LEADMALE:Beware.
OTHERMALE:Accidents can happen.
LEADFEMALE:" Those things are so stupid.
LEADMALE:I wonder what I'll call my TV show?
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Fry, Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:Fry, Geoffrey.
OTHERFEMALE:Having breakfast with Rico Suave? No, Mom and Robert sent me this from the time they was in Mexico.
SUPMALE:That looks just like the hat you gave me for my birthday.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, G.
LEADMALE:I'll have it back in your room in an hour, man.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, would you put these in a vase for me please? Yes, madam.
LEADFEMALE:I got all of Vy's favorite 
LEADFEMALE:Pineapple juice, brownies
SUPFEMALE:How did this Playboy get in here?
LEADMALE:I bought it.
SUPMALE:It's a special legal edition.
LEADFEMALE:The centerfold wants to be a Supreme Court Justice.
LEADMALE:I had the hardest time deciding what to wear to meet Aunt Vy's new boyfriend.
SUPMALE:I've never known anyone in construction.
LEADFEMALE:Except for that guy in the Village People.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, his daughter can sleep in my room, but if she touches my stuff I'm stuffing her in the clothes hamper.
SUPFEMALE:What? It's not like Hilary never did it.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I am so excited.
SUPMALE:This is the first time Vy's brought anybody home to meet the family.
SUPMALE:Could be serious.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:Not with my mom.
SUPMALE:All she's trying to do is get to her retirement plan and her rocking chair.
OTHERMALE:Is that why she's moonwalking up the driveway? Divas! Look at you, baby!
LEADFEMALE:Hey, your complexion has cleared up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mom.
SUPMALE:So did yours.
SUPMALE:Hey, you must be Robert.
LEADFEMALE:You're funny.
SUPFEMALE:You must be Carlton.
SUPMALE:Well, no, you see, actually, Carlton is the funny-looking one over there.
LEADMALE:See, I'm Will.
OTHERFEMALE:But you can just call me Your Majesty.
LEADFEMALE:I may be small, but I'm not ignorant.
OTHERMALE:Everyone, this is Robert's daughter, Claudia.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Hi, Claudia, I'm Hilary.
SUPMALE:Hi, Hilary.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God! Isn't she the cutest little thing you've ever seen? Not really.
SUPMALE:And I would like for you to meet Robert.
SUPFEMALE:And isn't he the biggest hunk you've ever seen? Not really.
SUPFEMALE:Where is Vy? Breakfast is getting cold.
LEADFEMALE:Knowing Vy, she's upstairs freshening up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Not my mom.
LEADFEMALE:First thing she does when she gets anywhere is she kicks off her shoes rolls her hair up into one of them twist joints and goes and puts on one of my big old sweat suits.
LEADMALE:Sorry, everybody, I just had to freshen up a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:You like my new pearls, Will? Yeah, but they would probably look better with one of my big old sweat suits.
OTHERMALE:You can borrow them anytime, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, Mom, hold up.
LEADMALE:I put your favorite breakfast together for you.
LEADMALE:It's waffles with boysenberry syrup eggs, extra-runny and sausage, extra-burnt.
SUPMALE:Thank you, baby, but I'm eating lighter these days.
LEADMALE:You want half my melon? Oh, baby, you know me like the back of your hand.
LEADFEMALE:But I need some juice.
SUPMALE:Anybody else want anything while I'm up? Hey, as long as I'm around, you're not lifting a finger.
SUPFEMALE:May I? Philip? I feel a little thirsty, too.
LEADFEMALE:Robert? Do you mind getting Vivian something to drink while you're up there? And toss me a Pudding Pop.
OTHERMALE:The refrigerator doesn't open right.
LEADMALE:You mind if I take a look at it? Be my guest, but the repairman said we had to order some new door hinges.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, hold up, Robert.
OTHERFEMALE:I can take care of that.
SUPMALE:Hey, G, I'm gonna need a screwdriver, a wrench, a T square and about a week off from school.
SUPFEMALE:All done.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:It's just gonna break again in 20 years.
SUPMALE:Robert can fix anything.
SUPFEMALE:He's in construction.
SUPMALE:Tell them, baby.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in construction.
SUPMALE:But keep your fingers crossed.
OTHERMALE:He's working on this big deal with the government and he's expecting to hear from them any day.
LEADFEMALE:If the deal goes through, he'll be his own boss.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, I'm working on a big deal.
LEADFEMALE:You know, down at the restaurant where I work? I'm about to be promoted to vice president in charge of keeping bums out of the entryway.
LEADFEMALE:So, Robert, you know how to fix a broken dish?
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:You got any superglue?
LEADMALE:I was talking about our satellite dish.
LEADFEMALE:So am I.
LEADMALE:Well Sweetie, why don't you show Claudia our back yard? Well, why? It's hot, it's smoggy and plus, I won't be able to hear nothing y'all are saying.
LEADMALE:That's the point, big guy.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:So, did he pop the question?
LEADMALE:Ashley, honey, where are your manners?
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERMALE:Did he pop the question, please?
SUPMALE:Not yet.
LEADFEMALE:But he's planning on building this dream house and he did mention his-and-hers sinks.
SUPFEMALE:Let the maids worry about the sinks.
SUPFEMALE:What does he drive? The important question is, does his mother like you?
SUPMALE:She's dead.
LEADFEMALE:Girlfriend, you in.
SUPFEMALE:I like your bracelet.
LEADFEMALE:I bet it would look very cute on my little wrist.
LEADMALE:Sorry, a friend gave this to me.
SUPFEMALE:That's cool.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not down with O.
LEADMALE:P.
SUPMALE:P.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna see some pictures?
OTHERMALE:Yeah, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, that's you and my mom.
SUPMALE:My dad took it in the back yard.
SUPMALE:We were having a barbecue.
OTHERFEMALE:Claudia, now, after this barbecue you know, you guys had the junk and all the stuff in your teeth.
SUPMALE:Did my mom have to go home to use her toothbrush or did she already have one there? She used dental floss.
OTHERMALE:Okay, is my mom over your house more during Good Morning America or Arsenio? Or, is she like there for Arsenio and then still there for Good Morning America? Are you trying to trick me to find out how serious they are? So, what, you think they're pretty serious? Will, I know how you feel.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, I've been there.
LEADMALE:Let's face 
OTHERMALE:Those two kids are nuts about each other.
SUPMALE:My brother, it's time you wake up and smell the Play-Doh.
LEADMALE:Hi, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Mom! You half-naked! Come on, you don't want Robert to get the wrong idea.
LEADMALE:You damn straight! You don't think I'm doing these butt-busters for my health? Okay, that's it, young lady.
LEADMALE:You go to your room in Philly.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, hush up and help me move this table.
LEADMALE:Can we get started? I feel a little bloated.
LEADMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold up, Mom.
SUPMALE:How you gonna play me? Why you ain't hook me up with one of them pink jumpies? I couldn't find one with a fly.
LEADMALE:And one, and two, and three, and four Man, Jane Fonda got a butt like Arsenio.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, I could do that if I had the right outfit.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe not.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to have kids one day.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, man, what's up? Oh, man, you caught me.
LEADFEMALE:I was trying to surprise you.
OTHERFEMALE:When you say "surprise," you don't mean like "I'm driving down a big hill, and all of a 
LEADMALE:"Surprise! My brakes don't work"? You got the same sense of humor as your mom, you know that? Now, don't be trying to distract me.
LEADFEMALE:What you doing to my ride? Hey, your mom and I borrowed the car.
LEADFEMALE:I saw you needed a water pump, so I picked one up.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, that's pretty decent of you, man.
OTHERMALE:You need some help?
OTHERFEMALE:Nope.
LEADFEMALE:All done.
SUPFEMALE:She'll purr like a kitten.
LEADFEMALE:My grandpa taught me how to fix cars.
SUPFEMALE:That's fascinating.
SUPFEMALE:Where'd you meet my mom?
LEADFEMALE:She picked me up in a bar.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, man! It was an oyster bar.
LEADMALE:You see, I was a little shy, so Luckily, she came up and she talked to me.
LEADMALE:So, what'd she talk about?
LEADFEMALE:You.
LEADFEMALE:Is it true you took your diaper off and ran around Sears naked? You're damn right, and I'd do it again if I had to.
LEADFEMALE:Robert! It's Mr.
OTHERMALE:Karls from the Department of Housing.
LEADFEMALE:I think this is the call, baby! Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:He does have a certain gift for gab.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:I got the job! So what kind of marble do you want for those his-and-hers sinks? Congratulations, Robert.
LEADFEMALE:Landing a government contract is a hell of a deal.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to impart some words that I've always lived 
LEADFEMALE:Mo' money, mo' money, mo' money.
LEADMALE:That's beautiful, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:I have to admit, success is sweet.
LEADFEMALE:But having three beautiful women to share it with makes it even sweeter.
SUPMALE:Especially when they're triplets.
OTHERMALE:I'll get the munchies.
LEADMALE:Hey, congratulations, Robert.
SUPMALE:It's nice to hear you gonna have some money now.
SUPMALE:I guess them old girlfriends gonna be coming out of the woodworks, huh? Actually, your mother's the only woman I've dated since my divorce.
LEADFEMALE:That is so sweet! Isn't it, Philip? Philip? I'm sorry, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:I was looking for some beer nuts.
SUPMALE:Philip, I feel pretty lucky.
SUPMALE:How about that tennis game you promised me? You got it.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, no jumping over the net.
SUPFEMALE:This is such a big night for Robert.
SUPMALE:I wanna make him a special dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, save the rice.
SUPMALE:You'll be needing it for the wedding.
LEADFEMALE:What? Whoa, come on.
OTHERMALE:Mom, now look, I didn't want to bring this up, but I was standing behind Robert in the mirror Dude ain't got no reflection! Stop fooling around.
OTHERMALE:I really wanna fix Robert something special.
LEADFEMALE:What should I make?
SUPMALE:How about reservations? Hey, what about Will's favorite dish? It's not every day he gets to have his mom prepare him a home-cooked meal.
LEADMALE:You know, Carlton, you're right.
LEADMALE:So, what would my son like for dinner?
LEADMALE:I feel like something exotic.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:How about Lebanese? You think Robert will mind swinging by Beirut? I'm sorry, Geoffrey, you better reheat the asparagus.
SUPFEMALE:Will's still not here.
LEADFEMALE:So, how's the chicken holding up? I'm afraid it's drier than happy hour at the Betty Ford Center, madam.
SUPFEMALE:I cannot believe Will is acting like this.
LEADFEMALE:Did I do something? Maybe it was a mistake bringing Robert and Claudia here.
LEADFEMALE:Vy, honey, don't be so hard on yourself.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure there's a good reason, and it has nothing to do with you and Robert.
OTHERMALE:Mom, we're starved.
LEADMALE:And Claudia's being selfish with her Pez.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, you just have to know how to ask.
LEADMALE:Now can I have Barbie's head back? Listen, Will's not gonna show up.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you kids just go ahead on and eat?
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:The Willster must be feeling pretty low to pull a stunt like this.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't seen him this upset since someone told him he looked like me.
SUPMALE:He's just hard-headed! I don't know where he gets it from.
LEADFEMALE:I 
LEADFEMALE:He gets it from you.
LEADMALE:I am the understanding sister.
OTHERFEMALE:Helen is the loud one, Janice is the flighty one and you are the hard-headed one.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought I was the sweet one.
OTHERMALE:You said you were the sweet one.
OTHERFEMALE:When we tried to tell you you weren't you wouldn't listen because you're too hard-headed.
LEADFEMALE:As much as I enjoy these wonderful walks down memory lane, I'm pooped.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Look, why don't we try to enjoy what's left of dinner? Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:How can you eat at a time like this? Vivian, I can't get this out of my mind.
LEADFEMALE:How can you say that I am hard-headed? Gee, Vy, I don't know where I could have gotten that idea.
SUPFEMALE:Will, thank God I found you.
LEADMALE:Carlton, how did you know I was down here? Did my mom send you down here to get me? No.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:I snuck out.
LEADMALE:I was worried about you.
LEADMALE:Well, as you can see, I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you don't have to hide behind that macho exterior with me.
SUPFEMALE:I see your frightened inner child and I'm here to say come out and play.
LEADMALE:You been watching too much Oprah, man.
LEADFEMALE:You can never watch too much Oprah.
LEADMALE:If it wasn't for her show, I'd still be in denial about my drinking.
OTHERMALE:Will, look, I know how you feel about Robert but you're not the only one who gets jealous.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you think I felt when you moved in?
LEADMALE:What, you was jealous of me?
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:You're tall you're good at basketball, the babes love you.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, none of that will help you in the corporate world, but for the next year or so you're sitting pretty.
SUPFEMALE:It was real nice of you to come down here, man.
LEADMALE:You ain't seeing my girlfriend or nothing, are you? Will, I just want you to know if your mom abandons you and gets married you'll always have me.
SUPMALE:Because well, you're like the brother I've always wanted.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:For not hugging you, right? No, you know, for saying that I'm like the brother that you always wanted.
OTHERFEMALE:And for not hugging me, man.
OTHERMALE:Robert, I'm sorry, this hasn't turned out to be much of a celebration.
SUPFEMALE:Vy, I'm the one that should apologize.
LEADMALE:It was all my fault.
SUPMALE:I was so eager for Will to like me, I came on too strong.
OTHERMALE:So, how was dinner? Any leftovers? Where the hell have you been? Boy, time flies when you're running up to your bedroom.
SUPFEMALE:I'm right behind you, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I'm surprised you even noticed I was gone, what with your man here, and all.
LEADMALE:Don't you use that tone of walk with me.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you sit your butt down before I sit it down for you.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, but I'm picking my own chair.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, sit down.
OTHERMALE:What a coincidence.
OTHERMALE:That's the one I was going to pick.
LEADMALE:William, you have ruined what was supposed to be a very special evening.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, you ruined what was supposed to be a very special visit.
OTHERFEMALE:It ain't like I get to see you all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Why you have to bring them, anyway? I brought them because they're important to me and I wanted them to meet the most important person in my life.
SUPMALE:Mom, did you ever think about what I wanted? I mean, "Robert's my man.
LEADMALE:Claudia's so adorable.
LEADMALE:" You went off and started a whole new family without me.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, don't you know there is no family without you? Nobody can take your place.
LEADMALE:I'm your mother.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm human, honey, I have needs, too.
OTHERMALE:Do you expect me to be alone forever? Yeah.
LEADMALE:I mean, you done good this far.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're being very immature.
LEADMALE:Am not.
LEADFEMALE:You're the only parent I got, and I don't want to share you.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'm sorry, baby, that is not your decision.
OTHERMALE:Will, listen, I am not with Robert because he makes you feel bad.
LEADMALE:I'm with him because he makes me feel good.
LEADFEMALE:You're my son, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, I care about you but I have got to live my own life.
LEADMALE:Now, you can ruin what's left of this trip or you can make it work.
SUPMALE:It's up to you.
OTHERFEMALE:But, that's all that's up to you.
LEADMALE:Hi, Will!
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Claudia.
LEADMALE:You know, Will, there are a lot of advantages to our parents getting together.
LEADMALE:The guilt alone will get us both ponies.
SUPMALE:Well, no, I'm not into using guilt for my personal gain.
OTHERFEMALE:Temper tantrums.
SUPMALE:That's where the money is.
LEADFEMALE:You slay me, Will.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Will, you would make a great brother.
LEADMALE:I'm not so bad, either.
LEADFEMALE:When you take me to the parks with you, I can attract more babes than a puppy.
OTHERMALE:What time is your flight? I hate saying goodbye to you, Vy, it's the only time I cry.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding, child? You cry more than Richard Simmons.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks for the hospitality.
LEADFEMALE:Our pleasure.
OTHERFEMALE:Just be sure you take care of Vy.
SUPFEMALE:Robert, hold up, man.
SUPMALE:I just wanted to apologize for messing up your celebration.
LEADMALE:Next time you come out, dinner on me?
SUPMALE:I appreciate it, man.
LEADMALE:I'll be right there.
LEADFEMALE:I guess this is goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it is.
SUPFEMALE:He's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you all right, too.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, you are the greatest son a mom ever had.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna miss you, Claudia.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna miss you, too.
LEADMALE:Thanks for letting me polish your shoes hang up your clothes, and vacuum your room.
SUPMALE:It was really fun playing Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:What? It's not like Hilary never did it.
LEADMALE:Come on, Claudia.
SUPMALE:Bye, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, hold up, Claudia.
LEADMALE:I think you're forgetting something.
SUPFEMALE:But your friend gave it to you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but you're a better friend.
OTHERFEMALE:And besides, you can spy on my mom for me.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to impart some words that I've always lived 
SUPMALE:Mo' money, mo' money I'd like to impart some words that I've always lived by Trying to be a professional here! 
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Will, a deal's a deal.
LEADFEMALE:You picked the movie, I pick the restaurant.
OTHERMALE:Please, man.
SUPMALE:This ain't no restaurant.
LEADMALE:I mean, there wasn't even no golden arches outside.
SUPFEMALE:Will, please.
SUPMALE:You're this far from washing windshields with newspaper.
LEADFEMALE:Now, just sit down and try to go a half-hour without saying "yo.
LEADMALE:" Yo, yo, yo.
LEADMALE:I'll have two of those.

LEADMALE:You always get to be the rap star.
LEADFEMALE:This time I'll be the rap star and you be Gary Coleman.

SUPFEMALE:So, how would you ladies like to spend an evening in Tiny's Bel-Air mansion?
LEADFEMALE:Monique, he has a mansion.
SUPFEMALE:A big one.
LEADFEMALE:A tennis court, swimming pool, excellent school system.
SUPMALE:How about tomorrow night? We're only going to be in LA for four days.
SUPMALE:Excuse us for just one sec.
LEADMALE:Yo, when are Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv going out of town? Tomorrow through Monday.
SUPMALE:But what do we do about Hilary and Ashley? Lie? Oh, no, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, they're family.
LEADFEMALE:We bribe them.
LEADMALE:Yeah, tomorrow night will be perfect.
LEADFEMALE:Separate checks, please.
LEADFEMALE:Tomorrow we go French.
SUPMALE:But tonight we go Dutch.
LEADMALE:Game plan for tonight, Will.
OTHERMALE:As soon as the parental units are out of the house we pick the girls up at the hotel.
SUPFEMALE:Then, we ply them with Perrier to get them in the mood.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Carlton, they're French girls.
LEADFEMALE:They're always in the mood.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know the French word for foreplay? Because there isn't one.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, sweetheart, I am counting on you to take care of your sister while your father and I are at the jazz festival.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:But last time I squealed on Hilary I found Barbie face down in the aquarium.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, boy.
LEADFEMALE:You kids and your music.
OTHERFEMALE:When I was young, lyrics meant something.
LEADFEMALE:I was scatting, Will.
SUPFEMALE:That's the most expressive form of singing.
LEADFEMALE:For example Vivian, gonna be late Vivian, gonna be late All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary, honey, here's the number where your father and I are going to be staying at the hotel.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I am ready.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Wait! I forgot my purse.
LEADFEMALE:Has anybody seen my old brown bag? Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:You used to call me Diva.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Vivian.
LEADMALE:Well, what a wonderful surprise! I'll put these in the guest room.
SUPMALE:So this is what a hernia feels like.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Bobby's visiting Lester's parents for the weekend so I decided to take a little trip.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you know I'm always doing things on the spur on the moment.
LEADMALE:Buy a new hat, paint the house, get a divorce.
SUPMALE:Not again.
LEADMALE:This time he's gone too far.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, does Uncle Lester still do that "pull my finger" thing in church? I don't want to talk about it.
SUPMALE:Not in front of the young one.
LEADFEMALE:That means it's about sex.
OTHERMALE:Either Uncle Lester is seeing another woman or becoming one.
LEADMALE:Ashley, don't be ridiculous.
LEADMALE:And no more Oprah.
LEADFEMALE:Shoot! And it's transvestite week.
SUPMALE:I'm afraid Ashley's right.
OTHERMALE:I think Lester's messing around.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I just need a place to stay for a while.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, Aunt Helen, that's cool.
OTHERFEMALE:You can have my room.
OTHERMALE:In Philly.
LEADMALE:Will, don't be so insensitive.
LEADFEMALE:You're staying at the Howard Johnson's, and I won't take no for an answer.
OTHERMALE:Boys, knock it off.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, we cannot go to San Francisco.
LEADMALE:Now, don't be canceling anything because of me.
LEADMALE:I'll be fine.
SUPMALE:You heard what she said.
OTHERMALE:She'll be fine.
SUPMALE:Let's go, Vivian.
LEADMALE:I am not leaving at a time like this.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, sweetie, I'll help you unpack.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:What about our date? This is so unfair.
LEADFEMALE:You're telling me? I stayed up all night learning the French for "Forget about my cousin, y'all can both have me.
OTHERFEMALE:"
SUPMALE:Sweetheart, I feel so bad about this.
LEADMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:You poor thing.
SUPFEMALE:You know what? I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna buy something really nice.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sweetie, that's all right.
LEADMALE:You don't have to buy me anything.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I meant for me.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you know, all married couples go through rough times.
LEADMALE:But maybe if you just talk to Lester
SUPMALE:Talk to him? Girl, I wouldn't give Lester air if he was in a jug.
LEADMALE:Well, sweetheart, I don't mean to pry and you don't have to give me all the gory details, but Vivian, I told you.
SUPMALE:There is another woman in his life, and I don't mean his ugly mama.
OTHERMALE:But Lester is crazy about you.
LEADFEMALE:Was.
LEADMALE:Now he's just crazy.
LEADMALE:You know how some men are animals in bed? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't.
SUPMALE:Well, I know how that goes.
SUPFEMALE:One day last month, I met Philip at the door wearing nothing, honey, but Saran Wrap and a smile.
SUPMALE:Walked right past me and said, "Hi, honey, did you make that meatloaf?" Well, at least he spoke.
LEADMALE:Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, last night I followed Lester.
LEADMALE:He drove over to this cute little house with this cute little picket fence and this cute little homewrecker opened the door.
SUPFEMALE:I would have been reaching for my cute little crowbar.
LEADMALE:I couldn't find it.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, she let him in and he stayed.
SUPFEMALE:For how long? Let's just say I got tired of waiting.
LEADFEMALE:Look, mesdemoiselles, un petit change of plans for tonight.
LEADMALE:Instead of you coming over here, we're going to rendezvous at your hotel.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:But, please, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Baby, listen.
LEADMALE:Can I talk for a second, baby? It's just that, you know, somebody kind of dropped by the mansion you know, unexpectedly, you know.
LEADMALE:So we
LEADFEMALE:Who dropped by?
LEADMALE:Aunt Helen.
SUPFEMALE:What? No.
LEADMALE:You thought he said Aunt Helen? No, no.
LEADMALE:He said Van Halen.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not to worry, my little chocolate truffles.
OTHERFEMALE:You can come by tomorrow night.
LEADFEMALE:Prince and Hammer are coming by to play Yahtzee.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry, gotta go.
SUPFEMALE:Barry White's here.
SUPMALE:It's 7:15.
LEADMALE:Right now, Bobby McFerrin is performing.
LEADFEMALE:I love Bobby McFerrin.
LEADFEMALE:Not as much as we love French Toast.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, call me optimistic but I'm sure you'll still make it to the jazz festival.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Helen's probably blown this whole thing out of proportion.
SUPFEMALE:You're probably right.
LEADMALE:Smith women tend to do that.
LEADMALE:I remember one day I came home from work after a really rough time.
LEADFEMALE:I think we were having meatloaf for dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, your Aunt Vivian was really furious at me because I forgot to mention her dress, or Oh, my God! Vivian! Tomorrow on Geraldo, French women who can't say "no.
LEADFEMALE:" It's not fair, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Monique is everything I've ever wanted in a woman.
SUPMALE:Beautiful, sexy, and she measures everything in centimeters.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, man, all I know is if we don't get this house cleared out by tonight the only sweet things we gonna be near is a couple Klondike bars.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, sweetheart, come here, please.
SUPMALE:Hurry.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:There is no more Saran Wrap and Baggies are out of the question.
LEADMALE:No, sweetheart, it's not that.
OTHERMALE:Helen, could you come in here please? Now, listen.
LEADMALE:I made some phone calls and I managed to scare up an extra ticket to the jazz festival.
LEADMALE:So we can all go.
LEADMALE:Me, you and Helen.
LEADMALE:I love you, Uncle Phil! I'll get the bags and the car.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, I'll carry you there if I have to.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Lewis, but you have a visitor.
LEADFEMALE:Me? Who is it?
LEADMALE:Your husband, Mr.
LEADMALE:Lewis.
LEADMALE:Sir, I hope you brought your protective cup.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetie pie, get your bags.
SUPMALE:The taxi's waiting.
LEADMALE:Would someone please inform Action Jackson over there that I'm not going anywhere with him? But, Helen, you're my wife.
LEADMALE:If you refuse to leave with me you know what I'm gonna have to do.
LEADFEMALE:Drag her home by her extensions? Nope.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna stay right here with you until you change your mind.
LEADMALE:Good old Aunt Jemima.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, that's a strong woman.
OTHERMALE:I never saw her with a man.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I hear that she and the Quaker Oats dude got kind of a Jungle Fever thing going.
LEADMALE:Good morning, everybody.
OTHERMALE:Good morning, Lester.
LEADFEMALE:I just lost my appetite.
SUPMALE:Helen, please.
LEADMALE:All right, I'll stay, but I'm not talking to him.
SUPFEMALE:Not after what he did.
LEADMALE:Baby, I know things aren't going perfect, but why did you leave me? Was it because I left my wet underwear hanging on your wig stand? Wrong, but an interesting concept.
LEADMALE:Then what was it? The time I took that picture of you on the toilet? That's it.
LEADFEMALE:I am never getting married.
SUPFEMALE:Lester, perhaps you'd like to continue this conversation in private.
LEADFEMALE:How about if you continued it at home? I'll get your bags.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what? In fact, forget your bags, we'll mail them to you.
LEADMALE:Just go, you crazy kids in love.
SUPMALE:I apologize.
LEADMALE:This is no way for civilized people to behave in someone else's home.
SUPFEMALE:No need to, Helen.
LEADMALE:It won't happen again.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, shall we just enjoy the rest of Geoffrey's meal? Amen to that.
LEADMALE:Hilary, would you please ask the adulterer on your right to pass the biscuits? What? Dr.
LEADMALE:Connors, please.
LEADFEMALE:It's her patient, Lester.
LEADMALE:No, not Lester the schizophrenic, Lester the impotent guy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'll hold.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Anita.
SUPFEMALE:It's me, Lester.
OTHERFEMALE:Helen's driving me crazy.
SUPFEMALE:I needed to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:No, I didn't tell her about you.
LEADFEMALE:And I think seeing you was a mistake.
LEADMALE:I mean, I really like you, and you're really good at what you do but there's part of me that would prefer a man.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I guess you're right.
LEADMALE:It's not about you.
LEADMALE:It's about me and Helen and Look, maybe now isn't such a good time to talk.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:How you trying to play my aunt, man? Oh, that's it.
SUPMALE:I'm feeling froggy.
OTHERMALE:I'm about to leap.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, but, hold up.
LEADFEMALE:Would you really prefer a man?
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Back up, man.
LEADMALE:You think Wait.
LEADMALE:Anita's my psychiatrist, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, right.

LEADFEMALE:Will, cover your ears.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, ma'am.
LEADMALE:How could you think I was even seeing another woman? Well, you know what they say.
LEADMALE:If the rooster ain't crowing in the henhouse he must be cock-a-doodling in the barn.

LEADMALE:Great, Daddy.
LEADMALE:They're all dogs, got it? Have a good time, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, you hit me in my stomach with this thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Had it been Carlton, you could've put his eye out.

OTHERMALE:I've already kissed him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:I mean, on the lips.
SUPFEMALE:So do I.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I need to know everything you know about sex.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ashley.
LEADMALE:Don't you think sex is something you should discuss with Aunt Viv? You know, like, over a cup of General Foods International Coffee? Look, I mean, it's hard enough for me to accept the fact that Mom and Dad even did it.
LEADMALE:I don't want to talk about it with them.
OTHERFEMALE:Besides, we've already discussed all the technical stuff.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I know all about eggs, fallopian tubes Am I gonna have to wash your mouth out with soap, young lady? Will, grow up.
OTHERMALE:I'm old enough to marry Jerry Lee Lewis.
SUPMALE:Look, if Mom and Dad knew about all these weird feelings I'm starting to have, they'd freak.
SUPFEMALE:Promise not to tell them?
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:But I want you to stop having these feelings.
LEADMALE:You don't want to be that kind of girl.
SUPMALE:You mean the kind you like? What is this? The Spanish Inquisition? Look, Will, when a girl doesn't fool around you never call her back.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a reason for that, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Not one I'm proud of, but there's a reason for that.
LEADFEMALE:It's 'cause there's nothing to remember.
SUPFEMALE:Now, how come it's okay for you and not for me? Look, it's just Look, well Look, I can't answer all these questions, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:And I thought you were the one person who would understand.
LEADFEMALE:I do understand, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's just that I just need a little time to get prepared, all right? But I thought you knew everything about sex.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well Look, I just, you know I just want to make sure there haven't been any new developments, you know in the last day or so.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Hey, thanks a lot for helping me, Will.
SUPMALE:I'm so excited! Will you stop talking dirty?
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Is Ashley ready?
SUPMALE:No, man.
OTHERFEMALE:She's only 13!
LEADMALE:Hi, Kevin.
LEADMALE:Hi, Ashley.
SUPMALE:So, you wanna go watch some TV now?

LEADMALE:Come on, kids, have a seat.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's watch some TV.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Couple number two.
LEADFEMALE:Where's the most unusual place you've ever made whoopee? Boy, that was good.
SUPMALE:Hey, how about some music? I wanna sex you up Filth.
SUPMALE:I like that song.
LEADMALE:You would.
OTHERFEMALE:You men disgust me.
LEADMALE:Hey, there's my favorite cousin.
LEADFEMALE:Come over here and have a seat with us.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, move over, man.
LEADMALE:Will, I'm late to pick up Dora.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Now wouldn't you much rather spend time with us playing a nice sweet game of Duck-Duck-Goose? Dora can tie a slipknot with her tongue.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Who ate all the whipped cream? Is there no end to you people's preoccupation with sex? Somebody's girlfriend got grounded again? May I please speak to the two of you in the kitchen? Right now? It's Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Now, look, you can't tell Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:But she asked me to tell her about sex.
LEADMALE:I don't know what to tell her.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, she should hear it from somebody more experienced.
LEADMALE:Well, pardon me for being attractive.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm the wrong person.
LEADMALE:I mean, I tried to tell Carlton about sex And, well, you know the rest.
SUPMALE:Look, well, somebody has to tell her.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, she won't do anything stupid if she has some good solid facts.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong, my hot-blooded cousin.
LEADFEMALE:If you tell her about sex, she's just gonna run out and do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's ridiculous, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:We wanna expose her to a realistic portrayal of relationships.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:We'll rent Pretty Woman.
SUPMALE:Well, here we are to get information for our book report.
LEADMALE:I'm just here to check the place for asbestos.
SUPMALE:This is embarrassing, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you have to drag me down here anyway? Please.
LEADMALE:Look at this face.
LEADFEMALE:You think anybody's gonna believe I have questions about sex? Is there a John Doe and a Joan Crawford? I choked, okay? Present.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Miss Rinkoff.
LEADMALE:I'm one of the counselors here.
LEADFEMALE:Right this way, please.
SUPFEMALE:Shall we step into your office and talk about asbestos? Asbestos? Last I heard, it was called knocking boots.
OTHERMALE:Please, have a seat.
SUPFEMALE:Now, how can I help you? By turning into an old ugly man.
OTHERFEMALE:Boys, there's no reason to be embarrassed about sex.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, we're all adults here.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone has questions about their reproductive organs.
LEADMALE:Must you be so raw? Well, actually, it's about my cousin.
LEADFEMALE:His sister.
LEADFEMALE:She's 13.
SUPFEMALE:Is she pregnant? Hey, that's my sister you're talking about.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry to say it, but that's reality.
LEADFEMALE:These days more and more teenage girls are having sex.
LEADFEMALE:They certainly don't go to our school.
SUPFEMALE:Look, we can't control people's actions but we can help kids make wise choices, not stupid ones.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Here's a pamphlet called The Truth about Sex.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
OTHERMALE:Nope, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:And here's one about the prevention of pregnancy.
SUPFEMALE:Here's one about AIDS.
LEADFEMALE:And here's one about dealing with your emotions.
LEADFEMALE:Sure a lot of stuff to read.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I know.
LEADMALE:That's why I think this is something your parents should be discussing with you and your cousin.
LEADFEMALE:That's not likely with Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:He won't let us watch Snow White 'cause she lives with seven dwarfs.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Not so fast.
LEADMALE:I think it's wonderful you have information for your cousin
LEADMALE:but what about you?
LEADFEMALE:I practice abstinence.
LEADFEMALE:But I think I've got that down and I'm ready to move on.
SUPFEMALE:Will! Hey, check it out.
LEADMALE:Black folks playing tennis.
OTHERFEMALE:I wonder if there's a white guy somewhere tap-dancing.
OTHERMALE:Kids, we found these pamphlets.
OTHERFEMALE:Is there anything anyone here would like to discuss? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Who's pregnant? Hey, not me.
LEADMALE:Not me.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go out on a limb and make that unanimous.
LEADMALE:Now, somebody in this house needs to talk about sex and it ain't one of us.
LEADFEMALE:But that only leaves Oh, God, tell me it's Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's our not-so-little girl.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, kids.
SUPFEMALE:Your father and I need to talk alone.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, just remember that sex is as natural as breathing.
LEADMALE:And I'm gonna hold my breath till I'm married.
LEADFEMALE:I can still remember the night Ashley was born.
SUPMALE:She looked like a beautiful, little, black Winston Churchill.
LEADFEMALE:Seems like yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:Our baby's not a baby anymore, is she? You know, I knew it was time to have a talk with her and I tried to the other night but I just couldn't face the fact
LEADFEMALE:that she was having sexual feelings.
LEADMALE:Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, how could this happen to us? We live in a good neighborhood, they go to good schools.
SUPMALE:She's never even had a cavity, for God's sake.
LEADMALE:Vivian, times have changed since you and I were young.
OTHERFEMALE:Hell, they've changed since Hilary and Carlton were young.
SUPMALE:Well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
LEADMALE:You pack your bags, we are moving to Greenland.
LEADMALE:Now, this is not easy for me, either, but this is our job, honey.
LEADMALE:We're parents.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:We can do this.
OTHERMALE:We can do it.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi! I can't do it.
LEADMALE:Can't do what, Daddy? We want to talk to you.
OTHERMALE:About sex.
LEADMALE:I know where babies come from.
LEADMALE:I took sex education.
LEADMALE:I thought you took band.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I know that there are some feelings you're experiencing as a young woman.
SUPMALE:And I just wanna know, do you have questions? Well, a few.
LEADFEMALE:Then we'll do our best to answer them for you.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Kevin asked his mom a question and she fainted.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess the first thing I better do, then, is sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Dora can tie a
LEADMALE:Slipknot.
OTHERMALE:Slipknot.
SUPFEMALE:Dora can fit a whole orange in her mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Dora.
LEADFEMALE:In your phonebook? 
SUPFEMALE:

OTHERFEMALE:Biff's dad is a bankruptcy lawyer and according to him Westworld Airlines is about to fall prey to a corporate raider.
SUPFEMALE:Word? Man, I don't believe that.
SUPFEMALE:A corporate raider? What the bloody hell are you talking about? It's called inside information, and it's quite illegal.
LEADMALE:So is that French nanny you're dating.
OTHERFEMALE:Enough said.
LEADFEMALE:The point is I've only got $50, and I need $100 to buy the stock.
SUPMALE:All right, just let me think about it for a little while, all right? No.
LEADMALE:Will, take my hand come out of the ghetto and take a stroll down Wall Street.

LEADMALE:So then they'll owe me something! I'm with you! Here's my $20.
LEADMALE:I thought you said it was illegal.
SUPFEMALE:It is.
OTHERMALE:God, how I love life on the edge.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, guys.

SUPMALE:No, you cannot have the Diamond League over for lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, you promised you would reason with her.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I don't know why you want to join that organization anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, it was different when I joined.
OTHERMALE:Today, all those women care about are cars, men, and money.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what's wrong with that, sweetheart? Men with money can drive her away in their cars.
SUPMALE:Come on, it's just a little lunch.
LEADFEMALE:You never got me a pony.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, start buffing the silver.
LEADMALE:What the hell's your problem? You got bricks in your butt, you clown? Right away, madam.

LEADMALE:" Here's a Wall Street update.
OTHERMALE:The SEC has suspended trading of Westworld Air pending an announcement.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Carlton, translate.
LEADFEMALE:How can I put this in terms he'll understand? More money.
OTHERMALE:Man, I'm gonna get me the best girlfriend money can buy.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, man, you gotta think investment.

LEADMALE:This just

LEADFEMALE:How do you feel, Will?
SUPMALE:I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Buck up.
SUPMALE:You only have to give blood 50 more times to get Mom's bracelet back.
SUPMALE:There's gotta be an easier way, man.
SUPFEMALE:If I could just get them classifieds.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna hit me with this, are you? I'd like to.
OTHERMALE:But I see three of you, and I don't know which one to hit.
LEADFEMALE:Face it, Will.
SUPMALE:You're not gonna find a job in there.
SUPFEMALE:What are you qualified to do besides flirt with women and dance to loud, primitive music? "Male strippers wanted.
SUPFEMALE:Bingo.
OTHERMALE:Will, tell me you're joking.
SUPMALE:Even you, with your depraved, working-class morality wouldn't stoop so low.
OTHERMALE:"Earn up to $500 a night.
LEADMALE:" Shake that groove thing.
LEADMALE:So, did you get the stripper job or not? Does David Duke shop white sales? They said I was a natural, man.
SUPFEMALE:They're gonna call me with my first gig.
LEADFEMALE:Hold up, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Granted, we're desperate for money but maybe you should stop and think of what kind of life you'd be leading.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you're right, C.
LEADMALE:Dancing around in some cheap club while women put dollars down my underpants.
LEADMALE:I love this country.
SUPFEMALE:My financial advisors have arrived.
LEADMALE:Moron! Fathead!
SUPMALE:I didn't know the Dodgers were playing.
LEADMALE:They're not, thieving wankers.
LEADMALE:So, I think I should ask for my money back.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I've been in this weight-loss program six whole months and look at me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Shamu.
LEADMALE:Philip, I thought you had an important business lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing is more important than our little bachelorette.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:DeWynter! So nice to see you again.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:So, what do you think of our little Hilary? She's going to make some man a wonderful wife one day.
LEADMALE:Soon, I hope.
LEADMALE:Well, I think I speak for all of us leaguers when I say, "Isn't she lovely?" Yes.
LEADMALE:Vivian, I do hope you will bring Hilary to our new members' dinner.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I think I can speak for Vivian
SUPMALE:when I say, "She'll be there.
SUPFEMALE:"
LEADMALE:Philip In her brand new BMW.
LEADMALE:See you there.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, sweetie, we are going to the Diamond League dinner at the Gingham Turtle restaurant.
LEADFEMALE:Here's the address and phone number in case there's an emergency.
LEADFEMALE:Okay? Mom, I'm 13 years old.
SUPMALE:I can take care of myself.
LEADFEMALE:That's what Drew Barrymore said.
LEADFEMALE:Banks residence.
LEADFEMALE:No, Master William's not home, thank God.
LEADFEMALE:May I take a message? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, I'll see that he gets it.
LEADMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Master Will.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, G.
LEADMALE:The Boogie Buns Agency called.
LEADFEMALE:It appears you have a job this evening.
OTHERMALE:Bad! My first gig.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, where is it?
LEADFEMALE:The address is on the counter.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:And they also requested that you bring a spare G-string.
SUPMALE:There's an explanation for that, G.
LEADMALE:Yo, Carlton, I got a gig, man.
LEADFEMALE:We're home free.
SUPMALE:We'll get Aunt Viv's bracelet out of hock.
SUPMALE:She'll never know the difference.
LEADFEMALE:You mean we're saved?
SUPFEMALE:You got it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I picked my costume up today.
LEADMALE:See, I figure I'll start out in this.
SUPMALE:And I figure I'll end up in this.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta go iron this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Get the address for me.
LEADFEMALE:It's right over there on the counter.
SUPFEMALE:Gingham Turtle restaurant.
LEADMALE:Sounds pretty sleazy.
OTHERFEMALE:Yo, this ain't exactly what I expected.
LEADFEMALE:Check out the lowlife.
SUPFEMALE:Yes?
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, man, I'm here for the gig.
LEADFEMALE:You? You are here to perform for the ladies?
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:Of course you are.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm serious, where are the other guys at? I gotta get changed.
LEADFEMALE:Other guys? Yeah, when I auditioned they said I'd be second on the bill.
LEADFEMALE:Between King Thong and Rambro.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, monsieur.
LEADFEMALE:There is no one on the bill but you.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies, I'm told the entertainment has arrived.
LEADMALE:It's my pleasure to introduce the international star Sir Graham Higgins, doing a medley of operatic favorites.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, which opera is this? Will shake something, damn it! Take it off! Take it all off! Take it off! Put it on! Carlton Banks, you put your clothes on this minute! Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:No dates, no charge cards, no television, no movies, no phone calls no food! Sir, permission to beg, sir.
LEADFEMALE:What? I'm deeply, deeply sorry about the unfortunate stripping incident.
LEADMALE:I just wanna say it's all his fault.
LEADFEMALE:What? Look, come on, Uncle Phil.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I'm sure you did something like this when you were a kid.
LEADMALE:Maybe not.
LEADMALE:I think you two owe Hilary an apology.
LEADFEMALE:Your behavior tonight cost her an invitation to join the Diamond League and meet some nice young men and you know how much that meant to me.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, her.
SUPMALE:It's okay, Daddy.
OTHERMALE:The more time I spent with those women the more I realized they're not my kind of people.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to have anything to do with them.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I am so proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:DeWynter.
LEADMALE:Hilary, darling.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you run off like that? I wanted to invite you to join the Diamond League.
SUPFEMALE:I'd love to! Switching entertainment like that.
LEADFEMALE:What an outrageous idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Say, my mother's turning 90.
LEADMALE:Are they available for birthday parties?
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'll just be
LEADFEMALE:Sit.
LEADMALE:I'm not through with you two yet.
LEADMALE:I wanna know what excuse you have for pulling such a stupid stunt.
SUPFEMALE:We needed the money.
OTHERMALE:For what? And I want the truth.
OTHERMALE:All right, it's like this, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:See, Carlton got this inside tip on a stock.
SUPFEMALE:Federal offense.
SUPMALE:Go on.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, then we pawned Aunt Viv's bracelet to get the money for the stock.
LEADFEMALE:Grand larceny.
LEADFEMALE:Impressive.
OTHERMALE:And then we lost the money so we had to strip to get the bracelet back.
LEADFEMALE:That would be indecent exposure.
SUPMALE:Is there more? I'm afraid so, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:We never got the clasp fixed on Mom's bracelet.
LEADFEMALE:You never got the I don't know what to say.
SUPMALE:We don't What can I do? What do you boys think I should do? I don't know.
SUPMALE:Reward us for our honesty?
SUPMALE:Hey, it worked for the Beave.
SUPMALE:The Beave! Do I look like a white guy named Ward? Now, you get that bracelet back and for the next six weeks I don't want to hear you breathe.
LEADFEMALE:Or I'm calling the Feds myself.
LEADFEMALE:I guess this probably ain't the best time to tell him we ran over the mailbox.
SUPMALE:Come on, man, what is wrong with you? It's Agnes.
LEADFEMALE:I can feel her undressing me with her eyes.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think so, man.
OTHERFEMALE:She's not laughing.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, Agnes.
OTHERMALE:But isn't that our bracelet? Was your bracelet.
LEADMALE:I'm only obligated to hold it for five days.
LEADMALE:Today is the sixth.
LEADMALE:But we have the $500.
SUPMALE:Well, I'll give you $550.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it now, hold it a sec.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Agnes, could I speak to you for a second, please? Could I speak to Agnes? Hey, look, Agnes, slimmie, now, what's up? How you gonna play me? I thought we had an understanding, you know? I mean, we speak the same language and all.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? Babe, we ain't nothing going on but the rent.
LEADFEMALE:It's like that, right?
LEADMALE:Just like that.
SUPMALE:$550 is what the lady's offering.
SUPMALE:I hope it doesn't interfere with our relationship, Sweet 'N Low.
LEADFEMALE:Please, we'll do anything.
SUPFEMALE:What'll it take to change your mind? What you got? No.
SUPFEMALE:Work it, honey.
LEADMALE:Hey, it worked for the Beave.
SUPFEMALE:Worked for the Beave! Do I look like a white guy named Ward? Now, I want you two to go down there and get that bracelet back and for the next six weeks I don't want to hear you breathe.
LEADFEMALE:Or I'm diming you out to the Feds myself.
LEADMALE:Congratulations, you just made the blooper reel.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:A little lower, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey? Oh, hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:It's you! The kids aren't back from the airport with Will yet.
SUPMALE:In that case, I have an idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Take no prisoners, Daddy.
OTHERMALE:Speaking of prisoners, let's talk about Will.
LEADFEMALE:You know, maybe Bel-Air Prep isn't the right place for the boy.
SUPMALE:Maybe he could get more from a different environment.
LEADMALE:So could we.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, I'll race you to the Jacuzzi.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, now.
LEADMALE:I found a school that's a little further away than we're used to.
LEADMALE:How much further? Switzerland.
LEADMALE:Now that that's settled, I'll go fire up the Jacuzzi.
SUPFEMALE:Back it up.
OTHERMALE:Philip, how could you even suggest shipping Will off to some boarding school? Okay, I'm sorry, you're absolutely right.
SUPFEMALE:Will's a great kid, I've even grown to sort of Anyway, I'm sorry I even mentioned Switzerland.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:You're forgiven.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Would you consider Great Britain? Well, a man can dream, can't he? Vivian, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It's just that it's been so peaceful here since Will's been in Philly.
LEADFEMALE:And, boarding school's not so bad, is it, Geoffrey? Geoffrey went to boarding school.
LEADMALE:Tell her, Geoffrey.
OTHERFEMALE:Madam, I went to boarding school.
SUPFEMALE:And then I went to therapy.
LEADMALE:Who asked you? Get my lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Right away, sir.
OTHERMALE:The man has a tapeworm.
LEADMALE:Philip, when Will gets here, please be nice.
SUPMALE:Otherwise, you're going to be bunking with Mr.
LEADMALE:Couch.
SUPMALE:Woman, please do you think that you can manipulate me with sex? Does James Brown have a perm? Oh, Lord, I don't know whether to dive under the table or do the running man.
SUPMALE:G!
LEADMALE:Master William! Uncle Fink.
LEADFEMALE:Will, it's so nice to have you home.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, you look great, man.
OTHERMALE:You look like you lost some hair.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like the whole Jackson family could live in those pants.
LEADMALE:Daddy, that's how all the brothers are dressing in Philly.
LEADFEMALE:No wonder Willy Williams moved to LA.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, honey, what happened? Will told everyone at the airport I was Bryant Gumbel.
LEADFEMALE:I thought I'd get my luggage faster.
LEADFEMALE:You poor baby, what did they do? Mob you for autographs? No, five old ladies attacked me for being mean to Willard.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, it was worth it.
SUPFEMALE:We got the luggage.
OTHERFEMALE:My sister.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I need $500.
LEADFEMALE:Will!
LEADMALE:Hil! Daddy, I need $500.
LEADFEMALE:Hil, you should really consider expanding your vocabulary a little.
LEADMALE:Hilary, honey, if it's for the barbecue we're catering this afternoon we have already paid you.
LEADFEMALE:It's not for the barbecue.
LEADMALE:I just want $500.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Hil, please, at least kiss him first.
LEADMALE:What is that? That would be Aisha.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:You're right, Uncle Phil, wrong area code.
LEADMALE:That would be Stacy.
LEADMALE:Vivian, tell me that's not a beeper.
SUPMALE:Can I have one, Daddy? When Jesse Jackson gets a job.
SUPFEMALE:Will, there'll be no beepers worn in this house.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, what's up, Uncle Phil? My mom let me wear it in Philly.
SUPMALE:That's because she's your mother and she loves you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm your uncle.
SUPFEMALE:I just try not to hurt you.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil, I need to keep in touch with my tasties.
LEADFEMALE:I beg your pardon? His tasties, Daddy.
OTHERMALE:You know, his chubbies, his slimmies, his old ladies? And, who are you? Queen Latifah? See, look Just think of it as honeys on my hip, Uncle Phil, you know? It's like I need to keep in touch with my squaws, right? See otherwise, you know, they get all frazzled and frantic and everything.
OTHERFEMALE:You know how it is, right, Uncle Phil?
OTHERFEMALE:No, I do not.
LEADFEMALE:That's because you only got one squaw and you all never go nowhere.
LEADMALE:Well, this one squaw says take your behind upstairs, change, and no beeper.
LEADMALE:And, Philip, how come we don't ever go nowhere? Hold it, hold it, hold it.
OTHERMALE:What about my freedom to express myself? Will, back off.
SUPMALE:The big, fat vein in Daddy's head is starting to throb.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and he hasn't given me my money yet.
OTHERFEMALE:No, come on, Hil, we cool.
LEADMALE:You know it ain't really serious till his right eye start twitching.
SUPMALE:Okay, posse up.
OTHERMALE:And may I say that if you go with our firm it'll be the best decision you ever made.
LEADMALE:Well, enough business talk, Mr.
LEADMALE:And Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Cornfeld.
LEADMALE:Please, enjoy the party.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Call me Norma.
SUPMALE:Norma.
OTHERMALE:And, you can call me Whitey.
LEADFEMALE:I think not.
SUPMALE:Everyone does, on account of my white hair.
LEADFEMALE:White hair.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Welcome to our home.
SUPMALE:I'm Vivian, Philip's wife.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian, say hi to Whitey.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Whitey.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, why am I calling that man Whitey? Yo, yo, yo Mommy and Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look.
SUPMALE:It's the entertainment.
SUPMALE:I think this is our youngest daughter, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:She just had a brain operation.
LEADFEMALE:Her head's a little swollen, hence the hat.
LEADMALE:Very good, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Ashley, what are you wearing? Will got it for me in Philly.
LEADMALE:Ain't it fly?
SUPFEMALE:Switzerland, Vivian.
OTHERMALE:Not far enough, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, go upstairs and change right now.
LEADFEMALE:But, I like it.
LEADFEMALE:And if I don't wear it, it'll hurt Will's feelings.
LEADFEMALE:If you do wear it, you'll never see 18.
LEADFEMALE:I never liked Will, anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Will, you must change.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, you must grow.
SUPFEMALE:Will, you better change before Dad sees you.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about, man? I'm making a statement.
OTHERFEMALE:What statement? "I'm out on parole"? Will, get away from the buffet table.
LEADMALE:Your jail suit is scaring the people away.
SUPFEMALE:With all due respect, Hilary, it's not Will's fault, it's How shall I put this? The food sucks.
LEADMALE:Man, what are you talking about? It looks good to me.
LEADFEMALE:The pepper's moving.
LEADMALE:That is the last time I buy sushi out of the trunk of a car.
LEADFEMALE:Tuna roll? Will, take off those clothes.
LEADMALE:I would, Aunt Viv, but I wouldn't want to make all your guests jealous.
LEADMALE:Will, please, these are very important clients.
LEADMALE:At least take off that ridiculous hat.
OTHERFEMALE:Wonderful party, Banks.
LEADFEMALE:You really know how to court a client.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:This is my nephew, Will.
LEADMALE:And this is his hair.
OTHERMALE:It's a pleasure to meet you both.
LEADFEMALE:Call me Whitey.
SUPMALE:No, I'm gonna call you that then you gonna call me the other thing, and we're gonna be here fighting.
LEADFEMALE:Will, Whitey is the president of a very prestigious savings and loan.
SUPMALE:Oh, really? Guess a lot of your buddies wearing suits like this now, huh? Why don't we just go over here, and Move it over here, Whitey.
LEADFEMALE:You all right, Uncle Phil?
LEADFEMALE:Will you just insulted a potential Put your hat on.
LEADFEMALE:You just told me to take my hat off.
SUPFEMALE:Put it on! That's me.
OTHERFEMALE:Chill, fellas.
LEADMALE:I got that right here.
LEADMALE:That's Stacy again, sweating me.
LEADMALE:You want to handle this one, big guy, or shall I?
LEADMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Good call.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I told you there will be no beepers worn in my house.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I didn't really disobey you, Uncle Phil, 'cause, see technically, we not in the house.
LEADMALE:Smog.
LEADFEMALE:Get rid of that thing.
LEADMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil, what's wrong? Do you think everybody's gonna think I'm a drug dealer? Why wouldn't they think I'm a doctor? 'Cause everyone knows Buckwheat never went to medical school.
LEADMALE:Will, put your hat back on.
SUPMALE:I'm so confused.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me clarify it for you, Will.
LEADMALE:Get rid of the hair, get rid of the clothes, and give me the beeper.
LEADMALE:I don't really think that Stacy's your type, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think that just because there are a lot of people around you can defy me openly and get away with it?
LEADFEMALE:Well, I was kind of hoping, since
SUPFEMALE:Get upstairs! Uncle Phil, man, why you making such a big deal about this? Boy, as long as you live in my house, you will do what I say.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I won't be in your house, then.
LEADMALE:Good.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, all right.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm out of here, then.
SUPMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:And what are you looking at, Whitey? I'll help you with those, ma'am.

LEADMALE:You dating Whoopi Goldberg? How about "come in," man? I need a place to crash.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:You got a place to crash.
LEADFEMALE:A mansion with a pool, a tennis court and a toilet that flushes without using a coat hanger.
SUPFEMALE:Not no more, man.
LEADFEMALE:Dang, your toilet broke, too? No, Jazz, it's my uncle, man.

SUPMALE:Jazz Sorry, my brother but those are the harsh realities of the cruel world in which we habitate.
LEADMALE:And now, booty awaits me.
LEADMALE:Jazz, if our friendship means anything to you, you'll open this door right now.
LEADMALE:I walked 10 miles and took four buses to get here, now open this door.

OTHERFEMALE:Who said that? You are too c/ose to the vehic/e.
LEADFEMALE:I heard you the first time.
SUPMALE:You have 10 seconds to move away before the a/arm activates.
LEADMALE:Oh, really now? Ten seconds, I knew you was full of it.
LEADFEMALE:Chill, chill! Who are you talking to, son? Actually, I was talking to the car, Officer.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the car talks? No, it's kind of fly, actually.

OTHERFEMALE:Damn! You are too c/ose to the vehic/e.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, Will's been gone for seven hours now.
LEADFEMALE:What if something's happened to him? Don't try to cheer me up, Vivian.
OTHERMALE:Philip, I'm serious.
SUPFEMALE:Do something.
SUPFEMALE:What do you want me to do? I've got Geoffrey out scouring the city.
LEADFEMALE:I'm terribly sorry, sir, I've looked everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:There isn't an ice cream sandwich left in this town.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian.
LEADMALE:Ashley, what are you doing out of bed? I'm worried about Will.
LEADMALE:Why did you throw him out into the street, Daddy? I did not throw him into the street.
LEADFEMALE:Quite right, sir.
LEADMALE:You threw him on the lawn.
SUPMALE:He rolled into the street.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, we couldn't find Will anywhere.
LEADMALE:And, sorry, no ice cream sandwiches.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like you really blew it this time, huh, big guy? I just hope the Willster's still breathing.
LEADFEMALE:Will! Oh, honey, thank God you're safe.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:You stink.
OTHERMALE:Boy, it's good to be home.
SUPFEMALE:Is there a problem, Officer? Oh, right.
OTHERFEMALE:Just 'cause I come in the crib in the middle of the night escorted by a police officer, you think something's wrong.
OTHERFEMALE:See how he be trying to play me, Fred? Thank you so much for bringing him home, Officer.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Will, I guess I better beat it.
LEADFEMALE:Good night, folks.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:What, I got a boogie? Will, I am very disappointed in you.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe the trouble you've caused this family.
SUPFEMALE:Your aunt's right.
SUPFEMALE:You've been back from Philly one day you insult a client and you storm out of this house like a crazy man and worry this family half to death.
LEADMALE:And I don't appreciate the influence you're having on your cousin Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:He's not a bad influence on me, Daddy.
OTHERMALE:I have a mind of my own.
LEADFEMALE:If that's okay with you.
LEADMALE:Look at that.
OTHERMALE:It's like you got her brainwashed.
LEADMALE:That's right, and it took me 13 years to do it.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, can I say something?
LEADFEMALE:What is it, Carlton? You forgot the part about Will getting arrested.
OTHERFEMALE:You all trying to play me like that, right? What if he told you that you couldn't wear plaid anymore? Don't joke about that, Will.
LEADFEMALE:What if he told you that you couldn't entertain men in the Jacuzzi anymore? When did you have a man in the Jacuzzi? This isn't about me.
SUPMALE:It's about Will.
SUPFEMALE:Come on y'all.
LEADFEMALE:It's about all of us.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, look, we're young adults here.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we have a right to our own opinions.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah! Look, today it's my beeper, tomorrow it's going to be who you can date or how to vote, or what college to go to.
LEADMALE:That's such bulldoody.
SUPMALE:Dad knows I'm going to y ale.
SUPFEMALE:You're going to Princeton.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to go to Princeton.
SUPMALE:Hold on a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I want to know when you had a man in the Jacuzzi.
LEADMALE:Look, that's my private life.
LEADFEMALE:That's between me, that man, and his video camera.
OTHERFEMALE:Look Uncle Phil, I'm saying, what's the difference between me wearing this, and you in the sixties? You wore a dashiki and an afro.
LEADMALE:But I was making a cultural statement.
LEADMALE:You're just drawing attention to yourself.
LEADFEMALE:But, now correct me if I'm wrong but you don't think a 6'3", in a dashiki and an afro the size of West Philly is drawing attention to himself? I am just trying to save you from going through the same hassles that I went through.
SUPFEMALE:But I'm saying, why would you want to? Look how good you turned out.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:He's got you there, big guy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm with Will, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Well, Will I hate to admit it, but I guess you have a point.
LEADMALE:I do? Just because you live in my house doesn't mean I can control you.
OTHERFEMALE:It don't? So, you can express yourself any way you want to.
LEADMALE:Keep the clothes, keep the hair and the beeper.
SUPFEMALE:Knock yourself out.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:But, you know Now, I've been thinking.
LEADMALE:You know, I have a need to express myself, too.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Uncle Phil, you might be able to get one little twist right here No, no, no, that's not quite what I had in mind.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, I can't force you to do anything you don't want to do.
OTHERMALE:But, these are my kids.
OTHERMALE:So, as long as you keep the hair the clothes and the beeper you're all grounded.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Nice try.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look y'all, this is a classic case of divide and conquer.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Malcolm warned us about this.
OTHERMALE:Get him! We're going to swing out for a little while, all right? 'Cause you're the only friend I got right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Lift! Lift! Lift! Lift! Lift! 
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Shabba!
SUPMALE:Will, get your feet off the furniture.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry about that, Uncle Phil.
OTHERMALE:Why aren't you doing your homework?
OTHERMALE:No, see, I was just How many times have I told you not to eat on the couch? And while we're on the subject It's kind of fly, right? Don't you wish you lived on TV? Must be what it sounds like to wake up in Little Richard's crib.
SUPMALE:What's with Dad, anyway, waking us up at 6:00 a.
SUPFEMALE:M? Now I'll never know how that dream ends.
SUPMALE:She dumps you, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look, all I'm saying is, just 'cause he own the crib and pay all the bills and everything, he think he can tell us what to do.
SUPMALE:Now, I don't know about y'all, but I ain't having it.
LEADMALE:I think it's time for somebody to straighten him out.
OTHERMALE:Step to it, Ash.
LEADMALE:Will, we're going to go down and help rebuild the old neighborhood and I don't want any attitude from you.
LEADMALE:What? I had a fabulous time, Wesley.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come in? Don't be silly, they won't be up for hours.
LEADMALE:Night, Sister Mary Margaret.
SUPMALE:Daddy, have you lost weight? Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Sister Mary Margaret drives a Porsche? Man, they must got it going on down at the convent, huh? Hilary, what were you doing out all night? I wasn't out all night, I just got up early to go to mass.
LEADFEMALE:We're not Catholic.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, is my face red.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Hold it, young lady.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to go upstairs and change your clothes.
LEADFEMALE:We're meeting Reverend Williams and the church group in half an hour.
SUPMALE:Excuse me? You said you'd come down to the old neighborhood with us.
SUPMALE:Remember? I also said Daddy lost weight.
LEADMALE:Hilary, go change your clothes.
LEADFEMALE:Now! This is too important.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna let you get out of this.
OTHERMALE:Boy, Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv sure are hyped up about going down to their old neighborhood.
SUPFEMALE:Brother, I can just hear them 
LEADMALE:"Look, kids, this is where we lived when we first got married.
OTHERMALE:"And this is the little park where we walked little Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:" "And, look, there's the pet store where we bought little Carlton.
LEADMALE:" I think it's cute.
LEADFEMALE:They're going to be mushy and lovey-dovey all day.
SUPMALE:Vivian, what the hell is the matter with you? You've been avoiding me ever since I got home yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:What did I do? Come on, tell me.
SUPMALE:Is it something that I did, or something that I didn't do or Oh, my God.
OTHERMALE:Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:It's not our anniversary, Philip.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God, good.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what is it?
SUPMALE:You're wearing that shirt.
LEADMALE:Why not? It's my around-the-house shirt.
SUPFEMALE:I've worn it around the house every weekend for years.
SUPMALE:That's what I mean.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, you have become so predictable.
OTHERMALE:Vivian, don't you think you're being just a wee bit erratic this morning? Absolutely not.
LEADMALE:Philip, look at my hair.
SUPFEMALE:I can't go out like this.
LEADFEMALE:I gotta go to the salon.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you went yesterday, sweetheart that's why we couldn't have lunch together.
LEADFEMALE:Right, you're right.
SUPMALE:Henri tried something new, do you like it? Will, what do you think? Will! Well, actually, Aunt Viv, you got a kind of a Don King Kris Kross, Bride of Frankenthing going.
LEADMALE:Not many people could pull it off.
LEADMALE:You know, as you're proving, right, but What, Carlton? Vivian, where were you yesterday? Shooting baskets with Michael Jordon.
LEADMALE:You know, Clair would never talk to Cliff like that.
LEADFEMALE:What, Carlton? Yo, my brother, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going.
SUPFEMALE:It's Hammer time.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry about that, man, you know, you have to excuse my cousin you know, he's an idiot.
LEADMALE:Carlton, can you please relax, man? Okay, I won't say another word.
LEADMALE:I won't even make eye contact.
SUPMALE:Oh, God, what a stallion.
LEADFEMALE:Time to saddle up.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, what's up, baby? Hurry up, write your number down before I don't want it no more.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:How are you doing? I'm Will and this is my cousin, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Simone.
SUPMALE:Thanks for coming down.
SUPMALE:I'm going to show you what to do.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm going to buy you a car.
LEADFEMALE:No, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:But I do need a strong pair of arms.
SUPMALE:That would be me.
LEADFEMALE:I got that.
LEADMALE:Carlton can't help you, he's on the debate team.
OTHERFEMALE:Really, I'm captain of my debate team.
OTHERMALE:Simone, where you want me to go with this? How about over there somewhere, like, say, Cleveland? Tell me to go to Cleveland, mushroom head.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess we better get busy.
LEADMALE:All right! Oh, right.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, Simone, why don't you come by the school on Monday we're debating Roe v.
OTHERMALE:Wade.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, reproductive rights! No, row versus wade, the best way to cross a stream.
SUPFEMALE:You've got a great sense of humor.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADMALE:What's the matter?
LEADMALE:It's just a splinter.
SUPFEMALE:Better let me take a look at that finger for you.
OTHERMALE:Damn!
LEADFEMALE:Problem, sir? It's Vivian.
SUPMALE:I don't know what's gotten into her.
SUPFEMALE:This morning she told me that I've become too
LEADFEMALE:Predictable, sir?
SUPMALE:Yes, that's exactly what she said.
LEADFEMALE:She said that I wear the same
LEADFEMALE:Blue shirt every weekend, sir? Yes, I mean, just because a man has Froot Loops every morning.
SUPFEMALE:Just because I watch
OTHERFEMALE:Lega/ Beag/es every night.
SUPMALE:Does that mean that I've become predictable? Absolutely not, sir.
LEADMALE:Why, you're a regular hotbed of spontaneity.
OTHERMALE:You're welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Hilary, why doesn't anyone want my soda? Because your soda's flat.
LEADFEMALE:Do you believe this mess, man? I thought we was here to work.
LEADMALE:Don't even sweat it, man.
SUPMALE:Most of those fools ain't coming back here, anyway.
OTHERMALE:A few more months, everybody's conscience will be cleared and things will be back to status quo.
SUPFEMALE:Half these people don't even understand what really went down here, man.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Hey, I'm Noah, man.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's up? Will.
SUPFEMALE:And then when I was 12, I played Maria in an all-boy production of West Side Story.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, slow down.
LEADMALE:I want to hear more about your collection of Sea-Monkeys.
LEADFEMALE:Will you marry me? Well, there go the nerdyweds.
LEADMALE:Vivian, wait.
LEADMALE:Now, you cannot avoid me all day.
LEADFEMALE:Now, where were you yesterday? Philip, I love you sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:Trust me, you're my husband.
LEADMALE:And, as your husband, I have a right to an explanation.
LEADMALE:And, as your wife when I think of something, you'll be the first one to know.
LEADMALE:Don't I'm not finished with you yet, woman.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm through with you, man.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's right, I'm bad.
LEADMALE:Man, I'm beat.
LEADFEMALE:Got blisters on top of blisters.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, me, too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, so what time you coming back tomorrow? I can't make it tomorrow, man.
OTHERFEMALE:I got school and everything, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll get with you next weekend, then.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I can't make it next weekend, you know I got a date on Saturday and then I got a ball game on Sunday.
LEADMALE:So, you know how it is, man.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know how it is.
LEADMALE:You're not coming back.
OTHERMALE:Wait, hold up, man, I'm coming back.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're not, man.
SUPFEMALE:I bet you feel pretty good about yourself, don't you? I mean, you come down here, do the right thing then you go home patting yourself on the back 'cause you helped out the poor folk.
LEADMALE:Hold up, man.
LEADMALE:Yo, I'm from Philly.
LEADMALE:We had to save up to be poor.
OTHERMALE:Why you sweating me like this man, what's up? 'Cause, you're just like all the rest of them.
SUPMALE:You come around here with the X cap and them cool Doc Martens and you're all "dope" and "word to your mother.
LEADFEMALE:" And you think that makes you committed? Let me tell you something, this ain't no game.
LEADFEMALE:And if you think that it is, then maybe you should go home 'cause you're not welcome here.
LEADMALE:Tell Dan Quayle I said, "What's up.
SUPFEMALE:" Now I'm not welcome here, right? Well, you got your story a little wrong, homey.
LEADFEMALE:This community appreciates me.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't even know Dan Quayle.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I'm going to knock your head off, slimeball.
SUPMALE:Yo, man! Help! Shut up, bad man.
LEADMALE:Put your hands up and put down the toaster.
SUPFEMALE:Put your hands up in the air, put down the toaster.
LEADFEMALE:Make up your mind, man.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want me to do first? Will! What the hell is going on in here? Dad, don't do anything stupid, you haven't updated your will yet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Hector? Yeah, what? Wait Wait a minute, I know you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, ain't you the guy from Fami/y Matters?
LEADMALE:Yes!
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm Philip.
OTHERMALE:Philip Banks.

SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! Curly? They must go way back.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, come here quick.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, what's it been, years? Oh, I don't believe it.
OTHERMALE:It's Hector Alvarez.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, kids, look it's Hector.
LEADFEMALE:Hector! How are you?
LEADMALE:You look wonderful.
OTHERMALE:So do you.
LEADMALE:Who's Hector?
SUPMALE:I don't know, but be nice to him he's got a bat.
LEADMALE:Stay where you are, punk.
SUPMALE:I caught this little creep stealing.
LEADMALE:I'll go call the police.
SUPFEMALE:I got a quarter.
SUPFEMALE:Now, hold on.
LEADMALE:Hector, there must be some mistake.
OTHERMALE:This is y eah, this is our nephew, Will.
LEADMALE:You mean little Willie from Philly? But, of course, who else could it be with those muy grandes orejas?
OTHERFEMALE:What does that mean?
SUPFEMALE:Big ears.
SUPMALE:Hector, let me see that bat for a second.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry about the bat, folks.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I guess I'm a little jumpy.
SUPMALE:I've been robbed a couple of times, man.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry to hear that, Hector.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, kids, you remember Hector.
LEADFEMALE:I'll remember him now! Sweetheart, before you were born, we used to live here.
LEADFEMALE:Right above Hector's grocery store.
LEADMALE:Wait, this is the old apartment? Hector, I love what you've done with the place.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we didn't have a lot, but we always had enough to eat
SUPFEMALE:thanks to Hector.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Even if you didn't have any money, you had all the food you needed long as he liked you.
LEADFEMALE:I guess y'all was in love then, huh, Uncle Phil? So, Perry Mason, how is the crusading business coming, man? Are you still fighting for little guys like me? Well, I'm still fighting, but it's corporate mergers mostly.
LEADFEMALE:So you're not working out of a little storefront anymore? Well, no, my office has gotten a little bit bigger but it's just a few miles from here.
SUPFEMALE:You work in Beverly Hills, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Beverly Hills.
LEADMALE:Hey, Curly, that's terrific! Hey, maybe now you can pay me back for some of those Ring Dings? He ain't doing that well.
LEADFEMALE:Hector, I just cannot believe our old apartment went up in flames.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, there's been a lot of changes since you've been gone.
OTHERMALE:It's still nice to have you back.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, look, I'll be downstairs.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? I never gave you kids a wedding present.
LEADMALE:Best of luck, huh? You know, Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, I used to love coming out here to visit y'all.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Ashley, check this out.
OTHERFEMALE:This is where Aunt Viv used to measure how tall we was getting.
SUPMALE:Look, here's me.
SUPFEMALE:Will, there's you.
LEADMALE:Look, there's Carlton.
LEADMALE:You know, Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, there was a lot of love shared in this room.
SUPMALE:Don't even think about kissing me.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, time to set the table.
OTHERMALE:Baby, why are you throwing your doll in the garbage? Well, I tried flushing her down the toilet, but the little creep floats.
LEADMALE:I want a new doll.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, it's all we can afford right now.
LEADFEMALE:With all the free legal aid your daddy gives we're barely covering expenses but there are more important things in life than fancy clothes and big houses.
SUPFEMALE:What have you been smoking? Yo, Uncle Phil, how you going to play a nephew? On his behind, Will.
SUPMALE:That honey was about to invite me up for some milk and cookies.
LEADMALE:That honey was old enough to be your mother.
LEADMALE:Word up, and she was divorced, too.
LEADFEMALE:Parents just don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, big guy, got time to read me a bedtime story? Sure, Carlton, what's it going to be? Cat /n The Hat or Curious George? No, The Wa// Street Journa/, the part where AMC goes belly up.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure we're all related? Mom, Dad, I've been thinking it over and I've decided what I want to be when I grow up.
SUPFEMALE:What, tall?
LEADFEMALE:That's nice, honey, what?
SUPMALE:President of the United States.
OTHERMALE:Well, that would make me very proud, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Imagine, my son, the country's first black president.
OTHERMALE:I'm black? Hello? One second, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Philip, it's Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Firth from the law firm.
SUPMALE:Hello, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Firth? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I would love to meet with the other partners.
LEADFEMALE:Next Thursday is great.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:All right, hold it now.
SUPMALE:Don't want to get anybody's hopes up but Mr.
LEADMALE:Firth wants me to come back for a second interview.
LEADFEMALE:I'm rich! I'm rich! I'll pack our bags.
LEADMALE:Maybe we can get a place close to the Reagans.
LEADMALE:Did I ever tell you folks how much I like visiting? Hold on, now.
SUPMALE:Hold on.
SUPMALE:Now look even if I do get this job, nothing changes.
SUPFEMALE:This is our home and this community is a part of our family.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll never turn my back on it.
OTHERFEMALE:We had some good times in this old place.
LEADFEMALE:We sure did, baby.
SUPMALE:Our roots are here.
OTHERFEMALE:This is where we started our family.
SUPMALE:Man, I wonder if that divorced lady still live here? She probably like 127 or something y eah, and we made some very good friends here.
LEADMALE:But we haven't fulfilled our commitment to them or to this place.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, you know, Uncle Phil, I think I will come back you know, next weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Hook up with my man Noah, set up a schedule.
LEADMALE:Yes, I think I'll hook up with Simone and make out a little schedule of my own.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going to go sign up for next week.
LEADFEMALE:So, the house will be empty next week? Great! I'm going to plan a party.
LEADMALE:I guess you're really disappointed in me, huh, Vivian?
LEADFEMALE:Why?
LEADMALE:'Cause I sold out.
LEADMALE:Did everything I said I wouldn't do.
LEADFEMALE:Became a high-powered lawyer bought that house in Bel-Air, and never looked back.
LEADMALE:Philip, honey, you shouldn't feel guilty about your success.
LEADMALE:Baby, nobody gave you anything.
LEADMALE:You have worked hard for everything you've got.
LEADFEMALE:You've been generous and you've contributed to a lot of causes.
LEADFEMALE:It takes more than just writing a check.
LEADMALE:I've lost myself, I've lost my fire, my passion.
SUPMALE:You're right, Vivian, I have become dull and predictable.
SUPFEMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:I want to be the kind of man you fell in love with.
SUPMALE:I want to be open to risks, I want to take chances.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Philip, do you mean it? Do you? I'm afraid it's too late.
LEADFEMALE:I've chased you away.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, what are you talking about? I know where you were yesterday.
LEADMALE:You're having an affair.
LEADMALE:I don't blame you, I'm just going to kill you.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, is that where you thought I was yesterday? What? You mean, you weren't with another man?
LEADMALE:Of course not.
LEADMALE:Lucky for you.
LEADMALE:Philip, I was afraid to tell you because I didn't think you could take it.
OTHERFEMALE:You didn't think I could take it.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:But now I know you can.
LEADMALE:Philip, I was at the doctor's yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:The doctor's! Philip, I'm pregnant! So you're not working out of a little storefront anymore? Well, no, my office has gotten a little bit bigger and I only And, it's pretty good.

LEADMALE:Can you say "daddy"? And here Here is your mommy.
SUPFEMALE:And here is you.

LEADMALE:We're going to have a baby! Yay.
OTHERFEMALE:Good morning, honey.
LEADMALE:Going to the electric chair? Philip, since I got pregnant, I can't stop eating.
SUPFEMALE:But, honey, you got to be careful of what you eat.
SUPMALE:Remember, baby, you're eating for two now.
SUPMALE:You better watch it, since I could get used to all this attention, you know.
LEADMALE:That's fine with me, baby.
LEADMALE:Let me take care of you.
SUPMALE:No, no, that's all fat.
LEADMALE:No, no, all sugar.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, that's all right.
SUPFEMALE:The catering business is so unfair.

LEADFEMALE:That's too bad.
LEADFEMALE:So how's the apartment hunting going, honey? Excuse me? Hilary, we've been over this.
SUPFEMALE:With the baby coming, we're going to need the room.

OTHERFEMALE:Yes, and we don't want you in any of them.
LEADMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:Hilary, honey, what your father's trying to say is you don't live here anymore, honey.
LEADMALE:But this is all so sudden.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, like, if I'd only had some kind of warning or something.
LEADMALE:Hello, is this on? Where do you expect me to go? I don't have anything saved.
SUPMALE:Honey, we'll pay first and last month's rent.
OTHERFEMALE:What about the months in between?

LEADFEMALE:You're just nervous about your first day at a new school, but don't be, come on.
OTHERMALE:You're going to make a lot of new friends.
LEADFEMALE:What if no one likes me? Just do what Carlton 
LEADFEMALE:Give them money.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, you're going to be all right.
LEADMALE:You have a wonderful personality.
SUPMALE:Oh, great, now I'm ugly.

LEADFEMALE:Little Ashley joining me at Bel-Air Prep.
LEADMALE:Hey, I thought you asked Dad to send me to public school.
OTHERFEMALE:Merely a trial balloon.
LEADMALE:The fact remains that I love you.
LEADMALE:But if we run into each other at school, act like we've never met.
OTHERMALE:Don't acknowledge me, don't talk to me, act like I'm invisible.
LEADMALE:If you're not sure how, just do what all the other girls do.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'm serious.
SUPMALE:This is my senior year, and I don't want you tagging along.
SUPMALE:I've worked too hard at becoming popular.
SUPFEMALE:And any day now, it's going to kick in, right? Darn tooting.
LEADMALE:Hey, look.
SUPMALE:I just think it's about time Bel-Air Prep went coed.
SUPFEMALE:There's going to be cute girls everywhere.
SUPMALE:Cute, rich girls that know the one thing their parents can't stand is for them to be dating a big black dude.
LEADMALE:Will, can I hang out with you until I make some friends? Oh, yeah, sure, Ash.
OTHERMALE:Just look for the huddle of girls with the chocolate center.
LEADMALE:It's a disgrace.
SUPFEMALE:It's a scandal.
LEADFEMALE:It's an outrage! It's the mother of my children.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, look.
LEADMALE:The way to make an impression is to relax, man.
OTHERFEMALE:You got to be calm, chill out a little bit.
OTHERFEMALE:Hurt me! Hurt me! What's up, baby? The name's Veronica.
LEADFEMALE:Veronica, I likes that.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Now, I can die.
SUPMALE:Hold up, baby.
LEADMALE:See now, I noticed you noticing me.
OTHERMALE:So I just want to put you on notice that I noticed you, too.
SUPFEMALE:And? And to let you know that, you know, I might consider letting you be with me.
LEADMALE:Is that what passes for a compliment around here?
LEADMALE:Look, baby, listen.
LEADFEMALE:No, you listen.
OTHERMALE:If you want a shot at being with me maybe you should try talking to me like a human being, okay? Got it? Actually, baby, you got it, but I take donations.
SUPFEMALE:Dag, Will.
LEADFEMALE:You sure have a way with the ladies.
OTHERMALE:Hey, man, what's your secret? Well, I would like to help you out, my brother.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, it's a chemical thing.
SUPFEMALE:You drug them? No, no, no.
LEADMALE:Look, Kenny, it's instinct.
LEADMALE:Like, you know the old 
LEADMALE:"Those who can, do, those who can't, teach"? Well, I can and I do.
SUPFEMALE:That's deep, man.
LEADMALE:Slide over here for a second.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll give you a few pointers.
LEADFEMALE:Incoming! Well, Carlton, here we have a couple of particularly impressive competitors.
SUPMALE:Judges! Will, the judges like her.
LEADFEMALE:They really, really like her.
SUPFEMALE:And let's hear it for the East German team!
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Carl.
OTHERMALE:Out of the way, Ashley.
SUPMALE:I'm trying to see.
LEADMALE:Ashley, watch out! I can't believe how hard it is to find a beachfront place with a pool and tennis court for $500 a month.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what's happening to this country? It's enough to make me want to vote.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should lower your standards a little.
LEADMALE:You're not going to be happy until I'm living in a trailer, eating Spam on Ritz.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, that's where this is going, isn't it? Sweetheart, I found a few places that don't look so bad.
LEADFEMALE:I'm beginning to get the idea that you want to get rid of me.
LEADFEMALE:Run with that.
SUPMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:So how was the first day at school?
LEADMALE:Way cool, grand hombre.
SUPMALE:Yo, Uncle Phil, it was booming, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Tasties everywhere.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, big ones, small ones, short ones, tall ones Black ones, brown ones, rich ones, poor ones, crazy ones.
LEADMALE:Well, your aunt and I used to It's not important.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, I thought you were against girls at Bel-Air Prep.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'll be the first to admit I had great reservations about it but I've already learned that many of my assumptions about the opposite sex were just plain wrong.
LEADFEMALE:And that was just from 10 minutes of hiding under the bleachers.
LEADMALE:Hey, guys.
SUPMALE:Come on over here.
LEADFEMALE:You know, that reminds me of my freshman year at college.
OTHERMALE:Now, for extra money, I had to work for the Princeton Dai/y.
LEADMALE:And my first assignment was to interview the town's most famous stripper Boom Boom LaSalle.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder why they called her that? For some reason, I don't know what, she kind of took a liking to me and so she invited me to go with her and her sister to their dressing room for drinks.
LEADMALE:You the man.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, one thing led to another and before I knew it, this old country boy finished his y oo-hoo and went right home.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Go back to where you finished your y oo-hoo.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley! Ashley, baby, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:How was school?
LEADFEMALE:School was fine.
SUPFEMALE:Did you make any new friends?
SUPMALE:A few.
SUPFEMALE:I've got to go study.
SUPFEMALE:Well, did some of the boys try anything with you? No, nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing at all.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil, you'll be happy to know that none of the boys tried nothing with me, neither.
LEADFEMALE:There you go noticing me again.
SUPFEMALE:I'm telling you, she wants me.
LEADMALE:She senses my raw animal power and is incapable of turning away.
LEADMALE:She senses that big, wet, nasty blob of mayonnaise on your cheek and she can't eat till you wipe it off.
LEADMALE:So, yo, you seen Ashley today?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Me neither.
LEADMALE:I wonder where she at.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know and I don't care.
OTHERMALE:As long as she doesn't try to sit with me again.
LEADMALE:It's kind of hard to impress the honeys when your baby sister's blowing bubbles in your milk.
LEADMALE:Will, check out the talent.
LEADMALE:She's cool! She's hot!
SUPFEMALE:She's
SUPMALE:y our baby sister, man! Ease back, man, ease back.

LEADFEMALE:Buzz off, short stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to I'm ordering you to look unattractive.
LEADMALE:Ashley, who did you have for breakfast, some hormones or something? Beat it.
SUPMALE:I'm working the room.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Bobby.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd she learn to walk like that? Yeah, where'd she get that Lee Press-On body? Hurt me! Hurt me! Yo, baby.
LEADMALE:You see, I noticed you noticing me.
SUPFEMALE:And I wanted to give you notice that I noticed you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, you float my boat.
LEADMALE:I know you better float your midget boat on out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, man, ease up.
SUPFEMALE:No, you ease up, man.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think you're doing? The same thing that you do.
LEADMALE:I'm just trying to press up this woman.
LEADFEMALE:That ain't no woman, that's my cousin.
SUPFEMALE:I am too a woman, and I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my business.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you shake your neck at me like that, girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Kenny.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:And don't you shake that either.
LEADFEMALE:I did it.
LEADFEMALE:I found the perfect place, and it's within my budget.
LEADMALE:You did?
SUPMALE:That's great, baby.
SUPFEMALE:You guys were right.
LEADFEMALE:I do have what it takes to survive.
LEADFEMALE:And it's true what they 
LEADMALE:"You give a man a fish, you feed him for a day" But you give a man a cow and he can eat for a month, maybe more.
LEADFEMALE:Don't, don't, don't.
SUPFEMALE:She's on a roll.
LEADFEMALE:This place has got it all.
SUPMALE:Pool, tennis, and full utilities.
LEADMALE:And I won't need any more than the $500 a month that Daddy promised me.
OTHERFEMALE:That's an incredible deal.
OTHERMALE:Unbelievable, even.
LEADFEMALE:I think we should see this place.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if you want to.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't miss it.
LEADMALE:I'll get the car keys.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to need them.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Is it in the neighborhood? You're getting warmer.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where is it, exactly? I'm going to live in the pool house.
LEADFEMALE:You said I had to be out of the house, but not off of the property.
LEADFEMALE:And with the money that Daddy promised me it will cover my furniture rental.
SUPMALE:Philip! Philip, honey.
SUPMALE:Honey, we're getting off easy.
SUPMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:But it's not fair.
LEADMALE:She's winning! Baby, I'm telling you.
SUPMALE:You've got more moves than a bowl of Jell-O.
LEADFEMALE:And there's always room for Jell-O.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Dude sounds like a jackass.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, Will, he sounds like you.
LEADFEMALE:So, Kenny, when are we going out?
SUPMALE:I don't know, baby.
SUPMALE:You have to let me check my book, and I'll get back to you.
SUPFEMALE:You see, I want to make sure I can give you my undivided attention.
LEADMALE:Actually, Will, he's better than you.
LEADMALE:I mean, look at you, you got it going on.
LEADFEMALE:You got sweet hips, lips and fingertips.
LEADMALE:But, baby got back! Bye, baby.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute! Will.
LEADMALE:Will, I know my sister needs me, but that girl was babelicious.
OTHERMALE:Carlton I think you know what you have to do.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:Still I would have liked to have been there for Ashley.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:I was so sure looking like this would make me popular.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, what do guys want, anyway? Ashley, look, guys want a girl who's sweet and kind and smart.
SUPFEMALE:Just like you.
LEADFEMALE:Kenny wanted the girl with back.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, look, Kenny's a special case.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton wanted the same girl.
LEADMALE:Well, see, Carlton's a basket case.
SUPFEMALE:What about all the boys in the hall yesterday?
LEADMALE:See, Ashley
LEADFEMALE:And all the guys in the beer commercials?
LEADMALE:Look, Ashley
LEADMALE:And all the guys who ask Hilary out.
SUPFEMALE:Look, all right, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ashley, I can't lie to you, all right? Some guys don't know what's special about a woman.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, a lot of guys don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Well, really, damn near all guys don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Ashley, there's still some guys that appreciate quality, you know? And you're quality.
SUPFEMALE:You don't got to do all this.
LEADMALE:Just work on being you.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you, the right guy will come along.
LEADFEMALE:I promise you.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Have your people call my people.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll do lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Give Mama a kiss, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really glad you're my cousin.
LEADFEMALE:Mama know.
LEADFEMALE:Go on, girl.
LEADMALE:Veronica you know, I've thought about what you said yesterday and you know, I just wanted to tell you, you was right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry about the way I behaved and I'd be real grateful if I could have your number, so I could call you.
OTHERMALE:That's really nice.
SUPFEMALE:What did I say? What did you say? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You thought over what I said, and I was right.
SUPFEMALE:What did you agree with? Yo, it was deep.
OTHERMALE:I agreed with all of it.
LEADMALE:You have no idea what I said, do you? Wait, hold up, girl, you tripping.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what you said.
LEADMALE:You, you 'Cause we was right here.
SUPMALE:You said that people who live in glass cribs shouldn't throw hard stuff.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:"Let your smile be your umbrella"? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Who cares what you said, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I'm saying I'm trying to be with you.
SUPFEMALE:That's the first honest thing you said to me.
LEADMALE:That's like a good thing, right? That's a very good thing.
SUPMALE:That's what I'm saying! Write down your number! You can't get it yet.
LEADFEMALE:But I've got your number.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hold up.
LEADMALE:Am I as superficial as all those guys I warned Ashley about? I mean could it be that I'm more obsessed with breasts and thighs than Colonel Sanders ever was? Mightn't I be able to look deeper? I mean, to cherish women as full and complete and complex individuals.
SUPFEMALE:And with this new understanding to finally find and keep this true love that eludes so many of us.
LEADFEMALE:Nah! Yo, baby, I know your feet must be tired 'cause you been running through my mind all day.
SUPFEMALE:Come here, girl! How are we supposed to translate Cicero with a bunch of girls glossing their hair, and glossing their lips and messing up lines and just trying to cover it, but not being able to do it.
LEADMALE:Now, we got a lot of women in the audience.
LEADMALE:Any of y'all ever glossed your hair? Because I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe it's a new cu/t thing or something, that / don't know about.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:These kids have got to be more sensitive to these bills.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, look at them, they're Out of sight.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, stop looking at my chest.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
SUPMALE:It's just that ever since you've been pregnant they're back.
SUPFEMALE:Is that all I am to you is a bustline? I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Did you say something, honey?
LEADFEMALE:Hey, morning, y'all.
SUPMALE:Hey, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, check this out, Aunt Viv.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? I learned in biology class that, you know, babies can respond to music while they still in the womb.
LEADMALE:You know, like when you was carrying Carlton you kept listening to /t's a Sma// Wor/d After A//? Oh, the baby's kicking.
SUPFEMALE:Who's that singing? Just a little Heavy D for Heavy V.
LEADMALE:Will, it's bad enough you have an influence on Ashley.
LEADMALE:Hands off the fetus.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look, well, come on, can we at least make the kid be righteous? You know, like let him have an African name like Brother Outaphilia.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hey, check it out, I got him a gift.
OTHERFEMALE:Little itty-bitty X cap.
LEADFEMALE:Little teeny-weeny Doc Martens.
LEADFEMALE:Too cool for pre-school, right? Will, honey, why all this sudden interest in the baby? Well, I mean I've been able to save Ashley, but as far as your other two kids Let's just say they a couple of wings short of a bucket.
OTHERFEMALE:Just one minute, there is nothing wrong with Hilary and Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, how do you expect me to support myself if you don't increase your credit card limit.
LEADMALE:Dad, I decided to throw caution to the wind.
SUPMALE:V-neck! Coincidence? I think not.
SUPMALE:Allow me.
LEADMALE:Dad, I'd like to try something out on you.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, please.
LEADMALE:Do I have to sit through your Urkel impression again? Maybe later, but right now I've been reading this book on negotiating
LEADFEMALE:and I'd like to practice my technique.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna look you straight in the eye and ask you again.
SUPFEMALE:No, and get some Binaca.
LEADMALE:Come on, big guy, work with me.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like a raise in my allowance.
SUPMALE:All right, how much?
SUPFEMALE:$75,000.
LEADMALE:Are you insane?
LEADFEMALE:The book says start high.
LEADFEMALE:And obviously you are.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you $3 more a week.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, thanks, Dad.
LEADMALE:Now I can stop taking money from your wallet.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, Margo, I can't make the Neiman sale.
LEADFEMALE:No, now that I'm living on my own I have to do my own grocery shopping.
OTHERMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Okay, bye.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, honey, I'm really proud of you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think you've ever gone grocery shopping.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess it's time I spread my wings.
LEADFEMALE:This is the last time I shop here for fruit.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's okay, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to carry it, I'm a big girl.
OTHERMALE:Let go, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Do your own shopping.
LEADMALE:Dad, if you'd put a bell around her neck we'd at least know when she was coming.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Okey-dokey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary, you're a 23-year-old woman living in your parents' pool house.
LEADMALE:You haven't had a job in over two months.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you have to say for yourself?
LEADMALE:I'm not pregnant.
SUPFEMALE:Honey Sweetheart I don't want to be too hard on you.
LEADFEMALE:The hell I don't.
SUPFEMALE:Get a job.
LEADMALE:Why don't you just beat me with a wire hanger? Yo, yo, my posse, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:In less than five minutes, yours truly is going to be on the 6:00 news.
SUPFEMALE:And without handcuffs.
OTHERMALE:What, they use the old choke hold? This I got to see.
OTHERMALE:No, no, it was a peaceful protest.
LEADFEMALE:Would even made Gandhi proud.
LEADMALE:You know, except we went out for burgers afterwards.
LEADMALE:Well, what were you protesting, Will? Well, you know, the city wants to tear down the rec center on Pico so a couple of us got together, started a petition.
OTHERMALE:You know, we get enough signatures, we might be able to save it.
SUPMALE:So, when did you become so socially conscious? Well, you know, I play ball down there, and plus it's good for the community.
LEADFEMALE:And there's also this girl down there on the swim team.
LEADFEMALE:She teaching me the breaststroke.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, you guys, the news is starting.
SUPFEMALE:Tear it down.
OTHERFEMALE:Save the rec.
LEADFEMALE:Save the rec.
OTHERMALE:Tear it down.
LEADMALE:/'m standing outside the LA Recreationa/ Center on Pico Bou/evard.
LEADFEMALE:The peop/e you see behind me a// have one thing in common.
LEADMALE:Yeah, polyester.
LEADMALE:Except for that guy holding the microphone.
LEADMALE:He's kind of cute.
LEADFEMALE:I wonder why I've never seen him before.
LEADFEMALE:Probably 'cause this is the news and he's never been on Studs.
SUPMALE:Doesn't matter.
LEADFEMALE:He wouldn't be interested in me anyway.
SUPFEMALE:I have no job.
OTHERFEMALE:I have no self-esteem.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm nobody.
LEADMALE:Shut up! We're trying to hear the TV.
OTHERFEMALE:This p/ace is a magnet for urban decay.
LEADMALE:/'ve been mugged here twice.
OTHERFEMALE:/ say tear the sucker down.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, not everyone fe/t the same way.
LEADMALE:Here we go, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:/'m for the rec center because that's where / do most of my rec centering.
OTHERMALE:And when /'m not down with R-E-C, /'m down with R-A-P.
LEADFEMALE:When / got home /ate from the grocery store Mama said, "Lock him out!" Now / know why Pops had to go 'Cause Mama is way whacked out! Mama is way whacked out! Good /uck, homey.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe that mess.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's the same thing every time they interview a black person on TV.
SUPMALE:They either singing or dancing.
LEADFEMALE:And they got curlers in their head or out of activator.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Will, that really makes you think.
SUPMALE:What's activator? Come on, man, you saw that story.
LEADMALE:I mean, that ain't fair! Life isn't fair, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, was it fair when Bambi's mother died? Or is it fair that the coyote still can't catch the roadrunner? Or how about Roger Rabbit? How did he get a babe like that? You know, Carlton, you're right.
SUPMALE:Life isn't fair.
LEADMALE:Because if it was, then your legs wouldn't be shorter than your arms.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, good morning.
LEADMALE:Hi, Carla, any calls? Just another Ionely white woman wanting to sleep with you.
SUPFEMALE:Carla, that is very unprofessional.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, how do you know she's white?
LEADMALE:She's my mother.
SUPMALE:Oh, forget it, Will.
LEADMALE:Trevor's not gonna be interested in some unemployed freeloader.
LEADFEMALE:Now, come on, Hil, look, your job is not your identity.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you got a lot of other things going for you.
LEADMALE:Like what?
LEADFEMALE:Well, like the fact that you're Well, well, you know that you're y our hat always matches your shoes.
OTHERFEMALE:Talk about missing the obvious.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, miss last night this station did the crazy hatchet job on the rec center and I want to talk to somebody about it right now.
SUPMALE:That would be our producer, Howard, but he doesn't talk to the viewing public.
OTHERMALE:It causes his ulcer to bleed.
SUPMALE:Howard, there's someone here to see you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:No, thank you.
SUPMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERFEMALE:What? There's Trevor.
LEADMALE:Oops! I dropped my wallet.
SUPMALE:Could you get that for me, please? Look, if your horny friend wants to meet Trevor, he's down the hall to the right.
OTHERMALE:But you'll have to fight my mother for him.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Somebody here to see me, Carla?
SUPMALE:An angry viewer.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to lunch.
LEADMALE:See you tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Look, kid, I've got an emergency here.
LEADMALE:I've got to find a new weather man.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, look, I just need 30 seconds on the air to talk about why the rec center shouldn't be torn down.
OTHERMALE:Ethnic is definitely a way to go.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, come on, man, look, this ain't about color.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I ain't just some young rapper trying to get on TV, man.
LEADFEMALE:Great legs.
SUPMALE:Thanks a lot, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, but, look, I ain't dancing either.
SUPMALE:Come on, this is serious.
OTHERMALE:Look, kid, I gotta run.
SUPFEMALE:All right, look, I'll dance, just no tap, all right? Maybe Mike here can help you.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
SUPFEMALE:Mike, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
LEADFEMALE:I need 30 seconds on the air to talk about why the rec center shouldn't be torn down.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you help me? I'm 60 and I'm pushing a mail cart.
LEADFEMALE:Do I look like I can help you? Excuse me.
LEADMALE:I'm Howard, the producer of News and Action.
LEADFEMALE:Could you do that again?
SUPMALE:Do what? Stand like you were before on your toes.
LEADMALE:Only this time I'd like you to point.
SUPFEMALE:Incredible! How would you like to be a weather girl? I don't know the first thing about weather.
LEADFEMALE:Sure you do.
OTHERFEMALE:What happens when it rains?
LEADMALE:You send Geoffrey out to get the car.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, yo, man.
LEADMALE:Look, I don't appreciate being played off like this, right? This is 'cause I'm black, right? That's why you won't put me on the air.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I'm on to your little scheme and that one black anchor you got just ain't gonna cut it.
OTHERMALE:That's why I'm making her our new weather girl.
LEADMALE:I love a screamer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Will, this is all thanks to you.
SUPFEMALE:I owe you big time.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Hil, this is great.
SUPMALE:Now you can put me on the air.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:What experience do you have? It's 'cause I'm black.
LEADFEMALE:That's what the thing is.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, yo, I don't believe this.
LEADMALE:The news station won't let me come on to talk about the petition.
LEADFEMALE:Will, Will, Will.
SUPMALE:Haven't you learned anything living with me the past two years? What, you mean other than the words to Mandy? I'm talking about The Art of Negotiation and I'll be glad to share my wisdom with you.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:Last time you shared something with me I was on antibiotics for two weeks.
SUPMALE:Hi, boys.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what's going on, Uncle Phil? So, Will.
LEADMALE:Have any luck down at the news station? No, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:It was kind of weird, too.
LEADFEMALE:It was like no matter how much sense I was making, the dude wouldn't listen.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, it was almost like a discrimination type thing or something.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I wish I knew a lawyer.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? You know me.
LEADMALE:You?
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:No, Uncle Phil, I mean, you're this big-time lawyer and everything.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you ain't got time to help us little guys fight the system.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, now, you did back in the day though.
OTHERMALE:You was the man back then.
OTHERMALE:But, you know, now Don't even worry about it, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:It's all right.
LEADMALE:We sha// overcome Wait a minute, Will, who'd you meet with down there at the station? Some producer named Howard, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I think it's time you and I pay Howard another visit.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, sir, it is.
SUPMALE:Nobody pushes my nephew around
LEADFEMALE:and gets away with it.
SUPFEMALE:No, sir, they do not.
LEADMALE:I will slap that place with so many class-action suits they won't know what hit them.
LEADFEMALE:We//
LEADMALE:Come on! Hi, everyone.
LEADMALE:Did Will tell you the good news?
LEADFEMALE:What?
SUPMALE:I got a job.
SUPMALE:Hallelujah!
OTHERFEMALE:Praise Jesus, let's go, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Now, it's not every day that my little baby gets a job.
LEADFEMALE:So, what will you be doing?
LEADMALE:Okay, try to guess.
LEADFEMALE:A limo will pick me up and take me home.
SUPMALE:I'll make lots of money, and I'll only have to work an hour a day.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God! She's gonna be a hooker! No, you idiot.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna be a weather girl.
LEADFEMALE:That is so great.
SUPMALE:Get going, let's go, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:What a surprise! You know, I didn't even know you were up for the job.
LEADMALE:Well, I wasn't.
SUPFEMALE:It's all thanks to Will.
SUPFEMALE:Unlike you who kicked me when I was down Will took me by the hand and led me to the news station to meet Trevor Collins.
LEADMALE:And, while I was there this guy, Howard, offered me the job.
SUPMALE:I love Howard.
LEADMALE:Whoa, whoa, Uncle Phil, come on, remember Howard's the enemy.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Howard's a god.
OTHERMALE:He performed a miracle.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary's working.
LEADMALE:With any luck, she'll be off my property before I'm dead.
LEADFEMALE:So, sweetheart, tell me about this Howard.
SUPFEMALE:Does he like cashmere? My man, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:What's up with this negotiating thing, man? Hop on one foot and say, "Carlton is king.
LEADFEMALE:" You know, I got a better idea.
SUPMALE:How about I squeeze your neck till your head pops off? See, you're negotiating already.
SUPFEMALE:You guys are the greatest.
LEADMALE:Thanks for making sure I got here okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Hil, that's what family's for.
SUPMALE:And besides, we never would have gotten past security without you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't understand.
OTHERMALE:We were counting on that.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Carla, any calls? All right, come on, man, let's break.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna demand to get on the air.
SUPFEMALE:Will, has all that hot sauce finally gone to your brain? Look, there's a right way to negotiate and a wrong way.
LEADMALE:Observe the right way.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, I'm here to see Howard.
OTHERFEMALE:Your name?
LEADFEMALE:Bryant.
LEADFEMALE:Bryant Gumbel.
OTHERMALE:And I'm Patti LaBelle.
SUPFEMALE:Beat it.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Patti, you seem like a no-nonsense kind of slimmy, right? So, I'm gonna give it to you straight.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you gotta lie to get what you want.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't you watch the Republican convention? Carlton, don't make me come down there.
LEADMALE:Look, it's like this.
LEADFEMALE:I need 30 seconds on the air to talk about why the rec center shouldn't be torn down and I don't care if I gotta force my way on the set to get it.
SUPMALE:Let me get this straight.
SUPMALE:You want to storm the set, disrupt a live newscast and jeopardize the credibility of this station.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Will you be needing wardrobe? Five minutes to air, everybody.
LEADMALE:Oh, Hilary, before you go on I'm going to tell you the same thing I told Dan Rather.
LEADMALE:Wet your lips.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:So, how do you like the jacket?
SUPMALE:Incredible.
LEADFEMALE:Makes me look really buffed.
LEADFEMALE:It sure does.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, I'm Hilary Banks, I'm your new weather girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, welcome aboard.
LEADMALE:You know the last person who had your job was really special to me.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna miss Lou.
SUPFEMALE:I thought his name was Jack.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever.
LEADMALE:Wow! I know.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, I'm Trevor Collins and these are my real teeth.
LEADMALE:Wow!
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:My God, you have incredible eyes.
OTHERFEMALE:Really?
SUPMALE:Yes, I can see myself in them.
LEADMALE:Don't blink.
SUPFEMALE:And to conclude our story on the homeless I'd like to leave you with something a young girl named Dorothy once said "There's no place like home, Auntie Em "there's no place like home.
LEADMALE:" Trevor.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, on a brighter note, Jack, our weather man, died.
SUPMALE:So, it is now with great pleasure that I introduce the newest addition to the News and Action team, Hilary Banks.
LEADMALE:How's it looking for tonight?
SUPMALE:Very promising.
LEADMALE:Here in Southern California, we're experiencing a warm front with increasing humidity.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, girls, it's a frizzy-hair day.
SUPMALE:Looking at the nation, oh Looking at the nation, there's a cold front blowing in from the Atlantic with a high probability of rain in the Midwest.
LEADMALE:The South, however, will enjoy pleasant and sunny weather.
SUPMALE:So, if you're planning on going to the beaches, remember you can help keep America beautiful with two simple words Jenny Craig.
SUPMALE:Now, let's go look at our big board for the local weather for the week.
OTHERMALE:Will! That's right, Will Smith here on community feedback.
SUPFEMALE:Today's topic is the petition to save the Los Angeles Rec Center.
LEADFEMALE:See, the rec center for a lot of us is, you know, it's like a home away from home.
SUPMALE:The people down there, they understand us and they help keep us out of trouble.
LEADFEMALE:Just hand me the mike and we'll pretend this never happened.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God, can we get a close-up? I am so choked up at this moment.
SUPFEMALE:Howard, the producer, has just asked me if he can sign the petition live on the air.
OTHERFEMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:And, of course, the answer is yes.
LEADFEMALE:Talk about a leader.
OTHERMALE:Talk about a man that's here to support his community.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Howard.
LEADMALE:Now for those of you that want to follow in Howard's footsteps there's still time.
OTHERFEMALE:You can get down to the LA Rec Center and sign a petition and show our kids that we really care.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, as I can see, my time has run out.
SUPMALE:Trevor.
LEADMALE:No wonder they love me, man.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you for that commentary and please remember to put back my blazer.
SUPMALE:Hilary, thank you for that delightful forecast.
OTHERMALE:We will certainly be looking forward to seeing more of your warm front.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, the warm front.
LEADFEMALE:Well, from all of us here on News and Action good night and Godspeed.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Will.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's going on, Hil? Why aren't you in bed? Uncle Phil saw the news and he threatened to kill me in my sleep.
SUPMALE:That's nice.
SUPFEMALE:With a big butcher knife.
LEADMALE:Good for you.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, your hair's on fire.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:You know, Will, life doesn't get any better than this.
SUPMALE:I mean, I have a great job, I met a great guy and I have the thinnest ankles of any girl I know.
LEADMALE:So, you mean you're not mad at me for messing up your first day? Of course not.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have got the job in the first place.
OTHERMALE:Thanks a lot, Hil.
LEADMALE:I'm proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm kind of proud of myself.
LEADMALE:For the first time I feel like I know what it means to be an independent woman.
LEADMALE:I think I'm gonna go back to my little pool house and toast myself with a glass of champagne.
SUPMALE:Good night, Hil.
LEADMALE:Good night, Will.
SUPMALE:Good night, Trevor.
LEADFEMALE:Good night and Godspeed.
LEADFEMALE:Well, for all of us here at News and Action good night and Godspeed.
LEADMALE:Another one in the can.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, you're in awe of me, aren't you?
SUPFEMALE:I am.
SUPMALE:You're the best.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a god.
SUPFEMALE:You're very good.
OTHERFEMALE:Exce/ente.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Cut.
LEADFEMALE:Pretty good.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Well, how do I look? Whoa, man.
LEADMALE:You know that model in all them Hugo Boss ads?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You don't look nothing like him.
LEADFEMALE:You're just jealous because the love of my life has returned.
LEADFEMALE:In Cindy, I have found the woman I'd share the rest of my life with.
OTHERMALE:You've never even found a woman you'd share a burrito with.
SUPFEMALE:Earth to Carlton, but Cindy dumped you, man.
SUPMALE:She didn't dump me, Will.
SUPFEMALE:She was just working through a fear of intimacy caused by an overpowering father and a narcissistic mother.
LEADMALE:Sure it wasn't your breath? Oh, look, hors d'oeuvres.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it great to be rich? Hands off.
LEADFEMALE:They're for Cindy.
OTHERFEMALE:Cindy? Isn't she the one who dumped you? Carlton, why are you wearing a suit? Is Daddy bringing home white people?
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Cindy's coming over.
SUPMALE:Cindy? I thought she dumped you.
OTHERMALE:Okay, okay, she dumped me but now that she's back, I'm not gonna let her go.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna prove to her that I'm ready for an adult, mature relationship.
OTHERMALE:Door! Door! Door! All right, don't wet yourself.
LEADMALE:I'll get it.
SUPMALE:God, I'm a wreck.
LEADMALE:Carlton.
LEADMALE:Cindy.
LEADFEMALE:I have something that belongs to you.
LEADFEMALE:Say hello to Daddy.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:G, hurry up with that water, man.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, wake up.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, come on, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Congratulations, man.
OTHERFEMALE:He's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, come on, man.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, a father? He won't even let Ken and Barbie sleep in the same shoebox.
LEADFEMALE:You and Cindy? I mean, come on.
SUPMALE:Hey, the longest relationship Carlton ever had was with last year's Ebony swimsuit issue.
LEADFEMALE:This isn't a joke.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, doesn't he look just like Carlton? Well, it looks like they wear the same size.
OTHERMALE:Can I hold him?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, here you are.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he is so cute.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Get this drool machine away from me.
LEADMALE:Hey, can I? Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:What up, dude? Boy, when Mom and Dad see this, somebody's gonna swing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I can assure you, it won't be me.
SUPMALE:This time, the butler didn't do it hasn't done it and I'd be surprised if he even remembered how to do it.
SUPMALE:Philip, I am never wearing a bathing suit again, as long as I live.
OTHERMALE:Now, honey, I'm sure the pool man didn't really mistake you for me.
LEADMALE:He called me Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:That's still no reason to hold his head underwater, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:I'll get you some antacid for that.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't.
SUPFEMALE:That wasn't me.
SUPMALE:Cindy.
LEADMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:And Mrs.
OTHERMALE:Banks.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:How long has it been? Well, I'd take a shot in the dark and say around nine months.
LEADMALE:Whose is that? He's mine.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my goodness.
LEADMALE:He's adorable.
SUPMALE:Come here, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Oh, my.
LEADFEMALE:What's his name? Carlton.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Please tell me your father's first name is Carlton.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, wrong answer.
SUPFEMALE:Now, for those of you just tuning in to Name That Father this little bundle of joy belongs to a young man who's seen Litt/e Mermaid eight times.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton are you the father? Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton!
LEADFEMALE:Vivian.
LEADMALE:Honey, honey.
LEADMALE:Back off, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:I am having a mother-son moment.
LEADMALE:Carlton, how could you do this to us?
LEADMALE:Vivian, step away from the boy.
LEADMALE:Now, look, we're going to have to talk about this in private.
LEADFEMALE:Not you, stupid.
LEADMALE:Sit your butt down.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'll take care of this, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that's it.
LEADMALE:Move it along, party's over.
LEADMALE:Nothing to see here.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Pep it up, little grey man.
LEADFEMALE:Man, I thought they'd never leave.
SUPFEMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I'm just gonna Look, I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
OTHERFEMALE:Sweetheart, you show up here with a baby that you say is my son's and you didn't mean to cause any trouble.
LEADMALE:Where do you think you are, Fantasy /s/and? Watch out how you talk to the mother of my son.
LEADFEMALE:Sir.
LEADMALE:Carlton, do you realize what you're saying? He is Carlton's baby.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll believe that when I see a blood test.
SUPFEMALE:It's the truth, whether you want to believe it or not.
LEADFEMALE:I love Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll tell you something else.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton is the most incredible lover I have ever had.
OTHERMALE:Oh, God.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he's so in tune with my needs.
LEADFEMALE:It was amazing, and endless, and magnificent.
SUPMALE:I think I saw God.
LEADFEMALE:The windows.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I fell.
LEADMALE:We didn't mean to.
OTHERFEMALE:I fell.
SUPMALE:I fell.
OTHERMALE:Carlton, I am so disappointed in you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, why didn't you come to us first? Honey, we could have counseled you.
LEADMALE:Or at least had you neutered.
LEADFEMALE:Cindy, honey, I don't understand.
OTHERFEMALE:If you knew this was Carlton's son, why did you leave? Because I knew that a baby could ruin his life but I did feel that he deserved to see his son and that's why I came.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you for stopping by.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:Cindy, honey, I think we need to talk to your parents about this.
LEADFEMALE:That won't do any good.
SUPFEMALE:They don't want to have anything to do with me.
OTHERFEMALE:They threw you out? Where are you going to stay? Mommy?
LEADMALE:Well, you could stay with us.
SUPFEMALE:No! At least, until after the blood test.
SUPMALE:I couldn't impose.
LEADMALE:Oh, we understand.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I hear Ramada Inn has a wonderful pool.
LEADFEMALE:Cindy, please stay.
LEADMALE:We want you to, okay? Carlton will show you to the guest room and there's no need to wake the baby.
LEADMALE:You know it's like the Rodney King videotape, you know? I just keep seeing it over, and over, and over again.
SUPMALE:And I ask myself, where did I fail him, you know? Where did we go wrong? Hey, Mom, guess who? No, it's Will.
LEADMALE:Will Smith.
LEADMALE:Hey, yo, Mom, check it out.
OTHERMALE:It is some drama cutting loose out here.
LEADMALE:No, I'm not in trouble, but, no, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Somebody we know is a grandma.
SUPMALE:No, not you, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, stop crying.
SUPFEMALE:Stop crying.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, no, it's not me.
LEADMALE:It's Carlton is the father.
SUPMALE:Stop laughing, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that will be a large pepperoni with extra cheese.
LEADMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:That makes them bring it faster.
LEADMALE:Give me the phone, Will.
LEADFEMALE:This time Cindy's parents are going to talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, honey, just be calm.
OTHERMALE:Now, I'm sure they're lovely people.
SUPFEMALE:Just because they let their daughter run wild and take advantage of our only son and flush his life down the toilet
OTHERFEMALE:Give me the damn phone, Philip.
LEADMALE:Vivian! Vivian, sweetheart, I'll handle it.
SUPMALE:Yes, hello.
LEADMALE:Yeah, don't you dare try to hang up on me.
LEADMALE:What kind of lowlifes are you throwing a minor out onto the street and endangering a helpless infant? Well, I'm going to do everything I can to see you behind bars.
LEADFEMALE:And what do you have to say for yourself? So when will your mommy and daddy be home? Here we come, ready or not.
SUPFEMALE:Super, huh? Look, matching hats.
OTHERMALE:I never knew having a family could be so neat.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too.
LEADFEMALE:All right, whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like to take this opportunity to bring it to everyone's attention that Uncle Phil's head is about to explode and, for once, it ain't my fault.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I think it's time for little Carlton's nap.
LEADMALE:Yeah, it smells like you needs to be changed, too.
OTHERMALE:I'll miss you, honey.
SUPMALE:Miss you, too.
OTHERMALE:Isn't she something?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, she sure is and Monday, after the blood test proves the baby's not yours she'll be out of here on the first thing smoking.
LEADMALE:Dad, the baby's mine.
LEADMALE:Carlton, honey, suppose the baby is yours.
LEADFEMALE:Now, being a teenage parent is a very big responsibility, honey and you have already proven yourself irresponsible otherwise, you wouldn't be in this situation.
LEADMALE:How are you going to feed this baby? Where are you going to live? How are you going to educate it? Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean, you're not going to take care of us?
SUPMALE:Hold me back, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, get out.
LEADFEMALE:Get out, now.
SUPMALE:Go.
LEADMALE:Hey, I got him, but take another step, and I'll fill you full of potassium.
SUPMALE:Master William, might I see you for a moment? Yeah, sure.
OTHERFEMALE:What's up, G? Well, it's such a beautiful night.
LEADMALE:I thought you might like to see the moon.
SUPFEMALE:Go easy on the poor little pinhead.
LEADMALE:Are you climbing down Rapunzel's extensions? I don't want Mom and Dad to know.
SUPFEMALE:To know what?
LEADFEMALE:Cindy and I are driving to Lompoc.
LEADFEMALE:No, Carlton, nobody drives to Lompoc.
SUPFEMALE:You drive through Lompoc.
SUPMALE:No, but there's a chapel.
SUPFEMALE:We're eloping.
LEADMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:No, Will, I don't want to hear it.
LEADMALE:I'm tired of everyone telling me what to do.
SUPFEMALE:I love Cindy, and I've made up my mind.
LEADMALE:All right, man, fine.
SUPFEMALE:Look, whatever you want to do is fine with me.
SUPMALE:What? I said, whatever you want to do is fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:If you want to marry Cindy, go ahead.
OTHERMALE:Just do me a favor.
LEADFEMALE:Sleep on it tonight.
SUPMALE:In the morning, if you feel the same way then, whatever you want to do.
OTHERMALE:Deal?
OTHERMALE:Deal.
OTHERMALE:My man.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, give me your car keys.
LEADMALE:You know, Will, I gave you my word.
LEADMALE:I'd think that'd be enough.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you lucky I ain't going to do you like Kunta Kinte and chop off your foot.
LEADMALE:Your cheesecake, sir.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, would you get Carlton, please?
LEADMALE:Certainly, sir.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Run, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Fetch, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:Perhaps you'd like me to catch a Frisbee in my teeth?
SUPMALE:Hey, y'all.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, freeze! Just where have you been?
LEADFEMALE:To the refrigerator.
SUPFEMALE:At this hour? It's 8:00.
OTHERMALE:Philip, look at us.
LEADMALE:We are really overreacting.
SUPFEMALE:This is Will.
LEADMALE:There's no such thing as overreacting.
LEADFEMALE:Frisk him.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Adolph, Eva, why don't you all relax for a second.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, where's Carlton? I'm sorry, sir, but he's not in his room but the trip wasn't a total loss.
LEADFEMALE:I found $1.
LEADMALE:25 under his bed.
LEADMALE:Who knew Christmas would come twice this year? Geoffrey, did you check Cindy's room? The girl hasn't a penny to her name.
LEADMALE:Will, where's Carlton? I don't know, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Did you check the cracks in the couch? Will, you know something? Come on, Uncle Phil does this look like the face of a dude that knows something? He's got a point there, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe we should call Carlton's friends.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADMALE:I'll call one, you call the other.
LEADMALE:Number 52.
SUPFEMALE:Well, we're next, my little bride-to-be.
OTHERMALE:Carlton I hope you don't feel like I pressured you into this.
LEADMALE:I mean, you are glad we're getting married, right? Glad? Cindy, I've been in love with you ever since the third grade.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I used to go to sleep at night and dream about the day we'd be married.
LEADFEMALE:Do you really mean that, Carlton?
OTHERMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:We're going to have such a wonderful life.
LEADMALE:I mean, we'll have to live in a trailer at first but I'll get a job during the days, and I'll work nights, too as soon as I lick that pesky fear of the dark thing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, Carlton, I was thinking that I would get a job, too.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPMALE:No wife of mine is going to have to work.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you can stay home and take care of the kids.
LEADMALE:Exactly how many kids? Well, you know what they say, eight is enough.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Carlton, I need to
LEADMALE:Would you watch the baby for a minute?
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:Please, sweetie, please don't cry.
SUPFEMALE:Here comes little Mr.
SUPMALE:Ducky.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't he quack you up? Wow! If I could pass like that, they wouldn't make me play on the girl's team.
SUPFEMALE:They'll throw us out.
LEADFEMALE:That's my boy.
OTHERMALE:"And if there's anyone here "who feels this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony "let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
LEADMALE:" Stop, man, don't do it! You don't even know if the baby is yours!
SUPFEMALE:How did you know I'm having a baby?
SUPFEMALE:What? You having a baby? Yo, hey, look, my fault.
LEADFEMALE:You all, see, my cousin was supposed Hey, congratulations, man.
SUPMALE:So you're having his baby? What a wonderful way to say how much I love you, huh? You're too late, Will.
SUPMALE:Oh, man, you did it? Tell me you didn't do it.
LEADFEMALE:God, please tell me you didn't marry her.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't marry her.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:You the man.
LEADFEMALE:She left me.
LEADFEMALE:I got the feeling she didn't want to live with me.
SUPMALE:What made you think that?
SUPFEMALE:She said she didn't want to live with me.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, I mean, she can't just walk out on you like that.
SUPFEMALE:What if the kid is yours?
OTHERMALE:He's not.
SUPMALE:Carlton, come on, just because the baby is cute doesn't mean you're not the father.
LEADFEMALE:I never slept with her.
OTHERMALE:Look, since we're in a church, I feel the need to confess something.
SUPFEMALE:Please don't laugh.
LEADFEMALE:This is really hard for me to say.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a y ou a German? No.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a virgin.
SUPMALE:What? I'm a virgin! It's nice to know somebody still is.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look, Carlton, man, I mean, I didn't know.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, hey, don't feel bad though.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, a lot of guys are you know, Germans.
LEADMALE:Will, I feel so unused.
SUPMALE:I mean, promise me you won't tell anyone.
LEADMALE:Hey, Carlton, come on, man, you ain't got nothing to be ashamed of.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, everybody talks about how much pressure there is on girls to have sex.
LEADMALE:I mean, there's pressure on us, too.
OTHERMALE:That's why we lie about it.
LEADMALE:You lie about it? You mean you're a virgin, too? Keep your voice down, man.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't no virgin! Sorry.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, man, when it comes to me and the honeys, I just say no way.
LEADMALE:Yucky.
SUPMALE:Will, I'm really gonna miss her.
LEADMALE:Where did she go?
SUPMALE:Back to her parents.
LEADFEMALE:When she called and told them she was going to marry me they came and got her.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, Carlton, man, they're wrong about you.
LEADFEMALE:You're a great guy, man.
OTHERMALE:Hey, look, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go home, so you can get in trouble.
LEADMALE:And don't worry about it, man.
LEADFEMALE:I mean one day the right girl's going to come along and, I mean, you won't be a German forever, you know? Good, 'cause I'm really looking forward to losing my accent.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, don't you dare try to hang up on me.
SUPMALE:Now, who do you think you are? What kind of lowlifes are you people to throw a helpless minor out onto the street with a helpless infant? I'll call you back.
SUPMALE:Who are you people, to talk to my uncle like that
LEADMALE:with a helpless infant
SUPMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:and helpless actors?
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:With all these helpless people.
OTHERMALE:Okay, here.
LEADFEMALE:This is it.
LEADMALE:Will somebody please help us? 
OTHERMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, how're you doing, Lindsey?
SUPFEMALE:Are you going to the Lakers game? I wish.
LEADMALE:I don't have no tickets.
LEADMALE:Isn't that a coincidence? Here I am with two tickets to the Lakers game, and no one to go with.
LEADMALE:You enjoy yourself tonight, all right? Too bad you can't make it.
LEADFEMALE:The seats are center court.
LEADMALE:We can go in my dad's limo and I have passes to the after-game party
OTHERMALE:but, yeah, well.
LEADMALE:Wait, wait.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Who am I to be so selfish? What do you say you pick me up around 8:00? Just for tonight, how about you let your buns down? Geoffrey, you look great today.
LEADMALE:Have you done something different with your hair? Yes.
OTHERMALE:I stopped pulling it out.
SUPFEMALE:What are you selling? Okay, I'm hawking candy bars.
OTHERFEMALE:They're only $5.
LEADFEMALE:Marvelous.
LEADFEMALE:With what I'm paid I should be able to afford one by the end of the day.
LEADMALE:You poor, pathetic gigolo.
SUPMALE:How could any self-respecting man sell himself so cheap? Like I don't hear enough of that from my mother.
LEADMALE:I was talking to Will.
SUPFEMALE:Of course.
SUPMALE:Why would anyone talk to me? I am but a poor, lowly servant.
SUPMALE:Carlton, I'm saying, what's your damage, man? I mean, Lindsey just can't resist me.
OTHERMALE:It's just a Laker game, you know? Hey, besides, you know what they say about guys with big ears? They can fly? Vivian, I don't want to talk about this anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, I don't see why you don't want to run.
LEADFEMALE:He's probably afraid he'll crack the concrete.
SUPMALE:Will, the Allied Political Coalition just asked your uncle
SUPMALE:to run for Superior Court Judge.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Those imbeciles are trying to railroad Judge Robertson off the bench.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't believe that.
LEADFEMALE:Judge Robertson? They had the audacity to try to do that to Judge Robertson? Who the hell is Judge Robertson? He was your uncle's mentor and quite a colorful person.
LEADFEMALE:He was a little bit eccentric.
LEADFEMALE:But he taught me the true meaning of the word "justice.
LEADFEMALE:" There were times I didn't think I was going to make it through school, but he wouldn't let me quit.
SUPMALE:I never would have gotten through law school without him.
LEADMALE:What'd he do? Have the halls widened? That was a good one.
LEADFEMALE:For your information he taught me not only the spirit, but the letter of the law.
OTHERFEMALE:God bless him.
LEADMALE:And I consider it an insult for anyone to try to get him out of office.
SUPMALE:What do you think, Will? I think I should have never said nothing about them halls.
LEADFEMALE:So did everybody watch LA's favorite weather girl today? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I was the bright spot, as usual.
SUPMALE:I wore my new Versace.
LEADMALE:So what's the weather going to be like tomorrow, honey? What am I, psychic? Oh, please, let me get it this time.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary.
LEADMALE:You look so beautiful today.
OTHERFEMALE:I was born beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:What are you selling?
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I'll give you 10o/o off.
SUPFEMALE:I'll take two.
SUPFEMALE:Master William, Miss Lindsey to see you.
LEADFEMALE:Miss Lindsey, this is most inappropriate.
SUPMALE:I couldn't possibly It's Ben.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Lindsey, what are you doing here?
SUPFEMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, that is no way to talk to your guest.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm Vivian, Will's aunt.
OTHERMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:Nice to meet you, too.
LEADMALE:Will, can I talk to you for a minute? Right this way, money Honey.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Lindsey, what's up? I had a great time the other night.
LEADFEMALE:It was magic.
LEADMALE:What did you do?
OTHERFEMALE:I'm talking about us, silly.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want the night to end.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you know, nights do that sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Since we had so much fun the other night, I was wondering if we could spend some time together.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Lindsey.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'd really love to.
LEADFEMALE:I mean but I have obligations.
OTHERMALE:I have commitments.
OTHERMALE:I have a gold watch.
LEADMALE:So how about a little thank-you kiss? Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, G, here's the whipped cream you wanted for dinner.
LEADMALE:Who said it was for dinner? Hey, Carlton, what time is it? I'm sorry, I almost forgot.
LEADFEMALE:I'm only wearing the finest timepiece ever made.
LEADFEMALE:This gold model was handcrafted in Switzerland by the finest of craftsmen.
LEADFEMALE:Keeps time accurate to within three seconds a year.
LEADFEMALE:Love the Casio.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you're nothing more than a trollop a strumpet, a love slave, sans the love.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Carlton, I couldn't hear you.
LEADMALE:My damn watch was just ticking so loud.
LEADFEMALE:You just don't have the fortitude to say no.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, please.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I have no choice.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the chosen one.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, take Moses when he was asked to part the Red Sea, did he say, "No, y'all build a dam"?
OTHERFEMALE:Vivian, do I look okay?
LEADFEMALE:Philip, honey, would you relax?
LEADMALE:We're just having company for dinner.
LEADFEMALE:It's not just company.
SUPMALE:It's Judge Robertson.
SUPFEMALE:He's done so much for me over the years, this is my chance to finally pay him back.
LEADMALE:Baby, we're just having pot roast.
LEADFEMALE:Is the judge here, yet?
SUPMALE:No, honey, not yet.
LEADMALE:Good, then I have plenty of time to plant this.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, what is that?
LEADMALE:It's a bug.
LEADMALE:They gave it to me down at the newsroom.
SUPFEMALE:If I can scoop some dirt on Judge Robertson it could mean a big promotion.
SUPFEMALE:I feel just like Deborah Norville, except I have a job.
OTHERMALE:Hilary, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:This man is our guest.
LEADMALE:Let's just show him the respect he deserves.
OTHERFEMALE:Here comes the judge.
LEADMALE:Here comes the judge.
LEADFEMALE:Order in the court! Here comes the judge.
LEADMALE:It wouldn't kill you to crack a smile, you know.
LEADMALE:Judge Robertson, it's so good to see you, sir.
SUPMALE:It's so easy to see you, Philip.
LEADMALE:Looks like you haven't stepped on the scales of justice in quite some time.
OTHERMALE:Did you hear what he said? He was I'm laughing at something that happened yesterday.
SUPFEMALE:I'm done now.
SUPMALE:I remember you.
SUPFEMALE:You're Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I've known you since you were yea high.
OTHERMALE:Ain't nothing wrong with his memory.
SUPFEMALE:You got that right.
SUPFEMALE:Forget everything you heard about me.
LEADFEMALE:There may be snow on the roof, but there's still fire in the furnace.
LEADFEMALE:And hello, Vivian.
SUPMALE:Philip, your wife gets more youthful with every passing year.
LEADFEMALE:No, excuse me, Judge, no, this is my daughter Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:This is my wife, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:You've aged.
LEADMALE:And what the hell is that you're wearing? Why don't we come over here? Dinner is served.
LEADMALE:Benson.
SUPMALE:I didn't know you were really a butler.
LEADMALE:That Judge Robertson's quite a character.
SUPFEMALE:But, Aunt Viv, how come he keep calling you Weezie? I am sorry, Philip, that man is beyond eccentric.
LEADMALE:I asked him to pass the salt.
SUPFEMALE:He told me to go long.
LEADFEMALE:He was joking, Vivian.
OTHERMALE:Philip, he broke a window.
LEADMALE:He's a sexist pig.
LEADMALE:Hilary, that's not true.
OTHERFEMALE:He's pro-choice.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, he said the only choice a woman should have is with or without the lights on.
SUPMALE:See, now that's disgusting.
LEADMALE:The lights should be off.
OTHERMALE:Believe me, son.
SUPFEMALE:The only time a woman should sit on the bench is when she's waiting for a bus.
OTHERFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
LEADMALE:What if she's serving coleslaw at a picnic? Point taken.
OTHERFEMALE:You have the makings of a fine judge.
LEADMALE:So Judge Robertson you were telling us about your most recent decision.
LEADMALE:Yes, I had this boy before me recently no preponderance of evidence in either way.
SUPFEMALE:It was a tough call, but in the end, I had to convict.
LEADMALE:How did you decide?
LEADMALE:You see, the prosecutor was a babe so after I decided in her favor, she decided in mine.
LEADFEMALE:Lordy, look at the time.
LEADFEMALE:Judge, let me walk you to your car.
LEADFEMALE:Good, maybe you can remember where I parked.
LEADMALE:Hi, Will.
LEADMALE:Lindsey, how you doing? Will, I was wondering, if you'd like to go with me to the autumn dance.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Lindsey, now I mean, you've been very generous, you know, but I just can't Motorcycle helmet.
LEADFEMALE:But, Lindsey, I mean, I can't take Wow, a motorcycle jacket with Malcolm on it.
LEADMALE:I can ride and be righteous at the same time.
SUPMALE:Look, but, Lindsey, I'm sorry
LEADFEMALE:These go to your new Harley-Davidson.
SUPFEMALE:Now what were you gonna say? Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, right, like you wouldn't take it.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:How did this get on the patio?
LEADFEMALE:No, don't worry, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:I was careful when I drove it through the house.
LEADMALE:I mean where did it come from?
LEADMALE:The Harley factory.
SUPMALE:Will, it came from Lindsey, didn't it? Now, what I want to know is what does she get in return? All the rides she wants, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:You are acting like a pimp.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, hold up now.
LEADMALE:That is totally unfair, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:If a man was buying a woman all these gifts nobody would have anything to say about it, right? Honey, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman.
OTHERFEMALE:If you don't care for someone, you shouldn't accept gifts.
SUPMALE:And it diminishes you every time you accept something from Lindsey.
SUPFEMALE:Now you were not raised that way, boy, and you know it.
LEADFEMALE:Now you know what you need to do, don't you? Yeah, put out.
OTHERFEMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:I got to give all this stuff back.
LEADFEMALE:And?
SUPMALE:And got to be honest with her.
LEADFEMALE:And you know that's right.
LEADMALE:If I keep the bike, I'm a pimp.
SUPFEMALE:If I give it back, I'm a damn fool.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, pimp it is.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
SUPMALE:Hi, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Chocolate? Forget it, honey.
LEADMALE:At $5 a pop, I'm not sharing.
LEADFEMALE:I am so angry.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, here.
SUPMALE:You can have a bite.
LEADMALE:No, it's about Judge Robertson.
SUPMALE:You know, he is sitting up on that bench for all the wrong reasons.
LEADMALE:Unless somebody runs against him, he'll be up there forever.
SUPMALE:Well, who'd you have in mind? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Somebody dynamic, principled.
SUPFEMALE:Someone who looks good in a black robe.
LEADFEMALE:Jesse Jackson? No, me.
LEADFEMALE:I know, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I always thought you'd make a fabulous judge.
LEADFEMALE:You sure, baby? I mean, this could mean big changes for all of us.
SUPFEMALE:I know, but it could also mean big changes for the people in this city.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe for the better.
SUPMALE:I love you, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too, Philip.
OTHERFEMALE:Get your hands off my chocolate, or you're a dead man.
LEADFEMALE:Here's Judge Robertson at that big student anti-war rally, remember? He was the only professor that had guts enough to go up against the administration.
SUPMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me, Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:He was a great man and a hell of a lawyer.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean, that those women didn't shave under their arms.
LEADMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, hold up.
LEADMALE:Who's that skinny, weird dude standing next to you? That's me.
SUPFEMALE:That's a relief, 'cause I was about to wonder why Uncle Phil was holding that dude's hand.
LEADFEMALE:Look, he'll be here any minute.
OTHERFEMALE:How am I going to tell him that I'm running against him? I mean, how do you tell somebody that used to be your hero that he's become completely incompetent? Well, big guy, may I suggest using flash cards with really big pictures? Don't worry, sweetheart, if he's the man that you think he is, he'll understand.
LEADFEMALE:If he's the man I think he is, he'll probably get lost on his way to the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Judge Robertson.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, Benson.
SUPMALE:For the last time, sir I am not Benson.
SUPMALE:Sure, right.
LEADMALE:How are you doing, Judge?
LEADFEMALE:I'm fine, yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, we'll leave you two alone.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, kids.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, nice seeing you again.
LEADMALE:Not only has she aged, she has a beer belly.
LEADFEMALE:That's my wife and she's pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:Then she should lay off the beer.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you take a seat, please? Judge Robertson, I hear that you're running for reelection and And you want to make a big fat contribution.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
OTHERMALE:Make the check out to cash.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, why don't you just give me the cash? Or maybe that ring.
SUPMALE:That's good.
SUPMALE:No, Carl.
SUPMALE:Look, there's something I want to tell you
LEADMALE:but I can't seem to find the words.
SUPFEMALE:Well, where did you have them last? No.
LEADMALE:I'm talking about what's happened to you.
LEADMALE:I'll be frank.
SUPMALE:Okay, and who am I? No.
SUPMALE:Look, what I'm trying to say is that maybe you've served the community long enough and as your friend, I think I should tell you that well, maybe it's time for you to retire.
SUPMALE:Me, retire? Oh, Frank.
SUPMALE:Have you lost your mind? I mean, this is the cushiest job in town.
LEADMALE:I get free coffee, validated parking I don't have to wear pants, and besides, there's no one to run against me.
OTHERMALE:Yes, there is.
LEADMALE:Who?
OTHERMALE:Me.
LEADMALE:You! You've got to be kidding.
OTHERMALE:You don't know the first thing about running for office.
LEADMALE:I taught you about law, not politics.
LEADFEMALE:Look, the point is I'm going to run against you, and I thought I should tell you face to face.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes? Well, let me tell you something face to face.
LEADMALE:I am a very worthy opponent.
OTHERFEMALE:And I can see myself in your head.
SUPFEMALE:Benson, my car.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
LEADMALE:Judge? Hey, what's going on? What are you doing here?
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, don't I live here?
SUPFEMALE:No, Judge, you don't.
LEADMALE:No wonder the garage door opener didn't work.
LEADFEMALE:It took forever to pry it open.
LEADMALE:Look, Judge.
LEADMALE:Juice? No.
SUPFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:Look I got some problems, you know, I got to deal with tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:Woman problems.
LEADFEMALE:Women.
SUPMALE:They've been a problem ever since they got the right to vote.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, son, sit down.
LEADMALE:Talk to me, sonny, talk to me.
SUPMALE:I've had my share of problems with women.
LEADMALE:Actually, Judge, it's this girl at school, Lindsey, right? She just keep buying me all these fly gifts.
OTHERFEMALE:So what's the problem?
SUPMALE:Well, I'm not really attracted to her.
LEADFEMALE:So what's the problem? My Aunt Viv told me that, you know it's not right to accept gifts from people that, you know
LEADMALE:you're not really attracted to.
SUPMALE:Look, son I remember when I was your age, there was this girl I didn't like her that much she was always buying me gifts, dinner, taking me out.
SUPMALE:Heck, she even offered to send me through law school.
LEADFEMALE:So what did you do?
LEADFEMALE:What else? I married her.
LEADMALE:Pie?
SUPMALE:No, thanks, Judge.
LEADMALE:So, wait, you're just going to tell me that you got together with this girl, and you had this long, incredible, wonderful life.
SUPMALE:I wish I could tell you that.
LEADMALE:But the truth is, I dumped her after law school.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, Judge, that's too bad.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's okay.
SUPMALE:We split everything down the middle.
SUPMALE:I got the money, the house, the car, the boat, and she got to keep the kids.
SUPMALE:Pie?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:So you're saying that you just kept all this stuff that she gave you, even after y'all broke up? Damn straight.
SUPMALE:Possession is nine-tenths of the law, my boy.
LEADFEMALE:Yo.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Lindsey, I told you I'm busy.
LEADMALE:But /'m in the neighborhood, rea//y c/ose.
SUPFEMALE:How close, Lindsey? Princess Leia! May the force be with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, somebody broke into your garage.
SUPMALE:Quick, call the police.
SUPMALE:Lindsey, can I talk to you for a second? Look, what are you doing here?
LEADFEMALE:As if I didn't know, right?
LEADFEMALE:It's over, Will.
LEADMALE:See what I'm saying? It's what?
SUPMALE:Over.
LEADFEMALE:But why?
LEADMALE:Why ask why? Look at her.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not attracted to you, Will.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, you are.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm not.
SUPMALE:I've never been attracted to you.
SUPMALE:Well Then why did you buy me all this stuff? Well, you're captain of the basketball team you're popular, and being seen with you at the autumn dance made me popular, too.
LEADFEMALE:But now your job is done.
LEADMALE:That woman is ruthless.
SUPMALE:You ever think about going into politics?
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:As a matter of fact, l
LEADMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:I'm saying, Lindsey, I mean, what about me as a person? What about the way that my cheeks dimple when I smile? And what color are my eyes? Look at you all quiet.
LEADFEMALE:You don't even know.
OTHERMALE:Who cares? Who cares? I feel so used, so cheap.
LEADFEMALE:You certainly weren't cheap.
SUPMALE:Cost me a fortune.
LEADMALE:I want my stuff back.
LEADMALE:Now.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:But
LEADMALE:Now! You take this ring back, 'cause my mother don't scream at me like that.
LEADFEMALE:Watch back, and you can take this jacket back.
LEADMALE:Nice meeting you, young lady.
LEADMALE:Be sure to rock the vote.
LEADMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Judge I never thought saying goodbye would be so hard.
LEADMALE:I really loved that watch.
LEADFEMALE:He was a little eccentric.
LEADMALE:But, he traught Taught me that.
LEADFEMALE:And soon as I say this Let's do it again.
LEADFEMALE:He traught you?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, he traught me.
SUPMALE:What'd he traught you?
SUPMALE:He traught me how to Oops.
LEADFEMALE:And /et's go do this again.
LEADFEMALE:Damn.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:What's up, Prince? Me and Carlton just checking out these college brochures.
SUPFEMALE:I've already set my sights on Princeton.
SUPFEMALE:It has a balanced curriculum with the largest repository of classical literature.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, I got my sights set on this school with the largest repository of girls with the big old butts.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah! Which reminds me, I brought your CD player back.
LEADMALE:See, Jazz, now this is not my CD player, see 'cause my CD player has the wires on the inside.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, man.
SUPFEMALE:How can I make it up to you? Jazz, how about paying for it? Why would I want to buy a broken CD player?
LEADMALE:Hey, Aunt Viv.
OTHERMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Judge.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Will, please.
OTHERMALE:I haven't even announced that I'm running.
LEADMALE:I don't think you'd have to announce it, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks.
OTHERFEMALE:If you ran, we'd hear you coming.
LEADFEMALE:I'm running for Superior Court Judge.
OTHERMALE:He still could use the exercise.
LEADMALE:Will, Carlton I want you guys to be on your best behavior tomorrow and look presentable.
LEADMALE:It's navy-blue jacket, gray slacks, power tie.
LEADMALE:Whoa, Uncle Phil, you sure you wouldn't want Carlton to wear Aunt Viv's apron? No.
LEADMALE:Oh, Jazz, I need you to bring over my blue jacket.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, man, I'll have it back to you first thing tomorrow morning.
LEADMALE:You won't even be able to tell I wore it.
OTHERFEMALE:Jazz, what did you do to my jacket? You told me to get it cleaned.
OTHERFEMALE:So I washed it.
LEADMALE:I don't believe you, man, first my CD player, now this.
LEADMALE:You make a doorknob look smart, man.
OTHERFEMALE:No need to get testy.
OTHERFEMALE:At least I got out all the A.
LEADFEMALE:1.
SUPFEMALE:sauce.
SUPMALE:Whoa, hold up.
LEADFEMALE:Underdog's on.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, but I'm watching the Eagles.
SUPMALE:Well, excuse me but you once preferred the whimsy of a y ogi and a Boo Boo.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I hardly know you.
SUPFEMALE:Will, put on your jacket.
LEADMALE:We're leaving for the press luncheon in 10 minutes.
SUPMALE:Hey, have you been undressing my Teddy Ruxpin again?
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, you look so sexy.
SUPMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Now go upstairs and change.
LEADMALE:What, don't you want to project the right image? Hey, I'm happy that this fits over my belly.
SUPFEMALE:Which reminds me, I'm hungry.
OTHERFEMALE:Viv Daddy? I am a young adult, and I have my rights.
SUPMALE:If you force me to wear this, I'II I'll hold my breath until my face turns blue.
SUPMALE:Ashley, you're 13 years old, you'll do what I say.
LEADFEMALE:But that's not fair.
LEADFEMALE:Call a cop.
LEADMALE:Mommy! Well, I'm ready.
SUPMALE:I've been waiting all my life to hear you say that.
SUPMALE:I meant, I'm ready for the press conference.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, sometimes I lose sight of why I want to be a judge.
SUPMALE:Then you open your mouth, and it all comes flooding back.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:See, Will, I inspire him.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, not yet.
OTHERMALE:Not now, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! No, you're on the one-yard line! Fumble? Herschel, pick it up! Well, it's painfully obvious that my presence is no longer required.
SUPMALE:Here, Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:Eventually, you'll grow into it.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, sir, but how's your day been going so far?
LEADMALE:Well, wonderful, Geoffrey, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, down the toilet it goes.
LEADMALE:Judge Robertson, what are you doing here, sir? Philip, it's good to see you again, my boy.
SUPMALE:How long has it 
LEADMALE:10, 15 years?
LEADMALE:We just had dinner a few weeks ago, sir.
LEADMALE:We did? Did I leave here with my pants on? Yes.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank God.
SUPFEMALE:But that means you must throw a lousy party.
OTHERMALE:But enough about you, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Philip, you got to help me.
SUPMALE:You're the only one I can trust.
LEADMALE:I just heard that they found someone to run against me.
SUPFEMALE:Judge, we discussed that over dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm running against you.
LEADFEMALE:What? How dare you! Get out of my house! Out! Lionel, show him the door.
LEADMALE:Go, go, go, touchdown! Will, Will.
SUPMALE:Put that thing away.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, they just tied it up.
LEADMALE:I don't care.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADFEMALE:And welcome to this afternoon's press conference.
LEADFEMALE:It is my pleasure to introduce to you Mr.
OTHERMALE:Philip Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the press and thank you very much for coming.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to take this opportunity to formally announce my candidacy for the office of Superior Court Judge.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I plan on restoring faith in the judicial system.
SUPMALE:And I ask 
SUPFEMALE:Do you really want six more years of the same tired plea-bargaining? Yes, yes! What? Judge Robertson has been in office six straight terms how do you intend to break that streak? By focusing on the issues and not personality.
OTHERMALE:Once the voters see where I stand, I'm sure I'll win this election.
SUPFEMALE:You idiot, you don't even deserve to sit on the bench.
LEADFEMALE:What? Judge Robertson.
LEADMALE:I didn't know he had kids.
LEADMALE:He doesn't.
SUPMALE:And that's not his wife.
SUPFEMALE:And am I crazy or does he look 10 years younger? That's unbelievable.
LEADMALE:Is that brisket I smell?
LEADMALE:Lovely family.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Who are they?
OTHERMALE:Rented.
SUPMALE:Judge Robertson, how does it feel to be running against your own student? Philip Banks is a gentleman and one of the smartest students I ever had.
LEADMALE:A man who would bring honor to the bench.
SUPFEMALE:Don't get me wrong, I want the job.
SUPFEMALE:But I can't think of another person that I would mind losing to but this man here.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you, my son.
SUPFEMALE:What a guy.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Banks, what's your response? Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks, we're looking for your nephew, a William Smith.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:It's over, it's all over.
OTHERMALE:Are you Will Smith? No, Rahjim Shabaz, Muslim activist.
SUPFEMALE:Sa/aam a/aikum.
LEADMALE:Will, what's wrong? You're under arrest, Shabaz.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down, Smith.
SUPMALE:Oh, okay, it's like that, right? All right.
LEADFEMALE:It's cool.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna sit down.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'm sitting down right here.
OTHERFEMALE:And you think that just 'cause you got that badge and all your tough cop friends walking around and your cute little walkie-talkie that you can talk to folks any old way you want to do it.
OTHERMALE:Well, I tell you right now, if you ain't have all that stuff we'd be squawking a different language up in here right now.
LEADMALE:What are you trying to say? I think I made myself real clear when I said what I just said.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I guess you did.
SUPMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Officer, your stuff fell off.
LEADFEMALE:Hip-hop cop.
SUPFEMALE:Blue looks nice on you, too.
LEADFEMALE:Match that big blue vein throbbing in your neck right now.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Philip Banks, the boy's attorney.
SUPMALE:I'd like to speak to my nephew alone, please.
LEADFEMALE:What's up now, tough guy?
LEADMALE:No problem, sir.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we told him, right, Uncle Phil?
LEADMALE:Sit down.
OTHERMALE:Will, how could you get $2,000 worth of parking tickets when I told you to get rid of that car months ago? Actually, I did get rid of it.
SUPFEMALE:See, I gave it to a friend.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I swear to you, Uncle Phil there ain't no way I got them parking tickets.
LEADFEMALE:Look at the printout.
LEADMALE:Huh? "Snuffy's Chicken Shack, Big Ben's Barbeque "Alice's All Nude Review.
LEADFEMALE:" What do you call this? One hell of a Friday night.
LEADFEMALE:Can I see that, Uncle Phil? Wait a minute, Uncle Phil, these are all Jazz's hangouts.
LEADFEMALE:He must have gotten all these parking tickets.
LEADFEMALE:I'm serious.
LEADMALE:I told him I'd kill him.
LEADMALE:How could he go to Alice's All Nude Review without me? Well, hello, Philip, my boy.
LEADMALE:Welcome to City Hall.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Will, wait in the car and don't even touch the steering wheel.
LEADMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Judge.
LEADFEMALE:Judge.
LEADFEMALE:Judge, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Look, brother ran into a little misfortune.
LEADFEMALE:Right? I got like $2,000 worth of parking tickets.
LEADFEMALE:I was just wondering, I don't know, maybe you might be able to do a I thought he was selling condoms.
LEADFEMALE:I apologize for my nephew, Judge.
LEADMALE:And I hope this little incident didn't cause any undue embarrassment.
LEADMALE:I mean
SUPMALE:the press is going to have a field day.
SUPMALE:Well, I certainly hope so.
SUPFEMALE:This is just the beginning.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I was browsing through the police files and bingo, up pops your nephew's name.
SUPFEMALE:Parking tickets up the ying-yang.
LEADFEMALE:So I busted his bony butt.
SUPFEMALE:Pretty good, huh?
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wake up, knucklehead.
SUPMALE:You're in the big leagues now.
SUPFEMALE:I may be old, I may be senile and I haven't been able to find my car for the past half hour but I can beat your butt in a political campaign any day.
LEADMALE:You're dead meat, Tiny.
LEADMALE:I always knew Will would be the downfall of this family.
LEADMALE:But no one ever listens to me.
LEADMALE:What, honey? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
SUPMALE:I mean, Will being arrested means we're all going to be investigated.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, this is how they knocked off Imelda Marcos.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just die if they touch my shoes.
LEADMALE:I'd die if you made your own bed.
LEADFEMALE:Get off me, man, just get off me.
LEADMALE:Thank you, thank you.
OTHERMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:I'm so glad you're home.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton said you were probably doing 5 to 10 by now.
LEADMALE:Are you all right, sweetheart?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I'm fine, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:Well, good, now I can break your legs.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, Vivian, I'll handle this.
SUPMALE:Now we have to make a statement for the press.
SUPFEMALE:So put on an apron, grab the cookie jar.
LEADMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:And I ate all the cookies before lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, then we'll have to grab the cutest kid.
OTHERMALE:Ashley, you'll do.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, smile, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Let's go, Vivian, come on.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Are you ready to talk to us now? Man, this has been the worst day of my life.
SUPMALE:And as soon as I see Jazz, I'm going to make it the worst day of his.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you seem embittered.
LEADMALE:Jail will do that to a man.
LEADMALE:Now that you've done hard time, a book may be in order.
SUPMALE:Criminals sell.
SUPMALE:I can sell criminals.
LEADFEMALE:You're a criminal.
LEADMALE:Really? And you're too short to ride the teacup ride at Disneyland.
LEADMALE:What's up, Will? Man, what's with all the reporters? I ain't seen no chalk outlines or nothing.
LEADFEMALE:That's 'cause I didn't murder you yet.
OTHERFEMALE:What's got your BVDs in a bunch? Well, for starters, you ruined the most important day in my uncle's life.
LEADMALE:Haagen-Dazs opened in Bel-Air? Jazz, I trusted you with my ride over the summer and you got $2,000 worth of parking tickets.
LEADMALE:And you didn't even tell me.
LEADMALE:You're right, I should have told you.
LEADMALE:Will, I got $2,000 worth of parking tickets.
LEADMALE:What do you plan to do about that, Jazz?
LEADFEMALE:I'll take care of it, man.
SUPFEMALE:I promise.
LEADFEMALE:Can I borrow $2,000? This is not a joke, man.
LEADMALE:I trusted you, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:I trusted you, and you got me tossed into jail.
LEADMALE:Friends don't do that to each other, man.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, friends are supposed to be there for each other.
LEADMALE:Friends aren't supposed to set you up to take a fall.
LEADMALE:And most importantly, friends are supposed to be honest with each other.
SUPMALE:And you obviously don't fit that mold.
LEADFEMALE:So from this point on, you can consider our friendship over.
SUPMALE:You're no longer welcome in this house.
LEADMALE:And I'd appreciate it if you just got the hell out of my crib.
OTHERFEMALE:Ain't you going to even bother to throw me out? You're not worth it, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey G, you want to go watch some Underdog? Why, do I look like a moron? Banks residence.
LEADFEMALE:G, look, if that's Jazz, tell him I do not want to talk to him.
LEADMALE:It's for me.
LEADMALE:It's my accountant.
SUPMALE:So what are you wearing? Hey, Carlton, man, how about we shoot down to The Wing King, man get a big bucket of ribs? Do I look like Jimmie Walker? Forget you then, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, Ashley.
LEADMALE:I just got the new video boxing.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you want to play? Sorry, homey, homework.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Hil, you want to No, Will, I don't want ribs, I don't want to wax your ride and I don't even know what a Chumpy is.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:It's like that, right? It's like that.
LEADFEMALE:Y'all going to flee me like that, right? My suggestion to you, my despondent, desperate, ne'er-do-well cousin is to make amends with your partner in delinquency.
OTHERMALE:What? Call him, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sure Jazz is sorry.
OTHERMALE:Why should I call him after what he did to me? You know, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need him.
SUPMALE:I don't need you.
SUPMALE:I don't need nobody.
LEADMALE:I just want to get up to my room, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I don't want no trouble.
LEADMALE:It's all right, Will, I'm not mad anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, Philip, look at this.
OTHERMALE:What? It's all in the paper.
LEADFEMALE:They got a picture of me throwing a reporter in the pool.
OTHERFEMALE:What a wonderful way to start my campaign.
LEADMALE:My nephew gets arrested.
SUPMALE:My wife looks like y ou look wonderful, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, Aunt Viv, you got a, kind of a homicidal, sumo-wrestler thing going.
LEADMALE:Oh, but you working it, girl.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:What are you doing here? I was out for my morning constitutional and I must have walked farther than I thought.
SUPFEMALE:But since I'm here, bean pie for all.
LEADMALE:You know, just my way of saying y ou know.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's very nice, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Jazz.
LEADMALE:I guess you two want to be alone.
LEADMALE:I don't get it, Philip, why did he give us a bean pie? What am I, Freud? Grab a fork, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:Well I guess I ought to be going.
SUPFEMALE:You probably got college applications to fill out.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah, actually, I do.
LEADMALE:You probably want to hang out with educated people who drink their malt liquor in a glass.
SUPFEMALE:What are you talking about, Jazz? Face it, Will.
LEADFEMALE:You're going to go off to college to be somebody and I'm going to be stuck here living foot to mouth.
LEADMALE:I think you mean hand to mouth, Jazz.
SUPMALE:Don't try to impress me with your fancy education.
SUPMALE:You're going to go off next year to some big old college and I'll be sitting here by the phone waiting for you to call.
LEADFEMALE:You're not making any sense, Jazz.
LEADMALE:You used to think that was cute.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean this whole thing is about me going off to college? Oh, comes the dawn.
LEADMALE:My mother told me you was no good.
OTHERMALE:I knew I should have listened to her.
LEADMALE:See, I promised myself I wasn't going to cry.
LEADMALE:Look, come on, Jazz.
LEADMALE:Get your hands off of me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not a faucet to be turned on and off at your whim.
LEADFEMALE:I have emotions.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz, yes, it's true that I'm going off to college, man, but Come on, you like family to me.
OTHERMALE:Jazz, just 'cause somebody moves away from the family that doesn't mean they break up.
LEADFEMALE:That just means that, you know, the family has to work harder to stay together.
LEADFEMALE:You understand what I'm saying? No.
LEADMALE:But at least you talking to me.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Jazz, you know you're always going to be my homey.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you say that in the first place? I did say that.
LEADMALE:Why don't you clean out your ears? Now, I know you ain't talking about nobody's ears.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, come on, man, let's jet down to the mall, pick up some Chumpies.
LEADMALE:Will, could you do one thing for me? You know, just for old time's sake.
OTHERMALE:Sure, no problem, man.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, I trusted you with my ride over the summer and you got me tossed I mean shoot.
LEADFEMALE:I said, "shoot," Mom.
SUPMALE:"I raised my boy better than that.
LEADMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey, good morning, G.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Master William.
SUPFEMALE:So, ready for the big camping expedition? Please, man, I'm from Philly.
LEADMALE:To me, a wilderness experience is dating a girl who don't shave her legs.
LEADFEMALE:My uncle Reggie always insisted the woods were safer than the cities.
SUPFEMALE:Until the day he died.
SUPFEMALE:Word? Yo, how'd he die? He was eaten by wolves.
LEADMALE:Carlton's log.
SUPMALE:Earth 
LEADFEMALE:1992.
LEADFEMALE:It's 6:00 a.
LEADMALE:m.
LEADFEMALE:Up with the dawn, the small band of brave souls prepare to pile into their Mercedes.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Adventure.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, you look like Webster on a safari.
LEADMALE:Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:I'm doing the morning weather today.
LEADMALE:Oh, goody.
SUPFEMALE:And after that, you're off to join Miss Ashley and Mrs.
SUPMALE:Banks at the spa for their beauty makeover weekend? Beauty makeover? With this face? I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, everyone.
SUPFEMALE:You know, men, I'm really looking forward to this.
SUPMALE:Reminds me of camping with my father.
SUPMALE:Sleeping under the stars, climbing mountains braving winds that could knock a grown man flat to the ground.
OTHERMALE:Hey, man, I ain't trying to be nowhere around a wind that can knock Uncle Phil to the ground.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I hope you prepared for rain.
OTHERMALE:I'm predicting a 90o/o chance of precipitation.
OTHERMALE:And you know how often I'm right.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's unpack the rain gear.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Uncle Phil, I got a bad feeling about this one.
LEADMALE:I mean, I think we should just turn back.
LEADMALE:Will, you said that before we got in the car when we pulled out of the driveway when we pulled onto the freeway
LEADMALE:when we pulled off the freeway.
LEADMALE:Then do it! Come on, Uncle Phil, it's dark, it's raining, and we're lost.
LEADMALE:We are not lost.
SUPFEMALE:Will, ye of little faith.
LEADFEMALE:Dad knows exactly what he's doing.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think anyone would drive by the same tree seven times on purpose? Carlton's log.
SUPFEMALE:We're somewhere in the galaxy.
OTHERFEMALE:My father has no idea where.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, I'm telling you, I think we should just pull into a gas station.
SUPFEMALE:Will, for the last time, I don't need directions.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:You need gas.
LEADMALE:Okay, I made a wrong turn.
LEADFEMALE:It's no big deal, it's not the end of the world.
LEADMALE:We'll just We'll thumb a ride to the nearest gas station.
LEADFEMALE:We used to do it a lot in the '60s.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, can you take a stroll into the '90s, please? We are three black men on the side of a mountain road.
SUPFEMALE:The only people that's going to stop is going to have on sheets and saying stuff like, "Get them, Jim Bob.
LEADFEMALE:" Will may have a point, Dad.
OTHERMALE:Why don't we stay here and let him go get the gas? We're all getting out of the car.
SUPFEMALE:We can make camp right here and go for gas in the morning.
LEADMALE:Let's get out of the car.
LEADFEMALE:Get out of the car.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, look! Where's our camping equipment? Will, you were supposed to secure everything to the luggage rack.
LEADMALE:I did.
LEADMALE:Wait, this ain't the Volvo.
LEADFEMALE:The car phone, we'll call for road service.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, great idea, Carlton.
LEADMALE:You can tell them exactly where we are, too.
SUPMALE:Somewhere in the dark between a rock and a tree.
SUPFEMALE:/'m sorry, you are outside the ca//ing area.
LEADFEMALE:P/ease try your ca// again.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess sending for pizza's out.
LEADFEMALE:All right, now, that's it, that's enough.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll just get back in the car and go for gas in the morning.
LEADFEMALE:Now get in the car.
LEADMALE:But you just
LEADFEMALE:Get in the car! You know, Uncle Phil, now, I haven't been on too many camping trips but snow is a bad thing, right? Look.
LEADFEMALE:Let's look on the bright side, okay? This will give us a perfect opportunity to pull together and show what we're made of.
SUPFEMALE:Does Bigfoot have to come down here with a chain saw before you admit we're in trouble? Okay, we can't stay here, we'll freeze to death.
OTHERFEMALE:Just get all the stuff out of the back seat.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll go ahead on foot.
SUPMALE:Get out of the car.
LEADMALE:But you just

SUPFEMALE:Baggy clothes, no makeup, tousled hair.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I feel really comfortable like this, too, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I don't need to hide behind cosmetics.
LEADFEMALE:I'm beautiful just the way I am.
LEADMALE:Hilary, you home? Oh, my God.
OTHERMALE:It's Trevor.
LEADMALE:Quick, get my hot comb.
SUPMALE:Sorry, this is the scene where Barbara finds out Robert's been cheating with a button-nosed bimbo.

SUPFEMALE:Trevor, he's adorable.
LEADMALE:Goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a second.
LEADMALE:I also brought you these.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, my.
OTHERFEMALE:You look beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Why don't you put this on ice?
LEADMALE:Champagne?
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:What are we celebrating? An empty house.
LEADFEMALE:Yoo-hoo! I thought this was your day off.
SUPFEMALE:Correct, but you overlooked one fact.
OTHERMALE:I have no life.
OTHERMALE:Geoffrey, will you get it?
LEADMALE:On my day off? You'd really let me? Well, I thought we'd have a quiet evening together and I'd make you dinner.
LEADMALE:Trevor, that is so sweet.
LEADMALE:All right, now.
LEADMALE:You get out of the kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:I want this to be a surprise.
LEADFEMALE:Surprise! Jazz, what do you think you're doing? Looking after you, my pet.
SUPFEMALE:After all, you're a beautiful, desirable woman.
LEADMALE:Or you would be if you combed your hair once in a while.
LEADMALE:And some lipstick wouldn't kill you, either.
SUPMALE:Look, Jazz, go home.
LEADMALE:Stand back.
LEADMALE:Let a man handle this.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing here?
SUPMALE:I'm cooking dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Good, I like my steak medium-rare.
LEADMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to freshen up a bit.
LEADMALE:Get off me! Would you See, a cave.
LEADFEMALE:Told you everything would be all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I was trying to scare the bears away.
SUPMALE:Carlton's log.
SUPFEMALE:I'm wet.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm wet and I'm cold.
LEADMALE:I'm wet and I'm cold and I'm in a cave.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
LEADMALE:I'm shutting up.
SUPFEMALE:I'm shutting up and I'm wet.
LEADMALE:That's it!
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Just relax! Look, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we'll build a fire.
SUPMALE:How are we supposed to build a fire, Uncle Phil? It's snowing outside.
LEADMALE:All the wood is soaking wet.
LEADMALE:Then we'll freeze to death.
LEADMALE:I don't want to die.
SUPFEMALE:I want to go to college and poke fun at all the kids on financial aid.
OTHERMALE:I want to see Karate Kid 17.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton.
LEADMALE:Don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you check the cave for dry wood.
SUPMALE:Man, I ain't walking around in this cave by myself.
SUPFEMALE:There's rats and bats and bears and stuff all over the place.
LEADFEMALE:Me, neither, Dad.
OTHERMALE:I think the three of us should just cuddle up close together for the night.
SUPMALE:I'm going to go check the cave for some wood.
LEADFEMALE:I found this bag, Uncle Phil.
OTHERMALE:Will, we can't just burn a bag.
LEADFEMALE:We're helpless, it's over, we're dead.
LEADMALE:We're rich!
OTHERMALE:What? Hey, back up, back up! $25,000.
SUPFEMALE:Do you all mind if I get butt naked and roll around in this for a little while? Will, we're going to have to turn that money over to the authorities.
OTHERMALE:If nobody claims it, then you can keep it, but until then, I think I should look after it.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, no! I'm all right, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll just find a safe place to keep it, you know, just for the night.
LEADFEMALE:Goodnight, Abe.
OTHERMALE:Goodnight, Alexander.
LEADMALE:And I can't forget you, Ben.
SUPFEMALE:Man, I'm sleeping with the presidents.
LEADFEMALE:Must be what Marilyn Monroe felt like.
OTHERMALE:What's for dinner? Jazz, I told you to go home.
OTHERMALE:How fast were you going when you hit this? Now, see here, homey.
LEADMALE:My lady and I are trying to have an intimate moment.
LEADMALE:Oh, I get it.
SUPFEMALE:You're trying to make me jealous.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it worked like a charm.
LEADFEMALE:Beat it, buddy.
LEADFEMALE:How dare you talk to me like that? Do you have any idea who I am? A really bad cook? Trevor, could you excuse us for a moment, please? I have never been so insulted in my life.
OTHERMALE:Blind people recognize me.
SUPMALE:I could kill you.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, baby, hurt me.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I am not going to let you screw this up for me.
LEADMALE:Trevor is a wonderful man.
LEADFEMALE:But I'm Jazz, the lover of all lovers.
LEADFEMALE:I put the "afro" in aphrodisiac.
OTHERMALE:So lose the stiff, and I'll be waiting in the pool house.
SUPFEMALE:And fix yourself up a little.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to your friend? Don't worry about him.
SUPFEMALE:What are you watching? One of those silly sentimental films, formula stuff.
OTHERMALE:Can I watch with you? Sure.
LEADMALE:But I have to go home in a few minutes.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to alarm either one of you but it's about 20 degrees in here, and it's only going to get worse.
LEADMALE:Carlton's log.
LEADMALE:I hate Dad.
LEADMALE:You know, this wood is just too wet to ignite.
SUPMALE:We need something dry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid it's going to have to be something that's near and dear to all of us.
LEADMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil, at least knock him out first.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking about the money, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
SUPMALE:Do you want to die with $25,000 by your side or do you want to live to see tomorrow? I'm thinking, I'm thinking, all right?
OTHERFEMALE:I'm afraid there's no other choice.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Look, can I just have a few minutes alone with the guys? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Dad.
SUPMALE:When you throw that money into the fire if I lose my head and leap in after it you'll pull me out, right? Son, there are more important things in life than money.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, but I can't get a date, either.
SUPMALE:All right, here's the money.
LEADMALE:What?
OTHERFEMALE:Was that Andrew or Ben?
LEADFEMALE:It was Ben.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Ben.
OTHERMALE:You was one of the few white people I could really count on.
LEADMALE:Carlton's log.
LEADFEMALE:Will has been reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self.
SUPMALE:I, on the other hand, have the strength of 10 men.
SUPFEMALE:Will's log is about to connect with Carlton's head! Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, Will, give me the log.
SUPMALE:That's not why I brought you two up here.
LEADMALE:I really blew it.
LEADFEMALE:All I wanted to do was spend some time with you before you went off to college.
LEADMALE:You know, there was a better way of doing it, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps a matinee and a box of Raisinets.
SUPMALE:Raisinets? I hate Raisinets.
LEADMALE:Can we get some Goobers? It's not the same.
LEADMALE:Some of the best memories of my life are camping with my father.
SUPFEMALE:He taught me how to hunt and fish, how to pitch a tent.
OTHERMALE:I'm guessing he didn't teach you how to use a compass.
OTHERMALE:Now that he's gone I really miss him.
OTHERFEMALE:I really appreciate what we had together.
LEADMALE:He was quite a man.
SUPMALE:I learned so much from him.
SUPFEMALE:That's decent, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:At least you had somebody to teach you stuff, you know? I had to learn everything on my own.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, my mom was working all the time and everything.
SUPFEMALE:Like, I wanted to roller skate but, you know, I didn't even really know how to do it.
LEADMALE:So I used to put on one skate and push with the other foot.
LEADFEMALE:Never seemed like I could be fast enough to keep up with the other kids, though.
LEADFEMALE:You know, actually that's how I felt when I came to Bel-Air, you know? It's like everybody had two skates, and I was trying to keep up with one.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for my other skate, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:For a long time it gave me nightmares having to witness an injustice like that.
LEADFEMALE:It was a constant reminder of how unfair this world can be.
LEADFEMALE:I can still hear them taunting 
LEADFEMALE:"Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids.
OTHERMALE:" How come they just couldn't give him some cereal?
SUPMALE:You guys, wake up.
LEADMALE:Wake up.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, man.
LEADMALE:We made it.
SUPFEMALE:We made it.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, wake up.
LEADMALE:Vivian, I'm not a machine! Come on, Dad, it's morning.
SUPFEMALE:What do you know, it stopped snowing.

SUPFEMALE:Hey, man, I ain't trying to be nowhere around a wind that can knock Uncle Phil to the ground.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I hope you prepared for rain.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm predicting a 90olo chance of precipitation.

LEADMALE:Let's unpack the rain gear.

OTHERMALE:And to this day I just thank God I had my two-headed coin 'cause that girl was smoking, man.
LEADMALE:The poll results are in.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go see what And the race for Superior Court Judge is neck and neck.
SUPMALE:Robertson and Banks are both polling 36%o.
LEADMALE:At this point, anything could tip the balance.
LEADFEMALE:More after this.
LEADMALE:lf Banks gets into office, we won't have to hide anymore this city's ours! Unlike my opponent, l don't think crime should pay.
LEADFEMALE:l say, throw the bums in jail.

LEADFEMALE:Philip Banks, none.
LEADMALE:Criminals support Philip Banks.
LEADMALE:Should you? Throw the bums in jail.
LEADFEMALE:Say, "Philip Banks, no thanks," on Election Day.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, you got to kick that man's butt.
LEADMALE:He like begging, he like, "Philip Banks, kick my butt.
LEADMALE:"
LEADMALE:Philip Banks, kick the man's butt.
LEADMALE:Can't do it, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:I'm running an honest campaign.
LEADMALE:Philip, that man is evil and senile.
LEADMALE:Why not fight fire with fire? Because it goes against everything I stand for.
LEADMALE:What's your point? I have made my decision.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna base my campaign on the issues, not the dirt.
SUPFEMALE:I have faith in L.
LEADMALE:A.
OTHERFEMALE:That L.
SUPFEMALE:A.
SUPMALE:Will have faith in me.
OTHERMALE:With over 90%o of the districts reporting Judge Robertson has overwhelmingly defeated Philip Banks.
OTHERMALE:I hate L.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:And there's the loser now! Let's listen in as he makes his concession speech.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone, I want to thank you for your support.
SUPFEMALE:We put up a good fight and well it was just an unfortunate set of circumstances that saw y ou don't have to shove, we got two exits! Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks not in recent memory has someone managed to lose a race by such a large margin.
LEADFEMALE:And so darn quickly.
LEADFEMALE:How does it feel? Well, once when I was a kid I zipped my pants up too fast let's just say this brings back old memories.
SUPMALE:On a brighter note, I see you've brought your lovely family with you including your daughter, KFPB weather personality, Hilary Banks.
SUPMALE:Hilary, you have just seen your father suffer a humiliating defeat.
LEADMALE:So tell me, are you free for dinner tonight? Look, my father just lost an election.
LEADMALE:I mean, I'm not totally insensitive.
LEADFEMALE:How about tomorrow?
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Well, from the Banks headquarters, this is Trevor Collins feeling pretty good.
LEADMALE:Now, everybody, put on your best faces.
LEADMALE:It's time to go give the victor his due.
SUPFEMALE:Damn! Uncle Phil, I got your back.
LEADMALE:Well, I got like half your back 'cause your back's like Want some candy, little girl? Come here.
SUPFEMALE:Judge Robertson, to what do you attribute your reelection? To getting more votes than the other guy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, why did you get more votes, sir? Well, why didn't you say so, Connie? You see, all the credit goes to my campaign workers who brought me up when I was down.
LEADFEMALE:Judge Robertson.
SUPMALE:Well, who do we have here?
OTHERFEMALE:Carl
LEADFEMALE:I thought I was Carl.
OTHERMALE:I just wanna congratulate you on a campaign well fought, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, coming from you, Carl, that means a lot.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Philip.
LEADFEMALE:And I am the walrus.
SUPFEMALE:Let's get the hell out of here.
LEADMALE:That was fun.
OTHERMALE:There goes Philip Banks the biggest sap that ever lived.
SUPMALE:What a stooge.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? You heard me.
LEADFEMALE:He's a sap, a dope, a loser.
SUPMALE:He never had what it takes and he never will.
SUPMALE:Isn't that right? I think you should take that back, man.
OTHERMALE:You do?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I do.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think you should run along and play.
SUPMALE:And don't get involved in politics until you're a big boy.
LEADMALE:At least my uncle stands for something.
LEADMALE:Really? And what would that be? A buffet? My uncle fights for what he believes in.
LEADMALE:Shame on me.
SUPMALE:My uncle's three times the man you will ever be.
SUPFEMALE:He's got my vote.
LEADFEMALE:And another 
OTHERFEMALE:Everything you said in your campaign was a lie.
LEADFEMALE:You have no integrity, no decency, and you're really, really short.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll tell you another thing, if you don't like it, man, you can drop dead.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God, he's dead.
LEADMALE:Come on, man, if I told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it? How are you doing, baby? I just feel so guilty, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, you gotta stop blaming yourself, Will.
SUPMALE:He wasn't a young man, he didn't take very good care of himself.
LEADMALE:Now, you heard what the doctor said.
SUPMALE:I know, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:If I could just forget it, just clear my mind for one minute.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Will, you really knocked them dead the other night, huh? Don't get him mad, Mom.
LEADMALE:You don't want to make him raise his voice.
SUPMALE:Carlton, take out the trash, honey.
LEADMALE:I did it last week, it's the Terminator's turn.
SUPMALE:Dan Quayle, please.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll hold.
OTHERMALE:Carlton, why are you calling Dan Quayle? Simple.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks to the Grim Reaper over here and Judge Robertson taking the old dirt nap the governor has to appoint someone and the right endorsement could swing it to Dad.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Carlton Banks.
SUPMALE:That's B-A-N-K-S.
LEADMALE:No E.
SUPFEMALE:That was a joke, ma'am.
SUPMALE:Hello? The phone's dead, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, man, I am not a killer.
LEADMALE:That's not funny.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, you know I'd never hurt you, right? I know.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, you know that I would never Hurt a fly.
LEADMALE:We know.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Will, you're taking this way too seriously.
OTHERMALE:I mean, it's not like you got a bad haircut.
LEADMALE:Look, I think I know how to help Will.
LEADMALE:This calls for tough love.
LEADMALE:We've gotta draw him out.
OTHERFEMALE:We've gotta bait him, confront him attack him until he defends himself.
LEADMALE:Only then will he start to feel better.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Look, just follow my lead.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you should be ashamed of yourself.
LEADMALE:How could you do such a thing? Hope you never get mad at me.
SUPFEMALE:Why are y'all screaming at me? I was minding my damn business eating some fruit.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I could be wrong.
LEADMALE:You won't believe this.
LEADMALE:They want me to give the eulogy at Judge Robertson's funeral.
OTHERMALE:You're kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, you know, I really hate to speak ill of the dead but if that little man hadn't died I would have killed him myself.
LEADFEMALE:So, who's up for Chinese food?
OTHERMALE:I'd like some.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna give the eulogy, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, no.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, how could you say yes? I know Carl changed over the years but the man was my mentor.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm going to that funeral.
OTHERFEMALE:And you're all going with me.
SUPMALE:Philip, any chance of getting those flowers after the funeral? Sit down, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to welcome you to the memorial for Carl Robertson.
LEADMALE:Saying a few words on behalf of the departed will be Philip Banks.
OTHERFEMALE:Vivian, where's my speech?
SUPFEMALE:It's on the kitchen counter where I Sorry, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:What can you say about Judge Carl Robertson? What indeed? He was a judge.
SUPFEMALE:A judge named Carl.
LEADFEMALE:But he was more.
SUPMALE:So much more.
LEADFEMALE:Carl He wasn't a very heavy man.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I'm probably the wrong person to be up here.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I just got finished losing an election to the man in which he used every dirty trick in the book.
LEADMALE:So, at this time I'd like to invite someone with an especially warm memory of Carl Robertson to come up here and share it with us.
SUPMALE:Anyone with a somewhat fond memory of Carl Robertson.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody with any recollection of him at all.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:The jerk sentenced me to six months in jail for a crime I didn't commit.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just here to make sure he dead.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:He hired me to replant his garden.
LEADFEMALE:And when it came time for him to pay me he called Immigration on me.
LEADMALE:Gracias.
LEADFEMALE:I knew Carl, biblically.
SUPMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADMALE:With him it was just a bunch of sex all the time, like dating Thumper.
LEADMALE:Never felt I really got to know him never felt he cared about my needs.
LEADMALE:You were his wife?
LEADMALE:His mistress.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:For 20 years.
LEADMALE:Longest years of my life.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have any pleasant memories at all of him? Well no.
SUPMALE:The man's idea of sweet talk 
OTHERFEMALE:"When you gonna bring your sister around?" Well, thank you for sharing.
LEADMALE:Hold up here a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:A man is dead here, people.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, did he not feel pain when he was hurt? I mean, did he not shiver when he was cold? Did he not dream? I mean, he was only human, but yes, he was human.
LEADMALE:And I fail to believe that the world can profit from a man's death.
OTHERFEMALE:And I think each and every one of you should be really ashamed of yourselves.
LEADMALE:And who are you? I'm the dude that killed him.
OTHERFEMALE:Tough room.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, you're just wasting your time, man.
SUPMALE:Ye of little faith.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm about to get the endorsement that will lock up Dad's appointment.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, is Vanna there? Well, I think heaven is this wonderful place where all the people are good-Iooking nothing clashes, and you never have to wait for a table.
SUPMALE:And hell is like the Valley.
OTHERMALE:What do you think, Daddy? I think we're all damn lucky Hilary has a job.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, see, to me heaven has to be like a cross between a Sir Mix-A-Lot video and Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
LEADFEMALE:See, it's like I can have a leg in one hand and a breast in the other.
LEADMALE:So what do you think, G? I think I must have been very bad in a previous life.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I don't know why people are so down on funerals.
LEADMALE:Banks residence.
LEADFEMALE:For you, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:Yes? Yes, Governor.

LEADMALE:Really? I hadn't noticed.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Carlton, Geoffrey's been shot.
SUPMALE:Cool.
OTHERFEMALE:You people don't pay me enough for this.

LEADMALE:Then you couldn't possibly feel me do this.
LEADMALE:Well, one down, three to go.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Is anybody going to tell me what's going on? We're playing Whodunnit.
LEADFEMALE:See, one of us is the killer, and we have to find out who it is.
LEADFEMALE:I say, we already know.

SUPMALE:Come on, Ashley, we're going to the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:What is he talking about? I ain't kill nobody.

LEADFEMALE:You know, I think maybe if I could lay down on the couch for a couple of hours you know? Oh, my God, is my hairline receding? Come on, Philip, sit down.
LEADMALE:Now, Will, we all know your uncle's got back problems.
SUPFEMALE:Now, relax, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'll go to class again, alone.
SUPMALE:Will, would you take my duffel bag out to the car for me? Yeah, that's fine, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! Freeze, bubble-butt! This could get ugly.
LEADMALE:Philip, what do you have to say for yourself? Good answer, Admiral Stockdale.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, this is very important to me.
SUPMALE:After all, you missed all the other births of your other children.
OTHERMALE:Well, it wasn't my fault.
LEADMALE:Fathers weren't allowed in the delivery room back then.
SUPMALE:They are now, and I would like you to share this experience.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I intend to.
LEADMALE:I will be pacing up and down in the waiting room where a man's supposed to be.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:If that's the way you feel, forget it!
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Vivian.
SUPMALE:And what's your problem?

OTHERMALE:He refuses to be my Lamaze coach.
LEADFEMALE:So I'm gonna need one of you kids to go with me.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, homework.
SUPFEMALE:Tennis lesson.

SUPFEMALE:Look, what is the matter with y'all? I mean, this is your mother.
LEADMALE:She's having a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Aunt Viv, if I was one of your kids I'd be short with a square head but I'd be more than happy to be your coach.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Viv, it was a joke.
SUPMALE:You can't take a joke? Come on, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna be doing all the work.
LEADFEMALE:All you have to do is cheer me on.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's cool.

LEADMALE:She's fine.
LEADFEMALE:She's one of The Fat Boys.
SUPMALE:Hi, Danny.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Viv.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? Hey, you know, can you do me a favor? I have not seen my feet since Lent.
SUPMALE:Can you tell me, do my shoes match? No.
LEADFEMALE:Damn.

LEADMALE:Danny Mitchell.
LEADMALE:So I guess your husband will be showing up any minute, huh?
LEADMALE:No, he's in Mexico.
OTHERFEMALE:On vacation? No, on his secretary.
LEADMALE:But don't worry, he's not having a good time.
LEADMALE:I filled his thong with BenGay.
LEADMALE:Remind me to stay on your good side, Danny.
LEADFEMALE:Will, what's so funny? It's just that a dude named Danny Mitchell is my favorite sportswriter.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you know, I could introduce you.
LEADFEMALE:Word? Hey, how you doing? You're the Danny Mitchell? Wait, hold it.
LEADFEMALE:I heard Charles Barkley on the radio talking about him and Danny was gonna rumble in the parking lot after the Laker game.
LEADFEMALE:He won't show up, that wuss.
LEADMALE:All righty, coaches let's get our mommies in a comfy position.
LEADFEMALE:Will?
SUPMALE:What? That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:That's good.
SUPFEMALE:Are you all right?
LEADMALE:You need some help there, Danny?
LEADMALE:Why, you got a forklift?
LEADMALE:Will?
LEADFEMALE:What? Aren't you forgetting something? I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, thanks a lot.
LEADMALE:I'll help you, Vivian.
SUPMALE:Now, I apologize.
SUPFEMALE:You were right.
SUPFEMALE:I have a responsibility, and I need to be here tonight.
SUPFEMALE:No, you don't.
SUPMALE:You just don't want to sleep on the couch, Philip.
LEADMALE:I hate sleeping on that thing.
LEADFEMALE:It's all lumpy.
LEADMALE:Remember, partners, lots of touching and hugging.
LEADFEMALE:Show each other how you really feel.
LEADMALE:I showed up, didn't I?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Philip, for all the wrong reasons.
LEADFEMALE:What is your problem, honey? Having a baby is spiritual, and wonderful, and miraculous.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't sound miraculous.
LEADMALE:It sounds yucky.
OTHERFEMALE:You should have thought about that seven months ago
LEADFEMALE:before that second bottle of wine, Philip.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Vivian.
LEADMALE:Vivian, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Vivian, come on.
SUPMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, how's your back?
SUPMALE:Are they always like this?
OTHERMALE:No, sometimes they fight.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you better go out.
SUPFEMALE:They might need a ref.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's cool.
LEADFEMALE:I'll stay here and help you out.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Will, I guess I owe you one.
SUPFEMALE:You know what? I am covering the Laker game on Saturday night.
LEADMALE:You want to watch from the press box?
LEADMALE:From the press box? Okay, I can't breathe.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, come on.
LEADMALE:Lie back here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, take it slow.
LEADFEMALE:Take it slow.
LEADFEMALE:Breathe deeply.
LEADFEMALE:Breathe deeply.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, focus.
LEADFEMALE:Focus with me.
LEADFEMALE:Heck of a game, huh? Can I get you anything else?
SUPFEMALE:No, thanks, Tone.
OTHERFEMALE:This is fine.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
SUPMALE:Nothing for you, Will?
LEADMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'm still tripping over that game.
OTHERFEMALE:It was hype.
LEADFEMALE:Like, Worthy passes to Vlade.
LEADMALE:Vlade back to Byron Scott.
LEADFEMALE:Byron Scott back to Vlade.
LEADFEMALE:Vlade gets the ball back to Worthy.
LEADMALE:Worthy gets it, stuffs, pop.
LEADMALE:The Lakers win the game! The Lakers win the game! You know what the high point of the game was for me, huh? What? When you punched Jack Nicholson in the nose for touching your stomach? Indigestion.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I shouldn't have had that third chili dog, huh? So what's with this free-trade agreement? They gonna set it up demographically, or what? Tony, why aren't you driving? 'Cause nobody else is.
SUPFEMALE:The parking lot's all jammed up.
LEADMALE:You gonna eat those fries?
LEADFEMALE:What? What's the matter?
LEADFEMALE:My water broke.
LEADFEMALE:That's cool.
OTHERMALE:We got another one, right here in the fridge.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:I mean, I think I'm having the baby.
LEADFEMALE:I just had the car cleaned.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you hold it for a couple of hours? I think that means, "No, Tone.
OTHERFEMALE:" Do something, man! You think I got time to Scotchgard?
SUPFEMALE:The woman's having a baby, you idiot.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, I have feelings, you know.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm sorry, Tone.
LEADMALE:Hey, Tone
LEADMALE:Will, I need you.
LEADMALE:Stay.
LEADFEMALE:All right, it's cool, Danny.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I know exactly what to do.
OTHERFEMALE:Help! Help! Help! Help! Damn you.
OTHERMALE:I said, "Help!" Hey, is there a doctor in the parking lot?
LEADMALE:I'm a doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God.
OTHERMALE:Look, Doc, I got a lady in here having a baby.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you're going to have to climb over that car.
LEADFEMALE:That's good.
LEADMALE:All right, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, yo, look out.
LEADFEMALE:Don't, man.
LEADFEMALE:Is there a doctor for the doctor?
OTHERMALE:Hey, how's it going, Danny?
LEADFEMALE:Not too bad.
SUPMALE:It's kind of like trying to squeeze Della Reese out of a Hyundai! All right, it's cool.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look, I'm calling 911.
LEADMALE:Don't bother.
OTHERFEMALE:We're in wall-to-wall traffic.
SUPFEMALE:No ambulance can get through this.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, here comes another one.
OTHERFEMALE:This time you better time me.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:They're 10 seconds apart.
OTHERMALE:You're having a baby.
SUPFEMALE:You think? Danny, all right, look, I know what to do.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:That's it, she'll know what to do.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Hello?
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Wi//.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, slow down.
LEADFEMALE:I can't understand you.
SUPFEMALE:No, I don't know where Mom is.
SUPMALE:Wait, what's the problem? Sure.
SUPMALE:Look, Will, I don't have time for your little pranks.
LEADFEMALE:I have a date.
SUPMALE:What are you doing? Look, I'm not even playing that stupid murder game, so Look, don't aim that thing at me.
SUPMALE:Hilary, are you there? Well, I hope you're all happy.
LEADFEMALE:Now I'm gonna have a big, ugly, red circle in the middle of my forehead.
LEADFEMALE:I'll look just like Carlton's yearbook picture.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, no, don't hang up! Hilary.
SUPMALE:Danny, what are we gonna do?
LEADFEMALE:This is unbelievable.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going through all this in the back of a limo because of what went on in the back of my Jeep.
LEADMALE:Wow, I got to get me a Jeep.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Danny, can you do me, like, one real big favor?
OTHERMALE:Sure, what is it?
OTHERMALE:Please don't have this baby now! Relax.
LEADFEMALE:Relax.
LEADFEMALE:I took the classes.
SUPMALE:I read the books.
SUPMALE:I can handle it, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I can't take it! I can't take it! I can't take it! Help! Sorry, buddy, there ain't no doctor out here.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, man, I don't need a doctor, I need an exorcist.
LEADMALE:Will, there's a bottle of Dom Perignon over in the bar over there.
OTHERMALE:Get it.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think so, Danny.
LEADMALE:You seem like you might be kind of a mean drunk.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to drink it.
SUPMALE:I want you to smack me over the head with it!
OTHERFEMALE:What?
LEADMALE:Just until I pass out.
LEADFEMALE:This baby's on its way, and I think it's bringing luggage.
SUPFEMALE:It can't be on its way now.
SUPMALE:You've only been in labor for 10 minutes.
SUPMALE:Tell him.
LEADFEMALE:He's coming!
OTHERMALE:Get out of my way.
LEADMALE:Wait, Danny, where are you going? If I run really fast I can get back to the Forum and have my baby on the floor
LEADFEMALE:of a ladies' room with some dignity.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, Danny, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on.
LEADMALE:All right, you win.
SUPFEMALE:Where's that champagne bottle? Yo, guess who? Not now, man.
LEADFEMALE:We got an emergency in here.
OTHERMALE:Hence, Dr.
LEADMALE:Finkelbaum.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you a doctor, man?
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I love you, man.
LEADFEMALE:I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Move.
LEADFEMALE:So what seems to be the problem here? I broke a nail.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell do you think?
LEADMALE:Lie back.
SUPFEMALE:Just relax, Danny.
OTHERMALE:He's here to help you.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Tone, what took you so long? I was looking for a doctor, and I found an M.
LEADMALE:D.
OTHERMALE:License plate.
LEADFEMALE:I yanked the guy out of his car, and then I realized M.
LEADMALE:D.
LEADFEMALE:Stands for Mike Ditka.
LEADMALE:Fortunately, the car he threw me up against belonged to Dr.
LEADMALE:Finkelbaum, here.
LEADMALE:Is this the lady having a baby?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Hey, thanks a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Right this way, man.
OTHERFEMALE:We got some sodas in the fridge.
LEADMALE:I called him from Finkelbaum's car.
SUPFEMALE:I called him from Ditka's car.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADMALE:We got some brews, a little bit of Malt Duck.
SUPFEMALE:Get this kid out of me.
SUPFEMALE:I got to make a phone call.
SUPFEMALE:I suddenly miss my mother.
SUPFEMALE:Danny, thanks for a wonderful evening.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call you.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Will, don't leave me.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Danny.
LEADFEMALE:I'll stay here, and I'll help you focus.
LEADMALE:Focus? I don't want to focus.
SUPMALE:I want drugs! Now, get out in that parking lot and score! Here we go.
OTHERMALE:It's Danny, isn't it? Bear down.
SUPFEMALE:Danny, think of it as the World Series, all right? All right, Alomar is rounding third.
SUPFEMALE:Here comes the throw.
SUPMALE:Slide, Danny, slide.
SUPMALE:Here comes your baby, Danny.
LEADMALE:Push! Here you are, Danny.
SUPMALE:A beautiful healthy boy.
OTHERMALE:You want to hold him? No.
LEADMALE:No, thanks.
LEADMALE:I'll wait till somebody run him through a car wash or something.
LEADFEMALE:Come here, man.
LEADMALE:Yeah, calm him down.
SUPMALE:Get busy.
OTHERMALE:Put your thing down.
SUPMALE:It's your birthday.
LEADMALE:It's been one hell of a night, huh, Danny? And, look, I went and saved the best for last.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I did.
SUPMALE:Yes, I did.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, yo, yo.
OTHERMALE:Anybody home? Shabba! Get off me, man.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, what are you doing sleeping on the couch? My chiropractor recommended it.
LEADFEMALE:As you know, Will, I have a separation in my lower lumbar area
OTHERMALE:and the couch is perfect to align my
SUPMALE:She threw you out, huh? You got that right.
LEADFEMALE:Hear you had a pretty full night, too, huh?
SUPMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, I got to tell you, when Danny went into labor, man
LEADMALE:I was trying to get the heck out of there.
LEADFEMALE:I heard that.
LEADFEMALE:But then it was, like All of a sudden, it was a little alive wiggly thing, you know? Ten fingers, and ten toes, and everything.
LEADMALE:It was so small.
SUPFEMALE:I was the first person the baby saw, you know, upside down.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like quite an experience, Will.
LEADMALE:It was.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna go give Danny a call at the hospital.
LEADMALE:See how little Jackie Robinson Mitchell is doing, huh?
SUPFEMALE:Good night, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, Will.
LEADMALE:Well, bet you feel like a big dope, huh? Vivian, I made a decision.
OTHERFEMALE:I really want to be in the room when you give birth.
SUPFEMALE:Not just because you want me there but because I want to be the first person our baby sees upside down.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, that's a beautiful thing to say.
SUPFEMALE:But, I'm afraid, honey, that I'm gonna have to kill you, anyway.
LEADFEMALE:No, Viv.
LEADMALE:No, Vivian! And, look, I went and saved the best for last.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Well, Will, I pressed 180 today.
LEADFEMALE:Eat your heart out.
SUPMALE:Way to go, Arnold Schwarzenegro.
LEADMALE:You know, I've had it up to here with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Right now, me and you, mano a mano.
OTHERMALE:Let's go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:You're on.
LEADMALE:Go.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Carlton, you can't keep moping around like this forever.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's not like you and Paula just broke up yesterday, man.
LEADMALE:You've had the whole weekend to get over it.
LEADFEMALE:Will, sometimes you're so insensitive.
LEADFEMALE:Love isn't something you can just turn on and off.
LEADMALE:Carlton, I still think you're blowing this whole thing out of proportion, man.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I've seen Paula, and I don't see what the attraction was.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about? She's a beautiful, intelligent girl with a dynamite body.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see what attracted her to you.
OTHERMALE:These are jokes, man.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta loosen up.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta have some fun.
LEADMALE:You gotta do something or go someplace that gets her off your mind.
SUPMALE:It's impossible.
OTHERMALE:Everywhere I turn, I see something that reminds me of her.
LEADFEMALE:Something we've shared together, a patch of grass, a beach blanket, a swing.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you should go to bed.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian, why are you making such a big deal about this?
LEADMALE:I say we do it right here, right now.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good, a floor show.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, this envelope contains Mrs.
LEADMALE:Banks' sonogram.
LEADMALE:It's gonna tell us whether or not the baby is a boy or a girl.
LEADMALE:How can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, you are so naive.
LEADFEMALE:If it's a boy, it's blue.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, I think it's time for another woman-to-woman talk.
LEADMALE:Okay, what do you want to know this time? Hilary's not planning on having kids, is she? Philip, I am not looking at this sonogram.
LEADFEMALE:It'll take away the excitement in the delivery room.
SUPMALE:Honey, half the thrill is finding out.
SUPFEMALE:All right, then, it's settled.
LEADFEMALE:We don't want to know.
LEADMALE:Of course, in the delivery room, I'm going to be too busy screaming.
LEADMALE:Okay, I want to know.
SUPMALE:No, I don't.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADMALE:Now this is exactly why the doctor changed his number on us, Vivian.
SUPMALE:Now for the last time, do you want to know or don't you?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Fine, then I'll take the envelope.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to open it.
LEADFEMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:Trust me.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Viv, I don't think so.
LEADMALE:See, this is the same dude that said a squirrel ate that six-pack of Milky Ways.
LEADMALE:I think Geoffrey should hold onto it.
LEADMALE:Fine, and don't give it to us.
SUPMALE:No matter how much we insist.
SUPMALE:Got it? I think I can handle that.
OTHERMALE:I got dressed all by myself this morning.
LEADMALE:I feel good about this, Philip.
SUPMALE:I think we're doing the right thing, don't you? Yes, I agree, baby.
SUPMALE:We're doing the right thing.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil? Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, sure, Will.
LEADMALE:What is it? Look, a friend of mine has a little problem.
LEADFEMALE:And, you know, I was wondering
OTHERFEMALE:since you're a judge and everything
OTHERMALE:I am not reducing bail.
LEADFEMALE:No, Uncle Phil, no.
OTHERMALE:See, that's not See, check it out.
OTHERMALE:Now, this friend of mine knows this squaw that he's completely in love with, right? But this particular squaw just broke up with his best friend.
LEADMALE:Now he don't want to diss his boy or nothing like that, right but he wants to know how long is a good time to wait before he raids this squaw's village, if you know what I'm saying.
SUPMALE:Interesting you should bring that up.
SUPFEMALE:I had a case like that come before me just recently.
SUPMALE:Really?
SUPFEMALE:Word up.
LEADFEMALE:Now this guy started going out with his best friend's girl hours after they broke up.
SUPFEMALE:He waited that long? Well, this other guy didn't think it was that long.
LEADFEMALE:He was very jealous, and he shot his friend.
OTHERFEMALE:Dead? No.
OTHERMALE:Let's just say he's two olives short of a martini.
SUPMALE:So before your friend starts raiding any villages he better be sure it's worth it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Paula.
LEADFEMALE:How're you doing? It's Will.
LEADFEMALE:Look, about our date tonight I'll rock your world.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, is Mrs.
LEADMALE:Banks around?
LEADMALE:I believe I believe she's in the study.
LEADFEMALE:Shall I get her?
LEADMALE:No! No, you do too much running around, as it is.
LEADMALE:I hate having you run and do everything.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks, have you been drinking?
LEADMALE:Of course not.
LEADMALE:You know, and I'd feel a lot better if you started calling me Phil.
LEADFEMALE:And I'd feel a lot better if you'd wash your own underthings.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Geoffrey now I know Mrs.
SUPMALE:Banks and I made you promise not to show us that sonogram but, look, I've got to know whether the baby is a boy or a girl and I can make it worth your while.
SUPMALE:How does a $100 sound?
LEADFEMALE:Like one hell of a night in Tijuana.
LEADMALE:Philip Banks, you really should be ashamed of yourself.
SUPMALE:Bribing Geoffrey with a $100.
LEADFEMALE:I'll say.
SUPMALE:At least she offered me $200.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Hi, Paula.
OTHERMALE:Carlton's not here.
LEADMALE:Well, who'd you want to talk to? Just a second.
OTHERMALE:It's for you.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Paula as in Carlton's ex-girlfriend, Paula.
LEADFEMALE:Gee I wonder why she want to talk to me.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should just find out.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Paula, how're you doing? Hey, I'm really looking forward to tonight, so we can work on some homework.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but you should probably get some rest.
LEADFEMALE:We might have to pull an all nighter.
LEADMALE:Talk to you later.
LEADFEMALE:Will, dating Carlton's ex behind his back isn't nice.
OTHERMALE:Ashley's right.
SUPFEMALE:If Carlton finds out, he may never speak to you again.
LEADMALE:Maybe you're on to something.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold it.
LEADFEMALE:First, look, number one Carlton is not even dating this girl no more.
SUPFEMALE:Okay? Number two, I ain't see no rings on her fingers.
SUPFEMALE:Okay? And number three, Denise got it going on.
LEADFEMALE:Paula.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:I hope that doesn't happen tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, that Paula's really bad news.
LEADMALE:First, she dumps me.
LEADMALE:Now you know what she did? No.
SUPMALE:Will, do you know? No, I don't know nothing.
LEADMALE:I'm just a poor black man trying to make it in Bel-Air.
OTHERFEMALE:She gave me the flu.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, come on, look on the bright side, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Most girls don't give you nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, baby, how was school?
SUPMALE:Mommy, I don't feel so good.
LEADMALE:I think I got the flu.
LEADFEMALE:That's too bad, baby.
LEADMALE:Get out of the house.
OTHERMALE:You know, we're getting more and more like the Jackson family every day.
OTHERMALE:Sweetheart, you know I love you but being pregnant, I cannot take a chance of getting sick.
OTHERFEMALE:Now shoo.
SUPFEMALE:But where will I go? Well, I guess you'll have to move into the pool house.
LEADFEMALE:The pool house? Daddy, I live in the pool house.
LEADMALE:And there's no way I'm giving it up for Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:You want to start paying rent? I can be out in an hour.
SUPMALE:Will, I am not through with you.
LEADMALE:What you're doing is despicable.
SUPMALE:And what you're doing is annoying.
SUPMALE:Leave me alone.
LEADMALE:Gesundheit.
LEADFEMALE:Will, just a week ago, she was Carlton's girlfriend.
LEADMALE:Doesn't that mean anything to you? Yes, Ashley, it means she's having a better week.
SUPMALE:Well, Carlton's going to put two and two together.
LEADFEMALE:First, Paula had the flu, then Carlton had the flu and now you have the flu.
LEADMALE:Ashley, I think you're giving Carlton too much credit.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, come on, he thinks X is the movie about Malcolm-Jamal Warner's fight for freedom.
LEADFEMALE:Very funny, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you stop spinning? Who moved the refrigerator all the way over there? How are you feeling, Carlton? Remember the Star Trek where the insect bored its way through the guy's brain?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:That'd feel kind of good right now.
LEADMALE:Okay, Will, I'm on to you.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look, Carlton, man, I have no idea what you're talking about.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not stupid, Will.
LEADMALE:It's all coming together.
SUPFEMALE:The runny nose, the watery eyes.
SUPFEMALE:You just couldn't keep your hands to yourself.
OTHERMALE:Look, Carlton, now I know you're sick.
LEADFEMALE:You're probably a little delirious.
SUPMALE:You probably had one too many of them children's aspirins or something, man.
LEADFEMALE:That piece was mine.
LEADFEMALE:You ain't got to get all nasty.
LEADMALE:Well, you shouldn't have done it, Will.
SUPFEMALE:I know, Carlton.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, man.
SUPMALE:I shouldn't have taken Paula out.
OTHERMALE:You're right, man, but she was coming on to me.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't resist, man.
LEADMALE:Paula? I was talking about that last piece of cheesecake.
SUPMALE:Yeah, so was I.
LEADMALE:No, see, you don't know about it.
LEADFEMALE:See, you ain't hip to it, right? In Philly, we name our food, right? See, like cheesecake is Paula, right? And a Snack Pack is Boomshika.
SUPFEMALE:I can't see him.
SUPMALE:You can.
LEADMALE:Is he buying it? You backstabbing, girlfriend-stealing, piece of rubbish.
LEADMALE:Did you really expect me to believe you name your food? Look, Carlton, I'm telling you, man, it ain't how it seems, man.
LEADMALE:Then you didn't go out with my girlfriend behind my back? Okay, that's exactly how it seems.
SUPMALE:But, look, man, I didn't do it for me.
SUPFEMALE:I did it for you.
LEADFEMALE:I did it to save you from something terrible.
OTHERMALE:As soon as I figure it out, I'll let you know what it is.
OTHERFEMALE:Every time you've tried to hurt me, I've turned the other cheek.
LEADMALE:Well, I've run out of cheeks.
LEADMALE:Carlton, man, what are you trying to say? I'm trying to say that I can't trust you anymore.
SUPMALE:Look, we're no longer family.
SUPMALE:We're through.
LEADMALE:Fini.
SUPMALE:It's over.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Carlton, you don't mean that.
LEADFEMALE:You'll get over it, man.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah?
LEADMALE:Carlton, who are you calling?
LEADFEMALE:Your mother.
LEADFEMALE:I know he ain't calling my mother.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Vy, it's Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Call me when you get home.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mom, don't call him.
LEADFEMALE:I want to tell you how much I hate Will's guts.
SUPMALE:He's lying, Mom.
SUPMALE:He loves me.
SUPFEMALE:No, I don't.
LEADFEMALE:Your little slimer's stolen my girl.
LEADMALE:Mom, you know Carlton never had no girl.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm glad you're out having fun 'cause I have to stay here, 'cause God only knows what else he'll steal.
LEADFEMALE:Give me the phone.
LEADMALE:Get off! Hey, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the sweater.
LEADMALE:Love you.
LEADFEMALE:You've gone over the line.
SUPMALE:Okay? You don't never call a dude's mom.
LEADFEMALE:So it's okay to steal a guy's girlfriend as long as you don't go tell his mommy about it.
OTHERFEMALE:No, this is serious, man.
SUPMALE:Even in ancient times they would kill your cattle, they would burn your village and they would stone your family but they wouldn't never tell your mother, man.
LEADMALE:"But I did it to save you "from something you don't know "and soon as I figure it out, I'll let you know.
LEADMALE:" That's it.
OTHERMALE:We're going to have to take this to the street, man.
LEADMALE:Aunt Viv! Now, listen, as long as you're staying in my home, you have to play by my rules.
SUPMALE:No crumbs on the carpet, no hair in the sink and no dressing up in my clothes, Carlton.
LEADMALE:It was Halloween.
LEADFEMALE:You still haven't returned my bustier.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here?
LEADFEMALE:Look, man, I don't want to be here but I'm sick, and Aunt Viv won't let me stay in the house.
LEADMALE:I think you have everything you need.
SUPMALE:And now if you'll excuse me I'm going to spend a quiet evening with my radio and Madonna.
LEADFEMALE:Look like you spending the evening with Little Richard.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't care what Mom says.
OTHERMALE:You're not staying here.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go stay with Paula?
LEADMALE:She asked.
LEADMALE:Her parents wouldn't let me.
LEADFEMALE:She has parents? She never introduced me to her parents.
LEADFEMALE:She told me they were dead.
LEADFEMALE:I really, really hate you.
LEADFEMALE:I hate you, too.
LEADMALE:Just get out of my bed, then.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, nice, firm mattress, just like the one at Paula's house.
LEADFEMALE:First, you steal my woman, and now you steal my bed.
LEADMALE:Look, man, let's get something straight right now.
LEADFEMALE:I did not steal your woman.
LEADFEMALE:I rescued her, and she thanked me over and over, and over All right, stop singing.
SUPFEMALE:Over and over and over.
LEADMALE:Why don't you act like an adult?
OTHERMALE:Why don't you look like one? Well, obviously, there's no reasoning with you.
LEADFEMALE:Look, you just stay on your side of the room, and I'll stay on mine.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:This is my side of the room.
OTHERMALE:Hey, that's not fair.
LEADMALE:Guess I'll watch a little TV, seeing as how it's on my side of the room.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, where's the remote?
SUPFEMALE:On my side of the room.
LEADFEMALE:Toss it here.
LEADMALE:Whatever you say.
SUPFEMALE:Go get it.
LEADFEMALE:Make me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh God, my eye! Will, you okay? Thank you for giving me the night off.
LEADMALE:Can I get you anything else? No, get out of here, you knucklehead.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, I want that sonogram.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:There's nothing here or here.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's got to be here.
SUPMALE:We searched the whole house, Vivian.
LEADMALE:Well, what if he's got it on him?
LEADFEMALE:Found it.
LEADMALE:You found the sonogram? No, it's that little chocolate bunny from Easter.
SUPFEMALE:I've been looking all over for it.
LEADMALE:Philip, honey, at least take off the foil.
SUPMALE:My head is killing me.
SUPFEMALE:My throat hurts.
LEADFEMALE:Now my ears are ringing.
SUPMALE:Mine, too.
LEADMALE:Hi, this is Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Roses are red, violets are blue, l'm not in so so leave a Hi, honey, it's Paula.
LEADMALE:l just heard you were sick.
LEADFEMALE:My poor little baby.
LEADMALE:This is all my fault, isn't it?
OTHERMALE:It's for me, man.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
LEADFEMALE:It's for me.
LEADFEMALE:l wish l could be there with you.
LEADFEMALE:l bet l know how to make you feel better.
LEADMALE:First, l'd nibble on your left ear, then l'd bite you on your neck.
OTHERMALE:Then l'd Oops.
OTHERFEMALE:There's my other line.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Now look what you did, you idiot.
LEADFEMALE:You made me miss her call.
LEADMALE:That wasn't for you.
LEADMALE:It was for me.
LEADMALE:Carlton, give it up, man.
LEADFEMALE:She dumped you.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're like Prince Charles.
LEADMALE:You got the royal flush.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to beat your butt.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, what are you going to do? Jump up and bang your head against it?
LEADMALE:Come on, put your dukes up.
SUPMALE:Come on, boy.
SUPFEMALE:And there's more where that came from.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe not.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to do something that's totally outside of my nature and I'm gonna take Uncle Phil's advice.
OTHERMALE:You're gonna go play on the freeway? No, man, I'm going to be straight up with you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to tell you everything that happened between me and Paula.
LEADFEMALE:First time you brought her over here, man, I thought she was so fine and I wanted y'all to break up.
LEADFEMALE:That's very honest, Will, but I'm still mad.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'll have to live with it.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, there's more.
SUPMALE:I told her you had tuberculosis.
LEADMALE:You what? Honest, I don't know, man.
LEADFEMALE:It just came to me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you did that.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna dig way down deep inside and maybe, in time, I'll be able to forgive you.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:There's more.
LEADFEMALE:I told her about your hand puppet.
LEADFEMALE:You told her about Binky? I'll kill you.
OTHERMALE:No, I won't.
LEADMALE:I'm bigger than that.
SUPMALE:I guess I'll be honest, too.
LEADMALE:You remember when Letisha suddenly stopped calling you? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, I told her you worship Satan.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Fair is fair.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a man.
OTHERMALE:I can live with that.
SUPMALE:I can live with that.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, there's more.
SUPMALE:You notice how Ashley has been acting very funny around you lately? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I told her you shave your legs.
OTHERMALE:What kind of monster are you?
OTHERMALE:Sorry, Will.
OTHERMALE:I was just feeling a little jealous of your relationship.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's unforgivable.
LEADFEMALE:That's totally unforgivable.
LEADMALE:Wait, there's more.
LEADFEMALE:You remember your friend Jazz?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, what did you do with Jazz? You know that funky smell coming from the basement? Psych.
SUPFEMALE:This honesty thing feels great.
LEADMALE:What do you say we tell Geoffrey why his citizenship never came through? This smells delicious.
LEADMALE:You've really outdone yourself, Mom.
LEADMALE:Great oatmeal, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Viv, in keeping with this new honesty thing this stuff kind of tastes like dry wall with raisins in it.
LEADMALE:And, Uncle Phil, you know you really shouldn't wear silk no more 'cause, like, when big folks wear silk Well, since we're all being honest with each other I'm bloody sick of the two of you going through my drawers.
SUPFEMALE:Here's your envelope.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you get what you want.
LEADMALE:In keeping with all this honesty, I really want to see what we're having.
LEADMALE:You mean this isn't oatmeal? I want to know, too, Philip.
LEADMALE:Okay, let's have a look at that sonogram.

SUPMALE:Hey, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Master William.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Viv, I got the cake you wanted for the family reunion.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:And guess what's in here? It's round, it's rubber and you'll never use it.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, can we please keep your hand puppet out of this? Look, it's a California's driver's license.
LEADMALE:I think you're confused, Will.
SUPFEMALE:You need a license to drive a car, not steal one.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, Carlton, I didn't understand you, I don't speak pygmy.
LEADFEMALE:Diva! Will, what do you think you're doing? I'm practicing for when my mom and all my aunts get here.
LEADMALE:I am so excited, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you excited? No.
LEADMALE:I hate family reunions.
LEADFEMALE:I always do all the work.
SUPMALE:Philip, that is not true.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, this is not the kind of juice Vy drinks and Helen does not like this kind of bread.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I will have to take it back to the store.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, let me do that.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Would you pick me up a gallon of Rocky Road and some sardines.
LEADMALE:And don't eat it all on the way home like you did last time.
OTHERMALE:Look who we found.
OTHERMALE:Diva! Helen, oh, God! Let me look at you.
LEADFEMALE:Let me look at it, let me look at it.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God, Frank, how are you?
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine, how you doing? Let me look at Frank, Jr.
LEADFEMALE:My goodness, where did you get those beautiful green eyes? I'm guessing, the guy with no rhythm.
LEADFEMALE:You mean Carlton? Diva! Whoa, whoa, think you could all come together next time?
LEADMALE:This is exhausting.
SUPFEMALE:Let me look at you all.
LEADMALE:Vivian, girl, you are glowing.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:That's 'cause she be spending a lot of time in front of the microwave.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, that reminds me.
LEADFEMALE:Would you pick me up some microwave popcorn, please? You know, next time I'm going to get pregnant.
LEADMALE:Well, you certainly have the pants for it.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, if I would have said that I would have gotten smacked in my head.
LEADMALE:Look at Little Frank.
LEADFEMALE:Now that's the first time a man has smiled at me since my divorce.
LEADMALE:Aunt Helen, I just want to say how sorry I am things didn't work out between you and Uncle Lester.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:Do you think he'll still be sending me a gift for graduation? How has he been acting since the divorce? Awful.
LEADMALE:I hate that man.
LEADMALE:But I don't like to badmouth him without the kid around.
SUPMALE:You know, it's like doing the work twice.
OTHERMALE:Where's Vy? Now, she said she has some really big news.
SUPFEMALE:You know, she told me the same thing.
OTHERMALE:Isn't it obvious? Really big news? She must be bringing me Grandma's diamond earrings.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:Do you like them? Aunt Janice, I never got to know Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:I'd really like to have something of hers.
SUPMALE:Listen, honey, I have a beautiful silk handkerchief of Grandma's.
SUPMALE:Yeah, like I really want some old lady's snot rag.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, she said it was something about Robert.
OTHERMALE:Now, ladies, this could be an engagement announcement.
LEADMALE:You know it could
SUPMALE:Come on! No! Maybe the big news is something else.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe she got cable.
OTHERMALE:Divas!
OTHERFEMALE:Big Diva.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Mom, it's a terrible idea marrying this Robert dude, it's a big mistake.
OTHERFEMALE:Baby, I'm not marrying Robert, we broke up.
LEADMALE:Vy, now come
LEADFEMALE:That's the big news.
LEADMALE:My goodness.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Honey, what happened, tell us.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:He just wanted more out of the relationship and I wasn't sure I could spend the rest of my life with him.
LEADMALE:Amen.
SUPFEMALE:And, Will's never been too fond of him.
LEADFEMALE:No, Will was not.
LEADMALE:So, in the long run it seemed like the best thing.
SUPMALE:Well Hey, you know, Vy, I have a brother who's single.
LEADMALE:Although, he's not a brother.
LEADMALE:I mean he is a brother because he's my brother, but he's just not your kind of brother.
SUPMALE:Oh, brother.
LEADFEMALE:Help me, Will.
LEADMALE:No, I think I'm going to stick with the black folks on this one.
SUPFEMALE:I love you so much, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too, sweetie.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, it's great having you out here.
LEADFEMALE:Especially without that Robert dude.
LEADFEMALE:Getting all in our hair.
SUPMALE:Trying like a damn fool to win me over.
LEADMALE:You're not kidding, baby.
LEADMALE:You know, for your graduation, he actually wanted to buy you a car.
LEADFEMALE:A car?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you dumped him anyway, Ma.
LEADMALE:What kind of car he want to get me, Mom? Okay, set everything on the island.
SUPMALE:We'll use it tomorrow to serve.
LEADMALE:Let me take that, Vivian, wouldn't want you to overexert yourself.
LEADMALE:Philip, are you upset with me? Vivian, for the past 48 hours, all I've heard 
LEADFEMALE:"Philip, wash this.
OTHERMALE:Philip, dust that.
LEADFEMALE:"Philip, push me up the steps, I'm pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:" As long as you're not upset with me.
LEADMALE:Sir, when she's not looking, break one of her crystal figurines.
SUPMALE:It'll work wonders for your attitude.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes!
LEADFEMALE:Hello, everybody.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, girl.
LEADMALE:You guys missed a great afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:So did you.
SUPMALE:We were down at the news station.
SUPMALE:We got to polish the silver.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you, Hilary's the best weather girl I've ever seen.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:She's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:She's poised.
SUPFEMALE:She's articulate.
LEADMALE:God, I'm really enjoying all of this, but please stop.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Frank, honey, I think it's time to change Frank, Jr.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, babe.
SUPFEMALE:You know what, you look a little tired.
OTHERMALE:Why don't you come and lay down
SUPFEMALE:and I'll rub your feet for a little while.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, baby.
SUPMALE:That does it, I'm getting me a white man.
OTHERMALE:Girl, stop it.
LEADFEMALE:No, just to help around the house a little bit.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come on, you know you all were thinking it.
LEADMALE:I'm never driving in a car with Uncle Lou and Aunt Eleanor again.
SUPMALE:Honey, what happened?
OTHERMALE:They were blasting the radio sticking their heads through the sunroof, and yelling at other cars.
LEADFEMALE:When they weren't doing that, they were making out.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, when are those two going to grow up? Honey, stop it.
SUPMALE:Aunt Eleanor.
SUPMALE:Hey, get your own girl.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Eleanor.
OTHERMALE:Hi, Uncle Lou.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Look at you two.
LEADFEMALE:Gosh, you look like a couple of kids.
LEADFEMALE:You look like a couple of kids yourself.
OTHERMALE:You all got to remember, she carrying Uncle Phil's child.
LEADFEMALE:Lou, I want to go up and freshen up.
SUPMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:See you all tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what does Aunt Eleanor have that I don't? A horny husband.
LEADFEMALE:This is just so great, my whole family under one roof.
LEADMALE:You know, I just wish that we could all be together all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Baby, at least you and I are going to be together in a few months.
SUPMALE:Get the y ou moving to L.
OTHERFEMALE:A? No, silly, I'm talking about when you graduate high school and move back home.
SUPMALE:It'll be just like old times, baby, just you and me.
OTHERFEMALE:We can do everything together.
OTHERFEMALE:I can hardly wait.
LEADFEMALE:I've looked forward to this for so long.
LEADFEMALE:And /'ve got so many things p/anned.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I came to tuck you in.
SUPFEMALE:Here you go.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Mom.
LEADMALE:Can we talk about me moving back home? You're excited, too, huh?
SUPMALE:Look, now that you mention it, Mom
SUPFEMALE:Baby, I got your room fixed up so nice.
LEADMALE:And keep your fingers crossed because I got a friend at U of P who thinks she might be able to pull some strings with your application.
SUPMALE:Heck, with me working around the corner, we could have lunch together every day.
LEADFEMALE:Every day.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll tell you, baby, these past few days with you have been so great
LEADFEMALE:I haven't thought about Robert once.
SUPFEMALE:Really? 'Cause, yo, I've been thinking about him all the time.
SUPFEMALE:You just get some rest, and we'll talk some more tomorrow.
SUPMALE:I'll get it! Hey, Al!
SUPFEMALE:How you doing, Mr.

LEADMALE:It ain't nobody, Mama.
LEADMALE:Get your big old butt back in here then.
LEADMALE:Look here, Mom.
SUPMALE:What's that? A letter from Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:And the boy sent a picture.
LEADMALE:Look at that, he look great.
SUPMALE:And he's so tall.
SUPMALE:Lord, who'd of thought he'd shoot up 12 inches in his freshman year.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear Will, and Aunt Vy "enjoying a relaxing vacation with Miriah and the kids.
LEADFEMALE:"It's great to be rich, hah, hah.
LEADMALE:"Love, Carlton.
SUPMALE:"P.
LEADFEMALE:S.
OTHERFEMALE:It's really, really great to be rich.
LEADFEMALE:"Hah, hah.
SUPMALE:" Isn't it nice to hear from Carlton? Baby, why ain't you got on that leisure suit I laid out for you? Because I'm a 72-year-old man still living with his mother.
LEADMALE:And I'm tired of it, Mom.
SUPMALE:I mean, I want to get married.
LEADMALE:And I want to have some kids.
SUPMALE:And I don't want nobody telling me what to wear.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You the man, you the man.
LEADFEMALE:About time I start treating you like one.
LEADFEMALE:You've got that right.
LEADFEMALE:Can I have $10 to go to the movies? Sure, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Here you go.
OTHERMALE:Another dollar for some Gummy Bears.
SUPFEMALE:You taking anybody special? Harriet Jenkins.
LEADMALE:You're spending my social security on Harriet Jenkins.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Mama, I'm going to tell you, if you mess this date up for me
LEADFEMALE:I'm moving out of here.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I Swear.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You know, I was looking in the paper the other day and I saw Robert's picture.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Lord, here come Robert again.
LEADMALE:You remember him, don't you, the man that proposed to me? I remember.
LEADMALE:His wife dead yet?
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Damn, got to use more dynamite next time.
LEADFEMALE:Lord know, he a rich man.
LEADFEMALE:Handsome, too.
LEADFEMALE:Even hear he giving money to the church.
LEADMALE:But I tell you one thing, baby I sure am glad that you talked me out of marrying him.
OTHERMALE:Okay, Ma, you win.
LEADMALE:I'll cancel my date with Harriet.
LEADMALE:Baby, you ain't got to do that.
SUPMALE:You just put on that leisure suit.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call Harriet.
OTHERMALE:I'm still half asleep, so don't nobody talk to me.
SUPMALE:Did the baby wake you up?
LEADFEMALE:Eleanor and Lou woke me up.
OTHERMALE:I swear that man's part jackhammer.
SUPMALE:Lord, they didn't even eat this much at the Last Supper.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess you old enough to remember.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but I'm still young enough to kick your butt.
LEADFEMALE:What are you all doing up?
LEADFEMALE:Eating and talking about sex.
OTHERMALE:Personally, I prefer eating.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to wait an hour for seconds.
SUPMALE:All right! Well, Vy, tell me, what's the real deal between you and Robert?
SUPMALE:I wasn't in love with him.
LEADFEMALE:Girl, are you crazy? That man had a business, a car and money.
LEADMALE:Now, what's love got to do with it? Can we just for once have a conversation without my name being mentioned? Sure, Vy.
LEADFEMALE:Why is a certain person ruining Will's life by moving him back to Philly? Why doesn't a certain person stick a drumstick in her mouth and call it a day? Wait a minute, now, Vy.
SUPFEMALE:We all family here and we all care about Will.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, do I tell you how to raise your son? No, but I wish you would.
LEADFEMALE:Vy, I really think Will had his heart set on going to school in California.
SUPMALE:So this is how it is? Once again my family has taken it upon themselves to decide that Vy don't know how to take care of her own.
LEADFEMALE:No, you're wrong.
SUPFEMALE:You're wrong.
SUPMALE:And I'll thank all of you to keep your noses out of my personal affairs.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, everybody, who's going to bless this table? Come on, you all.
SUPMALE:I think it ought to be the oldest, Vy.
LEADMALE:I am not the oldest, Uncle Lou is.
SUPMALE:He's young to me.
LEADMALE:Lou!
LEADMALE:Yes, yes, okay, okay.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Dear Lord, we thank you for bringing our family together.
OTHERFEMALE:Keep us safe and healthy so that we can come together again.
LEADMALE:And, we thank Philip and Vivian for their hospitality
OTHERMALE:and their Jacuzzi.
SUPMALE:Amen.
LEADFEMALE:Enjoying the reunion, Master William? I don't know what to do, G.
LEADFEMALE:I mean I don't want to move back to Philly, but I don't want to let my mom down.
OTHERFEMALE:But then on the other hand, it's like I'm so terribly sorry, Master William, there's been a misunderstanding.
LEADMALE:Apparently, I gave you the impression that I really wanted to know.
OTHERFEMALE:Where did Uncle Lou and Aunt Eleanor disappear to? Oh, my God, are they at it again? Those two are animals.
LEADFEMALE:I was in the bathroom.
LEADMALE:Get your minds out the gutter.
LEADFEMALE:What? Now, Will, about your moving back to Philly.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know, the sheets and bed linens stay here.
LEADFEMALE:No, well, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:No, what I was going to say was I hope that money wasn't a part of your decision because I'd be more than happy to help you with your tuition.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil but I need to be in Philly, you know, with my mom.
SUPMALE:Whatever you decide, I just want you to know that I'm behind you 100o/o.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks and it means a lot to me, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, son.
SUPMALE:Okay, Vivian, I told him everything you wanted me to now give me my piece of pie.
SUPFEMALE:Baby.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what's up, Mom?
LEADFEMALE:I have a little surprise for you.
OTHERMALE:Yeah? Yes, I got a great deal on a cruise and I am sending you to the Caribbean for your graduation.
SUPFEMALE:For real?
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:I always wanted to go to the Caribbean.
LEADMALE:It'll be so great, baby.
LEADMALE:We could go snorkeling and play shuffleboard.
SUPFEMALE:We? You going, too? Well, sure, and it's not locked in yet but I think the entertainment is going to be the new Fifth Dimension.
OTHERMALE:I love them, take me.
LEADMALE:Take me.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, you smell like broccoli.
SUPMALE:What's the matter?
LEADFEMALE:Ma, this is great.
LEADFEMALE:We need to talk and Look, it can't wait.
SUPMALE:We got to talk about this right now.
OTHERMALE:Well, I hate to say I told you so.
OTHERFEMALE:I know what you all are thinking.
LEADMALE:But you're wrong.
LEADMALE:Now, Will is looking forward to moving back to Philly.
OTHERFEMALE:Aren't you, baby? Look what the wind did to my hat.
LEADMALE:Ma, can you help me go find it, please?
LEADFEMALE:Will, what's going on?
SUPFEMALE:Look, Mom, it's We were just
LEADFEMALE:Somebody should fix this light here.
LEADMALE:Yeah, there's some things broken.
LEADMALE:The light, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Walk with me, talk with me, Mom.
LEADMALE:All right, look, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Spit it out.
OTHERMALE:All right, see, I was
LEADMALE:Baby, whatever it is, I will understand.
LEADFEMALE:I know, you'll understand and I'll be on my way to the emergency room.
LEADMALE:Will, just say it.
OTHERMALE:Mom, I don't want to move back home.
LEADMALE:How can you say that? Baby, when I sent you out here, it was only on a temporary basis.
SUPMALE:I always expected you to come back home.
LEADFEMALE:So did I, Mom.
OTHERMALE:And, I know I was tripping when I first came out here 'cause you were right, I needed to be out here.
LEADFEMALE:And I still need to be out here.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's given me a head start so I can break out on my own.
LEADMALE:What about college? You know I can't afford to send you to an out-of-state school.
SUPMALE:I know, Ma, but, look, I was hoping I could get a scholarship or a loan, and Uncle Phil said he'd help me.
LEADFEMALE:And, if that doesn't work, I'll get a job I'll get two jobs, but please, don't make me move back home, Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Obviously, you've given this a lot of thought, huh? But I'll be honest with you, I still want you to come home.
OTHERFEMALE:I miss you.
SUPFEMALE:I miss you, too, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Look, but I'll visit.
OTHERFEMALE:Every Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:And every Easter.
LEADFEMALE:And whatever else of them holidays it'd take to get that evil look out your face.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it sounds like you made up your mind.
LEADFEMALE:So I guess I have to respect your decision.
SUPFEMALE:You do? I mean, you do!
SUPMALE:I love you, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, too, baby.
SUPMALE:As much as I hate to admit it, your aunts were right and I was wrong.
SUPMALE:But don't you dare tell them, you hear me?
SUPFEMALE:Someone should fix this light here.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Someone should fix this light.
LEADFEMALE:Your secret's safe with me.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, when she's not looking, break one of her crystal fusiliers.
SUPMALE:Do you know what a fusilier is? A fusilier, a crystal fusilier.
LEADFEMALE:They must got them in London.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Okay, here we go.
SUPFEMALE:Put down your money, find the honey.
LEADFEMALE:Locate the black queen, and I don't mean Little Richard.
LEADMALE:There! Okay, Carlton, you're pretty good for a white guy.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on out here?
SUPFEMALE:I'm cleaning up, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:I hope they pay you more than they pay me.
LEADMALE:Seriously, Geoffrey, you should get in on this.
LEADMALE:Do you play the Hell's Kitchen version or the A-train hybrid.
OTHERMALE:I'm in.
LEADMALE:All right, here we go.
SUPFEMALE:Zagnut, Goobers, Good & Plenty, locate the black girl, you win $20.
LEADMALE:That one.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! Well, there goes Saturday night at Sizzler.
SUPFEMALE:I had coupons, too.
SUPFEMALE:Beginner's luck, Master William.
SUPMALE:One last bet?
SUPMALE:No, no, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I'm out, G.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't realize you were such a coward.
SUPFEMALE:Chicken.
LEADMALE:All right, don't nobody call me a coward.
SUPMALE:What's your bet?
LEADFEMALE:$50.
SUPMALE:I ain't no punk, I'll take that down.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:I can't look.
LEADMALE:Drat!
SUPFEMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:Oh, damn, G.
LEADFEMALE:Damn! There, see, that one red.
LEADMALE:See, if it was like you, you'd have won, but it red, so you lost.
LEADMALE:Better luck next time.
LEADMALE:He fell for it, Will.
LEADMALE:Now let's go hustle Dad.
SUPMALE:Oops.
OTHERMALE:"Oops"? Good cover.
LEADFEMALE:I'm guessing you've done this before? You're wasting your time, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey already cut out all the bra ads.
LEADMALE:Will, for your information, I was looking at those funny little markings underneath the pictures.
SUPFEMALE:In Bel-Air we call them "words.
SUPMALE:" Guess what, I just finished my first short story.
SUPMALE:What a coincidence, your first short story and your first short son in the same room.
LEADMALE:My friend at Essence magazine offered to read it.
SUPMALE:But, before she does, I wanted to give you a copy and I want you to tell me exactly what you think.
SUPMALE:Great, I can't wait to read it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now that I am a professional I'm gonna go check out that new word processor.
OTHERFEMALE:See you.
LEADFEMALE:That's my little writer.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, somebody bury this.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, are you crazy? If I read this story, it'll be the biggest mistake I've ever made.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know about that, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Remember them plaid shorts you wore last summer? Look, let me tell you boys something about women.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if I read it and say I like it she'll think I'm just trying to make her happy.
LEADFEMALE:If I say I don't like it, she'll stop trying to make me happy.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, women is a trip, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:It's just like, let's say you accidentally scream out the wrong name and they jumping all out the back of your car like that.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what are you going to do, Dad?
LEADMALE:Well, hey, I'm the man of the house.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think I'm gonna do?
LEADMALE:What a man would do.
OTHERFEMALE:Buy her a car and hope she forgets all about this.
SUPMALE:You know, we can really learn a lot from that man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, G, would you make me a sandwich?
LEADFEMALE:But, of course.
LEADFEMALE:Now you're a sandwich.
OTHERFEMALE:You can take it off your head.
LEADMALE:G, something wrong?
LEADMALE:You swindled me.
LEADFEMALE:I was planning to use that money on lottery tickets.
OTHERFEMALE:The jackpot's up to $26,000,000.
SUPMALE:Wow! Could you imagine what life would be like with all that money? Buying whatever you want, driving fancy cars dining in fancy restaurants.
SUPMALE:Wait a second, that is what life is like.
LEADFEMALE:I see this is getting me nowhere.
SUPFEMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me I'm going to enjoy the one thing you can't spoil for me.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, Will.
LEADMALE:I mean, Geoffrey works hard for his money.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You know, we have so much and he has so little.
LEADMALE:Well, now we'll have more.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, absolutely.
LEADFEMALE:Let's play Brainstorm.
LEADMALE:Felix, l'll take Famous Quotes for $100.
LEADMALE:The question is, "What is the motto of The Three Musketeers?" That's an easy one.
OTHERMALE:"Creamy on the inside, smooth on the outside.
LEADMALE:"
LEADMALE:"All for one and one for all!"
LEADMALE:Right again.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you missed that one, G.
LEADMALE:Yeah, even Will could have guessed that one and the only thing he reads is the cereal box.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, at least I don't fit in one.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you're so confident in my lack of ability perhaps you'd like to make a little wager.
LEADMALE:Say, $30?
OTHERMALE:Done.
LEADMALE:Vietnam for $200.
SUPMALE:You drew the wild card.
LEADMALE:What do you say, Geoffrey? Want to double your bet? Well, it is an awful lot of money but, what the hell.
OTHERFEMALE:And the question is.
SUPMALE:' "Who is the South Vietnamese president killed by his own generals in 1963?" Ngo Dinh Diem.
LEADMALE:No guesses? The correct answer is Ngo Dinh Diem.
OTHERMALE:Splendid.
SUPFEMALE:I say we call Immigration.
LEADMALE:Is this Brainstorm? How sad.
LEADMALE:Some people will do anything for money.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, why don't they just ask their fathers? The category is Greek History.
SUPFEMALE:And the final Brainstorm question is.
LEADFEMALE:' "What Bronze Age civilization emerged about 2500 BC?" Oh, I know, the Minoan civilization.
OTHERMALE:The Minoan civilization?
LEADFEMALE:Correct.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold up, hold up.
SUPMALE:Time out.
LEADFEMALE:Flag on the plate, traveling, offsides, clipping.
LEADFEMALE:Hold up, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:What's up with this here?
LEADMALE:Hilary, how'd you know that? Easy, Geoffrey's been watching that tape all day.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm off to the store.
SUPFEMALE:When you're through, do turn off the VCR and return that tape of Brainstorm to my room.
OTHERMALE:And might I add, ha ha! And, ha!
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, come on, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, okay.
LEADMALE:I wonder what Geoffrey uses that cape for.
LEADFEMALE:Just Give me the lottery ticket.
LEADMALE:All right, watch the door.
LEADMALE:Are you sure we should do this?
LEADMALE:Look, come on, man.
SUPFEMALE:He got our money.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it's either this or force him to listen to y oko Ono albums.
LEADMALE:Boys, your mother is driving me crazy about reading that short story.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, Dad, why don't you just read it and get it over with? I did read it.
LEADMALE:Trust me, the only thing your mother should write is checks.
LEADMALE:So, if she asks where I am, you haven't seen me and I'm not at home.
LEADFEMALE:But, Uncle Phil
OTHERFEMALE:No "buts," Will.
LEADFEMALE:No matter what she says, you haven't seen hide nor hair of me.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
OTHERMALE:How long have you been there? You read it.
LEADMALE:You read it and you hated it.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I lost it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, that's it.
SUPFEMALE:And I was so looking forward to reading it.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, that's okay 'cause, you know, I made an extra copy.
LEADMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:And I want you to be honest.
OTHERMALE:I will.
LEADMALE:Oh, check it out.
LEADMALE:The lottery numbers are coming on! Turn it up.
LEADFEMALE:Turn it up.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, Geoffrey, do you have a ticket in today's drawing? And this week's SuperLotto numbers are.
LEADFEMALE:' Sixteen.
LEADMALE:Twenty-two.
OTHERFEMALE:Three.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my!
SUPMALE:Forty-one.

LEADFEMALE:You'll hear a lot of that.
LEADMALE:You're grounded.
LEADMALE:Okay, that about sums up Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, G, what sound do you think accurately depicts your position in the family? You're sick, man.
LEADFEMALE:See a therapist, okay? Hey, Ashley, say something to the baby.
SUPFEMALE:Care to elaborate?
LEADMALE:A lot.
LEADMALE:Don't feel bad.
LEADMALE:She just mad 'cause she found out she ain't adopted.
LEADFEMALE:So Mom's having a baby.
SUPMALE:Big deal.
SUPFEMALE:I bet you didn't go through all this for me.
LEADFEMALE:You probably smoked cigarettes and rode horseback until the day I was born.
LEADMALE:Ashley, honey, come on, we prepared for you and took the same precautions as we did for Hilary and Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Bungee jumping.
SUPMALE:Philip, the baby's moving, feel my stomach.
OTHERMALE:Hey, I move all the time.
LEADFEMALE:Let's have a party.
LEADMALE:All you guys do is talk about the baby.
OTHERFEMALE:The baby's clothes, the baby's room.
SUPMALE:The baby, baby, baby.
SUPMALE:You'll forget all about me after you have it, Mommy.
LEADMALE:I can see it coming.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:Morning, everybody.
OTHERMALE:Geoffrey, my place isn't set, and where's my food? Let me feed my favorite little cousin.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now, come on.
LEADMALE:Oh, I thought it was my turn.
SUPMALE:I thought I was your favorite cousin.
SUPMALE:What do I have to do, spit up on your shirt? Y'all hear something? Yeah, how about me screaming at the top of my lungs? I guess not.
OTHERFEMALE:I be tripping, boy, tripping.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:There's my favorite little girl.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, don't you remember me? It's me, Ashley.
LEADMALE:She's so precious.
LEADFEMALE:You know, she reminds me of someone.
LEADFEMALE:That little girl who used to hang out around here.
SUPMALE:Pretty little thing.
SUPFEMALE:Black hair.
SUPMALE:Amanda.
OTHERMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:Or was it Anna?
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
SUPMALE:I'm pretty sure it was Appalonia.
LEADFEMALE:No, it was Ashley.
OTHERMALE:Well, hold up, was it Ashley?
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, honey, your father and I have always been here and we will always make time for you.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, why not? I mean, it will help your ratings.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't want to hear about it anymore, okay? Now, here come your two eldest siblings, Dopey and Greedy.
LEADMALE:No, Carlton, I will not plug your stupid school play on my weather spot today, tomorrow, or ever.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, for your information, Brigadoon is a classic musical comedy.
LEADFEMALE:No, man, for my money, classic musical 
LEADFEMALE:Milli Vanilli.
LEADMALE:Think about it, Hilary's special because she's the oldest.
SUPMALE:Carlton's the only boy.
SUPMALE:I was the baby, but who am I now? The whiner.
LEADMALE:Look, lighten up, Ashley.
SUPMALE:We all have our burdens to bear I mean, when the new Banks arrives, Dad's going to have to update his will which means there'll be another slice of the pie I won't be getting.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, what about my needs? What about me?
LEADMALE:What about
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:Good call.
OTHERMALE:I can't wait till the new baby's born.
SUPFEMALE:Then I can do all those special things that big sisters do.
LEADFEMALE:Like when you took me up to the attic window and told me I could fly? Or when you told me it was okay to roller skate down the steps.
LEADFEMALE:Judging by your lovely brothers and sisters you're going to need an insurance policy before you're potty trained.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'll have you guys know that I had a hand in raising you.
LEADMALE:I'll be a positive influence on the new baby.
LEADFEMALE:You just wait and see.
OTHERMALE:Hilary, baby, you're 30 years old.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you think it's about time you moved out on your own? That is so unfair.
SUPMALE:Mom's 50 years old and you haven't pushed her out the door.
SUPFEMALE:Why do I even bother? Cindy.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you forgetting something, baby sister?
LEADMALE:You're prettier than I'll ever be.
LEADFEMALE:Something else.
OTHERMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I'm feeling a little warm.
OTHERMALE:So, tell me about your day at school and move a little to the left.
SUPMALE:Well, Miss Randolph gave a pop quiz and l
OTHERFEMALE:Do you like my outfit?
LEADFEMALE:It's real pretty.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, my arm is starting to hurt.
LEADMALE:You poor baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Use the other arm.
SUPMALE:Maybe you should start lifting weights.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, go on with your story.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Myra Walker brought a hamster to class for show and tell
LEADFEMALE:Should I color my hair?
LEADFEMALE:No, it's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:It is, isn't it? Guess what? I have a little surprise for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Ta-da! Oh, goody, a shoeshine kit.
SUPMALE:I know I spoil you, but I just couldn't resist.
LEADFEMALE:Do you like my shoes? They're great.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, they'd be even better if they were shiny.
LEADMALE:Can I put the fan down first? This time.
SUPMALE:It is your birthday.
SUPMALE:But don't make a habit of it.
LEADFEMALE:A spit polish.
OTHERFEMALE:I meant on the shoes.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'd just be better off being invisible.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, what'd you say, Ash? Hold it there, home fry.
SUPMALE:Say a little something to spud.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, little bro, piece of 
SUPFEMALE:Don't lend Will a penny even if he begs, and he will.
LEADFEMALE:That's your brother Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll recognize him, he'll be the one at eye-level.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Dr.
OTHERMALE:Graham.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, this is Philip Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, fine, thank you, and how are you? Unusual? I see.
SUPMALE:Are you sure? Okay, I'll tell her right away.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Doctor.
SUPMALE:Vivian, you better sit down.
SUPMALE:I am sitting down.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, is there something wrong with the baby? No, that was the doctor.
SUPMALE:He just said that he thinks that we're having twins.
SUPMALE:Twins!
LEADMALE:Oh, my God!
LEADMALE:Two birds! Two birds!
LEADMALE:Come on, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Philip, honey.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:I got it, y'all.
SUPMALE:Look out.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? Come on, get him up, get him up.
SUPMALE:I remember something about twins and I have this incredible urge for a sausage.
LEADMALE:Philip, the doctor called, but there must be some mistake.
OTHERMALE:I couldn't possibly be having twins.
OTHERMALE:We'll have to split the inheritance four ways thanks to Forget-the-pill Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Is that all you think about? Pretty much.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know about y'all, I'm excited we having twins.
LEADMALE:I mean, now you can finally have the son you always wanted.
SUPMALE:Well, they already have me.
LEADMALE:Now, you can finally have the son you always wanted.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Doctor.
LEADMALE:You know, I figured there must be some mistake.
SUPMALE:I knew I couldn't possibly be having twins.
LEADFEMALE:Triplets? That's right, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:You'll be having three little ones so I suggest a lot more help.
LEADMALE:Preferably a young nanny amply endowed, with no inhibitions.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Might I get you anything?
OTHERFEMALE:An explanation.
LEADFEMALE:Mid-life crisis.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, why did you do it? I'm terribly sorry, madam.
LEADFEMALE:It was just the thought of one more person to clean up after was more than I could bear.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, this baby is all of our responsibility and I promise you we will not leave you with all the work.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, I told you, I wanted tomatoes in my omelet.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, I need some sliced cucumbers for my eyelids.
LEADMALE:G, the phone's ringing.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, you did my homework all wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Do it again.
SUPMALE:Master William, would you go change the baby? I'm trying to do 10 things at once! Sorry, no can do, G.
LEADFEMALE:I'm about to go shoot some hoops.
LEADMALE:Hey, do me a favor, spit shine my kicks for me, though.
LEADMALE:Thanks, babe.
LEADFEMALE:For heaven's sake, I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Hi, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey is so lazy.
LEADMALE:So, how's Jamaica? What'd you buy me? Great.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Okay, we'll see you soon.
LEADMALE:Bye.
SUPMALE:Well, what did your father say? For God's sake, when are they coming back? They'll be home in time for graduation.
SUPFEMALE:Thank heavens.
LEADMALE:The baby's.
LEADFEMALE:They figure you can handle things until then.
SUPMALE:Look, G, check it out, I'm a peace-Ioving brother but if you don't hurry up with my kicks, I'm gonna split your wig, man.
OTHERFEMALE:I want a new omelet.
SUPFEMALE:Homework.
SUPMALE:Cucumbers.
LEADMALE:Are you ignorant?
LEADFEMALE:I know you old.
LEADFEMALE:I want the omelet.
LEADFEMALE:When you old, you do stuff like this.
SUPMALE:What's up with my kicks? Calgon, take me away! Geoffrey, you're exaggerating.
LEADFEMALE:And you're lying through your bonded teeth.
LEADMALE:Well, that's Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:He pretends he doesn't like the family but deep down inside he really hates us.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
SUPFEMALE:I can tolerate Miss Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Man, I can't wait to start my own family.
OTHERMALE:Yo, I want to have a whole bunch of kids, like six and I'm going to have them one right after another.
LEADFEMALE:Will, we're talking about kids, not malt liquor.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you shut up before we send you back to that white family that dropped you off on the doorstep? I don't know if I want to have kids.
LEADMALE:Why not? I told you, I don't know.
LEADMALE:Hilary, honey, you're gonna change your mind.
LEADMALE:Having kids makes life worthwhile.
SUPMALE:Boy, I just can't wait.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I'm gonna have the perfect life with a perfect wife and perfect kids.
SUPMALE:It's perfect.
SUPMALE:Honey, I'm home.
SUPMALE:Hi, dear, did you have a tough day shooting the naked centerfolds? Yeah, babe, it was hell.
SUPFEMALE:Today we shot La Toya Jackson.
LEADFEMALE:And I had to keep turning the lights off 'cause she was melting.
SUPFEMALE:You poor baby.
LEADMALE:Why don't you glue yourself to the television set completely ignore me and play Nintendo until you're too tired to make love?
SUPFEMALE:You mean you don't mind?
LEADFEMALE:Have I ever? I'm perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Father.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Shaquille, Barkley, Jordan.
SUPMALE:Okay, forget about that.
LEADMALE:Check it out.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we go outside and shoot some hoops? What are hoops? I think he's referring to that sport where a spherical object is thrown into a round receptacle at opposite ends of a court.
SUPFEMALE:You watch your mouth, boy.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look, forget basketball.
OTHERFEMALE:Come here, come here, come here.
OTHERMALE:What do y'all say we sneak and get some candy before dinner? But that would spoil our appetite, and tonight we're having liver.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah! Shantay! Don't do that.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, dear.
SUPMALE:Did you want something? Yes, I'd like to know what pods these kids came from.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, Father, we came from a zygote.
LEADFEMALE:You see, in human reproduction Knock it off.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you won that Nobel Prize you think you're so doggone smart.
LEADMALE:Honey, you seem tense.
LEADMALE:I am tense.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody all perfect, baby, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't I send the children away and dress up in that French maid's uniform and give you a nice hot-oil massage? You, you, you! Why must everything always be about you? What about my needs? I'm sorry, honey.
LEADMALE:What do you want? I want a girl with extensions in her hair and bamboo earrings, at least two pair.
LEADFEMALE:I want kids that pick their noses sometimes and roll me when I'm drunk.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I want a dirty house.
SUPMALE:No, I want a dirty house.
LEADFEMALE:I want to argue in public, you know.
LEADMALE:I want you to have a headache sometime.
OTHERFEMALE:I want a regular life.
LEADFEMALE:I want a regular marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, you seem upset.
LEADFEMALE:Let's all give Daddy a great big hug.
OTHERFEMALE:No! No!
LEADMALE:Yeah! No! See, Will, I told you this baby thing was a lousy idea.
SUPFEMALE:Kids aren't all they're cracked up to be.
LEADMALE:And I know, I used to be one.
LEADMALE:Now, stop it all of you.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I cannot wait for this baby to get here.
LEADFEMALE:And that's not just because I'm retaining more water than the Hoover Dam.
LEADMALE:Ashley, honey we're not going to forget you when the baby comes.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll see, this will bring us all closer together.
SUPFEMALE:That's true, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, look at us now.
SUPFEMALE:Last time we sat around like this is when they reran Roots.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you guys are right.
OTHERMALE:We shouldn't be so selfish and think about ourselves all the time Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess I don't mind sharing my inheritance with the baby.
LEADFEMALE:We're not dead yet, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, it's a cruel world, big guy and you're not going to be in it forever.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Now, now, come on, let's not spoil the mood.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, let's go to dinner, huh?
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You, too, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Zip-a-dee, and might I add doo-dah! Maybe this will be a good idea.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to go grab my sweater.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I don't feel good.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, Hilary.
OTHERMALE:You're coming.
SUPMALE:Okay, but I'm not sitting between you and the dessert cart.
SUPMALE:Last time I almost lost an eye.
OTHERMALE:Okay, so where are we going? I say Snuffy's Catfish and Biscuits.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we just go eat out of a dumpster?
OTHERMALE:Come on, let's decide in the car.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:How about Haitian?
LEADFEMALE:Let's get some Haitian food.
LEADMALE:French.
SUPFEMALE:I'm ready.
LEADMALE:And, you know, I'm feeling really silly about that invisible stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Where'd everybody go? Hey, no! Hey, wait for me! Oh, no! And all those big nasty women you be bringing up in here, too.
SUPFEMALE:You think Uncle Phil don't know.
LEADMALE:He knows.
SUPMALE:He knows what you do, Geoffrey, okay? Now, I'm asking you to just do my sneaks.
LEADMALE:I want to go.
LEADFEMALE:I want to run some balls going to be some girls there, I gotta look cute.
LEADMALE:If I have dirty sneaks, other guys going to get the girls.
LEADMALE:All I'm asking is to have some clean sneaks when I go dunk on some people, all right? So, Geoffrey, straighten your act up.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, look, get some Calgon, take me away! 
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
SUPMALE:You know, Monique I've never said this to a girl before, but Oh, baby, you all that and a bag of chips! Oh, Will, am I? Hey, I'm lying, I'm dying, you know what I'm saying? Oh, Will.

LEADFEMALE:I wasn't being straight up with you.
OTHERMALE:But I will now.
SUPMALE:Monique, I care about you, baby.
OTHERMALE:I care about you so much.
LEADMALE:I couldn't trust myself to express my real feelings.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADMALE:Man, something smells good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, that's me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, y'all, check it out.
SUPFEMALE:I just tried on that new Michael Jackson cologne down at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:I don't smell anything.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's funny.
LEADMALE:It's a lot lighter than it was when I put it on.
LEADMALE:What are you doing wearing cologne anyway? You never wear cologne.
OTHERMALE:He wants to smell good for Monique.
LEADFEMALE:They have a big date tonight.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, I figured, you know, y'all gonna be out the house and my man, G, here has the night off.
LEADFEMALE:I figure Monique will come over, we'll go up to my room and six or seven hours later, we'll come back down again, you know what I'm saying? You don't know what I'm saying.
SUPMALE:Well, guys what do you think of my new dress? Doesn't make me look too big, does it? No? Hilary, what do you think, honey? Well, you know how I'm always borrowing your things? Well, you don't have to worry about this one.

LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:We might as well just stay home.
LEADMALE:Vivian.
SUPMALE:Philip, forget it.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to go out if you don't want to.
LEADFEMALE:What about what I want? I mean, what about my needs? Here you are, madam.
LEADMALE:I'm guessing they're not for me.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't put out in years.
LEADMALE:Oh, Philip, they're beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Let me.
LEADMALE:"I'm looking forward to dinner tonight "with the most beautiful woman in the world.

LEADMALE:My man, give it up top.
LEADMALE:"Mirror, mirror on the wall" Jean-Claude Van Damn, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:Miss Monique is here to see you.
SUPFEMALE:What's up, baby?
SUPFEMALE:Hi, honey.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, if you need me, I'll be dodging winos at the bus station.
SUPMALE:You know, my father would kill me if he knew I was out with a boy tonight.
LEADFEMALE:I told him I was going to church.
SUPMALE:The Lord is good.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come on over here, sit down, relax a little bit.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you are pretty slick, Will Smith.
LEADFEMALE:And I ain't even oiled up yet, you know? I think I should tell you, nothing turns me on more than a sense of humor.
LEADMALE:Really? Maybe you'd like to go upstairs and I could do my stand-up.
LEADFEMALE:Now, why waste time going upstairs? See, this way whenever you pass the couch, you'll think of me.
LEADMALE:Maybe I could get some memories of you in the kitchen and the Jacuzzi, too.
SUPMALE:Watch yourself, girl.
SUPFEMALE:Mama knows, child.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, what you doing? Will, I can't do this.
LEADMALE:I better go.
LEADMALE:Baby, what's the problem? You really turn me on.
SUPMALE:What's the problem? I don't know, Will.
SUPFEMALE:I really thought that I could handle all this but I can't, so we better stop.
LEADMALE:Baby, some things just ain't that easy to stop.
SUPFEMALE:I know, and it isn't that easy for me either but, Will, I want you.
LEADFEMALE:But I guess deep down inside I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
LEADFEMALE:I want to be married before I go all the way.
LEADMALE:You understand, don't you? Look, Monique, I'd love to talk, but there ain't no blood in my brain.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:It's only 7:00.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing up? Look here, I've been up for hours, man.
SUPFEMALE:I swam like 20 laps in the pool went down shot some hoops, jogged around the track a half dozen times.
SUPMALE:I waxed your car for you, too.
OTHERMALE:No nookie last night? Man, no nookie, no nothing, man.
SUPMALE:Look, see, I don't understand, man.
LEADFEMALE:She was here, everything was lovely and perfect then all of a sudden, she wasn't with it no more.
LEADFEMALE:I don't get it.
LEADMALE:Will, you just don't understand women.
LEADFEMALE:When it comes to matters of the heart, you can't rush things.
LEADMALE:Give a girl time, she'll come around.
SUPMALE:Really? How long do you usually give them? Let's see, a week from Friday, it will be 18 years.
SUPFEMALE:Morning, boys.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, son.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look, Uncle Phil, check it out.

LEADFEMALE:Never been off the lot as far as I can tell.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, driving is serious business.
LEADFEMALE:Well, these days you got to think about safety.
LEADMALE:You never want to go for a ride in a car without your seat belt.
SUPFEMALE:And use your brakes.
LEADMALE:Don't floor it because then you throw a rod, you flood your carburetor, you crack your block.
LEADMALE:You understand what I'm saying? No, man.
SUPFEMALE:No sex before marriage.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil, this is the '90s, man.
LEADMALE:Take a cold shower.
LEADMALE:I've been doing that since the '80s.
LEADMALE:It don't work no more.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, I know I'm talking to teenage hormones from hell but if you care about this young lady, you don't want to do anything to damage the relationship.
LEADMALE:And intimacy requires a real commitment.
OTHERFEMALE:Uncle Phil, I'm saying, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:We both mens here, you know? We got ugly needs.
LEADMALE:Will, you're a grown man.
LEADMALE:I can't watch you all the time.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just going to have to rely on you to do the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to unite this couple in holy matrimony.
LEADMALE:And by the powers invested into me and for the republic in which it stands I now pronounce you man and wife.
LEADFEMALE:Get busy.
LEADMALE:Will, I'm so happy.

LEADFEMALE:Any minute now that minister's going to realize his house ain't on fire.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this, Jazz, man, together we are invincible.
LEADMALE:Granted, my brother, we're good, but people can still see us.
SUPFEMALE:Baby, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Over the threshold.
LEADMALE:Oh, look at this, a chair a nice drawer.

LEADFEMALE:Now I want you to have it.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, a little box.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't even open it, silly.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.
SUPMALE:My great grandmother gave it to him on their wedding night.
SUPFEMALE:And Grandma gave it to Grampy and Mama gave it to Daddy and now I'm giving it to you.
LEADMALE:My parents are going to kill me when they find out what we've done, but But I don't care.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I'm proud that you're part of my family now because you're decent and honest.

LEADFEMALE:And I know you will love me and cherish me as long as we both shall live.
LEADMALE:Now, take me.

LEADFEMALE:So I got to go get you something.
SUPMALE:Sorry, Grampy.

LEADMALE:You know, my child, I've never known the pleasures of the flesh but I could be convinced to give up Excuse me, Father, could I rap to you for a second.
SUPFEMALE:Don't go away baby.
LEADMALE:Bartender, another Olde English for the lady.

LEADMALE:Look, I can't believe I let you talk me into this, man.
LEADMALE:I feel awful.
LEADFEMALE:Will, a naked, willing female is in your room.
SUPMALE:Stop me when I get to the awful part.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't have a right to treat her like this, man.
LEADFEMALE:She's a human being.
LEADMALE:Well, that's enough.
LEADMALE:Now, get a bottle of whiskey, liquor that girl up and take advantage of her.
LEADFEMALE:Be a man for God's sake.
LEADMALE:Jazz, I'm sorry, man, I can't.
SUPMALE:I've got to tell her the truth.
SUPMALE:Maybe you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps we've both been a little remiss in our treatment of women.
OTHERFEMALE:You think? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You inspire me, Prince.
LEADFEMALE:From now on I, too, will be completely honest in my dealings with the fair sex.
LEADMALE:My man.
LEADFEMALE:You know, my child, I've never known the pleasures of the flesh but I could be convinced to give up the priesthood for you.
OTHERMALE:Honey, where have you Monique, this is going to be hard enough as it is so please just let me do the talking.
SUPFEMALE:I know you respect honesty in a man, so I'm going to be honest.
LEADFEMALE:Monique, I just wanted to get you into bed so I tricked you.
SUPFEMALE:The whole ceremony was a fake and we're not really married.
LEADFEMALE:Monique, look, I'm sorry and I know what I did was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:And, Monique, I really care about you.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Monique the room is paid for and everything, so why don't, you know I was just hoping that maybe since So, could you just come get me, Uncle Phil? Your Mercedes? Oh, well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:See, actually, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I did borrow it.
SUPMALE:Well, but, you know, it's not here right now.
LEADMALE:Well, to be honest, my wife took it.
LEADMALE:All I could overhear were the words Mercedes, wife, and Monique and then Dad ran out of the house.
OTHERMALE:Well, I think it's obvious what happened.
SUPFEMALE:Will and Monique stole a Mercedes, and ran over somebody's wife.
LEADMALE:Carlton, that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Obviously, Will has been seeing a woman named Mercedes, Monique found out and I'm still working on the wife part.
LEADMALE:Well, I think Will married Monique just to get her into bed and when she found out, she got so mad she took off in Dad's Mercedes.
LEADMALE:Get real! I still can't believe that you could do something so despicable.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, marrying Monique just to get her in bed? Even I don't believe it.
SUPMALE:I can't imagine what kind of excuse you could come up with.
OTHERMALE:Do you have anything to say in your own defense? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:It's shameful, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:I mean, here you are busting your hump trying to impart values and teach basic human decency and I turn around and do some mess like this.
LEADFEMALE:I just don't get it, Will.
SUPFEMALE:I mean what is going on in that head of yours? I don't know, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I'm out of control.
LEADMALE:Please stop me before I disobey again.
LEADMALE:Don't you ever stop to think before you do these disgusting things? Of course, I do, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Do you think I like being the way I am? I'm a victim.
SUPMALE:I'm a victim of my imagination.
LEADMALE:Help me.
SUPFEMALE:Well all right, since you put it that way.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to punish you, Will.
SUPMALE:You know, that's radical, Uncle Phil, but it just might work.
LEADMALE:I'm not going to punish you today maybe not even tomorrow.
SUPMALE:You see, I need to think a long, long time about just what I'm going to do with you.
SUPMALE:I don't know, it might come to me in the middle of the night or maybe next week, or a few years from now.
LEADMALE:In the meantime, why don't you worry about it? Be afraid, Will.
LEADMALE:Be very afraid.
LEADMALE:I've got it.
SUPFEMALE:Will! I want to put something special on for you.
LEADMALE:And I promise it'll be worth the wait.
LEADMALE:Trust me.
OTHERMALE:I got that effect on women, you know.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Get up.
SUPMALE:Hurry, everybody, get up! Yo, what's the matter, Uncle Phil? Calm down, Will, calm down.
LEADMALE:It's Vivian, she's having the baby.
LEADMALE:That ain't what's scaring me.
LEADMALE:You ain't got no drawers on! Okay.
LEADMALE:Mother, are you all right? Of course you're not all right.
SUPMALE:You're having a baby.
OTHERFEMALE:I think I'm going to be sick.
OTHERMALE:Hilary, sweetie, come here.
SUPMALE:Having a baby is very spiritual.
LEADFEMALE:This is my last baby and I am never going to experience this miracle again.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes another contraction.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, that wasn't so bad.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, honey, don't be so dramatic.
SUPMALE:My hand.
LEADFEMALE:All right, it's cool.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's cool, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's cool.
LEADMALE:All right, check it out.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, you boil some water.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, you go get some blankets.
LEADMALE:Hilary, you circle the wagons.
LEADFEMALE:Will, honey, what are you talking about?
OTHERMALE:I wish to God I knew, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:Mom, I think what Will is referring to is Oh, my God, the pains are getting closer.
LEADMALE:Carlton, honey, get up off the floor.
LEADFEMALE:My hand! What is wrong with everybody? Philip, pull up your damn pants and let's go!
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Viv, I wanna go, too.
LEADMALE:Thank you, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:You know, I could really use somebody to hold my hand.
LEADMALE:Wonder if Mom had the baby yet.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:Birth is a miraculous thing, isn't it? To think I was once inside of a woman's body.
SUPFEMALE:I find that hard to believe.
LEADFEMALE:I think we all do, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mom.
SUPMALE:Mom! Mom, you're still pregnant.
LEADMALE:You think?
LEADMALE:I can't do this anymore.
SUPMALE:Look, me neither.
SUPMALE:I mean, getting woke up in the middle of the night by a naked man running around the house.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, I thought you were all asleep.
LEADFEMALE:Not you, G.
LEADMALE:Oh, never mind.
LEADMALE:Look, now, everybody calm down.
LEADMALE:False alarms happen all the time.
SUPMALE:But Uncle Phil was naked, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian, I wanna have this baby already.
OTHERFEMALE:You think I don't? I feel like I ate a Buick.
LEADMALE:Look like a Winnebago from here.
SUPMALE:Baby, is there anything more I can do for you? Will you look at her, Uncle Phil? Haven't you done enough? Leave her alone.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Good, I gotta lay down.
LEADFEMALE:Can I get you some tea, madam? That would be lovely, Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:Bring it to the laundry room.
LEADMALE:I'll be sitting on the dryer.
SUPFEMALE:Poor Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Poor Mom? Poor me.
SUPFEMALE:I saw Uncle Phil naked.
SUPFEMALE:And he was running.
LEADFEMALE:What can I get for you, madam? Geoffrey, I've got a proposition for you.
SUPFEMALE:Perhaps if we were both younger, and I didn't work for you.
LEADFEMALE:Not that kind of proposition, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:I will give you $50 to drive me over a set of railroad tracks.
OTHERMALE:Well, Doctor, the pains are coming closer together.
LEADMALE:Well, they start in the abdomen and they kind of radiate up and down in all directions.
OTHERFEMALE:Philip, what are you talking about? I'm not having any pains.
SUPMALE:Well, I am.
LEADMALE:Well, yes, Thursday afternoon will be fine.
LEADMALE:Yes, thank you.
LEADMALE:Yes, your Majesty? Geoffrey, from an objective point of view, who is having this baby? Him or me? It's rather difficult to tell just by looking.
LEADMALE:She's in here.
LEADMALE:Look, whatever you do, don't mention her chins.
LEADFEMALE:Or her ankles.
OTHERFEMALE:Or her feet.
LEADFEMALE:And whatever you do, never ever feed her after midnight.
LEADMALE:Poor Diva.
SUPFEMALE:Look at you.
LEADMALE:I'm sick of this.
LEADFEMALE:Look at you.
OTHERFEMALE:No more, y'all, come on.
LEADFEMALE:No more.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, why are you crying?
SUPFEMALE:I don't know, man.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, where's Helen? She couldn't come.
SUPFEMALE:She had to go to court with Lester.
OTHERMALE:Well, I thought the divorce was final months ago.
LEADMALE:That's right and everything was going so well until she saw Lester with another woman and that's when she snatched off the wig.
SUPMALE:She snatched off the woman's wig?
SUPMALE:No, Lester's.
OTHERFEMALE:What a novel idea, that little bell.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey, would you get us all something to eat, please? Golly, yes.
SUPFEMALE:It's great to be working in the big house.
LEADMALE:You've all met our butler, Chicken George? Don't you worry, Vivian, I am going to take good care of you.
OTHERFEMALE:Me, too.
LEADFEMALE:I'm so happy you guys are here.
SUPMALE:I was beginning to feel like nobody understood me.
LEADFEMALE:We're family.
LEADFEMALE:We love you.
LEADFEMALE:Stop with the damn bell! That's it, I'm never going back up there again.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry I ever went up there in the first place.
SUPFEMALE:I took her some honey for her tea.
SUPMALE:She tells me she does not want honey from California.
LEADMALE:She wants honey from New Mexico.
LEADMALE:Please.
SUPFEMALE:Diva needs to get her butt out of Bel-Air a little more often.
SUPMALE:If it get any bigger, it'll be in and out of Bel-Air at the same time.
LEADMALE:Oh, my goodness.
SUPMALE:All right, come on, y'all.
SUPFEMALE:This ain't easy on Aunt Viv.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, the baby is a week late.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, that bell is mine.
LEADMALE:Who's with me? All right, Hilary, you act like you're gonna hug her and then pin her arms down.
SUPMALE:I know the chokehold.
LEADMALE:Better.
SUPFEMALE:Hold it, now.
SUPFEMALE:Now, that's enough.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, you know this is harder on her than it is on us.
OTHERFEMALE:We're her family, we have to be here for her.
SUPFEMALE:You guys, why isn't anybody answering my bell? Could somebody please come upstairs and keep me company? You hate me, don't you? Okay, I know this has been hard to take and this baby does not look like he's coming any time too soon so why don't we just take a breather from one another? You know, just for a little while.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Geoffrey, have you seen my bell? What bell? I don't blame you, Geoffrey, I've been pretty unbearable.
LEADFEMALE:Do you think my family is ever gonna come back? I doubt it.
LEADMALE:Why don't you sit down and let me make you some tea? Geoffrey, you know, you always know what to do.
LEADMALE:Now, you relax.
LEADMALE:If anything happens, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks has Master William's beeper.
SUPMALE:And I'm sure your sisters will be back from the salon any minute.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, this is great.
LEADFEMALE:I really needed this.
LEADFEMALE:I know, and some electrolysis wouldn't hurt you, either.
SUPMALE:This could get ugly.
LEADMALE:We're family.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't you guys finished yet? Carlton, Aunt Vy is getting a makeover.
SUPFEMALE:It could take hours.
LEADMALE:Am I wearing a "kick me" sign? I don't see why women spend so much time in these places.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Forget college, I'm going to beauty school.
LEADFEMALE:Look, if I'm not back in 20 minutes, be really happy for me.
LEADMALE:Way to go, speedy.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up.
OTHERMALE:You know, Will, I could have driven myself here for my examination.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I think you're taking this sympathy pains thing just a wee bit too far.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be ridiculous, Will.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:I think my water broke.
OTHERMALE:Oh, my God, it's Vivian.
SUPFEMALE:She's having the baby.
LEADMALE:We gotta get to the hospital!
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil we in the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Good, 'cause I'm having a heart attack.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, I think you better let me take care of this.
SUPFEMALE:False alarm, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:It's for me, it's Carla.
LEADMALE:No, Uncle Phil, that's 40, 24, 36.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, sir, would you mind putting out that cigarette? It's a free country.
SUPMALE:That's right, it certainly is but it's against the law to smoke cigarettes in elevators.
LEADMALE:That's right, boy, this is a New Jack City.
LEADFEMALE:You the man.
LEADMALE:You the man.
OTHERMALE:You the big man that broke the elevator.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, I think we better beep Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks.
SUPMALE:Oh, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Keep calm.
SUPFEMALE:I think we'd better beep Mr.
SUPMALE:Banks.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, I just said that.
LEADMALE:Good, that's good.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we're on the same train of thought.
LEADMALE:How do you work this bloody thing? Thank God you're here.
LEADMALE:Oh, God! Uncle Phil, is that you? No, but you have really soft hands.
SUPMALE:Mommy! Ma! Relax, Will.
SUPMALE:I'm sure they'll have us out of here in no time.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil, that's Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, somebody get us out of here! I'm having a baby! Something must be wrong.
SUPMALE:I've beeped him twice and he still hasn't answered.
SUPMALE:My hand! I'd better try the beauty salon.
LEADFEMALE:So, while she's been stepping out on him he's been having an affair with her sister.
LEADFEMALE:But she works here so keep it quiet.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:What? Black Beauty, how can I help you? Yeah, right, it's always an emergency.
LEADMALE:I'll ask.
LEADFEMALE:Vy Smith, phone call.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, nobody's answering.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you just love these quiet girl talks? What? I know.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, it looks like you're gonna have to drive me to the hospital.
LEADMALE:Will I steer with my left foot? I hate men.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, here comes another one.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, give me your hand!
LEADMALE:No way.
LEADMALE:Ashley!
SUPMALE:Geoffrey!
SUPMALE:You keep away from me.
LEADFEMALE:This baby's coming.
SUPMALE:I gotta get to the hospital.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry, Mom, I'll get you there.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, you can't drive.
OTHERMALE:Grow up.
SUPFEMALE:I've been taking the car since I was 12.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:How much longer before somebody gets us out of here? My wife's having a baby.
SUPMALE:She ain't in there with you, is she?
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Good, 'cause I'm going on a break.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Just kidding, a little elevator humor there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, man.
LEADMALE:All right, I'll get you out of there as soon as I can.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey, I'm gonna be late for lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Great, you have a phone.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, and you don't.
LEADMALE:Will, we gotta get that phone.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, just ask him nice.
LEADFEMALE:No, after what I did to him, he's never going to let me use it.
SUPMALE:Well, you know, I'm coming straight out the hood, right? All right, where I come from when we want something, we step up on it and take it.
SUPFEMALE:Observe.
SUPMALE:Please, can I use your phone? Look, man, if you don't let me use your phone I'm gonna start singing Paula Abdul's greatest hits.
LEADMALE:I guess you want to use this phone real bad, huh? Yes, sir, I do.
LEADMALE:About as bad as I wanted that cigarette? Stop, ghetto time.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Will.
LEADMALE:Calm down.
LEADFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Calm down, now.
LEADMALE:Now, I trained as a lawyer for many years.
LEADMALE:I was trained in the art of negotiation, okay? Observe.
LEADMALE:Sir, give me that damn phone or I'm gonna rip your liver out and eat it raw.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, boy, and he about due for a snack.
LEADMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks.
OTHERFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Banks should be arriving at the hospital any minute.
LEADMALE:What? Who drove her?
LEADMALE:Who drove?
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You are trapped in an elevator, right? Yes, yes I'm trapped in an elevator.
SUPMALE:Now who drove her? Miss Ashley drove.
OTHERFEMALE:What? How could you let that happen? Are you insane? No, sir, I don't know how I could have let that happen.
SUPFEMALE:Call Mrs.
SUPMALE:Banks' sisters and tell them to meet her at the hospital.
OTHERMALE:Yes, sir, I'll call the salon right away.
SUPMALE:I am furious at you, Geoffrey! This is completely irresponsible of you.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir, I'm a very, very bad butler.
LEADFEMALE:In fact, I'm going to punish myself.
LEADMALE:No phone privileges for a week.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, Geoffrey, we're on our way.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian's having the baby.
SUPMALE:We've got to get out of here.
LEADMALE:Finally.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go get Carlton.
LEADMALE:Come on, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:I can't go into a hospital looking like this.
LEADMALE:The place is full of doctors.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, please don't tell me you're that superficial.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it may be superficial to you, but I'm young, I can still get a husband.
LEADFEMALE:Not without any teeth, you won't.
LEADFEMALE:That girl wanted me, Aunt Janice.
LEADMALE:Carlton, when a woman says, "Drop dead, troll" it usually means she's not interested.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come on.
LEADMALE:I'll call you.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, young lady but you are going to have to fill out these insurance forms like everyone else.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a kid.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know jack about insurance.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, but those are the rules.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God, here comes a big one.
LEADMALE:Nurse, could you hold my hand, please? Get this woman to a birthing room.
LEADMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Fagin, telephone, please.
SUPFEMALE:What happened to Hilary? Hilary Violet Banks, get your butt in here.
SUPFEMALE:My hand.
LEADMALE:I'm pretty sure Mom has been here.
SUPMALE:Look, this is an emergency.
LEADMALE:Do you have any mascara? Where is the woman that did this to you? Down the hall.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:She's down here.
LEADMALE:Vivian, we got here as soon as we could.
LEADFEMALE:You doing okay, baby? She's fine.
LEADMALE:I took care of things.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look, I appreciate that you're a close family but you all can't be in here.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go.
OTHERMALE:Me, too.
LEADMALE:This is what I usually look like.
OTHERMALE:Philip! Vivian.
SUPFEMALE:Wilma! Dad, over here.
LEADFEMALE:Where? Where is she?
OTHERFEMALE:That way.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian! Say hello to your new son.
LEADMALE:We should get a picture of this.
SUPMALE:Doc, would you do the honors? Sure.
SUPMALE:Look, he look like a little black yoda.
LEADFEMALE:He's adorable.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, little Nicholas Andrew Banks.
LEADMALE:Honey, I thought we agreed to call him Philip.
SUPMALE:That's a stupid name.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we name him after Daddy? Eli.
LEADMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:No, over my dead body.
LEADFEMALE:Let's name him Rufus.
LEADFEMALE:How about Brock? Shazam! Smile.
SUPMALE:Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston.
LEADMALE:Wilma!
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what up, C?
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADMALE:Bacon, avocado, and mayonnaise.
LEADMALE:Alex, the question is, "What are three things found in Uncle Phil's beard?" Yuck! Now, I lost my appetite.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Will.
LEADFEMALE:No, thank you, man.
LEADFEMALE:Master William, here are the maps you requested for your road trip.
SUPMALE:Thanks a lot, G.
SUPMALE:University of Nevada.
SUPMALE:Where at graduation they don't wear their tassels on their caps, if you know what I'm saying.
SUPFEMALE:You sure are lucky, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Spending the weekend at a college campus with 4,000 hot coeds and you get to bunk with Dad and Sara Lee.
LEADFEMALE:Crocket anyone? Jazz, you all right, man? You got a kind of a Clark Kent-Urkel thing jumping all over you.
SUPMALE:Actually, Will, he looks like me.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, that's what I was saying.
LEADFEMALE:I'm all ready for my trip to college.
LEADFEMALE:About time, too.
LEADMALE:I spent eight years in high school.
OTHERFEMALE:Jazz, Uncle Phil is going to be my chaperon and I don't think he wants you to come, buddy.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess I better return these stupid, funky clothes.
LEADMALE:Here, Carlton.
OTHERMALE:Hello, Master William.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what's up, G? Hey, check it out.
SUPFEMALE:I just finished making my schedule for the weekend.
LEADMALE:Figure if I work fast, I can see everything that this college has to offer.
SUPFEMALE:This is a list of sororities.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, sir, from alpha to gamma to bad Mama-Jamma.
LEADFEMALE:Silly me.
SUPFEMALE:When I went to university, I actually spent most of my time studying.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah, but look at you now, G.
OTHERFEMALE:Touch√©.
OTHERMALE:Did you by any chance see Murder, She Wrote last week?
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Watch your back.
LEADFEMALE:I just love having a little brother.
OTHERFEMALE:Me, too.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it cute the way he burps and drools and dribbles? Look, you guys, Carlton's 18 now.
LEADMALE:I don't think we should continue to encourage that type of behavior.
SUPMALE:We're talking about the new baby.
OTHERFEMALE:I never thought I'd actually enjoy taking care of one.
LEADFEMALE:It's for you, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:We better get to the club.
LEADFEMALE:All right, but I draw the line at breastfeeding.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, you ready to burn some rubber, make some tracks?
LEADMALE:Cough up a lung?
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I never felt better.
SUPFEMALE:Call an ambulance.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, man, you can't do this to me.
LEADFEMALE:I've been planning this trip for months.
LEADMALE:Hey, I tell you what.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you can make it.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a Dodger dog in it for you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Will, I don't think I can make it.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you can.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, you're just going to have to call the university and cancel, that's all.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil, why can't you trust me to go by myself? Because I'm smarter than the average bear.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, if you can't trust me I mean, there's got to be somebody you trust me to go with.
SUPFEMALE:Hey-ho, campers.
LEADMALE:Cut it out, Will.
SUPFEMALE:No hijinks while driving, young man.
SUPMALE:And fasten that seatbelt.
LEADMALE:It's the law.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, sir, Deputy Dawg.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, did you see that billboard? Come on, man, I'm starving.
OTHERMALE:Yes, hello, this is Tony Montana.
SUPFEMALE:I just saw your billboard on the highway.
SUPMALE:If you know what's good for you you'll make me a pepperoni pizza with anchovies on it.
OTHERMALE:Will, what do you think you're doing? What's it sound like I'm doing? Yeah, no, we're going north on l-80.
LEADFEMALE:Just look for the little, square-head guy who can just barely see over the steering wheel.
LEADMALE:Grow up, Will.
SUPMALE:Oh, Carlton, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:What's up girls? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Slow down.
SUPMALE:We could use a little roadside assistance, you know? Will, do you want me to turn this car around? I want you to speed up and catch up with them girls, man.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it, mister, you're on a time-out.
SUPMALE:Carlton, man, look.
OTHERMALE:You really need to loosen up, man.
OTHERMALE:Look, we're young and we're single.
LEADFEMALE:One of us is really handsome, the other one is you.
LEADMALE:But, come on, man, we're kids.
LEADMALE:It's our job to act like idiots.
OTHERFEMALE:That's your job, Will.
SUPMALE:I'm here representing Dad.
SUPMALE:My job is to ruin your fun.
LEADFEMALE:And you really love your work, don't you? What's wrong now? Look, man, I got to go bathroom.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, but the next bathroom break isn't scheduled for another 33 minutes.
LEADMALE:Well, that may be so, but whether you stop or not, I'm going in one minute.
SUPMALE:I don't get a good feeling about this place, Will.
LEADMALE:It's cool.
SUPMALE:I'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:We ain't black.
OTHERMALE:We just got back from Hawaii.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you have exactly 45 seconds to get back from the bathroom.
OTHERMALE:If you're not back, I'm leaving without you.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, it may take you 45 seconds but it takes a fully grown man a little while longer.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, you just wasted about 15 seconds, buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:You smell chicken?
LEADMALE:Forget about it, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Rule number 13, no poultry in the car.
LEADFEMALE:Are we there yet? Will, I think the engine's knocking.
LEADMALE:That's not where the engine is, stupid.
LEADFEMALE:Chicken, my brother? Jazz, how did you get in the trunk? It was easy.
SUPMALE:Oh, by the way, you need a new lock for your garage.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:College.
LEADFEMALE:Just like I imagined it.
OTHERMALE:Can I help you fellows? Yeah, I guess you might as well fill her up.
LEADMALE:And wash the windows.
LEADMALE:And look under the hood for you know, hood things.
LEADMALE:I don't know how people play these things.
LEADMALE:They're so boring.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, touch that handle, Granny, and you'll be pulling back a nub.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Homer.
LEADFEMALE:What's up with the Benz, man? Well, considering my limited experience with foreign cars this being the first one anyone's actually let me touch I think it went pretty well.
SUPFEMALE:Let me guess.
LEADMALE:You have a nuclear reactor in your backyard, don't you? What do we owe you? It's $300.
SUPMALE:There's $25 for the gas and $275 to call Germany to find out whether it took regular or unleaded.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, man, are you crazy? Well, I prefer the term "emotionally challenged.
SUPFEMALE:" And you still owe me $300.
LEADMALE:This guy's scaring me.
SUPMALE:Let's just pay him and get out of here.
SUPMALE:Do you prefer a check or credit card?
SUPFEMALE:Cash.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I've only got $40 cash.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to take a credit card.
LEADMALE:I mean, everyone takes credit cards.
LEADMALE:What kind of hick are you? The kind that don't take credit cards.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid I'm just going to have to keep the car.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:Homer, Homer, Homer.
OTHERMALE:Chill, check it out, man, look.
LEADMALE:I got $30.
OTHERMALE:Jazz, how much you got? Well, between this soda can and what I got in my wallet I'm good for a nickel.
OTHERMALE:Look, Homer, check it out.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get you your money, man.
LEADMALE:We just need a few minutes, all right? All right, it's no problem.
OTHERMALE:If you need me, I'll be at McDonald's watching the numbers change.
SUPFEMALE:Great, what are we going to do now? All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Look, let's just think, man.
SUPMALE:I'm sure we can come up with something if we just put our heads together.
LEADFEMALE:You got me.
SUPMALE:Yes, yes, yes! Come to Lola.
LEADFEMALE:Coming.
SUPFEMALE:All right, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:We going to get paid right here.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, give me your money.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I will not let you succumb to the base pleasures of gambling.
SUPMALE:Besides, we're underage.
LEADFEMALE:Can I get $40 in quarters? What do you say, Jazz? You turn my $30 into $300? Does James Brown use a hot comb? Jazz, that was our last chip, man.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, man.
SUPMALE:We got her right where we want her.
LEADMALE:Full house.
SUPFEMALE:Yes! Jazz, you lost all our money, man.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you said you knew how to play poker.
SUPMALE:Poker? You mean this isn't Go Fish? Tough luck, boys.
LEADMALE:Next victim? Hey, Lola, Lola, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.
SUPMALE:Looky here.
SUPFEMALE:I thought we had an understanding, you know? I mean, where I come from, when a man is nice to you you don't take all his money.
OTHERMALE:I mean, at least not while he's still awake.
SUPFEMALE:You're breaking my heart.
LEADFEMALE:Take a hike.
OTHERMALE:Lola, baby, come on.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you got to give me a chance to win my money back.
SUPMALE:I mean, 'cause if you don't, then I'm not going to be able to get my car.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, baby, have a heart.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just a poor black man trying to get to a panty raid.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look, I'll give you a job.
LEADFEMALE:You can work off your debts.
SUPMALE:Like Woodrow here.
LEADMALE:Yeah, my Studebaker broke down way back in '78.
LEADMALE:I've been working here all this time to pay it off.
OTHERMALE:Fifteen more years and you can just eat my dust.
OTHERFEMALE:Check it out.
SUPMALE:Look, Lola I don't want to die here an old white man, okay?
OTHERMALE:Will.
SUPMALE:What?
OTHERMALE:What?
SUPMALE:Come here.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:What? I think I got the answer to our problem right here in my sock.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, ain't nobody going to pay no money to see your sixth toe.
LEADMALE:Allow me, my brother.
LEADMALE:Yo, you've been holding out on me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Emergency bean-pot fund.
LEADMALE:Miss Lola, can I interest you in a game of chance? I'm listening.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I'm thinking of a number between one and ten.
LEADMALE:What is it?
LEADMALE:Four.
LEADMALE:Damn! You boys are pathetic.
LEADMALE:All right, I'm going to give you another shot, slim.
SUPFEMALE:Double or nothing, high card wins.
SUPFEMALE:All right, you're on.
LEADFEMALE:Black queen.
SUPMALE:Something I can relate to.
LEADFEMALE:Scaboom! A black king, and I don't mean Shaka Zulu.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Quarters.
SUPFEMALE:I have to have quarters, Will.
LEADMALE:Carlton, wait.
LEADMALE:See, I know I can beat it.
OTHERMALE:Carlton, listen
LEADMALE:First, it was bell, bell, cherry.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:And then cherry, lemon, lemon.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton
LEADFEMALE:But now, it's just cherry, cherry, bell.
LEADMALE:Cherry, cherry, bell.
LEADFEMALE:Cherry, cherry, bell! Every time a cherry, cherry, bell! Carlton! Get a grip on yourself, man.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I got the money for the car.
SUPFEMALE:We can leave.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, I can't.
SUPMALE:It's this damn thing.
LEADMALE:It just sits there taunting me.
LEADMALE:"What's wrong, Carlton?" "Lost your nerve, sissy boy?" Look, you got to help me, Will.
OTHERMALE:Make it stop.
LEADMALE:Carlton
LEADMALE:Okay, everybody, stand back.
LEADFEMALE:If I apply the Vulcan death grip, and press real hard right here I believe I can make him black out.
OTHERMALE:Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:Look, look, Carlton.
OTHERMALE:Listen, if you get in the car right now I promise we can sing the theme to West Side Story, okay? You can be Maria.
SUPMALE:I just want to play a few more times.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, did you hear what I said? Get your butt in that car right now.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you roll your eyes at me.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't leave now, Will.
SUPFEMALE:See, I figured the odds.
LEADMALE:If I just play 9,063 more times, I know I can beat it.
SUPMALE:Wait, Carlton, Carlton, listen.
LEADFEMALE:This is what gambling does to you, all right? It's a disease and it's evil.
LEADFEMALE:Stop it.
OTHERMALE:Right now.
LEADMALE:Buzz off, flattop.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Carlton, I ain't playing with you, man.
SUPFEMALE:Get your butt in that car right now!
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just get off my damn back? Okay, see, now it's on.
LEADMALE:All right, see, my mother don't talk to me like that.
SUPMALE:Come on, Jazz, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Jazz, we was right for leaving Carlton, right? Absolutely.
OTHERMALE:I mean, I've been looking forward to this weekend for a long time.
LEADMALE:And there ain't no way that I should miss out on it just cause he got the hots for the slots.
SUPFEMALE:You on a roll with a side of slaw.
OTHERMALE:I mean, what? He expect us to babysit him while he have a nervous breakdown? He's so selfish, man.
LEADMALE:That boy put the "E" in ignorant.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just saying, look, it ain't no way I'm letting Carlton ruin this weekend.
LEADMALE:Are we slowing down? I mean, nothing, but nothing, should stand between a man and his Phi Beta booty.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you're only doing 20 over the speed limit.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong? Look, didn't I say nothing's wrong, man? Except the fact that I got a tank full of gas, a campus full of honeys and all I keep thinking about is that little midget we left back there.
SUPFEMALE:Will, honestly, I don't think Ashley wanted to come along.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not talking about Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:I'm talking about Carlton, man.
SUPFEMALE:We left him back there without a friend in the world.
SUPMALE:Then he should feel right at home.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you know what, I think you're right, man.
LEADFEMALE:He don't need us and we don't need him.
SUPMALE:Could luck be a lady tonight? Tramp.
SUPFEMALE:Michael Jackson impression? Only a quarter.
LEADMALE:Here's 50 cents.
LEADFEMALE:Now, get out of my face.
LEADMALE:Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Evening, Bo.
LEADFEMALE:What can I get you? Shirley Temple.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, no giggling when you bring it to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll draw your portrait for a quarter.
OTHERMALE:Yeah! No! That's my money.
LEADMALE:I've been feeding this machine all night.
LEADFEMALE:Those quarters are mine.
OTHERMALE:Hey, man, what do you think you're doing? Get out of my way.
OTHERMALE:This is my money.
SUPMALE:I don't like your attitude.
LEADMALE:Can it, steroid breath.
LEADMALE:What did you say? See? He's doing great.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Bo, now knock it off.
LEADMALE:You might break something.
LEADMALE:Yeah, like my cousin.
SUPMALE:Yo, yo, chill.
LEADFEMALE:What's up? What's up, man? Bigfoot here stole my quarters.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, I'm just guessing here, but name calling? Bad idea.
SUPMALE:Hey, man, you tore my shirt.
LEADMALE:My mother bought me this shirt.
LEADMALE:And you know, I'm sure she's a really fine woman.
LEADMALE:But you got plenty of quarters.
LEADMALE:Why don't you go call your mom, have her send you a new shirt? I don't want a new shirt.
OTHERMALE:I want to clean the bar with his face.
SUPMALE:I'm saying, my brother, pick on somebody your own size.
LEADFEMALE:So what are you saying? Well, I mean, I wasn't suggesting me specifically.
LEADMALE:Bo, now this isn't a fair fight.
LEADMALE:Any bets? I'll take $5 on the big guy.
OTHERMALE:I'm saying, ain't nobody going to chump me.
LEADMALE:I ain't no punk.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Will, you don't have to Look, the time comes when a man has to take responsibility and fight his own battles.
LEADFEMALE:And I'll let you know when the time comes.
LEADFEMALE:Give me $10 on Bo.
SUPMALE:Prince, I know how you can take this dude.
LEADMALE:How good are you at faking seizures? Thanks for the vote of confidence, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Look, check it out.
LEADMALE:Just take the keys, start the engine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to bite him and jump in the car.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get busy.
OTHERMALE:I ain't got all night.
LEADFEMALE:Night/ine is on in two minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Can I stretch first, please? Pull a muscle or something out here.
LEADFEMALE:Anybody got any kryptonite in the house? Yeah, man, that's real funny.
LEADMALE:Really? So you're not going to hit me? You're not that funny.
SUPMALE:Well, no, but I can be, though.
LEADFEMALE:That's funny, though, right?
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, wait a minute, man.
LEADMALE:You wait one damn minute! We brothers, man.
LEADMALE:This is crazy.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we shouldn't be out here about to fight over a couple quarters.
OTHERMALE:I mean, in this cruel, hard world we got to stick together, man.
LEADMALE:Or we done, man.
LEADMALE:And if you want to be the brother that casts the first stone for the degradation of the entire race then you go right ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Did you get the feeling back in your head yet? You say something, Uncle Phil? Will, I just want to thank you for standing up for me.
LEADFEMALE:Man, look, it was nothing.
OTHERMALE:What is family for? Plus, we shouldn't have left you there in the first place, man.
LEADMALE:Anything could have happened.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry about that.
SUPFEMALE:Are you crazy? I had the time of my life.

SUPFEMALE:It was Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:No, it wasn't.
OTHERMALE:Well, now, you look.

LEADFEMALE:Keith.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right, son?
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I just want to say that it's a pleasure to finally meet one of Will's friends who has his head on straight.
OTHERMALE:You have been a very positive influence on him, son.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, sir.
LEADMALE:You know, I used to think so, too.
LEADMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil you know how you've been staying on me to make some decisions in my life? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hanging with Keith, I've decided what I want to do.
SUPFEMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:What is it? Well, I want to do something that makes a difference and makes people feel good.
LEADFEMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADMALE:I want to be a comedian.
OTHERFEMALE:Uncle Phil, I don't think "comedian" is a bad word.
SUPFEMALE:It is in this house.
SUPFEMALE:I just spent thousands of dollars sending you to a topnotch prep school.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should have just sent you to Camp Funnypants.
SUPMALE:Look, I bet Sinbad's parents supported him when he wanted to be a comedian.
LEADMALE:They named him Sinbad! He had two 
LEADFEMALE:Pirate or comic.
LEADMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, I know it's a shock but think of all the money you'll save by not sending me to college.
LEADFEMALE:There is no future in it, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil, can I help it that I'm this incredibly handsome incredibly talented guy with star quality? Uncle Phil, this thing is bigger than both of us.
LEADMALE:Sort of.
LEADMALE:I just want you to go to college, that's all.
OTHERMALE:Uncle Phil, and I will if this doesn't work.
OTHERMALE:But come on, you got to let me take my shots in life.
LEADMALE:You really want this badly, huh, son? Yes, I do.
OTHERMALE:And you actually think you can make a success of it? Yes, sir, I do.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, son, I guess there's only one thing for me to do.
LEADMALE:I'm going to nail your behind to the floor.
OTHERFEMALE:And if I catch you anywhere near a comedy club I'm going to break every funny bone in your body.
LEADFEMALE:Do I make myself perfectly clear? Perfectly.
OTHERMALE:Yo, Keith, man, what's up? What's up? That's what I've been trying to figure out.
LEADMALE:I thought you was my boy.
SUPMALE:I am.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you talking about?
SUPMALE:No, you're not.
SUPMALE:Not after what you pulled today at the audition.
OTHERFEMALE:What, are you mad at me that I got in the showcase? I mean, I just walked in and the lady gave it to me.
LEADMALE:I wasn't going for it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but I was.
OTHERFEMALE:And, you got it.
SUPFEMALE:So what's your beef? You don't get this, huh? I worked my butt off to get here, man.
LEADMALE:You know how many clubs I got booed out of? How many dives I had to play till I got a routine that finally worked for me? This ain't nothing but a joke to you.
LEADMALE:To me this is serious.
LEADMALE:So, what, you asking me to back out? No, I'm asking you to just show me some respect.
LEADFEMALE:Respect? I walk through the door and before my butt hit the chair the lady was giving me a job.
LEADMALE:You could learn something from me.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Well, I'll be off-stage taking notes tomorrow night, okay? You better bring a big pad.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be right back in five minutes with another hot comic.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess I'm up next, guys.
SUPMALE:Will, I took the liberty of writing out a few humorous barbs that you might find useful.
LEADFEMALE:Listen and laugh.
SUPFEMALE:Did you hear what the snail said when he rode on the back of the turtle? No, Carlton, what? Whee! Now, you should use that one for your big finish.
LEADMALE:No, maybe you should try this one.
OTHERMALE:Why did the turkey cross the road? I know I'm going to regret this, but why? Chicken's day off.
LEADFEMALE:Eat your heart out, Rodney Dangerfield.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm giving you gold here.
LEADFEMALE:See, Carlton, this is why people trip you in the halls.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't be proud, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Take it.
SUPFEMALE:You'll thank me later.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, I'm going to be hilarious.
SUPFEMALE:And when I get done with Keith the only job opportunity he's going to have is putting lids on Slurpees.
SUPMALE:Ladies and gentlemen please put your hands together for our next comedian from Philadelphia, PA give it up for Will Smith.
LEADFEMALE:What's up? What's up? Hey, how y'all doing out there? I'm a little tired, though, you know.
SUPMALE:I had a rough date last night.
SUPMALE:I went out with this girl who ain't have no arms.
LEADMALE:I took her to The Arsenio Ha// Show and she was like Well, that's cool, check it out, check it out, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:I should be mad at my cousin Carlton, though 'cause he set me up with her.
LEADMALE:But he ain't no prize hisself.
LEADFEMALE:He kind of look like a miniature Bryant Gumbel on a bad hair day.
LEADFEMALE:That's cool, check it out.
SUPFEMALE:But actually, my cousin Carlton, he don't have no problem buying clothes 'cause he's so short he just rips them off his G.
LEADFEMALE:I.
LEADFEMALE:Joe doll and wears 'em right out of the box.
SUPMALE:Will's really bombing up there.
LEADMALE:We should do something.
LEADMALE:Good idea.
SUPMALE:Boo! Get off the stage! We want our money back! Go back where you came from! What's up? What's up? Give me that before you hurt yourself.
OTHERMALE:Give Will Smith a big round of applause, ladies and gentlemen.
LEADMALE:Come on, y'all can do better than that.
LEADFEMALE:Give him a big round of applause.
LEADFEMALE:He'll be back, just not in here.
SUPMALE:I hope you're funnier than the last guy.
LEADFEMALE:I know I ain't getting heckled by no Jheri curl.
SUPMALE:And you got the nerve to be smoking, too? What you trying to do, kill us all? You know, I ain't going to bother no Jheri curl, 'cause I know that plastic bag makes so much noise at night, you're always irritable, huh? Crumple, crumple.
SUPFEMALE:"I cannot sleep!" Maybe I better speak to you in your language.
SUPFEMALE:Drip, drip, drip, drip.
LEADFEMALE:I'm new in L.
SUPFEMALE:A.
SUPMALE:I know there's things you can't do.
SUPMALE:You can't wear colors.
SUPFEMALE:Can't wear red.
LEADMALE:One gang will beat you up.
OTHERMALE:Can't wear blue.
OTHERFEMALE:Other gang will beat you up.
LEADMALE:Last night, I thought I was slick and put on plaid.
SUPMALE:Two golfers beat the hell out of me, ya'II.
LEADFEMALE:And everybody in L.
OTHERFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:Got a car phone.
LEADMALE:Don't matter how messed up the car.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometime the phone is the best thing on the car.
LEADMALE:You could tell the car raggedy.
LEADFEMALE:Every time the phone ring, the car just cut off.
OTHERMALE:"Girl, I'm glad you called.
LEADFEMALE:I need a jump.
SUPFEMALE:"Stop calling me or I'll never get home.
LEADMALE:" But I do this 'cause I want to be rich.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to be rich for the petty reasons that many of you do.
LEADFEMALE:I want to be rich so I can sleep late.
SUPFEMALE:'Cause when you're broke, you know you got to get up at 6:00 in the morning.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes you accidentally wake up at 3:00.
LEADMALE:"Am I late?" And black people set their alarm clock so they can hit that snooze button three times.
LEADFEMALE:"That was a drill.
LEADMALE:"I'm going to get it right next time.
LEADMALE:" And now they're saying there's a recession.
LEADFEMALE:Black folks, we didn't know there was a recession 'cause we been broke since the day before forever.
LEADFEMALE:Black folks found a way to get around being broke 'cause we'll put some stuff on layaway, won't we? And leave it for a long time.
LEADMALE:I know brothers still got bell-bottoms on layaway.
LEADFEMALE:You ever left stuff on layaway so long you don't even recognize it when you get back? "Damn, when did I get an eight-track tape player? "It's paid for now.
LEADFEMALE:" We do, man.
SUPFEMALE:And white folks, you see them in the unemployment office all the time.
SUPMALE:"$210 a week? How the hell am I going to live on $210 a week?" A brother be right behind him.
OTHERFEMALE:"$210 a week? For nothing? "Baby, get the kids.
SUPMALE:We done come up.
SUPFEMALE:" It's basic differences.
OTHERMALE:They just are.
LEADFEMALE:Like black parents are different than white parents.
LEADFEMALE:No better, no worse, just different.
LEADFEMALE:Saw a movie called Po/tergeist.
OTHERMALE:In the movie, a little white child trapped in a TV set.
LEADFEMALE:Start 
LEADMALE:"Oh, my God! Carol Anne's in the TV.
LEADMALE:What are we going to do?" You know, had that been a black mother, she'd have been proud.
SUPMALE:Pick up the phone, call her best friend, "Girl, turn to Channel 2.
SUPFEMALE:"My baby's on TV!" But white people, I love you guys.
OTHERMALE:Y'all get to do stuff we don't get to do.
LEADFEMALE:White people get to die and come back.
LEADFEMALE:Elvis been dead 15 years.
SUPMALE:People still seeing this brother.
LEADMALE:When a black man is gone, he's just gone.
LEADMALE:You don't see brothers talking about, "Man, I just saw Marvin Gaye! "He was at the mall!" "How do you know?" "I heard it through the grapevine.
SUPMALE:" You guys have been great.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:Give it up for Keith Campbell.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Morning, Will.
LEADMALE:I hear your friend Keith really blew them away last night at the standup club.
LEADMALE:Man, you should have seen how he handled them hecklers.
LEADMALE:I mean, how I heard somewhere that he handled the hecklers.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Will, I know you were there and I'm not going to kill you.
SUPFEMALE:Because I heard you already died a pretty horrible death.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, it was nasty, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I ain't as funny as I thought.
LEADMALE:I could have told you that.
LEADFEMALE:Ain't nothing you do funny to me.
SUPMALE:That's pretty cold, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, so is the world if you don't have an education and a good job.
SUPFEMALE:All right, I mean, I learned my lesson, Uncle Phil, but come on.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm funny.
LEADFEMALE:All right, here, check it out.
SUPMALE:Knock, knock.
SUPMALE:Who's there?
SUPMALE:Amy Fisher.
SUPFEMALE:Amy
OTHERFEMALE:Bang! Yo, yo, yo.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm on my way to the airport, but thank you guys for all your hospitality.
SUPFEMALE:I appreciate that.
SUPMALE:Everybody, except for you, Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:You don't think I'm funny, do you? For a tip I might.
SUPMALE:Okay, well, I got a tip for you.
LEADFEMALE:Tails is out.
LEADFEMALE:So are you.
LEADFEMALE:There's the door.
OTHERMALE:Now, that's funny.
LEADFEMALE:And everybody in L.
OTHERMALE:A.
LEADMALE:Is a vegetarian.
LEADMALE:What is this? "I don't eat red meat.
LEADMALE:I don't eat pork.
LEADMALE:" You know, it's cool to have a baked potato or a salad every once in a while but at a certain level of hungry, I need something dead on my plate something that used to have horns and hoofs.
LEADMALE:And they put parsley on black people's plates.
LEADFEMALE:I asked the waiter, "Man, why you putting parsley on my plate?" He said, "It's a decoration, it make your plate look pretty.
SUPMALE:" I'm like, "y o, man, wouldn't an extra shrimp make my plate look even better?" 
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:You like this, huh? You like this.
SUPFEMALE:Earthquake! is a dance, and apparently you know it.
SUPFEMALE:Exceptional buns, Geoffrey.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I think he's been doing the StairMaster.
LEADMALE:Where's your mother? Her breakfast is getting cold.
LEADFEMALE:She's not eating.
SUPFEMALE:Not until she can fit into her old wedding gown.
LEADMALE:That's ridiculous.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't expect me to fit into a pair of pants I wore 25 years ago.
OTHERMALE:Or 25 days ago, for that matter.
LEADFEMALE:You know, she has nothing to worry about.
LEADFEMALE:She's as beautiful as the day I married her.
LEADMALE:Which is why I'm going to renew our vows this Saturday.
OTHERMALE:That is so romantic.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish I could find a guy to lie to me like that.
LEADMALE:Sir, about Saturday's menu shall I prepare the same meal you had at your wedding? G, how's he supposed to remember what he had for dinner 25 years ago? Well, we started out with some chicken pot pie and some delicious coleslaw.
LEADFEMALE:And then there was some really, really great baked beans, with, what, molasses.
LEADMALE:And for dessert, we had a big huge chunk of chocolate devil's food cake.
SUPFEMALE:I'm guessing.
OTHERFEMALE:If only that power could be used for good.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I'll go upstairs to try to cheer up your mother.
LEADMALE:I'm so fat! On second thought, I'll call her from the car.
LEADFEMALE:Good, he's gone.
LEADFEMALE:Great, now we can finish working on their anniversary surprise.
LEADFEMALE:I hope they like this photo album.
LEADFEMALE:What's not to like? We got some great family pictures.
SUPFEMALE:Look, here's me at the beach.
SUPFEMALE:And here's me in my carriage.
SUPMALE:Look, and here's me at the park.
SUPFEMALE:I knew we should have gotten them those Ginsu knives.
LEADFEMALE:This stuff is so boring.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton's right.
SUPMALE:Nothing exciting ever happens to our family.
LEADMALE:Well, that's right, y'all, and that's why I came out here 'cause you people really need help.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton Banks is wearing an elegant, yet masculine cotton-silk combination designed by Will St.

SUPMALE:Five and six and seven, eight.
LEADMALE:Fingers open.

SUPFEMALE:but not at the dinner table.

SUPFEMALE:Problem solved.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, G, listen.
SUPMALE:Philip, I have $1,000 with your name on it.
SUPFEMALE:Do the family a favor, get Viv some cooking lessons.
LEADFEMALE:You! And, Miss Ashley, how does a Mercedes sound? Vroom, vroom? Very clever.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get you two.
LEADFEMALE:Vroom, vroom, vroom.
SUPMALE:Nice try.
SUPMALE:In case you hadn't figured it out I quit! For a long time, it gave me nightmares.
LEADFEMALE:Having to witness an injustice like that.
LEADMALE:It was a constant reminder of how unfair this world can be.
LEADFEMALE:I can still hear them taunting him.
LEADFEMALE:"Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids.
SUPMALE:" How come they just couldn't give him some cereal? Hi, /'m Phi/ip Banks, and /'m running for superior court judge.
LEADMALE:What the hell is that? That was our New y ear's Eve party.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Phil, you know, I just put in a couple of home movies you know, to show your human side.
SUPMALE:It gets better, check it out.
SUPMALE:And if you put me on the Bench, /'// take a rea/ bite out of crime.
OTHERFEMALE:Bite.
LEADFEMALE:Bite.
LEADMALE:Bite.
LEADFEMALE:Vote for Phi/ip Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Phi/ip Banks.
SUPMALE:Phi/ip Banks.
SUPMALE:Phi/ip Banks.
OTHERMALE:Where's the family room? Man, I'm going to kill Carlton.
LEADMALE:Kill him? I want to know the name of his decorator.
LEADMALE:No, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:What do you two think you're doing? I was trying to get up to my room.
LEADFEMALE:Tom, what was you doing?
LEADMALE:I was trying to be in the video.
LEADFEMALE:Look, a Donna Karan suit, right in the middle of the kitchen floor.
SUPFEMALE:What color? You gotta come out to see that.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry, Will, it won't work.
LEADFEMALE:Look, G, she won't listen to me, man.
SUPFEMALE:I give up.
SUPMALE:I think it's time you came out of the closet.
SUPMALE:Let me.
LEADFEMALE:Sonny what you do in the privacy of the bedroom is nobody's business but yours.
OTHERMALE:Just be true to yourself.
LEADFEMALE:He'll come around.
SUPFEMALE:Take it off! Put it on! Carlton Banks, you put your clothes on this minute.
LEADMALE:Mommy! Wow! Will, check out the talent.
LEADMALE:She's cool.

SUPFEMALE:Up with the dawn, the small band of brave souls prepare to pile into their Mercedes.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Adventure.
LEADMALE:Hey, I didn't know Mom was a ventriloquist.
OTHERMALE:Look at that funny-Iooking little dummy on her knee.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, that's Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, what's up?
LEADFEMALE:Where is it?
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey took it, I swear! Oh, my God, your Aunt Vivian's going to kill me.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, look, you're winning a lot of points with this second wedding thing.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure whatever it is, she can handle it.
LEADMALE:I lost my wedding ring.
SUPFEMALE:So, where shall we scatter the ashes? I cannot believe I wore that ring every day for 25 years and the day before my anniversary, I lose it.
LEADMALE:Okay, now, just think.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it will help if you remember what you were doing when you lost it.
SUPFEMALE:I was eating.
LEADFEMALE:That narrows it down.
SUPMALE:Hey, what up, J? Greetings, all.
LEADMALE:I guess my invitation to the wedding rerun was misplaced.
SUPFEMALE:But I thought I'd come by anyway.
SUPFEMALE:I'm guessing the bride won't be wearing white.
LEADMALE:Jazz, the ceremony isn't till tomorrow, man.
LEADFEMALE:Then I'll be spending the night.
SUPMALE:I hear the pool house has a delightful northern exposure.
LEADMALE:Hilary, woman, draw me a bath.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't draw you a cartoon.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Jazz, come here, man.
SUPMALE:Look, this is not the right time to mess with Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:He lost something really important.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey took it.
LEADMALE:I swear.
LEADFEMALE:Look, kids, you look down here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to look for the ring upstairs.
LEADFEMALE:Give it up, big guy, we've already looked everywhere.
LEADMALE:I'll give $100 to the first one who finds it.
SUPFEMALE:Now you're talking.
LEADMALE:My family.
SUPMALE:Can't live with 'em, can't turn your back on 'em.
LEADFEMALE:Ouch! Oh, my eye! Will, are you okay? Here's your question.
OTHERFEMALE:If your partner could name only one person as his best friend who would that special person be? Now, you have until the buzzer sounds to think about it.
SUPMALE:Time is up.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Carlton, let's hear your answer.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Bob, let's back it up for a moment and define this thing called friendship.
LEADFEMALE:You see, the ancient Mayans Carlton, your time is up.
LEADMALE:Okay, Tyriq, who is Jazz's best friend? I'm sorry, Bob, this is a bad time.
SUPMALE:Goodnight, Will.
LEADMALE:You're grounded.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right, all right.
LEADMALE:Everybody out, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Look, the next step is full-scale psychological warfare, right? You gotta act like you got this tic, right? Like the army did this experiment on you, right, that just went terribly wrong.
LEADMALE:You're like, back up! Back up! Mind your business, that's all.
LEADMALE:Mind your business.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Back up! Back up! Mind your business, that's all, just mind your business.
SUPMALE:I work all day trying to keep this house nice for you.
LEADMALE:I cook and clean and work my fingers to the bone.
LEADFEMALE:And this is the thanks I get? Well, I bust my hump at school all day and you just sit around here watching soap operas and eating bonbons.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, excuse me for having a little fun.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe it's because you never take me out anymore.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe I would if you fixed yourself up a little bit.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:We sound like an old married couple.
SUPFEMALE:So now I'm old.
LEADFEMALE:And I gave you the best years of my life.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I'm hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you have any more breath mints? No, you ate them all without offering me one.
SUPMALE:Can't have my toothpick, either.
LEADFEMALE:Did I ask you? Look, baby, why don't you just look in the freezer and see if there's something in there?
LEADFEMALE:Would you look?
OTHERMALE:Why don't you look? I thought you liked doing things for me.
LEADMALE:Yes, I did till you ate all my breath mints.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, I don't need you to do anything for me.
LEADMALE:Could you open this? Thought you ain't need me to do nothing for you.
LEADFEMALE:Just open it.
LEADFEMALE:What's the magic word?
LEADMALE:Now.
OTHERFEMALE:Guess again.
LEADMALE:Here, look, I can't open this thing.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you're supposed to be the big man.
LEADMALE:Look, you're the one who's hungry.
LEADMALE:Use your fingernails.
LEADMALE:Look.
SUPMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:Knock yourself out.
LEADMALE:Any luck with the ring, Dad? No, but don't worry about it, I figured it out.
SUPFEMALE:In the middle of the ceremony, I'll fake a heart attack.
LEADMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil, it didn't work on your wedding night and it ain't going to work now.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:Places.
LEADFEMALE:She looks so beautiful.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Not you.
LEADFEMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Look, she fit into her wedding dress.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody, duck.
OTHERMALE:I think she's about to blow.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz! We're gathered here today to renew the vows of holy matrimony which is commended
LEADMALE:I didn't know you were so sentimental.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not.
LEADFEMALE:It's just, always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian Banks, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? With all my heart.
SUPMALE:And do you, Philip Banks, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't.
OTHERMALE:What? I take her for much more than that.
LEADMALE:For my lover my life companion my very best friend.
LEADMALE:Oh, Philip.
OTHERMALE:May I have the ring, please?
LEADFEMALE:Here it is, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:I got one for you right here, buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, kids, but Look, Vivian, there's something I have to tell you.
LEADMALE:I lost my wedding ring.
OTHERMALE:You mean this one? You found it! Yeah, I took it to have it inscribed.
SUPFEMALE:See, look.
OTHERMALE:"To a hundred years more.
SUPMALE:Now you may kiss the bride.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Philip, did you get too close? I don't know, Vivian, is four feet too close? Nicky, honey, Daddy won't hurt you.
SUPMALE:What is about me that baby doesn't like? Is it my beard? Because if it is, I'll shave it off right now.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you dare.
LEADMALE:I love the way that beard feels.
LEADFEMALE:I'm surprised you remember.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, it hasn't been that long since we've made love, has it? Five months this Tuesday.
LEADMALE:Thin walls.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
OTHERMALE:I'll make it better, I promise.
SUPFEMALE:I hope so.
LEADFEMALE:There are priests laughing at me.
SUPMALE:I'll have my breakfast in the family room, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the wheelbarrow, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Morning, Master William.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil out there grumbling something about getting his tubes tied.
LEADFEMALE:He's bluffing.
LEADMALE:D.
LEADFEMALE:J.
SUPMALE:Nicky, Nicky, Nicky.
LEADFEMALE:Nick in the house.
LEADFEMALE:Get up.
SUPMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Viv, this kid is sprouting.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you know, another month, he'll be bigger than Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot believe that you and Carlton are moving into your own place.
LEADFEMALE:Seems like just yesterday when I was wiping the tears from his eyes.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, that was yesterday.
OTHERMALE:I told you that boy wasn't ready for Jurassic Park yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, honey, you and Carlton will look out for each other, won't you? Come on, absolutely, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:We got each other's back.
OTHERFEMALE:Great, great, great.
SUPFEMALE:You two just be careful.
LEADMALE:There are a lot of sick, demented perverts out there.
LEADFEMALE:Greetings, all.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:I brought a gift for baby Dicky.
LEADFEMALE:Nicky.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Whatever.
SUPFEMALE:I know it's five months late, but I wanted to find just the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:This is very sweet of you, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:You know, Ms.
LEADMALE:Banks, since you had that baby there's something different about you.
SUPMALE:Here, Will.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Jazz, very much.
SUPMALE:It's a baby pillow.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it beautiful.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Jazz, this thing says "Wendy Beth" on it.
LEADFEMALE:So? When you buy a wallet, doesn't it have someone else's picture in it first? Jazz, you stole this pillow.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the thought that counts.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Daddy.
LEADMALE:Bye, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, precious.
SUPMALE:Where you going?
LEADFEMALE:To the mall.
SUPMALE:See you.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, come here.
LEADFEMALE:Today is Saturday, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you and I do something together.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? Like, we could go to the mall.
LEADMALE:Daddy, all my friends are at the mall.
LEADMALE:Do you know what would happen if I showed up with my father? What? Be banned for life from The Gap? No, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:No, school don't start for another week.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, the apartment is great.
LEADMALE:Yes, it's in a safe neighborhood, Ma.
SUPMALE:Oh, check it out.
SUPMALE:The candy store actually sells candy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Mom, I know how proud you are of me that I'm going to college.
LEADMALE:Come on, don't do this, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:You know how this affects me.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah, it's like a dream come true for both of us.

LEADFEMALE:Did you say something, Dad? I don't want you to move out.
SUPMALE:Sorry, Dad, I have to go.
SUPMALE:No, you don't.
LEADMALE:Will says I do.
LEADFEMALE:He says it's time for me to leave the nest, become independent and have sex with girls.
LEADMALE:Safe sex, mind you, but lots of it.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Is this what you've been telling my boy?
SUPFEMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:That life is one big orgy.
SUPMALE:I never said
OTHERFEMALE:College is hard work, son.
SUPFEMALE:Followed by a family, which is even more hard work.
OTHERMALE:And a teenage daughter who doesn't wanna be seen with you in public.
LEADFEMALE:And a wife who won't let you anywhere near her.
LEADMALE:And a butler who may be the father of your child.
LEADFEMALE:And a gardener, a gardener

SUPMALE:I don't need either one of you.
LEADMALE:There is a silver lining in my dark cloud.
LEADMALE:Hilary.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Hilary Banks? You know, fate works in mysterious ways.
LEADFEMALE:For years, I've been trying to get her to move out of the house and now when I'm gonna be alone, she is my salvation.

LEADMALE:Way to go, sis.
SUPFEMALE:The guy's a prince.
LEADMALE:I can't believe she's gonna marry that jerk.
LEADFEMALE:Trevor's not a jerk.
SUPFEMALE:He's a superficial, self-centered, TelePrompTer-reading airhead.
LEADMALE:Sounds like a match to me.
OTHERFEMALE:My little girl is leaving me.
LEADMALE:Are you gonna be all right, big guy? Because I can stay here and help you through this rocky time.
OTHERMALE:I'll be fine.
LEADFEMALE:We out then.
OTHERMALE:Bye, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:You take care, man.
OTHERMALE:So if you take package D, you get basic cable three premiums and the Lust Channel.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, how you feel about the Lust Channel? I think it's 24 hours of shallow, pointless nudity.
SUPMALE:You heard the bird.
LEADMALE:We'll take it.
SUPMALE:You'll be hooked up tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Smith.
LEADFEMALE:You heard that right.
LEADMALE:Mr.

LEADFEMALE:Will, I've met the woman of my dreams.
LEADFEMALE:Word? I didn't know RuPaul lived in L.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:See, one of my duties as mascot is to walk around and greet people on campus.
OTHERMALE:So I'm doing my thing, and this wise guy starts messing with my plumage.
SUPFEMALE:Then she came to my rescue.
LEADFEMALE:Five feet, 11 inches of feminine firepower.
SUPFEMALE:I bet she could toss me around this room.
LEADFEMALE:Hope it works out for you, buddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Will, she's crazy about me.
SUPFEMALE:What makes you think that? Get this, she said she's looking forward to seeing me again.
SUPFEMALE:So?
LEADFEMALE:So no one's ever said that to me except my dentist.
SUPMALE:You were right.
LEADFEMALE:We're on our own three hours and my life's already taken a turn for the better.
SUPMALE:Well, let freedom ring.
OTHERMALE:Oh, that's the door.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Mr.
LEADMALE:Gorodetsky.
OTHERMALE:I thought I said no pets.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not really a peacock.
SUPMALE:And I'm not really a slumlord.
SUPMALE:Look, if you need to reach me, I'll be at my home number.
LEADMALE:You don't live here?
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I hope that's not a long-distance call you're making.
LEADFEMALE:Can I see that first dollar you ever had again?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADMALE:Put it away, you cheapskate.
OTHERMALE:I'm just calling Jazz, invite a couple of people over.
LEADFEMALE:Christen the new crib.
LEADFEMALE:Is there anyone in particular you'd like to invite? I don't keep friends.
LEADFEMALE:In time of war, they can be tortured and give up valuable secrets about you.
SUPFEMALE:I was talking about your Miss Lady Peacock.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you nuts? I'm not bringing her within a hundred yards of you.
LEADFEMALE:What? Carlton, I'm your cousin, man.
LEADMALE:The cousin who stole every woman I ever had.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, please, I stole one girl.
LEADFEMALE:My point exactly.
LEADFEMALE:All right, Carlton, I promise you I ain't gonna press up on her.
SUPMALE:As far as I'm concerned, she's just a man with breasts.
SUPFEMALE:She does have breasts, doesn't she? Well, all right.
LEADFEMALE:She runs the campus store.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go ask her.
LEADMALE:Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:What? Change your clothes.

LEADMALE:Who do we have here?
SUPMALE:We met at the mall.
OTHERMALE:What's your name, son? This.
SUPMALE:This is a stick with a snake wrapped around it.
LEADMALE:It's a symbol, like Prince.
LEADFEMALE:Prince who? See, that's exactly why fathers ain't allowed at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:What's this thing? It's a symbol for "get out of my house!" Daddy, I love him! Keep it up, sir and I'll be all you have left.
LEADFEMALE:You owe me.
SUPMALE:That's Boardwalk with a hotel.
LEADFEMALE:That's 2 grand.
SUPMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Community Chest.
LEADMALE:Yes, and what a lovely community it is.
SUPMALE:Coming through, coming through.
LEADMALE:Hey, Carl, where you been, man? I was watching the sun set over the Bank of America building.
LEADMALE:I think you know everybody Oh, except LaTanya.
LEADMALE:Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like to set the record straight before any other woman comes on to me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in a monogamous relationship.
LEADFEMALE:Really? How long?
LEADMALE:It's going on five hours.
LEADFEMALE:I'd appreciate it if you scavengers would refrain from eating this.
LEADFEMALE:I'm saving it for my Jacqueline.
LEADMALE:Jacqueline is his imaginary friend.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, my brother, can I help you? Yeah, man, this is where the party at? What party, man? The party we paid $25 apiece to go to.
OTHERMALE:Say, where's En Vogue? Hey, my brother, I think you got the wrong crib, man.
OTHERFEMALE:This is apartment 206, right? Well, yeah, man, but it ain't no party.
LEADMALE:Read it and weep, man.
LEADFEMALE:"It's the rump-baking, booty-shaking don't miss the mix in apartment 206.
LEADMALE:"
OTHERMALE:This is Jazz's handwriting.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know? All the letters is cut out of magazines.
OTHERMALE:Hey.

LEADMALE:Get out or I'll call security.
LEADMALE:Not old dude with the flashlight.
OTHERFEMALE:He carries a whistle too.
LEADMALE:All right, man, we don't want that kind of trouble.
SUPMALE:Guess we'll just go home and watch some TV.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a good idea, my brother.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Why don't you just take the pictures off the wall while you're at it.
LEADFEMALE:Good idea.
SUPFEMALE:Go nice with my new TV.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Carlton, if anybody else comes, you take care of it.
LEADMALE:I'm going to get our stuff back.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, y'all come back here with our stuff, man.
LEADFEMALE:This should cover your $25.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, the blender's still on warranty.
LEADFEMALE:It looks like your Jacqueline stood you up.
SUPFEMALE:It also looked like Loni and Burt had a good marriage.
LEADFEMALE:Dance with me, you freak.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe if you asked me nicely.
SUPFEMALE:This party's played out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, tell Will the crib is dope.
LEADMALE:Like that's all I got on my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Jacqueline.
SUPFEMALE:My bedtime's coming soon.
LEADFEMALE:Bird man? Jacqueline.
LEADMALE:Wait, I thought there were gonna be other people here.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, there were.
SUPFEMALE:They left.
LEADFEMALE:Some with lovely parting gifts.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I better leave too.
SUPMALE:No, don't.
LEADFEMALE:I went and got us some dinner from Chez Paul.
OTHERMALE:Filet mignon? Thanks, but I don't eat red meat.
SUPMALE:I'll give it up too.
LEADMALE:No need, bird man.
SUPMALE:Jacqueline, how about a dance before you go to christen the new crib.
LEADFEMALE:It'd be my first dance with a brother from Bel-Air.
SUPFEMALE:Better take the opportunity.
SUPMALE:There aren't too many of us.
OTHERMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:What is this anyway? Bobby Vinton, the Polish Prince.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I have some Manilow if you prefer.
LEADMALE:No, the Polish Prince will do just fine.
LEADFEMALE:It's my Jacqueline.
SUPMALE:It's the TV.
LEADMALE:Jackie? Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no! Go, peacock.
LEADMALE:Go, peacock.
LEADMALE:Go, peacock
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-
LEADMALE:I cannot believe that you and Carlton are moving into your own place.
LEADMALE:Sorry, Dad, I have to go.
OTHERMALE:No, you don't.
SUPFEMALE:Will says I do.
SUPFEMALE:He says it's time for me to leave the nest, become independent and have sex with girls.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, everybody, guess what.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm getting married.
LEADMALE:Will, I've met the woman of my dreams.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:Will.
SUPMALE:No, no, no!
SUPMALE:Baby!
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Girl, look at you.
LEADMALE:That's for not calling me after you left.
LEADMALE:Well, I called you twice times.
SUPMALE:The line was busy.
SUPMALE:Will, you have not changed, have you? Carlton, I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Since I didn't buy a program on the way in could you please tell me what the heck is going on? Man, look, that filly is from Philly.
OTHERMALE:We grew up together.
LEADFEMALE:What does that mean, "grew up together"? What do you want it to mean? That she hates you and you have no interest in her.
OTHERMALE:You saw her smack me, didn't you? I've seen a lot of girls smack you, Will.
SUPMALE:Then I see the same girls leaving your room.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, Jackie is not like most girls.
SUPMALE:She's special.
LEADMALE:Look at her.
LEADMALE:Yo, man, she used to be able to beat every brother on the playground in a foot race.
OTHERMALE:I'll fight you for her, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Any time, any place.
OTHERFEMALE:Relax.
LEADFEMALE:I got about as much chance with Jackie as you do.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Did Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Gorodetsky say anything about this building being a landmark or something? No, why? Because there's a tour bus pulling up on the front lawn.
LEADMALE:All right, y'all, everybody in rows one through 15 the party's in apartment 206.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz!
LEADFEMALE:Jazz! Everybody in rows 16 through 30.
SUPMALE:And have money in your hands.
LEADFEMALE:Senior citizens get a 10-percent discount.
LEADFEMALE:I do take tips.
LEADFEMALE:So, Will what's on tap for tomorrow? Daddy, how about a November wedding? Nothing extravagant, just 800 of our closest friends and relatives.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe we could book the Forum.
LEADMALE:I'm sure the Lakers will be on the road by then.
LEADMALE:Daddy, is something wrong? I'm sorry, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:It's This wedding took me by surprise.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't count on losing you and Carlton on the same day.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy.
LEADMALE:You're not losing me.
LEADMALE:You promise? Look, even though I'm getting married you'll always be my daddy.
LEADFEMALE:And you'll always be my little girl.
LEADMALE:I'm also Trevor's little girl.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:Technically, you're his woman, not his little girl.
SUPFEMALE:Then why does he make me wear those outfits? Excuse me.
LEADMALE:I'm scheduled for a heart attack.
LEADFEMALE:Go away.
LEADFEMALE:Ain't no party.
LEADMALE:Open up, it's Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Gorodetsky.
LEADFEMALE:Just a second, I'm undressed.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, Carlton, wake up.
LEADFEMALE:Look out, Jerry.
LEADFEMALE:Tom's gonna get you.
SUPMALE:Wake up, it's the landlord.
LEADFEMALE:We gotta put the furniture back.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Open up! Open up here! This used to be my lawn.
LEADMALE:And this used to be my banister.
OTHERFEMALE:And you used to be my tenants.
SUPFEMALE:But But I want you out of here by noon.
OTHERMALE:But
LEADFEMALE:Noon! He kicked your butt.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, that's our butts, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:We're in this together.
SUPMALE:Not anymore, Kemosabe.
OTHERMALE:I'm going back to my family, where I belong.
LEADMALE:No, you are not.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Why? Because that will be like admitting we can't make it on our own.
SUPMALE:I don't have to make it on my own.
LEADFEMALE:I'm rich.
SUPFEMALE:I never wanted to move out in the first place.
SUPMALE:Thanks to you, I've had my heart broken and I've been evicted.
LEADFEMALE:If this is your idea of independence, you can have it.
SUPFEMALE:I can be reached by fax.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton.
LEADMALE:Carlton, come on, man.
LEADFEMALE:I can't make rent without you.
SUPFEMALE:Then come home, Will.
LEADMALE:I'll send Geoffrey for my things.
SUPMALE:Then go ahead home, you damn baby.
LEADFEMALE:You'll probably be there till you're in your 30s anyway.
LEADMALE:Like all those other serial killers.
LEADFEMALE:This is Jazz's mother.
LEADMALE:He's not here.
LEADMALE:This is Publishers Clearinghouse.
LEADMALE:You've already won.
LEADMALE:It's about time.
LEADFEMALE:Open the door.
LEADMALE:Open the door.
LEADMALE:Will, I'm so glad it's you.
SUPMALE:I heard somebody disguised as me ran a party scam.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz, you got me kicked out my crib, man.
LEADFEMALE:Let me make it up to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Talk fast, you've only got a few minutes to live.
OTHERMALE:You can stay here with me.
LEADMALE:In this roach motel? It would only be temporary.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting thrown out on the 15th.
SUPMALE:Jazz give me the money.
LEADMALE:Money? What money? The 25 dollars a head you charged for my party.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, I was sneaking the bus back to the depot and I got held up.
LEADMALE:White dude.
LEADFEMALE:He took the bus too.
OTHERFEMALE:The money's gone, isn't it? Like the Jheri curl.
OTHERFEMALE:Here you go, roomie.
LEADFEMALE:Get comfy.
LEADMALE:You're gonna love it here.
LEADMALE:That's the Wilsons.
SUPMALE:You'll get to know them.
LEADFEMALE:I hate you, Jazz.
SUPMALE:I know you don't mean that.
LEADFEMALE:"Roommate wanted.
OTHERMALE:Minutes from school.
SUPMALE:Must love ice hockey, country-and-western music and Tom Cruise movies.
LEADFEMALE:" This is worse than Jazz's.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, wait, back up, girl.
LEADFEMALE:Wax on, wax off.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry I had to clock you last night, but you know me and my temper.
SUPFEMALE:No, you know, I understand.
SUPFEMALE:That torch you've been carrying for me all these years suddenly got a little too hot to handle.
SUPMALE:We were friends, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing more.
LEADMALE:We were more than friends that night after Alonzo Simmons' party.
OTHERMALE:I was young and immature then.
SUPFEMALE:I guess you still are, Lobe.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, don't you be calling me Lobe.
LEADFEMALE:I left that in Philly, where I thought I left you.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing out here anyway? Remember that jump shot you taught me? Well, I parlayed that into a basketball scholarship.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.
LEADFEMALE:You mean they're giving basketball scholarships to girls now? Lmagine my surprise.
LEADMALE:There I was just churning butter, and the phone rings.
SUPMALE:So you and Carlton tight? He is.
SUPMALE:We're cousins.
SUPFEMALE:I've been staying with his family.
LEADFEMALE:In Bel-Air?
OTHERMALE:Yeah, so?
LEADMALE:So beware of the bougieman.
LEADMALE:Hold on, hold on, hold on.
OTHERMALE:I kept in touch with everybody from the hood.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody but me.
LEADMALE:Why? Why? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Why would you keep in touch with everybody but me? I see this really bothers you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes.
LEADMALE:Damn you, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Just answer the question.
LEADMALE:Why didn't you call me? Because I missed you too much.
LEADFEMALE:How's that? I said it.
LEADMALE:Happy? That what you wanna hear? Hey, y'all, I missed the hell out of her.
LEADFEMALE:I missed her.
OTHERFEMALE:I missed her.
SUPFEMALE:I said it.
LEADFEMALE:That's what you wanted, right? Everybody know I missed her.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I gotta get up out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Gotta go find me an apartment and a job.
LEADFEMALE:Don't hit your head on the rim.
LEADFEMALE:One of my people quit this morning.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Are you suggesting maybe you and me working together side by side? No, it's too tempting.
LEADMALE:Before long, you'd be dragging me down into the storeroom and snatching all my gear off and everything.
OTHERMALE:Then I have to nail you with a sexual-harassment suit like the Anita Hill thing in reverse.
OTHERFEMALE:It's too much now.
LEADMALE:Look, maybe your transmission's stuck in junior high or something but mine's not.
SUPMALE:I busted my butt to get where I am, and I'm not about to lose focus just because you're back in my life.
LEADMALE:Now, I got me an agenda too.
SUPFEMALE:And it certainly does not include risking frostbite around you.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Well, good then.
OTHERFEMALE:When do I start? Next week, when school starts.
OTHERFEMALE:I will be here.
SUPMALE:Oh, Will.
SUPMALE:Wear something warm.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, man, I didn't really miss her.
LEADFEMALE:That was just game I was kicking there.
SUPMALE:You know, that's how you gotta do it.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, man.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, man.
LEADFEMALE:I was, man I was I was coming Coming back I was getting the rest of my stuff.
LEADMALE:Well, why don't you take some food too.
SUPMALE:We have plenty.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if it's gonna spoil.
LEADFEMALE:So things aren't going quite as smoothly as you planned, are they, son? Hey, hold up.
LEADMALE:Not only do I got me a new place to stay I got me a job on campus.
LEADFEMALE:Adversity is my oyster.
LEADFEMALE:This will go good with my adversity.
LEADMALE:Why don't you come home, Will? No, I can't, Uncle Phil, man.
LEADFEMALE:Don't get me wrong.
SUPFEMALE:I appreciate you taking me in and everything but I just feel like I'm at a point in my life where I need to have my own space.
LEADFEMALE:Trevor's about to propose.
SUPFEMALE:Where's Carlton? The last I saw him, he was in his room kissing the floor.
OTHERMALE:Will, I just want you to know that the door is always open for you.
SUPMALE:Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:There's no place like home.
SUPMALE:There's no place like home.
LEADMALE:There's no place like home.
OTHERMALE:Turn it up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, there's Trevor.
SUPFEMALE:It's a bungee jump.
SUPFEMALE:I asked him to propose in a special way, but I never expected a bungee jump.
SUPFEMALE:What's a bungee jump? Well, Hil, he's gonna propose while falling 300 feet on a giant rubber band.
OTHERMALE:Isn't it romantic? Please, whatever happened to getting down on one knee?
SUPMALE:Daddy, that's for old fogies.
OTHERMALE:I got down on one knee.
LEADMALE:Sustained.
LEADFEMALE:Look, there he goes.
SUPMALE:Hilary Banks Yes, Trevor? Will you marry me? I ain't no bungee expert or nothing but I don't think he's supposed to be slamming into the ground like that.
LEADFEMALE:"Please stand by"? Great.
LEADMALE:The president's about to interrupt my marriage proposal.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's just pray that Trevor's okay.
LEADMALE:Well, that was a lovely service.
LEADFEMALE:Trevor didn't look so bad for a dude that had a concrete face-lift.
SUPFEMALE:Fool.
LEADMALE:Like that was his real head.
LEADMALE:Could you two show a little compassion? Your sister's right behind you.
SUPMALE:I still can't understand.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetheart, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean technically.
LEADMALE:Am I a widow or what? This is all my fault.
SUPFEMALE:If I hadn't asked for a special proposal Trevor would be in my arms instead of in my purse.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Trevor.
SUPMALE:Hilary Trevor wasn't cremated.
LEADMALE:Then who's this? I'll see him to the door, Miss Hilary.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart Now is the time when you should make use of Reverend Boyd.
LEADFEMALE:Is he single? I mean you should be spiritual.
OTHERFEMALE:After all, Trevor's in heaven now.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:He's up there with my little dog Scruffy.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, and the bus he rode in under.
LEADFEMALE:Must everything be a joke to you? My sister's in a fragile condition.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to help her bounce back.
SUPFEMALE:Bounce.
OTHERMALE:Trevor bounced.
LEADMALE:Son, go get yourself a milk.
OTHERFEMALE:If you go right back to work as soon as possible maybe it would help you get your mind off things.
LEADFEMALE:Work? Every inch of that newsroom reminds me of Trevor.
LEADMALE:His desk, his makeup bib the shower in his office.
SUPFEMALE:I just need some time to find some sense of inner peace.
OTHERFEMALE:After all I am alone now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:You have me.
SUPFEMALE:Look, in a few days why don't I take you to the mall and we can go shopping.
SUPFEMALE:Go to the mall with my father? Sorry, I forgot.
LEADMALE:Must you do that? I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but Greetings, mourners.
LEADMALE:Hilary.
LEADMALE:If there's anything we can learn from this tragedy that's to live each day to the fullest.
LEADFEMALE:I know, Jazz.
SUPFEMALE:So with that in mind, what are you doing later? Oh, my
LEADFEMALE:It's all right.
LEADMALE:Guess y'all need to be alone right now.
LEADMALE:Yeah, so do you, Jazz.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll meet you back at the palace later.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:There's a hostage situation back at my building.
SUPMALE:SWAT team said it'd be a week before we could get back in.
LEADMALE:Jazz Forgive me for what I'm about to do.
LEADMALE:Hilary, can I have a word with you? Look, you know, I think you got the right idea not going back to, you know, work so soon.
LEADFEMALE:You're just lucky that there's nothing around here that reminds you of Trevor.
SUPFEMALE:Of course, there is the pool house.
SUPMALE:Never mind, forget about that, though.
SUPFEMALE:Then, on the other hand that is where you and he shared countless romantic evenings.
LEADMALE:I bet if those walls could talk they'd 
LEADFEMALE:"Trevor.
LEADFEMALE:" "Trevor.
SUPFEMALE:" Daddy, I can't stay in the pool house.
SUPMALE:I'm moving back in here.
SUPMALE:Of course, sweetheart, whatever will make you more comfortable.
LEADMALE:I don't know what I would do without my family.
LEADMALE:Mother.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:Can you get my things from the pool house? Of course.
LEADMALE:Come on, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Say, Uncle Phil, man.
LEADMALE:Hey, you know what, Will? I was thinking maybe I could turn that pool house into a law library.
SUPMALE:Stop playing, listen.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, well A greenhouse.
LEADFEMALE:That would work, huh? I said, stop playing, listen.
LEADMALE:I was wondering
LEADFEMALE:You can have the pool house.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:At the same rent Hilary was paying.
SUPFEMALE:And I have a few rules.
SUPFEMALE:That's cool, because I got demands.
LEADMALE:No loud music after 11.
OTHERMALE:Twelve.
LEADMALE:Eleven-thirty.
SUPMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:Check it out.
LEADMALE:It's important that I have my privacy.
SUPFEMALE:Say a honey be tiptoeing up my crib.
LEADFEMALE:That's my business, not yours.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:No skinny-dipping.
LEADFEMALE:You gotta promise me that same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Done.
LEADFEMALE:Well, son, I guess you got yourself a pool house.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
LEADMALE:How come he gets the pool house and I'm stuck upstairs with the grieving widow? Another thing.
SUPFEMALE:Keep this person off my property or I'll shoot him.
LEADMALE:It's my property.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna inherit it after the big guy takes his bungee jump.
SUPFEMALE:Right, big guy? Well, he does have a point.
SUPMALE:I'll tell you what, why don't you two work it out.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, tallest one gets the bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:I need the big closet for my peacock suit.
SUPFEMALE:So nice to have my family back.
LEADMALE:You shut up, man.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you shut up.
LEADMALE:And wipe that damn milk mustache off.
SUPFEMALE:Open the door.
LEADMALE:Open the door.

LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Carlton, but I already have my academic priorities in order.
LEADMALE:Will, I'm proud of you.
LEADMALE:You're finally taking your education seriously.
LEADFEMALE:Can I help you? Yes, I'll have what she's having.
LEADMALE:Will, do you realize we stopped and talked to every woman we saw? So? We were on the freeway.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you do these crazy things? The same reason Eddie Murphy tries to sing, I like the challenge.
LEADFEMALE:Right, well, if you like to be challenged so much how come you registered for classes like Cheese Appreciation? Carlton, the challenge is to make your life as easy as possible.
LEADFEMALE:That's why God made canned meat.
LEADMALE:Spam cakes, anyone?

OTHERMALE:I do too.

OTHERFEMALE:Western Philosophy.
SUPFEMALE:Western Philosophy? I'm impressed.

LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:I'm late for school, Daddy.

OTHERFEMALE:Is that Spam in your teeth? I didn't have no Spam.

OTHERFEMALE:I'm just kidding.
OTHERMALE:Take a seat right here, next to me and observe a class clown in his natural habitat.
SUPFEMALE:I get it.
SUPFEMALE:You're planning on giving the teacher a real hard time, is that it? Well, you know, that's plan B.
LEADFEMALE:Plan A was derailed by this refrigerator-shaped gentleman over here.
SUPMALE:I gotta tell you, I see a real problem with Plan B.
OTHERMALE:What's that? Watch.
LEADFEMALE:I am Professor Jeremy Mansfield and this is Western Philosophy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Will Smith.
LEADFEMALE:And this is an interesting coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:Philosophy is all about the perception of reality.
SUPMALE:And today's reality is this is a very difficult course.
SUPFEMALE:I am a very difficult man and I'm going to make your lives very difficult.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, Professor Mansfield, it's not too late to start sucking up, is it? There'll be a paper every week and a pop quiz whenever I feel like having some fun and I'm a fun-loving guy.
SUPMALE:You will have five 20-page papers, two midterms and a little cumulative final that I like to call the widow-maker.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Padre.
LEADFEMALE:Not so quick with the hair jokes now, my friend? Well, work may be hard but I think in the long run you'll find this course electrifying.
LEADMALE:No, no, no! No, wait.
SUPFEMALE:Call my mother! Somebody call the governor! I ain't even supposed to be in this class, man! I wanna live.
LEADMALE:So, what I'm trying to do here, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Hosek, is just drop this one class.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, according to your schedule, I would say it's Western Philosophy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, how'd you know that? It's the only course you're taking that actually requires staying awake.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, I have a really good reason for wanting to drop that class.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I'm sure my wife has a really good reason for cheating on me.
SUPFEMALE:Look, man, I got problems of my own.
LEADMALE:You think you got problems? My wife has seen more action than Chuck Norris.
OTHERFEMALE:I got an office that used to be the janitor's washroom.
OTHERMALE:Look, here! I got a toilet in my closet! And every day I just see my career going down it! Now, since registration is over, officially over, the only way to get out of a class is to get the instructor's written permission.
SUPMALE:Here.
SUPFEMALE:But I have to get Professor Mansfield's signature? He's not gonna sign this.
LEADFEMALE:There has to be another way.
LEADMALE:Well, actually, there There is.
SUPMALE:Well, come on, man, tell me, tell me.
SUPFEMALE:Make it one of your demands when you climb the bell tower with a rifle.
LEADMALE:Nurse, I'm ready to leave now.
LEADMALE:Hi, Dad, how was court today?
LEADFEMALE:It was great.
LEADMALE:I got to send El Diablo up the river.
OTHERMALE:El Diablo, the graffiti guy? He was the worst tagger the city's ever known.
LEADMALE:It'll be a while before they see his name around here again.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian.
SUPFEMALE:It's celery, I swear.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, what has gotten into you? The incarceration of a felon always gets my juices pumping.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go upstairs and celebrate.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, we have a problem.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, your credit cards, I mean
SUPMALE:After, after.
LEADMALE:See? So what? We're wealthy.
LEADFEMALE:You should have seen me deny that man's plea bargain.
LEADFEMALE:I was brilliant! You're going upstairs aren't you? Yes, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Is there a problem? I have no one in my life to go upstairs with anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Lower.
SUPMALE:Honey, how about a rain check? Rain check? Vivian, I am not a car wash.
OTHERMALE:I have needs.
LEADMALE:So does Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, I'm sorry, I will stay down here with you.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian! I'm ready for my wax job.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Smith.
SUPMALE:Such a quiet entrance.
LEADMALE:Where's your Your vim your verve your pedestrian wit? Why don't we stop wasting each other's time.
LEADMALE:Just give me an F and I'll be on my way.
LEADFEMALE:Will that make you happy? What would make me happy is never having been here in the first place.
LEADMALE:Just get me a drop slip.
SUPMALE:I'll make your wish a reality.
LEADFEMALE:You mean all I have to do to get out of this class is ask? I don't want anybody in here who doesn't wanna be here.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you gonna start a stampede.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I take back everything I said about you.
SUPMALE:And give me a couple of hours before you start your car.
LEADMALE:Psych.
SUPFEMALE:Or should I say "philosp.
OTHERMALE:" One of the central questions of philosophy is the revelation of truth.
LEADFEMALE:Enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:Do you wanna know the truth? Do you wanna know the truth? You can't handle the truth! Hey, that's Jack Nicholson.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith, if you wouldn't mind, please would you just beam yourself out of here.
LEADMALE:Captain Kirk, now that's fly.
OTHERMALE:No, this is The 
LEADFEMALE:"Help me! Help me!" Reality is, reality changes constantly.
LEADFEMALE:Yesterday's reality may not necessarily be today's.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody got a pencil? Okay, good.
LEADMALE:Hold it up.
OTHERFEMALE:Little higher.
LEADMALE:Little lower.
OTHERFEMALE:Perfect, right there.
LEADFEMALE:Now break it in half.
SUPFEMALE:What a sound.
LEADMALE:From now on, we're going to be using our minds.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, give me a pencil.
LEADMALE:Give me a pencil.
LEADFEMALE:This course isn't about taking notes.
LEADFEMALE:This course is about creative thinking.
LEADFEMALE:All right, look, conservatives, right? Liberals, rappers, skinheads nudists and televangelists, they all have something in common.
LEADFEMALE:You know what it is?
LEADMALE:They all been on Montel Williams.
OTHERMALE:See, I can't hear you because you no longer exist.
LEADFEMALE:But you could shove me, though, right? What they have in common is they all have a distinct version of the truth.
LEADFEMALE:But do we really care what the truth is? No, not really.
LEADMALE:We want to know, "How come nobody loves me?" "Where's my next paycheck coming from?" "How come I never get any breaks in life?" Okay, let's get on our feet.
OTHERFEMALE:We need a couple of volunteers to start with.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get some people who have a personal philosophy that is rooted in, oh, I don't know, sex.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that's what I thought.
SUPMALE:Nothing kinky, we just need two.
SUPMALE:Denise, right? Denise and Evan.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:All right, right up there.
LEADMALE:Now, don't be nervous.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna engage in a little dialectic.
LEADMALE:Dialectic is a ten-dollar word, and it means "debate.
SUPFEMALE:" Man! I should have never dropped out of his class.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:What you doing down here?
LEADMALE:I'm gonna tape Carlton's first pep rally.
SUPMALE:You have no idea how proud I am that he's the peacock.
SUPMALE:Nope, not even a clue.
LEADFEMALE:You got a little time, though.
SUPMALE:You want some grub?
LEADFEMALE:I've already eaten.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that a yes or a no? Man, this brings back memories.
LEADMALE:I bet you was in the top of your class at Princeton, huh? Actually, far from it.
SUPFEMALE:I was spinning my wheels until I met Matthew Langford.
SUPMALE:Who's that, one of your professors?
LEADFEMALE:Not "one.
SUPFEMALE:" The professor.
SUPFEMALE:Man changed my life.
LEADMALE:Turned a skinny kid from South Carolina into the man you see today.
LEADFEMALE:And you know how? He challenged me.
OTHERFEMALE:To what? A pie-eating contest? No, to having a fool as a nephew.
SUPFEMALE:I have this theory.
LEADFEMALE:I believe that everyone in college has one special teacher that That gives him an insight, a glimpse into who they really are.
OTHERFEMALE:You be on the lookout, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I think I found that dude already, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:Already? I was in my third year before I found Professor Langford.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you, this dude is hilarious.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he's fun, he's funny.
SUPMALE:He makes me think about stuff in a way that I never even looked at it before.
OTHERMALE:And I dropped his class.
LEADFEMALE:Let me guess.
LEADMALE:Western Philosophy, right? How does everybody know that? Because every time you're faced with a challenge, you run for cover.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, now, that is not true, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, this whole college thing is just kind of new to me.
SUPMALE:Bull! It's old territory.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're always going on about how you want to be out on your own and get respect.
SUPFEMALE:But you don't do anything to earn it.
SUPMALE:I think it's my break time.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell is wrong with you, anyway? I mean, you're smart, you're charming.
LEADFEMALE:You have gifts that other people would kill to have.
LEADMALE:And what do you do? You throw it away by taking the easy road.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, this is one class.
SUPMALE:No, this is not one class, Will.
LEADFEMALE:This is your life.
LEADMALE:It's not my life, it's not Carlton's life and you only get out of it what you put into it.
LEADMALE:And you are off to one lousy start.
OTHERMALE:But enough about me, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Let's talk about you.
LEADMALE:That's exactly what I'm talking about.
LEADFEMALE:Today's topic of conversation is this glass.
LEADMALE:Is it A, half-empty, or B, half-full? Professor, it's an emergency, you got to come out here.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter, Will? Can't move those oranges at the off-ramp?
SUPFEMALE:I'm serious.
LEADMALE:You got to come out here.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Hey, listen, just wax philosophically for a few moments by yourselves.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Will, what is it? What did you want me to see?
LEADMALE:Here it is, the new me.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to yesterday's you? Well, yesterday's reality isn't necessarily today's.
OTHERMALE:You're mastering the lingo.
LEADFEMALE:I'm impressed.
SUPMALE:That's good, because I wanna get back in your class.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Will some other student already took your spot.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
OTHERMALE:Hey, come on, Professor Mansfield, please.
LEADFEMALE:You gotta do me this favor, please.
LEADFEMALE:You come to me, my son, asking for a favor.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna let you back in this class.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Godfather.
SUPMALE:Unfortunately, the class registrar is closed, so you won't receive any credit.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait, whoa.
LEADMALE:Hold on.
OTHERMALE:Freshmen have to carry 12 credits.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I'd have to pick up another class, plus do all the work in this one.
OTHERMALE:You gotta love the irony, though, huh?
SUPFEMALE:You got a deal.
OTHERFEMALE:Good, take a seat.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:This looks like a lovely seat right Right over there.
LEADMALE:Okay, here's another oldie but a goodie.
LEADFEMALE:If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's around to hear it does it make a sound? Yes, yeah, yes, it does.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, it don't.
SUPMALE:Well, no, well, you know, yeah, it's a tree, it has to, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it Well How big is the tree? I mean, is it anywhere near a subway or anything like that? And how close is this forest to the ghetto? Okay, all right, how about if it landed on, like, a gopher or something like that? Hey, does the noise that the gopher makes count? Or what if it falls on Uncle Phil and he hurt the tree? Will, I took the liberty of jotting out a few courses you might be interested in.
LEADMALE:Carlton, thank you very much, but I already have my academic stuff in order.
SUPFEMALE:Good job, Will.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Girl, I hope these Greek clowns clean up after themselves.
LEADMALE:A bunch of messy, inconsiderate children.
LEADFEMALE:So which house are you joining? Girl, you know I ain't into that frat stuff.
LEADFEMALE:It's for a bunch of pocket-protector- wearing, no-social-life-having losers.
LEADMALE:Let the pledging begin.
LEADFEMALE:The defense rests, Your Honor.
OTHERFEMALE:Will thinks fraternities are a waste of time.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe for him.
LEADMALE:But the more activities I'm involved in, the better I look to Princeton.
LEADMALE:Besides, these guys know how to have fun.
LEADMALE:We're Delta Kappa Tau We'd like to take a bow We got the highest grades And we will tell you how We study, study, study For professional careers We drink a lot of Ovaltine But never any beers Revenge of the 
LEADMALE:Part Six.
LEADFEMALE:We're Lambda Kappa Nu Our blood is very blue Our money's old Our cards are gold And who the heck are you? Where's, like, a big gong when you need one, you know? Make way for the brothers of Phi Beta Gamma.
SUPMALE:Phi Beta Gamma step Black Gold Black Gold Man! Hey, I guess that's a tough choice, huh, Carlton? I'll say.
OTHERFEMALE:Can I hear yours again? Well, my gold card has a hologram of Lee lacocca on it.
LEADMALE:Excuse us, guys, it's time for a Negro moment.
LEADMALE:Carlton, wouldn't you rather join a fraternity where the guys look more like you? I was.
OTHERFEMALE:Didn't you notice we all had alligator shirts on?
LEADFEMALE:What up, Philly boy.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, man? I haven't seen you at the courts lately.
LEADMALE:I miss our one-on-one.
OTHERMALE:Now, Top Dog, you know when it's me against you it's one-on-none.
LEADMALE:I can't play on them tired courts y'all be playing on, man.
OTHERFEMALE:You haven't been there in a while.
SUPFEMALE:Me and my frat brothers, we raised money and we hooked them rims up proper.
LEADFEMALE:Are you in a fraternity? And here I thought you had a life.
LEADMALE:Hey, man, I run the fraternity.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, why don't you check us out.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, man, fraternities ain't my flavor.
SUPMALE:See you at the frat tonight.
LEADMALE:But, I will have a double scoop of that, though.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:We also do a lot of work for the community, brother.
SUPMALE:Like visit down at the senior center.
LEADMALE:And we also tutor kids down at the juvenile hall.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, terrific.
OTHERFEMALE:The Princeton people love to see community service on applications.
SUPFEMALE:I wouldn't really have to go to juvenile hall, would I? I hear those kids are real troublemakers.
SUPFEMALE:We need a little humor down at the frat house.
OTHERMALE:Well, it don't get no littler than cousin Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:What's up, Carlton? Top Dog.
OTHERFEMALE:Think about it, Philly boy.
SUPMALE:You too, cousin.
OTHERFEMALE:Us brothers need to stick together.
LEADMALE:Yes, sir.
OTHERMALE:Twenty-six years of marriage and I find you in bed with a cheerleader.
LEADMALE:Lazlo, how could you? Tune in tomorrow for another episode of All My Fault.
LEADMALE:What a sleaze.
SUPFEMALE:I hope Mary dumps Lazlo's sorry butt.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
OTHERMALE:You think she would've learned after he lied about neutering the cat.
LEADFEMALE:She really hasn't been the same since she had that sex change.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess you're right about that.
OTHERMALE:Listen to yourselves.
LEADMALE:You're caught up in the lives of make-believe characters.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you what, Mom, I'll watch the baby go to a museum and take Hilary with you.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, the only reason we get involved in this kind of stuff is that real life sometimes is kind of boring.
LEADMALE:What's that?
SUPMALE:Harley-Davidson '58 panhead.
LEADMALE:I used to date a biker.
SUPFEMALE:Was that a ride or was that a ride?
SUPFEMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:Maybe next time we can actually hit second gear.
LEADMALE:Philip, what's going on?
LEADMALE:What's it look like, Vivian? Looks like a bunch of middle-aged men with too much time on their hands.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, we're bikers.
LEADFEMALE:Dan, you're an accountant.
SUPMALE:Got a moment, Fonzie? Are you crazy? I told you I was gonna buy a bike someday, Vivian.
LEADMALE:Well, you also told me you were gonna lose 50 pounds.
LEADMALE:A motorbike is so dangerous.
LEADMALE:Well, just look at it this way.
LEADMALE:If I take a fall, I have a 50-pound cushion.
SUPFEMALE:Honey, you've also got an infant son who needs you in one piece.
SUPFEMALE:I don't see Dan's wife giving him any heat over this.
LEADMALE:From what Helen tells me she ain't giving him any heat anywhere else either.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you women discuss that? You'd be surprised what we talk about.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, be reasonable.
SUPFEMALE:Get off the midlife-crisis highway and come home.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, I can't wait to see your first hot flash.
OTHERMALE:Uncle Phil, what's up with the bike?
LEADFEMALE:Look, I bought me a motorcycle.
LEADMALE:It was my decision, and I don't wanna hear any more about it.
OTHERMALE:Must be that midlife crisis thing Aunt Viv warned us about.
SUPFEMALE:So how are things at school?
SUPMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, I'm thinking of pledging Phi Beta Gamma.
SUPMALE:Judge Morton is a Gamma.
OTHERFEMALE:He's also an alcoholic.
LEADMALE:No, that's Judge Martin.
OTHERMALE:So that's great, son.
LEADMALE:You're a real college man now, huh? Thanks, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I think I'm gonna go take my nap.
LEADMALE:So I take it you're not pledging? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Uncle Phil, I got a reputation more as a free spirit.
LEADMALE:Will, I wouldn't sell fraternity life short.
LEADFEMALE:You might get something out of it.
OTHERFEMALE:True.
SUPMALE:They do a lot of work in the community and stuff.
LEADFEMALE:The Gammas are a good group.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you give it a shot.
LEADMALE:The frat leader does need a little help with his jumping.
SUPMALE:Maybe I'll join as, like, a mercy thing.
SUPFEMALE:That's good.
SUPMALE:So hop on, I'll take you for a ride.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's cool.
SUPMALE:Oh, but you better not try none of that run-out-of-gas stuff, mister.
LEADMALE:Pledges on behalf of the brothers of Phi Beta Gamma, I welcome you.
SUPFEMALE:The journey begins.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah, just relax, Magellan.
SUPMALE:All right, at this time, I'd like to turn it over to big Brother Top Dog.
LEADFEMALE:Your pledge leader.
OTHERMALE:Attention! Busters.
LEADMALE:I hope you like your new uniforms.
OTHERMALE:You will be wearing them for a week.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Top Dog, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Pledge Banks, you only speak when you are spoken to.
LEADMALE:Well, are you speaking to me now, or are you? I'm sorry, but I think everyone here will agree that wearing the same thing for a week is not good hygiene.
LEADFEMALE:Right, fellas? So Pledge Banks likes to wash clothes.
LEADMALE:Actually, my butler handles the laundry.
SUPMALE:Your butler?
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:He's a whiz with my fine washables.
OTHERFEMALE:Pledge Banks, where are you from? Bel-Air.
SUPMALE:South central Bel-Air.
SUPFEMALE:I live right across the street from the Aaron Spelling mansion.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, the producer of Beverly Hills, 90210?
SUPFEMALE:I don't watch it.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't know what you're missing.
LEADFEMALE:Dylan's on the verge of getting back with Brenda.
OTHERMALE:You are on the verge of making a fool out of yourself.
SUPFEMALE:They really getting back together, though? It looks like to me our floor needs a little scrub.
SUPFEMALE:And a wax and a polish too, I might add.
LEADMALE:It's a good idea, Pledge Banks.
OTHERMALE:Pledges, get busy.
LEADFEMALE:And you can thank Pledge Banks for doubling your workload.
SUPMALE:No need to thank him all at once, fellas.
LEADMALE:What's up with that fool?
SUPMALE:Who? Who? Will's cousin.
OTHERFEMALE:Brother from another planet.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now, Dog, you hardly know the guy.
OTHERFEMALE:I know all I need to know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna teach him the true meaning of "hell week.
SUPFEMALE:" Hello, you poor excuses for pledges.
SUPMALE:Greetings, big Brother Top Dog of Phi Beta Gamma.
LEADMALE:Today, we're splitting up into groups.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm taking Philly boy and money bags to block.
LEADMALE:Hey, we're gonna play Hollywood Squares.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Do you realize that they're working you harder than everybody else? Nonsense.
LEADMALE:Everyone had to help re-tar the parking lot.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but the rest of us got to wear shoes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, it'll all be worth it when I hear them call me "brother.
LEADFEMALE:" I gotta tell you, Top Dog, I don't like what you're doing with Brother Banks.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't ask you.
LEADFEMALE:Lazlo, how could you? Mary, I couldn 't help myself.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Ashley, the museum closed? I had no idea how much Mary was suffering.
SUPFEMALE:Damn that Lazlo.
LEADMALE:Ashley, he doesn't know how much his actions are hurting the people who love him.
LEADFEMALE:That's because he's selfish and self-centered.
SUPFEMALE:I see your mother's been poisoning your minds.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, I've come to my senses.
SUPFEMALE:The bike is gone.
LEADMALE:It is?
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Motorcycles and black leather will never make me feel as young as the love of a good woman.
LEADFEMALE:With you by my side, I will never grow old.
SUPFEMALE:I love you.
LEADMALE:Oh, sir, the body shop called.
SUPFEMALE:They said your motorcycle is completely totaled.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:Oh, and the insurance company said you're covered for the damages to the ice-cream truck but have to pay for that box of Eskimo Pies you ate.
LEADFEMALE:I said, thank you, Geoffrey.
OTHERFEMALE:My pleasure, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Will there be anything else? My favorite soap is about to start.
LEADFEMALE:What would that be, One Life To Ruin? Sir.
LEADMALE:Well, if I told you the truth, you would have said, "I told you so.
LEADFEMALE:" Try me.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, well, I accidentally left the bike in gear and it ran into a Mr.
LEADMALE:Icy Pop truck.
LEADMALE:I knew that bike was dangerous.
LEADFEMALE:That's an "I told you so.
SUPMALE:"
LEADFEMALE:It is not.
OTHERFEMALE:Is too.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, what do you want from me? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:A kiss.
LEADFEMALE:I broke my bike.
LEADMALE:Here I go.
LEADMALE:Ladies, let the games begin.
LEADMALE:Don't you think it's cruel to have a party before they tell us whether we're in or not? Well, of course, it's cruel, Carlton, but look on the bright side next year we get to do it to somebody else.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you really think we made it? Hey, look, man, whether we did or not, you hung in there, and I'm proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:You're proud of me? You've never said that to me before in my life.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a hug.
LEADFEMALE:Don 't.
LEADFEMALE:You see, man, that is exactly why I'll never tell you nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Girl, if God made anything prettier than you I hope he kept it for himself.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Yo, Dog, did you see baby? Yo, she was fine.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's just the tip of the iceberg, my brother.
LEADMALE:Well then, mush, you huskies.
LEADMALE:Hey, Top Dog, do you think the DJ has any Rod Stewart or Neil Diamond? Gee, Carlton, I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:The last time we played them, the party just kind of got out of hand.
LEADFEMALE:I know what you mean.
SUPFEMALE:You should see what happens at their concerts.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, homey, I'm not supposed to say anything but you have nothing to worry about.
OTHERMALE:You're in.
LEADFEMALE:Your word, me and Carlton got in?
LEADMALE:Well, not exactly.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you're cool and all, but Carlton well, he's not exactly our type.
LEADFEMALE:Say, what do you mean, "not our type"? Well, Carlton is not like you and me.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm saying? No, I don't know what you're saying.
LEADMALE:Will, Carlton doesn't exactly exemplify what I think a Phi Beta Gamma is.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and what is that? Well, it's not Ralph Lauren shirts wingtip shoes and corporate America.
LEADFEMALE:We don't need a brother like him in this fraternity.
OTHERMALE:Man, he is exactly what you need in this fraternity.
SUPMALE:I mean, Carlton has been a straight-A student since preschool.
OTHERFEMALE:He gives you 150 percent every time.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Will, I realize he's your cousin and you have to defend him but this discussion is closed.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's go, I didn't get in.
LEADFEMALE:What? Why? Look, I don't know, man.
SUPMALE:Come on, just let's go.
SUPFEMALE:How dare you not take Will.
LEADMALE:He's full of potential.
LEADMALE:That's why we want him.
LEADMALE:It's you we don't want.
SUPFEMALE:Me? But I did everything.
LEADFEMALE:I cooked, I cleaned, I hand-washed your toilets.
LEADMALE:Everything your butler does for you.
OTHERMALE:I'm not accepting no prep school, Bel-Air bred sellout into my fraternity.
LEADFEMALE:Homey, you can stop all that
SUPFEMALE:Wait, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:I got this one.
LEADMALE:You think I'm a sellout, why? Because I live in a big house or I dress a certain way? Or maybe it's because I like Barry Manilow.
SUPMALE:He mean Barry White, y'all.
LEADFEMALE:Being black isn't what I'm trying to be, it's what I am.
LEADFEMALE:I'm running the same race and jumping the same hurdles you are so why are you tripping me up? You said we need to stick together but you don't even know what that means.
LEADFEMALE:If you ask me, you're the real sellout.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's right, boy.
LEADMALE:And in the words of my illustrious 
LEADFEMALE:"We will make like a tree and leave.
LEADFEMALE:" Hey, look, you don't speak for the rest of us, Dog.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna have you kicked out of here.
LEADMALE:"Make like a tree and leave"? I never say that.
LEADFEMALE:It's "make like a banana and split.
OTHERMALE:" I'll keep that in mind, all right? Lazlo, how could you? Oh, get over it, Mary.
LEADMALE:I'm leaving you for your brother.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you You've got to tape this for me tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Damn that Lazlo.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, are we looking at the newest Phi Beta Gammas? No.
SUPMALE:Apparently, I'm not enough of a brother to be a brother.
LEADFEMALE:What? Pledge leader said he didn't like sellouts.
LEADFEMALE:Well, who does? I mean, you wait and wait and when you finally get to the front of the line, everything's gone.
LEADMALE:You know, this This really irritates me.
LEADFEMALE:I have worked very hard to give my family a good life and suddenly somebody tells me there's a penalty for success.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry you had to go through this, son.
LEADFEMALE:When are we gonna stop doing this to each other? Well, I wouldn't have to go down to juvenile hall, would I? I mean, I hear those kids really are you know, bad and messed up.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:And I'm gonna go Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
SUPMALE:Ja Well, the Kamma
LEADFEMALE:The Jamma Gammas are

LEADFEMALE:Listen, Playboy is doing a pictorial on the prettiest weather girls from coast to coast.
LEADFEMALE:They're gonna call it "Warm Fronts.
LEADMALE:" And they want me to be in it.
OTHERFEMALE:Absolutely not.
SUPMALE:But don't you even wanna hear what I have to say about it? You heard our 
SUPMALE:No! Carlton, what do you care? Look, I will not be publicly embarrassed by a potential scandal.
LEADMALE:Now, now, don't get your Underoos in a knot, stumpy.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary knows what she's doing.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute, I haven't even decided
SUPMALE:Quiet, Hilary.
OTHERMALE:Work with me here, Hil.
LEADFEMALE:I can see it 
OTHERFEMALE:Long afternoons kicking back on a chaise longue watching full-body contact volleyball up at Hef's place.
LEADMALE:Hilary, as long as you live in my house, you will abide by my rules.
OTHERMALE:And that goes for the rest of you.
LEADFEMALE:That's telling us, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:I am 24 years old, and I can make my own decisions.
SUPFEMALE:Besides Mom said it was okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Vivian! So you said your daughter could pose in Playboy, huh? No.
LEADFEMALE:I said I didn't like the idea.
LEADFEMALE:But I also said she's a grown woman, and it's her choice.
LEADFEMALE:No daughter of mine is posing in that kind of magazine, period.
LEADMALE:You do this to me all the time, Daddy.
LEADMALE:I have a mind of my own, and opinions and you never let me express them and What were we talking about? Hil, I think you were in the process of storming out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks, Will.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you think? Look like you got hat-jacked by Woody Woodpecker.
LEADMALE:These are the new booster hats.
SUPFEMALE:Help me set up a display.
SUPFEMALE:Sure thing, boss lady.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Jackie, check it out.
LEADMALE:Hypothetical 
LEADFEMALE:Let's just say, like, a famous men's magazine asked you to pose with nothing but that stupid hat on.
LEADFEMALE:Would you do it? No way, I don't want just anybody looking at this body.
SUPFEMALE:Has it changed since we used to play doctor?
SUPMALE:Stop it.
LEADFEMALE:See, you have beautiful teeth.
LEADMALE:I didn't even know you had those.
LEADMALE:That was fun.
LEADFEMALE:Imagine how much more fun it would be if we was both naked.
LEADMALE:Will, you just hit on me from force of habit.
SUPMALE:Now, if you really wanna go out with me why not step to me like a man? Well, okay.
LEADMALE:So Jacqueline I wonder if you'd do me the honor of having dinner with me.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:"Okay"? "Okay" is all right if I offered you a government cheese sandwich but I'm offering you a buffet of love, child.
LEADFEMALE:Take it easy, homey.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you asked like a gentleman.
SUPFEMALE:If you keep acting like a gentleman maybe we can get somewhere.
LEADMALE:Somewhere that we could talk lying down?
SUPMALE:Will!
LEADFEMALE:All right, Jackie, I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:A temporary cool breakdown.
LEADMALE:I'm back now.
OTHERMALE:Look, so when is good for you? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I was thinking about this afternoon leading into the evening.
SUPFEMALE:You know what the evening leads I'm sorry, I need to have that treated.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call you later.
LEADMALE:Come without the stupid hat, okay? Hey, girl, I was Would you stop it! Stop, stop, stop.
LEADMALE:Hilary, are you really going to pose in that magazine?
LEADFEMALE:Why? Does it bother you?
LEADFEMALE:A little.
LEADMALE:I don't even like to get undressed in gym class.
OTHERFEMALE:Ashley, your body is going through some changes and they may seem awkward and embarrassing but I promise you, it's completely normal.
SUPMALE:And the discomfort, it's only temporary.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I look great naked.
LEADMALE:It's just that I don't like a bunch of gooney people staring at me.
LEADMALE:Oh, you get used to it.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I could kiss heaven goodbye because it got to be a sin to look this good.
OTHERFEMALE:You've been playing tennis with the gardener again, haven't you? You do look great, Will.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, Hil.
LEADFEMALE:You can help me out.
OTHERMALE:I need a name of a smoking place to take a date.
LEADMALE:Sure, we can talk about it on the way to the party.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go get dressed.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
SUPFEMALE:What party? Well, isn't that why you're all dressed up? Oh, did I forget to tell you? I think you're still in the process of forgetting.
SUPMALE:Playboy called.
OTHERFEMALE:They're having a pool party at the Mansion to kick off the weather girl shoot.
LEADMALE:And? And since you stood up for me with Daddy, I'm taking you.
SUPMALE:Yes, I knew that.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you, you're the best cousin a brother ever had.
LEADMALE:I'm going to the Playboy Mansion.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hello, Hef.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, pshaw.
LEADMALE:Don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad I could come.
LEADMALE:Oh, Miss December.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, baby, I was gonna call you.
OTHERFEMALE:Come here, girl.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, Master William if you can tear yourself away from your imaginary friend a Miss Jacqueline's on the phone.
SUPMALE:I forgot all about Jackie.
SUPMALE:Look, G.
SUPMALE:G, G If you had to decide between going on a date with a girl you care about and going to the Playboy Mansion, which would it be? The fact you're even asking, Master William tells me that you really care about the lady.
OTHERFEMALE:I guess I do.
LEADMALE:Admirable.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, might this young lady have a terminal illness? No, G, of course not.
SUPFEMALE:Then may I point out, she'll still be here tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, babe.
SUPMALE:I'm sick.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no, don't come over.
SUPMALE:Because, you know, I could be catchy.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know, I guess I'll just have to talk to you tomorrow? Bye.
SUPMALE:So when do we leave for the Mansion? Oh, they don't need you, G.
LEADFEMALE:They're fully staffed.
OTHERMALE:Either that is one tight dress or a really good paint job.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, Will.
OTHERMALE:I think I'm having second thoughts.
SUPMALE:What do you mean? I don't know if doing the layout is worth having Daddy hate me the rest of my life.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, it's only the rest of his life.
LEADMALE:After them pictures come out, how much longer could he have?
LEADMALE:Will.
SUPMALE:I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you wanted to do the pictures.
SUPMALE:Well, I do.
LEADMALE:I'm saying you can't just let your pop be pushing you around all the time.
SUPFEMALE:It would be so much easier if only he liked Playboy.
LEADFEMALE:Liked it? He's got issues in his bathroom from, like, 1964.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, just don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:Let's just go to the party.
LEADFEMALE:Freeze! Oh, look, the Little Republican Store must've opened.
SUPFEMALE:Good joke, Will.
SUPMALE:I'll laugh on the way to the party.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, teeny.
OTHERFEMALE:What makes you think you're going to the party? I'm not gonna miss out on Princeton because she wants to expose her weather balloons.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, I think Geoffrey's baking cookies.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, you don't.
SUPMALE:Look, I'm gonna talk to Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Hefner and put a stop to this.
LEADFEMALE:My voice will be heard.
OTHERMALE:You must take me with you.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:How can you let him come with us?
LEADFEMALE:Trust me, he ain't gonna say nothing.
SUPMALE:Well, how can you be so sure? Boy gets hot and bothered talking to average-looking girls.
LEADFEMALE:Five minutes at the Mansion, he's gonna go into meltdown.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it, girl.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, it's just like the magazine.
LEADFEMALE:Except the girls ain't got folds in the middle and jokes on their back.
LEADMALE:Carlton, stand up.
LEADFEMALE:You're drooling on my pumps.
OTHERMALE:Come on, you guys.
SUPFEMALE:My legs are like rubber.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and your head is like a peanut.
LEADFEMALE:What was it you wanted to say to Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Hefner? I want to tell him how much I love this place.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look at that swimming pool.
OTHERFEMALE:I have never seen so many people in one place I wanted to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to.
OTHERFEMALE:Breathing okay?
OTHERMALE:Hey, Hugh.
LEADMALE:Will, why are you shouting at me?
LEADMALE:I'm right next to you.
LEADMALE:Not you.
LEADMALE:Hugh.
LEADFEMALE:You who?
OTHERFEMALE:Stop yodeling.
LEADMALE:Hugh Hefner.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Hefner, what an honor.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Will Smith.
SUPMALE:This is my cousin Hilary.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, a pleasure.
LEADMALE:Hilary Banks.
SUPMALE:I'm glad you could make it.
LEADMALE:Let me show you around.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'd be honored.
LEADFEMALE:Relax, guys.
SUPMALE:Have some fun.
LEADFEMALE:There are suits in the bathhouse.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You def, Hef.
OTHERMALE:Why didn't you introduce me? Hey, Carlton, I gotta be honest, man, I forgot you was even here.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's just great.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Will, isn't that Jazz? Jazz, what are you doing here? I'm on the list.
SUPMALE:They think I'm the black dude from Mod Squad.
SUPFEMALE:Would you like to have dinner with the children?
SUPMALE:Yes, that would be nice, Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:Too bad.
LEADFEMALE:They're not here.
SUPFEMALE:Then why did you bring it up? If you don't care where your children are, sir, neither do I.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, where are they? Sir I could never betray their confidence.
LEADFEMALE:They're at the Playboy Mansion.
OTHERFEMALE:All except young Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:She's upstairs with her boyfriend.
LEADFEMALE:That one's on the house.
OTHERMALE:Vivian! Vivian! Vivian! Oh, Philip, did you call me?
LEADMALE:Do you know where your children are?
SUPFEMALE:Sure, they're at the Playboy Mansion.
LEADFEMALE:How come you knew that and I didn't?
LEADMALE:Because they talk to me.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't they talk to me? Because you don't listen.
LEADMALE:Every time So, baby, what you doing after the party? Actually, I'll be in surgery.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like everything on that body is in working order.
SUPMALE:I'll be performing surgery.
SUPMALE:I'm a doctor.
SUPFEMALE:Well, doc, you can check me out anytime, trust me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a cardiologist.
LEADMALE:You need a pediatrician.
SUPFEMALE:Miss March, right? I didn't recognize you with your clothes on.
SUPFEMALE:Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me.
LEADMALE:Turn-
LEADMALE:Fast cars, shrimp bouillabaisse and Indian quilts, right? Very impressive.
LEADMALE:Now, do you remember my turnoffs?
OTHERFEMALE:Do I? Hairy backs, smokers and abrasive young men who don't know when to shut up.
LEADMALE:Bingo.
SUPFEMALE:Girl, what would it take for a guy like me to get next to a girl like you? Five years and six figures.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:So tell me about yourself.
LEADMALE:I have a boyfriend who plays on the Lakers.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose your boyfriend's a tackle for the Rams, huh? No, the Raiders.
LEADFEMALE:Get away from me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, this place is great.
LEADMALE:I've got two numbers and if I play my cards right, I think she'll give me the other five.
SUPMALE:I don't think I'm gonna hang around to find out.
OTHERFEMALE:Being here helped me realize how important Jackie Bunny hop! really is to me.
LEADMALE:What do you think you're doing?
SUPFEMALE:The bunny hop.
LEADFEMALE:Where's your sister? She went to Malibu with the weather girls to have their pictures taken.
LEADFEMALE:Go wait in the car, Carlton.
SUPMALE:But I was just gonna go talk to Mr.
SUPMALE:Hefner about Hilary Go get in the car, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I really wanna thank you for taking the time to talk to me, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Hefner.
LEADMALE:Well, it's always a pleasure to talk to a long-time subscriber.
SUPFEMALE:My man, Linc.
SUPMALE:I wanna cut right to the chase here.
LEADMALE:It's about my daughter posing for your magazine.
LEADMALE:I mean, well, how would you feel if your daughter got involved in this whole world? Well, my daughter is involved in this whole world.
OTHERMALE:She runs the Playboy empire.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, let's try this a different way.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, look, suppose somebody that you really care about like your wife, suppose she decided to pose? Well, my wife was the Playmate of the Year and I'm very proud of her.
SUPMALE:Don't you understand there are some parents who are not comfortable with their daughters being stared at by millions of people? I understand where you're coming from.
SUPMALE:Look, over the years, I've had to deal with a lot of parents.
LEADFEMALE:You seem like a good man.
LEADFEMALE:Let me put it this 
OTHERFEMALE:I promise you, the pictures will be tasteful.
SUPMALE:Tasteful? Oh, yeah, right.
LEADFEMALE:I know what that means.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you very much.
OTHERFEMALE:Jackie, you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I thought you were sick.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, I was.
OTHERMALE:You know, I At least I thought I was.
SUPFEMALE:You know, actually, I had an allergic reaction to bunnies.
LEADFEMALE:So, say, what's up with that date? I'm sorry, Will, but when you cancelled on me, I made plans to go to the movies.
LEADFEMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:Just call up your little girlfriend and break them.
OTHERFEMALE:My " little girlfriend" is 6'2" with a mustache.
LEADMALE:What kind of monster are you? A man is laying up in his deathbed, and you go stepping out on him? Hey, Will, you and me ain't all that.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, okay.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing after the movies? I think that's between me and Tony.
LEADMALE:Okay, how about tomorrow night?
LEADMALE:I got basketball practice.
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
SUPMALE:I'll watch.
OTHERMALE:You can't.
OTHERMALE:You're working.
LEADFEMALE:Mike called in sick.
LEADFEMALE:He probably has what you thought you did.
SUPMALE:Okay, next Saturday night?
LEADFEMALE:Bachelorette party.
SUPMALE:Christmas?
OTHERFEMALE:I'm going home to Philly.
OTHERFEMALE:Then New Year's Eve? Groundhog Day? Cinco de Mayo? Rosh Hashanah?
LEADFEMALE:I hope you're proud of yourself, Vivian.
LEADMALE:What did I do? Your daughter is somewhere in Malibu stark naked.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about? She went and posed for Playboy, and you encouraged her.
SUPMALE:I did no such thing.
OTHERFEMALE:When I talked to her, she hadn't made up her mind yet.
LEADFEMALE:If anything pushed her over the edge it was your usual "do it my way or else" charm.
LEADMALE:Don't you start with me, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:No matter what I did, she's my daughter.
SUPMALE:A daughter should obey her father.
LEADMALE:In that case, I never would've married you.
LEADMALE:Oh, that was different.
SUPFEMALE:Your father had it in for me.
LEADMALE:What was it again he didn't like about me? It was a tie between your family and your temper.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll tell you one thing, I sure don't miss him.
LEADMALE:God rest his soul.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetheart, listen.
LEADMALE:Sometimes a parent has to step back and let their child find their own way.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be upstairs.
SUPMALE:Hi, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, I'm sorry, but I've already had my pictures taken.
SUPFEMALE:It's all right.
LEADFEMALE:It was my choice and It's all right? You're not a child anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You're a beautiful woman.
SUPMALE:Beautiful enough for Playboy to ask and woman enough to make your own decisions.
LEADFEMALE:No matter what, I still love you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:So when are your pictures coming out? They said in about two months.
LEADFEMALE:You understand, of course, I can't be here when they do.
SUPFEMALE:Enter.
SUPMALE:It's arrived, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna see them.
SUPMALE:It came in the mail today with a personal letter from Mr.
SUPMALE:Hefner.
OTHERMALE:He thinks you should take a look at it.
SUPMALE:So do I.
SUPMALE:You can forget it, because I'm Oh, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that.
SUPFEMALE:She's covered up.
LEADMALE:Hallelujah, she's covered up! But this little girl is not.
LEADFEMALE:Hallelujah.
LEADMALE:Hallelujah.
LEADMALE:You heard our 
OTHERMALE:No! Carlton, what do you care? Look, I will not be publicly embarrassed by a problem of delivering my damn lines.
OTHERFEMALE:It won't happen, damn it.
LEADFEMALE:It ain't gonna happen.
LEADMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna allow it.
SUPMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:It's over! It's all right, man!
LEADFEMALE:Let it go, man.
LEADFEMALE:It's over.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:All right
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Why don't you put that down and come sit next to me.
SUPMALE:How's that? Everything cool?
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:It worked?
OTHERMALE:Perfect, Branford, you hear? Good, I'm glad you liked it.
LEADMALE:So, Will, I'm off like a dirty shirt.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, peace with two fingers, man.
SUPMALE:Give J some for me, all right? There's definitely some perks to working for NBC.
LEADMALE:I call the couch in the living room.
LEADMALE:No, I'm sleeping on the couch.
OTHERMALE:You can sleep under the couch, you squidgit.
SUPMALE:I'm sleeping on the couch.
LEADMALE:I said no.
OTHERMALE:Oh, grow up, you two.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you're staying here.
LEADFEMALE:Imagine calling an exterminator for a few harmless little crickets.
LEADMALE:Supposed to be soothing, for God's sake.
LEADFEMALE:No, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I don't think you understand, man.
OTHERMALE:Now, these ain't them cute little Jiminy-wish-upon-a-star-type crickets.
SUPMALE:No, man.
LEADFEMALE:These are big, mean, nasty, bug-eyed take-over-the-human-race kind of crickets, man.
LEADFEMALE:You can borrow my makeup, but the key is subtlety.
OTHERFEMALE:You want your date to think you stepped out of Vogue not a clown car.
SUPFEMALE:Date?
SUPMALE:Tonight's the night.
LEADFEMALE:I go to the movies with Randy, remember? Randy? Randy who? Why wasn't I consulted about this? Stop pretending you don't know anything about it.
SUPMALE:You already gave permission.
LEADFEMALE:You cannot keep little girls from growing up.
LEADMALE:I can and I will.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, come here.
LEADFEMALE:Look, now, seeing as how this is your first real date I think there's a couple things you need to know.
LEADMALE:Listen, if you're gonna hold the popcorn, make sure you hold it up in plain sight so when he go reaching for the bucket he don't miss, talking about, "Oops.
LEADFEMALE:" And stop at a gas station and make sure that tank is full.
LEADMALE:And if he tells you to pull his finger, don't do it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks, but it's just a little innocent date.
LEADMALE:Nothing's gonna happen.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're right, nothing's gonna happen because I want you back here at 9:30.
OTHERFEMALE:But the movie doesn't even end until 10.
SUPMALE:Well, you can catch the end of it when it comes out on video.
SUPMALE:Daddy!
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, be back by 10:30.
SUPFEMALE:Ten-thirty on the dot.
LEADFEMALE:Not 10:31, and that's in this house.
SUPFEMALE:Not on the porch, not parked out on the driveway.
SUPMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me I'm gonna go check the video camera over the front door.
SUPMALE:Daddy never gave Hilary a curfew.
OTHERMALE:He was probably hoping she wouldn't come back.
LEADMALE:Oh, that reminds me, I'm gonna be out late tonight.
LEADMALE:I'm shooting a commercial for Casual Cup coffee.
LEADMALE:That's great.
LEADFEMALE:How'd you get it? Well, the director said I reminded him of the coffee.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, he probably thought you was hot, creamy and rich.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, that's it.
LEADMALE:I was pretty sure I wasn't mountain-grown.
OTHERFEMALE:Check please.
LEADMALE:I guess that leaves the house to just you and me.
LEADMALE:I can write my paper while you study for your midterm.
SUPFEMALE:It'll be nice and quiet.
LEADMALE:We can clear tables like the study center.
SUPMALE:You know what? I know how we can make it even more like the study center.
LEADMALE:I won't be here.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go run some ball.
OTHERMALE:I'll get with you all later.
SUPMALE:But you told me you haven't studied yet.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't.
OTHERMALE:Look, Carlton, I'm the king of cram.
SUPMALE:All I need is three solid hours and I'm cool.
LEADFEMALE:Will, let me tell you a little story about the grasshopper and the ant.
LEADFEMALE:I really don't feel like hearing about you and your little friends, okay? Just listen.
LEADFEMALE:See, the grasshopper goofed off while the ant worked hard storing up food for the winter.
SUPFEMALE:When the winter came, the ant had food but the grasshopper starved to death.
SUPMALE:You know what the moral of the story is? Yup, even if we were insects, I'd be bigger than you.
LEADMALE:All hail, the king of cram is about to take his throne.
LEADMALE:This is really sad, Will.
LEADMALE:It's 10:30 and you're just now cracking open that book.
LEADMALE:No, that's not true.
SUPFEMALE:I cracked it earlier when I had to write down this honey's phone number right next to the periodical table.
LEADFEMALE:Do you wanna hear a little chemistry rhyme? No, not really.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:Little Timmy took a drink But he will drink no more For what he thought was H2O Was H2SO4 That's how I remember the equation for sulphuric acid.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, look.
LEADFEMALE:I got one.
SUPMALE:I got one.
LEADFEMALE:Little Carlton was a boy Whose body was short and stumpy He never shut his mouth So I kicked his little rumpy Are you quite finished? Yup, all ready.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Carlton, that's really annoying.
SUPMALE:Oh, sorry, nervous habit.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, nervous habit.
SUPMALE:Fool.
OTHERMALE:I am so sorry, Geoffrey, but if I put him down he cries even harder.
LEADFEMALE:So would you mind making up more formula? Mind? Madame, you woke me from a most marvelous dream.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't had one this good since I was strip searched at Dulles Airport.
LEADFEMALE:"Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry.
LEADFEMALE:" Honey, could you hold Nicky just a second? Wait, Aunt Viv, come on, l He stopped.
LEADMALE:Well, these fingers can work magic.
LEADMALE:Ain't that what the honeys tell me, huh?
SUPMALE:Okay, it's 10:37.
SUPFEMALE:I'm calling the police.
SUPMALE:Philip.
SUPMALE:Police don't need your hysterical calls cluttering up their phone lines.
LEADMALE:They've got to catch real criminals.
SUPMALE:Like the murderous muggers and thugs that hang around movie theaters after hours.
SUPFEMALE:She's at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:She's not at the Pussycat Theater.
LEADMALE:I've never seen a mugger at the Pussycat Theater.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Can I speak to Ashley? She's not home from her date.
LEADMALE:She was supposed
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, I got it.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, sweetheart, where are you? I'm upstairs in my room.
LEADFEMALE:I got home 20 minutes ago.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, hang up, I wanna talk to Connie about my date.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell you about it tomorrow.
LEADMALE:All right, sweetheart, good night.
LEADFEMALE:This is too easy.
LEADMALE:Are you ready? Don't I feel like an idiot? Ashley got home 20 minutes ago.
LEADMALE:She's upstairs talking on the phone.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? That's a load off my mind.
LEADMALE:I think I'll go to bed.
LEADMALE:Good night, Geoffrey.
SUPMALE:Good night, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Idiot.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you can hold on to Nicky till he falls asleep.
LEADMALE:Well, no, Aunt Viv, listen, I can't.
LEADMALE:I have to study.
LEADFEMALE:You can't study if the baby is crying.
SUPMALE:It shouldn't take long.
LEADMALE:He hasn't slept all day.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:You are getting sleepy.
OTHERMALE:Very, very sleepy.
SUPFEMALE:Your eyelids are getting heavier.
LEADMALE:Your little head is drooping.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm back.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe we should just try a bottle and a warm bath.
LEADFEMALE:Thought you'd never ask.
LEADMALE:The coffee commercial went great.
LEADFEMALE:First, I take a big sip of coffee, then I 
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm Hilary Banks, TV weather girl.
LEADFEMALE:When I don't have my head in the clouds I like to relax with a nice hot cup of Casual Cup coffee.
OTHERFEMALE:So rich and fine, tastes just like you ground the beans yourself.
LEADMALE:First take, I said, " Tastes just like you found the beans yourself.
SUPMALE:" We did it again, I said, " When I don't have my head in the crowds.
LEADMALE:"
OTHERMALE:So I did it again, and
LEADMALE:Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:How many takes did you do? Only 41.
LEADMALE:You think that would tire me out.
LEADMALE:But I'm more awake now than when I started.
LEADFEMALE:Stupid question, did you forget to spit after each take? Why would I spit it out? I'm nuts about coffee.
LEADFEMALE:It's not made from nuts, it's from beans, so I guess I'm beans about coffee.
LEADMALE:Oh, gee, I'd love to stay and continue this fascinating monologue but I have to get some studying done.
LEADFEMALE:I've always wondered, if coffee's made from beans does that make it a vegetable? Why are you following me? Don't you have to work in the morning? Shouldn't you go sleep? I'd love to go to sleep, but I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm wide awake.
LEADFEMALE:See? Why don't you try doing something boring like reading the dictionary?
SUPFEMALE:Do you have one?
LEADFEMALE:Of course, I do.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think is propping up my makeup table? Finally.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, I need your earplugs, man.
SUPMALE:Hey! Come on, man.
LEADMALE:Listen, I can't concentrate.
LEADFEMALE:I read that same sentence like two million times.
LEADMALE:If this test covers more 
LEADMALE:"Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry", I'm done.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe next time you should promise to yourself not to put things off until the last minute.
LEADMALE:You know what? You're right, man.
SUPMALE:And I've been wanting to squeeze your peezy little head like a grape all day long, and now is as good a time as any.
LEADFEMALE:Give me those earplugs.
SUPMALE:Give me your earplugs, man.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not sharing anything with you, mister.
LEADMALE:Who knows where those ears have been? That's it.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Come here.
OTHERFEMALE:Get over here.
SUPMALE:Get over here.
LEADFEMALE:Get over.
LEADMALE:Time-out, Ashley's home.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley? I thought she was supposed to be upstairs in bed.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you also thought Tupac Shakur was a Jewish holiday.
LEADMALE:Why is everybody still up? You know, you're making it very difficult for me to sneak in.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, even you should know if you're trying to get past Uncle Phil you don't go through the kitchen.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I have a lot to learn.
LEADMALE:No, you learn too much.
SUPFEMALE:What you doing trying to run my phone scam for? Well, it worked.
LEADFEMALE:That's not the point.
LEADFEMALE:Look, the point is you don't realize the dangers that are lurking out there.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Ashley, listen.
SUPMALE:Guys are only after two things.
SUPMALE:I thought they were only after one.
LEADFEMALE:Well, yeah, but they wanna do it more than once.
LEADMALE:That noise is driving me crazy!
LEADFEMALE:Daddy's up? Get down, hide, hide.
SUPFEMALE:Get down.
LEADMALE:I can't stand all that chirping.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey! Geoffrey! You rang? Where did you last put the insecticide? In your soup.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you're a grumpy Gus.
LEADFEMALE:I was having a most wonderful dream.
SUPFEMALE:Amazon women had just bound me with sinuous vines and were taunting me with tangelos.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is a tangelo? "'Tangelo', the fruit of a hybrid citrus tree that is a cross between certain varieties of grapefruit and tangerine.
SUPFEMALE:"
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:No, thank you.
LEADMALE:I never knew how much fun I could have reading the dictionary.
SUPMALE:I mean, it's filled with all kinds of words.
LEADMALE:Big words, little words, abbreviations, common phrases.
LEADFEMALE:Can I look up a word for you?
LEADFEMALE:Go away.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's two words.
SUPMALE:This will take care of that little sucker.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, that's air freshener.
LEADMALE:Well, it's all we have.
SUPFEMALE:It might work.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, perhaps the scent of sea breeze will recall some painful memory for him, and then he'll commit suicide.
LEADMALE:Quick, get in here! You were lucky Uncle Phil didn't catch you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, there's still time.
OTHERFEMALE:What's that supposed to mean? Remember last year when I skipped school so I could pre-register for jury duty? And a little somebody snitched on me? Well, missy, the tables have finally turned.
LEADMALE:Oh, Carlton, you're evil, man.
LEADMALE:Please, don't tell, I'll do anything.
LEADMALE:I'll clean your room.
OTHERMALE:I'll polish your Star Trek figurines.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Now it's coming from the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Get down, get down! That cricket sounds like it's coming from two places at once.
SUPFEMALE:Must be the ventriloquist of the animal kingdom.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Dad, I think it's coming from this side of the counter.
LEADFEMALE:No, you know, Uncle Phil I think he's over here, the sneaky little bugger.
SUPMALE:I was right the first time.
LEADFEMALE:It's coming from the family room.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:I'll hunt that cricket if it's the last thing I do.
LEADFEMALE:His head will make a fine trophy, sir.
LEADMALE:Carlton, you stink.
LEADFEMALE:You just go ahead outside.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go upstairs and get your pajamas.
LEADMALE:You can put them on and pretend you just came down for a snack.
LEADFEMALE:My God, that bug isn't gonna get the best of me.
SUPMALE:Now I know how Captain Ahab felt when he was chasing Moby Dick.
LEADFEMALE:Between the two of you, the cricket is the whale? Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:How'd you like to be unemployed?
SUPFEMALE:What do you mean? "Unemployed.
SUPFEMALE:Out of work, jobless, not being used.
LEADMALE:I.
LEADFEMALE:E.
SUPFEMALE:, a person who does not have a job.
LEADMALE:" See, the answer is right at your fingertips.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Put those on.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, I don't believe this.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God, it's 1:30.
SUPMALE:That's true.
OTHERFEMALE:And it's a shame you always have to learn the hard way.
LEADMALE:As for me, I'm just finishing my paper.
LEADFEMALE:Can't stand it anymore.
LEADMALE:This chirping is boring a hole straight into my skull.
LEADMALE:There she blows, captain.
LEADMALE:By the table! By the table! I got him.
LEADFEMALE:I killed that little sucker.
LEADMALE:Philip, stop charging about like a rogue elephant.
SUPMALE:You're lucky you didn't wake Nicky up.
LEADMALE:My paper.
LEADMALE:Thirty pages of genius gone.
LEADMALE:Oh, well.
SUPMALE:I guess sometimes that little hardworking head just gets squashed into a little black spot, huh? That's funny, ain't it? Listen, you did all this hard work, I didn't do anything and we're both in the same boat.
LEADFEMALE:Except that my paper was optional.
OTHERFEMALE:Optional? Yeah, I was only doing it to get in good with the professor.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, I guess I'll just have to bring him some cupcakes.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:This is Philip Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, I haven't seen Randy and Ashley's been home since 10:30.
SUPMALE:Well, I'll call you back if she knows anything.
LEADMALE:That was Randy's father.
SUPFEMALE:Apparently, Randy decided to go somewhere else after dropping Ashley off.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God I have a responsible child.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey! Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, man.
SUPMALE:Where are you going? I'm gonna go ask Ashley if she knows where Randy went.
SUPMALE:Oh, man, you're not gonna just go up there and wake her up, are you? I mean, she could already have morning breath.
LEADMALE:Will, please.
SUPFEMALE:Randy's father has a very serious problem.
LEADMALE:If she did something like that, I'd throttle her.
SUPFEMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Throttling isn't anything like killing, is it? Not exactly.
OTHERMALE:The second definition of throttle is, "To strangle, choke.
LEADMALE:" Killing is the result of throttling.
LEADFEMALE:Either way, I think we're about to see a demonstration.
SUPMALE:Ashley's not in her room! I'm right here, Daddy.
SUPMALE:I was just in the kitchen getting a snack.
OTHERMALE:We were just in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:I mean the kitchen in the pool house.
SUPFEMALE:The pool house is being fumigated.
SUPFEMALE:Where am I? What am I doing down here? I must have been sleepwalking.
LEADMALE:I better go back to my room.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:You've already lied once tonight.
SUPMALE:Let's not make it a habit.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, none of my other friends had a curfew.
SUPMALE:If I came home at 10:30, everyone would think I was a baby.
OTHERFEMALE:You have to realize that I'm growing up.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, I am your father.
LEADFEMALE:It is my job to protect you.
LEADMALE:It's a job I refuse to quit, and at which I can't afford to fail.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I won't do it again.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, you won't, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Because you're grounded for 10 years.
SUPFEMALE:Ten years? Or whenever you move out of the house.
SUPFEMALE:Whatever comes first.
LEADFEMALE:That's not fair.
LEADMALE:Tell it to the judge.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's me.
LEADFEMALE:I killed the cricket.
LEADFEMALE:What a horrible death.
LEADMALE:But, Dad, you can't do that to me.
SUPFEMALE:Watch me.
SUPFEMALE:But, no! Ding-dong, the cricket's dead Ashley's grounded Now you all go to bed Will, the house is all yours.
SUPMALE:Come on, guys.
LEADFEMALE:"Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry.
OTHERFEMALE:" Come on, Dad, 10 years? The Menendez brothers will be free before I am.
SUPFEMALE:The Menendez brothers got home on time.
SUPFEMALE:Will, wake up.
LEADMALE:Welcome to the exciting world of chemistry.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, it's 8:00.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't have much time to get changed and get to school.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
OTHERFEMALE:I never even got past the first page.
SUPMALE:Well, what are you gonna do?
LEADMALE:Carlton, I'm gonna fail.
SUPFEMALE:Hate to say, I told you so.
SUPMALE:So how'd the test go, Will? I got an 85.
SUPFEMALE:What? But you didn't even study.
LEADFEMALE:How could you have learned everything you had to know about chemistry? Well, the only chemistry I needed was between me and the honey in the next seat.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? You have a good winter.
SUPMALE:Wait a second, Will.
LEADFEMALE:You're not really gonna let people think you cheated? Yeah, I know.
SUPFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:Ready?
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:So how'd the test go, Will?
SUPFEMALE:I failed.
LEADFEMALE:See, Will, you can't put studying off until the last minute.
SUPMALE:I know, I know, you're right.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what? I'm gonna run to the library right now.
LEADMALE:And I'm not leaving until I learn everything to know about chemistry.
SUPMALE:That's the spirit.
LEADMALE:Hi, I'm Hilary Banks, TV weather girl.
LEADMALE:When I don't have my head in the clouds I like to relax with a nice hot cup of
LEADMALE:Cup of hot coffee.
SUPFEMALE:From the top.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at first I said Oh, shoot.
OTHERFEMALE:Damn it.
OTHERFEMALE:Then what did you say?
LEADFEMALE:I forgot.
LEADMALE:And the next take I said, " When I don't have my" Oh, shoot, shoot.
SUPMALE:And the next thing I said
LEADMALE:Hilary how many takes did you do? Only 41.
LEADMALE:You think that would tire me out.
SUPMALE:But I'm more awake now than when we started.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna pass out, you know.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Okay, okay.
OTHERMALE:Everybody, listen up.
LEADMALE:Listen up! As acting manager while Jackie is away, I'd like to announce a few changes.
SUPMALE:Now, due to the numerous requests, the no tipping policy has been waived.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hello.
SUPFEMALE:Don't forget to pick up your applications for the new and exclusive stockroom clerk.
SUPFEMALE:So you're in charge now, huh, Will?
LEADMALE:Oh, sure, you're right.
LEADMALE:And you know what they say.
SUPMALE:Behind every successful man, there's a woman.
OTHERMALE:But if you wanted to switch positions, I'm with that too, know what I mean? Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, where are you going? Where are you going? Come here, girl.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey.
LEADMALE:Professor Milligan.
OTHERMALE:How are you doing? Don't tell me.
SUPFEMALE:Don't tell me.
SUPMALE:You're coming down here to swear me in as the new manager.
SUPFEMALE:You're making the right choice because as you can see, this place is bumping.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe so, but sales aren't.
OTHERFEMALE:Take a look.
LEADFEMALE:You throw a good party, Will, but nobody's spending.
LEADMALE:I'm afraid you're just not management material.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Professor Mil.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, listen.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna let a silly little thing like profits stand in the way of my promotion, are you? I'm sorry, I've already made my decision.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm bringing in one of the most conscientious freshmen business students for the job.
LEADFEMALE:Very meticulous.
LEADFEMALE:Bakes me fresh muffins every day.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, he's 
LEADFEMALE:Well, where did you get this thing?
SUPMALE:They were passing them out at school.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:What's that? The I Hate Hilary newsletter.
LEADMALE:"Dedicated to the premise that weathercaster Hilary Banks is a boob.
LEADMALE:" Get to the insulting part.
LEADFEMALE:"Hilary Banks doesn't know the difference between a cirrus cloud and a cumulus cloud.
OTHERFEMALE:" What is the difference? Will, look around.
OTHERMALE:Do you see my TelePrompTer here? "Hilary's knowledge of the weather is as skimpy as those ridiculous outfits she wears on the air.
LEADFEMALE:" I mean, it's one thing to attack my performance, but my wardrobe? I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:Yep, every business major at ULA wanted The Peacock but my prospectus blew away the competition.
LEADMALE:Who knows? I could be the next Ross Perot.
SUPMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:Let's see.
LEADMALE:Short, obnoxious.
LEADMALE:All you need is a bad haircut.
LEADMALE:And your ears.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm proud of you, son.
LEADMALE:Your first job, and you're running the entire operation.
LEADMALE:That's right, big guy.
LEADMALE:There aren't too many first year students with my level of savvy and maturity.
SUPFEMALE:Fruity Pebbles! And there's a little tugboat inside, Ross.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Dad, the best part is, this could be my ticket to Princeton.
OTHERFEMALE:Professor Milligan says that lvy League schools Iook pretty darn favorably on management experience.
OTHERMALE:How do they feel about guys who still depend on the crossing guard? Hey, that's a dangerous intersection, mister.
LEADFEMALE:Quit putting your hands
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, hey! You two are gonna have to come to an understanding and work this thing out.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:I'm I'm willing to try if you are, boss.
LEADFEMALE:Put it there, Smith.
LEADMALE:Well, Geoffrey, this might be a very good experience for both of them.
LEADFEMALE:Especially Master William who will discover the joy of working for a Banks.
LEADMALE:Hey, Professor Kemp, Professor Meyers.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Will, how are the subs today? Oh, well, you know, sort of like your lectures.
OTHERMALE:Long, stale and full of baloney.
LEADMALE:I'm stupid.
LEADMALE:I just failed, didn't I? Look, check it out, here's a sub on the house.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Instant A.
LEADMALE:What up, Dex? Hey, look, man.
SUPFEMALE:I saw Donna the other night down at the quad and I told her breaking up with you was the biggest mistake she ever made.
SUPMALE:So she'll see me again?
LEADMALE:Oh, no, man, she hates your guts.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, but look, there's always more fish in the sea.
LEADMALE:I should know.
LEADFEMALE:They call me Aquaman.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I've spent the whole morning back in the stockroom.
SUPFEMALE:What a mess.
LEADMALE:Do you believe someone papered the ceiling with hundreds of Jet beauties? That's fly, ain't it? I like to think of it as my own Sistine Chapel.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, Phillipe's been in there worshipping for two hours.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, relax little fellow.
LEADFEMALE:You'll get your turn.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:What up, dog? Dog? Will, this is a place of business, not a kennel.
SUPFEMALE:Therefore, you will greet each customer as 
LEADMALE:"Hello, I'm" Your name here.
LEADFEMALE:"Welcome to The Peacock, where our motto 
LEADMALE:Whatever you want, we've got it.
LEADMALE:" I'll give that a shot, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:My name's Will.
LEADMALE:Welcome to The Peacock, where our motto 
SUPFEMALE:Girl, whatever you got, I want it.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you're getting it all wrong.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, man, as long as I'm getting it.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, personal relationships aside I'm your boss, and you have to listen to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, Carlton, you say something? May I remind you, I'm the one issuing your paycheck? Yes, sir, General Shorcoff.
SUPMALE:That's the spirit, soldier.
OTHERFEMALE:I am so frustrated.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? Mom and I wrote down a bunch of meteorological terms for me to memorize, and I keep screwing them up.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't I become an anchorperson? They don't have to know hardly anything.
LEADMALE:It's commendable that you wanna improve your skills.
LEADMALE:You don't have to impress those newsletter people.
LEADMALE:I don't want to impress them.
LEADFEMALE:I want to smack them.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy you're a judge.
SUPFEMALE:Can't you just throw them in jail or something? Sweetheart, the worst thing you can do is blow this thing out of proportion.
OTHERMALE:Now, if you ignore it, it will probably go away.
LEADFEMALE:Did you really refer to Hurricane Robert as Bobby? Well, Robert just sounded so serious.
LEADFEMALE:It was serious, darling.
LEADMALE:It wiped out half of Miami.
SUPMALE:Well, excuse me for trying to spread a little sunshine.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I just can't stand the idea of people hating me.
LEADMALE:Hilary, people love to attack celebrities.
SUPMALE:It's part of the price you pay for being in the public eye.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call someone who's been through this.
LEADMALE:Who's that, honey? Someone who knows what it's like to be hated.
SUPMALE:Oh, Shannen? Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hilary Banks.
SUPMALE:You remember that I Hate Brenda thing that you went through? What do you mean you don't know me? You spilled a drink on me at Roxbury.
LEADMALE:Hello? Hello? Boy, she's not gonna make many friends with that attitude.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Carlton Banks, Peacock manager.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm afraid these tables are for eating not loitering.
LEADFEMALE:We did eat.
SUPMALE:Yes, you did.
LEADMALE:Seven minutes ago.
LEADFEMALE:Are you saying we have to leave? No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:You can stay if you order something else.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I particularly recommend the shrimpy cocktail.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I could use a little help out here.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't coming out, man! Fine, then you're not getting paid.
LEADFEMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:Carlton, I think we need to have a little talk, man.
SUPMALE:You know bird to nerd.
LEADMALE:Sorry, I'm busy.
SUPFEMALE:So, ladies, have you decided?
OTHERMALE:Drop dead.
LEADMALE:Excellent choice.
LEADMALE:Look around, man.
SUPMALE:The Peacock is a place where people just come to kick it, man.
SUPFEMALE:To relax.
LEADMALE:You know, get away from the pressures of class.
LEADFEMALE:If you start hassling them, they'll go somewhere else.
LEADMALE:Where? The closest competition is three blocks off campus.
LEADMALE:Look, don't you see, Will? We've got these people by the textbooks.
SUPFEMALE:We can charge and pretty much do whatever we want.
OTHERFEMALE:This is like sex to you, isn't it? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know what? It doesn't turn me on, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're being an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think you're gonna do with that, mister? Marking up the prices, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Can't let you do that, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:These people are students.
LEADMALE:They're good people.
LEADFEMALE:Decent people.
SUPFEMALE:They can't afford to pay any more.
SUPFEMALE:Save it for someone who cares.
LEADFEMALE:Freeze, man! Do what you got to do, cowboy.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, give me back my gun.
LEADMALE:Listen, as your boss I'm not gonna tolerate that kind of insubordination.
LEADFEMALE:You're not my boss.
LEADMALE:You're just some butt-kissing, apple-a-day suck up that got lucky.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's it.
LEADFEMALE:That little outburst is going to cost you a reduction in hours.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll do you one better.
LEADFEMALE:How about zero hours? I quit! Oh, yeah? Well, well Don't ask me for any recommendation.
OTHERMALE:I know Will's mad, but this is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he hasn't talked to me in two days.
LEADMALE:What do you think I should do? Count your blessings.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, what's up G?
SUPMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Will, you can't keep me.
SUPFEMALE:It's 
LEADMALE:That's what I 
OTHERMALE:Well, you can't even right.
LEADFEMALE:Stay out of my face, man.
LEADMALE:I'm still not speaking to you.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, be that way.
OTHERFEMALE:Master William I've never seen you behave so coldly.
LEADFEMALE:I like it.
SUPMALE:Well, G, a man has got to stand his ground.
LEADMALE:A man also has to work to pay his bills.
LEADFEMALE:Otherwise, I'd be out parasailing with these.
LEADMALE:Seriously, what are you going to do for money? Already taken care of, G.
LEADFEMALE:Got me a brand new job, three blocks off campus.
LEADMALE:The Chestless Touchdown.
LEADFEMALE:This is an outrage.
SUPMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, I swear that dent was in that car before I hit that mailbox!
LEADFEMALE:What dent?
SUPFEMALE:Exactly.
SUPMALE:So, what were you saying? Those newsletter bozos put up a big "Honk, if you hate Hilary" billboard right at the corner of Sunset and Doheny.
SUPMALE:Oh, damn.
OTHERMALE:That mean they took down the Naughty Nightie girl.
OTHERMALE:Hilary! Hilary! More snow today with temperatures dropping to the low teens this evening.
OTHERFEMALE:Sweetheart, l
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy, I have the greatest idea.
LEADMALE:If I watch the weather in New York I'll have a three-hour jump on the competition.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, that might not work every time.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, when you drove to work today you didn't by any chance go down Sunset Boulevard, did you? Oh, I couldn't.
LEADFEMALE:It was backed up for miles.
LEADFEMALE:And everyone was honking like it was New Year's Eve.
SUPFEMALE:Chance of snow and a minus three wind chill.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, my work is done.
SUPMALE:I'm going shopping.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, I've thought it over, you know, and you're right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna put an end this newsletter business.
OTHERFEMALE:In fact, I'm gonna head down to the law library and get right to work.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Daddy.
LEADMALE:Now, dress warm, it's gonna snow.
SUPMALE:Please don't go.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I apologize for performing the Heimlich maneuver on you.
LEADMALE:I really thought you were choking.
LEADMALE:And now, to create a more festive mood The Peacock is proud to present music from Hawaii.
OTHERMALE:The entertainment charge has already been added into your check.
OTHERFEMALE:Also, we are pleased to announce that the proceeds from our new pay toilets have enabled us to buy this brand new metal detector.
OTHERMALE:Remember, less flatware theft means lower prices for you our valued consumer.
SUPFEMALE:Man, they ought to draw a chalk outline around this place.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jazz.
SUPMALE:So, what can I get you? A sandwich? A T-shirt? Peacock-a-cola?
SUPFEMALE:I made that one up myself.
SUPFEMALE:It shows.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, I just came by to see Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Smith is no longer employed here.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like he took everybody with him too.
LEADMALE:They didn't leave because of Will.
OTHERMALE:They left because of me.
LEADMALE:I mean, they just need time to get acclimated to some of my new policies.
OTHERMALE:Phillipe told me you cut the teeth marks off the pickles and reuse them.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jazz, I'm in real trouble.
LEADFEMALE:My professor's coming down to check on business.
OTHERMALE:You know a lot of people.
OTHERMALE:Maybe you can bring some of them by.
SUPFEMALE:What's in it for me? Well you know how your pigeons are always getting sick all the time? My babies.
OTHERMALE:I'll pay their vet bill for the rest of the year.
OTHERMALE:Even Oliver? He has a heart murmur.
OTHERFEMALE:Even Oliver.
OTHERFEMALE:Be back in an hour.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, what is this? Pretty good job, huh? It's nice to have friends you can call on at the last minute.
SUPMALE:Oliver.
SUPMALE:Banks! What is going on here? Professor Milligan.
LEADMALE:Well, see, sir.
SUPMALE:I've managed to diversify our clientele.
LEADFEMALE:If anybody asks, I've been with you all day.
LEADFEMALE:Banks, I don't know what you've done to this place.
LEADMALE:But whatever it is, I suggest that you fix it, or I'll yank you off this project.
SUPFEMALE:But But, sir, what? Jazz, you better get those freaks out of here immediately.
SUPMALE:You're the boss.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, you weirdos, beat it.
LEADMALE:Daddy, I've got some news.
SUPFEMALE:So do I.
LEADFEMALE:I've filed the necessary court papers.
LEADMALE:We'll have that newsletter killed in no time.
LEADMALE:Daddy, don't you dare.
SUPFEMALE:My ratings this week have gone through the roof.
LEADMALE:They're even talking about letting me announce the lottery number.
LEADMALE:Well, what about your reputation? So, what if a few people don't like me? I'm a hit.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetheart, think about this.
SUPMALE:Is this the kind of fame you want? People are gonna be tuning in, not to hear your weather report but looking for a laugh.
LEADFEMALE:Hello? You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Well, of course, I'm interested.
OTHERFEMALE:Who was that? They're thinking of making me an anchorperson.
LEADFEMALE:I've gotta brush up.
LEADFEMALE:Who is this Bosnia person I keep hearing about? Forty-eight, 49, 50.
LEADMALE:Have fun with them potatoes, spud.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, hey.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I've thought about it, and I can't let you do this to yourself.
OTHERMALE:Hey, come on, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Come back when I'm on a break, all right? Excuse me, may I cut in? Carlton, what are you doing? This is a sports bar, man.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I know you only left The Peacock because of your foolish pride.
LEADMALE:No, I left because of my foolish cousin.
SUPMALE:Will, you can't be happy here.
LEADFEMALE:This is a franchise.
SUPMALE:The kind of place where they treat employees like faceless, anonymous nobodies.
SUPMALE:Will Smith, come on up here.
LEADFEMALE:I know you've only been here four days but the staff has voted you employee of the week! Let's have a hand for Will Smith, huh? And by the way for winning this honor, you get the weekend off with pay.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Carlton, save me from this hellhole.
LEADMALE:Okay, Will, I was willing to let bygones be bygones.
LEADMALE:But I can see it's no use.
SUPFEMALE:It is no use, right? Fine.
SUPMALE:I guess the dream is over.
LEADMALE:I'm obviously not management material.
LEADMALE:All those summers at business camp were just a waste of time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Carlton, hold up, man.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you're not a bad manager.
SUPFEMALE:You just stink when it comes to people.
LEADFEMALE:And you stink when it comes to business.
OTHERMALE:So, what does that tell you? That we both stink.
LEADMALE:Yes, individually.
LEADMALE:But together we'd smell like success.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say, Will? No, man.
LEADMALE:I got a good thing here.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Will.
SUPMALE:I'll make it worth your while.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll give you priority shifts, and you can wear your own clothes and you've got unlimited use of the stockroom.
SUPFEMALE:No, man.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do you want, Will? You know, I kind of want you to beg me.
LEADMALE:Beg? I don't know how to beg.
LEADMALE:I'm rich.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Will, I'll give you $ 1000 if you come back.
LEADFEMALE:Gosh, you don't get it, do you? Carlton, it isn't always about facts and figures and green pieces of paper with dead presidents on them.
LEADFEMALE:Look, a man's most valuable possession is his self-respect.
SUPMALE:Make it 2000.
LEADFEMALE:All right, let me go get my hat.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Professor Mil, chill.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, man.
SUPMALE:Look Now Listen, hey, listen.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:No, hey.
OTHERMALE:Hey, well, listen.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, I got it.
SUPMALE:Okay, I've got it.
LEADMALE:You ready? Let's pick it up from right there.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Peacocks We're marching down the field Peacocks And we refuse to yield No one's tougher 'Cause we are rougher We are the Peacocks of ULA See, now that's exactly why people be pushing you down the steps.
LEADFEMALE:For your information, I've done the peacock strut exactly nine minutes before each game and we've won every time.
SUPMALE:If we beat SCU tomorrow, ULA will be the division champs.
LEADMALE:Like you care.
SUPMALE:You see, now that's where you're wrong, my little pet peeve.
LEADFEMALE:I hope that ULA whoops their butts tomorrow.
LEADMALE:So the fighting peacock within you has finally emerged.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, sir, he came out to bet $500 on the game.
LEADFEMALE:How you disappoint me.
LEADMALE:Well, time to open.
LEADMALE:Let's put on our helpful faces.
SUPMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Who would do such a thing? Guess we can rule out Notre Dame.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Birdman, you're the best mascot this school ever had.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Carlton, what was Coach Kelly talking to you about? Oh, he likes to consult with me before making important game decisions.
LEADMALE:So, what's it gonna be, regular or grape-flavored Gatorade? You can crack wise, Will, but I'm an important part of this team.
LEADMALE:None of those guys will leave the locker room before they rub me for luck.
LEADMALE:Sure they not just rubbing you for fun, baby? Rub this, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, Jazz, what's up, man?
LEADFEMALE:What's up, man? Hey, did your bookie take my bet? You down.
SUPMALE:Five C's on ULA.
SUPFEMALE:You are the man.
LEADMALE:Who else could have found out that the Mustangs' starting quarterback has come down with the flu? It pays to have friends at the urology lab.
SUPMALE:You know, it might serve them SCU punks right.
LEADFEMALE:Messing up the Peacock.
LEADFEMALE:I've been cleaning this place up all day.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you're getting soft.
LEADMALE:The Will Smith I know wouldn't get mad.
LEADMALE:He'd get even.
LEADFEMALE:You know what, Jazz? Tonight, you and I will acquire a vehicle and we're going to acquire the SCU statue.
LEADFEMALE:Swipe Mikey the Mustang? Now, why would I steal something I can't sell? Well, the Jazz I know didn't need a reason to do something stupid.
SUPFEMALE:You're right, Will.
LEADFEMALE:What was I thinking? Here's what we're gonna do.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy.
SUPMALE:Daddy, there's a man under my bed and I didn't tell him to hide there.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, he's from the security company.
SUPFEMALE:I'm thinking of upgrading our alarm system.
LEADMALE:Hilary, there was a robbery in our neighborhood.
SUPFEMALE:Someone cleaned out the entire east wing of the Spelling mansion.
LEADFEMALE:How are they going to fence all that crushed velvet? Here they are, family.
LEADFEMALE:Three tickets to the big game.
LEADFEMALE:See what happens when your son's a mascot? They're right on the 50-yard line.
OTHERMALE:Won't we be in the way? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go check my head for molt.
LEADMALE:You know, Will, it wouldn't hurt if you did something for your school.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know, and I am, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Tonight, I'm stealing the SCU statue.
LEADMALE:Don't even joke about something like that.
LEADMALE:I was just kidding, Uncle Phil.
OTHERMALE:But, well, hey, can I borrow the station wagon? You know, got me kind of a big date tonight, you know? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Sure, here you are, son.
LEADMALE:Thank you, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Will, illegal transportation of a school statue is a felony.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:All right, here's the situation, unless you fortify your security system my guess is within six months you'll all be dead.
LEADMALE:That's a little extreme, isn't it? Extreme? Let me tell you about some of the things I've seen, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks.
OTHERMALE:Homes overrun by thugs and gangs priceless possessions lost forever to ruthless looters.
OTHERFEMALE:Mangled bodies of innocent people slaughtered like lambs.
LEADFEMALE:God, where was this? "Mortal Kombat" by Sega.
SUPMALE:All right, what do you recommend?
SUPMALE:This little baby right here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, come on, this is a bit much, isn't it? I mean, Russia has fallen.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, if you don't care about the safety of your lovely young daughters.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:We'll take the ultimate security package.
LEADMALE:Move in.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, check it out, check it out.
OTHERFEMALE:So we had Mikey the Mustang here wrapped up in blankets in the back of the Volvo, right? So we about to jet off campus.
LEADFEMALE:All of a 
OTHERFEMALE:It's like, "Oh, five-0!" Right, yo, we knew we was busted.
SUPMALE:Man, I saw my whole record flash before my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I had to think fast, right? So I put on this real sincere face before I knew it I had this cop convinced I was Sidney Poitier's son.
LEADMALE:Who's the man? Who is the man? It's me.
SUPFEMALE:Y'all ain't gotta say nothing, go on.
SUPFEMALE:Get on fools.
SUPMALE:Well, I got to go get me a new jacket.
LEADFEMALE:If you need me, I'll be in the lost and found.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, what's that bucking Mustang doing here? Just a little payback to them SCU fools for that stunt they pulled yesterday.
SUPMALE:And you said I didn't have no school spirit.
LEADMALE:You must return it.
LEADMALE:Carlton, we're just having a little fun, man.
LEADFEMALE:I know how much you hate that, baby.
LEADMALE:Don't you understand? SCU is going to retaliate.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you've practically given them an invitation to abscond with Percival.
SUPFEMALE:Who? Hello? Percival, our beloved peacock.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I'm holding you personally responsible for its safety.
SUPFEMALE:Don't take your eyes off of him.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, but, Carlton, no.
SUPMALE:That means I'll miss the big pep rally.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm sorry, Will, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me I have 4000 fans waiting for me in the quad.
LEADFEMALE:Hand me my head.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd love to.
LEADFEMALE:It's show time.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, girls, Carlton's rally starts in 45 minutes.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry I overslept.
OTHERFEMALE:It took me forever to get to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:That guard dog was barking all night.
SUPMALE:Can't he be like other dogs and quietly lick himself? Look, I got this system so that we'd all feel safe.
SUPMALE:Now, I just press in our code and we're off.
LEADFEMALE:Fifty seconds to activation.
OTHERFEMALE:Please exit the premises.
LEADMALE:Maybe he wants a bone.
LEADMALE:Yeah, one of ours.
OTHERMALE:No, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:What is the release command? It's something German.
LEADMALE:Strudel, schnitzel Mercedes.
SUPFEMALE:Let's try the front door.
OTHERMALE:Good idea.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:Twenty seconds to activation.
SUPFEMALE:Please exit the premises.
LEADFEMALE:He's a quick little sucker, isn't he?
LEADMALE:Maybe you should shut off the alarm.
LEADMALE:Good idea.
LEADMALE:Let me see, our code.
LEADFEMALE:Ten seconds to activation.
SUPMALE:Code is seven something.
OTHERFEMALE:Switching to final countdown.
LEADMALE:Ten, nine, eight, seven
LEADMALE:It is Okay, okay, 508 six, five, four
OTHERMALE:No, no three, two, one.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind, please? Activating security system.
LEADMALE:Daddy?
LEADFEMALE:I'll call the security company.
LEADFEMALE:Just stand still.
LEADFEMALE:Be still.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPFEMALE:Just gonna call Intruder, stay where you are.
LEADFEMALE:There is no escape.
LEADMALE:Well, at least we're safe.
SUPFEMALE:Five seconds to automated armed response.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to Carlton? I think my Aunt Helen dropped him on his head when he was a baby.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean, he's late for the rally.
LEADFEMALE:He usually shows up early to help me with the team seating chart.
LEADFEMALE:He left here about an hour ago.
SUPFEMALE:Well, he never showed.
OTHERMALE:I got a feeling in my gut something happened to him.
OTHERMALE:I just know it has.
LEADFEMALE:Look, coach, trust me Carlton wouldn't miss that game for all the cheese in Philly.
LEADMALE:He'll be there or my name ain't
LEADFEMALE:Will! Is this the end of our plucky mascot? Does this spell doom for the Fighting Peacock football team? Stay tuned, same Fresh Prince time, same Fresh Prince channel.
LEADFEMALE:It could be worse.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, he could have been dipped in 11 herbs and spices.
SUPMALE:It's 90 minutes before game time.
SUPMALE:Any sign of Carlton? Well, actually, there is a sign.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:Game over.
LEADFEMALE:We're dead.
LEADFEMALE:He's not exactly Vince Lombardi.
OTHERFEMALE:This is how my career is gonna end, huh? Well, at least I still have my health.
OTHERMALE:What's that lumpy thing on the back of your neck? Listen, listen, coach.
LEADMALE:Coach, listen.
LEADMALE:You're sweating it over nothing.
SUPFEMALE:The game is a lock.
LEADFEMALE:We found out that the SCU starting quarterback came down with the Canadian flu.
LEADMALE:The Canadian flu? What the hell is that? I guess it's just like the American flu, just colder.
SUPMALE:Hogwash.
SUPFEMALE:Every year SCU tries to put out some bogus rumor about one of its star players.
OTHERMALE:Mess up our game plan.
LEADFEMALE:Last year, their kicker had rickets.
SUPMALE:Jazz, you fed me a bad tip, man.
SUPMALE:I might owe your bookie $500 that I don't have.
LEADFEMALE:Tony the Shovel ain't gonna like that.
SUPFEMALE:Just ask Flat Nose Gary.
LEADFEMALE:The Birdman is our team's lucky charm.
LEADFEMALE:Without him, our players won't think they can win.
LEADMALE:And, if they don't have it here, they ain't gonna to have it here.
OTHERMALE:And if they don't have it here, you gonna get it there.
LEADMALE:Jazz, Jazz, come here, come here.
LEADFEMALE:I know where this is.
SUPMALE:This is the rumpus room of the Kappa Omega Psi sorority.
SUPFEMALE:How you know that? Well, I got me a little rumpus in that room the other night, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, come on.
SUPMALE:Let's go, let's go.
SUPMALE:I can't go there, man.
LEADMALE:Why not? Restraining order.
SUPFEMALE:It's a long story.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, but we'll just stick with our old system.
SUPFEMALE:You're making a big mistake, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks.
LEADMALE:Well, we've got everything.
SUPMALE:Except for the dog.
SUPFEMALE:He seems to have chewed his way through the fence.
SUPMALE:What will we do if he comes back?
SUPMALE:Yeah, isn't he kind of dangerous? Only if he hasn't eaten.
LEADMALE:I don't know, maybe we should have given the new system a little more time.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we live in a dangerous world and we should take precautions.
LEADMALE:But turning our home into a bunker isn't the answer.
SUPMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:Let's just get guns.
LEADFEMALE:You're missing the whole point, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:We are lucky enough to live in an area where we don't have to be obsessed with safety.
LEADMALE:We missed Carlton's rally.
LEADMALE:Let's not miss the big game, okay?
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I'm so excited.
LEADMALE:It's gonna be
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Is that? My God! Somebody stole my Mercedes.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you are way too nice to be locked up in a cage.
LEADMALE:Does that mean you'll let me out?
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:But you're awfully cute when you grasp at false hope.
LEADMALE:Look, I know you might find this hard to believe but in high school, I was sort of a Dweeb? Well, I was going to say loner, but that too.
LEADMALE:Now, for the first time, I'm actually part of a team.
LEADMALE:Don't do this to me.
LEADMALE:That was so moving.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm late for the game.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Amanda! Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I'm so glad you're here.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I knew you'd make it.
LEADMALE:Shut up.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Damn.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Will, I'm desperate.
SUPFEMALE:Take off your pants.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're taking this jail thing just a little too far, buddy.
SUPMALE:Look, it's almost game time.
LEADMALE:You're gonna have to go in my place.
OTHERFEMALE:If you think I'm putting on that stupid suit, you're out of your mind.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you don't, you're out 500 bucks.
LEADFEMALE:Unzip me, please.
LEADFEMALE:Gets a little funky in there too, huh? Men, I know this is the first time we've been behind at the half.
OTHERMALE:But all we need is four quick touchdowns.
SUPFEMALE:We'll be right back in this thing.
OTHERFEMALE:He's here.
LEADMALE:Yeah! Hey, it looks bad, Carlton, but now that you're here, we got a chance.
SUPMALE:Do the peacock strut.
SUPMALE:On your feet, boys.
SUPFEMALE:Peacocks We're marching down the field Peacocks And we refuse to yield No one's tougher 'Cause we are rougher We are the Peacocks of ULA Peacocks We're marching down the field Peacocks And we Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey! What the hell are you doing? That's not the peacock strut.
SUPMALE:This is the peacock strut.
LEADMALE:Peacocks We're marching down the field Peacocks And we What? They rough you up or something? Those animals.
LEADFEMALE:Well, at least you're here, and that's all that counts.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, gather around boys, it's time to rub the Birdman.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah!
LEADMALE:Y'all ain't rubbing nothing over here.
LEADMALE:Hey! Hey! You.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's Carlton? Hey, look, we tried to break him out, man, but it wasn't happening.
LEADFEMALE:We're toast.
LEADMALE:I cannot believe what I'm seeing.
LEADFEMALE:Boo-hoo, our mascot ain't here.
LEADFEMALE:You big bunch of babies.
LEADMALE:What about your fans? They got a lot riding on this game.
SUPMALE:Their hopes, their dreams.
LEADFEMALE:Their nose.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, I'm gonna tell y'all one time, and one time only.
SUPMALE:Mascots do not win football games.
LEADMALE:Players do.
LEADMALE:And coaches.
SUPMALE:Hey, you know what, you gentlemen got a choice.
OTHERFEMALE:You can give up and crawl away like spineless, gutless losers or you can pull it together.
LEADMALE:Throw it down, pick it up, strap it on, kick it's butt and go out as champions! Yeah! This is the biggest game you will ever play.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah! Now, sure, some of you may make it to the pros but, let's be honest, for most of you this is the end of the line.
LEADFEMALE:Ye! No more big games, no more free rides.
LEADMALE:No more honeys acting like you all that.
LEADMALE:Let's be honest, we don't even know if half you all are gonna graduate.
LEADMALE:Then, what you gonna do? Coach?
LEADFEMALE:Hey! That's right, you guys, it doesn't matter what we do, we're losers.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute, I didn't That ain't, that ain't Well, wait, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, okay, here's an idea.
LEADFEMALE:Rub me, rub me, rub the bird.
LEADMALE:Rub, rub Hey, Carlton, how'd you get out, man? I escaped while the housekeeper was changing the newspaper.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, fellas, I made it! What did you do to them? Listen Listen, Carlton, that is not important.
OTHERMALE:The most important thing is that you get out right there and you strut like you've never strat.
OTHERFEMALE:Peacocks We're something something field Peacocks pealed
LEADMALE:No one's tougher
LEADFEMALE:Right, right.
LEADMALE:'Cause we are rougher
LEADFEMALE:We are the Peacocks of ULA
SUPFEMALE:Come on, come on, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Peacocks
LEADFEMALE:Yeah! We're marching down the field Peacocks And we refuse to yield No one's tougher 'Cause we are rougher
SUPMALE:We are the Peacocks of ULA
SUPFEMALE:One more time! Man, this victory party is weak.
LEADFEMALE:That's because we lost, Jazz.
SUPMALE:And thanks to you, I'm gonna have a date with Tony the Shovel.
LEADMALE:Well, I hoped you learned your lesson about gambling.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Jazz, check it out, check it out.
LEADMALE:Because you my homey, right? I'll give you a five minute head start before I chase you down and drop kick your little coconut head.
SUPFEMALE:Fair enough.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:Come on, Carlton, cheer up, man, we only lost by one point.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, that was a hell of a comeback.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you should be proud as a peacock.
LEADFEMALE:We played a good game.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just thinking about someone.
SUPMALE:Amanda?
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'll probably never see her again.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet you $500 you'll see her again.
LEADFEMALE:You're on, mister.
SUPMALE:Carlton? Amanda, does this mean what I think it means? Yes, Carlton, I've come to gloat.
LEADFEMALE:We won.
LEADFEMALE:Well, bye.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, that's it? I thought we had something special.
OTHERFEMALE:Dear Carlton, it would never work between us.
SUPMALE:You're a Peacock, I'm a Mustang.
SUPFEMALE:Can you imagine what our children would be like? What, powerful hind legs with a colorful tail? Then I guess this is goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:Just until we graduate.
LEADMALE:I'll wait for you.
SUPMALE:And I'll cut back on dating.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Look, I know if two people like each other it shouldn't matter where they go to school, but the truth is it does.
SUPMALE:Alas, fate has conspired to keep us apart.
LEADFEMALE:That's beautiful, man.
LEADMALE:I just want my $500.
LEADMALE:He's a quick little sucker, isn't he? And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
SUPFEMALE:Only for you.
LEADMALE:Give a little 
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:I'm in.
LEADMALE:I call.
SUPMALE:Me too.
LEADMALE:What you got, man?
LEADMALE:Oh, it's so pretty.
LEADMALE:It's just so pretty.
LEADMALE:If I had two sets of lips, I'd kiss myself.
LEADFEMALE:Trump aces.
LEADMALE:Well, it's 9:30.
LEADFEMALE:Time to turn in.
LEADMALE:The Peacock's catering a big party tomorrow night after Michelle Michaels' concert.
SUPMALE:I suggest you get some shuteye, mister.
LEADFEMALE:We'll be melon balling at 0600.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe you'll be hanging out with Michelle Michaels.
OTHERFEMALE:She is a goddess.
LEADFEMALE:Please, she put her bra on one cup at a time just like everybody else.
SUPMALE:I'd pay big money to see that.
LEADFEMALE:Save your dough for Friday night.
LEADMALE:What's Friday night? There's people coming.
LEADMALE:We're gonna watch the fight on Pay Per View.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, I have better things to do with my Friday nights than sit around, watching some stupid boxing match on TV.
OTHERMALE:Well, you overlooked one small fact, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:What's that?
SUPFEMALE:You weren't invited.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, now, hold it.
SUPMALE:Now, don't think of this just as a backstage pass.
LEADFEMALE:Think of it more as a merit badge.
SUPMALE:What are you going to do to earn it? You got to do something.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? What's up? What you gonna do? Will, we have a crisis situation.
SUPFEMALE:The glasses have spots on them.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
OTHERFEMALE:Why didn't you come to me sooner? Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Relax, squeeky.
LEADMALE:It's just a dumb old party.
OTHERFEMALE:You don't look at the big picture, do you? Today, Michelle Michaels, tomorrow, Gloria Estefan.
OTHERFEMALE:And then, dare I dream, Michael Bolton.
LEADMALE:Lan, I didn't feel like anything was clicking tonight.
SUPMALE:You sure the new songs are working? Three words, babe, fabulous.
SUPMALE:Am I right? Look at that.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody jumping.
LEADMALE:People act so stupid when celebrities get around.
SUPFEMALE:I need a reality check.
LEADMALE:You, waiter.
OTHERFEMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:Me? Yeah, you.
SUPFEMALE:Miss Michaels wants to see me.
SUPFEMALE:Have you heard my new record?
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, sure, baby, who hasn't?
LEADMALE:It's magic, isn't it?
SUPFEMALE:Right, sister.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:Do you like it? Well, you got some beats.
LEADMALE:You do got some beats.
LEADMALE:And you mix some lyrics with your beats, and you blended them.
LEADMALE:Be honest.
LEADMALE:I think it stinks.
LEADFEMALE:I apologize, Miss Michaels.
LEADFEMALE:He's from a foreign land.
LEADFEMALE:Back to work, Vladimir.
LEADMALE:Carlton Banks here.
OTHERMALE:I balled your melons.
LEADMALE:Get out of here.
SUPFEMALE:So is there anything you do like about my record? Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:That cover is slamming, you know.
SUPFEMALE:How long it take you to get all that honey off you, girl, you know? You look all sticky and everything, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just acting stupid, you know.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'm just tripping.
LEADMALE:I can't believe that I'm actually talking to Michelle Michaels.
LEADFEMALE:And I can't believe I'm actually talking to Who are you? Will Smith, of the Philadelphia Smiths.
LEADMALE:So, honest Will.
LEADMALE:Did you like the show? I've been back here.
LEADFEMALE:I couldn't hear anything.
LEADFEMALE:All I heard 
OTHERFEMALE:I really didn't have it going on, but next time I'm gonna kick it and maybe you could be there.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I'm with that.
LEADMALE:That's a good idea.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:I need to get back to work.
SUPFEMALE:See you later?
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Miss Michaels, I thought your album stunk too.
SUPFEMALE:She only wanted to know my opinion.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, I cannot believe Michelle Michaels actually spoke to you.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I checked her coat.
LEADMALE:Really? I wonder who'll play you in the movie of her life? You know what, Will? Maybe I'll get you Michelle Michaels' new CD for your birthday.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my goodness, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:I do have a birthday coming up.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it just totally slipped my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Now, now, listen.
LEADMALE:Nothing too fancy.
LEADMALE:Something in a hatchback will do just fine.
LEADFEMALE:You're impossible to surprise, so this year, we're not doing anything special.
LEADMALE:Okay, we're all set.
LEADMALE:Birthday reservations at Wolfgang Puck's new restaurant.
SUPMALE:Hilary.
SUPMALE:Oh, that's all right.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about it.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Viv, you can still surprise me with that red sweater you hiding in the upstairs closet.
SUPFEMALE:Wolfgang Puck, huh? You were great.
SUPMALE:He fell for it.
LEADMALE:Now he'll never suspect we're giving him a surprise party.
LEADMALE:We're giving him a surprise party? I am proud to announce Miss Michelle Michaels.
SUPFEMALE:Are you stalking me? No, I just wanted to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:It was so nice to talk to somebody other than a hysterical fan.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God, Michelle Michaels! Your second song on your third album is so cool.
LEADFEMALE:Who was Omar? Is he your boyfriend?
LEADMALE:He is so fine.
SUPFEMALE:You might never
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, please.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary Banks, TV weathergirl.
SUPMALE:Pardon my little sister.
LEADMALE:She doesn't know how to talk to celebrities.
SUPMALE:So, Mich.
LEADFEMALE:How about a song? Oh, hello there.
SUPMALE:I'm Philip Banks.
SUPMALE:This is my wife, Vivian.
SUPMALE:We're not hip, so we don't know your music.
LEADMALE:It's nice to meet you anyway, though.
LEADFEMALE:Now, let's give them some privacy.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come upstairs.
LEADMALE:It was nice meeting you, Michelle.
LEADMALE:It's good to see you again, Michelle.
LEADFEMALE:Miss Michaels?
LEADFEMALE:Yes? Don't think of me as just a manservant, think of me as a pleasure dome.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, G.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:Well, that was embarrassing.
SUPMALE:No, they're sweet.
SUPMALE:So do you wanna come to my concert tonight? You can watch from backstage.
LEADMALE:Oh, goodness.
LEADFEMALE:See, tonight is dime-a-frame bowling night, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Top scorer gets those cute little shoes and I just couldn't miss that.
OTHERMALE:I'll send a limo for you at 6.
LEADMALE:Then, after the concert, she took me to this fly restaurant called Chez Pinette.
OTHERMALE:Chez Pinette? Isn't that up near San Francisco? Oh, did I forget to tell you-all? She flew me up there in her private jet.
SUPMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:Michelle has a private jet? Listen, she got a private jet.
SUPMALE:She has yacht.
LEADFEMALE:Does she have a brother? Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I'll find out tonight.
SUPMALE:We're going to the Golden Choice Music Awards.
SUPFEMALE:They got us sitting between lke and Tina just in case something flare up.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, y'all, don't wait up.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, is the coast clear? No, there's gonna be patchy morning fog with limited visibility.
LEADFEMALE:I meant is Will gone?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, he's gone.
SUPFEMALE:Let's talk about this party.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Hilary, you are getting the DJ and I arranged for the caterer.
OTHERMALE:Why do I have to pay for a caterer if I have a butler? Philip complains.
LEADFEMALE:That only leaves the cake.
LEADMALE:All set.
SUPFEMALE:I ordered a Sunny the Seal ice-cream cake.
LEADMALE:His sleek little body is made of chocolatey goodness and he balances a ball of tutti-frutti sherbet on his buttercream nose.
LEADMALE:You are way too into this.
SUPFEMALE:I guess at your age, birthdays are no longer a cause for celebration.
LEADMALE:I'm giving up a hair appointment with Sergai to hang out with Will and his loser friends.
LEADMALE:Will's friends are not losers.
LEADFEMALE:Greetings, y'all.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz, to what do we owe your presence? My guess would be inbreeding.
SUPMALE:I'm taking care of the entertainment for Will's party.
SUPFEMALE:I've already shelled out for a DJ.
LEADMALE:Perfect.
LEADMALE:Now we have music for my stripper.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, You are not bringing a naked woman into my house.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:You don't understand, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:She don't come in naked.
LEADMALE:Where is Will? He was supposed to be here at 7.
SUPFEMALE:That's it.
OTHERMALE:I'm leaving.
SUPMALE:Where are you going? Sergai keeps the salon open till 9.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna see if he can squeeze my head in.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks, can I borrow 50 more bucks for Princess Lalet? Otherwise, she gonna leave.
LEADMALE:Let her go.
OTHERMALE:I've spent enough money on this party.
OTHERMALE:Here's 100 dollars.
LEADFEMALE:No telling when Will will come back.
SUPMALE:Well, he didn't leave a message on the answering machine.
OTHERMALE:Maybe that's him now.
SUPMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:You're an hour and a half late.
LEADMALE:What, do you mean you can't make it? Friends? What friends? So, birthday boy, you having fun? This is the best birthday I ever had.

SUPFEMALE:Hey, what does this button do?
LEADFEMALE:No, Will.
OTHERMALE:It's the moon roof.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and that's funny? You think that? Okay, no, no.
LEADMALE:No, what are you doing? Don't.

SUPMALE:You know, I just got caught up in the moment.
LEADMALE:Oh, hell, yeah.
LEADMALE:Greetings from Aspen.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you, what a night.
LEADMALE:You open up the hot tub and the neighbors come out.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm saying? I didn't even mind Bruce and Demi, you know.
SUPFEMALE:I really didn't mind Arnold and Maria.
LEADMALE:But Frank and Kathy Lee came over with that little dude Cody.
SUPMALE:He made bubbles in the Jacuzzi without the jets on.
OTHERMALE:You know what I'm saying? Nasty little dude, you know.
SUPMALE:You have got a lot of nerve, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Right, big guy? Oh, yeah, right, right.
LEADMALE:Will, this Maria Shriver full-figured gal?
LEADFEMALE:Philip? Will We were throwing you a big surprise party.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you were? I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we was just gonna have dinner.
LEADFEMALE:A cleverly orchestrated ruse, bub.
SUPFEMALE:And to think, I laid out 50 big ones on your damn cake.
SUPMALE:And not just any cake.
OTHERMALE:I got you that really neat one in the commercials.
LEADFEMALE:The one that 
LEADMALE:Carlton.
LEADMALE:All right, okay.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I said I'm sorry, all right? Well, look, I know somebody that wants to hear about my snowball fight with Denzel.

LEADFEMALE:Will, no!
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Hil!
LEADFEMALE:Will, no, no! Don't go up there!
LEADMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, what is wrong with you? Will, I don't think Hilary wants to see you right now.
SUPFEMALE:Why, what did I do to her? You made her miss her appointment with Sergai.
LEADFEMALE:She had to settle for his assistant.
LEADFEMALE:So what? Damn.
LEADMALE:And I mean that in the nicest possible way, Hil.
LEADMALE:I look like a troll doll.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary, don't you think you're overreacting just a tad? Sleep with one eye open.
LEADFEMALE:Look, come on, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Cut me some slack here.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Now, if you had a choice between an ordinary yet very thoughtful birthday party, and hitting the slopes with a superstar which one would you choose? You mean, which superstar would I choose?
SUPFEMALE:Well, if I had to
SUPFEMALE:Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Michelle Michaels may not feel as serious about all this as you do.
SUPMALE:Does that look like she's playing, Aunt Viv? She gave it to me in Aspen.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going? She's taking me to see the fight in Vegas.
LEADFEMALE:What about the fight party you excluded me from? You got the guys coming over to watch it on TV.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm glad you reminded me, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Listen, make sure they don't let you in, okay? And there's the end of round one.
SUPFEMALE:This is better than watching the fights with my Uncle Phil.
OTHERMALE:I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, now, how could I not be enjoying myself? I got Vegas, you, me a black dude and a white dude beating each other.
LEADMALE:Life is good.
SUPFEMALE:Here, let me grab us a little something here.
SUPMALE:Michelle, I got to tell you ever since the barbecue at Wesley Snipes' crib I kind of been wanting to say something to you.

LEADFEMALE:Michelle is a one-man woman now, all right?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really?
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, sir.

OTHERFEMALE:It kind of reminds me of this one right here.
LEADMALE:So are we all friends now? Oh, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:We found out we had a lot in common.
LEADFEMALE:Look, black Fabio, listen.

LEADMALE:Are you squaring off on me, fool? What you gonna do? What you gonna do? Poor Rick.
LEADFEMALE:He'll be in the hospital for weeks now.
LEADMALE:How did I know he was gonna fall on Sinatra? I think you overreacted.
SUPMALE:What am I supposed to do with a dude putting his hands all over my woman? Look, besides, he deserved it.
SUPMALE:He stole one of your rings.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I gave him that ring.
LEADMALE:You did? Yeah, I did.
SUPMALE:I give out a lot of rings.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm saying, this one you gave me is the last one though, right? I just gave one to the paramedic.
OTHERFEMALE:I was wondering why he was taking your pulse.
LEADMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:You're so adorable.
LEADFEMALE:But I think we need to take some time off.
SUPMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna play slots.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be back in an hour.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:Sit.
OTHERMALE:It's been fun.

SUPFEMALE:This is more like see you later.
LEADMALE:I'll see you later, Will.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Michelle.
SUPMALE:Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:It was a hell of a fight last night, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, champ ain't no joke, right? I was referring to your bout.

LEADFEMALE:There ain't gonna be no rematch.
LEADMALE:When dude get out of the hospital, he can have her.
SUPFEMALE:She dumped you, right? Man, you crazy? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it was a nice ride while it lasted, huh? You know what, Uncle Phil? I think I loved her.
LEADFEMALE:Bull.
LEADMALE:You hardly even knew her.
SUPMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Uncle Phil, I knew her.
SUPMALE:You know what I'm saying? I knew her.
SUPFEMALE:You might have known her intimately.
LEADMALE:But you didn't know her well.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, face it, Will.
LEADMALE:It was the lifestyle you're in love with.
SUPMALE:Time out.
OTHERMALE:You trying to say that the only reason I loved her was because she was rich and let me sponge off of her? Then I love you too, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe you guys did this.
SUPMALE:We waited an hour and a half.
OTHERFEMALE:What's a couple more days?
SUPFEMALE:We even saved Sunny the Seal for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Really, where? 
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:She still ain't show up yet, Carlton? No, and I've been waiting over two hours.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, man, don't even be beating yourself up like this.
LEADMALE:Everybody gets stood up once.
SUPFEMALE:Once a month? Why did I ever trust a computer dating service? Carlton, hey, hey, come on, man.
LEADMALE:Look, chances are, a girl who matches up with you has already taken her own life.
SUPMALE:Very funny.
LEADMALE:I'll be back in the stockroom in the dark.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm looking for Carlton Banks.
LEADMALE:Just a second.
OTHERMALE:Just a second.
LEADFEMALE:What took you so long, girl? Damn.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, so tell me again.
SUPFEMALE:Once the bread is in those little slots, you just slide the lever down? Fascinating, isn't it?
OTHERMALE:Hilary
LEADFEMALE:Not now, I'm learning how to cook.
LEADMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, madam.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, do you know what day it is today?

OTHERMALE:Gosh, for real? Aunt Viv, can I be excused from the table? I'm just too darned excited to eat.
LEADMALE:But Mom, Dad, I've reserved special seats right next to the speakers for you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you, son, but your father's got some special plans for us tonight.
LEADMALE:You big romantic guy you.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, can you drive me and my date to the movies tonight? Sorry, Ash, but I'm preparing dinner for my Valentine.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to be a breeze.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, I'll give you a ride.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy, please, I don't wanna spoil your plans for tonight.
LEADMALE:I don't have anything special planned.
LEADFEMALE:What about our big evening? Oh, that's much later.
SUPFEMALE:So who are we dating?
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, please.
LEADMALE:This is not going to help my reputation.
SUPFEMALE:What's wrong with your reputation? You are.
LEADMALE:You gave every date I had the third degree.
LEADFEMALE:Boys will not even come near me at school without having a lawyer present.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:What is wrong with you, girl? Will, daddy is going to drive me and my date to the movies tonight.
LEADMALE:That doesn't sound like that's a big deal.
SUPFEMALE:Will, the last time daddy drove me and my date to the movies he wound up sitting in the two seats behind us.
LEADMALE:Couldn't you just drop us off and pick us up? Oh, I'm afraid that's a little bit of a problem, Ashley.
LEADMALE:See, this girl that I'm dating tonight is kind of like a 6.
OTHERFEMALE:6 on the Richter scale so I wanna be there, you know, for all the aftershocks.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you're saying.
SUPMALE:I'm doomed.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley? I've circled the movies I feel are appropriate for you and your friend.
LEADMALE:Free Willy.
LEADMALE:Beethoven 's 2nd?
LEADFEMALE:The Return of the Care Bears?
LEADMALE:Oh, that was my first choice.
OTHERMALE:Oh, but if your mother asks tomorrow I didn't get any extra butter on my popcorn.
SUPMALE:Oh, whoa, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, check it out.

SUPMALE:I'm not gonna have my daughter involved in one of your wild evenings.
LEADFEMALE:We playing miniature golf.
LEADFEMALE:That'll be cool unless the church group shut that place down, you know?
LEADMALE:And afterwards?
SUPFEMALE:Well, I was thinking we'd run some guns to Nicaragua but we'll probably just come home.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, Will.
LEADFEMALE:She's in your hands.
OTHERFEMALE:But if anything happens to her, those hands will be without fingers.
SUPMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:Lose my fingers, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, good evening, everyone, and welcome to rocking Valentine's Eve.
LEADMALE:Now I know, most of you are wondering two 
LEADFEMALE:"How does he dress so well?" and " What is this thing called karaoke anyway?" Actually, karaoke has two definitions.
LEADFEMALE:Carry, as in carry a tune and oke, as in okey-dokey, let the good times roll.
LEADMALE:I swear, I made that reservation a week ago.
LEADMALE:Philip, why don't you be a man and admit that you forgot Valentine's Day.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I admit, I just forgot.

SUPFEMALE:So why you taking that out on me? What a piece of junk.
LEADMALE:Tow trucks used to follow me around like vultures.
SUPMALE:You deserve better, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Perhaps.

LEADMALE:What you talking about? Will, I believe you have the makings of a super salesman, and together we can make piles of money.
OTHERMALE:Of course, my pile would be bigger.
SUPFEMALE:How about Saturdays?
LEADMALE:Saturdays? I tell you, throw a CD changer in my uncle's Evader, you got a deal.
SUPMALE:Done.
LEADMALE:How about Sundays?
LEADMALE:You gotta give me some wire wheels.
LEADFEMALE:Holidays?
SUPMALE:Got to give a brother cellular for that.
LEADFEMALE:"As you become more comfortable as a salesman you'll develop your own style.
LEADMALE:" Say, baby, with all that butt, you might be needing a hatchback.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna be so rich.
LEADMALE:Hi, Will.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey.
LEADMALE:Hil, you mind if I kick my sales rap on you? Pretend you're buying a car.
SUPFEMALE:No offense, Will, but I would never buy a car from you.
LEADMALE:Hil, we're pretending here.
LEADFEMALE:You're not my cousin, you're somebody else.
SUPMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Hi, I'm Will Smith.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm the Baroness Natasha.
LEADMALE:I am on holiday in your country with my husband, the baron, and my lover Gustav.
LEADMALE:Okay, look, baroness, I was wondering if I could interest you in a sporty new Evader?
LEADFEMALE:It has a V6 dual overhead
LEADMALE:Yes, of course, I take six.
SUPFEMALE:Gustav, pay the man.
LEADFEMALE:You take jewels, yes? Hey, thanks a lot, Hil.
LEADFEMALE:My pleasure.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm off.
LEADFEMALE:You most certainly are.
LEADMALE:Look, G, I was wondering if my sales Peasant! Hey, can I kick my sales rap around with you? Later.
LEADMALE:Your Aunt Viv and I are going for a ride in Daddy's new toy.
SUPMALE:What is that?
SUPMALE:This is cruising music.
SUPFEMALE:Al Green and the Isley Brothers.
OTHERFEMALE:Sookie, sookie, now.
OTHERFEMALE:Baby.
SUPMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, Will, Will.
OTHERMALE:Man, congratulations.
LEADMALE:Five cars in one day.
SUPFEMALE:I've never seen anything like it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, I have.
SUPFEMALE:Me.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm telling you, boss, it is the best feeling in the world.
LEADMALE:Well, there's a close second.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I'm talking about.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I'm talking about.
LEADMALE:Well, there'll be plenty of time for that.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if you feel good now, take a look at your commission check.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, are my pants wet? How many of your friends can say they made that kind of money in one day? What you mean, legally? But it's a shame.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow, when you're in some chemistry class learning about inert gases, someone will be stealing your commissions.
LEADFEMALE:Now, that's where you're wrong.
SUPFEMALE:That's the spirit.
LEADMALE:I don't take chemistry, but I damn sure know math.
LEADMALE:So you can figure what a full-time check would be? Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Five times this, carry the six, and add a zero.
LEADFEMALE:And what do you get?
LEADFEMALE:I get out of school.
LEADFEMALE:Shake hands with your new full-time man.
LEADFEMALE:Whoomp, there it is.
OTHERMALE:Isn't this great? Family fun and no Will.
OTHERMALE:Your turn, son.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, to me.
LEADFEMALE:"You're in a store and you find $50 on the ground.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you pick it up?" Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey picks it up.
LEADFEMALE:Your turn, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:"It's clear your teenage daughter is not enjoying the tedious board game being played in a forced family-bonding moment.
SUPFEMALE:What do you do?" Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I try to encourage family time together, and this is the thanks I get.
SUPFEMALE:If you don't wanna play, you don't have to.
LEADMALE:Go on, get out of here!
OTHERMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:That's what it says on the card.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'd ask if there was something else she'd rather do and discuss an alternative.
LEADMALE:Good answer, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I bet you feel like a big dummy.
OTHERMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:Yo, I tore up that sales chart today.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, congratulations, Will.
LEADFEMALE:If you find something that excites you, hold on to it.
LEADFEMALE:That's what gets me through the day.
LEADFEMALE:So, Uncle Phil, what you're saying is that if a guy finds a job that he likes, he should give it his all.
SUPMALE:Absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:Then I'm doing the right thing.
LEADFEMALE:Of course you are.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? I'm thinking I'm gonna quit school and sell cars full-time.
SUPMALE:Boy, have you lost your damn mind? There is no way you're gonna quit school as long as I'm here.
OTHERMALE:Aunt Viv, it's not like I'm working fries in some burger joint.
OTHERMALE:Look, I'm in a suit and a tie and I'm selling fine cars.
OTHERFEMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:College isn't for everyone, and if Will is happy I think we should all be happy for him.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:Hey, thanks a lot, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I get my license in a few months.
LEADFEMALE:You think you could hook me up? Ashley, go to your room.
LEADFEMALE:Cherry red.
SUPFEMALE:I got you.
OTHERMALE:You know.
LEADMALE:I got you, go ahead.
LEADMALE:Your mother sent you here so you could have a bright future.
SUPMALE:You quit school, you're throwing it all away.
LEADMALE:I won't allow that.
LEADFEMALE:See, now, that's not fair.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary dropped out of school and turned out great.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary's success is contrary to the laws of nature.
LEADFEMALE:Totally inexplicable.
LEADMALE:Oh, stop.
LEADMALE:Look, that was a bad example.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I think it's stupid
SUPMALE:Stupid? It's not stupid.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey! Could we talk to Will in private, please? It's idiotic.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, you go to college to figure out what you wanna do.
LEADMALE:I mean, I found what I wanna do, and it ain't taking me no four years.
LEADFEMALE:Going to college is not about finding a job.
LEADMALE:It's also about finding yourself.
SUPMALE:And the search should take more than one weekend.
LEADFEMALE:Why can't you guys respect my decisions and treat me like an adult? Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling your mother.
SUPMALE:Oh, Aunt Viv.
OTHERMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, I got to do this, man.
LEADMALE:All right, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, come on, man, it's not the end of the world.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADMALE:If I'd waited a few days, I could have bought that car from you wholesale.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, what up, J?
SUPFEMALE:Yo.
SUPMALE:I need to ask you a favor.
SUPMALE:I need a car with a back seat.
LEADMALE:Jazz, I can't just give you a car to take off the lot, man.
LEADMALE:Who said anything about leaving the lot? This will do just fine.
SUPMALE:Get out.
SUPMALE:Get out! Come on, Ophelia.
SUPFEMALE:That's all right, I have a real friend at the bus depot.
LEADFEMALE:Well, this is impressive, man.
LEADMALE:Twelve units in your first week.
LEADMALE:You realize I have people on my staff who don't sell 12 cars in a year? Well, they in the wrong business.
LEADFEMALE:So you think I should fire Harrison, do you?
LEADMALE:I didn't say that.
LEADMALE:Well, you're wrong.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:You should fire him.
SUPFEMALE:What? Me?
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Because I think you're excellent management material.
LEADFEMALE:Here, sit down.
LEADMALE:Put your feet up.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:See? Looks good on you.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Feels nice on my butt too.
LEADFEMALE:Imported cigar?
SUPMALE:Lf that's all you got.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Bite the end off.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not too sure about this firing thing, man.
LEADMALE:Will, Harrison's been sliding downhill for years.
SUPMALE:His sales record is embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE:Especially when compared to a mover like you.
SUPMALE:Go ahead, put him out of his misery.
LEADFEMALE:It's the only humane thing to do.
SUPMALE:This chair is made out of leather, isn't it? All right, all right.
SUPMALE:Say, Harrison, you got a second, man? Sure, I'm just doing some paperwork.
LEADMALE:You know, some nights I can barely tear myself away from this desk.
LEADMALE:Maybe you can take it with you.
OTHERMALE:Look, Harrison
OTHERMALE:Don't get me wrong.
LEADMALE:Did you know I have six kids? No, I didn't know that.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I bet you'd love to spend more time with them, wouldn't you? Sure, especially since Mary died.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, man, did you know Harrison has six kids and a dead wife? Of course I know.
SUPMALE:He's my brother.
LEADMALE:See, now, that's cold, man.
LEADMALE:No, Will, that's business.
LEADFEMALE:When you're the manager, you make the tough decisions.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, man.
LEADFEMALE:Firing people ain't fun.
LEADMALE:It's an acquired taste.
LEADFEMALE:You'll learn it.
LEADFEMALE:I have faith in you.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know, man.
LEADFEMALE:That's it, you're out of here, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be eyeballing me neither.
LEADFEMALE:Get on, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Get on! And wash those shirts.
SUPMALE:Especially you.
SUPFEMALE:That's three less mechanics to worry about.
LEADMALE:Great.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow, we hit the parts department.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I'll buy you a steak.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:Come on, man, you missed a spot.
OTHERMALE:You're fired! Fired! Now, look, the bottom line is, he wasn't producing.
LEADMALE:Now, in this business, you either cut it or you don't.
SUPFEMALE:And he didn't.
LEADFEMALE:So y'all can take your bellyaching elsewhere because it's falling on deaf ears.
LEADFEMALE:Get on out of here before I have to take my belt off.
LEADFEMALE:Yo! Oh, that's funny? Y'all think that's funny? What were my nieces and nephews doing here? Yeah, they were coming to plead your brother Harrison's job.
LEADFEMALE:I guess none of them good salesmen either, huh? You're beginning to scare me.
LEADFEMALE:Can I adopt you? Hey, Pete, do you remember November 6, 1987? How can I forget? That's the day I set the sales record for the entire Southern California area.
SUPMALE:I sold 11 cars.
LEADFEMALE:Well, 10.
LEADFEMALE:One of them had an exploding gas tank.
LEADMALE:As far as I'm concerned, once they leave the showroom, it's a sale.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that don't matter, because today I'm gonna sell 15.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody can sell 15 cars.
LEADMALE:Will Smith can sell 15 cars.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Why don't you try your hand at that angry sister that just came in.
LEADMALE:Yo, man, that's my mom.
SUPFEMALE:So what? A sale's a sale.
LEADMALE:Hey, Ma.
LEADMALE:Boy, where do you get off dropping out of school?
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Smith, if I may interject
LEADMALE:Who the hell are you? Mom, this is my boss.
SUPFEMALE:This is Mr.
LEADMALE:Fletcher.
LEADFEMALE:So you're the snake that lured my boy from that fine institute of higher learning.
SUPFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Smith, your son has a bright and productive future here at Mulholland Motors.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? You ever been beat up by a woman? Not without having paid for it.
LEADMALE:Will, I'll be in my office hiding under the desk if you need me.
SUPMALE:Now, Mom, listen.
LEADMALE:For the first time in my life I found something that I'm good at and that I enjoy.
OTHERMALE:It feels good, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah?
LEADFEMALE:Does this feel good?
SUPMALE:Mom.
SUPMALE:Which way is that college?
SUPMALE:Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Mom!
SUPMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:This doesn't feel good, Mom.
SUPMALE:My commission! This fat-free cake isn't bad.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, that's a sponge.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I'll start my homework now.
LEADMALE:I got a lot of studying to do if I expect to make the best of this wonderful opportunity to get my college education! Will, your mother's not here.
LEADMALE:She went out to dinner with your Aunt Viv.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, she better had.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I'm sorry we had to involve her in this but you really left us no choice.
LEADFEMALE:How in the world did she get the college to readmit you? She threatened to enroll herself.
LEADFEMALE:We're all glad you finally came to your senses.
SUPFEMALE:You have plenty of time to figure out what you wanna do with your life.
LEADMALE:And being a car salesman didn't exactly bring out your most endearing qualities.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, I was getting paid, man.
LEADFEMALE:Will, what you do for a living should provide you with a sense of pride and personal fulfillment.
LEADMALE:It should tap into that part of you that has something valuable to give to the world.
SUPMALE:Shouldn't be just about money.
SUPMALE:You really believe that, Uncle Phil?
LEADMALE:Yes, son, I do.
LEADMALE:Then how do you explain being a lawyer? I'm going to get another piece of sponge.
OTHERFEMALE:How in the world did she get the college to readmit you? She threatened to enroll herself.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, we're all gla Well, we're all glad you came to your senses.
LEADFEMALE:You have plenty of time to figure out what you wanna do with your life.
LEADMALE:And being a car salesman didn't exactly promote your * * * *.
LEADMALE:It didn't promote? Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:It's people from the Lord.
LEADFEMALE:There's people of the Lord in the audience.
LEADMALE:Well, it ain't like they ain't never used that word.
SUPMALE:We sorry.
SUPFEMALE:See See, James Avery See, he's a heathen.
SUPMALE:He's just a heathen.
SUPFEMALE:Amen.
LEADFEMALE:He's a blasphemer.
LEADMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Hey, my brother.
SUPMALE:I just came back from the free clinic, and guess what I got? What, man? The phone number of those two nurses we met.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, the twins that sleep in the same bed? With some luck, we can put an end to that streak.
LEADFEMALE:You the man.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey, Phillipe, I need you to cover my next shift.
LEADMALE:Actually, cover my next three shifts.
OTHERFEMALE:You know how demanding twins can be.
SUPMALE:Yes, my brother, it's gonna be some night.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I just remembered, I can't go.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why not?
OTHERMALE:I'm getting married.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, you're getting married? Her name is Jewel Robertson.
SUPFEMALE:I saw her on Cops, getting busted for grand theft auto.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, the woman's a convict? We prefer the term "freedom impaired.
LEADFEMALE:" How about the term "not playing with a full cell block"? You don't understand, man.
LEADFEMALE:Jewel makes my life complete.
OTHERFEMALE:See, I know you look at me and you say, "Damn, that Jazz has it all.
LEADMALE:" But the truth is, behind these shades, there's a big, empty hole.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's for damn sure.
LEADMALE:And I was gonna make you my best man.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Your best man? Well, you are my best friend.
LEADMALE:My other friends pretend to like me for my money.
LEADMALE:That's because you owe it to them.
OTHERMALE:The ceremony's at the Woman's Correctional Institution next Tuesday.
LEADMALE:Whoa, Jazz.
OTHERMALE:You're getting married at the prison? Why not.
LEADMALE:It's free.
LEADFEMALE:We follow an execution.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, ain't no homey of mine getting married up in no prison.
LEADMALE:Well, unless you got a rich uncle or something, that's how it's got to be.
OTHERFEMALE:There she is, Jewel Robertson, number 54820 out of Folsom Prison.
LEADFEMALE:Crime, grand theft auto.
LEADMALE:Time served, two years.
SUPFEMALE:Let's take a look at the videotape.
LEADFEMALE:Officer down.
LEADFEMALE:Officer down.
LEADMALE:We need backup.
SUPMALE:Get her off of me.
LEADFEMALE:She's biting my Has Jazz lost his mind? I mean, woof.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with her face? Sweetheart, it's electronically scrambled.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
LEADMALE:I just hope she's not toying with Jazz's emotions.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to see a sweet guy like that get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, up till today, you've never had a nice thing to say about Jazz.
LEADMALE:Up till today, Jazz was available.
OTHERFEMALE:Now that he's getting married well, forbidden fruit always looks more tempting, doesn't it? Mother, for God's sake, he's half your age.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm happy for Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:I think it is so romantic.
SUPFEMALE:I give it three weeks.
SUPMALE:The marriage or her parole? Yo, whoa, hey, that's not funny.
SUPMALE:Jazz is my best friend.
SUPFEMALE:Was.
OTHERFEMALE:Be prepared, Will.
LEADMALE:Marriage brings about new priorities.
LEADMALE:You may find Jazz has less time to spend with you once he's taken a wife.
SUPFEMALE:Please, ain't no way Jazz, knowing me, gonna let some honey come between us.
LEADFEMALE:That's what I thought too.
LEADFEMALE:When I married Vivian, I lost all my friends.
SUPFEMALE:Right, honey? But, you know But it wasn't like I was gonna need them.
LEADMALE:After all, I wasn't gonna have any fun anymore.
SUPFEMALE:Honey.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Babe Man, Uncle Phil, I knew you had a man-size appetite, but both feet? Don't worry, Daddy, I'll run damage control.
LEADMALE:Thank you, baby.
LEADMALE:Hey, well, look, I don't even care.
OTHERMALE:Jazz is in love and I'm gonna make sure that he has the best wedding ever.
OTHERFEMALE:Even if I got to pay for it myself.
LEADMALE:I mean, even though I am just a poor black man trying to get my education.
OTHERMALE:Forget it, Will.
SUPFEMALE:I am not shelling out for Jazz's wedding.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, I seem to remember a rather large relative of mine saying 
LEADFEMALE:"If Jazz would just find some bimbo to get his mind off of Hilary I'd be more than happy to pay for the wedding.
LEADFEMALE:" Well Way to go, Judge Banks.
SUPMALE:You pretend to uphold the law but you'll renege on a verbal contract? Well Well, she is a convict.
SUPMALE:I could call it a rehabilitation party and write it off.
OTHERFEMALE:Check it out, you're a judge.
LEADMALE:You can perform the ceremony.
LEADMALE:Pay yourself 25 bucks.
OTHERFEMALE:Fifty.
LEADMALE:Pay yourself 100.
LEADMALE:It's your money.
LEADMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:I finally found the man of my dreams.
OTHERFEMALE:Marry me, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Very funny, Will.
LEADMALE:But while you're playing with dolls, I'll be securing the premises.
OTHERMALE:I mean, we are gonna have a convict in the house.
LEADMALE:Jazz, would you relax, man.
LEADFEMALE:Can't help myself, Will.
LEADMALE:Not with Jewel due any minute.
SUPMALE:Oh, is she pregnant too? Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:I have the deepest respect for her, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Banks.
OTHERMALE:She's a class act.
LEADMALE:Somebody wants to know where the bride is registered.
LEADFEMALE:Gillespie Liquors.
SUPMALE:She's here.
SUPFEMALE:She's here.
LEADFEMALE:She's here.
SUPMALE:Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I also put my diamond cuff links in a balloon and swallowed them.
LEADMALE:That's more than I ever wanted to know about you, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, everybody just relax.
OTHERMALE:Well, hi there, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Man.
LEADFEMALE:You like my dress? Hilary, will you get out of my way? You're blocking my view.
LEADFEMALE:Miss Jewel Robertson.
SUPFEMALE:Jazzy!
LEADFEMALE:Munchkin! There's a lot to be said for a woman who's been in prison a long time.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Yo.
LEADFEMALE:Hello in there.
LEADMALE:Munchkin, these are the lovely people who have opened their home and their wallet to us.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm Will, the best man.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? As far as I can see, this here's the best man.
OTHERFEMALE:I love this bony butt.
LEADFEMALE:And it loves you too, my pet.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton Banks here.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose you noticed our fine collection of European autos in our driveway.
SUPMALE:I also noticed you have a very small head.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Don't mind him.
LEADMALE:We are very happy to have you in our home.
SUPMALE:Thanks, and I guess it's true what they 
SUPMALE:Can't buy good taste.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Which one is the desperately stuck-up, self-centered clothes horse? Guilty.
LEADFEMALE:Now, just a minute, young lady.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:See, the prison therapist says that I should say what's on my mind and not keep too much bottled up, otherwise I'd you know, go out and do something stupid like hotwiring a Lexus.
LEADFEMALE:Although it did get me on prime time.
OTHERFEMALE:And kept you in the hearts of viewers everywhere.
LEADMALE:I just wanna say, if you ever hurt him I'll hunt you down like the dog that you are, and kill you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, gotta go shop for your present.
SUPFEMALE:Beautiful and nuts.
LEADFEMALE:You must be very proud.
LEADFEMALE:I guess.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hey, look, I've got an idea.
OTHERMALE:Jazz, why don't you take Jewel into the kitchen and get her some grub.
LEADFEMALE:That's if tubby here hasn't eaten it all.
LEADMALE:Come in.
LEADFEMALE:Just trying on my wedding dress.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jewel, I just wanted to come and check to see if there's anything you needed.
SUPFEMALE:You know, a cup of coffee, a blood test.
LEADMALE:Actually, I thought I'd see if you could live up to your title.
LEADMALE:You know, best man.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what did you have in mind?
LEADFEMALE:Could you help me with this? It's already zipped up.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:I want you to zip it down.
LEADMALE:I don't think that's a good idea.
SUPMALE:Listen, my cousin Hilary is right down the hall.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna get her.
LEADFEMALE:Quit messing around.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, I gotta take a shower and do my hair.
LEADFEMALE:Now, hurry up.
LEADMALE:You know if somebody was to walk in here right now they might think you was hitting on me.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me, if I was hitting on you, you'd know it.
LEADFEMALE:Really? How? Okay, you made your point.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, you busy? What's on your mind, Will? Jewel kissed me.
LEADMALE:It's customary to kiss the bride.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, this was like one of them Fatal Attraction elevator-scene kisses.
OTHERMALE:You know what I'm saying? You know? Oh, come on, you're exaggerating, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, Uncle Phil, I'm telling you.
LEADFEMALE:I went up to the room to see if she needed anything.
LEADFEMALE:She kissed me on my lips.
LEADMALE:She jumped on me and she was stuck on me.
SUPMALE:And I was trying to shake her off, but I couldn't.
LEADMALE:She was like a little naked Velcro midget.
SUPFEMALE:What am I gonna do, Uncle Phil? Guess you've only got two choices.
LEADMALE:You can either tell Jazz or not.
SUPFEMALE:And you're a judge, right? Look, maybe this story will help you.
SUPMALE:You know, when I was younger, I was a pretty sexy guy.
LEADMALE:If you're not gonna take this seriously, Uncle Phil Do you wanna hear this story? Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I was driving home from a party with my buddy and his girlfriend and my buddy fell asleep.
OTHERMALE:Next thing I know, she leans across and fastens my seat belt.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm saying? Please don't do that, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, I figured that our friendship was strong enough to stand the truth.
LEADFEMALE:So we went out for a beer and I told him everything.
OTHERMALE:Well, did he thank you? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:With a bar stool, on the head.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I mean, Jazz ain't the violent type I don't think.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the point is, to be a good friend, you have to risk losing a good friend.
SUPMALE:I think I know what I gotta do.
LEADFEMALE:What's that? I gotta find somebody else to talk to about this.
SUPMALE:Hey, Jazz.
LEADMALE:How's it going, man? How's it going? This is the best day of my life.
SUPMALE:Did I thank you for everything you've done? Well, not everything.
LEADMALE:I hope you two will be close.
SUPMALE:She touched me, Will.
OTHERMALE:And I know she'll touch you too.
SUPMALE:Yeah, actually, Jazz, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
LEADFEMALE:See, listen, last night
LEADFEMALE:She told you about our decision?
LEADFEMALE:What decision?
LEADMALE:The one we made last night.
SUPFEMALE:We're gonna have 10 kids.
SUPMALE:One for every month of the year.
LEADFEMALE:But we gonna name them all after you.
SUPMALE:Jazz, hey, you ain't got to do that, man.
LEADMALE:Okay, then, we'll name them Earl.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
OTHERMALE:That's cool, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:See, me and Jewel, we got this crazy dream.
LEADMALE:We gonna keep our kids out of reform school.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, Jazz, what l
LEADMALE:See, Will I don't know how long this happiness is gonna last.
SUPMALE:If it's for just one day it's more than I've ever known before.
LEADFEMALE:So, what did you want to talk to me about? Oh, I just wanted to thank you for picking out these lovely yellow-and-green ensembles.
SUPFEMALE:You're welcome.
SUPFEMALE:Cell block 41 has arrived.
LEADMALE:Welcome, ladies.
LEADFEMALE:Please take a moment to sign our guest book.
LEADMALE:And now, if I can just have your thumb.
LEADMALE:You know, I resent being treated like a common thief.
LEADMALE:Oh, you do, do you? Well, what kind of cold-hearted, vicious, evil crime did you commit? Securities fraud.
SUPMALE:Really? An inside trader? So are you here alone? Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd all please take your seats.
LEADMALE:And I wanna thank you for attending this wonderful occasion.
LEADMALE:It's a pretty nice turnout, huh, Uncle Phil? Are you kidding? Jazz ain't got no friends.
LEADMALE:I hired these people.
SUPMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:Dearly beloved
LEADMALE:Stop the wedding! You can't marry her, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:We're not cousins, are we?
SUPMALE:Hilary, what's the meaning of this?
SUPMALE:I'm in love with him.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:What am I saying? I'm gonna go lie down.
SUPFEMALE:May I continue? We are gathered together to join this man and this woman in matrimony.
LEADFEMALE:If there's anyone who knows why they should not be together let them speak now, or forever hold their peace.
LEADFEMALE:Some friend you are.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Jazzy, we can't get married.
SUPFEMALE:Munchkin.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz.
LEADMALE:Freeze! Munchkin, please.
SUPMALE:What about all our guests? And all the gifts? I ain't never owned anything that still had the serial number on it.
OTHERMALE:Jazzy, I'm sorry, it just wouldn't work.
LEADMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:See if you could talk to her.
LEADMALE:Jazz, I can't.
OTHERFEMALE:For little Earl's sake.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, Jewel, you cannot do this to Jazz.
SUPMALE:Marry him.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you guys can just leave the state and put me behind you.
LEADMALE:Will, I can't.
SUPFEMALE:You have to.
SUPMALE:No, really, I can't, I'm on parole, I'm not allowed to leave the state.
LEADFEMALE:Damn these good looks of mine.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, now, Jewel I know it's hard, okay? But you got to look beyond this charming, sexy exterior, okay? You got to see the real Will Smith.
LEADFEMALE:I'm irresponsible, I'm unreliable, I'm immature.
LEADFEMALE:Egotistical, self-centered.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, yeah, that's it.
LEADMALE:Conceited, thick-headed, spoiled.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, that's fine.
SUPFEMALE:And on top of that, you ain't even that good-looking.
OTHERMALE:Then why you want me so bad? I don't want you.
SUPMALE:I only came on to you because I figured you'd tell Jazz and he'd call the whole thing off.
SUPFEMALE:But you couldn't even do that.
SUPMALE:I kissed you for nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Well, damn.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I've never met anybody who cares for me as much as Jazz does.
SUPMALE:You know, whenever we go to a nice restaurant, he carries my tray.
SUPMALE:And when it's time to skip out on the check he always holds open the bathroom window for me.
LEADMALE:Well, that's Jazz for you.
OTHERMALE:Can't you see? I don't deserve a man like him.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, look what he's done for me.
LEADFEMALE:Beautiful wedding gown getting married in a Bel-Air mansion.
LEADMALE:Do you know where my mama was married? No, where? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I was hoping you did.
LEADMALE:Jewel, believe me when I tell you, you and Jazz are made for each other.
LEADMALE:Listen, trust me, I've known Jazz a long time and you are the best thing to ever happen to him.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I'm scared.
OTHERMALE:What if it doesn't work out?
LEADFEMALE:It will.
SUPFEMALE:But what if it doesn't? It will.
SUPMALE:But what if it doesn't?
LEADMALE:It will! Now get in there and marry that boy.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, let's get a shot of the bridesmaids.
LEADMALE:Okay, we're back.
LEADMALE:We're back.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Bride just got a little nervous, but who wouldn't, marrying Jazz? May I continue?
LEADFEMALE:Please do.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:The bride and groom have prepared their own vows.
LEADMALE:Jazz.
LEADMALE:You're one jewel I never wanna hock.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes I wanna bite you to see if you're really real.
OTHERFEMALE:If love was craps, you'd be a seven.
SUPMALE:If it was on the first roll.
SUPFEMALE:But if it was on the second roll, and the point was six, you'd be a six.
LEADFEMALE:No, actually, you'd be a nine.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd play the field on the second roll, make a couple of extra bucks.
LEADMALE:Then you'd be a six on the third roll, and then I'd clean up.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm trying to say.
LEADFEMALE:I love you, and you make me feel lucky.
SUPFEMALE:And now, Jewel.
OTHERFEMALE:I love you, Jazzy, and I wanna be with you always.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for setting this little jailbird free body, mind and spirit.
LEADFEMALE:Baby, I love you.
LEADMALE:All right, all right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Do you, Jazz, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Do you, Jewel, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:By the powers vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
LEADFEMALE:You may kiss the bride.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Jewel.
LEADFEMALE:Jewel.
LEADMALE:Jewel.
SUPFEMALE:Jewel, get off me.
LEADMALE:Hey, Jewel.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't playing.
SUPFEMALE:Get off me, Jewel.
LEADMALE:Get off of me, Jewel.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, you made your point.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey, Will, what's going on? Lisa's coming over.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna watch a couple action-adventure flicks tonight.
OTHERMALE:Maybe if I get lucky we'll have a little action adventure of our own.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm saying? So, what movies did you rent, Casanova? Oh, we got Terminator 2, Lethal Weapon 3 and my personal favorite, Maniac Cop VII.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like a romantic evening.
LEADMALE:What's Lisa going to do? Lookie here, lookie here, Spanky.
LEADMALE:Now, I'm the man.
SUPFEMALE:You see what I'm saying? I'm the Man-dingo.
SUPFEMALE:Lisa will watch what I tell her to watch and she will enjoy it.
LEADMALE:And that, as they say, is that.
SUPFEMALE:If you'll excuse me, it's about to get X-rated in here.
SUPFEMALE:You know what I mean?
SUPMALE:Hey!
LEADMALE:Hey, baby.
LEADMALE:Hey! What's up girl? So, what movies did you get? Terms of Endearment, Fried Green Tomatoes and The Joy Luck Club.
LEADFEMALE:Shall I get us some hankies? What are you so happy about? I just made the weekend reservations at Palm Springs for me and Lisa.
SUPFEMALE:Lisa? You've been seeing a lot of her lately.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, and if it goes the way I plan I'll be seeing the rest of her this weekend, you know? Have you no shame? Yeah, I'm ashamed of you.
LEADMALE:Well, while you're wallowing in your sordid filth of a life I'll be pursuing some culture.
SUPFEMALE:I bought tickets to The Jeffersons live on stage.
SUPFEMALE:It includes dinner with Sherman Hemsley and an autograph picture of both Lionels.
SUPFEMALE:Swell.
OTHERFEMALE:That will go great with your Weezy collectible cups.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Kool-Aid! I got your Kool-Aid, all right? You look so good.
OTHERFEMALE:You are gonna be a hit at the Bahamas.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't wait to see your mother down there.
SUPFEMALE:I've been practicing my limbo.
LEADMALE:I don't know, Dad, that limbo bar gets as low as 13 inches.
LEADMALE:Wow, Carlton, you could just walk right under.
SUPFEMALE:Will's shacking up with some girl in Palm Springs.
LEADMALE:You're gonna get it now, mister.
OTHERFEMALE:Have fun.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Is that all you're gonna say to him? Am I paying for your little trip?
LEADFEMALE:Well, no.
LEADMALE:Five up top.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Master William, Miss Lisa is here to see you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sugar-wugar, now, come on, girl.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, and sir, the limbo bar is set at three feet when you're ready.
LEADMALE:Excellent.
OTHERFEMALE:He couldn't make that lying flat on his back.
OTHERMALE:Baby, now, say those words that you know send chills up my spine.
LEADMALE:I want you to meet my father.
LEADFEMALE:What you talking about, girl?
OTHERMALE:Well, baby, he and I are very close.
LEADFEMALE:And before you and I get any closer I think that you should meet him.
LEADMALE:That's cool.
OTHERMALE:I'll meet him when we come back from Palm Springs.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:I got us the Wilt Chamberlain suite.
LEADFEMALE:With the electronic scoreboard over the bed and everything.
LEADMALE:Well, before you and I get into a little one on one you're gonna have to talk to the head coach.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm saying, what if he ain't playing off the same playbook I am? Well, then we're gonna have to call a time-out.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, don't be using my analogy against me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just not gonna be comfortable going unless I know that my father approves of you.
LEADFEMALE:As if there's anything not to approve of.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, not the ears, baby.
LEADMALE:All right, I'll talk to your daddy.
LEADMALE:Keep doing that, we're gonna have to dig up his daddy, I'll talk to him too.
SUPMALE:Do you have a non-profit book by African-American photographers? You mean Songs of My People? It's a very popular book.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey, we're not non-profit.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hi, hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:How are you doing? All right.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry I'm late but after I left church, I went down and read some books to the elderly.
LEADMALE:Don't overdo it, honey.
LEADMALE:Will, this is my Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, this is Will.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:How you doing? Hear that deep voice? Like James Earl Jones.
LEADFEMALE:"This is CNN.
SUPFEMALE:" Well, I've got to get to class.
LEADMALE:I want you guys to enjoy each other.
LEADFEMALE:So how's the grub here, Wilbur? Well, we've only had two food-related deaths in the past month.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't read about that.
LEADMALE:You must be doing a good job as a manager to keep something like that quiet.
SUPFEMALE:Well, actually my cousin Carlton is the manager, you know.
LEADFEMALE:I'm pretty much just Trying to score with my daughter.
LEADFEMALE:Sir?
LEADFEMALE:It's a joke.
LEADMALE:I'm joking.
LEADMALE:I'm pulling your leg.
SUPFEMALE:You see these pictures? That's my baby.
OTHERFEMALE:There's nothing in the world I won't do for her.
SUPMALE:And I really respect that, sir.
LEADMALE:And if you don't mind me saying so, that is a lovely picture of your wife.
OTHERFEMALE:I see where Lisa gets her good looks from.
LEADFEMALE:That's not my wife.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my sister-in-law Cecilia.
SUPMALE:She's so ugly, she'd make an onion cry.
LEADMALE:Actually, I was being polite.
LEADMALE:She is a dog.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, she's so ugly, she could make a freight train take a dirt road.
SUPMALE:It'd be 
SUPMALE:You talking about my family, boy? Well, no, I just figured you You was so You know what, I like you.
LEADMALE:You do?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:But I'm out of time.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to fly to San Francisco on some business.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we just finish this interview next week.
LEADMALE:Hey, sir.
SUPMALE:You know, I actually was hoping that I could get your approval by this weekend.
LEADMALE:What's the rush? No rush.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I just hate to leave things unfinished, you know.
SUPFEMALE:I'm very meticulous like that.
OTHERMALE:"Meticulous.
SUPFEMALE:" Hey, now that's a word you don't run into every day.
LEADFEMALE:Say, why don't you fly to Frisco with me? You can help me with my vocabulary.
SUPFEMALE:Fly?
LEADMALE:You ain't scared, are you? Me, scared? Hell, no.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Wilbur, you didn't finish your Buffalo wings.
SUPFEMALE:I can't eat any more.
LEADFEMALE:Sure you can.
OTHERFEMALE:Just put some hot sauce on there.
LEADFEMALE:No, thank you.
OTHERMALE:Boy, what are you saying? You better put some Red Rooster on there.
LEADFEMALE:Look Hey, do you think you could just land the plane, you know and I'll just walk back to L.

OTHERMALE:Now, let's talk about my daughter.
OTHERMALE:Look, it's like I told you on the ground, man, you know I just like being with her.
OTHERMALE:Wrong answer.
SUPMALE:You might as well admit it, boy, you're like a squirrel trying to get a nut.
LEADMALE:Let me ask you a question.
SUPMALE:How many times did you put those rusty, crusty lips on my daughter? With all due respect, sir, I think that's between me and Lisa.
LEADFEMALE:Wrong again.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you win.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just cancel our weekend in Palm Springs.
LEADFEMALE:Why the hell would I want to go to Palm Springs with you? Not you, Lisa.
LEADFEMALE:You taking my baby girl to Palm Springs? Oh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I'm really mad now.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:The engine's dead.
LEADMALE:What? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so I guess we're going down, huh? Faster than a bucket of chicken at Oprah's.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so I should probably just confess all the nasty things I've done with your daughter, huh? Especially seeing as how in any second now we're gonna be splattering all over those mountains there.
LEADFEMALE:Let me tell you, I'm from Philly you've gotta wake up pretty early in the morning to get me with some old Mr.
SUPMALE:Adams? Mr.
LEADMALE:Adams? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Adams? I made it! I'm alive!
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it!
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it either.
SUPMALE:Your damn chute wasn't supposed to open.
OTHERFEMALE:Your plane wasn't supposed to crash neither.

OTHERMALE:Mayday.
LEADFEMALE:Mayday! This is Afro-Niner 423.

OTHERMALE:We found the plane.
LEADFEMALE:It's totaled.
LEADFEMALE:What? That's good news? See, your nephew wasn't in it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, where is he? If I knew that, I'd be working for the Psychic Friends Network.
SUPMALE:Look, that is my boyfriend and my father out there.

SUPFEMALE:Ashley, get over here.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, we've got the best in modern equipment.
SUPMALE:I'll send out a search party immediately.
LEADFEMALE:Look, a party sounds like a lot of fun, but can we please find Will first? Civilization! Two backpacks and, look! A broken radio.
LEADFEMALE:All we got to do is stay here until these guys come back.
SUPFEMALE:They are back.
LEADMALE:They are? Where? Where? This is our stuff! Oh, I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:We wasted four hours traveling around this stupid mountain.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you quit bellyaching and try to come up with some ideas of your own.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, maybe I'll just do that.
SUPMALE:Okay, okay, okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right, the sun sets in the west, right? Okay.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:And moss only grows on the north side of the trees.
LEADFEMALE:Stop spouting all that witchcraft.
SUPFEMALE:All we got to do is just stay put.
OTHERMALE:I'm sure they're out there looking for me.
LEADMALE:Not if they know you.
SUPFEMALE:You know what, boy? You've got a double order of lip.
OTHERMALE:And I got a short stack of patience.
SUPFEMALE:What the hell does that mean? Put up your hands.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna give you a good butt-whipping.
LEADMALE:Look.
LEADMALE:Please, you're like And I ain't trying to be out here fighting no old man.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, fine, that makes it easier for me.
LEADFEMALE:You all right, man? You all right?
LEADFEMALE:Old man, huh? I've got you now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, young blood.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, young blood.
LEADFEMALE:Get off me, man.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, young blood.
LEADMALE:What's that? I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:Coyote? What do they eat? One of those? What is taking so long? You have got to find my father.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:Ranger Franklin's our best tracker.
SUPFEMALE:He never comes back empty-handed.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is a tragedy.
SUPMALE:Don't worry, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure everything's gonna be okay.
LEADMALE:Okay? I'm missing The Jeffersons live on stage.
SUPFEMALE:Right now I bet George is calling somebody a jive turkey.
SUPMALE:What are you complaining about? This is hardly the way I wanted to spend my weekend.
LEADMALE:Sitting around in some dusty old shack waiting for Will to show up.
SUPMALE:Man, it's tough finding people in the woods.
LEADFEMALE:We'll try again in the morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, no hurry.
LEADMALE:Look, my nephew is a city boy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm worried he might not survive in the woods.
OTHERMALE:Oh, where's he from?
SUPMALE:West Philadelphia.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:If he can survive there a couple of snakes and bears aren't gonna bother him.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? What's it look like? I'm blowing on the embers.
SUPMALE:You're blowing the fire out, man.
SUPFEMALE:Look, relax, I got an idea.
OTHERMALE:What are you doing? Just stand back, please.
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing with my Red Rooster? Damn! And that was just the mild.
LEADMALE:Man.
LEADMALE:Look at those stars.
LEADMALE:You don't see them like that back in the city.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, too much light.
LEADFEMALE:You know, being out here in nature two guys against the elements it's like guys just naturally kind of bond with each other, you know? You come together through a tough situation.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually start to like each other.
LEADFEMALE:That ain't happening with us.
LEADFEMALE:Not even a little.
LEADFEMALE:Man, look at that moon.
LEADMALE:Hey, what you know about some jazz, boy? Oh, man, my grandma used to play Ella all the time.
SUPFEMALE:Ella, Sarah, Thelonius, Miles, Bert.
OTHERMALE:Oh, man, those were the days.
LEADFEMALE:Before the music died.
SUPMALE:Hey, yeah, you can stop there.
SUPFEMALE:The music ain't died.
SUPMALE:Now, you got Guru, Diggable Planets, A Tribe Called Quest.
OTHERMALE:The defense rests.
SUPFEMALE:No, I'm telling you, they got a nice blend of the old school with the new.
OTHERMALE:Lisa likes it.
OTHERMALE:Lisa listens to jazz? Oh, man, we listen to jazz every time when we try to get in the mood Is that Orion the Hunter? Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Will, about Lisa sometime I am a little overprotective of her.
LEADFEMALE:But she's my baby girl.
LEADFEMALE:Heck, she's all I got now that I lost my plane.
SUPFEMALE:I'm saying, I mean, I can dig that and everything.
LEADFEMALE:But don't you care what she wants?
SUPMALE:Nope.
SUPMALE:Put some more hot sauce on the fire.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go on to bed.
LEADMALE:I mean, I always found it so incredible that only I could prevent forest fires.
LEADMALE:I mean, that's so much responsibility.
LEADMALE:I really should be out there looking for your cousin.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
OTHERMALE:Will likes to sleep in.
LEADMALE:Will!
LEADMALE:Oh, thank God you're all right.
LEADMALE:The pool house wouldn't have been the same without you.
LEADMALE:Hey, thanks a lot, Carlton.
SUPMALE:There, I said it.
SUPMALE:You happy? Will, where's my father?
SUPFEMALE:Hey, it's all right, baby, he is fine.
SUPMALE:But what happened? Well, you know, we had a little engine trouble and we went down.
LEADMALE:But it was the best thing could have happened to us.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, we landed kind of in this wooded glade, you know near this bubbling brook.
SUPFEMALE:Kind of looked like the beer commercials.
OTHERFEMALE:Except there wasn't no naked honeys.
SUPFEMALE:There wasn't no beer.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but you know what? I don't know if it was the beauty of the area or just being outdoors, but we kind of bonded.
SUPFEMALE:Why didn't he come back with you? Look, I could not tear him away.
SUPFEMALE:I told him we could walk down this brook, take us back to civilization.
LEADFEMALE:But he said, "No, you go on without me I wanna stay here and be at one with nature.
SUPFEMALE:" You can't be at one when you two.
LEADFEMALE:So I jetted.
SUPFEMALE:Really? You know what? I'm telling you, your father is a changed man.
LEADFEMALE:He said we should go to Palm Springs and enjoy ourselves.
LEADMALE:You mean he actually said that we could go? He insisted.
SUPMALE:Now that you're safe, I can still catch my flight to the Bahamas.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, everybody, let's go, we're out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's that boy with that firewood? Wilbur! Outside is a trail of hot sauce.
LEADFEMALE:Light a match, take you right to him.
OTHERMALE:Wilbur! Robin Hood, are you around here? Anybody! Red Rooster? Anybody, give me a hand.
LEADMALE:Squirrel! I need Give me a piece of cheese, I'm hungry.
SUPMALE:Little Red Riding Hood, where are you? Wilbur! Hey! They leaving me out here by myself.
SUPMALE:I'm scared.
LEADMALE:We need some more people, come on in.
OTHERFEMALE:The Three Bears, where are you?
LEADFEMALE:Help me, somebody.
LEADMALE:John.
SUPMALE:The show's over.
OTHERMALE:Help me, please.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you?
SUPMALE:John.
OTHERFEMALE:You can stay out here if you want.
OTHERFEMALE:Wilbur! What the hell happened to everything? 
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:What's up, man?
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what you looking at? Just some pictures of me and Janice Robertson from back in the day.
LEADMALE:Here we are on campus running from the National Guard.
LEADMALE:Man, she is fine! Tell me about it.
LEADMALE:And you're sure that Aunt Viv is cool with your ex-girlfriend coming to visit, huh? Oh well, actually, Janice was never officially my girlfriend.
SUPMALE:Not that I didn't try.
LEADMALE:Man, oh, man, did I try.
LEADFEMALE:Flowers, poems, dinners.
SUPMALE:I must have sprung for over 50 of them.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe it would have worked if you had taken her too.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, it was just a little collegiate humor.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God.
LEADFEMALE:You know what it's like to really go after a woman and never get her? No.
LEADFEMALE:Finally, after two years I realized that Janice wasn't gonna have me, so I settled for Vivian.
LEADMALE:With Vivian.
SUPFEMALE:With Vivian! Sweetheart, that came out wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Honey! Honey? Baby.
OTHERMALE:Geoffrey, prepare Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks' couch.
LEADMALE:So, what time is Dad's old flame supposed to be here? Carlton, she's not Daddy's old flame.
OTHERFEMALE:They weren't even intimate.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil discussed that with you? No, I heard him say it in the hall after Mom slammed the door in his face.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, where's my purple tie? It's in your tie drawer next to the Pringles.
LEADMALE:Least that's better than the Kit Kat he keep with his drawers.
LEADFEMALE:I have the greatest news.
LEADMALE:You know Al Riggins the talk-show host?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, he's in a coma and they want me to test as his replacement.
SUPFEMALE:My horoscope was right.
OTHERMALE:This is my lucky day.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary, aren't you even a little concerned? Oh, I'm plenty concerned.
SUPFEMALE:My competition is anchorwoman Mara Lopez.
LEADMALE:And you know how they favor those minority people.
LEADMALE:Maybe science can just come get her brain now.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, I need your help in the kitchen.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, will you set an extra place at the table.
SUPMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks' friend is bringing her daughter.
LEADMALE:Aunt Viv, I'm just curious.
LEADMALE:Would this daughter be more of a playmate for baby Nicky, Ashley, or none of the above?
SUPMALE:She's 18.
LEADMALE:Good answer.
OTHERMALE:Men.
SUPMALE:Hey, G, I gotta tell you, man.
SUPMALE:If this girl is built anything like her mother I might have to check the premises, you know what I'm saying? I might have to go see what the foundation is like, know what I mean? Hold your permit, mister.
SUPFEMALE:What makes you think the daughter's gonna opt for you when she can have me? Well, number one, because I don't be saying stuff like "opt.
LEADFEMALE:" Number two, because Geoffrey still has to cut up your food.
LEADMALE:Well, this hundred dollars says that she goes out with me first.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, here's 50.
SUPMALE:And another 50.
OTHERFEMALE:You're on and may the best man 
OTHERFEMALE:Me.
LEADFEMALE:Might I get in on this? Sure things don't come along every day.
OTHERMALE:On Master William.
LEADMALE:Why would you pick him? With all due respect, young sir I've seen you in action with women, and quite frankly, you're an idiot.
SUPFEMALE:Fine, I got you both covered.
LEADMALE:So how do I look? Like a man asking for trouble.
SUPMALE:Oh, nonsense.
LEADMALE:Vivian and I had a long talk about this yesterday.
LEADMALE:She is perfectly secure with Janice's coming to visit.
SUPFEMALE:So, what happened to your nose, bro? Oh, this?
SUPFEMALE:This?
SUPFEMALE:Well, l I cut myself shaving.
LEADMALE:Oh, you were shaving your nose? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Was that before or after you poured that bucket of cologne on your head? You are reading way too much into this, Will.
SUPMALE:This is just a little dinner with an old friend.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's her.
LEADFEMALE:Mrs.
SUPMALE:Robertson and her daughter, Wendy.
LEADFEMALE:Damn!
LEADFEMALE:Damn! When my editor decided to do a story on post-earthquake syndrome I jumped at the chance.
LEADMALE:I haven't seen Philip since the Princeton 10-year reunion.
LEADFEMALE:Remember, we took over the registrar's office in '69? Do I? My eyes are still burning from the tear gas.
LEADFEMALE:Wendy, your mother looked radiant even in a gas mask.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Phil, please stop.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, Phil, please stop.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
OTHERFEMALE:So I'm at an anti-war rally getting ready to burn my draft card and Janice offers me a light.
SUPMALE:I am so against war.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, there's death and destruction and they preempt your favorite programs.
LEADFEMALE:I remember during Desert Storm, trying to find Knots Landing Are those prunes? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:I have this theory about regularity.
OTHERFEMALE:Perhaps after dinner we can go for a drive and talk about it in depth.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, G, get down for another hundred.
OTHERMALE:I was thinking maybe we could take a walk on the beach find a little club, get our boogie on.
LEADMALE:Oh, I love to dance.
SUPMALE:Hey, I can dance better than Will any day.
LEADFEMALE:Don't keep her out too late, Will.
LEADMALE:She's in good hands, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Robertson.
LEADFEMALE:I know she is.
LEADFEMALE:I said I'll pay you when I get out! I had a great time, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Where'd you learn to dance like that? Oh, the Arthur Murray Dance Studios.
LEADFEMALE:Tango?
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:So, what's up for tomorrow? I'm seeing you again, I hope.
LEADMALE:Who am I to crush a young woman's dreams? Too bad your mom's in there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we have separate rooms.
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, where were we? Will, I like you, but this is going a little too fast for me.

SUPFEMALE:You know, then Then I heard all this crying.
LEADFEMALE:Was that baby Nicky? No, no, baby Carlton.
SUPMALE:He's not the most mature young man, is he? Well, he's kind of like a 10-year-old trapped in a 12-year-old's body.
LEADMALE:Well, good night.
LEADMALE:But we've barely scratched the surface.
LEADFEMALE:Listen Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Robertson, I have to be honest.
SUPFEMALE:I'm I'm, you know not really feeling right about being here with you in, you know that That thing.
LEADFEMALE:Is there a problem? Well, yeah, I mean when a woman changes into something more comfortable it usually means she wanna get more comfortable, you know.
LEADFEMALE:And frankly, I'm a little uncomfortable with this higher level of comfort.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, I've put on a couple of pounds, and my dress was too tight.
OTHERFEMALE:There, you happy? I'm so sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was completely out of line.

LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Will?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! Uncle Phil!
SUPFEMALE:What are you doing sleeping out here?
SUPMALE:Vivian thought the couch was too good for me.
LEADMALE:You just getting in? Just because a guy comes in in the morning wearing the same thing he had on the night before that doesn't mean he slept with anybody.
LEADMALE:Take it easy, I'm not accusing you of anything.
LEADMALE:Maybe we parked and watched the sun come up.
OTHERMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Or maybe we sat in the lobby and we talked all night! People do do that, you know! I said I believe you! Good! Because l I ain't do nothing wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Did you get to spend any time with Wendy's mother? No, no, no.
LEADMALE:They was in two separate rooms, and I wasn't in either one.
SUPFEMALE:Before she leaves, try to spend time with her.
SUPFEMALE:She has a lot to offer.
SUPFEMALE:More than you know.
LEADMALE:What?
SUPMALE:I said I gotta go.
LEADMALE:Well, well, well.
OTHERMALE:And where have you been all night, mister? I'm sorry, I only answer to people over 5 feet.
LEADMALE:You're over 5 feet, aren't you? Oh, boy.
OTHERFEMALE:That was a lot of fun.
LEADFEMALE:I sure love those old movies.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Cleopatra Jones, the superbad sister.
SUPFEMALE:Who do you think would win in a street fight? Cleopatra Jones or Grace Jones? Oh, see, now you're getting philosophical on me now, see.
LEADFEMALE:See, now, Cleopatra Jones, see, she got that karate stuff, right? She got some sweet moves on her.
LEADFEMALE:Plus, she be packing heat.
SUPMALE:But Grace Jones, she just scary.
LEADFEMALE:You've really been thinking about this.
LEADFEMALE:Yup.
SUPMALE:Something else I've been thinking about too.
SUPMALE:Am I intruding on anything? Hey, Mrs.
SUPMALE:Robertson, hey.
SUPMALE:What you doing here? Well, your uncle invited me over for a little backyard barbecue.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, yeah.
SUPMALE:We was about to go get our eat on too.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Wendy, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I love barbecue.
LEADMALE:Help yourself, honey.
LEADMALE:There's plenty of food.
LEADMALE:Stop playing.
LEADFEMALE:Well I think I'm gonna go get me some ribs, you know because, you know, my Uncle Phil likes to eat while he cooks and might not be nothing left for nobody else, you know what I'm saying? Well, Will, I didn't expect to see you again so soon.
SUPMALE:Listen, maybe I fell for you last night.
LEADFEMALE:But I ain't never falling for you again.
LEADFEMALE:Relax, Will, you think I want my daughter to find out? How would it make me look? Crazy.
LEADMALE:Boy, Wendy deserves a lot better than Will.
LEADFEMALE:When I think how we conned her into going out with him, it makes me sick.
SUPFEMALE:At least I had some respect for her.
LEADMALE:Carlton, you bet 200 dollars on her.
LEADMALE:Hey, that's a very respectable bet.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, the secret to a successful cookout is flame control.
LEADMALE:Remember the last barbecue we were at? We were on the Jersey Shore protesting that toxic dump.
SUPMALE:Oh, is that why that chicken tasted so funny? We formed a human chain and kept the trucks out.
SUPMALE:Oh, remember? Of course I remember.
LEADFEMALE:You were wearing that calico halter-top.
SUPMALE:You know, I still have that halter-top.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, the fire's getting a little too hot.
LEADFEMALE:There, that's better.
LEADMALE:Vivian, that was extremely childish.
LEADFEMALE:Childish? You are the one who is gawking over this woman in our own backyard.
LEADFEMALE:She is an old friend.
LEADFEMALE:You cannot fault me for being friendly.
SUPFEMALE:Saint Bernards are friendly.
OTHERMALE:But even they don't slobber as much as you.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian, this is such a beautiful home.
LEADMALE:You are a very lucky woman.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me, I have to go check on our baby.
LEADMALE:Something I said? No, Vivian is just a little uncomfortable with our friendship even though I told her nothing ever happened between us.
LEADFEMALE:You know, that was one of my biggest regrets.
LEADMALE:Really? I guess back then I just didn't appreciate the kind of man you are.
OTHERMALE:I would like to take you out to dinner tomorrow.
LEADMALE:You know, we go back to New York the next day.
SUPMALE:Oh, well Well, I appreciate that, but Vivian's busy tomorrow night.
SUPMALE:Well then, how about just the two of us? Oh, no, I don't think so.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it'll be more business, you know, than pleasure.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I need more insight on my article.
LEADFEMALE:I guess there's no harm in that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
OTHERFEMALE:Say 8:00 tomorrow? My hotel? Dinner? Sounds fine.
LEADMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, hey.
LEADMALE:Listen, can l? Can I talk to you in the kitchen for a second? Will, I am cooking.

LEADMALE:Can't you see? Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Janice is the one that got away, right? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, she ain't get away from me.
LEADFEMALE:What? Uncle Phil, I was dropping Wendy off back at the hotel, right? Then I'm walking down the hall, and Mrs.
LEADMALE:Robertson comes up and she asking me about the quake, so I'm telling her and then she slips into something more comfortable.
LEADFEMALE:Then she grab these pictures, she's showing pictures of San San-something, and then, you know, before I knew it, you 
SUPMALE:You slept with Janice! Ashley, go to your room.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I love this! And take Carlton with you.

LEADMALE:But
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, go blame it on me! Janice, I think you'd better leave.
SUPFEMALE:Vivian, this is not as big as you're making it out to be.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe not in your little world.
SUPMALE:Too bad, Philip.
LEADFEMALE:We could have had something special.
SUPMALE:I have something special.
LEADMALE:Bye, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Robertson.
LEADMALE:I have been such a fool.
LEADFEMALE:Can you forgive me? I always do, don't I? You don't have to sleep on the chaise lounge tonight.
LEADMALE:I don't? You can sleep on your couch.

LEADMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, man, look.
LEADMALE:I'm 19 years old, and I'm gonna make some mistakes.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I'm 45 and I make them too.
LEADMALE:The secret is to learn from them.

OTHERMALE:Al, Al, Al! Doesn't anybody care about my needs? Do you have any idea how much this outfit cost? And the statute's not up yet on that sexual harassment case.
SUPFEMALE:You wouldn't dare.
LEADMALE:Don't think I won't.
SUPFEMALE:I'll drag you through the mud.
SUPMALE:I went through so much to do this!
LEADMALE:Think because you got a pretty face
OTHERMALE:I caught up on everything! you can talk to me like this!

LEADMALE:Well, you won't get away with it! 
OTHERFEMALE:

SUPFEMALE:Come on, you ain't got to do that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, I do.
LEADMALE:I'm really hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, baby, baby, I can have some Rotiserie Gold here in six minutes.
LEADMALE:Well, you've done it again, haven't you? Done what, Jazzy? Munchkin, perhaps our visit is a little ill-timed.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, me and Jewel could sleep out on a park bench.
LEADMALE:I hear rain is nature's moisturizer.
LEADFEMALE:Well, look, y'all might as well just stay.
SUPMALE:You done messed everything up already anyway.
SUPMALE:Thanks for hanging up.
LEADMALE:I got thrown out of the restaurant and got a ticket for driving without a license.
OTHERFEMALE:What are they doing here? Jazz's apartment is getting repainted.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, like I care.
LEADMALE:I'm going to my room, putting on my jammies and calling it a D-A-Y.
OTHERFEMALE:Either his head's getting smaller or his butt's getting bigger.
LEADMALE:There's a whole army of these action figures around my bed.
LEADFEMALE:They're fertility gods, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
OTHERMALE:Y'all trying to have a baby? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Just because we're away from the marital bed don't mean we ain't 
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, whoa, whoa, guys.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen.
LEADMALE:I'm all for this being fruitful and multiplying thing but it's kind of close quarters here so you think y'all can put a boom-shaka-lock on it for a minute? I'd like to accommodate you, my brother, but we're on a mission.
SUPMALE:Not on my Posturepedic, bud.
OTHERMALE:Excuse us for a second.
LEADMALE:Listen, Jazz, man, look.
SUPMALE:I'm happy for you and your wife, but you think this mission could get scrubbed for a minute until your rocket is back on its launching pad? No can do, Will.
LEADMALE:The doctor at the clinic says this is when I'm at my most fertile which reminds me, sweetie.
SUPMALE:I took my temperature, all systems go.
LEADFEMALE:Permission to board the mother ship.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, you don't.
LEADMALE:There'll be no boarding of any kind, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:And Mrs What the heck is your last name anyway? Hey, that's my bed.
SUPMALE:Carlton, relax, I'll get you some new Barney sheets.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot believe they're at it again.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, they are not human.
SUPMALE:Hey, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:This ain't funny, man.
OTHERMALE:I command you to stop.
OTHERFEMALE:Roll away from the woman.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't take this anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna go sleep with Mom and Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Careful Uncle Phil doesn't roll over on you again.
SUPMALE:Well, the little darling's fast asleep.
LEADMALE:Are you sure you didn't kill her? I realize what a inconvenience we've been.
SUPFEMALE:But since you ain't getting us no wedding present, this is the least you could do.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about, man? I gave you a wedding.
OTHERFEMALE:Take that to the bank.
SUPMALE:Look, Will, making a baby is a truly blessed event.
LEADFEMALE:I think you mean "having a baby," Jazz.
SUPMALE:Trust me on this.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Will, my Jewel's fondest dream is to have a child of her own.
LEADMALE:I love her.
SUPFEMALE:She's my delicate little flower.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, crank it up! Hey, take it easy in there, we're not insured.
SUPMALE:Well, I don't think it's a very good idea for Jazz and Jewel to reproduce.
SUPFEMALE:Right, big guy.
LEADMALE:The prisons are crowded enough.
SUPMALE:That's not fair.
OTHERMALE:If Jazz and Jewel wanna bring a child into this world who are we to judge? We're not exactly perfect.
LEADMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:So have you kids shopped for Mother's Day? I'm afraid I haven't had a chance to buy their gifts.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get to the mall after lunch.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey is picking out your presents? Of course not, big guy.
LEADMALE:We told him exactly what to get.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:Down to the very last detail, sir.
OTHERMALE:Let's see, there's " some kind of perfume or something," from Miss Hilary.
LEADMALE:"A book might be neat," from Miss Ashley.
LEADMALE:And, " here's 20 bucks and I expect some change back" from Master Carlton.
SUPMALE:I can't believe you kids.
LEADMALE:How will your mother feel when she finds out you didn't do your own shopping? Oh, I have no problem with my own shopping.
SUPMALE:I got my Mom something she gonna love.
LEADFEMALE:She always wanted to get my baby shoes bronzed, but she never got around to it.
SUPFEMALE:So I hooked her up.
OTHERFEMALE:Those are your baby shoes? Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:I had big feet.
LEADFEMALE:You know what they say about a guy with big feet.
LEADFEMALE:No, what? They be saying, "Damn, you got some big feet.
LEADMALE:" Well As much as it pains me to admit it Will's got the right idea.
LEADFEMALE:This year, I want you to pick out something handpicked personal and from the heart.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you go out there and shop.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's right.
LEADMALE:Feel ashamed of your sorry selves.
SUPMALE:You feel ashamed of your sorry selves.
LEADFEMALE:Eloquent, sirs.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:Makes me wanna do something special for Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Banks myself.
SUPMALE:So you don't want me to get the usual dozen roses? No, that's good enough.
SUPMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm surprised y'all can walk.
SUPFEMALE:Your levity is inappropriate.
OTHERMALE:We've been at the free clinic all morning to find out why my oven is as yet bunless.
SUPFEMALE:Y'all haven't been baking long.
SUPMALE:Hey, and I'm sure, if you stick with that recipe you'll get the ingredients mixed up How can you think about food at a time like this? I mean, we ain't never gonna have a baby because my little soldiers ain't marching.
LEADFEMALE:Bummer.
LEADMALE:Jazz, didn't I tell you to not be wearing them bikini drawers? You told me not to wear them in the streets.
LEADMALE:You ain't tell me not to wear them.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? It's probably just stress.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm sure that's what it is, man.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, y'all just got married, and you're always running from the law.
LEADFEMALE:And you know what? Why don't you go to another free clinic, get a second opinion.
LEADMALE:We can't afford another free clinic.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, look.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really sorry for you, man.
LEADMALE:I mean, hey, at least y'all tried.
LEADFEMALE:Never heard two people try harder.
SUPFEMALE:Don't try to comfort me, Will.
LEADMALE:I'm uncomfortable.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, Jewel.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:If there's anything I can do
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, there is.
OTHERFEMALE:Whatever it is, just let me know.
LEADFEMALE:You really mean that, Will?
LEADMALE:Name it.
SUPMALE:I want your little soldiers.
LEADMALE:What do you say? Can I have your baby? I'd really appreciate it.
LEADMALE:Jewel, come on.
LEADMALE:You are my best friend's wife.
OTHERFEMALE:As much as that excites me, I think I better pass.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want your body, Will.
LEADMALE:I want your little soldiers.
LEADFEMALE:Do I look like the U.
LEADFEMALE:N? Jewel, if Jazz ever found out about this, it would kill him.
LEADFEMALE:So you in? You know about this? Know about it? It was my idea.
OTHERMALE:What are y'all asking me to do? Hey, look.
SUPMALE:How about I give y'all something else, like a VCR? You hear that, munchkin? He's giving us a VCR too.
LEADMALE:He's so full of love.
OTHERMALE:Let's hope so.
OTHERMALE:Come on, having a baby is a big responsibility.
LEADMALE:We're ready for it.
OTHERFEMALE:Why, I even started saving for little Junior's college fund.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I don't think I can do this.
LEADFEMALE:Sure you can.
SUPFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:Remember that time we went to go play ball and your shoelace broke and I gave you mine? Same thing.
LEADMALE:Jazz, man.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you have some relatives or something? Why me? I mean, you got a good heart.
LEADMALE:And you got a lot of smarts and you're tall, and you got good teeth.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, we'll be praying he gets my ears.
SUPMALE:We really want this baby, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we love him already.
LEADMALE:And we love you too.
SUPFEMALE:And there's no one else we'd ask to be a part of our family.
LEADMALE:How about a toaster? Kids, I don't know how to thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Such thoughtful gifts.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you deserve them, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:And these roses they are exquisite.
SUPMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADMALE:You're welcome.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, it's the thought that counts.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, so think about sleeping on the couch for a while.
SUPMALE:Mother, I wanted to buy you the perfect gift.
OTHERFEMALE:Something that would show you just how special you are.
LEADMALE:But I couldn't find it, so I made it myself.
SUPMALE:You made something? Hilary, you can't even make change.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, you can't even make Oh, shut up.

LEADMALE:Did you bring me anything?
SUPFEMALE:Carlton? My goodness, haven't seen you since you were 3 years old.
LEADMALE:I guess we all have a lot of catching up to do.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see, where do I begin? Well, when I was 6, we all moved from the hood And here I am today.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Hey, you want some more coffee or something? That would be nice.
LEADFEMALE:When did you get so tall? Mostly during the '80s.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:So how'd you find me? Well, I I talked to your mother three months ago.
LEADFEMALE:I guess she didn't mention it to you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, anyway, I was driving through L.
SUPFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:On business I'm a trucker now.
SUPMALE:Got my own rig and everything.
LEADFEMALE:So I thought I'd stop by and see how my boy was doing.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm doing fine.
SUPMALE:I'm busy, though.
LEADMALE:I got a lot of work and stuff I need to do.
LEADMALE:I understand, I understand.
LEADFEMALE:You take care of yourself.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You too, all right? Whoa, hold up.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you wanna stop by the crib later and have some dinner? Oh, well, I know you're living with Philip and Vivian.
OTHERMALE:I don't think I'd be too welcome.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? No, they'll be cool.
LEADMALE:So look, I get off at 6.
LEADFEMALE:It's great.
OTHERMALE:I'll pick you up then, son.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Good to see you again, Uncle Lou.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, 14 years.
LEADFEMALE:You must feel like you're on a roller coaster of emotions.
LEADMALE:Hey, man, that ain't no big thing.
SUPMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:Look, I'm here for you, my brother.
OTHERMALE:Let me hold you.
SUPMALE:Hey, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:Hi, Will.
LEADMALE:Hi, Lou.
LEADFEMALE:My God.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian.
LEADMALE:After all these years.
LEADMALE:Still a stone cold fox.
LEADMALE:Will, you should have told me.
SUPFEMALE:You really should have told me.
OTHERMALE:I asked Geoffrey to tell you.
OTHERMALE:I thought it might be more fun this way.
LEADFEMALE:And I was right.
LEADMALE:G, I'd like you to meet Lou Smith.
SUPFEMALE:Show Lou to the family room, please, while Will helps me here with something.
LEADMALE:This way, sir.
LEADMALE:How are you doing? No, I'm cool, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:I stopped on the way home.
LEADFEMALE:I had a few drinks.
LEADFEMALE:I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
SUPFEMALE:I'm fine, I'm fine.
LEADMALE:You think that Uncle Phil is gonna be cool with this?
LEADFEMALE:I think so.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:If I can stop him from coming home.
SUPMALE:Who is this beautiful woman? She's Hilary.
SUPMALE:Hilary, this is
SUPFEMALE:I'm Will's father.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Will's father is a deadbeat who left him and his mom flat.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Uncle Lou! Well, let's just sit down and have a nice, quick visit.
SUPMALE:Vivian.
LEADMALE:Oh, that was fun.
LEADMALE:Why is there a truck parked in my? What are you doing here? Philip, can I see you in the kitchen, please?
SUPMALE:I should go.
LEADFEMALE:Don't be silly.
SUPFEMALE:Who knows if we'd ever see you again? Come on.
LEADMALE:I must be an old man, because little Ashley's all grown up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Ashley this is your Uncle Lou.
SUPFEMALE:Uncle Lou?
SUPFEMALE:You mean he's your
OTHERMALE:Yeah, that's right.
OTHERFEMALE:He's my Lou.
LEADFEMALE:And this must be little Nicky.
LEADMALE:May I?
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Will, I used to hold you just like this.
LEADMALE:Then why'd you run out on him? Well, Lou.
LEADFEMALE:It's been a while.
SUPFEMALE:How long are you in town for? A couple of days.
SUPMALE:On some business.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, Uncle Phil, he owns his own trucking company now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, one truck.
LEADFEMALE:But I am my own boss.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm making a little money.
LEADFEMALE:Why didn't you send any back to the wife and child you abandoned?
SUPMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, man.
LEADFEMALE:You promised.
LEADMALE:Look, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll skip dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have much of an appetite.
SUPMALE:Shall I call 911? I ain't scared of no kiddie roller coaster ride.
LEADFEMALE:Please, you was up there screaming so loud I thought I was sitting next to Patti LaBelle.
LEADMALE:Will, I owe you an explanation.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I do.
SUPFEMALE:You see the day you were born was the happiest day of my life.
LEADFEMALE:The first time I held you I didn't think I'd ever put you down.
SUPMALE:So why did you? I just wasn't ready to be a father.
OTHERMALE:I started feeling trapped.
LEADFEMALE:Well, one day I just panicked and ran.
OTHERMALE:It was selfish and cowardly but that's what I did.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Look, why are you telling me this now? Because you're my son and I love you.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm a different man now.
LEADMALE:I'm ready to be part of your life, if you'll let me.
LEADFEMALE:Part of my life.
LEADFEMALE:How?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, for one, we can get to know one another.
SUPMALE:And did you know your old man was All City point guard?
OTHERFEMALE:Really?
LEADMALE:Yeah, man.
LEADFEMALE:I still hold the record for the most consecutive foul shots.
LEADFEMALE:You don't believe me?
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say nothing.
SUPFEMALE:No, I see you don't believe me.
LEADMALE:Hey, come here.
SUPMALE:Come here.
LEADMALE:Don't let this height fool you, you hear?
OTHERMALE:I didn't say nothing.
LEADMALE:No, you didn't have to say nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Don't hurt yourself now.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want to take you back broke.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Anybody can make one.
LEADMALE:They have little girls out here that can make one.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, two ain't nothing either.
LEADFEMALE:He's really good.
LEADFEMALE:He's my dad.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:He's good.
LEADFEMALE:All right, give me that ball.
LEADMALE:Listen, Vy, I told you last night, we're keeping a close eye on Will.
LEADFEMALE:He's doing fine.
LEADMALE:Everything is What? Yeah, Lou still looks great.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:He does.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:He's puffed up like a blowfish and bald as an egg.
LEADMALE:Were your ears burning, sir?
SUPFEMALE:We're back.
LEADMALE:I have to go.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Did you have a good time? We rode every roller coaster in the park.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, almost threw up like three times.
LEADFEMALE:That's my boy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm glad you two got to spend some time together.
LEADFEMALE:We just getting started, right, Daddy?
LEADMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? My dad has to hit the road tomorrow.
SUPMALE:And I'm gonna go with him.
LEADMALE:Why should I spend my summer wasting at the Peacock when I can hit the road with my dad? Hey, watch yourself, watch yourself.
LEADFEMALE:It's a great way for Will to see the country.
SUPFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:Come on, Phil.
LEADMALE:The boy could use a little adventure.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, but this is a family discussion.
LEADMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:It's okay.
LEADMALE:I'll wait in the pool house.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, that is not cool, the way you dissing my father like that.
LEADFEMALE:The hell with your father.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, for God's sake.
SUPMALE:He waltzes in here after 15 years?
LEADMALE:Fourteen.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, 14 years.
LEADFEMALE:And acts like nothing has happened.
OTHERMALE:Wake up, Will.
LEADFEMALE:This is the same guy who didn't think enough of you to pick up the phone.
SUPFEMALE:He made a mistake.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry that everybody can't be as perfect as you, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:But if I can forgive him, how come you can't? Because he's doing this for himself.
OTHERFEMALE:If you think any differently, then you're a fool.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, just cool it.
SUPFEMALE:Just cool down.
SUPMALE:We can talk about this another time.
LEADMALE:You know what, Aunt Viv ain't even nothing to talk about.
LEADMALE:I've been waiting for this for a long time, my whole life and ain't nobody gonna stop me.
LEADMALE:Come tomorrow, I'm out of here.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:Who cares what you think? You are not my father! You know, sir whenever I'm feeling blue I think of the poem my dear mum used to recite to me as a lad.
LEADFEMALE:The master lives a life of ease While we live life upon our knees Waste not your tears And save your breath For soon he'll die a violent death Works for me.
SUPMALE:Daddy, I had a little accident at the mall.
SUPFEMALE:I'm okay.
LEADMALE:But I totaled your MasterCard.
SUPFEMALE:That's okay, honey.
SUPMALE:Everybody makes mistakes.
LEADMALE:Here, pick a card.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'll just take this pretty gold one.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Daddy.
LEADMALE:What's with him?
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
OTHERMALE:He's like a genie on Valium.
SUPMALE:Make a wish, hurry.
LEADMALE:Daddy, there's a dance next Friday, but it's not over till midnight.
SUPMALE:That's okay, stay out as late as you wish.
SUPFEMALE:Really?
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, can l?
LEADFEMALE:Hey, save some for me.
LEADMALE:Say, big guy
SUPMALE:Carlton am I a good father?
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? You're the best.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you, son.
SUPMALE:Can I have access to my trust fund?
LEADMALE:Not a chance.
LEADFEMALE:I hate you! Oh, yeah? Well, take a number.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes Mr.
LEADMALE:Sunshine.
SUPFEMALE:Shut up, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, stop moping.
OTHERMALE:You know Will didn't mean what he said.
LEADFEMALE:Well, why'd he say it? For four years, I treated that boy like my own son.
OTHERMALE:Whether he needed a pat on the head or a kick in the pants, I was there for him.
SUPMALE:I worked my ass off trying to keep him in line.
SUPMALE:And yet, it's come back with a vengeance.
OTHERMALE:I have done everything for Will.
LEADFEMALE:Suddenly, it's like none of that matters.
SUPMALE:I can't believe he could be so selfish.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, listen to yourself.
OTHERFEMALE:Somebody's being selfish all right, but it isn't Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, do you mind if I move your things around while you're gone? No, it's cool.
LEADFEMALE:Knock yourself out, man.
SUPMALE:You know, Carlton, up until a few days ago I never even thought I'd see my father again.
LEADFEMALE:It was like I couldn't even think about it because I knew it wasn't gonna happen.
LEADFEMALE:But I still managed to keep the fantasy.
LEADMALE:Now it's real.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe how lucky I am.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, it's a miracle.
OTHERMALE:Hold the tape measure.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, I'm only going for the summer, man.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Can I speak to Will alone, please? You're not gonna talk him into staying?
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
OTHERMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Look Uncle Phil, I owe you an apology.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, I'm the one.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I guess we both said some things we didn't mean.
OTHERMALE:No, I meant what I said.
LEADMALE:I was just out of line.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, man, you know I appreciate everything you've done for me.
LEADFEMALE:But this ain't about you.
LEADMALE:This is something I gotta do for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADMALE:I know, son.
SUPMALE:And I wish you the best.
LEADFEMALE:Good luck.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll miss you.
OTHERMALE:Me too, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you know that this is just for the summer, right? Where's Lou? He's supposed to be here an hour ago.
LEADMALE:I knew this was gonna happen.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe he got stuck in traffic.
LEADMALE:Yeah, on his way out of town.
SUPMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Smith has arrived.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, I'm late.
SUPMALE:Business.
LEADFEMALE:I talked to this guy who's got this shipment.
OTHERFEMALE:Gotta go from L.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:To Maine in 72 hours if I can make it.
LEADFEMALE:And I can make it because I am the best.
LEADMALE:And I'll make myself a quick five grand.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:That's terrific.
LEADMALE:You and Will better get a move on.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now, that's the problem.
LEADFEMALE:As good as I am, I can't make the deadline by myself.
LEADFEMALE:So I'm gonna pick up an extra driver.
LEADFEMALE:So there won't be any room for Will.
LEADMALE:Not this trip, no.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, I'll tell you what, Lou.
OTHERMALE:I'll buy Will a plane ticket to Maine and that way you could hook up and have the summer together.
LEADFEMALE:That's mighty generous of you, Philip but this job could lead to another big one and I gotta stay flexible, you know what I'm saying? Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know what you're saying.
LEADFEMALE:Will is gonna be crushed.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:That's why I was thinking maybe you two should break the news to him.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, would you take Nicky upstairs, please? You're not gonna hit him, are you? Because I don't wanna miss that.
LEADFEMALE:No, I'm not gonna hit him.
LEADMALE:Lou, if you walk out of Will's life now don't you ever come back.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:I ain't got time for no lecture.
LEADMALE:I said, sit down, Lou.
LEADMALE:You know, Will was doing just fine till you showed up.
LEADFEMALE:But now that you're back, you have responsibilities to him.
LEADMALE:Look, we're still gonna take the trip.
LEADMALE:Oh, bull! Bull.
LEADFEMALE:Will is not a coat that you hang in the closet then pick it up when you're ready to wear it.
OTHERMALE:His life goes on.
SUPFEMALE:He's not supposed to be here for you.
LEADMALE:You're supposed to be here for him.
LEADFEMALE:You get off my back! You think I want this? It just happened.
SUPMALE:Now, when Will was a baby, I was scared Cut the crap, all right? Cut it.
LEADFEMALE:Because I've been there.
LEADFEMALE:But I didn't run out on my family.
SUPFEMALE:I was there every day for them.
SUPFEMALE:Because that's what a man does.
LEADMALE:Fine, Philip.
SUPFEMALE:You win.
LEADMALE:You the man.
OTHERFEMALE:You a better man than me.
LEADFEMALE:You happy? Now you gonna tell Will or not? I'm not gonna do your dirty work for you.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call him.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I'll do that.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy-O.
LEADMALE:What's up? Will.
LEADMALE:Man, I'm glad you're here.
SUPMALE:Some business came up I gotta handle.
LEADMALE:So we're gonna have to put our trip on hold.
LEADFEMALE:You understand? Yeah, that's cool.
SUPMALE:Just for a couple of weeks.
SUPFEMALE:I understand.
LEADMALE:Maybe a little longer.
SUPMALE:Yeah, whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
SUPMALE:Look, I'll call you next week and we'll iron out the details.
LEADMALE:Okay?
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:It was great seeing you, son.
SUPFEMALE:You too, Lou.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, this works out better for me.
SUPFEMALE:The slimmies this summer come to class wearing next to nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Will, it's all right to be angry.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, why should I be mad? At least he said goodbye this time.
LEADMALE:I just wish I hadn't wasted my money buying this stupid present.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:If there was something that l You know what, you ain't got to do nothing, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:It ain't like I'm still 5 years old.
SUPMALE:Ain't like I'll be sitting up every night asking my 
LEADMALE:"When's Daddy coming home?" Who needs him? He wasn't there to teach me how to shoot my first basket, but I learned.
LEADMALE:And I got pretty good at it too.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Got through my first date without him.
LEADFEMALE:I learned how to drive.
LEADMALE:I learned how to shave.
LEADFEMALE:How to fight.
OTHERMALE:I had 14 great birthdays without him.
LEADFEMALE:He never even sent me a damn card.
LEADMALE:To hell with him! I didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
SUPFEMALE:Will
LEADMALE:You know what, Uncle Phil? I'm gonna get through college without him.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get a great job without him.
LEADFEMALE:I'll marry a beautiful honey, have a bunch of kids and be a better father than he ever was.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need him for that, because there ain't a thing he could ever teach me about how to love my kids.
LEADMALE:How come he don't want me, man? 
OTHERMALE:
OTHERMALE:Sir?
LEADMALE:Oh, it's delicious.
OTHERMALE:You should eat some first.
SUPFEMALE:Sir, I hate to disturb you during feeding time but there's a man snooping around the premises.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, call the police.
LEADFEMALE:I'll handle this.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:I got this one, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:What are you doing in our back yard? Oh, my God, Uncle Phil, he's got a business card.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry if I startled anyone.
SUPFEMALE:Nobody answered the front door.
OTHERMALE:I'm a realtor.
LEADFEMALE:Ron Reed.
LEADMALE:How are you? That doesn't give you the right to go traipsing around our property.
LEADFEMALE:I've got a client prepared to make a generous offer on this house.
LEADMALE:Well, then come on in, Ron.
LEADMALE:It is Ron, isn't it? Sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Take a load off.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Care for some salmon? Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:What kind of offer, Mr.
SUPMALE:Reed?
LEADMALE:Well above market value.
SUPFEMALE:My client wants to buy it for his nephew.
LEADMALE:But this house is not for sale.
LEADMALE:How much? Shut up, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:And Mrs.
LEADMALE:Banks, if you'll hear me out.
OTHERMALE:You see, my client's nephew grew up in this house in the '50s and he'd like to repurchase it for sentimental reasons.
OTHERMALE:How much?
LEADMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, man you're not really going to consider selling this house, are you? I mean, come on, this place is special to us.
LEADFEMALE:I'm authorized to bid a half million dollars above fair-market value.
OTHERMALE:I'm going to pack my stuff, all right? It's kind of tempting, huh? Especially with the real estate market being so soft.
OTHERFEMALE:Am I the only one who doesn't think making money is always the bottom line? Let's hope so.
SUPFEMALE:Very funny, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Look, some stranger wants to buy this house for sentimental reasons.
LEADMALE:What about our sentimental reasons? We love this house.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I mean I think Ashley's right.
LEADMALE:I mean, this place has got a lot of memories.
LEADFEMALE:Living here has been almost a religious experience.
SUPFEMALE:My father would kill me if he knew I was out with a boy tonight.
SUPMALE:I told him I was going to church.
LEADMALE:The Lord is good.
SUPMALE:Why don't you come on over here, sit down and relax.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Well, you are pretty slick, Will Smith.
SUPMALE:And, I ain't even oiled up yet, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know what? You can sell the house.
SUPFEMALE:It's the couch that got the memories.
LEADFEMALE:And the Jacuzzi.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton's little typewriting table.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Look, kids, this is serious.
SUPFEMALE:What should we do, Philip? I can't imagine living someplace else.
LEADMALE:This is where we raised our children and taught them to be responsible adults.
SUPMALE:Here, Hilary, you take it out.
SUPMALE:Out where? To the trash cans.
SUPFEMALE:You know, those things you hit every time you back out the car.
OTHERMALE:Thank God, I thought it was the neighbor's kids.
LEADMALE:This is gross.
LEADMALE:I don't touch greasy, disgusting things.
LEADMALE:Well, just pretend it's buying you dinner afterwards.
SUPMALE:You take it.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, girl.
LEADFEMALE:And for your information, dinner comes first.
SUPFEMALE:It's like that, right, you're gonna slam garbage at me.
SUPFEMALE:Good morning, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPMALE:Here's your lunch.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:We all knew that Ashley was, well, cute.
LEADFEMALE:But with my help, she has turned into an absolute knockout.
OTHERFEMALE:So it gives me great pleasure to present the new Ashley Banks.
LEADMALE:Well, isn't she the most gorgeous creature you've ever seen? Ashley, sweetheart, are you comfortable dressed like this? Well, Daddy, it all comes down to what Robert thinks, and Ashley, aren't we forgetting something? You're so in tune with my needs.
SUPMALE:It was amazing and endless and magnificent.
SUPMALE:I think I saw God.
LEADMALE:Don't stop.
LEADMALE:The windows I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I fell.
LEADFEMALE:I fell.
LEADMALE:I fell.
LEADFEMALE:We didn't mean to You'd think in a house this big, a fellow would get a little privacy.
LEADMALE:Or stronger doors.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
SUPMALE:I still think we shouldn't sell this house.
OTHERFEMALE:It's home.
LEADMALE:Well, now, Ashley, this house obviously means a lot to all of us.
LEADFEMALE:But you don't get an offer like this everyday.
LEADMALE:I'll have to give it some consideration.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? I mean, your mother and I will have to give it some real consideration.
SUPMALE:Isn't that right, sweetheart? Dear? If we end up moving into another guesthouse I'm getting the bedroom this time.
LEADMALE:Not so fast, buster.
LEADMALE:Who knows if the new place is even gonna have a guesthouse? Don't worry, we'll bring a shoebox you can sleep in.
SUPMALE:Listen, my friend, I haven't exactly gotten a kick out of being your roommate either.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I can't imagine anything more irritating than sharing a pool house with you.
LEADFEMALE:I can.
SUPFEMALE:How about sharing a jail cell with you? Come on, man, let it go.
OTHERMALE:You'll feel better.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, that whole fiasco was your fault.
SUPFEMALE:You're totally immature.
SUPFEMALE:I'm immature? Well, isn't that the munchkin calling the midget short.
LEADMALE:Oh, what a night, I made a killing.
SUPFEMALE:Twenty-six Milky Ways.
SUPMALE:And the Democrats say there's a recession.
LEADFEMALE:What are you supposed to be? My idol, Macaulay Culkin.
LEADMALE:And you know why he's my idol? Why? Because y'all the same height? How dare you two defy me? Now, see here, big guy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! Howard! And to think, I laid out And not just any cake, I got you that really neat one in the commercials.
LEADMALE:You know, the one that 
LEADMALE:Carlton, Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:Come to think of it, I don't know how I've been around you this long.
OTHERMALE:What's wrong with being around me? Well, how about I'll take "always embarrassing me" for 500, Alex.
SUPFEMALE:What have I ever done to embarrass you? Well, you got a few days? You really think we made it? Hey, look, man, whether we did or not, you hung in there and I'm proud of you.
SUPMALE:You're proud of me? You never said that to me before in your life.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a hug.
SUPFEMALE:You see, man, that is exactly why I'll never tell you nothing.
OTHERMALE:Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
OTHERMALE:Admit it, Will.
LEADMALE:You care about me.
LEADFEMALE:I do not.
LEADMALE:Yes, you do.
LEADMALE:You like me.
LEADMALE:You like having me around.
LEADMALE:Carlton, take it back, man.
LEADFEMALE:Face it.
LEADFEMALE:You've just got to face it.
LEADMALE:You love me.
LEADMALE:All right, that was a bad example.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're not so much of an embarrassment.
SUPMALE:Apology accepted.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Carl Come one.
OTHERMALE:Hey, man.
SUPMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:So after careful consideration, we've decided not to sell.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man! When it came down to it, we just couldn't part with this place.
OTHERFEMALE:In the final analysis, there are more important things than money.
LEADMALE:Would everyone stop saying that? I'm getting a migraine.
OTHERFEMALE:We got some baby Tylenol in the kitchen.
OTHERMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:Ron.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I was just going to call you.
LEADFEMALE:Look, we've talked it over, and we've decided not to sell.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I'm sorry, I don't think there's anything that you can say that could change What's that? You're kidding.
LEADMALE:Could you hold on for a minute, please? Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Philip, what's going on? Ron said that his buyer is willing to go $ 1 million dollars above market value.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, there is a God! Look at you all.
LEADFEMALE:Will say something.
SUPFEMALE:Ching, ching! Okay, thank you very much.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:That was Ron.
OTHERFEMALE:The buyer is flying in this evening from New York.
LEADMALE:Yeah! A million dollars.
SUPFEMALE:But I don't want to move.
LEADMALE:Hey, girl.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Ashley, this is a million dollars here.
SUPFEMALE:Now, listen, Uncle Phil could put that money in the bank, right and then start getting all kinds of crazy interest.
LEADFEMALE:Then it's bonds, and then there's that T-bill stuff and then they got some certificates, and then junk be compounded.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about?
SUPMALE:I have no idea.
OTHERMALE:Money, money, money.
LEADFEMALE:Is that all you people care about? I have been very happy in this house.
LEADMALE:A lot of exciting things have happened to me here.
SUPMALE:Ashley, you're 15 years old.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, how much excitement could you possibly have had? A lot more than you, Carlton.
OTHERMALE:Happy birthday, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:I think I'd feel better if I could kiss you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Is that terrible? No.
LEADFEMALE:Is it terrible that I wanna kiss you back? Can I blow in your ear? Why? I don't know, I heard Will say it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Ashley, you ain't telling me that dude blew in your ear.
OTHERMALE:Me either.
SUPFEMALE:I embellished.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil, I think you've more than made your opinion known to Ashley and her boyfriends.
LEADMALE:Who do we have here?
SUPMALE:We met at the mall.
SUPFEMALE:What's your name, son? This.
LEADFEMALE:This is a stick with a snake wrapped around it.
LEADMALE:It's a symbol, like Prince.
SUPMALE:Prince who? See, that's exactly why fathers ain't allowed at the mall.
OTHERFEMALE:What's this thing? It's a symbol for "get out of my house!" So I lost my temper once.
LEADMALE:Who hasn't? Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Once? Speaking as a lawyer, I say your daughter suits the criminal profile to a T.
LEADMALE:Right down to the low-sloping forehead and the wide jaw suitable for grains and small rodents.
SUPMALE:I think you must have her confused with your mama.
SUPMALE:I don't want you to move out.
LEADMALE:Sorry, Dad, I have to go.
LEADFEMALE:No, you don't.
LEADMALE:Will says I do.
OTHERMALE:He says it's time for me to leave the nest, become independent and have sex with girls.
SUPFEMALE:Safe sex, mind you, but lots of it.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Is this what you've been telling my boy?
LEADFEMALE:What?
LEADMALE:That life is one big orgy.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't never said
LEADFEMALE:College is hard work, son Followed by a family, which is even more hard work.
SUPMALE:And a teenage daughter who doesn't wanna be seen with you in public.
OTHERFEMALE:And a wife who won't let you anywhere near her.
LEADMALE:And a butler who may be the father of your child.
OTHERFEMALE:And a gardener, a gardener
SUPFEMALE:Dad! Dad! You big-eared freeloader! You take your little square-headed cousin here and you find Geoffrey, and you bring him back or they'll never find your bodies.
SUPFEMALE:And I'm a judge, I can make it happen.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:All right, so I have an ugly side.
SUPMALE:And you could write "Goodyear" on it.
LEADMALE:The more I think about it, I won't mind saying goodbye to this place.
LEADMALE:I mean, I've experienced the greatest tragedies of my life here.
LEADMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:And I mean that in the nicest possible way, Hil.
SUPMALE:I look like a troll doll.
SUPFEMALE:Look, there he goes.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary Banks Yes, Trevor? Will you marry me? I ain't no bungee expert or nothing but I don't think he's supposed to be slamming into the ground like that.
OTHERMALE:If I hadn't asked for a special proposal Trevor would be in my arms instead of in my purse.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Trevor.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary Trevor wasn't cremated.
OTHERMALE:Then who's this? I'll see him to the door, Miss Hilary.
LEADMALE:I'm still not over that hair thing.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna need some hors d'oeuvres tonight.
SUPFEMALE:What do we have in the house?
SUPFEMALE:Whatever he hasn't eaten.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, for once, could you please cut the sarcasm? Sarcasm? Whatever do you mean? Geoffrey, go fetch my tools.
LEADMALE:You mean your knife and fork? Jazz, to what do we owe your presence? My guess would be inbreeding.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, it hasn't been that long since we've made love, has it? Five months this Tuesday.
LEADFEMALE:Why, that's just good-natured ribbing, sir unlike those ruthless barbs from Master William.
LEADFEMALE:Me? Earthquake! Man changed my life.
LEADFEMALE:Turned a skinny little kid from South Carolina into the man you see today.
SUPMALE:And you know how? He challenged me.
LEADMALE:To what? A pie eating contest? What is wrong with you people? I weigh the same thing I weighed in high school.
SUPMALE:Yeah, if you add up all four years.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, man.
LEADMALE:Man, have I told you how thin you're looking lately? You know, especially around your chins.
LEADFEMALE:I mean Damn.
LEADMALE:That must be him.

LEADFEMALE:My mama made me move.
LEADFEMALE:I would never leave Philly! I love it here.
LEADMALE:So do I.
SUPMALE:That's why I'm giving back to it.
LEADFEMALE:I stayed to help the kids in the area so that they wouldn't make the same mistakes I did.
LEADMALE:You sound like an after-school special, or something.
LEADFEMALE:But that ain't gonna do nothing for my rep.
SUPMALE:Let's go right now, and I ain't taking no for an answer.
LEADMALE:You have no choice.
OTHERMALE:Let's go.

SUPMALE:I can't do it.
OTHERMALE:No need to get melodramatic, Will.
SUPMALE:Just watch it on TV with the rest of us.
LEADFEMALE:I'm talking about going back to Bel-Air.
LEADMALE:I ain't ready to leave yet, y'all.
SUPFEMALE:I'm still having fun.
LEADMALE:Fun? You've been ostracized since you got here.
OTHERMALE:What you talking about? That Chicken Will thing? That ain't nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Guys be tripping like that all the time.
SUPMALE:You mean I was in a garbage can for nothing? When were you in a garbage can? Look, I'm just saying, you know I didn't realize how much I miss just sitting out on the stoop.
SUPMALE:Look, when we get back, Dad will buy us a stoop.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, we're gonna miss the plane.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I don't wanna spend another minute in this sardine can.

LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:Now, go clean up your room.
OTHERFEMALE:Go on.
LEADFEMALE:What time is Will's plane coming in?
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:He was supposed to call with his flight arrangements but he gets so wrapped up in his own life that he cannot take the time to be a little bit responsible.
OTHERMALE:That must be him now.
SUPMALE:Hello?
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Will, are you at the airport? No, I'm at home.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what happened? You miss your flight? Sort of.
SUPMALE:Well, when you coming back, then? I'm not.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:It's been a while since I left the family and moved back to Philly.
LEADFEMALE:I miss them a lot, but I got me a great job at Duke's House of Cheesesteaks.
LEADFEMALE:And, like they say, life goes on.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Smith.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, man, what's up? Come here.
SUPMALE:What's up? What does this contract say?
LEADMALE:"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

SUPMALE:Psssh.
SUPFEMALE:My best friend's back from Philly, I gotta hear about it on the street? I tried to get in touch.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you staying? On the street.
OTHERMALE:At least until Jewel lets me back in the house.
LEADMALE:Hey, man, it's good to see you, man.
LEADMALE:By the way, who's playing the mother this year? It's the same mom.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? Oh, come on, Jazz, that's Baby Nicky.
SUPMALE:I'm going back on the street where things make sense.
OTHERFEMALE:I am leaving in five minutes whether you are ready or not.
LEADMALE:Nicky, go get your brother, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I got to give you props for investing in this record store.
OTHERFEMALE:That must've been a lot of money.
SUPMALE:How much are we really worth? We?  "We.
LEADFEMALE:" Girls, Vivian, let's go! Philip, I do not appreciate being rushed like this.
SUPMALE:It's your opening, I want to look beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Vivian, I don't have that kind of time.
OTHERMALE:Carlton, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I'm so excited you bought a record store.
LEADFEMALE:Finally an investment where I can hang out.
SUPMALE:Nothing stopped you from hanging out at my hardware store.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, I ain't playing.
OTHERFEMALE:I am in your will, right? Well, if he is, I'll fight it.
LEADMALE:I'm going, but I'm not staying long.
LEADFEMALE:I'm conferencing with my producers about my talk-show persona.
LEADMALE:Am I antagonizing like Geraldo? Am I investigative like Donahue? Maybe you should go bald like Montel.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, now, are we missing anyone? Just G, but we don't take him nowhere anyway.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Come on, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Uncle Phil, man, this place is on book.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you know, this is the kind of place I could see myself managing.
LEADFEMALE:Call me stupid, but I'm in this to make some money.
SUPMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, I'm telling you, I could see that.
SUPMALE:From the time I walked in, I was having visions, man.
LEADMALE:You know what? You ain't got no X-rated skin flicks up in here.
OTHERMALE:You toss some of them up in here, you be making it hand over fist.
LEADMALE:Hand over fist.
SUPMALE:Will, Will, Will! No offense but in the world of business and finance, I consider you the antiprofit.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Uncle Phil, I'm serious.
SUPFEMALE:I feel this, you gotta let me in on this.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Why not?  I mean, Mother, you watch my show, am I too soft-spoken? Hilary
SUPFEMALE:I got music in my blood.

SUPFEMALE:Will, this wasn't an easy thing for me to agree with.
LEADMALE:We both know that you were in over your head.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to do the best thing I could for Ashley.
LEADMALE:You can push me out and take everything over but we both know I made Ashley Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, gee, I could have sworn that Vivian and I had something to do with it.
SUPMALE:You know what I'm talking about, Uncle Phil.

OTHERFEMALE:We can't blame Will for what's happened to Ashley.
LEADMALE:Okay, wait, wait.
LEADMALE:Time out.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to Ashley? This singing contract has gone straight to her head.
LEADMALE:These new managers are putting pressure on her and she's doing the best she can with it.
SUPMALE:They must be doing something right.
LEADFEMALE:She is in heavy rotation on The Box, heh, heh whatever that is.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm glad you're okay with this because I don't like it.
LEADMALE:Not one little bit.
LEADMALE:Gee, she hides it so well.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, yo, man, is Ashley really that bad? I'm afraid so, Master William.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps later on we could pour some water on her and watch her melt.
LEADMALE:Carlton, do you hear that? You mean your song on the radio? No, I mean the cash registers racking up my record sales.
LEADMALE:Isn't she funny? Don't just stand there, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Call him a good boy and toss him a treat.
LEADMALE:Will, don't be mad.
OTHERMALE:I'm thanking you on my album cover.

OTHERFEMALE:It's a salute to divas.
LEADMALE:Past, present and future.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, that is my idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Right, just like you launched Ashley's career? So how about it, Ash? Hilary, it sounds really wonderful and I'd love to do it but, well, my managers have this silly little idea about me only doing important shows.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, so, what you doing, 60 Minutes? So young, so bitter.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton! Oh, she is so self-centered.
LEADMALE:I hear that.
LEADMALE:After everything I've done for her.
SUPMALE:You? Who's talking about you? Well, I'm talking about Miss Thing.

LEADFEMALE:I made a mistake.
LEADMALE:That's why I bought this train set.
LEADMALE:Well, it's a start.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:When I was a little girl, I got so mad at your mother I stopped speaking to her for weeks.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:Really? It's hard to imagine you being quiet for that long, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:Go on.
LEADMALE:She gave away one of my favorite toys.
OTHERFEMALE:It was a Raggedy Ann doll.
LEADFEMALE:But I got over it.
LEADMALE:Whoa, wait a minute, my mom told me about that.

SUPFEMALE:Banks, seen here wielding a potato " Wielding? I was not wielding, I was rubbing.
LEADMALE:I rubbed that damn potato all over Leeza's car and it didn't make a scratch.
SUPFEMALE:At least they didn't catch me putting my keys in her exhaust pipe.
SUPMALE:Hilary, you were suppo Never mind.
LEADMALE: Hey, Nicky.
LEADFEMALE:What's all this? His Dougie toys, he's giving them all away.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not worthy, thanks to you.
SUPFEMALE:Nicky, Nicky, come here, come here.
LEADMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:You don't understand, man.
LEADMALE:Listen, I wasn't rumbling with Dougie.
OTHERFEMALE:I was rumbling with the guy inside Dougie.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, right, the guy inside Dougie.
LEADFEMALE:That damn whale got him brainwashed.
LEADMALE:Will, Nicky believes in Dougie the same way he believes in Santa Claus.
SUPMALE:So?
LEADFEMALE:Well, Dougie's his hero.
LEADMALE:Didn't you have heroes when you were a kid? Yeah, Shaft.
SUPFEMALE:And how did you feel when you found out that Shaft wasn't real? What are you talking about? No, I'm saying, he was based on an actual guy.
LEADFEMALE:No, he wasn't.
OTHERMALE:He was too, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Shaft is fictional, Will.
LEADMALE:I'm saying, he went to Africa and everything.
LEADMALE:Will, you can't tell Nicky that Dougie isn't real.
SUPMALE:Why don't you take him down to the mall and let him see you apologize to Dougie? I thought of that, just he ain't there no more.
SUPMALE:Well, where is he? In rehab.
LEADMALE:Well, Will, you have to do something.
OTHERMALE:It's like he lost his best friend.
SUPMALE:Yep, I know the feeling.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey! Geoffrey! Yes, Miss Hilary? I have been calling you for 15 minutes.
LEADMALE:Didn't you hear me? Yes, but I so rarely have a woman scream my name I was rather enjoying it.
SUPMALE:I need to tape Leeza Gibbons' show.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna record every nasty thing she says and then I'm gonna sue her for definition of character.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, how do you turn this on? Why don't you just use the VCR? Geoffrey, if I knew how to use the VCR, would I need this camera? No, I would not.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's already started.
SUPMALE:Turn it on.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:So that's all coming up today.
LEADFEMALE:But we'll get to that in a moment.
SUPFEMALE:First, I wanna talk about this so-called feud going on between Hilary Banks and me.
SUPFEMALE:Now, Hilary, you and I, we're part of a very special sorority.
LEADMALE:A sort of sisterhood of talk-show hosts.
SUPFEMALE:I love your show and I wish you lots of success.
SUPFEMALE:So, what do you say? Let's bury the hatchet.
OTHERMALE:Ooh, that witch.
LEADMALE:So you see it too.
SUPMALE:All I see is a beautiful woman perched atop two of the most finely sculpted legs I've ever seen.
OTHERMALE:Oh, like those are real.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, the pogmeister's in the house.
OTHERMALE:Who wants some? Looks like I'm out.
LEADFEMALE:Here's Will.
LEADMALE:Maybe he can give you some competition.
LEADMALE:I'm not in the mood.
SUPFEMALE:Gets that from his mother.
LEADMALE:You know what that kid's problem is? His values is all messed up, man.
SUPFEMALE:Any other normal kid, you could just buy their love back.
SUPMALE:This has really upset you, hasn't it?  You was right, man, I'm a terrible role model.
LEADMALE:I ain't never having no kids.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, now, Will, as much as the idea of your reproducing scares the hell out of me you'll make a great father.
LEADMALE:Everybody makes mistakes with kids.
LEADMALE:The important thing is to admit when you're wrong and to apologize.
LEADFEMALE:How come you don't ever do that? Don't question me.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey, Nicky.
LEADFEMALE:Mind if I join you? Wow.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't know you could read the paper.
LEADFEMALE:I can't.
SUPMALE:Nicky, listen, there's something I need to tell you about Dougie.
OTHERFEMALE:And not just him neither.
SUPMALE:It's the Easter bunny and the tooth fairy.
LEADMALE:What about them? Well, you're getting to be a big boy now.
LEADFEMALE:Sooner or later you're gonna find out none of them
SUPMALE:None of them are what?
LEADFEMALE:Um Here, read the personals, Nicky.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, hottie.
SUPMALE:Yo.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, baby? Freeze, munchkins! They're not munchkins, son, they're elves.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? Who are you, Keebler?  Oh, boy, you're not even close.

SUPMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Santa Claus.
LEADMALE:Right on, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody knows Santa Claus is a Clippers fan.

SUPFEMALE:Maybe this year I'll put a brain in your stocking.
LEADFEMALE:Why do these make-believe guys keep pushing me? Come on over here.
LEADFEMALE:Sit down, right here.
LEADMALE:Unh-unh.

OTHERMALE:But, Nicky Nicky is blessed with a very precious gift.
OTHERFEMALE:Innocence.
OTHERMALE:And you were about to take that away from him.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't wanna do that.
LEADMALE:I don't want him to be mad at me forever.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, Will, nothing is forever with children.
SUPMALE:They grow up and they forget.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, remember something you used to believe in me once.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you ought to try believing in me again.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, here, here.
SUPMALE:You be a good boy.
LEADFEMALE:And tell Carlton to stop faxing me.
SUPMALE:I cannot get him into Princeton.

LEADFEMALE:Not now, man.
SUPMALE:I'm not in the mood.
SUPMALE:Carlton won't play with me, either.
SUPMALE:What's going on? Well, we're kind of having problems.
SUPMALE:Maybe you should talk to somebody.
LEADMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Nicky, it's like this, man.
LEADFEMALE:We always make Not me.
LEADMALE:I'm just a kid.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you tell him? Will, are you going to finally let me explain what happened? Ah, shh.

OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing?
SUPMALE:Driving lessons.
SUPFEMALE:Lesson number 
LEADMALE:Use a car.
OTHERMALE:Hilary, Nicky's right.
LEADFEMALE:Can we just get in the car? I don't think you're ready to get behind the wheel yet.
LEADMALE:Now, put the car in gear and pull cautiously away from the curb.
LEADMALE:Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:What? You're in neutral.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, we're driving down Sunset.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, cute boy, 3 o'clock.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:Keep your eyes on the road.
LEADMALE:Hilary.
OTHERMALE:Now, take a left on Rodeo.
LEADFEMALE:Remember to signal.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, there's Bruce and Demi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Yuck, what is she wearing? Hilary, this is beyond stupid.
OTHERMALE:Use your imagination.
LEADMALE:You're doing great.
LEADMALE:We're driving.
LEADFEMALE:We're driving.
SUPFEMALE:Stop.
LEADMALE:What? Cartier's having a sale.
OTHERMALE:Pick me up in an hour.
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going?
SUPMALE:To get a bus schedule.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Can't we just talk about this? Listen, I don't wanna talk about nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanna watch the game and forget it.
LEADFEMALE:Fine with me.
LEADFEMALE:Careful with that drumstick, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Turn your back, Carlton's liable to start eating and 
SUPMALE:"Oops.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, it just jumped in my mouth.
LEADMALE:" That wouldn't happen if you treated the drumstick like a person instead of a piece of meat.
LEADMALE:You know what, Carlton? You ain't nothing but a dog.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, you're an acrimonious, rancorous, virulent coveter.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, you ain't nothing but a dog.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
SUPMALE:That's enough.
LEADMALE:Look, why don't I tell you guys a story? Now look what you done.
OTHERFEMALE:I like Dad's stories.
SUPFEMALE:And some day, I'm gonna tell my kids these same pointless anecdotes.
LEADFEMALE:Go ahead, Dad.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Well, when I was growing up, my best friend lived in the next apartment.
SUPMALE:His name was Ralph.
SUPFEMALE:And one day, after 18 years of friendship, we had a fight.
LEADMALE:Well, I went to college and he joined the Navy.
LEADFEMALE:Five years ago I went to our high school reunion.
LEADMALE:I was determined to bury the hatchet.
LEADMALE:But Ralph didn't show up.
SUPFEMALE:I found out that he died the month before.
LEADMALE:Well, I never had a chance to make peace with him.
LEADFEMALE:What's even worse, I can't even remember what we fought about.
LEADFEMALE:You kids should think about that.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hold up a second there, Aesop.
SUPFEMALE:What's this apartment stuff? Thought you grew up on a farm.
SUPFEMALE:Well, in the South, "farm" and "apartment" are interchangeable.
SUPFEMALE:Uh Uh, uh, five years ago? Since when do they have reunions for your 22nd year?
LEADMALE:Yeah, man.
LEADMALE:And how all of a sudden?
SUPFEMALE:Okay, okay, I made it up.
LEADFEMALE:All right? Pfft.
LEADMALE:Huh.
SUPMALE:I guess lying just run all through this family, huh? I'm not lying, you nefarious, degenerate miscreant.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, like I'm supposed to believe that, you big dog.
LEADMALE:Did you put super glue in my hair gel?  Hey, that's what you get for stealing my girl.
OTHERMALE:I didn't have to steal her.
LEADMALE:She was bored with you so she came to me, a real man.
SUPFEMALE:So, what you saying? I'm not a real man? Yeah, you got it.
LEADMALE:You should know that all that "yo, yo, hey, baby, bap, bap, bap" stuff is just played out.
LEADFEMALE:It worked in high school, but now it's just embarrassing.
LEADFEMALE:So I'm the embarrassment now? Take it easy, stumpy.
LEADMALE:You know something else? I'm tired of all those short jokes.
SUPFEMALE:I'm average height.
SUPFEMALE:For a woman.
SUPFEMALE:I'm large enough for Valerie.
LEADMALE:You wants to go there, huh? You know what? I'm sick of this.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
OTHERMALE:Let's go right now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sick of this.
LEADMALE:I'm sick of this.
LEADMALE:Come on, come on.
SUPMALE:Let's go, come on, what, what, what you want to do? Pfft.
OTHERMALE:Like that hurt.
OTHERFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:Will, are you okay? Will, wake up.
LEADMALE:Will, come on.
LEADMALE:Damn, still alive.
SUPMALE:You know what keeps me going? The thought of dancing on your grave.
LEADFEMALE:Dance on my grave, will you? Damn.
SUPFEMALE:Come, Mr.
SUPMALE:Smith.
OTHERMALE:It's time for your sponge bath.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey, good thing too, because I'm feeling dirty.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Tootsie roll.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, my leg.
LEADFEMALE:My leg.
SUPFEMALE:Aw.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, girl, you gonna fall for that? What about my sponge bath? I'll let you shave me.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Let me take care of Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks first.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I get it.
SUPFEMALE:First you steal my girl and now you're gonna steal my nurse.
SUPMALE:You old prune.
LEADMALE:I ought to knock your teeth out.
SUPMALE:Go ahead, they're in the glass next to my bed.
SUPMALE:Is that what you want? Aw.
SUPMALE:Got to go back to the ghetto on you now.
SUPMALE:You're trying to kill me.
SUPFEMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:You all right?
LEADFEMALE:Come closer.
LEADFEMALE:You all right? I'm feeling the life being sucked out of me.
LEADFEMALE:Before I die I just want you to know that I I hate you.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Carlton, wake up.
LEADMALE:Carlton.
SUPMALE:I never got to tell you I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Why, Carlton? Will, hold you head back.
LEADMALE:It'll stop the bleeding.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Carlton.
LEADMALE:I think you've helped enough.
SUPMALE:I guess you're wondering what happened.
LEADMALE:What's to wonder? Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:I have a nephew with a possibly broken nose.
LEADMALE:And I don't wanna even know why your damn hands are stuck to your head.
SUPFEMALE:What I do know is that I want both of you to settle this thing or I will.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:You got it, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
LEADFEMALE:We can handle it.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:It's done.
LEADMALE:We can handle it.
LEADFEMALE:Just go on.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Carlton, um I was doing a lot of thinking while I was unconscious.
LEADMALE:We're cousins, man.
SUPFEMALE:We've been together long enough.
OTHERFEMALE:I should know you would never do to me the kind of things that I would do to you.
OTHERMALE:That's sweet, Will.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry for saying all those things and for punching your lights out.
SUPFEMALE:It was a lucky shot.
LEADMALE:I hit you pretty square, Will.
OTHERMALE:Look, the important thing is that we get beyond that lucky punch.
OTHERFEMALE:We're family, man.
LEADMALE:We shouldn't be fighting like this.
LEADMALE:We should be helping each other.
LEADMALE:Hey, put her there.
OTHERMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:You're right, man.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry about the hair.
SUPMALE:Let me help you.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Jazz, I got 10 bucks that says you bluffing worse than Haiti.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see you beat three kings.
SUPFEMALE:Two pair.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:A pair of red fives and a pair of black fives.
LEADFEMALE:That is eight pots in a row.
LEADFEMALE:Couldn't nobody be that lucky unless they were cheating.
OTHERFEMALE:It ain't cheating, Will.
LEADFEMALE:It's focus.
SUPFEMALE:The fact is the only time I ever concentrate is when I'm playing poker.
LEADFEMALE:It's a gift.
LEADMALE:According to my calculations, over the last three years.
SUPFEMALE:.
LEADMALE:Jazz has beaten us for approximately $13,000.
OTHERFEMALE:Would've been 14 if you hadn't gone back to Philly.
SUPFEMALE:My wallet sure missed you, homey.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I wasn't in Philly the whole time, Jazz.
LEADMALE:No? Where were you, Kalamazoo? Alabama.
LEADFEMALE:And what were you doing in Alabama? I witnessed a murder.
LEADMALE:You ain't witnessed no murder.
SUPMALE:Did he, Carlton? I'm not at liberty to discuss this.
LEADMALE:And you shouldn't either.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, shut up, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Ain't nothing that me and Will don't know about each other.
LEADFEMALE:Except this.
LEADMALE:For real? Tell me.
LEADFEMALE:He can't.
SUPMALE:Agent Moore swore us to secrecy.
LEADMALE:Look, Carlton is right, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry I brought it up.
OTHERMALE:Let's just play.
SUPMALE:Will, if you don't tell me what went down, our friendship is over.
LEADFEMALE:It all started on a hot August day back in Philly.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, you want to ante up? I had just arrived at Duke's with my girl, Laqueesha.
SUPMALE:The City of Brotherly Love's finest sister.
LEADMALE:Oh, baby, thank you so much for walking me to work.
LEADMALE:And thank you for breakfast too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, am I a better cook than your mama? You all got different styles.
LEADFEMALE:My mom usually like to cook with her clothes on.
OTHERMALE:I guess when she comes home from her trip I'm gonna have to go back to my own place, huh? Well, either that or we have to be very, very quiet.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:See, my moms won the WDAS-FM Back To Africa Contest.
SUPFEMALE:She spotted anything culturally wrong in The Lion King.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Mmm.
LEADFEMALE:I will see you later.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Little did she know that's the last time she'd see me.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Your woman was murdered? 
OTHERFEMALE:Can I finish? 
LEADFEMALE:My fault, go ahead.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:All of a sudden this big dude comes out of the kitchen.
SUPMALE:Hey, man, what was you doing in there?
LEADFEMALE:I'm with the Health Department.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you
LEADFEMALE:Do you have any? Oh, man, Duke, Duke.
SUPFEMALE:Duke.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:I feared the worse when I got to Duke's office.
LEADFEMALE:And I was right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mama, no.
LEADMALE:I'd never seen a dead body before.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, Curtis sees them all the time.
OTHERFEMALE:He works at the post office.
SUPMALE:Turns out the mob was trying to muscle in on the lucrative Philly-cheese-steak market.
LEADMALE:Duke told them, "Over my dead body.
LEADMALE:" I sure do miss him.
LEADFEMALE:Man, it was up to me to finger Duke's killer.
LEADMALE:That's him.
SUPFEMALE:That's him.
SUPFEMALE:Number three, that's him.
LEADMALE:You're positive it isn't one of the others? No, that's him.
LEADMALE:That's him, man.
SUPMALE:Send the first two out.
LEADMALE:The man we are looking at is John "Fingers" O'Neill the number one hit man for the mob.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to start on the paperwork.
SUPFEMALE:Um   Boy, your choking days is over.
LEADMALE:You're going to jail, fool.
SUPMALE:Lucky there's 5 inches of glass between us.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, I might just tear off into   
LEADMALE:All I could think was Turn around! 
LEADFEMALE:He saw you.
LEADMALE:You think? 
LEADMALE:O'Neill escaped by bowling over nine agents and a DEA dog.
LEADMALE:My life was in danger so they put me in witness protection in Deliverance, Alabama.
OTHERMALE:They hooked me up with a new life and a new name.
OTHERFEMALE:Floyd Palmer? Hey, look, no.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-uh.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:I'm more like a Malcolm Akbar Mustafa.
LEADMALE:It's taken.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, hold up.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a city boy.
SUPMALE:You know, I got to get out 
LEADFEMALE:I gotta get out to the club and get my little groove on.
LEADMALE:Talk some jazz.
LEADFEMALE:Got me? Well, the nearest town is Hatred, Mississippi.
OTHERFEMALE:I can check if there's dancing.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait, wait.
OTHERMALE:Can I at least call my family in Bel-Air? Absolutely not.
SUPMALE:They've been informed you're in the program.
LEADMALE:They wish you luck.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:I was scared and somewhat alone.
SUPMALE:So I did what I always do when faced with adversity.
SUPMALE:Of course I love you, Laqueesha.
SUPMALE:I don't think your butt is too saggy.
OTHERFEMALE:Please, O'Neill, no.
LEADMALE:Oh, please don't kill me.
SUPMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:I bet it was the killer, right?
LEADFEMALE:Are you in or out? I'm out, I'm out.
SUPMALE:Tough break.
LEADMALE:Your full house would have beaten my seven high.
LEADMALE:I bet it was the killer, right? Look, Jazz, I just don't feel comfortable telling you any more, man.
LEADFEMALE:Who knows? Your life could be in danger.
SUPFEMALE:What life? I'm a married man.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, if Jewel asks, we were at our pottery class tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:So I bet it was the killer, right? All right, all right, I'll tell you, but ante up first.
LEADMALE:Man, it was the most horrifying thing I had ever seen.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Hey, man, what you doing here? What am I doing here? What am I doing here?  Well, son, I'll tell you what I'm doing here.
LEADMALE:You see, years ago I fell in love with and married a wonderful woman named Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian had a sister named Vy.
LEADFEMALE:Vy gave birth to a child named Will whose sole purpose in life has been to make mine a living hell.
OTHERMALE:Now, you've done a lot to me over the last four years but how you managed to have me ripped out of my wonderful life in Bel-Air and relocated to this landfill boggles my mind.
SUPMALE:What do you have to say for yourself? Is that a toupee? Yes, it's a toupee.
LEADMALE:It's a part of my new identity.
LEADMALE:You see what you do to me? Where's the bathroom? It's right through that door.
LEADMALE:It leads outside.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, I know.
SUPMALE:You better take this broomstick.
SUPFEMALE:There's something living in there.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, my family.
SUPMALE:Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:What happened? The FBI heard that your hit man was gonna try to get to you through us.
LEADFEMALE:So they put us in the witness protection program too.
OTHERFEMALE:See, Mom, I always said Will would be the ruin of this family but did you listen to me? Does anyone ever listen to me?
LEADMALE:What are you babbling about, Carlton?
SUPFEMALE:Carlton? There's no Carlton here.
LEADMALE:Thanks to you, Carlton Banks no longer exists.
LEADFEMALE:He's now Little Zeke from Cabin Creek.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate to say it, Carlton, but you and your family are spoiled.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, there was a homicidal maniac looking for you all but you still got a free vacation on the government's tip.
LEADMALE:Royal flush.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:You win again.
LEADFEMALE:Something must be affecting my concentration.
LEADFEMALE:Go on, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, go on, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Jacks are better? I knew if I could get Uncle Phil on my side, the others would come around.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Big Zeke to you.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, how you gonna be mad at me? You always telling me to do the right thing.
SUPMALE:So? You never listened to me before, why did you have to do it now? What was I supposed to do? Just let Duke's killer get away? I know.
LEADFEMALE:I know you did what you had to do.
LEADMALE:Man, I just hope the FBI catches him before he gets to me.
LEADFEMALE:You scared, son? Not so much now that you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, man, look, want to try fishing tomorrow? Oh, can't.
LEADMALE:Tomorrow I start my new job at the manure plant.
LEADFEMALE:Sleep tight, Floyd.
SUPMALE:Good night, Big Zeke.
LEADFEMALE:I hear you'd like to go dancing.
LEADFEMALE:You know, there's one thing I can't follow.
SUPMALE:One thing?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:While you all were in Deliverance, where was the hit man?
LEADFEMALE:That's a good question, Jazz.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Dude, why don't you tell him, Carlton?
LEADFEMALE:Well, I would, but I need a fresh deck.
OTHERMALE:Um The hit man was here in Bel-Air.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:"Dear Neiman or Marcus, whichever of you gets this first.
LEADFEMALE:I'm being held hostage by my own government.
LEADFEMALE:Please send my fall/winter catalog care of Betty Mae Swilly, Deliverance, Alabama.
LEADMALE:"  Yep?  Jewel.
LEADMALE:Yeah, the pottery class.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no, we was at the pottery class.
LEADFEMALE:But, uh, the kiln blew up.
LEADMALE:No, Jazz, he He busy picking vase particles out of his butt.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! Ow! Jewel, listen  I know that sound.
SUPFEMALE:I better get home.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, you'll miss the best part of the story, where we meet the bear.
LEADMALE:The bear?
SUPFEMALE:The bear? Oh, pfft, the bear.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Deuces are wild.
SUPFEMALE:Uh You're the animal lover, Carlton, why don't you tell him about the bear.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:See, in order to find food we had to hike into the nearest town.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tired.
LEADMALE:How long have we been walking?
SUPFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:About three, four minutes.
OTHERMALE:Ohh!  Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Go on, Maynard, go home.
LEADMALE:Scoot.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, go.
SUPFEMALE:You get.
LEADFEMALE:You get.
LEADFEMALE:Good bear.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you so much.
OTHERMALE:Hey, look, you saved my life.
LEADMALE:What's your name, baby butt? Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:Floyd.
LEADFEMALE:Will Floyd, you ever been with a big woman? I was in the Statue of Liberty once.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Miss, miss.
LEADMALE:Ohh.
LEADFEMALE:Ohh.
SUPFEMALE:What is that on your teeth?
LEADMALE:Pudding.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Carlton, I had almost forgotten about Bertha.
SUPMALE:How could you forget? You almost married her.
OTHERFEMALE:Man, this is getting complicated.
LEADMALE:Boy, tell me about it.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:That night we were enjoying a special dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Our neighbor Sue Ellen was cooking something she had run over.
SUPMALE:Sorry I'm late, but it was so beautiful I just couldn't leave the marina.
LEADMALE:Chateaubriand? Mmm!
LEADMALE:So how was your day, sweetheart?
LEADFEMALE:It was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look what one of the girls taught me.
LEADFEMALE:Now, a lot of families would just crumble under these circumstances.
LEADFEMALE:But, once again, we are showing our true colors.
LEADFEMALE:To family.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:To family.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:There he is, Daddy.
LEADMALE:There's the dirty varmint made me pregnant.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't make nobody pregnant.
LEADFEMALE:You calling my daughter a liar? No, man, it just wasn't me.
LEADFEMALE:Of course it wasn't.
SUPMALE:The boy just got to Deliverance.
LEADMALE:Oh, is that so? Fella over at the college says he's been going there for two years.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, damn witness protection program.
LEADMALE:Wedding's set for tomorrow at noon.
LEADMALE:If you register at Tiffany's ask for Richard.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, hold on.
LEADMALE:Nobody is registering for anything.
LEADMALE:Mister
LEADMALE:McCoy, Hatfield McCoy.
OTHERMALE:Now, now, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:McCoy, now your daughter is a very, uh lovely woman and any man would be proud to be the father of her child but you cannot go around falsely accusing people.
LEADFEMALE:Twelve o'clock.
LEADMALE:You bring the groom, I'll bring the shotgun.
SUPMALE:Bring it, Bertha.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
LEADMALE:Oh, say, hey, hey, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:McCoy, listen.
SUPMALE:Now, I would love to marry your daughter, you know, but I mean, who wouldn't? Me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you see, it's my moms.
LEADFEMALE:You know, see, she's in Africa and I'm her only child.
LEADFEMALE:And it would just crush her to not be here to share in my happiness.
LEADMALE:Well, we're real big on family so the wedding will take place just as soon as she gets back.
SUPFEMALE:But the engagement party is tonight.
LEADMALE:And at least I have this picture of you to keep in my drawers.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Where did you get this?
LEADMALE:The general store.
LEADMALE:Vern said some big fella's been asking about you.
SUPFEMALE:He left it.
SUPMALE:Come on, boys.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:That means you-know-who is coming you-know-where.
OTHERMALE:
LEADFEMALE:I knew it was just a matter of time before O'Neill found me so I decided to fight fire with fire.
LEADMALE:I enlisted the aid of my future father-in-law and his trigger-happy kin.
LEADMALE:All right, listen, now, when you hear me say the word "family" that's when you coming running out, all right? All right.
OTHERMALE:You heard my future son-in-law, now git.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:As they ran off to take their positions I realized one 
SUPFEMALE:Hatfield didn't use deodorant.
LEADFEMALE:I had to kill time before the killer came to kill me.
SUPFEMALE:I thought about all those showdowns I'd seen in all those Westerns.
SUPFEMALE:The good guys usually won.
OTHERMALE:Well, except for the Unforgiven where everybody got killed.
SUPFEMALE:And then there was Posse which got killed at the box office.
SUPFEMALE:If I were you, I would run.
SUPMALE:If you were me, you'd be good-looking.
LEADMALE:You know, usually, I try to detach myself from my work but I'm going to enjoy squeezing the life out of you.
LEADMALE:"I'm really going to enjoy squeezing the life out of you.
LEADFEMALE:"  You know why I'm not scared of you? Because I got something that you don't have.
LEADFEMALE:Family.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? I got a sister in New Jersey.
SUPFEMALE:I'm talking about family.
LEADFEMALE:Family! I mean, family.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPMALE:It was obvious the McCoys didn't know when to say when.
LEADFEMALE:Say, my man, you mind if I run inside and put on a big pot of coffee? How did you get away? Ante up and I'll tell you.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out of money.
LEADFEMALE:Then I'm out of story.
SUPMALE:Wait a second.
LEADMALE:That part about the bear wasn't true, was it? None of it was true.
LEADMALE:Mister, consider yourself hustled.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come over for some poker tomorrow we'll tell you about Carlton and the alien.
LEADMALE:You know, you guys are nothing but a bunch of stinking, thieving liars.
OTHERFEMALE:I have to go sit on a vase and get home to my wife.
OTHERMALE:Wow, hook, line and sinker.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, sir, I am the true fisherman.
LEADFEMALE:When it comes to deception, you are the prince.
LEADMALE:Oh, 9:00, I gotta get to bed.
OTHERMALE:Hey, good night, Little Zeke.
LEADMALE:Good night, Will Floyd.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo-hoo-hoo.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right, all right.
OTHERMALE:That'll teach him to play with me.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:This piece is exquisite.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:It certainly is.
LEADMALE:And you can sense the artist's pain and yet it's a celebration of life.
LEADMALE:Yo! A swap meet.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Culture.
LEADMALE:What you talking about, Uncle Phil? I got me a capacity for paintings, man.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I can sense what the artist is saying.
SUPMALE:Oh, like this one.
SUPMALE:What a brother got to do to get some fries? See, and here, I can sense the juxtaposition of metaphors interspersed with the three-second violation.
LEADMALE:You're a jackass.
LEADMALE:What is that noise? Geoffrey's using my electric shoe buffer.
SUPMALE:That old thing with the frayed wires? That's one of a kind.
LEADMALE:They don't make them like that anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I call this one workman's compensation.
LEADFEMALE:Autumn, my favorite time of the year.
LEADMALE:The leaves are falling and the hotties are pledging.
SUPFEMALE:Here I go, girl.
LEADMALE:Baby, if I told you you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me? Get it? That's a double entendre.
SUPFEMALE:  Oh, Grey Poupon to you too, girl.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, listen, what do you say we go have some dinner tonight? You know, escargots and all that.
LEADMALE:I don't think that will be a good idea.
SUPFEMALE:I'm pledging Kappa and we sisters have to stick together.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:Your lines won't work with us, mister.
SUPMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Lines? What are y'all talking about? These aren't lines.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? A woman cannot take it when a man is honest.
LEADMALE:Look, when I take a woman out, I'm 100 percent gentleman.
LEADMALE:I'm opening car doors, paying for dinners.
LEADMALE:Car doors, paying for dinners.
LEADFEMALE:And I treat a woman like a king treats a queen.
LEADFEMALE:Y'all remembered those, huh? Ladies, say goodbye to Will in his native tongue.
LEADFEMALE:   I don't believe you.
SUPMALE:You're so desperate to get over, you gonna go out on your own blood.
SUPMALE:I'm not trying to get over on anybody, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Your problem is that you can't understand or respect women because you're not in touch with your feminine side.
LEADMALE:You know what your problem is, C? You're not in touch with anybody's feminine side.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, today I bought something for someone I really love.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you enjoy it, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, it's for you.
SUPMALE:Well, what do you think? It's It's a Blue.
LEADFEMALE:I bought it next door at the new country club.
SUPFEMALE:It's a Marachi, handmade in Milan.
SUPMALE:Don't you love it? Try it on.
LEADFEMALE:Well, ha, ha my first Marachi.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Well, I just think that sweater looks gorgeous.
OTHERMALE:In fact, I'm gonna buy you a matching hat.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sweetheart Tell me, sir, do I wash that or take a weed whacker to it? 
SUPFEMALE:So, what are you talking about? 
LEADMALE:What is? Carlton, quick, get a bat, let's bust this pi√±ata.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about it, Dad, he got his earlier.
SUPMALE:Today, this entire group of girls made a fool out of Will.
LEADFEMALE:Not one of them would fall for his lines.
OTHERMALE:Master William, it's for you.
SUPFEMALE:A Lisa Wilkes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, one.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, man, can I help it if I say the things that women wanna hear? What's up, chumpy? It's confidence, son.
OTHERMALE:Women love a confident man.
LEADFEMALE:Take me for instance.
LEADFEMALE:Why, back in the day  I'd slip on the old dashiki puff up the old fro find a foxy mama, say, "Hey, baby, let's get it on.
LEADMALE:"  And they bought that? Actually, your mother was the only one.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Helen, they was out of Goobers, so I got us this large thing of popcorn.
OTHERMALE:Get out! What you doing, Barney? Yo, man, where Helen at? She's probably at the chiropractor.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Helen! Helen.
LEADMALE:Oh, Will, don't let that spoil anything, because this has been the greatest night.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, if you like this one, wait till you see the sequel.
LEADMALE:You are a dog.
LEADMALE:The only problem is I really wanna be a Kappa and if they see me with you, they won't let me in.
SUPMALE:Don't even worry about that, I'll wear a disguise.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go Michael Jackson style.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:You don't need to go that far.
LEADFEMALE:I'm house-sitting a friend's cabin this weekend and I wouldn't mind a little company.
SUPMALE:Little company? I'm more like the Fortune 500, you know? AT&T.
LEADFEMALE:Reach out and touch a brother if you got your bill paid.
OTHERMALE:Will, where are you going? Oh, to the cabin.
LEADMALE:That's tomorrow.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, cool.
LEADMALE:Well, let's get back to the movie.
OTHERFEMALE:I was so lucky I found this hat.
OTHERMALE:It was the last extra extra extra large.
SUPMALE:Well, gee, the gods must be smiling on me.
LEADMALE:And I'd guess there's some laughing and pointing going on too.
LEADMALE:Oh, honey, I think it's cute.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Really? I'm going to the pro shop to buy you a matching outfit right now.
LEADFEMALE:Well, honey, I quit playing golf.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
OTHERFEMALE:You could at least yell four! I'll take care of it, Miss Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:You know, when they redesigned this golf course I thought it might raise our property values.
LEADMALE:But it's making it dangerous for us to be here.
OTHERFEMALE:Sir, perhaps you could get them to erect a fence.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:MAN 
SUPFEMALE:Always and forever Each moment with you Will, you're so romantic, I don't know why you have such a horrible reputation.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, you know, I'm really just misunderstood.
SUPFEMALE:You spend a little time with me, you'll see I'm actually pretty cool.
SUPFEMALE: Now, where were we? Why don't we just dance? MAN 
OTHERMALE:With a smile Take time Oh, I just love these romantic songs.
LEADMALE:Baby, this song is not even good enough for you.
SUPFEMALE:I could write you the best love song ever.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Let's hear it.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, you see, um I'm not really that good at thinking on my feet.
SUPFEMALE:Not yet.
LEADMALE:How about we play a little game first?
SUPMALE:Oh, cool.
LEADFEMALE:Here, have a seat.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what kind of game? We're gonna play cops and robbers.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, girl now Make it more better now I'm gonna be the cop and you're gonna be the nasty old robber.
LEADMALE:Just call me public enemy number one.
LEADMALE:So how do you like the game so far? Beat the hell out of playing Stratego with Carlton.
SUPMALE:Ow! That's kind of tight.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I mean, I know my rights.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'm entitled to one frisk.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up! Huh? I thought you were good, but you're not good.
LEADFEMALE:You've caused so much pain to so many women.
LEADFEMALE:You're just a dirty dog.
LEADMALE:And now it's payback time.
SUPFEMALE:Baby, you're kind of killing the mood.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! What are you, a psycho? You don't know how tired I am of hearing that.
LEADFEMALE:Huh?   Hello? Hey, hey.
SUPMALE:Nicky, it's Will.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Nicky, I need some help.
LEADMALE:I need you to get a grownup.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton! Nicky, I said a grownup.
SUPMALE:Carlton Banks here.
LEADMALE:Carlton, it's Will.
SUPFEMALE:I'm up at Lake Arrowhead with Lisa.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, she got me tied to a chair, man.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, stop bragging, you sick pervert.
SUPFEMALE:Who's a pervert?
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I'm just teasing Will.
SUPMALE:See, some girls are playing a trick on him at some cabin.
LEADMALE:What kind of trick?
LEADFEMALE:They're going to terrorize and torture him.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, don't worry, it's all in good fun.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:So Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Dirty Dog is trying to make a phone call, is he? So you mean to tell me for 5 extra dollars, I could get HBO? Okay, basic cable is cool.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you don't mind if I freshen up a little bit for you.
LEADFEMALE:What you doing? I just wanna look pretty for you.
OTHERFEMALE:And you do.
LEADFEMALE:You do.
SUPFEMALE:You know, I saw a great dress to go with that lipstick.
OTHERMALE:You did? Yeah, and you know what, if you untie me we'll drive down and get it before it closes.
SUPFEMALE:Do I look like a fool to you? No, not a fool.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait, wait, where you going? To get the dress.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Lord.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Ooh! Hot.
SUPMALE:Ooh! Hot.
OTHERMALE:Hot What did you just do? This.
LEADMALE:Think we can get away with this? I can't believe you two.
OTHERMALE:Mustard is not the answer.
OTHERFEMALE:No, she's right.
LEADFEMALE:Get the soy sauce.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Four!
SUPMALE:Wow, it's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:How you doing?
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Pleased to meet you.
LEADMALE:Hey, how are you? That will be $140.
LEADMALE:Jeez, I'm so sorry.
LEADMALE:You know, putting is the worst part of my game.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, nice sweaters.
LEADMALE:Oh, Marachi.
OTHERMALE:Our daughter bought them for us.
LEADMALE:She's got great taste.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Kareem, they're waiting for you on the tee.
OTHERMALE:Got to run, ciao.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Ciao.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, honey, the color of this sweater does compliment your eyes.
OTHERMALE:Well, it is comfy.
LEADMALE:Let's go get the stains out.
OTHERMALE:These are my role models.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes.
SUPFEMALE:How you doing there, Little Miss Mood Swing? Give me the keys to the car.
LEADMALE:Oh, now I'm never gonna get in.
SUPMALE:You need to be worried about getting out.
LEADFEMALE:Them rubber rooms ain't got no windows.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I am not crazy, okay? This whole thing was a sorority prank.
SUPFEMALE:They wanted me to teach you a lesson.
SUPMALE:In what, bladder control? No, respect for women.
OTHERMALE:Ugh! I cannot believe you sorority girls could be so devious.
LEADMALE:It was actually your cousin Carlton's idea.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah? You know what, I'm gonna pop that little zit when I get home.
OTHERFEMALE:You give me the car keys.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:What you crying about? You don't care.
LEADFEMALE:You're damn right I don't care.
SUPFEMALE:You damn near fricasseed me.
LEADFEMALE:But seriously, though, what you crying about? Will, the only reason I did this is because I wanna be a Kappa.
SUPMALE:So I guess that if I don't go through with this thing then you can kiss your pledge pin goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well.
LEADFEMALE:I deserve that.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I just want you to know that this is the best date that I've had in a long time.
LEADMALE:I mean, before I tied you up.
SUPMALE:Like I'm supposed to believe that.
SUPFEMALE:Pfft! For real? WILL 
LEADMALE:You're right, I'm so sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a dog.
SUPFEMALE:I'm the fresh prince of the pound.
LEADFEMALE:The doggiest of all dogs.
LEADMALE:Unbelievable.
LEADMALE:Will Smith apologizing.
SUPMALE:My sisters, welcome the newest member of Kappa Phi Gamma, Lisa Wilkes.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Hey, wait, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, hold up.
SUPMALE:What, y'all just gonna leave me hanging up here like a piece of Rotisserie Gold, huh?  What's wrong, Will? Rough weekend? Carlton man, listen, my date with Lisa didn't quite turn out the way I planned.
SUPMALE:Pray tell, why not? We got up there, the girl went crazy.
LEADFEMALE:She tied me to this chair, was trying to torture me.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:But I got loose, man.
LEADMALE:Then she really went off.
SUPFEMALE:So I grabbed this rock, man  and I Oh, my God, she's still up there.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, God.
LEADMALE:Oh, Lisa! Gotcha.
SUPMALE:No! No! Tell me you didn't.
LEADMALE:Oh, God.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Will, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, no! Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:How could you do that? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my Oh, God.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God, how could he do that? How could he do that? Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Mail call.
SUPFEMALE:Wall Street Journal for Master Carlton.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
OTHERMALE:A statement from The Bank of Bel-Air for Miss Ashley.
LEADMALE:And a plain brown package for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be taking my break now.
OTHERMALE:Bank of Bel-Air? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, bye.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:See you later, Ash.
OTHERMALE:Something's afoot.
LEADMALE:And something's a foot and a half.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm talking about Ashley.
LEADMALE:I know where every penny of this family's money is.
LEADMALE:And none of it is in the Bank of Bel-Air.
OTHERFEMALE:So? So, obviously, Ashley's hoarding money.
SUPFEMALE:And I know why.
SUPFEMALE:She's amassing a private fortune so she can buy out the family business in a hostile takeover.
LEADFEMALE:A sweater and a string of pearls and you'd be Angela Lansbury.
SUPMALE: 
OTHERFEMALE:Ouch! Shoot! Ashley, what are you doing? Changing for school.
OTHERMALE:See, um Today is, uh, casual day.
LEADFEMALE:Well, uh, that sounds like the, uh, truth.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, Will, I've been keeping a secret.
OTHERMALE:Lf I don't tell someone, I'm gonna explode.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me.
LEADMALE:If I know, I can't say I don't know when you get busted and Uncle Phil start rounding up the usual suspects.
OTHERMALE:And I am the usual suspects.
LEADMALE:I dropped out of Bel-Air Academy.
SUPMALE:I've been going to public school since the beginning of the semester.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't hear that.
SUPMALE:I said I dropped out.
SUPMALE:I heard what you said, Ashley.
OTHERFEMALE:Ash, what are you? How can you do that? It was easy.
LEADFEMALE:I forged all the papers took Daddy's tuition money and put it in an interest-bearing account.
SUPFEMALE:Pretty good, huh? You're tripping? No, no No, no.
SUPMALE:You're worse than tripping.
LEADMALE:You've fallen and you can't get up.
LEADFEMALE:And he will find out.
SUPMALE:And when he does, he's going to ground you into dust.
LEADMALE:Will, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's so fake at Bel-Air Academy.
LEADFEMALE:The teachers, the kids, the noses.
LEADMALE:I can't take it anymore.
OTHERMALE:Please don't tell Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:I ain't gonna dime you but if he subpoenas me, I'm gonna be singing like Luther.
LEADMALE:I'm in.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Will, come here.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:"Bank of Bel-Air"? How did you tap into those records? Well, I overrode the configuration files and deleted the encrypted password.
SUPFEMALE:Goodness.
SUPFEMALE:It's Hack Boy, the stubby-fingered avenger.
LEADMALE:Go ahead and joke.
LEADMALE:But sometimes you have to go around the law to expose the greater evil.
SUPMALE:Ashley's hiding $10,000.
SUPMALE:Now, where did she get that kind of money? Maybe she's Counterfeit Girl, the sister of Hack Boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, it's none of your business.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you just butt out? Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:She's already gotten to you.
LEADFEMALE:Trust no one.
LEADMALE:Will, I don't get it.
LEADMALE:My producer told me that I'm losing my black audience.
LEADMALE:I don't see why, Hil.
SUPMALE:I mean, you got the best talk show on TV.
SUPFEMALE:You really think so? Well, what was your favorite topic? Uh Uh, the one with the, uh Dysfunctional, uh, single parent, uh, gang member nuns.
SUPFEMALE:Hil, I've never actually seen one of your shows.
OTHERMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:Look, listen, Hilary, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:You need to do some stuff that reaches out to your brothers and sisters.
SUPFEMALE:Why? What have Carlton and Ashley ever done for me? Whoa, if it isn't Belly D.
LEADFEMALE:Williams.
LEADFEMALE:Just kidding.
SUPFEMALE:You look great.
LEADFEMALE:Where you all going? Fundraiser at the museum.
LEADFEMALE:Do I hate these things.
LEADFEMALE:Why agree to be on the Board of Trustees? Well, I'm a judge and judges are supposed to be on boards.
LEADMALE:Well, it's just that with you, it's usually a smorgasbord.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Mom.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Dad.
OTHERMALE:
LEADMALE:Hi, baby.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:Will, I need to talk to you.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:It's girl talk.
SUPFEMALE:Will, my homeroom teacher insists on meeting my parents.
LEADFEMALE:I've already canceled five times.
LEADFEMALE:She wants to see someone tonight.
SUPMALE:You're just gonna have to come clean with Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm waiting for the right time.
LEADMALE:And when is that? When we go shopping for my cap and gown.
LEADMALE:That's assuming that you're gonna live till graduation.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I need your help.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, let me sum this up for you in two 
LEADFEMALE:Unh-unh.
LEADMALE:You know, I didn't want to have to say this.
SUPFEMALE:But it's your fault I'm in this mess.
SUPMALE:My fault? Oh, this one here gonna be good.
SUPMALE:Before you showed up, I was leading a nice, sheltered existence.
LEADMALE:But you made me see there was a whole world beyond Bel-Air filled with people who take public transportation and don't have butlers.
LEADFEMALE:I like that world.
OTHERFEMALE:It's like a drug, Will, and you got me hooked.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you better go cold turkey before you wind up a dead duck.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, I'm sorry that you got yourself into this little predicament.
LEADFEMALE:But trying to blame it on me, now, that's just low.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe I said that.
LEADFEMALE:You've always been so good to me.
LEADMALE:I'm just so desperate.
SUPMALE:I'm a terrible, terrible person.
LEADMALE:No No, no.
LEADMALE:Look, don't cry, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on, all right.
SUPMALE:We'll figure a way out of this, all right? Thanks, Will.
SUPMALE:You're a saint.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Wait.
OTHERMALE:What was that? What? You smiled.
OTHERMALE:I saw your reflection in the window.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:That was a happy smile.
LEADMALE:See? I don't believe I fell for them tears.
SUPMALE:Girl, you're on your own.
SUPFEMALE:All right, fine! Be that way! But if I go down, I'm taking you with me.
SUPMALE:Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't do nothing.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:You wanna call your parents and see what happened? No.
LEADMALE:Maybe we should reschedule again.
OTHERFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Is there something you wanna tell me? Miss Sharpe
LEADMALE:the truth is I  Ashley.
SUPMALE:There's my little bran muffin.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Is this your father? Sure.
SUPMALE:Heh.
OTHERMALE:Miss Sharpe, this is, uh, Daddy.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:How could something so smooth be called sharp? Yes.
SUPMALE:Well, nice to finally meet you, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks.
OTHERFEMALE:Rhaul, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Rhaul.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and welcome back from the Orient.
LEADFEMALE:God bless you, Miss Sharpe.
SUPMALE:It is Miss Sharpe, isn't it?
LEADMALE:Yes, it is.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:You're a fine teacher, Miss Sharpe.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I bet you could teach me a thing or two  On the academic side, I mean.
LEADMALE:Well, will Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Banks be joining us? Uh, no, I'm single.
SUPMALE:I mean, um, Ashley's mother ran out on us.
LEADMALE:Ashley was but a mere tyke at the time.
SUPFEMALE:I had to be both Mommy and Daddy.
LEADMALE:We went from training wheels to training bras.
LEADMALE:They both came off too soon, didn't they kitten? Ha-ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, anyway, about Ashley's schoolwork.
OTHERFEMALE:You should be very proud of her.
LEADMALE:She does excellent work.
LEADMALE:She participates actively in class and she's just a pleasure to have around.
LEADMALE:You know, that runs in the family.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well.
SUPMALE:Ahem.
OTHERMALE:Do you have any questions? No.
SUPMALE:Not a one.
SUPMALE:Well, thank you for your time.
LEADFEMALE:What do you say we have the next meeting at my place, huh?
SUPFEMALE:Well, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:L
LEADMALE:Thanks for being so understanding.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:It's time for your pill.
LEADMALE:It's a miracle this whole thing worked.
LEADMALE:What you talking about, girl? Denzel ain't the only brother than can act.
LEADMALE:Well, at least this buys me some time before I have to break the news to Daddy.
LEADMALE:Well, I have to get my history books.
LEADFEMALE:You stay right here, Rhaul.
LEADFEMALE:I made that up.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Banks, did you forget something?
SUPMALE:Uh, you know, I'm glad you asked.
LEADMALE:I, uh, forgot to give you the number to my direct line.
SUPMALE:Look, I'm very flattered, but
LEADMALE:You know that is an absolutely intoxicating fragrance that you're wearing.
OTHERMALE:Uh Come closer.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a fake mustache.
OTHERFEMALE:No, it's not.
OTHERMALE:Yes, it is.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
SUPMALE:Look, I don't know who you are, but I'm calling your real parents right now.
LEADMALE:Will? No, it's not.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Miss Sharpe.
SUPMALE:It's not.
LEADMALE:You just had to go back.
LEADMALE:We were out the door, Will.
LEADMALE:We were free.
LEADFEMALE:Free! Look, ease up, Miss Tubman.
LEADMALE:Miss Sharpe gave us the weekend to break it to Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Now, let's go over this evil twin story again.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure the mayor's mother meant it as a compliment.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Then I should be honored that she thinks I look like a black Alfred Hitchcock.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, kids.
LEADFEMALE:Good evening.
SUPMALE:Wow.
SUPFEMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Dad, it's like this.
LEADMALE:Will has something he wants to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't got nothing.
OTHERMALE:Um Your Honor, uh now, before you deliver your verdict the defense dictates that you sustain the motion of the ocean.
SUPMALE:Because most parents want the truth, but they can't handle the truth.
LEADFEMALE:So in conclusion, I move for a change of venue.
LEADMALE:You give us a half-hour head start.
LEADMALE:What the hell are you talking about? Daddy, I withdrew from Bel-Air Academy six weeks ago and transferred to Morris High.
SUPMALE:You what? I'm not mad.
LEADFEMALE:You're not? And you thought he was gonna be mad.
LEADMALE:Well, you transferred out, you'll transfer back.
SUPFEMALE:Tomorrow when I wake up Ashley will be back in Bel-Air Academy and maybe Will won't even be here.
LEADMALE:Daddy, I'm not going back.
SUPMALE:Now I'm mad.
SUPMALE:You knew about this.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Will didn't do anything wrong.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, you tell him.
LEADFEMALE:If anything, I should thank Will.
OTHERFEMALE:He's the whole reason I transferred.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, whoa.
OTHERFEMALE:Pull it back, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Pull it back.
LEADMALE:Like I'm doing.
LEADFEMALE:Pull it back.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, Will made me realize how limited my life has been.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna be with real people with real concerns.
SUPMALE:Oh, and people in Bel-Air don't have real concerns?
LEADMALE:It's pronounced Porsche.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Porsche.
LEADMALE:Porsche.
LEADFEMALE:Porsche.
SUPMALE:Ashley, honey, you lied to us.
OTHERMALE:I knew you'd say no.
SUPMALE:But, honey, we just want you to have the best education possible.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Bel-Air Academy doesn't equal better.
LEADFEMALE:You and Dad both went to public schools.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, good point, Ash.
OTHERMALE:Can't we at least discuss this?
LEADFEMALE:I believe we just did.
LEADFEMALE:San Tropez.
LEADFEMALE:San Tropez.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I took your advice and reached out to our brothers and sisters.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Hello and welcome to Hilary.
LEADMALE:As an African American woman I'd like to dedicate this show to all my sisters.
LEADFEMALE:Presenting fashions from the motherland.
SUPFEMALE:Inga is wearing a hand-woven dashiki from Nairobi.
SUPMALE:Her jewelry is from the Ivory Coast and her weave is from Whoopi Goldberg's House of Hair.
SUPFEMALE:Work it, you Nubian princess, you.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha, ha.
OTHERMALE:Our next model is Buffie.
OTHERMALE:Um, Hil, I just I I really wanna commend your attempt to reach out to your African American viewers
LEADMALE:but you forgot one thing.
OTHERFEMALE:What? African Americans.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, she went to private school, didn't she? Touch√©.
LEADFEMALE:But there's a bigger issue here.
LEADFEMALE:People talk.
OTHERFEMALE:What if an admissions officer at Princeton found out my sister was going to public school? I mean, my God.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Daddy, I'd like you to meet someone.
LEADMALE:This is Miss Sharpe.
LEADFEMALE:She's my homeroom teacher at Morris High.
LEADFEMALE:Miss Sharpe, this is my father.
OTHERMALE:The real one.
LEADMALE:Thanks, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Pleased to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Same here.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you have a seat?
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:I thought if we met I could allay any concerns you might have.
LEADMALE:Well, Miss Sharpe you made quite an impression upon my daughter.
LEADMALE:But, with all due respect, I am thoroughly satisfied with the education Ashley is receiving at Bel-Air Academy.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps you're not aware of Morris High's academic achievements.
SUPFEMALE:I don't doubt that Morris High is a fine institution but I've already made my decision.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry to hear that.
LEADMALE:One of the things I've admired about Ashley is her open mind.
LEADMALE:Well, she gets that from her mother.
OTHERMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
OTHERMALE:Uncle Phil, the phone Ooh.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, listen, man.
LEADFEMALE:I can explain everything.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I was dizzy, then I came I was Uh, you must be Will.
LEADMALE:I'm Miss Sharpe.
LEADMALE:Oh, nice to meet you for the first time ever in life.
LEADMALE:Hey, you know, Uncle Phil, that's the first time I ever met her in life.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERMALE:Banks, we were profiled here in Education Today.
LEADMALE:Maybe if you read it, you'll reconsider.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to meet you.
LEADMALE:Sorry you had to drive out here for nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Nice to meet you for the first time ever in life.
SUPMALE:Whoo.
OTHERFEMALE:She really something, huh? Hard to say no to her.
LEADFEMALE:Not if you're a parent.
LEADFEMALE:Ahem.
SUPMALE:Hey, come on, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Be reasonable.
LEADFEMALE:When's the last time a teacher from Bel-Air Academy came to the house? Look, the girl went and changed schools behind my back.
OTHERMALE:Now, in this house, that constitutes a capital crime.
LEADMALE:But she had a good reason.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, my wife's nephew.
OTHERMALE:I want Ashley in Bel-Air Academy where there's a controlled environment.
SUPFEMALE:I know who's there.
SUPFEMALE:But, more importantly, I know who's not.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, I'm telling you.
SUPMALE:I went to both public and private schools and I'm saying in public school, it's more different kinds of people.
SUPFEMALE:In Bel-Air Academy, everybody cut from the same mold.
LEADFEMALE:If you ask me, you acting like a Snob.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna just go.
LEADFEMALE:And a one and a Hell with that.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:The forecast for the
SUPFEMALE:Philip, look here.
SUPFEMALE:Morris High School is fourth in the country among magnet schools.
OTHERMALE:Magnet schools? Maybe that's why they need metal detectors, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
OTHERMALE:This is important.
LEADMALE:Don't make jokes.
LEADMALE:Vivian, we've made our decision.
LEADFEMALE:We? No, you've made a decision.
SUPMALE:I'm a college professor.
OTHERMALE:You didn't even ask my opinion.
SUPFEMALE:Didn't I? I'm sure I did.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, honey.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think? I think we should at least consider it.
LEADMALE:Sometimes I think we work so hard to give our kids what we didn't have sometimes we forget to give them what we did have.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Will.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Ashley.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Good morning.
LEADMALE:What are you eating? Food.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Cutting the tension.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, everyone.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Hil.
SUPMALE:So, what's today's black topic? Amish rap stars? I'm through chasing one specific demographic.
LEADMALE:Thanks to my leopard skin midriff top, I hit an all-time high with male viewers.
OTHERMALE:I got more men yesterday than Sally Jesse Raphael gets in a year.
OTHERMALE:How hard could that be? 
LEADFEMALE:Where are you going?
SUPMALE:School.
SUPFEMALE:Since when do you wear a uniform to public school? What are you talking about? Your mother and I had a long talk last night.
SUPMALE:I called Miss Sharpe and made an appointment to check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if I'm satisfied with what I see, you can give it a shot for a semester.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Daddy, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:We're gonna be late.
SUPMALE:Go change.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Uncle Phil, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Oh, I'm trying to see how close I can get to your head without hitting it.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh You know, you're not doing a very good job.
LEADFEMALE:The next time you throw one of those at me, I'm gonna make you eat it.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, see, now see, now see, now you're in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in trouble?
LEADFEMALE:Uh-huh.
OTHERFEMALE:Now you're in trouble.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Whoo.
SUPMALE:If that's what happens for throwing a couple grapes at you Will, you know what I like about you? What? That I'm so romantic? No, that you're so goofy.
SUPMALE:Goofy, well Oh, you mean like in a suave, debonair, Denzel-ian kind of way, right? No, not really.
OTHERMALE:What? What do you mean? I'm, what, immature? No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:I mean that you're spontaneous and you're fun and, you know, goofy.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we just study? Let's just get back to studying.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
OTHERFEMALE:Your mom goofy.
LEADFEMALE:Attention, everyone.
LEADMALE:Attention.
LEADMALE:I have an announcement.
LEADFEMALE:My horoscope said that I will prosper in my house.
LEADFEMALE:So I figured I better go buy one.
LEADFEMALE:Hallelujah! Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, that's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Nothing fancy.
LEADMALE:No more than six or seven bedrooms.
LEADMALE:And I don't even care if it has a wine cellar.
OTHERFEMALE:For now.
LEADFEMALE:How are you going to afford a house like that? I have discovered a unique method of savings.
LEADMALE:I never spend my own money.
SUPMALE:By the way, Daddy, don't use your platinum card this month.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Let me get this straight.
SUPMALE:All this time, you've been hoarding your salary while feasting away on the family fortune? What do you say to that, big guy? All I heard is that she's moving.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey, good morning, G.
OTHERMALE:Good morning, Master William.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what's up, y'all? Listen.
LEADMALE:If you had to sum me up in, you know, like, one word how would y'all describe me? 
SUPMALE:Freeloader.
OTHERFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Undependable.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:He's not a freeloader.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Lazy.
SUPFEMALE:Of course he's lazy.
LEADFEMALE:He works for me.
LEADMALE:He's a freeloading, lazy bum.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Believe me, he's lazy.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:What?
OTHERMALE:I said one word.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, y'all.
SUPMALE:Like suave, debonair, strong.
SUPFEMALE:What's this for, Will? Well, you know, the other night, Lisa said I was kind of, you know, goofy.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Yes, that's it.
OTHERMALE:
SUPMALE:Exactly.
OTHERFEMALE:We're going to go with goofy, Will.
LEADMALE:How you doing, goofy?  Shut up, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Well, look, I don't know.
SUPMALE:Maybe Lisa tried to give you a hint.
SUPMALE:She calls you goofy.
LEADFEMALE:Next thing you know, she's not calling you.
LEADMALE:Yeah, right.
OTHERMALE:You think? Will, if there's one thing I know, it's about women not calling.
OTHERMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, baby?
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, listen.
LEADFEMALE:I'm off in 15 minutes.
SUPMALE:Oh, Will, I'm so excited.
LEADFEMALE:To hell with it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm off now then.
LEADMALE:You're so ridiculous.
SUPMALE:I'm excited because my friend Marvin got published in the op-ed section.
LEADMALE:Pfft.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, if I put my mind to it, I could write in any one of them old magazines.
SUPFEMALE:You don't need to prove to me that you're an intellectual.
LEADMALE:I like you just the way you are.
LEADMALE:What is that supposed to mean?
LEADMALE:Oh, just forget it.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:I cannot wait to read this.
OTHERFEMALE:The last article he wrote, ooh, it gave me goose bumps.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna climb into a hot bubble bath and get started on this right now.
OTHERFEMALE:See you later.
LEADFEMALE:A bubble bath? "Marvin, take me away.
SUPFEMALE:" I'm saying, how hard could it be to write a dumb article? I could write a whole book.
LEADMALE:What kind of book? A good one.
OTHERMALE:One that real people would wanna read.
LEADMALE:You know, with pictures and stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, a coloring book.
LEADMALE:No, I'm being serious, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:How hard could it be to write good?
LEADFEMALE:Well.
OTHERMALE:Well, what? Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
SUPMALE:Hey, Carlton, thanks for coming along.
LEADFEMALE:No problem.
OTHERFEMALE:The sooner you make money, you're out of the house and ultimately out of my life.
LEADMALE:Hey, man, what do you think of this title for my book? I'm gonna call it Celebrities' Houses At Night.
LEADFEMALE:I may have misjudged you, Will.
LEADMALE:You really are pulling out all the stops for this girl.
SUPMALE:Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:Your hair's neat, your nails are trimmed.
SUPMALE:You started flossing again.
SUPMALE:Hey, man, look, I even trim my nose hair.
SUPMALE:Check it out.
OTHERFEMALE:Nice job.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:It's just wild, man.
LEADMALE:You know, it's like Lisa's the first thought in my mind when I wake up in the morning.
OTHERMALE:The last thought before I go to sleep.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you know, I can talk to her about anything.
SUPMALE:You know, it's like her face has just been engraved inside my head.
LEADFEMALE:It's like, say I'm having a bad day.
LEADMALE:No matter what it is, just terrible.
SUPFEMALE:It's like, that first second that I see her beautiful face and she puts her arms around me I touch her lips it's like, just everything is better.
SUPMALE:Everything.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying, Carlton?  I sure do.
LEADMALE:Give me a hug, big guy.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton! 
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, what is wrong with you, man?
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:I just got caught up in the moment.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you get caught up in keeping your eyes on the road? All right, okay.
LEADFEMALE:Look, just take a picture of Bob Barker's house.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
LEADFEMALE:Look like Bob up in there getting his freak on.
LEADFEMALE:Bobby, come on down.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:All right, all right.
LEADMALE:Check it out.
LEADMALE:Listen.
LEADFEMALE:I even got a title.
SUPFEMALE:It's called Celebrities' Houses At Night.
LEADMALE:I'm not sure.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at this picture.
SUPMALE:How about this one? Look at Richard Simmons in his back yard cooking them big old stank sausages.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man, that one is gold.
LEADMALE:Look, kid, I gotta tell you, this picture doesn't really do it for me.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, look at it, it's too dark.
SUPMALE:Oh, see, you're not open.
LEADFEMALE:You're not open, man.
SUPMALE:I'm telling you.
LEADMALE:It's Celebrities' Houses At Night.
LEADMALE:Okay, look, look.
OTHERMALE:Kid, you got a nice idea here with the house thing.
LEADFEMALE:It's just not something I can get behind, all right? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:See, because you're not letting your cerebellum rotate.
SUPFEMALE:Listen.
SUPMALE:Look at this.
OTHERMALE:It's not just pictures.
LEADFEMALE:I wrote little stories with them too.
OTHERMALE:Bam! You didn't notice that one.
LEADMALE:See, it's different now.
LEADFEMALE:See, because I'm not just a photographer.
LEADMALE:I'm a photographer and a writer.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm ambidextrous.
LEADFEMALE:Nice try, huh? Maybe next time.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, fine.
SUPMALE:Maybe I am goofy.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, don't forget your pictures here.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Is this one Jay Leno?
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's him.
LEADFEMALE:What is he doing here? He was pouring some coffee in the sewer or something.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know, what does my story say?
LEADFEMALE:I could use this in one of my publications.
OTHERFEMALE:Really?
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, America loves Jay Leno.
LEADFEMALE:So, what, it'd be more like an article? Yeah, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:But I still get credit and everything, right? That and $500.
LEADFEMALE:Here, here, here.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to read this release form.
LEADMALE:Sign it when you're ready.

LEADMALE:Published? When did you start writing? Last week.
LEADMALE:Hey, look.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna give you some goose bumps too.
LEADMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, so where's the article?
LEADMALE:Let me see it.
SUPMALE:Eh, eh, eh.
SUPFEMALE:In due time.
SUPMALE:In due time.
LEADMALE:It's all a surprise, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hoo.
OTHERFEMALE:Lisa.
LEADFEMALE:Sweetheart, there's only one word to describe you.
OTHERFEMALE:Scum.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Man, you know the routine.
SUPFEMALE:When there's a sock in the door, you sleep on the lawn.
LEADMALE:Have you read this week's National Inquisitor? Man, I don't read that trash.
LEADFEMALE:Then how come you're writing it? Wait, wait.
LEADMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:They used one of my photos from my book and put it in here.
LEADFEMALE:"'Jay 
SUPFEMALE:Earth Enemy Number One' by Will Smith?" You sold pictures to a sleazy magazine like this? No, no, no, baby.
LEADMALE:I did not.
OTHERFEMALE:I sold them to a book publisher.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Jay Leno wasn't holding an oil can.
LEADMALE:He was holding a coffee pot.
SUPFEMALE:That guy tricked me.
LEADMALE:Well, at least I got paid.
SUPFEMALE:Master William, you have a visitor.
LEADFEMALE:Will Smith?
LEADMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:You're served.
LEADFEMALE:What? What's wrong, baby? Jay Leno is suing me for $10 million.
LEADFEMALE:How do you go from trying to make a little impression on Lisa to being sued by Jay Leno for $10 million? Um I'm goofy? But wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the victim here.
LEADMALE:That publisher took my pictures and used them for evil instead of good.
OTHERMALE:I mean, he like Hugh Hefner.
LEADMALE:And I'm an innocent young girl from the Midwest.
LEADMALE:And you expect me to clean up this mess.
LEADMALE:Well, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:You know the routine.
SUPMALE:I do something stupid, you clean it all up.
SUPFEMALE:The only difference is this time, I didn't do nothing.
LEADMALE:I think you've taken troublemaking to a whole new plateau.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:You gotta know somebody down there.
SUPFEMALE:A cameraman, a makeup girl.
SUPMALE:Maybe you sentenced one of the guys in the band or something.
LEADMALE:There is a bigger issue involved here.
LEADFEMALE:I can't keep pulling your butt out of the fire.
LEADFEMALE:You're right.
LEADMALE:You're right, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Look And this is the last two or few times.
SUPFEMALE:I promise.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Will, there comes a time Oh, not the "there comes a time" speech.
SUPMALE:I'd pay $10 million to not have to hear that again.
LEADFEMALE:I'd pay $10 million so I didn't have to say it again.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:If you don't wanna help me, just say that.
SUPFEMALE:I got myself into this mess, I'll get myself out.
LEADMALE:I don't need nobody.
OTHERMALE:Why don't I watch you handle this one, I'll get the next one, all right? I can't believe that that realtor wasted my time on that dump.
LEADFEMALE:That house was gorgeous.
LEADFEMALE:What's the problem? Problem? Well, for starters, the layout.
OTHERFEMALE:Say I'm having a small garden party for 50 of my closest friends and someone spills cocktail sauce on their Armani suit.
SUPFEMALE:My maid Hildegard would have to go through the gazebo into the living room past the library and up the steps to get to the laundry room.
LEADMALE:Hilary, that's ridiculous.
SUPMALE:You're right.
OTHERFEMALE:Who cares how far Hildegard has to walk? Is there anything I can do to help? Can you drive a getaway car? Master William, come quickly.
LEADMALE:They're talking about you on the telly.
OTHERMALE:PEOPLE 
SUPFEMALE:Save our sewers.
OTHERMALE:Save our sewers.
LEADMALE:Save our sewers.
SUPMALE:This is Andrea White of KFPB.
LEADMALE:It has been reported to the National Inquisitor that Tonight Show host Jay Leno is a toxic polluter.
LEADFEMALE:Will Smith is the young man who photographed Leno dumping oil into the sewer systems.
OTHERFEMALE:His story also alleges that Mr.
LEADMALE:Leno may be single-handedly responsible for destroying the rain forest, the ozone layer and the one tree that grows in Brooklyn.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that poor little tree.
LEADMALE:Forget that tree, Ashley.
LEADMALE:Come on, I'm getting railroaded.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I finally contacted Leno's lawyer.
LEADMALE:Yeah? What'd he say?
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm sorry, but it doesn't look good.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid you're liable.
SUPFEMALE:What is so funny? You're liable for libel.
LEADMALE:Get it? Those are homonyms.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, your next crack is gonna be in your head.
LEADMALE:Try it and I'll sue.
SUPFEMALE:Well I know what I gotta do.
OTHERFEMALE:He's not gonna do anything stupid, is he? You don't know him very well, do you? It's The Tonight Show.
LEADMALE:I'm doing the Bill Clinton McDonald's bit.
SUPMALE:It's my best joke.
LEADFEMALE:You're my agent.
SUPMALE:I'm the one who should be nervous.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call you after the show, okay? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Hey, bro.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? Have you seen Jay Leno? No, and I probably won't until I'm on stage.
LEADFEMALE:I'm John Ridley.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the comedian.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:So you're John Ridley.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, these are for you.
LEADMALE:They're from Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Leno.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADMALE:Listen, John.
SUPFEMALE:How long have you been a standup? About 10 years.
LEADFEMALE:Why?  I just hate this part of my job.
LEADFEMALE:What part? Dude, you've been bumped.
LEADMALE:Bumped? Listen.
OTHERFEMALE:One of Roseanne's other personalities showed up.
OTHERFEMALE:We have to let her keep talking.
LEADMALE:You gotta be kidding.
OTHERFEMALE:My family in Milwaukee will be watching.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a killer opening.
SUPMALE:That's show biz.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait a minute, I got this great joke about how I'm so pro-black I won't even pick the cotton out of a bottle of aspirin.
LEADFEMALE:I think I did you a favor, bro.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:But my family is gonna
LEADMALE:Security.
LEADFEMALE:Wait  Welcome back.
LEADFEMALE:My next guest is a young comedian making his first appearance on The Tonight Show.
LEADFEMALE:Please give a warm welcome to a very funny young man, Mr.
SUPMALE:John Ridley.
SUPMALE:Hey, how you doing? Hey.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, the other day, I just had this bottle of aspirin, you know.
SUPMALE:But I couldn't take it because I'm black.
LEADFEMALE:What I mean is, you know, the bottle had cotton in it, you know.
OTHERMALE:Get it? Cotton.
LEADMALE:I'm black.
OTHERMALE:Well, well, actually, you know, what I mean is Um 
LEADFEMALE:Hey, wait a minute, wait.
LEADMALE:This isn't John.
SUPFEMALE:Security! Hey, Jay.
LEADFEMALE:You got to listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the guy you're suing, Will Smith.
LEADFEMALE:The guy that's been putting the stuff in the paper?
LEADFEMALE:That's me.
LEADFEMALE:There's been a lot written about me.
LEADMALE:A lot of it untrue.
LEADFEMALE:And this seems to be the gentleman respon Come over here.
LEADMALE:Let's settle it right now.
OTHERFEMALE:You got two minutes to explain yourself.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:All right, tell us what's going on.
LEADFEMALE:Jay, listen.
LEADMALE:I was just trying to impress my girlfriend, Lisa.
SUPMALE:I like her a lot.
SUPFEMALE:I wanted to prove to her that I wasn't, you know, goofy.
SUPMALE:You, goofy? I can't imagine how she got that idea.
SUPMALE:What are you talking about?
LEADMALE:Me neither, man.
SUPFEMALE:I was putting together this book.
SUPMALE:It's called celebrities' houses at night.
LEADMALE:Good concept, right?
LEADMALE:Terrific idea.
SUPMALE:You know, what happened was, you know, I just wanted to show Lisa that I was special, you know? Because I just really don't wanna lose her because I really like her.
SUPMALE:And, well, the pictures I gave them to the guy, he was supposed to put out my book.
LEADFEMALE:He put it in the national inquisitor.
LEADFEMALE:I never meant for anything bad to happen.
LEADFEMALE:The pictures weren't for that.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, America, I just want you to know it was not oil, it was coffee.
OTHERMALE:Jay was pouring coffee out.
LEADFEMALE:It wasn't oil.
SUPMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, thank you, Smith, for clearing that up.
SUPMALE:I appreciate that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, my friends call me Will.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks a lot, Smith.
LEADFEMALE:I really appreciate that.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, that's kind of romantic, I think, though.
SUPMALE:I think I mean, what you You are goofy, and you are an idiot.
SUPMALE:That's beside the point.
LEADMALE:It's kind of a romantic thing.
SUPFEMALE:And maybe we should drop the suit.
LEADFEMALE:What do you think, audience?
LEADMALE:All right, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:You're off the hook.
SUPMALE:Thanks a lot, Jay.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, all right.

SUPMALE:No, no, not really.

SUPMALE:Did you just call me a big old Butterball? Nothing gets past you, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:You know, if you're going to comment on my girth you could at least put some thought into it.
LEADFEMALE:I beg your pardon, sir? Well, I mean there are just so many more interesting ways to say it.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you could be poetic.
SUPFEMALE:His corpulent flesh rolls around his bones like a thick chocolate pudding.
LEADMALE:Huh?  Or scientific.
OTHERFEMALE:He is so huge that food comes to him from the gravitational pull alone.
SUPFEMALE:Huh? Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Or you could be quizzical.
LEADFEMALE:Is that your head or is your neck blowing a bubble? You could be ribald, ironic, vaudevillian, whatever.
LEADMALE:But be creative.
LEADMALE:You got that? Anything you say, sir.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's up? Oh, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Uh, that elephant that trampled all them people called, he want his butt back.

SUPFEMALE:" Whatever the last bid was, you raise the paddle and double it.
LEADMALE:Give me that.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see what's in the other room.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be there in a minute, sweetheart.

SUPFEMALE:Y'all stay tuned for more Fresh Prince.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:I'm in middle of a holiday shopping season.
LEADFEMALE:Are you mad? I simply said I was considering it.
LEADFEMALE:He's here plenty.
LEADMALE:You can't do this.
SUPFEMALE:Money, we need money.
OTHERFEMALE:You know we can afford this.
SUPFEMALE:You're the one who helped me invest.
SUPMALE:My money makes money.
LEADMALE:We're rich.

SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Hi, kids.
OTHERMALE:Stop worrying, go to work, I'll handle your father.
LEADFEMALE:You don't know my father.
LEADFEMALE:He's very overprotective.
LEADFEMALE:Last time one of my boyfriends spent an evening with him it ended our relationship.
SUPFEMALE:So, what? You never saw the guy again? No, no one did.
SUPFEMALE:He left town.
LEADMALE:At least that's what my dad told the police.
LEADFEMALE:I think you're exaggerating a little bit.
LEADMALE:Okay, maybe a little.
OTHERFEMALE:But, just in case it's been really nice knowing you.
SUPMALE:Go on, girl, get out of here.
LEADMALE:Hiyah!
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:So you're meeting Lisa's father tonight.
OTHERMALE:4:30 from Cleveland.
OTHERFEMALE:I remember the first time I met Vivian's father.
OTHERFEMALE:He was an obstinate, dictatorial old tightwad.
SUPFEMALE:We didn't get along at all.
OTHERMALE:Really? Even with all that in common? I'm serious, Will.
OTHERMALE:Wasn't till the day he died that he did something to improve the situation.
SUPFEMALE:Really? What did he do?
LEADFEMALE:He died.
OTHERFEMALE:But the point is, first impressions can last forever.
OTHERFEMALE:You be careful tonight.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about me, I'll be myself.
SUPFEMALE:Let the charm take care of it for me.
LEADMALE:I don't think that's such a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Your charm is kind of an acquired taste.
LEADFEMALE:Like liver.
LEADFEMALE:You hate liver.
LEADMALE:Exactly.
LEADFEMALE:So, what? What, are you saying I shouldn't be myself? Let me just leave you alone with your thoughts.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:So that's still a possibility?
LEADMALE:A very strong one, honey.
SUPFEMALE:We have to do something about Dad.
LEADMALE:I've tried, but he likes that shirt.
LEADFEMALE:I mean we have to discourage this whole early retirement thing.
SUPMALE:You were all for it.
OTHERMALE:I was, but I've been thinking, if Dad has more time I'm the one he'll be spending it with.
OTHERMALE:His favorite what? His favorite child, his little girl.
SUPFEMALE:I thought it was obvious.
OTHERMALE:Well, think again, little sister.
SUPFEMALE:You are not Dad's favorite.
LEADFEMALE:That's right, Ashley, I am.
LEADMALE:You? Hey, it's a known fact that the oldest is always the favorite.
LEADFEMALE:Mom and Dad got it right the first time.
OTHERMALE:Then why did they keep trying? Well, you're both wrong.
SUPFEMALE:It's me.
LEADFEMALE:I make him money.
LEADMALE:And Daddy's little girl doesn't mean beans next to a chip off the old block which is me.
SUPMALE:And Nicky.
OTHERMALE:Nicky's only been around a few years, Daddy hardly knows him.
LEADFEMALE:It's me.
LEADMALE:A simple way to find out.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's will.
OTHERMALE:Whoever gets the most wins.
SUPFEMALE:That's ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:More money doesn't mean more love.
SUPMALE:We're all his children, right? Don't know, I'm starting to think you were adopted.
SUPMALE:Let's find that will.
LEADMALE:Hey, listen, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Wilkes, I want you to order anything that you want.
LEADMALE:Price is no object.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, I heard you the first six times.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You know, they're known for their lemon soup.
LEADMALE:Sir, that's a finger bowl.
SUPMALE:Oh, my fault, my fault.
OTHERMALE:Excellent.
SUPMALE:I don't know about this place.
OTHERMALE:See, I'm more of a pizza guy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, they got pizza.
LEADFEMALE:What do you want on it? What, a tandoori duck? Grilled pheasant? For 24 bucks, I want a 20-dollar bill on it.
LEADFEMALE:He said That is so It was fu So Lisa says you're an automotive technician.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I'm not.
LEADMALE:I fix cars.
LEADMALE:I manage a garage.
OTHERMALE:A garage.
LEADMALE:Wow, that is so interesting.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's not.
LEADFEMALE:It's a job.
SUPMALE:Hey, but I like working with my hands.
LEADFEMALE:It gives me the feeling I'm earning my money instead of having it just handed to me.
LEADFEMALE:I know the feeling.
LEADMALE:No, you don't.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Will, Lisa may like you but personally, I think you're a bourgie little toad.
SUPMALE:Thank you for a wonderful evening.
LEADMALE:I'll catch a bus back to Lisa's.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't leave.
OTHERMALE:This is This is not the real me.
LEADFEMALE:This is Carlton.
LEADMALE:Why you putting on airs, boy? Look, please? I like your daughter more than any other girl that I've ever been with.
SUPMALE:And believe me, I've been with Out of girlfriend for a long time.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I just wanted to make a good impression on you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, look, as long as we're being honest with each other I wasn't going to like you no matter how you acted.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, why not? Ever since the good Lord took my Yvonne my life's been pretty empty, Will, except for Lisa.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a little overprotective.
LEADMALE:Really? The real Will Smith ain't bourgie.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you, he's a low-class working stiff like yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Even lower.
SUPMALE:Hoo! Hey, I tell you what, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we get out of this joint and introduce me to the real Will Smith? Sounds good to me.
SUPFEMALE:Say, baby, you seen the real Will Smith? 
LEADFEMALE:Where did you learn to do this? The Young Republicans sponsored a seminar.
SUPMALE:Open sesame.
OTHERMALE:It's full of gold bars.
LEADMALE:Those are Twinkies.
SUPMALE:Hello, legal docs.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes.
SUPFEMALE:I see someone's coming into money.
OTHERMALE:We weren't taking any money.
LEADMALE:I meant me.
SUPFEMALE:All right, Geoffrey, what will it cost to keep you quiet? Considering the magnitude of this betrayal of your father's trust I'd say a thousand dollars.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's cool, we can handle that.
LEADMALE:No problem.
SUPMALE:A week.
LEADMALE:If you'll excuse me, I have to wash some dirty laundry.
LEADFEMALE:He has no scruples.

OTHERFEMALE:Because you've been so nice to my dad.
SUPMALE:You spent more time with him than I have.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, trust me, I am exhausted.
LEADMALE:Hey, let me tell you.
OTHERMALE:Your father followed me on my jog today, then he showed up in my lit class.
SUPFEMALE:Last thing I ever waan to do again is see a naked middle-aged man in the shower.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you that now.
SUPMALE:Let me tell you.
LEADMALE:Your dad is a great guy, but I'm kind of happy he's leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me about it.
OTHERMALE:I love when he comes to visit but we haven't spent any time alone in a whole week.
LEADMALE:Well, I think I can remedy that situation.
LEADFEMALE:There's a 747 with his name written all over it.
SUPMALE:Soon as we get him to the airport we can get back to my crib for a little one-on-one.
OTHERMALE:You know what I mean? You know what I'm saying? Well, my flight's on time.
LEADFEMALE:It was nice to meet you.

LEADMALE:K.
LEADFEMALE:Okay what? I'll stay.
OTHERFEMALE:Stay where? I'll stay with you for another week, maybe two.
OTHERMALE:Man, the way things are going, I might stay forever.
OTHERMALE:You cannot be serious about moving out here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm saying, won't you miss Cleveland? You've never been there, have you? Besides, this city makes me feel alive.
LEADFEMALE:And my little girl is here, and you, Will.
LEADMALE:Man, you're like the son I never had.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Daddy, remember Craig? Craig's too busy with his marriage and two kids.
OTHERFEMALE:He has no time for his old man.

SUPMALE:Whoo.
SUPFEMALE:Your brother's not busy, he's hiding.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, this is your fault.
LEADFEMALE:You are just too damn lovable.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, there's a character flaw.
LEADMALE:You have to do something, otherwise we'll end up spending the rest of our lives playing one-on-one-on-one.
SUPMALE:Maybe Daddy's password is some kind of food.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I tried every dish in Geoffrey's cookbook, nothing works.
LEADFEMALE:Unbelievable.
LEADMALE:What kind of idiot picks a password no one can guess? See, it's that kind of question that knocks you out of the running for Dad's favorite.
LEADMALE:Just keep a lookout.
SUPMALE:I told you this whole idea was stupid.
SUPMALE:Can you put disk back in the safe before Dad catches us? Too late.
SUPMALE:Do you even know what the word "lookout" means? Daddy, I am so sorry.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's settle this right now.
LEADMALE:Look, big guy Sir we just wanted to see what was in your will.
LEADMALE:I knew it.
SUPFEMALE:Never should've let you play with those Menendez boys.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, we just wanted to know who your favorite child was.

SUPMALE:See, it is me.
LEADFEMALE:Right now, it's hard to love any one of you, but I do.

SUPMALE:Look, look, here, woman, okay? I'm the man, and as the man, I said I'm gonna see the game.
LEADMALE:How dare you disrespect me in front of my father.

LEADMALE:Well, maybe I just will forget then.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Now, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe what I'm hearing.
LEADMALE:Maybe you should do something.
LEADMALE:You're damn right I should.
SUPFEMALE:Shame on you.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see how important this game is? How can you be so unreasonable? I raised you better.
LEADFEMALE:You really disappoint me, young lady.
LEADMALE:You really disappoint me.
LEADFEMALE:See you later, buddy.
LEADMALE:You know what? That's it, I can't take this no longer.
OTHERMALE:I got to do it tonight.

OTHERMALE:Hey, Will.
SUPMALE:Man, I was starting to get worried.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, nothing, nothing, everything's fine.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's not.
SUPFEMALE:I can see it in your eyes.
OTHERFEMALE:There's something you're not telling me.
LEADMALE:You're right, Fred.
SUPFEMALE:I can't go on pretending anymore.
LEADMALE:This just isn't working out.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean? You, me, us, this whole thing.
LEADMALE:It was great in the beginning but I just think we need to stop seeing so much of each other.
OTHERMALE:Will, is it something I did?
SUPMALE:Will, I can change.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's not you, Fred.
LEADFEMALE:It's me.
LEADMALE:It's me.
LEADMALE:I haven't been straight up with you.
LEADMALE:There's someone else.
SUPMALE:Oh, who is he? He's right over there.
LEADFEMALE:He taught me everything I know about sports.
LEADFEMALE:He's generous.
LEADFEMALE:He's caring.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, I'm sure he's a great guy.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I should be grateful for you at least being honest with me.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I should give you this back.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, I want you to keep it.
LEADFEMALE:To remember the game.
SUPFEMALE:I will, Fred.
LEADMALE:Well, it's been fun.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, it's definitely been fun.
SUPMALE:Hey, you be well.
OTHERFEMALE:You too, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Can I call you? I don't think that would be such a good idea.
LEADMALE:Well, at least, not right at first.
LEADFEMALE:You're a very lucky man.
LEADMALE:I talked to my dad today.
LEADFEMALE:No, he's staying in Cleveland, don't worry.
OTHERMALE:He's been spending a lot of time with my brother.
LEADMALE:Didn't take him long to forget about me, huh? He did not forget about you.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, he wanted me to give you a message.
LEADMALE:I'm not sure I understand it.
LEADFEMALE:What? Same game, next season.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, tell him it's on.
SUPMALE:Oh, look.
LEADFEMALE:There's a shooting star.
SUPFEMALE:Make a wish.
LEADFEMALE:Don't need to.
LEADMALE:You already came true.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Hilary, what are you doing? I'm putting tags on everything I'm taking with me.
OTHERMALE:Taking with you where? Oh, didn't I tell you? The other day when I went out to buy that sweater I bought a house to match.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, that's unbelievable.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.

LEADFEMALE:Carlton, that's Beverly Hills.
LEADMALE:Yeah, the bad part.

LEADFEMALE:You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? Yeah, yes I do.
LEADMALE:This weekend.

LEADMALE:How you constantly disappoint me.
OTHERFEMALE:What do we always do the first weekend after the new year? Your annual height check? After that.
LEADFEMALE:This weekend is our yearly bros-in-the-snow getaway.
LEADMALE:Come on, Will.
LEADMALE:We've gone on these trips the last four years running.
SUPMALE:I live for this weekend.
SUPMALE:Okay, Carlton, I am sorry.
LEADMALE:I forgot.
SUPFEMALE:All right? I'll go.
LEADMALE:Just go upstairs and wax your skis or your legs or whatever you wax.
LEADMALE:All right, I'll forgive you this time.
SUPMALE:Oh, this is going to be grand.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Asking Miss Lisa for permission? First of all, Benson, I ain't gotta ask nobody for permission.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Lisa.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Listen, babe, um, about our date this weekend Oh, Will, you know what, I just found out that I have to work.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, darn.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, I guess I'll just have to go on an annual ski weekend to Mammoth with Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Well, good, because when you're not busy, you know you get yourself into trouble.
SUPMALE:All right, baby.
SUPFEMALE:It's a shame you can't come with us.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I wish I could.
OTHERMALE:Well, wear your long johns.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I love you, baby.
LEADMALE:I love you, too.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:That was a pretty nasty fall you took there, Will.
LEADMALE:Fall? Pfft.
OTHERFEMALE:No, you must have been watching one of the other black skiers.
LEADMALE:Oh, these weekends really get my adrenalin pumping.
LEADFEMALE:How about some hot cocoa? Yeah, make mine a double.
OTHERMALE:Two cocoas please.
LEADMALE:One grande.
SUPFEMALE:Will, you remember when we first started coming up here? Uh Yeah, it was a weekend, wasn't it? I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
LEADMALE:I remember now.
LEADMALE:This place is always fly, man.
LEADMALE:Wait till you see what I got planned for the rest of the evening.
LEADFEMALE:After we power down our cocoas, there's a complimentary luge lesson.
SUPMALE:Followed by supper at 7, then back to the room for some hot spiced cider and a Barbara Walters Special.
LEADMALE:Normally, I would ditch you on that last one but, uh, I'm gonna let you in on a little something.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since I was like 7, I had a mad crush on Barbara Walters.
OTHERMALE:I thought I was the only one.
SUPMALE:How do you feel about Nancy Reagan? Oh, see now you're being just sick.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Nice parka.
SUPMALE:Down? Uh, no, it's a poly blend.
LEADFEMALE:Mine's alpaca.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Angie Cobb.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Miss Cobb, I know what you're up to and I'm not interested.
LEADMALE:You have eyes, take a look, I'm with him.
LEADFEMALE:This is our special weekend.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, good for you.
LEADMALE:Good for the both of you.

SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, admit it.
SUPMALE:You're going to miss me, aren't you?
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, Miss Hilary.
LEADMALE:In fact, I'm going to go upstairs right now and have myself a good cry.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, he's even more upset about my leaving than I thought.
LEADMALE:I hope he doesn't hurt himself.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPMALE:My big sister's moving out.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ashley, mi casa es your casa.
LEADFEMALE:You can come over any time you want.
LEADFEMALE:Except for Tuesdays when I shoot three shows and I really need my space.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and Thursdays.
SUPFEMALE:I shop till about 9 and then I take a warm bath and read.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you come over on Mondays between 11:15 and 2:30? Hilary, I'm in school.
LEADMALE:Well, if you can't find the time Another cocoa, Will? Oh, no, I'm gonna have to pass, C.
LEADFEMALE:I drink another cocoa, I mess around, I have to let out a Hershey bar.
LEADMALE:This is what life's all about.
LEADMALE:I mean, look around us.
LEADFEMALE:Is this not the best? Two guys together, beautiful surroundings, white snow, fresh air.
LEADFEMALE:God, look at those mountains.
LEADMALE:The hills are alive.
LEADMALE:You know, we should get away more often.
LEADFEMALE:Me and you, you and
LEADMALE:Lisa.
LEADMALE:Not Lisa.
LEADFEMALE:No offense, I know she's your girlfriend, but
LEADMALE:Hey, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.

SUPMALE:Smile.
OTHERFEMALE:Smile.
OTHERFEMALE:You can do it.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Look, this was supposed to be our special weekend.
SUPMALE:I don't wanna share you with some woman.

SUPFEMALE:What's up, baby?
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, why don't you go down and check out some of the shops? Uh, unless you wanna hang out with a couple lugers.
SUPMALE:Will, it was such a cold and lonely drive up here I just wanna go upstairs and get into a nice hot bubble bath.
LEADMALE:You do know how to pour bubbles, right?
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Um, hold that thought.

LEADMALE:Carlton, this is not your car.
LEADMALE:Then get out of my rental car.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Look, Carlton, come on.
SUPMALE:Now I'll never get to see that Barbara Walters Special.
LEADMALE:And she had Henry Winkler too.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, listen, man.
LEADFEMALE:You made me miss Fonzie.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, look.
SUPMALE:No, you look.
LEADMALE:No, slow up, deer.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you try to sweet-talk me, Will.
LEADFEMALE:No, Carlton, in the road, a deer!    Oh.

SUPMALE:Oh, wait, Sunday's bad.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'll cancel, I'll cancel.
LEADMALE:Your whole life does flash before your eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Which reminds me, you still owe me You want your 20 bucks? Okay, here it is.
SUPMALE:Now, go get it, you little car flipper.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? Making a mental note of where it is in case we get out of here, which we won't.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about?
SUPFEMALE:It's a 40-foot drop to that slope.
LEADMALE:Well, we ain't going that way.
LEADMALE:I'm climbing back up to the road.
SUPFEMALE:Will, that's sheer ice.
SUPFEMALE:Happen not gonna.
LEADFEMALE:Back in Philly, they used to call me Spider-Man.
SUPMALE:That was just one of my nicknames.
LEADMALE:So this is it.
OTHERMALE:This is how the Carlton Banks story ends.
LEADFEMALE:With a whimper.
LEADFEMALE:Shut up, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Help! Echo! Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho.
LEADFEMALE:Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hey.
SUPFEMALE:Hi-de-hi-de-Heidi-Fleiss.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, isn't it great about Hilary? When do you think I'll get to move out? Oh.
LEADMALE:Sweetheart, you know expressions like "when hell freezes over"? "When the cows come home"? "When donkeys fly"? Pick one.
LEADMALE:It's too dark to signal with that mirror, Will, you might as well put it down.
OTHERMALE:I've been trying to for, like, a half hour.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I want you to eat me.
LEADFEMALE:If I die first.
LEADMALE:You can stay alive by using my body for nourishment.
SUPFEMALE:Incidentally, the buttocks has the most meat.
LEADFEMALE:God, I hope I go first.
LEADFEMALE:Ouch.
OTHERMALE:God, man, my fingers are getting all numb.
SUPFEMALE:That's how it starts.
OTHERMALE:First numbness, then the sensation of needles on skin finally, right before death, violent spasms as your blood freezes and your heart locks up.
LEADMALE:No more Discovery Channel for you, man.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
SUPFEMALE:What Carlton, what? What?
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no! What, Carlton, violent spasms? Tell me what to do.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't get the insurance.
LEADFEMALE:What?
SUPFEMALE:I put the car on my credit card and I didn't get the $6 insurance.
LEADFEMALE:You always wonder why they ask you to sign that waiver.
LEADMALE:Well, there it is.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what's worse.
OTHERFEMALE:Dying a slow agonizing death or staying alive and listening to you.
OTHERMALE:Damn, it's cold.
SUPMALE:You know, Will? I don't have any friends.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about, Carlton? You got plenty of friends, man.
LEADMALE:You think people are your friends but they're only that because of what you can do for them.
LEADFEMALE:Except you, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I don't do anything for you.
LEADFEMALE:Even when you make fun of me I know you're doing it out of love.
SUPFEMALE:You haven't been doing that as much lately.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about, Carlton? I just called you Thumbelina this morning.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but your heart wasn't in it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Carlton let me tell you something, man.
SUPMALE:Lisa, that's my girlfriend and we're gonna be together, man.
LEADFEMALE:But that doesn't change the fact that you're my best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Stumpy.
LEADFEMALE:I'd cry, but my tear ducts are frozen.
LEADMALE:You know what? I ain't going out like this.
LEADMALE:All right, look, I figure if I can hit this slope at the perfect angle I could ski down and get us some help.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, Will, I'm a much better skier than you.
SUPMALE:Let me go.
SUPFEMALE:Go ahead.
LEADMALE:You'd let me jump like that? Hey, hey, hey, who better to risk his life for me than my best friend, huh? Huh? Wait, Carlton.
LEADMALE:I think I see somebody down there.
LEADFEMALE:We're saved.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, up here! I think he sees us.
SUPMALE:What? What did he say? I think he said, "Don't yell.
LEADFEMALE:" Don't yell?  Why not?  
OTHERFEMALE:Avalanche! 
OTHERMALE:You don't think anything bad happened?
LEADMALE:I'm sure they'll be back any second.
LEADFEMALE: What was that?  Hey, you know, you never know how brave you can be until you don't have no choice.
LEADMALE:Now I see how people could jump out of burning buildings.
LEADMALE:You couldn't figure it out before? Look, Lisa, we still have a full day left.
LEADMALE:Why don't we make the most of it?
SUPFEMALE:I would like that, Carlton.
LEADMALE:There's three of us now, we need to get another room.
SUPMALE:I have a room.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, isn't that great? Now you and I can stay together and Lisa can stay with her.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
SUPFEMALE:How could you not take the insurance? It only costs an extra $6.
SUPFEMALE:Sweetheart, in honor of your new house we've put together a little photo album for you.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Naugahyde.
LEADMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:You really went all out.
OTHERMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Just look at the pictures.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, here I am at Camp Gucciwanka.
SUPMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:Camp Gucciwanka? Oh, yeah, that's Apache for "over-privileged.
SUPMALE:" I drew a picture of the family, and that's you with the diamond.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna miss you all so much.
SUPMALE:Will, you take good care of that little lady.
LEADMALE:And, Carlton, you stay just who you are, I mean that.
LEADFEMALE:And, Daddy, don't worry, I still have duplicates of all your credit cards.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, little house.
LEADMALE:Goodbye, little yard.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, goodbye, little lamp.
LEADFEMALE:No, I could use this.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:One down, four to go.
LEADFEMALE:Take it easy, Philip.
LEADMALE:It's still about 13 years before our nest is empty.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Hey, guys, listen, me and Lisa about to run to Roscoe, get a little grub.
LEADMALE:Uh, Carlton, you wanna go? No, three is a crowd.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.

LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so, Carlton, what did you want? Stop.
LEADFEMALE:Don't move.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see you caress the syrup with your tongue.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you let me see you caress a Tic Tac with your tongue? When you are angry, your whole face, it has such character.
SUPFEMALE:Well, look, why don't you get up out of my character while I'm eating.
LEADMALE:I must rush to the easel while the hostility is still fresh.
LEADMALE:Daddy, why do we have to do a family portrait anyway? We're in transition, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:And I want a portrait to capture us as we are before we drift further apart.
OTHERMALE:By the way, Hilary, what are you doing here? Well, it's so dark at my house.
LEADMALE:None of the lights work.
OTHERFEMALE:You have to have the power turned on.
OTHERMALE:Call the electric company.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I tried, but the phone doesn't work.
LEADMALE:About this portrait, sir am I to be involved? Well, I don't know, I suppose when it's finished, you'll dust it.
LEADMALE:I hope he's not painting it tonight, a bunch of us are going ice skating.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, and I'm going to a Quayle in '96 Tupperware Party.

LEADFEMALE:Girls will be swarming like bees.
SUPMALE:Let them swarm on back because I got the queen.
OTHERMALE:Okay, but once the party starts buzzing, you're gonna wish your stinger was free.
OTHERMALE:All right, hold, hold, hold, hold on.
LEADFEMALE:The honey is always sweeter at the hive.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you know bees got to go from flower to flower.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, sir, but once they start pollinating, then they Happen Uh Look, can we just talk, please? Fine, fine.

LEADFEMALE:What about you Miss Nightie-Wearing, Popcorn-Popping, Dancing-To-Janet Well-At-Least-That's-What-I'm-Going Tell-my-Boyfriend, Little-Party-Freak? Will, I wanted to stay home, but my girls wanted to come out.
OTHERFEMALE:This ain't no trial, you don't have to explain to him.
OTHERMALE:Hush, puppy.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Guess who.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, honey, I don't know who you are but if you don't take your hands off my man you're gonna lose all that pretty hair of yours.
SUPFEMALE:Sheesh.
LEADMALE:Look, Lisa, sweetheart, why don't we take this discussion elsewhere.
LEADFEMALE:This is not a discussion, Will, it is a fight.
SUPFEMALE:And my jacket is in there.
LEADMALE:It better be.
SUPMALE:Come on, open the door, my girl's jacket is in there.
LEADMALE:Hey, Will, what's wrong, man?  Baby, no! I ain't playing with you, come on.
SUPMALE:Will, you have no right to drag me home, I am not a child.
LEADMALE:You're just a grown woman now, huh? Listen, Will, I didn't do what you think I did.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I don't even wanna think about what you think I think you did.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you know what, you're a regular old party girl now, Lisa.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you break it down for her.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:Well, let's see here, Ashley.
LEADMALE:Usually, at these parties there's a bunch of pathetic guys who have a good thing going on.
LEADFEMALE:But they think they're missing something so they go out scamming, looking for someone new.
SUPMALE:Think I can take it from here, Lis.
OTHERMALE:Thanks for the ride home.
LEADFEMALE:Fine, Will, you do what you gotta do and you take your time but we're gonna handle our business.
LEADMALE:Hey, don't everybody be walking away from me! Ashley! Listen, I am not playing with you, girl.
LEADMALE:What is your problem? It is none of your business, Will.
SUPMALE:Oh, I found my 15-year-old cousin locked in a bedroom with a linebacker and that ain't none of my business? Hey, man.
SUPFEMALE:Um, we was talking about this movie we had seen.
SUPFEMALE:Um, the movie we just came from it was about a linebacker and a fraternity.
SUPFEMALE:You know, and Larry Fishburne played the dean.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Is that the family room? All right, young lady, out with it.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't go ice skating.
LEADFEMALE:I went to a party.
LEADFEMALE:And, yes, I was with a guy, but we were just kissing.
LEADMALE:You have no business with a college fullback.
OTHERMALE:He was a linebacker, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Daddy, it wasn't just anybody.
SUPFEMALE:He used to go to Bel-Air Academy and I had a big crush Save it.
SUPMALE:There are not enough words in the English language to explain your behavior.
SUPFEMALE:My God, do you have any idea the kind of danger you put yourself in tonight?
LEADFEMALE:All my friends
LEADMALE:If all your friends jumped off the damn MTV building, would you do it? Do you have any idea where your daughter was tonight, Vivian? Hmm? At a fraternity house playing touch football in the bedroom.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, do you remember Andre Lawrence? The fullback? He was Ashley, go to your room.
SUPMALE:Mom, please let me
LEADMALE:You heard what your father said.
LEADMALE:But, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Go! You all right? I'm fine.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to recall what it felt like to be 15.
LEADFEMALE:So long ago, how could you remember? I'm just so upset that I'm saying things I don't even mean.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna go have a talk with Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sir, if you really wanted to teach Miss Ashley a lesson you could always have her taken out of the portrait.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss Ashley and I are about the same height it would be a simple matter of painting my head on her body.
SUPFEMALE:Phillip, Ashley's gone.
OTHERFEMALE:What? Take the back streets.
LEADMALE:I don't wanna be seen.
LEADMALE:Shut up and look for Ashley.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Lisa, what's up? It's me.
LEADMALE:Will, it is 1 in the morning.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:I just called you two minutes ago.
LEADFEMALE:Where were you?
OTHERFEMALE:I was asleep.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
SUPFEMALE:Sure you ain't just getting in? Just as sure as I'm about to hang up on you.
SUPMALE:How you gonna call me at 1, then ask me where I been? All right, all right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:My fault, my fault.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Ashley ran away and I just thought she might be there with you.
SUPFEMALE:No, you didn't.
OTHERMALE:Keep me posted.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:When we find Ashley, she's reimbursing me for gas.
LEADFEMALE:Where is she? Well, if it was me and I ran away from home I'd probably check into the Four Seasons and get a massage.
LEADFEMALE:Well, y'all should have seen Uncle Phil.
OTHERMALE:Dude just went straight loco.
LEADMALE:That big vein in his neck looked like an anaconda.
SUPFEMALE:Look, there's a method to my father's madness.
SUPMALE:If he came down hard on Ashley, it was for her own good.
LEADMALE:Man, you think everything your father does is right.
LEADMALE:Of course, don't you? Hell, no.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, Will's right.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy is way too strict.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he may be strict, but he's always fair.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, when you're a son.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sons are different than daughters.
LEADFEMALE:In your case, just barely.
SUPMALE:If you're referring to the size of my endowment, it's almost as large as Hilary's.
LEADFEMALE:God, I hope you talking about money.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I'll tell him.
LEADMALE:Sir, the precinct says they'll keep looking.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe she's out there somewhere, Vivian.
LEADMALE:Our little girl.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry, guys, we couldn't find her.
LEADFEMALE:Will, this is all your fault.
LEADMALE:My fault? Where else did Ashley learn such behavior? Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You're the one that chased Ashley out of here.
LEADMALE:How dare you talk to me like that? He dares because he doesn't respect you.
LEADFEMALE:Neither of them do.
LEADFEMALE:What a crock.
LEADMALE:How you go and just tell a bold-faced lie like? HILARY 
OTHERMALE:Carlton, Will is right.
LEADMALE:Daddy is way too strict.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Right, you think everything your father does is right.
LEADMALE:
OTHERMALE:Of course, don't you? 
SUPMALE:Hell, no.
OTHERFEMALE:And listen to this from last week.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, man, what is wrong with you? Hey, what up, Ash? Hi, Will.
LEADFEMALE:You mean we've been out running all over this city looking for you and you've been up in here? Well, I did run away.
LEADFEMALE:But there are some weirdoes out there.
LEADFEMALE:You know something, this is all your fault.
SUPFEMALE:What is that, like, the theme of this family? "When in doubt, blame Will.
LEADMALE:" If it wasn't for you, Daddy would never have found out about that party.
OTHERMALE:Ashley, that still doesn't mean that you should have been there.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, listen, college boys are like predators.
OTHERMALE:You know, they prey on innocent little high school girls like you.
LEADMALE:They're like piranha, Ashley.
LEADMALE:And you're 110 pounds of teenage chum.
OTHERFEMALE:A hundred and eight and I'm not as innocent as I look.
LEADMALE:All right, I am.
LEADFEMALE:Well you ready to walk that last mile? Will, I didn't do anything.
LEADFEMALE:The Lord is my shepherd Hey, everybody, look what I found.
LEADMALE:Are you okay? Yeah, I'm all right.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, we've got a bit of a volatile situation here.
OTHERFEMALE:A powder keg if you will.
SUPFEMALE:A mishandling of this situation could have repercussions that will reverberate forever.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian call your sister and tell her she's about to lose her only child.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna call her and tell her myself.
LEADFEMALE:Look now, I could ground you forever.
LEADMALE:I could put bars on your windows, I could put locks on your doors.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy
LEADMALE:Don't "daddy" me.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you have any idea what you put this family through? Running around doing God knows what with God knows who.
OTHERFEMALE:If I'd have asked, you wouldn't have let me go.
LEADMALE:You're darn right.
SUPMALE:You're 15 years old.
OTHERFEMALE:You have no business at a party with college boys!
LEADFEMALE:All my friends were there.
LEADFEMALE:Your friends don't live here! I can't do this.
SUPMALE:You talk to your daughter.
SUPMALE:I'm done.
LEADMALE:You guys hate me.
OTHERFEMALE:Ashley, if that were true, we wouldn't care when you did something foolish like this.
LEADMALE:What you have to understand is that we know what's best for you.
LEADFEMALE:It may not seem like that now, but one day you'll understand that.
LEADFEMALE:End of discussion.
SUPMALE:Mom, don't you understand? Yes, I understand.
LEADMALE:I understand you lied and you ran away.
LEADFEMALE:And another thing as long as you live in this house, you will follow our rules.
SUPFEMALE:That's it! Mom.
LEADMALE:Ashley, I understand what you're feeling.
OTHERMALE:But you have to consider the seriousness of what you did.
LEADMALE:You really hurt us this evening.
SUPFEMALE:All I want is for you to trust me.
LEADMALE:Trust is a very fragile thing and you're gonna have to start earning it all back.
SUPFEMALE:I messed up really bad.
LEADFEMALE:We'll talk about it tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:Mama, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I saw Ashley's tutor leaving.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, they're actually gonna let Ashley eat tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's what happens when you lie.
LEADMALE:You gotta be punished.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you think your punishment should be? Oh, I don't know.
SUPMALE:I think it should hurt.
LEADMALE:I think it should really teach me a lesson.
LEADMALE:And I should be wearing some kind of hat.
LEADMALE:You are sick.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, no hat.
LEADMALE:I think people lie because the truth hurts.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Like, take this jacket you're wearing.
LEADMALE:What about this jacket? I love it.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE: Ashley.
LEADMALE:What's up, Nicky? 
SUPMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, you have paper on your cheek.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Nicky, he cut himself shaving.
SUPMALE:Why do you shave and Ashley doesn't?  Well, you know, it's because guys grow beards and some women don't.
LEADMALE:You know, when you become a teenager, guys start to grow hair on their face and women start to grow, you know, they be
LEADMALE:Taller.
LEADMALE:Ooh, you are right.
LEADMALE:Taller.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Why? You are really asking a lot of questions, Nicky.
OTHERFEMALE:Nicky's at that age.
LEADFEMALE:He's like an empty vessel waiting to be filled with knowledge.
OTHERMALE:Has anyone seen my Vogue magazine? The one with that supermodel Tyra on the cover.
LEADMALE:Hilary, that's 2 years old.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey threw it away.
LEADFEMALE:Why? And some vessels just stay empty.
LEADFEMALE:It says here in this magazine when decorating a home, price should be no object.
LEADMALE:The more money you spend the better.
LEADFEMALE:What magazine is that? Rich People's Digest.
LEADMALE:I got a subscription.
SUPFEMALE:If I'm gonna be decorating my new house, I need all the help I can get.
LEADFEMALE:This is a beautiful color for your drapes, honey.
LEADMALE:Yeah, if you're a hotel in Vegas.
LEADFEMALE:Plus, look at the price.
OTHERFEMALE:This is very reasonable.
SUPMALE:Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:I think it's too heavy.
SUPMALE:All right, let's lighten the load a little.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, yo, man, why I gotta carry everything anyway? Simple, Will, some of us are born owls and some of us are born mules.
SUPFEMALE:Guess which one you are.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Well, I must be one of them owl-killing mules, then.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Okay, I have chartered our trails.
LEADFEMALE:We're gonna hike in just below Limestone Falls then we're gonna raft down the Rocky Point and we're gonna spend our last night at Two Arches.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
SUPMALE:Them arches better not be golden.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, on this trip, it's just us and the elements.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh-heh.
LEADMALE:We're gonna be roughing it like frontiersmen.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, incidentally, sir the limousine will be here to pick you up at dawn.
LEADMALE:Great, I'm gonna go stuff my fanny pack.
LEADMALE:Looks like somebody beat him to it.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you guys.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Lisa.
LEADMALE:I brought the sleeping bag.
OTHERMALE:
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Mwah, mwah, mwah.
LEADMALE:Ooh, look at all this stuff.
SUPMALE:Yeah, we believe in being prepared.
LEADMALE:For what? Hm.
OTHERFEMALE:Bad weather, snakes, global thermal nuclear war, you know.
LEADMALE:I tried to tell puny the bear this is too much stuff.
LEADMALE:I mean, come on, why are we taking wood? Hello? Campfire? Carlton, I'm telling you, man, I'm not carrying all of this stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:What do we need this dumb box for? That's not a box, it's a raft.
LEADMALE:It seats six.
OTHERFEMALE:Hm.
LEADMALE:How many Uncle Phils? Wait, do you expect me to believe there's a raft inside this box? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:But whatever you do, don't pull the cord.
LEADMALE:Damn.
LEADMALE:There was a raft in that box.
SUPFEMALE:Ain't my fault your stupid hurricane lamp got broken.
OTHERMALE:Well, if you hadn't inflated the raft, it wouldn't have fallen over.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll pay you for it but the stupid thing can't be worth more than $60.
LEADFEMALE:It had a built-in bug zapper.
LEADMALE:And it cost 80.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll give you 60 for it.
OTHERFEMALE:Eighty.
LEADFEMALE:Sixty.
LEADFEMALE:Eighty.
SUPFEMALE:Eighty.
OTHERFEMALE:Sixty.
OTHERFEMALE:You got a deal, Daffy.
LEADFEMALE:Cute, Will.
LEADMALE:Tell you what, I'll take your $60 and I'll get the rest from your wages at the Peacock.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Let's have the money.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:All right, hey, hey.
LEADFEMALE:It's cool, dude.
LEADMALE:Carlton, give him the money.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, that's all we got, man.
LEADMALE:That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:I got more in my wallet.
LEADFEMALE:Take your hands out of your pockets!  Mommy, why are you crying? Because Will is hurt, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Why?
LEADFEMALE:I don't know why.
LEADMALE:Nicky, come on, let's not bother Mommy.
SUPMALE:Oh, he's not bothering me, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna make sure he's going to be comfortable.
LEADFEMALE:We're doing everything we can for him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, those white sheets can get so dingy.
LEADMALE:Don't you have any nice pastels? That's not our major concern at this point.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERMALE:Well, what about television? He's not gonna just have basic cable, is he? Miss, that is the waiting area.
LEADMALE:Now, I know this is difficult but why don't you just go over there and wait.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, do you wanna talk about it? He was aiming at me.
LEADMALE:Vivian.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Vy.
LEADFEMALE:Where's my boy? Heard anything? Nothing has changed since you called from the airport.
OTHERMALE:Aunt Vy, Will's in the recovery room.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Um, excuse me, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Smith?
LEADMALE:Lisa?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Hi, sweetheart.
OTHERFEMALE:Vy.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Philip.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I talked to the doctor.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Yes? Will's in stable condition.
SUPFEMALE:Now, the bullet was very close to his spine, but they got it.
LEADFEMALE:Thank God.
SUPFEMALE:There's a possibility there may be nerve damage.
OTHERFEMALE:But let's pray there isn't.
LEADMALE:They'll move him to a private room.
SUPFEMALE:Can we see him?
SUPFEMALE:I made a deal, we can see him now but we're gonna have to go home after.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Well, apparently, we're driving the nursing staff crazy.
OTHERMALE:I don't understand, I'm just a visitor, why do I need medication? And what is Prozac anyway? I mean, do you think I need this? I feel fine.
LEADMALE:Hi, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Mom, you ain't have to come all the way out here.
SUPMALE:Stop it, now, I'm just glad that you're okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Ahh.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Just think, I moved out here from Philly because we thought it was too dangerous.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Oh, Will.
SUPMALE:Hi, Will.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:How are you, son? Dude, what's up? Hey, don't be looking at me like that.
LEADFEMALE:Y'all know ain't no little bullet gonna stop me.
SUPFEMALE:However, I will be doing my banking by mail from now on.
LEADFEMALE:Knowing my luck, I'll run into a disgruntled postal worker.
SUPMALE:Are you in pain, son? Well, it ain't as bad as the last time Geoffrey made chili.
LEADFEMALE:I guess you won't be wanting this, then.
LEADFEMALE:I hate this generic stuff.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna get you an Evian.
LEADMALE:Hey, Ashley, what are you doing all the way over there, girl? I'm scared to touch anything.
SUPMALE:I don't wanna pull anything out.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, girl, get over here and give me a hug.
LEADMALE:Aagh!
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my gosh! Psych.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe you guys think this is some kind of joke.
OTHERMALE:Don't you realize what happened? Will took a bullet for me.
LEADFEMALE:He saved my life.
SUPFEMALE:I did? I was just trying to get the hell out the way.
OTHERFEMALE:Will, stop it, I don't think it's funny.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, come on, man.
LEADMALE:We gotta have a sense of humor about this.
LEADMALE:This kind of stuff happens all the time.
SUPFEMALE:That's the problem.
LEADFEMALE:It happens all the time.
LEADFEMALE:I'm, uh, gonna go talk to him.
OTHERMALE:Son, where are you going? 
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPMALE:I'm going for a walk.
LEADFEMALE:It's after midnight.
LEADMALE:I don't need something to happen to you.
SUPFEMALE:Well, there's nothing you can do about it.
OTHERFEMALE:These things just happen, right? Carlton, I know you're upset.
LEADMALE:You've been through a traumatic experience.
LEADFEMALE:Now, if you just calm down, we can talk about this rationally.
LEADFEMALE:You're always in control, aren't you? Always know what to do, always know what to say.
SUPFEMALE:You know what gets me? The police aren't gonna find this guy.
LEADFEMALE:And if they do, so what? He'll be out in six months.
LEADFEMALE:That's not gonna happen.
SUPMALE:It's happened to people.
LEADMALE:But the legal system isn't perfect.
LEADMALE:Go talk to Will about our legal system.
SUPMALE:It's such a joke.
LEADMALE:People aren't even afraid of it.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I'm frustrated too.
SUPFEMALE:But as a judge, I have to have faith in it no matter how much I wanna go out and knock some heads.
LEADFEMALE:Eventually the system will come through.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm all grown up, Dad.
SUPMALE:Don't tell me any more fairy tales.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, Mom, Mom.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm fine, thank you.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:I'm just trying to make sure my baby's comfortable.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm as comfortable as I can be sitting on a bedpan.
OTHERMALE:Well, you want me to?
LEADMALE:Don't go peeking at my stuff, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you, baby.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:How's that?
OTHERMALE:Oh, baby, that's perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I see there's a new pillow fluffer in town, huh?
LEADFEMALE:Where's Carlton?
OTHERFEMALE:He just wanted to let off a little steam.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the car, madam.
LEADMALE:Chin up, Master William.
LEADMALE:Get better, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Ow! Ooh, psych, psych, psych.
OTHERMALE:Stop that.
SUPMALE:We'll see you tomorrow, son.
LEADMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:Oh, is Carlton gonna be cool? Oh, yeah, he's fine.
LEADMALE:I'll talk to him when he gets home.
LEADMALE:You get some sleep.
SUPMALE:Pfft.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know if I can get any sleep the way that thing is here beeping.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if it stops beeping, you're gonna sleep a lot longer than you planned.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:You coming home, Vy? No, no, I'm gonna stay right here with my baby.
LEADMALE:Go back to the house.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need nobody babysitting me.
LEADMALE:Well, you're not getting rid of me that easily.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, baby, I'm too weak to fight.
LEADMALE:You can stay.
SUPMALE:All right, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
LEADFEMALE:I love you, Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:You'll get used to it, baby.
LEADFEMALE:I guess he told you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, shut up.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am I glad they're gone.
LEADMALE:How do you feel, Will? Well, you know how they say a paper cut is the worst kind of pain? Eh! Eh! Wrong.
OTHERMALE:You don't have to do that.
LEADMALE:Do what?
SUPFEMALE:Entertain me.
LEADMALE:Did you hear the one about the black dude that got shot at the ATM? And how he was trying to be freaky with his girlfriend in the hospital room? Stop.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, look out.
SUPMALE:Look out, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Will.
SUPMALE:Baby, it's okay, wake up.
OTHERFEMALE:It's okay.
SUPMALE:I'm glad you're here, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, time for breakfast.
LEADMALE:Shh, shh, shh 
SUPMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADMALE:Isn't it hard to follow that show with the sound off? Oh, no, this is What's Happening!! I know all these jokes by heart.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, check it out, look, look, look.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Dwayne, Rerun ate my mama's cake.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:Dee, Dee, please don't tell your mama I ate her cake.
LEADMALE:Okay, Rerun, for Dee right price.
OTHERMALE:You're good.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that ain't nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:You should see my Webster.
LEADFEMALE:What exactly do you want her to see?  Hey, what's up, babe? Are you rested? Yeah, I must have been tired.
OTHERMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:You was talking in your sleep last night.
OTHERFEMALE:You always dream about Shaka Zulu? Shut up, Will.
LEADMALE:Oh, isn't that nice.
LEADMALE:Would you like me to read the card?
SUPFEMALE:No, I'll thank Jazz later.
OTHERMALE:I'll take it.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, what's up, man? I'm glad you came back.
LEADFEMALE:Can you show me where I can get coffee?
LEADFEMALE:Sure, right this way.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:So, what's up, man? Are you gonna be all right? Still can't get over it, Will.
LEADMALE:If you hadn't pushed me, that bullet would have gotten me.
OTHERMALE:Well, not necessarily.
LEADFEMALE:See, even if you stood right in front of me he still could have hit me from my belly button up.
LEADFEMALE:I'm totally in your debt, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Pfft.
SUPMALE:Come on, you don't owe me nothing.
LEADMALE:Yes, I do.
LEADFEMALE:If you ever need anything, anything, it's yours.
SUPFEMALE:Well, uh you could talk to Uncle Phil about, you know, sliding me into his will.
OTHERMALE:Forty, 50 G's, you know? Actually, my father and I aren't seeing eye to eye right now.
LEADFEMALE:I feel like everything he's ever said to me was a lie.
OTHERMALE:Come on, Carlton, that's a little hard, don't you think? I spend my life believing in law and order, following the rules.
LEADFEMALE:Then some maniac pulls a gun and all the rules change.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm sick of being a follower, sick of being a victim.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna start making some rules.
LEADMALE:Carlton, wait.
LEADFEMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:Give me a hug.
OTHERMALE:What? I said give me a hug, man.
SUPMALE:A brother get shot, he get a little emotional.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, get over here and give me some love.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:What is that? It's a gun.
SUPMALE:Carlton, are you out of your mind? You're walking around carrying a gun?
SUPMALE:What are you gonna do with that?
LEADFEMALE:It's for protection.
SUPMALE:Carlton.
SUPMALE:Whoa, man.
LEADMALE:What, do you think it's that easy to just shoot somebody? I'll close my eyes.
SUPMALE:I was gonna eat that, man.
SUPFEMALE:Everything's a damn joke to you.
LEADMALE:So, what, you don't think I'm mad, huh? I'm laying up in this hospital an inch away from being paralyzed.
SUPFEMALE:You don't think I wanna get up and catch It's not gonna happen again, not to me.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:I understand that you're scared, man but the world can be a scary place.
LEADMALE:You just got to learn how to deal with it.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, I found my way.
LEADMALE:That's not you, man, that's them.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I didn't come here for your approval, all right? I came here to see how you were.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm out of here.
LEADMALE:Carlton No more hugs, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I saved your life, man.
SUPFEMALE:I saved your life.
OTHERMALE:You owe me! Now, give me the gun, Carlton.
SUPMALE:Give me the gun.
LEADMALE:I saved your life.
OTHERFEMALE:I want the gun.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Thank you, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, man, this week has been hell.
LEADMALE:Remind me to never get shot again.
SUPFEMALE:It's always hard the first time.
SUPMALE:I remember mine.
LEADMALE:I'd forgotten how much Jewel hates anchovies on her pizza.
LEADMALE:Well, the rest you can guess.
LEADMALE:Good morning, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Lisa.
OTHERFEMALE:Jazz.
LEADMALE:Oh, my goodness, Nurse Avner, you might wanna hurry up and go change.
LEADMALE:Nurse Sigmund has on the exact same outfit.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I have a special going-away present for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, I'm on such a natural high from getting up out of here I'm sure my arm won't feel a thing.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I think that's a safe bet.
SUPMALE:Woo.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Have a nice day.
OTHERFEMALE:Check it out, Will.
LEADMALE:I'm the black dude on ER.
LEADMALE:Jazz, that is not a toy.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't have to be a toy to be fun.
SUPMALE:Check this out.
LEADFEMALE:Clear.
SUPMALE: Remember, just because you're going home, doesn't mean you can slack off.
LEADFEMALE:The harder you work, the faster you'll regain use of your leg.
OTHERMALE:You think I'll ever be able to slam-dunk?
SUPMALE:Sure you will.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, cool, because I never could before.
LEADMALE:I'll see you in therapy tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, baby, I packed your books and your Walkman.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:And this cute little backless gown that you just looked so good in.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Is there anything else I can get?
LEADFEMALE:Uh, just my stuff in the bathroom.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:And don't forget my Magic Shave, baby.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Tss.
LEADMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Will, you fell?
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I fell, unh in love with you, baby.
SUPMALE:Lisa, will you marry me? Marry you? Will, did you take another one of those yellow pills? I'm serious, Lisa.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you've been right here with me all through this thing.
SUPFEMALE:The first face I saw every morning, the last face I saw every night.
LEADMALE:I just want that to go on forever.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I don't know what to say.
LEADFEMALE:Your face says it all, baby.
OTHERMALE:Hey, listen, we should probably Ah.
SUPFEMALE:We should probably keep this thing a secret, just spring it on people at the right time.
SUPFEMALE:Then it's gonna blow them away.
LEADMALE:It sure is.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, babe, I'm sorry I don't have a ring for you.
SUPMALE:I can give you this one around my collar.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Ready to go?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, Hil, where's everybody else at?
LEADFEMALE:Well, they're all at home.
LEADMALE:It's just me.
SUPFEMALE:WILL & 
SUPFEMALE:Don't touch that! Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, Hil, on my big day, I thought that everybody would be here.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's not their fault.
LEADMALE:They're setting up for your surprise party.
OTHERFEMALE:They're giving me a surprise party? Well, now that you dragged it out of me.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Well, come on, y'all, let's go.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Let me practice.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, wait, babe, hold up.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I forgot to sign those release papers.
LEADFEMALE:Hil, could you buzz the nurse for me, please? 
SUPFEMALE:No, not that one.
LEADFEMALE:There has got to be an easier way to call the nurse.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, honey, I don't think what you're doing is good for you.
LEADMALE:And I don't think what you're doing is good for anybody.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Psht.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Babe, listen.
SUPFEMALE:Ahem.
OTHERMALE:May I have everyone's attention, please? You are not gonna announce it in front of all these people.
SUPMALE:Come on, baby, don't be shy.
LEADMALE:Here, take this, take this.
LEADFEMALE:Now, as you all know there's a person in this room who's very, very special to me.
LEADFEMALE:A person who's warm, caring and extremely sensitive.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I love you too, Will.
SUPMALE:Go sit down.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, all right, there's two very special people to me.
LEADMALE:Anyway, as I was about to say, I have a little announcement to make.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I don't think that
OTHERMALE:Oh, you're right, baby.
LEADFEMALE:We have an announcement to make.
LEADFEMALE:Me and Lisa are getting married.
OTHERFEMALE: What?
OTHERMALE:Will, that's great.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
SUPMALE:You know, this precludes any possibility of us getting together.
LEADFEMALE:To do what? Good seeing you again, Lisa.
LEADFEMALE:Well, ha, ha that's really news.
OTHERMALE:Since you're gonna get married maybe you and I should have that man-to-man talk in the kitchen, huh?
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:Right now, Uncle Phil?
SUPFEMALE:Sure, okay.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations, Lisa.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Lisa, I want you to know that Will's as proud of you as I am of my sweet little bride, Jewel.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Jazz, that's nice.
LEADMALE:Um, by the way, where is Jewel? Her ex-cellmate broke out.
LEADMALE:They're having dinner.
LEADMALE:Will, what is all this? It's too soon for you to get married.
LEADMALE:Hilary's right.
LEADFEMALE:Did I say that? I mean, come on, I'm still decorating my new house.
LEADFEMALE:When would I have time to buy you a gift?  Isn't anybody gonna congratulate me? Yeah, yeah, come here.
SUPMALE:My foot wants to congratulate your butt.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, no way are you ready for marriage.
SUPFEMALE:How are you gonna support a wife? Now, now, Vy, I'm sure the boy has a very sound financial plan in mind.
LEADMALE:That's right, you tell her.
SUPMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:After all, he is working full time at the college.
OTHERMALE:It's part time, Uncle Phil, just part time.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, you have that great hourly wage.
OTHERMALE:Not to mention my tips.
LEADMALE:That's right, that's right Well, now, just what exactly is 15 percent of a frozen burrito? Oh, never mind.
OTHERFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADMALE:Once you graduate and you start your career Um, what is it that you're majoring in, now? See, I haven't exactly declared my major yet, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:You're not giving good examples right now either.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Aha.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPMALE:I see what you're doing.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I watch The Cosby Show too, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE:This is that episode where Theo drops out of school, right? Well, yeah, something like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, well, a couple more Pudding Pops, you'll be there.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Will, you are not getting married, and that is it.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mom, I understand that this was a bit of a shock for you guys.
LEADMALE:But you don't have to worry about me and Lisa.
LEADMALE:We're gonna be all right.
SUPMALE:You know why? Because we got love.
SUPFEMALE:What's love got to do with it? GEOFFREY 
LEADFEMALE:Got to do with it, got to do with it Look, I really, really appreciate you guys' concern but I'm a grown man.
OTHERMALE:And with all due respect, if I needed your permission to get married I would've asked for it.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter?
LEADFEMALE:Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, babe.
LEADMALE:Hil, run us past Lisa's house, please.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Mrs.
LEADMALE:Banks said I could take this home.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, you don't.
OTHERMALE:I'm serving that tonight.
SUPMALE:No, you're not.
LEADMALE:Yes, I am.
LEADMALE:No, you're not.
LEADMALE:Yes, I am.
LEADMALE:No, you're not.
SUPMALE:Yes, I am.
LEADMALE:Guys, stop it! Jazz, let go.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am!  I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:Um Maybe we can run by X-ray on the way to Lisa's?
LEADMALE:Thanks, for a really nice party.
LEADFEMALE:Could I speak to you for a second? I know Will has probably told you we have some concerns about you getting married.
LEADMALE:You do too?
LEADFEMALE:What you talking about, Lisa? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Banks, it's not that I don't love Will.
LEADMALE:It's just that all of this is happening so fast.
LEADFEMALE:And I never really said I would marry him.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, I never said I wouldn't either.
LEADMALE:Well, you two should talk.
LEADFEMALE:And soon.
LEADMALE:I just don't want to devastate him with all that's been going on.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever crushed anyone?
LEADMALE:Well   Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Before we wrap up, let's test your reflexes.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Ow! My goodness, those doctors must have crossed some wires in there.
OTHERMALE:Quit messing around, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, hey, hey, there she come.
LEADMALE:There she come.
OTHERFEMALE:What's up, baby? 
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Oh, hey, tell her how good I've been doing.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her how good.
LEADMALE:He's doing great, and you must be the reason.
SUPFEMALE:He can't stop talking about you.
LEADFEMALE:See you tomorrow, Will.
LEADFEMALE:All right, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Hey, baby, I got a little surprise for you.
LEADFEMALE:Unh.
LEADMALE:Um, Will, I kind of got a little surprise for you too.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, me first.
LEADFEMALE:Check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Unh.
LEADMALE:Just get away from me.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mama, look, I can walk.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Look at you.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, girl, I got me some motivation.
LEADFEMALE:If I wasn't walking down that aisle with you I'd probably still be upstairs in that wheelchair.
OTHERMALE:Ah.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what was your surprise? Um Will, I don't really know how to say this, but I don't wanna get Don't wanna get what? A ticket.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm double-parked outside.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, hold up, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, come on, come on.
LEADFEMALE:That ain't what you wanted to say.
SUPFEMALE:Look, there is nothing that you can't tell the man that you're gonna marry.
SUPMALE:I don't wanna marry you.
LEADFEMALE:See? It wasn't that hard, was it?  
LEADFEMALE:You're thinking of Lisa again, aren't you?
OTHERMALE:Pfft.
LEADFEMALE:Lisa who? Girl, what you talking about? I'm playing Scrabble.
SUPFEMALE:D- U-M-P-E-D.
LEADFEMALE:"Dumped.
SUPMALE:" And you also made "lonely," "shocked" and "pathetic.
SUPFEMALE:" No, no, no, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:That's mine.
LEADMALE:I'm "pathetic.
LEADFEMALE:" Yeah, you're right, Ash.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I can't concentrate.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe we should do something else.
LEADMALE:Let's watch some TV.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, I think Montel is on.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Next on Montel Williams Women Who Won't Marry and the Losers Who Ask Them.
LEADFEMALE:Give me that.
OTHERFEMALE:MAN 
SUPMALE:Yes, folks, at Willie's World of Wheels we lease every kind of transportation imaginable.
SUPMALE:Lease a truck, lease a car, lease a van, lease a bus, lease a tractor.
LEADFEMALE:G, to the kitchen, please.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Rain Man.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey, babe.
LEADFEMALE:Are you hungry, baby? 
SUPFEMALE:Not especially.
OTHERMALE:You've got to eat something.
LEADMALE:All right, just give me the same thing Uncle Phil has.
SUPFEMALE:Just make mine a single-sized serving.
LEADMALE:Here you go, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:Hey, thanks a lot, Aunt Viv.
SUPMALE:Oh, can you cut up my chicken finger for me, please? Of course, dear.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, my biscuit needs some butter.
LEADMALE:Then I suggest you butter it.
LEADMALE:My God, man, I'm in a wheelchair.
SUPFEMALE:I've noticed.
LEADFEMALE:I've noticed a lot of things lately like you moping around here, acting all helpless.
SUPMALE:You can do some things for yourself, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, when you're finished eating, I've pre-pasted your toothbrush upstairs.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:You should be happy, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:You didn't want me to get married and now I'm not.
LEADMALE:Will, we know you're upset about Lisa.
LEADMALE:Look, you know what? I just wanna forget that she ever existed.
LEADFEMALE:I never even wanna hear her name again.
LEADFEMALE:Which reminds me.
LEADFEMALE:Lisa called.
LEADMALE:Come on, Will, it's time to go to therapy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going anywhere with you.
SUPMALE:Every time I get around you, I wind up getting hurt.
LEADFEMALE:You are so accident-prone.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I am really disappointed in you.
SUPMALE:Please, not another lecture.
LEADMALE:Well, someone has to say it.
LEADFEMALE:Being in a wheelchair is no excuse for wearing the same shirt two days in a row.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:Hilary.
OTHERMALE:Look, you don't know what it's like to lose a fianc√©e.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? I was engaged last year, remember?
OTHERMALE:Bungee accident?
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Sorry, Hil.
SUPFEMALE:You would think hitting the concrete like that would've made more of an impact.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Will, we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
LEADMALE:But we never even would've been engaged if he hadn't been so persistent.
LEADMALE:God, I must have turned him down like 10 times before we even went out.
OTHERMALE:Ha.
SUPMALE:Really? You know what made me finally change my mind? That big old rock he put on your finger? Well, besides that.
LEADFEMALE:It was knowing that no matter what I said or what I did or how I acted he would always be there for me.
LEADFEMALE:The point is, Will, if she really means something to you take a lesson from my fianc√©.
LEADMALE:Don't give up.
LEADFEMALE:God, I miss him.
LEADFEMALE:Poor, poor Tip of the tongue, Will.
LEADMALE:Please help me out.
LEADMALE:Trevor.
LEADFEMALE:Trevor.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:
SUPMALE:Wait, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know what? I think you're right.
SUPMALE:Maybe I did give up too easy.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call Lisa right now.
SUPMALE:
SUPMALE:Will.
SUPMALE:Damn, you got good ears, girl.
LEADMALE:We need to talk.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you got that right.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary, do you mind?
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Duh.
SUPMALE:Hey, look, Lisa
LEADFEMALE:No, Will.
SUPFEMALE:When I said we needed to talk I meant that I need to talk and you need to listen.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you are stupid.
SUPFEMALE:Well, stupid is as stupid does.
LEADMALE:Well, what is that supposed to mean? I don't know, but the movie made like a half a billion dollars.
LEADMALE:So I say one thing that you don't wanna hear and that's it? You just shut me out without even letting me explain? "Will, I don't want to marry you" seems pretty self-explanatory.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you're wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Will, I love you.
OTHERMALE:But I feel like the only reason you asked me to marry you is because you're feeling vulnerable right now.
SUPMALE:Well, getting shot kind of has that effect on a brother.
LEADMALE:I understand that, but what'll happen when you're back on your feet and feeling like yourself again? Baby, I don't wanna have to shoot you every six months just to hold on to you.
SUPMALE:Look, Lisa when that bullet hit me, I gotta admit, it scared the hell out of me.
LEADFEMALE:But it made me realize that maybe I don't have all the time in the world like I thought.
LEADMALE:I mean, who's to say what'll happen tomorrow or next week or the week after that? All I know is that I love you.
LEADFEMALE:And, Lisa, believe me, that is never gonna change.
OTHERMALE:Well, in that case, the answer is yes.
SUPMALE:Yes? Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Yes!  Hey, hey.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't really bust a cap at me, though, would you?
LEADFEMALE:Not unless I have to.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:So you think we should tell your family?
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:I think some of them already know.
LEADMALE:Good thing it's the ones on our side.
SUPMALE:Come on out here, guys.
SUPFEMALE:Give the bride-to-be a kiss.
SUPFEMALE:Time for a toast.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, get some glasses.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Dom Perignon, the good stuff.
LEADMALE:Tyler and I were saving it for our honeymoon.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Trevor, Hilary.
LEADMALE:Right, Trevor, whatever.
OTHERFEMALE:Anyway, I figured it was the least I could do with all the injuries I've caused.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:It ain't nothing, Hil.
SUPMALE:Accidents happen.
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Hey, Ash, guess what.
SUPFEMALE:Me and Lisa finally set the date.
LEADFEMALE:We're getting married in September.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Oh, Will, that's great.
SUPMALE:Hey, listen, I even bought the ring too.
LEADMALE:Really? How many carats? Come on, Ash, it's not the size that counts.
LEADMALE:That small, huh? Well, I mean, I I I didn't get the ring I wanted to get, you know.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't afford the real cubic zirconia.
SUPMALE:Hey, but check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Presentation is everything.
LEADMALE:Check it out.
LEADMALE:Yo, G.
LEADFEMALE:Ahem.
SUPMALE:I had Geoffrey bake the ring inside of her favorite cookie.
LEADFEMALE:Aww.
OTHERFEMALE:Nothing says loving like something from the oven.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:And Will Smith says it best.
LEADMALE:Hey, that looks great, G.
SUPMALE:It certainly does.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil!   What y'all watching, a Rosie Perez movie? I wish.
SUPFEMALE:Hilary gave us a tape of her talk show and made us promise to watch.
LEADMALE:It's been on for three minutes, and we're almost done.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Uh It's nothing, babe.
SUPFEMALE:It's that thong underwear you bought me for Christmas.
LEADMALE:What's up, girl?
SUPMALE:I just wanted to come over and say thank you for fixing my sink.
LEADMALE:Oh, cool.
LEADMALE:Um, baby, how about meeting me for a little midnight swim? Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:You got that, baby.
OTHERFEMALE:Where? My living room.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks to you, my apartment is flooded.
SUPMALE:It will be days until I can get back in.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
LEADMALE:I'm usually pretty handy with stuff like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell her, y'all.
LEADMALE:Didn't I just fix the toaster?  See? Before it wouldn't even get past the door.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Will.
OTHERMALE:In the morning, I'll set it on dark and it'll meet me at school.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I should call my friend Denise, see if I can stay over there.
SUPMALE:What you talking about? You can stay in the pool house with us.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, is that okay with you?
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I love a good old-fashioned sleepover.
LEADMALE:What say we rent a musical pop some corn and after that, dare I say, Yahtzee? Dare I 
LEADFEMALE:Ow! Geoffrey, you look wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Is that a new suit? It was, 20 years ago.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's funny.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, since I moved out I have really missed your sense of humor, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:Your wit, ha-ha-ha your charm your wit.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPMALE:Your Oh, who are we kidding? I need you to come work for me.
SUPFEMALE:Miss Hilary, I already have a job.
LEADMALE:Well, then, just part-time.
OTHERMALE:Look, I'm a career woman.
OTHERMALE:I don't have time to dust and push around that Oh, what do you call that big loud thing that sucks up everything? You call him "Daddy.
LEADMALE:" I'm sorry, Miss Hilary, but he'd never allow me to moonlight.
SUPFEMALE:I'm expected to be on call for his 3 a.
SUPMALE:m.
LEADMALE:feeding.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll just use you in between meals.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy will never even know you're gone.
OTHERMALE:Are you suggesting that I lie? Big time.
SUPFEMALE:Miss Hilary, I couldn't.
LEADMALE:I've worked for your father for 20 years.
LEADMALE:He's seen me through some very hard times.
LEADMALE:Even paid for my dear mother's cataract surgery.
OTHERFEMALE:The extra money could get you that Beemer.
LEADMALE:Well, it's not as if he gave her a kidney.
LEADMALE:Hey, Lucy, I home.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, baby.
LEADMALE:No, Lucy, don't even try.
LEADMALE:You cannot be in the show.
OTHERMALE: Hey, girl.
LEADMALE:Man, what is that smell?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's my chicken stew.
SUPFEMALE:Girl, exactly what part of that chicken are you cooking?
LEADFEMALE:Come here, boy, I want you to taste it.
SUPMALE:Why? I I I mean, I'd love to, baby.
LEADMALE:I made it especially for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, damn, I swallowed it! What? Oh, and it was finger-licking good, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, kids.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Do you wanna stay and join us for dinner? Uh, no, thank you, Lisa.
OTHERFEMALE:As lovely as that stinks Uh, uh, smells.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't wanna interrupt.
LEADMALE:I just came over to talk to you kids about your marriage.
LEADMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Not again.
SUPMALE:We are getting married in September.
LEADFEMALE:No, Will.
SUPMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Your aunt and I have been talking about this.
LEADFEMALE:We just wanna make sure that you get off to the best start possible which is why we're giving you this little engagement present.
LEADMALE:"
OTHERFEMALE:Buy Reese's Pieces for desk jar.
SUPMALE:" Other side.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:My fault.
LEADMALE:"Dr.
LEADMALE:Whitehorn.
LEADFEMALE:Psychologist"? His specialty is relationship counseling.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Banks, Will and I are in love.
LEADMALE:We don't need any counseling.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:But I could damn sure go for some Reese's Pieces.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Now, look, look, Will.
LEADMALE:Look, marriage is difficult at any age.
LEADMALE:Now, all counseling will do is give you tools to make your relationship work.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you wouldn't drive a car without taking at least a few lessons first.
LEADFEMALE:Look here, Uncle Phil, I'm from Philly.
LEADMALE:You know what I mean? I was driving when I was 11, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, that was in the good old days before The Club.
LEADFEMALE:Hear what I'm saying? That'll put a crimp in the plans, you know.
SUPMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, thanks a lot, man, but we both go to school and we work.
SUPMALE:We really don't have time for that.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, that's a shame.
OTHERMALE:Because I was gonna pay for your honeymoon anywhere in the world you wanted to go.
LEADMALE:Hey, baby, what's Swahili for "ching-ching"?  I guess what I'm trying to say is, you know, we don't need to be here.
LEADFEMALE:We happy.
LEADMALE:Tell him, baby.
LEADMALE:Yes, very happy.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you know them little yellow smiley faces? Just put some Hershey syrup on them, you got us, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Then all I have to do is give you the skills to maintain that enthusiasm.
SUPMALE:Oh, if you mean what I think you mean, I got skills, you know.
OTHERMALE:I was talking about interpersonal relationship skills.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's what I meant.
SUPFEMALE:That's what I was thinking.
LEADMALE:The two most 
OTHERFEMALE:respect and communication.
LEADFEMALE:You see, it's very important  Oh, excuse me.
LEADMALE:Dr.
LEADFEMALE:Whitehorn.
LEADFEMALE:Ugh, it's you.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Rita, you are sucking me dry.
SUPMALE:Look, you want more alimony, you talk to my first two wives, all right?  Never get married on a dare.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
OTHERMALE:Now, uh, where were we? Um, respect and communication.
SUPFEMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:That's right.
SUPMALE:But look, for now before tomorrow's group session, I'd like to ask questions.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, cool, questions.
LEADFEMALE:Knock yourself out.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Uh, where do you see yourselves Ah, that's an easy one.
SUPFEMALE:Ten years, I see us, you know kind of like the Huxtables, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Except I'm not gonna be delivering babies, I'm gonna be making them, you know.
OTHERMALE:You know.
LEADMALE:But first, I figure we'd start out with Will, Jr.
LEADFEMALE:, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Then Willfred, then Willoughby, then Willard, you know.
OTHERMALE:Then Willis.
SUPFEMALE:Will, stop.
OTHERMALE:"Will Stop"?  That ain't no good name.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Willstafa, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:That's strong, you know, like, kind of a Lion King kind of feel.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Will Simba.
OTHERMALE:Uh, we'll come back to that.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, let's take another question.
SUPMALE:Oh, where will you be living?
LEADFEMALE:That's an easy one.
SUPMALE:Right, baby?
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Cleveland.
SUPMALE:Philly.
SUPMALE:Oh, this ought to be good.
LEADMALE:Well, that new little Beemer of yours runs like a dream, doesn't it? Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:How should I know? You've been hogging it ever since I signed the papers.
OTHERFEMALE:Just come on upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:You know that table in Daddy's study? I need you to carry it out to the car.
LEADFEMALE:It's a pool table.
LEADFEMALE:Duh.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPMALE:Miss Hilary, I'm sorry, but I have duties here to attend to.
OTHERMALE:Besides, I'm still worn out from last night.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please.
SUPFEMALE:I just had you do a little yard work.
OTHERMALE:I don't believe blacktopping your tennis court falls into that category.
LEADFEMALE:You are so lazy.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Not too lazy to quit.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, where have you been?
SUPMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:Last thing you said 
LEADFEMALE:"I just need to step outside for a little fresh air.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back.
OTHERMALE:"
SUPFEMALE:That was seven hours ago.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, don't get into a hissy fit, sir.
SUPMALE:I left dinner in the oven.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, thank goodness.
LEADFEMALE:I thought we were gonna have to eat what Daddy gave us.
LEADFEMALE:God help us.
LEADMALE:You'd think a guy who eats so much would at least know his way around the kitchen.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Lisa, hi.
SUPMALE:Where's Will?
LEADMALE:Will who? 
SUPMALE:Will, was there a problem in therapy? Man, we are this close to breaking up.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, that stuff doesn't work at all.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thanks, babe.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't hurt me! What is your problem? Me?  Baby, just tell me one 
SUPMALE:Did you put something on or did you take something off? Trust me, the next time I decide to take something off you will be too old and blind to care.

LEADFEMALE:Good morning.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, are my sandwiches ready yet?  Philip, for God's sake, we're going to SeaWorld.
LEADFEMALE:There's gonna be food stands everywhere.
OTHERMALE:That may be true, Aunt Viv, but there ain't gonna be no food stand in the Volvo.
LEADFEMALE:You better let that man eat and give him food or he'll mess around and chew one of your arms off in the car.
SUPMALE:Carlton, I had a talk with Frank Bradley this morning from Princeton.
LEADMALE:You ready for your big interview tomorrow?
LEADFEMALE:Am I ever.
LEADMALE:I've been enhancing my r√©sum√© all week.

LEADFEMALE:Now, why you go and do that? You certainly ain't big, and as far as being a brother  Well, I've already planned what I'm gonna wear.
LEADMALE:I've got my argyles, my wide-wale cords and my lucky sweater.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Master Carlton, about your sweater, we've had a dryer mishap.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Carlton, it'll shrink.
SUPMALE:It's just a small setback.
SUPFEMALE:I still have the canary-yellow one.
LEADMALE:I forgive you, Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:Banks residence.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, certainly.
SUPFEMALE:For you, Master Carlton.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? Yes.
LEADMALE:It's the rec center.
SUPMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:What? I can't be a Big Brother? They didn't like me? Well, you tell those little brats I don't like them either.
LEADFEMALE:Will, this sweater will work for my interview tomorrow, right? Uh, that depends, are you going as Archie or Jughead?  Hello? Dole headquarters? No, man, we don't want no pineapples.
LEADFEMALE:Give me that.

SUPFEMALE:Ha! You got that right.
SUPFEMALE:Mama, no! Hey, what's up, G? Another Village People reunion? As it is my weekend off, I've decided to head for the Circle M Dude Ranch.
LEADFEMALE:There's nothing like the feel of an animal beneath you to recharge your battery.
SUPMALE:I know what you're talking about there, G.
LEADMALE:No, I'm afraid you don't, Master William.
SUPFEMALE:But I do find it rather endearing when you think you do.

LEADFEMALE:Ah, ha, ha.
SUPMALE:Not so fast, man.
SUPFEMALE:I got a little surprise for you.
SUPMALE:Now, nothing makes a brother who's feeling down feel better than seeing somebody who's in worse shape.
LEADMALE:Huh? I called up Stinky McGuire.
SUPMALE:Yeah? Stinky's here? I haven't seen him since high school.
SUPMALE:Seeing him would cheer me up.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, he was always such a loser.
LEADFEMALE:He was even shorter than me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, bring him in.
LEADMALE:Hey, Carlton.
SUPFEMALE: Party, dude.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, man.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Oh, we gonna have some fun, man.

LEADFEMALE:You not in the mood for this, huh? Well, look here, too short if you wanna sit around and wallow in the stench of your own self-pity then you go right ahead.
LEADMALE:Will, you don't understand.

LEADFEMALE:"My sweater shrunk.
LEADMALE:My grades are low.
LEADMALE:My head is too small for my body.
SUPFEMALE:" It is? Oh, shut up, Carlton.

LEADFEMALE:I am not gonna sit around here with your stank-robe-wearing, slipper-shuffling r√©sum√©-polishing, little-kids-don't-like-me blues.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I'm about to go out and I'm gonna get me a 16-piece nugget dinner.

LEADFEMALE:He left and he ain't come back yet Excuse me, Pappy, why don't you take a nappy? Listen, I am not about to stand here and argue with you about who has it worse.
LEADMALE:The fact of the matter is neither one of us has it that bad.
LEADMALE:But this is your last chance to get into Princeton.
LEADFEMALE:If you wanna blow that, you go right ahead.
LEADMALE: What were you doing? No one's allowed in the bedrooms.

LEADMALE:I'm just having a smoke.
LEADMALE:Not here you're not, idiot.
SUPMALE:Could somebody turn down the music? Carlton, I really appreciate your willingness to change your schedule.
SUPMALE:Well, changing is one of my strong suits, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bradley.
LEADMALE:As you know, your father and I were classmates at Princeton.
LEADMALE:He was quite the big man on campus.
LEADFEMALE:He's even bigger now.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, aren't we all?
SUPMALE:Oh! Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:I was very impressed with your application.
SUPMALE:Particularly cogent was your essay on the fall of Eastern Europe.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADMALE:If you like Eastern Europe in the fall you should see it in the spring, it's beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you've got a good sense of humor.
SUPMALE:Obviously, you got that from your dad.
LEADMALE:Oh, you know my Dad? Well, yes, didn't I just mention that a moment ago? Ah! Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Of course.
LEADMALE:Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Big man on campus.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:I see here that you've worked for a lot of charities.
LEADMALE:Which one meant the most to you? Um The second one.
LEADMALE:But this has all been about me, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bradley.
SUPMALE:Me, me, me.
OTHERMALE:Frank, is there a Mrs.
LEADMALE:Bradley? A couple of baby Bradleys? Hey, have you seen Braveheart? Look, friend, we can talk about candy all day but you ain't gonna convince me that blue was a bad way to go.
LEADFEMALE:By the way I hear that whistle blowing.
OTHERMALE:I got a train to catch.
SUPFEMALE:Well, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hold on there, Sparky.
LEADFEMALE:Before you catch any train, how about you telling me what you're running away from? Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:But this won't be pretty.
LEADFEMALE:I must say, I was riveted by your thesis on regressive taxation.
SUPMALE:How did you arrive at such a scintillating hypothesis? But I guess the signs were always there.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure these chiseled good looks and striking personality opened the doors of opportunity quickly but lately, they've been closing even quicker.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, heck, who am I kidding? Look at me, I'm not Princeton material.
LEADMALE:Like the song says, Pappy "you gotta know when to fold them.
LEADFEMALE:" It's my time to fold.
OTHERMALE:Sounds like, to me, you're giving up.
LEADFEMALE:You're a smart man, Pappy.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, Carlton, it's one thing to throw in the hand but it's another thing to get up from the table and quit the game.
LEADFEMALE:You honestly believe that Superman could beat the Flash in a foot race? Oh, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bradley, I'm glad you're still here.
LEADMALE:Carlton Banks.
SUPFEMALE:What? That's poppycock.
OTHERMALE:I'm Carlton Banks.
LEADFEMALE:No, Will, your charade is not necessary.
LEADMALE:Now, if you'll excuse us, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bradley and I need to talk.
OTHERFEMALE:A lot of these legacies I interview, they've got the grades, the r√©sum√© but they're sheltered, you know? Like that milquetoast cousin of yours.
LEADFEMALE:But you really impressed me tonight.
LEADMALE:I'd be happy to sign a letter of recommendation for you.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:Thanks for covering for me tonight.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no problem, man.
LEADMALE:I'm just glad you came back when you did.
LEADFEMALE:I'm starting to get a little too comfortable in this stuff, know what I'm saying?  Um Carlton, hold up.
OTHERMALE:Mom and Dad leave for the night and you take advantage like this? And what about you, mister? What kind of role model are you? If it weren't for me, the two of you would have this family on the way to hell in a handbasket.
LEADMALE:And another thing, what?
SUPFEMALE:He's back.
LEADMALE:He's back.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, I'm back? Of course, I'm back.
LEADFEMALE:I'm home.
LEADMALE:
SUPMALE:Will, I'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:You said you'd teach me one of your basketball tricks.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, you know, my moves are kind of like top secret, Nick.
LEADMALE:I mean, I could show you, but then I'd have to kill you.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe I'll make an exception this one time, all right? All right.
SUPMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:D me up, D me up.
OTHERMALE:All right, check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Now, this is called the Will Smith Hoop Dream, Dunk on Hakeem Down the Lane, House of Pain pass.
LEADMALE:I see you wasn't ready for that one.
LEADFEMALE:Back in Philly, they used to call me Will "The 747" Smith.
OTHERMALE:Wanna know why?
SUPMALE:Why? Because I'm about to jet.
OTHERMALE:This weekend? Oh, I'd love to, Thad, but I'm gonna lay low.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, it's nothing serious, just the flu.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's so sweet.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, bye.
SUPFEMALE:Thad? I thought you were dating Kyle.
LEADMALE:I am.
OTHERFEMALE:He's the flu.
LEADFEMALE:Go, girl.
LEADFEMALE:You see what I'm saying? It sounds like it's raining men.
LEADMALE:I hope y'all are taking notes.
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, hey, stop being all freaky.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Will.
LEADFEMALE:What you doing? Five to ten if you don't take your hands off me.
SUPMALE:Hill, what you think? You did a pretty good show today, huh? Three words: Stink.
LEADMALE:Stank.
SUPMALE:Stunk.
SUPMALE:It was the worst show we have ever done.
LEADMALE:We need better guests.
LEADMALE:Wait, wait.
LEADMALE:Don't be getting all mad at me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just the assistant talent coordinator.
SUPMALE:If I had some more responsibility, maybe we'd have some better guests.
SUPFEMALE:Then get me someone great for tomorrow's show.
OTHERMALE:And if it were my responsibility, then I'd do it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'm telling you to do it.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, and if I thought you meant it, then I'd get it done.
SUPMALE:That's right, my baby can definitely get it done.
LEADMALE:Don't make me turn the hose on you, all right? Will, I need more stimulating guests.
LEADFEMALE:I need someone who can hold my attention for more than three seconds.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:How about we get? I gotta go.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, what's going on, man?  Would you like to buy a vowel?  You know, this trial is gonna be the death of me.
LEADMALE:We lost another juror today.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Hey, did you check under your robe? I can see you're not in the mood for that right now.
LEADMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Right here.
SUPMALE:Right here.
SUPMALE:So come on, man.
SUPFEMALE:What happened? He was writing a book.
OTHERFEMALE:The bailiff found him hiding in the men's room with his laptop.
LEADMALE:You sure he wasn't just downloading his floppy? 
OTHERFEMALE:Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Shut up.
LEADMALE:Can you hear me? Hi, I'm Carlton Banks, and I joined Great Introductions to give you red-hot mamas a chance to take a walk on the wild side.
LEADFEMALE:So climb on board.
LEADMALE:Hm.
LEADMALE:A tad forward.
LEADFEMALE:I am tan, I am a tourist and I'd love to give a lucky mademoiselle like you a chance to meet moi.
LEADFEMALE:That felt close.
LEADFEMALE:Do you guys mind?  What is your problem, Pepe Le Puny? Hardy har har.
LEADFEMALE:And in a related story Judge Philip Banks has dismissed yet another juror in the Show-Biz Madam Case.
LEADFEMALE:As cameras are not allowed in his courtroom we have an artist's rendering of his action.
LEADFEMALE:Specific details are not yet available as to why the juror was dismissed.
LEADMALE:Wait, I know that guy.
SUPFEMALE:Of course you do.
OTHERFEMALE:That's my Dad, you half-life.
LEADMALE:Not him, the other dude.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what, you knew him? He's my barber.
LEADMALE:The dude that cut that jack-o'-lantern in your head last Halloween? That's the guy.
LEADMALE:It'd have been great if that candle hadn't burned the roof of my mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Jazz, do you think he'd do Hilary? Why not? She got a nice big head.
LEADFEMALE:This place is so tiny.
SUPMALE:I can't even imagine how small the facial room must be.
LEADFEMALE:Hill, why don't you come on over here and sit down? Here you go.
LEADMALE:Read this Jet magazine and let me handle my business, all right?
LEADFEMALE:Okay, you're next.
LEADMALE:Hey.
OTHERMALE:Whoa, hey.
OTHERMALE:Now, you know I'm gonna have to charge you extra for working around these ears.
OTHERMALE:Well, no, hold up, my man.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, I'm not here to get a haircut.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you in the wrong place, fool.
LEADFEMALE:Well, no, a friend of mine sent me.
SUPMALE:You know Jazz? The idiot that put the candle in his mouth?
SUPMALE:That's him.
SUPMALE:All right, now, what can I do you for?
LEADMALE:Well, see, actually, my cousin and l
OTHERFEMALE:Will, let me handle this.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:As you probably already know, I'm Hilary Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Ha, ha! That's very funny.
LEADFEMALE:I would be really honored if you would be a guest on my show.
LEADFEMALE:What is it with you people? First, you got Geraldo coming in here you know his head is as empty as Al Capone's vault, then you had Montel.
LEADFEMALE:I told Montel, "Yeah, I'll do your show when you grow some hair.
LEADMALE:" Now, listen, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told them.
LEADMALE:I'm not interested in doing tabloid television.
LEADMALE:I have my dignity and I have my self-respect.
SUPMALE:We got cash.
LEADMALE:You got George.
SUPFEMALE:HILARY: Oh! Carlton, can I use your car on Saturday? No can do, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:I have a date.
OTHERFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:With who? Well, I haven't worked that part out yet.
LEADMALE:But once this dating-service thing kicks in this hombre's dance card is gonna be pretty full.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, just yuk it up.
LEADFEMALE:He who laughs last See, it's started already.
LEADMALE:Master Carlton
LEADFEMALE:Not now, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:"You're in my thoughts.
LEADFEMALE:Love, Thad.
SUPMALE:" Thad? That's a pretty sexy-sounding name.
LEADFEMALE:I'm thinking long legs.
SUPMALE:No, these are for me from Thad.
SUPMALE:Now what am I supposed to do? Please, for carnations and a little baby's breath? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Carlton, you will never guess who we got on the show for tomorrow.
LEADMALE:So there's no sense of me playing, is there? Hey, Uncle Phil, about that juror you just
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Will, but I can't talk about it.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, the juror How many times do I have to tell you kids that I just can't talk about it? Ugh! Hey, Nicky, you will never guess who we got How many times do I have to tell you kids? I just can't talk about it.
LEADMALE:Ugh! Excuse me, I'm here to return this radio.
LEADMALE:SALESMAN: Back of the line.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, aren't you Judge Banks? Well, yes, I am.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, everybody, it's Judge Banks from the television.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:You think that show-biz madam did it or what, huh? I'm sorry, but I can't discuss the case.
LEADFEMALE:Then I can't discuss your radio.
LEADFEMALE:Back of the line.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, why don't you just relax, cool out a little bit? Hilary will be out soon.
SUPMALE:How you feeling? You a little nervous? Why should I be nervous? I'm all liquored up.
LEADFEMALE:You are hilarious, man.
SUPMALE:Hey, have a seat.
LEADMALE:Have a seat.
LEADMALE:Listen, I just wanna let you that, you know any point during the show you feel like you might wanna I don't know, toss my name in, "Will Smith," you know, it's cool.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Ready, George? Of course, I'm ready.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been waiting around for an hour.
OTHERMALE:Where's my money? Hey, look.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be right over here.
SUPMALE:Remember, Will Smith.
OTHERFEMALE:Will Smith.
LEADFEMALE:WERNER: All right, everybody, have a great show.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Now, just relax, be yourself, and remember to keep your answers short.
OTHERFEMALE:The audience didn't come to hear the guest babble on and on.
OTHERMALE:In five, four, three, two  Hello and welcome to Hilary.
LEADMALE:We're very excited today to have as our guest recently dismissed juror from the Show-Biz Madam Trial, George Howlings.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Welcome.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you so much.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess what we're all dying to know is why you were dismissed.
SUPFEMALE:You know, they told the press I was writing a book, but that's not it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? Tell us what it really was.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, they said I was crazy, but I'm not crazy.
OTHERFEMALE:But you wanna know who is crazy? Maybe I shouldn't say this on TV.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on, George.
SUPMALE:Just between you and me who was crazy? That lard-butt of a judge.
OTHERFEMALE:That man is crazy as they come.
LEADMALE:GEORGE : What does it take to become a judge these days? Now, if you ask me, that man was very incompetent.
LEADMALE:Couldn't judge a beauty pageant.
SUPMALE:About as useless as a no-mouthed dog at a Frisbee contest.
OTHERFEMALE:If I ever see him, I'll lower him like a cheap carpet.
LEADFEMALE:And it looked to me, he dozed off every now and then.
LEADFEMALE:HILARY: George Probably dreaming about that bony-legged prosecutor.
LEADFEMALE:I think they got something going on.
LEADFEMALE:Ain't that right, Will Smith? Hill.
LEADMALE:Hill.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold up.
LEADMALE:He's gonna kill us.
LEADFEMALE:Will, it's not like it was our fault.
LEADMALE:We can't control what someone says.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy will understand that.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I hope so.
OTHERFEMALE:And if not, I'll just blame the whole thing on you.
LEADFEMALE:Oops.
LEADFEMALE:Did I say that out loud? Is he in there? No, the coast is Clear! Hi, Daddy.
LEADMALE:You look so handsome.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, not bad for a lard butt, huh? I guess there's no reason to ask whether or not you saw the show today.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I saw the show.
LEADMALE:ALL: We all saw the show.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, wait, hold up, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:Now, before you get started I wanna let you know that finger pointing isn't gonna get us nowhere.
LEADFEMALE:And also that it's not called The Will Show.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please.
LEADMALE:You're the one that introduced me to that nut.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, punish him.
LEADFEMALE:He needs tough love.
LEADMALE:That is enough.
OTHERMALE:I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life.
SUPFEMALE:And to think the two people responsible for it are my own family.
LEADFEMALE:My own flesh and blood.
LEADFEMALE:Um Technically, Uncle Phil, I'm not really your flesh and blood.
SUPFEMALE:See, my Mom and Aunt Viv, they I see where you going with this though.
SUPFEMALE:Do you?
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, I can see.
LEADFEMALE:Pssh-pssh! Then tell me, what is it? Haven't I done enough for you? Taking you into my home, huh? Treated you with respect.
OTHERMALE:Maybe I did something to hurt you, is that it? No.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, that's not it.
OTHERFEMALE:Then why?
LEADMALE:I don't I don't know.
SUPMALE:And you my own daughter.
LEADFEMALE:My first-born.
LEADMALE:I don't know if there's a knife that could cut as deeply.
LEADFEMALE:We tried to tell you yesterday.
LEADMALE:That's your excuse? You didn't have the sense to know that that man would be angry with me for dismissing him? You didn't have the common sense to know that? I don't have any common sense.
LEADFEMALE:You two have profoundly hurt and disappointed me.
LEADMALE:Unc Uncle Uncle Ph Unc You should be ashamed of yourselves.
OTHERMALE:Aunt Aunt Aunt
LEADFEMALE:A Ashley.
SUPMALE:You understand, don't you? Nicky.
SUPMALE:Come on Ow! Man.
LEADMALE:Hill, you know what you gonna say?
LEADMALE:I'm just gonna speak from the heart.
LEADMALE:Hey, now just remember, this is from both of us.
LEADMALE:Don't be out there taking all the credit.
LEADMALE:Have a good show.
SUPMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:In five seconds, four, three, two Hello and welcome to Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:Today's show is a very special tribute to fathers.
LEADMALE:But before we get to our guests I'd like to say something special about a very important man in my life.
LEADMALE:My father, Judge Philip Banks.
OTHERMALE:Yesterday, a dismissed juror in the Show-Biz Madam Trial came on the show and said some really icky things about him.
SUPMALE:My cousin Will and I were, well, to say the least, shocked.
LEADMALE:And now Daddy won't even talk to us.
SUPFEMALE:WILL: He won't say nothing.
OTHERMALE:HILARY : And we feel like strangers in our own house.
SUPFEMALE:Please, Daddy, forgive us.
LEADMALE:Please.
SUPMALE:You should be ashamed of yourself.
LEADMALE:Ow! And we don't know what we supposed to do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, no one answered the front door.
LEADFEMALE:I have a package for a Carlton Banks.
LEADFEMALE:That's me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, not another rejection.
SUPMALE:Bad news? I sent this to Last Chance Video Dating.
SUPFEMALE:You know, "We guarantee you a date," except if your name is Carlton Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me.
OTHERMALE:It doesn't work if your name is Michelle Williams either.
LEADMALE:You tried this?
OTHERFEMALE:I tried them all.
SUPMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't expect someone like you to have trouble meeting people.
SUPFEMALE:The only people I meet are dogs and shut-ins.
LEADMALE:Why can't it be easier? I mean, why can't you just open the door and meet someone nice? Well, bye.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Would you? Uh Uh Like to go out Saturday night? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm not
LEADMALE:Coming on too strong? Not at all.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Sweet mother of God, that's a firm handshake.
OTHERMALE:Trust me, if Daddy saw the show this afternoon, everything will be fine.
SUPMALE:And if he didn't, we'll show it to him.
OTHERMALE:Now, do you know how to work one of these things? What are you two doing?  Hey, man.
LEADFEMALE:Did you see anything, I don't know, good on TV today? No.
LEADMALE:So you didn't see the show?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I saw the show.
SUPFEMALE:And now thanks to you, not only am I an incompetent judge, but an unfit parent.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell me, what do you have planned for tomorrow? Perhaps snapshots of me in the bathtub, huh? Or a video of me chasing stray dogs in my car.
LEADMALE:Daddy, you don't do that, do you? You two are the most irresponsible All right, I've heard enough.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I did see something good on TV today.
OTHERFEMALE:I saw two people begging for forgiveness and feeling very badly for hurting someone that they love.
LEADMALE:Oh, please, Vivian.
LEADMALE:Don't buy into the propaganda.
LEADFEMALE:That's enough.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what I wanna hear now is an apology and the acceptance of the apology.
LEADMALE:Go ahead.

SUPFEMALE:We sorry, man.
LEADMALE:We sorry.

SUPFEMALE:Enough.
OTHERMALE:Let's just put it all behind us.
LEADFEMALE:What's done is done.
SUPMALE:I just wanna sit here and watch a little TV.
LEADMALE:LENO : Anybody see the Hilary show the other day? They had a dismissed juror from the Show-Biz Madam Case insulting Judge Banks, who just happens to be Hilary's father.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, here's a family that really puts the "fun" back in dysfunctional, isn't it?  Speaking of Judge Banks, we have a special tribute to him tonight.

OTHERMALE:We have $50 riding on it and I'm gonna win.
LEADFEMALE:Who's Tom Jones? Nicky, Nicky.

LEADMALE:You got to break me off some.
OTHERFEMALE:
LEADFEMALE:That movie was pathetic.
SUPMALE:Pathetic.
LEADFEMALE:Naked women bumping and grinding on strangers' laps? And the way them guys just sat there and took it.
LEADFEMALE:How can anyone find that attractive? I mean, is our culture that diseased? You know, just thinking about it is making me feel dirty.
SUPMALE:You know, I'm gonna have to take a shower.
LEADFEMALE:You wanna join me? What am I saying? It's even infected me.
SUPMALE:Hola.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:What'd you guys end up seeing?
OTHERMALE:Showgirls.
LEADMALE:Again? What does that make it, eight times, Will?  Eight times? You told me you hated it.

LEADMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:Wait, but, baby.
LEADMALE:Baby, hol Oh, girl.
SUPFEMALE:Boy, did you handle that badly.
LEADMALE:Oh, good, Geoffrey, you're here.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:When did I ever ask you for anything? You never stopped asking from the moment I started here.
LEADFEMALE:That's not true.
OTHERMALE:In fact, as I remember I spent my first seven hours of service here installing wall-to-wall carpet for Barbie's Dream House.
SUPFEMALE:Carpet which had to be promptly removed.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's not my fault that when Ken got home, he didn't like it.
SUPFEMALE:And it wasn't my fault the dollhouse burnt to the ground.
LEADMALE:Geoffrey, Skipper died in that fire.
SUPMALE:I don't even wanna think about it.
LEADMALE:Look, I need you to hem this dress.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPMALE:Hi, Daddy.
SUPMALE:Hi, baby.
SUPFEMALE:Have you seen the notes I've been working on for my speech tomorrow? They're right here, big guy.
LEADFEMALE:I've crossed out what didn't work and rewritten the rest.
SUPMALE:How thoughtful.
LEADMALE:Daddy, can I use your car tonight?
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:How about Mom's?
SUPFEMALE:Talk to her.
LEADMALE:Mom, Dad said it's okay for me to use your car tonight.
LEADMALE:I didn't say that.
LEADMALE:Those weren't your exact words, Uncle Phil, but you kind of did imply that You know, there was absolutely no reason for me to jump in here, was there? None whatsoever.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna go ahead and jump out of here.
LEADMALE:Yes, jump on with your bad self.
LEADMALE:It's fine if you take the car, honey.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Ashley's going out tonight.
OTHERMALE:I've given Geoffrey the night off and Nicky's going to his first sleepover.
LEADMALE:PHIL: Mm-hm.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, the house will be nice and quiet.
LEADMALE:Mm.
SUPMALE:You know what that means?
LEADMALE:Yeah, I can finally finish my speech.
LEADMALE:Philip.
LEADFEMALE:What?
LEADMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:Nobody said anything.
SUPMALE:Nicky's first sleepover.
SUPMALE:Ahh.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never forget my first overnighter.
OTHERMALE:Ned Martin's house.

OTHERFEMALE:So you wanna go out tonight? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:No can do.
SUPMALE:I have to study tonight.
SUPMALE:On Saturday night? For some, it's bath night.
SUPMALE:For me, it's math night.
SUPMALE:But, hey, maybe you could help me?
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'd probably just get in your way.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're probably right.
LEADMALE:Well, bye.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:She seems a bit of a gloomy Gus.
LEADMALE:I can't believe Michelle hasn't called.
LEADMALE:I've left messages.
OTHERFEMALE:I've paged her.
LEADMALE:Oh, God, I hope she's not disgruntled.
LEADFEMALE:You better be worrying about me being disgruntled after the way you messed my date up today.
SUPMALE:Will, I've come to the realization I don't understand women.
LEADMALE:Or men, for that matter.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should just talk to my Dad.
SUPMALE:He understands women.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry about before.
LEADMALE:We're gonna have a great time tonight, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:A great time.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying? I love you.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Do you? Sweetheart, I just said I did.
LEADMALE:And you look beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Philip.
LEADMALE:I'm serious.
LEADFEMALE:For someone who's had four children, you look amazing.
SUPFEMALE:Sandra, I'm telling you.
LEADFEMALE:I really hated that movie.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:I guess in some sick kind of way I was just trying to punish myself.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:You're right.
LEADFEMALE:No, I can be serious.
OTHERMALE:Ju Let me prove it to you.
LEADFEMALE:Sandra, I seriously wanna go out with you tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Your cousin? No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, I can find somebody to go out with your cousin, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no.
OTHERFEMALE:That's no problem at all.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, and I got the perfect guy for the job.
SUPMALE:All right, baby, you're the breast Best! Best! I said best! CARLTON: No.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, Carlton.
LEADMALE:Come on, man.
LEADMALE:You owe me.
OTHERMALE:You almost wrecked everything with Sandra.
SUPMALE:I'm not gonna do it.
LEADMALE:Oh, you're not gonna do it.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what? That's fine.
LEADMALE:It's probably time for me to move on anyway, you know.
LEADFEMALE:As luck would have it, it's come to my attention that there's this cute little mail carrier that's available.
OTHERFEMALE:You wouldn't.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
SUPFEMALE:But that would be exactly what you deserved.
SUPMALE:Will, I'm sorry and I know I owe you one.
SUPFEMALE:But I just wouldn't feel right going out and having a good time without Michelle.
LEADMALE:What if I could promise you a terrible time? If I could only be sure.
LEADFEMALE:I guarantee you the worst time that you have ever had in your life.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:We finally have the house all to ourselves.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Don't stop.
SUPFEMALE:Go on with whatever you're doing.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:Ew.
OTHERFEMALE:What were you doing? I don't even wanna think about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's Geoffrey?
LEADFEMALE:He's got the night off.
LEADFEMALE:What about my dress? I'm pretty sure he was wearing pants.
LEADFEMALE:Eww.
SUPMALE:Oh, let me tell you now, that there was some good grub.
LEADFEMALE:That girl can cook.
LEADFEMALE:What about you, Carlton? Did you enjoy your dinner? It was fine.
SUPMALE:You don't talk much, do you? Uhh, as a child, he was dropped on his tongue.
OTHERMALE:I think he's the strong silent type.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:You are strong.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm no stranger to the gym.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, how about some dessert? I've got ice cream.
SUPMALE:Sweet chocolate ice cream.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a tutti-frutti man myself.
LEADMALE:What the heck is wrong with you, Carlton? That girl just offered you two scoops.
LEADFEMALE:I'm afraid I'm a one-gal guy.
LEADFEMALE:What's so funny? We were just thinking of a little game we could play.
LEADMALE:Tiffany.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Sandra.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll be fun.
LEADMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:What'll be fun?
SUPFEMALE:A word game.
LEADMALE:Oh, that ain't exactly the kind of a game I was thinking about.
SUPMALE:It involves the word "strip.
LEADMALE:" Set it up.
LEADMALE:Tell me this, Doogie.
LEADMALE:How is it possible that we're losing? I can't pull a vowel to save my life.
LEADFEMALE:As soon as you get warm, I wanna see some skin again.
LEADMALE:You're on the demanding side, ain't you, girl?
SUPMALE:Hey, just play them or lose them.
LEADMALE:Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:This thing is not over yet.
SUPFEMALE:Ah! Four.

LEADFEMALE:Hey, would you? Hey, hey, hey.

OTHERMALE:I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
LEADFEMALE:I hate you.
LEADMALE:Shh! The dude is out there.
SUPMALE:He's gonna hear us.
SUPFEMALE:Hear us? He's gonna kill us.

OTHERMALE:Any regrets? Didn't I tell you he was buff? Hello.
LEADFEMALE:But, I mean, Hilary, weren't you scared? Of course, everyone is.

SUPMALE:Now, are you gonna be the bad cop or not?
LEADMALE:Look, Carlton
SUPMALE:Oh! Come here.

LEADFEMALE:You'd have us do nothing?
LEADFEMALE:I didn't say we ain't gonna do nothing.

LEADMALE:All right, are you two in trouble with a bookie or something?
LEADFEMALE:Let's stop beating around the bush.
SUPMALE:Hey, man.
OTHERMALE:You're playing chess, your rook has been blindsided by the queen's gambit.

LEADMALE:We were roaming.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe you guys invaded my privacy.

SUPMALE:Well, does it bother you that you're leaving tomorrow? Well, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Does it bother you? I think it does.
SUPFEMALE:Would you rather not do this? I just never thought my first time would be with someone who was leaving me.
OTHERFEMALE:What if we never see each other again?
SUPFEMALE:Ash, we'll see each other again.
LEADFEMALE:Then we really don't have to rush.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Baby, you don't have to apologize to me.

LEADFEMALE:You remember the first time I asked you about sex? You panicked then too.
OTHERFEMALE:I did not.
LEADMALE:Yes, you did.
LEADMALE:You said that you needed to have a license to have sex and that I couldn't even take the test until I was 35.
OTHERFEMALE:That's true.

LEADMALE:All right, come here.
OTHERFEMALE:CARLTON : That was so beautiful.
LEADMALE:
LEADFEMALE:So this is what you wanna do, huh? You think you want some of me, huh? Let's go.

LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:But, son, this isn't just a birthday, this is your 21st birthday.
LEADFEMALE:And this isn't just a trip, it's a rite of passage.
OTHERMALE:Cheyenne Indians used to take a young brave and leave him in the desert and he'd have to fend for himself with nothing but a knife.
SUPMALE:But when he left that desert, he was a man.
OTHERMALE:There's certainly some places in this desert where a brother can become a man.
SUPMALE:I don't know where none of them at, you know, you know, but I'm gonna go ahead and get my knife.
SUPMALE: WOMEN: Aww.
LEADMALE:Okay, ladies, I'm leaving.
LEADMALE:They don't hear you, sir.
SUPMALE:They've begun their women's weekend.
SUPMALE:Right now, they're in phase one.
LEADFEMALE:Chick flicks and mint Milanos.
LEADMALE:I said, I'm leaving.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it's not like you're going off to war, sir.
LEADMALE:I just know that one day Thelma and Louise will make it to the other side of the canyon.
LEADFEMALE:CARLTON: Somebody pinch me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm in the same city with Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, and Engelbert Humperdinck.
SUPFEMALE:So many shows, so little time.
SUPFEMALE:Ugh.
LEADMALE:WILL: I can't believe I'm in the same city as Girls, Girls, Girls.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! So many shows, so little time.
OTHERMALE:Whoo-hoo! Bells ringing, money flowing.
OTHERFEMALE:We are certainly not in Kansas anymore.
SUPMALE:Oh, Auntie Em, Dorothy got a miniskirt on.
LEADFEMALE:We've entered the world of temptation.
SUPFEMALE:A word to the wise, beware.
LEADMALE:All right, here's the plan.
LEADMALE:First, we split up
LEADFEMALE:And?
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:We just split up.
LEADMALE:All right, I get it.
LEADFEMALE:We'll gamble for about an hour or so, but then we have to hit the hay.
LEADFEMALE:We don't wanna miss sunrise at Hoover Dam.
SUPFEMALE:They say it starts out mauve.
SUPFEMALE:You're an odd little man, aren't you? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Change for a dollar, please.
OTHERFEMALE:There's a $5 minimum, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Outrageous.
LEADFEMALE:We're out of here, Will.
LEADMALE:Whoa, wait a minute, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Relax, man.
LEADMALE:Can I get change for 100, please? A hundred? Are you insane? Change 100.
LEADMALE:See, she can't believe it either.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:"You're at a friend's house for Christmas dinner and you find a dead cockroach in your salad.
SUPMALE:What do you do?" I eat around it, because cockroaches go straight to my thighs.
LEADFEMALE:I'd switch plates with Carlton.
LEADMALE:HILARY: Ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Okay, Hilary, it's your turn.
LEADFEMALE:I'll ask you a question.
LEADMALE:"Would it bother you much if upon your death your body was simply thrown into the woods and abandoned?" Does it say what I'm wearing?  Geoffrey, you scared us.
SUPMALE:Ahem.

LEADFEMALE:What you mean "we"? Well, after I maxed out all my credit cards Carlton, you maxed out all your credit cards? I had to.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't get full value for the airline tickets.
SUPFEMALE:You hocked our airline tickets? Well, what do you expect? I only got $200 out of your ATM card.

SUPMALE:You know, I tried to walk away but the crap table just kept calling me.
LEADMALE:"Carlton.
LEADMALE:Carlton.
SUPFEMALE:" And then the blackjack table was saying, "You can do it.
LEADFEMALE:" And then the slot machines just started yelling: "Hey, you tall handsome guy, come shake my hand.
OTHERMALE:" These are all my new friends.
LEADFEMALE:My God, they're pumping a lot of oxygen into this room.
SUPMALE:That was the worst night of my life.
LEADMALE:Tossing and turning, thinking about that mouse.

SUPFEMALE:Mommy, Ashley's bothering me.
SUPMALE:Ashley, stop bothering your sister.
SUPMALE:Big baby.
LEADMALE:She did it again.
SUPMALE:We have the whole day to ourselves without men.
LEADFEMALE:So, what are we gonna do?
SUPFEMALE:Go to the mall and scam on guys.
OTHERMALE:See, Mom, she is so immature.
LEADFEMALE:It's Saturday, the guys are at the gym.
LEADMALE:I think the whole point of this is for us to bond without men.
SUPMALE:Can we talk about men?
LEADMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Not even negatively?
LEADFEMALE:What you got? Okay, tell me something.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, are all men hard of hearing or is it just that they don't wanna listen to anything we have to say? Right.
OTHERMALE:We have to listen until we're blue in the face about cars, sports money, their precious careers, and then if we wanna talk about something that's really important to us, they can't be bothered.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, how about this? How about when they never listen? Heh.
SUPMALE:Wow, Will, the casino's head office.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you just feel the money? I mean, my God, look at all the animal heads in here.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out of a hat.

LEADMALE:"Shut the hell up.

LEADFEMALE:I mean, they are really excited.
OTHERMALE:And they're saying to themselves: "Wow, look at these guys.
LEADMALE:They're losing, but look how much fun they're having.

SUPFEMALE:But how is a brave suppose to concentrate with all these bells and whistles? Not to mention the keno girls.
LEADMALE:How am I gonna call my father and tell him I'm an utter and absolute failure? I don't think it's gonna be the shock that you think it is.
SUPMALE:Well, at least I know it's over.
OTHERFEMALE:The insanity is done.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Carlton again.
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, look, a quarter.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's mine.

OTHERFEMALE:This is not the first Philip Banks pie-jacking.
LEADMALE:Son, son, I have been jacking pies since, what, Thanksgiving 1953.
LEADFEMALE:Rhubarb.
OTHERMALE:Tart little thing.
LEADFEMALE:From then on, the dog ate the pie.
OTHERMALE: Hey.
SUPFEMALE:So I guess it's your nose I should've been shoving in the pan.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, actually, keeping his nose out of the pan would have been more of a punishment.
SUPMALE:Get off of me.
LEADMALE:Mother.
LEADMALE:My sweet Mommy.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:I've got a few secrets of my own.

LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma Hattie, the pie hider.
SUPFEMALE:Aah!
SUPMALE:I suppose the dog ate this one too.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't had nothing to do with it.
OTHERMALE:He ate it.
LEADFEMALE:You always trying to blame somebody.
LEADMALE:Out of here.

LEADFEMALE:Well, it's off to the shelter.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's wonderful that you're helping the less fortunate on Thanksgiving.
LEADFEMALE:I guess.
SUPFEMALE:Did I tell you that Channel Four is sending a camera crew down to cover this? God knows that The Hilary Show could use some publicity.
OTHERFEMALE:There is no limit to your giving, is there, Miss Hilary? Thank you, Geoffrey, that's so sweet.
LEADMALE:All set? I'm not going.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Carlton, didn't you call down to the shelter and volunteer? I called down and put my name on a volunteer list.
LEADMALE:But I'm not physically going down there.
SUPMALE:But don't worry, it'll still look good on my r√©sum√©.
LEADMALE:Carlton, if you said you were going down to help, you get down there.
SUPMALE:But, Mom, I can't drive through that part of town.
SUPMALE:There are homeless people down there.
LEADMALE:Okay, fine.
SUPFEMALE:But before I go, I'm taking the pennies out of my loafers.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, where they at?  Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my goodness.
LEADFEMALE:You get prettier every year, sweetie.
LEADFEMALE:It's like looking in a mirror.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry we have to go, but they're expecting us down at the shelter.
SUPMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:We'll see you later.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:HATTIE: All right, all right.
SUPMALE:Hear that, Vy? They're off to help at the shelter.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Isn't she a saint? A regular Mother Teresa.
LEADFEMALE:How was the trip?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, a little bumpy.
SUPMALE:Turbulence? No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:For five hours straight, Helen never stopped moving.
SUPMALE:Well, that's why I've always had a boyfriend.
SUPFEMALE:You know that's right.
LEADMALE:Hattie girl, you look younger every time I see you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you're just saying that.
LEADMALE:Oh, but don't feel you have to stop.
LEADMALE:Hi, Aunt Vy.
SUPMALE:Hi, Aunt Helen.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ashley, sweetie pie.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:How you doing? I guess you're gonna be rolling up those sleeves and helping us in the kitchen? I can't wait to get elbow deep in them turkey gizzards.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, you need to get cable.
LEADFEMALE:Just because I'm a woman, I'm suppose to don an apron on Thanksgiving? I don't think so.
OTHERMALE:Well, I guess somebody burned their training bra.
SUPFEMALE:Aunt Helen, you ever heard of traveling light? And that's probably just her makeup.
SUPMALE:Oh, sweetie, is it your back?
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I told you the pressures of that trial were gonna get to you.
LEADFEMALE:Are you okay, son?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be all right, Momma.
LEADFEMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Now, get that trunk out of here.
SUPFEMALE:We need this space to cook in.
OTHERFEMALE:And I gotta get back to my stuffing.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, no.
LEADFEMALE:You made the stuffing last year.
LEADMALE:That's because you were sick.
SUPMALE:This is my natural turn.
SUPMALE:Well, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:It's my turn to make it after you.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now you're guests in my house.
LEADFEMALE:I'll make the stuffing.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, everybody loves it.
LEADFEMALE:Funny, I don't remember voting.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, no offense, you guys but none of you can hold a candle to my stuffing.
SUPFEMALE:That's because it's so dry, it'd go up in flames.
SUPMALE:All I know is, I've been making my stuffing for Philip since he was a boy.
LEADFEMALE:And he always asks for more.
LEADMALE:Oh, we all know what a picky eater he is.
LEADMALE:Now, Will.
LEADMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:You grew up on my stuffing.
SUPMALE:Now, you tell everybody who's the best.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, come on, Mom
SUPMALE:Uh-uh-uh! Excuse us.
LEADFEMALE:Son.
OTHERFEMALE:Son, come here.
LEADMALE:Let me give you a little piece of advice, huh? Never take sides when women are arguing.
LEADMALE:You can't win.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Uncle Phil, this is my mom.
LEADMALE:I think it'll be all right.
LEADMALE:Look at me, boy.
LEADMALE:Lesson number one, whatever you say is wrong.
LEADMALE:We're all family here, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think it's quite that serious.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mom, I think that your stuffing is the best in the world.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh, I mean I'm saying At least that's what I thought before I tried Grandma Hattie's herb stuffing.
SUPFEMALE:Whoo! Hey, what is it in there, the rosemary that just drives me crazy? What? Um Well, I mean, nothing compares to Aunt Helen's mushroom and bacon stuffing.
LEADFEMALE:Ain't that right, Uncle Phil? Tsk, tsk, tsk.
OTHERMALE:Will? Well, Aunt Viv.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, when I first tried your apricot stuffing I was like, "Whoo!" Ain't that right, Uncle Phil? Heh.
LEADMALE:You gonna leave me hanging out here like this, huh? How about y'all make them all?
LEADFEMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, yes.
OTHERMALE:Okay, I'm for that.
LEADMALE:I guess I'll get to cook this year.
OTHERFEMALE:And you can judge which is best.
LEADFEMALE:The both of you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPMALE:Have you ever seen so many fashion don'ts in one room? Okay, Hill.
LEADFEMALE:Look, here's the plan.
OTHERFEMALE:We get in, do our good deed and get out.

LEADMALE:Just push your little onions right over there.
SUPMALE:You can't make no VIVIAN: Did you move that luggage yet? We'll get it right after this play, Aunt Viv.

SUPFEMALE:Is that a short joke? Why, did it go over your head? Now, that was a short joke.
SUPMALE:Look, you mangy little rapscallion Hey, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Wilmore.
SUPMALE:I'm just giving the customers what they want.
OTHERFEMALE:How about some more turkey, young fella? Just tell me when.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? This food has to feed everybody.
LEADFEMALE:For somebody who wants to go to Princeton, I'd expect more common sense.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you ought to look into community college.
LEADMALE:Hold on, there.
LEADMALE:I ain't done yet.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Ain't you that beautiful lady from before? Oh, yes, I am.
OTHERFEMALE:Damn, baby.
LEADMALE:Look like somebody hit you with an ugly stick.
LEADMALE:Sylvia, you can tell Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Wilmore that I quit.
SUPMALE:Is that what you want me to tell the news crew when they show up? You wouldn't.
LEADMALE:Try me.
LEADMALE:This isn't fair.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, please don't be mean to me.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess you don't have to be any kind of actress to be a talk-show host.
SUPFEMALE:Great, a critic.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see why you're making me clear dishes.
OTHERFEMALE:You wanna wash?  That's a good one.
LEADFEMALE:No, I was thinking of something more along the line of hostessing.
LEADMALE:I could greet the people as they come in with a smile and hand them their menus and take them to their seats.
LEADMALE:Clear.
LEADMALE:I'll split my tips with you.
SUPMALE:Clear.
SUPFEMALE:Are you all right?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:Take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, hi.
LEADMALE:Let's go here and let's lay you down on the couch so you can get comfortable.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:All right, we're gonna go down on the count of three.
SUPMALE:You ready? I'm gonna go ahead and let you take your own count.
LEADMALE:Don't touch me.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:How you doing? May I help you? Actually, it's for my uncle, you know? He needs a deep-tissue massage.
OTHERFEMALE:As you can see, the brother do got some deep tissue.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm saying? You know? What about you? Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:I'm cool.
LEADFEMALE:I'm all right, thanks.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give you the massage personally.
SUPMALE:Actually, I do got a kink right in here, you know.
SUPMALE:Very tight.
LEADMALE:Is dinner ready yet? Not quite, honey.
OTHERMALE:Almost.
LEADFEMALE:Well, can't you just hit me with a little somethin'-somethin'? Not until dinner, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Aw, man.
LEADMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:I make this stuffing for all my men.
LEADMALE:And they always come back for more.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, because they forgot their shoes.
LEADMALE:You're just jealous, Vy.
LEADMALE:Jealous because I'm fine.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Fine.
OTHERMALE:Well, I've been told that I'm very sexy.
SUPMALE:Nine hundred numbers don't count.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:What do you think? Who's more desirable? It's a tie.
LEADMALE:You both lose.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ashley, honey, would you like to help? Help set women back a hundred years? No, thank you.
SUPMALE:Oh, shut up, Ashley.
LEADMALE:Just my luck.
LEADFEMALE:There's some fire that's delayed the news crew.
LEADMALE:They might not make it here.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you just can't catch a break, can you? You do understand.
LEADMALE:Oh, who asked you, anyway? Hey, uh, I didn't get you in trouble with the old man, did I? Move it along, rat boy.
LEADMALE:And I didn't mean anything by the short crack.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't there a vending machine you should be kicking over or some other havoc you should be wreaking? Oh, I see.
SUPFEMALE:Just because I'm in a place like this, I should be committing crimes? What kind of a narrow-minded elitist view of the world do you have? You come down here once a year, give a guy a couple slices of turkey and all of a sudden you think you're better than he is? I didn't mean anything by it.
SUPFEMALE:I had you going.
LEADFEMALE:You're a gullible little fellow, aren't you? Today is your lucky day.
LEADMALE:You get a choice of body oils.
LEADMALE:We have cinnamon, honeysuckle and our holiday special, cranberry.
SUPFEMALE:Do you have anything a little lower in cholesterol?  Baby, you could use Pennzoil, olive oil hell, you can even buff me up with some Turtle Wax.
LEADMALE:I don't care.
LEADMALE:Just work it, girl.
LEADMALE:Oh, this is heavenly.
LEADMALE:Oh! Oh, that's definitely the right spot.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that is definitely my spot.
LEADFEMALE:How you living over there, Uncle Phil? I believe the correct term is large.
OTHERMALE:How about you? Oh, it is all good.
LEADMALE:Would you like the special? Baby, I will take the special with a side of coleslaw and some extra biscuits.
OTHERMALE:One special coming right up.
LEADMALE:Will, we're getting out of here.
LEADMALE:Uh, yeah, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:You go ahead and warm the car up.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be out in about 10 minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Now! Call me.
SUPMALE:You call me.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
LEADMALE:No big deal.
LEADMALE:Freeze.
LEADFEMALE:PHIL: Oh! Yeah, maybe this is a big deal, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: It's off to the shelter.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, I think it's wonderful that you're helping less fortunate on Thanksgiving.
SUPFEMALE:Sylvia, you can tell Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Wilmore that I quit.
SUPMALE:Is that what you want me to tell the news crew when they show up?
SUPMALE:You wouldn't.
SUPFEMALE:Try me.
LEADMALE:Two
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, man!
LEADFEMALE:Aah-aah-aah! Oh!
LEADMALE:Look at this guy.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this guy.
LEADMALE:Mommy, Daddy's fallen and he can't get up! One special coming right up.
LEADMALE:I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
LEADFEMALE:This ain't no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Freeze! Maybe this is a big deal, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Well, well, well, what do we have here?
LEADMALE:It's an honor, Your Honor.
OTHERMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:That's very amusing, Hendricks.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you save us all a lot of trouble and just drop this nonsense? It's not up to me to drop it only the DA can make that call, but I thought you'd know that.
OTHERMALE:Look, the DA is not gonna file on this.
OTHERMALE:It's garbage.
LEADMALE:Nothing happened.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Well, we can't say nothing happened, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:You know, there was a couple of butt-naked honeys scattered around that place.
LEADFEMALE:When the press gets ahold of this, they're gonna have a field day.
LEADFEMALE:Lock them up.
SUPMALE:Oh, all right, I guess you just gonna do us like this, huh, bro? Just like that? I guess you wasn't at the Million Man March, huh? Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Wait, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:This cell ain't full yet.
OTHERFEMALE:Hold up, hold up.
LEADMALE:My back.
LEADFEMALE:My back.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:Mm, mm.
OTHERFEMALE:Another year, another hairdo.
OTHERFEMALE:Who you trying to catch, Hattie?  I guess you and Will gonna be hitting one of them all-night Thanksgiving jams, huh? Oh, girl, that boy couldn't keep up with me if I gave him a head start.
SUPFEMALE:I've got one more outside.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go get it.
LEADFEMALE:He's a hunk.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Did you see the way he was looking at me? Girl, that man wasn't looking at you, he was looking at me.
OTHERFEMALE:Tsk.
LEADMALE:Looking at me like it was lunchtime and my legs was Colonel Sanders' extra crispy.
OTHERFEMALE:Wasn't he, Geoffrey? If you mean something fast and cheap, yes.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Skippy.
SUPMALE:Skippy.
LEADMALE:What's up? Uncle Phil, they cannot make these charges stick, man.
LEADMALE:You said that yourself.
LEADMALE:Will you be my friend? Um No.
SUPMALE:Wait, Uncle Phil, where you going?
SUPMALE:I'm gonna call my lawyer.
LEADMALE:Wait, wait, wait.
SUPMALE:Uncle Phil, you might know your way around the mean streets of Bel-Air but I think you better let me handle this brother on the phone, all right? Hold up.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, bro, phone check.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, we got an important call to make.
LEADMALE:What's the big deal anyway? It wouldn't be the first time you broke somebody's legs.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I love you too, Mama.
SUPFEMALE:You want the phone? Uh Y-yes, please.
SUPFEMALE:It's yours.
SUPFEMALE:It's for you.
SUPFEMALE:Those don't go there.
LEADMALE:Yes, they do.
LEADFEMALE:You said before
OTHERFEMALE:No, I told you those go in the back.
SUPFEMALE:I should expect that from someone who's probably never cleaned a dish in their life.
OTHERMALE:What's your problem? From the first second I got here, you've been on me like I've done something wrong.
LEADMALE:Maybe I don't come to places like this and do this kind of work as often as I could.
OTHERFEMALE:And maybe sometimes I say things that sound insensitive and self-centered but that's who I am, damn it.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't make me a bad person.
SUPMALE:Just because you volunteer more days a year than I do doesn't mean you're better than me.
LEADMALE:I didn't volunteer at all.
SUPMALE:Oh, so you're paid to be here.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, I live here.
OTHERMALE:So the plates go in the back? That's it.
OTHERFEMALE:There's nothing left.
LEADMALE:WOMAN: What do you mean?
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, folks.
LEADFEMALE:We're out.
LEADFEMALE:ALL: Aww.
LEADFEMALE:This is terrible.
SUPFEMALE:How did this happen? There's just so many more mouths than there is money to feed them.
OTHERMALE:You had some letter you wanted me to sign.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna thank you both very much for your time and your help.
SUPMALE:Happy Thanksgiving.
SUPMALE: I'm thinking that in a week when we look back on this, we are just gonna laugh.
OTHERMALE:Maybe two weeks.
SUPFEMALE:I got it.
LEADMALE:Edison Field, fall of 1967.
LEADMALE:That was the Dartmouth game.
LEADFEMALE:Tiny Williams.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:And you're Big Phil Banks.
LEADMALE:How you doing? Wait a minute, so you guys are old college buddies.
LEADMALE:Hey, it's a good thing, man I thought we was gonna have to Bruce Lee you up in here, you know?  Skippy? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I haven't seen you since you had your accident in the big game.
SUPFEMALE:That was no accident at all.
LEADMALE:That was clipping.
LEADMALE:That's not what the referee said.
SUPFEMALE:What about that shot to the helmet during the last play? What was that? A shot to the helmet? Oh  So how you been? Man, my knee was never the same after that game.
SUPMALE:Lost my scholarship, had to leave school, and then I got drafted.
OTHERMALE:Ended up with a head full of shrapnel.
LEADMALE:Couldn't hold a job once I got back.
LEADFEMALE:So to make a few bucks, I drove a friend's car a cross-country for him.
SUPFEMALE:What he didn't tell me was there was 40 pounds of pot in the trunk.
SUPFEMALE:I did 10 hard years, and finally got out.
LEADMALE:But after that, my life started to go bad.
OTHERMALE:How about you, Banks? About the same.
LEADMALE:Why aren't you talking? I'm not, not talking.
LEADMALE:I'm just not talking.
LEADMALE:Why aren't you talking?
LEADMALE:I am talking.
SUPMALE:I'm the one who just asked a question.
LEADMALE:You're the one not talking.
SUPMALE:Having to participate in this inane conversation would keep anyone from talking.
OTHERMALE:Well, I think you're feeling guilty and that's why you're not talking.
LEADMALE:What in the world would I have to feel guilty about? You profited from another's misfortune.
OTHERMALE:You're the one who went to the shelter to get the free publicity.
SUPFEMALE:You're the one with a letter of recommendation in his pocket.
SUPMALE:Face it, you're a taker.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a taker? Miss "Daddy, can I have $300?" Right, Mr.
LEADMALE:"Hey, Big Guy can I have a copy of your will in case something happens to you?" That's called prudent planning.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, if your last name's Menendez.
SUPMALE:You're doing it again.
LEADMALE:What? Not talking.
OTHERMALE:Your guilt will consume you.
LEADMALE:See, you're a nag.
LEADFEMALE:That's exactly why you don't have a boyfriend.
LEADMALE:And you're a taker.
SUPMALE:Nag.
SUPFEMALE:Taker.
LEADFEMALE:Nag.
OTHERMALE:Taker.
SUPFEMALE:Nag.
SUPMALE:Taker.
LEADFEMALE:Nag.
LEADMALE:Watch the road! I wonder why Philip and Will are so late.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe they pulled in, smelled your stuffing and turned back around.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Now, that's a good one.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, yours ain't no better.
LEADFEMALE:It's just like men.
SUPMALE:They're probably at some sports bar puffing cigars, watching football on a big screen completely disregarding the years of suffering that women Shut up, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:I really am worried about Philip and Will.
LEADMALE:Trust me, my son would never miss Thanksgiving dinner.
LEADMALE:It's the holiday.
SUPMALE:Settle in, boys.
SUPMALE:Nobody's going anywhere tonight.
LEADMALE:There's a bug on mine.
SUPFEMALE:You know, a few hours ago, my biggest problem was judging a stuffing contest.
LEADMALE:Now look at me.
LEADMALE:Stuck in a jail cell with some angry You clipped him, didn't you? I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:
LEADMALE:It's the worst Thanksgiving I ever had.
OTHERFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:And thank you so much for sharing it with me.
LEADMALE:Look at us.
SUPFEMALE:All hungry.
LEADMALE:I'm about to dig in to this cream-of-bug sandwich.
LEADMALE:And our family sitting around the dining-room table big gorgeous roasted turkey four different kinds of stuffing.
OTHERFEMALE:Candied yams, and macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes.
LEADFEMALE:And little tiny onions swimming in a sea of cream sauce.
LEADMALE:Hendricks! Listen, Banks, if it's a sandwich you're after, they're all gone.
OTHERFEMALE:In the first place, it's not "Banks" it's "Your Honor.
SUPFEMALE:" Now you get your butt over to that telephone and you pull the district attorney from whatever meal he may be eating and you tell him that you have Judge Philip Banks in jail under a bogus charge.
LEADFEMALE:And you might wanna mention the fact that we have been denied due process.
SUPMALE:A phone call, access to legal representation and every other conceivable right guaranteed to us by the constitution.
LEADMALE:Don't forget to mention that no statements have been taken no witnesses interviewed, and none of the most fundamental procedures that the newest rookie on a beat would know, have been followed.
SUPFEMALE:My nephew and I are completely innocent, and if you don't take care of this it will be you having your picture taken with numbers across your chest.
SUPMALE:And we want $10,000 in unmarked bills and a helicopter on the roof gassed up and ready to take us to Tijuana.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I just kind of got caught up in the moment.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, get your peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
LEADMALE:Grape jelly? You can't make these with no damn grape jelly.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:We're back.
OTHERMALE:ALL: Aww Surprise!  Hey, hey, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:So, what do you think?
OTHERMALE:A caterer for Thanksgiving dinner.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's just as snooty and stuck-up as you can get.
SUPMALE:But I think it's great.
LEADMALE:Everybody's having a good time.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Yeah.
LEADMALE:That is, until it's time for me to do the dishes.
SUPMALE:Sylvia, let me take care of the dishes.
LEADFEMALE:My butler, Geoffrey, can be here in 15 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha.
LEADMALE:How about if we do them together? Then what'll Geoffrey do? Hey, look.
SUPMALE:It's a little turkey from the little turkey.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:A turkey? Hardly.
LEADFEMALE:In point of fact, it's a Cornish game hen.
OTHERFEMALE:A flightless bird hale from the Isle of Wight.
OTHERFEMALE:Braised in cognac with a hint of fennel.
SUPFEMALE:A fitting end for a noble fowl.
OTHERFEMALE:You're kind of weird.
LEADMALE:So you want one or not? No, I probably shouldn't have one, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Wilmore said You know what? This one's on me.
SUPMALE:Cool.
SUPFEMALE:So you gonna be here over Christmas? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Sorry, we're late.
LEADFEMALE:This is going to make a great holiday piece, Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:The public eats up this kind of stuff.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sorry, I don't think so.
OTHERMALE:What? I exploit people every day of the week on my show.
LEADMALE:It's Thanksgiving, I'm gonna take the day off.
LEADMALE:Well, I hope the fire's still burning.
SUPFEMALE:That was really something.
OTHERMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:I wasn't the least bit opportunistic.
OTHERMALE:For the first time in my life, I thought about others instead of myself.
SUPFEMALE:Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tingling all over.
SUPMALE:I'm really proud of you, Hil.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:So are you gonna tear up that letter of recommendation? Oh, Carlton, I'm so proud of you too.
OTHERFEMALE:Judge Banks.
OTHERFEMALE:Shh.
LEADFEMALE:I'm really sorry, Your Honor.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Just tell your boy he'd better be at the next march.
SUPFEMALE:Your limo is here and it's ready to take you and your nephew home.
LEADFEMALE:There's no charges, there's no publicity, and there's no reporters.
LEADMALE:No hard feelings? No chance.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Banks? You done all right for yourself, man.
SUPFEMALE:Take care of yourself, Tiny.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you on the outside, brother.
OTHERMALE:Happy Thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:Same to you.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get the hell out of here.
LEADMALE:Oh, hey, what are we gonna tell Aunt Viv? Will, Will, here's another very important lesson.
LEADFEMALE:When you have a chronic back problem and you go for a therapeutic massage and wind up in a house of ill-repute, which is subsequently raided and you are arrested by mistake never tell your wife.
LEADMALE:Hmm? Poof.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you are definitely the master.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go get some of them tiny onions.
LEADFEMALE: I tell you, I really feel like I connected with those people down at the shelter today.
LEADFEMALE:When I reached out to them, they reached back.
LEADMALE:Of course, I stepped out of the way so they couldn't actually touch me but I really connected.
LEADFEMALE:So, what'd you guys do? Uh
LEADMALE:Nothing.
SUPMALE:Yeah, nada, nadie, nil, nilch, nothing Ah! Look at the bird!  You've outdone yourself, Geoffrey.
OTHERFEMALE:It looks good.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, right here.
LEADFEMALE:Big bird.
OTHERFEMALE:Big bird.
LEADMALE:That is beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:It smells delicious.
SUPMALE:Okay, everyone, let's join hands for the prayer.
LEADFEMALE:Dear Lord, thank you for our many blessings.
SUPMALE:Thank you for our health.
LEADMALE:Thank you for this food.
LEADMALE:But most of all, thank you for keeping us safe and delivering us from Tiny.
LEADMALE:Tiny, as well as larger temptations.
LEADMALE:And thank you for bringing this family together in love and peace.
LEADMALE:Amen.
LEADMALE:ALL: Amen.
LEADFEMALE:A-woman.
SUPMALE:ALL: Oh
SUPFEMALE:Let us get to grubbing.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:
LEADMALE:Oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:That was all so good.
LEADMALE:That was the best Thanksgiving ever.
OTHERFEMALE:Absolutely.
LEADMALE:So, what about the stuffing? Oh, it was delicious.
LEADMALE:Everything was delicious.
LEADMALE:Everything was exactly as delicious as everything else.
LEADFEMALE:So, honey, which one did you like best?   Like you're a young boy, right? You're not gonna tell me which one you liked better?
OTHERFEMALE:Nope.
SUPMALE:Nope.
LEADFEMALE:What about you guys? Nope.
LEADMALE:Then why did we bust our butts cooking all day if you're not gonna give us an answer?
SUPMALE:Really.
OTHERMALE:Because that's all part of the fun of Thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:I guess it was kind of fun when Vy dropped that bag of powdered sugar all over Helen.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, that was not funny to me.
LEADMALE:And I'll never forget the look on Vivian's face when she got her apron caught in the food processor.
LEADMALE:Yeah, talk about being led around by your apron strings.
LEADMALE:It was even fun giving you guys a hard time all day.
SUPMALE:It doesn't matter whose stuffing was best it was just fun being in that kitchen together.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:Listen, I love y'all too but the bottom line is my stuffing was the best.
SUPFEMALE:Any fool can see that.
LEADFEMALE:You tasted it.
SUPFEMALE:You tasted it with your own mouth.
LEADFEMALE:Slaving in that No, I was slaving in that kitchen all day.
SUPFEMALE:I know who I am.
OTHERMALE:I don't care if y'all leave the table.
SUPMALE:Happy Thanksgiving to you too.
SUPMALE:Every man I cook for likes what I cook.
LEADMALE:That's right.
SUPFEMALE:I'm all right.
SUPMALE:I'm getting out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Hah.
LEADMALE:I'm going somewhere for Christmas.
SUPFEMALE:Hah.
SUPMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:There's nothing quite like putting up Christmas decorations.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Hey, what you want for Christmas, Granny? Oh, at my age, you don't need much.
LEADMALE:Just the love of your family.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Cool.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, but at my age, you need a little more.
OTHERMALE:Listen, you mind taking a look at this here? I know you got a little pull with the big guy, you know so I was hoping you'd put in a word for me.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, just let him know that the few times that I have been naughty, it was real nice.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I mean? Heh, heh.
OTHERMALE:ASHLEY: Carlton, what are you doing? Mom said while she was gone, I could decorate the tree.
LEADMALE:No, Mom said while she was gone, I could decorate.
OTHERMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, you take one half of the tree.
SUPMALE:Ashley, you take the other.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, you can have the top half.

OTHERMALE:Oh, your tree? Let me tell you something, missy.
LEADMALE:Get that flocking can away from me.

SUPMALE:Hi, Grandma.
LEADMALE:Hi, honey.
LEADMALE:I'm so glad you're here.
LEADMALE:I need someone to talk to.

LEADFEMALE:And I have this empty feeling, you know, like something's missing? Sure, I have an effervescent personality and a smile that could blind you from across the room but I just feel so blah.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying something, honey? You've gotta talk into my good ear.

LEADFEMALE:And when he's hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Ay! Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:You know, I just remembered I gotta go someplace, uh, where that's not happening.
SUPMALE:Hey, come on, Hil.
LEADMALE:Can't we just stay a little longer? Well, I'm off my shift in 15 minutes.
LEADFEMALE:I can give you a ride.

OTHERFEMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Remember, doc, no mouth-to-mouth on the first date, huh? Ha, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's like a hotel.
LEADFEMALE:They expect you to take this stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Have you taken the roast out of the oven yet, Geoffrey? Show me again how it's done, Nana Hattie.
LEADMALE:Oh, all right.
SUPFEMALE:I love my job.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-mm-mm.
LEADMALE:Grandma Hattie's roast.
LEADFEMALE:You know, a cow would be happy to be in your kitchen.
LEADMALE:Boy, am I happy to be here.
LEADFEMALE:HILARY: Oh, great.
LEADMALE:You're all here.
OTHERFEMALE:I have some really big news.
LEADMALE:No news is bigger than my mother's roast.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna have a baby.
LEADMALE:Now, that would be bigger than the roast.
LEADMALE:Daddy, you're gonna be a grandpa.
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy, say something.
SUPMALE:Geoffrey, get the Scotch.
SUPMALE:It's gone, sir.
LEADFEMALE:What? You've said my attitude has improved lately.
SUPFEMALE:How could this happen? It's the pressure, sir.
LEADMALE:Phil, calm down.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, darling, this doesn't have to be bad news.
LEADFEMALE:Having a child is a gift.
LEADFEMALE:Now, come on, tell Grandma, who's the father? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dear God.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, take your grandmother upstairs.
LEADMALE:Will, takes notes.
SUPMALE:Come on, grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Just how pregnant are you? Who said I was pregnant? I said I was gonna have a baby.
LEADFEMALE:I think Aunt Viv must've dropped the ball on that little girl-girl talk.
OTHERFEMALE:Hilary, you're not making any sense.
LEADMALE:I'm not pregnant yet.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna go down to one of those fertility clinics and find a donor.
LEADFEMALE:After Will and I went to the hospital, I realized what was missing in my life.
LEADFEMALE:I need a baby.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
OTHERMALE:Are you insane? Do you have any idea what having a baby entails, huh? This is madness.
LEADMALE:A baby is a lifetime commitment.
LEADFEMALE:A commitment that a couple makes.
LEADFEMALE:A baby is not a pick-me-up.
LEADFEMALE:Scotch is a pick-me-up.
OTHERMALE:Damn that, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I didn't come here for your permission I came here for your blessing.
SUPMALE:This is your fault.
LEADMALE:Hey, man.
LEADMALE:How you gonna blame me? You're the one who took her to the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Therefore, it's your fault.
LEADFEMALE:There.
LEADMALE:Oh, forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know what I'm saying.
SUPFEMALE:What am I gonna say to Vivian? WILL: Uh "Hi, Grandma"? Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Hoo.
LEADMALE:Thanks for coming, Will.
LEADFEMALE:It's really great to have your support.
SUPFEMALE:No problem.
SUPMALE:When you leave here there'll be no doubt in your mind what you wanna do.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I'd like some information about your, um, inventory.
LEADFEMALE:Are you looking for something specific? What have you got in a hunk? You'll be happy to know that our donors are screened very thoroughly.
SUPMALE:We have everything from doctors to rocket scientists.
OTHERFEMALE:You wouldn't happen to have this month's, would you? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Here you are, doctor.
SUPFEMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:We get lots of doctors.
SUPMALE:Ugh! I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Hey, yo.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, man.
OTHERMALE:Glad I could be of service.
SUPMALE:Hey, come on, let's get out of here.
LEADMALE:Uh I'll catch up to you later.
LEADMALE:Thank you all for joining me on another journey of love, happiness and good cheer.
LEADMALE:So until tomorrow, goodbye.
LEADFEMALE:And remember Okay? Whoo! Hey, good show, Hil.
SUPMALE:I'm glad to see you're feeling better.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what'd you expect? Well, you know, after today, I kind of thought you Oh.
SUPFEMALE:That was just a little setback.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a trouper.
SUPFEMALE:Girl, you are a super-duper trouper.
SUPMALE:Well, I just hope my baby's a super-duper trouper too.
OTHERMALE:Heh, heh.
OTHERMALE:WILL: Huh?
LEADMALE:Baby? DUANE: Hey.
OTHERMALE:You ready?
SUPMALE:Hey, what's up, doc.
LEADMALE:What you doing? Come back to deliver another baby, huh? What, you get a commission on them? No, I came to pick up Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Will.
LEADMALE:On to plan B.
LEADMALE:So how do you like the food?
LEADFEMALE:It's delicious.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:I found this place the first year of my internship.
LEADFEMALE:I was dying for food that didn't come out of a machine.
LEADFEMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADMALE:I spent some time in Milan and this place reminds me of a little restaurant near the Piazza Di Vani.
LEADMALE:So any mental illness in your family? Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me? Schizophrenia? Anorexia? You know, general weirdness? Uh, not that I know of.
SUPFEMALE:So tell me, what were you doing in Italy? Shopping and studying Italian.
LEADMALE:So you speak Italian?
LEADMALE:Well, not exactly.
LEADFEMALE:I did more shopping than studying, but it didn't matter I mean, they have translators in all those little shops.
SUPFEMALE:So back to you.
SUPFEMALE:Any heart disease? Gingivitis? Midgets? No.
LEADFEMALE:Any relatives in the circus? Uh, not that I know of.
SUPFEMALE:I mean I did have an uncle who was a clown.
OTHERMALE:Ew.
LEADFEMALE:Duly noted.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Aren't they so cute? You're so lucky, you get to be around babies all the time.
LEADMALE:Yeah, babies are great.
LEADMALE:I can't wait to have a family someday.
LEADMALE:How about you? I suppose.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so you're not ready for babies, huh? No, I'm definitely ready for a baby, it's just the family.
LEADMALE:I mean I hadn't thought about it, I guess.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADMALE:I mean, how can you have one without the other? Wait, wasn't I the one asking all the questions? Want another hit? Hit me.
SUPFEMALE:PHIL: Ah  What were we thinking about having kids?  What? What? I was wondering what life would've been like without the headaches of parenting.
LEADMALE:Imagine that, if you ain't had no kids.
LEADMALE:It'd just be you, Aunt Viv and me all by ourselves in this big house.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha, ha.
SUPMALE:Party, you know.
SUPMALE:I saw the light on.
SUPFEMALE:Can I talk to you, Daddy? Oh, God, I don't wanna do this.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I'd Daddy, please?
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Will, will you excuse us, please?
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:Sure thing.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look, Uncle Phil, I just want you to know I got your back.
LEADMALE:All right? Anything jump off, all you got to do is holler
LEADMALE:Goodbye, Will.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Where did we go wrong? Well? You said you wanted to talk.
LEADMALE:Daddy, I'm not gonna have a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's a relief.
LEADFEMALE:I must tell you, this whole thing has been very upsetting.
LEADMALE:It's been upsetting for me too.
OTHERMALE:I thought that the show going national was gonna change my life.
LEADMALE:I mean, I had set certain career goals for myself and then when I reached them, I still felt empty.
OTHERFEMALE:Sweetheart, it's fine to have career goals it's wrong to assume that's all you need to make you happy.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPMALE:That's why I thought I needed a baby.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I need a new car.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:I'm kidding, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, God.
SUPFEMALE:I don't have all the answers.
SUPMALE:I wish I did, but I don't.
LEADMALE:You know, it used to be so easy.
LEADMALE:You'd cry, I'd buy you a bracelet.
SUPMALE:You cried louder, maybe some earrings.
LEADMALE:I miss those days.
SUPFEMALE:Just remember happiness comes from inside.
LEADMALE:Hm?
LEADMALE:I love you, Daddy.
OTHERMALE:I love you too, sweetheart.
SUPFEMALE:It's perfect.
OTHERMALE:It's perfect.
SUPFEMALE:I was talking about my side.
OTHERFEMALE:Your side? Please.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen better looking trees hanging from rearview mirrors.
OTHERMALE:Oh, please.
SUPFEMALE:Your side looks like someone threw up on a snowman.
LEADFEMALE:Threw up on a snowman?
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, that's enough, you two.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, now, each side is very nice in its own way.
LEADMALE:You really think so, Will? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I mean, you might've laid the flock on a little thick but other than that, it's very busy.
OTHERFEMALE:Not bad, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Not bad.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm just kind of getting the hang of this parenting thing here, know what I mean? Hey, Dad, I'm heading down to the mall.
SUPFEMALE:Mind if I borrow a few bucks? I'm sorry, I'm busted.
SUPFEMALE:You're gonna have to get back with me later on that one.
LEADMALE:You call that dusting, Geoffrey? Give me that.
SUPMALE:I'll do it myself.
OTHERFEMALE:GEOFFREY: God bless us, everyone
LEADMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Big Nick, what's up, man? I'm working on the model I got for Christmas.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, I wish I got a model for Christmas.
LEADFEMALE:Mm! Five-nine, 120.
SUPFEMALE:Bloo-bloo-blap-blap! Boom! Wouldn't that be hard to put together? I'm just kidding, Nick.
SUPMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:Here, let me help you with this model.
LEADMALE:It's pretty complicated, Will.
SUPMALE:Please, boy, I was putting models together before you was born.
SUPMALE:Come on, pass me that glue.
SUPFEMALE:It's pretty strong stuff, Will.
OTHERFEMALE: Never in the history of pugilistic pursuit has one so completely dominated.
SUPMALE:Muhammad, what do you have to say? I'm the greatest and I'm pretty.
LEADMALE:You know I made you, Howard.
LEADFEMALE:What is going on here? The family vowed to get in shape for the new year.
SUPMALE:We gonna go to the gym.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna take Nicky and put him in a boxing class.
SUPMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Just make sure he learns that boxing is about athleticism and sportsmanship, not violence.
LEADFEMALE:Now I'm gonna get medieval on you.
LEADMALE:We ain't really get to the sportsmanship part yet.
SUPFEMALE:Well, hey, Uncle Phil, why don't you come to the gym with us? Oh, I'd love to, I really would, but I have so much work to do on the trial this morning.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, okay, fine.
LEADMALE:I'm not going because I don't want to.
LEADMALE:And you can't make me.
LEADMALE:So how do I look? Hilary, we're going to the gym.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you're right, fluorescent lights.
LEADFEMALE:I should put on more blush.
LEADMALE:I'm a maniac, maniac on the floor I'm a maniac, maniac You're an idiot.
SUPFEMALE:This is the latest design in workout wear.
SUPFEMALE:Gore-Tex, breathable.
LEADMALE:Specially designed to stop any riding up while on the stair climber.
LEADFEMALE:So, what do you think? I think you look like a family-size tube of Aquafresh.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, what do you think? Honestly.
SUPMALE:I think it's the most ridiculous costume I've ever seen.
SUPMALE:I stand corrected.
LEADMALE:Hey, Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:All ready for your first day at work? What was I thinking telling Daddy I'd pay for half my car? I feel like a dork.
LEADMALE:And I have to wear this same stupid uniform day after day after day.
SUPMALE:Gee, wouldn't that suck? Hey, hey, Nicky.
LEADFEMALE:Got you all signed up for your boxing lesson.
OTHERFEMALE:So I'll meet you over by the ring later?
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna float like a butterfly and stink like a bee.
LEADMALE:That's close enough, all right.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:I'm already starting to feel the burn.
OTHERMALE:Tight as them pants are, you probably started a forest fire in your drawers.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, Will, I have a workout to do.
LEADMALE:Hey, Carlton, I was reading this.
SUPFEMALE:It says here they have personal trainers.
LEADMALE:Why don't you get one? No need, Will.
LEADMALE:Carlton Banks is gym savvy.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERMALE:Ugh! Help! Help! Help! Get it off of me!
SUPMALE:Help!
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
OTHERMALE:You okay? Me? Of course, I'm fine.
SUPMALE:I always scream like a girl when I'm working out.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha, ha.
OTHERMALE:Stan Callahan.
LEADMALE:I'm the gym's personal trainer.
LEADMALE:Have you given any thoughts to private sessions? Well, I don't really need a personal trainer.
LEADMALE:As you can see, I've already got a good base.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, let's take a look.
SUPFEMALE:Well, according to this, you're a can of Crisco.
LEADFEMALE:But spread over a good base, right? Hey, I think you're just right for the gold package, huh? Gold?
SUPMALE:I think I like the sound of that.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Will, how do you turn these on?
LEADFEMALE:You gotta work them yourself, Hil.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ew! I'm starting to sweat.
LEADFEMALE:Ninety-eight 99 100.
LEADFEMALE:Argh! Whoo! That was a heck of a workout.
LEADMALE:What do you say we hit the showers? Okay, let's get you started with a little aerobic exercise just to get the heart rate up.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a plan, Stan.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'm gonna program it for a brisk walk and check on you in 10 minutes.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:  Ah!  Yeah, well I don't know about you but I'm thinking after these hard workouts we both might need a little massage, you know.
LEADFEMALE:What you say I bring the oils? Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:Hell, no.
LEADFEMALE:Now, remember, a clean uniform is a happy uniform.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha.
OTHERMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now, what's our motto? I represent Dippity Do Dog the best doggone dog-dipping restaurant in the world.

LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Dip a dog.
LEADMALE:Excuse me? Dip.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Dip, dip, dip.
SUPMALE:Dip.

LEADFEMALE:"

LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.

OTHERMALE:You know, I got a better idea.
LEADMALE:Why don't you get back to your workout, you no-good, yellow-bellied waste of skin! Huh? The only thing you'll be drinking is my boot if you don't get back on that machine, you no-good pansy! I don't believe the gold package said anything about rudeness.

SUPFEMALE:Helena said I was the best in the class.
SUPFEMALE:Helena? Wait a minute, you're the boxing instructor? You got a problem with that? Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:You know, cute little gloves, nice tight little outfit.
OTHERFEMALE:Works for you, cutie.
LEADMALE:Now, there's a typical male attitude.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:No disrespect.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying, you know, female boxers ain't exactly common.
LEADMALE:Ain't nobody ever heard of Muhammad Ali Sheedy, you know.
LEADMALE:You know, it's Sonny Liston, it's not Sonny and Cher Liston.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying.
SUPFEMALE:Sounds like you're saying you wanna put on some gloves and spar with me.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:How'd it sound like that? Heh, heh, heh.
SUPMALE:You don't want to? Oh, no You know what? My mom told me never hit a lady.
LEADMALE:Because you're not fast enough? Ah!  That's a good one.
LEADFEMALE:That's a good one.

LEADFEMALE:All right, that's enough.
LEADMALE:Come on, you kids get out of here.

SUPFEMALE:Go, go.
OTHERMALE:Stop right there or I'll get my sister to come after you!  You bring your sister over here, I'll knock her block off! Don't let them bother you, Master William.
OTHERMALE:You know, I once had a chum back in England who was in this identical predicament.
SUPMALE:He too was being ridiculed by his peers for suffering defeat at the hands of a lady.
LEADMALE:Oh, and he came through it all right? How should I know? You expect me to keep in touch with a wuss like that? WILL: Hey, what happened to you? Nazi trainer made muscles sore.
SUPMALE:Ugh.
SUPMALE:Dude, you look bad.
SUPFEMALE:Could be worse.
LEADFEMALE:Could be laughingstock of gym like you.
LEADFEMALE:
SUPMALE:So how you feeling, Will?
LEADFEMALE:Not great.
SUPMALE:Son, there's a lesson to be learned here.
LEADFEMALE:Just because you got defeated by a, heh, woman, doesn't make you any less of a man.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I know that, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:I can understand your being embarrassed by being clocked by someone half your size, but you'll get past it.
LEADMALE:I'm feeling better already.
LEADFEMALE:The sheer humiliation alone You know, I get it, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:I just had the worst day of my life.
SUPMALE:Well, at least I didn't get beat up by a girl.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? What's going on? Mind if I pedal with you? That's my bike.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see your name on it.
OTHERFEMALE:I said, that's my machine.
SUPMALE:Uh Look, why don't you go get a eucalyptus wrap and some facials and stuff? Ow! Argh!  Hey.
LEADMALE:You messed up my count.
LEADFEMALE:I hate it when people mess up my count.
SUPMALE:WILL: Oh, no.
SUPMALE:While you're in here why don't you just work out, okay? Here, hold this.
OTHERMALE:It's lover boy again.
LEADMALE:What do you say we go for a little spin?  I have my whole agenda planned.
LEADMALE:First, I have an apple wrap then a hot-oil massage, finishing with an aroma-therapy facial.
LEADMALE:I'll be lucky if I'm able to walk tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Well, today I have a little agenda of my own.
LEADMALE:I'm telling Stan we're through, nada mas, kaputski.
LEADFEMALE:STAN: Banks!
LEADFEMALE:Coming.
LEADMALE:Banks, you're late.
SUPFEMALE:Drop and give me 20.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, but that doesn't leave much for yogurt.
SUPMALE:I have to give you credit for showing up here again so soon.
SUPFEMALE:Why? I ain't got nothing to be afraid of.
OTHERFEMALE:What you doing with that towel, girl? I mean, look, when I get through with Wonder Woman she gonna wonder why she messed with Will Smith in the first place.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God, you're here to beat up a girl? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, no.
LEADMALE:You know, I was just gonna rough her up a little bit.
LEADFEMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you know, that's just a figure of speech, Hil.
LEADMALE:So, what are you gonna do? I'm I'm I'm I ain't gonna do nothing.
LEADMALE:You know how to mess up all the fun, don't you?
LEADFEMALE:Hey, look who's here.
SUPMALE:Hey! What's up? How you doing? You know, I'm sorry about yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mean to pick on you like that.
SUPFEMALE:What you mean, yesterday? Oh! Oh, yesterday.
LEADFEMALE:You mean when you sucker-punched me.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:When I knocked you senseless.
SUPMALE:You know, Helena, you actually said that like you believed it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I did.
SUPMALE:And I'm ready to do it again.

LEADMALE:At first, he wasn't comfortable with it, but I told him, "Tough, get comfortable with it.
LEADMALE:" I stood up to him like a man.
LEADMALE:I told him where to put his gold package.
LEADFEMALE:What'd he say when you told him?

SUPFEMALE:Shoot, girl, l CARLTON: Hey, guys.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna go ahead and change.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, everybody, your dad's on TV.
SUPMALE:The jury's about to announce the verdict.
SUPMALE:Do you think she's innocent or guilty? Oh, please, that woman turned more tricks than David Copperfield.
SUPMALE:She'll probably get off with community service.
OTHERFEMALE:Seems to me, community service is what got her in this mess in the first place.
SUPFEMALE:Serving the community.
SUPMALE:Y'all know what I'm talking about, right?
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Shh, shh, shh.
OTHERFEMALE:Has the jury reached a verdict? Yes, we have, Your Honor.

LEADFEMALE:PHIL: Order.
LEADMALE:Order.
SUPMALE:Mm, mm, mm.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, are there gonna be a lot of Ionely guys this Friday night.
SUPMALE:Miss Bain will be held at the correctional facility until tomorrow when she will be returned here at 9:30 in the morning for sentencing.
OTHERFEMALE:Court is adjourned.
LEADFEMALE:Dad's liable to give her life.
SUPMALE:I got grounded for a whole month just because I came home late.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you deserved it.
SUPMALE:I mean, getting everybody's hopes up like that and then showing up again.
LEADFEMALE:This fax just came in.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:What? What does it say? It says, "I'm gonna kill you, Banks.
LEADFEMALE:"
SUPFEMALE:Yo.
LEADMALE:It's a death threat against Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:HILARY: What?
LEADMALE:What? CARLTON: Dad? Oh, thank God.
OTHERMALE:I thought it was for me.
LEADFEMALE:The fax came right after the verdict was announced.
LEADFEMALE:And they haven't stopped since.
LEADMALE:Oh, half of them wanna hang me, half of them wanna hug me.
SUPMALE:There's a dude here from Appalachia.
OTHERFEMALE:He says he thinks your mouth is kind of pretty.
LEADMALE:Guess I'll put this in the hug pile.
LEADMALE:Whenever there's a high-profile case like this every wacko comes out of the woodwork.
LEADMALE:I say we treat this as a code-one priority.
LEADFEMALE:We need to seal the perimeter.
SUPMALE:I want four cars on 24-hour surveillance sharpshooters on the roof, and a canine team.
SUPFEMALE:And remember, we're working with a nut here.
LEADMALE:And who are you? He's the nut we working with.
SUPFEMALE:Heh-heh-heh.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton Banks.
LEADMALE:I'll be your point man on this little operation.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you what, you let us do our job, and we'll let you do whatever it is you do.
OTHERMALE:And we'll send a extra car by, Mr.
SUPMALE:Banks, just to make sure everything's safe.
LEADMALE:Thank you, officer.
SUPMALE:Come on, guys.
LEADFEMALE:That's it? They're done? They're leaving? Well, I, for one, am not gonna stand here and do nothing while your life hangs in the balance.
SUPFEMALE:Son, my life is not hanging in the balance.
LEADMALE:Now, wait a minute, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:I don't usually say this, but I agree with the little squidget.
LEADMALE:Come on, you can't go down to that courthouse by yourself.
LEADMALE:You need a bodyguard.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, I'm your man.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be fine, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Uh-huh.
LEADFEMALE:That's just what Bobo Anderson said.
LEADFEMALE:Who?
SUPMALE:Bobo Anderson.
LEADFEMALE:One of my boys from back in Philly.
OTHERMALE:Bobo started getting all these threatening letters.
LEADMALE:Everybody was like:  "You need to watch your back.
SUPMALE:Brothers be tripping.
SUPFEMALE:"  He's like, "No, man, I'm cool.
LEADFEMALE:I'm all right.
SUPMALE:" Then, bam!  One day he just up and disappeared.
LEADFEMALE:He was killed? No, his family moved out of town.
SUPFEMALE:I ain't seen him since third grade.
LEADMALE:Will, what has all this got to do with your being my bodyguard? Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I figure if you let me slide down to that courtroom with you, you know I might get to console some of them show-biz madam girls.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, it won't be just your body I'm guarding, you know what I'm saying? You know what I'm talking about, dawg.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying, right? You know.
LEADMALE:You know what I'm saying.
SUPMALE:You know what I'm saying, right? You know.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what I'm saying, boy? You know Damn, I miss Bobo.
LEADMALE:Oh, Carlton, I still think it was a little early to give up on the dating service.
LEADMALE:Will, meet Safety Guy.
LEADMALE:Safety Guy, what's up, bro? What's going on, boy?  Look, this happens to be the latest in home and personal security.
LEADFEMALE:"Designed as a visual deterrent, Safety Guy is a life-size simulated male.
OTHERFEMALE:" Hmm.
LEADMALE:And you're a pint-size simulated male.
SUPMALE:Very funny.
SUPFEMALE:He's gonna protect the Big Guy when we're not around.
LEADFEMALE:You mean to tell me this thing can protect somebody?
OTHERMALE:Oh, absolutely.
SUPFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:Huh.
LEADMALE:He must be on a break, huh? Will, this is no time for tomfoolery.
LEADFEMALE:Now, take your walkie-talkie and infrared goggles.
LEADFEMALE:Damn.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, I can see right through your clothes with these things.
SUPMALE:No wonder you're so shy.
OTHERFEMALE:Ashley's out in the decoy vehicle and this will be command central.
SUPFEMALE:This baby right here will monitor all our activities.
LEADMALE:Your assignment is to be on this
OTHERMALE:Committed the frequency to memory?
OTHERFEMALE:Check.
SUPFEMALE:Now, what do you do if we get caught?
SUPMALE:Laugh.
SUPMALE:Oh, I see we have company.
SUPMALE:Who's your friend?
LEADFEMALE:Hilary, he's a dummy.
LEADMALE:Heh.
OTHERFEMALE:Who needs brains when you got a body like that? Hey, Uncle Phil, we are here to protect you.
LEADMALE:I don't need your protection.
LEADFEMALE:Negatory.
LEADMALE:Until we get you to the courthouse we'll be watching your every move and protecting you at all cost.
LEADMALE:Trust me, we are a well-oiled machine.
LEADFEMALE:Looks like your well-oiled machine just ran out of gas.
SUPFEMALE:Biggest day of my professional career and now I'm gonna be late.
LEADFEMALE:You should've stayed in the car.
LEADMALE:We could've protected you.
OTHERFEMALE:The only person who's gonna need protection now is you, if you don't back off! He's just a little tense about the trial.
SUPFEMALE:Just let him bang down a couple Ding Dongs.
SUPFEMALE:He'll be all right.
LEADFEMALE:Will get a load of the clown in the corner.
SUPFEMALE:We'd better check him out.
LEADMALE:Carlton, come on, he's a clown.
SUPMALE:He's probably going to some kid's birthday party or something.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll see about that.
SUPMALE:Okay, pal, state your business.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? Never mind who I am.
LEADFEMALE:And wipe that smile off your face and tell me your name.
LEADFEMALE:Juggles.
LEADMALE:Well, look, Juggles, get what you're after and get out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? Carlton Banks.
LEADMALE:And that's my father, Judge Banks.
LEADFEMALE:I'm the head of his security team and my job is to check out suspicious people like you.
OTHERFEMALE:So come on, let's go.
LEADMALE:Move it along.
LEADFEMALE:Judge Banks from the Show-Biz Madam Trial? Pretty impressed, huh? More than you can imagine.
LEADFEMALE:All right! Nobody moves and nobody gets blown up!  
LEADFEMALE:Excuse
LEADMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Juggles? Hey, hey, hey.
SUPMALE:It's not Mr.
LEADMALE:Juggles, it's Juggles.
SUPMALE:All right, Will, I got a plan.
SUPFEMALE:You create a diversion while Dad and I slip out the back.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, yo.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, man, where does that leave me? You are so selfish.
OTHERFEMALE:What do you hope to accomplish by strapping a bomb to your chest and blowing up a gas station?  I'm on my way down to one of the networks and I'm gonna make them put me on TV.
LEADFEMALE:And then the whole world is gonna see my talent to entertain.
LEADFEMALE:Um Wouldn't it be easier to just get a agent? I had an agent and then he had my wife.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:That's a joke!  There's gotta be a better way.
LEADMALE:Yeah, well, I tried all the other ways, but it's always Bozo this or Coco that.
LEADMALE:Never any jobs for Juggles, oh, no.
SUPMALE:And I'll tell you another thing I could've sold twice as many hamburgers as that Ronald guy.
LEADMALE:That no-act clown.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
OTHERFEMALE:Nobody wants to give Juggles a chance.
SUPFEMALE:Mm-mm.
LEADMALE:One little tent fire.
LEADMALE:One little elephant stampede.
SUPMALE:A couple of kids end up in the hospital and, all of a sudden, Juggles is poison.
OTHERMALE:As if they even saw me smoking that cigar.
SUPFEMALE:It's harassment, I tell you! Well, you're probably in a hurry to get down to that network, you know.
LEADMALE:So don't let us stop you.
LEADFEMALE:Grab your little seltzer bottle, hop in your little miniature car.
OTHERFEMALE:If you go right now, you could beat rush hour.
LEADMALE:No! No, no, no.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Now that I got myself a big celebrity judge hostage I'm gonna make the network people come here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be a bigger celebrity than I even thought.
OTHERMALE:Now, I've heard enough.
OTHERMALE:This plan's never gonna work.
LEADMALE:Listen, clown, there are not gonna be any news stations down here.
OTHERFEMALE:Every station in the world is gonna be at the courthouse waiting for my Dad.
LEADMALE:Carlton
LEADMALE:It's gonna be a media circus there.
LEADMALE:If you think any news camera people are coming here
OTHERMALE:Carlton
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:He should hear this.
SUPMALE:I mean, even the tabloids are gonna be down at the courthouse.
SUPFEMALE:You know, he's right.
LEADFEMALE:This won't work.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you guys are going down to the courthouse.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:But I'm coming with you.
LEADFEMALE:Aah! Juggles, no! What are we, Driving Miss Daisy? Come on, speed it up a little.
LEADMALE:I have a date with destiny.
LEADFEMALE:I'm trying to obey the law, unlike someone else in this car.
SUPMALE:Pedal to the metal, Tattoo.
OTHERFEMALE:And if I don't, I suppose you'll throw me out the window just like you did Safety Guy.
LEADMALE:Oh, the sight of that perfectly chiseled foam body being mutilated by that 18-wheeler.
SUPFEMALE:You bastard.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, look, you know what? I have had about enough of this.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you just give it up, man? You're going to jail anyway.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
SUPFEMALE:But who am I to be dissing jail, you know? I hear there's a lot of fascinating criminals in there.
SUPMALE:Look, Jugs Can I call you Jugs? You are going about this all the wrong way, man.
SUPFEMALE:Dude, let me tell you.
SUPMALE:It is gonna be plenty of honeys down at that courthouse.
LEADMALE:And you know how the ladies feel about clowns, huh? Huh? Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You look like you might've had a little freaky rendezvous with the bearded lady or something down there, huh? Yeah.
SUPMALE:So listen, if we go up in there holding hands, man we gonna be sending the wrong message.
LEADFEMALE:So why don't you pop these cuffs off and throw that bomb out the window? Let's go to that jail and get our party on, you know what I'm saying?  You know, you got a bit of the clown in you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah?
LEADMALE:You might even have your own act.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:But I work alone! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:This is it.
SUPFEMALE:How do I look? Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:Key? Key? Key? Oh, where is it? Where's? Oh, here it is.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my God.
OTHERMALE:Look, my hands are shaking.
SUPMALE:I'm never gonna be able to do this.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPMALE:Hey, no, no.
LEADMALE:Relax, man.
LEADMALE:Listen, you can do it.
SUPFEMALE:Will, if he doesn't think he can do it, let's not make him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he dragged us all the way down here.
LEADFEMALE:He's doing it.
OTHERFEMALE:MAN: Court is in session.
LEADMALE:The Honorable Judge Banks Stop, stop, stop.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit, sit, sit.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Somebody dim the lights.
LEADMALE:It's my damn courtroom, dim the lights.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages presenting the hardest-working clown in show business.
SUPFEMALE:I give you Juggles.
OTHERFEMALE:Where's the music?   Thank you, Judge Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Ow!  Your Honor, what is going on in here? This is ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:That's the general idea.
LEADMALE:Ha.
LEADMALE:Clean him up.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, bro.
LEADMALE:WOMAN : It's not exactly clear what's happening in the courtroom but it appears Judge Banks has lost control.
SUPFEMALE:This is better than Benny Hill.
SUPFEMALE:This wouldn't be the first time that a judge has succumbed to the stress of a trial.
LEADFEMALE:We all remember when Judge Lance Peterson cracked and rendered a verdict with the aide of a sock puppet named Randy.
LEADMALE:Uh, uh, uh.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
OTHERFEMALE:Gee, Juggles, I could really use a hanky.
LEADFEMALE:Well, my able assistant, let me see what I have here.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey.
LEADMALE:You never know when it's gonna end.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:That's the end.
LEADMALE:Move on to the next trick.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! And now for the magic pan trick.
OTHERFEMALE:Remove the lid.
OTHERFEMALE:Um We should move on to the next trick.
LEADFEMALE:I said, remove the lid.
LEADFEMALE:Ernie!  They're not laughing.
LEADFEMALE:They're all against me.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, now, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Juggles.
LEADMALE:Juggles.
LEADFEMALE:Now listen, these people are not all against you.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, come here.
LEADMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:Listen let me say something to you as a friend.
SUPMALE:You suck.
LEADMALE:All right? The reason you can't get work It's not because people don't like you, man you know, it's not because people don't wanna give you a chance.
LEADMALE:It's because you suck.
LEADFEMALE:You know? You're not funny.
LEADFEMALE:You suck.
LEADFEMALE:Will, are you crazy? Juggles, he doesn't know what he's saying.
OTHERFEMALE:You're very funny.
SUPFEMALE:This crowd is just dead.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, Ernie is dead.
LEADMALE:All right, so you didn't like that one.
OTHERMALE:Well, maybe you'll like the grand finale.
LEADFEMALE:Juggles.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait, wait, Juggles MAN: He's got a bomb!    Ta-da.
SUPMALE:Ta-da? Wait.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, that's your big finale? Will was right.
LEADFEMALE:You do suck.
LEADMALE:Bailiff, get him out of here.
LEADFEMALE:Get him out of here.
LEADMALE:Whoa, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I do this thing with dolls.
LEADFEMALE:Sentencing for Tanya Bain, the show-biz madam was postponed until tomorrow after a dangerously insane man in a clown costume held the entire proceedings hostage.
SUPMALE:Oh, please.
LEADFEMALE:That ain't even right.
SUPMALE:I mean, he ain't insane.
LEADMALE:You know, he's just a clown that likes to make people laugh and, I don't know, take some pictures or something Will, that's evidence.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Well, who says it can't be fun to play with evidence? Come on, Uncle Phil, a couple pictures.
LEADFEMALE:Smile.
LEADMALE:This is evidence.
LEADMALE:We shouldn't be playing with this stuff.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, look, everyone.
LEADMALE:Look who I found.
LEADMALE:Hey.
SUPMALE:Hey, it's the dummy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, and he found Safety Guy.
SUPFEMALE:Can you believe no one stole him? Listen, everyone, we were lucky this time but if we've learned anything from this crisis, is that in the face of danger You scream like a girl? No.
SUPMALE:Is that preparation is everything.
LEADFEMALE:Mom, you're the upstairs lookout.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley, man the decoy vehicle.
LEADFEMALE:Will, secure the perimeter.
SUPMALE:You all want something to eat? Hilary, upstairs on the roof.
OTHERFEMALE:Geoffrey, in the kitchen.

LEADMALE:He reminds me of my rabbit, Snowball.
SUPMALE:What? You had a rabbit? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never forget how upset I was the day Snowball disappeared.
LEADFEMALE:But I was okay once Dad explained Snowball's mommy and daddy had to take her back to their hutch because they were so Ionely without her.
LEADFEMALE:I remember.
LEADMALE:That was the Easter Grandma Hattie came over and made that secret stew.
SUPMALE:What was that? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't remember.
SUPMALE:Of course, you do.
SUPMALE:It tasted like chicken but it wasn't.
LEADFEMALE:Hilary.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADMALE:I remember that stew.
LEADMALE:It was delicious.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, you gotta make that stew.
SUPMALE:Don't tempt me.
OTHERMALE: Tell old pharaoh Let my people go  Tell old pharaoh Let my cousin grow Carlton, give it up.

LEADMALE:I'd have to live there, of course.
SUPFEMALE:Of course you would, muffin.
SUPMALE:Of course, it's always been my dream to send my underage daughter off to New York unsupervised.

SUPFEMALE:Do you think he meant it? Ashley, how many times do I have to tell you? Yes.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:Really, Will, do you think he will? Ashley, the man is in show business, he wouldn't lie.

SUPFEMALE:Now, look, just watch some TV and take your mind off of it, all right? MALE VOICE : Hello.
OTHERMALE:I'm Mister Ed.
LEADMALE:You bastard! Wow, Carlton seems pretty upset.
SUPMALE:I think what he needs is a refreshing pick-me-up beverage that's not too sweet and not too heavy.
LEADFEMALE:What? You know my motto.
LEADFEMALE:If you're a woman on the go like me, things can get rough.
SUPMALE:And when they do, don't sweat, drink Jet.
LEADMALE:Jet cola that is.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
OTHERMALE:You been sipping that gin and juice.
LEADFEMALE:VIVIAN: Hi, guys.
LEADMALE:Oh, Ashley, look.
SUPMALE:Now eat these mints and whatever you do, don't talk.
SUPFEMALE:Here.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't need a mint.
LEADMALE:Mom, I went to see Mr.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's great! Let's go tell your dad.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:This don't seem that hard.
LEADFEMALE:You know my motto.
SUPMALE:If you're a woman on the go like me, things can get rough.
LEADFEMALE:And when they do, don't sweat, y'all.
LEADMALE:Drink Jet.
OTHERFEMALE:Jet cola that is.
LEADMALE:Well, then, be a woman on the go.
LEADMALE:Leave so I can vacuum.
LEADMALE:Hey, Frank, what's up, man?
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:How's it going? All right.
LEADMALE:I'm just coming down, check on Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:She's a little nervous before her first shoot.
SUPMALE:She's gonna be just fine.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, girls.
LEADMALE:Places, please.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPFEMALE:WILL: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:You mean, you just say it and they do it? Okay, girls get naked.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Simon says, get naked.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, people.
LEADFEMALE:First positions, please.
OTHERFEMALE:We're losing the light.
LEADFEMALE:Let's get this rolling.
LEADMALE:Hey, Frank.
SUPMALE:I got to tell you, man, it's guys like you make life worth living.
SUPFEMALE:Bringing all these beautiful women to us during all our favorite programs.
SUPFEMALE:Mm.
LEADFEMALE:Man, you ought to have a billboard with your face on it.
LEADFEMALE:You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Will.
LEADMALE:Will.
OTHERFEMALE:That's a wrap!
OTHERMALE:I am so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:There is no way I'm gonna let her parade around on some beach hawking Jet cola in nothing but a skimpy bikini.
OTHERFEMALE:And showing that can all over national TV.
LEADMALE:And I ain't talking about the soda.
LEADFEMALE:HILARY: Carlton, this is crazy.
LEADMALE:Hilary, we had no choice.
LEADMALE:We needed a place till we find him a permanent home.
LEADFEMALE:What's gonna happen if Dad finds out there's a horse in the back yard? He'll blame Will like he always does.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you "hi, Daddy" me.
LEADFEMALE:Just when were you planning on telling me about your little soft-core drink commercial? You.
LEADMALE:We would've found out eventually.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, even though they're not showing that much of her face.
OTHERMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:You're both being hypocrites.
SUPFEMALE:You sit there glued to the set anytime Baywatch comes on.
LEADMALE:That's only because I have trouble sleeping and the sound of the waves gently caressing the shore helps relax me.
LEADMALE:Nice cover.
LEADFEMALE:Nice cov Ashley, you're not doing this commercial.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, can you talk to him? I'm afraid your father feels very strongly about this.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't quit the commercial.
OTHERMALE:How's it look if I walk out on the person who's gonna give me the recommendation? I don't care.
SUPFEMALE:This is more important.
LEADMALE:And you're not going to New York, either.
OTHERMALE:What about what I want? Doesn't that matter? No.
SUPMALE:No, no, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:I am telling you, Uncle Phil, I was there and that commercial was nothing but a disgusting, gratuitous display of Just call it what it is.
OTHERFEMALE:Smut.
SUPFEMALE:You don't think I was too rough on Ashley?
LEADMALE:Are you tripping? You are the leader of the pack.
SUPFEMALE:It is your right.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:Scratch that.
SUPFEMALE:It is your duty as a male to assert your dominance.
LEADMALE:There, I said it, your dominance.
OTHERFEMALE:Really? Because your Aunt Vivian wasn't as supportive of my approach.
LEADMALE:Your approach? Man, I got one thing to say about your approach: Woof, woof, woof.
SUPMALE:You are the king of the jungle, Mufasa.
LEADMALE:Yes, I am.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am.
SUPMALE:You are the ruler of all that you survey.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:You will be obeyed!
LEADFEMALE:I will be obeyed!
LEADMALE:That's right.
OTHERMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Hi, sweetie, you look awfully pretty.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I guess I showed her.
SUPFEMALE:You ain't nothing but Simba.
OTHERFEMALE: What's up, Ash?   What you watching? You know, I have no idea what got into the big guy! You got into him.
LEADFEMALE:You're the rat that dimed me out.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute, Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Now that hurts.
SUPFEMALE:I'm offended by that characterization.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:You don't like rat.
SUPFEMALE:How about snake? Weasel? Doody-head? Don't be calling me no doody-head.
LEADFEMALE:You know how much going to the School of Performing Arts means to me and how much that commercial would help.
LEADMALE:That commercial was degrading.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, really? It was? Which part? The part where I'm in clothes driving the car? The part where I'm in sweats drinking the cola? The part where I'm Rollerblading? No.
OTHERFEMALE:All you focused on were the seven seconds I was in a bathing suit playing volleyball.
LEADFEMALE:I play volleyball in a bathing suit all the time.
LEADMALE:Am I degrading myself? I didn't know about all them other parts.
LEADFEMALE:Exactly.
OTHERMALE:Because you didn't ask.
SUPMALE:All that mattered to you and Dad was your narrow-minded maleness.
LEADMALE:You know, this job may not be my dream job but, regardless, it's my dream.
SUPMALE:You and Dad have nothing to do with it.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what? I should just go and do it anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, whoa, whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:Now Now, I realize you're excited and you're a little upset but Uncle Phil is a big man.
LEADMALE:He's a very big man with a very short fuse.
LEADMALE:Bad combination.
LEADFEMALE:Very bad combination.
SUPMALE:Goodbye.
SUPFEMALE:Bad talk.
LEADFEMALE:Very bad talk.
LEADMALE:Here you go.
SUPMALE:Nick, have I ever kept you from achieving your dreams? Not many.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you wouldn't call me narrow-minded, would you? You just don't get it, do you? I'm 5, you dork.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you're right.
SUPFEMALE:I should just be talking to Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Is she here? Nope.
LEADMALE:She's at the commercial.
SUPFEMALE:What?
LEADFEMALE:What? Whoa! Ha-ha-ha! Hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Uncle Phil, man.
LEADMALE:How long you been standing there? You know, you're a light stepper for a big fella.
LEADMALE:What did you just say, Nicky? Ashley's at the commercial.
LEADMALE:Oh, how could she do this, huh? In direct defiance of The king of the jungle? We'll see about this.
SUPMALE:What? Now, Uncle Phil, calm down, man.
LEADFEMALE:All right? It ain't that serious.
LEADMALE:Big man, short fuse.
LEADFEMALE:Bad combination.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, she's not here, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:We just got here.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, Uncle Phil, as I look around you know, the level of nakedness isn't as high as I had previously assumed.
LEADFEMALE:Will, you know, ever since we've left the house you seemed a little distracted.
LEADFEMALE:You know, what ever happened to that: Woof, woof, woof.
LEADMALE:Oh, heh.
LEADMALE:Well, that's still there, man.
LEADFEMALE:Woof, woof, woof.
LEADMALE:You know, Uncle Phil, I don't even think that Ashley's here! PHIL: Ashley.
LEADMALE:Daddy, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? What are you doing here? You defied me.
OTHERMALE:Now, you go get your clothes and you come with me right now.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, l
LEADFEMALE:I don't wanna hear it.
LEADFEMALE:Coming down here and doing this commercial after I expressly forbade it.
LEADFEMALE:I just quit the commercial.
SUPFEMALE:Well Uh You should be ashamed of yourself.
OTHERMALE:Not trusting Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:I knew she would never do it.
OTHERMALE:Mama knows, child.
LEADFEMALE:Come here.
SUPMALE:Shut up, Will.
OTHERMALE:Listen, I'm taking over.
SUPFEMALE:I need to know where your wardrobe is.
OTHERFEMALE:Um, it's in the dressing room in the back.
SUPMALE:Too bad your daddy won't let you do the commercial.
LEADMALE:Better off leaving it to the big girls.
LEADMALE:Whoo-hoo-hoo.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo-hoo.
LEADMALE:Little cat in you, huh, girl? Little leopard skirt on.
SUPMALE:You know, let's just go.
SUPFEMALE:Yep.
OTHERMALE:You better make it home before Saved by the Bell starts.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me, miss.
LEADMALE:No one talks to my daughter that way.
SUPMALE:So maybe you and your little horsehair weave should just mosey on before I get really upset.
LEADFEMALE:Better some horsehair than some no hair.
SUPFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:I don't think so.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Ashley.
OTHERMALE:It ain't worth it.
SUPFEMALE:It ain't worth it.
SUPMALE:Sweetheart, you go to your dressing room and put on your costume.
SUPFEMALE:Because I think Frank's gonna need some class to sell his drink.
LEADMALE:Daddy, you're gonna let me do the commercial?
SUPFEMALE:It's up to you if you want to.
LEADMALE:Oh, Daddy, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:And, by the way, your mother.
LEADFEMALE:Mama.
LEADMALE:It's "mama," Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Mama.
LEADFEMALE:It's "your mama.
LEADFEMALE:" Hey, Ashley, I gotta tell you.
LEADFEMALE:I think this commercial thing is gonna be all right.
SUPMALE:You know, all them new friends you made today.
LEADFEMALE:How you got all their telephone numbers.
LEADFEMALE:That was cool.
SUPFEMALE:I'll give you $20 apiece for each of them.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, except for that cat girl.
LEADFEMALE:She had a beard.
LEADMALE:Daddy, did you hear? Frank said I'm a shoo-in for the School of Performing Arts.
SUPMALE:I'm as good as in New York.
LEADFEMALE:I've said it before and I'll say it again.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:What happened to you being more open-minded? I am open-minded, sweetheart.
SUPMALE:And any commercial you wanna shoot here in the greater Los Angeles area hey, I'm on board.
LEADMALE:Will, what do you think? Hey, I have nothing but love and respect for the both of you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mom.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
LEADMALE:Can you convince Dad it's all right for me to move to New York? Tell her she is too young to move anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:I moved out of the horse when I was 17.
SUPMALE:Horse? House.
LEADMALE:Um I gotta go do this thing with Uh Bye.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Wait.
SUPFEMALE:Mom, I gotta talk to you.

SUPMALE:And we saved him.
LEADMALE:We needed to find a farm.
OTHERFEMALE:We found one but
LEADFEMALE:He doesn't wanna go.
LEADFEMALE:And it's hard to move this kind of girth.
SUPMALE:You can relate to that, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:We can explain.
SUPMALE:We can explain.
OTHERMALE:He did it.
LEADFEMALE:He did it.
SUPMALE:What? Hey.
SUPMALE:
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Will.
OTHERMALE:What's up? How come you're not dressed for the golf tournament? I'm not playing this year.
LEADFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Y'all play every year.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and every year we lose.
OTHERMALE:Frankly, I'm sick of being a big loser.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, C, you're not big.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I made other plans.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm attending a seminar on how to buy foreclosed properties.
OTHERFEMALE:You wouldn't believe the money to be made kicking people out of their own homes.
LEADFEMALE:Such a big heart for such a little man.
LEADMALE:Boy, I can't wait to hit those links.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:How about you, partner? Bad news, big guy.
LEADFEMALE:I made other plans.
LEADFEMALE:Other plans? Carlton, this is a Banks' tradition.
SUPFEMALE:With you going off to Princeton in the fall this is one of the last chances we're gonna have to play golf and spend some quality time together.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, big guy.

LEADFEMALE:Please, all you men think about is win, win, win.
LEADMALE:Well, that's not exactly all we think about, if you know what I'm talking about.
LEADFEMALE:Ha.
LEADFEMALE:You know what I'm saying, C? Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:Ashley's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Take us for example.
OTHERMALE:We enter the club tennis tournament every year just for the fun of it.
SUPMALE:Just because we win, doesn't make it any more fun.
SUPFEMALE:Exactly.
SUPMALE:Of course, we don't have losing to compare it to.
LEADFEMALE:You go, girl.
SUPMALE:Well, Will, if we're gonna be partners, we'd better get in some practice, huh?
OTHERMALE:Let's go to the club and hit a few balls.
LEADMALE:Right behind you.
OTHERMALE:Will, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, just out of curiosity, what is the other thing men think about?   Oh, goody.
OTHERFEMALE:I thought I was going to run out of things to do today.
LEADMALE:Good God, Geoffrey, this place is a mess.
SUPMALE:Miss Hilary, it's comments like that, that makes this job worthwhile.
SUPFEMALE:Geoffrey, Regis Philbin is going to be here any minute.

LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Boy, you are so funny, Reg.
SUPMALE:No, I'm serious.
OTHERMALE:Don't ever call me Reg.
SUPMALE:Well, if it isn't Martina and Steffi.
SUPMALE:How'd the first round of your tournament go? Great.
LEADFEMALE:We won.
LEADMALE:But then again, we always do.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Black number five, coming up.
LEADFEMALE: "Black number five coming up.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
OTHERFEMALE:" Hey, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Dude, I was just at the range.
SUPMALE:Man, I was El Kabong-ing that joint a mile.
LEADMALE:And I'm gonna pretend I ain't see that little dance you was just doing.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Will.
SUPFEMALE:I have to go to the pro shop and pick up a sand wedge.
OTHERMALE:What? A sandwich? Uncle Phil, we just had breakfast a half hour ago.
LEADFEMALE:Will, I said "sand wedge.
LEADMALE:" It's a club.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADFEMALE:Turkey, bacon, three layers of white toast.
OTHERFEMALE:Banks.
LEADFEMALE:Mercer.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, your son really shot up this year.
LEADFEMALE:This is my nephew.
LEADMALE:Will, this is Bob Mercer.
OTHERFEMALE:How you doing?
LEADMALE:And his son, Bobby.
LEADFEMALE:What's up, man? They've been club champions for three years.
OTHERFEMALE:Four.
LEADFEMALE:Soon to be five.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I wouldn't be so sure.
SUPMALE:I just bought a new set of clubs.
SUPFEMALE:Now you need somebody to swing them for you and you could have a shot.
LEADMALE:Oh! Hey, Mercer, you should save that dazzling wit for the courtroom.
SUPFEMALE:You might even win a case.
LEADFEMALE:So our makeup room is around the corner, the control booth is upstairs and this is our set.
LEADFEMALE:Can I get you in your positions? We wanna get a light reading.
SUPFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
OTHERMALE:Oof.
LEADMALE:I hate to be a stickler, but that's my chair.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, would you mind if I sat here? You see, my right side has been rated my better side.
LEADFEMALE:So it'd be in my best interest to be sitting on this side.
SUPFEMALE:It would be in my best interest if I could sit in the same chair I've been sitting in for the last 15 years.
LEADMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:Big baby.
SUPMALE:Well, now, we usually start off the show by announcing our guests and then we have a little banter, go to a commercial bring out the first guest.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's a good way.
LEADFEMALE:But what if we do it the way we do it on my show? Which is we bring out the guest first and then we do that little banter thing later.
LEADMALE:Again, we've been using this format for many, many years and it seems to work, you know? You know the old saying, "If it ain't broke" I'm drawing a blank here.
OTHERMALE:Don't fix it.
LEADMALE:Fix what? It.
LEADMALE:If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
LEADFEMALE:What's it? What are you talking about? You know, maybe we'd better skip the banter altogether, you know? Big baby.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, man.
SUPFEMALE:That pro shot on 18 was something else.
LEADFEMALE:Hold up, I don't care what you say, I ain't never seen a shot like you hit on 16.
OTHERMALE:Sounds like you guys won.
LEADFEMALE:Hell, no, how could we? He's an even worse golfer than you.
LEADMALE:So why are you so happy? Oh, we had a great time.
LEADMALE:You had a great time losing?
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I gotta tell you.
SUPFEMALE:We ain't spent quality time like that together in years.
LEADFEMALE:Well, wait till tomorrow when we really get our butts kicked.
SUPMALE:How about we throw a couple steaks on the grill and discuss our losing strategy for tomorrow? Great idea.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go start the barbie.
OTHERFEMALE:Dad, you know, there's a chance I may be free to play tomorrow.
SUPMALE:I wouldn't want you to miss your foreclosure seminar.
SUPMALE:I really won't be missing that much.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, once the police come and toss the family out, it's mostly paperwork.
LEADMALE:Well, Carlton, Will and I will be just fine.
LEADMALE:Let me tell you, this dude right here is just straight loqued-out on a golf course, man.
LEADMALE:You are the one who managed to get the golf cart up on two wheels, with me in it.
LEADMALE:That's no easy trick.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you gotta show me how you managed to miss those 1-foot putts.
SUPFEMALE:All you gotta do is not concentrate.
LEADFEMALE:
OTHERMALE:I ain't tripping.
SUPMALE:You crack me up.
LEADFEMALE:I can not concentrate.
LEADFEMALE:You ever done something because you thought it was right but then felt really stupid about what you did? Yes, but I'm still working here.
OTHERFEMALE:I was talking about the golf tournament.
LEADFEMALE:I made other plans because I didn't wanna play but then I saw Will and Dad having so much fun And now you're jealous.
SUPFEMALE:Now Will and Dad are buddies and I feel like an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you shouldn't.
SUPFEMALE:Not because of that anyway.
LEADMALE:Look everyone makes mistakes.
LEADMALE:The point is to learn from them.
SUPFEMALE:And most important, not to try to solve your problems with hasty immature actions.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, man, look what happened to my golf clubs.
LEADFEMALE:Bet it was that dirty boy Bobby Mercer.
OTHERMALE:You know, it's always the quiet ones.
OTHERMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:Will.
LEADMALE:Are you ready to go?
LEADFEMALE:What happened?
SUPFEMALE:Hey, man, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I guess there's only one solution.
LEADMALE:I'll get my clubs.
OTHERFEMALE:Great.
SUPMALE:You can play with Carlton's clubs.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, Carl? What, I'm supposed to play on my knees? I guess you're stuck then.
LEADMALE:Never fear, Carlton Banks is here.
LEADMALE:I'll change my plans and take Will's place.
SUPMALE:I don't want you to miss your seminar.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, I don't mind.
LEADFEMALE:No, I have a better idea.
SUPMALE:I'll just buy you a new set.
LEADMALE:You're gonna need them because we're gonna be playing a lot of golf together.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? I guess I can play just as bad with the news ones as I did with the old ones.
LEADMALE:Maybe worse.
SUPFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPMALE:Shoot, with my swing, I might as well play with these.
SUPMALE:
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, would you mind?
LEADMALE:Oh, I suppose not, Master Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Regis, I know we've already covered this ground but I'd really like to sit on that side.
SUPMALE:Hilary, Hilary.
LEADFEMALE:Relax, you look great.
SUPMALE:The show is gonna be great regardless of where we sit.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's just do the show and forget about it.

SUPMALE:Your outfit was too loud.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies, ladies, whatever happened to teamwork?
LEADMALE:Ashley, you're my daughter and I love you.
LEADMALE:That's better.
LEADFEMALE:But if you double fault one more time, I am going to put you up for adoption.
LEADMALE:Great, maybe then I'll wind up with a mother who can hit a decent backhand.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
LEADMALE:Well, let me say it louder then.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna grab us some water, you go grab the cart.

SUPFEMALE:Now, put that away.
LEADMALE:Carlton, you still owe me for those Milk Duds.
OTHERMALE:WILL: Carlton, what you doing here? I thought if you didn't wanna play, I'd fill in for you.

SUPMALE:No, no, sure you can.
LEADMALE:Come on, now help me put your clubs in the car.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Carlton, no.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I made a big mistake not playing in this tournament.
OTHERMALE:You said you didn't even wanna play.
LEADFEMALE:I know, but I see you guys having fun and I realize Dad was right.
LEADMALE:With me going to Princeton we won't have plenty of chances left to spend quality time together.
LEADFEMALE:The time on the course wasn't about winning or losing it was about me being with my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Um Guess I ain't think about it like that.
SUPMALE:So you gonna let me play? No, but we need a couple sodas, why don't you bring them out?

SUPFEMALE:Will.
LEADFEMALE:Will, how can you pull a hamstring playing golf? I mean Ow! My shoulder string.
LEADFEMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPFEMALE:An injury to a player could mean a forfeit.
LEADMALE:Oh, it hurts real bad, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:Well, that's okay, son.
OTHERMALE:Maybe next year.
LEADFEMALE:Ow.
OTHERMALE:But wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, Carlton, come here.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe you could bail me out.
OTHERMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:What do you think, Dad? What do I think? Grab your club, son.
LEADMALE:If you help me win this thing you'll never have to work another day in your life.
LEADFEMALE:But you have fun.
LEADFEMALE: If I make this putt, we win.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, whether we make this putt or not, it's been a great afternoon.
LEADMALE:How about if I just blow it?
LEADFEMALE:No, I think you should try to make it.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, yeah, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:But it doesn't matter, right?
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, will you just putt?
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:WILL: You got it, boy.

LEADFEMALE: Oh, man, that was great.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, I gotta give you props.
LEADFEMALE:You dropped that putt from deep.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Will.
SUPMALE:How about I come back every year from Princeton to play in the golf tournament?
SUPMALE:Oh, I'd love it.
SUPFEMALE:How about I come back from wherever I'm at? Why? No reason.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, I'm gonna go put this in the pool house.

OTHERFEMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:So, Will, how is that shoulder-string thing? Ooh, ah.
LEADMALE:Man, yeah.

LEADFEMALE:What? Wh Why, that's my old trumpet.
SUPMALE:I haven't seen that thing in ages.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Oh, man, I didn't know you played the trumpet.
LEADFEMALE:When I was in college a little bit, you know.
LEADMALE:The girls all like a musician, you know?   I met him after Princeton.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, look at all this stuff.
SUPFEMALE:My old coloring books.
LEADFEMALE:My diary.

LEADMALE:Who had a Barbie? Well, it's not mine.
LEADFEMALE:My Barbie's at home fast asleep in her Barbie Dream House.
SUPFEMALE:Um It doesn't matter whose it is.
LEADMALE:Let me see this trumpet.
SUPFEMALE:
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
LEADMALE:Morning, everybody.
LEADMALE:Morning, Will.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Y'all remember, don't nobody mention to Carlton that William Shatner's gonna be on Hilary's show.
LEADMALE:Don't you think you're being unfair? He's coming on the show and you know Carlton is a huge fan of his.
OTHERMALE:Who's gonna be on Hilary's show, and who am I a huge fan of? Uh Uh Uh Billy.
LEADMALE:Billy who? Uh Uh Uh Uh Billy Butterworth.
LEADMALE:You are never going to believe what's happened.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Billy Butterworth's gonna be on your show.
OTHERMALE:Big deal.
OTHERMALE:What are you talking about? William Shatner's on the show.
LEADFEMALE:Actor, director, novelist, bon vivant William Shatner? And you knew? You slept in the same pool house with me knowing this knowing what it would mean to me, and you didn't say a word? I don't even know who you are.
LEADMALE:Look, Carlton, it ain't like I'm Hello? I wasn't finished.
LEADMALE:Hilary, you gotta introduce him to me.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:The network is so thrilled with all of our great guests that they wanna move the show to New York.
SUPFEMALE:New York?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:There was a meeting with the VIPs and they think we're ready for the big time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, wait.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, Hilary.
LEADMALE:I can't just uproot just like that.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:What do you mean "okay?"
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be out of a job.
LEADMALE:So come.
SUPMALE:Hilary, I can't come.
LEADFEMALE:I still gotta finish school.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:What? Look, Hilary, how come I didn't find out about this before? Oh, don't tell me someone withheld information from somebody.
LEADFEMALE:So just like that, you're moving to New York and I'm out of a job.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:What about New York? They're moving Hilary's show to New York.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my God, that's wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:This is the best news I've ever heard.
SUPMALE:It's unbelievable.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, you've never been this happy for me.
OTHERFEMALE:I still haven't been.
LEADMALE:This is about me.
LEADFEMALE:I can still move to New York.
LEADMALE:Now, just hold on, young lady.
SUPMALE:You said I couldn't move to New York and go to The School of Performing Arts because I couldn't move there by myself.
OTHERMALE:But now that Hilary's going
SUPFEMALE:Oh, we'll be roommates.
LEADMALE:Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley, calm down.
LEADMALE:There's more than that one reason for your not moving to New York.
SUPMALE:Like what?
SUPMALE:Uh l I think you know.
SUPMALE:No, I don't.
LEADMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:Up in Dad's office, there's a Sunday New York Times.
SUPFEMALE:We can find an apartment from there.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, hey, hey.
OTHERFEMALE:Stay out of my office.
SUPMALE:You can jump in here any time, Vivian.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps that iron fist that you rule with has gotten a bit rusty, sir.
LEADMALE:Perhaps I should hit something.
OTHERFEMALE:Be careful of misguided anger, sir.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go down and have Shatner sign my copy of his new book, Man o' War.
LEADFEMALE:What to wear? What to wear? What to wear? Hil, I gotta let you know, I'm more than a little upset about how you played me with this whole New York thing.
LEADFEMALE:This is a wound that will not quickly heal.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Hilary.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Dick West.
LEADMALE:I'm with the network.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.

LEADFEMALE:Thanks, guy.

SUPMALE:I've taken the liberty of re-drafting your will.
LEADMALE:Now, if you'll sign right here and initial this little box in the event you lapse into a coma, that'll give us the right to pull the plug.

SUPMALE:Master Carlton, we'll write.
SUPFEMALE:But that won't get my dry cleaning picked up.
LEADFEMALE:Chop-chop, Geoffrey.
LEADMALE:And to think I fished that boy out of the pool.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.

LEADFEMALE:This is gonna be so much fun, living together.
SUPMALE:I know, I can't wait.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Ahem.
SUPFEMALE:Eggshell in the kitchen and taupe in the living room.
OTHERMALE:I don't think so.
SUPMALE:We agreed I could pick out the colors.
SUPFEMALE:We agreed that you would have input.
SUPFEMALE:That's right, and I'm inputting these colors into our apartment.
LEADMALE:My apartment.
OTHERMALE:And I just changed my mind, you'll have no input whatsoever.
SUPFEMALE:This is gonna be so much fun, us living together.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna miss this time we've spend together.
LEADMALE:Me working hard, focusing on my career and you sitting around in the house all day in your robe playing Nintendo.
LEADFEMALE:You always make me feel so, so superior.
LEADMALE:Like the story of the grasshopper and the ant.
LEADMALE:The ant worked all summer long storing up food while the grasshopper frittered away his time.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the winter has come and you've just been frittering.
LEADFEMALE:Frittering.
LEADMALE:Frittering.
OTHERFEMALE:Frittering.
LEADMALE:See, now, that's where you're wrong.
LEADMALE:See, the grasshopper hasn't been frittering.
LEADFEMALE:Unlike the ant, the grasshopper had a life and friends.
LEADFEMALE:And once in a while, a couple of little ladybugs would come over to spend some time with the grasshopper.
LEADMALE:And on one weekend You know the ladybug from the bookstore, the one the ant has the crush on? She even came over to spend some time with that fine grasshopper.
OTHERFEMALE:The weekend he was away at Princeton.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what was she doing here? Frittering.
LEADMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:She fritters so good.
SUPMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADFEMALE:That's funny.
SUPFEMALE:You're the funniest guy in the pool house.
LEADMALE:And soon enough, you're gonna be the only guy in the pool house.
LEADMALE:With the rest of us striking out on our own the only question is, who's gonna move out first, you or Nicky? Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Better hope he doesn't go to boarding school.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, G.
LEADMALE:What's up, man? Hey, look, I got this friend, right? He kind of got a little problem.
SUPFEMALE:See, he got these three cousins and they're all moving on with new and exciting lives and everything.
LEADMALE:Is your friend feeling pensive? My friend doesn't know what pensive means.
SUPFEMALE:Is your friend feeling lost? Ah! Lost.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:See, he's feeling lost.
SUPMALE:You know, he's feeling like the world is just rushing by him, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:Everybody's getting into all these new things and he's just stuck kicking it in the pool house.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I mean, you know, per se.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I mean, I guess he's feeling embarrassed you know, that he's the only one that ain't doing nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, then I suggest you tell your friend the story my father told me.
SUPMALE:It's the tale of the young Earl of Monroe who wanted to build a bridge over the River Mersey.
LEADFEMALE:He labored for years and years and finally he was all done and quite proud of himself.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:So I guess what you're saying is I should just tell my boy that if he applies himself, everything gonna be cool.
SUPFEMALE:Well, actually, when the earl completed the bridge, he flung himself off it.
OTHERMALE:Dude killed himself?
OTHERFEMALE:Quite.
LEADMALE:Now, if you'll excuse me, Master William, I have dinner to prepare.
OTHERMALE:That's the advice that your father gave you? My father was not a well man.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey, we are really gonna miss your cooking.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, not to mention your cleaning.
OTHERMALE:I'll never find anyone who can iron the way you do.
LEADMALE:Don't even go there.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Will, with Geoffrey leaving, there's a job opening here in the house.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I guess I could start by washing your pants in a thimble.
LEADFEMALE:You know, this is one of the last times that we'll all be sitting together around this table for a while.
SUPFEMALE:We should cherish these few moments we have as a family.
LEADMALE:I'm really gonna miss you guys.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, not to worry, Big Guy.
LEADFEMALE:Will's gonna be sitting around this table for years to come.
SUPMALE:Leave Will alone.
LEADFEMALE:He can stay in the pool house for as long as he wants.
LEADMALE:Right, Daddy?
OTHERMALE:Well It's either that or the Homeboy Homeless Shelter.
SUPFEMALE:Ha! For your information, midget boy, I already got an apartment.
LEADMALE:You did? Well, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, I was gonna surprise y'all, you know, but You're moving?
SUPMALE:Yeah, I'm moving.
LEADMALE:Don't toy with my emotions, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I've been waiting a long time, I'm very vulnerable.
SUPMALE:Look, I said, I'm moving, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:The pool house is mine.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's you.
OTHERMALE:Circling apartments, eh? Looks like you've painted yourself into a corner this time, Master William.
LEADFEMALE:Well, don't you worry about me.
LEADMALE:I'm one of the best corner-getter-outers that there is.
LEADFEMALE:You'll see.
SUPFEMALE:But I'm saying, you know I mean, you do got my back, right? Within a week, I shall be at 30,000 feet headed to London with many tiny bottles of Jim Beam dancing in front of me.
LEADMALE:But until then your back is mine.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks a lot, G.
LEADMALE:Good morning, Will.
LEADMALE:Hey, what's up, Uncle Phil? I hope you didn't misconstrue my enthusiasm over your leaving, last night.
OTHERMALE:I'm really proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Heh, heh.
OTHERMALE:In fact, I'm even a little envious.
LEADMALE:I mean, there's nothing more exciting than change.
OTHERMALE:You know, I have a little story I'd like to tell you.
LEADFEMALE:When did the story fairy descend on this house? Look, Uncle Phil, can we do that later? You know, I gotta go check out a few things for my spot.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, sure.
LEADMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:What do you want? Um I'm here to see the apartment.
SUPFEMALE:Fine.
LEADMALE:Don't touch that channel! It's one bedroom with a bath.
LEADMALE:One parking space.
OTHERMALE:No loud music That cupcake's mine! I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:You have company? No.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought somebody was there, you know, because No.
SUPMALE:I'm alone.

LEADFEMALE:Hold on.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, I have the airline on the phone.
LEADFEMALE:In lieu of my spring bonus, I think it would be a magnificent gesture if you sent me back to London first class on the Concorde.
LEADMALE:What would you consider an adequate gesture? Business class with a kosher meal.
LEADFEMALE:What would be less than adequate? Working here another year.
SUPMALE:I'll get back to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:There you are.
LEADMALE:Sit down, we need to have a little talk.
LEADMALE:ALL: Will did it.
OTHERFEMALE:No one did anything.

SUPFEMALE:We expect you to behave yourselves just as you do at home.
OTHERMALE:The same rules apply.
LEADFEMALE:Then what's the point of moving? Can I have that one back? I don't know that these rules apply, I'm 25.

LEADFEMALE:Oh, cool.
LEADFEMALE:Peter.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, so when you moving out?  I'm not moving out.

LEADFEMALE:Master Nicky, I do sympathize with your plight but I leave in a matter of days.
LEADFEMALE:That's plenty of time to paint.
OTHERFEMALE:Chop-chop.
SUPFEMALE:Master William, any luck with your search? Man, I saw some of the nastiest places this city has to offer.
LEADMALE:Oh, well.
LEADMALE:You'll have better luck tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Suppose you right if I was gonna keep looking.
SUPFEMALE:G, what would you say if I said I think I may have made a mistake? The word "duh" comes to mind.
OTHERMALE:Well, you know what? I know what I'm gonna do.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna march right up to Uncle Phil and just tell him I lied.
SUPMALE:I mean, I'm a man, you know.
SUPMALE:I can admit to my mistakes.
OTHERMALE:That's all it was, a mistake.
OTHERMALE:Mistakes can be undone.
LEADMALE:You learn, you move on.
LEADFEMALE:So what? I can admit I was completely wrong and I can take my lumps.
SUPMALE:Lumps I earned.
LEADMALE:A man's lumps.
LEADMALE:Uncle Phil can relate to that.
LEADFEMALE:He a man, he lumpy.
SUPFEMALE:Well said.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna march right up to Uncle Phil and I'm gonna say, "This man is staying in the pool house.

SUPFEMALE:CARLTON: Oh, whoa, whoa.
LEADMALE:Hold on.
SUPMALE:I mean, do we really wanna sell this house in a soft market? Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:It's soft, Uncle Phil.

LEADMALE:We wanna be close to you guys.
LEADMALE:Well, why just be close? Let's all live together.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Did I say that? It's gonna be great.
LEADMALE:Oh, Will, we were so caught up in our own excitement, we forgot about your news.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, what do you wanna tell us? Oh.

SUPMALE:Come out, come out, wherever you are.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, stop.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton, stop.
OTHERMALE:I don't have an apartment.
LEADMALE:What? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I never had one.
LEADMALE:Why'd you lie? I don't know, man.
LEADMALE:Y'all was all going on with your stuff.
SUPMALE:Look, I just did.
LEADFEMALE:Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Will, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:When I gave you a hard time earlier about frittering I didn't mean anything by it.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADMALE:It's just that you was right.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Will, why don't you move back East with us? You could transfer to a school in New York.
LEADFEMALE:You could take the job on the Hilary Show, you could be near the family.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, just make it easy on yourself.
LEADMALE:Carlton, I don't wanna make it easy on myself.
SUPMALE:I came out here to go to school and that's what I'm gonna do.
SUPMALE:Period.
SUPFEMALE:I started it and I'm gonna finish it.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I just need to get myself situated.
OTHERMALE:So, what are you gonna do? Gotta get out there and look for a place.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? Dad could help you out in a minute.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna go
OTHERFEMALE:Carlton, no.
OTHERMALE:Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:No, I don't want Uncle Phil to know nothing about this.
SUPMALE:Why? That's dumb.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, I do not need Uncle Phil to clean up all my messes.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
SUPMALE:You are gonna swear to me right now, you ain't gonna say nothing to nobody.
LEADMALE:Okay, Will.
OTHERFEMALE:I swear.
LEADMALE:Hello, Master William, you're back early.
LEADFEMALE:How's the apartment hunt going? Pfft.
SUPFEMALE:Please, don't ask.
LEADFEMALE:Where's everybody at? They're gone.
LEADMALE:We're showing the house today, remember? Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:What are you still doing here? That's a question that haunts me every day.
LEADMALE:Actually, I'm here to answer questions about the house.
LEADFEMALE:That is not your job.
LEADMALE:There they go abusing you again.
LEADMALE:I mean, I love them but it hurts me so bad the way they treat you.
LEADMALE:G, you go ahead get out of here, man.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:You will do your best? What would make me happier than selling the house? Not selling the house? Yep.
SUPFEMALE:You know, this looks like a great place, Arnold.
SUPMALE:Yeah, Willis would love it.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that is if he wouldn't mind living over a haunted Indian burial ground.
LEADMALE:Who are you? Hey, I'm Will Smith.
LEADMALE:I'm the Realto.
LEADMALE:At night, you can hear the wailing of the dead.
OTHERMALE:What you talking about, Will? I think he's overstating it a little bit, Arnold.
OTHERFEMALE:You're probably right, Dad.
LEADMALE:Let's check out this fly pad.
LEADFEMALE:I could get used to living in the lap of luxury.
LEADMALE:You know, those things were a lot funnier when you were still a little child.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, well, Dad, your little stories were a lot more interesting back then too.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, let's check out the wet bar.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait, wait.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, we don't have one.
LEADMALE:Let's check out the house down the street.
LEADMALE:Thanks anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:And this is the living room.
SUPMALE:Come on, shake a leg.
SUPFEMALE:We gotta get to the Universal Tour and see the Backdraft ride.
LEADMALE:Oh, then you should probably leave now before the fire goes out.
OTHERMALE:Oh, believe me, Will.
SUPFEMALE:The fire went out a long time ago.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, George, this place is beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm telling you, Weezy, we can't afford it.
LEADFEMALE:How can you say that? Easy.
SUPFEMALE:He's cheap.
LEADFEMALE:If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut.
LEADFEMALE:Out here, there are a lot of people crossing the border to get a job like yours.
LEADFEMALE:One look at a bald-headed miser like you, they'll be crossing right back over.
LEADFEMALE:I'm telling you, Weezy, it's too expensive.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, loosen up, George.
SUPMALE:I like it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yeah, and let me tell you.
SUPMALE:Next door, ooh, the girls, man.
LEADMALE:Bikinis all that.
SUPMALE:They got a regular Playboy mansion jumping off over there.
LEADMALE:Memorial Day, it all comes off, you know what I'm talking about?
SUPFEMALE:You know what I'm talking about, boy?
LEADMALE:Ha, ha! Come on, George.
SUPFEMALE:This place is too expensive.
SUPFEMALE:It all comes off, huh?
SUPMALE:Man, let me tell you George! 
SUPMALE:Hey, hey, what's up, y'all?
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADFEMALE:Sir, it's the Realto.
LEADFEMALE:Now, don't get your hopes up, Uncle Phil.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it could take weeks or months, even years to sell a house.
LEADMALE:Yeah?  Great.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADFEMALE:We have a buyer.
SUPFEMALE:VIVIAN: What?
LEADFEMALE:That's fantastic.
LEADFEMALE:A couple.
LEADMALE:The Jeffersons.
LEADFEMALE:There's only one catch.
LEADMALE:We have to be out in a week.
OTHERMALE:Why such a rush? Something about being in by Memorial Day and it all coming off.
LEADFEMALE:We can't possibly be out in seven days.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we have to organize, we have to pack, we have to move.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Geoffrey only has two hands.
LEADFEMALE:Our apartment's not even ready.
SUPMALE:Where are we gonna live? And my dorm room's not ready.
SUPFEMALE:And what about Will? Oh, Will's set, huh?  I have an idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't we check into the Plaza Hotel? Or perhaps the Hilton.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Good one, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:All right, all right, we'll stay at the Plaza.
SUPFEMALE:Let's crack open a bottle of champagne.
SUPMALE:Ooh, champagne.
LEADMALE:Girl.
LEADMALE:So, Will, what are you gonna do? Hey, hey, hey, no need to stress, C.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I still got seven days.
LEADMALE:God built the whole universe in that much time.
SUPMALE:He had better credit.
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, I know I don't have any references and I don't have any credit, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, is it? Oh, it is? Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Well Get the Ha, ha Hello? Hello? I cannot believe it's that hard to rent an apartment.
LEADMALE:Yes, to think that all landlords wouldn't jump at the chance to rent to somebody with no job, no references, no credit.
SUPFEMALE:It's because I'm black, ain't it? Hey, Will.
LEADFEMALE:How's your apartment? Is everything set up? Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:It's cool, Uncle Phil.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:All set.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:I haven't seen it.
SUPMALE:Has anyone? Oh, well, from When I took the, um Yeah, yeah.
LEADMALE:I have.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what does it look like? Well, it's wall-to-wall doors and floor-to-ceiling floors.
LEADFEMALE:It's neat.
SUPMALE:It makes this place look tiny.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADMALE:Ahem.
SUPMALE:You know, I think Carlton's just bragging a little too much.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna see it.
SUPMALE:We'd all like to see it.
SUPMALE:Um, well, you can't.
LEADMALE:Because it's tented.
LEADMALE:Look, C No, you can't because I don't have an apartment.
SUPFEMALE:It's a condo is what it is.
LEADFEMALE:Look, that's all right.
SUPFEMALE:That's all right, C.
LEADMALE:Um, I don't have an apartment and I never had one.
LEADFEMALE:Would you excuse us for a minute, please? I'm sorry, Will.
LEADFEMALE:What the hell is going on? Look, um, Uncle Phil, this is not really your concern.
LEADMALE:You know, it's about me, it's not about you.
LEADMALE:So don't even worry about it, all right?
LEADMALE:How can you say that? We are leaving town in a day and you don't have a place to live.
LEADFEMALE:Why did you lie? I mean, we sitting around the table and everybody talking about all these great lives and these new things they're doing.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't want you to say: "Hey, there's my nephew.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, he's still living in my pool house.
LEADMALE:" I didn't want you to think that all these years that I've been out here just ain't worth nothing.
LEADMALE:You know, that you just been wasting your time with me.
LEADMALE:Look, Uncle Phil, I just don't want you to think that I'm that same stupid kid I was when I first moved out here.
OTHERMALE:How could you possibly believe that that's what I'd be thinking? Look at you.
LEADFEMALE:You're moving out on your own.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna finish college in a year.
SUPFEMALE:You're becoming a man.
LEADMALE:A man I'm damn proud of.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't want your last memory of me to be no better than the first one.
LEADFEMALE:You have no idea what my first memory of you is.
LEADFEMALE:I remember a kid loaded with all the potential in the world.
SUPMALE:And now I see a person on the verge of realizing that potential.
SUPMALE:Come on, let's go get you an apartment.
LEADMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil, um what you mean by verge?
SUPMALE:Don't push your luck.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait, check this out.
OTHERFEMALE:I didn't know I had two Biggie Smalls CDs.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:One of them is mine.
LEADMALE:You own a Biggie Smalls CD? Well, you know, I'd like to think of myself as with it.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, look at you, boy.
SUPFEMALE:Six years, you couldn't fight the flood, could you? Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:I know I don't own two What's New Pussycats? I don't know why we standing here talking.
LEADFEMALE:We gotta get packed, man.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Will this is the last time we'll ever live together.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:We've been through a lot together.
LEADMALE:Childhood to manhood.
LEADMALE:It's been a good trip.
SUPFEMALE:It's been a great trip.
LEADFEMALE:Look, whenever, wherever, I got your back, C.
LEADFEMALE:Whenever, wherever, I've got your back, W.
SUPFEMALE:That just doesn't sound right coming from me, does it? Sounds great, man.
LEADFEMALE:You know what? CARLTON: What are you doing? Oh, no, no.
LEADFEMALE:You got to do it.
OTHERFEMALE:One last time for me, man.
LEADFEMALE: It's not unusual to be loved by anyone It's not unusual to have fun with anyone But when I see you hanging about With anyone It's not unusual to see me cry I wanna die It's not unusual to go out at any time But when I see you out and about It's such a crime If you should ever wanna Be loved by anyone It's not unusual It happens every day No matter what you say  Wow, it's so empty.

LEADMALE:A lifetime's worth.
LEADMALE:You okay? Yeah, yeah.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I'm cool.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm cool, Uncle Phil.

SUPFEMALE:But for the past six years, it's like we've been family.
LEADMALE:I just don't wanna go back to being just a relative again.
