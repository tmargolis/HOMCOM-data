OTHERFEMALE:Yo, yo, what's up? This is Will.
LEADFEMALE:I can 't get to the phone right now.
LEADFEMALE:I kind of got my hands full.
LEADMALE:So leave a message, unless this is Carlton, in which case, don 't.
SUPFEMALE:Will, it's Carlton.
LEADMALE:I got an emergency.
LEADMALE:Will, we just finished dinner and I think I left my wallet on the dresser, so could
LEADFEMALE:Who was that?
LEADMALE:It's just a wrong number, baby.
SUPMALE:Now, where was I? Oh, there I was.
LEADMALE:Greetings.
LEADMALE:Look, munchkin, a romantic dinner for two.
LEADFEMALE:Jazzy, maybe we should revise our plans.
LEADMALE:You're right, my pet.
LEADFEMALE:Let's unpack after we eat.
SUPMALE:I told the landlord, I don't you repainting our apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Those stains have memories.
OTHERMALE:Jazz, homey, look, now, you know, mi casa es su casa.
LEADFEMALE:But, look, tonight, mi casa es mi casa.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay, Will, I think I better go.
LEADMALE:But, wait, wait.
LEADMALE:Hey, hey, hey, baby.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, you ain't got to do that.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, I do.
OTHERMALE:I'm really hungry.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, baby, baby, I can have some Rotiserie Gold here in six minutes.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you've done it again, haven't you? Done what, Jazzy? Munchkin, perhaps our visit is a little ill-timed.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry, me and Jewel could sleep out on a park bench.
LEADMALE:I hear rain is nature's moisturizer.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, look, y'all might as well just stay.
OTHERMALE:You done messed everything up already anyway.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for hanging up.
LEADMALE:I got thrown out of the restaurant and got a ticket for driving without a license.
LEADMALE:What are they doing here? Jazz's apartment is getting repainted.
LEADMALE:Oh, like I care.
LEADMALE:I'm going to my room, putting on my jammies and calling it a D-A-Y.
LEADMALE:Either his head's getting smaller or his butt's getting bigger.
LEADFEMALE:There's a whole army of these action figures around my bed.
SUPMALE:They're fertility gods, Carlton.
LEADFEMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Y'all trying to have a baby? Yeah.
SUPMALE:Just because we're away from the marital bed don't mean we ain't 
SUPMALE:Hey, whoa, whoa, guys.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, listen.
LEADFEMALE:I'm all for this being fruitful and multiplying thing but it's kind of close quarters here so you think y'all can put a boom-shaka-lock on it for a minute? I'd like to accommodate you, my brother, but we're on a mission.
OTHERMALE:Not on my Posturepedic, bud.
LEADMALE:Excuse us for a second.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, Jazz, man, look.
LEADMALE:I'm happy for you and your wife, but you think this mission could get scrubbed for a minute until your rocket is back on its launching pad? No can do, Will.
SUPMALE:The doctor at the clinic says this is when I'm at my most fertile which reminds me, sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:I took my temperature, all systems go.
SUPFEMALE:Permission to board the mother ship.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, you don't.
LEADMALE:There'll be no boarding of any kind, Mr.
LEADMALE:And Mrs What the heck is your last name anyway? Hey, that's my bed.
LEADMALE:Carlton, relax, I'll get you some new Barney sheets.
LEADMALE:I cannot believe they're at it again.
LEADMALE:Man, they are not human.
SUPMALE:Hey, Jazz.
LEADMALE:This ain't funny, man.
LEADMALE:I command you to stop.
SUPMALE:Roll away from the woman.
LEADFEMALE:I can't take this anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm gonna go sleep with Mom and Dad.
LEADMALE:Careful Uncle Phil doesn't roll over on you again.
LEADMALE:Well, the little darling's fast asleep.
LEADMALE:Are you sure you didn't kill her? I realize what a inconvenience we've been.
LEADFEMALE:But since you ain't getting us no wedding present, this is the least you could do.
LEADMALE:What are you talking about, man? I gave you a wedding.
LEADFEMALE:Take that to the bank.
SUPFEMALE:Look, Will, making a baby is a truly blessed event.
SUPFEMALE:I think you mean "having a baby," Jazz.
OTHERMALE:Trust me on this.
LEADMALE:Look, Will, my Jewel's fondest dream is to have a child of her own.
LEADMALE:I love her.
SUPMALE:She's my delicate little flower.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, crank it up! Hey, take it easy in there, we're not insured.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't think it's a very good idea for Jazz and Jewel to reproduce.
LEADMALE:Right, big guy.
LEADMALE:The prisons are crowded enough.
OTHERFEMALE:That's not fair.
LEADFEMALE:If Jazz and Jewel wanna bring a child into this world who are we to judge? We're not exactly perfect.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:So have you kids shopped for Mother's Day? I'm afraid I haven't had a chance to buy their gifts.
OTHERMALE:I'll get to the mall after lunch.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Geoffrey is picking out your presents? Of course not, big guy.
LEADMALE:We told him exactly what to get.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:Down to the very last detail, sir.
SUPMALE:Let's see, there's " some kind of perfume or something," from Miss Hilary.
SUPMALE:"A book might be neat," from Miss Ashley.
SUPFEMALE:And, " here's 20 bucks and I expect some change back" from Master Carlton.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you kids.
SUPMALE:How will your mother feel when she finds out you didn't do your own shopping? Oh, I have no problem with my own shopping.
LEADMALE:I got my Mom something she gonna love.
OTHERFEMALE:She always wanted to get my baby shoes bronzed, but she never got around to it.
LEADMALE:So I hooked her up.
LEADFEMALE:Those are your baby shoes? Well, yeah.
SUPMALE:I had big feet.
SUPFEMALE:You know what they say about a guy with big feet.
SUPMALE:No, what? They be saying, "Damn, you got some big feet.
OTHERFEMALE:" Well As much as it pains me to admit it Will's got the right idea.
LEADFEMALE:This year, I want you to pick out something handpicked personal and from the heart.
OTHERMALE:Now, you go out there and shop.
SUPMALE:Yeah, that's right.
SUPMALE:Feel ashamed of your sorry selves.
LEADFEMALE:You feel ashamed of your sorry selves.
LEADFEMALE:Eloquent, sirs.
OTHERFEMALE:Thank you, Geoffrey.
SUPFEMALE:Makes me wanna do something special for Mrs.
SUPMALE:Banks myself.
SUPFEMALE:So you don't want me to get the usual dozen roses? No, that's good enough.
LEADMALE:Hey, Will.
LEADMALE:Hey, I'm surprised y'all can walk.
LEADFEMALE:Your levity is inappropriate.
LEADFEMALE:We've been at the free clinic all morning to find out why my oven is as yet bunless.
LEADFEMALE:Y'all haven't been baking long.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, and I'm sure, if you stick with that recipe you'll get the ingredients mixed up How can you think about food at a time like this? I mean, we ain't never gonna have a baby because my little soldiers ain't marching.
LEADFEMALE:Bummer.
LEADMALE:Jazz, didn't I tell you to not be wearing them bikini drawers? You told me not to wear them in the streets.
LEADMALE:You ain't tell me not to wear them.
LEADFEMALE:All right, all right.
SUPMALE:You know what? It's probably just stress.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm sure that's what it is, man.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, y'all just got married, and you're always running from the law.
LEADMALE:And you know what? Why don't you go to another free clinic, get a second opinion.
LEADMALE:We can't afford another free clinic.
LEADMALE:Jazz, look.
LEADMALE:I'm really sorry for you, man.
LEADMALE:I mean, hey, at least y'all tried.
OTHERFEMALE:Never heard two people try harder.
LEADMALE:Don't try to comfort me, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I'm uncomfortable.
LEADMALE:Hey, look, Jewel.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:If there's anything I can do
LEADMALE:As a matter of fact, there is.
SUPMALE:Whatever it is, just let me know.
SUPFEMALE:You really mean that, Will?
SUPMALE:Name it.
SUPMALE:I want your little soldiers.
LEADMALE:What do you say? Can I have your baby? I'd really appreciate it.
LEADFEMALE:Jewel, come on.
SUPMALE:You are my best friend's wife.
LEADFEMALE:As much as that excites me, I think I better pass.
SUPFEMALE:I don't want your body, Will.
LEADFEMALE:I want your little soldiers.
SUPFEMALE:Do I look like the U.
LEADMALE:N? Jewel, if Jazz ever found out about this, it would kill him.
OTHERMALE:So you in? You know about this? Know about it? It was my idea.
SUPMALE:What are y'all asking me to do? Hey, look.
LEADMALE:How about I give y'all something else, like a VCR? You hear that, munchkin? He's giving us a VCR too.
SUPFEMALE:He's so full of love.
LEADMALE:Let's hope so.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, having a baby is a big responsibility.
LEADMALE:We're ready for it.
SUPMALE:Why, I even started saving for little Junior's college fund.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, I don't think I can do this.
LEADMALE:Sure you can.
LEADMALE:Will.
SUPMALE:Remember that time we went to go play ball and your shoelace broke and I gave you mine? Same thing.
SUPFEMALE:Jazz, man.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you have some relatives or something? Why me? I mean, you got a good heart.
LEADFEMALE:And you got a lot of smarts and you're tall, and you got good teeth.
OTHERMALE:Of course, we'll be praying he gets my ears.
LEADFEMALE:We really want this baby, Will.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, we love him already.
LEADMALE:And we love you too.
LEADMALE:And there's no one else we'd ask to be a part of our family.
SUPMALE:How about a toaster? Kids, I don't know how to thank you.
SUPMALE:Such thoughtful gifts.
SUPMALE:Well, you deserve them, Mom.
LEADMALE:And these roses they are exquisite.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, honey.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, you know, it's the thought that counts.
LEADMALE:Yes, so think about sleeping on the couch for a while.
SUPFEMALE:Mother, I wanted to buy you the perfect gift.
LEADFEMALE:Something that would show you just how special you are.
LEADMALE:But I couldn't find it, so I made it myself.
OTHERMALE:You made something? Hilary, you can't even make change.
