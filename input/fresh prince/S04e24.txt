LEADMALE:It's a great way for Will to see the country.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
LEADMALE:Come on, Phil.
LEADMALE:The boy could use a little adventure.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, but this is a family discussion.
LEADMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.

LEADMALE:I'll wait in the pool house.

OTHERFEMALE:Philip, for God's sake.
LEADFEMALE:He waltzes in here after 15 years?
SUPFEMALE:Fourteen.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, 14 years.
LEADFEMALE:And acts like nothing has happened.
LEADMALE:Wake up, Will.
LEADFEMALE:This is the same guy who didn't think enough of you to pick up the phone.
OTHERFEMALE:He made a mistake.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry that everybody can't be as perfect as you, Uncle Phil.
OTHERFEMALE:But if I can forgive him, how come you can't? Because he's doing this for himself.
LEADFEMALE:If you think any differently, then you're a fool.
LEADMALE:Hey, just cool it.
LEADFEMALE:Just cool down.
LEADFEMALE:We can talk about this another time.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what, Aunt Viv ain't even nothing to talk about.
LEADMALE:I've been waiting for this for a long time, my whole life and ain't nobody gonna stop me.
SUPFEMALE:Come tomorrow, I'm out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:Who cares what you think? You are not my father! You know, sir whenever I'm feeling blue I think of the poem my dear mum used to recite to me as a lad.
LEADFEMALE:The master lives a life of ease While we live life upon our knees Waste not your tears And save your breath For soon he'll die a violent death Works for me.
LEADFEMALE:Daddy, I had a little accident at the mall.
LEADFEMALE:I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:But I totaled your MasterCard.
SUPMALE:That's okay, honey.
LEADMALE:Everybody makes mistakes.
LEADMALE:Here, pick a card.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll just take this pretty gold one.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:What's with him?
LEADFEMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:He's like a genie on Valium.
OTHERMALE:Make a wish, hurry.
LEADMALE:Daddy, there's a dance next Friday, but it's not over till midnight.
SUPFEMALE:That's okay, stay out as late as you wish.
LEADMALE:Really?
LEADFEMALE:Well, then, can l?
SUPMALE:Hey, save some for me.
LEADFEMALE:Say, big guy
OTHERMALE:Carlton am I a good father?
LEADMALE:Are you kidding? You're the best.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you, son.
LEADFEMALE:Can I have access to my trust fund?
LEADFEMALE:Not a chance.
SUPMALE:I hate you! Oh, yeah? Well, take a number.
LEADFEMALE:Here comes Mr.
LEADMALE:Sunshine.
LEADMALE:Shut up, Geoffrey.
LEADFEMALE:Philip, stop moping.
LEADMALE:You know Will didn't mean what he said.
LEADMALE:Well, why'd he say it? For four years, I treated that boy like my own son.
SUPMALE:Whether he needed a pat on the head or a kick in the pants, I was there for him.
LEADMALE:I worked my ass off trying to keep him in line.
SUPMALE:And yet, it's come back with a vengeance.
SUPMALE:I have done everything for Will.
SUPFEMALE:Suddenly, it's like none of that matters.
OTHERMALE:I can't believe he could be so selfish.
LEADMALE:Philip, listen to yourself.
LEADMALE:Somebody's being selfish all right, but it isn't Will.
LEADFEMALE:Will, do you mind if I move your things around while you're gone? No, it's cool.
OTHERFEMALE:Knock yourself out, man.
SUPMALE:You know, Carlton, up until a few days ago I never even thought I'd see my father again.
SUPMALE:It was like I couldn't even think about it because I knew it wasn't gonna happen.
LEADMALE:But I still managed to keep the fantasy.
OTHERMALE:Now it's real.
LEADMALE:I can't believe how lucky I am.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it's a miracle.
LEADMALE:Hold the tape measure.
LEADMALE:Carlton, I'm only going for the summer, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:Can I speak to Will alone, please? You're not gonna talk him into staying?
LEADFEMALE:Get out.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Look Uncle Phil, I owe you an apology.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, I'm the one.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I guess we both said some things we didn't mean.
SUPMALE:No, I meant what I said.
LEADFEMALE:I was just out of line.
LEADFEMALE:Uncle Phil, man, you know I appreciate everything you've done for me.
LEADMALE:But this ain't about you.
SUPMALE:This is something I gotta do for me.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know.
OTHERMALE:I know, son.
LEADFEMALE:And I wish you the best.
LEADMALE:Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:I'll miss you.
SUPFEMALE:Me too, man.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:I mean, you know that this is just for the summer, right? Where's Lou? He's supposed to be here an hour ago.
SUPMALE:I knew this was gonna happen.
LEADMALE:Maybe he got stuck in traffic.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, on his way out of town.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Smith has arrived.
OTHERMALE:Sorry, I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:Business.
LEADMALE:I talked to this guy who's got this shipment.
OTHERMALE:Gotta go from L.
LEADFEMALE:A.
LEADMALE:To Maine in 72 hours if I can make it.
LEADMALE:And I can make it because I am the best.
LEADMALE:And I'll make myself a quick five grand.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:That's terrific.
SUPFEMALE:You and Will better get a move on.
SUPFEMALE:Well, now, that's the problem.
LEADMALE:As good as I am, I can't make the deadline by myself.
LEADFEMALE:So I'm gonna pick up an extra driver.
OTHERFEMALE:So there won't be any room for Will.
LEADMALE:Not this trip, no.
LEADFEMALE:But, you know, I'll tell you what, Lou.
LEADMALE:I'll buy Will a plane ticket to Maine and that way you could hook up and have the summer together.
SUPMALE:That's mighty generous of you, Philip but this job could lead to another big one and I gotta stay flexible, you know what I'm saying? Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know what you're saying.
LEADMALE:Will is gonna be crushed.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's why I was thinking maybe you two should break the news to him.
LEADFEMALE:Vivian, would you take Nicky upstairs, please? You're not gonna hit him, are you? Because I don't wanna miss that.
OTHERFEMALE:No, I'm not gonna hit him.
LEADFEMALE:Lou, if you walk out of Will's life now don't you ever come back.
OTHERFEMALE:Sit down.
SUPMALE:I ain't got time for no lecture.
SUPMALE:I said, sit down, Lou.
SUPMALE:You know, Will was doing just fine till you showed up.
LEADMALE:But now that you're back, you have responsibilities to him.
LEADMALE:Look, we're still gonna take the trip.
SUPMALE:Oh, bull! Bull.
OTHERMALE:Will is not a coat that you hang in the closet then pick it up when you're ready to wear it.
LEADMALE:His life goes on.
SUPFEMALE:He's not supposed to be here for you.
LEADMALE:You're supposed to be here for him.
SUPFEMALE:You get off my back! You think I want this? It just happened.
LEADMALE:Now, when Will was a baby, I was scared Cut the crap, all right? Cut it.
SUPFEMALE:Because I've been there.
LEADMALE:But I didn't run out on my family.
LEADMALE:I was there every day for them.
OTHERMALE:Because that's what a man does.
LEADMALE:Fine, Philip.
SUPMALE:You win.
OTHERMALE:You the man.
LEADFEMALE:You a better man than me.
LEADFEMALE:You happy? Now you gonna tell Will or not? I'm not gonna do your dirty work for you.
LEADFEMALE:Fine.
SUPMALE:I'll call him.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, do that.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I'll do that.
OTHERFEMALE:Daddy-O.
LEADMALE:What's up? Will.
SUPFEMALE:Man, I'm glad you're here.
LEADFEMALE:Some business came up I gotta handle.
SUPFEMALE:So we're gonna have to put our trip on hold.
SUPMALE:You understand? Yeah, that's cool.
LEADMALE:Just for a couple of weeks.
SUPFEMALE:I understand.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe a little longer.
SUPMALE:Yeah, whatever.
LEADMALE:Whatever.
LEADFEMALE:Look, I'll call you next week and we'll iron out the details.
LEADMALE:Okay?
LEADMALE:Yeah, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:It was great seeing you, son.
SUPFEMALE:You too, Lou.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry, Will.
LEADMALE:Actually, this works out better for me.
LEADFEMALE:The slimmies this summer come to class wearing next to nothing.
SUPMALE:Will, it's all right to be angry.
OTHERMALE:Hey, why should I be mad? At least he said goodbye this time.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish I hadn't wasted my money buying this stupid present.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:If there was something that l You know what, you ain't got to do nothing, Uncle Phil.
LEADMALE:It ain't like I'm still 5 years old.
LEADMALE:Ain't like I'll be sitting up every night asking my 
OTHERMALE:"When's Daddy coming home?" Who needs him? He wasn't there to teach me how to shoot my first basket, but I learned.
OTHERFEMALE:And I got pretty good at it too.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Got through my first date without him.
LEADFEMALE:I learned how to drive.
LEADFEMALE:I learned how to shave.
LEADMALE:How to fight.
LEADMALE:I had 14 great birthdays without him.
LEADMALE:He never even sent me a damn card.
LEADFEMALE:To hell with him! I didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
LEADMALE:Will
LEADMALE:You know what, Uncle Phil? I'm gonna get through college without him.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get a great job without him.
LEADMALE:I'll marry a beautiful honey, have a bunch of kids and be a better father than he ever was.
LEADMALE:I don't need him for that, because there ain't a thing he could ever teach me about how to love my kids.
OTHERFEMALE:How come he don't want me, man? 
LEADMALE:
