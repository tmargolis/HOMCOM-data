Come check this out.
Look at all this stuff I found up in the attic.
What? Wh Why, that's my old trumpet.
I haven't seen that thing in ages.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, man, I didn't know you played the trumpet.
When I was in college a little bit, you know.
The girls all like a musician, you know?   I met him after Princeton.
Wow, look at all this stuff.
My old coloring books.
My diary.
Wait a minute, I didn't have Barbie.
Who had a Barbie? Well, it's not mine.
My Barbie's at home fast asleep in her Barbie Dream House.
Um It doesn't matter whose it is.
Let me see this trumpet.

Hey, hey, hey.
Morning, everybody.
Morning, Will.
Oh.
Y'all remember, don't nobody mention to Carlton that William Shatner's gonna be on Hilary's show.
Don't you think you're being unfair? He's coming on the show and you know Carlton is a huge fan of his.
Who's gonna be on Hilary's show, and who am I a huge fan of? Uh Uh Uh Billy.
Billy who? Uh Uh Uh Uh Billy Butterworth.
You are never going to believe what's happened.
Oh, yeah.
Billy Butterworth's gonna be on your show.
Big deal.
What are you talking about? William Shatner's on the show.
Actor, director, novelist, bon vivant William Shatner? And you knew? You slept in the same pool house with me knowing this knowing what it would mean to me, and you didn't say a word? I don't even know who you are.
Look, Carlton, it ain't like I'm Hello? I wasn't finished.
Hilary, you gotta introduce him to me.
No.
The network is so thrilled with all of our great guests that they wanna move the show to New York.
New York?
Yeah.
There was a meeting with the VIPs and they think we're ready for the big time.
Oh, wait, wait.
Wait a minute, Hilary.
I can't just uproot just like that.
Okay.
What do you mean "okay?"
I'm gonna be out of a job.
So come.
Hilary, I can't come.
I still gotta finish school.
Okay.
What? Look, Hilary, how come I didn't find out about this before? Oh, don't tell me someone withheld information from somebody.
So just like that, you're moving to New York and I'm out of a job.
 Okay.
What about New York? They're moving Hilary's show to New York.
Oh, my God, that's wonderful.
This is the best news I've ever heard.
It's unbelievable.
Ashley, you've never been this happy for me.
I still haven't been.
This is about me.
I can still move to New York.
Now, just hold on, young lady.
You said I couldn't move to New York and go to The School of Performing Arts because I couldn't move there by myself.
But now that Hilary's going
Oh, we'll be roommates.
 Ashley.
Ashley, calm down.
There's more than that one reason for your not moving to New York.
Like what?
Uh l I think you know.
No, I don't.
Come on.
Up in Dad's office, there's a Sunday New York Times.
We can find an apartment from there.
Hey, hey, hey.
Stay out of my office.
You can jump in here any time, Vivian.
Perhaps that iron fist that you rule with has gotten a bit rusty, sir.
Perhaps I should hit something.
Be careful of misguided anger, sir.
I'm gonna go down and have Shatner sign my copy of his new book, Man o' War.
What to wear? What to wear? What to wear? Hil, I gotta let you know, I'm more than a little upset about how you played me with this whole New York thing.
This is a wound that will not quickly heal.
Okay.
Hilary.
I'm Dick West.
I'm with the network.
Oh.
We're just pleased as punch to have you aboard, pretty lady.
Oh, thank you.
We're really excited about New York.
Everyone, I'd like you to meet William Shatner.
How you doing? Will Smith.
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.

Thought beaming down would be too flashy, huh? Good one, Dick.
Thanks, guy.

Here you go.
Thanks.
Now sit back down.
Will, I wanna play pool too.
No.
Come on, just one shot.
I wanna be able to say that I shot pool with William Shatner.
Carlton, he doesn't like you.
How could he like you more than me? You haven't even read any of his books.
He doesn't care about any of that stuff.
