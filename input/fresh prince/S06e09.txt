OTHERFEMALE:What the hell are you doing down here? Oh, um, I thought I heard somebody breaking in.
SUPFEMALE:What you doing down here? Uh, the same thing.
LEADFEMALE:Pie's in the fridge.
LEADFEMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing like sneaking a little pie before Thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:Shh! Shh!
OTHERFEMALE:Don't shush me.
SUPMALE:This is not the first Philip Banks pie-jacking.
LEADFEMALE:Son, son, I have been jacking pies since, what, Thanksgiving 1953.
SUPFEMALE:Rhubarb.
LEADFEMALE:Tart little thing.
LEADMALE:From then on, the dog ate the pie.
LEADMALE:  Hey.
LEADMALE:So I guess it's your nose I should've been shoving in the pan.
LEADFEMALE:Well, actually, keeping his nose out of the pan would have been more of a punishment.
LEADMALE:Get off of me.
LEADFEMALE:Mother.
LEADFEMALE:My sweet Mommy.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mom.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a few secrets of my own.
LEADFEMALE:I have been stashing away a pie or two ever since I saw the size of your sweet tooth.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Grandma Hattie, the pie hider.
OTHERMALE:Aah!
LEADMALE:I suppose the dog ate this one too.
LEADFEMALE:I ain't had nothing to do with it.
LEADMALE:He ate it.
OTHERMALE:You always trying to blame somebody.
SUPFEMALE:Out of here.
OTHERFEMALE:Both of you.
SUPFEMALE:Momma.
LEADFEMALE:Just out of the kitchen.
OTHERFEMALE:Out.
LEADFEMALE:He did it.
OTHERMALE:Out.
SUPFEMALE:Out.
LEADMALE:Out.
LEADFEMALE: Well, it's off to the shelter.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey.
LEADMALE:I think it's wonderful that you're helping the less fortunate on Thanksgiving.
LEADMALE:I guess.
SUPMALE:Did I tell you that Channel Four is sending a camera crew down to cover this? God knows that The Hilary Show could use some publicity.
LEADMALE:There is no limit to your giving, is there, Miss Hilary? Thank you, Geoffrey, that's so sweet.
SUPFEMALE:All set? I'm not going.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADMALE:Carlton, didn't you call down to the shelter and volunteer? I called down and put my name on a volunteer list.
SUPFEMALE:But I'm not physically going down there.
OTHERFEMALE:But don't worry, it'll still look good on my résumé.
LEADFEMALE:Carlton, if you said you were going down to help, you get down there.
LEADMALE:But, Mom, I can't drive through that part of town.
SUPMALE:There are homeless people down there.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, fine.
LEADFEMALE:But before I go, I'm taking the pennies out of my loafers.
LEADMALE:Hey, where they at?  Hey.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my goodness.
LEADMALE:You get prettier every year, sweetie.
SUPFEMALE:It's like looking in a mirror.
SUPFEMALE:Carlton.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry we have to go, but they're expecting us down at the shelter.
LEADMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:We'll see you later.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Bye-bye.
LEADMALE:HATTIE: All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:Hear that, Vy? They're off to help at the shelter.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Isn't she a saint? A regular Mother Teresa.
LEADMALE:How was the trip?
SUPMALE:Oh, well, a little bumpy.
OTHERMALE:Turbulence? No, no, no.
LEADMALE:For five hours straight, Helen never stopped moving.
LEADFEMALE:Well, that's why I've always had a boyfriend.
SUPFEMALE:You know that's right.
SUPFEMALE:Hattie girl, you look younger every time I see you.
SUPMALE:Oh, you're just saying that.
SUPMALE:Oh, but don't feel you have to stop.
LEADMALE: Hi, Aunt Vy.
LEADMALE:Hi, Aunt Helen.
SUPFEMALE:Ashley.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Ashley, sweetie pie.
SUPFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing? I guess you're gonna be rolling up those sleeves and helping us in the kitchen? I can't wait to get elbow deep in them turkey gizzards.
LEADMALE:Honey, you need to get cable.
LEADMALE:Just because I'm a woman, I'm suppose to don an apron on Thanksgiving? I don't think so.
LEADMALE:Well, I guess somebody burned their training bra.
LEADFEMALE:Aunt Helen, you ever heard of traveling light? And that's probably just her makeup.
LEADMALE:Oh, sweetie, is it your back?
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I told you the pressures of that trial were gonna get to you.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you okay, son?
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'll be all right, Momma.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:Now, get that trunk out of here.
LEADMALE:We need this space to cook in.
SUPFEMALE:And I gotta get back to my stuffing.
SUPMALE:Wait, no.
LEADMALE:You made the stuffing last year.
LEADFEMALE:That's because you were sick.
LEADMALE:This is my natural turn.
SUPMALE:Well, wait a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:It's my turn to make it after you.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Now you're guests in my house.
SUPMALE:I'll make the stuffing.
SUPFEMALE:Besides, everybody loves it.
SUPFEMALE:Funny, I don't remember voting.
OTHERMALE:Uh, no offense, you guys but none of you can hold a candle to my stuffing.
LEADFEMALE:That's because it's so dry, it'd go up in flames.
SUPMALE:All I know is, I've been making my stuffing for Philip since he was a boy.
OTHERFEMALE:And he always asks for more.
SUPMALE:Oh, we all know what a picky eater he is.
LEADMALE:Now, Will.
SUPFEMALE:Will.
SUPFEMALE:You grew up on my stuffing.
SUPMALE:Now, you tell everybody who's the best.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, come on, Mom
LEADMALE:Uh-uh-uh! Excuse us.
LEADFEMALE:Son.
SUPFEMALE:Son, come here.
SUPMALE:Let me give you a little piece of advice, huh? Never take sides when women are arguing.
OTHERMALE:You can't win.
SUPFEMALE: Well, Uncle Phil, this is my mom.
LEADFEMALE:I think it'll be all right.
LEADMALE:Look at me, boy.
OTHERFEMALE:Lesson number one, whatever you say is wrong.
LEADFEMALE:We're all family here, Uncle Phil.
SUPMALE:I don't think it's quite that serious.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, Mom, I think that your stuffing is the best in the world.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERMALE:What? Oh, I mean I'm saying At least that's what I thought before I tried Grandma Hattie's herb stuffing.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo! Hey, what is it in there, the rosemary that just drives me crazy? What? Um Well, I mean, nothing compares to Aunt Helen's mushroom and bacon stuffing.
SUPFEMALE:Ain't that right, Uncle Phil? Tsk, tsk, tsk.
LEADMALE:Will? Well, Aunt Viv.
LEADMALE:I mean, when I first tried your apricot stuffing I was like, "Whoo!" Ain't that right, Uncle Phil? Heh.
LEADFEMALE:You gonna leave me hanging out here like this, huh? How about y'all make them all?
OTHERFEMALE:That's a good idea.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, I'm for that.
SUPFEMALE:I guess I'll get to cook this year.
SUPMALE: And you can judge which is best.
LEADMALE: The both of you.
LEADMALE:Oh, my God.
LEADFEMALE:Have you ever seen so many fashion don'ts in one room? Okay, Hill.
OTHERMALE:Look, here's the plan.
OTHERFEMALE:We get in, do our good deed and get out.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, I don't see the camera crew anywhere.
SUPFEMALE:Excuse me.
SUPFEMALE:Could you help me?
LEADFEMALE:The food's over there.
OTHERFEMALE:But I'll save a seat for you.
LEADFEMALE:Beauty is such a curse.
LEADMALE:Relax.
LEADFEMALE:You have to be patient with these people.
LEADFEMALE:Understanding.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.

LEADFEMALE:Manager? Carlton Banks here.
SUPFEMALE:Wow, you're awfully young to have such an important position.
LEADFEMALE:And fit too.
LEADMALE:You work out, don't you? So, Lare, listen.

LEADFEMALE:So if you'd be kind enough to put your John Hancock The film crew called and they said they're gonna be a little delayed.
LEADFEMALE:But in the meantime, Sylvia over there will give you your jobs.
OTHERMALE:Oh, don't be silly.

SUPFEMALE:Just push your little onions right over there.
LEADMALE:You can't make no VIVIAN: Did you move that luggage yet? We'll get it right after this play, Aunt Viv.

SUPMALE:Well, I guess you don't have to be any kind of actress to be a talk-show host.
LEADFEMALE:Great, a critic.
LEADFEMALE:I don't see why you're making me clear dishes.
SUPMALE:You wanna wash?  That's a good one.
LEADMALE:No, I was thinking of something more along the line of hostessing.
LEADFEMALE:I could greet the people as they come in with a smile and hand them their menus and take them to their seats.
LEADMALE:Clear.
LEADFEMALE:I'll split my tips with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Clear.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right?
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
