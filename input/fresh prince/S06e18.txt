SUPFEMALE:Heh-heh.
OTHERMALE:Would you prefer a breast or thigh? Uh! He'll take a wing.
LEADMALE:Reverend, by any chance, did you happen to speak to the choirmaster today? From what I understand, there's some very, very stiff competition for the solo this year.
SUPFEMALE:Well, would he ever ask you for your advice? Well, that's a possibility.
SUPMALE:Would you mind  passing the peas, please?   Could you pass the pork dork? So how are things down at the church?

SUPFEMALE:Look, I haven't spent much time with a woman since Margaret passed.
SUPMALE:I guess I got confused, I lost my way.
OTHERFEMALE:I realize there is no excuse for it, but
SUPMALE:You're right, there is no excuse.
OTHERMALE:Gordon, this is really making me uncomfortable.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, maybe it's best if I just leave.
LEADFEMALE:I think that's a good idea.
OTHERFEMALE: Where's Gordon going? Oh, an emergency came up.
LEADMALE:He told me to say goodbye to everybody.
SUPFEMALE:Let's go have a nice dinner.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right? Yes, honey, I'm all right now.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy, you know how you told me that Harry's black now because rabbits change colors for Easter? Isn't there a little more to that story? Well, yes.
LEADMALE:Uh Nicky, you remember in The Lion King when Mufasa? Daddy, did you sit on Harry?
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:But But
LEADMALE:That's okay, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Death is a natural part of life.
OTHERFEMALE:But what a way to go.
SUPFEMALE:And as it says in Matthew: "If a man has 100 sheep and one strays does he not leave the 99 on the mountain to search for the stray one?"
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:"And if he finds it, he is happy over finding that one than over the 99 that did not stray.
LEADMALE:" MAN 1: Glory.
LEADMALE:Tell the truth now, pastor.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you see, the truth is I am one of the flock.
LEADFEMALE:And every now and then I too must ask for forgiveness, as we all do.
