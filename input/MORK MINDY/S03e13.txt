LEADMALE:I love my new job.
LEADMALE:I just wish the station would give me better assignments.
SUPMALE:All I've been covering lately are grocery store openings and flower exhibits and that dumb dog show this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, are you kidding? Those dogs are great little performers.
LEADMALE:I wonder why that guy got mad when I tried to wind up his toy poodle.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hi, it's me.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, hi.
LEADFEMALE:I saw you come in.
SUPFEMALE:You know how I hate to bother you two, but I'm having a very special lady over tomorrow night, Lorraine Sue Ruttenberg, and I'd like to borrow a few record albums.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, is this someone important? - Hopefully.
LEADMALE:I'm bringing her all the way from Phoenix at enormous expense.
SUPMALE:Do you realise how much bus fare is these days? Well, I'll get you the record albums.
LEADFEMALE:You're probably looking to set the proper mood, eh? No, I'm looking for cheap thrills.
SUPMALE:Oh, here's one of my favourites: Or a bat can go: I was thinking more along the lines of Perry Como.
SUPFEMALE:All I have is his Christmas album.
LEADMALE:Perfect.
LEADMALE:''Little Drummer Boy'' works quicker than liquor.
SUPMALE:Well, good luck, Bick, and thanks for coming by.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, it's really-- Mork, if you don't mind, I'd like to take my hand back home with me.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Mork.
LEADMALE:Gee, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley, it's too bad you have to run.
LEADMALE:I don't think so.
OTHERMALE:That boy's a little thin from the neck up.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Mork? Mork? Oh, no, now, what am I gonna do? Mork? Bye, Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what happened to you? You just spaced out.
SUPMALE:I'm sorry, Mind, I got a call from Orson.
LEADMALE:I had to put my body on hold.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, Mind, you'll never guess what.
LEADMALE:- I never have yet.
OTHERFEMALE:You'll never guess who's gonna grace us with his magnificent presence.
LEADFEMALE:- Who? - Xerko.
OTHERFEMALE:Xerko.
SUPMALE:One of the Marx brothers? No, no, Mind.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's my hero, my idol.
LEADFEMALE:He's the greatest Orkan that's ever lived.
LEADFEMALE:He's coming here, Mind, he's coming here.
LEADFEMALE:Why would this Xerox wanna come here? No, no, his name is Xerko, Mind, and there's no duplicating him.
SUPMALE:I don't know why he wants to come here.
LEADFEMALE:Orson didn't tell me, I guess he wanted to make it a surprise.
OTHERFEMALE:Isn't it wonderful, though? Oh, boy, he's gonna love our little nest.
SUPMALE:It's so warm and wonderful.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've gotta clean up this pigsty.
LEADMALE:It's filthy.
SUPFEMALE:Xerko? Oh, Mork, nice to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:It's been bleams, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, you remembered my insignificant, dirt ball name.
OTHERFEMALE:Why of course, Mork.
LEADMALE:My memory is impeccable.
OTHERMALE:Oh, and the rest of us are merely peccable, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sir, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it's been so long, sir.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna have to have this hand bronzed.
LEADMALE:Sir, sir, how was your journey? It was delightful, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, I came via Air Ork's H-28 prototype beam.
LEADMALE:Oh, travelling by beam.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, who thought of that? Well, actually, Mork, I did.
LEADFEMALE:What will I think of next? Oh, what a guy.
LEADMALE:I mean-- Why are you here? Orson didn't tell me.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, did I win spend-a-day-with-a-hero contest? No, no, but we'll have plenty of time to talk about my mission later.
LEADMALE:Mork, I admire very much, admire very much what you've done with this environment.
LEADMALE:Oh, you admire something of mine, sir? You'll find that I admire many things of yours.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see you have an Orkan landscape.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, it's a Van Yuch.
LEADMALE:I have a good ear for paintings.
LEADMALE:How nice.
LEADFEMALE:I have the original, you know.
LEADFEMALE:Van Yuch himself is hanging in my house.
LEADFEMALE:I hope somebody remembers to feed him while I'm gone.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I wanna talk about your Earth reports.
LEADFEMALE:Now, they've become so colourful that Earth is being considered an up-and-coming planet on the move.
LEADMALE:We broke the top 40? - I mean, we're 1 6 with a bullet? - That's right.
OTHERFEMALE:But it seems that the Earth people are so hungry for leadership.
LEADFEMALE:They need someone to guide them into the next century.
LEADMALE:And I know just the Orkan who can do it.
LEADMALE:Thank you, sir, I'd better go hop in the shower.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:Mork, silly misguided Mork.
OTHERMALE:I was referring, of course, to myself.
LEADMALE:Twinkle of eye, sparkle of teeth.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, me, vacuous of head.
OTHERFEMALE:I should have known better.
OTHERMALE:I mean, you're the best there is in the whole universe.
LEADFEMALE:I ought to know, I'm a Xerko groupie.
OTHERMALE:See? Well, remind me to send you a Xerko lunchbox.
SUPMALE:Sir, I mean, I can't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:Why am I so lucky? Because, Mork, you are a key person in my plan for success.
LEADFEMALE:Plan? What's your plan, sir, please? What's the plan--? Mork, you are so inquisitive.
LEADMALE:Now, that's what sets us apart.
LEADFEMALE:You ask and I know.
SUPFEMALE:But you must be patient, my friend.
LEADMALE:This also involves your Earthling, Mindy, as well.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to explain it to the two of you when you're together.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:I mean, once again, you're right, Your Everything.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I can wait just till morning, you know, that's: Morning already? Come, sir, let's go, come here.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait.
LEADFEMALE:Not necessary.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sir, even though Mindy's asleep, she's gonna be thrilled to meet you.
LEADMALE:Well, who can blame her? Mind, wake up and come out and be filled with awe.
LEADFEMALE:I hope she's wearing her bunny slippers, they're so cute.
SUPFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:- I thought you were asleep.
OTHERMALE:Are you kidding? How could I sleep knowing I'm gonna have a guest from another galaxy? Is he here yet? Oh, I don't know, really, Mind, I really don't.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, meet Xerko.
LEADFEMALE:See him, feel him, touch him.
LEADFEMALE:Well, hello.
SUPMALE:Hello, Mindy.
LEADMALE:This is indeed a pleasure.
OTHERFEMALE:I've heard so much about you through Mork's reports to Orson.
SUPMALE:I must say you're even more lovely.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, well, thank you.
SUPMALE:Isn't he wonderful, Mind? Isn't he everything you ever dreamed of, especially compared to worm sweat like me? Welcome to Earth, or na-no, na-no, or whatever I'm supposed to say.
LEADMALE:Say what you feel.
SUPFEMALE:Are you sure you're an Orkan? Of course I am, but I've studied your ways and I find Earth a fascinating planet.
LEADFEMALE:Very fascinating.
LEADFEMALE:And you help make it that way.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, shucks and wazoo.
LEADFEMALE:Where have I heard that before? Mind, he's got a wonderful surprise to tell us.
SUPMALE:He had to tell us when we're together.
LEADMALE:- What's that surprise, Xerko? - I want your job.
SUPMALE:Oh, shucks.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, what--? He wants my job.
LEADMALE:What do you mean, you want his job? Well, after a mere formality, the ancient duel of the Hollitacker, I will become Ork's new observer here on Earth.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, you have everything.
LEADMALE:Why do you want what I have? Your reports are becoming too popular and I can't have that.
SUPMALE:Unless, of course, I'm giving them.
SUPFEMALE:It would be a giant step in my illustrious career.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm what he wants to step in.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind, I don't have any chance against Xerko the Godlike.
LEADMALE:You two will be very happy together.
LEADFEMALE:Really, you really will.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you can't just give up.
OTHERMALE:Yup, sure can.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going outside to re-carve that heart that's out on the tree outside to say: ''Xerko and Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:'' Goodbye.
SUPMALE:Oh, by the way, she likes her bologna sundaes without bologna.
SUPFEMALE:Dad, I thought I could handle this myself, but-- You better sit down.
LEADMALE:Another Orkan has come to replace Mork and live with me.
LEADMALE:I better sit down.
LEADMALE:Are you saying there's another Orkan in this house right now? Yeah, his name is Xerko.
SUPMALE:And he and Mork are gonna have some kind of game called a Holliquacker or Tacker.
LEADMALE:I don't know what it is.
LEADMALE:What's that? Well, it's when one Orkan challenges another for his job.
OTHERMALE:He's really trying to take over and I don't know what to do about it.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, don't worry.
LEADMALE:I'll have a talk with this Xerko.
LEADFEMALE:It isn't that easy.
SUPMALE:He's been here less than a day and he's already tuned up my Jeep, made all his own Earth clothes and scraped the bugs out of my ceiling lights.
OTHERMALE:Well, I don't care what he's done.
SUPMALE:He just can't come barging into other people's planets and take over.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, little Bebo, we'll have tickle time again tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Come on, little fellow.
OTHERMALE:Now, listen, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Zero.
SUPMALE:Oh, you mean Xerko.
LEADMALE:You must be Mindy's biological father.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:McConnell? It's a pleasure to meet you.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:But I really think we should have a talk.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Shall we all sit down? Please.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, may I say how nice it is to see people dressing for dinner again.
LEADMALE:He's dressed that way because he's the conductor for the Boulder Symphony Orchestra.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what an honour.
LEADMALE:May I ask you, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:McConnell, do you enjoy Stravinsky? Stravinsky? How do you know about Stravinsky? Oh, we monitor all Earth broadcasts.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I thought that Stravinsky reached his zenith during ''Rites of Spring'', until, of course, I heard his ''Firebird Suite''.
LEADMALE:Do you agree? You know-- You know, you're right.
SUPMALE:You must have quite a musical background.
SUPMALE:Well, actually, I composed the Ork national anthem.
LEADFEMALE:I wrote the song that made my whole world sing.
SUPFEMALE:Really? That's quite impressive.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, Mr.
LEADMALE:McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:- Call me Fred.
LEADFEMALE:- Why, I'd like that.
SUPFEMALE:I'd also like to see you conduct sometime.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, as a matter of fact, I have a performance in less than an hour and I'm late.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, can I come along with you, Fred? - Of course.
OTHERMALE:You'd enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:Tonight we're doing Schubert's ''Unfinished Symphony''.
LEADMALE:Marvellous.
SUPMALE:Maybe I can finished it for him.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, remember Mork? Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, now-- Now, Xerko-- - Here's your coat, Fred.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Nice coat.
SUPMALE:You don't happen to have the pattern, do you? And now, really, now listen, you just can't come down to Earth and move in like this.
SUPMALE:Now, please, I understand your concern, but Mork's been here for a couple of years and you've had a chance to grow attached to him.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure, if given time, you'll grow attached to me too.
SUPMALE:- Well, you like Stravinsky.
SUPMALE:- Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, honey, Xerko seems like a civilised being.
SUPFEMALE:I'm sure that I can reason with him.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, honey.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye.
LEADMALE:Remember, the Hollitacker's at midnight.
LEADMALE:I want you there when Mork concedes, and wear something tight.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mork isn't gonna concede if I have anything to do with it.
LEADMALE:He might not believe in himself, but I believe in Mork.
LEADMALE:I love it when you're angry.
LEADMALE:Who said you had to go to Disneyland to have fun on Earth? You're an E-ticket.
LEADMALE:Mork, stop that packing.
LEADMALE:You're not a quitter.
LEADMALE:Look, I understand how you feel.
OTHERMALE:When I was a little girl, there was this kid in school who was always the best at everything.
OTHERFEMALE:She was class president and cafeteria monitor and teacher's pet.
OTHERFEMALE:The one thing I was really good at in school was spelling.
SUPFEMALE:But she was better.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe we should get her to fight the Hollitacker, Mind.
LEADMALE:Every year at the school spelling bee, there were only just two of us left on the stage, her and me.
SUPFEMALE:And every year, she was always the last one standing on that stage.
SUPFEMALE:But I kept trying, until one time it was just down between the two of us, and the word was hors d'oeuvres.
LEADMALE:And she blew it.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, it was wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:You mean, you beat her? You won? Yeah.
LEADMALE:And I still have the ribbon to prove it.
LEADFEMALE:See, you can do it if you try.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you gonna know otherwise? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah, you're right, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- You really think I have a chance? - Sure, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:If you want something, you'll find a way to get it.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:- I know you can do it.
SUPMALE:Yeah, yeah.
SUPMALE:Yeah, I can do it.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Whatever happened to that girl, Mind? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I kind of lost track of her after she won the Nobel Prize.
SUPFEMALE:Let the Hollitacker begin.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, come down and be defeated.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, you look absolutely beautiful.
OTHERFEMALE:After I win, I will present you with the fruits of my victory, Mork's ears.
LEADMALE:Ears? Well, Mork told me this was a non-violent contest.
LEADMALE:Oh, it is.
LEADFEMALE:Orkan ears screw off.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, do I take your continued absence to mean a forfeit? Never.
LEADFEMALE:I'm just waiting till my knees to stop knocking.
SUPFEMALE:Mork runs from no man.
OTHERMALE:And tonight, I'm gonna try-- Try to do my best.
LEADFEMALE:Well, maybe it's a good night to do my laundry, Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Remember, no matter what happens, you're a winner to me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, thank you, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I brought the ribbon that I won at the spelling bee.
OTHERMALE:I want you to wear it to remind you of a little girl who wouldn't give up.
LEADMALE:- Oh, thank you, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Okay? There you go.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, Mind.
SUPMALE:Pardon me.
OTHERFEMALE:- I'll try even though it does clash.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:- Give him hell.
LEADMALE:- All right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:The choice of weapons goes to the challenger.
OTHERFEMALE:And I choose the Swords of Cletus.
SUPFEMALE:I was hoping he'd opt for spatulas, Mind.
LEADMALE:Take your pick.
SUPMALE:Eenie, meenie, minie, Cletus, hope he doesn't try to cheat us.
LEADMALE:This one.
OTHERMALE:But I don't see anything.
SUPFEMALE:Of course not.
SUPFEMALE:The Swords of Cletus are invisible.
LEADMALE:Observe.
LEADMALE:Oh, I get the point.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's nothing.
OTHERMALE:You see that fly up there? Yeah, but it's still alive.
LEADMALE:Yes, but wait till he tries to land.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:All right, we all know the rules here, don't we? First man to push his opponent back through the goals wins the Hollitacker.
LEADMALE:Now, I want a clean fight here.
LEADFEMALE:And cross blades and may the second-best Orkan win.
SUPFEMALE:Good luck, Mork.
LEADMALE:You can do it.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Not now, not now.
OTHERMALE:Begin.
LEADFEMALE:Don't fall in.
LEADFEMALE:It always looked easier from the stands, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:Time out.
SUPMALE:- Time in.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, time in? A little closer.
OTHERMALE:Mind, your help, please.
LEADFEMALE:If you find the sword, you'll recognise it.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the only one you can't see.
SUPFEMALE:My furniture.
LEADMALE:It's all right, my dear.
LEADFEMALE:When I move in, I'll redecorate.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:It's for you, Mind.
OTHERMALE:We've been cut off.
LEADMALE:- Mind.
LEADMALE:- Oh, I think I've found it.
SUPMALE:Can you try to hurry up, Mind? No pressure.
SUPFEMALE:One, two, three.
SUPMALE:- Here, catch.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind.
LEADMALE:Pick on me when I'm down, huh? Well, I'm not anymore.
LEADFEMALE:I'm coming.
OTHERFEMALE:Make way, Mind.
LEADMALE:Don't make them like they used to.
LEADFEMALE:- Quick, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Not now, my sweet, have patience.
LEADMALE:What's going on in there? Ixnay on the ollitackerhay.
LEADMALE:What have you got against love? Lorraine Sue's heart was beating faster than the little drummer boy's stick and you have to start playing hide and go kinky.
SUPFEMALE:And what's the situation now? Lorraine Sue is thumbing her way back to Phoenix and I'm left with my motor racing and no place to park.
LEADMALE:Oh, and by the way, don't bother trying to explain this.
SUPMALE:I'm sure I'll be filled in by the vice squad later.
SUPMALE:All right, Mork, it's been fun, but all good things must come to an end.
SUPFEMALE:Earth and Mindy are now mine.
LEADFEMALE:Eat garlic.
LEADMALE:- Please, Mork.
LEADMALE:- You've got it in for you.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADMALE:You've gone too far now.
LEADFEMALE:You've cut Mindy's ribbon.
LEADFEMALE:And that, this is for Mindy.
LEADMALE:That's for the couch, that's for the fly, that's for the candle and this is for-- I hope you didn't take anything I said seriously.
SUPFEMALE:Heat of the battle and all that rot.
LEADMALE:All right, Mork.
LEADMALE:Enough is enough.
SUPMALE:It's time to draw this to a close.
LEADMALE:Not a bad little dueller.
LEADMALE:Not a bad little dancer.
SUPMALE:Goodbye, Mork.
LEADMALE:You did it.
LEADFEMALE:You won.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:You won.
LEADMALE:I didn't win.
LEADFEMALE:It was your ribbon that really helped.
LEADMALE:Congratulations.
LEADMALE:You fought valiantly.
LEADFEMALE:I've never lost anything before.
SUPFEMALE:I just can't imagine being beaten by Mork.
LEADMALE:Well, I think you've learned a good lesson.
LEADMALE:On Earth, it's called humility.
LEADMALE:Humility.
LEADMALE:Yes, strange new stirrings within me.
LEADMALE:I'm beginning to feel it.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, thanks to you, Mork, I have acquired humility.
LEADMALE:Now, I have everything.
SUPMALE:I'll be the perfect leader for the next planet I decide to grace with my presence.
SUPMALE:Well, goodbye.
SUPMALE:Beam me up, Scotty.
LEADFEMALE:Farewell, my flawed leader.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mork, I sure am proud of you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know something, Mind, me too.
LEADMALE:- Sorry the house is kind of torn apart.
SUPMALE:- Yeah.
SUPMALE:Well, I guess the most important thing is that you're back together again.
SUPFEMALE:The very most important thing is that we're back together again, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you never told me that Orkan ears unscrew.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, I'm afraid to ask what else comes off.
LEADMALE:You got me, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I've tried everything.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Your Grand-Central-Stationness.
SUPFEMALE:- Are you still there, Mork? - Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:l heard X erko challenged you to a Hollitacker.
LEADMALE:He did, sir.
SUPMALE:But I came, I saw, I conquered.
SUPMALE:What? What? All right, sir, actually, I quivered, I ran, I squeaked by.
OTHERMALE:Jizzix the Greek gave odds that you wouldn't even show up.
LEADFEMALE:- I know that, sir.
LEADMALE:- l'm out big bucks, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Me too, sir.
SUPMALE:I lost 20 myself.
LEADFEMALE:But I found something even more valuable, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I learned that if you bet against yourself, you always lose.
SUPMALE:A little proverb from Monty Hall.
LEADMALE:But you wound up winning, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Doesn't that feel good? Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:But what makes me feel better is the fact that I tried.
LEADMALE:You see, it's not what's in front of you that blocks your way, it's what's inside of you that holds you back.
LEADMALE:The problem with you is what's inside of you is what's in front of you.
LEADMALE:A little shot for betting against me.
LEADMALE:Until next week, Your Green-Felt-Jungleness.
LEADFEMALE:
