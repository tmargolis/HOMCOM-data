LEADMALE:Can I talk to you guys about something personal? You got a tattoo.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No, it's about Mork.
LEADMALE:Is he still lighting a candle every day in memory of Edith Bunker? Yes, but that's not the problem.
OTHERMALE:No, the problem is I met this guy through work and he asked me out to dinner and I don't know whether I should go or not.
LEADMALE:Well, what's the problem? You and Mork are just good friends.
SUPFEMALE:Well, yeah, we are, but we really haven't dated anyone in the last year.
LEADMALE:And it just kind of worked out that way.
LEADMALE:Well, then, live, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Grow, expand your soul.
LEADFEMALE:Humanity is the palette from which you colour your relationships.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I mean if you go out and meet new people, it can enrich and ennoble your attitudes towards each other.
LEADMALE:In other words, Mindy, fool around.
SUPFEMALE:You know, Glenda may be right.
SUPFEMALE:Meeting new people could be a lot of fun.
OTHERFEMALE:- For both you and Mork.
SUPMALE:- Really? - Yeah.
SUPMALE:- What good advice.
OTHERFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Now, you tell Mork.
LEADMALE:No, it's true.
SUPMALE:Mork should meet more people.
LEADMALE:I mean, after all, that's why he came to this planet.
LEADFEMALE:Place.
SUPMALE:Why he came to this place.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gosh.
LEADMALE:Well, I hate to eat and run, but I have to burn off this cake.
LEADMALE:Come on, Jeanie.
LEADMALE:Oh, enjoy it, lips, before it winds up on hips.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, bye-bye.
LEADMALE:- Bye.
LEADMALE:Listen, if you end up going out with this guy, why don't you see if maybe he has a friend, you know, brother or cousin, nephew, uncle, grandfather? Bye.
LEADMALE:Mork, can I talk to you for a minute? Oh, sure, Mind, here I come.
OTHERMALE:Catch me.
OTHERMALE:Now I know who not to call in case of a fire.
LEADMALE:Here I am, Mind, preparing early for our usual Saturday evening television marathon.
LEADMALE:We're gonna boogie till the test pattern.
LEADFEMALE:Here we are.
SUPMALE:One regulation snuggle sack.
SUPMALE:My regulation snuggle sack.
LEADMALE:Also, hold on here.
LEADFEMALE:And the best surprise of all, a little bag of popcorn.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
SUPMALE:- Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:How would you feel if I told you I wasn't gonna watch television with you tonight? I'd say that Mork and Mindy have reached a new level of intimacy.
SUPMALE:I'll go upstairs, put on my see-through suspenders and we'll snap till dawn.
LEADMALE:No, what I mean is I'm not gonna be here tonight.
SUPMALE:- I have a date.
LEADMALE:- You? Yeah, me.
LEADFEMALE:No, I've been thinking about it and I think it'd be healthy for us to go out and meet other people.
LEADMALE:Well, Mind, have I stopped you from meeting other people? Well, no, but I haven't exactly helped you meet them, either.
LEADMALE:And I've been so busy trying to graduate from college and trying to find a job that we've sort of closed ourselves off in a cocoon.
SUPFEMALE:That's crazy, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I came to Earth to observe people.
OTHERFEMALE:You should be able to observe people too.
LEADMALE:Oh, really? Oh, I'm so glad you feel that way.
SUPFEMALE:To tell you the truth, I was nervous about bringing the whole thing up.
SUPMALE:You kidding? This conversation has changed my life.
SUPMALE:I'm going out right now and break new ground, meet new people.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna get out there right now, Mind-- There's somebody right now.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you, fella.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you in the hardhat, why don't you come on up tonight? I've got an empty snuggle sack.
SUPMALE:It's open.
LEADMALE:- Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Remo.
LEADMALE:Here's the pizza you ordered.
SUPMALE:It's your usual.
LEADMALE:Everything but tomato and cheese.
LEADMALE:Where's Mindy? Oh, she's out with some guy having her horizons expanded.
LEADMALE:- She's got a date? - Yes.
LEADMALE:She says with these experiences, she'll enrich her life, and we'll have something to share in our golden years.
LEADMALE:- You bought that? - Yeah, and the watch too.
LEADMALE:- Look, you're a single guy, all right? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:This is Saturday night.
LEADFEMALE:Get out the little black book.
LEADMALE:Oh, little black book.
LEADFEMALE:You mean Roots? No, that address book.
LEADMALE:Idiot moi.
LEADFEMALE:Why, look at this.
SUPMALE:You got a chick for every night of the week.
SUPMALE:''Lola, Stephanie, Marcy.
SUPFEMALE:'' - Give them a call.
OTHERMALE:- I can't.
LEADMALE:They're asleep right now.
LEADMALE:They're kids from the day-care centre.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you must know some women with their permanent teeth.
LEADMALE:Let's think.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, think of someone.
SUPMALE:Anyone, just give me a name.
LEADMALE:All right, well, there's your sister Jeanie.
LEADMALE:- I don't think so.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, yeah.
LEADMALE:Glenda Faye.
OTHERMALE:Glenda Faye, that's perfect.
LEADFEMALE:She's single.
SUPMALE:She lives in one of those singles complexes.
LEADMALE:Give her a call.
LEADMALE:- Just relax, all right? - Okay.
SUPMALE:- Now just-- - What do I say to her? Say, ''What are you doing tonight, Glenda?'' And whatever you do, don't sound hard up or lonely.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:It's rang two times.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello? Glenda? Hi, it's me, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:That's all, it's just Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, hi.
SUPFEMALE:What am I doing? Well, whatever it is, I'm not hard up or lonely.
SUPFEMALE:Well, actually, right now I'm having a party with all of my friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, what are you doing? You're having a Japanese dinner party? That's wonderful.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure, I can come.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:Glenda, I have one question.
LEADMALE:When you eat sushi, do you eat with the fingers or do you eat the fingers separately? Come in.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi, Morky san.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hayakawa, Glenda Faye.
OTHERMALE:- These flowers are for you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, how sweet.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, they're not, I tasted them.
LEADMALE:You are such a kidder.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, how about a little sake? Oh, make it two.
SUPMALE:One for each footy.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:Mork, I'd like you to meet all my friends.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thus begins my growth experience.
OTHERMALE:Hey, everybody, this is Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:That's that.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, all.
LEADFEMALE:I have a lot to share with Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:- Good night.
SUPMALE:- Get back here, sillikins.
SUPFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:- Stay a while and just mingle a little.
LEADFEMALE:- Mingle? - Mingle.
LEADMALE:- You mean, like: Would you like to mingle? Sure, I'll try anything once.
SUPMALE:Are those bell-bottoms? Why? Are my cuffs ringing? Excuse me, I think we have to stop seeing each other.
SUPFEMALE:Party chatter, party chatter, party chatter.
LEADFEMALE:- Excuse me, are you on something? - Yes, this lovely plush pile carpet.
LEADMALE:I'll go over here and motivate.
LEADMALE:I wonder if I have flower breath.
OTHERMALE:Mork, are you having a nice time? I don't think your friends like me.
LEADMALE:I feel kind of out of place.
SUPMALE:I feel kind of like Nancy Reagan at a soul-food parlour.
LEADMALE:Just kind of loosen up a little.
LEADMALE:Tell a joke.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Okay, everybody, Mork is going to tell a joke.
SUPFEMALE:- He is such a funny man.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Mork.
LEADMALE:- I only know one joke, Glen.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, great, tell it.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, Glenda, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:No pressure.
LEADMALE:Well, you see, these two Venusians walk into a bar.
LEADFEMALE:And one Venusian says No, don't spoil it, you know the ending.
LEADMALE:One Venusian says: And the other Venusian says: And then the bartender says: ''I can't even drink the water.
SUPMALE:'' Oh, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Glenda, can I go sit in the other room with the coats? Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:It's all right, I can talk to a mink.
OTHERFEMALE:It'll be okay.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's really hard meeting new people for the first time.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, hardly anybody fits in right away.
LEADFEMALE:Just do me a little favour and stay for a little while longer.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Glenda, I feel like a fur ball in the throat of life.
SUPMALE:There's this great guy coming over for dinner tonight and I want you to meet him.
OTHERMALE:Everybody loves him.
LEADFEMALE:He's the life of the party, a regular Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Fun.
LEADFEMALE:- You could really learn a lot from him.
LEADFEMALE:- He's more fun than Mister Rogers? Beni Hana.
OTHERFEMALE:Goldfish sushi.
OTHERMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:This is Todd Norman Taylor.
LEADMALE:My friends call me TNT because I'm a dynamite kind of guy.
LEADFEMALE:Go to it, TNT.
OTHERFEMALE:Relieve the tensions of the '80s.
LEADMALE:You're a crazy lady, you know? She's a crazy lady.
SUPMALE:- Hi, I'm Pepper.
OTHERFEMALE:- Whoa, what's shaking, Pepper? Let's sit and talk travel.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I've been to all 27 Club Meds.
LEADMALE:What a week that was.
LEADMALE:Talking travel with him.
LEADMALE:If they only knew where I came from.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi, handsome.
SUPMALE:- Oh, what's your name? - Sheri.
LEADMALE:- Sheri? Oh, what's cooking, Sheri? Would you hold it against me if I told you you had a great body? I'm on a roll.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me, Mr.
LEADMALE:Fun.
LEADMALE:May I talk to you? What the matter, guy? Run out of wallflower seeds? Excuse me, ladies.
LEADMALE:Hey, guy, lighten up.
LEADFEMALE:Party, party.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, I'm just a I'm a loser.
LEADFEMALE:I'm a social misfit.
LEADMALE:You forgot ''dud.
OTHERMALE:'' Hey, I understand.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been washed up on Shy Beach before.
SUPFEMALE:I couldn't surf, I couldn't ski.
SUPMALE:I couldn't even ride a mechanical bull.
SUPMALE:Let's face it, I was a pretty shallow guy.
LEADMALE:What'd you do? Put my act together.
LEADFEMALE:Props, little wardrobe, but most important of all, style.
LEADFEMALE:What's style? - You see the way you're dressed? - Well, yes.
LEADFEMALE:That's not it.
OTHERMALE:Tell you what, guy.
LEADFEMALE:You stick with the master, and in no time, I'll make you just like me from top to bottom.
SUPMALE:I guess I got a good head start because my bottom looks like your top.
LEADMALE:So how's Mork been lately? Well, I haven't seen much of Mork lately.
LEADMALE:Seems I've unleashed a singles monster on Boulder.
SUPMALE:I thought that's kind of what you wanted.
SUPMALE:You're seeing new people, Mork's seeing new people.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but we sure aren't seeing much of each other.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I mean, come on, Mindy, he can't be busy every single minute.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Wait a minute, I wanna show you something.
LEADMALE:- Wait till you see this.
SUPMALE:- What is it? - Monday.
SUPMALE:- Monday.
LEADFEMALE:''Eight-twenty a.
OTHERMALE:m.
OTHERMALE:, breakfast.
SUPMALE:Ten-forty-eight a.
OTHERFEMALE:m.
SUPMALE:, comparative lip-gloss tasting.
OTHERMALE:Eleven-oh-six a.
LEADMALE:m.
LEADMALE:, co-ed mud wrestling.
LEADFEMALE:'' My goodness, he is busy every minute.
OTHERMALE:Oh, not again.
SUPMALE:Hello.
SUPMALE:No, Nikki Sue, Mork isn't here right now.
LEADMALE:He's at the floating Jacuzzi backgammon tournament.
SUPFEMALE:What? No, no, no, the finals are at 6:34.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, bye.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, Mindy.
LEADMALE:- Well, maybe it's good for Mork.
SUPMALE:I mean, he's getting out, he's meeting people.
SUPFEMALE:- So why am I so bugged? - Because maybe you feel left out? Maybe I feel left out.
OTHERMALE:According to this, Mork is gonna be at Glenda's party tonight.
OTHERFEMALE:It starts at 8:41 .
LEADMALE:Why don't you meet him over there? You know, kind of check out the situation.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
OTHERMALE:I was invited too, along with the rest of Boulder.
LEADMALE:I wasn't really planning on going.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Now, you have got to be just a little bit curious to see old Mork in action, huh? Oh, yeah, I am.
LEADMALE:But if I go to that party and he says to me, ''Hi there, chicky baby, what's your sign?'' I'm gonna kick him in the big dipper.
SUPMALE:Anybody here? Glenda? Mork? Mind.
SUPMALE:How are you? Star-spangled surprise and amber waves of joy.
SUPMALE:Hollywood kiss.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, lovely.
LEADMALE:- What an interesting party.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes.
OTHERMALE:- You having fun? - Oh, for sure, for sure.
SUPFEMALE:Does Norman Lear make great jets? Oh, Mindy, I'm so glad you could make it.
LEADMALE:Let me get you a drink.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you'd like to try the specialty of the house? Morkaritas? - Morkaritas? - Well, they're named after me, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:It's tequila and balogna.
LEADMALE:Mustard around the rim is optional.
SUPMALE:I think I'll just have a meatless drink.
SUPMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry, but I've gotta go mix and mingle now to look for that deep relationship like you wanted me to.
LEADFEMALE:We'll catch you later when the energy's right.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, how are you? Have you ever had deep feelings about velour? Hey, Hit Man, huddle time.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, we'll do lunch one day.
LEADFEMALE:We'll bag it and call each other.
LEADMALE:I've told you the secrets of the opposite gender.
LEADMALE:Now's the time to rub them tender.
LEADMALE:- We bad, we bad.
LEADFEMALE:- We bad, we bad.
LEADMALE:- Hit Man? - He's a hit with all the ladies.
SUPMALE:Maybe I will have a Morkarita.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, you're not upset with me because I introduced Mork to all my friends, are you? Oh, no, of course not.
SUPMALE:Well, look at him.
LEADMALE:He's having such a good time.
LEADFEMALE:You know, chicky-boo, my sixth sense tells me that we've met in a previous life.
LEADMALE:You were Cleopatra and I was Richard Burton.
SUPFEMALE:You know, chicklet, I have seven cents that says we met, like, in a previous life.
LEADMALE:And you were Lady Godiva and I was Mister Ed.
LEADFEMALE:One day we'll go to Nautilus Centre and hold our breath.
OTHERMALE:Hey, baby, how'd you like to go up to my place for a nightcap? Hey, sweetheart, how'd you like to go over to my place for a night crawler? - I live at your place.
LEADMALE:- Oh, wow, Xanadu.
OTHERMALE:I've got a live one.
SUPFEMALE:We bad.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Why do I feel like I should be wearing abutton? Hi, I couldn't help overhearing because I was listening, but are you and the Hit Man living together? Oh, yeah, but it's not what you think.
SUPMALE:Oh, you'll have to tell me.
LEADMALE:I'm not into thinking.
OTHERMALE:You see, he and I are just friends.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, friends.
LEADMALE:In that case, Hit Man? I think she likes me, Mind.
LEADMALE:Isn't she nice? For sure, for sure.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't she? Isn't she really gnarly? You know, Mork, maybe it's time I got into the swing of things.
LEADFEMALE:Do you mind if I mix with your friends? - Oh, sure, Mind, go for it.
SUPFEMALE:- Will you hold this? Thanks.
SUPMALE:Hey, TNT, wanna have a megaton of fun? Hey, baby, I'm here for the taking.
SUPMALE:You get the Jell-O, I'll bring the birdcage.
LEADMALE:Mind, what are you doing? Just trying to mix and mingle because I'm single.
SUPFEMALE:- Party's moving to my place.
SUPFEMALE:- Party's at Pepper's.
LEADFEMALE:Wouldn't you like to be at Pepper's too? Hey.
LEADMALE:Come on, foxy.
OTHERMALE:Jump on the Silver Streak to singledom.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:You can be the caboose if you can get loose.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think we're on the same track, jack.
OTHERMALE:After this commercial message, we'll be back with Night Owl Theatre.
LEADMALE:Hey, crazy lady.
LEADMALE:Hey, Hit Man, you're home early.
LEADFEMALE:It's only 4:1 5.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Mind, you wanna know why I came home from roaming? You had to change for the predawn donut dunk.
LEADMALE:No, I saw that you left the party and I came to bring you back.
OTHERMALE:- Why did you leave, Mind? - I wasn't in the mood for a big party.
LEADMALE:But it looks like you're having a good time with all your new friends, especially that girl Pepper.
SUPMALE:Pepper? - Yeah, the girl who kissed you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, a lot of girls kissed me, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:I guess they're just load-testing their lips.
SUPFEMALE:This is the first time we've sat together on this couch in over a week.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it feels pretty good.
SUPMALE:Mork, I'm glad you found a way of life you can really enjoy.
LEADFEMALE:Are you happy? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, it makes me happy to make you happy.
LEADFEMALE:And you wanted me to meet new people.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but not as a career.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I thought making new friends would help us grow together, not grow apart.
LEADMALE:Yeah, Mind, I really missed you.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna be your cuddly little caterpillar, not somebody's social butterfly.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, that's so nice.
SUPMALE:Well, I'd rather be your cuddly caterpillar too.
SUPMALE:I realised that the first time I walked in Glenda Faye's building.
LEADMALE:You know, I like making new friends, but you're my best friend.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, I needed to hear that.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah, me too.
LEADFEMALE:You know what's really nice? It's nice having you talking to me rather than at me.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's really great to make new friends, but don't forget who you are in the meantime.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, I promise.
LEADMALE:I'll just be my little old bozo self.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, one thing.
OTHERFEMALE:Can I keep the new friends I made? - Sure, they're fun.
LEADMALE:- Oh, really? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:- You hear that? She likes you.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, O jumbo jet setter.
LEADMALE:- Please, Mork, no fat jokes tonight.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
LEADMALE:Beebs is my best audience, sir.
LEADMALE:He's kind of like my George Jessel.
SUPFEMALE:What a lovely thing this ball of fur can be.
LEADFEMALE:- y our report, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:This week I've been running with Earthlings who have no mates, sir.
LEADFEMALE:- We like to call them ''singles.
LEADFEMALE:'' - y ou mean you left your Earthling? Oh, sir, bite your tongue, hush your puppies.
OTHERFEMALE:No, sir, actually, we just met other Earthlings, well, to enrich our own relationship, sir, and now, sir, we're closer than ever, if you know what I mean.
OTHERMALE:lnteresting concept, Mork.
LEADMALE:On Earth, you can be separate and still be together.
LEADFEMALE:Yes siree-do-da, sir.
SUPMALE:Sir, the most amazing thing is I found out that it's no fun to be single alone.
SUPFEMALE:I guess that's why all those singles flock together.
LEADFEMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
