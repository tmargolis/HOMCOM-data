LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! ( uniform makes gurgling sounds ) ( gurgling sounds ) Babalu, Mindy.
SUPMALE:( sighs ) Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, am I glad you're home.
SUPFEMALE:Could you do me a little favor? Of course.
SUPMALE:Uh, would you put away your space suit? Oh, sure.
OTHERMALE:( gurgling ) Ah, space suit, good to see you.
LEADMALE:( gurgling happily ) Ah.
SUPMALE:Oh, of course I miss you.
LEADFEMALE:( gurgling ) Yes, yes.
OTHERMALE:You see, I have to wear Earth clothing now that I'm here on Earth.
OTHERMALE:( gurgles ) It's true.
LEADMALE:Mork, you talk to your space suit? Of course.
LEADMALE:It spoke first.
LEADFEMALE:I'd be rude not to reply.
SUPFEMALE:( speaking Orkan ) ( gurgling ) But you're treating it like it's alive.
LEADMALE:It is.
SUPFEMALE:It's made up of billions of tiny living cells.
LEADMALE:( sniffs ) Whew! If you call that living.
LEADFEMALE:( gurgling ) I'm sorry you know it's true.
SUPMALE:You smell bad.
LEADMALE:( gurgling ) You see, you earthlings are in a primitive state, but you'll realize that life exists in many forms throughout the universe when you gain higher intelligence and more sophistication.
SUPMALE:( in baby talk ): Time for dodo num-nums, okay? ( gurgling ) What? ( gurgling ) No, I can't tell you a story tonight, so you just hang in there.
LEADFEMALE:( suit gurgling ) Ne-ne.
OTHERFEMALE:I know it's probably my fault.
SUPFEMALE:Spare the rod and spoil the suit.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, how'd your observation of traffic go today? Oh, not very well.
SUPFEMALE:Why do they call it rush hour when nothing moves? Got me.
SUPMALE:I had to go to a movie instead.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you did? What'd you see? Oh, it was a love story called Here Comes the Fleet.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, I love that one.
LEADMALE:I'd like to see that one again.
LEADMALE:So would I.
LEADFEMALE:I have several questions I'd like to ask you about it, if you don't mind.
OTHERMALE:Oh, go ahead.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:You remember Biff and Margie? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You remember when they first met, they had this horrible fight, and then the very next scene, they were together on a date again.
SUPMALE:Why? Because they were falling in love.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I see.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, sucker's hot.
SUPMALE:But there's one small thing I don't understand.
LEADMALE:Hmm? What is this thing called "love"? You don't know? I know it's an emotion, but we abolished emotions on Ork a billion bleems ago.
SUPFEMALE:They took a vote, and everyone said, "All in favor?" ( buzzes ) Well, Mork, if you want to be an earthling, you're just going to have to experience love.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! Does this love lead to mating? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, because I've been wanting to try that.
LEADFEMALE:When can we start? When can we start? Oh, wow.
SUPMALE:DÃ©jÃ  vu.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, you see, we can have a mating, and I can send back a report to Orson complete with slides, video demonstrations Oh Oh.
OTHERMALE:See, see, Mork, it doesn't quite work like that.
LEADFEMALE:See, um mating I mean, love When a man and a woman really care about each other, then ( suit gurgling ) Mindy, my suit needs me.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be right back.
OTHERMALE:Sure.
SUPMALE:We'll discuss this love another time.
LEADMALE:Fine with me.
LEADMALE:Your suit really got me off the hook.
OTHERMALE:Oh, humor.
LEADMALE:( honks ) What is it? ( gurgling ) Why didn't you think about this before you went to bed? ( Hare Krishnas singing ) I'd give them money if they'd just learn another song.
LEADMALE:Cora, well, it does my heart good to see you tending to my inspired little window display.
LEADMALE:Has she attracted many customers yet today? Customers, no.
SUPMALE:Dust, yes.
OTHERMALE:And I'll tell you another thing, Fredzo.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting a little tired of picking dead flies out of her wig.
LEADMALE:Have your little joke, Cora.
LEADFEMALE:Nothing you can say or do is going to upset me today.
OTHERFEMALE:Life is wonderful, life is sweet, and I am thrilled to be alive.
LEADFEMALE:Cool it.
LEADMALE:You're bringing me down.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if that's your attitude, I'm going to bring you down some more.
SUPMALE:Cora what could I have that would say, "Here is a man who is a success"? A sign saying, "Here is a man who is a success.
SUPFEMALE:" Wrong.
SUPMALE:Driving a brand-new Cadillac.
OTHERFEMALE:That says a man is a success.
LEADFEMALE:Mm, well, it doesn't say much for you.
LEADFEMALE:You drive a '69 compact.
LEADMALE:Not after today.
OTHERMALE:I have scrimped, and I have saved, but it was worth it.
SUPFEMALE:I've got $2,300 in here, and that gives me just enough to swing the deal.
LEADFEMALE:Here, look.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it a beauty? Now, why do you need a car three blocks long when you only live a block and a half away? Well, I don't need the car to drive to work.
SUPMALE:I need the car to drive to my high school class reunion this Saturday night, and that's 53 miles from here.
LEADFEMALE:I thought you hated high school.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, no, no, I didn't hate high school.
LEADFEMALE:I hated Forrest Collins.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Because he was big, because he was a bully, and because he said I'd never amount to anything.
LEADFEMALE:You know it's strange, but Elizabeth never told me any of this.
LEADFEMALE:Well, because I never told her.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, I never told anybody about it until now.
SUPMALE:But look, that's behind me.
SUPMALE:I've saved my money, and I'm getting my Cadillac, and there is nothing that anybody can say that can stand in the way of my happiness.
SUPFEMALE:Hello, Daddy! Except that.
LEADMALE:"Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:" ( groans ) Hello, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:Hello, Mrs.
LEADMALE:Hudson.
LEADFEMALE:Where's Mindy? Well, she's out on an errand, but she should be back soon.
SUPMALE:Oh, a wingless hibenginie.
LEADMALE:I thought they were extinct.
LEADFEMALE:Guess they are.
SUPMALE:Stiff city.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Hudson.
OTHERFEMALE:Hmm? May I ask you something very personal? Shoot.
LEADMALE:How do you know when you meet the person you'll fall in love with? Oh, Mork, I promise you, when you meet the right one, you'll know it.
SUPMALE:And you knew the minute you met Mr.
LEADMALE:Hudson? Oh, yes.
OTHERMALE:It took 15 years for us to realize it was love at first sight.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you're going to need these while you're waiting for Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, snacks.
OTHERMALE:No, no.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, they're, uh they're to make the music sound better.
LEADFEMALE:That's illogical how can anything sound better by putting cotton in your ears? You'll see.
LEADFEMALE:( violin paying off-key ) ( shouting ): I understand you now! MINDY: Please be here.
SUPMALE:Oh, please, please, please, please be here.
LEADMALE:Oh, good! Oh, no! Oh, darn it.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy! Oh, hi, Mork.
SUPMALE:Ooh, heavy vibrations.
LEADFEMALE:Early sensor reading says anxiety, depression, state of defunk.
LEADFEMALE:What seems to be the matter? Oh, I'm just disappointed in the mail.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, then let me teach you something.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, it's common throughout the universe for the female of the species to be disappointed in the male.
LEADMALE:The nimnul factor's omnipresent, and they can be such beasts sometimes.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork, you don't understand.
SUPMALE:I was expecting a special letter.
LEADMALE:Oh, let me give you one.
SUPMALE:How 'bout "K"? Maybe an "F" or a "U"? Oh, Mork I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:I was just trying to cheer you up.
LEADFEMALE:It's not going to help.
SUPFEMALE:See, Mork, I never finished college because I didn't really know what I wanted to do.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but now I know I want to go back and go on and get my degree in Journalism, and I'd applied for this scholarship, and I was just turned down, and now I can't go back What are you doing? Making a fool out of myself.
LEADFEMALE:I understand that's common in light of what's happened.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? Ooh.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) I took your advice, and this afternoon, I went out, and I fell in love.
OTHERMALE:What?! Oh, she's beautiful.
LEADFEMALE:The first time our eyes met I knew I knew it was the real thing.
LEADFEMALE:You see, I'm madly ( laughs, shrieks ) I am madly in love.
LEADMALE:Mork, you can't fall madly in love with someone you just met.
LEADFEMALE:Love takes time.
SUPMALE:No, you won't say that after you meet Dolly.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Well, certainly, I'd like to meet her sometime.
LEADMALE:Oh, no time like the present.
SUPFEMALE:She's out in the hall.
LEADFEMALE:Can I bring her in, huh, can I, can I, huh, can I? Of course.
SUPMALE:I mean, you shouldn't have left her standing out there alone.
OTHERMALE:Oh! Shh.
LEADMALE:Mindy meet Dolly! ( tango music playing ) ( turns off music ) You dance divinely, my darling.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:I want you to sit down.
LEADFEMALE:I have to have a little talk with the both of you.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, uh Oh, just sit down.
LEADFEMALE:After you first, my dear.
SUPFEMALE:There we go.
OTHERMALE:Relax.
LEADMALE:( snapping sound ) Now, I don't know how else to say this but to just come right out with it.
LEADMALE:You can't have a meaningful relationship with a mannequin.
LEADFEMALE:Why not? She's beautiful, shy, quiet.
LEADMALE:Of course she's quiet, she can't even talk.
SUPMALE:Oh, haven't you heard of body language? My darling, whoa, oh, oh, oh.
LEADMALE:I love it when she talks dirty like that.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you can't love an inanimate object.
LEADMALE:Why not, you say you love your book.
LEADMALE:That's different.
LEADMALE:And you said you loved Here Comes the Fleet.
SUPMALE:That's different, too.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't my love for Dolly different? That's too different.
LEADMALE:That's what I love about her.
LEADMALE:She's unique, one of a kind.
LEADFEMALE:That's what makes her wonderful, isn't it? Oh, Mork, yes, I think she's just wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Now look, so far my day has been pretty rotten.
SUPFEMALE:Now I'd like to stay here and talk to you two, but I have some problems of my own to work out, so I think I'll just leave.
LEADFEMALE:You have a good time.
LEADFEMALE:We will.
LEADMALE:At last we're alone, cara mia.
OTHERFEMALE:What shall we do tonight, my love? Hmm? Maybe we can go to the Balalaika, that quaint gypsy restaurant and ask for Bella, our favorite waiter, and he'll give us a booth near the oyster bar.
LEADMALE:I'd sit near the fireplace, but I know that it bums you out very much.
SUPFEMALE:Then afterwards we'll wander down the street, look in store windows, see if there's anyone there you know.
OTHERFEMALE:We can go dancing, my love.
LEADFEMALE:I know you don't like to dance.
SUPMALE:You feel a little stiff sometimes, but I have a better idea, cara mia.
LEADFEMALE:Come, stand up in your own special way.
LEADMALE:Yes, I'll tell you what ( snapping ) No, no.
SUPMALE:Let me sweep you off your feet, my love.
LEADFEMALE:Let me show you some old Roebuck catalogs now, come.
SUPMALE:We're going up to my attic.
SUPFEMALE:I'd like to show you some of my special drawings.
SUPMALE:A special romantic interlude, just you, Mu-mu and me.
LEADMALE:Upstairs we go, my love.
LEADMALE:( thuds ) Oops.
LEADMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me, you've got a headache now, don't you? I don't get it.
OTHERMALE:What kind of a ding-dong would take a mannequin from a store window? Well, what kind of a ding-dong would put it there in the first place? I'm not going to let it upset me.
LEADFEMALE:Today is Fredrick C.
OTHERMALE:McConnell's big day.
LEADFEMALE:Today I become a success.
LEADMALE:In one hour, I pick up my brand-new Cadillac.
LEADMALE:If that's what makes you happy, have fun.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, dear.
OTHERMALE:What's wrong? I guess I'm not very good at hiding my feelings, am I? No, not unless you're secretly happy.
SUPMALE:Honey, honey, what's the matter? Oh, Daddy, I wanted to surprise you.
LEADFEMALE:I was going to go back to college.
LEADFEMALE:College? Honey, that's wonder "Was"? That's just it.
SUPMALE:I was hoping for a scholarship, only they canceled the program, and I didn't get it.
SUPMALE:And I can't afford the tuition.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm so sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Well This is kind of a a dream of yours? Yeah, I guess it is.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know what that's like.
LEADMALE:How much money did you need? Well, the scholarship was for about $2,000.
LEADFEMALE:$2,000? That's an interesting figure.
LEADMALE:That's that's too interesting for my bankbook.
SUPMALE:Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, is today your lucky day.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you were gonna surprise me, now I'm gonna surprise you.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, ever since you were a little baby, I've been putting aside a little money for you.
LEADMALE:I was gonna save it until you needed it and ( sighs ) well, it looks like you need it now.
LEADMALE:What? There's $2,300 in there.
LEADFEMALE:I wish it could be more.
LEADFEMALE:( gasps ) God, I wish it could be more.
SUPMALE:This is incredible.
SUPMALE:I'll second that.
LEADMALE:Oh, Daddy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Daddy, you're wonderful.
LEADMALE:I can't believe this.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm going to go down right now and sign up.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, I'll talk to you guys later.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks again, Dad.
SUPMALE:Eh, Frederick.
OTHERFEMALE:You just did a wonderful thing, and I'm really hacked off about it.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, just when I convince myself that you're an absolute wiener, you turn around and turn around and do something nice.
SUPMALE:Did you see the look on Mindy's face? I mean, anybody that can make another human being look like that, he's gotta be a success.
LEADFEMALE:Well, now I can go to my high school class reunion and hold my head up in my old car if it starts.
SUPMALE:And so I thought you ought to know that's what he really was saving the money for.
SUPFEMALE:I just don't believe him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPFEMALE:Sometimes he acts like a BB stacker, but but underneath, dear, your father's really a a good guy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I know.
SUPMALE:Well, I'll just have to give him that money back.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, no, don't you dare do that.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, you made him very happy today.
OTHERMALE:More than a new car ever could.
SUPFEMALE:And if you want to make me happy, don't you ever dare tell him that I spilled the beans.
SUPMALE:Why? Well, you see, way down I know that your father really loves me, and I don't want to do anything to ruin our rotten relationship.
SUPMALE:Good night, Mork.
LEADMALE:Good night.
OTHERFEMALE:Good night, darling.
LEADFEMALE:Bye, Grams.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, but I find this all rather puzzling.
OTHERMALE:Oh, well, it's just another side of love, Mork.
SUPMALE:A father's love for his daughter.
SUPMALE:He sacrifices Oh, I know that.
SUPMALE:I read Lolita.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:( laughs ) But it's the other love that complicates things.
LEADFEMALE:What other love? Well, his love for her.
SUPMALE:You see, he calls her bad names, he tries to avoid her, but yet he still loves her? See, Mork, Dad and Grandma need each other.
SUPMALE:And that's what love is all about.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's just like my love for Dolly.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, Mork, I don't know about the rest of the universe, but here on Earth there's a big difference between a living woman and a mannequin.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Go get Dolly.
LEADMALE:I want to show you something.
SUPMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I'll have to wake her up.
SUPFEMALE:She had a headache so I put her in the guest room.
SUPMALE:My love.
LEADFEMALE:( gurgling sounds ) Get your sleeve off her, you! ( gurgling ) Come, my sweet.
LEADMALE:Ah, there we go.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, now I want you to hold Dolly's hand.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Mmm, nice.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I want you to hold my hand.
OTHERMALE:Oh, even nicer, and the fingers separate.
OTHERMALE:Okay, now I want you to hug Dolly.
OTHERMALE:Ooh.
LEADMALE:( falsetto ): Help me.
SUPMALE:Help me.
SUPFEMALE:Not bad.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now I want you to give me a hug.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:That's very, very nice.
LEADMALE:And no dead flies either.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now I want you to give Dolly a kiss.
SUPMALE:Just like in the movies? Just like in the movies.
SUPFEMALE:( Mindy laughing ) Now it's your turn, right? Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:It's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Do you see the difference? Whoa.
SUPFEMALE:Aah, aah, aah, aah.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) Genetic memory.
OTHERFEMALE:Whoa, primitive stirrings deep inside.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
SUPMALE:Amrak.
SUPMALE:Crazen.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, baby.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, I I think I understand.
LEADMALE:The for-real human being is much better than a plaster replica.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mindy, can we be alone for a moment? We are alone.
LEADFEMALE:No, no.
OTHERFEMALE:Dolly and me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sure.
SUPMALE:I understand, I think.
LEADMALE:Um, I have a few things that I could pick up at the store, anyway, so you two be alone.
LEADFEMALE:( humming ) Dolly? Dolly, darling.
LEADFEMALE:We have to have a little talk.
SUPMALE:That's all right.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I love you because you're such a good listener.
SUPFEMALE:Dolly? Why are you staring off into space like that? I guess you know what's coming.
LEADFEMALE:I You better kinda lay back for a second.
LEADFEMALE:( snapping ) We're different, dear, and I come from a planet where there are no emotions, and all of a sudden I met you and, "zingo," I felt something.
LEADFEMALE:It was like ( nonsense sounds ) I guess as you humans say, "I'll stop bushing around the beat.
SUPMALE:" Um, dear, I when I first met you, I found you very special, the way you the way you're so straight and yet, friendly, and the way your ankles turn around, kinda like backwards like that.
SUPMALE:Kinda like Linda Blair and, I I don't know, darling, I ( voice cracks ): it just isn't going to work.
LEADMALE:You're too good for me.
LEADFEMALE:I know, I know.
SUPFEMALE:Well, look at it this way.
LEADFEMALE:Someday you'll meet the mannequin of your dreams, and you're no dummy, Doll I know, no offense.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry.
SUPFEMALE:So all I can say to you, my love, it's it's over.
OTHERMALE:I, um, I'll miss you.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, don't no, you can't cry.
LEADMALE:Take care.
SUPFEMALE:I'll drop by and look in on you, and I'll miss you, love.
OTHERFEMALE:No, no, don't pass out on me.
OTHERFEMALE:Guess this means farewell forever, my love.
LEADFEMALE:( snapping ) Oh.
LEADMALE:You didn't have to give the ring back.
LEADMALE:MORK: Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:This is Orson.
LEADMALE:What's the matter with you? Me? Nothing.
LEADFEMALE:You've got a strange look on your face.
SUPMALE:Maybe it's love.
LEADFEMALE:Love? Isn't that an emotion? It's a many splendored thing.
LEADMALE:It makes the world go round.
LEADMALE:It'll keep us together.
LEADMALE:It's all you need.
SUPMALE:All I need is a report that makes sense.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Love doesn't make sense.
SUPFEMALE:That's why earthlings think it's so wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:Is there anything similar to it on Ork? No.
OTHERFEMALE:What happens is you get hot and sweaty.
LEADMALE:You can't eat, you can't sleep, and you feel dizzy all the time.
OTHERMALE:It sounds like that disease you got on Venus.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, Venusian's Revenge.
SUPMALE:We Orkans made the right decision in giving up emotions.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not so sure, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:You see, we may have given up too much.
SUPFEMALE:Even though I'm more advanced than these humans, sometimes I I feel so primitive, ( snickers ) I'm afraid I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Neither do I, Orson, but I'm not afraid.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mork signing off till next week.
OTHERFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:
