SUPFEMALE:lt's perfect for television.
LEADFEMALE:l simply love it, Mindy, and so will Channel 1 9.
SUPMALE:That look just screams anchorperson.
OTHERFEMALE:l don't know, Glenda Faye.
LEADMALE:Don't you think it's kind of a little too daring? lt's kind of flashy.
LEADMALE:Now, you know as well as l do that every TV news team has one blond.
OTHERMALE:Barbara Walters, Rona Barrett, Frank Reynolds.
SUPMALE:Yeah, but l couldn't go to an interview looking like this.
LEADFEMALE:My hair feels naked.
LEADMALE:Well, maybe that's why blonds have more fun.
LEADMALE:Well, l've been brunet all my life and l've had fun.
LEADMALE:Have you ever water-skied the Amazon? No.
LEADMALE:Have you ever danced with a Sherpa guide on the slopes of the Himalayas? Gone ice sailing with an Eskimo prince? l can't say that l have.
SUPMALE:Of course not.
LEADFEMALE:Brunets aren't invited to those things.
SUPFEMALE:And they aren't invited to be anchorpersons, either.
OTHERMALE:Thanks for the ride, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Rebozo.
OTHERMALE:Say ''hi'' to Bebe too.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Attack of the Bleach People.
LEADFEMALE:What? They turned you into Sandra Dee.
OTHERFEMALE:They sucked on your scalp.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, they have.
LEADMALE:They turned you into Swedish.
LEADMALE:Mork, it's just a wig.
SUPMALE:l knew that, Mind.
LEADMALE:May l see it for just a minute? Sure.
LEADMALE:Cold immobilizes them, Mind.
LEADMALE:Glenda Faye was trying to talk me into bleaching my hair for a job interview l have at Channel 1 9.
LEADFEMALE:Trust me, it'll work.
SUPMALE:Well, l must be off to my tai chi class.
SUPMALE:That would be very effective against a mugger on tranquillizers.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sayonara.
SUPMALE:l learned that on Shogun.
OTHERFEMALE:- So how was your day at the zoo? - Oh, it was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:- More than that, it was two-derful.
OTHERFEMALE:- Oh, yeah? l observed all these wonderful, weird animals.
SUPFEMALE:l saw two ants.
SUPFEMALE:l saw a black widow going, ''Baby, you ain't coming back here.
LEADFEMALE:'' l saw a praying mantis.
SUPFEMALE:They don't really pray, they just kind of chant.
LEADMALE:And then there was-- Oh, and l saw a butterfly and a bird and a dog.
SUPFEMALE:Those are the only animals you saw? Well, Mind, only the weird ones stick in my mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and l also made a friend at the zoo.
OTHERFEMALE:His name is Doc.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Does he live around here? No, he lives at the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:He's a chimpanzee.
SUPMALE:He lives there with his mother.
SUPMALE:lt was wonderful.
SUPMALE:We had this incredible conversation about how Darwin was wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l'm glad you had a good time at the zoo.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:l can't wait to go back.
LEADMALE:Do you have any 50-pound bags of peanuts around? No, l think we're all out.
LEADMALE:Pity.
LEADFEMALE:Since Carter lost, l thought we would.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Mork You're gonna be all right here, Doc, till we find who kidnapped your mom.
LEADMALE:Okay, that's all right.
SUPMALE:You're not even safe in a zoo anymore.
LEADFEMALE:That's incredible.
SUPMALE:l mean, they should put bars upon bars.
LEADFEMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you are tired, aren't you? Well, we'll find a place for you.
SUPFEMALE:Have a little monk nap.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see, we can't put you over there.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you can't hang around-- What am l talking about? Mind would be mad if l didn't give you the best room.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, you can sleep in Mind's bed.
SUPMALE:Don't be afraid.
LEADMALE:She's got a life-sized doll of Jackson Browne.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPMALE:- Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, hi, Mind.
LEADMALE:Well, l took Glenda Faye's advice and got the hair dye.
LEADFEMALE:l guess the moment of truth has come.
OTHERMALE:Do l become a blond or do l chicken out? Mork, l want you to tell me the truth.
SUPMALE:lf l do this to my hair, do you think l'll lose my--? - You know, my girl-next-door quality? - l don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Ask the guy next door.
LEADFEMALE:The one with the binoculars, who drools a lot.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what's the big deal anyway? So l become a blond.
OTHERMALE:lt'll all be worth it if l get that job interview.
LEADFEMALE:l hope.
LEADMALE:While l was at the zoo, something special happened.
LEADMALE:Can you tell me later? lf l don't do this now, l'm gonna chicken out.
SUPMALE:- Oh, it'll keep.
LEADMALE:- l'll talk to you later.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, one minute.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe less.
LEADMALE:- There's a monkey in my bed.
OTHERMALE:- lt's not actually a monkey.
OTHERMALE:lt's a chimp.
LEADMALE:That's a common misconception.
SUPMALE:You see, there are two groups.
LEADMALE:The simian groups and-- Would l seem forward if l asked for an explanation? No, just inquisitive.
LEADFEMALE:You see, that's my friend, Doc.
LEADFEMALE:The one l told you about, at the zoo? l sprung him.
LEADMALE:Mork, you took a chimp from the zoo last year.
LEADFEMALE:That was different.
SUPMALE:He was an exchange student.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you've gotta get him back.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, you don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:You really don't understand.
OTHERMALE:You're being so harsh and cruel.
SUPMALE:Mind, his mother was kidnapped from the zoo and l'm afraid the same men will come back and kidnap him.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:You kidnapped the chimp.
LEADFEMALE:You were afraid that chimp was gonna be kidnapped by the people that kidnapped the chimp's mother? And they say Earthlings are slow.
SUPFEMALE:How do you get involved in these things? Oh, Mind, l'm just trying to be a caring, loving person, like you taught me.
SUPMALE:Mork, it's still not right to steal a chimp.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Now, may l pose a hypothetical question to you? You're out strolling and lo and behold, you come upon Bambi in the middle of a burning forest.
LEADMALE:Now, here's the question.
LEADFEMALE:What do you do? You either lead Bambi to safety across the river, or do you baste him in barbecue sauce and have Bambi in a bucket? Time's up, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, all right.
LEADFEMALE:The zoo's probably closed anyway.
SUPMALE:- You gotta take him back tomorrow.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:l bet in the dictionary it says, ''merciful, see Mindy.
LEADMALE:'' Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, you won't even know he's here except for a few more hairs in the sink.
LEADFEMALE:But, hey, don't worry about that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mind, l'll take him back tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:l promise, l really do promise and-- Hey, just think how lucky you are.
SUPMALE:You get to sleep with him.
SUPFEMALE:What? Oh, Mind, come on, he's scared and lonely.
LEADFEMALE:lt's his first night away.
LEADFEMALE:- He's terrified.
SUPMALE:- Right, Mork.
SUPMALE:l'll tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:You sleep with the monkey and l'll sleep right here on the couch.
LEADMALE:But l gotta dye my hair because l got that interview at 9:00 in the morning - He's got on my best nightgown.
LEADMALE:- l know, Mind.
LEADMALE:He had a hard time deciding.
SUPMALE:He tried on everything in your drawer.
LEADMALE:Mind? Mind? Mind? - Mind? - Are we there yet? Mind, Mind, l'm really sorry l startled you like this, but, l mean, Doc's hungry.
LEADMALE:He'd like some warm milk.
LEADMALE:- Oh, okay.
SUPMALE:- Good.
LEADMALE:l'll go unplug the refrigerator.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you get him some water? Oh, Mind, even asleep, you're hotter than a pistol.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Water, water.
SUPMALE:Doc had the hiccups, so l had to scare him.
SUPFEMALE:- You did that well.
SUPMALE:- Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l might as well get up.
LEADMALE:lt's only four hours until my job interview.
LEADMALE:At least l'll be able to paint the circles out from under my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:l'm very sorry about all this, but you take such good care of me, l thought you could help take care of him.
LEADMALE:Yeah, l know, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You always mean well.
LEADFEMALE:l'd do the same for anybody whose mother was kidnapped from the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l'm gonna go to bed now, and try and keep it quiet out here, will you? Well, since l'm up, l might as well see how my hair turned out.
LEADMALE:No! No.
SUPMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:- Cured his hiccups, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, look at my hair.
LEADFEMALE:lt's terrible.
SUPFEMALE:lt's supposed to be blond, but it's green.
OTHERMALE:Well, you're right, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:lnstead of being short and sassy, - it's kind of short and grassy.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:What a night.
SUPMALE:l didn't get any sleep, my hair is green, there's a monkey in my bed.
LEADMALE:Oh, l wish that darn chimp had never come here.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, you don't mean that, Mind.
LEADMALE:- Oh, l don't know what l mean.
SUPFEMALE:lt seems like ever since that monkey got here, everything's been going wrong.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, green hair? Oh, Mind, Mind, come on, now.
LEADMALE:l think you look terrific.
SUPMALE:l mean, you can always be like an lrish debutante.
LEADMALE:Or you can be like a punk prom queen.
LEADMALE:- Oh, Mork, cut it out.
LEADMALE:- Or you can be Miss Algae.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, come on, now.
SUPMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:You could be like a good-time girl for a leprechaun.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l guess l wasn't meant to be a blond.
OTHERFEMALE:l'll just have to buy some dye in the morning and change it back to my natural colour.
LEADFEMALE:What, gopher brown? No, it's closer to woodchuck, l think.
SUPMALE:Anyway, l'm gonna go and see if l can rinse any more of this stuff out.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mork, he's gone.
OTHERFEMALE:- No, Mind, don't-- - Doc? Doc? - Doc? Doc, Doc, Doc.
LEADFEMALE:Get in there, shorty, and no funny business.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Exidor, you found him.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, thank goodness you're all right.
SUPMALE:You too, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:l just caught this burglar running from your house wearing your clothes.
LEADMALE:l had visions of you tied to a chair, wearing nothing but rope.
LEADFEMALE:Not a pretty picture.
LEADFEMALE:- He's not a burglar, though.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, really? Then how do you explain this? My hunch is they're your family peanuts and he swiped them.
LEADFEMALE:Lucky for you, l'm your neighbourhood vigilante.
SUPMALE:Boulder can sleep peacefully knowing Brutus and l are on patrol.
OTHERMALE:- Brutus? - My Doberman.
SUPFEMALE:- Hello there.
SUPMALE:- l wouldn't touch him there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
LEADFEMALE:l'm gonna take Doc into the bedroom.
OTHERFEMALE:By the way, do you know your hair is green? Yes, l do.
LEADFEMALE:Did you lose a bet? - No.
LEADFEMALE:- l see.
LEADMALE:ln that case: Mork, you're a fool.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you see what's going on right under your nose? What? Am l growing a moustache? You'll have to grow a lot more than that if you're gonna compete with him.
LEADFEMALE:Did you see the way she looked at him? Mork, they're in this together.
OTHERMALE:They're gonna rob you blind and run off to Rio.
SUPFEMALE:Exidor, you don't understand, really.
SUPMALE:Has she ever carried you like that? Think about it.
LEADFEMALE:Brutus, heel.
SUPMALE:Heel, Brutus.
LEADFEMALE:Heel.
LEADFEMALE:Good dog.
OTHERMALE:Good dog.
LEADMALE:Give me your paw.
LEADMALE:Give me a paw.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, the front one.
SUPMALE:Exidor, l don't think you really understand.
LEADFEMALE:You see, he's not an ex-con.
SUPFEMALE:He's not gonna run off with Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:- He's a friend of mine.
SUPFEMALE:- Clever disguise.
LEADFEMALE:You can't even see the zipper.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:You see, his mother was kidnapped and l'm hiding him here till we find out where she is.
SUPMALE:Have you checked the pawn shops? Brutus, don't.
LEADMALE:Heel, heel.
SUPMALE:Good dog, good dog.
OTHERMALE:No, no, you see, he came from the zoo.
LEADMALE:And l can't go there because they might recognise me, but, wait a minute, you can go because you'd be inconspicuous.
OTHERFEMALE:That's true.
OTHERFEMALE:Just another face in the crowd.
SUPFEMALE:Know when to hold them And know when to fold them All right, Doc, how many you want? None? Pretty cocky.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:l'll take four.
LEADFEMALE:ls that some sort of signal? One, two, four.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that fills my inside straight.
LEADFEMALE:Well, l call.
SUPMALE:What do you have? Well.
LEADMALE:Four aces, king high.
SUPMALE:That does kind of beat a 6.
LEADMALE:Just because you cleaned me out, l'm not gonna show you my centrefold of Jane Goodall now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, somebody's at the door, Doc.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, go sit down over here.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
OTHERMALE:You wait there for me.
LEADFEMALE:l'm not mad about losing, especially since it makes you forget your mom.
LEADFEMALE:l'll be right back.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry.
SUPFEMALE:- Hey, Pops.
LEADMALE:- Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:l brought over some of Mindy's old toys like you asked.
SUPMALE:So that's Doc.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, that's the child that Fay Wray never talks about.
LEADMALE:You know, l've never been up real close to a chimpanzee before.
SUPMALE:Oh, don't worry.
LEADMALE:They won't hurt you.
LEADMALE:- Shake hands with him.
LEADFEMALE:- Shake hands? No, no, l don't think so.
SUPMALE:l have a rule.
LEADFEMALE:Never give a wild animal something you might want back.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, come on, come on, now.
SUPMALE:Here, watch this.
SUPMALE:Hey, shake hand.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know, l think Mindy's right.
LEADFEMALE:- He should go back to the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:- Come on, now.
SUPMALE:You primates sit down and get to know each other.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:- Come on, now.
SUPMALE:There you go.
LEADFEMALE:Relax.
LEADMALE:l'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:l'm going to get a couple of bananas.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:You're not gonna leave me with this thing? Why? You won't hurt him.
LEADMALE:l'm going to talk to you in a kind voice and move very slowly.
LEADMALE:Look, l'm smiling.
LEADMALE:lf you can understand, l like you a lot.
LEADMALE:l brake for animals.
LEADMALE:Hey, here's something you might like.
SUPMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:See this? This is a tricycle.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you ride one? Well, maybe you can't, so l'll show you.
SUPFEMALE:Car break down again, Pops? No, l'm just making a fool out of myself for my very good friend.
SUPFEMALE:Well, bye, Mork, and have Mindy call me.
LEADMALE:Bye, pal, and thanks for sparing me.
LEADMALE:Hi there.
LEADFEMALE:Hello, Exidor.
SUPMALE:And goodbye.
SUPMALE:Nice guy.
SUPFEMALE:My dad used to walk backwards.
OTHERFEMALE:- Know what stopped him? - No, what? '68 Pontiac.
SUPMALE:Well, what's the news? What did you find out about--? Excuse me.
LEADMALE:lxnay, ixnay.
LEADFEMALE:lmpchay amray understanderay.
LEADMALE:Doc, come on, time for a little nap nap.
SUPMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Wanna come up? Here we go, here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you worry.
SUPFEMALE:l'll tell you that story again.
OTHERMALE:All right, what's the news about his mother? - Sit down, l can take it, l can take it.
OTHERMALE:- My first thought was white slavery.
LEADFEMALE:Then l figured, no, why sign up for that if l have to go look for a chimp? Then l ran into a keeper and he told me they'd rushed his mother to the zoo hospital.
LEADMALE:She wasn't kidnapped.
OTHERFEMALE:She was in the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:- What was she in there for? - Well, l couldn't find out, except that it's serious.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, if it's serious, you gotta get there right away.
OTHERMALE:- We've gotta take him too.
LEADFEMALE:- Hold it, Mork.
LEADMALE:There's a posse out looking for your fuzzy friend.
OTHERMALE:lt seems some fool kidnapped him.
LEADMALE:Coast is clear.
SUPMALE:You know, Mork, it's not easy sneaking a hot chimp back into a zoo.
LEADMALE:This is only the third time l've done it.
LEADMALE:The disguise worked because every time l call him Don Vito, no one bothered to question him.
SUPMALE:You know, hospitals give me the heebie-jeebies.
LEADFEMALE:That's why l quit the doctor biz.
SUPFEMALE:Let's see if anybody's home.
LEADFEMALE:l'm sorry, l can't talk right now.
LEADFEMALE:We're in the middle of some complicated surgery.
SUPMALE:Who was that masked man? An animal doctor who shaved off his fur.
LEADMALE:Exidor, l better talk to Doc alone.
OTHERFEMALE:Doc, now, you and l have to have a man-to-simian talk for just a second.
OTHERMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:You see, l don't know what's wrong with your mother in there, but if she doesn't get better, she's gonna go to a very special place.
LEADMALE:lt's called animal heaven.
SUPMALE:Everything's wonderful up there, where bananas grow on clouds, and you can swing from anything you want.
LEADFEMALE:And Flicka's up there and Trigger and all three Lassies.
OTHERMALE:You don't have to worry about anything, though.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, l know you're worried, but, you see, you'll always have part of her to hold on to, and that's her love for you.
LEADFEMALE:You were waiting for--? Doc.
SUPFEMALE:The whole zoo's been looking for him.
LEADMALE:Where's he been? Well, he was in Boulder overnight.
LEADFEMALE:We brought him right back.
LEADFEMALE:Well, his mom's had a tough time, but she's all right now.
LEADMALE:- Come on, Doc.
SUPMALE:- Hey, goodbye, little fella.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks very much and take care.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, l got a surprise for you.
OTHERMALE:l'm gonna take you back to your mama.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
OTHERMALE:Come on, come on.
LEADMALE:Oh, l'm gonna miss that little guy.
SUPFEMALE:l'd like you to meet Doc's new baby brother.
LEADFEMALE:Baby brother? So that's why his mom was in the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that, he's got his brother's knuckles.
LEADMALE:And he's got Charles Bronson's chin.
OTHERMALE:Thanks for getting Doc back to us.
SUPFEMALE:Now the whole family can be together.
LEADFEMALE:No sweat.
SUPMALE:Hey, take care, little: lt's a boy.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's a boy.
LEADFEMALE:Have a cigar.
LEADFEMALE:Don't mind if l do.
LEADMALE:lt's a baby boy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, wait a sec.
LEADFEMALE:Hold on, l didn't mean to wake you up.
LEADFEMALE:l'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Don't-- No, Glenda Faye, somebody else got it.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks for your help, but next time l go on a job interview, it's gonna be with my own hair.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Okay, l'll talk to you real soon.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, bye.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, shazbot, l lost.
LEADFEMALE:- What are you doing? Playing strip solitaire, and l'm losing fast.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so anyway, finish your story.
LEADMALE:You didn't get in trouble or anything when you brought Doc back? No, l just told them l found him.
SUPMALE:The problem is l didn't tell them where.
LEADFEMALE:l guess everything turned out for the best.
SUPFEMALE:l got my hair back - and Doc's back with his family.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:lt's a good thing too, but you know something, Mind? l really miss that little guy.
SUPFEMALE:You know: You know, Mind, l've been thinking, maybe we could-- Don't do this to me, Mork.
SUPMALE:Mind, you're right.
LEADMALE:l'll never spring another animal from the zoo, l promise.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, this Orkan has learned his lesson.
LEADFEMALE:He must have answered the ad, Mind.
LEADMALE:Let me show you upstairs.
LEADMALE:This is where you're going for your room.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, oh, Victor Huge-O.
SUPMALE:That's not my name.
SUPMALE:Well, l'll cut the fat and get to the meat.
LEADFEMALE:This week, sir, my report is on the status of animals on Earth.
SUPFEMALE:l assume they're the respected elite? Oh, no, sir, that's only on Ork, according to the decree by Prime Minister Fluffy.
LEADMALE:But some animals have it very good.
LEADMALE:They're called pets, just like Beebs here.
SUPFEMALE:Right, Beebs? Yeah, yeah, you know how that is.
SUPFEMALE:They have it great.
LEADFEMALE:Room and board, their dish with a name on it, and all the newspapers they can read.
OTHERFEMALE:Do all animals on Earth live this way? Well, no, sir.
LEADMALE:Some live in places called zoos, where they're protected.
LEADMALE:Do any animals roam free in their natural environment? Yes, sir, but they're called game.
SUPFEMALE:Sir, l wonder how much fun the game would be, though, if the animals were the ones with the rifles.
LEADMALE:- Tell me, Mork.
OTHERMALE:- Sir.
SUPMALE:Do you think animals will ever reach the status they have on Ork? Well, sir, l have faith.
LEADMALE:But it'll take some time.
OTHERFEMALE:l know that there are some humans who love and understand animals, and realise that all living things have feelings, even though they don't have the words to express them.
LEADFEMALE:And on that happy note, sir, l say good night.
SUPMALE:ln the words of my friend, Doc the chimp: Which means, na-no, na-no, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:Until next week.
