LEADFEMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I'm home.
LEADFEMALE:( screams ) May I take your coat? What are you doing in there? Trying to make your day a little bit better.
SUPMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Come.
SUPMALE:Rest your weary bod.
SUPFEMALE:There we go.
LEADMALE:Here.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:Wait, wait, wait, wait.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa! No.
LEADMALE:Rest yourself there.
SUPMALE:It's been a hard day at work, hasn't it, honey? There we go.
LEADFEMALE:A little mental massage.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh-ooh, ah-ooh There we go.
LEADMALE:There.
SUPFEMALE:You cozy yet? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I really appreciate what you're doing, but I haven't even been to work yet.
LEADMALE:I brought it all home with me.
LEADFEMALE:See? Oh.
LEADMALE:Then the Algerian mud rub is out.
OTHERFEMALE:( chuckles ) I guess so.
OTHERFEMALE:Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:What? How come you haven't told me what you're doing at the newspaper yet? Because I'm not supposed to tell anybody.
SUPMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:But you gotta promise not to tell anybody else.
LEADMALE:My lips are stapled.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:See, I'm working at the Boulder Journal for a couple of weeks.
SUPMALE:They hired me to answer the mail that comes in to their Lonelyhearts column.
LEADFEMALE:What's a "Lonelyhearts" column? Oh, I know, spare parts for donors.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Lonelyhearts column, it's for people who write in and ask for personal advice.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but why would they write in to a total stranger? I guess sometimes it's easier to, uh, bare your soul to someone you don't know.
OTHERMALE:To tell you the truth, I'm kinda nervous about this 'cause I've never done anything like this before.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mind, you're good at giving advice, like that time you told me not to eat soup with the thin end of the spoon.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Well, my Journalism professor recommended me for the job.
OTHERMALE:And nobody is supposed to know I'm doing this.
OTHERFEMALE:See, the regular Miss Lonelyhearts is in Reno getting his divorce.
LEADFEMALE:Are the letters in there? Can I read them, please? I mean, I am a super-intelligent alien with highly attuned powers of sensitivity.
SUPFEMALE:Please, give me a chance.
LEADMALE:Eeh.
LEADFEMALE:I can tell you what that one's about already too.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:How would a highly evolved being answer this one? All right.
LEADMALE:Let's see.
SUPFEMALE:"Dear Miss Lonelyhearts, "I found a pair of pantyhose in my husband's pocket.
LEADFEMALE:Should I be worried?" Don't panic.
LEADFEMALE:They may not be his.
SUPFEMALE:I'm a whiz.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm right there.
LEADMALE:Next.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mork, listen to this one.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:"Dear Miss Lonelyheart, "I've only lived in Boulder a few months "but they've been very lonely months.
LEADMALE:Somehow, men just don't notice me.
LEADFEMALE:" Poor guy.
LEADMALE:( clears throat ) "I'm not looking for anyone that unusual, "just a nice guy who's sensitive, likes the same things I like, "and is genuinely interested in what I have to say.
SUPMALE:"The trouble is I'm so busy every day, "going to a school and working in a deli, "I hardly have the opportunity to meet anyone or maybe I just don't know how.
SUPMALE:Please help me.
SUPMALE:" signed "J.
LEADMALE:From New York.
SUPMALE:" This letter's from Jeanie! She sounds pretty low, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, she sure does.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, I'd sure like to see her meet a guy like the one she described.
LEADMALE:Would that make you happy, Mind? It sure would.
LEADMALE:We gotta help her somehow.
LEADFEMALE:First thing I've gotta do is figure out how to answer this letter.
SUPFEMALE:What we have to do basically is work out how she doesn't know that you and I know that she knows that she doesn't know that we know it.
OTHERFEMALE:I wish it were that easy.
OTHERMALE:WOMAN: Waitress.
SUPMALE:Waitress! Jeanie Oh! More coffee? Sorry.
OTHERMALE:You want a new bag? Just our checks, please.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, uh, certainly.
OTHERMALE:WOMAN: Come on, let's go.
LEADMALE:Here's your money.
SUPMALE:( coins clink ) Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Jeanie.
LEADMALE:Can I see you for a minute? You know, for the last couple of weeks, you've been walking around in a daze.
SUPMALE:Uh, Remo, I'm a little lonely.
OTHERMALE:That's it? How can you be lonely? You got me, you got your friends, you got a television in your room.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, it's not that kind of lonely, Remo.
OTHERMALE:I need a guy who thinks I'm special.
SUPFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:What about Turk down at the gas station? Remember he whistled at ya? He's a great guy.
SUPFEMALE:He once bowled 260.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Remo, but a woman needs more than that.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm not I'm not looking for Mr.
SUPMALE:Perfect here.
LEADFEMALE:I just want a guy who's sensitive, likes what I like, cares what I have to say.
LEADMALE:There's nobody like that around.
SUPMALE:You wanna know something? I get lonely too.
SUPFEMALE:Boulder's a long way from New York.
LEADMALE:We're a couple of fish out of pollution.
LEADFEMALE:It's hard to find your way, but you gotta hang in there.
SUPMALE:Someday you're gonna meet a great guy who will appreciate you as much as I do.
OTHERMALE:I hope you're right.
OTHERMALE:I know I'm right.
LEADMALE:You know, I haven't found the right girl for me either.
LEADMALE:But I figure why not have fun with the wrong ones while I'm waiting.
OTHERFEMALE:Meanwhile, we have each other.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, why don't you let me close up for you tonight? No.
LEADMALE:I'll close up.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:You know, I'll see you later on when I get home from Turk's.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:You sure you don't mind? No.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:You take it easy, huh? I'm not going anyplace anyway.
OTHERMALE:( knocking ) Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:I was just in here closing up.
SUPMALE:I was just out here knocking.
LEADMALE:I think I hurt my hands because I guess I'm such a sensitive guy.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, you wanna come on in? Oh, thanks.
OTHERMALE:Can I? You know, I'm really fascinated by delicatessens.
OTHERFEMALE:I bet you are too, huh? ( giggles ) Uh, Mork, you okay? Sure.
LEADMALE:I guess okay as a sensitive guy can be.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! You've got a dirty-dish collection too.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:You collect dirty dishes? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:For about a week, and then Mindy makes me clean it up.
OTHERFEMALE:( laughing ) Ah.
LEADMALE:Can I get you something? Oh, no thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Then why are you here? Just to keep you company.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:What did you say? "Oh.
SUPFEMALE:" Fascinating.
LEADMALE:Um, Mork, I don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:The deli's closed.
SUPMALE:Well, I You know, I was just thinking how much we two have in common.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Like what? Well, for one thing, we both don't eat live game.
LEADMALE:Arr! Arr! And we both love to laugh.
LEADMALE:Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar! Ar, ar, ar, ar! Isn't that kind of uncanny? Mork, you seem sort of different tonight.
SUPMALE:I sure do.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, uh I gotta finish cleaning up.
SUPFEMALE:Then what are you gonna do? Uh walk home.
SUPFEMALE:Maybe I could walk with you, kind of tag along.
LEADFEMALE:We can do this.
SUPMALE:Maybe talk.
LEADFEMALE:We could be little walkie-talkies.
SUPFEMALE:You know, no one's walked me home in a real long time.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm not worried.
OTHERFEMALE:I think you remember where it is.
LEADFEMALE:Mm! Look! I made the newspaper.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:They printed my first replies in the Lonelyhearts column.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, congrats, kudos, and plaudits.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:What did you tell her? I shall read it to you.
OTHERMALE:Well, I shall be attentive.
SUPFEMALE:"Dear J.
SUPFEMALE:From New York, "It's not easy leaving all your friends "and moving far away from home.
LEADMALE:"You feel like an island in the midst of a sea of strangers.
LEADMALE:" Took me half an hour to come up with that one.
LEADMALE:That's a catchy phrase, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Tennessee Williams, move over.
LEADMALE:Here comes Colorado McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:"It's possible that the person you're looking for "is somebody you see every day but are just too busy to notice.
SUPMALE:"Look around you.
SUPFEMALE:"If he's there, try not to be shy.
LEADFEMALE:"Reach out and show him how you feel.
OTHERMALE:"He might become interested in you if he sees you're interested in him.
OTHERMALE:" That's wonderful, Mind.
LEADMALE:You're gonna make Abby crabby.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) You think? I just hope it helps Jeanie.
LEADMALE:I was helping her yesterday.
LEADMALE:You were? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I went over to the deli last night and cheered her up.
LEADMALE:You didn't tell her about the letters, did you? No, I just walked her home and gave her a few laughs.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:That's nice.
LEADFEMALE:The worst thing we could do is embarrass her.
SUPMALE:I know.
LEADMALE:Why are you building a tower of Cheerios? Because it's hard to stack oatmeal.
OTHERFEMALE:Why do I ask? I have to get to class, so, uh, I'll see you a little later.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:If you get hungry, your peanut butter pagoda's on the refrigerator.
SUPFEMALE:I'll never remember what order they were in.
LEADFEMALE:One-oh-four.
LEADMALE:( knocking ) ( laughs ) I feel like I'm living on a fault line.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Can I come in? ( as Southern preacher ): I know you can do it! Just put one foot forward! I came by 'cause I wanted to thank you again for walking me home last night.
OTHERFEMALE:I really did enjoy it.
LEADFEMALE:( normal voice ): I had fun too, especially leapfrogging over those fire hydrants.
LEADMALE:Too bad about that dog, huh? You know, Mork, um, ever since I moved here, I've sort of felt like an island in a sea of strangers.
LEADFEMALE:That's a catchy phrase.
SUPMALE:I mean, I know what it's like to be a stranger in a strange land.
LEADFEMALE:Does Mindy know that you walked me home last night? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I told her all about it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how does she feel about that? Well, she says if you're happy, she's happy.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy once told me that you and she were just good friends.
SUPMALE:Is that still the way it is? Well, yeah, we're buddies.
LEADFEMALE:That's all? That's enough.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there's something that I forgot to give you last night.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you do that? Well, 'cause, uh, I really hope that maybe we can keep seeing each other like we did last night.
OTHERFEMALE:You mean we could do something very special like ringing doorbells and hide.
LEADFEMALE:Your answer to my letter helped me a lot.
LEADFEMALE:When I took the time to look around me, I found someone who was there all along, but I never realized how wonderful he is.
LEADMALE:He came to my house the other night for dinner, and we had a terrific time.
LEADFEMALE:He's so thoughtful.
SUPMALE:He brought me this little gift, which will always remind me of him.
LEADFEMALE:Before dinner we sat together for a while and talked.
LEADFEMALE:The night had just begun, and already we were closer.
LEADFEMALE:Before we knew it, we found ourselves holding hands.
LEADMALE:Pretty soon one thing led to another.
SUPMALE:When it came time for dinner, I realized he's one of the few guys I've met who tries to be a gentleman.
LEADFEMALE:And in addition to all his other good qualities, he really knows how to make me laugh.
LEADFEMALE:He has everything I've ever wanted in a guy.
LEADMALE:He's so sensitive, gentle, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
LEADMALE:( buzzing ) ( splash ) ( intermittent buzzing ) ( buzzing ) He's such a good listener.
SUPMALE:He really cares about whatever I have to say.
LEADMALE:And, you know, he likes the same things that I like.
LEADFEMALE:It's almost like a dream come true.
LEADMALE:I just hope it won't be long before he starts getting serious.
LEADMALE:Thanks again for your kind help.
OTHERMALE:Gratefully, J.
LEADMALE:From New York.
SUPMALE:She must have found somebody great! "I hope it won't be too long before he starts getting serious.
SUPMALE:" ( knock on door ) Serious.
LEADMALE:If she wants serious, I'll give her serious.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:( as Nixon ): Hello, Jean, and I really mean that.
LEADFEMALE:Are you glad to see me? Indeed, I am, Jean.
SUPFEMALE:Make no mistake about that.
SUPMALE:Is everything all right? You seem sort of strange.
SUPFEMALE:I'm really in one of my serious moods, Jeanie.
LEADMALE:See? Uh, is Mindy home? No, she's not here right now.
SUPFEMALE:But you can ask anyone: Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, Exidor They know her.
SUPFEMALE:They'll vouch for me.
SUPMALE:I am not a liar.
LEADMALE:Oh, it was such a hectic day.
OTHERMALE:I thought it would be fun just to come over, and we could sit and talk for a while.
LEADMALE:Well, perhaps I could tell you one of my favorite jokes.
LEADFEMALE:What's black and white and red all over? I know.
LEADMALE:You're thinking, "a penguin with a heat rash.
SUPMALE:" but no-o-o-o, no-o-o-o, it's not that.
LEADFEMALE:It's not a nun with a sunburn, either.
SUPFEMALE:Now, come here.
LEADMALE:I'll tell you the secret.
LEADFEMALE:( gasps ) Did you hear a hum? ( laughing ) We'll have to discuss this at another time.
LEADFEMALE:You are too much, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I'm home.
OTHERFEMALE:She's home.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I've been wanting to tell you how much fun I've been having with Mork.
LEADMALE:Fun with Mork? ( normal voice ): I've been showing her a good time.
LEADMALE:Wink, wink.
LEADMALE:And I hope it will be for a lot more days to come.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I'm so glad it's okay with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Me too.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Do you remember that blue blouse I borrowed from you last week? Uh, well, it's in the bedroom right now.
LEADFEMALE:Could you get it for me please? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADMALE:Don't tell me you're the terrific guy she's been writing me about?! Yep, it's me.
LEADMALE:Don't you realize what you've done? But you said it was nice if I made her happy.
SUPMALE:Then when she wanted to see me again, I thought that was even nicer.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:Jeanie wants more than just a friend.
SUPMALE:She wants somebody she can spend her life with.
SUPFEMALE:You mean like you and I share our lives? And then some.
SUPMALE:I forgot all about this blouse.
LEADMALE:Mork, uh, if you like it, I could wear it tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Um would you like to sit down? Jeanie, um I think we have a problem here.
LEADFEMALE:A big one.
LEADMALE:I, uh, don't know how to tell you this, but, uh, I think I have to before it goes too far, if it hasn't already.
LEADFEMALE:Uh See I'm Miss Lonelyhearts.
OTHERMALE:( chuckles nervously ) What? Uh, I I've been reading your letters, and I guess so has Mork.
SUPMALE:And, uh, see, I was only trying to help.
LEADMALE:Um, I I got this job at Jeanie Wait, Jeanie.
LEADFEMALE:Um, I gotta go.
LEADFEMALE:You told me you wanted me to make her happy.
LEADMALE:Yeah, but the trouble is you made her ecstatic.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, what a tangled web I weave.
LEADMALE:I don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:Why'd you have to write those letters? Why couldn't you come talk to me? I'm your brother.
LEADMALE:I didn't wanna dump my problems on you, Remo.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna drown my sorrows in rocky road.
OTHERFEMALE:What good are these shoulders of steel if my little sister can't? Can't lean on 'em once in a while? I made a fool of myself, didn't I, Remo? It's not your fault.
LEADMALE:How were you supposed to know.
SUPFEMALE:Mork was such a heartbreaker? I'd have never guessed it.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just so confused.
OTHERMALE:I don't blame ya.
OTHERMALE:Mork should have known better.
SUPFEMALE:But whatever happened, I just can't believe that Mork or Mindy would do anything to hurt ya.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if it had happened to me, I think I'd look at it in this way: Hey, at least I had a little fun.
SUPMALE:I didn't sit at home with a long face.
LEADFEMALE:I came out of my shell, and I'm not pregnant.
SUPMALE:( knock on door ) Hi, Remo.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, can we talk to Jeanie? Hey, guys, I don't think this is a real good time.
LEADFEMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:It's important.
LEADMALE:Well, okay, but try and make her feel better, would you? Hi.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll be in my room.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about the ironing.
LEADMALE:I'll take care of it.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanie, I just wanna say I'm really sorry, and it was really dumb of me to think I could just step into a job and become Miss Know-It-All.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, who am I to go around telling people what to do with their lives? I was just trying to be a friend.
OTHERMALE:I didn't know you wanted "and then some.
LEADMALE:" I'm sorry, Jean.
LEADMALE:Wait, guys.
SUPFEMALE:( sighs ) You see, ever since I, uh I moved to Boulder, I sort of had a hard time fitting in.
SUPFEMALE:I never told anybody, and then finally I wrote Miss Lonelyhearts.
LEADFEMALE:And she told me that this wonderful guy might be right in front of me, which he was.
SUPFEMALE:And that all I had to do was to reach out to him, which I did.
SUPFEMALE:And, guys, I had I had so much fun.
LEADMALE:But do you know why? 'Cause you both helped bring out qualities in me that I forgot I had.
LEADFEMALE:BOTH: We did? Terrific qualities.
OTHERFEMALE:And you made me realize why I haven't met that right guy.
LEADMALE:I haven't been the right girl.
LEADMALE:Oh, you always have been to us.
LEADMALE:I love you, Mork.
OTHERMALE:I love you, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks to you guys, I'm starting to love myself again.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm glad.
OTHERFEMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:Me too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how does it look? Remo, did you ever write a letter to Miss Lonelyhearts signed "Confused"? Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:( makes horn sound ) Hey, move, will ya?! ORSON: What did you learn about this week, Mork? Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:About shyness, your thighness.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you toy with me so? Because you're there, sir.
LEADMALE:You see, sir, shyness is a major problem here on Earth.
OTHERMALE:It keeps people apart when they want to be together.
LEADMALE:They see someone they want to know, but they're afraid to approach them.
LEADFEMALE:What causes this shyness? Well, sir, I have a friend who became shy when she moved away from home to a place where she didn't know anybody.
SUPMALE:You did that too, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:I know, sir.
LEADFEMALE:At first it was very hard to feel at home here.
LEADMALE:People were so strange.
LEADMALE:They talk in heavy accents.
SUPFEMALE:They drink with their mouths.
SUPFEMALE:They sit on what we play checkers with.
LEADMALE:I finally overcame it because I was willing to reach out.
LEADFEMALE:What about your friend? She spent a lot of time feeling lonely, then she realized her best chance of going out was to be more outgoing.
SUPMALE:That reminds me of an old Orkan saying.
SUPMALE:Me too, sir.
LEADMALE:"If one stays too long in his shell, he'll wind up nuts.
LEADFEMALE:" On that same note, sir Nanu.
