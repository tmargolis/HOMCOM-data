SUPFEMALE:Happy birthday, Mr.

SUPMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Happy Bickday, Birth.
LEADFEMALE:My colleagues and moi have created the world's first Mork-O-Gram.
LEADMALE:utilising the letters of your name.
SUPMALE:Ready? B is for the buddy that you've always been to me.
LEADFEMALE:I is for the illusions you shattered.
SUPMALE:Like when you told me the Easter bunny has rabies.
SUPFEMALE:C is for cake.
LEADFEMALE:When do we eat? Why isn't this working out like I planned? All right, Morkettes.
LEADFEMALE:Plan B.
OTHERMALE:Happy 50, Bicky.
SUPMALE:That's terrific.
LEADFEMALE:Would the Morkettes like a piece of cake? No, thanks, Mindy.
SUPMALE:The moment was enough for me.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, little munchkins.
SUPFEMALE:I'll bring some cake to you at the day-care centre tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:You'd better, buster, or I just may forget I'm a lady.
LEADMALE:That was really sweet of those little girls.
OTHERMALE:Thanks, Mork.
LEADMALE:I didn't have the heart to tell them I was only 49.
LEADMALE:Forty-nine? Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:We called your son Tom, and he said you were 50.
LEADMALE:Oh, he confuses me with Paul Newman.
SUPMALE:Look, I'll show you my driver's license.
LEADFEMALE:That will prove conclusively that I'm really only There, you s Oh, my God, I am 50.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, welcome to the half-century club.
SUPFEMALE:So we're 50, so what? At 50, our lives are just beginning.
LEADMALE:Yes, if you were a tortoise, you'd be just a baby.
LEADMALE:And if you were an elephant, you'd be a teenager.
LEADFEMALE:And if you were a dog, you'd be dead.
SUPMALE:I feel like I've lost a whole year.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'm 50.
LEADFEMALE:All those things I've never done.
SUPFEMALE:- What kind of things? - You know, stuff you put off.
LEADMALE:Like, well, I've never read the entire Bible.
OTHERMALE:I've never seen the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls.
LEADFEMALE:You know what really gets me? I never told my son the facts of life.
LEADFEMALE:- How old is he? - Twenty-seven.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he's probably still up.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you give him a call? I'll bet he's with some girl, wondering what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody ever had to tell me the facts of life.
LEADMALE:- Guys know, right, Mork? - Hey, yo, yo, yo.
LEADFEMALE:Let's face it.
LEADMALE:I'm an old man.
SUPFEMALE:So many things I should've done and didn't do.
SUPMALE:Opportunity raced by and left me sniffing its exhaust.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mr.
SUPMALE:Bickley.
SUPMALE:Don't be so hard on yourself.
LEADMALE:I mean, regrets have nothing to do with age.
SUPMALE:We all have them.
LEADMALE:You know, things we didn't do, things we should have done.
SUPMALE:Oh, regrets.
LEADMALE:I've had a few, but I've handled them my way.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what could you possibly have to regret, you little pixie pants? Well, oh, bless you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, the fact that, well, my foot doesn't have a thumb, that my ears don't spin in the wind, that I'll never find out who Rula Lenska was.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, you know what might be really interesting tonight? lf we all shared our regrets with everybody else.
OTHERMALE:It'll help Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:And we'll all get to know each other a lot better.
OTHERMALE:Oh, please say yes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm for anything that'll help poor old Mr.
OTHERMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, it's your apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you go first? lt's always her apartment.
LEADMALE:I live here too.
OTHERMALE:I only regret that I don't have her clout.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, what is it that you regret most in your life? Oh, I'd really rather not go first.
SUPFEMALE:You know, kind of shy and all.
LEADMALE:Would anyone like some coffee? Oh, curiosity at her strange evasion.
LEADMALE:Well, then, I'll go first.
LEADFEMALE:Why did I say that? This is going to be embarrassing.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, go for it, Jeanie.
LEADFEMALE:Well What I most regret in life has to do with a man named Tony.
LEADFEMALE:I remember him.
SUPMALE:He was a big guy, almost 5'8''.
OTHERMALE:He really knew how to talk to me.
SUPMALE:I was kind of quiet and shy, and I really didn't think very much of myself at the time.
LEADFEMALE:But what I saw in Tony's eyes was so much nicer than anything I'd ever seen in my own mirror.
LEADMALE:Can you imagine having somebody make you feel that special? How long did you and this Tony go together? Two months Before I found out he was married.
OTHERMALE:Married? You mean he was cheating on you? Now, wait a second, that guy, Tony, you dated him over a year.
SUPMALE:- That's my regret.
SUPMALE:- Oh, I can't believe this.
LEADMALE:My little sister playing Dallas in the Bronx.
SUPFEMALE:- Mindy, would you like to go next? - Oh, I'd rather not.
LEADMALE:You know, Nelson's dying to go next.
LEADMALE:- He is? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:I bet the only he regrets is his little pink eyes can't stand this much light.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, my biggest regret is that Glenda stiff-armed me at the drive-in last night.
LEADMALE:I told you, that's not where the popcorn dropped.
LEADMALE:Come on, Nelson, there must be something in that albino soul of yours that you wanna let out of there.
SUPMALE:Let it out, let it fly.
LEADMALE:Open up, open up, open up.
LEADMALE:Yeah, make us cry.
LEADMALE:Well, there is something.
LEADFEMALE:It's been haunting me for years.
LEADFEMALE:- I was 1 5-- - That's a good one.
LEADMALE:Who's next? And every morning, I'd take the bus to school, the Number 26 bus.
SUPFEMALE:One morning, she gets on.
OTHERFEMALE:She had the prettiest blond hair I'd ever seen, besides my own.
LEADMALE:She took my breath away.
OTHERFEMALE:I watched her as she sat down.
LEADMALE:About the same distance as Mork is sitting now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, really? Kind of like this? I couldn't take my eyes off her.
LEADMALE:I kept staring at her, thinking, ''I've gotta meet this person.
SUPFEMALE:'' But before I could think of how to approach her, the bus stopped and she got up to leave.
LEADMALE:She passed in front of me on the way to the exit.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERMALE:She smiled politely and Got off the bus.
SUPMALE:My heart was pounding.
LEADMALE:I wanted to meet her and get to know her so bad.
LEADMALE:All I had to do was follow her off the bus and say hello, but I just sat there.
LEADFEMALE:The bus pulled away.
OTHERFEMALE:I watched her through the window.
LEADMALE:I saw her grow smaller and smaller in the distance.
LEADMALE:There went my dream.
LEADMALE:All right, well, now, who's gonna go next? Mindy? Oh, I'd really like to, but I have to get the ice cream for the cake.
LEADMALE:I'll go warm up the ketchup.
OTHERMALE:Mind, Mind, I sense a certain aversion to airing your regret.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, am I right, am I wrong? Why do I ask another question? There, I did it again, but Oh, Mork, it's just that it's very personal.
SUPMALE:I'd really rather tell you when we're alone.
LEADMALE:Our sense of intimacy grows.
LEADFEMALE:Well, ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to be a dancer.
LEADFEMALE:I always heard music in my head, and my body just seemed to wanna move to it.
SUPFEMALE:I started with ballet when I was about 5, and I just loved it so much.
OTHERFEMALE:And one day my father said to me, ''Where's the newspaper?'' And I said, ''Over there.
OTHERMALE:'' Then I fell on my tutu.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, after the ballet, there was tap and jazz and modern, and I just felt so free.
OTHERMALE:And then Randolph came into my life.
LEADMALE:And, you know, he loved to dance just as much as I did.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think our feet touched the ground for our entire marriage.
SUPFEMALE:And then I was alone.
OTHERMALE:And I haven't felt like dancing since.
OTHERFEMALE:It's not right to close off a part of you, is it? Glenda Faye, would you dance with me? Oh, you mean now? Well, I've got the music in me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no, I don't think so.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADMALE:- Sure, come on.
SUPMALE:- No, no.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, my dad's got a barn.
LEADFEMALE:Come on.
SUPFEMALE:- Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Music, minstrel.
LEADMALE:Well, my regret is that women only want me for my body.
LEADFEMALE:What? Wanna trade regrets? It's not funny, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
SUPFEMALE:It's a curse I've had to live with.
SUPMALE:Girls only see me as a plaything.
LEADMALE:I have a mind too, you know.
LEADMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, when I'm on a date, all I hear is: ''Remo, make a muscle.
OTHERFEMALE:Remo, make a muscle.
LEADFEMALE:'' You know how cheap this makes me feel? Hey, look, at heart, I'm an old-fashioned guy.
OTHERMALE:I don't know, these days, all women wanna do is grope, grope, grope.
SUPMALE:I'm tired of being a phone number passed around at the beauty parlour.
LEADFEMALE:You understand, don't you, Mr.
SUPMALE:McConnell? I want a relationship.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry, Remo, but he's already married.
SUPMALE:I can't help that God built me this way.
LEADFEMALE:You know how it feels when a woman looks at my shirt, and then whispers to her girlfriend, ''I wonder if they're real''? Tragic.
SUPMALE:I don't know, I just pray that somewhere, there's some woman sensitive enough to, I don't know, see beyond this classic shell of a man.
LEADMALE:I want her to discover the real Remo, to reach out for me.
LEADMALE:I wanna be talked to, I wanna be held.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'm sure there's someone out there somewhere.
SUPMALE:I just hope she's built.
LEADMALE:Yo, yo, yo.
SUPFEMALE:All right, who hasn't spilled his guts yet? Let's see, I think it's Mr.
LEADFEMALE:McConnell and Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Dad, will you go next? Come on, Pops, tell them about the time you were sold into bald slavery.
OTHERMALE:Well, there is something I've lived with for quite some time.
LEADMALE:Even Mindy doesn't know about it.
LEADFEMALE:Really? What is it? It happened November 24th, 1 950.
LEADFEMALE:In Korea.
LEADMALE:lt was late.
LEADFEMALE:We were on patrol.
LEADFEMALE:I remember trudging through the frozen mud in a miserable 5 below.
SUPMALE:Suddenly, the sky lit up with incoming shells, and we all scattered into the woods.
SUPMALE:I'd never seen trees broken off at the top before.
SUPMALE:Or men either.
LEADMALE:Now, the shelling stopped, and I was surrounded by an eerie silence.
SUPMALE:Just then, I heard the frozen mud crunch behind me.
LEADMALE:I looked around, and I saw somebody charging me with a fixed bayonet.
LEADFEMALE:Before he could get to me, I raised my rifle and I shot him.
LEADMALE:And he flew back into a shell hole, dead.
LEADMALE:Mindy, I killed a man.
OTHERMALE:Oh, but, Dad, you had to.
SUPMALE:He would've killed you.
SUPMALE:He was the enemy, Uncle Fred.
LEADFEMALE:When he's three feet away, he's another human being.
OTHERMALE:The look on his face as his life left him There are nights when I still see it.
LEADMALE:I just wish I didn't have to pull that trigger.
LEADMALE:If you didn't, Fred, you wouldn't be here with us.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and you never would've had Mindy.
LEADMALE:Mork, you're right.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and I would probably be living with Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley.
OTHERFEMALE:Then I'd really have a regret to share with you all.
SUPMALE:My, some of these regrets are heavy.
LEADFEMALE:You know, but they make me feel so much closer to all of you tonight.
SUPMALE:It feels really very good.
LEADMALE:I never knew exposing myself was such a warm experience.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it's been an interesting party, but it's past my bedtime.
LEADMALE:Hey, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:Mindy, you haven't told us your regret.
LEADMALE:- Come on, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah, that's right.
SUPMALE:- Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah, Mindy, come on.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no.
SUPFEMALE:She has no regrets.
SUPMALE:She's led a perfect life, thanks to me and her Lady Remington.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you see, I really can't - The door.
LEADMALE:The door.
OTHERMALE:- Regrettus interruptus.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:- Mork, is that you? - It's me, Exidor.
SUPMALE:No, I'm Exidor, you're Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Who is that? - Exidor, the town loon.
LEADFEMALE:I resent that, Curly.
SUPMALE:I don't live in town.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a Valley guy.
LEADFEMALE:I bring bad news, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:It's not going to be easy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd better sit down.
OTHERFEMALE:I just got back from the doctor.
SUPMALE:- Which doctor? - Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:He told me in Swahili I've only got 41 years to live.
OTHERMALE:Here's his note describing my condition.
LEADFEMALE:''Your mama.
SUPMALE:'' For goodness' sakes, Exidor, Easy for you to say, cue ball, you've got your health.
SUPMALE:I'm about to punch out.
LEADMALE:That's why I plan to spend my last waning moments here in this house, with my dearest friends.
LEADFEMALE:Imagine our excitement.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll just lie down unobtrusively.
SUPFEMALE:All of you vital people just go on with whatever you were doing.
SUPMALE:Okay, Mindy, what are your regrets? What? Remo, there is a man in a robe lying on us.
OTHERFEMALE:I couldn't help overhearing.
LEADFEMALE:What's this garbage about regrets? We're telling each other things we regret the most.
LEADMALE:Oh, I've got one.
SUPMALE:Besides the fact that Whitey here's got boney knees.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Mork, I've been feeling really down in the dumps since my wife left me.
LEADFEMALE:You must've been awfully shocked when she bit through the leash and got away.
SUPMALE:I was feeling really low there for a while.
LEADFEMALE:I even let my appearance go.
LEADMALE:And then, as fate would have it, I became attached to another woman.
OTHERFEMALE:Deeply attached.
LEADFEMALE:My regret is that I haven't told her my feelings.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, then by all means, go and tell her now.
SUPMALE:Should I, Mork? Should I run to her and risk rejection, not to mention mono? Yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Go to her.
LEADFEMALE:Let your heart fly like a moth into a blowtorch.
LEADMALE:I love you, my sweet.
SUPMALE:I wanna have your baby! Oh, no.
LEADMALE:No way, not me.
SUPFEMALE:I see.
LEADFEMALE:Goodbye, Whitey, Shorty, Curly.
LEADMALE:You too, Perky.
LEADMALE:You know, Mork, you're the only one here with a normal name.
SUPMALE:Well, I hate to admit it, but this has been the best 50-year-old birthday party I've ever had.
SUPFEMALE:And you've all helped me learn something here tonight.
SUPFEMALE:Age has nothing to do with regrets.
LEADFEMALE:I can do all those things I've always wanted to do starting tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Who the hell's stopping me? - Right, yeah.
LEADMALE:- Come on.
LEADMALE:But tonight, I need my rest.
SUPMALE:I've got 50 years of living starting tomorrow.
LEADMALE:Come on, Frankie, let's see if we can beat these kids to the door.
SUPFEMALE:- Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, the guest of honour is leaving.
SUPMALE:It doesn't take the roof to fall in on my head.
LEADMALE:I know the party's over.
OTHERFEMALE:Sorry I didn't get to hear your regret, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, it'll keep.
SUPMALE:- Thank you.
SUPMALE:- Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Good night.
LEADMALE:- Bye, thanks for coming.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:- Real nice to have friends, huh? - Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:- See you.
LEADFEMALE:- Bye, Remo.
LEADMALE:Yo, yo, yo.
LEADMALE:All right, Mind, you can tell me now.
LEADFEMALE:What was your regret? Come on, now.
LEADMALE:Come on, come on, come on.
LEADMALE:Okay, okay, let me sit down.
OTHERMALE:My regret is that my mother had to die before she got a chance to meet you.
SUPMALE:See, I couldn't say that in front of everybody, because then I'd have to explain that I wanted her to know everything about you, and Well, the fact I came from another planet and everything.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:And that you're as close to me as she was.
LEADMALE:And that you're the most important thing in my life.
OTHERFEMALE:Deeply moved.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, my mom would've liked you, Mork, I just know it.
SUPMALE:- I would've liked her too.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I know what I would've said to her too.
LEADMALE:- You do? - Sure.
LEADMALE:Hello, Mrs.
LEADMALE:McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:That's my way of saying shalom.
OTHERMALE:No, ma'am, I don't live around here, I live here.
OTHERFEMALE:With Mindy, yes, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Well, we're very close.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, not that close.
LEADMALE:I don't even know what that is.
SUPMALE:You see, ma'am, I'm a creature from another planet.
LEADMALE:You know: You know, like Alien.
LEADFEMALE:Except that I'm cuter, and I don't skitter across the floor like that.
OTHERMALE:Oh, yes, ma'am, I'm single.
SUPMALE:You know, if it wasn't for Mindy taking in strays, I would never have a place to be.
LEADFEMALE:I just wanna thank you for bringing her into this world.
LEADMALE:Do I love her? Well I wanna give her everything I have and spend the rest of my life with her.
SUPMALE:Is that love? You know, it's kind of funny that I had to come millions of miles to find something deep inside of me.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder if she feels the same way.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I guess you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I should ask her myself.
SUPMALE:Thank you, ma'am.
LEADMALE:Thank you very much.
OTHERMALE:I like you too.
SUPFEMALE:That's what I would've said to your mom.
LEADFEMALE:I had a feeling you were trying to say something to me too.
OTHERMALE:Mork, was my mother really here? She told me to give you something.
SUPFEMALE:I love you, Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:I love you too, Mork.
SUPMALE:
