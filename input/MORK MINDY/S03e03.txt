LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi, Glenda Faye.

OTHERFEMALE:How far you going? - Denver.
LEADFEMALE:- Denver? No, thanks, Glenda Faye.

LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, l was sorry to hear about your loss.

OTHERMALE:Look at me.
LEADFEMALE:My wife is in real estate.
LEADFEMALE:One day, she said she found the perfect home for me.

SUPFEMALE:Peter, guess what.
SUPMALE:My friend Mork is here.

LEADMALE:- lt's fun.

OTHERMALE:Oh, Mork, it's so sad.
SUPFEMALE:You know, people don't wanna play around here anymore.
LEADMALE:But l'm working on them.
SUPFEMALE:Well, my friend Mindy's like that too.
LEADMALE:She's been real sad recently.
SUPMALE:l don't know why people are unhappy when there's so many clowns in government.
SUPMALE:They're unhappy because they grew up.
LEADMALE:But l thought you have to grow up so you can feel guilty and be an adult.
SUPMALE:You may have to grow tall, but you don't have to grow up.
LEADFEMALE:- Can you keep a secret? - Sure.
LEADFEMALE:You know that--? Does he have one wheel in the sand? Well, what's your secret? l'm Peter Pan.
LEADMALE:Peter Pan? But you sign all your letters Peter Panovski.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's just a cover.
LEADFEMALE:Nobody's left out there that believes in Peter Pan.
SUPFEMALE:- Why not? - See, l'm the real Peter Pan.
SUPMALE:You know? Oh, wait one millibleam.
OTHERMALE:You mean the Peter Pan who could fly, lost his shadow, was chased by Captain Hook, got swallowed by the alligator that had clock in his stomach? - Yes.
SUPFEMALE:- What's not to believe? Oh, Mork, you believe it's me.
LEADFEMALE:You believe in me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, wait.
LEADMALE:Wait one minute there.
LEADMALE:l'm not just some shucker.
LEADFEMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Peter Pan was a boy who never grew up.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's me.
LEADMALE:The little guy's still inside.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and it sounds like he's got gas.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you've made my day.
OTHERMALE:Oh, who am l kidding? You made my life.
SUPMALE:Somebody believes in me.
OTHERMALE:Where l come from, everybody believes in you.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, where's that? - Well, it's l come from a place far, far away, where the plants are as intelligent as the people and the sky is yellow and brown.
LEADMALE:Pittsburgh? No.
SUPFEMALE:What would you say if l told you l come from a planet called Ork? l'd say, ''Welcome.
LEADFEMALE:'' At last.
SUPMALE:You know, where we come from, we say, ''Na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:'' Oh, what does that mean? Well, it's a lot nicer than the old greeting.
SUPMALE:- Which was? - ''Yo, lizard thighs.
LEADFEMALE:'' l love laughter.
LEADMALE:You know, l tried to get everyone to laugh here at least once a day.
SUPFEMALE:Sid's two years behind.
LEADFEMALE:My friend Mindy's the same way.
LEADFEMALE:She's so depressed recently.
LEADFEMALE:See, that's why l came and got you so we could both make her happy.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's been a long time since l've been out there.
LEADMALE:You know, it's scary.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, don't worry, because you're with me.
OTHERFEMALE:l'm your pen pal.
LEADFEMALE:We'll fight them off with a couple of quills.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPMALE:Okay, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Peter, aren't you forgetting something? Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:What's the matter, Pete? l'm sorry, Mork.
OTHERMALE:l can't go home with you.
SUPMALE:Why not? The house is pretty clean and l make a great hot fudge tortilla.
SUPMALE:You don't understand.
SUPFEMALE:l can't leave.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's against the rules.
LEADMALE:Okay, everybody, it's time.
OTHERMALE:Pete, l mean, you gotta come.
LEADMALE:l'm-- But-- - Leave it to me, leave it to me.
OTHERMALE:- Peter? Ma'am, you don't understand, you see, Peter has to come home with me and see Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, l'm sorry, but this is where he belongs.
OTHERFEMALE:Gee, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:l'd like to help Mindy, but l can't.
SUPFEMALE:Will you come visit me soon? Sure.
SUPMALE:Ma'am, how come he can't get out? You have to understand, Mork, they must be locked in at night for safety.
OTHERMALE:Oh, so they don't bump their wings.
OTHERMALE:Yes, this too is true.
SUPMALE:Hello? Oh, hi, Julie.
LEADMALE:What? You got a scholarship? Well, how sweet and thoughtful of you to call and tell me.
SUPMALE:Anybody else get one? Who? The Rebozo twins? Well, that makes me twice as happy.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, Julie, thanks for calling me and giving me all the good news.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the ride, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Rebozo.
OTHERMALE:And congratulations to the twins.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, two heads are better than one.
LEADMALE:Oh, how we feeling? Terrible.
SUPFEMALE:l seem to be the only one who hasn't heard about the scholarship.
SUPMALE:lt's not looking good, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:How was your day? Did you have fun with Peter? Oh, not bad.
LEADFEMALE:- l have a question l'd like to ask you.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah? Why do they lock some people up? - Why do you ask? - l don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Why? Why you paranoid? l'm not paranoid, are you? Well, l'm just a little curious about Earth customs, that's all.
LEADFEMALE:Well, they usually lock people up because they commit crimes.
LEADFEMALE:What if they didn't commit a crime? Then they should be set free.
LEADMALE:Wheels are turning.
SUPMALE:A little justice must be done.
LEADMALE:- Pardon me.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
LEADMALE:You see, Mork, sometimes life on Earth isn't always fair.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you mean like earthquakes demolish cities, floods wipe out homes.
SUPFEMALE:The Rebozo twins get the scholarship.
SUPFEMALE:l think l'll go lie down and count the sparkles in my ceiling.
SUPMALE:Oh, poor Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Adult life can really be tough sometimes.
OTHERFEMALE:lf only Peter Pan were here.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:This is a job for Morky Bell.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, Mork, maybe l shouldn't.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's against the rules.
SUPFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:No, come on, see? We're gonna break out, see? Don't chicken on me, see? Over the wall, see? We're gonna get out of this pig house.
LEADFEMALE:Now come on.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, Mork, Mork, no.
LEADFEMALE:Happy Valley isn't a prison.
LEADMALE:lt's, you know, a funny farm.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean a place where they grow jokes.
LEADMALE:No, no, no.
OTHERMALE:lt's where they put people who are different.
LEADFEMALE:And people out there really think l'm different.
LEADFEMALE:l don't know.
LEADMALE:Maybe leaving isn't such a good idea.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, come on.
LEADMALE:Mindy needs you.
SUPMALE:The world needs you.
LEADMALE:Even Disneyland needs you.
LEADFEMALE:But what if she turns out to be like all the others? l put myself in here years ago because people didn't believe in me.
SUPMALE:Why should she be any different? Oh, she'll believe in you.
OTHERMALE:l mean, she believed that l came from outer space in an egg.
LEADFEMALE:- She bought that? - Yeah.
LEADMALE:Come on, come on, Mindy needs you.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:You're going out there? You won't get more than 50 feet before some fink will rat on you.
OTHERFEMALE:Who would do a thing like that? Me.
LEADMALE:You see, you can't trust anybody.
LEADMALE:l trust you, Sid.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Pete, you make it hard on a fink.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe it's time l started trusting people out there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you mean you're gonna do it? Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, l love you, you big pixie.
SUPMALE:Mork, Mork, what about the grill? Step back.
OTHERFEMALE:Big deal.
LEADFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADFEMALE:lt might be faster if we flew.
SUPMALE:A little for me.
OTHERMALE:Now think lovely thoughts and fly! l think that fairy sold you some bum dust, Pete.
SUPMALE:Mork, what is it? Oh, Mind, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Don't worry about your troubles.
LEADFEMALE:They've been tackled.
OTHERFEMALE:Sacked by ''Mean Mork'' Greene.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? l haven't heard about the scholarship yet.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't worry about that.
SUPFEMALE:l got you something even better than the scholarship.
LEADFEMALE:Peter, come on down.
LEADMALE:Peter? Your pen pal spent the night? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:He's here right now.
OTHERFEMALE:What are you doing? Quiet, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:He understands.
SUPMALE:Mindy McConnell, meet Peter Pan.
LEADMALE:Oh, Peter Pan.
LEADMALE:Any relation to the real Peter Pan? Well, actually, l am the real Peter Pan.
LEADFEMALE:And l bet you live in Never-Never Land.
LEADMALE:No, l moved.

LEADMALE:Happy Valley? You mean, the ment? The asyl? Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, can l talk to you for a minute? Pardon me.
LEADMALE:Mork, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:We've got big trouble here.
SUPMALE:- Right here in River City? - No.
LEADMALE:Mork, Peter has got to go back to Happy Valley.
LEADMALE:l thought you said people don't have to be locked up.
SUPFEMALE:No, you misunderstood.
OTHERFEMALE:Peter Pan isn't real.
OTHERFEMALE:lt's just a fairy tale.
LEADMALE:l knew she wouldn't believe.
OTHERMALE:Oh, give her a chance, Pete.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mind, you believe in me.
SUPMALE:Why don't you believe in him? Because you really are Mork from Ork and he's right here in my apartment.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Problems only seem big if that's all you look at in life.
OTHERMALE:- Yeah, but-- - Crow.
LEADMALE:- Crow? - Yes.
SUPFEMALE:ln Never-Never Land, whenever we're feeling really good inside, we crow like a rooster.
SUPFEMALE:Colonel Sanders, watch out, huh, Mind? Come on, Mind.
LEADMALE:Don't be all cooped up.
LEADFEMALE:Take a flying chance.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:l don't think that l could possibly-- Oh, come on, Mindy.
LEADMALE:You'll forget your worries in no time.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, l appreciate what you're trying to do.
LEADMALE:l do.
OTHERMALE:But l have to answer the phone.
SUPMALE:- lt's no use.

SUPFEMALE:No, l see.
LEADMALE:You only have so many scholarships.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:Maybe l'll try again next year.
SUPMALE:No, no, no.
LEADMALE:l'm not upset.
LEADMALE:There's just one more thing, Dean Johnson.
LEADMALE:l had a little frog in my throat.
LEADMALE:Thank you for calling.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind, if you're ever gonna crow, you should have done it then.
LEADMALE:l mean, you gotta let the little person out, like this: We should have gotten here sooner.
LEADFEMALE:What's the matter? Did Sid spill the peas? No.
LEADFEMALE:l found your letters from Mork, Peter.
SUPMALE:And l had an idea you'd come here.
SUPMALE:Fly, Peter, fly.
OTHERFEMALE:- Open the window first.
SUPFEMALE:- No, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Open the window.
SUPMALE:- No.
SUPMALE:No, Peter.
SUPFEMALE:Don't jump.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, don't fly away.
LEADFEMALE:We need you, Peter.
SUPFEMALE:You cheer people up so.
SUPMALE:Even Sid misses you.
LEADFEMALE:Sid misses me? - And you know what he said? - No.
LEADMALE:What? He said that you were his very best friend.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what should l do? l don't know.
SUPMALE:lt's up to you, kid.
LEADMALE:Oh, l have to go back.
SUPFEMALE:l mean, those people have problems, big problems, and l can help them.
OTHERMALE:Like the old saying, there's no place like the home.

LEADMALE:l'm sorry, Mork.
LEADMALE:lt didn't work.
OTHERMALE:Mindy's still sad.
SUPMALE:Come on, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:lf you ever had to crow, do it now.
OTHERFEMALE:For yourself, for Pete.
LEADMALE:l can't.
LEADMALE:l feel ridiculous.
LEADMALE:You've been miserable.
SUPFEMALE:What have you got to lose? - Mork, l can't.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mindy, why don't you enjoy what you have instead of worrying about what you haven't? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Do it for me.
LEADMALE:Well, do it for the little person inside of you.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:No, no.
SUPMALE:Give it some gas, honey.

LEADMALE:l can teach you how to do that too.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that's awful thoughtful of you, Peter.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork, thanks.
LEADMALE:Oh, shucks.
SUPMALE:l really do feel much better.
LEADFEMALE:l really do.
LEADMALE:Even though you didn't get the scholarship? Well, you know, l've been thinking.
LEADMALE:l don't need a degree to prove that l'm good enough.
LEADMALE:l'll go out and get a job without it.
SUPMALE:So what if it's a little scary? Well Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:l forgot to say thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Listen, l better get back.
LEADMALE:They're looking for me around the corner.
SUPMALE:See you next visiting day.
LEADMALE:l don't believe it.
SUPMALE:We're on the second floor.
LEADFEMALE:He flew up here.
LEADFEMALE:l know.
LEADFEMALE:Did you help him do that? Do you really wanna know? - No.
LEADFEMALE:- Me either.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Five, six, seven.
SUPFEMALE:Come on, Bebo, follow the steps.
SUPFEMALE:- Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Five, six, seven-- Yes, sir.
SUPMALE:Why are you doing the Funky Orkan? Well, sir, that's because l have a terminal case of Peter Panitis.
LEADMALE:Peter Panitis? What's that? Sir, it's the only disease that's better than the cure.
LEADMALE:You know, l found out this week that some people on Earth take life too seriously.
LEADFEMALE:l mean, they worry too much.
LEADMALE:- That's easy for you to say, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:You get to observe Earth and have fun while l'm on Ork doing all the work.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Your Kvetchiness.
SUPMALE:l mean, you can have fun anywhere.
SUPMALE:There's a little child inside of all of us that needs to be let out.
LEADFEMALE:See? Hi, hi, how are you? Come on, let him out.
SUPMALE:All you have to do is a little of this.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, try this: Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Being silly doesn't change anything, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, sir, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Give it a try.
SUPMALE:Just a crow, a little crow.
LEADFEMALE:Croquette.
SUPFEMALE:Enough of this nonsense.
OTHERFEMALE:- l have work to do.
LEADMALE:- Aye, aye, sir.
SUPFEMALE:That's the ancient version of ''arr, arr,'' sir.
LEADMALE:Or ''aye, aye,'' sir.
LEADMALE:That's the Christmas version of ''arr, arr.
OTHERFEMALE:'' But until next week, sir.
SUPMALE:Come on, Beeb.
SUPFEMALE:That's all right.
SUPMALE:We failed.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry about it.
OTHERMALE:Crowing, how ridiculous.
SUPMALE:l got you, sir.
LEADFEMALE:l knew you'd try it.
OTHERMALE:l was just coughing, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sir, one piece of advice.
LEADMALE:Don't take anything for that cough.
SUPMALE:Until next week, sir.
LEADMALE:l knew there was a little person inside of all that fat, Bebo.
