LEADFEMALE:That's why I want to interview him for KTNS.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I have to go through his manager, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Morra.
LEADMALE:I see.
LEADMALE:Well, could you have Mr.
LEADMALE:Morra's secretary return my call? Okay, very good.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:I wonder if Woodward and Bernstein had this much trouble trying to get to Nixon.
OTHERFEMALE:How do you like these new threads, Mind? Aren't they incredible? Do you think it's more Sears or GQ? - What are you so dressed up for? - It's picture day at the daycare centre.
LEADFEMALE:- How do I look? - Oh, you look real nice.
SUPFEMALE:Except don't forget to hold in your stomach.
SUPFEMALE:- What are you dressed up for? - I've got a big interview today.
LEADMALE:- How do I look? - Oh, real nice.

LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Menachem Begin.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Give up? Yeah, I don't know who it is.
LEADMALE:Who is it? Who, who, who, Mind? Robin Williams.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Robin Williams.
LEADMALE:What's so funny about that? Does he really call himself Robin? Well, yeah.
LEADMALE:Do you know what robin means on Ork? No.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's disgusting.
LEADMALE:Don't look at me.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't give him that smutty name.
LEADFEMALE:His parents must have had a sense of humour, though, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I can't believe you've never heard of him.
SUPMALE:He's a comedian.
SUPMALE:He's a star of TV, movies and nightclubs.
SUPFEMALE:In fact, he's in town right now doing a big solar energy benefit.
LEADMALE:Well, I still don't know what the big deal is, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you want to talk to him? Well, a lot of people on Earth are real interested to hear what stars have to say.
LEADMALE:I'm waiting for his manager to call me back to set up an appointment right now.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you Iook a Iittle bit Iike him.
LEADMALE:Me-o? Yeah, you-o.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna get his album.

LEADMALE:Scoff, scoff.
LEADMALE:I mean, April Frinkle's Day.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mork, you look exactly like him.
LEADMALE:Oh, now, come on now, Mind, look at that there, look at that.
SUPFEMALE:He looks like he does his hair with a Cuisinart.
LEADMALE:And he's got a road map for eyes.
LEADFEMALE:You could pack a family in that nose, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Look at that mouth too.
LEADMALE:They had to airbrush his entire face.
SUPFEMALE:Are you kidding? Mind, listen, I'm bright and cheery.
LEADMALE:This guy's got big problems.
OTHERFEMALE:Where is the interview with Robin Williams? Well, I've been having a little trouble with that.
SUPMALE:He won't return any of my calls.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, how do you reach someone who's inaccessible? Inaccessible? Last night, Mr.
LEADMALE:Williams dropped in to the Comedy Cabaret and performed for nothing.
SUPMALE:Well, how was I supposed to know? Well, even I knew about it.
SUPFEMALE:I heard it from Armondo.
SUPFEMALE:Who's Armondo? The fellow fumigating my office.
LEADMALE:He got to see one of Robin Williams' shows? No.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Williams mentioned it to Armondo today over lunch.
LEADMALE:Robin introduced himself to everyone at DaVinci's Restaurant.
OTHERMALE:He was at Remo and Jeanie's restaurant? Oh, friends of yours? Not anymore.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll get that interview somehow.
LEADMALE:- You can count on me.
LEADFEMALE:- Good.
LEADMALE:The owner of the station is putting pressure on me.
OTHERFEMALE:And you know how I handle pressure.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, Mindy.
SUPMALE:Done with this? No.
OTHERFEMALE:Jeanie, I'm mad at you.
LEADMALE:At me? Why? What did I do? You knew I've been trying to get an interview with Robin Williams.
OTHERFEMALE:He was here yesterday and you didn't call me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mindy, I am really sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It was crazy in here.
SUPFEMALE:It was-- Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Could you forgive me? Oh, all right.
OTHERMALE:Hi, scouts.
SUPFEMALE:What's going on? The place is so crowded I had to park in the back.
LEADMALE:Yeah, me too.
OTHERMALE:Robin Williams came in here for lunch yesterday.
SUPMALE:Everybody's waiting for him to come back.
SUPFEMALE:How tacky.
SUPMALE:Mindy, what are you doing here? Tackily waiting for him to come back.
SUPMALE:Could you come over? We have a lot of customers.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:This is a new experience for me.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy McConnell, I'm ashamed of you.
LEADFEMALE:Hanging around here like some kind of groupie.
SUPMALE:Now, that hurts, Nelson.
OTHERMALE:I'm supposed to interview Robin for the station.
OTHERFEMALE:And it seems like everybody in town has met him except me.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm sure you're exaggerating.
SUPMALE:Hey, guys, did you see these Polaroids they have of me and Robin Williams? That's us.
LEADFEMALE:There's Robin and Jeanie.
LEADMALE:There's Robin and Armondo.
LEADFEMALE:You know, the bug guy? Good picture.
LEADMALE:The bug man gets to meet Robin Williams.
LEADFEMALE:I should have taken fumigation in college.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I have to go.
LEADMALE:I'm getting a headache.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, is she upset.
LEADMALE:Yeah, look at this one.
SUPMALE:Picture of Robin autographing the chopped liver with his finger.
LEADMALE:I'm having this one Perma Plaqued.
LEADMALE:Good penmanship.
OTHERFEMALE:Look, he made a happy face in the O.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:For the owner of the car with the New Mexico license plate, please claim your car at the bottom of the hill.
LEADFEMALE:You forgot to set your handbrake.
LEADMALE:Look, everyone, it's Robin.
SUPMALE:Robin! My name is Mork.
LEADMALE:Watch your language.
OTHERFEMALE:Robin! So that's Robin Williams, huh? You know, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but he looks a little bit like Mork.
LEADMALE:You're right.
SUPFEMALE:I think you're crazy.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, look, they caught him.
SUPMALE:No big deal.
LEADFEMALE:With the money he makes, he can afford new clothes.
OTHERMALE:They really shouldn't toss him up in the air like that.
LEADMALE:Well, tell Mr.
OTHERMALE:Williams that Barbara Walters called.
OTHERMALE:And when he calls back, he should ask for my secretary, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Come on in, Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
SUPMALE:Where'd she go? Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen, did you just come from lunch? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:And l know you can't tell it, but I had two or three little drinks.
LEADMALE:And do you know why? Why? I knew I was in trouble when Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Ovitz, the woman who owns the station, plied me with drinks at lunchtime.
LEADFEMALE:She said if we don't get the interview, I'm out.
SUPFEMALE:And if I'm out Guess who's going with me? Me.
LEADMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:You.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Sternhagen, I have tried everything.
LEADFEMALE:- I tried lying.
OTHERFEMALE:- That's good.
LEADFEMALE:- And I tried bribery.
LEADMALE:- Oh, that's real good.
SUPFEMALE:I even went as far as trying to buy tickets to his concert so I could sneak backstage to meet him, but they're sold-out.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you're in a predic-- You're in a predic-- You're up a creek, kiddo.
LEADMALE:The same thing happened to me in New York when I was big in the network.
LEADFEMALE:The president said I had to deliver someone or I was out.
SUPMALE:I was out.
OTHERMALE:Well, what did you do? Does this look like New York here? Well, I gotta get go-- I better go.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna leave now.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mr.
LEADMALE:Sternhagen.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes? Did you drive? Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:That's my little beauty parked out there in your hedge.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I don't think you should drive.
LEADFEMALE:I think you should take a little nap.
OTHERMALE:I can do that while I'm driving.
SUPMALE:No.
SUPMALE:Why don't you come with me? I think you should go right in there.
SUPMALE:Well, will you please fix me some cookies and warm bourbon? - Don't panic.
SUPFEMALE:- I'm not panicking.
SUPFEMALE:You have no reason to panic, Mind.
OTHERMALE:They're not after you.
SUPFEMALE:Who's after you and why? The entire town, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:They know I'm an alien.
LEADFEMALE:They chased me.
LEADMALE:They tore my clothes.
LEADFEMALE:They pursued me with fountain pens.
LEADFEMALE:Just because I'm different doesn't make me a bad guy, does it? I mean, I say my prayers, I pet my vegetables.
OTHERFEMALE:I put my pants on like everybody else, headfirst.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, how could they find out you're an alien? I don't know.
LEADMALE:I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:But they called me filthy names.
LEADFEMALE:Did they call you Robin? That's disgusting.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, they think you're Robin Williams.
LEADFEMALE:Who? Robin Williams, the guy who looks like you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you mean that bozo on the album? Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, Mind, I don't look anything like him.
SUPMALE:They know I'm an alien.
SUPMALE:They're onto me.
LEADFEMALE:If they catch me, they're gonna tar and feather me and put me on That's lncredible! They'll put me on that.
OTHERFEMALE:l'm telling you, they think you're Robin Williams.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, now, assuming you're right-- Which I think you're way off base.
OTHERMALE:You're like in left field going, ''Where am I? Where am I?'' --would they tear Robin Williams' clothes off? - Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:- But you told me they liked him.
LEADMALE:Well, they do.
SUPMALE:That's why they want his clothes.
OTHERMALE:And if they didn't like him, boy, he'd be in real trouble.
SUPMALE:He'd be jacked up on four blocks with nothing left but his kneecaps.
SUPFEMALE:Well, it's not quite like that either.
LEADMALE:Why don't you come with me tonight? You'll see how much you look like him.
OTHERFEMALE:I've gotta go to the auditorium and try to interview him.
LEADMALE:- It's my last shot.
OTHERFEMALE:- What are you gonna do, Mind? Oh, hang around the stage door till he shows up.
LEADMALE:Like some groupie? Exactly.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I'll go with you as your escort, but I've gotta get disguised, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I tell you, they're onto me.
LEADMALE:They know I'm an alien.
OTHERMALE:Mork, I wish you'd take off the silly-looking glasses.
SUPFEMALE:It's a perfect disguise, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Everyone thinks I'm from L.
LEADMALE:A.
LEADFEMALE:Watch this.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, sir.
LEADMALE:I just want you to know that there are no aliens from outer space in this area.
LEADFEMALE:- For sure.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
LEADMALE:Your disguise is starting to attract attention.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you'd be much less conspicuous if you'd take off the nose, pull down your hat and turn up your collar.
OTHERFEMALE:- Trust me.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind.
SUPFEMALE:- Trust me.
OTHERFEMALE:- But, Mind - Do you trust me? - Oh, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:- For you.
LEADFEMALE:- There.
LEADFEMALE:Look, it's him, Robin Williams.
SUPFEMALE:Stay back.
SUPFEMALE:Break it up.
OTHERFEMALE:Right this way, Mr.
SUPMALE:Williams.
LEADFEMALE:No, wait.
SUPMALE:I'm with him.
LEADMALE:- Is she with you, sir? - Trust me, Mind.
LEADMALE:- I've never seen this woman in my life.
OTHERMALE:- What? Just kidding, officer.
LEADMALE:It's actually my brother.
SUPFEMALE:He likes to dress up a little bit.
LEADMALE:Come along, Roland.
LEADMALE:Here's your dressing room, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Williams.
LEADFEMALE:If there's anything I can do, let me know.
LEADMALE:Yeah, a new pair of retinas would be very nice, please.
LEADFEMALE:Hard to believe you get paid for that.
LEADMALE:Do you believe it, Mork? We're in Robin Williams' dressing room.
LEADFEMALE:And we're about to meet him.
LEADMALE:I don't know what the big deal is all about.
SUPMALE:Are you kidding, Mork? People stand in line for hours just to get a glimpse of a star, let alone meet one.
LEADMALE:And we're about to meet a big star.
LEADMALE:Poor little starstruck Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Now, calm that perky little heart of yours.
LEADMALE:Don't you understand that a star's just a big ball of glowing hot gas? He's just an ordinary human being who's been hyped by an advertising campaign.
LEADMALE:Personally, I'd rather be at home right now flossing my ears.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:You know, you look a lot like No, he's a woman now.
OTHERFEMALE:Excuse me, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Williams, but I have a big, big, big favour to ask of you.
OTHERFEMALE:I know you don't know me and I don't wanna impose, but I'm supposed to get an interview with you for KTNS, and if I don't, I'll be fired.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:This has been a bad year for her.
LEADFEMALE:She bet on Carter, Roberto Duran and she had to buy Chrysler stock too.
LEADMALE:Well, I got a minute.
OTHERFEMALE:My manager's not here.
LEADMALE:And sure, why not? Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You're doing me such a big favour.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it.
SUPMALE:This is my friend, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADMALE:And I'm Mindy McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:You're not from the Enquirer, are you? Pardon me? - Little joke.
OTHERMALE:- No.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, you sure are a hard man to get in touch with.
OTHERFEMALE:You have tighter security than the pope.
LEADFEMALE:She couldn't get past your manager's secretary's secretary's secretary's answering machine.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, would you please? Sorry, Mind.
SUPMALE:I know you've probably been asked this question a lot, but what's it like to be a celebrity? Well, not bad, really.
LEADMALE:It's nice when you get into restaurants at those really chichi places where they wouldn't even let you wash the floors before.
LEADFEMALE:I have another question now, a little fashion byline.
LEADFEMALE:- Why do you wear baggy pants? - I don't want a visible panty line.
LEADFEMALE:There's your headline right there, Mind: ''Robin Williams, kinky.
LEADMALE:'' You're a member of the brotherhood of Bozo.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you wear them? That's where I keep my bees.
SUPMALE:Do you mind? Back off.
SUPFEMALE:Back off, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Williams, I don't know how you keep up the pace.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you arrived from Hawaii, fly all night and then go straight to the university and lecture for three hours.
LEADMALE:Oh, that was a fluke, you see.
LEADMALE:The pilot of the flight I was on has a daughter who attends drama class here.
LEADMALE:He asked if I'd talk to her class to return his favour.
SUPMALE:What was the favour? Well, he said if I'd lecture, he'd pull out of the dive.
LEADMALE:Interesting concept, Mind.
LEADMALE:Blackmail by gravity.
LEADMALE:Write that down.
LEADMALE:That's news, news.
LEADFEMALE:But then after the lecture you performed until 3 a.
SUPMALE:m.
SUPFEMALE:at the Comedy Cabaret.
LEADMALE:And now you're doing two shows tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Well, two reasons: See, I'm a performing addict.
OTHERMALE:I can't get enough of it.
OTHERMALE:Also the owner of the Comedy Cabaret is a friend of a cousin of a friend of a friend and so on and so on.
LEADMALE:- Well, I couldn't say no.
SUPMALE:- Gee, that's a great angle for my story.
SUPMALE:Robin Williams, the comedian who can't say no.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:My dinner flew away.
LEADFEMALE:You mind if I have some of your star munchies? Sure, why not? I was hoping you'd go for the trail mix.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe this man is actually grazing in front of me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, back to you.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry to avoid you.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know why I can't say no.
LEADMALE:I guess I want people to like me.
LEADMALE:I hate myself for that.
SUPMALE:But I used to be able to say no.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what do you mean? Well, before all this craziness started, my friends used to call up and go: ''Robin, come on.
LEADMALE:We're all going outside.
LEADMALE:There's some gnarly waves and we can hang out.
LEADFEMALE:'' And I have to go: ''No, my mama said I have to stay inside and read Nietzsche tonight.
LEADMALE:'' Later on, I guess I felt really afraid to say no to them because then they'd all say like: ''Oh, Robin Williams, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Smarty-Pants-Big-Shot, wow, you forgot your old friends.
OTHERMALE:You can't lend me $1 0,000 for a new car.
LEADMALE:You won't do the Save the Shrimp benefit.
SUPMALE:'' This is none of my business, but it seems like if they're really your friends, they'd understand.
LEADMALE:But it seems to me you can't say no to a total stranger.
LEADMALE:You're right.
OTHERMALE:It also looks like you're probably taken advantage of a lot.
SUPMALE:If you learned to say no, you'd probably have a lot more time to yourself.
LEADMALE:Maybe that's the last thing I want.
LEADFEMALE:Come in.
LEADMALE:- Five minutes, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Williams.
LEADFEMALE:- Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:You didn't get much of an interview.
LEADMALE:I hope you're not disappointed.
LEADFEMALE:Disappointed, are you kidding? You're breaking her perky little heart.
OTHERMALE:Listen, if it means that much to you, tell you what I'm gonna do for you.
LEADMALE:I'll put off my flight.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow morning when my manager's asleep, I'll sneak down to the TV station and do an on camera interview with you.
SUPMALE:You'd do an on camera interview with me? Oh, I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:I was just supposed to write this up and let the anchorman read it.
LEADMALE:Oh, that is so nice.
LEADFEMALE:I can't believe it.
LEADMALE:Oh, wait a minute.
LEADMALE:No, I can't do that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah, that's kind of a bad time for me too.
SUPFEMALE:How about next July? No, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:We were just talking about how you can't say no.
LEADMALE:I'm not gonna be another person just to take advantage of you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't worry about that.
SUPMALE:I'll learn to say no some other time.
LEADMALE:Come on, watch the show from the wings.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me.
LEADMALE:One thing before you go.
OTHERFEMALE:Today I was chased by a mob who wanted to tear my clothes off.
SUPFEMALE:Is it because they say I look like you? Well, there's kind of a resemblance.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like you just went through Celebrity 1 A.
LEADMALE:How'd it feel? Oh, it was frightening.
LEADFEMALE:Why do you want to take a job where they tear your clothes and throw you? Well, actually, I became a performer by accident.
LEADFEMALE:My dad used to have this job where he had to move around a lot.
LEADMALE:Sometimes he'd leave the forwarding address.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he didn't do that.
SUPMALE:No, you're right.
SUPMALE:I was kidding.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, he packed me in the crates with the dishes.
SUPFEMALE:What a guy, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Anyway, I was always being like the new kid in the neighbourhood.
SUPMALE:Well, since I was suffering from a case of the terminal shy, I couldn't make friends that easily.
SUPFEMALE:And I spent a lot of time in my room and I created my own little world, full of, like, all these little characters that had strange, unusual qualities.
SUPMALE:After a while, I realised people found these characters funny and outrageous.
LEADMALE:Then it got to the point where I realised that the characters could say and do things I was afraid to do myself.
SUPFEMALE:And after a little while, here I am.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
LEADMALE:Robin Williams.
LEADFEMALE:We're on.
LEADMALE:Take care.
SUPMALE:Wish me luck.
OTHERMALE:- Good luck.
LEADFEMALE:- Listen to that applause.
LEADFEMALE:Something like that might make torn clothes worthwhile, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's go.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Your Cinerama-ness.
LEADMALE:Just get on with your report, Mork.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:This week, sir, I learned what it's like to be famous on Earth.
SUPFEMALE:That's good.
LEADFEMALE:Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't.
SUPMALE:You see, most Earthlings try very hard to be recognised for what they do, but when they become stars, sir, they realise they're recognised wherever they go.
OTHERMALE:you mean they lose their privacy? Well, sir, sometimes they can even lose their clothes.
OTHERMALE:You see, being a star, sir, is a 24-hour job and you can't leave your face at the office.
LEADFEMALE:lsn't fame its own reward? Oh, yes, sir, it is.
SUPFEMALE:When you're a celebrity, everybody wants a piece of you.
LEADMALE:Unless you can say no, there will be no pieces left for yourself.
LEADMALE:l thought all stars were rich, live in mansions and drive big eggs.
LEADFEMALE:I know, sir, that's the common misconception.
SUPFEMALE:But you see, to get that, you have to pay a very heavy price.
SUPFEMALE:You have responsibilities, anxieties.
LEADFEMALE:To be honest, sir, some of them can't take it.
OTHERMALE:- l'm not buying it, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Why, sir? lt sounds to me like they have it made.
SUPFEMALE:Well, most of them do, sir, but some are victims of their own fame.
LEADFEMALE:Very special and talented people.
LEADMALE:People like Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Bruce, Freddie Prinze and John Lennon
SUPMALE:
