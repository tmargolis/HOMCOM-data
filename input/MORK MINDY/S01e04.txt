LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! Ow.
LEADMALE:Ow.
LEADFEMALE:Eer, ow, ooh.
LEADMALE:Ah, hah, hah.
LEADFEMALE:That's enough.
OTHERMALE:I'll tell you what you want to know.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe you.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you get haircuts on Ork? No, we try to avoid them because of the noggachomps.
LEADFEMALE:"Noggachomps"? What's that? It's a small green creature about this big.
LEADMALE:We put them on our heads and let them graze.
SUPMALE:They're vicious little animals.
SUPMALE:Kind of ( snarling ).
LEADFEMALE:That sounds dangerous.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, only if you fall asleep in the chair.
LEADMALE:Occasionally a maverick will get loose from the herd and run down your neck.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why we have to set traps in our shorts.
SUPMALE:What a horrible system.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, you don't understand Orkan philosophy.
LEADMALE:If something works, don't fix it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, there, you look much better.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPMALE:You're all done.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh, ah, I feels worse, though.
LEADMALE:How much do I owe you? Where did you get the money? I baby-sat for Eugene.
LEADMALE:Here, six big ones.
LEADMALE:Well, you just keep the money.
OTHERFEMALE:The haircut is on me.
LEADMALE:No, it's on me.
SUPMALE:( phone ringing ) Hello? Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Brad.
LEADMALE:( nasally ): Hi, there.
SUPMALE:How are you? Well, it's so nice to hear from you again.
SUPFEMALE:Nice to hear from you, too.
OTHERMALE:I thought you were in law school somewhere.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm out now Ow! Well, congratulations.
SUPFEMALE:No big deal.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh Here, go water yourself.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, sure, that would be fine.
LEADFEMALE:I'd love to have dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
OTHERMALE:All right, 7:30 it is.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, great, I'll see you then.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Mork, I have a date.
SUPFEMALE:Don't tell me June 2, 1852.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean this guy that I really used to like is back in town and we're going to have dinner tonight.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, where are we going? "Where are we going?" Oh, boy.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, you know I've been thinking.
SUPFEMALE:You and I have I think we've been seeing too much of each other lately.
OTHERMALE:Well, then all you have to do is close one eye.
LEADFEMALE:No, I mean, I think you should get out and meet more people.
LEADFEMALE:You know, see more things.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADMALE:Two's company, "we's" a crowd.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
SUPMALE:No, not that, necessarily.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, for your own development you really should get out and meet more people.
LEADMALE:Like who? Are you ready to start the inventory, Cora? Certainly, Fredzo.
SUPFEMALE:And don't call me Fredzo.
SUPMALE:It sounds like a detergent.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Now, let's see, there are one, two, three, four, five, six Meat Loaf albums.
LEADFEMALE:Six Meat Loaf.
SUPMALE:Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:One, two, three, four Nine Bread albums.
OTHERMALE:Nine Bread.
LEADMALE:This isn't an inventory.
SUPFEMALE:It's a grocery list.
LEADMALE:Hi, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, hello, darling.
OTHERMALE:Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:How's the nicest, sweetest, most wonderful father in the world? Suspicious.
SUPFEMALE:Now you think I want something from you? Is that how little you think of your own daughter? Well, as a matter of fact, I have something for you.
LEADMALE:Two free tickets to tonight's basketball game.
LEADFEMALE:You're taking Mork.
SUPFEMALE:That's the nicest thing you've given me since the chicken pox.
LEADMALE:Fredzo, it's only 11:00.
SUPMALE:You're not usually a wiener before noon.
LEADFEMALE:See, Dad, I need Mork out of the house tonight.
LEADMALE:I have a date.
OTHERFEMALE:With a human? That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, well, it won't be wonderful if he comes to pick me up at my place and finds Mork there.
LEADFEMALE:That's why you just have got to take him to that game.
OTHERMALE:But Mindy, I detest basketball.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, but Dad, I haven't had a date since Mork moved in.
LEADFEMALE:Every time the phone rings, I almost hope it's heavy breathing.
LEADMALE:I didn't hear that.
OTHERMALE:Basketball.
SUPFEMALE:How can anybody sit through a game that has so much dribbling? Well, if I can't date other men I guess I'll just have to settle down with Mork and have cute little green babies that drink their formula with their finger.
SUPMALE:Free throw! One-on-one! Jump shot! Dunk shot! I'll go! I'll go! MINDY: That was such a nice dinner, Brad.
LEADFEMALE:Here's to the old times.
SUPFEMALE:Here's to the new times.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Brad, can I ask you something kind of dumb? Sure.
SUPMALE:How come you never asked me out when we were in high school? Because I was a jerk.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, you were.
SUPFEMALE:I wish I'd kept in touch with you, Mindy.
OTHERMALE:You're a wonderful girl.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I am.
LEADFEMALE:Greetings! Mork! ( humming ) What are you doing here? Dribbling.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, is this the guy you used to like? Mork, this is Brad Jackson.
SUPMALE:Brad, this is my friend Mork.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:I'm glad to meet you.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Certainly.
LEADMALE:So is "Mork" your first or last name? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Did you enjoy having food with Mindy? Yes, I did.
SUPFEMALE:So do I.
SUPFEMALE:Everybody enjoys having food with Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:So, did the basketball game end early? I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:After about an hour, your father stopped it.
LEADMALE:My father stopped it? Yeah, he said, "This has gone on long enough.
SUPMALE:" Oh, Mork, what did you do? Oh, lots of things.
LEADMALE:I had a great time.
SUPFEMALE:Ever been to a basketball game? My favorite part was when I got to dance.
LEADMALE:You danced? Oh, yeah, that part at the beginning, where they played the music, everyone stood up and Oh, say can you see? He's a great kidder.
LEADMALE:Then some man asked me to pass him his coffee, so I did.
LEADFEMALE:He didn't catch it, though.
LEADMALE:That's too bad.
SUPMALE:But your father caught it with his pants.
LEADFEMALE:Then it was his turn to dance.
OTHERFEMALE:Then we went to a place called the rest room.
SUPFEMALE:I didn't get any rest there, though.
LEADFEMALE:I had a terrible seat.
LEADMALE:Couldn't even see the game.
LEADFEMALE:We went back and some woman asked me to hold her seat, so I.
LEADMALE:Never mind.
SUPFEMALE:I know, that's when they made us leave.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, are you a friend of the family? No, I live here.
LEADFEMALE:Live here? Oh, Brad, see, it's not what you think.
LEADMALE:Mindy, he lives here with you, and you go out with other men? Oh, yeah, but you see, uh Mork, Brad and I aren't quite finished yet.
SUPMALE:Oh, I see, you're still hungry.
LEADMALE:Mork I'll whip up my special dessert.
LEADMALE:No, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, for you, le monde, mama.
LEADMALE:( barks ) Stay.
LEADMALE:Maybe I should leave.
SUPMALE:No, Brad.
OTHERMALE:No, Brad, stay.
SUPMALE:We'd like to get to know you better.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:( Mork whistling, humming ) You see, Mork and I live together, but I still go out with whoever I want.
LEADMALE:I mean Mindy, I I don't know what your idea of a relationship is, but I-I'm not a swinger.
LEADFEMALE:Well, neither am I.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, swinger.
LEADMALE:Baseball.
OTHERFEMALE:( swishing sound ) How about them Broncos? Brad, I'd really like to see you again.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, we'll get together again.
LEADMALE:Soon.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, wait.
LEADMALE:You missed the bologna sundae.
SUPMALE:Your eyes are leaking.
LEADFEMALE:Are they? That means something has hurt you, doesn't it? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Brad did something, that slimemunger.
LEADMALE:I'll follow him to the ends of the universe.
OTHERMALE:I'll vaporize his entrails.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork.
LEADMALE:It's not what Brad did.
LEADFEMALE:It's that Brad misunderstood our relationship.
SUPFEMALE:That's what made me sad.
LEADFEMALE:Ever since you moved in, guys have stopped asking me out.
OTHERFEMALE:And then when somebody does finally like me, like Brad, well He think that you and I are Lovelings.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:And then when I tell them we're not, they either don't understand or they don't believe the situation, so I end up not going anywhere, I never go out.
LEADFEMALE:I guess I'm feeling kind of lonely.
OTHERFEMALE:It's all because I'm staying here, isn't it? No, it's not your fault.
LEADMALE:It was my idea in the first place to have you move in.
LEADMALE:I just have to work this out.
SUPFEMALE:Night.
SUPFEMALE:( door closes ) Hm.
LEADMALE:Leaking.
LEADMALE:Come on, Mork, get up.
LEADFEMALE:Breakfast.
SUPMALE:What do you want, pancakes? Waffles? Gladiolas? Come on, you lazy Orkan.
LEADMALE:MORK: "Mindy, I know you are sad "because people think you and I are lovelings.
LEADFEMALE:"I don't want you to be sad anymore, "so I'm going away.
OTHERFEMALE:"If people from Ork knew how to love, "I'm sure I would love you.
OTHERFEMALE:"But I don't even understand what love is.
SUPMALE:Love, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:" You're doing that very well, Eugene.
LEADMALE:Grandma Hudson, thank you for letting me work today.
SUPFEMALE:I need the money so I can buy my mom a birthday present.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, that's all right, Eugene.
LEADMALE:What are you going to buy her? The best present in the whole world.
OTHERFEMALE:A catcher's mitt.
LEADMALE:Wow, that's great.
SUPFEMALE:And it'll go so well with those shin guards you gave her last year.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, say, Eugene, uh, call me if any customer comes in.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Guess who? Uh Stevie Wonder? What's happening, Mork?! Hey, plasma, what it is? What you doing with the suitcase? You taking a vacation? That's what I came to talk to you about.
SUPMALE:If you were taking a vacation, where would you go? I've always wanted to see France.
LEADFEMALE:Kay-o; dosvedanya.
LEADFEMALE:Or maybe the Swiss Alps.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, make up my mind.
SUPFEMALE:It depends on how much money you want to spend.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, six smackers.
LEADFEMALE:You can't go to the Alps with six dollars.
LEADFEMALE:Then France it is.
SUPFEMALE:Arrivederci.
SUPMALE:Or France, either.
OTHERMALE:Hey, bummer.
SUPFEMALE:Are you running away? How can you tell? It's written all over your face.
LEADFEMALE:Shazbot I've broken out in words.
LEADMALE:Psst.
LEADFEMALE:Can you keep a secret? I don't want you to tell Mindy where I'm going.
SUPMALE:You see, I've, I've been a lot of trouble to her.
LEADMALE:Man, you aren't going far on six dollars.
LEADMALE:You can't even get a place to sleep unless you stay in a flophouse.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds perfect for a flop like me.
SUPMALE:Well, there are some places on Mission Street.
LEADFEMALE:But they're awful seedy.
SUPMALE:"Seedy.
SUPMALE:" Oh, I love horticulture.
LEADMALE:Hello, Eugene.
LEADFEMALE:Good morning, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:McConnell.
SUPMALE:What's this? Looks like a suitcase.
LEADMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, somebody must have left it here.
SUPMALE:Maybe I better open it up and see if I can find the name of the owner.
SUPFEMALE:( making soft ray-gun sounds ) Good heavens! How did that happen? I don't know.
SUPMALE:( blowing ) I told you never to sit on my throne! I leave you two alone for five minutes, and the whole place goes to pot! You scoff? You don't believe? I tell you, the men from Venus are coming down to take us to their planet.
SUPFEMALE:They arrive Labor Day.
LEADFEMALE:Then they're going to blow up the whole world! And you sit there eating a sandwich? Where's the passenger list? There's only room on the escape ship for and so far we've lined up three.
LEADMALE:Pressure.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been walking the streets all day, trying to find recruits.
LEADFEMALE:My feet are killing me.
SUPFEMALE:Gad, those make my thighs sweat.
LEADMALE:Good-bye.
SUPFEMALE:I saw your signs outside the Friends of Venus? I thought I'd stop by to see if there's anyone here I know.
LEADMALE:Do you know any of the Friends of Venus? I know some people from Venus.
SUPFEMALE:I know one guy who's kind of cute if you're into short and fuzzy.
SUPFEMALE:His name is ( violent sniff ).
SUPFEMALE:Gesundheit.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, that's his name.
SUPMALE:See, he's got a wife and a litter, and their names are ( raspberry, squeak and cheeks flapping ) I'd hate to be the child stuck with a name like ( cheeks flapping ) A believer.
LEADFEMALE:A true believer.
LEADMALE:What's not to believe? You believe in people from outer space? Shazbot.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Precisely.
LEADFEMALE:My name is Exidor.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like you to join me.
SUPFEMALE:Well, if you insist.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:I mean, join our group, be one of us.
SUPFEMALE:Us? Oh Well, right now, you see, I'm looking for a fliphouse to flap in.
SUPMALE:That's flophouse.
LEADMALE:Oh, flip, flop whatever.
OTHERMALE:You can stay here with us.
SUPMALE:We'll all work together.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, work.
SUPFEMALE:I finally got a job and a place to flip out all at once.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mindy will be proud of me.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy.
LEADMALE:Heavy sigh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Daddy, Mork ran away.
SUPFEMALE:You've just got to help me find him.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:well, look, honey, I don't know why he left, but maybe it's the best thing.
SUPFEMALE:No, it's not, Dad! Mork is like a child here.
SUPFEMALE:He shouldn't be out in the world alone.
LEADFEMALE:He has no concept of trouble or danger.
LEADMALE:Oh, Dad, if anything happened to him, ( sobbing ): I don't know what I'd do.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want him to go.
LEADMALE:All right honey, okay, take it easy, take it easy.
LEADMALE:Now, I'll help you find him.
LEADMALE:But where would he go? Oh, I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:I've been looking all morning.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, I just remembered something.
LEADMALE:This morning when I came in, there was a shiny metal suitcase right in the middle of the store.
SUPFEMALE:Mork has a shiny suitcase.
LEADFEMALE:And then the albums fell, and, and Eugene I don't know nothing.
LEADFEMALE:I think we've uncovered a clue.
LEADMALE:Mork, this is my philosophy for the Friends of Venus.
LEADMALE:I want you to study it and memorize it so that you can go out with me and convert the non-believer.
LEADMALE:I'll study hard and let you know when I'm ready.
SUPFEMALE:( high-pitched hiccup ) I'm ready.
LEADFEMALE:Very well, on your feet.
OTHERMALE:Uh let's pretend that, uh, I am a non-believer, and you try and convert me.
OTHERMALE:Hey, you, non-believer.
SUPFEMALE:Good start.
LEADMALE:But we need more power in your voice, and more conviction.
LEADMALE:Oh, I see.
OTHERFEMALE:Frey-und! I have need of your attention.
LEADMALE:Friend, do you realize that the Venusians are coming down to Earth? But they're not coming here on Veterans Day, not on April Fool-es Day, but on Labor Day, Labor Day, Labor Day.
OTHERMALE:Can you hear me, friend? I hear you! Are you ready now? Can I get a nanu-nanu? Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:Thank you, friend.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize, friends, what they're coming here to do? Because they've come down here to blow the Earth to smithereens! But it's not that bad, friend.
SUPFEMALE:Because they're sending a ship down here to save 1,000 of us, and they're making a list, and they're checking it twice.
SUPMALE:Now, friend, now, you can either stay down here, in your disco, drug-infested inferno, or come up to Venus, and have your very own Venusian condominimum, with hot and cold running champagne and underwater dancing.
LEADMALE:You must apply now! Mork! Mork that was beautiful! Why can't you be more like him?! But there's something's missing.
LEADMALE:What we need is more of your experiences with the Venusians here on Earth.
SUPMALE:I didn't meet them on Earth; I met them on Venus.
LEADMALE:You've been there? Oh, yes, I've been to all the planets in your solar system.
LEADFEMALE:Mars, Mercury, Pluto?! Oh, don't ever go to Pluto; it's a Mickey Mouse planet.
SUPMALE:You see, Exidor, I have something to explain to you.
SUPFEMALE:The Venusians aren't coming to blow up the Earth.
OTHERMALE:They're not? No, you see, their technology isn't prepared for space travel.
SUPMALE:It isn't? No, their highest invention so far has been the garbage can.
SUPMALE:It is? And the only reason they invented that was to have something to tip over.
LEADFEMALE:Blasphemy! I had high hopes for you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You're crazy.
LEADMALE:Mork! Oh, what a relief.
LEADMALE:Mindy, I didn't want you to find me here.
SUPMALE:You know, I knew as soon as I saw that Friends of Venus sign, I knew you'd be here.
SUPFEMALE:I want you to come home with me now.
OTHERMALE:No, you don't.
LEADFEMALE:You just say that 'cause you feel sorry for me.
LEADMALE:Mork, I don't feel sorry for you.
SUPMALE:I feel sorry for me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:When I'm not there, you're free to do as you wish.
OTHERFEMALE:You have a home of your own.
LEADFEMALE:No, what I have is an apartment.
SUPMALE:It was only a home when there was somebody in it that I cared about.
LEADMALE:Me? But I get in your way; you told me so.
OTHERMALE:Oh, I know, and I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I was blaming you because guys stopped asking me out.
LEADFEMALE:And then when one did ask me out I know.
LEADFEMALE:I made a real crimluck of myself.
LEADFEMALE:It was my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I'm a woman, and, and a woman just sometimes needs to be held.
SUPMALE:Mmm, that man Brad, you wanted him to hold you.
SUPMALE:Well, not him, necessarily.
LEADFEMALE:I really didn't get a chance to find out.
SUPFEMALE:But yeah, every once in a while a little hug really does help get me through the day.
SUPFEMALE:What's a hug? Oh, you know, like Like like this? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Soft.
LEADFEMALE:I can understand how this keeps you going.
LEADMALE:It's got me going, and I don't even know what it is.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:( humming ) Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Orson I am calling you-oo-oo ORSON: What a terrible connection.
SUPMALE:Sounds like someone stepped on a frenkle's tail.
OTHERMALE:Just me reporting from Earth.
LEADFEMALE:And what words of wisdom are you transmitting across the universe today? I learned how to make a human happy.
LEADFEMALE:I learned how to give a hug.
LEADFEMALE:And a hug is? It's when you wrap your arms around a human's body and squeeze.
OTHERMALE:I thought that's what Earthlings call wrestling.
SUPFEMALE:No, in wrestling, you squeeze a lot harder until they sweat and go "Arrgh!" They don't sweat and go ( grunting ) when you hug them? No, they just cuddle and go "Ah!" Oh, hugging.
LEADMALE:Amazing what pleases the primitive tribes.
LEADMALE:I'll never understand them.
OTHERMALE:But Orson? Yes? It was good for me, too.
OTHERMALE:Mork! Yes, Your Immenseness.
SUPFEMALE:This is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado, until next week.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
