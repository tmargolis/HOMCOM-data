LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! Orson calling Mork.
LEADMALE:Come in, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Orson calling Mork.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork, activate your receiver mode and come in, please.
OTHERFEMALE:Orson, you never call me.
OTHERFEMALE:What's up, sweetheart, darling, baby? I have something very important to tell you, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, don't tell me you've got some heavy news.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) Mork, I'm calling to tell you you're about to have a birthday.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:My first? Now don't panic.
LEADMALE:Everything will be just fine if you do what I say.
LEADMALE:Why'd it have to happen to me? Couldn't someone else have had my first birthday? Calm down! ( blow landing ) Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:I needed that.
LEADMALE:Every Orkan has to go through this.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, meet your gleek.
SUPMALE:Gleek? Now, on your birthday, you'll begin to run down.
LEADMALE:You'll speed up, you'll slow down.
SUPMALE:You'll have trouble talking.
LEADFEMALE:You'll act weird uh, uh, excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:You'll act weirder.
LEADMALE:Don't shake the gleek! You'll deactivate the chemicals.
SUPFEMALE:Sorry, Your Fattitude.
LEADFEMALE:That gleek must be in perfect working order when you hit it against your head to recharge yourself.
LEADFEMALE:No problem, Your Immenseness.
LEADMALE:I'll guard it as if my life depended on it.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, your life does depend on it.
LEADMALE:Whew! No pressure.
SUPFEMALE:Well, sir, I've got to be going.
LEADMALE:I've got a new job at a place called a kennel.
LEADFEMALE:It's populated with creatures just like Venusians, only smarter.
OTHERFEMALE:Lucky you speak Venusian.
LEADMALE:Ah, you bet.
SUPMALE:( growling and barking ) ( howling ) ( whistles ) I just can't believe it.
OTHERMALE:It's so good to see you again.
LEADMALE:I know.
SUPFEMALE:Three months is too long for friends like us to be apart.
LEADMALE:Did you know that if we were snails, we'd already be dead? So much has happened, Joyce.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:Like my name isn't Joyce anymore.
OTHERFEMALE:It's Rainbow.
SUPMALE:Do you want some coffee? No, I never drink caffeine.
LEADMALE:Oh, well, how 'bout a soft drink? Mindy, sugar is suicide.
OTHERFEMALE:Can you drink water? It's got fluorides in it.
LEADMALE:Well, what can you drink? Do you have a beer? Doesn't beer have chemicals in it, too? Yeah, but after a six-pack, who cares? Good point.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, other person.
LEADMALE:Mork, I want you to meet my good friend, Rainbow.
LEADMALE:Rainbow, this is Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and double it.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
OTHERFEMALE:I like him already.
LEADMALE:You know, I get so tired of that hippie handshake, you know, and those people who keep saying the same boring clichÃ©s.
LEADMALE:So, by the way, what's your sign? I think Mork's a moon child.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, Mindy, you know moon children are only this big with mold on their heads and terrible acne.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, how'd your first day at the kennel go? Oh I don't know why they call it work, it was so easy.
LEADFEMALE:They told me to take the dogs for a walk, and I could see they could walk by themselves, so I let them out.
SUPFEMALE:I told them to be back by midnight.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, they'll never come back.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yes, they will.
LEADMALE:They promised.
SUPMALE:Well, Mork, you might as well not go back to work at the kennel tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:He's been having a hard time finding a job.
LEADMALE:Really? Mm-hmm.
LEADMALE:Well, you know, I run a health food store, and I've been looking for a revolutionary moon child stock boy.
SUPFEMALE:How would you like to try it? Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Does a Martian have eight legs? ( singing in Orkan ) Whoa.
SUPMALE:I still respect you.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, none for you until you finish that bologna sandwich I gave you the other day.
LEADMALE:When I think of all the starving plants in Asia.
SUPFEMALE:What? You don't eat meat? Oh, you're a humanitarian.
OTHERMALE:What? Then I'll fix you a salad next time.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Might be somebody you know.
LEADFEMALE:( singing in Orkan ) ( singing in reverse ) ( singing in slow motion ) Shh.
LEADFEMALE:Shh.
SUPMALE:( imitates race car driving ) There's the phone.
SUPMALE:Shut up! I know what it was! Give me a chance! I don't know who that is.
LEADFEMALE:Get him off.
OTHERFEMALE:Whew! I'm okay.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
LEADFEMALE:Everybody off! Everybody off! ( laughs ) Hello.
OTHERFEMALE:Good-bye, hello, good-bye.
LEADMALE:Jive turkey.
LEADFEMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:I need my recharge.
LEADFEMALE:I need my gleek.
SUPFEMALE:( speaking Orkan ) Gleek, gleek.
LEADFEMALE:Ah.
LEADMALE:Whew! Oh, my little gleek.
SUPFEMALE:( beeping ) Gleek, don't fail me now.
LEADFEMALE:( beeping ) ( groans ) What's wrong, are you dumb? Hmm? No, it's not time to recharge yet.
SUPFEMALE:I've got two more hours.
SUPFEMALE:I'd better set my watch.
LEADMALE:Ankle watch, set, set.
LEADFEMALE:Ankle watch still ticking.
SUPFEMALE:Gleek, I can't let you out of my sight today.
LEADFEMALE:If I do, I'd be up the Milky Way without a paddle.
LEADFEMALE:( whistling ) Mindy, get the phone.
LEADMALE:( squeaks ) I told her.
LEADFEMALE:Be quiet! Hello? There's nobody there.
SUPMALE:Same thing happened to me.
SUPMALE:Phone again.
SUPMALE:Shut up! I heard it! Get at the phone.
LEADMALE:I will! ( singing in Orkan ) Listen, dirtball, I've had it up to here with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah? ( beeps ) to you, too.
SUPMALE:Mork, will you stop kidding around? What's that? It's a rope.
SUPFEMALE:What's it for? Well, it serves a very important purpose.
SUPMALE:( snoring ) I can't remember what for, though.
LEADFEMALE:Are you all right? I think so.
LEADMALE:I had trouble sleeping last night.
SUPFEMALE:I tossed and turned, which is not very easy, considering I sleep hanging from a bar.
LEADMALE:Well, if you're tired, why don't you go crash for a while? I'm not into pain, but I think a nap will do.
SUPMALE:Mindy! What? Mindy, I remember what the rope is for! Oh.
LEADFEMALE:It's an old Orkan custom.
LEADFEMALE:You see, when we want to remember something, we tie a rope around our neck.
OTHERMALE:Oh, we do the same thing, except we tie a little string around our finger.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, on Ork, that's how we used to hang cattle rustlers.
LEADMALE:Well, terrific.
LEADMALE:Now, what were you supposed to remember? Mm I can't remember.
LEADMALE:I forget.
LEADMALE:I I bet I know.
LEADFEMALE:What? Today's your interview at the Vitamin Vendor.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Now I don't have to get ring around the rope.
LEADFEMALE:That's something very important.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you for reminding me.
LEADMALE:I know it's important to you, so good luck.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, don't do tricks like that at your interview.
LEADMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:You can count on me.
SUPFEMALE:Ciao.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Something's wrong.
LEADFEMALE:I ( moaning ) Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Either I'm sick, or I'm in Pisa.
LEADMALE:I'm all right now.
SUPFEMALE:Hold on, I must be sick.
LEADFEMALE:Let me see.
LEADFEMALE:No fever.
OTHERFEMALE:Wish I could remember what I'm supposed to do.
LEADMALE:Play back old tape.
LEADFEMALE:( clicking tongue, beeps ) Plants.
SUPFEMALE:Head back to plants.
LEADMALE:Plants are the clue.
LEADFEMALE:You still haven't eaten that bologna sandwich I gave you earlier.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you've got to eat so you can grow up and be big and strong like your father, Fern.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait! Food! Food.
LEADFEMALE:Gleek.
SUPMALE:Gleek! Ah, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, good for you.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, if I forgot my gleek, that'd be a disaster if I fail to recharge myself.
LEADMALE:If I don't recharge, I might slow down, I speed up, my memory goes.
LEADMALE:I slow down, I speed up, my memory goes.
OTHERFEMALE:Wow, dÃ©jÃ  vu.
OTHERMALE:I feel like I've been here before.
OTHERMALE:I wish I could remember what I'm supposed to do.
SUPFEMALE:God, I got to remember.
SUPFEMALE:What am I talking about? I don't know.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a chance.
LEADFEMALE:You signed the contract.
SUPFEMALE:( ringing ) Ha, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:You're not going to get me with that old phone trick.
OTHERMALE:Come in.
OTHERMALE:Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:( register chimes ) Thanks.
SUPFEMALE:My violin sounds a lot better now, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Hudson.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I knew it would once I shook your pet turtle out of it.
SUPMALE:Well, the lesson's over, and I'm going to lunch.
SUPMALE:Oh, enjoy it.
SUPMALE:Where you going to go? That new continental cafe.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Chez Eddie? Is that place any good? Of course.
LEADMALE:All the French truck drivers eat there.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess I have to hang around here.
OTHERFEMALE:My mom doesn't pick me up for another hour.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Well, I'll give you a ride home.
LEADMALE:Okay, on one condition.
LEADMALE:This time, you don't pop any wheelies.
LEADFEMALE:So long, folks.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, have a nice lunch, Gram.
LEADFEMALE:Your grandmother is always out to lunch.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, what are you doing here? I thought I had an interview.
LEADMALE:You do, at the Vitamin Vendor.
LEADMALE:I don't feel too well, especially when I left the house.
SUPFEMALE:I Well, you look fine now.
LEADMALE:Well, it comes and goes.
SUPFEMALE:Are you all right? Oh, certainly I'm all right.
LEADMALE:( caws ) Pull! ( imitates gunshot ) Daddy, I think he might need a doctor.
LEADMALE:Uh, he's asleep standing on his feet.
LEADMALE:Is that normal for him? Not at all.
SUPFEMALE:Normally, he sleeps hanging from a bar.
SUPMALE:Charley, I could've been a contender.
LEADMALE:Feelin' good now Punchin' meat now Suckin' eggs now.
LEADFEMALE:You know something? I think you're right.
LEADFEMALE:I-I'm going to go get that doctor.
SUPFEMALE:He's out here in the mall.
LEADMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Mork? Huh, what? Whoa, who took my bones? ( alarm buzzing ) Oh, your foot's ringing.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get it.
SUPMALE:Don't answer it.
SUPFEMALE:They'll just hang up.
OTHERFEMALE:It's your ankle-watch.
SUPMALE:( turns off alarm ) What's this piece of paper? Must be a footnote.
SUPMALE:It says, "Dear Mork, just a reminder.
LEADFEMALE:"If you don't use your gleek, "you'll be dead in one hour.
LEADMALE:Love Mork.
SUPFEMALE:" Whoa.
SUPMALE:Oh! Mork, what's a gleek? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:Well, what did you mean when you said you were going to be dead in one hour? I don't know.
SUPFEMALE:I heard that somewhere, though.
LEADMALE:In that note.
LEADMALE:Why did you write that note? What note? Oh.
SUPFEMALE:This note.
OTHERMALE:Look, it's in your own handwriting.
LEADMALE:( muttering ) I'm going to be dead.
LEADMALE:Oh, I miss me.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, I'm gonna die.
LEADMALE:Heavy sigh.
LEADMALE:Anxiety.
LEADFEMALE:Anger mixed with inner turmoil.
SUPMALE:Oh no, I'm seeing my whole life flash before me.
SUPMALE:( buzzing sound ) No big deal.
LEADMALE:I've got so much to do.
SUPFEMALE:There's only an hour left.
SUPMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:( humming ) Wait.
OTHERFEMALE:At last, a cure for acne.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to thank the Academy.
OTHERMALE:No one helped me get this award.
LEADMALE:I Mork, what are you doing? I've only got an hour left, Mindy, and I I want to reach for all the gusto I can.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mork, oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, if only there were an hour and ten minutes.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Mindy, what are you doing after the funeral? Oh, Mork, stop.
LEADFEMALE:No, don't stop me now.
LEADFEMALE:I'm full of real zest for life! Oh.
LEADMALE:( moans ) Listen, sit down.
SUPMALE:Daddy went just across the mall.
SUPFEMALE:He's getting a doctor, so Why, is he sick? No, you're sick.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I can't be.
LEADFEMALE:I've got to go to that interview.
LEADFEMALE:Forget that interview.
LEADMALE:Forget what? Here he is.
OTHERMALE:MINDY: Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, there.
SUPMALE:I'm Dr.
OTHERFEMALE:Ducky.
SUPFEMALE:Where's my little patient? That is not a child.
LEADMALE:What kind of a doctor did you say you were? I'm Dr.
SUPFEMALE:Benton Phillips, uh, pediatrician.
LEADMALE:It was either him or the foot doctor.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Don't worry, Miss.
LEADFEMALE:I am a professional.
LEADFEMALE:I'll just take his temperature.
LEADFEMALE:Open for Mr.
SUPMALE:Mercury.
OTHERFEMALE:You die, bwana.
LEADMALE:( blows air ) ( muttering ) What do you think's wrong with him? Well, he's obviously very hyperactive.
LEADMALE:And somewhat sluggish.
LEADMALE:That's not possible.
LEADMALE:What's that? Oh, it's Benny the Bunny ( silly voice ): and his magic stethoscope.
OTHERMALE:I use it on the children.
LEADMALE:But don't worry, it works just like a real one.
OTHERMALE:( high-pitched scream ) You see what I mean? Either I have a defective bunny, or this man's heart has stopped.
LEADMALE:Mindy, I guess it's time we told him.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, we can't.
SUPMALE:We pro Well, we have to, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:It's his life.
LEADMALE:Tell me what? Doc, well You see, Doctor, he hasn't been here long.
SUPMALE:He's a He's an alien from another planet.
LEADMALE:Let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:You're trying to tell me that I have been examining a man with no heartbeat who has a temperature of 63 degrees and comes from another planet, hmm? You got it.
SUPFEMALE:I've got no time for practical jokes.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know how you tampered with my instruments, but my Mr.
SUPMALE:Mercury and my bunny were working before I came here.
SUPFEMALE:And nobody makes a fool of Dr.
SUPMALE:Ducky.
OTHERMALE:Daddy, what are we going to do? Oh honey, now take it easy, take it easy.
LEADFEMALE:Everything is going to be all right.
LEADMALE:I'll think of something.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess the only thing left is we'll just call an ambulance.
SUPMALE:See, I told you I'd think of something.
OTHERMALE:Now honey, everything is going to be all right.
OTHERFEMALE:The ambulance will be here in one minute, and don't worry about a thing.
LEADMALE:They'll run through every red light in Boulder to get here.
LEADMALE:Hello, this is an emergency.
SUPFEMALE:A man is dying.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I'll hold.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, he's gone! What? That-that's ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Where did he go? Well maybe he went back to the apartment.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:Let's check it out.
LEADFEMALE:Or he might have gone to that interview at the Vitamin Vendor.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why would he go there? He's only got an hour to live.
SUPMALE:Daddy, his mind isn't working right, and he's dying to get a job.
SUPMALE:Oh, why did I say that? Will you look at me? Look, if you can't handle drugs, don't do them, okay? What do you mean, I don't give a hoot? It's just ( doorbell tinkles ) Oh.
SUPMALE:we'll rap later.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Here about the job? No.
LEADFEMALE:What are they saying? I can dig your whole essence.
OTHERMALE:I can get right into your space where you're coming from and where you're at.
OTHERMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Is it quitting time? I don't feel too well.
OTHERFEMALE:Maybe it's a nutrition thing.
LEADFEMALE:Like, maybe your potassium is in an imbalance with your blood sugar.
LEADMALE:You know, when that happens to me, I go straight for a Snickers bar.
LEADFEMALE:( doorbell tinkles ) There's a customer.
LEADMALE:Now I want to see you wait on him.
LEADMALE:How long should I wait? Time is money, and money is relative.
SUPFEMALE:Just see what he wants.
LEADMALE:Wow, reality what a concept.
LEADFEMALE:( quickly ): What do you want? Uh, do you have any wheat germ? I hope not.
LEADMALE:Everybody off! My doctor says that I need to get more iron.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, what do you suggest? Eat your car keys.
LEADMALE:Uh, do you have any clover honey? Oh, I'll check, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Never mind.
LEADFEMALE:I'll-I'll just get some vitamins.
LEADMALE:Um, I need some "A.
LEADMALE:" Aay! Uh, B-l2.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:( imitates airplane flying, speaks Japanese ) Too big for this store.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh, Miss? I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:My friend's biorhythms are the pits today.
LEADMALE:Look, could, uh, I just have a bottle of Vitamin "A"? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, will you go over there and get the bottle with the green pills? K.
SUPFEMALE:O.
SUPFEMALE:So, anyway, I feel that in addition to vitamins, a person should get a lot of exercise.
LEADMALE:Like, I'm into transcendental tennis.
LEADFEMALE:Transcendental tennis? Yeah, we don't believe in actually hitting the ball.
SUPFEMALE:We just kind of relate to the Look, could you please hurry it up? ( slow motion ): Okay ( jabbering quickly ) ( pills falling on ground ) ( spastic groaning ) Shut up, Amy! I don't know if it was my fault! Here's one.
LEADMALE:No, no.
SUPFEMALE:If this is what vitamins do to you, I'm going back to junk food.
OTHERFEMALE:( doorbell tinkles ) Thanks.
LEADMALE:Come again.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I think there's something really wrong with you.
LEADMALE:( quickly ): Oh, no, nothing's wrong with me.
LEADFEMALE:You see, everything's Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Gleeks! Everything's brown gleeks! Everything's Brown Gleeks that's my favorite Rod McKuen album.
LEADMALE:Gleek! Recharge! Gleek! Mork.
LEADMALE:Mindy.
OTHERMALE:Rainbow.
LEADMALE:Gleek.
LEADMALE:Oh, help me get him to the car.
LEADMALE:He's really sick.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
LEADMALE:Not the Vitamin Bender, the Vitamin Vendor.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, that's "V" as in "vendor," "E" as in "ender," "N" as in "nn-der.
OTHERMALE:" Oh, I've been trying to reach you.
OTHERMALE:Why did you bring him here? I thought you'd take him straight to the hospital.
LEADFEMALE:He insisted on coming home.
SUPFEMALE:He says he has to find something.
LEADMALE:Something called gleek or Gleek! Gleek! ( imitates bloodhound barking ) ( barking stops ) ( barking resumes ) ( moans ) Oh, oh.
SUPFEMALE:Got him? Yes.
LEADMALE:All right, let's get him to the couch.
SUPMALE:Easy.
LEADMALE:Oh Right on the couch.
SUPFEMALE:Gleek.
LEADFEMALE:Need gleek.
LEADFEMALE:We've got to find out what a gleek is.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:What time is it? Uh, it-it's almost 1:30.
LEADMALE:( groans ) Oh! Oh! If we don't find out in ten more minutes, he doesn't stand a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Chants? On, no.
SUPMALE:( chanting ): Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna FRED: Uh, Mork, come on now.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, settle down.
SUPFEMALE:Take it easy, Mork.
SUPMALE:( snorts, squeaks ) Mork, remember you're sick.
OTHERMALE:Come here.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, there goes my sense of direction.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:( mumbling ) Grab him.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
SUPMALE:I saw this once in a TV show.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! It worked.
LEADMALE:Mork, you've got to help us.
LEADFEMALE:What is wrong with you? It's my birthday.
LEADMALE:( gasps ): Oh no, it's his birthday! What's wrong with having a birthday? I don't know.
LEADMALE:What is wrong with having your birthday? On Ork, a birthday comes only every 2,000 zymes.
SUPMALE:When it does, our bodies go shazbot, and we get the gorgles.
LEADMALE:Gorgles? Are these gorgles contagious? On, no.
SUPFEMALE:There just like what you earthlings call dying.
SUPMALE:( gasps ) Mork, you have got to tell us what a gleek is.
SUPFEMALE:( slowly, slurring ): Energy source.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Recharge.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, what does it look like? ( speaking slowly and unintelligibly ) Oh, no.
SUPMALE:Now his voice is going.
LEADMALE:Mork, you've got to tell us what a gleek looks like! Give us a clue.
LEADMALE:How big is it? ( mumbling ) ( clucking ) I think he's trying to tell us something.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I feel like I'm in a Lassie movie.
SUPFEMALE:( clucking and squawking ) A-A gleek is a-a chicken? ( squawking ) ( clucking ) It's a bald chicken.
LEADFEMALE:A bald chicken.
SUPFEMALE:N-No, no.
SUPMALE:An egghead.
LEADMALE:It's an egghead! ( squawks ) It's an egg.
SUPFEMALE:A gleek is an egg.
LEADMALE:It's an egg.
SUPFEMALE:( squawking ) I know.
SUPFEMALE:I found an egg I found an egg on the counter this morning, and I put it in the refrigerator.
LEADMALE:Okay, now Mork, Mork, look, don't worry.
LEADFEMALE:After you get your gleek, your gorgles will be gone.
LEADMALE:I can't believe I said that.
LEADMALE:Mork, which one is it? Yeah, come on.
SUPMALE:( weakly mumbling ) Uh, gleek.
LEADMALE:Oh! Gleek.
SUPFEMALE:Let me get something straight.
LEADMALE:He's from a more advanced society? Gleek! Gleek! Gleek! Gleek! Oh! Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Gleek! Gleek! Gleek! ( beeping ) Gleek! Mork? Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:( grunting ) Greetings.
SUPFEMALE:Any calls for me while I was out? Oh! MORK: Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: Did you make it through your birthday, Mork? Oh yes, sir, but they threw a very strange ceremony for me.
OTHERMALE:You see, Mindy made me a cake, and then it caught on fire.
SUPFEMALE:What did you do? You know me, sir, semper paratus.
LEADMALE:I stomped that sucker right out, boy.
SUPMALE:Ha, ha! Good work, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Thank you, sir.
SUPMALE:Well, now that you're getting older, you're going to have to settle down.
SUPFEMALE:Since I've been on Earth, I'm not a bleemager anymore.
LEADMALE:Does that mean I have to get boring? Not boring, Mork, just more like me.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'd better keep having those zeppelins for breakfast then.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) I mean it.
LEADMALE:Stop acting like a child.
LEADFEMALE:You have to start calming down.
LEADMALE:Au contraire, Mon Grandiose.
LEADMALE:The dullest people on Earth are the ones who think that they have to calm down and set a pattern for themselves as they grow older.
LEADMALE:And that pattern dictates what they should be.
SUPMALE:It gives them very little freedom to be who they are.
LEADFEMALE:But everyone knows that as you grow older, you become more serious.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, but isn't it true, sir, no matter how many years you have, you have to keep just a touch of the child in you? A little bit of the "mondo bozo.
SUPFEMALE:" And you never feel old.
SUPFEMALE:So until next week, this is Mork signing off.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
