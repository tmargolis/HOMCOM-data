LEADFEMALE:( groans ) Why do we feel sorry for Dad? Business is the pits.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, and on top of that, the water pipe broke in his house and flooded the entire living room.
LEADMALE:That's too bad, because the wet look is out.
OTHERFEMALE:Yes, but it's no fun trying to wring out a wet couch.
LEADMALE:Yeah, and it cost almost $3,000 to repair the plumbing and dry out all the furniture.
LEADMALE:Say, Mindy, do you know where those invoices are for the records? Oh, yeah, we ran out, but there's more in the back.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADMALE:I'll show you where they are.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mork, could you kind of watch the store while we're back there? Whoa! Oh! Like to buy a record? No, I'm just kind of browsing.

SUPFEMALE:Uh uh, excuse me, but who are you, and how do you know who I am? Well I, uh, saw the, uh, front of the store that said "McConnell's Music Store," and ( clears throat ): well, he, uh, told me your name.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't mention her name.
LEADMALE:Well, you implied it.
OTHERFEMALE:Ooh, a psychic.
SUPMALE:Well, how do you know where I live? Well, it was kind of a hunch.
LEADFEMALE:Could you excuse me for just a moment? ( clears throat ) Here's the deal I'm actually from the Boulder Evening Sun.
LEADFEMALE:Clint Mullet, ace reporter.
LEADMALE:You don't act too much like a reporter.
SUPMALE:Well, actually, I'm just Clint Mullett, ace copy boy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, copy boy, a clone! I'm working on a story so big no other reporter would touch it.
OTHERMALE:It's the biggest cover-up since the Greenbrier Scandal.
LEADFEMALE:I never heard of that.
LEADFEMALE:You see? My editor was so scared when he saw my first few pages, he threw the whole story in the trash.
LEADMALE:How does Mindy fit into your trash? Good question, boy.
LEADMALE:All right, it seems that a few months ago, you were up at Boulder Lake with one Bill Mason.
LEADFEMALE:How do you know that? Did you see anything unusual that night? Like what? Well, UFOs? Oh, what? You know, flying saucers? Flying saucers.
SUPFEMALE:( honking bark ) You don't believe in them, do you? You don't? No, I'm into flying eggs.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Flying saucers, don't make me laugh.
OTHERMALE:( laughing ) ( honking bark ) Now, look, 12 people in your area reported seeing glowing flying saucers.
LEADFEMALE:Now, it was a dark night.
LEADFEMALE:My question is, why didn't you see any glowing objects? Mindy, these are the wrong invoices.
LEADMALE:Um, all right, Grandma.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:What was your name again? Uh, Clint Mullet, the next Lou Grant.
LEADFEMALE:Listen, it was really nice getting to know you, and if I remember that I saw a flying saucer, I will let you know.
SUPFEMALE:Tell you what, save some coffee for Tuesday, all right? Right.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, that was a close call.
SUPMALE:CORA: Mindy! I'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:( half-whispers ): I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:I sensed it, I felt it.
SUPFEMALE:She knows something.
LEADFEMALE:She knows something.
LEADFEMALE:She knows a lot of things.
LEADFEMALE:She watches Rona Barrett.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Did she ever talk to you about a strange creature from another planet? About one, no.
LEADMALE:You know, I'm into aliens.
LEADMALE:You like science fiction? Hey, sci-fi's my life.
LEADMALE:It is? Did you ever read Tales of the Milky Way? I skimmed right through it.
LEADFEMALE:And you talk about these kind of things with Mindy? Sure thing.
LEADFEMALE:Hmm.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you and I have got a lot in common.
OTHERMALE:We ought to get together, have some lunch Talk about outer space, alien beings Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:Does this mean we're going to be friends? Oh, you betcha, pal.
LEADFEMALE:You know, if my theory is right, there's probably an alien right here in Boulder.
SUPMALE:So, be on the lookout for anything strange or unusual.
LEADFEMALE:You bet.
SUPMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:Do you realize what a close call that was? Guess what? Clint wants to be my friend.
LEADMALE:Are you crazy?! Of course he wants to be your friend.
SUPMALE:You're the one he wants.
SUPFEMALE:I know that, but there's an old Orkan phrase "The best place to hide from the enemy is right under his noses.
LEADFEMALE:" Oh, but Mork Mork, what if he finds out that you? ( humming ) Uh that you don't read the Boulder Evening Sun? Then he won't be my friend? He might not.
LEADFEMALE:Then I better run out and buy a copy right now.
OTHERMALE:Hello! Oh, that boy really wigs me out.
SUPMALE:( laughs ) I love him.
LEADMALE:What's the matter, dear? Is something wrong? Well, there was this crazy reporter in here, and he thinks that men have landed from outer space.
LEADFEMALE:And he thinks that I know something about it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh! Of all the crazy wieners.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, now, don't you worry, dear.
SUPFEMALE:If he comes back again, I'll kick him right in his Sunday supplement.
LEADFEMALE:( horns honking ) ( tires screeching ) ( horns honking ) Oh! Wow, it's a lucky day.
SUPMALE:Mindy, look! ( screams ) What happened? He almost got hit by a bus.
SUPMALE:Mork, you should know better than to walk out into the street before looking.
LEADFEMALE:If you hadn't pulled me out from in front of that bus, I'd be dead meat right now at Boot Hill.
LEADMALE:Well, Mork, it was no big deal.
LEADFEMALE:I just happened to be there.

LEADFEMALE:I owe you everything.
LEADFEMALE:But anybody would have pulled you out from in front of that bus.
LEADMALE:Not on my planet.
SUPMALE:You see, no one would even care.
LEADFEMALE:They don't even have emotions on my planet.
LEADMALE:What's it like, not having any emotions? Well, it's a real bummer.
LEADMALE:But being with you makes me happy.
LEADMALE:( phone rings ) I'll get it! Oh, no, no, no! No, I'll get it.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, no Ah too late! I'm there! Daddy's residence.

LEADFEMALE:Out! Is there anything else I can do for you? Wax your violin? Hose down your organ? Out! ( clinks ) ( clinking ) Aah, aah! ( yells ) ( honking bark ) Great game.
LEADMALE:Now it's your turn.
LEADMALE:( sighs ): It's you.
LEADMALE:It's M Mork.
LEADMALE:Mork! Mork, how did you get in here? Well, I saw you come up through the ladder, so I hid.
SUPMALE:Tag, you're it.
LEADFEMALE:You're toying with me, aren't you? You can see right through me.
LEADMALE:No, you're opaque.
LEADMALE:Come here, Mork.
LEADMALE:Listen, Mork, I'm convinced that Mindy knows something about these UFO sightings.
LEADMALE:So, I'm over here snooping around for some clues.
LEADMALE:Clues? Like what? Well, you know, Mork, a clue could be anything, you know? It could be big, it could be small But it takes a trained eye to spot a real clue, my friend.
SUPMALE:Sometimes, they can even be right under your nose.
LEADMALE:I have the same theory.
SUPFEMALE:No kidding.
LEADMALE:Well, one day, you may be an investigative reporter like me.
LEADMALE:For instance, what's this? Oh, I Looks like some kind of folder, doesn't it? Yeah.
SUPMALE:And there's something written on it, too.
SUPMALE:Hi, Mork.
LEADMALE:Oh, uh hi, uh, Clint.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello, Mindy.
SUPMALE:This is my father, Frederick.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Dad, this is the reporter I was telling you about.
LEADMALE:I have evidence here that leads me to believe that Mindy knows an alien the leader of a planet Orch? Uh-oh, confusion, fear, look of cold terror.
LEADMALE:Yes, it's right here.
LEADMALE:It says it uh "Orch Leader.
LEADFEMALE:" I don't believe it.
LEADMALE:This is my father's music.
OTHERFEMALE:That's O-R-C-H Orch.
SUPMALE:It's an abbreviation for "orchestra leader.
LEADMALE:" It's music for the local high school.
SUPMALE:Sure.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, Clint, you lose again.
LEADMALE:Better start all over again and come through the window.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, you came through my window? Did you break in here? Not actually All right now, buddy.
SUPFEMALE:You've gone over the line.
LEADMALE:I'm calling the cops.
OTHERFEMALE:Cops! I know that game.
LEADFEMALE:Freeze! Nobody move! ( imitates static ) and one Caucasian male.
SUPFEMALE:Hello? This is an emergency.
SUPMALE:Some man has just broken into my apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he broke into my apartment, and he's here right now Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Hang on just a second.
OTHERFEMALE:What's this? Uh, never mind.
SUPFEMALE:Uh This looks to me like some kind of space helmet.
LEADFEMALE:Space helmet! Does this look like a space helmet? This is my planter.
SUPMALE:Well it doesn't look like a planter to me.
SUPFEMALE:Now look, you're starting to get on my nerves.
SUPFEMALE:So, why don't you just leave my apartment, and I don't ever want to see you around here again.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, just a second.
LEADFEMALE:Hang on everybody, okay? I've got a little admission to make.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, now, you're all familiar with the newspaper The American Inquirer? Good.
LEADMALE:Well they're offering a $25,000 reward for proof that there's an alien being living on Earth.
LEADMALE:Now, here's the proposition.
LEADMALE:Listen close.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you the money.
LEADMALE:All I want is exclusive rights to the story.
LEADMALE:All I want is the fame.
OTHERMALE:Tell you what.
LEADMALE:All you have to do is get me proof that there's an alien being here on Earth, and the money's yours.
LEADFEMALE:FRED: Who ever thought I'd be guest conductor for a high school band? ( giggles ) Well, who knows? Maybe somebody will hear me and see me, and hire me to conduct some real music, huh? Yeah, wouldn't it be nice? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I know you could use the extra money.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I sure could use that $25,000 reward.
LEADFEMALE:Dad! Oh, honey, honey, don't worry.
LEADMALE:I wouldn't turn Mork in.
SUPFEMALE:I have to admit, that's an awful lot of money.
LEADMALE:I don't even know what I'd do with that much.
LEADMALE:I know what I'd do.
LEADMALE:I'd pay off the plumbing bills, and I'd still have enough left over to get the store back on its feet, or at least on its knees.
LEADMALE:Yeah, having that much money sure would be nice.
LEADMALE:Well, it's pointless to even think about it.
SUPFEMALE:We can't turn Mork in.
LEADMALE:I know, I know.
LEADMALE:We just have to be happy with what we are and what we have.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I guess I'd better get home and help Cora with the clarinet parts.
LEADMALE:It's going to be a long night.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'll go with you and help out.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, honey, you've done enough, as it is.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, don't even worry about it, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:If I help, you two can get to bed a lot sooner.
SUPMALE:Hey, Mork, I'm going to go over to Dad's for awhile, so I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERMALE:See you.
SUPMALE:Well, it is getting late, so I think I'll hit the road.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, honey.
LEADFEMALE:All right, I'll see you tomorrow, Dad.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:Good night.
LEADFEMALE:Night.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh! Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Uh what are you doing here? I've thought it over, and I think I'll turn myself in for that reward.
SUPFEMALE:Well, why would you want to do a crazy thing like that? So I can give you the money.
LEADFEMALE:What? Well, see, I have to pay you back.
SUPMALE:Mindy's my friend, and especially you, because you saved my life.
SUPMALE:And I know you need the money really badly.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mork, everybody needs money.
LEADMALE:That's right.
OTHERMALE:You don't have to do a thing like that.
LEADMALE:Well, I want you to be able to go back to college full time, and I want you to be able to put your business back on its knees again.
LEADMALE:Mork Mork, that's very generous of you, but you don't know what kind of a price you'd have to pay.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, you just don't know what they'd do to you.
LEADFEMALE:Your life wouldn't be your own anymore.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, I have an idea.
LEADMALE:They'd make me a celebrity, movies Oh, eventually I'd end up on Hollywood Squares in a box.
OTHERFEMALE:( imitates Paul Lynde ): Disgusting! Yeah, and that's just the good part.
LEADMALE:Really? Yeah, you wouldn't have any privacy anymore.
SUPMALE:I mean, just think, little children will be following you around, saying, "Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:" Yes, and adults will be walking up and saying, Shazbut.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, if and if they only knew what that meant.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I mean, think about it! They'd come out with dolls, games! Oh, it could be awful! It would be like living in a zoo! They may stick you in a bottle.
LEADFEMALE:A bottle.
LEADMALE:My grandfather was a bottle, and he died a broken man.
LEADFEMALE:You know, there's a chance, too, that we would never see you again.
LEADMALE:They make you invisible? No, but they'll take you away.
LEADMALE:Oh, looks like my future is no bed of raisins.
LEADFEMALE:I want to help my friends, but I don't know what to do.
LEADFEMALE:Whew, I got to think this one under.
SUPFEMALE:CORA: Frederick! Cora! What's the matter? Somebody better call for a plumber.
SUPFEMALE:And I'll go back and start bailing.
OTHERMALE:Well, that settles it.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, well, Mork, tell the plumber to come here right away, that it's an emergency.
SUPFEMALE:( beeping ) Hello, Clint? Mork here.
LEADMALE:If you want to see a real live alien being, be at Mindy's house at noon tomorrow.
OTHERMALE:Be there or be square.
LEADMALE:'Bye.
LEADMALE:Now, what's the number of the plumber? ( knocking ) MORK: Come in.
LEADMALE:Mork, where are you? I'm up here.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right down.
LEADMALE:Where is he? Where is the alien? He's getting dressed.
SUPFEMALE:What a day for mankind.
SUPFEMALE:What an event in the history of the universe.
LEADFEMALE:What a break for my career.
LEADFEMALE:I can see it now.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be in Washington two years from now.
LEADFEMALE:The President, he'll call me.
LEADFEMALE:"Clint, we need you, you're a good man.
OTHERFEMALE:" ( imitates fanfare ) I am Mork, from Ork, sent by my superiors to observe your primitive civilization and report back.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPMALE:You called me here for this? Red pajamas and silver boots? You look like a reject from the O'Jays.
SUPMALE:But I'm a member of a superior civilization, really.
LEADMALE:Mork, come on, I know you need the money, but Wait! I can prove it.
LEADFEMALE:Watch.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll make that plant rise into the air.
SUPMALE:( whistling ) ( crash ) Butterfinger.
LEADFEMALE:I don't perform well under pressure.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, this is silly.
LEADMALE:I'm splitting.
LEADFEMALE:This is ridiculous.
SUPMALE:Wait! How many people do you know that can drink with their finger? I'm sorry about this.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get back to you.
OTHERFEMALE:( whistling ) ( whistling trails off ) Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:( burps ) How did you do that? Greetings.
LEADMALE:I am Mindy, Catwoman from Mars.
LEADMALE:( meows ) Mindy, what are you doing? I was sent here to observe your primitive planet.
LEADMALE:But that's my job.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm the only alien here.
OTHERMALE:MINDY: Of course you're an alien.
LEADMALE:I'm an alien.
SUPMALE:We're all aliens.
OTHERFEMALE:I am Fredzo from Scherzo! Somehow, I feel alienated.
OTHERMALE:I have been sent down here to observe your primitive society and demonstrate my great powers.
LEADFEMALE:Here, pick a card, any card.
SUPMALE:Clint, I don't know how to tell you this, but they're jiving your socks off.
LEADMALE:Who else could do this? Watch this pitcher.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched whistling ) How do you like them eagles? Big deal.
LEADMALE:Move aside, boys.
LEADFEMALE:Watch this.
LEADMALE:( humming ) Did you see that? Just a second.
LEADMALE:Hang on just a second.
LEADFEMALE:There's a wire here.
LEADFEMALE:This whole thing is rigged.
LEADMALE:Oh well, Mork, he found us out.
LEADMALE:Shazbut! Shazbut! Look, I just want to say that, uh, you are the most unconvincing group of aliens I have ever seen in my life.
LEADMALE:And, uh, Mork, you are the worst.
SUPFEMALE:The next time you try and impersonate an alien, why don't you just leave the pajamas home? I refuse to be made a fool of.
SUPFEMALE:Too late.
LEADMALE:It's a real space suit.
OTHERFEMALE:I paid 50 trivets for this in New Ork.
SUPFEMALE:Now you'll never get the money you need for the store.
SUPMALE:Well, we won't get it from finking on you.
SUPMALE:We've been down before, but we'll get out.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, we always have before.
LEADMALE:Anyway, Mork, I don't want to lose you.
LEADFEMALE:And besides I've grown accustomed to your honk! Why did you do that, when you needed the money so really badly? Oh, you don't understand.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, you're more important than any amount of money.
LEADMALE:You can't buy friendship.
OTHERFEMALE:So, even if I had turned myself in, it would have been for nothing.
OTHERMALE:That's right.
LEADFEMALE:And you saved me from that.
LEADMALE:Well yes.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you ( muttering ) thank you, thank you Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson! ORSON: I hear you, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Whoa! What are we going to talk about this week? Believe it or not, Your Immenseness, my value on the Earth market is $25,000, or 100 yen.
LEADFEMALE:How much is that in grebbles? Oh, a measly 0.
LEADMALE:3.
SUPMALE:Money seems to be important to Earthlings.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you bet your sweet shobow.
LEADMALE:They put it in a place called a "bank.
LEADFEMALE:" What happens at a bank? Well, you bring in your money.
SUPMALE:It meets other money, mates, and makes more money.
LEADMALE:Also, this money seems to have a certain rubber-like quality, because you can bounce a check, or stretch a dollar.
LEADFEMALE:Can anyone get money from the bank? No, only the rich, and those with proper identification.
SUPMALE:Also, a bank will only lend you money to buy a boat, or a big car, not to buy food.
OTHERMALE:Why is that? I guess food's harder to repossess.
LEADMALE:We will store that information, Mork, even though it's from you.
SUPMALE:Thank you, Your Immenseness.
SUPMALE:By the way, don't take any wooden grebbles.
LEADFEMALE:This is Mork, signing off until next week.
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:
