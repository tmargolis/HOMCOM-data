LEADMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Min? Oh, Min? Min? Min? Hi.
SUPMALE:I'm just filing my nails.
OTHERMALE:Well, I bet you file them under N, huh? Well, I have a little surprise for you.
LEADMALE:Don't worry.
LEADMALE:What's that? Let me show you.
OTHERMALE:This here.
OTHERMALE:Heh-heh-heh.
LEADMALE:What is that? ( grunts ) Well, it's the tinfoil collection of the kids at the daycare center.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) Kind of looks like a meteor from the planet Alcoa, doesn't it? ( giggles ) Yeah.
OTHERMALE:I can't think of a better job for you than being a group leader for a bunch of kids.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I am kind of an expert in the field.
LEADMALE:Would you believe this? Some people say I'm rather childlike myself.
SUPMALE:( chuckles ) Well, that's news.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:( knocking on door ) Race you! Ha-ha-ha! Hello, Mork.
LEADMALE:Hi, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Hi, Nelson.
LEADMALE:Nice ball of tin.
LEADFEMALE:May I take your coat? I've always liked it.
LEADMALE:Ar-ar.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Well, some, uh, interesting development has transpired, and I'm proud as a peahen.
OTHERMALE:I'm gonna give a speech on television.
LEADMALE:( gasps ) You're kidding! That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I've worked very, very hard on it, and I, uh, wanted to get your reactions to it, what you think about it.
OTHERFEMALE:Sure.
LEADMALE:Well, it looks nice from here.
LEADMALE:Nice crease.
SUPMALE:A little albino origami, huh? I think he wants to read it to us, Mork.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, dopey moi.
SUPMALE:Okay, go ahead, Nelson.
SUPFEMALE:( clears throat ) "What has happened to America? "People have been asking that question a lot lately.
SUPFEMALE:"That's why I've decided to look for a solution.
LEADFEMALE:"You see, I sense that if there were a solution, "or solutions, "the energy that went into asking that question "could be channeled into the search for other solutions to other questions.
LEADMALE:" ( snoring ) MINDY: Mork! That was my grabber.
LEADMALE:( gasps ) Oh.
LEADMALE:Bravo.
LEADMALE:Author, author.
SUPMALE:I just Just started.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Um, how much longer is that? It runs for a full hour.
SUPMALE:Want me to read faster? You got a full hour on television? Well, my, uh, opponents in the upcoming election were on a televised debate.
SUPFEMALE:Somehow I was snubbed.
LEADFEMALE:I suspect that the station manager is like this with the other 12 candidates.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:So you got equal time from the FCC? Mind, you don't have to spell it.
OTHERFEMALE:We're all adults here.
OTHERMALE:The only snag is Is that, uh, they gave me 7:00 Saturday morning.
SUPMALE:Not exactly a prime-o time-o.
LEADFEMALE:Not exactly? There's nobody watching TV except kids.
SUPFEMALE:I'm hoping that they like what I say about America and how to fix her, and then they'll tell their parents to vote for me.
LEADFEMALE:Nelson, I don't think that a political speech is exactly what kids want to listen to.
SUPFEMALE:Well, you could always do it in a chicken suit.
OTHERFEMALE:If you want the kids to pay attention to you, you've got to talk about something they're interested in.
LEADMALE:I don't know what kids want to hear.
LEADMALE:Hang, it's been years since I was a cute little tyke.
LEADMALE:Tell you what.
OTHERMALE:I can help you out.
LEADMALE:I could go to the daycare center and ask the tykes and tykettes what they want to see on Saturday morning besides, ( high-pitched voice ): "Yah! Whoa!" ( as Porky Pig ): "Ba-dee-ba-dee-ba-dee-ba-dee, that's all folks.
LEADFEMALE:" I appreciate that, Mork.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot.
SUPMALE:Mindy, don't let him go.
LEADMALE:He's one special guy.
OTHERMALE:Yes, he is.
SUPFEMALE:Well, see you later, Nelson.
SUPMALE:Okay, see you guys later.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:Ta-ta.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADFEMALE:Well, Mind, I was gonna take that up to the attic, unless you would like it as a little knickknack or a tchotchke.
LEADMALE:Well, Mork, my knickknack shelf has a one-ton weight limit.
SUPFEMALE:I wanna know how you'll get that upstairs.
LEADMALE:It was no trouble bringing it home.
SUPMALE:Well, not exactly no trouble.
LEADMALE:You know that taco stand at the bottom of that real steep hill? Yes.
SUPMALE:Well, it has a drive-through service now.
SUPFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) That's a nice pinecone turkey you're making, Grant.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Thompson.
SUPMALE:Mrs.
LEADMALE:Thompson, can you jump sideways in checkers? No, Pamela.
LEADMALE:Shazbat! Well, Jack, this is an interesting painting.
OTHERFEMALE:You know what it is? A tree.
LEADMALE:It's a picture of you.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it does sort of look like me, except for that branch growing out of my ear.
SUPFEMALE:I knew you'd like it.
OTHERFEMALE:( giggles ) Greetings, munchkins.
LEADMALE:ALL: Nanu, nanu! Aw, shucks and wazoo.
SUPMALE:( laughs ) The kids sure have taken to you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I like them too.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to rent one if I could.
OTHERFEMALE:I also feel good about helping working moms.
LEADMALE:Well, I'll be in my office.
LEADMALE:Have fun.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Picasso, eh? Mork, would you do that magic trick again? ALL: Yeah! All right, no pressure.
LEADFEMALE:( imitates band playing fanfare music ) ( gurgling ) ( burps ) I can drink like that.
LEADFEMALE:You can? Yes, but I do it with my mouth.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sleight of tongue, eh? Munchkins, I-I need your help.
LEADMALE:I have to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.
LEADMALE:See, I have this friend who's giving a speech on Saturday-morning television.
SUPFEMALE:He likes to know what you think What would you like him to say? Nothing.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, we get enough speeches at home.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what would you like to see on Saturday mornings? The Dallas cheerleaders.
OTHERMALE:I like puppets.
SUPMALE:I like jokes.
LEADMALE:Rock 'n' roll! I'd like to see Dick Cavett interview the prime minister of Rhodesia.
LEADFEMALE:Pardon me? I can't help it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gifted.
LEADMALE:I wanna find out where babies come from.
LEADFEMALE:Well, if you find out, will you tell me? ( upbeat theme playing ) They also want to see you juggle, and some magic, lion taming.
LEADMALE:Sure.
SUPFEMALE:You have a talent.
OTHERFEMALE:I can't do nary a thing on that list.
LEADMALE:Nelson was never what you might call the entertainer of the family.
LEADFEMALE:Last time I got applause is when I used the potty without being reminded.
LEADFEMALE:I think I just better go with my strength: Dull speeches.
OTHERFEMALE:The little rug rats don't want to watch me, let 'em switch to Mooky the Mongoose.
LEADFEMALE:You don't have to fill this entire hour by yourself, do you? What are you driving at? Well, maybe we could help.
LEADMALE:I mean, we've got friends.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I know some guys in a band and And Remo tells jokes.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah, Mindy can sing.
LEADFEMALE:And Jeanie dances.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to us.
SUPMALE:We sound like an old Judy Garland/ Mickey Rooney movie.
OTHERFEMALE:( as Mickey Rooney ): Kids, let's put on a show! With a little imagination, we could turn the new theater into an old barn! I don't know.
OTHERMALE:It sounds kind of wacky.
SUPMALE:Who'd want to watch a bunch of amateurs put on a show? Peeping Toms.
LEADMALE:I guess it is kind of a silly idea.
LEADMALE:What am I gonna do? Come on, Nelson, you can't give up.
LEADMALE:Mind, we've got to help him.
SUPMALE:Nelson, you might not have to be that professional at 7 in the morning.
SUPMALE:Do you really think if I put on a kids' show, people would like me? Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe.
LEADMALE:By gum, let's do it.
SUPMALE:It'll be Nelson Flavor's gift to the children of Boulder.
LEADMALE:Oh, huzzah, huzzah! Let's go for the gusto! I can see Oh, there's There's one problem.
LEADMALE:What? Well, I'll miss Mooky the Mongoose.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you.
SUPMALE:You nutty guy! ( upbeat theme playing ) MINDY: Okay, who wants to go next? Well, I'll give it a try.
SUPFEMALE:Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Ooh.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo.
LEADFEMALE:Yea! I learned to juggle in the Army.
SUPMALE:I used to do this with hand grenades.
LEADFEMALE:That's how I got out.
LEADFEMALE:( all laugh ) La-la-la ( all laugh ) This could be the start of something small.
LEADFEMALE:I think the audience will enjoy it.
SUPFEMALE:What audience? I invited the kids from the daycare center.
OTHERFEMALE:I hope you don't mind, Nelson.
SUPMALE:Ah, that's okay.
LEADMALE:What's wrong, Nelson? Well, it's just that everybody's got something nifty to do except me.
LEADFEMALE:If it goes well, the kids will think you're the next best thing to dead bugs.
LEADFEMALE:You're a good buddy, Mork.
LEADMALE:I'm glad I appointed you to be the host.
LEADFEMALE:Mork is gonna host the entire hour? Well, he has a firm grasp of juvenile-attitude preference.
LEADFEMALE:He means Mork knows what kids like.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I think they'll like what I'm doing.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna start it like this.

LEADFEMALE:( normal voice ): Yes, sir.
LEADMALE:This week, sir, I learned about teamwork.
LEADFEMALE:My friend Nelson Flavor asked for an hour of television time, but once he got it, he didn't know what to do with it, so his friends and I had to bail him out.
LEADFEMALE:Tell me, how did you help your friend? Well, I hosted his television show.
SUPFEMALE:You know, like: ( Hums theme from The Tonight Show ) And, uh, it was for children.
LEADMALE:They really seemed to enjoy it.
OTHERFEMALE:Children? Sir.
LEADMALE:What do you know about children, Mork? Well, sir, some people think of them as children, but I prefer to think of them as humans.
LEADFEMALE:There's an older phrase, sir, that says, "Children should be seen and not heard.
LEADMALE:" But I think if that really happened, the silence would be deafening.
LEADFEMALE:But children's minds aren't fully developed yet.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't it best they be kept in their place? Sir.
SUPFEMALE:Just because they're children doesn't mean they don't have anything of value to say.
LEADMALE:I mean, give 'em a chance.
LEADFEMALE:Listen to them.
OTHERMALE:If you're only gonna talk down to them, how can you expect them to look up to you? Well, sir, until next week, ( as Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Rogers ): Can you say, "Nanu, nanu"? I think you can.
LEADFEMALE:
