LEADMALE:Na-no, na-no.
OTHERMALE:Daddy got his license.
SUPFEMALE:Daddy got his license.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, you lost, Grandpops.
LEADMALE:Fork over.
SUPFEMALE:Mork driving.
LEADMALE:Who would believe it could happen here? I keep thinking, one stiff wind four years ago and he would've landed in Kentucky.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:Mork went out, set a goal for himself and he achieved it.
LEADMALE:I think you should be very proud of him.
OTHERFEMALE:Proud? He just drove out of a gas station with the attendant still under the hood.
LEADFEMALE:Made me laugh.
LEADFEMALE:Ha, ha! Oh, ho.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I'm free.
LEADFEMALE:I've got mobility now.
SUPMALE:I have got my license, the key to joie.
OTHERMALE:Oh, ho.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I can finally take that "Just Married" sticker off my bicycle.
LEADMALE:It was so hard dragging all those cans all these days.
LEADFEMALE:Honey, look, don't think of me as your father.
LEADFEMALE:Think of me as your savior.
LEADMALE:You can't turn that maniac loose on the highway.
LEADMALE:Will you have a little faith in Mork, please? He didn't try to discourage you when you took up karate.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, bless you, my little support system.
LEADFEMALE:This would be a red-letter day for me if I hadn't taken such a lousy picture.
OTHERMALE:Amidst all of this excitement, I've written a poem.
OTHERFEMALE:Here it is.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you read.
LEADMALE:"My Dad" by Mearth McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:Now that my dad can drive And change a flat Please don't run over my new cat Bless you, son, bless you.
LEADMALE:That was wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:I loved your imagery and your meter.
LEADMALE:You know, it's kind of reminiscent of Ubie or Robert Blake.
SUPMALE:Oh, hello.
SUPMALE:Hi, uh, I'm Bob Miller, your neighbor from across the street.
LEADMALE:- Oh, hi.
LEADMALE:- I seem to have gotten your mail.
SUPFEMALE:- You're Mindy McConnell, aren't you? - Oh, yeah.
SUPMALE:- Oh, and this is my husband, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, howdy.
SUPMALE:Hi, Bob.
OTHERMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:I've seen you.
LEADMALE:When are you gonna take down those Christmas lights? - Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:This is a subpoena.
SUPFEMALE:- That's right.
SUPMALE:Hey, isn't that great? Bob, what a kinda guy you are.
SUPFEMALE:Come over tomorrow, we'll wear shorts, stand by a fire and have a weenie roast.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Mork.
SUPMALE:You just walked in here and lied to me.
LEADFEMALE:You're a process server.
OTHERFEMALE:You just - You said you were our neighbor.
SUPMALE:- I am.
SUPFEMALE:I do live right across the street.
LEADFEMALE:- By the way, can I borrow your rake? - No.
SUPMALE:Sorry you have to be going, neighbor.
SUPMALE:Mind, come on.
LEADMALE:You can't treat people like that.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, if you do that, they'll be walking their dogs on our lawn.
LEADFEMALE:- What's this all about, honey? - I don't know.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Ugh.
SUPMALE:They want me to testify on that story I broke on the Hidden Springs Highway scandal.
OTHERMALE:You remember that one, Dad.
SUPFEMALE:It was where the road crew told me the contractor was skimping on the codes and paying the state inspectors to look the other way.
SUPFEMALE:I suppose they want you to tell them who supplied the information.
LEADFEMALE:Mm-hm.
LEADMALE:Mommy, I hope you're not going to release the name of the informant.
LEADMALE:You should stand on the first amendment, on your rights as a journalist.
OTHERMALE:Too strong? It's okay when Lou Grant says it.
LEADFEMALE:I can identify with him.
LEADMALE:We've got matching bodies.
LEADFEMALE:I just can't believe that they would ask me to betray a confidence like that.
SUPMALE:If it wasn't for me, they wouldn't have the story in the first place.
OTHERMALE:Look, honey, I respect your principles, but haven't journalists gone to jail for standing on the first amendment? Oh, Dad, this is just a little construction scandal, not the Pentagon Papers.
SUPFEMALE:No, they're not gonna do anything to me.
OTHERMALE:This is News Line and I'm Larry Carroll.
SUPFEMALE:Today, KTNS reporter Mindy McConnell was cited for contempt of court and jailed for refusing to reveal her news source in the Hidden Springs bribery trial.
LEADFEMALE:In other news, finalists prep for the Miss Nude Colorado contest.
LEADFEMALE:Film at 10.
LEADMALE:All right, come on, sister, move it.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I've never been in jail before.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, life's tough.
OTHERMALE:I've never been to France.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me, but there's somebody else in there.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe I could have a single cell.
LEADMALE:Toots, this is jail, not the Love Boat.
SUPFEMALE:Get in.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Wait.
LEADFEMALE:One last question.
LEADFEMALE:Um, are my things gonna be all right? I mean, that's a very expensive sweater.
LEADMALE:Don't put that on a hanger.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't worry about it, honey.
SUPMALE:I'll only wear it weekends.
SUPFEMALE:- Hello.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, you poor, dear child.
LEADFEMALE:I know just how you feel.
LEADMALE:Now you come right here and you sit down.
LEADMALE:- Would you care for a Snickers? - Oh.
LEADMALE:No, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Suit yourself.
LEADMALE:I was just trying to be friendly.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:It's just I've never done time before.
LEADFEMALE:I've never even been grounded.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I'm Mindy McConnell.
LEADMALE:- And I'm Louise Bailey.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:- My, but you are a cutie.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:What in the world are you doing in a hell hole like this? I don't know.
SUPMALE:I didn't think things were gonna work out like this.
SUPMALE:But my lawyer called and she said I should be out in a few hours.
LEADFEMALE:- It's funny the way things happen.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:I'm in here because of a silly old parking meter.
LEADFEMALE:You're kidding.
LEADFEMALE:No, I went into a hardware store, and when I came out, there was a policeman writing me a ticket.
OTHERMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:They threw you in jail for a parking ticket? Well, in a roundabout way.
OTHERMALE:You see, when I put the shovel in the trunk, Walter's arm fell out.
LEADFEMALE:Who's Walter? My husband.
OTHERMALE:Well, what was he doing in the trunk? Not much.
LEADMALE:He was dead.
LEADMALE:I warned him about his snoring for years, but he just wouldn't believe me.
LEADMALE:So last night I took a pair of my very best panty hose and I wrapped them around his neck real tight.
LEADMALE:You know, it was the first good night's sleep I've had in 31 years.
LEADMALE:Well, you look well rested.
LEADFEMALE:- You don't snore, do you, dear? - No.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, my poor prison pooter.
LEADMALE:My little San Quentin quail.
LEADMALE:How are you? Oh.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind, I mean, oh, the anguish, the degradation.
SUPFEMALE:But cute little dress though.
OTHERMALE:Mork, I feel so humiliated, even though I know what I'm doing is right.
SUPMALE:They took everything.
SUPFEMALE:They took my clothes, and they took my wedding band.
OTHERFEMALE:And then they fingerprinted me and took mug shots and Oh, Mind Mork, that woman told me that she murdered her husband.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mind, murdered her husband.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, she looks like Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Cleaver.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, how did Mearth take it? Did you tell him? He cried a lot.
LEADMALE:He kept saying, "Mama's in the can, Mama's in the can.
LEADFEMALE:" - Oh.
LEADMALE:- Oh, it's all right, though.
SUPFEMALE:Then he packed all your stuff in boxes and he moved in the bedroom with me.
LEADMALE:Well, you can tell him to unpack.
LEADFEMALE:I'm gonna be out in a few hours.
LEADMALE:I got things to tide you over in case you're here longer.
LEADFEMALE:Here's some cigarettes to bribe the screws.
LEADMALE:And, uh, here's some facial cream for an older woman.
LEADMALE:And, uh, here's a harmonica.
LEADFEMALE:Visiting hours are over.
LEADFEMALE:- Let's go, Shorty.
LEADMALE:- You got it, Butch.
SUPMALE:- I miss you already.
LEADMALE:- I miss you too, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and, lady, don't you worry, she makes a real good roommate.
LEADMALE:Don't let her snore and keep you awake at night.
SUPFEMALE:Um, heh, heh, that was a joke.
LEADFEMALE:He was kidding.
SUPMALE:I don't snore.
SUPFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I don't even sleep.
SUPFEMALE:Guard! Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, it's such a long step.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, son, son, what's wrong? - Oh, come, what's the matter now? - What's the matter? - Can't you see? - Oh, look, well, sit down.
SUPFEMALE:- Sit down.
LEADMALE:- Oh, the life - Let's look at the boo-boo.
SUPMALE:Sit down.
SUPMALE:- No boo-boo.
SUPFEMALE:Doggie bit me, and then there was a kitty bit me, and then there was a gray squirrel, then Tommy Leonard hit me with a bat.
LEADFEMALE:Ow.
SUPMALE:What did you do to make these people angry? Just this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, son, well, let me look at your boo-boo.
LEADMALE:Oh! - Don't touch it.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, blood.
OTHERFEMALE:- Hey, hey, hey - I'll be back.
LEADFEMALE:Wait now.
LEADFEMALE:You've got to set an example for me.
LEADMALE:Daddy, Daddy Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you worry.
SUPFEMALE:Let's put a little of this on.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:Ow! Aah! Come on, if a dog bit you Come on.
SUPFEMALE:It's my sore.
LEADFEMALE:Let me do the "ows.
LEADFEMALE:" Ow.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, if a dog bit you, we've gotta get a rabies shot for you.
LEADFEMALE:I was kidding about that.
OTHERFEMALE:Doggie didn't bite me and a kitty didn't bite me.
OTHERMALE:But Bobby Leonard hit me with a bat.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy never puts these on.
OTHERFEMALE:- She always puts - Well, listen, kid.
LEADFEMALE:Your mommy's in the slammer busting rocks and breaking out license plates.
LEADMALE:So I'm the best you got.
OTHERMALE:You better deal with me.
LEADMALE:Oh, what am I talking about? I miss Mommy too.
LEADMALE:Boy, you need some sedation.
OTHERMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, son, son, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:Forgive me.
LEADFEMALE:Can't you even think of helping me? Boy, it's getting stiff.
LEADMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPMALE:Uh-oh.
SUPFEMALE:Gangrene, gangrene.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not going to go very far.
OTHERFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADMALE:Come on, son.
SUPFEMALE:There we go.
OTHERFEMALE:- You up now? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:This is a biggie.
OTHERFEMALE:- Are you feeling better now? - Yes, I am.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, my gosh.
LEADFEMALE:That's the doggie.
LEADMALE:Maybe it's Bobby Leonard.
LEADFEMALE:Mork I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
OTHERMALE:Don't tell me something's happened to Gene Rayburn.
SUPMALE:- No, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, thank God.
SUPMALE:You see, the judge has denied Mindy's petition for release.
LEADFEMALE:She could be locked up for quite a while.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, this is awful.
SUPFEMALE:Mommy's not coming home for a while.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, Mearth and I are gonna be plagued by relatives bringing over strange casseroles like tomato delight.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I'm like Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:I'm real sorry about that, but take some extra green, looks like you lose again.
LEADMALE:It's amazing.
LEADFEMALE:Nine days and she hasn't improved at all.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:- Oh, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, I don't think I can stand it another day.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, darling, I think I have a plan, though, so you can say good-bye to the bars, the community showers - and the mystery meat.
LEADMALE:- Oh, what? Well, just tell them the name of your informant.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:I'm not gonna do that.
LEADFEMALE:You tell me and I'll spill your guts for you.
LEADMALE:Mork, you know how I feel about freedom of the press.
LEADFEMALE:This is a basic constitutional question.
SUPMALE:You mean like how Strom Thurmond keeps having children? What? Oh, Mork All right, get in here.
OTHERMALE:Easy, sister, or I'm gonna have to show you a few tricks I learned in the roller derby.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind, come on now.
SUPMALE:You gotta come home.
SUPFEMALE:I can't bear you sleeping on anything that doesn't have a dust ruffle.
LEADFEMALE:Believe me, I wanna come home.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork, it's not easy for me here.
SUPFEMALE:When I go out in the exercise yard, the prisoners giggle when I shoot baskets.
LEADFEMALE:I have to cut my meat with a spoon and, frankly, the screws here aren't very nice.
LEADMALE:Move it, sister, you're on my bunk.
OTHERFEMALE:Do you believe I said that to her? That woman would kill me for my lunch.
LEADMALE:Oh, are they that good here? Oh, Mind, I'm not just gonna sit down and let you rot in here.
SUPMALE:Now come on, I'm gonna try and do something.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork, what can you do? It's so complicated.
SUPMALE:You wouldn't know where to start.
SUPMALE:Oh, that doesn't matter, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:I'm gonna go to the capitol, start knocking on doors until someone listens.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna work through the system.
LEADFEMALE:I am.
OTHERFEMALE:I've gone through enough red tape to gift wrap the Kremlin.
LEADMALE:- How can I help you? - Well, you see, my wife is a journalist and, well, she refused to give her sources so the judge found her in contempt.
LEADFEMALE:She's been in the stir nine days and they haven't even taught her a trade.
OTHERFEMALE:That's an outrage.
OTHERFEMALE:Would you like some coffee? Oh, no, thank you.
LEADMALE:I'm not alone in this, though.
LEADFEMALE:I have a petition here signed by all 17 members of Miss LePons' tap class.
LEADFEMALE:I'd like to thank you for taking the time and the trouble to bring this problem to my attention.
LEADMALE:Before you go, I would like to present you with one of my souvenir pens.
LEADFEMALE:If I wanted a pen and coffee, I would've mugged a waitress.
LEADFEMALE:I don't need any more pens.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
LEADFEMALE:I've got pens coming out the klarn here.
LEADMALE:Look at this.
SUPFEMALE:Look at that.
LEADFEMALE:Look at this one.
LEADMALE:A Ronald Reagan pen.
LEADFEMALE:It's got no point.
SUPMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:Come on, you're an elected official.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, you've gotta help people.
SUPMALE:Do more than open up super markets and have mediocre-looking daughters.
OTHERFEMALE:There's gotta be something you can do.
SUPFEMALE:Well, okay, the only viable solution that I can think of is a shield law.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Is that the law where it forces a woman to wear pads to protect her delicate dress? No, it protects a journalist from having to disclose their sources.
LEADMALE:Uh, twenty-six states have some sort of shield law, but Colorado doesn't.
SUPMALE:However, they don't have our mile-high taffy.
OTHERMALE:Well, how about this for a campaign for you, huh? I mean, how about this? "Free the shiksa one.
LEADMALE:" - That'll work.
LEADMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:And who knows? In no time, Mindy'll be home changing the vacuum bag.
LEADMALE:Okay, listen, I know what I can do.
LEADFEMALE:Of course, this is gonna take time.
OTHERFEMALE:This isn't Fotomat.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll have to draft a bill, and then, uh, push it through the right channels.
SUPFEMALE:- Right.
LEADMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, you know what? - I won't take my Christmas vacation.
SUPMALE:- Bless you.
LEADFEMALE:- I'll ram this through - Ram it home.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:And you know what? She'll probably be out in about two or three years.
SUPMALE:Two or three years? By that time Brooke Shields' eyebrows would have met.
LEADMALE:Hey, listen, that's not so That's not so bad.
LEADMALE:You know, it took me two full terms just to get this swivel chair? Then you can't get my wife out of jail? No.
LEADMALE:But my father could've.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that I don't care.
OTHERMALE:It's just that, well, I don't wanna make waves.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:You don't wanna make waves? Well, you politicians You politicians are all alike.
SUPFEMALE:I should have known better.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, from the same system that gave us Spiro Agnew.
LEADMALE:Happy birthday to you Hey.
LEADMALE:It's not my birthday.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Oh, will you listen to her? She's so shy.
OTHERMALE:She lies about her age and her SAT score.
LEADMALE:You know, you've got a funny little man here.
SUPMALE:A cake in the shape of a saw.
OTHERFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha! Play along with her.
LEADFEMALE:We're making our own laws here, just like in Haiti.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, whatever you're up to, please don't.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, she's gonna perk up so much when we make those little balloon animals.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADMALE:You know, we haven't had a party here since the police chief had his heart attack.
SUPMALE:Party! Whoo! Party! Whoo! Well, Mind Well, I saw this cake.
SUPFEMALE:It's the best one I'd seen bar none.
OTHERFEMALE:Hope it doesn't make you break out.
OTHERMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Break out.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, make a wish, hon.
LEADMALE:I did, but you're probably going through with this anyway.
OTHERMALE:A couple of weeks without her Waterpik and she still hasn't lost her spirit.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, time to cut the cake.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, but there's an old tradition that the birthday girl gets to cut the cake.
LEADFEMALE:Well, we have a little tradition here too.
LEADMALE:Prisoners with knives get shot on sight.
LEADMALE:- I want my piece of cake now.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:What kind of filling is that? I asked for rum raisin.
LEADMALE:Oh, how'd that? Oh, the nerve.
SUPMALE:Oh, boy.
LEADMALE:I'm gonna call my consumer advocate about this.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Watch out for this one.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that really Oh, what a bummer.

LEADFEMALE:You don't wanna miss clam night.
OTHERMALE:Come on, let's go.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, it's against the law to break people out of jail.
OTHERMALE:Well, so is dancing with sheep, but people still do it.
LEADMALE:Mork, oh, I wanna go with you, but I can't.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, Mork, don't you see, this is This is my one chance to prove that my beliefs are more than just words.
SUPMALE:My mind's made up.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not going anywhere.
LEADFEMALE:I'm staying here.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you the same woman that broke the Pritikin Diet after only three hours? Yes.
OTHERMALE:But that's different, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Sometimes you have to make sacrifices for your principles.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on, you see that, don't you? Oh, no.
