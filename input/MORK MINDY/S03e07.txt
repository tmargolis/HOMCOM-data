LEADFEMALE:Good morning, everybody.
SUPFEMALE:I tell you, I've been working on your Jeep for over an hour and I can't find out what's wrong with it.
LEADFEMALE:My battery's dead.
LEADMALE:When I woke up this morning, my battery was dead.
LEADFEMALE:I can't understand what happened.
LEADFEMALE:Well, could leaving the car lights on all night have any effect on that? Why, yes, it could.
LEADMALE:Why would you ask? - No reason, no reason at all.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, all right, Mindy.
LEADMALE:There's a big reason, but a very good one, though.
OTHERFEMALE:There's always good reason.
SUPMALE:- Oh, you understand, Pops, don't you? - Yes, I do.
LEADMALE:Well, basically, there's this cute little old wino outside and he was sleeping in the gutter, and I left the lights on so no one would park on him.
LEADMALE:You're so courteous.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, as soon as I finish my coffee, I'll drop you off at the day care centre.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thanks, Pops.
SUPFEMALE:You know Oh, Mind, Mind, opening-night jitters, I've got the flop sweat already.
SUPFEMALE:I don't even have a costume yet.
LEADMALE:Mork had this idea about the kids dressing up as their favourite hero.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, kids today could use some heroes.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:When I was a boy, I used to like the Western heroes.
SUPMALE:Roy Rogers and Gene Autry and Tex Ritter.
LEADMALE:In those days, you could always tell who the good guys were because they all wore big white hats and played guitars.
LEADMALE:I always used to wonder why they never rode into town playing a violin.
OTHERFEMALE:That's probably because all the Indians had the bows.
LEADMALE:Imagine Custer's last concerto: I guess my favourite hero was the Lone Ranger.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, the Lone Ranger's a real good one, Mork.
LEADMALE:I think you'd like him because he always settled fights peacefully.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Whoa, parallel universe.
LEADFEMALE:We have someone like that just on Ork.
SUPFEMALE:On Ork, you have somebody like the Lone Ranger? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he's more like the Lone Chicken.
LEADFEMALE:See, whenever there'd be trouble, he would always hide.
LEADFEMALE:His favourite motto was, ''When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping.
LEADMALE:'' - Sounds like the Gabor sisters to me.
SUPMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
SUPMALE:I can go as Squellman the Yellow.
LEADFEMALE:What a strange planet.
LEADFEMALE:Making a hero out of someone who does nothing but hide.
LEADMALE:- What does he look like? - No one ever saw his face.
LEADMALE:All we ever saw was this yellow-feathered tush hightailing it into the sunset.
LEADFEMALE:Happy tails to you Until we meet again And will leap tall buildings with a single boo.
OTHERFEMALE:It's a turkey.
OTHERMALE:No, it's Squellman the Yellow.
LEADMALE:The proud coward with the golden tail.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you see, that's a hero where I came from.
LEADMALE:By creative hiding, that's how he survived.
LEADMALE:Well, know who's up next? Who's up? You're up, Jonathan.
LEADMALE:I'll give you a hint.
LEADFEMALE:Sugar Ray Leonard.
OTHERFEMALE:One more hint and I might get it.
SUPMALE:Speaking of sugar, when do we eat? Now, Stephanie, you just had lunch, and very few people can eat a whole turkey and live.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, who's your hero, Stephanie? Sara Lee.
SUPMALE:I might have guessed.
LEADFEMALE:- Stick a brownie in your ear.
LEADFEMALE:- Stephanie, if you keep this up, one day you're gonna go on an elevator and it's gonna say, ''Capacity: You.
LEADFEMALE:'' Who's your hero, Lola? Truman Capote.
LEADFEMALE:For his accurate, yet lyrical portrayal of the human condition.
SUPMALE:Lola, one day you're gonna have a talk show all of your own.
SUPMALE:Billy, who's your hero? My dad picked my hero for me.
SUPMALE:- Well, who is it? - Him.
OTHERMALE:He wants me to be a doctor like he is.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's not a bad hero.
SUPMALE:I mean, they save lives, they play great golf and they never bother you at home.
SUPFEMALE:Big deal.
LEADFEMALE:My dad won't let me be who I really wanna be.
LEADFEMALE:- Well, who's that? - A guy with my name.
LEADFEMALE:Billy the Kid.
LEADMALE:He was a tough hombre.
LEADFEMALE:His dad never told him what to do.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Billy the Kid.
LEADFEMALE:Isn't that the president's brother? The one that helped Reagan get elected? No? Sorry.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mork, he was a famous cowboy.
LEADFEMALE:People say he used to live in that old ghost town near here.
SUPFEMALE:That's it, a ghost town, the ultimate retirement village.
LEADMALE:Imagine the maid changing the sheets up thereyou know? Jonathan meant Windy Gulch, the old town outside of Boulder.
SUPFEMALE:I bet Billy had fun out there.
OTHERFEMALE:Got to camp out, never ate broccoli.
OTHERMALE:Billy, come as Billy the Kid if you want.
LEADMALE:- Really? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:- Thanks, Mork.
OTHERMALE:- Oh, shucks and wazoo, little Yoda.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, that's it for today.
LEADMALE:Time for our field trip.
LEADMALE:We're gonna go to that chemical plant by the river and watch the dead fish race.
OTHERMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks for the ride, Exidor.
OTHERMALE:Lucky for you the Shriners cancelled.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I'm going out of town and I'd like you to take all my phone calls.
LEADMALE:- All right.
SUPMALE:- Here.
LEADMALE:Where's the receiver? I don't know, I just don't want anybody calling me long-distance.
LEADMALE:Listen, I'm sure you two boys have a lot to chitchat about, so I'll just leave you two alone.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mind, come on now, Exidor's our friend.
LEADMALE:Exidor is your friend, Mork.
LEADMALE:You know, quite a few people think he's a little strange.
SUPMALE:I've heard those ugly rumours and they're grossly exaggerated.
LEADMALE:Do you have any chinchilla dip? I rest my case.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going away on a very secret trip, so secret in fact that I've blindfolded my burro.
SUPMALE:Some call it kinky, I call it security.
SUPFEMALE:Hush-toned, why is it so secret? Mork, there's a fortune buried out there.
OTHERMALE:I inherited this map from my late grandfather.
SUPMALE:He's deceased, you know.
OTHERFEMALE:There's nothing on this map, Exidor.
LEADMALE:A necessary precaution.
LEADFEMALE:Besides, I've got it all right there, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you memorized it, huh? No, I had it tattooed on the inside of my eyelid.
LEADFEMALE:Steinmetz, Pepe, Guido, load up the burro and pile on.
SUPFEMALE:I'm an equal-opportunity employer.
LEADFEMALE:All those people on one burro, that's incredible.
LEADFEMALE:Those amazing animals.
OTHERFEMALE:If you should get a post card saying, ''Wish you were blank,'' you know who it's from.
SUPFEMALE:I'll be back in about a month.
SUPMALE:Frankie, Annette, surf's up.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, you can come out now, Exidor's gone.
LEADFEMALE:Exidor was gone when he got here.
LEADMALE:Well, I hope your day's been going better than mine.
LEADMALE:Oh, me too, Mind.
SUPMALE:My idea about the heroes with the kids was a great success except for Billy.
LEADMALE:Oh, why? His father wanted him to be a doctor.
LEADMALE:Why? That's a good hero.
LEADFEMALE:Well, he didn't like it, so I found him a new one, Billy the Kid.
LEADFEMALE:That's not so good, Mork.
OTHERMALE:Billy the Kid was a murderer.
LEADFEMALE:He killed 21 people.
LEADMALE:You don't know that for sure.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, you know how people gossip at funerals.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, I mean, he must have done something to become famous.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sometimes people become famous for the wrong reasons.
SUPMALE:Kids always imitate their idols, so it's better for everybody if you pick somebody good.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's right.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, was I wrong, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:Why do Morks rush in where wise men fear to tread? Boy, that goose must weigh a ton.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good, it's the tow truck.
LEADMALE:I'd better get out there before my auto-club card expires.
LEADMALE:Oh, hi, Billy.
SUPMALE:- Hey there, little buckaroo.
LEADMALE:- Howdy, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Yo, hey, just knock your feet together twice.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll do a little Chap Stick.
LEADMALE:Good to see you there, urban cowkid.
LEADFEMALE:Let's you and me go down to the old ghost town and have a shootout.
LEADMALE:Oh, can't go, Billy, I've gotta stay and help Mindy bury her dead battery.
LEADFEMALE:See, besides that, Billy, I think that-- I didn't realise that Billy the Kid was into retroactive family planning.
SUPMALE:Come on, he was a hero.
LEADMALE:You're just saying that because you're a fraidy cat like Squellman the Yellow.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thanks for the compliments, but I still can't go.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, it's just a game.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, game or no game, Billy, you see, it simulates violence.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, if you really wanna understand Squellman the Yellow, let's play his favourite game, cher chez moi, which is hide-and-seek.
LEADMALE:Okay, but I'm warning you, Billy the Kid's smarter.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be it, you go hide.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, okay.
LEADFEMALE:One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 1 1 Adios, turkey.
LEADFEMALE:Ollie ollie oxen free.
LEADMALE:Come on, now.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never find me, I studied with Claude Rains.
OTHERMALE:Well, the Jeep's fixed.
LEADFEMALE:You're not even close, you're not even tepid.
LEADFEMALE:I'll give you a hint.
LEADMALE:Liberace.
OTHERMALE:What's going on? Mind, Mind, quiet.
LEADFEMALE:I'm playing hide-and-seek with Billy, and I'm really skunking him, he hasn't got a chance.
SUPFEMALE:No, you're not, I just saw him take off down the street on his bike.
LEADMALE:He said you'd know where to find him.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, Mind, oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:He's gone down to Windy Gulch.
LEADFEMALE:You mean that old ghost town near here, why? - I guess he wants to have a shootout.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Well, we better go get him.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mind, Mind, it's all right.
SUPFEMALE:It's my responsibility, I'd better go get my trusty 45.
LEADFEMALE:Wait a minute, I thought Squellman was a pacifist.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, he is, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:That's his manual, 45 Ways to Hide.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, now.
LEADMALE:You look in the saloon and I'll check the livery stable next door.
SUPMALE:Billy.
LEADMALE:Billy.
LEADFEMALE:Billy, come out now.
LEADMALE:This is Father Mork talking to you, son.
SUPFEMALE:Billy, you shouldn't be here, you should be home watching TV with the other little kids, eating cereal and getting hypoglycaemic now.
LEADMALE:Don't move, varmint, I got the drop on you.
SUPFEMALE:Billy, now, come on-- I told you not to move.
SUPMALE:I got a balloon in here with your name on it.
LEADFEMALE:You don't wanna continue this and scare Ork chips out of Mork, do you? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Just checking.
OTHERFEMALE:No, Billy, no, please.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, please be careful, he might have a balloon with your name on it too.
LEADMALE:What? I don't know what's going on here.
SUPFEMALE:But you're coming home with us, young man, right now.
LEADFEMALE:Sure, push me around just because you're older than me.
LEADFEMALE:You're just like my dad.
LEADFEMALE:Mind, if we make him go home right now, he'll think that violence is the right way.
LEADMALE:But he's just a little kid.
SUPFEMALE:We can't leave him till he grows up.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I realise that.
LEADFEMALE:This is duelling philosophies right here.
SUPFEMALE:It's violence against nonviolence.
LEADFEMALE:It's like Ghandi vs.
LEADFEMALE:Dick the Bruiser.
LEADFEMALE:You understand? Like, ''I don't want to hurt the little kitty.
LEADMALE:'' ''Give it to me.
LEADFEMALE:I'll eat the thing on hoof.
OTHERFEMALE:'' That's what I'm trying to say to you, Mind.
OTHERMALE:All right, do it your way.
LEADFEMALE:Time for a showdown.
SUPMALE:We each get a balloon.
LEADFEMALE:If I hit you, Billy's best.
LEADMALE:If you hit me, Squellman's best.
LEADMALE:You're on.
LEADFEMALE:Except Squellman doesn't use weapons.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I don't think-- Okay, sucker.
SUPMALE:Mind, Mind, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:No, Mind, Mind.
OTHERMALE:Mind, I hope now that you appreciate the subtlety of my philosophy.
SUPFEMALE:Look at the good side, Mind, you could always win a wet sweater contest.
LEADFEMALE:Gotcha, Mork.
SUPMALE:l win.
LEADFEMALE:Not so fast, Billy.
SUPFEMALE:Mind over splatter.
LEADMALE:Viva la Squellman.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah? It's not over yet, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, I don't think this is gonna work.
LEADMALE:- We gotta do something to help him.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Somehow we've gotta prove to him that being an outlaw is only exciting in the movies.
LEADMALE:That Butch and Sundance weren't heroes, they were only handsome.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute, Mind.
LEADMALE:Bingo.
SUPFEMALE:That's an old religious saying on Ork.
LEADFEMALE:I think I have a way of ending this confrontation, Mind.
SUPMALE:I think there's a solution to the possible violence that's escalating before our eyes.
LEADFEMALE:We have to find young Billy, the young person who was just in here, who attempted to assassinate me with aqua pura.
SUPMALE:And if we find him, we must convince him why Billy the Kid never became Billy the Adult.
LEADFEMALE:And when we do that, we'll have a solution that is Rosemary, did you get all that? Good.
LEADMALE:Erase it.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mork, I'm gonna go down to the gas station to call his parents.
LEADMALE:You wait here to see if Billy shows up.
LEADFEMALE:Come on out, you lily-livered coward.
SUPFEMALE:I heard you're looking for me, kid.
OTHERFEMALE:Where are you? I just rode into town a little while ago.
OTHERFEMALE:My horse is tied up outside.
LEADFEMALE:I wouldn't hold that balloon if I were you.
LEADMALE:You see these notches on these suspenders here? There's 21 of them, you know what happens when I get 22? - What? - My pants fall down.
OTHERMALE:That's why I have to wear this serape here.
LEADFEMALE:What's going on? What happened to Squellman? Squellman? Somewhere, someone's got a fistful of feathers.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't you come on down, son? Buy you a little drink.
LEADFEMALE:Right now, I'm so thirsty I could belch dust.
LEADMALE:Barkeep, sarsaparilla for my friend, and I'll sip danger.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Neat.
LEADMALE:How'd you do that? There's some questions you can't answer, Billy, Iike how does Venus de Milo hitchhike? Mind if I tinkle, Bill? Wow, this is fun.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, ain't it? lt wasn't always that much fun, Billy.
LEADMALE:Especially when there were guns involved.
OTHERMALE:You know, sometimes there might be a real intense game going on here with people sitting in those chairs.
OTHERFEMALE:Let your imagination wander.
SUPFEMALE:See what happens.
LEADFEMALE:What l think here is we have a failure to deal an honest hand.
LEADMALE:Hey, you're accusing me of cheating? I'm telling you're accusing me of cheating, no.
LEADMALE:I'm just saying you got a face so ugly a coyote should beat it out with a stick.
LEADMALE:I'm telling you.
LEADMALE:You're telling me that? Don't you talk to me like that.
SUPFEMALE:Yep.
LEADFEMALE:Yup, that's what I said.
SUPFEMALE:Happy trails to you Oh, stuff it, Roy, and I don't mean Trigger.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you understand? There's a lot of stuff going down here.
LEADFEMALE:You'll never go on here.
SUPFEMALE:- What's he saying? - I don't know.
LEADMALE:All right, the rest of you.
LEADMALE:Come on, quit hiding from it.
OTHERFEMALE:They're not doing diddly.
LEADMALE:Let's get down to the action.
LEADMALE:That did it, you all done it now.
SUPMALE:You've had it now.
LEADMALE:Watch out, Billy.
SUPFEMALE:Well, Billy, that seem like fun to you? No, it's pretty scary.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, that's just what Uncle Mork wanted to hear.
LEADFEMALE:I guess we can head on home now and talk about this one later.
LEADFEMALE:- Remember this for when we're older.
OTHERMALE:- Nope.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Mayday.
OTHERFEMALE:Amrak.
SUPFEMALE:All systems alert.
LEADFEMALE:Damien, Part Four.
SUPMALE:- It's all over, Mork.
LEADMALE:- No, no, Billy.
LEADMALE:No, wait.
LEADMALE:I won.
LEADFEMALE:- Billy the Kid did it again.
LEADFEMALE:- What--? What happened? Mork.
SUPMALE:What happened? Hey, get up, Mork.
LEADMALE:The game's over.
LEADMALE:Look, violence isn't a game, Billy.
LEADMALE:But it was just pretend.
LEADMALE:Mork, are you all right? Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, is Billy nearby? I can't see too clearly.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:I think he needs a doctor.
LEADFEMALE:Gee, I wish my dad were here, he's a doctor.
SUPFEMALE:There's a cold trough outside.
LEADMALE:l'll go get a cold washcloth.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
OTHERMALE:Mind, can you stop doing that? You're curling my eyebrows.
OTHERFEMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, you're all right? Mind, as I fell through the air, l had this incredible idea.
SUPFEMALE:I thought I might just wing it, you know? I mean, Squellman had this incredible flair for the dramatic.
SUPMALE:I'm glad you're all right, but I think I'd like to wring your neck.
LEADMALE:This wasn't part of our plan.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy, think Ghandi, nonviolence, nonviolence.
LEADMALE:We are not here, not be here now, if not, get there later.
LEADMALE:And to Mindy, I leave all of my Tupperware.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, don't die.
OTHERMALE:I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I went too far.
SUPMALE:Oh, it's all right, Billy.
LEADMALE:It was just a game.
LEADFEMALE:Kind of heavy stakes, but just a game.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:Get better.
SUPFEMALE:I saw my dad do this, I hope it works.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I have a feeIing it will.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Yes, yes, yes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm healed.
SUPFEMALE:Praise the power.
OTHERFEMALE:I had a vision.
OTHERFEMALE:I saw the Cadillac was coming to carry me home.
SUPFEMALE:You did it, Billy.
SUPMALE:Praise you.
LEADFEMALE:I think you saved his life.
OTHERMALE:I did, didn't I? - I made Mork better.
OTHERFEMALE:- Yup.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you think you wanna be Billy the Kid anymore? No way.
SUPFEMALE:I've got a new hero now.
SUPFEMALE:Who's that, Bill? You, Mork.
LEADMALE:I'd better get home now, my mom and dad will be worried.
LEADFEMALE:Is it all right if I throw my bike in your Jeep? - Sure.
SUPFEMALE:- Better than the other way around.
OTHERFEMALE:Well Well, another day, another nervous breakdown.
SUPMALE:Hey, somebody left the Jeep lights on.
SUPFEMALE:Mind, Mind I know what you're thinking, but it was advanced planning, really, it was.
LEADFEMALE:I know we need those lights at night when we have to look for the car keys that I lost.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mork.
SUPMALE:- I know, I know.
LEADMALE:Patience, Mind, patience.
LEADFEMALE:It's not only a virtue, in this case, it's a necessity.
LEADFEMALE:I'll wait for you outside.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:Thanks, fellas.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
OTHERMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come on in there, partner.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, bronco belly, where are you? - Mork, get a grip on yourself.
SUPFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It's just me and my sidekick Beebs here, H'Orson around, sir.
LEADMALE:Get it, H'Orson around? One more, Mr.
LEADMALE:Beebs.
SUPFEMALE:That's funny, he didn't get it this time.
LEADMALE:What's your report about this week, Mork? Well, heroes, sir.
OTHERMALE:And I'm not talking sandwiches.
LEADFEMALE:Are there many heroes on Earth? Oh, yes, sir, there are.
SUPFEMALE:But it seems like only the ones with pizzazz seem to get the spotlight.
SUPFEMALE:How many times have you seen Albert Schweitzer on a bubblegum card? Think about that one, sir.
LEADMALE:Maybe he can't throw a good curve ball, but isn't that being a little picky? lt sounds like Earthlings equate heroism with glamorous deeds.
OTHERFEMALE:l think so, sir, it's probably good for their T-shirt industry.
LEADFEMALE:You always hear about the man who jumps over 1 3 buses, but you never hear about the John Doe that put him back together again.
LEADMALE:- Who's John Doe? - Exactly, sir.
LEADMALE:That's why I think most real heroes seldom get a headline of their own.
LEADMALE:Imagine this, sir.
LEADMALE:Today millions of Earthlings helped one another.
OTHERMALE:No film at 1 1 .
OTHERFEMALE:And that's all she wrote, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:We'll get back to you next week if we get that grant from the Chrysler Foundation.
LEADMALE:Na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:It's cute, you'll like it.
LEADFEMALE:Don't worry, it's got a nice feel.
