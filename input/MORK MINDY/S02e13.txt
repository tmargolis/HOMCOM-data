LEADMALE:MORK: Nanu, nanu! ( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Hey, Nelson, have you ever thought of taking a stand on the ERA? I don't think I should get involved with Irish revolutionaries.
SUPFEMALE:That's the IRA.
SUPFEMALE:Don't you guys from Boulder ever read the newspapers? Everybody knows ERA is "earned run average.
LEADFEMALE:" You know, maybe you two should be running mates.
LEADMALE:Uh, hello, Nelson.
LEADMALE:Hi, Min.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:I suppose you'd like to know why I'm walking backwards.
SUPMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:No, I'm sure you have your reasons.
SUPMALE:I'd like to know.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I I lost another job, and I can't face Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mork! I thought things were going really great at the pet store.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, they were, but I wanted to have kind of a gestalt pet shop, so I put all the animals together.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I guess that was a mistake, huh? You can't imagine the sight of seeing a little chimpanzee trying to peel a goldfish like a banana.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I hope you took it away from the chimp.
SUPMALE:I didn't have to.
OTHERFEMALE:He drowned.
SUPMALE:It's dead? No, no.
LEADFEMALE:I gave him artificial respiration, and he gave me his phone number.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I've made a new friend but lost a job.
OTHERMALE:Well, you can have a non-paying job right here helping us come up with a platform for Nelson.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe it! God's been reading my mind! I don't think so.
SUPMALE:They're wearing clothes.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you go over there and talk to your friends? Hello, ladies! ( laughing ) Water's free.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha-ha.
SUPFEMALE:Gee, I wonder where all these beautiful girls came from.
SUPMALE:Maybe there's a slow leak at the Playboy Club.
LEADMALE:I didn't know Liberace had any children.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, we're the Denver Bronco cheerleaders, the Pony Express.
OTHERFEMALE:Hello.
SUPFEMALE:My name is Mork.
LEADMALE:Nanu, and what do you do? We dance at the football games.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, what's the matter? You can't get into Studio 54? I saw all of you on last Sunday's game.
LEADFEMALE:You were great.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yeah, you were wonderful.
SUPFEMALE:So were the Broncos.
LEADFEMALE:They won.
SUPFEMALE:They did? I didn't notice that, but you did a good job, and you were all very good.
LEADFEMALE:Your job is to cheer people up? Not always.
LEADFEMALE:Today we're here to do a charity benefit.
LEADFEMALE:You know, I'm pretty good at cheering people up.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, let's pretend you're all depressed, okay? Pretend the Ayatollah Khomeini has just bought Disneyland.
OTHERMALE:And Minnie Mouse has to wear a big veil.
LEADFEMALE:All right.
SUPFEMALE:First, I'd like to do a few impressions for you.
SUPFEMALE:Like to do a few impressions.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go.
LEADFEMALE:My first impression is a California surfer watching a total eclipse.
LEADFEMALE:Wow, that's really mellow.
LEADFEMALE:My next impression is King Kong in Las Vegas.
SUPFEMALE:( grunting ) ( high-pitched screaming ) ( in high-pitched voice ) Put me down, put me down! My final impression I think you'll really enjoy is Truman Capote as an NFL quarterback.
OTHERMALE:( as Truman Capote ) It's gonna be an awfully long day.
LEADFEMALE:That's pretty good.
SUPFEMALE:If you learned a few dance steps, you could be a cheerleader.
LEADMALE:I think it's a great idea.
LEADFEMALE:Except that all professional cheerleaders are women.
SUPMALE:You know, I don't think there's any law about that.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you fill out an application at Bronco headquarters? Whoa! Tell you what.
LEADMALE:I think I will.
SUPFEMALE:If things go right and I get this job, I promise you, I'll personally spit shine each and every one of those little spangle things.
SUPMALE:Excuse me.
OTHERFEMALE:One question.
LEADFEMALE:How many chandeliers died to make those costumes? When you dance, do you signal low-flying planes? ( upbeat theme playing ) ( humming ) Oh, a diaper.
LEADMALE:Mindy's seeing a younger man.
LEADMALE:And he's got a drinking problem.
LEADMALE:Sally brought her baby over yesterday.
OTHERFEMALE:You expect me to believe that ridiculous story?! Right.
OTHERFEMALE:I was a fool to think you'd fall for it.
OTHERMALE:Right.
SUPFEMALE:Why did you move my furniture all around? Kathy and Ann are coming over to teach me crowd excitation stimulation.
LEADMALE:What? Cheerleading to the laywoman.
LEADMALE:Mork, I really wonder if you thought this thing through.
SUPMALE:Sure I have.
LEADMALE:Haven't I? Well, if you get the job, understand the social ramifications.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I know about ramifications.
OTHERFEMALE:That's why Mary had a little lamb.
OTHERFEMALE:No.
LEADMALE:See, a lot of people might make fun of you.
LEADFEMALE:No, they made fun of me when I was walking backwards for two miles.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, I just You know, I mean, I'll back you no matter what you wanna do.
LEADMALE:I just don't wanna see you get hurt.
LEADFEMALE:Men and women should be allowed to do anything they want.
LEADMALE:I mean, look, nowadays, there's women astronauts and women lawyers.
OTHERMALE:Women mothers.
LEADFEMALE:Right, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Actually, what you're doing is very courageous, and it could just help the women's movement.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, all I wanna do, Mindy, is make Susan B.
SUPFEMALE:Anthony stand up and cheer.
LEADFEMALE:Susan B.
LEADFEMALE:Anthony is dead.
LEADMALE:No wonder she looks so bad on that little dollar.
LEADFEMALE:( knocking on door ) Oh, come on in.
SUPFEMALE:It's open.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no! Exploding habigines! Get rid of them! Aah, quick! They didn't explode.
LEADFEMALE:Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:They were tired.
OTHERMALE:I guess it was their mating season.
LEADMALE:Mork is, uh, rehearsing for a play that he's in.
LEADFEMALE:It's called The Attack of the Exploding Habigines.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, it's by Chekhov.
LEADFEMALE:ANN: Really? I'm a literature teacher, and I've never heard of it.
SUPFEMALE:It's a very loose translation.
LEADMALE:You probably know it as Oklahoma!.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:You're a cheerleader and a lit teacher, huh? I'm a lit teacher and a cheerleader.
OTHERFEMALE:And Kathy's a law student.
LEADMALE:Really? I thought jumping on a football field was a full-time profession.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? We only get paid $15 a game.
LEADMALE:We just do it for the fun and excitement.
SUPFEMALE:Anyway, there's a lot more to it than just jumping up and down.
SUPFEMALE:It includes gymnastics, dance, and lots of rehearsal.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like you have to be an all-around athlete.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, come on, Mind.
LEADMALE:If that was true, they'd roll right off the field.
LEADMALE:Ar-ar.
SUPFEMALE:Why don't we get started? We'll start with some warm-up exercises.
OTHERFEMALE:We've got a week to teach you the routine.
LEADFEMALE:Oh! I'll get you your medication.
LEADFEMALE:It's okay.
OTHERMALE:Wait.
SUPMALE:Let's try the bike exercise, okay? All right.
OTHERMALE:Mork, you're not riding the bike.
OTHERMALE:I am.
SUPMALE:Mine's a moped.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Hi there, happy faces.
SUPFEMALE:ALL: Hi, Nelson.
SUPFEMALE:You look happy.
SUPFEMALE:You get lucky? No, I got an idea.
LEADMALE:Oh, you came up with a platform? No, nary a plank.
LEADMALE:Who needs a platform when I'm going to be on national television? The Gong Show answered your letter! Hardy-har-har.
LEADMALE:You know the Kennedy-Carter debates? Well, I've volunteered to debate with them.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, Nelson, you can't debate with Kennedy and Carter.
LEADMALE:You see, they're running for president and you're running for city council.
LEADMALE:So what? We all put our pants on the same way.
SUPMALE:If I can humiliate them on national television, I'll go down in history books.
SUPFEMALE:You'll go down in comic books.
SUPMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:Mind, you'll never guess where I've been.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, to Denver to file an application with the Pony Express.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADFEMALE:Another incredible psychic occurrence.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I filled out a few applications, answered a few questions.
LEADFEMALE:That's it? Well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:The woman said she'd make me a deal: If I won't call her, she won't call me.
OTHERMALE:Mork, that means they're not even gonna let you try out.
OTHERFEMALE:Let's not jump to conclusions.
OTHERMALE:Did they say anything else? Well, she said, "This is one pony express that carries no male.
LEADFEMALE:" That's sex discrimination.
SUPFEMALE:That's terrible.
SUPMALE:That's illegal.
SUPMALE:That's wonderful.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you see? Sex discrimination, that's a great platform.
LEADMALE:I could get media coverage like that.
LEADFEMALE:Who needs Kennedy and Carter when I've got sex? Well, how is that gonna help Mork, Nelson? Are we not Americans? ( Mork humming "Battle Hymn of the Republic" ) Are we not free to pursue the job of our choice regardless of race, creed, color, or sex? And if one of my countrymen wants to shake his pom-pom, I, Nelson Flavor, will defend his right to the death.
SUPFEMALE:( imitates drums, fireworks ) Sorry, Min.
OTHERMALE:I don't know why you want that job.
OTHERFEMALE:I mean, a real man just doesn't do girlie things.
LEADFEMALE:Try and tell that to Roosevelt Grier as he needlepoints on your nose.
OTHERFEMALE:I will go ahead.
LEADMALE:With Mindy's help, I'm gonna break down every sexual barrier that there is.
LEADFEMALE:Me? What can I do? Well, once I get through this, I'm gonna make you the first female quarterback.
LEADFEMALE:( suspenseful theme playing ) Watch how long the counts will be then.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( all chattering ) ( dance music playing on stereo ) These are cheerleaders? Boy, things sure have changed since I've gone to prep school.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, how can you be a cheerleader without a baggy sweater and knee socks? I don't know, but that last move really cheered me up.
OTHERFEMALE:Will you guys stop staring? They're just a bunch of girls.
LEADMALE:Does my hair look all right? Thank you, Kim.
LEADFEMALE:That was excellent.
LEADFEMALE:You're on the team again this year.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Pam.
SUPMALE:It's good to be back.
LEADMALE:I'd like to see her in a baggy sweater.
OTHERMALE:I'd like to see her in a kangaroo suit.
SUPFEMALE:Wah-ah-ah-ah! Hi.
LEADMALE:My name's Peggy Black, and I'd like to do a cheer for you.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a B-U-N.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a C-O-S.
LEADMALE:What does that spell? ALL: Buncos? Uh, thank you, Peggy.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll be in touch.
LEADMALE:I thought you were very good.
OTHERFEMALE:Hi, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Pam, this is the guy I was telling you about.
OTHERMALE:Mork, this is Pam Stockhaus, the manager of the Pony Express.
SUPMALE:Nanu.
SUPFEMALE:I'm Mindy McConnell and this is my cousin, Nelson Flavor.
LEADFEMALE:The Nelson Flavor who was on the news last night and called me a sexist? Yes.
OTHERFEMALE:Glad to know you.
SUPMALE:The Nelson Flavor who threatened to take us to the United Nations if we didn't let his man try out? That's me.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Flavor, I am not a sexist.
LEADMALE:I discriminate against no one except tall, blond politicians.
OTHERMALE:Well, that could be a lot of people.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Pam, I know you're mad at Nelson, and you probably should be.
LEADMALE:He does get carried away now and then.
SUPMALE:But let's not lose sight of what's really at stake here.
LEADMALE:We're talking about equal rights.
SUPFEMALE:Mork just wants a chance to try out for the job.
LEADFEMALE:So I heard on the news.
SUPFEMALE:Every channel.
OTHERMALE:Well, he's been practicing really hard with your squad.
SUPMALE:I mean, if he's no good, fine, but he should at least have the chance to try.
OTHERMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPFEMALE:It's against my better judgment, but I suppose it won't hurt to look.
LEADFEMALE:You're on, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:( all cheering, applauding ) Thank you.
LEADMALE:( giggling ) Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Um ( fanfare playing ) Two, four, 6.
LEADMALE:8.
LEADMALE:We'll send your team home in a crate.
SUPMALE:Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two.
SUPFEMALE:That's all, folks.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADMALE:That was real nice work.
LEADMALE:We'll let you know.
LEADMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:Mork was great.
LEADFEMALE:You should let him know right now if he's on the team.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:If you wanna What we have here is a flagrant case of discrimination.
LEADMALE:If I may cite the case of "Tiny" Jane Whitman v.
SUPFEMALE:The Lubbock, Texas Little League If I could just finish.
LEADFEMALE:I was trying to say yes, you're on the squad.
LEADMALE:( all cheering ) ( shrieking ) Mork, your first game is on Sunday.
SUPFEMALE:Now, you're gonna have to practice every day.
SUPMALE:You've got a lot of routines to learn.
OTHERFEMALE:And remember, Mork, no special privileges.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, no, he's not looking for any special privileges.
LEADMALE:Well, the problem is, Mindy, we don't have the facilities to take care of a male cheerleader.
LEADMALE:You're gonna have to dress in the locker room with the squad.
OTHERMALE:I want total equality.
LEADFEMALE:When they jump, I'll jump.
LEADFEMALE:When they change, I'll change.
LEADFEMALE:When they shower, I'll shower.
OTHERMALE:That isn't equality.
OTHERFEMALE:That's ecstasy.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Standby.
SUPFEMALE:You're on.
LEADMALE:( Clears throat ) This is Stu Scully, in the locker room of the famed Denver Bronco cheerleaders, the Pony Express.
OTHERMALE:With me, Pam Stockhaus, their manager, and a few of the girls.
LEADFEMALE:Pam, I understand this is an important game for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's right, Stu.
LEADFEMALE:This afternoon, Denver will get an eyeful of pro football's first male cheerleader.
LEADFEMALE:What a cataclysmic event in the annals of football history.
LEADMALE:His name is Mork.
LEADMALE:And who would have thought that one day we would see a male cheerleader standing here in the Pony Express locker room? But right now let's have a random sampling.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Stu Scully.
LEADMALE:I wonder if you ladies would tell me what it's like to have a man on the team.
LEADMALE:Well, he's got a great pair of legs.
OTHERMALE:CHEERLEADER 2: And he's really become one of the girls.
LEADFEMALE:STU: Thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Miss Stockhaus, what is your reaction to accusations in the press of sexploitation? Stu, for the rest of the season, we plan to keep Mork barefoot and pregnant.
LEADMALE:I wonder if I might have a word with your new star.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, well, we have three locker rooms, and I'm not sure which one he's in.
LEADFEMALE:Sorry we're late, Pam.
OTHERMALE:We'll be right back.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Would say Mork is just a regular guy? I'd say ( woman screaming ) I think we found him.
LEADMALE:Hi.
SUPMALE:Stu Scully, Denver Action News Team.
SUPFEMALE:I wonder if you'd mind answering a few questions for our viewers out there.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:Hi, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:Hi, Nelson.
LEADFEMALE:Orson, who knew? Nanu.
SUPMALE:Ar-ar.
SUPFEMALE:Heh.
LEADMALE:All you have to do is relax, speak your mind.
OTHERMALE:Well, sure.
SUPMALE:I've seen a lot of these on television.
LEADMALE:I know how to handle these interviews.
SUPMALE:Mork, how is it that a man can break the sexual barriers of pro cheerleading? We've got a good ball team here, Stu.
LEADFEMALE:A good ball club.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADFEMALE:But, tell me, do the girls treat you any differently than they would, say, a female member of the team? We've got a good ball team here, Stu.
LEADFEMALE:A good ball club.
OTHERMALE:Stu, can you turn that off for a second? I-I'm really scared.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, I'm getting little butterflies in my knees.
SUPFEMALE:Know what I mean? Mork, the girls would like you to say a little something before we go out on the field.
LEADMALE:Come on, girls.
LEADMALE:Come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Now that we're all gathered together, girls, I know we're in first place, but, hey, big deal.
LEADFEMALE:All that means is every other cheerleading squad in the league is after our hemlines.
LEADMALE:Hatfield.
LEADFEMALE:Hatfield, I know the press has been rough on you.
LEADMALE:They say you're on your last leap.
LEADFEMALE:But, hey, who believes the Enquirer anyway? Come on, now.
SUPMALE:Sassoon, Sassoon, Sassoon.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Keep in mind the phrase of that famous cheerleader, Boom Boom La Rue when she said: "Good girls don't get to Paris.
LEADFEMALE:" I want you to go out there and win this one for the zipper! Now, come on, everybody get in the middle.
LEADMALE:Pitch in! Let's go, let's go, let's go! ( all cheering ) All right, let's go, let's go! ( marching band playing steady beat ) Hi, everybody.
LEADMALE:Nelson Flavor.
LEADFEMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:I'm Mork's friend.
LEADFEMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:I'm the guy that brought him here.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm Mork's friend.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, I am.
OTHERMALE:Vote for me, Flavor! Nelson Flavor.
SUPMALE:( crowd chattering ) Sure is a big day, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:ANNOUNCER: The Denver Broncos are proud to present the Pony Express and its newest member, pro football's first male cheerleader, Mork.
LEADMALE:Ooh, won't be long now.
LEADFEMALE:And here they are, the Pony Express.
SUPMALE:( marching band playing upbeat music ) ( crowd cheering ) Go get 'em, Mork.
SUPMALE:That's my boy.
LEADFEMALE:CROWD: Yay, Mork! Yay, Mork! ( crowd cheering ) CROWD ( chanting ): We want Mork! We want Mork! We want Mork! We want Mork! ( chanting continues ) ANNOUNCER: I'm sorry, folks.
OTHERMALE:It looks as though Mork has changed his mind.
LEADMALE:Mork, where are you going? Mork? Wait up.
SUPMALE:CROWD ( chanting ): We want Mork! Mork? Where are you? The crowd is calling for you.
LEADMALE:MORK: I'm in here.
SUPMALE:Which one? MORK: I don't know.
OTHERMALE:The number's on the outside.
LEADMALE:Am I angry? Sure.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, I realize it's not easy for a guy to go out in front of 73,144 people in a halter.
LEADMALE:But you squelched my chance at greatness.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson, leave him alone.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sure he feels bad enough already.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, it's probably my fault.
LEADFEMALE:The Democrats have a donkey.
LEADMALE:The Republicans have an elephant.
LEADMALE:I had to pick a guy in a skirt.
OTHERFEMALE:Where is he anyway? Try 1045.
OTHERMALE:( knocking ) Mork, it's me, Mind.
OTHERFEMALE:Why don't you come out? MORK: Be right down.
LEADFEMALE:I'm upstairs.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:I'd ask you in, Min, but the place is a mess.
LEADMALE:Mork, come out of there.
SUPFEMALE:What happened out there? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:Felt all right when I ran on the field.
LEADMALE:All of a sudden, I looked up and I saw thousands of orange faces.
OTHERFEMALE:Mm.
SUPFEMALE:And then I felt kind of ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:Then I guess I got chicken apples.
LEADMALE:I think it's called stage fright, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Actually, it's called Orkan law, Mind.
SUPMALE:We're not allowed to have meetings of more than six people.
LEADMALE:Why not? Well, the seventh one gets stage fright.
OTHERMALE:Well, I'll tell you something, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:I don't think I would have had enough nerve to go out there in front of all those people.
LEADFEMALE:Really? Mm-mm.
LEADMALE:I really don't.
LEADMALE:But look at it this way.
LEADFEMALE:Even though it didn't work out, at least you had the nerve to go out and try something you really wanted to do.
SUPMALE:A lot of people never even do that.
LEADFEMALE:So you're not a failure 'cause you ran off the field.
LEADFEMALE:You're a success because you ran on.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Thanks, Min.
LEADMALE:You made me feel better.
LEADMALE:Good.
SUPFEMALE:Now, why don't you change your clothes, and I'll buy you lunch.
LEADFEMALE:But can we not go out that way? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:The crowd, right? No, no.
OTHERMALE:It's a linebacker, "No Neck" Nedboy.
LEADFEMALE:When I ran out on the field, he winked at me.
OTHERFEMALE:He did? Okay.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( door opens, closes ) ( suspenseful theme playing ) Mork calling Orson.
OTHERFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Give me an F.
LEADMALE:Give me an A.
LEADFEMALE:Give me a T.
SUPFEMALE:Give me an S.
LEADFEMALE:Give me an O.
SUPFEMALE:What's that spell? ORSON: Mork! Sir, I was just thinking about you.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Well, I was cheering up, you pom-pomposity.
LEADMALE:It's something I learned on my new job this week.
SUPMALE:I joined a squad of lady cheerleaders.
SUPFEMALE:How did you pass as a woman, Mork? Well, I lied about my height, sir.
LEADMALE:Ar.
SUPMALE:You see, sir, everything here on Earth is divided by sexes.
LEADFEMALE:There's men's fashions, women's fashions.
LEADFEMALE:There's boy talk, girl talk.
LEADMALE:Stenographers, dictators.
LEADMALE:Do Earthlings always separate the men from the women? Oh, yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:They even have his and her towels.
LEADMALE:But the real difficulty comes when they try and separate the men's jobs from the women's jobs.
LEADMALE:Why do they do that? Maybe it's a question of quality.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I think it's a question of equality.
LEADFEMALE:You see, when you're dealing with people, it's hard to tell the value of the merchandise by looking at the shape of the package.
SUPFEMALE:I can paraphrase that and say, that sometimes the best man for a job is a woman.
SUPMALE:And in your case, Mork, the best woman for the job was you? Well, sir, I gave it a shot, but You know, sir, after centuries, these humans have tried so hard to prove that all men are created equal.
LEADFEMALE:It's kind of nice to know that they're still working at it.
SUPFEMALE:( as Walter Cronkite ) And on that positive note, that's all there is, there ain't no more.
SUPMALE:This is little Mork signing off from the planet Earth.
SUPMALE:Nanu, nanu.
SUPMALE:
