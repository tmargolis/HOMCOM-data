LEADFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! Able to leap over tall buildings? Hah! Anybody can do that in zero gravity.
SUPFEMALE:What's the big deal about that? They call him Superman for that? Oh, I'm perturbed.
OTHERFEMALE:I've got to write a letter about this.
OTHERFEMALE:Miss Smith, take some dictation.
LEADFEMALE:( in woman's voice ): No way! All right, I'll do it myself.
LEADMALE:Dear Superman.
LEADFEMALE:Ding.
LEADMALE:I am writing you this letter because I'm really perturbed.
SUPMALE:Ding.
LEADMALE:How can you call yourself a man of steel if you wear blue tights with the underwear on the outside? Ding.
LEADFEMALE:Everyone knows that Krypton is the Miami Beach of the Universe.
SUPFEMALE:Ding.
LEADMALE:You're a jive turkey in red booties.
LEADFEMALE:Ding.
LEADFEMALE:Love, your friend, Mork from Ork.
LEADMALE:Ding.
LEADFEMALE:PS, Don't you sweat a lot, wearing two suits? Ding.
OTHERFEMALE:Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, God bless you.
OTHERMALE:Do you know where I can get a stamp? Oh, sure, I think there's some over there in the drawer.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, good.
SUPMALE:Where are you sending a letter? Metropolis.
OTHERMALE:Well, I have to go to work early this morning, 'cause Grandma's not feeling well.
LEADFEMALE:( beeps ) Shazbot! ( loud banging ) Whoa! The mice must be taking steroids.
LEADFEMALE:It's that Bickley creep again.
LEADFEMALE:You mean that nice man that moved in downstairs? Nice?! ( banging ) Haven't you met him yet? No, I've been too busy reading these alien newsletters.
SUPFEMALE:Well, that Bickley character has been making my life miserable.
LEADFEMALE:While you're safe up in your attic, he's always pounding on his ceiling which happens to be attached to my floor.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, Mindy, one man's ceiling is another man's floor.
LEADFEMALE:That's some heavy apartment philosophy and you've got to remember that.
SUPFEMALE:And the worst part is, I'm not even a noisy person.
LEADMALE:( loud banging ) I can't stand it.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you earthlings must learn some more virtues, like being more tolerant.
LEADMALE:We have a saying on Ork, "Tolerance is next to cowardice.
LEADFEMALE:" Don't Orkans ever have any problems with unreasonable neighbors? Well, one time the planet next to us blew up, we all complained about it, and they never did it again.
LEADMALE:Well, that's wonderful, but I don't think I can wait for his apartment to blow up.
SUPMALE:I've been down there three times already and it hasn't done any good.
LEADFEMALE:You just have to learn to adjust.
OTHERMALE:How can I adjust to constant pounding? Oh, make it fun.
LEADFEMALE:Watch this.
LEADMALE:( singing to tune of Stayin' Alive): I can tell by the way you hold your teeth You're an older man with a lot to bequeath Ah, ah I can tell by the way you take that pill You're about to sign your only will Ah, ah, ah, ah Barely alive, barely alive! Mork, I don't have happy feet, I have angry ears and that guy is really bugging me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh? Well, you'll just have to be a little more acoustically understanding.
OTHERMALE:Understanding?! Well, why don't you go talk to him and see how understanding you feel.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, I got to get to work.
SUPMALE:I'll see you later, okay? Ciao.
OTHERFEMALE:Bye.
OTHERMALE:( sighs ) ( door slams ) ( loud banging ) No, thanks! I'll sit this one out! I give it about a 65, though! It's got a good beat, but a little hard to dance to! ( loud knocking ) Quiet up there! MORK: I'm not a ventriloquist.
LEADFEMALE:I'm out here.
LEADMALE:Oh, interruptions, interruptions Who are you? Hello, I'm Mork.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADMALE:No, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:Get out of here.
SUPMALE:( loud knocking ) Oh, what is it, what is it? I'm still Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I'm from upstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, you.
LEADMALE:I've been wanting to talk to you, Bigfoot.
LEADMALE:You and your noisy girlfriend have been driving me out of my mind.
LEADFEMALE:What a coincidence.
LEADMALE:She says the same thing about you.
SUPFEMALE:Look, I'm trying to work down here.
LEADFEMALE:It's tough enough without you guys tromping around up there.
LEADFEMALE:I'd rather live under the Harlem Globetrotters.
LEADMALE:Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.
LEADMALE:What are these? Those are greeting cards.
OTHERFEMALE:I design and illustrate greeting cards.
LEADFEMALE:What are greeting cards? A gold mine, that's what they are.
SUPMALE:Every simple-minded idiot whose mother has a birthday can't think what to blow his last sixty cents on.
LEADMALE:Eh, thanks to me, he can now send a simple, stupid, sappy card, filled with phony sentiment.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, that sounds fantastic! Read me one.
SUPMALE:Yeah, you probably would like this drivel.
OTHERMALE:"To my mother.
SUPMALE:" Ew.
LEADMALE:"Your smile to me is like the dawn" Oh, gee "Whose coming hides the darkness "and lifts the sorrow from my aching heart.
OTHERMALE:"If only I could tell you, Mother, "what your life has meant to mine, "then I could die a happy man, although it means we part.
LEADFEMALE:" ( sobbing ) That's beautiful.
SUPFEMALE:Garbage.
LEADFEMALE:How can you say that about your own poetry? Hey, it pays the bills.
LEADFEMALE:I don't have to like it.
LEADMALE:Oh, look.
OTHERFEMALE:Look at the pretty bunnies.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:A hunter I know lets me draw his rabbits before he skins them.
LEADFEMALE:Here's another one.
LEADMALE:"What is a friend?" Oh, brother "A person who is kind and just, "A person full of love and trust, "Who knows your faults but doesn't give a flying care Who, when you call, is always there.
LEADFEMALE:" Yeah, I know, I know.
SUPMALE:"A person who will e'er be true "A person who is just like you.
LEADFEMALE:" ( sobbing ) Swill.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's not only swell, it's fantastic.
LEADMALE:Read me another one, please.
OTHERMALE:I don't want to talk to you.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, but yet you are.
SUPMALE:See how considerate you're being? I'm not being considerate.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, and you're modest too.
OTHERMALE:( loud thump ) Oh, no, it's those kids again.
SUPMALE:I can't get any work done.
OTHERMALE:Hey! Hey, kid! Yes, you! Now that was a terrific throw.
LEADFEMALE:Let's see you do it again.
LEADFEMALE:( sharp thud ) Oh-ho! Amazing! Do you think you can throw it to me? Ah Oh-ho! Scuzzy little yard monkey! I really ought to take these down to the orphanage and sell them.
SUPMALE:You wonderful guy, you.
LEADFEMALE:What are you talking about? I know what you're trying to do.
LEADMALE:You're trying to hide it underneath that crust, but I know, deep down inside, you're trying to save that young kid's life.
SUPFEMALE:If he had taken this ball, he might have thrown it out in the street, then a truck would have come along and hit him, then he'd be in the hospital, and all of his little friends would have to send him get-well cards, and Oh, no, you're more than a wonderful guy, you're a saint! You gave up your own business just to save that little kid's life.
SUPMALE:Hey, kid! Here's your ball! My life has been miserable ever since he moved in.
OTHERMALE:Boy, that guy sounds like a real jerk.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, he's worse than that.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know how I can go on living there.
LEADFEMALE:I'll bet he'd pound if I dropped a hint.
LEADFEMALE:You know, your mother and I moved into this apartment once, and there was somebody next door who was pounding on the walls for two days straight.
LEADMALE:Well, finally, I had enough of it and I went next door to tell him off.
SUPMALE:Well, did you? Nah, I couldn't.
LEADMALE:It was a guy in traction and his nurse had died.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Dad! That did make my day.
LEADMALE:You want me to go over and talk to him? No, I can do it.
LEADFEMALE:It's just that I get so mad every time it happens.
LEADMALE:Mm, well, you see, that's just it, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Sometimes you have to learn how to handle these things without getting mad.
LEADMALE:Mm, that's what Mork says.
LEADFEMALE:In that case, maybe I'm wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, babe? Yeah? You the chick that sold me this album last week? Well, we sell that album.
LEADMALE:Do you have a receipt? You didn't give me a receipt.
SUPMALE:I always staple the receipt to the bag.
SUPFEMALE:You didn't give me a bag, honey.
LEADMALE:Well, what were you gonna do, listen to it on the way home? I'll handle this.
LEADMALE:Uh, what seems to be the problem? This chick you got working for you is trying to rip me off.
LEADMALE:I got no bag, I got no receipt, and I got a defective album.
LEADMALE:What's wrong with it? I don't like it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you can't return an album just because you don't like it.
SUPMALE:Well, I wouldn't return it if I did like it.
SUPMALE:You know, I don't like your attitude.
LEADMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy tolerance.
LEADMALE:What seems to be the energy problem here? I got a defective album.
OTHERMALE:It's, uh, it's scratched.
LEADMALE:Well, let's try and deal with this in a holistic way.
SUPFEMALE:Don't itch it and let it achieve its own energy and heal itself.
LEADMALE:I don't like your attitude.
LEADFEMALE:That's because you haven't got to know my essence yet.
SUPFEMALE:Tell you what.
SUPFEMALE:We'll get together, we'll have cocktails, and work out our karma together.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want to have cocktails with your karma.
LEADMALE:Well, we'll get together and have a natural breakfast, lunch or dinner.
LEADMALE:You know, I feel an incredible vibration from you.
LEADMALE:Let's share it.
SUPMALE:Come on, now, don't be afraid.
LEADFEMALE:There we go.
LEADFEMALE:You're an Aries, right? Yeah.
OTHERMALE:Fantastic! I knew it! I see an incredible potential in you.
LEADFEMALE:You know, there's an amazing being in all the universe that can be and you know what? I see a potential for you in show business.
LEADFEMALE:I play guitar! Fantastic! Wow, psychic! I knew it.
LEADFEMALE:Have your service call my service, and be here now if not, get there later.
SUPMALE:Ciao! Well, I have to admit that was really impressive.
OTHERMALE:Well, you just have to use kindness, that's how I overcame Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley.
SUPMALE:You went down to see Bickley today? Oh, yes.
LEADMALE:We're the best of friends now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on! Oh, yeah! He said stop by again real soon.
SUPFEMALE:By the way, when does hell freeze over? Best of friends.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:But Mindy, you have to be real considerate of him, he's getting a little old and you know, losing a little bit, because he must have asked me ten or 12 times if I wanted to take a hike.
OTHERMALE:Well, did you ever get around to talking about the noise problem? No, no, mainly we just talked about you.
LEADMALE:He must have been a repairman at some time or another, because he keeps wanting to fix your wagon.
SUPMALE:I bet he would, too.
SUPMALE:Well, he's not going to get the chance.
LEADMALE:Oh, yes, he will.
OTHERMALE:I invited him over for dinner, tonight at 8:00.
LEADFEMALE:And I feel the energy's right, so I'll catch you there.
SUPFEMALE:The gestalt is now.
LEADFEMALE:All right, let's see.
LEADMALE:We'll bus you into this neighborhood.
SUPMALE:We'll put up a tenement here.
LEADFEMALE:That should shock 'em.
SUPMALE:All right, we'll move Lester Maddox off the board.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good! By the end of the game, we should have the whole place integrated.
SUPMALE:Hi.
OTHERMALE:Hi.
LEADMALE:What are you doing? Playing Supreme Court.
LEADFEMALE:Well, not to change the subject, but I wish you would check with me before you go inviting anyone over here.
LEADMALE:Oh, you mean like Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Bickley? Yeah, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley.
OTHERMALE:And Susan Taylor, and that Russian guy, Sergei.
SUPMALE:Well, Mindy, there's an old Orkan saying that applies to this.
LEADFEMALE:You see, if someone pounds on your ceiling because they don't like the noise you're making, invite them over for dinner.
SUPMALE:What a wonderful saying.
SUPMALE:Look, Mork, I don't want Bickley in my apartment.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, see, there's an incredible energy right there, because he doesn't want to be in your apartment, either.
SUPMALE:And you talked him into it? Well, it wasn't very hard.
LEADFEMALE:I told him you'd fix him a nice dinner, then we'd all get together, we'd talk for Wait a minute! I'll fix him dinner?! Wow, dÃ©jÃ  vu.
SUPMALE:Uh-uh, you got that one wrong.
LEADFEMALE:You invited him over, so you fix him dinner.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADMALE:I'll make my bed, so I've got to hang from it.
OTHERMALE:You got it.
OTHERFEMALE:But I don't even know how to cook.
LEADMALE:I've never even met Julia Childs.
LEADMALE:Well, Mork, there's an old saying on Earth: Fake it.
LEADMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Impending culinary doom.
LEADFEMALE:So, what are we having for dinner tonight? Check.
LEADMALE:Ha-ha! Check? We haven't even eaten.
LEADMALE:Just a little off the side top ( pounding at door ) Come in, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley! How did you know it was me? I'd know your pounding anywhere.
LEADMALE:I brought you two a gift a bottle of bourbon.
OTHERMALE:Oh, how nice.
LEADMALE:Well, thank you.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADFEMALE:I always swipe a couple of these when I fly.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, look, little munchkin bourbon.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'd like a drink.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, sure, what'll you have? Bourbon.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, this is all we have.
SUPMALE:Well, you couldn't pickle a cricket in that.
SUPMALE:Well, I'm sorry, but we have nothing stronger than wine in the house.
SUPFEMALE:What about that 20-year-old scotch your father? Mork! Shh! That's for a special occasion.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it.
OTHERFEMALE:I hate Scotch.
LEADFEMALE:It's disgusting and putrid.
LEADMALE:Speaking of disgusting and putrid, my salad's burning.
LEADFEMALE:His salad is burning? Mork has a lot of exotic recipes.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you kids sit down.
LEADMALE:We'll start off with the appetizers.
LEADFEMALE:We'll begin with a little Maalox au gratin.
SUPFEMALE:A little cheese for the three of us.
SUPFEMALE:A little fromage Ã  trois.
LEADMALE:( honking bark ) Maalox You can sit over there Maalox? Oh! All I have here are three knives! I have four.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm sorry, I forgot the soup forks.
OTHERFEMALE:Soup forks? Bonjour, Madame et Monsieur.
SUPFEMALE:Welcome to Chez Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Tonight's specialty was going to be the chicken in butter sauce, but that slippery sucker got away.
LEADFEMALE:Monsieur, would you like to see the wine list? Yes.
LEADMALE:LÃ -bas.
SUPFEMALE:For you, smell the cap.
SUPFEMALE:Ah, a very good week.
LEADMALE:Monsieur, with this wine and a doorway, you'll have a fantastic weekend.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, Monsieur, for you, the specialty of the day.
SUPMALE:There we are, lÃ -bas.
LEADFEMALE:( speaks nonsense French ) For you, here we are.
SUPFEMALE:Okay BICKLEY: What's this supposed to be? ( with accent ): Le peas frozen.
OTHERFEMALE:You said you're always asking for "peas and quiet.
LEADMALE:" ( laughs ) But seriously, nice to have you here.
LEADFEMALE:I'll be right back.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll tell the chef you're here.
OTHERMALE:Yo, Al, we got people here! Start cooking, sucker! ( speaking rapid-fire gibberish ) These are delicious! What? They're not even cooked! Well, at least this way they don't lose any of their vitamins.
LEADFEMALE:I think maybe I will have some of that scotch.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, okay.
SUPMALE:That's a very good idea, Monsieur.
SUPMALE:You won't spoil your appetite that way.
LEADFEMALE:Now, for the secondary course for you ( speaking nonsense French ) Le poomph! What is what's this mess? Oh, en franÃ§ais, le soupe, en anglais, soup.
LEADMALE:Actually, it's a gestalt gumbo.
SUPMALE:You see the little tiny live shrimp? I couldn't bring myself to kill them once I looked in their eyes.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sorry, Monsieur.
OTHERMALE:Things aren't going too well.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get the busboy to clean up the excess.
SUPFEMALE:But first, a little entertainment for you.
LEADMALE:Carl Carl, quickly, come! Feelings Nothing more than I'm sorry, Monsieur.
LEADFEMALE:He's not worked since The Wizard of Oz.
LEADFEMALE:We had to give him a chance.
SUPMALE:Mm-mm! It's like a soup and sandwich, all in one.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I get it.
LEADMALE:You two are doing this so I'll leave.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:Mork is honestly trying to cook you a good dinner.
LEADFEMALE:But ( sings fanfare ) And now, Monsieur, for the spÃ©cialitÃ© de l'apartement le soufflÃ©! Whoa, cool it! It's ready now.
OTHERFEMALE:I need more scotch.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, are you sure you followed the recipe? Well, it called for beating eggs, and I couldn't bring myself to do that.
LEADFEMALE:That settles it.
LEADFEMALE:I can't take any more of this.
LEADMALE:But you haven't taken any of it.
LEADMALE:Let's just say I'm not hungry right now.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, that's all right, we'll put it in a doggy bag.
OTHERMALE:But for you, a grouch pouch.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, this is the first time Mork has ever cooked.
SUPFEMALE:Really? I never would have guessed.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Mork's dinner wasn't great, but at least he tried.
SUPMALE:He shouldn't have.
LEADFEMALE:You know, you should be more tolerant of people.
LEADFEMALE:Now, we've had to put up with a lot from you lately.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? Like what?! Like your constant pounding and your rudeness.
SUPMALE:You have been making my life miserable.
SUPFEMALE:I just complain a little.
LEADFEMALE:It's not that bad.
LEADMALE:It's terrible! Do you know that you're the worst neighbor I've ever had? Isn't it wonderful? You're the top of your field.
SUPFEMALE:Really? I'm that bad? Well, let's just say if the Marquis de Sade were still alive, you'd come in a close second.
LEADMALE:But, here's your consolation prize your snack sack.
OTHERFEMALE:If I'm so unlikable, why are you always nice to me? Well, I believe the meaner a person is, the nicer you should be.
SUPFEMALE:That's why I'm treating you like an emperor.
OTHERMALE:It's easy for you to be nice.
LEADMALE:You've got each other.
LEADFEMALE:I hear you laughing up here, and I'm down there all alone.
OTHERMALE:Well, if you treated people with a little kindness and respect, I'm sure you'd have lots of friends.
LEADFEMALE:Be reasonable, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:Not lots; a few, maybe.
LEADMALE:I don't mind not having friends.
LEADFEMALE:I just wish I had someone to come home to.
SUPMALE:You know, someone who needed me.
LEADFEMALE:Someone who cared for me.
LEADFEMALE:Someone Aw, I better say good night.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm beginning to sound like one of my own greeting cards.
OTHERFEMALE:There goes one sad earthling.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, that's for sure.
LEADMALE:What can we do to help? I don't think there's anything we can do.
LEADFEMALE:People just don't want to be around that man.
LEADMALE:We can hire someone.
LEADMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:It doesn't work like that, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:There's an there's an old Earth saying that, "There's one thing money can't buy, it's love.
LEADFEMALE:" By the way, thanks for the dinner.
LEADMALE:It stunk.
SUPMALE:( knocking ) Oh interruptions, interruptions.
LEADFEMALE:Who is it? Mindy McConnell from upstairs.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, what do you want? Hi.
LEADMALE:Can I come in? That depends.
LEADMALE:You intend talking to me? Well, yeah In that case, no.
SUPFEMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, are you are you embarrassed about last night? Why should I be embarrassed? You're the one who tried to poison me.
SUPMALE:You know what I'm talking about.
LEADFEMALE:The things that you said about being lonely.
SUPFEMALE:You believe that junk? I always talk that way after a couple of scotches.
LEADFEMALE:As a matter of fact, I did believe it, and that's why I baked you this cake.
SUPFEMALE:I want us to be friends.
LEADMALE:There's icing on it.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
OTHERMALE:I hate cake with icing.
LEADFEMALE:Do you know why I hate winter in Colorado? The Rockies look like they're covered with icing.
LEADFEMALE:Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley, how can you possibly stand here and? ( knocking ) Aw, probably some kids trying to sell me cookies with icing on them.
LEADFEMALE:Hiya, Bickey.
OTHERMALE:That's Bickley! Oh, that's my friendly nickname for you.
LEADMALE:Oh, why me? Mork, where have you been all morning? Out to disprove an old Earth saying.
SUPMALE:Look.
SUPMALE:( gasps ) I sprung him from an animal jail.
LEADFEMALE:He was in for assaulting a fire hydrant.
OTHERMALE:Oh, great.
SUPFEMALE:Now I'll have to listen to howling and barking all the time.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, you won't, because he sings and dances.
SUPFEMALE:Watch this.
SUPMALE:Camptown races, sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah! And he al and he also sings the blues.
SUPMALE:Georgia, Georgia He's for you because I don't want you to be lonely anymore.
LEADFEMALE:You mean why, that's that's the nicest thing anybody ever did for me.
LEADMALE:( sobbing ): Buying me a stupid dog.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork! That was a wonderful thing you did.
LEADMALE:What did you mean about disproving an old Earth saying? Well, that money can buy love.
LEADMALE:Even if it's only puppy love.
SUPFEMALE:I'll call him Bickey.
OTHERMALE:Sing, damn you.
SUPFEMALE:Sing You can do it.
LEADFEMALE:Camptown races, sing this song Pick up the beat.
LEADFEMALE:Sing! Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Laser Breath.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:ORSON: What are you doing, Mork? Acting superhero-ish.
SUPFEMALE:Funny, you don't look superhero-ish.
LEADMALE:Let's hear your report.
LEADFEMALE:Did you meet any interesting earthlings this week? Well, this week, I met an earthling who makes greeting cards.
LEADMALE:Those are what humans send to people who are sick.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't they just send a doctor, like we do on Ork? Oh, no, sir.
LEADFEMALE:You see, doctors are worshipped here.
SUPMALE:They don't come to see you.
SUPFEMALE:You go to see them.
OTHERMALE:And they also live in luxury hotels called hospitals.
SUPMALE:These hospitals are so overcrowded, the humans have devised a strange and unusual custom of gaining admittance.
LEADFEMALE:Like what? One's called "skiing.
SUPMALE:" They climb to the top of a huge mountain of sky flakes.
LEADMALE:When they get there, they strap two pieces of wood to their feet, and then they slide down.
LEADMALE:And if they're lucky, they hit a tree, and they gain admittance to a hospital.
LEADMALE:That sounds like a lot of work.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's nothing.
OTHERFEMALE:You should see how they gain admittance to a mortuary.
LEADMALE:Well, see you next week.
SUPMALE:Ten-four, huge buddy.
LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:
