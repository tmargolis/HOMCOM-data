LEADFEMALE:But mostly I just assist the manager.
SUPMALE:Stuff like that.
LEADMALE:Well, what are you doing? Me? Oh, well, I'm still single, and right now I'm lieutenant governor of Wyoming.
LEADFEMALE:- Wow.
LEADFEMALE:- Lieutenant.
SUPFEMALE:Mm! I didn't even know Wyoming had an army.
LEADFEMALE:So you don't mind if we have a dance for old times' sake, do you? Oh, no, take my wife, please.

LEADFEMALE:See you.
SUPMALE:Oh, yeah, have her back by 2.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, there they go! Smooch, smooch, smooch.
LEADFEMALE:Ha-ha-ha.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:That's all they ever did in school.
LEADMALE:Once I caught them necking behind the library.
OTHERFEMALE:Steve beat me up.
SUPMALE:But I respected him for it.
SUPFEMALE:I was a creep in those days.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPFEMALE:- Time sure does fly, doesn't it? - Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha.
SUPMALE:Aren't you even jealous? How can you just sit here and watch your marriage dissolve? Oh, pshaw.
LEADMALE:I mean, I trust Mindy farther than I can throw her.
LEADMALE:I mean, I don't have a jealous bone in my body.
LEADMALE:But I'm willing to rent one.
SUPMALE:Okay, here we go.
SUPMALE:Now, Evel, you get $50 million if you clear the three boxes.
SUPFEMALE:Okay? Got it, come on.
SUPFEMALE:Vroom.
SUPFEMALE:I hope he makes it.
SUPMALE:Don't you? Don't you? Don't you? He made it.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, how long are you gonna keep this up? It's just silly.
SUPFEMALE:Silly? Last night I saw a side of you that I rarely ever see, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
SUPMALE:What side? - Your back.
SUPFEMALE:Because your front was too busy talking to Steve.
LEADMALE:Mommy, are you and Daddy fighting? - Yes.
LEADMALE:- No, Mearth, sweetie.
LEADMALE:Your dad and I are just having a little disagreement.
LEADMALE:We really love each other very much.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, your mom and I love each other very, very much, but that's why we have to be alone for a moment.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you go in the bedroom and play with the invisible dog that Uncle Exidor gave you.
SUPMALE:Okay.
OTHERFEMALE:I just can't believe it.
SUPMALE:Come on, Pablo.
LEADMALE:Let's go.
SUPMALE:Pablo, come on.
LEADFEMALE:We're going to the bedroom now.
LEADMALE:Drop that.
LEADFEMALE:That thing's been dead for days.
LEADMALE:Drop it.
LEADFEMALE:Drop it.
SUPMALE:Arf, arf.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:You probably just think I'm overreacting, don't you? - Yes.
LEADFEMALE:- A silly Orkan venting his jealousy.
LEADMALE:- Hmm? - Mm-hm.
SUPMALE:It pretty well sums it up, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You're upsetting yourself over something I told you was over with ten years ago.
LEADFEMALE:I really think I deserve a little more of your trust than that.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess I have been kind of foolish.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, come to think of it, I don't even know what What's his name? Oh, Stevie.
SUPMALE:Stevie.
LEADMALE:Heh, heh.
OTHERMALE:So it's Stevie now? Oh, the pain, the anguish.
LEADMALE:The solitude.
LEADFEMALE:Now I know how the other two Supremes felt.
SUPMALE:Ain't no mountain high enough Ain't no river Mork, listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:The only reason there was ever a Steve in my life was because I hadn't met Mork yet.
SUPFEMALE:Do you understand? No.
SUPMALE:Okay, be that way.
LEADFEMALE:I really don't have time for this.
SUPMALE:I've gotta get to work.
SUPFEMALE:Bye, Mearth.
OTHERMALE:Mommy has to go to work.
LEADFEMALE:I'll see you later.
LEADMALE:Daddy, Daddy, who won? Well, we both did, son.
LEADFEMALE:You see, we had a little problem there, but now everything is just tutti-frutti.
SUPMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:- Hello.
OTHERMALE:- Flowers for Mindy McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thank you very much, and here's your tip.
LEADMALE:Never eat Mexican food and stand next to a flame.
OTHERMALE:Oh, what's in this? Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Isn't that neat? - You bought flowers for Mommy.
LEADFEMALE:- No, I didn't.
OTHERMALE:Heh.
OTHERMALE:- I'll carry these.
LEADMALE:- Let's see.
LEADMALE:No, I never bought any flowers for Mommy.
LEADMALE:Let's see here.
LEADMALE:"Mindy, it was wonderful seeing you last night.
LEADFEMALE:Let's not wait another ten years.
LEADMALE:Love, Stevie.
LEADFEMALE:" Who's Stevie? He's the lieutenant governor of Wyoming and your future stepfather.
OTHERFEMALE:Is that right? Well, Pablo, better saddle up.
SUPFEMALE:We're on our way to cattle country.
LEADMALE:Come on, Dad, blow.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mearth, you're such a comfort to me.
SUPMALE:Hope I get to at least see you on weekends and leap years.
OTHERFEMALE:Are you kidding? Mommy loves you, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:I know that, but the problem is that Mommy loved someone else before she loved me.
LEADFEMALE:That's very possible.
LEADFEMALE:But you must know now that she loves you more than anything in the world, Daddy.
SUPFEMALE:You're number one, you're the head honcho.
LEADFEMALE:I hope you're right.
SUPMALE:But what if you're wrong? Don't ask me.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't been able to cope with fractions yet.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna take these flowers and be sure that they stay alive.
SUPMALE:I guess I'll put them in the tub with Pablo.
LEADMALE:I don't think he'll mind after carrying that dead thing around.
SUPFEMALE:Pablo.
LEADMALE:Woof, woof, woof! I wonder if she would have loved me then.
SUPMALE:Well, I've got two choices.
SUPMALE:I can either stand here and talk to myself like a soap opera or go back in time and really find out.
LEADFEMALE:That's it.
OTHERMALE:I'll do it.
SUPFEMALE:I haven't used these in a long time, but now's a very special occasion.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well Of course.
LEADFEMALE:Look.
LEADFEMALE:Liberace's lounge slippers.
SUPMALE:I want those shoes.
LEADFEMALE:I was an alien when I met her.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go back, I'll be an alien again.
LEADFEMALE:It should work the second time around.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPFEMALE:Should work.
LEADFEMALE:Ready now.
OTHERFEMALE:There's no place like home.
SUPMALE:There's no place like severe pain in the ankles.
SUPMALE:No, wait.
LEADFEMALE:I'll go back in time.
LEADFEMALE:'71, here I come.
LEADMALE:'71, here I come.
LEADMALE:Red light! Red light! Nobody gets in here without a student ID.
SUPFEMALE:That's the rules.
SUPMALE:I am student.
SUPMALE:I am foreign-exchange student.
OTHERMALE:Happy to be in America.
LEADMALE:My name is Vladimir lvanovich Orkoff.
SUPFEMALE:But you can call me Chuck.
LEADFEMALE:Look, Chuck, I don't care if you're Doctor Zhivago.
LEADMALE:Nobody gets in here without a student ID.
SUPFEMALE:Beat it before I'm forced to get physical with you.
LEADFEMALE:- What seems to be the problem here? - This foreign guy's trying to crash.
LEADMALE:I'm trying to keep this gym safe for democracy.
OTHERMALE:Ah.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I think there's a more reasonable way to deal with this.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks, Pops.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:McConnell.
SUPFEMALE:Do I know you from someplace? I come by the music store all the time looking for a copy of Brezhnev Sings Ray Charles.
SUPFEMALE:You know: Georgy, Georgy Look, Dickie, he's an exchange student.
LEADFEMALE:- I think we can let him in.
LEADMALE:- Tsk.
SUPMALE:Thank you very much.
LEADFEMALE:If you ever come to Soviet Union, I can get you such beautiful women.
LEADMALE:You know, Soviet girls.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, especially since you're the only guy here without a date except for me.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADMALE:Who is she? She is one foxy mammal.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, I would walk ten miles in the snow just to stand in her garbage.
OTHERFEMALE:That's Mindy McConnell.
LEADMALE:You might as well forget it.
SUPMALE:I've been after her since the second grade.
SUPFEMALE:You'd think by now I'd at least have gotten a pity date.
LEADMALE:She's only got eyes for that nerd Steve.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I don't care what you say, I am going to marry her.
LEADFEMALE:Dream on.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, she's got a Jiffy Pop hairdo too.
SUPFEMALE:I may not be a poli-sci major, but I still think that history will prove that Nixon is a great president.
LEADFEMALE:I think Karl knows what he's talking about.
SUPMALE:He writes for his college paper.
SUPMALE:Really? Do they have a good Journalism Department at Columbia? Come on, Snooks.
OTHERFEMALE:How are you gonna be a reporter? In a newspaper, you can't dot your I's with little hearts.
LEADMALE:Give me a break, Stevie.

SUPMALE:How are you? Permit me to introduce myself.
LEADMALE:I am foreign-exchange student Vladimir Ivanovich Orkoff.
OTHERFEMALE:But you can call me Lumpy.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, but would beefy all-American type mind if I trip the light fanatic with his princess all-American beauty? Are you kidding? This is a gag, right? - You're in the Drama Department? - No.
LEADFEMALE:No gag, please.
SUPFEMALE:For one dance, I will give you actual autographed picture of Joseph Stalin.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, you don't have to do that.
LEADMALE:- Really? - You know Stalin? - Personably.
SUPMALE:- Some other time, okay, pal? - Sorry.
SUPMALE:Later.
LEADMALE:On the rebound.
LEADMALE:So tell me, Vladimir, what part of France are you from? I wish you'd just mellow out, Steven.
SUPMALE:The poor guy's from a foreign country.
SUPFEMALE:I don't know why you're being so uptight tonight anyway.
LEADFEMALE:I just thought he was kind of immature for a senior.
OTHERFEMALE:Steve.
OTHERFEMALE:Steve, some of the guys are drinking beer in the bathroom.
LEADMALE:If you came with me, they'd let me watch.
LEADFEMALE:Beer? Be right back, Snooks.
LEADFEMALE:Great.
SUPFEMALE:So you're gonna leave me here and go get loaded.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, if it wasn't in the boys' room, I'd take you with me.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
LEADMALE:- Yo.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:So do you like being a foreign-exchange student? Oh, it's not bad.
LEADMALE:It's I come to Boulder to study Russian literature.
OTHERFEMALE:Boy, that's kind of redundant, huh? Heh, heh.
LEADMALE:You know, my art teacher went to Russia once.
SUPFEMALE:She said Well, she said it was, like, really different than from here.
SUPMALE:Well, it's all right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, let me enunciate to you.

SUPMALE:- Oh, you want me to dance with you? - Oh, please.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going steady.
LEADMALE:But I thought this was the land of the free and the home of the foot-long hot dog.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, it is.
OTHERFEMALE:- All right, I'll dance with you.
LEADMALE:- Oh, whoa.
SUPFEMALE:I must do like you do.

OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I guess we are pretty lucky here.
SUPMALE:You know, I was thinking about maybe being a journalist.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd really like to tell people what's going on in this country.
OTHERFEMALE:- Right off.
LEADMALE:- But I don't know.
LEADMALE:It's kind of a hard field for a woman to break into, and I don't know if I'd be any good at it anyway.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, you must, uh, go for it, you know? - Really? - I think that someday your family will be so proud of you.
LEADMALE:Thanks, that's really nice.
LEADMALE:How do you say "thank you" in your country? Oh, um Well, like this: Oh.
LEADMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:That's nice.

LEADMALE:I have my green card.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, please.
LEADMALE:I would not like to do Esther Williams - Steve, that's enough.
LEADFEMALE:- Attention! Attention! This is the moment we've all been waiting for.
LEADFEMALE:It gives me great pleasure right now to announce the names of this year's prom king and queen.
LEADFEMALE:I hope this isn't another failing notice.
SUPFEMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, act your age, not your IQ.
OTHERMALE:Ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:And the winner is Katharine Hepburn! Just kidding.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, big surprise.

SUPFEMALE:Smile.
OTHERFEMALE:It's the biggest night of your life.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, it just might be, Steve, because this is our last date.
LEADMALE:- What? - I used to think you were a really nice guy, but I've changed my mind.
LEADMALE:Later.
SUPFEMALE:Lumpy, will you dance with me? Oh, you're asking me, a humble peasant? Whew.
SUPMALE:Ten years in two minutes flat.
OTHERFEMALE:The in-flight movie wasn't that bad either.
LEADMALE:They finally found a place to show Heaven's Gate.
LEADMALE:- Hi.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, hi.
SUPMALE:Mind I came back because I feel that we really haven't cleared the air about Steve.
LEADMALE:Aw.
LEADMALE:Come on, now, Mind, that's all in the past.
SUPFEMALE:You know, jealousy's just insecurity, and you've never ever given me anything to feel insecure about.
LEADMALE:I love you.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You know, sometimes I think I've waited my whole life for you.
LEADMALE:Thanks for showing up.
OTHERMALE:Well, thanks for waiting.
LEADMALE:I better go check on Mearth.
LEADMALE:Today we're gonna teach Pablo how to avoid hair balls.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I picked you up a little something.
LEADMALE:- Oh, that's nice.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:- A little surprise.
LEADFEMALE:- Mm-hm.
