LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
SUPMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( joyful theme playing ) ( imitates drill ) Mork, what did you do to the toaster? I'm preparing for that day when you throw me out with ( Southern accent ) nothin' but a fine-toothed comb.
LEADFEMALE:When you go, you're taking a ski, a slipper, and half a toaster? Yes, indeed.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't you think that I read the papers and watch the TV? Listen, when I leave, I'm suing you for half of everything you own.
OTHERMALE:It's called "community property," baby.
LEADFEMALE:It's called the "Marvin Syndrome.
LEADMALE:" Well, I get half of everything you own, too, you know? Oh, so big deal.
OTHERFEMALE:Half of your Billy Barty poster.
LEADFEMALE:If you just take the top half, I still have a poster.
OTHERMALE:And I want half of your three bags of sand.
SUPMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:Now it's alimony.
LEADFEMALE:Please, don't throw me out.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do anything you want.
LEADMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:All right.
OTHERFEMALE:Hey, look, Mork why were you worried that I was going to ask you to leave? Did I say something or do something? I've been reading the s-ss-ss I've been reading the s-ss-ss I looked at the figures on divorce, and the odds are against any couple staying together forever.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know.
SUPMALE:I think that's kind of sad.
LEADMALE:That's probably because when people first get together, they're just crazy about each other, and then as time wears on, the excitement kind of wears off.
OTHERMALE:I'm still crazy about you.
LEADMALE:And I'm still crazy about you, too.
LEADMALE:Good, then we have nothing to fear but sanity itself.
LEADMALE:You've got nothing to worry about.
LEADMALE:Mindy, promise me that things will always stay exciting for us.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, I can't because they won't.
LEADMALE:But I think of it as getting comfortable, not humdrum.
OTHERFEMALE:What a coincidence.
LEADFEMALE:I used to play humdrum in my school band.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you did.
LEADMALE:( humming ) I'll bet you were great on the national anthem.
LEADFEMALE:The Orkan anthem has no music.
LEADFEMALE:It's three minutes of sucking through your teeth.
OTHERFEMALE:( sucking ) Yeah, well, you can't dance to ours either.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, listen, do you want to meet me for lunch this afternoon? Well, no, you see, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley invited me down to the mall to this new Italian restaurant called Della Contessa.
SUPMALE:I think that's delicatessen.
SUPFEMALE:( Italian accent ) Doesn't sound very Italian.
LEADMALE:It's owned by my girlfriend Jeanie and her brother.
LEADFEMALE:Bickley took me there and stuck me with lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Hope you didn't have shish kebab.
SUPFEMALE:Ar, ar.
LEADMALE:Well, I gotta go to class.
LEADMALE:Okay, Mork, I'll tell you what.
LEADMALE:I'll do my part to keep this relationship exciting.
SUPMALE:Tonight I will make us a romantic little Italian dinner for two.
SUPMALE:Well, I'll do my part in trying to keep the it exciting.
OTHERMALE:Tonight I'll put a bomb in your cannoli.
LEADFEMALE:( joyful theme playing ) ( clattering ) Snippy.
SUPMALE:Inconsiderate.
LEADMALE:Ungrateful chowderhead.
LEADFEMALE:Pigheaded, overbearing, ungrateful pea brain.
LEADFEMALE:I knew we shouldn't have moved out here.
LEADMALE:What do you mean? We would have had the same argument in New York.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yeah? Yeah.
LEADMALE:Well, there, I could have given you a little pop.
SUPMALE:Here, I get arrested for "violatin' your space.
LEADFEMALE:" Remo, remind me when I become a doctor to open up your skull and see what makes ya thick.
LEADMALE:Ah.
SUPFEMALE:( sighs ) ( bell dings ) Enjoy.
LEADMALE:May I help you? Yeah.
SUPMALE:I'd like the bacon, lettuce, and tomato, with coleslaw and a cup of coffee, please.
LEADFEMALE:One BLT, one slaw, one java.
LEADMALE:Hi.
LEADFEMALE:How may I help you? May I ask you a question? Oh, I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:Everything's good.
SUPMALE:That's not the question.
LEADFEMALE:Um, do all the waitresses and cooks fight like you two? Only when the waitress has a brother with all the class of a Gong Show reject.
SUPFEMALE:What would you like to eat? Well, I'd like a squealer on a honky no goyam and a side of John darks.
LEADFEMALE:What? Oh, it's a ham on white, no mayonnaise, with lots of french fries.
LEADFEMALE:A number 3.
LEADFEMALE:Excuse me.
LEADFEMALE:What are you fighting about? Okay, look Remo was the last one out last night, and he forgot to lock up this place.
LEADFEMALE:You know, it's like he wants us to get robbed so we'll have to close it and move back to the Bronx.
LEADMALE:You live with the Denver Broncos? Hello, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Bickley.
LEADFEMALE:Bick, my main grump, what's happening? Hey, Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley, what'll it be today? Uh, I think I'll have the fried chicken and a bowl of chili, all to go.
SUPFEMALE:MORK: I'll get it.
OTHERFEMALE:Chirp and a burp.
LEADFEMALE:Hotshot.
LEADFEMALE:Fire one.
LEADMALE:Oh, thanks, Bickley, for inviting me out to lunch.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I'm a prince.
SUPMALE:It seems like that waitress knows you.
SUPFEMALE:Jeanie? She should.
OTHERFEMALE:I've brought a new customer in here every day for lunch since they opened.
OTHERMALE:I hate to tell you this, they're having a terrible fight.
LEADMALE:Oh, yeah? Great.
LEADFEMALE:I love floor shows.
SUPMALE:I thought it's bad to fight with someone you care about.
OTHERMALE:Nah.
LEADMALE:It's a great way to keep a relationship fresh and exciting.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, exciting.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy and I never had a fight.
SUPMALE:Really? My wife and I used to fight like cats and dogs.
LEADMALE:She'd throw a plate at me, and I'd call her mother filthy names.
LEADMALE:And then she'd slam my lips in a drawer.
LEADFEMALE:Boy, those were the days.
SUPMALE:Uh, okay, number three here, and a chirp and burp.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Bick, you think Mindy and I can keep our relationship exciting like you and your wife? Sure.
OTHERMALE:The best thing two young kids could do is have a real rousing, knock-down, drag-out fight.
SUPMALE:Since you live upstairs from me, make it a quiet one.
SUPFEMALE:Were to.
SUPFEMALE:I was not the last one out last night.
OTHERMALE:You were.
LEADFEMALE:I was not.
LEADFEMALE:( in unison ) You were.
LEADMALE:REMO: You were.
LEADMALE:Remember you left one of your stupid medical books in the kitchen.
LEADMALE:You came back to get it.
SUPMALE:What do you mean my medical books are stupid? You should talk with all the dumb muscle magazines you read.
LEADFEMALE:What dumb muscle magazines? Those are physical fitness manuals.
OTHERMALE:Muscle, muscle, muscle.
SUPMALE:Don't push me.
LEADMALE:'Cause I'll do what you hate.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Remo, go flex yourself.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, that's it.
LEADMALE:Fingernails on the blackboard.
LEADFEMALE:( screeching ) Ah.
LEADMALE:Remo.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know why I'm sendi" you through medical school.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, how are you gonna look at a lung if you can't look at a blackboard? Lungs don't squeak.
LEADFEMALE:Ow.
SUPMALE:What happened? Oh, I cut my finger on that dumb cheese grater.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on, you big baby.
LEADMALE:It's just a scratch.
LEADFEMALE:What do you mean, a scratch? That's a gash.
LEADMALE:Gashes almost always bleed.
SUPFEMALE:Well, give it a minute.
LEADMALE:Remo, look.
LEADMALE:Sit down here.
OTHERFEMALE:You know, you gotta be more careful with that thing.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADFEMALE:I just get in a hurry sometimes.
LEADMALE:Why, well, take it easy.
SUPFEMALE:Look, you sit here, have a soda, and I'll finish up with this stuff, okay? Hey, come here.
SUPMALE:Thanks, short stuff.
LEADFEMALE:Anytime.
OTHERFEMALE:Ow.
SUPFEMALE:You starin' at me? Yup.
SUPFEMALE:Yuh.
OTHERFEMALE:Uh-huh, uh-huh.
SUPMALE:You got some sort of problem, buddy? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:What's your name? Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Run that by me one more time.
SUPMALE:( deep voice ) I said Mork, already.
LEADMALE:Mork Allreddi? You Italian? Astral hatchling.
LEADFEMALE:New York, the east side.
SUPFEMALE:New Ork, dark side.
LEADFEMALE:Hey.
LEADMALE:How are ya? Nanu.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, na Yeah, nanu? Well, it's nice to know ya.
SUPMALE:It's nice to be known.
OTHERMALE:Could I ask you something personal? How personal is it? It's about your sister.
LEADFEMALE:Forget it, she's a med student.
LEADMALE:She'd only be interested in your pancreas.
LEADFEMALE:What I'd like to know is, you two were fighting hard, then you stopped.
OTHERFEMALE:Why? Oh, I cut my finger, and she's a sucker for blood.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, vampire, eh? Not your type, O.
LEADFEMALE:Ar, ar.
SUPMALE:Will you keep on fighting? Well, we're gonna have fights.
SUPFEMALE:But it's a way to get rid of pent-up frustrations.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, so these fights can be valuable? Sure.
SUPMALE:You argue, and then you kiss and you make up.
LEADMALE:Whoa-oa-oa.
SUPMALE:That sounds great.
LEADFEMALE:Who knows? If you have a real big fight ( upbeat theme playing ) Ah.
SUPFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:You scared me to death.
LEADMALE:Well, I'm glad you're home.
LEADMALE:Dinner's almost ready.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't you sit down, and I'll set it up.
LEADFEMALE:There's a little extra spaghetti sauce on the table if you want some more.
LEADFEMALE:And let's get the garlic rolls, and we'll be all set.
SUPMALE:You expect me to eat this slop? What is going on? You talk about more of the same.
LEADFEMALE:DÃ©jÃ  slop.
LEADFEMALE:What are you doing? I'm putting your buns in orbit, that's what I'm doing.
LEADFEMALE:What is wrong with you? I'm tired of eating food that the airlines would turn down.
LEADFEMALE:I've seen cockroaches go, "no way!" I thought you liked my cooking.
LEADMALE:You had a thought? Ar, ar, ar, ar.
OTHERMALE:Didn't think there was anything under that barbie-doll hairdo.
LEADMALE:Whoa, look: Echo.
OTHERFEMALE:Echo.
LEADMALE:Echo.
LEADMALE:Why don't you shave it all off and get yourself a mohawk? It would draw attention away from your nose.
OTHERMALE:My nose.
LEADFEMALE:What's wrong with my nose? It's shiksa city.
OTHERFEMALE:And your feet.
LEADMALE:Whoa.
LEADFEMALE:Where do you get your shoes? Barnum and Bailey? Ah, ah, ah.
LEADMALE:And what's that wonderful fragrance? Oh, no, Old Spice.
LEADMALE:Ship ahoy, ship ahoy Maybe it's Indian leather.
SUPFEMALE:( Indian accent ) We make a fragrance from the cow that has been dead for four days and lying in the sun.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mindy, don't whimper.
OTHERMALE:It makes you look like a Pekingese with asthma.
SUPFEMALE:( panting ) It makes your eyes look even closer together.
OTHERMALE:( squeals ) Okay, it's your turn.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:I just can't believe ( sobbing ) Boy, this is gonna be great.
LEADFEMALE:( triumphant theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Mindy.
LEADMALE:Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Min.
LEADFEMALE:It was the best fight I've ever seen.
SUPFEMALE:Was it good for you too? Come on, now, it's time to kiss and make up.
OTHERMALE:Kiss and make up? I wouldn't kiss you if you were the only alien on earth.
LEADMALE:I think I am.
LEADMALE:Well, there's your proof.
SUPMALE:So, you don't like my cooking, huh? Well, if you don't like it, why don't you get off your face and cook something for yourself? Yeah.
SUPMALE:You don't know it's not that easy to be living with a monster from outer space.
OTHERMALE:Most guys just leave the cap off the toothpaste, right? You eat it.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, fight's over.
LEADMALE:King's X.
LEADMALE:Fight's over, my foot.
LEADMALE:So, you don't like my hairstyle, huh? Well, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Taste, where'd you get these rags, a fire sale at Disney World? She didn't mean it.
SUPMALE:Oh, and by the way, since we're into honesty, I'd like to inform you that your normal voice sounds like Truman Capote on helium.
LEADMALE:( imitating Mork ) I'm Mork from Ork.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
LEADMALE:( normal voice ) But you can just call me space turkey.
LEADFEMALE:Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar, ar.
SUPMALE:Ow.
LEADMALE:Ow.
OTHERMALE:See, I'm I'm cutting myself.
LEADFEMALE:Look, look, no blood.
LEADFEMALE:There will be.
SUPMALE:Blood, blood.
LEADFEMALE:Bleed, bleed.
LEADMALE:Mork, that's such a shame.
SUPFEMALE:We'll have to have that taken care of.
LEADMALE:I'll call the veterinarian.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, I think I've made a mistake.
SUPFEMALE:You made the mistake? I made the mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I should have listened to my father.
LEADMALE:I never should have let you move in here.
SUPMALE:If he told me once, he told me a million times: "Mindy, stick to your own species.
LEADMALE:" I guess I'll just go up to bed.
LEADFEMALE:Go up to bed, my foot.
LEADFEMALE:There is an egg leaving in 10 minutes.
SUPMALE:Be in it.
LEADFEMALE:Mindy.
SUPMALE:My lips aren't that long.
LEADMALE:Min, Min, Min.
LEADMALE:( knock on door ) REMO: Hey, we're closed.
SUPMALE:You gotta help me, please.
LEADMALE:It's a matter of life and death.
SUPFEMALE:Look, was there an accident? If anyone's hurt, I hope it's below the knee 'cause that's all I've studied.
LEADMALE:There was no accident, but two people really got hurt.
SUPMALE:Look, sit down, and just tell us what happened.
SUPMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you know, um I live with a very beautiful, wonderful girl named Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:Min Oh, I know Mindy.
LEADMALE:You must be Mork.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah, um, and she's fantastic for me, and we've never had a fight before.
LEADMALE:Today I saw you two having a fight.
SUPMALE:You said after the fight you kiss and make up.
SUPFEMALE:So I went home and tried it, but things didn't work out.
LEADMALE:So she got mad and threw me out of the house.
SUPFEMALE:And you can't kiss through a tiny lock unless you have little, little lips.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:You mean, you started a fight, but you weren't mad at her? You're supposed to be mad? Whoa.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
LEADMALE:It sounded like a wonderful game.
LEADMALE:I think I've ruined a wonderful thing.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you can go talk to her, negotiate.
LEADMALE:You'll be Kissinger, I'll be Sadat, she'll be Begin.
LEADMALE:Look, don't worry about it.
LEADFEMALE:Let me go and try and talk to Mindy, and see if I can explain things to her.
LEADMALE:And why don't you talk to our friend here about apologies? Hey, uh, it occurs to me that we haven't been formally introdu My name is Remo Da Vinci.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Leonardo's boy.
SUPMALE:Yeah, Leo's my pop.
LEADFEMALE:Look, um Mork When you, like, try and imitate me, you know, you gotta understand something.
LEADMALE:Yo, yo, yo.
SUPMALE:I'm a complex type of guy.
OTHERFEMALE:I operate on a whole bunch of different levels.
LEADMALE:Kind of like a surgeon in an elevator.
SUPMALE:You see, when my sister and I yell at each other, we're not really mad.
LEADFEMALE:And sometimes when people fight, you know, um They go too far like you did.
LEADFEMALE:And then there's got to be an apology, you know.
SUPFEMALE:So we're gonna make one up for ya.
LEADMALE:How do you do that? There are a couple of different ways you go on this apology thing.
LEADFEMALE:Um Oh, I don't know, you could, uh Oh.
LEADFEMALE:You could you could get her some flowers, or or maybe you could send her some candy.
LEADMALE:That'd be all right.
LEADFEMALE:That's no good.
SUPMALE:All the stores are closed by now.
LEADMALE:There must be some other way.
LEADMALE:Well, the best way is to I don't know, just to just to get a really big apology, you know.
LEADFEMALE:You're gonna have to swallow your pride ( gulps ) You take a deep breath ( inhales ) And you just say, "I'm sorry.
LEADFEMALE:" ( high-pitched voice ) I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:Look, just say you're sorry, like in your normal way.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Go ahead.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Mindy, I'm sorry.
SUPFEMALE:I'm snake spit, I'm nothing, I'm low.
OTHERFEMALE:All right, all right.
LEADFEMALE:I forgive you.
LEADMALE:Then we can kiss and make up.
SUPMALE:No, don't kiss me.
SUPFEMALE:( melodramatic theme playing ) Mindy, I got to apologize, 'cause the fight you had with Mork was all my fault.
LEADMALE:Actually, it was Remo's and my fault.
LEADFEMALE:Actually, it was all Remo's fault.
SUPMALE:Come on, Jeanie, how do you figure that? Remo convinced Mork that fighting was the best way to work out problems.
LEADFEMALE:Mork wasn't even angry.
SUPFEMALE:He wasn't? You know, all Mork said to me is that he wanted to keep things exciting between you two.
LEADMALE:That's it.
LEADFEMALE:Mork said that? That's what he said.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, brother.
LEADFEMALE:I should've known.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Mork really isn't capable of losing his temper.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know Mork that well, but right now, he's out there somewhere trying to figure out how to apologize.
SUPMALE:Mindy and I had our first fight.
LEADFEMALE:Congratulations.
SUPMALE:No, it was horrible.
LEADFEMALE:I did the things like you said.
LEADFEMALE:I called her awful stuff, she called me terrible stuff, then she locked me out.
LEADMALE:Sounds like a reasonable first fight to me.
LEADMALE:Has a good beat, easy to yell to.
LEADFEMALE:I give it a 7.
SUPMALE:( laughs ) But I need your help, Bick.
SUPMALE:You see, y-you know more about fighting than anyone I know.
SUPMALE:How did you and your wife get to kiss and make up? We never did.
SUPFEMALE:Is that the way you're supposed to end an argument? It is, but ours never ended.
SUPMALE:It started the day we got married, and went on for 15 solid years without a letup.
SUPMALE:Oh, then what happened? One day, she threw me out of the house, locked the door, and I never saw her again.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe you could help me write an apology of some sort.
SUPMALE:Apologize? That's the worst thing you can do.
SUPFEMALE:It's like admitting you were wrong.
LEADFEMALE:But I was wrong.
SUPFEMALE:Well, all the more reason to lie.
OTHERFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:Let me write that down.
LEADFEMALE:Look, it depends on the situation.
LEADFEMALE:Once I missed our anniversary dinner.
OTHERFEMALE:I told my wife I forgot.
LEADFEMALE:But in a really tough spot, I always rely on natural disasters.
LEADMALE:Disasters.
LEADFEMALE:Late for a meeting, freak thunderstorm.
SUPMALE:Don't wanna go to your mother-in-law's house, avalanche.
LEADMALE:If that doesn't work, can I get a card? Maybe that'll help too.
LEADFEMALE:All right, if you think it'll do you any good.
OTHERMALE:I think I've got a Here.
LEADFEMALE:Here's an apology card for you.
SUPMALE:Aw, thanks, Bick.
SUPMALE:( knocking on door ) I bet I know who that is.
LEADMALE:I bet I do too.
LEADMALE:Now, Mindy, you give this guy a chance to apologize, 'cause it's the only thing that's gonna make him feel any better about this.
OTHERMALE:'s okay? 's okay.
SUPMALE:'s all right? 's all right.
OTHERMALE:Okay, open the door.
LEADMALE:Jeanie, thanks.
LEADFEMALE:You're welcome.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, Jeanie and I ( groaning ) Where am I? Where am I? What have I done? Who am I? Mork Thank you.
LEADFEMALE:Who are you? Mindy.
SUPMALE:That's who you are.
SUPMALE:Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:And you wouldn't believe this, Mindy, I've had amnesia for the last 24 hours.
SUPMALE:And I hope I haven't said or done anything real stupid.
LEADMALE:You've had what? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:It's catching.
SUPFEMALE:You poor little thing.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:I don't have amnesia, and you don't have amnesia.
LEADMALE:Well, not now.
LEADMALE:It's a miracle.
SUPMALE:It's a miracle.
LEADFEMALE:I'm free.
LEADFEMALE:You saved me.
LEADMALE:You touched me, and I'm born again.
LEADMALE:I'm not buying it.
LEADFEMALE:You're not buying it? No.
SUPFEMALE:All right, the reason I I said all those awful things was, well There was a tidal wave.
LEADMALE:It picked me up.
LEADFEMALE:It just grabbed me.
OTHERFEMALE:I was in the middle of this great big wa ( imitating surfer ) it was really mellow.
SUPMALE:'cause I caught the wave.
LEADFEMALE:There I was about to be tubed, and I said, "wow.
LEADFEMALE:I'm there.
LEADFEMALE:" And I'm goin' down the side of this huge wave, and I said, "wow.
LEADFEMALE:Denver or bust.
OTHERFEMALE:" You know? It's gonna be incredible.
SUPFEMALE:That's amazing, Mork, because the nearest ocean is over a thousand miles away.
LEADFEMALE:A thousand miles away.
OTHERMALE:A long way.
SUPFEMALE:Well, the real reason I said those things is, you know, it's a full moon.
LEADMALE:Look what happened.
LEADFEMALE:See? Already it's taking effect.
LEADMALE:And I-I'm a weremork.
SUPFEMALE:I hate to tell you that, Mindy.
LEADMALE:( growling ) I believe this one, Mork.
LEADMALE:Tidal waves, full moons, and you're a weremork.
LEADFEMALE:You believe it? Then let's kiss and make up.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, come on.
LEADFEMALE:Now, I thought our friendship was built on honesty.
SUPMALE:Don't you feel bad for making up these stupid stories? Yeah, I guess I should buy a house in San Clemente.
LEADMALE:Mork, if you're trying to apologize to me, why don't you just say what you feel in your heart? And if you do, I just might accept, and, uh, maybe we can kiss and make up.
SUPFEMALE:Really? Because I've got a lot of ways to apologize.
OTHERMALE:Here they are.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh-oh.
LEADFEMALE:What's this? It's my "bag," you know? I got you these chocolate kisses.
OTHERFEMALE:Be careful though, they leave little brown hickeys.
LEADMALE:That's all right, Mork.
SUPMALE:I accept your apology.
SUPFEMALE:Wait, I still have some more ways to apologize.
OTHERMALE:Here's a card that Mr.
LEADMALE:Bickley wrote me.
LEADFEMALE:( clears throat ) "Hearing you were sickly, sailor, made my timbers shiver.
OTHERFEMALE:Hope you're getting over cirrhosis of the liver.
SUPFEMALE:" Mork, that isn't an apology card.
LEADMALE:Well, I saved the best for last.
LEADFEMALE:I really misunderstood about fighting.
LEADMALE:And I didn't know those things I was saying would be so awful, and I never meant them.
LEADFEMALE:I'll never, ever say them again as as long as I'm here.
LEADFEMALE:Will you forgive me? I forgive you, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Now, have we gone through all the possible apologies? The four possible ways to apologize on earth, but then there are the 83 Orkan methods.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, I forgive you.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERFEMALE:I have to suck my teeth through 10 choruses of the Orkan national anthem.
LEADFEMALE:Then I beat myself with a canary, then we go to Las Vegas, I pretend my right arm is longer than left.
LEADFEMALE:Mork I forgive you.
LEADMALE:Then we have to Don't press your luck.
OTHERFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) MORK: Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Yo, great cosmic pachyderm.
SUPFEMALE:( whistles ) I'm glad you called, Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:The committee would like you to study something on earth called the "nuclear family.
LEADFEMALE:" Sir, are those the ones who have all the bombs? No.
SUPFEMALE:I'm talking about a mother, a father, a sister, and a brother.
LEADMALE:Well, sir, I'm halfway there.
LEADFEMALE:I met a sister and a brother, and they own a food factory called a "delicatessen.
OTHERFEMALE:" What do they manufacture? Oh, a wonderful thing called "sandwiches," sir.
LEADFEMALE:I'm sending you today's special in the express egg.
LEADFEMALE:It's a pastrami on rye with mayo.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:Sir.
LEADMALE:Now, what happened with this family you met? Well, sir, I understand why you call them nuclear, because as soon as I met them, they blew up.
OTHERMALE:It must have been exceedingly messy.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, it was, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It caused a chain reaction, then Mindy and I had a fight.
OTHERMALE:Did you explode? No, sir, the both of us got hurt.
LEADFEMALE:See, what happened is, sir, I pretended to be mad, but then she really got mad.
LEADMALE:Did she knock the stuffing out of you? No, sir, you see it wasn't a physical fight.
SUPFEMALE:Here on earth, sometimes people throw words instead of punches, and it can be much more painful.
LEADFEMALE:That's why it's easier for a broken arm to mend than it is for a broken heart.
LEADMALE:This is Mork signing off until next week, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Nanu, nanu.
