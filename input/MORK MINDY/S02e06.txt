LEADFEMALE:Oh, I'm sorry.
SUPMALE:My boss said this would be funny.
LEADFEMALE:I thought an alien would be funny too, but I guess not.
LEADMALE:Was it good for you? Mort, I know you're working at a novelty shop, but, please, don't bring your work home with you.

LEADFEMALE:By the way, what is this message you left for me? N-F-C-S-T-H-W-C-O.
LEADMALE:And what does that mean? Nfcsthwco.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, Mork.
LEADMALE:And what does that mean? Nelson Flavor called and said he would come over.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
OTHERMALE:I'm practicing shorthand so I can have an exciting career as a credit neurologist.
LEADMALE:Nelson Flavor's my cousin.
LEADMALE:A what? He's the son of my crazy, rich aunt.
LEADMALE:What's a cousin? Somebody who's related to your parents.
SUPMALE:Oh, you've struck a sore note there, Mindy.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm a test-tube baby.
LEADFEMALE:Even I'm not related to my parents.
LEADMALE:Why have I never met this man? Well, he's just so straight.
LEADFEMALE:All right, you want to know what he does for a living? He manufactures attachÃ© cases.
LEADFEMALE:Sounds like a brief career.
LEADMALE:Ah, but that's his bag, though.
SUPFEMALE:Arr! He is the kind of guy that you always get the feeling he's trying to sell you something.
LEADMALE:He's always slapping you on the back and shaking your hand.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, combination mugger and masseuse.
LEADMALE:You know, you always have a way of looking at the bright side.
LEADMALE:Well, I have to, Mindy because, you see, today I got fired from my job.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, Mork, not another one.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, I sold a whoopee cushion to a deaf man.
LEADMALE:Jeez.
SUPMALE:I only have three music students left.
LEADFEMALE:We're starting to run kind of low on money.
LEADFEMALE:Well, I have another possibility for a job today.
LEADFEMALE:I'm going to feed the animals at the zoo.
LEADFEMALE:Especially the baby elephants.
LEADFEMALE:( knock at door ) I'd take them for Chinese.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, but probably the MSG will make them a little bit hyper.
LEADFEMALE:Probably will, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:That sounds like something you can handle.
LEADMALE:Maybe I'll get them stoned first and they'll get the munchies.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy McConnell, how you doing? Just fine.
SUPFEMALE:Nelson Flavor, at your service.
LEADMALE:I know, Nelson.
SUPMALE:Gee, I'd give you one of my cards, but I left them in my other dress.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) What a little kidder.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Oh, we used to have such F-U-N.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Uh, Nelson, I want you to meet my good friend Mork.
LEADFEMALE:How do you do, Mork? ( buzzing ) Ah! ( chuckles ) Two little kidders.
LEADMALE:Oh! He was working in a novelty shop.
OTHERFEMALE:Lot of fun.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) Well, Mindy, uh, reason I stopped by is, you're my most favorite cousin.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Hey, wait.
LEADMALE:Honesty time.
LEADMALE:You're my only cousin.
SUPFEMALE:That's right.
LEADMALE:And I just stopped by to say, "Hey, how you doing?" Well, I'm Well, I'm doing fine.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, since Dad and Grandma sold the music store, I've been teaching music on the side NELSON: Great.
LEADFEMALE:Now, with me there's fantastic news.
LEADFEMALE:I've decided to go into politics.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, gee, I guess that means I won't be getting an attachÃ© case this Christmas.
LEADMALE:Oh, darn.
SUPMALE:Oh, yes, you will.
OTHERFEMALE:You see, the city-council post is just a part-time job, so I'll be keeping my business.
SUPMALE:Oh, well, I wish you the best of luck, Nelson, but, uh, isn't the election over a year away? Oh, yes, it is.
LEADMALE:I gotta start now if I want my name to become a household word.
LEADMALE:Oh, like "fungus" or "Johnny Mop.
SUPFEMALE:" Sort of.
SUPFEMALE:You see, Mindy, the reason I stopped by is that it There are so many, many women in my district, and I wanted to ask you what they think.
OTHERMALE:About what? Anything.
LEADMALE:Radioactive fallout.
SUPFEMALE:What do women think about radioactive fallout? Uh, they're against it.
LEADFEMALE:( in female voice ): Hell, no, we won't glow! Fascinating.
LEADFEMALE:There's a lot more to this politics business than meets the old eyeball.
OTHERMALE:This city-council post is a steppingstone to the pinnacle, the ultimate.
OTHERMALE:Owning your own gas station.
LEADMALE:Almost.
SUPFEMALE:I want to be the next Vice President of the United States, like my hero, Walter Mondale.
OTHERFEMALE:That's quite an ambition.
SUPMALE:You think I'm aiming too high? Well, that's what I want out of life.
OTHERFEMALE:I've studied everything about Walter.
LEADMALE:You know he lives in Minneapolis? I read that he lives in obscurity.
SUPFEMALE:( chuckling ): Friend of yours.
LEADFEMALE:I want to have everything that Walter has.
SUPMALE:I want the power, I want the glory.
LEADMALE:Everything.
SUPMALE:Well, excuse me.
SUPMALE:I I'm a little confused by one thing.
SUPMALE:Isn't it the purpose of every politician to serve people and help them? Heck of an idea.
SUPMALE:You know, that's crazy, but it's just crazy enough to work.
LEADFEMALE:I'll do it to help people.
OTHERMALE:Hey, listen, Nelson, if you really are interested in the female point of view, why don't you hire me? Yes! You could be my campaign staff.
LEADMALE:How soon can you start? Sooner, if necessary.
SUPMALE:Good.
LEADMALE:Let's go! Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mork, will you call Jeanie and tell her I can't meet her for lunch? Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:Tell her I got a job.
LEADMALE:All right.
SUPMALE:And have a great election.
LEADMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, no, it's gone! Mindy! Mindy, Mindy, Mindy! Mindy! What? What? Have you seen my ex? ( loud bang ) Cigar? Sure.
SUPFEMALE:Big joke till somebody gets hurt.
LEADFEMALE:You could put a eye out.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) Okay, see, fellas, it's like this: You get this broomstick, you put a little tape on the end of it, you hit the ball, and then you run after it.
LEADMALE:See? Kind of like baseball.
LEADMALE:Okay, let me get this straight.
LEADMALE:There is absolutely nothing about this game that will help me grow as a person? I've never heard it described like that.
LEADFEMALE:It's It's stickball.
LEADMALE:You know, it's, uh You play it in the street.

SUPMALE:It's a heck of a game.
LEADFEMALE:It's, uh, super.
LEADFEMALE:Okay, well, so much for bringing the Bronx to Boulder.
SUPFEMALE:Hey, you know what? You should have told them the stick was organic.
LEADMALE:These people are incredible.
LEADFEMALE:They don't even leave me tips.
LEADMALE:Oh, there is one guy, however, who does tip me transcendentally.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, good.
LEADFEMALE:Next time, give him a transcendental burger.
SUPMALE:No buns, no meat.
LEADMALE:( chuckles ) You know, Mork and Mindy are the only normal ones we've met.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, right.
LEADFEMALE:Well, speak of the devil.
SUPFEMALE:( imitating preacher ): The devil! Yea, though he wanders around, he can hide in the kreplach and nail you.
LEADMALE:Come forward now.
LEADFEMALE:You can leave the potato salad.
SUPMALE:Do you know why? Say "pourquoi" if you know why.
LEADMALE:Do you believe? Are you asking? Pourquoi? Butter! Come on home! You believe! Well, at least Mindy's normal.
LEADFEMALE:How you been? Not bad.
OTHERFEMALE:I I got fired from another job.
LEADMALE:Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:Sit down.
LEADMALE:What happened this time? Well, you know, I was supposed to feed the baby elephants, so I gave them peanut butter and their trunks got stuck to the roof of their mouth.
SUPFEMALE:Then one of them sneezed and flew across the zoo.
SUPMALE:But it's all right, though.
LEADFEMALE:I've got an idea for a corporate franchise.
LEADMALE:It'll be called, um, Mork's Ice Palace.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:And my motto will be, "I only have ice for you.
LEADFEMALE:The best you ever thaw.
SUPMALE:" ( laughs ) That's a great idea, but what are you gonna do when summer comes? Stop production.
LEADFEMALE:Don't want to flood the market.
LEADFEMALE:Look, don't be discouraged.
LEADMALE:I must have tried a dozen different things before I found something I really liked.
OTHERFEMALE:What, running a deli? No, lying in the sun.
LEADMALE:Boy, I gotta tell you, Mork, I am really proud of my big brother here.
SUPFEMALE:He gave up all that just to put me through med school.
SUPMALE:Oh.
OTHERMALE:Wish I had a job so I could be proud of me.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, come on.
SUPMALE:Don't worry about it.
LEADMALE:Hiya, Mork.
SUPMALE:Nice to see you.
LEADFEMALE:How's it going? Mindy said I could find you here.
LEADMALE:Are these your friends? Oh, Nelson Flavor, this is Remo and Jean.

SUPFEMALE:Well, in New York.
LEADFEMALE:Awfully nice talking to you people.
OTHERFEMALE:Listen, Mork, I've got a little problem.
OTHERMALE:I wonder if you could help me with it.
LEADMALE:Yeah, that's good thinking.
OTHERFEMALE:He'll make it a big problem.
SUPMALE:Remo! I've got too much work.
LEADMALE:Far much more work than Mindy can possibly handle.

OTHERMALE:Me? There's no one else here.
LEADMALE:You mean me? Oh, joyous exaltation.
LEADFEMALE:Hallelujah Hallelujah Whoo! Hot dog! Yeow! Woah-ho-ho-ho! I'm okay, now.

SUPFEMALE:Hey, Morko, don't blow it.
LEADMALE:Hey, uh, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckles ) Mork, what are you doing with that money? I always see people forget it, so I'm gonna give it back.

LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:Eighty bucks a week isn't much.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute! Did you say $80 a week? Mm-hm.
OTHERMALE:He's only paying me 60.
SUPFEMALE:That's because I'm an executive.
LEADMALE:You're an executive? My title is "office girl.
LEADMALE:" Well, you get me a dress and I'll be an office girl.
SUPMALE:Well, how we doing today, team? Ha, ha, ha.
LEADFEMALE:How you doing, Mindy? Well, that depends, Nelson.
LEADMALE:Why are you paying him more than me? Oh, he's an executive.
SUPMALE:So, what does that mean? He gets a bigger stapler? No, that means that he does all the important, difficult jobs, so you're free to make coffee.
OTHERMALE:What are you, Nelson? Some kind of a male chauvinist? Well, look, I don't mind making a little coffee, but there's no reason why he shouldn't too.
LEADFEMALE:Well, all right.
SUPFEMALE:I'll go get a pan and fry some up right now.
SUPMALE:I'm I'm sorry, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I thought making coffee was what women did.
SUPFEMALE:Isn't it genetic? Oh, sure.
LEADFEMALE:I'm getting some negative vibes right now.
OTHERFEMALE:You want me to hire another girl? Why not let the boy do it? ( in Southern accent ): I'll just go in the backyard.
LEADFEMALE:You know, get out of the house This entire subject is academic.
LEADMALE:I have some very important news.
LEADMALE:Are you interested? After close scrutiny of my financial status, I decided that I can only afford to pay one of my assistants.
LEADMALE:MORK: No.
LEADMALE:The first job I was ever able to keep, and I wasn't able to keep it.
SUPMALE:NELSON: Oh, no, I don't want to fire you.
LEADMALE:Your work's been excellent.
LEADFEMALE:Well, you sure can't fire me.
SUPFEMALE:You'd die of thirst.
LEADFEMALE:That's true.
LEADMALE:Therefore, in the true spirit of American competition, I'm gonna let the two of you battle it out to the death.
LEADMALE:I can't.
LEADFEMALE:I I care a lot about Mindy.
SUPFEMALE:And besides, what would I do without me? Uh, no, no, that was a That was a kind of a figure of speech.
LEADMALE:I'm going to observe you for a couple of days, and I'm gonna choose one of you.
LEADMALE:Oh, let her have it, please.
OTHERMALE:She needs a job more than I do.
OTHERMALE:No, no, no, wait a minute, Mork.
LEADMALE:I do want the job, but you can't just give up.
LEADFEMALE:If you want something, you gotta fight for it.
LEADMALE:I don't want to fight you.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but it's not that kind of fighting.
LEADMALE:Competing is healthy.
LEADFEMALE:Well, are you gonna compete? Sure.
LEADMALE:All right.
LEADMALE:I don't want you to compete against yourself, so I'll compete too.
SUPMALE:Good boy! I wish you good luck.
LEADMALE:And may the best man win.
LEADFEMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) ( yawning ): Oh, yeah! Any coffee? One sec Sure, I have it right here, just the way you like it.

SUPFEMALE:Oh, I didn't want any with cream.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you don't want it with cream? I have the history of coffee right here.
SUPMALE:We've got your cappuccino.
OTHERFEMALE:We have a little bit of espresso right there.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! We've got your coffee with cream, without cream, with sugar, with lots of sugar for your hypoglycemics, and coffee with no coffee at all.
SUPMALE:Whoop! Listen.
SUPFEMALE:Can you hear inflation? Too late.
LEADFEMALE:Very, very, very impressive.
SUPMALE:Very impressive.
SUPFEMALE:But why do you have one without coffee? Well, it's kind of a Zen coffee.
LEADMALE:It doesn't keep you awake at night and gives you kind of that nirvana buzz.
LEADMALE:( imitates buzzing ) Very efficient.
SUPFEMALE:Very efficient.
LEADMALE:Efficient.
SUPFEMALE:Me, Morko.
LEADMALE:Min.
SUPMALE:Yes? Are you mad? ( chuckles ) Do I look mad? Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Mork Min? I'm mad.
LEADMALE:Why? I thought we'd both try to do the job as best we could.
LEADMALE:I know.
LEADFEMALE:You're busy trying to prove you can hold a job, and I'm busy trying to prove that Nelson's a sexist.
LEADFEMALE:Don't all humans have sex? See, there are just some people that believe that men are more capable than women.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's ridiculous.
SUPFEMALE:Men and women are equal throughout the universe except on Venus.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah? What's so special about Venus? Dogs rule the planet and the cats have to make the coffee.
SUPFEMALE:The point is, is we're acting ridiculous.
LEADFEMALE:Look at us.
LEADMALE:So let's try to handle this situation in a mature, adult manner, okay? I agree.
OTHERMALE:Good.
SUPMALE:Excuse me, can I help you? Well, I hope so.
LEADFEMALE:I sell prosthetic dog ears for Doberman pinschers.
LEADMALE:Yeah, I'll help you better, though.
SUPMALE:Well, I got a problem.
LEADFEMALE:I cater to the curb trade and Oh, well, if you have a problem, I happen to be Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Flavor's personal secretary Well, I'm his personal executive secretary, and I'll kiss and make it better.
SUPFEMALE:No lie.
LEADFEMALE:( chuckling ): Yes.
SUPMALE:Don't mind him.
SUPFEMALE:He's really not a well man.
LEADFEMALE:I, on the other hand, am a very capable woman who is privy to even the most top-secret aspects of Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Flavor's campaign.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, but I'm his campaign manager.
OTHERFEMALE:Say, it with me, now: Nelson Flavor! You know it.
SUPFEMALE:BOTH: Nelson Flavor.
LEADMALE:You're a fan of it.
LEADMALE:It's vanilla.
SUPMALE:We're talking all-American, melting in the hot sun ( screams ) moist, with a cherry on top! Uh, sir? Uh Uh, I wish you'd come out of there.
SUPFEMALE:We're We're really trying to help you.
LEADMALE:Something going on here? No.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Just trying to hold the wall up.
SUPFEMALE:Hold the wall up.
LEADFEMALE:Foundation's weak.
SUPMALE:What was that? Big rat.
LEADMALE:Who's in there? Pinocchio.
LEADFEMALE:Are you Flavor? Uh, yes, I am.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a problem, Flavor.
LEADMALE:I'll I'll I'll help you with your problem but first you'll have to come out of the closet.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, I don't think that's his problem.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
LEADFEMALE:Tell the goons to take a walk first.
LEADMALE:Is that all? No.
LEADMALE:Look, I'm in canine prostheses.
LEADMALE:Mm-hm.
SUPFEMALE:The city's tearing up the pavement in front of my store.
LEADFEMALE:I thought maybe you could stop it.
OTHERFEMALE:No problem.
LEADFEMALE:I'll take care of it personally just as soon as I'm elected.
SUPFEMALE:You have Nelson Flavor personally to thank.
LEADMALE:Here, have a hat.
OTHERFEMALE:Take this brochure.
SUPFEMALE:Read up all about me.
LEADMALE:Don't thank me.
LEADFEMALE:Thank the friends who gave us all those contributions.
LEADMALE:Word of advice, Flavor, with these two around, I wouldn't run for office.
SUPFEMALE:I'd run for cover.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, Nelson, don't you think there's probably a good reason why the city is tearing up that man's sidewalk? There is? This is probably a more complex issue than I thought.
LEADFEMALE:Uh Uh, Mork, give me a full report on this subject.
OTHERMALE:Right away.
LEADFEMALE:All right, how is this one? How about this for a byline: "Sidewalks aren't all they're cracked up to be.
SUPMALE:Need concrete solution"? Fantastic! Ha-ha! I love the way this boy thinks! Wait a minute.
LEADMALE:What a mind.
SUPMALE:Did you hear that? Nelson, shouldn't I write that report? I mean, after all, I was hired first.
LEADMALE:I have seniority.
LEADMALE:Oh, so now you're pretending to be a Mexican? Look, Nelson, if you want to get elected, you're gonna have to pay attention to the women's vote.
SUPMALE:Now, what about Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Hodges? She's the head of the Women's Political League in Boulder.
OTHERFEMALE:She's a very important person.
LEADMALE:Yes, that's true, and she's a woman too.
LEADFEMALE:And my landlady, Mrs.
SUPFEMALE:Burns.
OTHERMALE:She's a woman too.
LEADFEMALE:They're everywhere.
LEADFEMALE:I can help you with all of them.
SUPFEMALE:Hm.
LEADMALE:This is becoming harder and harder by every You got the political savvy, and you've got all the contacts.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, prepare a report on who you think I should hire for this.
OTHERMALE:Get me in triplicate.
OTHERMALE:Give me the original, you keep a copy, and, uh, throw a copy away.
OTHERMALE:Wait a minute! Mork! Come on Nelson! Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:I tell you what.
LEADMALE:I'll make my decision this evening.
LEADFEMALE:You two take the night off on me.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, I'll see one of you later.
SUPMALE:( laughs ): Get it? Well, Mindy, maybe you're right.
LEADMALE:We should be mature about this.
SUPMALE:Deal with it as adults.
SUPFEMALE:I'll tell you what.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll race you home.
LEADFEMALE:You forget, I have wheels.
LEADMALE:Ah-ha! But I've got more of them! ( upbeat them playing ) ( chuckles ) ( thump ) Are you still mad at me? Oh, Mork, do I look mad? Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:You're catching on.
LEADMALE:Min, what's wrong? We used to have so much fun.
SUPMALE:I know, Mork.
SUPFEMALE:It's all because of this dumb job.
LEADMALE:Well, you take the dumb job.
SUPMALE:No.
LEADMALE:Listen, tell you what.
SUPMALE:Tomorrow morning, we'll both go down there and we'll both tell him that if he can't find the money to To pay us both, then we'll both quit.
SUPFEMALE:It's a deal? It's a deal.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
LEADMALE:On Ork we call it a partnership or a group corporation.
LEADMALE:Really? Same thing on Earth.
LEADMALE:Small world, aren't it? ( knock at door ) I'll get it.
OTHERMALE:Uh! ( clears throat ): Excuse me.
SUPMALE:I wonder who that is.
OTHERFEMALE:Sounds to me like someone with knuckles.
SUPFEMALE:Hiya, Mindy! Hi, Nelson.
SUPMALE:What are you doing here? Well, I was out politicking in the neighborhood and, uh, thought I'd come by.
SUPFEMALE:I've, uh, made my decision.
OTHERMALE:Well, we've made a decision too, Nelson.
OTHERFEMALE:We've decided that no job is worth what you've been putting us through.
LEADFEMALE:And Mork and I care for each other very much, but having to compete like this is making us act like different people.
LEADFEMALE:And we don't like those kind of people.
LEADFEMALE:So you either hire the both of us or we both quit.
OTHERFEMALE:I accept your resignation.
OTHERMALE:Listen, none of your political jargon, now.
LEADFEMALE:I don't want any Nixonisms.
LEADMALE:I want the truth.
LEADMALE:Honest answers.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, now, clown prince.
LEADFEMALE:How about it? Whoo! Right here.
LEADFEMALE:I'm ready for it.
LEADMALE:Let me have it.
LEADFEMALE:That was an answer.
LEADFEMALE:We're out.
LEADFEMALE:We are? I'm terribly sorry, but I realized I have a moral obligation to hire a minority.
LEADMALE:I'd like you to meet her.
LEADFEMALE:Suzy! Oh, here, let me carry those for you.
SUPMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:She's a minority? Uh, Swedish.
OTHERFEMALE:That should help you with the bleached vote.
LEADFEMALE:Just one more thing, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I'm speaking to a women's rights rally tomorrow and I wanted to know what's a good subject to speak about? How about, um, looking nice for Mr.
SUPMALE:Right? I think they'll really respond to that.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, thanks.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'll see you guys later.
LEADMALE:Us blonds are gonna go have more fun.
OTHERMALE:( laughs ) Rod Stewart.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, we We go see Rod Stewart? No, we're not going to see Rod Stewart! Well.
LEADMALE:Well, I've lost another job, haven't I? Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, look at it this way: You You've already got a job observing Earth, right? Right.
LEADMALE:And you're doing pretty well at that, right? Well, I I guess you're right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, so, what does it matter that you're having a little trouble finding the right Earth job? Well, doesn't matter.
SUPFEMALE:Good.
LEADFEMALE:So at least we're friends again.
SUPFEMALE:No.
SUPFEMALE:Why not? We haven't sealed our partnership.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:All right, well, on Earth, we do that by shaking hands.
LEADFEMALE:On Ork, we do it by trading clothes.
LEADMALE:( upbeat theme playing ) MORK: Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPFEMALE:ORSON: So, Mork, did you finally get that job you've been talking about? Oh, not exactly, your bloatness.
LEADMALE:It seems here that on Earth, everyone finds a need to compete with each other.
SUPMALE:They compete in sports, in work, in everything.
SUPMALE:What do they get if they win? Something called an ulcer, sir.
LEADMALE:I don't know what it is, but it must be wonderful because everyone who's successful gets one.
LEADFEMALE:I guess it'll be a while before you put an ulcer on your mantelpiece.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh, noshu, chiefsmoke.
LEADFEMALE:Although Mindy and I did have a competition.
SUPMALE:Oh? Who won? We both did, sir.
LEADMALE:We decided to stick together.
LEADMALE:That's very good, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You're learning about cooperation and maturity.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, your preachiness.
SUPFEMALE:I've learned that even though you win that ulcer, it's no fun if you've lost the one that you wanted to share it with.
LEADMALE:Till next week, nanu, nanu.
LEADFEMALE:
