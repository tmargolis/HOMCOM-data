LEADMALE:You know, I love this part of the day.
SUPMALE:When we get a few hours to ourselves.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:You know what would make it really perfect, little pooter precious? - Not again.
OTHERMALE:- Oh.
OTHERMALE:Come on.
LEADFEMALE:We came so close last time.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, all right.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, yay.
OTHERFEMALE:I want you to know this is the third time since the 11:00 news.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, heh-heh.
LEADFEMALE:Alrighty.
SUPFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:At a four-way stop, who has the right of way? Let's see.
LEADFEMALE:Any vehicle driven by a teamster.
LEADFEMALE:No.
LEADFEMALE:Now, Mork, with answers like that, you're never gonna get your license.
SUPFEMALE:I'll get served in restaurants where the ma√Ætre d' goes: "You wanna sit down now?" Can you be serious for a minute? - Certainly.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
OTHERMALE:Mommy and Daddy, I can't sleep.
SUPFEMALE:The neighbors are so noisy.
LEADFEMALE:By the way, what does "cheap floozy" mean? Never mind.
SUPMALE:Why don't you lie down next to Daddy? - Come on, Daddy.
OTHERFEMALE:- I don't wanna lie down next to Daddy.
LEADMALE:Teddy, what do you see, Teddy? Teddy always see something.
LEADFEMALE:Over there, Teddy.
LEADFEMALE:Here we go, Teddy.
SUPFEMALE:You little sniffer.
LEADMALE:What is it? Teddy sees cookies.
LEADFEMALE:Yes, maybe I will lie down with Daddy.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, you've got two choices.
SUPMALE:We can finish the story we started at naptime and you can go to bed, or you can just go to bed.
SUPMALE:I think the choice is pretty obvious.
SUPFEMALE:All right, while you kids have fun, I'm gonna work out why half the people on the road found it and the other half never lost it.
SUPMALE:Let's see, hand signals, we have a Let's see, right turn, left turn, ethnic neighborhood, right on, for sure, totally, maybe we don't know.

LEADFEMALE:- Are you ready? - Yes, Teddy's listening too.
LEADMALE:"The maiden told Rumpelstiltskin the king would behead her if she didn't spin all the straw into gold by dawn.
LEADFEMALE:Rumpelstiltskin offered to save her in exchange for her firstborn child.
LEADFEMALE:" You know something, Mommy? I've heard this story so many times.
LEADMALE:That's where the maiden remembers Rumpelstiltskin's name and marries a prince.
LEADFEMALE:End of story.
LEADMALE:That's not how it ends, is it, Mind? - I'm afraid so.
LEADFEMALE:- Muh! You ruined that story for me.
LEADMALE:And now, you wanna know something? Wanna know what I know about Santa? - Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- He's All right, Mind.
SUPFEMALE:All right.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna tell you something, Mommy, very honestly.
LEADFEMALE:These fairy tales are for babies.
SUPFEMALE:I really think I've progressed to Joseph Wambaugh.
OTHERMALE:Mearth, you know, when I was a girl, I couldn't read enough fairy tales.
LEADFEMALE:I used to dream that I could spin straw into gold so that I could be a princess and live in a big castle.
LEADMALE:Get ready for a real winner now, son.
LEADMALE:It was a beautiful castle.
OTHERFEMALE:I had my very own white stallion named Snowball.
OTHERFEMALE:Or No, no, Snowflake.
LEADFEMALE:Or something like that, something to do with winter.
SUPMALE:Anyway, we would ride Snowflake, or Snowball, or whatever his name was, to the neighboring castle where Ricky Nelson, who was the neighboring prince, lived.
LEADMALE:Ricky Nelson and I would get on Snowflake and go My stories aren't so bad.
LEADMALE:I'm a riot at bridal showers.
LEADMALE:All right now, son, I want you to add one cup of faditche.
SUPFEMALE:Put it in there, that's it.
LEADMALE:Don't be too liberal with that.
OTHERFEMALE:And a little bit of nipgeeze.
LEADMALE:There it is, a little touch of nipgeeze there.
SUPMALE:Mm-hm.
OTHERFEMALE:That's it.
SUPFEMALE:Just a pinch.
LEADFEMALE:All right, and one kosher salami.
LEADMALE:Here we go, there we are.
LEADMALE:Hey, Mearth.
LEADFEMALE:Mearth, your grandpops has done it again.
SUPFEMALE:I got a couple of tickets to the Ice Capades.
SUPMALE:Of course, I had to go to a scalper.
LEADMALE:Oh, you've been going to one of those for years, haven't you? Very funny, Mork.
SUPMALE:Ver Hey, this is a pretty sophisticated piece of equipment.
OTHERMALE:What are you two doing? We're making gold for Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:You're making gold? What did I just get through saying? You've got to learn to pay attention, Grandpops.
SUPMALE:But, Mearth, you can't make gold.
SUPMALE:Nobody can.
SUPFEMALE:That's why it's worth $400 an ounce.
LEADMALE:Oh, come on now, Pops.
OTHERMALE:Four-hundred dollars an ounce? If you were saying mustard or sand, I could say, "Hey.
LEADMALE:" But gold, that much? Get off it there, Dad.
LEADMALE:- I think it's ready, Daddy.
LEADMALE:- All right.
SUPMALE:Pops, can we borrow your tie, please? - My what? - What did he say? Didn't he say give him your tie? - You just don't listen.
LEADFEMALE:- All right.
LEADFEMALE:I'm about to turn this bargain-basement tie into pure gold.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, ho-ho.
SUPFEMALE:This is gonna work.
LEADFEMALE:I know it will, son.
SUPFEMALE:Here it is.
SUPFEMALE:Ready? Give it five seconds.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Yes.
SUPFEMALE:No.
OTHERMALE:Mork, you may be my son-in-law, but think about this: I've never taken a picture with you.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, Mearth, let's go.
LEADMALE:See you later, Goldfinger.
SUPMALE:If there were advice I could give you, Daddy, don't sweat it.
LEADMALE:What went wrong? What? Wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:This cheap tie is pure silk.
LEADFEMALE:The recipe calls for polyester.
SUPFEMALE:Yes.
SUPMALE:Improvise.
LEADMALE:This will do it.
SUPFEMALE:Put it in there.
OTHERMALE:You've got to do it for me.
SUPMALE:Please.
LEADFEMALE:Or I'll lose my government grant.
SUPMALE:There are no more government grants.
OTHERMALE:Who cares? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADFEMALE:Yes! I've done it.
LEADFEMALE:They didn't believe me.
LEADMALE:I did it.
LEADMALE:We're filthy rich.
OTHERFEMALE:We'll never have to pay taxes again.
SUPFEMALE:You bought this mansion? We made 3 tons of gold.
LEADMALE:We could have bought Zambia.
LEADFEMALE:Wow.
LEADMALE:Yes, this is the downstairs reading room.
SUPMALE:Upstairs we have periodicals and books by the Wallace family.
SUPMALE:- Mork, it's huge.
LEADMALE:- Well I mean, I've never seen a room with a horizon before.
LEADMALE:You're probably wondering how I get the books down from the top shelf.
LEADFEMALE:Uh, with our helicopter? Close, but no banana.
LEADMALE:Heh.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, Ms.
LEADMALE:Beasley! Yes, Mr.
LEADMALE:McConnell.
LEADFEMALE:Perhaps a little poetry? D.
SUPFEMALE:H.
OTHERMALE:Lawrence, E.
LEADMALE:E.
LEADMALE:Cummings, B.
LEADMALE:B.
LEADMALE:King? Oh, not today.
LEADFEMALE:Maybe tomorrow we'll play a little one-on-one and a half.
SUPMALE:Well, Mind, should I show you the zoo now or later? What was that? Oh, probably just the chef taking the gardeners home.
LEADFEMALE:- We have a jet? - Well Oh, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:This is just all so much for anyone to have.
LEADFEMALE:Why do I feel guilty about not feeling guilty? Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind, my little WASPette.
OTHERMALE:Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:For the first time in our relationship, I can provide for you and fund public television.
LEADMALE:So just humor me, huh? But, you know, this house is just It's really too big for just the three of us.
LEADMALE:I don't know how I'm gonna keep it up.
LEADMALE:Well, reach out and touch someone because, you know, help is just a tinkle away.
LEADFEMALE:Yo, staff! Mind, Mind, inspect them, inspect them, honey.
LEADFEMALE:I can't, Mork.
LEADFEMALE:- I feel like the border patrol.
OTHERFEMALE:- Mind, you're the lady of the house.
SUPFEMALE:The least you could do is look down your nose at them.
LEADFEMALE:Um Well, I'd like you all to know that I'm very happy to meet all of you.
LEADFEMALE:And, uh, I'm looking forward to getting to know each and every one of you personally.
SUPMALE:A court jester? Yes.
LEADFEMALE:It's so hard to find one without a hump, Mind.
LEADMALE:He's got great references, though.
SUPFEMALE:He used to work for Marshal Tito.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you, everyone.
SUPMALE:Everyone grab a straw and go down to the swamp.
SUPMALE:They love me, honey.
SUPMALE:They really do.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's so hard to find good wit nowadays.
SUPMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I don't know if I'm going to be able to get used to all this.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, honey, now, come on.
OTHERFEMALE:We're still the same people we were when we lived in that little, tiny cracker-box apartment.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy.
SUPFEMALE:How about a couple of sets of tennis? Mearth, where's that girl I hired to teach you tennis? Tracy? Tracy, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, take big steps.
LEADMALE:You hired Tracy Austin to teach Mearth, huh? Tracy.
OTHERMALE:Come on, I'll show you how to blink back the tears when the line calls go against you.
LEADFEMALE:You hired the number-one woman player in the world to teach Mearth? Well, yes, we're getting murdered in doubles.
LEADFEMALE:We had to do something.
OTHERFEMALE:Come on, hon, I've got Arnold Schwarzenegger waiting in the gym to give you a massage.
LEADMALE:Okay, king me.
OTHERMALE:Excellent move, sir.
LEADFEMALE:I didn't see that coming.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, please, Quentin.
LEADFEMALE:Are you kidding? Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Magoo would've seen that one coming.
SUPMALE:Why did you do that, Quentin? - You let me win, didn't you? - Yes, yes, sir.
SUPMALE:- Why did you let me win? - I value my job, sir, as someday I dream of opening my own truck-rental agency.
SUPMALE:The game is over.
SUPMALE:Great game.
LEADMALE:Great game, ladies and gentlemen.
OTHERFEMALE:Good, good.
LEADFEMALE:Can I get you a before-dinner Bosco? No, you can't get me a before-dinner Bosco.
OTHERMALE:You know why? You just like to say "Bosco.
LEADFEMALE:" To be sure.
LEADFEMALE:I don't like him.
OTHERFEMALE:What's wrong, Mearth? Oh, Mommy, I'm bored.
OTHERFEMALE:I've been all through this place.
LEADFEMALE:All the rooms.
LEADFEMALE:I'm tired and I miss Daddy.
OTHERMALE:I know, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:I do too.
LEADMALE:But I'm gonna talk to him about spending more time together, okay? - Okay.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
SUPMALE:As a little backup, I made an appointment with him.
SUPMALE:As a matter of fact, for Tuesday, in his office.
LEADMALE:Gosh, I hope I can find his office.
SUPFEMALE:Madam, there's a gentleman here to see you.
OTHERFEMALE:I believe he's called "Pops.
OTHERFEMALE:" Oh! Oh, great, send him in.
LEADFEMALE:Send him in.
LEADFEMALE:Very good.
LEADFEMALE:Pops.
LEADMALE:How are you, sweetheart? Where's that genius son-in-law of mine? - Mork buy you that coat? - I guess so.
LEADFEMALE:I found it in the trunk of the Rolls he gave me.
SUPFEMALE:Is everybody going crazy around here? Oh, honey, now, now, look, I know exactly what you're thinking.
LEADMALE:I mean, I've always brought you up to appreciate the simple things in life, but, honey, you have to understand at the time I was poor and stupid.
LEADMALE:Oh, no, Dad, listen to me.
SUPFEMALE:This has just gone too far.
SUPMALE:Look at us.
SUPMALE:Look at you and me and especially Mork.
LEADFEMALE:How dare you talk about Mork that way.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you, Thomas.
LEADMALE:Come back around 5.
LEADMALE:We might need a ride to the front door.
LEADMALE:Don't bother washing it.
SUPMALE:We'll buy another one.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, darling, how are you? Big kiss.
LEADMALE:Mwah! Poppy, how are you? How are you? - Hello, son.
LEADFEMALE:How are you? - Oh, not too bad.
SUPMALE:Though I lost a $100,000 today.
SUPMALE:- Oh, stock market? - No, hole in my pants.
LEADMALE:Heh-heh.
LEADMALE:Oh, hon, time to play our little game again.
LEADMALE:- Right hand or left hand? Come on.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork, not again.
SUPMALE:Oh, come on.
LEADMALE:You know how it makes me feel.
OTHERFEMALE:- Come on, come on, come on.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:- Um, the right one.
LEADMALE:- Behold.
OTHERMALE:Oh, there we go.
SUPMALE:Little oyster droppings here.
SUPFEMALE:- There we are, huh? - Oh, what a guy.
OTHERFEMALE:Honey, I've always told you it's just as easy to marry a rich alien as it is to marry a poor graduate student.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
OTHERFEMALE:Mork, we have to talk.
OTHERFEMALE:- Poppo.
LEADMALE:Look, I don't want your presents.
LEADFEMALE:I want you.
SUPMALE:Just buying things isn't the answer to everything.
LEADMALE:Neither is penicillin, but it sure helps a strep throat.
LEADMALE:Mork, I mean, look at us.
LEADMALE:A minute ago I walked in here and Mearth was playing a game of human checkers.
LEADFEMALE:Did Quentin beat him? I told him, lose or else go back to being Gaddafi's food taster.
LEADFEMALE:I'll get a hold of him right now.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you worry.
SUPMALE:Yo! Mork, this is what I'm talking about.
SUPMALE:Mind, I Oh, yeah.
OTHERMALE:- Will you talk to him, please? - Of course I will, honey.
SUPFEMALE:Now, look, son, you're the man of the house now, and I think you should run it any way you want.
SUPMALE:Thanks, Dad.
LEADMALE:Mork, we're gonna have to talk about this later because I gotta get changed to go to work, but I wanna talk to you.
LEADMALE:Oh, you don't have to because I resigned you.
LEADFEMALE:- You resigned me? - Well Well, what about my career? Well, if it means that much to you, I'll just have to buy you NBC.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, and he'll do it too.
OTHERFEMALE:He bought me the New York Philharmonic.
LEADMALE:I knew Bernstein had a price.
LEADMALE:Well, I don't want things just handed to me.
OTHERFEMALE:I wanna work for my career, for my success.
LEADFEMALE:Well, once you have NBC, you'll have to earn every penny.
LEADFEMALE:Olga.
LEADFEMALE:Looking good.
SUPMALE:Mork, what about Mearth? You just can't raise a normal child in this kind of an environment.
LEADFEMALE:Didn't you get my memo? Next week I'm sending him to school in Switzerland.
LEADFEMALE:Switzerland? All right, now you've gone too far.
OTHERMALE:If that's too far, we'll send him to school in England.
LEADFEMALE:Mork.
LEADMALE:Listen to me.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I'm not happy here.
SUPFEMALE:This isn't our home.
SUPMALE:- Let's go back to our apartment.
SUPMALE:- Well, this is our home, hon.
LEADMALE:Well, it might be your home, but it's not for Mearth and me.
SUPMALE:Well, now, wait a minute, hon.
SUPFEMALE:Where are you going? I'm going home to our little cracker-box apartment.
LEADFEMALE:- Here.
SUPFEMALE:- But wait, wait, wait.
LEADFEMALE:You can't go now.
OTHERFEMALE:J.
LEADFEMALE:D.
SUPMALE:Salinger's coming over to shoot the bull.
LEADFEMALE:She's gone, Pop.
SUPMALE:Ah! She'll get over it.
OTHERMALE:Oh, Pops.
SUPMALE:Pops, reason with her.
OTHERFEMALE:Tell her opportunity only knocks once unless you're Neil Sedaka.
LEADMALE:- Excuse me, sir.
LEADMALE:- Yes, Quentin.
LEADMALE:- Will there be anything else? - Oh, yes, yes.
LEADMALE:Let's fly down to Rio.
LEADFEMALE:It's Carnival time.
LEADMALE:We'll put on those big heads and try and get in the car.
SUPMALE:I'd love to, sir, but this is the day I spend with my family.
LEADMALE:Oh, that's right.
SUPMALE:Well, take care and have a good day.
LEADFEMALE:- Good day, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:- Say hello to Carmelita.
LEADMALE:I certainly will, sir.
SUPMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Well, self-reliance is fine, but I miss being waited on hand and foot.
SUPFEMALE:I miss Daddy.
OTHERMALE:Well, I miss Daddy too, but even more, I miss being waited on hand and foot.
LEADFEMALE:That's not very nice.
LEADFEMALE:I don't care if it's very nice.
LEADFEMALE:I'm spoiled rotten.
LEADMALE:I know that.
OTHERMALE:This is no time for sensitivity.
LEADFEMALE:- Shh.
SUPMALE:- Da Mork.
SUPFEMALE:- Mind.
SUPMALE:- Oh, Mork, you came back.
SUPFEMALE:I knew you would.
OTHERMALE:I knew you'd listen to what I said and realize that love is what makes our world go round.
LEADMALE:Oh, hon, well, actually, that's real close because I came back to tell you that I'm going around the world, heh-heh, with my new love.
LEADMALE:Mind, not only is she intelligent and well-read, she can spike a volleyball from here to Key West.
LEADFEMALE:Kareem, eat your heart out.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, no.
LEADFEMALE:Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
SUPMALE:Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, wake up.
SUPMALE:Oh, I was sleeping.
SUPMALE:Sleeping? You were snoring so loud I had to have Mearth wake you up before you blew your adenoids across the room.
SUPMALE:Mork, you're back.
LEADMALE:I mean, you're home.
OTHERMALE:- I mean - Well, why shouldn't I? I mean, my name's on the mailbox, my clothes are in the closet, my hair's on the soap.
SUPMALE:Oh, you know, I had such a weird dream.
OTHERMALE:What kind of a dream? Oh, I dreamed, um I dreamed that we lived in a big mansion with, um, butlers and maids and Tracy Austin.
LEADMALE:And then you left us.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, I mean, how can you dream that? I'd never leave you.
LEADMALE:I mean, with you my life has meaning, and without you, I'd just be another alien forced to do his own laundry.
LEADFEMALE:It was just a silly dream.
LEADFEMALE:I dreamed you could turn polyester into gold.
LEADFEMALE:Heh.
SUPMALE:Make gold? I mean, it's impossible to make gold.
LEADMALE:But diamonds are a snap.
OTHERFEMALE:Mearth, go in the garage, get those charcoal briquettes.
LEADMALE:Mindy, you warm up the waffle iron.
LEADMALE:I'll go get my Oil of Olay.
LEADMALE:No, I don't want diamonds.
SUPMALE:And I don't want gold.
LEADMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Well, how about some French toast? Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, O Potentate of Pasta.
LEADFEMALE:Laying down on the job again, Mork? Oh, no, sir.
SUPFEMALE:I'm just getting in my mood for my report to you on dreams, a wonderful aspect of Earth behavior.
LEADFEMALE:Dreams? That's wonderful.
SUPMALE:What are they? They're little images that appear in an Earthling's mind when he's sleeping.
OTHERMALE:For example, sir, they come fast and furious, and sometimes they're out of sequence just like a Fellini film.
LEADMALE:They can take you to wonderful, strange places.
LEADFEMALE:- Ah! - Oh! - I see.
SUPFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
SUPFEMALE:Another frivolous Earth activity, like marching bands.
SUPMALE:Oh, no, sir.
LEADMALE:Dreams allow one to imagine strange and wonderful things.
LEADMALE:The most precious dreams of all, sir, are the ones that give you a hope for tomorrow.
LEADFEMALE:Till next week, sir, sweet dreams and na-no, na-no.
SUPMALE:
