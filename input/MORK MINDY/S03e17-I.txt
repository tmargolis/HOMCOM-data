SUPFEMALE:Okay, let's see.
LEADFEMALE:''Well, Grandma, that about wraps things up here.
LEADMALE:Mork is fine.
LEADMALE:'' I should say Mork is Mork.
SUPMALE:You never know what he's gonna do next.
SUPMALE:- It's terrible.
LEADFEMALE:- But I think I'm about to find out.
LEADFEMALE:Mind.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind, it's so terrible.
SUPMALE:Mind, I can hold my breath until I turn chartreuse.
LEADFEMALE:''Blue,'' Mork.
LEADMALE:Hold your breath until you turn ''blue.
SUPMALE:'' No, we Orkans hold our breath until we turn chartreuse just before we reach critical mass and explode, Iike Scanners? Well, please don't explode.
LEADMALE:I just vacuumed.
LEADMALE:Oh, Mind.
SUPMALE:Oh, Mork, what are you so upset about? All right.
SUPFEMALE:Well, I met these two singers named Rick and Ruby.
SUPMALE:And they drove all the way out here from Akron.
SUPFEMALE:And then they got out here and then the guy that hired them fired them just because Ruby's rabbit died seven months ago.
LEADMALE:What? Wait a minute.
OTHERMALE:They fired her because she's pregnant? Really? Who'd do such an insensitive sexist thing like that? Remo.
OTHERFEMALE:That explains it.
LEADFEMALE:Since when has Remo had entertainment at the restaurant? Oh, I don't know, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:I guess he wants to try and improve business somehow.
SUPFEMALE:But they came and he fired them, and now they don't have any money, they don't have any place to live, no place to go.
LEADMALE:- You mean they're stranded? - Oh, yes.
SUPMALE:Oh, God, no wonder you're so upset.
OTHERFEMALE:That makes me mad.
OTHERMALE:I mean, so what if she's pregnant? If a woman can work, she should be allowed to work.
OTHERMALE:You wouldn't turn someone like that out in the street, would you? Of course not.
LEADMALE:- What? - No way would I turn them out.
SUPMALE:She says it's okay, come on in.
LEADFEMALE:- Mind, meet Rick and Ruby.
LEADFEMALE:- Hi.
SUPFEMALE:We're sure glad you're taking us in.
SUPFEMALE:- Well - It's really nice of you.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, we're total strangers and everything.
SUPFEMALE:For all you knew, we could have been a couple of real ding-dongs.
SUPFEMALE:- I guess I just lucked out.
SUPMALE:- Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Or even worse, we could have been robbers or axe murderers or game-show hosts or something.
OTHERFEMALE:To tell you the truth, we're not really all that trustworthy even ourselves.
SUPMALE:We're not sure this baby is mine.
SUPMALE:Ricky, would you give me a little hand with this, you think? - Sure, honey.
SUPMALE:- It's so heavy.
SUPMALE:Thanks a million.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, anytime, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:Why don't we go take a nap? I'm beat.
LEADMALE:Let me show you to your room.
LEADFEMALE:- This way, please.
LEADMALE:- Sure.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, pardon me, pardon me.
LEADFEMALE:- It's right in there.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, that's my bedroom.
LEADMALE:I know, Mind, but they both can't sleep on the couch.
OTHERMALE:Ruby will sleep on the couch and you can Rick can-- - The bedroom's right through there.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, thank you.
LEADMALE:Oh, don't you worry.
LEADMALE:The next three months are just gonna fly right by.
LEADFEMALE:Three months? It's gonna be so much fun.
SUPMALE:You know, sharing beauty hints and stuff.
LEADMALE:I just think it's so great to live in a country where you can actually have hair like this and still be allowed to reproduce.
LEADFEMALE:And I'm telling you that not hiring Ruby because she's pregnant is sexist.
OTHERMALE:And I'm telling you the only reason you're saying that is because you're a woman.
LEADMALE:- That remark is sexist.
LEADFEMALE:- I'm not a sexist.
LEADMALE:I'm a man.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanie, get over here.
LEADMALE:Get some water on Table 8, would you? Go stuff your manicotti.
SUPFEMALE:Even she's down on me.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know what's going on here.
LEADMALE:Look, my dad taught me that pregnant women should be taken care of.
LEADFEMALE:They shouldn't work.
OTHERMALE:I respect women.
LEADFEMALE:If you respect women so much, why don't you let Ruby make the choice? I'm telling you, Remo, you are a real chauvinist.
LEADFEMALE:Yeah, Remo, you're a real chauvinist.
LEADMALE:What do we mean by that, Mind? Well, in Remo's case, it's a general attitude that women are inferior.
SUPFEMALE:- Yeah? - Well, they aren't.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I know that, Mind.
SUPMALE:I mean, they sew better, they cook better, they clean better.
OTHERMALE:- I'll talk to you about this later.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You know, Remo has always been like this.
SUPMALE:Whenever we played king of the hill, he was always the king.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah.
LEADMALE:- I was always the hill.
SUPMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:Sexist.
LEADMALE:- I understand what's going on here.
LEADMALE:- Oh, good.
LEADMALE:Now, Remo, imagine what the worst thing that could possibly happen.
LEADFEMALE:Let's say you hire Ruby and the little lady's up there singing on-stage and all of a sudden, she hits a high note, and we all realise that she's not singing.
SUPFEMALE:That couldn't happen because she's seven months pregnant.
LEADMALE:Even if she does give birth on-stage, do you realise how many people would pay to come see her do that again? Mork, listen, I don't think pregnant women should work.
LEADFEMALE:That's the way I feel about it.
LEADMALE:I'm the one that has to live with it, and that is that.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, that is that? - That's it.
OTHERMALE:Well, Remo, I'm sure there are a lot of women's groups around Boulder who'd love to hear about the way you feel.
SUPMALE:I'm gonna make phone calls.
LEADFEMALE:I bet you you'll have a picket line outside your restaurant.
OTHERMALE:Fine.
LEADFEMALE:That's your right.
LEADFEMALE:Just make sure none of them are pregnant.
LEADMALE:- What a chauvinist thing to say.
LEADFEMALE:- Yeah.
LEADMALE:I'll get a couple of men's groups together and we'll be out there tomorrow with you.
LEADMALE:Well, you can cheer us on from the sidelines and keep us supplied with coffee and those little sissy sandwiches.
SUPMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
SUPMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
OTHERFEMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe this.
LEADFEMALE:They got half the town out here.
LEADFEMALE:Even Thelma Jenkins.
SUPFEMALE:I got a date with her tonight.
LEADMALE:Oh, great.
LEADMALE:Dinner and a cold shower again.
SUPMALE:You wanna get rid of the pickets? You hire Rick and Ruby.
SUPFEMALE:I'm not gonna hire a helpless pregnant woman.
LEADMALE:I'm standing on principle here.
LEADFEMALE:Remo, you're 27 years old.
LEADMALE:Why start now? Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
LEADFEMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
LEADMALE:Don't-- Lunch break.
LEADMALE:Boy, am I hungry.
OTHERMALE:I'd like three burritos and lots of ice cream.
LEADMALE:Well, at least we have one customer.
LEADFEMALE:Jeanie, would you? Sorry, but I'm on my lunch break too.
LEADMALE:I'll see you in an hour.
SUPFEMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
OTHERMALE:Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
LEADFEMALE:My own sister? You know, I could be mad at that Mindy.
LEADMALE:Why, if she's just doing what she thinks is right? And here comes the cause of my problem.
SUPMALE:What are you doing on your feet walking around? Will you sit down? Mork, what are you doing? We're picketing this place so people don't eat here.
LEADFEMALE:You crossed the picket line.
LEADMALE:If you chicks had made those sandwiches, I wouldn't be so fammed out right now for sure.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm pretty hungry too.
SUPFEMALE:I'll have whatever he's having, okay? I'm sorry.
LEADMALE:We're all out of burritos and ice cream.
LEADMALE:Rats.
LEADFEMALE:I don't believe this.
SUPFEMALE:I don't believe it.
LEADFEMALE:Why don't we invite the whole picket line in here? Okay, but everybody's gonna have to go Dutch.
SUPMALE:Mindy, come on, let's get together on this thing, huh? All right.
SUPMALE:Mork, you've heard their side, but you haven't heard mine.
LEADMALE:- Now, try and be objective, all right? - Kay-o.
SUPMALE:Thanks.
SUPMALE:By the way, where's Rick? He's home asleep.
SUPMALE:He said this whole thing was my fault so I should be the one to picket.
SUPMALE:Sounds fair to me.
OTHERMALE:No, it doesn't.
OTHERFEMALE:None of this is fair.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, besides my feelings, this is a business.
SUPFEMALE:No one's gonna pay good money to see someone in her condition sing.
SUPMALE:- He's got a point, Mind.
LEADFEMALE:- No, he doesn't.
LEADMALE:Her condition has nothing to do with her ability to sing.
LEADMALE:She's got a point, Remo.
LEADMALE:Mork, I mean, besides risking losing my customers, I have to pay them a salary.
LEADMALE:If Mindy were in my place, she wouldn't do it.
SUPMALE:- Would you pay them? - Of course.
LEADMALE:- She said she'd pay them a salary.
SUPMALE:- She's on.
LEADFEMALE:What? Hey, wait a minute, I didn't say-- I knew you'd do the right thing, you're always on the side of the right.
LEADFEMALE:- No, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:- Thanks, Mindy.
LEADFEMALE:We could really use the money.
LEADFEMALE:Hold it.
OTHERMALE:What I meant-- Mind, you're not going back on your word.
LEADMALE:You're not going to be a shiksa giver, are you? No, no.
LEADMALE:Okay.
SUPMALE:Okay, I'll make a deal with you, Remo.
SUPMALE:If they chase away customers, I'll pay their salary and if they don't, you pay it.
LEADMALE:- Okay.
LEADFEMALE:You got it.
LEADFEMALE:- Okay.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:- That's it.
LEADMALE:- It's not a big deal.
LEADFEMALE:- No.
OTHERFEMALE:- After all, this isn't exactly Vegas.
SUPMALE:I mean, how much could it be? - How much do they make? - Five hundred a week.
LEADFEMALE:Five hundred? Five hundred.
LEADFEMALE:So? It's okay.
LEADMALE:It's all right, Remo, because in the end, talent will out.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna talk to you about their talent.
OTHERMALE:Do you know the name of their group? - No.
LEADMALE:- Ask her.
OTHERMALE:Ruby, - what do you call your group? - The Stupids.
LEADFEMALE:The what? The Stupids.
LEADMALE:See, what we do is we get up on-stage and we act like we're real dumb.
LEADMALE:It's real hard too.
LEADMALE:If you think that being stupid is easy, you really ought to try it sometime.
LEADMALE:Besides being stupid, what else do you do? We sing songs that no one wants to hear.
SUPFEMALE:Don't most performers sing songs that people wanna hear? Oh, well, yeah.
LEADFEMALE:They do if they're smart.
SUPMALE:But we're The Stupids, see? Why aren't Rick and Ruby on the stage? Well, I think they're in the kitchen changing, Mind.
LEADMALE:You're not gonna believe this.
LEADMALE:Rick and Ruby are back there arm wrestling.
SUPFEMALE:- Oh, no.
LEADMALE:- Arm wrestling? That's unfair.
LEADFEMALE:It's two against one.
LEADFEMALE:They got into an argument over what to call the baby and the winner gets to pick the name.
LEADMALE:Okay, I'm ready to go.
OTHERFEMALE:Let me tell you something, baby.
LEADFEMALE:You may be strong, but I got it up here.
LEADMALE:God, what are all these people doing here? I don't know.
OTHERMALE:The food must be pretty good, huh? Let me tell you something else.
OTHERFEMALE:No matter how many times you pin me, we're not gonna name the baby Trigger.
SUPFEMALE:It's a good name.
LEADFEMALE:It works for either a boy or a girl.
SUPMALE:If you guys are late one more time, I'm taking the waggon and going back to Akron.
SUPMALE:Now, do you want me to introduce you or not? Well, of course, Raoul.
OTHERMALE:Guy thinks we're stupid or something.
LEADFEMALE:That's okay.
LEADMALE:Okay.
OTHERMALE:Is it okay if we play a little flamingo guitar? Ladies and gentlemen, The Stupids.
LEADMALE:The name was their idea.
SUPMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:One, two, three-- Wait, I have an idea.
SUPMALE:Why don't we just sort of take a vote and let these people decide what to name the baby? No way, jose.
LEADMALE:We're in Colorado.
LEADMALE:These people will go for Trigger.
LEADMALE:Excuse me, but I'm not paying you to bicker.
OTHERMALE:In fact, I may not be the one that pays you at all.
SUPFEMALE:Just sing.
LEADMALE:God, we gotta tell him how to run his restaurant.
OTHERFEMALE:Okay, one, two, three-- I really am sorry.
LEADMALE:You know, my mind just keeps wandering and that's not so bad, but then it comes back again and I'm sort of stuck with it.
LEADFEMALE:One, two, three, four.
SUPFEMALE:When you were a young boy Did you have a puppy That always followed you around? Well, l'm gonna be as faithful As a puppy l'm never gonna let you down 'Cause it gets higher Higher than a mountain goes lt gets harder, heaven knows - Do l love you, my, oh, my - My, oh, my - River deep, mountain high - River deep, mountain high - y eah, yeah, yeah - y eah, yeah, yeah - lf l lost you, would l cry? - lf l lost you, would l cry? - Oh, l love you, baby - Oh, l love you, baby - Baby, baby, baby - Baby, baby, baby l love you, baby Like a robin loves to sing l love you, baby Like the flower grows in spring l love you, baby Like a schoolboy loves his pie And l love you, baby River deep, mountain high - Do l love you, my, oh, my - Do l love you, my, oh, my - River deep, mountain high - River deep, mountain high - y eah, yeah, yeah - y eah, yeah, yeah - lf l lost you would, l cry? - lf l lost you would, l cry? - Oh, l love you, baby - Oh, l love you, baby - Baby, baby, baby - Baby, baby, baby That was terrific.
LEADMALE:That was just great.
SUPMALE:I gotta admit it, I was wrong.
LEADMALE:Thanks a lot, Remo.
SUPMALE:I have a small announcement.
LEADFEMALE:I'm having a baby.
LEADFEMALE:Ruby, these people may be hicks, but even they can see you're gonna have a baby.
OTHERMALE:No, no, you don't understand.
LEADMALE:I'm having a baby now.
SUPFEMALE:- Now? - Sorry.
OTHERMALE:Just my luck.
SUPFEMALE:My first full house, it's 2-cent beer night.
OTHERFEMALE:I got a lead singer dogging it in the hospital with a little bundle of bliss named Trigger.
LEADFEMALE:I don't think spending the day in the hospital because you've had a baby is exactly dogging it.
LEADFEMALE:Well, she lied to me.
LEADFEMALE:Told me she was seven months pregnant.
OTHERFEMALE:Turns out she was nine months.
LEADMALE:She started counting when she found out she was pregnant.
LEADMALE:Anyone could make that mistake.
LEADFEMALE:I don't know whose fault it is.
SUPFEMALE:I just know I need a singer.
SUPMALE:I can do it.
SUPFEMALE:I sing all the time in the shower, even upside down.
SUPMALE:Thanks, but I need more than a singer who performs in the shower.
LEADFEMALE:I sing in the bathtub, but it sounds different.
LEADMALE:It's more like: Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:What's wrong with us? - Ruby can't perform.
OTHERFEMALE:- Well, so what? I sing.
SUPMALE:Raoul sings.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know.
LEADMALE:She's the only one I ever heard sing.
LEADMALE:I can sing.
LEADFEMALE:I wanna be a star.
SUPFEMALE:I mean, Fats Domino, move over.
LEADFEMALE:All I need is six guys to help me to move Fats over.
LEADMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPFEMALE:Mork, let me handle this.
LEADMALE:Now, Ruby's a pretty lady and a wonderful singer, but let's get something straight.
SUPMALE:I'm the talent of the group.
SUPMALE:So just introduce us, okay? I don't know if I trust a guy who plays a pink guitar with a beak.
SUPMALE:You might as well introduce him.
LEADMALE:You don't have any other choice.
LEADFEMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, here's that group you've been waiting for, The Stupids.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you.
LEADMALE:Sure leaves you wanting more, doesn't it? - I thought you said you could sing? - Well, I am singing.
OTHERMALE:I'm going: Shouldn't there be something betweenand? Well, yeah, but that's Ruby's part, but she just had a baby.
LEADMALE:What are you, stupid? I knew this wasn't gonna work.
LEADFEMALE:Folks, we don't have a lead singer, so maybe we ought to just close up for tonight, huh? Wait, I can sing.
LEADMALE:I can sing, Mr.
SUPMALE:DaVinci.
LEADMALE:- Let me try it, please.
LEADFEMALE:- Mork.
LEADFEMALE:You have never sung in front of an audience before.
SUPFEMALE:What do you call a rubber duck and a washcloth, chopped liver? - Now, come on.
LEADMALE:- Mork.
LEADMALE:I don't know about this.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm not used to working with amateurs.
OTHERFEMALE:I don't know about it, either, but yourain't selling diddly.
LEADMALE:Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not responsible for this.
LEADMALE:Hi, how are you? Thank you very much.
LEADMALE:It's nice to be here.
LEADMALE:Hey, where are you from? What do I do? Hey, for you, sweetheart.
LEADFEMALE:Thank you very much.
OTHERFEMALE:I'd like to sing something very special.
LEADFEMALE:In the key of X, boys.
SUPMALE:Let's play that funky music, white boys.
LEADMALE:And a one and a two and a three.
LEADMALE:Roll on Roll on, roll on I'm really sorry, I don't know the words to that one.
LEADMALE:- What song do you know? - Well, all the way through? That would be nice.
LEADFEMALE:Then we could all finish together.
LEADFEMALE:Well Well, I know this one, ''This Heart is Closed for Alterations''? Wow, I can't believe it.
OTHERMALE:That's our theme song.
OTHERFEMALE:Here.

LEADFEMALE:Jack Prude, Mr.
LEADFEMALE:Jack Prude, thank you all.
LEADMALE:Oh, bless you, bless you.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, I never dreamed that you knew how to sing like that.
LEADMALE:I can't believe you got in front of all these people you never met before, and cool as a cucumber, you just sang your heart out.
LEADFEMALE:- Talk about nerves of steel.
SUPMALE:- Thanks.
LEADFEMALE:Glad we finally understood each other.
SUPMALE:I have a little question I'd like to ask.
LEADMALE:What's it mean when your legs get kind of weak and you feel queasy and you kind of black out? It sounds like you're gonna faint.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, good, because I thought I was gonna have a baby.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
SUPMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADFEMALE:Come in, Your Big Daddyship.
LEADFEMALE:l hear you, Mork.
SUPMALE:Why the cigar? Well, sir, I have reason to be proud, Your Stogieness.
SUPMALE:This week, I helped an Earthling get a job.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, isn't that nice there? - Congrats and huzzah, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Oh, thank you, sir.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm especially proud, sir, since this Earthling was being discriminated against.
LEADMALE:She was, as they say on Ork, with test tube.
LEADFEMALE:- Oh, yes.
LEADFEMALE:- Yep.
SUPMALE:Earth pregnancy.
LEADMALE:- y ou explained it to me once.
LEADFEMALE:- Yes, sir.
LEADFEMALE:Starts with the birds and the bees.
SUPFEMALE:Ends with pickles and ice cream.
LEADMALE:- One moment, Mork.
SUPMALE:- Sir? Are you saying Earthlings can't work in that enlarged condition? Oh, of course they can, sir.
LEADFEMALE:It never stopped you.
LEADFEMALE:l wouldn't know.
LEADMALE:l'm not pregnant.
OTHERMALE:Oh, come on now, sir.
SUPMALE:Come on now.
LEADMALE:You could be about to hatch an entire village.
LEADMALE:- Get on with it, Mork.
LEADMALE:- Yes, indeed-do-dah.
OTHERMALE:Basically, I realised that the expectant mother knows what's best for her.
LEADMALE:Sounds reasonable.
OTHERFEMALE:lt is her pregnancy.
OTHERMALE:Oh, you won the magic prize, Your Perceptive Pudginess.
SUPMALE:You see, most Earthlings think that this is the end of a woman's career, when actually, it's just a pregnant pause.
OTHERFEMALE:Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
LEADFEMALE:Say good night, Bebo.
LEADMALE:That's close.
SUPFEMALE:
