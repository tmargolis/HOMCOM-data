LEADMALE:Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:( loud clank ) Shazbot! ( sings musical tones from Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind ) ( speaking Orkan ) Return to mother ship.
OTHERFEMALE:( beeps ) Sanctuary.
LEADMALE:Thank you.
OTHERFEMALE:Ah, shells.
SUPFEMALE:All I hear is sugar.
LEADMALE:( speaking Orkan ) I won't hurt you if you tell me where the others are hiding.
LEADMALE:( speaking Orkan ) ( squealing ) Whoa Good morning.
LEADFEMALE:Morning.
LEADFEMALE:How's your Danish? ( with accent ): Yeah, sure, it's coming along fine now but right now, it sounds a lot like Swedish.
SUPFEMALE:I mean the rolls.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa, it's late.
OTHERFEMALE:I got to get to work.
LEADMALE:Why are you wearing that rubber coat? Oh, this is a raincoat.
SUPFEMALE:It keeps my clothes dry.
LEADMALE:Why not leave your clothes here and go out naked? I don't think so.
SUPFEMALE:I never know when I might have to demonstrate the accordion.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, humor.
LEADFEMALE:( honking bark ) You don't have to worry, though.
LEADMALE:It's not going to rain today.
LEADFEMALE:Well, sure it is.
OTHERFEMALE:I just heard it on the radio.
SUPFEMALE:Mindy, we Orkans are very sensitive to the positive and negative ion ratio in the air ( beeps ) and the ion ratio today tells me ( beeps ) sunny and clear.
LEADFEMALE:Are you sure? The ion ratio ( beeps ) would not lie to you.
LEADFEMALE:Well, it never has before.
SUPMALE:Okay, you win.
LEADMALE:You mind if I go to the store with you today? I'm observing the leader of the dogs.
SUPFEMALE:What leader of the dogs? The red leader in front of the store: the short one with the four bumps that hangs around the curb.
LEADMALE:Oh that's a fire hydrant.
LEADFEMALE:That's not the leader of the dogs.
LEADFEMALE:Then why do they all salute him? I'll explain it on the way.
LEADFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:( jackhammer pounding ) Grandma, why are they tearing up the concrete outside? ( humming ) Grandma.
OTHERFEMALE:I'll save her.
SUPMALE:They'll never harm you again.
LEADFEMALE:Well, thank you for, uh, saving my life.
LEADFEMALE:I think I'll need the earmuffs again to tune out that jackhammer concerto outside.
SUPFEMALE:Yes, we noticed the workmen installing a hole.
OTHERMALE:How can you miss it? You have to be a broad jumper to get into the store.
LEADMALE:It's a good thing I'm wearing my orthopedic sneakers.
SUPFEMALE:You know, it's freezing in here.
SUPMALE:Yeah, it's colder than a witch-digger's brass monkey.
LEADFEMALE:Is our rotten landlord trying to break the lease again? Why? He hasn't even finished breaking the sidewalk yet.
LEADFEMALE:Hey, Mork, what's happening? Give me some skin.
LEADFEMALE:Eh Nanu-nanu.
SUPFEMALE:Neva.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ( both buzzing ) What it is, what it was And what it shall be.
LEADFEMALE:Right on.
LEADMALE:Hey, where'd the great pile of dirt come from? I think it came with the hole.
SUPFEMALE:Okay, Eugene, it's time for your violin lesson.
SUPMALE:But it's too cold to practice in here.
OTHERMALE:Honey, the way you play, you can leave your mittens on and nobody will know the difference.
SUPMALE:What if my fingers freeze, and I can't play anymore? Your parents will send me a thank you note.
LEADMALE:Now quit stalling, Eugene.
OTHERMALE:Get in there, you jive turkey.
SUPMALE:Keep cool, mama Keep cool, mama.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, hello there.
LEADMALE:Well, Dad, the landlord is at it again.
OTHERMALE:Yeah, I know.
LEADMALE:I just came through the obstacle course out front.
LEADFEMALE:There's a ten-foot hole out there.
SUPMALE:I know.
OTHERMALE:Somebody's going to get killed.
OTHERFEMALE:Arnold Wanker doesn't seem to understand we have another two years left on our lease.
LEADFEMALE:FRED: And you don't seem to understand that if Arnold Wanker can kick us out, he can lease this space to the restaurant next door and double the rent.
LEADFEMALE:Shazbot! Electric Danish.
LEADFEMALE:Why are you wearing your raincoat today? Oh, it's going to rain.
LEADFEMALE:I heard it on the radio.
OTHERMALE:It's not going to rain.
OTHERMALE:Can't you feel the ion ratio? Now we're cooking.
LEADMALE:Get down.
OTHERFEMALE:Get back up again.
LEADMALE:Can't I hear the ion ratio? Ah you've been talking to Trash Gordon again.
LEADMALE:His name is Mork, and he happens to be able to understand a lot of things we can't even comprehend yet.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, apparently.
SUPMALE:He's dancing to a sound effects record.
LEADMALE:( imitating airplanes soaring ) ( imitating bombs exploding ) Wow, bummer.
SUPMALE:Um excuse me.
LEADMALE:Excuse me.
SUPMALE:Why is it so cold in here? Arnold Wanker is trying to freeze us out.
LEADMALE:Now, this has got to be the dirtiest trick he's ever played.
LEADMALE:Uh, no, no, no.
SUPMALE:The worst thing he ever did was in sixth grade.
SUPFEMALE:He came out to the baseball field and he gave us all the free lemonade we could drink.
SUPMALE:( honking bark ) That's not funny.
LEADMALE:Oh.
SUPMALE:Then we found out he'd put a padlock on the only bathroom.
LEADMALE:It cost me two weeks' allowance to buy the key from him.
LEADFEMALE:Now that's funny.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, oh, ah.
SUPMALE:Confusion.
SUPFEMALE:Heavy sigh.
LEADFEMALE:I better be going.
SUPMALE:Charming family you have.
SUPMALE:Take care of them.
LEADMALE:Well strung.
SUPFEMALE:See you at lunch, Mindy.
LEADMALE:Bye.
LEADMALE:Are you going to be all right? Yes.
SUPFEMALE:My project for today is to go to the park and observe how pigeons train old people to feed them.
LEADMALE:Hello.
LEADFEMALE:Eugene is on automatic pilot.
SUPMALE:It was either leave the room or put on my earmuffs again.
SUPMALE:Dad was just telling me what a rotten kid Arnold Wanker used to be.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, yes, dreadful.
SUPFEMALE:I baby-sat him when he was five, and he blackmailed me for all my baby-sitting money.
SUPMALE:Did he catch you necking with your boyfriend on the couch? No.
LEADMALE:That would've only cost me half the money.
LEADFEMALE:Half the money? Grandma, what were you doing? Uh, she was probably supplying illegal drugs to Civil War soldiers.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, why don't you go sit on your Schubert.
OTHERFEMALE:Mindy, dear, I think we ought to lay in a couple dozen of this disco album.
LEADFEMALE:It's number 18 with a bullet.
LEADFEMALE:Grandma, how come you know so much about disco? I know everything.
OTHERMALE:I'm old.
LEADMALE:( thunder rumbles ) ( singing ) There.
LEADMALE:That should kill it.
LEADMALE:( singing in Orkan ) Don't look at me like that.
SUPMALE:I'll still respect you.
OTHERFEMALE:( like Peter Lorre ): Please, I-I want to be your friend.
LEADMALE:I won't hurt you if you just don't scream.
LEADMALE:Do you have any last words? ( speaks gibberish ) Okay.
LEADMALE:( shouts ) ( beeps ) Lunch is hell.
LEADFEMALE:Don't you understand by your doing this, a can of soup will live? ( whistling ) Necrotrons! Warning! Mayday! Mayday! Red alert! Dive! In the bunker! In the bunker! Head 'em up.
SUPFEMALE:We're going to Missouri.
LEADFEMALE:Whoo! ( beeps ) Bullets! Total World War! Warning.
LEADMALE:Jive teapot.
LEADMALE:You'll never sing again.
LEADFEMALE:( thunder cracks and rumbles ) I'd like to speak to you about your "ion ratio.
LEADFEMALE:" You fell for it.
LEADFEMALE:( honking bark ) You mean you knew it was going to rain outside? Sure.
LEADFEMALE:I heard it on the radio.
SUPMALE:Then why did you tell me to go out without my raincoat and umbrella? I was splinking.
LEADFEMALE:Why am I afraid to ask? You see, on Ork, splinking is telling someone something that isn't true a practical joke.
SUPFEMALE:( buzzes ) Well, Mork, you might call it splinking, but we humans call it lying, and it isn't acceptable behavior.
LEADFEMALE:Now, you have got to start acting more human.
SUPFEMALE:But I was.
LEADMALE:I saw a Laurel and Hardy movie where Laurel splinked Hardy, then Hardy went, "There's another fine mess.
OTHERMALE:Hmm.
OTHERFEMALE:" Then he threw a bucket of water on Hardy.
LEADFEMALE:( high-pitched squealing ) Laurel and Hardy aren't human.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, they were human, but ( groans ) Just promise me that you won't do any more splinking or lying.
LEADFEMALE:I promise.
LEADMALE:I didn't think you'd mind getting wet.
OTHERMALE:Look at me.
SUPFEMALE:I'm dripping! My clothes are soggy, and my skin is all wet.
LEADMALE:I hate getting wet.
SUPFEMALE:I'm going to go take a shower.
LEADMALE:But wait, I made a sandwich for you.
LEADFEMALE:It's untouched by human hands.
LEADMALE:Now, if you want to get Fleetwood Mac, I think this album's your best bet, 'cause it's got just about everything you want to hear All right, all right, where's your father? In one minute, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:Wanker.
LEADFEMALE:I happen to be helping a customer.
LEADMALE:$5.
SUPFEMALE:98? If you really want to help your customer, tell him he can get the same album for only $4.
LEADFEMALE:50 at the music store right down the street.
SUPFEMALE:No, wait a minute.
LEADFEMALE:That's a mistake.
LEADMALE:There is no music store down the street.
LEADMALE:Mr.
SUPMALE:Wanker, you are an absolute Absolutely wonderful to see you here, Arnold.
SUPMALE:Isn't it, dear? Well, it isn't wonderful to see you.
OTHERMALE:I've tried everything short of tear gas to get rid of you.
LEADFEMALE:( horn honking ) In a minute! That's my wife.
LEADMALE:I asked her to drive me to a foreclosure this afternoon.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, I guess you need some sort of social life.
LEADFEMALE:And speaking of foreclose, your rent payment is due Friday.
SUPFEMALE:Today is Wednesday.
SUPMALE:Oh, I'll have the money.
LEADFEMALE:In spite of the fact that you've nearly ruined our business by tearing up our sidewalk and turning off the heat.
LEADMALE:It's like an icebox in here.
LEADMALE:I thought you wanted a rent freeze.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, I love my work.
LEADMALE:( horn honking ) Oh, shut up! I'm coming! I've got to use the phone.
LEADFEMALE:Where is it? Oh, I know where I'd like it to be.
LEADMALE:FRED: Yeah, around his neck.
LEADMALE:Oh, um, it's over there.
LEADFEMALE:He's already turned off the heat.
LEADMALE:You want him to turn off the lights next? I don't care.
SUPFEMALE:This guy's been getting away with this for years.
SUPMALE:Somebody's got to tell him.
SUPFEMALE:But do we have to do it now? Chambers! I am sick and tired of calling you about this! I want him evicted tomorrow! Well, so what if he's 90 years old.
LEADFEMALE:Tell him to start for the door today.
LEADFEMALE:( horn honking ) Hold on, you old bat! Oh, that's the trouble with people today! They're just too impatient! Now, that is enough.
LEADMALE:Now, wait I don't care somebody's got to tell him off.
OTHERMALE:Mr.
LEADMALE:Wanker, you have been evicting people and screaming at people and being nasty.
SUPMALE:Do you hear me, Mr.
SUPFEMALE:Wanker? Whoa! I think he's dead.
SUPMALE:MRS.
OTHERMALE:WANKER ( crying ): Oh, Arnold! ( loud crying ) Oh, Arnold.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, try to take it easy, Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Wanker.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, I knew it was coming.
LEADMALE:The doctor told him to take it easy, but no.
LEADMALE:He wouldn't listen.
LEADFEMALE:Arnold CORA: Oh, now Calm down, Annie.
SUPFEMALE:When he left the car When he left the car, little did I know that his last words to me would be "Wait here.
OTHERMALE:" ( wailing ) ( sobbing ) Oh, Cora.
LEADMALE:I feel terrible about this! Yeah, I know, but there's nothing we can do about it now.
SUPMALE:I know, but those awful things we were saying to him.
LEADMALE:He brought this on himself.
LEADMALE:Then why do I feel so guilty? For the same reason I do because he died right here in our store.
SUPFEMALE:We did everything we could, but I'm afraid he's gone.
LEADFEMALE:Oh, well, thank you.
LEADMALE:I guess you can go now.
LEADFEMALE:I'll call the mortuary.
SUPFEMALE:Right.
SUPMALE:We'll leave the deceased back there, then.
SUPMALE:Uh Right.
LEADFEMALE:Come on, Eddie.
LEADFEMALE:Oh Nice suits I'd like to see the rest of the band.
LEADMALE:Oh, it's gonna be a bummer, though, trying to find shoes to match that bag.
LEADFEMALE:Watch out for the hole! My experiment with the pigeons worked.
LEADMALE:They agreed to everything I said.
LEADMALE:Cheer up.
SUPMALE:You look like somebody died.
SUPFEMALE:( honking bark ) ( crying loudly ) Who's the grouch? ( crying ) Mork, will you just be quiet and act like a human being? ( sobbing ) ( imitating cry ) How's that? Shh! She just lost her husband.
LEADFEMALE:It'll be all right.
LEADMALE:He'll turn up.
SUPMALE:( wailing ) He just died.
SUPFEMALE:Oh, yeah.
OTHERFEMALE:He died? Oh, no.
SUPFEMALE:The embarrassment.
LEADFEMALE:Genuine look of grief.
LEADFEMALE:He was such a wonderful man.
LEADMALE:Don't you think so? Oh, well, I didn't know him all that well.
LEADFEMALE:We really never Oh, I-I knew him very well.
LEADMALE:I didn't know him at all.
SUPFEMALE:Uh, when we were in Little League, he used to come around with free lemonade for all the kids.
SUPFEMALE:Oh.
LEADFEMALE:He puts locks on all the bathrooms.
LEADMALE:( laughs, cries ) Grandma was telling me what a bright, observant little boy he was.
LEADMALE:She said that she just wanted to give him everything.
LEADFEMALE:Half of everything.
OTHERMALE:Oh, thank you.
SUPMALE:You've made me feel so much better.
SUPFEMALE:Why is it the young always die good? Arnold Wanker was one in a million.
LEADFEMALE:He was a beautiful man.
LEADFEMALE:He was a real wurble.
LEADMALE:He was an inspiration.
LEADFEMALE:He was an angel.
SUPMALE:He is now.
OTHERMALE:( crying ) Oh, yes, he's an angel Oh, no, no.
LEADMALE:What Grandma meant was a man that good and that loved and that admired must certainly have found a heavenly place for himself.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
LEADMALE:Thank you, Mindy.
LEADMALE:You really cared about him, didn't you? Oh, well, I think I'm safe in saying that Dad, Grandma and I all felt the same way about him.
LEADMALE:He was beautiful.
LEADMALE:Who would believe it? Who would believe it? A few minutes ago, he was here, yelling at us, and now, he's back there, quiet as a mouse.
LEADMALE:He's back there? He's only been there for a few minutes? Yeah, that's right.
OTHERFEMALE:Oh.
SUPFEMALE:Annie ( sobbing ) Annie Annie, dear, why don't I drive you home? Now, come along, dear.
LEADFEMALE:Okay.
SUPFEMALE:Now, everything is going to be all right.
LEADMALE:( Annie wails and mutters ) I'll stay with her for a few hours.
LEADMALE:It's the least I can do.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:Poor woman.
LEADMALE:Yeah.
LEADFEMALE:Her only mistake was in marrying an idiot.
LEADFEMALE:Yes.
LEADMALE:Anybody can make that mistake.
LEADFEMALE:My own daughter did.
LEADFEMALE:( sighs ) Dad, do you think that we might have overdone it a little bit? Oh, I don't know.
OTHERFEMALE:We were just telling her what she wanted to hear.
LEADMALE:( sighs ) I wonder where Mork went.
OTHERFEMALE:He probably saw a flying saucer and thought it was a class reunion.
LEADFEMALE:( singing in Orkan ) ( laughing ) You lucky Earthlings! Do you think you could tone down the exuberance a little bit? There's no need to be sad anymore.
LEADFEMALE:Mork, a man is dead.
SUPFEMALE:A lot you know.
SUPFEMALE:FRED: What?! ( tooting a fanfare ) ( Fred screams ) Stayin' alive, stayin' alive Stayin' alive But he's supposed to be dead.
SUPFEMALE:Not anymore.
OTHERMALE:I gave him a jump start.
SUPFEMALE:A jump start? You can do that? Well, it's a billion in one shot.
OTHERMALE:I did it once on Ork with a, uh, a hairless crawling zabedee.
LEADMALE:Who would know it would work with a lower form of life.
LEADMALE:Conditions were perfect, though.
LEADMALE:You see, he's still a little groggy.
SUPMALE:( high-pitched cooing ) I know this will work 'cause I saw it during the movies watch.
SUPFEMALE:( deep voice ): Wake up, sweetheart.
LEADMALE:And furthermore, McConnell, I'm going to get you to break that lease if I have to break your legs to do it! Now, now, now, uh, let me get this straight.
SUPFEMALE:Conditions have to be perfect? It's a one in a million shot? One in a billion.
LEADFEMALE:You don't think you can ever do it again? Eh And you wasted it on that miserable rat! But he's your friend.
LEADFEMALE:Friend, my word.
LEADFEMALE:I can't stand him.
SUPFEMALE:But you said all those nice things about him.
LEADMALE:I lied! Oh.
LEADMALE:You? Then you lied, too? Oh, I didn't exactly lie.
LEADFEMALE:I just didn't exactly tell the truth.
LEADMALE:What's the difference? Well, the difference is lying is lying, and not telling the truth is lying.
LEADMALE:You're right; I lied.
LEADFEMALE:But you told me lying was bad.
LEADFEMALE:You made me promise never to lie or even splink.
LEADMALE:That stupid woman! I I don't know why I married her! Now I told her to wait.
SUPFEMALE:Now, I got to call a cab! Uh, Arnold, uh, there was a very good reason why she left.
OTHERFEMALE:Well, I'd like to know what it is.
SUPMALE:Well, you were, um uh, uh Let me see if I can put it delicately.
LEADFEMALE:Just say it quickly.
SUPMALE:Well, you were, uh You bit the big one.
LEADFEMALE:Boot Hill, Great White Hunting Ground.
SUPFEMALE:You bought the farm, you kicked the bucket.
LEADMALE:What is this dodo trying to say? He's trying to say you were dead.
LEADFEMALE:Arnold, you had a heart attack right here in the store.
SUPMALE:Heart attack? Ha! How come I don't remember it? Well, think back.
SUPFEMALE:What do you remember? Well, I was on the phone evicting some I remember my, uh, wife honking the car horn.
LEADMALE:I, uh, remember overcharging my fraternity for the beer, and then I pulled the lemonade trick on the Little League, and then I caught my baby-sitter doing Ho, ho, ho, ho.
SUPFEMALE:Wait a minute.
SUPMALE:My whole life flashed in front of my eyes.
LEADFEMALE:Right.
LEADMALE:That was just before you ( imitates bugle blowing "Taps" ) You're all crazy.
OTHERMALE:This is some kind of trick to keep me from breaking the lease, isn't it? Well, it just won't work.
OTHERMALE:Excuse me, sir.
OTHERMALE:Can you tell me where the loved one is? What loved one? We are supposed to pick up one Arnold Winker, deceased.
SUPMALE:That's Arnold Wanker, deceased.
LEADMALE:Only I'm not deceased, I'm alive.
LEADMALE:And I'm going to stay that way for a long, long time.
SUPMALE:No pickup.
SUPFEMALE:Watch out! ( Wanker yells ) ( thud ) for the hole.
LEADFEMALE:You know, actually, Arnold Wanker really lucked out.
LEADFEMALE:I mean, in that terrible fall, all he broke was both legs and his collarbone.
LEADMALE:But the good news is he'll be in traction for months.
LEADMALE:And knowing him, he'll probably sue himself.
LEADMALE:I'm sorry about yesterday, but after you said all those nice things about him, I thought you'd be happy when I brought him back.
LEADMALE:Oh, it isn't your fault, Mork.
OTHERMALE:I guess I confused you with my speech on lying and splinking.
SUPMALE:Yes, it was very confusing to hear you lie after all that.
OTHERFEMALE:Yeah.
SUPMALE:I should have explained to you about something called "little white lies.
LEADFEMALE:" All splinks are blue.
LEADFEMALE:A little white lie is what you tell when you don't want to hurt somebody's feelings.
LEADFEMALE:But how could you hurt Wanker's feeling? He was Croak City.
SUPMALE:But I really would have hurt his wife's feelings if I had told the truth.
LEADFEMALE:So, I just sort of bent it a little.
OTHERMALE:A little? All right, I stretched it a lot.
LEADFEMALE:Ah, so I see on Earth, the truth gets a lot of exercise.
SUPFEMALE:Yeah, but as a rule, you should always tell the truth.
SUPFEMALE:I should never lie? Never.
LEADFEMALE:( door opening ) Hi.
LEADMALE:MINDY: Oh! Oh, I'm so glad you kids are home.
LEADMALE:Now, I've been invited to the Gray Panthers Prom for next Sunday, and I want you to see my new dress.
LEADFEMALE:Whoa! Oh! Author.
LEADMALE:( laughs ) Grandma, it's really colorful.
LEADFEMALE:Well, what I really wanted was a man's opinion.
LEADMALE:( laughing ) Mork, splink like you have never splunk.
LEADFEMALE:Mork? Que wapa! ( giggling ) ( speaking nonsense Spanish ) Cordoba Corinthian.
LEADFEMALE:( giggling ): Oh! ( speaks nonsense Spanish ) Oh, do you really like it? Huevos rancheros, amigo.
SUPMALE:( laughs ) Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
LEADMALE:Mork calling Orson.
OTHERMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:Mork calling Orson.
LEADMALE:Come in, Orson.
SUPMALE:ORSON: I hear you, Mork.
LEADMALE:( electronic whirring ) Good evening, Mr.
OTHERFEMALE:and Mrs.
LEADFEMALE:Universe and all ships in space.
LEADMALE:Let's go to press.
LEADMALE:Dit dit-dit-dit de-de de-de-de.
LEADFEMALE:Flash! File the report, Mork.
SUPMALE:Aw, but you take all the fun out of it.
LEADMALE:The report! ( electronic whirring ) Yes, your Immenseness.
SUPMALE:Today's report is about little white lies.
LEADFEMALE:What? They're the same as little blue splinks.
SUPMALE:See, there are several kinds of white lies.
OTHERFEMALE:Number one, the sports lie.
SUPMALE:I'm tellin' you, Harry, you should have seen the one that got away.
OTHERFEMALE:I'm talkin' big big.
SUPMALE:You know, so big, it almost swamped the dingy.
SUPMALE:Then, there are vanity lies.
SUPFEMALE:How old are you, Mrs.
OTHERFEMALE:Vandergroff? ( old woman's voice ): I'm only 28 years old.
LEADMALE:Then, there are the kind of lies to keep you from getting your lips ripped off.
OTHERMALE:( Southern accent ): Barbara Jean, that was the best meal I've ever had.
SUPMALE:Who could believe it was the first one you've ever cooked? I've never seen anybody do that with figs before.
LEADFEMALE:The secret must be in the cheese.
SUPFEMALE:( imitates newsman ): That's the way it is here on Earth.
SUPMALE:Until next week ( regular voice ): this is Mork signing off.
SUPFEMALE:Nanu-nanu.
LEADFEMALE:
